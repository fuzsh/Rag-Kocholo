        "text": "After months spent acclimatizing on the lower slopes . . . and further months reddening my corpuscles at a lofty base camp . . . I am now poised for the final assault. Scaling the steep Volume III to its summit, Your New Favorite Writer will become one of five or six living human beings to have read Kristin Lavransdatter, the Norse epic by Sigrid Undset. I may even become the only person since the War to have read it in English translation.\n\nThis is no mean feat, Dear Reader. I have been working at it, on and off, for years.\n\nOnce achieved, it will be the obscurest feather in my literary cap. But it portends; for Kristin Lavransdatter is so pure in its essence, so majestic in concept, that the Swedish Academy awarded Ms. Undset—an inscrutable saga all by herself—the 1928 Nobel Prize for Literature.\n\nPerhaps this would be of little interest to you, Gentle Reader, were it not for your secret yearning to use Kristin Lavransdatter as esoteric chatter at cocktail parties. Yet the obstacles, till now, have been great.\n\nHappily, I can give you the essentials, free of charge, thus sparing you the considerable pains I myself have endured in the conquest. Don’t mention it. Glad to do it.\n\n#\n\nHerewith, then, Kristin Lavransdatter:\n\nTo begin with, Marley was dead. Whoops, wrong story. Let me try again.\n\nKristin Lavransdatter was a little girl living in the days when Norwegians were starting to take up bishops and, with some reluctance, leave off dragons. Those were also the days when your last name told who your father was.\n\nKristin’s father was named Lavrans, the Norsk equivalent of Lawrence or Laurence. Had he been Lavrans Olivierssøn, perhaps he would have been a great Shakesperian actor. However, Shakespeare had not been born yet, and Lavrans was actually Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn. He had to settle for being a wealthy Norwegian landowner. But I digress.\n\nLavrans’s daughter, Kristin, was a beautiful, beguiling, and willful child. Her beauty, guile, and willfulness were sufficient to require three volumes of dense Norwegian prose which, when translated into English, does not make any sense.\n\nBut bear in mind, it is Nobel prize material. Or it was, ninety-five years ago.\n\nKristin had a number of childhood adventures which firmed up in her mind the predicament of being a beautiful young maiden enmeshed in the aristocratic life of fourteenth-century Norway—which was mostly a succession of idylls in upland meadows, snowy forests, and scree-covered mountain slopes. As she grew into a gorgeous teenager, she was stupefyingly bored and thus fell in love with the raffish, error-prone Erlend Nikulaussøn.\n\nNow, here is a curious point to ponder, Fair Reader: Kristin was the loveliest creature in all Gudbrandsdal, which is saying something; for those dales are filled with lovely Norwegian creatures. My point is, she could have had her choice among all sorts of wonderful husbands and good providers—many with great ancestral lands of their own. So who did she take up with but Erlend Nikulaussøn—a man acknowledged by all to be capable and charming, but then everybody also knew he couldn’t keep his head on straight.\n\nIt was the stuff of which good soap operas are made. Once Kristin and Erlend did the deed, of course she got pregnant, and her wise old father, Lavrans Bjørgulfssøn, swallowed his pride and gave her hand in marriage to this bounder, Erlend, from Trøndelag.\n\nThe remaining two-and-a-half books explore in a charming, rustic way, every nook and cranny of the consequences flowing from that first-act mistake.\n\nSomewhere in the second book author Undset lets slip that Erlend—tired of the routine tasks of a wealthy landholder married to a beautiful, beguiling, and willful woman—has been dabbling in politics. Medieval Norwegian politics, that is, of the kind that may cost a man his head if the legal king finds out about it. Well, that fact, of course, adds to Kristin’s trials.\n\nAll through this endless parade of elephantine, Erlendesque blunders, Kristin keeps her cool. She scrupulously refrains from criticizing her husband on the principle that—well, I’m not quite sure what the principle is, but at any rate it prevents her giving him any good advice. Which is too bad, because he sure could use some.\n\nYou get the drift. I am sure you do, Dear Reader, since you are among the sharper knives in the drawer.\n\nKristin Lavransdatter exemplifies the best traditions of confused medieval nobles and gives us—what exactly does it give us? An enduring chronicle, shall we say, and let it go at that.\n\nIf, in the course of finishing Volume III, I discover anything heart-stoppingly new and unexpected, I’ll be sure to let you know.\n\nIn the meantime, should you wish to begin your own ascent into post-Viking Norsk literature, just email me, including your postal address. I’ll send you the first two volumes, like new except for the very occasional ketchup stain.\n\nBlessings,\n\nLarry F. Sommers\n\nYour New Favorite Writer\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nDear Reader: This is a Friday Reprise of material originally posted on 28 May 2019. It’s amusing to read it now, because when this was written, I thought the book was done. I had no idea! At any rate, hope you enjoy the retrospective.\n\nThree and a half years ago, in January 2016, I retired from other pursuits so I could try to write fictional stories that other people would like to read.\n\nAfter a few small success with short stories, I got the idea to write a historical novel based on my ancestors Anders Gunstensen and Maria Nybro, who came to Illinois from Norway in the 1850s. We had scant information about their lives—a few dates, places, and milestones—not much more. Not enough real knowledge to support a detailed, book-length factual account of their lives—even if I had wanted to write one. But what I actually wanted was to use the bare facts as a framework on which to hang a made-up story, through which we might discover the world in which they lived.\n\nI spent more than six months on the trail of Anders and Maria. I struggled to imagine a plot around the known and unearthed events of their lives that would make a good fictional story, yet would not much distort the known facts. At last, early in 2017, I began to write text.\n\nThe first draft of this novel, Freedom’s Purchase, took more than a year to write, at a steady rate of 1,500 to 2,000 words per week.This time also included research “on the fly” to support the detailed demands of particular scenes in the story.\n\nMy writing process is iterative. Contrary to what many great writers recommend, I invest a lot of time and effort, while laying down the first draft, in simultaneously revising passages already written. So by June 2018, when I finished the “first draft” of the novel, it was really anywhere between a fifth and a fifteenth draft, depending which part of the book you’re looking at.\n\nI loved my book so much that I started to query agents, seeking a traditional publication contract. After nine months, I felt a bit stymied. At the UW-Madison Writers’ Institute in April 2019, I asked Laurie Scheer about this. She said, “How many agents have you queried so far?” I said, “Thirty or forty.” She guffawed. “Try three hundred!” she said.\n\nDiscouraged? On the contrary, I found myself reassured. The problem was not necessarily with my book; only that the literary market is tough to crack. However, that very reassurance gave me the freedom to consider the niggling little thought that if the manuscript itself were a bit better, that would make it easier for agents to see its merit. Perhaps a hundred fifty queries would be enough to do the trick!\n\nMy other friend in the UW Writers’ program, Christine DeSmet, read my first ten pages—the most important part of any book for making a first impression—and gave me very useful feedback. Her comments showed me how I could make the first chapter not a little better—rather, a whole lot better. So I did. But Christine also recommended dissecting the whole book scene by scene, then improving each scene as needed. I blanched at the thought. I decided to do it anyway.\n\nToward a Smashing Second Draft\n\nI spent the whole next month just reading my book. I analyzed 159 separate scenes; I wrote down the overall purpose of each scene, its setting, its characters, their goals, their conflicts, the resolution of those conflicts, and the particular moments of dramatic change. This yielded an analytical document 54 pages long.\n\nSo now, I revisit each scene to fix the problems that have shown themselves through this process of analysis. A huge task. Yet, not enough.\n\nAfter I work my way through a chapter of scenes, I do the next step, suggested by another friend, Tracey Gemmell, author of More or Less Annie, and other members of my Tuesday evening writers’ group. In Microsoft Word, I search for every “ly” in the chapter (many of these turn out to be adverbs); for every “ing” (present progressives, present participles, gerunds); for every “and,” “or,” and “but” (conjunctions); for every “is,” “are,” “was,” and “were” (verbs of being); for every “saw,” “heard,” “knew,” “felt,” “smelled,” and “tasted” (“filter” words). Then, I re-read the chapter in search of introductory time phrases or other introductory adverbial constructions.\n\nThat step is a lot of work, too.\n\nNot that there is anything wrong with adverbs, a progressive verbs, passive constructions, conjunctions, or introductory adverbial expressions. All those things have their places in effective prose. But they can become crutches that allow us to write gimpy narrative, when overused. By considering each occurrence in isolation, one often finds a more vivid and robust way—a less distanced, less stand-offish way—to say what one meant to say. If you change even a quarter of those expressions to more powerful constructions, it’s worth the effort.\n\nBy the end of this process, I’ll have a book more worthy of readers’ time and attention. And, perhaps, a traditional publishing contract.\n\nStay tuned, dear readers.\n\nLarry F.

Sommers\n\nSHE SQUANDERED HERSELF IN PROTEST and fell to the ground, undone.\n\n“Damn!” Roger set the inner cover, sticky side up, on the grass. He flicked her sting from his wrist with his steel hive tool. You’ve got to scrape them out quick. One time his whole hand had swollen hard and red like a red lobster claw for half a week, from a sting left too long.\n\nHe felt bad for this little darling, who had been squeezed as he laid the cover on the top box, whose alarmed response had spelled her doom. Workers are sacrificial creatures, not built to survive long. Any sting is a suicide mission.\n\n“Damned bees,” Roger grumbled. “Don’t know why I put up with them.”\n\nWell, there’s one reason, staring me in the face. Melvina Foster stood by her clothesline, there across the fence, sour as a crabapple. She grimaced as if in pain. A bit of a wasp herself.\n\nHe gave back her stare, then turned away sublimely indifferent, picked up the inner cover, and placed it back on hive number six.\n\nHe was dead sure that Melvina had authored the anti-bee ordinance proposed last week in the town council. “Bitter, vindictive old bitch,” he muttered under his breath.\n\n“You! Roger!” An eldritch screech. Did the old bat have super-hearing, too?\n\nHe approached the fence with all the swagger he could muster, which he had to admit was considerable. His smooth, untroubled stride pleased him no end.\n\nShe pointed at a lump of wood in his yard. “I see you steer a wide berth around that old stump. I should think you’d have sense enough to remove it.”\n\n“Tain’t a stump, it’s a log. I’ll move it when I’m good and ready. Was there something else you wanted, Miz Foster?”\n\nShe stood sideways, laundry basket under one arm. She shifted to stand a bit taller, winced as she did so. Maybe she was in actual pain.\n\nHe pursed his lips. “You all right, Melvina?”\n\n“I was just wondering how many more of those death traps you plan to install.”\n\n“You mean my apiary?” He scrunched up his face and scratched his chin. “Well, let’s see, I’ve got plenty of fresh cedar boards for new boxes. I do enjoy the woodworking. Keeps me out of mischief all winter, you know? Who knows how many new honey factories I’ll be ready to deploy next spring.”\n\nHer mouth set in a firm line. “You’re baiting me, Roger Fjelstad. I won’t rise to the bait. But consider yourself warned. Some day your bees will attack a small child or somebody with an allergy and put them in the hospital. Or worse.” She clucked with concern for her purely imaginary sting victim. “How will you feel then, Mister Honeycomb?”\n\n“These are the gentlest little Italian honey bees in the world, Ma’am. Don’t bother them, they won’t bother you.”\n\n“That’s what you always say.”\n\n“Because it’s always true. Listen, Melvina Foster, you’ve got no idea what honeybees are about, how they work, or how to coexist with them. Why don’t you come over some time? I’ll introduce you.”\n\n#\n\nHe spotted her as soon as she turned the corner. Since the fence between their backyards had neither gate nor stile, she had to scuttle around the block. Roger couldn’t help but notice she looked more off-kilter than usual.\n\nWhen she turned up his front walk, he rattled his newspaper. “And how are you today, Melvina?” He leaned back in his wicker chair and looked down his nose at her.\n\n“I’m calling your bluff,” said Melvina Foster. “I’ve come to meet your bees. Bet you thought I wouldn’t.”\n\nHe laid down his paper. “Ain’t you scared you’ll get mobbed to death by a swarm of African killer bees?”\n\nShe threw him a spiteful look. “You said yours were from Italy.”\n\nHe sighed and stood. “Benvenuto alla nostra domee-chee-lay.” He spread an arm in welcome.\n\nLimping through the house en route to the backyard, Melvina said, “This looks just like it did when Doris was still with us.”\n\nRoger stopped and stared at her. “Yeah?”\n\n“I mean, you haven’t changed one thing.”\n\n“Maybe I like the way she had it.”\n\n“Except you’ve let it go to seed.”\n\n“There, you see? I have changed things. Added my own special touch.” He gave her a grin that he hoped was savage.\n\n#\n\nIn the backyard, she wouldn’t go near the hives.\n\n“Come on, what’s to be afraid of?” Roger asked, standing smack dab in the flight path of a hundred foragers. “They’re just bees.”\n\n“I can see them fine from over here.”\n\nHe lifted a hive lid, removed the inner cover, pulled a frame partway out.\n\nShe raised a hand to shield her eyes from the sun. “Don’t you have one of those veils? Don’t I see you over here sometimes in a regular beekeeper’s outfit?”\n\n“Veils are for sissies.”\n\nShe made a wry face.\n\nHe pinched a fat drone between thumb and forefinger. “Yes, I do have protective gear. I admit I’m a sissy sometimes. Mainly when I do something invasive, like collecting honey or giving mite treatments. The girls can get a little tetchy.” He carried the drone over to where Melvina stood.\n\nAs he came near, she poised for flight, like a sprinter on the starting blocks.\n\n“Relax, he can’t hurt you. No stinger. This one’s a drone.” He opened his hand to let the bee crawl around on his palm. “Go ahead, you can pet him. See how fuzzy he is?”\n\nEyes open in wonder, she leaned over his hand, within a foot of the confused drone.\n\n“You might spare him some sympathy. He’s an orphan.”\n\nHer jaw dropped in disbelief. “An orphan? You’re pulling my leg.”\n\n“I would never pull your leg, Melvina.” Heaven forfend. “All drones are fatherless. They grow from unfertilized eggs.”\n\n“Is that a fact.”\n\nHe flicked his hand and the drone flew off toward the hive.\n\nShe looked uncertain. “I guess I could stand closer. If you’re sure I won’t get stung.”\n\nHe gave her a frankly evaluative stare. “There are no guarantees in life, Melvina.” He led her back toward the hives.\n\nHalfway there, she stopped and looked down. “Just a rotten log, didn’t you say?”\n\nShe gave it a sharp kick. Dozens of insects flew out from underneath.\n\n“Ow! Help! Oh, help!”\n\n“Run, Melvina!” He sprinted away from her but still felt a couple of nasty stings. “Come on, quick!”\n\nWaving her hands in panic, she flung herself crabwise into the screened back porch as he held the door open for her.\n\nRoger slammed the door shut behind her. He swept his hands around her face and shoulders as she swatted at her bare legs. He grabbed a magazine, rolled it up, and chased down a couple of mad aggressors.\n\n“Sit down,” he said. “How many times you get stung?”\n\n“Hundreds!” She lowered herself onto a battered hassock.\n\nHe frowned. “No. Not hundreds. Breathe slowly. Can you do that?” Pink blotches had blossomed in several places on her face and neck.\n\nHe kept an epi-pen in case one of his bees should ever sting someone with a real allergy. He wondered if he should get it now.\n\nShe took a deep breath, in and out. “It hurts, you . . . degenerate!”\n\n“Nobody said it didn’t. Couple of ’em got me, too—I just run faster than you. Listen, can you breathe okay?”\n\n“Of course I can breathe.”\n\n“I mean, your airway isn’t closing up, is it?”\n\nShe opened her eyes wide. “Airway? Am I in danger?”\n\n“That’s what I’m asking. Do I need to get the epi-pen?”\n\nShe concentrated on her breath. “No. I just hurt all over. My heart is fluttering a bit.”\n\n“You maybe took thirty or forty stings. Once they start in on you, all you can do is run. Each one of those little bastards can sting you over and over again.”\n\n“Well, you and your damned bees owe me a big apology.”\n\nHe bridled. “That’s defamation. Wasn’t my bees. Them were yellowjackets that stung you. Not bees. That’s why there’s no stingers to remove from your hide.”\n\n“Yellowjackets?”\n\n“German wasps. Ground dwellers. They’ll attack anything, anywhere, any time. You uncovered their nest. Now you see why I haven’t moved that log.”\n\nShe bolted up from her hassock. “I see that you’re a menace, is what I see! Bees, wasps, whatever, they’re a danger to the neighborhood. We’ll put a stop to it. Good day, Mister Mayhem.”\n\nShe marched out of the house, down the street, around the corner.\n\n#\n\nFrom his front porch he watched her go. She steamed down the sidewalk straight up-and-down, nothing off-kilter now. Propelled by righteous indignation.\n\nHis bees were threatened, through no fault of their own, by a vindictive bill on the council’s agenda for next week. It was sponsored by Matt Grosswisch, one of the five council members. But Matt never had an original thought in his life. Melvina had put him up to it.\n\nShe had not always been this way. Roger remembered when Melvina had been a vivacious, even daring, young woman. Sociable, too. It was her husband, Jack, who had been the town’s chief pain-in-the-ass in those days. Self-important, officious, hidebound, and narrow-minded—he had it all.\n\nWhen Jack died of a heart attack at age 50, Melvina seemed to have been passed the torch of self-righteousness. She lost her amiable qualities, traded them in for the responsibility of making others’ lives miserable at every turn.\n\nHe sighed and went inside.\n\nAs he stood in the center of the living room, looking all about him, he had to admit that Melvina was right. He had let it become shabby. It would not have gone downhill like this when Doris was here. She, and she alone, had made this a home to live in.\n\nOh, God, how he missed her.\n\nWell, at least he had his little Italian darlings. Until next week.\n\n#\n\nRoger stood on Melvina’s front stoop. He rang the bell. Having heard no sound of a chime inside the house—and his hearing was extraordinarily good for a man his age—he banged on the screen door. He knocked again, scuffing his knuckles in the attempt. He began to fear that she had come home, gone inside, suffered a delayed allergic reaction, and died. Maybe I should have brought the epi-pen.\n\nThe door swung open. There stood Melvina. Frowning, as best she could with her nose and lips distorted and swollen.\n\nHe presented a pink bottle with a flourish and burst into song: “You’re gonna need an ocean . . . dum, da-dum, da-dum . . . of calamine lotion—”\n\n“Have you gone crazy?” She bunched up a fist and shook it in his face, but he did not flinch.\n\n“Take it, Melvina. Right now it only hurts, but in a day or two those stings’ll itch like crazy. You’ll need this. Plus all the Benadryl you can tolerate.”\n\nShe uncurled her fist and took the bottle.\n\nWith his other hand, Roger presented his second gift—a heavy jar of golden liquid. “Here. This comes from the bees. They want you to know there are no hard feelings.”\n\nShe snorted. “That’s big of them. Seems to me I’m the one who should harbor a grudge.”\n\n“God dammit, woman! Are you going to go around that way all your life?”\n\nHer mouth fell. “All what way?”\n\n“Chip on your shoulder.” He stood, holding the jar of honey, in what amounted to a posture of pure supplication.\n\nShe let out a sigh. “Well. To tell you the truth. It seems I may owe your bees a little gratitude after all.”\n\nHe resisted the urge to ask.\n\nShe looked almost shy, like a school girl. “Ever since, I would swear, almost since the moment of the attack, my knees have been free of pain. First time in years. I’m at a loss to understand it.”\n\n“Funny you should say that, Melvina. Exact same thing happened to my knees when those yellowjackets stung me last month. Instant pain relief. And long-lasting.”\n\nShe smiled, nodded. “That’s good to know.”\n\n“It’s such a benefit,” Roger said, “I’m ashamed to admit it was those damned yellowjackets done it, not my bees.”\n\n“Whatever,” she said. Her hand closed over his offering of honey.\n\nAuthor of Price of Passage—A Tale of Immigration and Liberation.\n\nPrice of Passage\n\nNorwegian Farmers and Fugitive Slaves in Pre-Civil War Illinois\n\n(History is not what you thought!)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nToday we resume our series, “Six Simple Steps to Literary Lionhood.”\n\nStep Five: Submit\n\nPreviously, we urged you to embrace your role as literary lion, to write something, to seek honest feedback from readers that you can use to improve your text, and to form supportive friendships with fellow writers and others in the literary community.\n\nBut sooner or later, you will wish to submit your work for publication.\n\nSo here, in Step Five, we offer tips on getting your work accepted and published. Of course, you may choose to publish it yourself, as Walt Whitman and others have done. However, we shall leave self-publication for others to address.\n\nHere we will focus on traditional publication, a process in which you need somebody—most likely a stranger, and often more than one stranger—to say yes.\n\nFUNDAMENTALS\n\nFiction and nonfiction take somewhat different paths to publication, but in all cases there are certain overarching principles you should observe.\n\nSubmit only your best work, in its most polished form.\n\nResearch the publication, publishing house, or agent to make sure you are submitting an appropriate piece.\n\nAddress the editor, publisher, or agent by name, not “Dear Editor.”\n\nFind the applicable submission guidelines and follow them. Every periodical, book publisher, and literary agency posts submission guidelines on its website.\n\nCommunicate cordially, courteously, and professionally. Never whine.\n\nNow let’s look at the submission processes for fiction and nonfiction.\n\nFICTION\n\nFiction is usually written before it is sold. You have an idea and you develop it into a manuscript that says what you want it to say. Then, with completed work in hand, you begin to shop around for a publisher.\n\nShort Stories\n\nIf you have written a short story or a short-short story (“flash fiction”), the process is simple. You seek out magazines or literary journals that publish fiction, or contests that award prizes for short stories, and you submit.\n\nPay close attention to submission guidelines. Usually they’ll want the complete manuscript with a cover letter stating something about yourself. Most contests, and some publications, charge a small reading fee, but plenty of others do not.\n\nSome journals and magazines pay money for short fiction, but many highly respected literary journals pay nothing. You write for the prestige of publication in their pages. But that feather in your cap may pay big dividends later.\n\nNovels\n\nWith a whole book—a novel or novella—the process is more complex. You will pitch to a publisher, usually to an acquisitions editor at a publishing house; or you will pitch to a literary agent who might agree to represent your work to publishers.\n\n“Why do I need an agent if I can submit directly to publishers?”\n\nAlmost all books accepted by the Big Five publishers and their many subordinate imprints come to them through established literary agents. The only practical way to sell your book to Penguin/Random House, Hachette Book Group, Harper Collins, Simon and Schuster, or Macmillan is through an agent. That’s why you need an agent.\n\nBut here’s the Catch-22 of the publishing industry: It’s difficult for an unpublished author to get an agent.\n\nNot that you shouldn’t try.\n\nBut while you are pitching agents, you can also pitch directly to many smaller publishers—independents, regional publishers, and specialty publishers. These presses are just as real and legitimate as the Big Five. They are more numerous, and they may be more responsive. Many books, perhaps yours, naturally “belong” with a smaller publisher.\n\nNote: Make sure you know whether you are dealing with a traditional publisher, who will own the publication rights and pay you a small royalty on each book sold, or with a fee-based publisher who charges you money up front to publish your book. Either arrangement is okay, but a publisher who tries to take money at both ends may not be your best partner.\n\nWhether you pitch your book to an agent or directly to a publisher, follow the submission guidelines. You will need three well-honed documents:\n\nA one-page query letter, briefly and powerfully characterizing the contents of your book and telling a bit about yourself as author.\n\nA synopsis of your book’s plot, about one page single-spaced—no more than about four hundred words.\n\nThe first part of your manuscript. Most publishers or agents will want to see the first ten pages; or they will ask for the first chapter or the first two chapters.\n\nSome agents and publishers want to see only the query letter. On that basis alone, they will decide whether or not to ask for more. So make sure your query letter is great.\n\nSome want you to send the synopsis along with the query letter. Some want the query letter, the synopsis, and the first ten pages. Send what they ask for—no more, no less.\n\nDo not throw these documents together casually or on the spur of the moment. Put as much work into their composition as you gave to the manuscript itself.\n\nIt will seem unfair that, having spent a year or more writing an 80,000-word book, you must now encapsulate the same story in a synopsis of 400 words! But remember, Dear Reader, life is not always fair. And a great 400-word synopsis may get an agent or editor to read your 80,000-word book. So get to it.\n\nSince agents and editors may take their first impression of your work from its first ten pages, you might think it’s a good idea to go back and revise the first ten pages one more time, to make them as compelling as possible. If that’s what you think, you would be correct. Make it so.\n\nOh! And then, by the way, go back one more time and make the rest of the book as good as the first ten pages.\n\nRemember, we said these steps to literary stardom were simple. We never promised they would be easy.\n\nNONFICTION\n\nWhat if you write nonfiction?\n\nIf your nonfiction is of the special kind known as personal memoirs, the submission path for most agents and publishers will resemble that of fiction.\n\nAll other types of nonfiction follow a different path.\n\nThe model for nonfiction is: Pitch the work first, get a deal—or at least an understanding—and then write it.\n\nArticles\n\nIf you’re thinking about a short piece like a magazine article, send the editor of the magazine a brief query letter—usually by email—describing the content of the article you hope to write, pointing out its timeliness and likely appeal to readers, and stating your qualifications as its author.\n\nGive the editor a fair amount of time to respond—at least a couple of weeks—before following up with a cordial note reminding her or him of your original query.\n\nIf the editor says no, say “Thank you” and move on.\n\nIf you get a positive response, it will come in one of two forms. You may receive a definite assignment, which is an offer to buy the article, provided you write and submit it by a given deadline. The editor will specify a “kill fee” to be paid if you deliver the piece as promised but for some reason it is not published.\n\nFormal assignments usually go to established writers. The next best thing is a general statement of interest, such as, “Yes, we’d like to see it.” Such a statement does not guarantee your piece will be bought and published, but it means the editor would like to publish a piece like the one you have proposed, if it’s well done.\n\nIf an editor says, “Yes, we’d like to see it,” your best move is to get back to the editor right away to seek further guidance. Is he or she looking for any particular angle? What is the preferred length? Is there any sensitive area where you should tread lightly? When the editor answers even one or two intelligent questions of this nature, you now have a blueprint for the piece. Write the article as specified in that conversation, and how can the editor say no?\n\nBooks\n\nWhat if you want to write a whole nonfiction book?\n\nThe same approach applies. You pitch the general idea and get a commitment before you write the work.\n\nInstead of a magazine editor, you will pitch to a book publisher or a literary agent.\n\nAnd instead of a simple query letter, you will submit a book proposal—a multi-page document outlining the book’s scope, organization, potential audience, and marketing possibilities. The publisher or agent may give you a very specific format for submitting this information. If not, there are good books and articles readily available on how to prepare a book proposal.\n\nA successful proposal will result in a publishing contract. You will then need to write the book and turn in the manuscript by a date certain. Contract provisions will cover what happens in the event of non-performance by you or the publisher or in the event of creative differences with respect to your execution of the work.\n\nCaveat\n\n“Can I submit the same material to multiple publishers or agents at the same time?”\n\nYes, or no.\n\nPay close attention to what you read on the publisher’s or agent’s website, and use common sense.\n\nAgents receive thousands of queries. Even the most conscientious agents are sorely tasked to respond to all of these queries. Many say, right on their website, “If you do not hear from us within eight weeks, consider that a pass.” If you are an unrepresented author sending a cold query, you need not wait for an agent’s rejection before querying another agent. However, do not query two agents in the same agency at the same time.\n\nSome journals want to have time to read your short story before you submit it elsewhere. They don’t want to invest time and effort evaluating your work, only to learn someone else has bought it. So if they promise to respond within a period you can live with, submit the piece and respect the editor’s prerogative.\n\nOther publications are okay with simultaneous submissions, asking only that you let them know promptly if the piece is accepted elsewhere.\n\nBook publishers live in a world of simultaneous submissions. In fact, some agents, when in possession of a great manuscript, will try to start a bidding war between two or more publishers. If you’re querying publishers directly, you may do the same.\n\nKeeping track of what’s okay with whom is part of your job as a writer. Let your conscience be your guide. Treat others as you would like to be treated, but remember that you and your work work have value.\n\nA Final Thought\n\nWhether you write fiction or non-fiction, short pieces or books, the process of seeking publication is frustrating because (1) there are thousands of worthy manuscripts seeking publication and (2) the market for literary content is highly specific and differentiated.\n\nEach agent or editor has a particular list of wants and preferences, which your piece may not match. That does not mean your work is worthless.\n\nJack Canfield and Mark Victor Hansen’s Chicken Soup for the Soul was rejected 144 times before finding a publisher. Robert Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance scored 121 rejections. Both of these books became classics and sold millions of copies. Persist. You only need one agent or editor who lights up when reading your work.\n\nBut here’s something to think about. If it will take 300 submissions to get your work accepted, what would happen if you went back over your query letter, your synopsis, and your manuscript itself, and made them even better than they are now?\n\nMaybe you would cut that down to 100 rejections. Just sayin’.\n\nSubmit, submit, submit.\n\nNEXT INSTALLMENT: “Step Six: Platform”\n\nBlessings,\n\nLarry F.
