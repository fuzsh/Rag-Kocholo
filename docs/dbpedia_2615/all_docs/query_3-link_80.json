His major prose works include Melancholy; Morning and Evening, whose two parts depict a birth and a death; Wakefulness; and Olav’s Dreams.\n\nHis plays, which have been staged across Europe and in the United States, include The Name, Dream of Autumn and I am the Wind. His work A New Name: Septology VI-VII — described by Olsson as Fosse’s “magnum opus” — was a finalist for the International Booker Prize in 2022.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nFosse has also taught writing — one of his students was best-selling Norwegian novelist Karl Ove Knausgaard — and consulted on a Norwegian translation of the Bible.\n\nMats Malm, permanent secretary of the academy, reached Fosse by telephone to inform him of the win. He said the writer was driving in the countryside and promised to drive home carefully.\n\nFosse is the fourth Norwegian writer to get the literature prize, but the first in nearly a century. Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson got it in 1903, Knut Hamsun was awarded it in 1920, and Sigrid Undset in 1928.\n\nFosse writes in Nynorsk, one of the two official written standards of Norwegian that is chiefly spoken in and around Bergen, where the writer lives. It is used by just 10 per cent of Norway’s 5.4 million people, according to the Language Council of Norway, but is completely intelligible with the other written form, Bokmaal.\n\nGuy Puzey, senior lecturer in Scandinavian Studies at the University of Edinburgh, said Bokmaal is “the language of power, it’s the language or urban centres, of the press,” while Nynorsk is used mainly by people in rural western Norway. “So it’s a really big day for a minority language.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nIn recognition of his contribution to Norwegian culture, Fosse was granted use of an honorary residence in the grounds of the Royal Palace owned by the Norwegian state. Jonas Gahr Støre\n\n“A great recognition of outstanding authorship that makes an impression and touches people all over the world,” Norway’s Prime Minister, Jonas Gahr Støre, wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter. “All of Norway offers congratulations and is proud today!”\n\nIn a statement released by his publishing house, Samlaget, Fosse said he saw the prize “as an award to the literature that first and foremost aims to be literature, without other considerations.”\n\nThe Nobel Prizes carry a cash award of 11 million Swedish kronor (about US$1 million) from a bequest left by their creator, Swedish inventor Alfred Nobel. Winners also receive an 18-carat gold medal and a diploma at the award ceremonies in December.\n\nLast year, French author Annie Ernaux won the prize for what the prize-giving Swedish Academy called “the courage and clinical acuity” of books rooted in her small-town background in the Normandy region of northwest France. Ernaux was just the 17th woman among the 119 Nobel literature laureates. The literature prize has long faced criticism that it is too focused on European and North American writers, as well as too male-dominated.\n\nIn 2018, the award was postponed after sex abuse allegations rocked the Swedish Academy, which names the Nobel literature committee, sparking an exodus of members. The academy revamped itself but faced more criticism for giving the 2019 award to Austria’s Peter Handke, who has been called an apologist for Serbian war crimes.\n\nOur website is the place for the latest breaking news, exclusive scoops, longreads and provocative commentary.
