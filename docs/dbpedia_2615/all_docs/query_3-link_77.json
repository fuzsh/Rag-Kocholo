        "text": "Jon Fosse, the 2023 recipient of the Nobel Prize in Literature, is the fourth Norwegian to win this prize. The others are Bjørnstjerne Bjørnson (1903), Knut Hamsun (1920), and Sigrid Undset (1928). Their lives and literary legacies are radically different from each other. We will learn about their lives and read and discuss a sampling of their work in a variety of genres. This class includes a grammar review and is conducted in Norwegian.\n\nTexts: Supplementary Texts and Norsk grammatikk: Norsk som andrespråk, arbeidsbok by Kirsti MacDonald\n\nWhen ordering books through MNLCP, you will find them listed under events.
