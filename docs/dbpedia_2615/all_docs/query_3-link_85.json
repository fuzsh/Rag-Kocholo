        "text": "Rudyard Kipling was born in Bombay, Maharashtra, India, the son of John Lockwood Kipling, a museum director and author and illustrator. This was at the height of the \"British Raj\", so he was brought up by Indian nurses (\"ayahs\"), who taught him something of the beliefs and tongues of India. He was sent \"home\" to England at the age of six to live with a foster mother, who treated him very cruelly. He then spent five formative years at a minor public school, the United Services College at Westward Ho! which inspired \"Stalky & Co.\". He returned to India as a journalist in 1882. By 1890 he had published, in India, a major volume of verse, \"Departmental Ditties\", and over 70 Indian tales in English, including \"Plain Tales from the Hills\" and the six volumes of the \"Indian Railway Library\". When he arrived in London in October 1889, at the age of 23, he was already a literary celebrity. In 1892 he married Caroline Balestier, the daughter of an American lawyer, and set up house with her in Brattleboro, Vermont, where they lived for four years. While in Vermont he wrote the two \"Jungle Books\" and \"Captains Courageous\". In 1901 he wrote \"Kim\" and in 1902 \"The Just So Stories\" that explained things like \"How the Camel Got Its Hump\". From 1902 they made their home in Sussex, England. He subsequently published many collections of stories, including \"A Diversity of Creatures\", \"Debits and Credits\" (1926) and \"Limits and Renewals\" (1932). These are now thought by many to contain some of his finest writing, although his introspection may well have been influenced by the death of their only son in the First World War. Although vilified by some as \"the poet of British imperialism\" in the past, nowadays he may be regarded as a great story-teller with an extraordinary gift for writing of peoples of many cultures and classes and backgrounds from the inside.\n\nAnatole France, the 1921 Nobel laureate for literature, was born Jacques Anatole Thibault in Paris on April 16, 1844, the son of a Paris book dealer. He attended the Parisian boys' school Collège Stanislas, where he received a classical education, and later matriculated at the École des Chartes. For 20 years after finishing his education, he worked at various positions, including the post of assistant librarian of the French Senate from 1876 to 1890, before devoting himself full-time to writing. He was able to write even when he worked, and in his life-time in which he became the premier French man of letters, he produced a vast output of novels, as well as works in every genre. A story-teller in the French classical style, his literary precursors were Voltaire and Fénélon. His urbane skepticism and enlightened hedonism were in the spirit and tradition of the French enlightenment of the 18th century. His epicurean philosophy was limned in his 1895 book of aphorisms, \"The Garden of Epicurus.\"\n\nFrance's first great success was the novel \"Le Crime de Sylvestre Bonnard (1881), which was honored by the Académie Française. France later became a member of the Académie in 1896. He published an autobiographical novel in 1885, \"Le Livre de mon ami\" [\"My Friend's Book\"], which he followed up with \"Pierre Nozière\" (1899), \"Le Petit Pierre\" (1918), and \"La Vie au fleur\" (1922) [\"The Bloom of Life\"].\n\nFrance was the literary critic on the \"Le Temps\" newspaper, and his reviews were published in a four-volume collection entitled \"La Vie littéraire\" [On Life and Letters] between 1888 and 1892. It was in this period that France wrote historical fiction about past civilizations, focusing particularly on the transition from paganism to Christianity. He published \"Balthazar\" (1889), a story of the conversion of one of the Magi, and \"Thaïs\" (1890), about the conversion of an Alexandrian courtesan. In 1891, he published \"L'Étui de nacre\" [\"Mother of Pearl\"], the story of a hermit and a faun. It was during this period that the classicist France reacted strongly against Emile Zola's naturalism.\n\nApproximately half of France's output appeared in periodicals and newspapers. The style of his novels was rooted in elegance and a subtle irony. \"La Rôtisserie de la Reine Pédauque\" [\"At the Sign of the Reine Pédauque], a historical novel about life in 18th century France, was published in 1893. It proved to be the most celebrated of France's novels; that same year, he used the central character of the novel, the Abbé Coignard, in \"Les Opinions de Jérôme Coignard.\" The Abbé again appeared in \"Le Puits de Sainte Claire\" [\"The Well of Saint Claire\"], a collection of stories published in 1895.\n\nWith \"Le Lys rouge\" [\"The Red Lily\"], a tragic love story published in 1894, France returned to contemporary fiction. In 1896, he began a cycle of prose works focused on the character of Professor Bergeret, one of his most famous literary creations, in the \"Histoire contemporaine,\" published between 1896 and 1901.\n\nHe protested the unjust conviction of Captain Alfed Dreyfuss for treason and the anti-semitism of the French establishment that permitted his persecution, and developed an empathy for socialism. After the Dreyfus Affair, in which he came out in support of Zola, Dreyfus' great champion, France's work became more engaged socially and slanted increasingly towards political satire. In 1908, he published a satire about the Dreyfus Affair, \"L'Île des pingouins\" [\"Penguin Island\"]. Also that year, his biography of Joan of Arc was published. His other major works of his later period include \"Les Dieux ont soif (1912) [\"The Gods are Athirst\"], a novel about the French Revolution, and \"La Révolte des anges\" (1914) [\"The Revolt of the Angels].\n\nAnatole France was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1921, \"in recognition of his brilliant literary achievements, characterized as they are by a nobility of style, a profound human sympathy, grace, and a true Gallic temperament.\" In the presentation Speech by E.A. Karlfeldt, Permanent Secretary of the Swedish Academy, the author of historical novels about the transition from paganism to Christianity was praised for limning \"a faith purified by healthy doubts, by the spirit of clarity, a new humanism, a new Renaissance, a new Reformation.\"\n\nKarlfeldt would go on to praise rance as \"the faithful servant of truth and beauty, the heir of humanism, of the lineage of Rabelais, Montaigne, Voltaire, [and ]Renan,\" but first, he would honor him as embodying the best of French civilization and letters:\n\n\"Sweden cannot forget the debt which, like the rest of the civilized world, she owes to French civilization,\" Karlfeldt said. \"Formerly we received in abundance the gifts of French Classicism like the ripe and delicate fruits of antiquity. Without them, where would we be? This is what we must ask ourselves today. In our time Anatole France has been the most authoritative representative of that civilization; he is the last of the great classicists. He has even been called the last European. And indeed, in an era in which chauvinism, the most criminal and stupid of ideologies, wants to use the ruins of the great destruction for the building of new walls to prevent free intellectual exchange between peoples, his clear and beautiful voice is raised higher than that of others, exhorting people to understand that they need one another. Witty, brilliant, generous, this knight without fear is the best champion in the sublime and incessant war which civilization has declared against barbarism. He is a marshal of the France of the glorious era in which Corneille and Racine created their heroes.\n\nFrance used the occasion to himself honor the Nobel Peace Prize Laureate, the Swedish Prime Minister Karl Hjalmar Branting, a diplomat who worked for disarmament and helped draft the Geneva Protocol, a proposed international security system mandating arbitration between belligerent nations. France also denounced the Versailles Treaty as being unjust and a continuation of the Great War and called for the instillation of common sense among diplomats lest Europe meet its doom. After France received his Prize from the King of Sweden, after all the laureates had again ascended the rostrum, France turned to Professor Walther Nernst, the German Nobel laureate for chemistry, and shook his hand cordially for an extended time. The gesture profoundly moved the crowd as the symbolism of the meeting of the heart (literature) and the head (science) and of two nations so recently engaged in waging a ruinous war against each other was not missed. The audience applauded the gesture as a symbol of reconciliation between France, the nation, and Germany.\n\nAnatole France's writings were put on the Index of Forbidden Books of the Roman Catholic Church in the 1920s. Between 1925 and 1935, France's collected works were published in 25 volumes.\n\nAnatole France died on October 12, 1924 in Tours, Indre-et-Loire, France and was buried in the Ancient Cemetery of Neuilly, Hauts-de-Seine."
