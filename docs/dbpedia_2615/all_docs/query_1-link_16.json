        "text": "By Skyler Gomez | On February 21, 2019 | Updated January 28, 2024 | Comments (2)\n\nHere is a tribute to the women who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in chronological order, starting from the most recent. Note, we need to update this list to include recent recipients: Annie Emaux (2022), Louise Glück (2020), and Olga Nawoja Tokarczuk-Fingas (2018).\n\nThe Nobel Prize in Literature has arguably become the most prestigious literary prize, awarded annually since 1901. It is given to an author from any country who, in the words of Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel, created “in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.”\n\nThe Nobel Prize has been awarded to some 894 men (as of 2023), and around 60 women in all fields combined since its inception in 1895. Seventeen of the women achieved this honor in literature. Above right, Doris Lessing receiving her award in 2007.\n\nThe Swedish Academy decides who will receive the prize and announces the name of the laureate in early October. Authors can be awarded for individual works but the award recognizes and praises the talented author’s body of work as a whole.\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nAlice Munro (2013)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nHerta Müller (2009)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nDoris Lessing (2007)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nElfriede Jelinek (2004)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nWisława Szymborska (1996)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nToni Morrison (1993)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nNadine Gordimer (1991)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nNelly Sachs (1966)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nGabriela Mistral (1945)\n\n. . . . . . . . . .\n\nPearl S.
