        "text": "We are particularly specialized in the development of technologies for production processes, which have either not yet been automated or were previously considered as non-automatable. Let us share our expertise so you can profit from our extensive process know-how from numerous projects in the high-tech sectors: photovoltaics, energy storage, medical engineering and assembly automation. With our extensive expertise, we offer our customers tried and tested processes and efficient system solutions for demanding applications.\n\nFrom hard-brittle silicon, to pliable ultrathin foils, through to fine hollow fibers – our engineering expertise makes it possible to process numerous high-tech materials. Our automation solutions come equipped with a high level of precision and quality to ensure your complex product is produced according to specifications.\n\nWe offer scalable automated and semi-automated assembly and handling systems, for which various elements can be easily reconfigured. By making sure our components are easily convertible, we ensure your flexibility and enable the production of various product types. The integration of additional modules with new functionalities into existing lines can be easily implemented.\n\nWe offer reliable in-line inspection technology and in-process analysis software for consistent quality management in ongoing production. We consider all metrologically relevant steps already during the conception phase of a machine or production line. On request, when finished, the complete solution includes comprehensive quality inspection and evaluation of each measuring cell as well as all inspected objects.\n\nDue to the fact that we have our own laser laboratory and are in close cooperation with competence centers in the fields of laser sources and optics, we are able to keep up with rapid technological development and the implementation of customer-specific laser processing systems.\n\nStructuring of Solar Cells\n\nAutomated tab welding in the production of lithium-based battery cells\n\nCutting | Separation of solar cells\n\nStripping | Decoating e.g. of enameled copper wire in stator production\n\nMarking\n\nSpecific development, having taken place in the field of screen printing since 2009, and combined with our expertise in the processing and handling of hard-brittle materials, has led to pioneering metallization systems and helped to equip them with competitive and unique selling point features. We would be happy to incorporate our expertise in industrial screen printing into your project."
