        "text": "THE CASTLE OF RAPPERSWIL: A SYMBOL OF POWER AND FREEDOM\n\nThe old castle sits, majestic and powerful, atop its rocky outcrop, rising above the maze formed by the roofs of the old town. The lake, the natural border of the peninsula, frames this picture. The silhouette of the town of Rapperswil represents an image of durability, as it has remained virtually unchanged for many centuries. The castle with its three towers and its main building long ago became the emblem of Rapperswil.\n\nThe castle as a symbol of domination and power\n\nThe fortified castle and the town of Rapperswil were founded in the first half of the 13th century by the counts of the same name. The castle has its own individual triangular form. Thanks to these measures of construction and promotion, the counts of Rapperswil tried to further bolster and modernise their domination of the upper part of the lake. The castle would play an important role as a symbol of aristocratic power visible from afar. Following the destruction of the fortified castle and of the town by Zurich in 1350, the Habsburgs bought Rapperswil. The Austrian dukes intentionally created a centre of power on the edge of the upper part of the lake. They had a bridge erected across the lake, between 1360 and 1400 had a new castle constructed on the ruins of the old one and gave it its silhouette, which is still visible. Having the castle facing the direction of Switzerland like an “ostentatious façade” can be interpreted as a signal and a demonstration of power directed at the Confederacy. Later, the castle became the property of the town, which maintained its symbolic role.\n\nThe castle as a symbol of freedom\n\nIn 1868, the Polish Count Plater, who was living in exile in Switzerland, constructed a column of liberty on the Lindenhügel to commemorate oppressed Poland. Two years later, he leased parts of the castle to the town to be adapted into a national Polish museum. The fortress, a symbol of seigneurial power and urban autonomy in the past, also came to represent the struggle for national freedom in Poland.\n\nA castle for everyone\n\nToday, Rapperswil Castle is a place to meet, steeped in history with a vibrant present. Here you can find rooms for private parties, weddings, cultural events and a fascinating trail through the exhibition with some captivating staging recounting the history of the castle. You can also enjoy a refreshing drink in the new café. You’ll receive a warm welcome in the very emblem of Rapperswil!\n\nThe castle is currently closed for renovation. The website of Rapperswil Castle is under construction."
