        "text": "Jonas: Yes. Like I said, I had a dream when I started in the restaurant business to open up my own restaurant. And after, like I said, high school, I worked a couple of years in Gothenburg in a couple of good restaurants. I mean, front side, so a waiter, bar, a head waiter, those kinds of jobs I‚Äôve been doing front of house. Two years in Stockholm. After that, I got the opportunity in the mid 80s to go to an island called Grenada in the West Indies and run a restaurant at a hotel there. And during that year I was there I met three American guys that also opened up a restaurant on Grenada, and they had restaurants on an island called Nantucket outside of Cape Cod in Massachusetts. We became very good friends.\n\nWhen I went back to Sweden again, this is 1986, I got one of the guys, Joe‚Äôs telephone numbers, and he said ‚ÄúGive me a call if you want to come to the States and visit or work.‚Äù So I got back to Gothenburg, then 86, and I got my first restaurant manager job in Sweden, opening up the first brasserie in Sweden actually. And I did that. But after seven, eight months I felt, oh, I always wanted to go to the States and work. So I called my friend Joe and said, ‚ÄúCan I come over?‚Äù So in April 1987, I just had a six month visa.\n\nI actually went over and worked for them for six months and had a great time. I learned a lot. I mean, Nantucket is a beautiful place. It reminded me of Marstrand, the island I grew up in, in the summertime as well. And like I said, a lot of Europeans didn‚Äôt think so high about the US gastronomically, but like I said Nantucket there was a fine dining restaurant that I worked at and was just fun to learn a lot and so on.\n\nBut during the six months I also went into Boston a few times and I really fell in love with the city of Boston. I already was a big sports fan. So on Nantucket as well, every bar had a TV screen on and showed the Boston Red Sox games and also the Boston Celtics were in the prime then in the mid 80s. I went to the NBA finals against the Lakers. So it was a vibe with everything. And I really loved it and actually went to one of the games in Boston Guard one of the conference finals games. So there I really fell in love with Boston and the New England culture and the whole sports scene and food and drink scene that was there.\n\nCarl: Was it there that you got the idea already?\n\nJonas: That‚Äôs really where the seed was planted. When I got the real feeling about it. And the other idea was, of course, one day I was working in the restaurant I worked as a waiter in the evenings and the bar was open during the day and me and another guy we had the bar, we split it every day. So one of the days I was working, it was a Sunday. It was very, very quiet. But two girls came into the bar and one of them was a girl named Ann O‚ÄôLeary that‚Äôs from Boston. And she was on Nantucket helping her brother build a house. And so we talked and, you know, just like that, they were in for an hour or two. They left.\n\nThe next day I was not working, but I went in to say hello to my colleague in the bar and just, you know, take a coffee. And then Ann was sitting there. She thought I was working and we start talking for a long time and something must have happened there. We swapped telephone numbers. The next day, she was going back to Boston. And then about six weeks later, I went back to Sweden. So we really just had phone calls before I left. I didn‚Äôt have time to meet her again. But well, back in Sweden, I was, you know, after six months, I didn‚Äôt really know what I want to do. My father said, you have to go to study, get a normal, you know, get a proper education. I was a little bit tired of the restaurant business after moving back and forth.\n\nGothenberg, Stockholm, the West Indies, Gothenberg, US. So I kind of took like a break from the restaurant business, but Ann and I had contact and after a while she said ‚ÄúI‚Äôll come and visit‚Äù. So she came to Sweden for two weeks and this is 1987-88, Christmas, New Year‚Äôs. And during those two weeks it said ‚ÄòClick‚Äô and we really fell in love. So what do we do then? So during the winter, early spring of 1988, we decided ‚ÄúOh, I‚Äôll come to Sweden‚Äù she said. For me going to the States, it was a little bit more complicated. With work permits. We probably had to get married. And you know at that time we really, really didn‚Äôt know each other.\n\nBut also then during that time I was a little bit tired working 8 to 5, and I really missed the restaurant business. And like I said earlier, I really had a dream to open up my own restaurant. And then kind of the jigsaw puzzle kind of got together there. I had a feeling about Boston, New England sports, and that‚Äôs really when the kind of embryo to O‚ÄôLearys started. I had to go over to the US to interview with the Swedish consulate in New York and meet her and then go up to Boston. And really there I really got more inspiration, stole or borrowed menus, took pictures and also looked at other restaurants and pubs in Boston. And everyone, of course, was showing sports, chicken wings, that kind of casual dining food.\n\nJonas: No, I think in the restaurant business, I mean, if you open up a restaurant and as an owner, it‚Äôs good if you have the contacts, of course. And also if you have the right staff in the kitchen and bar and service. They also have a big network, of course. So the restaurant business is like that. And if you have the right people, they get people. And the talk in town was very, very quick. So that was pretty fun. For about a week after we opened up the soft opening, we had the grand opening and it was crazy. It was lines outside. And then, you know, we started something.\n\nWe were kind of the first place in Sweden, what I know about, we started our kind of after work, but we did it a little bit differently and I got the inspiration from some pubs in Boston. Was that in Sweden we did Fridays but a lot of these places they put up a little buffet. There‚Äôs some snacks it could be celery, blue cheese, some nachos, some chicken wings and so on. So we did something. We called it TGI Friday. We call it TGI Fridays because ‚ÄòThank God It‚Äôs Friday‚Äô. It was before Fridays the chain came to Sweden. But still, that was the whole concept of it. And people really liked that. It was just free food. They just got a little plate and a small fork and a napkin. Everybody that bought something. We didn‚Äôt expect, we just expect that people from 4 or 5:00 would pop in. But just after two weeks or something, it created a‚Ä¶This is before email.\n\nSo fax machines in companies in the central office, especially people in the advertisement business and finance business, people fax to each other ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs go to O‚ÄôLearys.‚Äù So that‚Äôs how it all started with the Fridays and so on. And then also sports, was that showing sports on TV was something new as well. People rarely saw green walls, the memorabilia on the walls, the American style of bar. When you work on the bar and we serve like beer and you drank from the bottle and also we put up like four 28 inch TV screens in the first O‚ÄôLearys. And people thought, they would say, ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs lost it. This is never going to work.‚Äù But suddenly it started more and more.\n\nAnd also the timing is very important as well. Just then like the TV and the satellite, you know, Sweden just had, and many other countries, even in the Nordics and even in Europe, just had maybe have two, three, four channels. But when the satellite dish and the satellite came out, it was much more to be shown. So from just having a couple of maybe Saturdays and big events at the World Cup in soccer or football, for instance, maybe then it was showing on TV. Now it started to showing more and more. Instead of one Premier League game. Premier League started a few years later, we opened and then the Champions League. So we were very lucky that the whole sports thing also kind of grown a lot in the late 80s, early 90s, and that was very, very beneficial for us.\n\nCarl: Yeah. And you know, of course that outlet number one, you could say that‚Äôs the basic one, the first one, the one that you put all your efforts in. Afterward, it grows to 130 and more even maybe outlets.\n\nJonas: I had a plan before we open up, so a lot of my inspiration came from other restaurant chains. That was big casual dining chains in the US. Fridays I mentioned before, of course, the Chili‚Äôs, there was Houlihan‚Äôs and Bennigan‚Äôs a couple of casual dining chains in the US that was big in the 80s and 90s, Hard Rock Cafe, of course. So in the back of my head, yes, I had the thought that it would be a chain and somebody told me, I even said it would be a franchise chain that came in later. I don‚Äôt think I said that before I opened up the first unit, but everything I did with the first unit was that I put out the logo on napkins, sugar packages, matchboxes, drink sticks and so on. So it looked very professional.\n\nFrom day one, it looked like a chain. And actually people just five years ago and maybe even today, a lot of people thought and still think O‚ÄôLearys is an American chain and not a Swedish chain. People were surprised about that. So when we opened up the second restaurant, that was in Stockholm, because I also there had a big network and then we did, you know, we started we could take staff from Stockholm, take them to Gothenburg for training.\n\nWhen we started, we had the same purchasing agreements with all the vendors, the same staff close. We started doing manuals and then the third restaurant, fourth restaurant and fifth restaurant opened up. And all those restaurants I own myself and I had two partners in a couple of them as well. And then in 92, when we opened up the second restaurant with the two partners, that‚Äôs when I started O‚ÄôLearys trademark and I had the franchise rights in a separate company. And that‚Äôs really when I started my first franchise agreements. Even with the restaurant I owned in Gothenburg still, and the future restaurants I opened up with partners.\n\nJonas: Yeah, I mean, with the first restaurant, of course. I worked on the floor, bar, head waiting, waiting and did everything and Ann was not supposed to work. She‚Äôs not from the restaurant business. She had an MBA from Boston College and she was looking into working in finance, but she had a tough time getting a job, really. And like I said, O‚ÄôLearys was such a success. So all the, you know, all the bills was piling up in the office. So she took a role in taking care of the economy. But she also, you know, we cleaned in the mornings. She had to help working in the bar as a cocktail waitress.\n\nSo everything was hands on, of course, in the first unit. And really, really fun. And the better it got, of course you could. But like I said, I didn‚Äôt have, it took like three, four months before we really could have any vacation or anything. You could take a day off or a night off. But then the restaurant business, even when you were off, I always came into the restaurant as well because that was my home and my hobby. But really, when the second restaurant opened up in Stockholm, then it got more traveled every time. I still worked on a schedule a little bit so I could be on the schedule in the bar here and there. I mean, my then wife Ann, lived in Gothenburg. And I went to train back and forth to Stockholm to Gothenburg for about a year or two.\n\nAnd then when the third restaurant opened up, then I couldn‚Äôt be as operational. And then, of course, then you had to. When we scaled up, I took care of all the things marketing and still took a shift now and then.\n\nCarl: Just to touch base with, you know, how it goes there, I guess. And then, you know when the business grows, you say, okay, I took care of other stuff. How difficult was it to let go of this operational, let‚Äôs say, execution within the restaurant? Because that‚Äôs how you start. Its passion. You know, it‚Äôs this hospitality thing.\n\nJonas: I mean, I think the obvious is the same challenges everybody has. You can‚Äôt copy-paste yourself. You wish you could duplicate or clone yourself all the time. So you just have to kind of work that through that you can‚Äôt be in 2 or 3 places at the same time. But otherwise, I noticed that I wanted to grow and I wanted to open up my second restaurant. So first of all, finding partners and I did that for the next four restaurants.\n\nWe opened up two in Stockholm, one in a town north of Stockholm, about two hours. And then we opened up in another town, mid-sized city called Norrk√∂ping. So those restaurants we opened up myself and we had good managers. The two partners we had were silent partners. So it took me time to go through all these restaurants. So I did all the check ups, quality control and so on to make sure all the restaurants were doing well. But I also noticed that if we were going to grow again, it was through franchise. So already 92, 93, when I started the O‚ÄôLearys trademark, I got contact with a good franchise lawyer in Sweden and drafted out the first franchise agreements.\n\nI also did all the agreements with all our vendors, suppliers as well. So that‚Äôs really, the next step was finding franchisees. In the early days because O‚ÄôLearys was such a success and the sport thing was growing. People were calling me and so on.\n\nSo it was, I wouldn‚Äôt say easy, but we opened up one restaurant in 96 in Lule√•, and then another restaurant in 97 and 1998 was two restaurants, and then 99 was six restaurants. And then you had to scale it up. You had to, I mean, I had my own restaurant so I could use staff there for training. I can use the restaurants for training as well. So that‚Äôs really the next step of making it a chain. And then you come into phase, I would say phase three. The first restaurant, the next four restaurants, and then the first franchise restaurants, and then from there building up the company that is still O‚ÄôLearys trademark today. Is basically how then it started in the mid-90s to be a franchise driven restaurant concept.\n\nCarl: With the franchise model. So you say it took you till, let‚Äôs say the end of the 90, to grow to how many 20-something outlets?\n\nJonas: 15 restaurants. So it took about 12 years to be 15 restaurants. Yes. You have to say also, I mean, franchising in Sweden wasn‚Äôt really big. It actually was very, almost looked, the political in Sweden was very kind of socialistic. So franchising was American, bad thing. So it was nothing people look good about really. It was really in the 90s. It started growing. Of course you had McDonald‚Äôs, Burger King and so on. So the franchise kind of business model was getting more and more accepted in the 90s, but it took a while and look in the restaurant business.\n\nYeah, it was a lot of good restaurateurs, but they really just had one restaurant that was there or 2 or 3, 4, 5, but it was really no chain restaurants. If you look in, if you take away the fast food, of course. So we were really one of the first kind of building up a concept that you could scale up and so on. But we had to do it. Like I said, we had to do it. We had to get from the beginning with a handbook and all the manuals, and that took some time to create, but I had good help with that.\n\nCarl: Yeah, fantastic. And you know if I then look into the scaling after 2000, so it took you 12 years to go from 1 to 15, and then it took another ten years to go to 15 to 120. Something like that?\n\nJonas: I would say it took from 15, we say from the turn of the century to 2000, those next ten years we went from 15 restaurants up to about 75, maybe.\n\nCarl: 75. So that‚Äôs a tremendous growth in ten years‚Äô time.\n\nJonas: And that was the next step. That was the phase four because I understood that, okay, I can‚Äôt do this by myself. So, one big thing we did was that we got some help. I tried to get a better board. I also, in 2003, hired an outside CEO because I said I don‚Äôt have the capacity to be a CEO. And then we had then, 2003, was 25 restaurants also. Then I had started looking for a partner and had really failed with that. But when Villa came in as CEO with his network as well.\n\nI was going through a divorce then with Aan, so for two reasons. I need to settle financially the divorce, but also look for a strong both financial partner. A partner with know-how. And that‚Äôs how Select Service Partners, SSP, came in and they bought was it 51% of the company from me and then they bought 44% in 2008. So they own 90-95% of the company 2008. But with SSP, we got the know-how. We also got the security from them. We could build up a small head office, you know, we didn‚Äôt have a CFO or anything so we could hire from, from 4 or 5 people. We could put in 7 or 8 more people. So we had a little bit better organization. And then of course, we could grow slowly when we opened up more restaurants.\n\nCarl: Yeah. So one thing that I find intriguing is you get on board this investor or this partner, which kind of gives you the financial stability you need to grow the business and allows you to open up multiple restaurants and many restaurants in ten years time. But you also give up a little bit of control of your business, of course, because you‚Äôre not the only decision maker anymore.\n\nJonas: Yeah. I mean, I‚Äôve done it a few times now so, but yes, I would of course I would have kept a larger stake, but myself, I wish I had done that. But I also had a saying that I‚Äôd rather own 10% of a restaurant company that opens up 200 restaurants than 100% that just opens up, you know, 25. But yes, also finding the right partner and SSP was right. This was SSP Sweden. They had a really good CEO then, Hans. Then later he got another role in SSP and then Losh was the CEO and they were really good.\n\nAnd also SSP is a great food and beverage company. They, especially of course, in their field, the travel locations, airports, train stations and so on. But they also knew the business. So that was good. We spoke the same language, but with their network, my dream was to be an international chain, that was really, I really wanted because I looked at we‚Äôre going to be bigger than Fridays, you know, that was like the goal I‚Äôd set up. So I saw it and I still see it, even if I‚Äôm not really happy the way O‚ÄôLearys has been going since I left the company. But still, the potential for O‚ÄôLearys was really to work in every other country in the world. Unfortunately, we didn‚Äôt make it to open up in the UK, in the US you have to open up if you want to be a strong international brand.\n\nBut with SSP, we got to the airports, we got the international and we did a run for it. But also they let us work pretty independently as well. We had a board meeting with SSP in it and we could work. We had very close working together with them and developing the concept. I had, still my Stockholm restaurant, I had till 2010, so I still had a foot in the business. We could try out recipes and training and stuff there as well. So that was good. But yes, that was really important for us to have that partner with us. And then of course, they were my compass group then.\n\nThen they were sold to Equity Venture Capital Company. So after 2010, we saw that, they‚Äôre going to do an IPO of SSP. So it was a little window. So actually we bought back me, my CEO and my COO, Christa. We bought back the company, but we had two brothers that came in as investors. So they bought out, we bought out SSP and then me and Christian and also Villa got a little bit part of the company as well. And then we could continue to develop the company from 2012 and forward. And we did that very well as well and really start growing a lot.\n\nJonas: No, we continued. The franchise model really was very good for us. We grow with very low risk. We didn‚Äôt have any corporate restaurants at all until 2016-17. I think was the first restaurant we did. It was a big step for us to do that. But we came to a point, you know, like I said, 2010, maybe 75 restaurants or something. And then by 2018, we were closer to 150 because we had a couple of other brands as well called Boston Grill and so on, but totally close to 150 units when we turned 30 in 2018.\n\nWe felt then that, okay, if we want to take the next step from the 100 plus restaurants we had and really succeed, we need to have a different kind of business model. And one way was having our own restaurants and we opened up some flagship stores and that‚Äôs what we started to do around 2015. And then we needed more capital and we looked into how to get more partners in. And then actually that‚Äôs how we went out and found a couple of companies that were interested to come into O‚ÄôLearys. And it ended up with a Swedish equity company called Altru. But then it‚Äôs a big, big step. Running your own restaurants is more risk and you have to do it right, have the right staff.\n\nCarl: And it‚Äôs much more capital intensive I guess.\n\nJonas: It is. It is. And I think, I mean, even before Altru came in, we did some mistakes, but also we started a little, after 20 years or 25, we needed to do some stuff. We needed to improve the the interior, modernize a little bit. And we did a big project we called it the Fenway Edition, where we really changed a lot of design. And we did it, of course, every restaurant during we open up, it always tweaked a little bit, but we did a big thing around 2012-14 where we did a big change of design, still kept O‚ÄôLearys of course.\n\nWe did a lot of internal work. We started to because when you come up to a restaurant, a big thing like all chains have, is how are the quality? How if you go to this restaurant there and that one in different countries it always has to be O‚ÄôLearys And when you come up to 100, 100 plus restaurants, that is a big, big challenge. But we did a big project that we did for about three years, so we really took all the restaurants. We did a big, big investment in all the staff and we did a lot of training, a lot of improvement of quality, and we had these huge conferences. Also with all the chains, all the staff within the Nordics, we could do that. And it really boosted the whole thing.\n\nWe really, in around 2015-16, were ready for the next step. We also starting to improve the menu. Of course we needed to get better. We had lost a lot in Sweden then as a lot of other parts of Europe, a lot of these more fast casual burger chains started to come up. We had lacked a little bit of food quality. We had taken some shortcuts that we shouldn‚Äôt have done. And we had a lot of debate at the board about this, of course.\n\nJonas: Oh, yeah, that‚Äôs a big question. It‚Äôs a lot of things. I know it‚Äôs hard to say that in one sentence. I mean, first of all, when you start, you need to really believe in your idea. You really need to give it 100%. It could be a chance. But you also have to have a good concept. You also need to get good people around you, a good staff and good advisors. I did some mistakes during that, that I had listened to the wrong people.\n\nI also did some good things as well during all these 30 years. But in the long run, I‚Äôm really proud of actually building up a very, very well known brand, especially in Scandinavia. Like I said, we were over 150 restaurants in 15 countries, 2018 when we turned 30 years old. So I‚Äôm really happy and proud of that. I‚Äôm still called Mr. O‚ÄôLearys, and I always lived with that all my life. It‚Äôs sad that the divorce or break up with the O‚ÄôLearys trademark didn‚Äôt really get a soft landing that I hoped. But those things happen sometimes you collide. We just look different at things and it‚Äôs not only, it‚Äôs my fault as well, it‚Äôs both fault. So I left the company. I wish it ended up better, but who knows?\n\nYou never know in the future what happens. But I‚Äôm glad for that. I‚Äôm very proud and so on. Actually, I‚Äôm in Gothenburg right now because I‚Äôm up here doing some work and some meetings. Actually, I had a meeting in downtown. I actually passed the location where the first O‚ÄôLearys opened up and there‚Äôs actually a plaque on the building. The landlord put it up that says ‚ÄúHere is the first O‚ÄôLearys restaurant.‚Äù So I went by today and took a picture. I‚Äôm very proud of that part of that journey. Fun journey.\n\nCarl: Fantastic.
