        "text": "Switzerland ambassadors Benjamin Rohner and Christian Bach both recommend...\n\nThe scenic Rorschach-Heiden railway line in northeast Switzerland is only locally known, but it is amazing! This mountain rack railway is the only narrow gauge cog-rail in Switzerland, besides the Rigi line. The 7km (about 4 miles) route offers great views, including a view over Lake Constance throughout most of the trip, which can be enjoyed from open carriages in summer. It connects Rorschach with Heiden, which is a starting point for skiers in winter.\n\nAlternatively, Benjamin Rohner recommends the nearby Altstätten-Gais railway line, which also provides great views and open carriages in summer.\n\nBoth railway lines are operated by Appenzeller Bahnen, a private company which accepts Eurail Passes for free travel.\n\nGetting there by rail: The region's biggest city is St Gallen, which can be reached in just over 1 hour from Zürich.\n\nArosa, Graubünden\n\nLocated in east Switzerland, close to Chur and Davos. In winter, it is a good starting point for skiing, while in summer, it is a wonderful starting point for medium hikes up to 2,500m above sea level. For example, take a hike up Weisshorn, which has a good restaurant on top, or Grosser Mythen (1,898m), which has views over Lake Lucerne and the pre-Alps.\n\nReachable by the Rhaetian railway, the famous metre gauge railway line on a track close to some high ravines.\n\nOur wonderful Eurail community have sent us photos and stories of favorite finds that they discovered while traveling in Europe. In Switzerland, our community had a clear favorite region, since all of their photos were taken in the Bernese Oberland, around the town of Interlaken. We've threaded their photos and stories into a tour to show how you can find the best in the area. But first, a timeless photo of Switzerland...\n\nBy Jenny\n\nInterlaken\n\nOne of Interlaken's two beautiful lakes. It has an amazing view of the mountains. I felt like I wasn't seeing this with my own eyes in real life. It looked like a high-definition picture all around me. Best feeling ever!\n\nGetting there by rail: Interlaken is centrally located in Switzerland. Travel to Interlaken West in 47 mins from Bern or to Interlaken Ost in 1h 49m from Lucerne.\n\nBy Cameron\n\nFrom Lauterbrunnen to Jungfraujoch\n\nI managed to capture this beauty while traveling on the train from Lauterbrunnen to Jungfraujoch, the highest train station in Europe. The rolling Swiss hills and snow-capped mountains were a sight to behold.\n\nGetting there by rail: Located to the east of Lauterbrunnen, take the Jungfraubahn, which is not included in the Eurail Pass. You can travel with a 25% discount.\n\nBy jorukleif\n\nThe Schilthorn\n\nAmong birds and mountains. During my Eurail travels in Switzerland at the Schilthorn summit - the most amazing view you can find in the heart of the Swiss Alps.\n\nGetting there by rail: Located to the west of Lauterbrunnen. Either take a bus or the Lauterbrunnen-Mürren mountain railway (not included in Pass, 25% discount) to Mürren, then take the Schilthorn cableway to the summit (25% discount for Eurail Pass holders).\n\nBy Vivien\n\nOeschinen Lake, Kandersteg\n\nThis was the most beautiful lake I'd ever seen, and it was not packed with tourists! It’s a beautiful hike to get there, and it really looks like a hidden gem when you approach it. Truly breathtaking!\n\nGetting there by rail: Located in the next valley west of Lauterbrunnen. From Interlaken West, the journey to Kandersteg takes 1h 05m via Spiez."
