        "text": "Character information Full name: Jonas Johnson Nationality: American Affiliation: Ecocorp Status: Deceased Behind the scenes Role: Main Villain Portrayed By: Robert Knepper Film: Transporter 3\n\nJonas Johnson was a nefarious American mercenary and an associate of a company named Ecocorp who blackmailed the Ukrainian Environmental Agency Minister, Leonid Tomilenko, into hinting at a ship carrying toxic chemicals to Ukraine. To that end, he kidnapped the daughter of Tomilenko, Valentina, and entrusted to the professional transporter Frank Martin, but since the latter was not interested in the job from the beginning and was forced to cooperate, he soon proved to be the biggest danger for the entire undertaking. Johnson was the main antagonist in the 2008 action/thriller film Transporter 3.\n\nBiography[]\n\nBackground[]\n\nJonas Johnson was an American mercenary who was willing to do anything as long as he gets paid for it. He and his organization were eventually hired by the Ecocorp corporation, who possessed large quantities of extremely toxic waste, with which they caused great environmental damage in Ukraine. However, since the Ukrainian Environmental Agency Minister, Leonid Tomilenko, doesn't think of signing an environmentally damaging deal, the company turned to Johnson and enlisted him to force the signing of an agreement. Quickly developing a plan, Johnson and his men intend to pressure Tomilenko by abducting his daughter, Valentina.\n\nHiring a transporter[]\n\nA mercenary from Johnson's crew, Ice, kidnapped Valentina from a nightclub in Ibiza. They take photos of the captured Valentina and send them to Johnson so that he can blackmail Tomilenko with them. The mercenary wants to have Valentina exchanged for the signature on the agreement, but in order to do so he must have the young woman brought to Ukraine. To do this, he wants to recruit a driver to take Valentina from Ibiza to Budapest, and the first one who springs to mind is Frank Martin, a professional getaway driver and transporter. Johnson sends his henchman Mighty Joe to recruit Frank. However, the transporter has retired in the meantime and therefore declines. Since Joe refuses to accept this - as well as the alternative driver Frank names for him - a fight ensues in which Frank injures and knocks down Joe and all the henchmen accompanying him.\n\nAs a result, Johnson resolves to accept Frank's denial and instead enlist Malcolm Manville, the man Frank referred to them as. While Malcolm is told that Valentina will accompany him on the trip to Budapest, she is not revealed to him as the \"package\". Instead, a supposed package that ultimately consists only of phone books is loaded into the trunk of his car. To ensure that Malcolm does not leave his package behind, a bracelet with an implanted explosive device is also put on his wrist and detonates if Malcolm removes the bracelet or if he moves further than 30 meters away from his car.\n\nWhile giving Tomilenko time to process the kidnapping of his daughter, Johnson learns that Malcolm has run afoul of the police while crossing from Spain to France and has finally crashed after a car chase. Since Malcolm was separated from his car after the accident and killed by the detonation of the bracelet, Johnson's venture is now without a driver. The American decides to blame Frank Martin for this and dispatches Mighty Joe to overpower the former military before putting an explosive bracelet on him. Only then does Johnson confront Frank himself in a cell, trying once again to employ him. When Frank tells him he is still unavailable, Mighty Joe speaks up again without being asked to justify himself and Johnson kills his enforcer to silence him. Johnson then holds Frank at gunpoint and forces him to accept the job. Disgruntled, Frank then agrees to deliver the cargo for Johnson - on the condition that he will drive his own car.\n\nWorking with Frank[]\n\nStating that he predicted Frank's condition, Johnson reveals that he already brought his car and took the liberty to improve it to make it more efficient, including a GPS system. His men then load the bags including telephone books into the trunk of Frank's car, making him believe that whatever he's transporting is inside the bags. Meanwhile, then Frank wants to argue into the car and recognizes Valentina in the passenger seat, he insists that he is working alone. Johnson then bluffs and pretends to respond to Frank's objection by shooting Valentina, whereupon Frank relents and agrees to take her along as a passenger for the mission. After handing Frank a cell phone which his programmed to only call himself and money for gas and food and informing him how the bracelet works, Johnson sends the transporter on his way.\n\nA few hours later, when Frank deviates from the designated route in southern Germany and visits his friend Otto to get rid of the explosive bracelets, Johnson, who has Frank's GPS system watched, dispatches a team (including Ice and the Big One) to guide Frank back on the route. After Frank defeats all of the henchmen except Ice, he realizes he can't remove the bracelets and is therefore forced to continue working, finally arriving at his destination in Budapest and awaits further instructions. Johnson then calls a public phone, which is within range of the car. While Frank answers the call, one of Johnson's henchmen quickly gets into the car and drives away - the mercenary has realized that he cannot trust Frank and now wants to get rid of him. However, by stealing a bicycle, Frank manages to stay within range of the car and eventually recaptures it. When he then calls Johnson to confront him for the attempted murder (while his friend inspector Tarconi traces the call back to Budapest), the latter calls it a reaction to the rule-breaking on Frank's part. The transporter accepts this, claims that they are now even, and announces that he will see the job through to the end. Johnson then provides him with coordinates to deliver the package; this time in Bucharest.\n\nShortly thereafter, an angry Frank calls Johnson again, being followed by two armed men and assuming that Johnson is after his life again. In fact, Johnson is not responsible, but realizes that the men are most likely members of the Ukrainian secret service and were sent by Tomilenko to rescue Valentina. Therefore, the Ecocorp associate calls Tomilenko but the minister proves to be far more recalcitrant than hoped, demands to hear Valentina's voice and threatens not to sign otherwise. In addition, he reveals that he knows exactly who Johnson is, which worries the latter noticeably. Johnson is also concerned that he can no longer reach Frank or locate him by GPS. He is thus unable to prove to Tomilenko that Valentina is still alive.\n\nWhen he is finally able to contact Frank again, informs him of a change of plans and transmits him new coordinates in Odessa. On a remote bridge, he and his henchmen await Frank; the latter realizes that the car is surrounded and that Johnson's men will open fire as soon as Valentina is in their possession. In order not to endanger Valentina, Frank orders her to get out of the wagon and go to Johnson. Satisfied, Johnson gives the order to attack, but Frank evades death by driving off the bridge into the water. Assuming that Frank will die either way - either he stays in the car and drowns, or he floats to the surface and explodes - Johnson orders his men to leave.\n\nFinal Showdown and Death[]\n\nTo stay on the move until Tomilenko signs the contract, Johnson and his men make their way to the nearest railway station and highjack a train, forcing all passengers to get out. From the train, he calls Tomilenko and proves to her that Valentina is still alive. Johnson's triumph seems complete, but contrary to all expectations, Frank survives and manages to rescue his car from the river. He now takes up the pursuit of the train and is able to jump onto it from a bridge. After parking his car on the roof of the train, the transporter swings himself into the compartment through the window.\n\nJohnson's men immediately open fire, while the American takes Valentina hostage and tries to retreat to another compartment. Valentina, however, is unruly, bites Johnson's hand and manages to break free. Panicked, she runs off - pursued by the enraged Johnson. In the meantime Frank manages to kill the rest of the mercenaries (including Flag and Ice) so that he can also chase after Johnson - until he realizes that he can't go any further or he'll get too far away from the wagon. Disgruntled, Frank runs off again, which Johnson takes advantage of to sever the connection between their train compartments. The Ecocorp member then smugly turns back to Valentina and sardonically calls out to her that it's over - it's nine o'clock and her father has already signed. However, at the same moment, Frank, who has crashed his car into Johnson's carriage from the roof of the other carriage, crashes and jumps out of the car.\n\nFrank throws himself at Johnson, who shouts conciliatory that the contract is now signed and therefore he has no more reason to worry about Frank and Valentina. He claims that the two are free to go, but Frank isn't done with Johnson yet and a fight ensue between the two men. Overpowering the nefarious mercenary, Frank takes the key to his bracelet from him and takes it off. He then puts the bracelet on Johnson's wrist and drives the car off the wagon. Johnson can only watch the car get further away, giving him no way to avoid his death, which comes onto him as the bracelet explodes.\n\nBecause of his death, Johnson never realized that Tomilenko has not signed the agreement and that Ecocorp's plans have thus failed completely.\n\nReception[]\n\nJames Berardinelli criticized Robert Knepper's performance, considering that he \"fails to exude the sheer creepiness he brings to the TV series Prison Break\".[1] Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum said: \"When Knepper and Statham get together, there’s a fine showdown of grimaces. But only one gets to take his shirt off.\"[2]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJonas Johnson was portrayed by American actor, Robert Knepper.\n\nKnepper was inspired by Ernest Hemingway to create his character's look, and even created a whole back-story for himself. Thus he imagined Johnson to have grown up in a typical small American town, to have graduated from a prestigious university such as Yale or Harvard, to be highly cultured and sophisticated and to truly believe that he was doing the right thing for his country and the world. In addition director Olivier Megaton asked Knepper to draw inspiration from Kiefer Sutherland's performance in Phone Booth (2002).[3]\n\nThe fight between Johnson and Frank was shot in two days and Knepper only had a stunt double for one particular action.[3]"
