        "text": "22 May 2012, Planning appointment signals full steam ahead for new railway station plans\n\nCarter Jonas has been appointed by Cambridgeshire County Council to co-ordinate the planning application for Cambridge’s second railway station which is scheduled to open in 2015.\n\nThe property consultancy’s regional planning team – based on Hills Road in Cambridge – secured the appointment following the bid tender process which saw Carter Jonas in competition with local and national consultancy teams.\n\nThe new railway station, situated in what has been known locally as ‘Chesterton Sidings’, will be the city’s second station and known as ‘Cambridge Science Park’ and it will link-in with the Cambridgeshire Guided Bus network.\n\nCambridgeshire County Councillor Ian Bates, Cabinet Member for Community Infrastructure, said: \"This scheme is absolutely vital for the continued prosperity and growth of jobs and economic success of Cambridge.\n\n“We are glad to work with Carter Jonas in making sure this scheme moves ahead as smoothly as possible and, by using a local company, we continue to support Cambridgeshire business as well as benefit from its unique knowledge of the area.\n\n“The County Council is committed to driving forward the new Science Park Station at Cambridge as part of its vision to invest in projects that boost the local economy and jobs.\"\n\nLeading the Carter Jonas work is Richard Seamark, who is the firm’s head of planning in the region. He confirms the project will require close liaison with bus and rail users, local residents, transport interest groups and authorities, as well as officers and members from the three local authorities – Cambridgeshire County Council, Cambridge City Council and South Cambridgeshire Council – who have infrastructure and development interests in the new station and its impact on the wider transport network.\n\nThe planning application is scheduled to be submitted early next year (2013)."
