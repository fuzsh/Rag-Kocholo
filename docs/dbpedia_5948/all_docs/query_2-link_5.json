Many new jobs were created and people were able to travel like they never had before.\n\nTurvey railway station opened in 1872 and was part of the Bedford and Northampton Railway Company. The first train ran on 10 June 1872.\n\nThe first timetables show that five trains ran in each direction every day.\n\nThere were never any Sunday trains.\n\nThe population of the village rose to 1,117 with the coming of the railways.\n\nThe Working Menâs Room\n\nWhen 200 'navvies' were sent to Turvey to construct the railway many wondered where the little village would find beds for them all. Mr Charles Longuet Higgins lept into action and had a row of cottages built in Baker's Close for their use. Colonel Higgins of Picts Hill built a working men's room in Bamford's Yard, which he supplied with magazines and newspapers. It was converted from a barn. This was a popular place for evening entertainments and somewhere they could meet of a Sunday. It later housed the Boy Scouts in 1928-35.\n\nSignal Men\n\nThe three signal men worked shifts. One did 6 am until 2 pm, then there was 2 pm until 10 pm and finally 10 pm until 6 am again. It was important work and quite well paid.\n\nFind out more about Train Crashes at Turvey!\n\nTurvey Train Crashes\n\nThe Stevington and Turvey Light Railway\n\nTurvey still has a railway! It is a 2 ft narrow gauge one and runs for 1.2 km (3/4 of a mile) along the track bed of the old Bedford to Northampton line.\n\nIt was created by former members of The Surrey Light Railway of Hersham, Surrey in the early 1980s.\n\nThere is a signal box with a 31 lever Westinghouse âLâ frame inside, which was originally from Battersea Park Signal box.\n\nThe railway is privately owned but can be seen from the public right of way that runs down the old railway line.\n\nHere is a link to some images of the Stevington and Turvey Light Railway.\n\nAnnouncement of the new Diesel Rail Buses from 15 September 1958, and details of the timetable and fares.\n\nClick the images to enlarge.\n\nFind out more about the people who worked for the railways at Turvey\n\nTurvey Railway Men Turvey Station Turvey Railway Men\n\nA meeting was held on Friday 19 August 1864, at Olney, to discuss promoting a railway line from Bedford to Northampton, passing through Turvey.\n\nThree members of the Higgins family, CL Higgins, TC Higgins and Col. Higgins (the chairman) were all present, as well as Mr Whitbread who owned Turvey Mill.\n\nThe gentlemen were very concerned that Turvey would be included on the route and that it be operated by the Midland Railway Company.\n\nâThat with a view to facilitate the carriage and traffic which will pass over this railway and prevent any intervention at the junction with the Midland Railway in Bedford.â\n\nDiesel Rail Bus Service\n\nThe Railway comes to Turvey\n\nThe End of the Railway in Turvey\n\nThis picture was taken in March 1962 and show one of the very last trains to pass through Turvey Station.\n\nTurveyâs railway died when the Bedford to Northampton line was closed.\n\nThe Midland Line\n\nThe railway line at Turvey was part of the Midland line that ran from Bedford to Northampton. It was 20 miles long.\n\nThe stations on the line were (in order):\n\nBedford\n\nTurvey\n\nNewton Blossomville Halt\n\nOlney\n\nPiddington\n\nNorthampton\n\nBy the 1950's there were four trains\n\na day but they were hardly used.\n\nCarr Bailey was the Station Master at this time.\n\nThe last passenger train left the station at 9.20 pm on 3 March 1962.\n\nIn 1969, Quenby Price the grain merchants moved into the old station buildings and yard. They did not alter the beautiful station but did remove the platforms.\n\nThis is the lovely Turvey Station building as it was in December 2000.\n\nA Railway in Turvey today...\n\nTurvey Train Crashes Turvey Station\n\nFor more pictures and details of the station building...\n\nHere is a picture of a diesel rail bus coming through Turvey Station.\n\nThe diesel rail buses began in September 1958.\n\nEach bus has 4 wheels and could seat about 40 passengers.\n\nClick the picture to enlarge it\n\nThe rail cars were economical to run, but not always very reliable.\n\nThey were introduced to quite a few parts of the UK in the late 1950s, but all withdrawn by the mid 1960s.\n\nThe line ended its days as it began.. Using steam engines to pull the rolling stock.\n\nIn August 1940 the line between Olney and Turvey was temporarily closed and used as a storage siding for war materials.\n\nHere is the timetable for July-September 1887.\n\nClick to enlarge.\n\nThere were 5 trains a day, which linked with the London train.\n\nA goods train puffs away from Turvey in the early 1920s.\n\nClick to enlarge.\n\nThis is a class 2228 0-6-0 tank engine, built in 1900 by the Vulcan Foundry, it was cut up at the Doncaster Works in 1960.\n\nIt is number 43665.\n\nThe three rail buses that operated through Turvey were built at Park Royal. They were numbers 79971-79973.\n\nNumber 79971 was used as a lamp store and crew room at the Edinburgh Millerhill yard"
