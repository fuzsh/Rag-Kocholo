        "text": "Description\n\nI’m looking for volunteers starting now, two weeks to a month. Please consider.\n\nMy name is Jam, I'm running this project, living here in Czech many years as a musician and seller of vintage stuff. Originally from Australia.\n\nAbout the place. The place is located between Prague and Plzen. A direct train will take you to Prague in an hour, to Plzen in 45 minutes. Historic castle in Zbiroh, on a hill 3 km away, plenty of lakes around. Some really great places to walk and ride.\n\nAbout the station: The station was built in 1910,and taken off the tracks in 2012, I moved here to the old station in December 2014 from Prague. Karez Station is the nearest working train station, it's about a 10-15 minute walk away from the station (please ask me for exact location to entry of path rather trying to walk, it's not on google maps) . A lot of varied jobs at the station, focusing on restoration & refitting the place and creating new uses and I still sell vintage things on ebay. The main income for the building is short term rental of the flats to tourists, and its going really well. So jobs at this point revolve mostly around these two businesses and the gardens.\n\nThe station has a non-profit organisation, started in 2018 the station has also now got a license to do business through the non-profit, proceeds from activities will go towards the mission of the non-profit organisation. The general mission statement of the organisation is this. For the last years volunteers have helped with the re-birth of the old railway station, that is a cultural monument. The non profit organisation is a means for more people to get involved, a foundation for the building and a way to bring events to the community. Ideas for the business activity of the non-profit include: using used coffee to create mushrooms (starbucks has already offered their waste), using bottle tops to make materials for reprap 3D printers, as well as providing accommodation to non-profit organisations and refugees. I'm open to business ideas that you might like to bring to the stations non-profit organisation, possibility of long term accommodation for you and your project. The non-profit is totally self funded at this point.\n\nI have a lot of ideas on how to organise the station and what to set up here. A gallery, a stop over point for bike riders, a community workshop area with café, maybe even brew our own drink. What ideas stick with the place who can say, yet many things are possible, plenty of space to do things.\n\nWhere possible i ask that people to use less hot water, electricity prices have increased, with the climate change here, consider energy use. Use cold wash with cloths, general common sense.\n\nAbout the building.\n\nThe building has 6 flats. Area has its own water supply and land, so it also has the potential to grow things. Also, i have 3 cats, they are very friendly.\n\nPlease start any message when applying to this project with. \"Hi Jam\"\n\nOtherwise i will respond with \"Please read the profile\"\n\nCultural exchange and learning opportunities\n\nMost travelers that come here benefit from being able to take some time out from the regular travel life, making new connections while working together. I do my best to make sure that you have things to do and places to see in your free time. There are plenty of things to do and interesting things to see that are close to the station, and the station is close to a new train station (Kařez), a bus stop is at the station (Borek). Look up the location of the station on google maps & ask me for a link to the blog.\n\nTasks include. Sanding and varnishing of floors, building pallet gardens, sanding and painting windows, working with vintage interiors in rental flats, cleaning, packing, photographing and listing of vintage things, bee keeping, seeding and moving soil for new gardens, helping with cooking.\n\nYou must have health insurance, if your from outside the European Union before you arrive, please send a copy of your health insurance policy, showing that your covered for medical treatment in the Czech republic.\n\nFor the days off i prefer that people goto Prague and stay at a hostel, yet it’s not a must. I have a discount code for staying at a good hostel in Prague 7. Its 10-20 percent less, depending on the time of year. So ask me for that code and consider staying at this hostel, before, after and during your stay. I don't demand that people stay in Prague for the weekends, yet if you want to stay at the station and have a really limited budget, Let me know this before you arrive. It’s not a problem, just that it’s good for me to know... as this kind of thing can effect the program for other volunteers.\n\nThis profile was updated March 2024\n\nAccommodation\n\nAccommodation\n\nWhat you can expect coming to the station:\n\n- food vegetarian, 3 meals per day.\n\n- a bed with sheets, and duvet cover in a shared bedroom.\n\n- shower. Every second day in evening.\n\n- washing machine. One load of washing per week stay. Please arrive with clothes washed. I ask that you wash using cold wash. I have effective washing powder for this.\n\n- Internet connection.\n\n-If you stay less than two weeks, or leave before the end of a work week. Work on the day you leave.\n\n-Be mindful of energy consumption.\n\nYour experience depends a lot on your attitude, my attitude and what's happening at the time. Its important that you find somewhere in this project that fits for you, so ask for a link to my blog and feel free to discuss how you might help before you arrive, writing this reminds me that i have to improve the blog.\n\nIn the past i've had people arrive with issues with vegetarian and vegan diets, eating disorders and political bias against open ideas. Please consider carefully if this project is the right fit for you.\n\nI have a bunch of house rules based on common sense, & experience over time.\n\nWhat else ...\n\nInteresting castles that are close to the station: Zbiroh, Tocnik, Karlštejn & Křivoklát. You can ride a bike from the station to castles Zbiroh & Tocnik, or catch a train to Karlštejn & Křivoklát, use the website to find the times of trains. Cut and paste into this website IDOS is \"Kařez,,Borek\". That's US. All castles have their own websites.\n\nUse the bus stop directly outside the station and goto off beat small towns near the station. Get off the bus, go for a walk, have a beer and then get back on the bus. Be aware though that the buses don't run so often, so be a couple of minutes early always & make sure you're on the correct side of the road, for the ride back. Bus drivers often around here are not so tolerant of foreigners, don't take offence to it though. Its a good idea to have your small change ready though, maybe even a note pad with your destination.\n\nTwo lakes are directly next to the station, if you need to clear your mind and relax, go for a walk around these lakes.\n\nTrip to Prague after volunteering. Its possible to catch the train that leaves from the station after working as a volunteer at 3:35PM Karez, and a train leaves from Prague back at 11:22 PM, arriving at Karez 12:22PM, a path connects the Karez station with the old Zbiroh station (where I am). Your able to do this trip, yet if you miss the train back. The next one does not leave till 4:32AM in the morning, so don't miss it. This train does not run on Saturday nights.\n\nPlzen.\n\nA Trip to Plzen from Karez, it's about 40 minutes. Be aware that the last direct train back is at about 8:40, Plzen does not have any hostels.\n\nThings to visit in Plzen.\n\n-Pilsner Urquell Brewery was the first brewery in the world to produce a light ale, they run regular tours all day.\n\n-Visit the depo2015, interesting gallery/cafe/makers space and shared work space.\n\n-The Jewish Synagogue often has exhibitions.\n\n-Plzen also has a two nice tea houses near the centre, Perlová čajovna & Cajovna u Pekla. Tea culture is popular in the Czech republic, most major towns and cities have a tea houses.\n\nWill continue to update here with more trips & things to do."
