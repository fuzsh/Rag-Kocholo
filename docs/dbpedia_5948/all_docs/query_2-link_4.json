        "text": "With breathaking mountain views across Snowdonia, this Grade II listed 15th century manor house would be special even without its most extraordinary feature…\n\n...It has its own working train platform!\n\nNamed Plas Y Dduallt, the property’s oldest part dates as far back as the 1400s and was home to the noble Welsh family, the Llywds, descended from Llywelyn the Great. The dwelling is said to have been visited by Oliver Cromwell during the siege of Harlech during the 1460s.\n\nBut the best bit of the house is the private railway platform set within the property’s five acres of grounds on the Ffestiniog Railway. From here you can actually catch a train to Porthmadog and Blaenau Ffestiniog.\n\nThe former owner, Colonel Andrew Campbell, built Campbell’s Platform in 1962, when there was no driveway to the property. The colonel would drive his locomotive on the Ffestiniog Railway, which was normally used to carry slate from the Ffestiniog Quarries to the coast.\n\nMany traditional features can be spotted throughout the four-bedroom historic house, such as exposed stone walls, beams, slate flagged floors, grand fireplaces, and the arched window and vaulted ceiling in the kitchen.\n\nThere is a wine cellar, dining room and sitting room on the lower floors, along with a sun-filled garden room that leads out to the gardens.\n\nMany of the rooms look upon gorgeous scenes but the stone balcony is a particularly good vantage point and provides far-reaching views of the Rhinog mountain range.\n\nOutside, there is a cottage-style garden, kitchen garden, extensive vegetable garden and a traditional stone barn. Furthermore, there is an ancient oak woodland alongside the property.\n\nCountry ramblers will also appreciate the home’s proximity to Snowdonia National Park, with its many walking trails and unbeatable vistas.\n\nThis property is available for £795,000 through Carter Jonas.\n\nTake a tour:"
