        "text": "Come rain or shine, I can't resist a walk through the medieval town of Rapperswil. With its cobblestone streets and high castle walls, it's like taking a walk back in time.\n\nRapperswil Castle sits atop Lindenhof hill, which belongs to the canton of St. Gallen. It was formed by glacial debris during the last glacial period in Switzerland.\n\nInside the castle is a beautiful courtyard and Polish museum, which seems out of place at first, but it actually has important historical context and represents friendly relations between Poland and Switzerland.\n\nUnfortunately, the museum will not be open much longer. Towards the end 2014, it was announced that the Polish Museum would be removed from Rapperswil Castle.\n\nWhat will remain is the Polish freedom pillar, pictured here beside Powder Tower.\n\nSince Rapperswil Castle is at the highest point in the city of Rapperswil, it boasts a fantastic view of Lake Zurich. There are so many beautiful cities along Lake Zurich, and Rapperswil is definitely one of them.\n\nIf you're looking for a quiet and beautiful escape for the day, Rapperswil Castle is the perfect place to visit.\n\nI know it won't be long before I return.\n\nReady to Visit?\n\nFor anyone staying in the city of Zurich, Rapperswil Castle is easily accessible by boat or train. It takes less than an hour to get to Rapperswil city from Zurich's main train station and about an hour from the main station of St. Gallen.\n\nIt can be expensive to travel within Switzerland, so Rapperswil is the perfect compromise. Located in the east end of Lake Zurich, it costs less than CHF 20.- to get to by train.\n\nWhile the boat ride to Rapperswil can take a couple hours, you can combine it with a Cheese Fondue Cruise or Brunch Cruise, so you will be well-fed by the time you arrive."
