        "text": "\"I've got a model railway that runs all the way around my flat,\" says TikTok trainspotter Francis Bourgeois.\n\nThis admission will make perfect sense, and perhaps bring a grin, to the millions who follow the 23-year-old on social media.\n\nFor those less familiar, he's a unique kind of internet celebrity.\n\nHis trainspotting reaction videos, showing his uncontainable, wholesome excitement as locomotives fly by, appeared to touch people during the pandemic, with comments underneath regularly pointing to the dose of joy he provided.\n\nNow, boasting a combined five million plus followers across TikTok and Instagram, life is busy.\n\nCelebrities including singer Joe Jonas and retired footballer Thierry Henry have starred in his videos, there's a book to his name, and fashion partnerships, Gucci included. Oh, and a live onstage appearance at a Sam Fender gig.\n\nBut trains come first.\n\nBourgeois, real name Luke Nicholson, grew up in northwest London near Willesden Junction station, sparking his childhood fascination with trains. His parents didn't own a car, so he travelled to school by rail and could see railway lines from the classroom.\n\n\"I just thought everyone loved trains?\" he says earnestly.\n\nFrancis Bourgeois: A Great British Railway Adventure\n\nFrancis Bourgeois attempts to travel from the southern coast of England to the northern coast of Scotland using only British Railway rolling stock.\n\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)\n\nHis grandmother bought him his first train when he was four, which grew into a lifelong passion for model making.\n\n\"It's been the centrepiece of my railway enthusiasm throughout my life,\" he says. \"In my late teens, I had a model railway that grew and grew… at one point it took over my parents' conservatory.\"\n\nFast forward a few years, and his latest model in his flat, which travels through his bedroom and into the living room, holds special meaning. It represents the rebirth and acceptance of his passions - set free through TikTok trainspotting videos.\n\nIdentity over conformity\n\nAt age six, Bourgeois and his family left London for Somerset. As a teenager, changing schools escalated social pressure to conform, pushing trains out of first class priority. He sold or threw away his old train models and replaced them with gelled hair, gym workouts, and partying, in hope of fitting in.\n\n\"It was suppressed under the surface,\" he says. \"Now, having my model railway, the pressure has been released.\"\n\nHis TikTok trainspotting videos have taken this further, helping him both \"rediscover who I am inside\" and \"properly own\" his trainspotting passion through his famous screen identity.\n\nIronically, Francis Bourgeois' rise began from pressure to conform.\n\nIn 2021, while studying Mechanical Engineering at Nottingham University, Nicolson began posting trainspotting videos using the Francis pseudonym (inspired by artist Louise Bourgeois) to protect his employment prospects - eventually landing a fourth-year internship with Rolls-Royce.\n\nThese early videos, of course, didn't stay secret around the carmaker office for long. When the plant director mentioned the clips with a smile in passing, Bourgeois knew they had \"gone everywhere.\"\n\nIt served as a lesson. \"I wanted to form a protective bubble over that side of my life; isolate it in a way, but in doing so I realised this is what I want to be.\"\n\n\"I started to realise that it's absolutely cool to have this unique passion.\"\n\nThen lockdown happened, almost hand-in-hand with the meteoric rise of TikTok, and Bourgeois came into full view. Now he uploads almost daily. And the sense of fun remains. One early viral video showed him falling off a picnic chair in excitement as a train whizzed past.\n\nAlthough part-comedic, filmed using a go-pro strapped to his head and a distorting fisheye lens, it is the simple intense authenticity of the emotion that keeps eyes watching and his fanbase growing.\n\nAllow Instagram content?\n\nThis article contains content provided by Instagram .

It doesn't just make me laugh; it can make me cry.\n\n\"To see a huge full steam locomotive go by at 75 miles an hour - it's such a thrill,\" he says.\n\nDuring his travels, he spots a train produced by one of the last remaining UK-based train factories and meets volunteers dedicated to preserving iconic railway lines.\n\n\"For parts of our railway history to potentially disappear is sad. I want people to experience the raw beauty of the railway.\"\n\nInternet backlash\n\nBut the fame of this visceral, niche relationship has also given Bourgeois darker times.\n\nWhen pictures and videos emerged online showing his life outside trains, be it as a teen wearing different style clothes, working out at the gym, or, more recently, enjoying himself at a music festival, some on social media were quick to dismiss his TikTok identity as an inauthentic hoax.\n\nThe backlash hurt.\n\n\"In coming out of my shell with my railway enthusiasm, it felt like I was being pushed back in,\" Bourgeois says.\n\n\"Some people believe it's just a facade or a character, but what I feel when I see the trains is raw emotion, and that's what I let through on the camera, uninhibited.\n\n\"Before, at school, I had these social inhibitions. When I'm out on the railway, everything is stripped back to the raw essence of how I'm feeling.\"\n\nHe says trainspotting appeals because it offers both certainty and unpredictability, and goosebumps appear on his arms.\n\nIn a video addressing the controversy, he openly explained his past struggles to fit in at school and how he now feels confident being his true self. He says people appreciated his honesty, as they related to his experience of finding their identity in school.\n\n\"One of my friends, from the so-called cool group at school said: 'If you had told me about your model railway, I'd have told you about my Lego Star Wars!'\" Bourgeois says.\n\nOur interview comes amid ongoing conversations around how best to regulate social media. So what would his advice be for those facing online hate?\n\n\"It's not necessarily helpful to combat it directly\", he reflects. \"It's better to talk about feelings\".\n\nHe says he's spoken with his girlfriend of around six years, Amy, \"for a long time\" about the impact of social media. \"She's really helped me feel confident\", he continues.\n\n\"Now, I know what I do social media for - for me and my railway enthusiasm. I see the backlash, but I also see the people who love the videos.\"\n\nLove of electronic music\n\nOutside of trains, Bourgeois' other passion is music. I have to ask: Is it headphones in or out when travelling by train?\n\n\"It depends. Some trains sound amazing but I enjoy travelling at 125mph, immersed in sound,\" he says, listening to heavy electronica, metal like Brutus, or ambient acts like Stars of the Lid.\n\nFrancis Bourgeois' commuter playlist\n\n1.
