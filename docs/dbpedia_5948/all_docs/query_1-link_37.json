        "text": "Hi all,\n\nWe are a family with two little ones, we are considering moving from Richterswil ZH to Jona-Rapperswil SG.\n\nAny feedback on how good is their public schooling system, services, community ? changing from Kanton ZH to SG ?\n\nWe are aware of tax differences, public transportation and the obvious differences, what we are looking to hear about are the positives or negatives of the area which only a resident who been there for some time can tell ?\n\nDid not lived in Rapperswil, but it is a sleeping town of zurich, most people\n\ncommute in the morning to Zurich and return in the evening,beside the traffic\n\nshops close early (saturday afternoon at 5pm, mon-friday 6.30 pm except albuville, manor and migros mon-friday 8pm , sa 6pm).\n\nTaxes are higher then in zurich, rents are lower then in zurich , there is a triathlon every year\n\nhttp://www.rapperswil-jona.ch/de/vereine/sportanlaesse/\n\nI'll be the dissenter here and say that, were it not for the tax advantage, I'd choose Rapperswil over Zug any day.\n\nI live the other side of the Obersee so am in Rapperswil fairly often for shopping, dining or sports. It feels much more laid back to me than a lot of other lakeside towns near Zürich - lots of bars and cafés by the lake to chill out at, and as the area gets quite a few tourists, these bars and restaurants are actually open on Sundays There are a good range of sports facilities for the size including a covered ice rink just past the zoo. Decent range of shopping options. Also beautiful walks along the wooden bridge back to Pfäffikon.\n\nThanks for reading my post and replying to my actual question I did specifically write we are not interested in tax comments , I work in Zug and lived in the past in Wollerau and for the past 5 years in Richterswil , I can totally see why many people who care about quality of living chose to pay a few bucks more of tax and have a high standard of living and a sense of belonging to a community rather than a work camp area with no soul such as SZ and Zug !\n\nOur main concern was the schooling system , we noticed on credit suiss the education rating for Rapperswil-Jona is a bit lower than other areas and we were concern if this is true ! hence my post! I was trying to find out the percentage of Gymi acceptance for students in Jona (we will be moving to Kempraten), I know for example the percentage in Thalwil and Kilchberg is 40% while it`s only 6% in Adliswil ! but could not obtain this information for Jona Rapperswil"
