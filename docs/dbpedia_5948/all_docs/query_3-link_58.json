        "text": "This answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[Despite the maddening back&forth, I think it's pretty clear that she chooses Jonas. Here's how I think, in the author's mind at least, she resolved all of Elle's objections leading up to that last paragraph:\n\n1) much of Elle's appreciation for Peter has to do with his ability to rescue. She credits him with bringing her mother back from the brink and marvels at their relationship. That gives her mother's blessing to go to Jonas (paraphrased as \"you don't know if you'll regret the swim if you don't take it\") enormous persuasive weight. Wallace genuinely likes Peter, probably even better than Jonas, and she's telling Elle to follow her heart.\n\n2) part of Elle's fear of leaving Peter for Jonas revolves around her children and how it would affect them; but, at the end, she realizes that she, ultimately, cannot protect them from hurt. She's done well (already better than her mother) by surrounding them with people who genuinely love them and will be steady presences in their lives, regardless of who ends up with whom.\n\n3) and, most obviously, Elle sees Jonas waiting in the water for her, takes off her wedding ring, and goes to him. Their love scares her ... which is why she continues to try to hide from it (e.g., trying to wake up Peter for a swim instead) ... but, in the end, walking out and facing the very natural gravitational pull towards her soulmate is the necessary and brave thing to do.\n\nSTILL, I would very much have liked to read that she finally learns her lesson and tells the entire truth, her life story, to Peter, who deserves it. Because hearing and understanding it would go a long way towards making him realize that this unbreakable bond between E&J had nothing to do with anything he did or didn't do. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[Oh my goodness - I'm glad I'm not the only one. I finished the book last night at 2am and woke up thinking about that ending. I even searched the internet for more information, just looking to find some other interpretations about the ending. I was convinced (in the last few pages of the book) that she chose Peter, especially with the things she told him that last night when he confronted her about the kiss with Jonas. But then she takes her wedding ring off and goes into the pond where Jonas is waiting on the other side!! What are we to think? I did find an article with a quote from the author where she says the ending is clear if you know where to look. To those people wondering who Elle chose, \"I would refer you to the penultimate paragraph of the novel.\" I've read that paragraph ten times today ... \"I take off my wedding ring, hold it in the palm of my hand, considering it, feeling the weight of it - its worn, eternal shape, its gold-ness. I squeeze it tight against my life line one final time before leaving it behind me on the top step and heading down the path to take my swim.\" The only conclusion I can draw is that she chooses Jonas based on \"one final time before leaving it behind me...\"\n\nWhat do you think? (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[I really hated this ending. (It's obvious to me Elle leaves Peter for Jonas.) Peter and his kids are the only likable characters in this entire book, and to see Elle hurt them, just as she ostracizes her father for \"not picking\" her, made dislike Elle all the more. She is the epitome of selfish. Jonas is weak (he pined for her for years, but never once picked up the phone or even sent her a letter?), and creepy, and once he has Elle he won't want her any longer. Elle blew up her perfect life, likely damaging her kids in the process, for a few weeks of great sex. Ick. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[CONTAINS SPOILERS!!\n\nI loved this book. The writing style was unique, and having grown up on a beach in the northeast in the late 1960’s, I could relate to the time and place depicted. Frankly I wondered if MCH was someone I knew.\n\nIt was a bit hard for me to believe that Jonas and Elle could function after the tragic accident that took place when they were teenagers coming of age. Or that Jonas became a wildly successful artist, while Elle was somehow able to break the cycle of abuse and trauma and find love, motherhood and normalcy with a wonderful man for almost 20 years. But I do strongly believe that ‘first loves’ leave indelible marks and the longing that Elle and Jonas had for one another was true.\n\nPeter was safe. He was Her stability, and he was a truly loving husband and father to her children. However, she was never completely herself with him. She was waiting and expecting him to find out the truth about her (and be totally repulsed by who she really was).\n\nOn the other hand, she and Jonas understood and fully accepted one another for who they really were. Their connection was deeper since they shared secrets and a tragic accident in which they both were involved.\n\nThe Memphis trip changed everything because on some level Elle was able to finally forgive herself (and others). And once she came to terms with that she could finally be who she was; a flawed human being who was able to be honest with herself and her feelings and endless love and longing for Jonas.\n\nWho did she choose? Wallace says “Some swims are not worth the risk, But you will never really know that answer unless you try”. And oh by the way, She left her wedding band behind and took the swim to Jonas.\n\nI think the choice she made was crystal clear. Despite all the goodness she had in her life with Peter, she could no longer deny her ultimate love, physical attraction and desire, for Jonas, or her need to be 100% herself.\n\n(hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[Thanks for this question. All the answers have helped me gather my thoughts about the story and the ending. Spoilers ahead~\n\nI finished this book wondering what next???!!! This story isn't over! I wanted another chapter or epilogue to have a little closure and know how the family ended up, specifically Elle. To me it seemed that Elle couldn't decide. Her heart chose Jonas and her head chose Peter. She lived with the guilt AND shame of Conrad for so long -- the abuse and death. She navigated that, not sure how well, but she did. So she will probably navigate her guilty conscience of an affair and justify it in her head for a while. I think eventually, Peter or Jonas will decide her future. I would have liked to read about it though and hope that she can find happiness in her future. For me, The Paper Palace ended at the rising climax of the story. Maybe MCH couldn't decide and didn't want to hurt her characters anymore than they had already suffered. However, it felt like all the characters were left in Cape Cod limbo. I finished the book feeling sad for all of them.\n\nAnd to be fair to Elle, I didn't see her as likeable/unlikeable, weak/strong, good/bad... She seemed very human to me. flaws and all. She had a lot thrown at her and she was doing the best she could with the hand she was dealt. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[<spoiler>I think she chose Peter because I think Jonas is a creep and that's what I choose to believe. Also, as Sally Albright says, \"Women are very practical\". Untangling both their lives to go off with Jonas would be a horror show and Elle is smart and practical enough to know this. And, after spending her whole life watching her father choose other women over his daughters (\"he never chose us\"), I can't believe she would do that to her children. Also, Jonas is a creep. I realize that this may not be what the author would say, but it's my take.</spoiler> (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[I was completely immersed in this book; speedreading towards the conclusion of Elle's story only to find myself so disappointed by the obscure ending. My initial thought was that she chose to stay with Peter; and I felt utterly unsatisfied, but after rereading the last few pages, I think her story ends with Jonas. When she finally tells her mom that it was Conrad, not Leo, who raped her, her mom ends the conversation by telling her how much Jonas loved her, and says, \"There are some swims you do regret, Eleanor. The problem is, you never know until you take them.\" The next morning, she invites Peter to join her for her morning swim, but he turns his back and declines. When she goes outside, she sees Jonas already waiting for her, and THEN she takes her wedding ring off to head down the path towards the pond...towards Jonas. I was much happier with the ending when I felt like the path led her to Jonas, but I would have enjoyed reading about their reunion after the entire book kept them apart. A little gratification for the reader for enduring so much sadness and tragedy through most of the story! I also felt terrible for Peter in this scenario since he was such a lovely guy. But he never truly knew his wife because she never fully let him in. Either way regarding Elle's relationships, the author took us on a journey without giving a satisfying conclusion for Jonas or Peter, or her readers regardless of who Elle ended up with. Also she drank pond water. Ew. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[Her mom gives her the gift of urging her to consider “taking a swim,” and she goes swimming after that and it says “I can feel the molecules Jonas has left behind him all around me in the water. I cup my hands in the pond, put them to my mouth and drink him. In the distance lightning fractures the sky.” To me this is evident she’s thinking of him. She links him w/her swims. Also Jonas is associated with the storm.\n\nI believe she decided on Peter, wanted to pick him, but the storm/nature threw that choice out for her true destiny: Jonas. She spoons her husband but the storm happens. During the storm there’s a hummingbird flying backward which is symbolic of her going back to Jonas who she literally had a conversation with about hummingbirds flying backwards. The next morning she’s going swimming and urges Peter to come along, saying inside her head “Come with me. End this.” (I.e. “Don’t let me go meet Jonas)! Peter doesn’t. In fact he’s a sick about it. He lost at that moment. Just like he doesn’t get up with her during the storm. He doesn’t truly get her and she deserves someone who does. So in that am, she goes to swim and she’s not alone. “Across the pond a figure stands waiting hoping I can just make out his blue shirt”. Jonas! Then: “I take off my wedding ring hold it in the palm of my hand considering it, feeling the weight of it it’s worn eternal shape it’s goldness. I squeeze it tight against my lifeline one final time before leaving it behind me on the top step and heading down the path to take my swim.”\n\n(hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[I think she chose Peter. Its definitely ambiguous and I could see why you might think it was Jonas - The things her mother says, When Peter doesn't go for the swim, Jonas waiting at the lake, her taking her ring off, and her thinking about Jonas and the hummingbird story....\n\nBut this is why I think she chooses Peter: Her decision to not choose Jonas has freed her from her promise to never tell anyone what happened that day with Conrad, when she tells her mother she breaks that promise and lets go of their relationship. Peter has saved and helped heal her child self, when he attacks the 2 men who threaten her (when they meet and in their apartment later on), when he tells her to go talk to Rosemary who helps absolve her of her sin, and during several other \"small\" moments and exchanges throughout the story.\n\nI think the end is about the life you chose because you have a knowing that it was the life that is meant for you, but even that knowing cant keep a small part of you from questioning what could have been, even when your heart is entirely your partner's it's still possible for a tiny part of it to be with someone else or in a different time or a different life.\n\nI've also considered the idea of the multiverse... The idea that every time you make a choice, another version of you makes another possible choice in another, parallel, universe. If you think of it from this angle, from the point at which the author leaves us, both choices and all of the possible resulting events can exist at the same time. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[I loved the book, the writing, the characters. As I finished it though I too was unsure of who Elle chose. I ended up here to read what others thought. Elle truly loved her family and had first hand experience of her parent's unhealthy divorce and knew the pain it could cause. True, she loved Peter, but Jonas was everything to her. I felt her conflict. Leading up to the end I thought she chose Peter: \"she never knew how close to losing him she came\" -or something like that talking about Gina. Why would she press her ring to her lifeline \"one last time\"? Rereading the last chapter and the paragraph in the acknowledgements, and then some of the very beginning, I decided that she chose Jonas, I think she followed her heart. This book was ultimately about love to me, even with all the heartache and flawed characters. It's life- messy, heartbreaking but ultimately beautiful. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[I have to admit that I did not read this book word by word. Too much filler, but I did finish and I am really happy that many are confused by the ending because I was doubting my intelligence . But I think she killed herself. I don’t think she chose either man or in the end her children. I found her to be a bit of a coward and unable to take a stand, odd for this character that risked herself over the ring that Jonas gave her but she didn’t stand up against Conrad? It made no sense to me that Elle would risk rape etc to keep her mother happy? A mother that basically put her children at risk repeatedly and at best was just neglectful. That kind of loyalty made no sense to me. I found her hard to like. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[I’m a little late to the party, so I hope someone sees this. Initially, I was disappointed at the ambiguity of the ending. And then, at the suggestion of another reader, I went back and read the final day only. It was the only day in Elle’s and Jonas’s long relationship that they had sex. Yes, they had loved each other for years, but suddenly spontaneous sex, no matter how amazing, is going to be the deciding factor in blowing up your whole life and family? I don’t buy it! I do, however, believe that Elle and Jonas continued their affair and by removing her wedding ring, she was removing herself from her marriage only temporarily, relieving her of some of the guilt. Now, did anyone else find Jonas to be unlikeable? I thought he displayed obvious narcissistic characteristics - love bombing, controlling, demanding. He stopped Elle from saving Conrad, their secret binding them together forever Thoughts? (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[JONAS IT IS!\n\nI have listened to every single interview out there with the author, and it is clear that Elle chose Jonas. What surprised me is that the author did not think the ending ambiguous, and rather thought she was leaving clear cues to her readers. She also mentioned not knowing herself what Elle's choice would be right up 'til the end... and I feel this reflects in the book. Elle is desperately clinging to her life with Peter, to the safety he represents (he is mineral, her rock). Jonas IS the Back Woods (feral, a creature of the woods, skin burnished by sap and pine) - and right at the end, she gives in. The Back Woods are in her bones, Jonas is in her bones.\n\nThe author has also refers to the cues that lead us to this conclusion (\n\nThe interviews with the author point out to the symbology (the last conversation with Wallace, the feather and.... she also stated that Elle NEVER takes her jewellery out... and she said this with a big smile on her face) :) ... Speaking of cues!\n\nElle does not take \"her wedding ring off one last time\" - like some reviews suggest - insinuating she is taking her ring off one final time to be with Jonas, before picking Peter.\n\nThe book says - \"I take off my wedding ring, hold it in the palm of my hand (...). I squeeze it tight against my life line one final time before leaving it behind me (...)\". - This is a very different story. She is taking it off and parting from it, touching it and squeezing it one final time.\n\nPersonally, I'm thrilled. I fell in love with all these characters and their complexities. Elle is a beautiful, tormented, real woman. Her choice is heartbreaking. Her choice is exciting. Her choice IS LIFE. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[What about the drowning of Conrad? Why is no one talking about that? She spent her whole child hood being abused and not saying a damn word. NEVER speaking up. And then she allows Jonas to stop her from throwing a buoy when Conrad is drowning/t take it. Jonas seems to have lived his life pretty well, why was she so plagued with guilt her whole miserable life? I'm annoyed with this book. She never stood up for herself once, which is the same trait she complained about in her mother. Peter might be the only redeemable character in the whole book. Give me back my week. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[It's written to be ambiguous, but more or less we're left off at a \"hasn't really chosen yet\" phase. You, as the reader, with your unique version of Elle, Jonas, Peter are supposed to come up with your own ending and opinion. Do you think she'll stay with Peter, and does that make her a coward unable to chase her own love? Or does that make her a faithful and dutiful wife? What about if she went after Jonas?\n\nIn any case, I think Elle and the authors are both cowards. Elle has the overly melodramatic lineage of cyclical abuse engineered by the author to make the reader feel sorry for her. It's like the author is apologizing for Elle. Meanwhile, Elle is over here throwing herself a pity party. All the while, she's fucking over two men who love her dearly both literally and figuratively. If she cared for either of these two people, she'd at least try going to a therapist or walk into a confessional.\n\nNow, I would try to give the author some benefit of the doubt. She obviously paid a lot of attention to the pacing and narrative structure of the book. She's writing about cheating in her first book and unsurprisingly riddled herself with laser beams. \"laser beams\" in the context of this video. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=09e-S... (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[Elle leaves Peter, her husband. It took me some searching to find the answer, but I am almost certain it is this. The author was quoted saying to look at the penultimate (second to last) paragraph in the book for the answer to this question. In that paragraph it says that Elle removes her wedding ring, presses it to her life line one \"final\" time, and leaves it behind while she takes her \"swim\" to go to Jonas, who is waiting on the other side of the pond. The \"swim\" is a metaphor for making decisions, choosing life's paths, choices, etc., and a phrase her mother, Wallace, coined when they were talking about Elle's and Jonas' love, and the different paths one can take when deciding one's future. Clearly, if we are to look to that paragraph, she leaves Peter and her marriage behind, and chooses Jonas. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[the last two pages was confusing, but i think he stays with her husband, and the line about wedding ring, is just to imply how it is very dear to her and she just took it off for swimming. it's just everything leads to her decision to stay with her husband, if not, why would she be so scared for Peter finding out (when he caught her kissing Jonas's hand). and this book is a story of child abandonment, and i think she prefers those memory and time with her children more than anything. also when her mother asked how could she take care all of this people, as contrast to what her mom did, i think it tells a lot that this book is partly about choosing to stay. at least this is what i choose to believe. (hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[My take on it is she left both of them, she was finally free of feeling responsible for Conrad’s death based on her finding out the truth of Rosemary. She chose herself.\n\nI don’t think she goes to Jonas; Elle says to herself “She will never know how close she came to losing him.”\n\nAnd she takes off her wedding ring because she doesn’t need the protection of Peter anymore.\n\nThe Hummingbird is a metaphor for the only bird that can fly backwards and forwards, but now she is free to swim in her pond and maybe have both Jonas and Peter.\n\nI thought it was a great book, I read it in two days while I was poorly, perfect summer escapism. Sad about the sister and her mother’s abuse by the step father and sad for her mother León never came back.\n\n(hide spoiler)]\n\nThis answer contains spoilers… (view spoiler)[I enjoyed reading the book, but I was disappointed with the ending, it seemed a little abrupt.\n\nMy opinion was changing throughout the book, but in the end I was rooting for Peter. I think Peter's character is more developed than Jonas's, which creates greater empathy with the reader.\n\nIn the book there are some signs that the relationship with Peter is not perfect:\n\nNot diving with Elle.\n\nDidn't read her sister's poem.\n\nThe discussion with Elle about her son's behavior.\n\nPrograms with Wallace and the kids without Elle in the city\n\nPeter's love for Elle is more focused than from Elle to Peter.\n\nAbout Jonah's relationship with Him, it doesn't seem to me to be as too canbe the reasons for his absence for so many years or the sudden urgency of being together.\n\nUntil the last minute everything seemed to indicate that she would choose her husband, the stability of marriage, the children: she pushed away the idea of divorce from her children, the insistence with which she tries to convince Peter that there is nothing between her and Jonah, the concern of protecting her children from all dangers.\n\nWhat made Elle change her mind? The conversation with mom and the conversation with her husband? What they said was nothing new!\n\nPeter never dived with her, and her mother always made decisions with her heart. She herself suffered a lot from the separation of her parents.\n\nThe storm, the birds, and the conversations with his mother and husband, Jonas's presence do not seem strong enough to ward off his previously definite intention.\n\nWhen Elle told her she chose her husband, he seemed angry, so you can't tell how, yet he went to wait for her at the lake.\n\nAll these clues lead us to think that she matters the decision to keep Peter.\n\nThus, I think that in the final part should have been more developed the inner psychological conflict of the character to make sense of the end and understand this choice.\n\n(hide spoiler)]"
