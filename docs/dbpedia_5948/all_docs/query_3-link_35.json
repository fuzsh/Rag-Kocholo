        "text": "Biography[]\n\n(Submitted by Oracle)\n\nJonas Maliki: 1967[]\n\nJonas was born in Delhi, India to a university professor and his wife. At the tender age of three, Jonas and his family moved to London. Jonas struggled with his rather traditional parents as he embraced the counterculture of London's youth. Struggling at home, Jonas eagerly enlisted into the United Kingdom's military at the age of sixteen. It was not long after his training that he ended up being sent to Zandia.\n\nJonas Maliki: 1983 - 1993[]\n\nJonas saw all too many atrocities in his time spent in the military. He would attain the rank of corporal after specializing in demolitions and explosive ordnance disposal. While away at war, Jonas' parents were killed in the intrinsic explosion in London. He knew a great tragedy had happened before hearing the news — having sensed the psychic pain of millions suddenly torn from this world. Jonas mourned in his own way, but found the idea of world peace to be worth the horrible price paid.\n\nJonas would spend the last two years of his military contract fighting in the surviving streets of London as martial law was declared to help secure the city from the ravages of the St. Mary's Virus and rioters. When his military contract was concluded, Jonas quickly fled England — having seen the writing on the wall and having no faith in the direction of the nation's politics.\n\nJonas moved to Star City. At the time he was not sure what drew him there, but he assumed the rainy weather reminded him of what he loved about London, but with more pleasing politics. Jonas used his inheritance to put himself through school, majoring in literature. Still an Anglophile at heart, Jonas fell in love with classic English literature. Following his graduation in 1993, Jonas decided to treat himself a return trip to England, meant as a farewell tour. It was during this time that Jonas had a psionic awakening that connected his consciousness to six other persons.\n\nJonas Maliki: 1993 - Present[]\n\nAfter meeting Angelica Turing and falling in love almost instantly through their shared mental connection, Jonas cut his trip early to return home. Jonas went into the forest and had a physical rendezvous with Angelica. As the two kissed, Jonas realized his subconscious mind had drawn him to Star City though the-then dormant psychic link he had with Angelica.\n\nJonas moved into Angelica's cabin and felt it was his first true home. Though Jonas was eager to aid Angelica's research into their new sensate nature, the rest of their cluster was uncomfortable with Angelica's inquiries and the intimate relationship she had with Jonas. It was not long before the cluster shut Jonas and Angelica out — effectively making Jonas and Angelica a cluster of two. Jonas coined their cluster 'the Lacuna' as it was missing something — something they hoped to find.\n\nEager to help Angelica learn more about their sensate nature, Jonas would often travel across the globe. He found other sensates and brought back knowledge to share with Angelica, including the process for activating other sensates. Though sensates of any gender can facilitate the birth of sensates, Jonas' knowledge made him the better midwife and it was agreed Angelica would be the one awaken a new cluster of seven freshly-minted sensates.\n\nJonas bought the cluster to Angelica's cabin and used his inheritance to finance the creation of a humble commune in the forest. However, not all of Angelica's children were eager to accept their sensate nature. Todd McCarver abandoned his cluster and his sensate mother. Jonas tried to keep tabs on Todd during his travels, but one day Jonas found that Todd had simply vanished.\n\nTodd did turn up but only killing several persons and ending up in Arkham in a perpetually vegetative state. Looking into it, Jonas and Angelica discovered that Todd was the victim of the machinations of one of their own clustermates. This discovery would lead to Angelica being tortured, her children being abducted, and the birth of Angelica's second cluster of sensate children which Jonas promised to protect."
