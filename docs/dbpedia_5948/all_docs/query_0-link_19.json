        "text": "After the year 2021 without visiting my sister Florence in Zug in Switzerland, I finally returned to the Confoederatio Helvetica in March and April 2022. I stayed over a week. More than a family visit, I organised an excursion to French-speaking Switzerland, also known as Romandy, to visit Maxime and the vineyards of Lavaux in the canton of Vaud, near Lausanne. I also booked a journey on the world-famous Glacier Express from Sankt Moritz to Brig. Furthermore, I looked for a nice way in and out. The ÖBB Nightjet night train from Amsterdam to Zurich and the voyage home via Lyon in France.\n\nIt was great to be a full week in Switzerland. I first went to Zandvoort in the Netherlands and then took the night train from Amsterdam to Zurich. I did an excursion to Lausanne and Lavaux in Romandy.\n\nI visited Thun and Sankt Gallen. With the Glacier Express, the Thurbo Lake Line and the Voralpen-Express I completed some section of the Grand Train Tour of Switzerland.\n\nI was extremely lucky with very nice spring, almost summery weather. Just in the end winter and snow came back. The return was via Chamonix, Aix-les-Bains and Lyon.\n\nAnyway, it was great.\n\nAnd there’s plenty left to do and see for quite a few visits. I suppose my sister living in Switzerland helps.\n\n2022 Train Tour of Switzerland ft.
