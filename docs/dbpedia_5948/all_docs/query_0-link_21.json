        "text": "Conference Venue\n\nLocation\n\nThe Swiss Python Summit is held on the campus of the OST Campus (formerly HSR) in Rapperswil.\n\nAddress\n\nOST Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences\n\nOberseestrasse 10, 8640 Rapperswil-Jona\n\nBy Train\n\nRapperswil is a 40 minutes train ride from Zürich main station. The OST campus is located directly next to the Rapperswil train station. If you follow the southern exit you end up right on campus. For this reason we recommend the use of public transport. It's the easiest and possibly cheapest option.\n\nBy Car\n\nThere are many parking possibilities in the area. You can find more information in this PDF with a map. Limited Parking is available at OST campus (Hochschule P8), the rates are rather pricey though. The best option is probably to get a P+Rail day card and to park next to the train station (Bahnhof Rapperswil P10). An alternative would be next to the zoo (P7 Südquartier, Lido\") or near the lake (See P1).\n\nConference Room\n\nThe conference will take place in the Aula (building 4) upstairs. Or just follow the signs on campus.\n\nQuiet Room\n\nThere is a separate room for working or for relaxing. Free Wi-Fi as well as power connections are available\n\nCatering\n\nDuring the conference we offer drinks, coffee and various snacks and at the social event afterwards there will be a small buffet.\n\nAccessibility\n\nThe venue is fully accessible by wheelchair.\n\nJob Board\n\nWe are going to have a wall with open jobs. If you want to advertise an open position do print information about it on an A4 page (in portrait orientation) and we'll hang it up on the wall.\n\nAnd if you ask nicely, we may even be able to print on site for ad-hoc job postings."
