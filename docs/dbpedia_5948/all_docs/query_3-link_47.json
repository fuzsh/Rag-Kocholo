        "text": "Anything can happen in the City of Love.\n\nSophie Turner, 27, was photographed sharing a sweet smooch with Peregrine “Perry” John Dickinson Pearson — heir to the 4th Viscount Cowdray, a county in Sussex — over the weekend.\n\nIn photos obtained by Page Six, the “Game of Thrones” actress and the 29-year-old can be seen kissing in broad daylight while out and about in Paris.\n\nAfter chatting it up on a street corner, the British aristocrat grabbed onto Turner’s floor-length coat, pulling her in for a kiss.\n\nTurner, who wrapped one arm around Pearson’s waist, tried to stay incognito in an all-black outfit with a red baseball hat and dark sunglasses.\n\nMeanwhile, Pearson — whose family is reportedly worth over $270 million — wore gray jeans, a black peacoat, and a tan scarf.\n\nBefore locking lips with the blonde beauty, Pearson courteously removed his gray paperboy hat.\n\nAn eyewitness told the UK Sun earlier this week that they saw the pair at the Gare du Nord railway station “chatting and laughing a lot.”\n\n“They arrived together at the chauffeur pickup location outside of the station. It looked like they might have both come on the Eurostar from London,” the spy claimed. “He then took his hat off and leaned in to give her a big kiss. After the kiss, they parted ways.”\n\nAlthough the pair left the station in their own chauffeur-driven cars, they reunited later that night at the city’s Stade de France for the Rugby World Cup, where Turner took the field to present the trophy.\n\nWhile it’s unclear how long Turner and Pearson have known each other, the actress is notably one of his 1,000-plus followers on Instagram.\n\nFor more Page Six you love…\n\nListen to our weekly “We Hear” podcast\n\nShop our exclusive merch\n\nNews of their budding romance comes less than two months after Pearson split from King Charles III’s goddaughter, Princess Maria-Olympia of Greece and Denmark.\n\nThe exes, who started dating in 2020, sparked split rumors in July after Pearson was noticeably absent from Olympia’s 27th birthday.\n\nSimilarly, the “Joan” actress and Jonas called it quits after four years of marriage in September.\n\nDespite initial tension between the two, the exes eventually settled on a temporary agreement regarding the custody of their two daughters: Willa, 3, and 1-year-old Delphine.\n\nThey also agreed to settle their split in private, with Jonas filing to dismiss his Miami divorce case."
