        "text": "Holocaust Museum LA's proposed $45-million expansion has taken a small, but important procedural step forward.\n\nEarlier this week, the Los Angeles Department of Recreation and Parks issued a notice of exemption from the California Environmental Quality Act for the proposed Jona Goldrich Campus, which would expand upon the museum's existing subterranean building in Pan Pacific Park. The proposed project would include:\n\na new learning center;\n\na dedicated theater to showcase the USC Shoah Foundation's Dimensions in Testimony;\n\na 200-seat theater;\n\nTwo classrooms;\n\na 2,500-square-foot special exhibit space; and\n\na pavilion housing an authentic boxcar found at Majdanek death camp in Poland on top the existing museum.\n\nPlans also call for concession areas, administrative offices, and restrooms.\n\nAdditionally, the expansion would provide space to house a full-scale German transport box car.\n\nThe museum's expanded footprint would require the removal and replacement of existing trees, as well as the relocation of a Parks Department maintenance yard and infrastructure owned by the L.A. County Flood Control District.\n\nPlans for the Jona Goldrich Campus, named after the late real estate entrepreneur who was one of the museumâ€™s key supporters, comes at a time when hate crimes spiked in the United States, and with it visits to the Holocaust Museum. According to a website for the expansion, the museum has seen a 400 percent increase in attendees since 2011.\n\nThe Belzberg Architects-designed expansion is expected to increase the museum's annual capacity to 500,000 by 2030.\n\nAs of October 2021, the Los Angeles Times reported that the museum had raised nearly half of the funds needed to begin construction. A groundbreaking is expected in 2022."
