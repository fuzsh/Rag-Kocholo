        "text": "Back-to-School: Bus Stop Safety\n\nPublished on 08/28/2024 under News By this time next week, most Northwoods students will be heading back to school. Local law enforcement are reminding drivers to slow down, watch for buses and pedestrians, and obey traffic laws. Bus safety is the focus of the Wisconsin State Patrol August Law of the Month. According to the DoT, there are around 600 accidents in Wisconsin involving school buses each year. State Patrol Superintendent Tim Carnahan says, \"Kids count on their community to keep them safe as they go to and from school. Their safety must be everyone's top priority.\" State law requires vehicles approaching a bus displaying red warning lights to stop at least 20 feet from the bus and remain there until the operator turns off the lights. Violators face a fine of $326. Officials offered a few tips for motorists to remember. When you see children on their way to school slow down. Anticipate they may dart into the roadway and be prepared to stop quickly. Always yield to pedestrians, watch for special school zone speed limits, and, of course, eliminate distractions when driving. The State Patrol also encourages parents go over bus stop safety with young students before the first day of class. That can include a visit to the bus stop. They recommend children waiting for the bus stay at least 5 giant steps away from the curb. Wait until the bus comes to a complete stop, and the driver signals it's safe before approaching. If the kids have to cross the street, do so in front of the school bus, making eye contact with the bus driver. Another tip for parents, as we lose daylight in the coming weeks and months, consider jackets or backpacks that have reflective material.\n\n+ Read More DraftKings Opening Sports Book at Lake of the Torches\n\nPublished on 08/28/2024 under News Just in time for the fall professional sports seasons, a new sportsbook will be opening in northern Wisconsin.
