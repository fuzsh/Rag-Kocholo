        "text": "Rapperswil-Jona Christmas Market is among the biggest in Switzerland. It has more than 230 stands along Marktgasse, on the shores of the lake and at Fish Market Square. Hunt for the stalls selling warm drinks â€“ think mulled wine, honey and apple punch, and even a multitude of flavours of hot chocolate. Food stalls sell everything from fondue and raclette to waffles and crepes. Utterly magical is the lighting throughout the old town, where thousands of tiny lamps flicker after dark."
