        "text": "And this is why the correct PPE is so important. I wouldn't go mountain biking without the correct PPE and I wouldn't expect staff to work without the correct PPE either. If I had not been wearing a very good helmet I would not be here today to write this post. The helmet and my front wheel were both destroyed because I was overconfident in my own abilities. Luckily I was wearing a MIPS helmet because the impact twisted the helmet around my head and if I had been wearing just a normal MTB helmet I would probably not have had such a good outcome. It won't put me off mountain biking - but I shall be more conservative and careful in future (some training may also be indicated! :) ) Safety is a choice, choose wisely."
