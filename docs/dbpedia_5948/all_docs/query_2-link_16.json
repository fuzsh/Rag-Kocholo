        "text": "All you trainspotters and railway enthusiasts out there are going to love this new property recently added to the market…\n\nDent Station in Cumbria is England's highest mainline railway station – sitting at 1,150 feet above sea level – and is now on sale for offers in excess of £425,000.\n\nIt’s only the third time the Victorian property has been offered for sale since being built in 1877. The station house is located amidst breathtaking natural scenery on the Settle to Carlisle railway line and can be accessed from anywhere on the UK rail network or by road. Around five passenger trains stop at Dent daily, and the line is often used by freight trains.\n\nOwner Robin Hughes bought the former station house and platform in 2006, renovated the Grade II listed building and transformed it into a unique rural holiday home. On purchase it could continue to be this or made into a private home.\n\nMany of the property’s original features still exist, including open fireplaces, cast iron radiators and stone flagged flooring. The woodwork has been restored and finished in Midland Railway maroon and cream, while the former booking hall has been turned into a cosy living room. The original ladies’ waiting room is now a kitchen/dining area. The home also benefits from three bedrooms, new bathrooms and underfloor heating.\n\nLovers of the old vehicles of the railway will be pleased to hear steam trains run on the line at weekends with visits from the Flying Scotsman and Tornado.\n\n‘It is tremendous to hear the distant whistle of an approaching steam train; it’s a sound that transports you back to a bygone era,’ Robin said. ‘Imagine stepping outside onto the platform with a mug of tea to enjoy the pleasures of Dentdale: views, fresh air, wonderful wildlife and a real-life train set on your doorstep!’\n\nThe grounds of the home span nearly a third of an acre of land.\n\nThis property is available for offers in excess of £425,000 through joint agents J R Hopper & Co and Thomson Hayton Winkley Estate Agents.\n\nTake a tour:"
