        "text": "Credit to TZVETOZAR VINCENT IOLOV 2024-01-11 Italy and Germany will finally get a high-speed train connection | TheMayor.EU https://lnkd.in/g-gv-Qfm Italy and Germany, the two large countries sitting on both sides of the mighty Alps are finally set to get a direct high-speed train link after at the very end of 2023, the national railway operators Trenitalia and Deutsche Bahn (DB) signed an agreement to that effect. The first route, which is in the works, is a service connecting Milan and Munich, passing through Innsbruck (Austria). The first Frecciarossa journeys between Italy and Germany are scheduled for the end of 2026, and the project has been considered exciting enough to be selected by the European Commission as one of its supported initiatives for cross-border services on the continent. Apart from the Milan-Munich route, which will be the first to be offered, there is already a plan also to develop a Rome-Munich connection. It should be noted that the Frecciarossa trains will operate on the Verona-Innsbruck-Munich route at conventional speed. However, the future route will be greatly improved with sections of line rebuilt to increase speeds and, of course, thanks to the Brenner Base Tunnel itself, currently under construction on both the Italian and Austrian sides. The signed agreement underscores the expansion ambitions of Trenitalia as the Italian railway company has proven really ambitious and assertive in getting out of the Appenine Peninsula and conquering the European market. Trenitalia already offers high-speed connections within Spain (with its Iryo subsidiary) and in France, by connecting Milan to Lyon and Paris.\n\n3 million square metres made up of roughly 563 000 square metres of runways, 1.215 million square metres of taxiways and 1 million square metres of apron amongst other things. And all need to be kept snow free. ❄️✈️❄️ To keep the airport free of snow is an essential operation carried out at Swedavias airports during winter season in Sweden, and one important word to make it all work is “collaboration”. In the latest issue of Airside International, Swedavias Ali Sadeghi, chief asset officer of facilities and systems, discuss how Stockholm Arlanda Airport is kept snow free and fully operational during the winter season. The key factors are collaboration between different functions at the airport as well as having the right equipment and properly trained personnel. All while at the same time staying fossil-free in its own operation, a goal Swedavia reached by the end of 2020.

We have been working hard to expand the services available to our customers and extend our range of private flights. Despite unstable geopolitics and a downturn in the economy, we are delighted to welcome new aircraft to our fleet. Our Tampere-based(EFTP) #DiamondDA62 has proved to be the perfect choice of aircraft thanks to its performance, efficiency, and comfort. It is called \"The SUV of the sky\". 🛩 Our new DA62 operates from #Lugano, Switzerland, and serves Central and Southern European destinations. And that’s not all. 🛩 At the beginning of this year we obtained an Air Operator Certificate (AOC) in Estonia for our aircraft and crew via our partner company, Diamond Sky Aviation Group. This will enable us to sell private flights to customers who are not fractional owners in the company, although our fractional owners will retain priority when booking flights. This new service is in response to the continuous demand for flexible private flights. 🛩 Finally, our charter flight service beginning in Spring 2024 will both expand our brand visibility and increase profitability.

At times there will be a rundown of operation changes in the past 10 years, but sometimes it will be focusing on the y-o-y changes, based on certain calendar weeks. Today (13FEB24) focuses on Tromsø (Avinor Airports of Norway, Route Development), one of the fastest growing international market in The Nordics region, with nearly 137% capacity increase based on Calendar week 8 comparison of 2023 vs 2024. As one may expected, this week's AeroRoutes' daily update is done from Tromsø, and later this week in Svalbard.

Today, the decision is announced that Lisbon's new airport will be built in Alcochete on the other side of the river. It is expected to cost around 8 billion euros, roughly the same as Berlin Airport cost 10 years ago. Without a new bridge, however, the airport will have no rail connection to the capital. The Vasco da Gama Bridge already cost 1 billion euros 30 years ago. To top it all off, it has just been decided to abolish tolls on many highways: Rich Portugal has another €180 million a year to give away here. At the same time, there has been very little talk of a high-speed train connection to Madrid, Porto and Faro, as this would directly free up 20 slots in LIS and there would be no need to build a new airport for many billions.\n\n🧠🏙 𝗣𝗼𝗿𝘁𝘂𝗴𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝘀 𝗰𝗼𝗺𝗺𝗶𝘁𝘁𝗲𝗱 𝘁𝗼 𝗺𝗶𝗻𝗶𝗺𝗶𝘀𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗲𝗻𝘃𝗶𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗶𝗺𝗽𝗮𝗰𝘁 𝗼𝗳 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗽𝘂𝗯𝗹𝗶𝗰 𝘁𝗿𝗮𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗼𝗿𝘁 𝗻𝗲𝘁𝘄𝗼𝗿𝗸 𝗯𝘆 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝗶𝗻𝗻𝗼𝘃𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗺𝗼𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆 𝘀𝗼𝗹𝘂𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 𝘁𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝗺𝗮𝗸𝗲 𝗶𝘁𝘀 𝗰𝗶𝘁𝗶𝗲𝘀 𝘀𝗺𝗮𝗿𝘁𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗽𝗿𝗼𝗺𝗼𝘁𝗲 𝗰𝗶𝘁𝗶𝘇𝗲𝗻𝘀' 𝘄𝗲𝗹𝗳𝗮𝗿𝗲: 👇 🚆 Câmara Municipal de Coimbra is introducing hydrogen-powered buses and the BRT (bus rapid transit) system. This electric bus service will run on dedicated lanes and build a central station to restructure mobility in the city. 🔌 Évora will be a pioneering town in Portugal by adopting an all-electric public transport network. Thanks to the commitment of the concessionaire Trevo, this project will be possible. 🌱 In 2023, Parques Tejo revealed that the mobility sharing system in the Câmara Municipal de Oeiras recorded 144,000 journeys, preventing the emission of 60 tonnes of carbon dioxide. 🚁 The Câmara Municipal de Oeiras and the Magellan 500 Airport consortium signed a protocol to implement an Air Electric Mobility project for passenger transport.

The Travel Centers of Europe facility ensures that drivers can work and rest in good conditions. Europe is currently facing a shortage of 100,000 truck parking spaces. With only 7,000 certified safe and secure spots, IRU continues to advocate for increased funding and improved conditions. As the current budget cycle concludes in 2024, we look forward to continued support from the EU to enhance drivers' well-being and safety. Tackling chronic #drivershortages by improving working and resting conditions is crucial to our industry.
