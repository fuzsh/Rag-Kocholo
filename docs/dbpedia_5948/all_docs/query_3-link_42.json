        "text": "04/09/2024\n\nA few minor updates catch up on the sale of the Cincinnati Southern Railway to Norfolk Southern, while the history pages of the Cincinnati, Hamilton & Dayton Railroad and the Big Four Railroad to Columbus add information about reroutings in Hamilton and Franklin after the 1913 flood. I also added a link to the Grasshopper Railroad website, which details the history of the Waynesville, Port William and Jeffersonville Railroad. This was a short-lived narrow gauge railroad that ran from the Little Miami near Spring Valley Lake east towards Columbus. It eventually failed, was reorganized and converted to standard gauge as the Cincinnati, Columbus & Hocking Valley Railway, then it became the Ohio Southern Railway. The route between Cincinnati and Columbus was never completed, and it was bought out by the Detroit, Toledo & Ironton to operate as a minor branch line between Sedalia (now Midway) and Kingman, a tiny hamlet on OH-380 a mile north of the OH-73 exit off I-71. It was abandoned in the 1930s and 1940s.\n\n08/06/2023\n\nWhile I have given canals a cursory mention here as they relate to the railroads and the subway projects, they are no less obscure and are deserving of their own historical essays. Thus, I have added an extensive history of the Miami & Erie Canal, Warren County Canal, and Cincinnati Subway as a new history page along with numerous additional photos between Cincinnati and Dayton. Similarly the histories of the two former Big Four Railroad lines to the west, the Brookville subdivision and CIND subdivision have been updated with histories of the Whitewater Canal and Cincinnati & Whitewater Canal. Each of their photo galleries is also updated, especially the Brookville subdivision along the Whitewater Canal Trail through Metamora. The map is also updated to show the Warren County canal and the various hydraulic canals in the Miami Valley, along with some minor adjustments to the Miami & Erie route.\n\n01/28/2023\n\nHistory and additional photos of the Cincinnati Western Railroad have been posted. The search for the tunnel portals stalled with no timeline for picking back up. However, the information and photos that were gathered are ready for sharing.\n\n02/27/2022\n\nCatching up on some overdue photo updates, I have revised galleries of the CM&B, East Walnut Hills and O'Bryonville streetcars, and Hyde Park and Madisonville streetcars. Thanks to Anthony Wood at Tap Wood Farm for photos of old CM&B bridge abutments at Stonelick Creek, and Kerry Devery for photos of exposed rails at Madison and Kenwood in Madisonville.\n\n01/25/2022\n\nI have finally completed a major update to the history of the Cincinnati, Lawrenceburg & Aurora Electric Street Railroad. What was originally a somewhat anemic write-up has become one of the most comprehensive. While no books have been published on its history, the late Earl Clark Jr. had amassed a great deal of resources, including numerous photographs from the collection of the late Cliff Scholes, among others, that I have added to the galleries of the main line and Harrison branch. Many thanks to Bill Van Doren for loaning me Earl's research. Additional thanks go to Lou Lockwood and Robert Deffinger for providing more historical information.\n\nThe extensive CL&A updates include a revised map, which has already been online for a couple of weeks while I've ironed out performance issues and tested a new production workflow. In addition I imported a much better quality base road map for Montgomery County. Since the CL&A history is very much intertwined with that of the adjacent Big Four Railroad (now I&O CIND), I updated its history as well, including additional relevant photos. I expect to have some minor tweaks to these pages here and there, but they're now ready for publication.\n\nBackground\n\nThe growth and development of cities throughout the world is profoundly influenced by the modes of transportation available to them. Until the 19th century, walking was the only way to get around town. Horses and carriages were generally only used for traveling between cities or by the wealthy. For the vast majority of folks, walking was their main mode of travel on a daily basis. Regardless of the time and the method of transit, on average people don't spend more than about 30 minutes to get anywhere on a regular basis. This limited the size of the walking city to about two miles across. The historical center of most European cities, as well as many east coast cities in the United States, were first developed in this walking age. The centers of London, Paris, Rome, New York, Boston, and Philadelphia all grew in this time. It wasn't until the introduction of the railroads that things started to change.\n\nAt first, railroads didn't affect the size of cities much. They linked the city with the countryside, spurring the growth of country towns where farmers brought their produce to be shipped to the city by train. Here in Ohio, any town with a population over 5,000 had a railroad connection of some sort. Towns such as Loveland, Montgomery, Springdale, Sharonville, and Newtown started in this way. In the big cities though, the change was increasing industrialization of certain areas of the city where the railroads had their yards and other support facilities. With the exception of some wealthy railroad commuter suburbs like Glendale, Wyoming, Terrace Park, and 19th century Norwood, most people still had to live within walking distance of work and their everyday needs, since the railroad was too expensive to use on a daily basis.\n\nAlthough the railroads didn't start to change the growth pattern of cities significantly in themselves, with the exception of large cities with massive commuter rail networks like New York, Chicago, London, and Paris, some of the railroad's spin off technologies did change cities of all shapes and sizes. The development of steel rails and steam engines allowed for the construction of horsecar and cable car lines, as well as Cincinnati's famous inclines. These allowed more than just the very wealthy, who could afford to take a horse and carriage from neighborhoods like Clifton or East Walnut Hills to downtown, to start moving farther away from the increasingly crowded and polluted central city. It wasn't until the development of reliable electric traction motors that the spreading out of cities began in earnest.\n\nIn the late 1800's, slow and unreliable horsecar lines began converting to electric streetcars. While horsecar lines in some cities reached several miles from downtown, such as in Chicago, the topography of Cincinnati meant that they couldn't operate effectively to the hilltop communities. Cable cars work great in hilly terrain like Cincinnati and San Francisco, and even Chicago had an extensive system, but they were still slow, required extensive maintenance, and were prone to mechanical breakdowns. Electric streetcars were much faster and more reliable, so except in a few rare cases they replaced all the horsecar and cable car lines that preceded them. The streetcar systems which developed allowed cities to grow from two miles across to nearly 10 miles. Just about every neighborhood within the boundaries of the City of Cincinnati, outside of the core downtown and adjacent basin neighborhoods, grew during the streetcar's ascendancy.\n\nAt the same time, the interurbans took streetcar technology and applied it to longer-distance travel. They linked the city with the country much as the railroads had, but they provided more frequent and less expensive service. Unfortunately, just as quickly as the interurbans sprang up, they quickly disappeared due to competition from private automobiles and paved public highways. By the time of the Great Depression, most were gone. The streetcars hung on for another couple decades, but most of them disappeared by the 1950's.\n\nToday, basically all cities in the United States, and more and more around the world, are completely dependent on the automobile, and to a lesser extent the diesel bus. The many neighborhoods and towns that grew up around the streetcars, interurbans, and railroads in most cases no longer have the transportation that they were built around. They have to function in a car-oriented society, and while some have been able to survive, many of these older neighborhoods are dysfunctional in some respect if not completely failing. Few people today remember the streetcars, let alone the interurbans. Today's mainline railroads are seen more as an annoyance when a large freight train holds up traffic, and their role as the lifeblood of small towns and big cities is mostly forgotten. I hope by documenting as much of the history of these rail systems as I can, that more people will understand and appreciate the significant impact they had on the growth of not only Cincinnati, but nearly every city in the United States.\n\nOther Resources\n\nSome large cities around the country have web sites with information about former transit systems. It's not difficult to find maps, photos, detailed history, and commentary on the Chicago 'L', the New York Subway, or the Pacific Electric in Los Angeles. For smaller cities like Cincinnati, information can be pretty hard to come by. There were many very small systems in cities you wouldn't expect that are almost completely forgotten. The surface lines of Charleston, South Carolina aren't well-documented at all, and the trolley line which connected Southern Pines with Pinehurst, North Carolina is a complete mystery. Even locally, the small streetcar systems of Hamilton or Springfield have little to no available published history. Aside from a few short descriptions, photos or maps are virtually nonexistent. This is something I am trying to provide, at least for the greater Cincinnati area.\n\nMost of the information on Cincinnati's transit history is in books and journals which are inaccessible on the internet and are becoming rarer as time goes on. Wagner & Wright's Cincinnati Streetcars is an invaluable 10 volume collection that has numerous historical photographs, maps, diagrams, and general history. While some photos are distributed digitally, much of the historic information is not. Also, most of these volumes are out of print, and some can be rather difficult to find. The Cincinnati Historical Society Library in Union Terminal has all volumes, but they can't be checked out. Other information is in pamphlets and local history journals that never had much circulation outside of their home territory.\n\nInformation on the interurbans is spotty. George Hilton and John Due's The Electric Interurban Railways in America is the go-to reference for the interurban industry. It has been recently republished and is readily available. However, aside from what I have quoted in the information sections for each company, there isn't much else in that book about the specific interurbans in Cincinnati. Some books have been written on individual interurbans, however. David McNeil self-published books on the Cincinnati Georgetown & Portsmouth, Cincinnati & Columbus, the Cincinnati & Lake Erie, and the Cincinnati Milford & Blanchester. Copies can be rather difficult to find, but they are excellent resources, containing maps, pictures, history, news events, and numerous business records (especially for the CG&P). Nothing of much substance has been written specifically about the Cincinnati Lawrenceburg & Aurora, the Cincinnati & Hamilton, or the three Interurban Railway & Terminal lines. The Electric Railway Journal, a trade publication from the time of streetcar and interurban building, sometimes wrote articles about new companies, especially if they used innovative new technologies. More and more of those are being digitized and shared, though the thousand-plus page volumes can be quite cumbersome to read through, and they mainly only cover the early construction and operations, or major efforts at economizing operations.\n\nThere is an excellent book about local railroads. The Railroad and the City by Carl Condit provides very useful information about the history of all Cincinnati's railroads, and how they've affected growth throughout the region. There is also some information on the interurbans. This book was published in 1977, so it predates the post-Conrail mergers by CSX and Norfolk Southern, but it is still an excellent resource. Other railroads have been dealt with in some capacity by separate authors, such as the Cincinnati, Lebanon & Northern in John Hauck's book Narrow Gauge in Ohio, as well as the various Pennsylvania Railroad lines and some of the smaller narrow gauge systems. See the non-internet references at the bottom of this page for the full list.\n\nThe Map\n\nThe map on this site is something I put together from personal on-the-ground exploration, maps from books, libraries, or the USGS, and information from knowledgeable folks. This map does not represent the system as it would have appeared at any one point in time. It's more a map of where there have ever been streetcar, interurban, and railroad lines, as if you took all the maps ever made and overlaid them. The purpose is for those who are curious about whether there are/were tracks buried under the road they're driving on, or if the trolley poles holding up the traffic lights were actually for streetcars, or if a berm in the woods might be an old right-of-way. I have tried to differentiate between active and abandoned railroads, but I cannot be certain that lines aren't abandoned or just infrequently used. Of course, all the interurbans and streetcars are gone. Other transit infrastructure such as tunnels, major viaducts, canals, and major passenger and freight stations have also been added. Most of that information has been gathered from early 1900s USGS topographic maps. Therefore, some later changes may have been missed. While I have tried to make everything as correct as possible, I cannot make any guarantees about accuracy.\n\nPictures\n\nWhile exploring around town looking for information I took pictures of my on-site reconnaissance. There are hundreds of photos from all over the area, most starting around the year 2001. More and more pictures depict scenes that have already changed, removing traces of transit history that were once obvious. While most railroad aficionados take pictures of locomotives and other train movements, my focus is on rights-of-way, bridges, tunnels, buildings, and other examples of the physical plant. These are the things that most people see, but tend to ignore. What may be the obvious remains of a railroad line one day can be reduced to a mere memory after road construction or another building project. Someone could be living right on top of a line that was once an immensely important transit route for a community and not even know it. Photographs help bring to life some of the history that surrounds us. In more recent years I have added numerous historical photos from library archives and generous contributors.\n\nI welcome any feedback, corrections, links, pictures, or questions you have, don't hesitate to e-mail me."
