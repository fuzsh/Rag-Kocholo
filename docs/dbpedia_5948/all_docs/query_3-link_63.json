        "text": "A seasonally inspired restaurant and scratch bar that was recently boosted by some high-profile investors has opened their second New Jersey kitchen eatery as True Food Kitchen has launched at the Menlo Park Mall.\n\nSituated at 1521B US Route 1 in Edison, True Food Kitchen’s latest location boasts a specially curated menu with exclusive items plus a Monday through Friday Happy Hour that runs from 3-6 p.m. The full-service restaurant features a spacious 189-seat dining room with an open kitchen, a private dining room, a separate To-Go entrance and counter, a full-service bar, and two patio sections.\n\nThe brand was founded by integrative medicine pioneer Dr. Andrew Weil based on the belief that food can taste great and be good for you. True Food Kitchen recently brought in $100 million via new investors that include New Jersey’s own Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra.\n\nThe restaurant’s menu closely adheres to Dr. Weil’s anti-inflammatory food pyramid and features fan-favorite signature dishes like a Tuscan kale salad, an ancient grains bowl, and edamame dumplings. Dishes exclusive to the Edison location include their spin on Prince Edward Island mussels, a grilled grass-fed NY Strip, seared wild-caught tuna, roasted branzino, and a crispy potato side dish.\n\nTrue Food Kitchen’s scratch bar serves a collection of fresh-pressed juices, organic teas, and natural refreshers alongside a selection of beer, wine, and handcrafted drinks. Signature cocktails include a citrus skinny margarita along with seasonal selections like an espresso martini, hibiscus margarita, or a juniper rose.\n\nThe restaurant also offers a full brunch menu and diners at the Edison location will be able to benefit from the brand’s True Rewards loyalty program, which allows guests to earn points towards special offers every time they dine. True Food Kitchen also offers a selection of meal prep options, family meals, and to-go bundles for 4 to 6 people.\n\nAs part of an effort to combat hunger, True Food Kitchen Edison is partnering with a company called Copia. When the restaurant has a surplus of food, staff will use Copia’s app to track and submit donations to ensure that no edible food goes to waste.\n\nTrue Food Kitchen Edison is now open Monday through Thursday from 11 a.m. to 9 p.m., Friday from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Saturday from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m."
