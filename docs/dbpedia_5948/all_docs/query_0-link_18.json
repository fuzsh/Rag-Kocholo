        "text": "Ensure all work is carried out around the track.\n\nToday's resource-saving construction methods require solutions that start with the separation of the excavated material and extend to the cleaning and reprocessing of the excavated material.\n\nWith the gravel plant at the Goldach site, we have the necessary know-how and the required capacities for the implementation of innovative track substructure projects.\n\nWe also construct drainage lines, shafts or crossings from the track at short night intervals and, as a railway undertaking, use our own rolling stock for this. For efficient construction, GLEISAG provides experienced and trained personnel as well as machines adapted to the tight space conditions, which are perfectly coordinated in terms of time.\n\nWe build the appropriate foundations for a wide range of specialist areas, such as safety systems, overhead line construction and for apparatus in railway stations. With suitable machines and trolleys, foundations can be excavated, shaped and concreted in remote and hard-to-reach places.\n\nWALO's extensive range of services includes the new construction and expansion of complex station facilities to meet the wishes of customers and suppliers. From platform systems and passenger subways to P+R facilities, we offer quality and adherence to schedules. Thanks to our long railway experience, it is possible for the variable requirements to be optimally coordinated and interlinked in the interests of the railway.\n\nAs a certified railway transport company (RU), we not only offer material logistics from the road, but also via rail and provide the required shunting personnel.\n\nThe total package for all needs.\n\nWith well-trained specialist staff, we monitor and inspect installations of railway customers and industrial track owners in order to present cost-efficient and lifecycle-extending measures after in-depth analysis.\n\nOur siding contracts are composed of the two main modules monitoring and maintenance. The modular structure enables customer-specific adaptation of the respective contract.\n\nMonitoring comprises the Observation module and the Documentation and Reporting module. Depending on the load on the system or the customer's requirements, the track system is visually inspected once a year or every six months as part of an inspection. The results of this inspection are documented in an inspection and condition report. This report is supplemented by a maintenance and renewal plan with the recommended measures to ensure operational safety, long-term maintenance of the track structure and the prevention of damage to the rolling stock. All reports and measures are tracked in our construction documentation.\n\nMaintenance is divided into the modules of upkeep (maintenance work, cleaning work), repair (minor repairs, fault intervention and troubleshooting) and renewal (planned measures to maintain the value of the facilities). Maintenance is an option for the customer. At his request, we handle the necessary work quickly and without complications. In case of renewals we can offer all construction measures, including project planning, from one source. Furthermore we support the customer in the contact with the BAV (for subsidies, etc.).\n\nDue to our supra-regional presence, we can intervene quickly and competently in case of emergencies (rail breaks, etc.).\n\nWe extend the service life of your railway installations.\n\nWooden sleeper renovation, an economical solution that allows optimal track maintenance. The system can be used to extend the service life of wooden sleepers in tracks and points. Thus, it allows more time for the planning of renewal.\n\nThis renovation also allows the track width to be corrected and the height of depressed ribbed plates to be adjusted.\n\nAnother advantage of a timber sleeper renovation is the positional stability in the area of switch frogs. The measures lead to excellent mechanical properties. The system can also be used in the rain.\n\nReaching circuitous destinations on the tracks.\n\nNeed to access awkward areas effortlessly? We can now solve such problems quickly and easily, thanks to our WALOflex 50 track transport trolley. The track transport trolley is designed for standard or metre gauge. It can be used as a transport vehicle, to provide a work surface in hard-to-reach places, or as a tunnel inspection vehicle on the tracks. Due to the uniquely deep loading area of 11 metres in length and the usability with high payloads of up to 30 tonnes, the transport trolley can be optimally used to transport palletised goods, machines or bulk materials effortlessly to awkward destinations. The WALOflex 50 can be used very flexibly thanks to various attachments and locks. By means of the twist lock fastening for module systems and containers, securing the load is easy and very simple. Loading and unloading is quick and easy thanks to the hydraulically controlled ramps.\n\nWhen used as a work surface, workplace lighting, power and hydraulic connections are available to provide safety and a suitable work platform even in places with insufficient or no lighting.\n\nThe WALOflex 50 can be independently moved in and out by means of four hydraulic supports that are fully extendable.\n\nPerfect size for perfect work.\n\nThe vehicle was designed and engineered from the ground up specifically for the work of a small two-way rail grinding vehicle. The rail driving device of the two-way rail grinding vehicle has also been specifically built for rail grinding. The short wheelbase and the spreader ensure precise guidance of the grinding unit. The grinding unit consists of six independent grinding spindles, which can be individually equipped and thus adapted for fluting, reprofiling and deburring of grooved and vignole rails. The vehicle has an integrated dust extraction system. Both the drive of the grinding shafts, the rail travel device and the angle adjustment and infeed of the six grinding shafts are carried out by means of electric motors. Due to the diesel-electric operation of the vehicle with 110 kW, various parameters can be precisely set, controlled and monitored. If, for example, the speed of a sanding unit reaches the set minimum value, it is raised so that the quality of the sanding pattern can be maintained. Another advantage of the electric operating system is the absence of environmental and infrastructure damage in the event of damage caused by leaking oil. The machine is used for both standard gauge and metre gauge.\n\nPrecision and technology\n\nSince 2014, WALO has the technical approval for rail welding and bonding work on the SBB network. We offer aluminothermic welding for Vignol and grooved rails as well as electric welding (filler wire and electrodes) and build-up welding. WALO performs these works for normal gaps as well as for wide gaps or transition joints.\n\nIn the area of thermite welding, we have Elektro-Thermit GmbH & Co KG of the Goldschmidt Group as a supplier. For the Vignol rails, we switched from SmW-F to the SoW-5 process at the beginning of 2016. For the grooved rails, we rely on the SRZ welding process. We weld with disposable Eurocrucibles, which ensure clean disposal of the welding waste after use. For the insulated joints, in addition to the NS type glued joints, we also use the MT type glued joints newly approved by the SBB.\n\nEach WALO welding group is equipped with a fully equipped welding bus. The equipment includes all material and tools for both thermal and insulating joints. Three welding groups have a welding trolley on a WELAKI trailer in addition to the welding bus. Like the welding bus, the welding trolley is fully equipped for insulating butt joints and thermal butt joints. Thanks to the in-house development of the trolley by WALO's machine technology department, any adaptations and requests can be tested and implemented without long waiting times. It also has an electrostatic drive, which allows the welding group to be moved easily and independently. The new SBB requirements for brakes have already been implemented in our Rollis. The WELAKI trailer allows it to be moved flexibly on the road and to be tracked in close to construction sites or at the starting station."
