Take a taxi/ride-hailing service from the airport to Clark, about four miles.\n\nOther airports include Providence, R.I., Manchester, N.H., and Hartford, Conn., but getting to Clark from these locations is often more complicated than from the Boston or Worcester airports.\n\nGetting to Clark from Boston: The cheap but indirect route\n\nTake a train or bus to Union Station in downtown Worcester, where you will need to take a taxi or ride-hailing service to get to Clark.\n\nGetting to Clark from Boston: The direct but slightly more costly route\n\nUse a shared van/limousine service like Knights Limousine Service, to pick you up at Boston airport and bring you directly to campus. Many students use this option.\n\nBe sure to make reservations early and allow for travel time. The trip from Boston to Worcester can take more than an hour at peak travel times. This option is cheaper if you travel with a group."
