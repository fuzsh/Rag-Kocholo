They allow websites to store such things as user preferences. You can think of cookies as providing a “memory” for the website, enabling it to recognise a user and respond appropriately.\n\nAnalytics cookies:\n\nEvery time a user visits our website, web analytics software provided by a third party generates an anonymous analytics cookie.\n\nThese cookies can tell us whether or not you have visited the site before.\n\nYour browser will tell us if you have these cookies, and if you don’t, we generate new ones.\n\nThis allows us to track how many individual unique users we have, and how often they visit the site.\n\nUnless you are signed in, these cookies cannot be used to identify individuals; they are used for statistical purposes only. If you are logged in, we will also know the details you gave to us for this, such as username and email address.\n\nThird party cookies\n\nThird parties may also set their own anonymous cookies, for the purposes of tracking the success of their application, or customising the application for you. Because of how cookies work, we cannot access these cookies, nor can the third parties access the data in cookies used by us.\n\nFor example, when you share a news article using a social media sharing button on our website, the social network that has created the button will record that you have done this.\n\nHow do I turn cookies off?\n\nIt is usually possible to stop your browser accepting cookies, or to stop it accepting cookies from a particular website. For example, we cannot tell if you are signed in without using cookies, so you would not be able to place orders.\n\nAll modern browsers allow you to change your cookie settings. These settings will typically be found in the ‘options’ or ‘preferences’ menu of your browser. In order to understand these setttings, the following links may be helpful, otherwise you should use the ‘Help’ option in your browser for more details.\n\nCookie settings in Internet Explorer\n\nCookie settings in Firefox\n\nCookie settings in Chrome\n\nCookie settings in Safari\n\nIf you are primarily concerned about third party cookies generated by advertisers, you can turn these off by going to the Your Online Choices site.\n\nYou can also visit the trade body representing these advertising platforms for more information: Network Advertising Initative.\n\nThey have provided a one-stop place that gathers all of the opt-out controls. www.networkadvertising.org/choices/\n\nUseful links\n\nIf you would like to find out more about cookies and their use on the Internet, you may find the following links useful:\n\nMicrosoft Cookies guide\n\nAll About Cookies\n\nThe IAB has provided the following website to give information specifically about privacy issues around Internet advertising:\n\nyouronlinechoices.co.uk/uk\n\nFor further legal information about privacy issues, you may find these links useful:\n\nData Protection Act 1998\n\nThe Information Commissioner’s Office\n\nAll personal information given to us through this website will only be held and used in accordance with this policy, the Privacy and Electronic Communications (E.C. Directive) Regulations 2003 and the Data Protection Act 1998.\n\nInformation automatically collected and stored\n\nWe will not collect any personal information about you except where it is specifically and knowingly provided by you, for instance if you request information from us, fill in an online form or provide feedback on the website.\n\nWhen personal information is collected, it may be used by us to process and fulfil requests for information or to help us to develop or personalise the website to make it more useful to you. If you complete a form on this website, you will be told why and how we will process the personal information you submit before you submit it.\n\nCookies are small text files sent to your computer and stored by your browser. They are used to remember browsing information. Because of cookies, your web browser can remember you are logged in, whether you've visited our site before and what your preferences are.\n\nAlthough cookies contain identifying information, the cookies we use do not contain any information that identifies you personally, and they allow us to recognise your computer or mobile device when you return to our website.\n\nIt is possible to block cookies by changing the settings on your browser, but be aware that some functionality of this site may not be as rich if you do. For more information on how we use cookies, please visit our Cookies page.\n\nUse of emails\n\nIf you send us an email (e.g. to request information or provide feedback on website content), the information you provide will be used to help us gather the information requested and to respond to your message.\n\nThe Crown Estate scans emails, using automated monitoring techniques, for malicious software and unsuitable material.\n\nLinks to other websites\n\nWe may refer to, or establish relations with, other companies, organisations and public bodies that will enable you to access their websites directly from ours. Each company, organisation or public body will operate its own policy regarding the use of cookies and collection and use of information. If you have any concerns regarding the way in which your data will be used, you are advised to read the privacy statement on the relevant website.\n\nWe will try to provide you with links to high quality, reputable websites which we think will be of interest and relevance to you. However, please note that such third party websites are not under our control and we do not contribute to the content of such websites. We cannot accept responsibility for any issues arising in connection with the third party's use of your data, the website content or the services offered to you by these websites.\n\nYour rights\n\nYour personal data is protected in the UK by the Data Protection Act 1998. Under this Act, we will process personal data we hold about you in a fair and lawful manner and will keep it secure from unauthorised access by third parties.\n\nYour personal data may have to be disclosed if we are required by law or as a result of a lawful request by a governmental or law enforcement authority.\n\nIf you would like to complain to The Crown Estate, please contact us.\n\nPolicy changes\n\nAny changes to the privacy policy will be posted here and will take effect immediately."
