        "text": "I think there are a lot more support structures at Choate than I had in the past. Aside from faculty support in deans, advisers, and teachers, I’ve come to really appreciate student-to-student support. Choate was my first time experiencing peer-run support groups like the Writing Center, and many students also take advantage of the numerous student-run affinity groups. My friends and students in general are very open about discussing their challenges, and it’s helped me feel uplifted when I otherwise might have felt isolated.\n\nMy advisers and deans have always been open to having conversations when I’m feeling stressed or overloaded, and they have been instrumental in helping me work through issues. On the flip side, they’ve also been influential in advising my scheduling decisions when adding more classes or when inquiring about classes.\n\nI love getting to have time with new students during orientation days. It's during this time together with all new students, as well as the Pathways Mentoring Program mentors and mentees, that my Associate Dean and I can clearly state to all new students: \"You belong here as your whole self.\" Belonging is about accepting everyone fully, including differences and competencies.\n\nHere at Choate, we have a long-standing network of support for our students coming from abroad, helping students adjust to boarding school, and supporting students with marginalized racial identities. Our Director of Global Programs also serves as Adviser to International Students. Both new International students and new students of color can opt in to mentoring programs where they are matched with returning upper-form international students and students of color, respectively. These programs are designed to foster mentoring relationships, inclusion, and belonging throughout the whole year. In addition, all residential faculty advisers and the amazing Student Activities Team, are committed to imparting support, wisdom and FUN to students who are new to boarding school.\n\nBefore attending Choate, I did not know about the many opportunities presented to me here that I never even thought I could do. Everyone here is positive and generous, and their excitement gives me the courage to try new things.\n\nI think the brilliance of going to Choate is that I do not have to decide on one main interest. Instead, I can pursue several main interests at the same time. The multitude of interests that everyone has here is what makes the campus vibrant and unique. I really enjoy caring for my community and being a part of the Student Council. I also enjoy playing soccer, basketball; and I had the opportunity to do Crew this year, and I absolutely fell in love with the sport. Overall I get to engage in all of my interests here at Choate, and that’s what makes the experience so rewarding.\n\nBefore returning to teaching, I spent six years as an intelligence officer in the United States Navy, serving on USS ENTERPRISE, in Baghdad, and at the Pentagon. Both in the Navy and at Choate, the opportunity to be surrounded by such talented and committed people, each working diligently in pursuit of a common set of goals, is invigorating.\n\nParticularly in history and government classes, the chance to help students see how we got to where we are now is just exhilarating. With the curriculum development grants that I’ve received over the last few summers, I’ve been able to tailor the courses and assignments to areas that I know will resonate with students and colleagues, as well as designing a new course, on the history of the Quinnipiac, Wallingford, Rosemary Hall, and Choate, from scratch. That sort of structured personal engagement is central to the Choate experience and, when it works, which it usually does, it’s awesome. When it doesn’t, which is rare, there are ample avenues to improve on the experience and ensure that the students are getting the most out of their time around the table.\n\nNothing can compare to the amazing discussions that happen on this campus—on the paths after practice, in the dorms, in the dining hall, and—of course—in classrooms. When you have ten young people around a seminar table and you’re discussing—for example—the advantages and disadvantages of a separation between church and state, there is so much engagement, connection, and passion for learning that is a natural result of the diverse life experiences of our students.\n\nTo take a course on international relations with students from nine different countries—as has happened here—is unforgettable! I remember hearing a small group of girls sitting in the locker room after basketball practice one winter discussing where the “seat of the soul” was in the body according to the spiritual traditions they grew up with. Some were pointing to their heads, some to their hearts, and one to her stomach! It was so cool! These conversations don’t happen in many other contexts.\n\nThe connection between teachers and students was unlike anything I have ever experienced, and it was life-changing. Teachers weren’t just instructors, they were friends, colleagues, coaches, and neighbors.\n\nIt sounds cliche, but I encourage all new students to jump at every opportunity to be uncomfortable. I looked at Choate as a blank canvas, and was something of a “yes-man” my first year. I tried new clubs, introduced myself to new people, explored new sports, and put my fears aside and offered myself to learning and growth."
