LENIN To Vladimir Ilyich Ulyanov Dear Comrate, Will you kindly, on reading the enclosed letter, forward it—as quickly as possible—to Gapon . 1 I would have liked very much to write you about the mo¬ tives which made me write to Gapon in this way , but unfor¬ tunately I haven’t a minute to spare. I wish you all the best. Oh yes—considering you the leader of the Party without being a member of it myself , 3 and relying wholly on your tact and intelligence, I leave it you—should you for reasons of party policy find the letter inappropriate—to keep it without forwarding it on to the addressee. A. Peshkov Printed from the original: Central Party Archives, Institute of Marxism- Leninism of the C.C. C.P.S.U. (C.P.A. I.M.L.)

M. GORKY Wednesday, August 14, 1907 Dear Alexei Maximovich, We arrived here today with Meshkovsky and tomorrow we are going to Stuttgart. It is very, very important that you, too, should be there. 3 For one thing, you were appoint¬ ed officially by the G.C. (with a consultative voice). Second¬ ly, it would be very good to see you, as it may be a long time before we meet. Thirdly, it is only a matter of a day’s journey from where you are and it will last not more than a week (it is not London!). It will not be at all late if you leave on Sunday or even Monday. In short, everything is in favour of your coming. I wish you would, health permitting. Don’t miss this opportunity of seeing the international socialists at work —it is some¬ thing quite, quite different from a general acquaintance and mere chatting. The next congress will not be held for another three years. Besides, we shall never be able to dis¬ cuss all our business by mail unless we meet. In short, come without Jiail. 4 Au revoir !

GORKY January 9, 1908, Geneva Dear Al. M., My wife and I arrived here a few days ago. We both caught cold on the way. We are settling down here just anyhow, for the time being temporarily, so everything is bad. I was very glad to have your letter: it would really be fine to make a trip to Capri! I shall definitely find time one of these days to visit you. At present, unfortunately, it is impossible. We have come here with the commission to establish a newspaper: to transfer Proletary 6 here from Finland. We haven’t decided yet finally whether we shall choose Geneva or some other city. In any case we must hurry and we have our hands full with the new arrangements. It would be nice to pay you a visit in the spring or summer, when things here are well under way! What is the best time for Capri? How is your health? How do you feel? Does your work go well? I heard while passing through Berlin that you and Lunacharsky have been touring Italy 6 and, in particular, have been in Rome. Do you like Italy? Do you meet many Russians? It would be best for me to visit you when you are not engaged in anything big, so that we can wander about at leisure and chat together. Have you received my book (the first volume of collected articles for twelve years) 7 ? I asked for it to be sent to you from St. Petersburg. My very best regards to Maria Fyodorovna. Au revoir !

Write and let us know what you are working on. We count on you both as a contributor to Proletary and as a lecturer. You will not let us down, will you? Where is Gorky? I wrote to him in Capri (Villa Blaesus). I wonder whether it will reach him. Yours, Lenin Sent from Geneva to Florence V. I.

F., I received your express letter today. The idea of dropping in on you on Capri is delightfully tempting, dash it! You have painted such an attractive picture that I have definitely made up my mind to come out, and I shall try to bring my wife with me. Only I am still uncertain about the date; at present I must give all my attention to Proletary, it must be established and work got going smoothly at all costs. That will take a month or two at least. But it must be done. By the spring we shall find ourselves drinking the white wine of Capri, looking at Naples and chatting with you. Incidentally, I have begun to study Italian and, as a learner, I pounced at once on the address written by Maria Fyodorov¬ na: expresso instead of espressol Let’s have that dictionary! As for the shipment of Proletary, you have brought it on your own head by writing. You won’t be able to wriggle away from us now so easily! A heap of commissions have to be given straight away to M. F.: 1) To find the secretary of the union of steamship em¬ ployees (there must be such a union!) serving on steamers that maintain communications with Russia. 2) To find out from him where the ships come from and go to, and how often. He must arrange weekly shipments for us without fail. How much will that cost? He must find someone for us who is punctual (are there punctual men among the Italians?). Will they want an address in Russia (in Odessa, say, for delivering the newspapers or could small quantities be kept temporarily with some Italian innkeeper in Odessa? This is extremely important for us. 3) If M. F. cannot take care of this herself—making all the arrangements, finding the necessary people, instructing 19 2* them, checking, etc., let her be sure to put us in touch with this secretary—we shall then write to him directly. This thing is urgent. In two or three weeks’ time we hope to publish Proletary here and it will have to be dispatched at once. 8 Well—until we meet on Capri! Now, A. M., take care of yourself. Yours, V. Ulyanov Sent from Geneva to Capri V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, First published in 1924 Vol. 34, pp. 373-74 in Lenin Miscellany I From V. I. LENIN’S LETTER TO HIS MOTHER January 22, 1908 About Capri—as soon as I arrived I found a letter from Gorky, who very insistently invites me there. Nadya and I have made up our minds to accept that invitation and take a trip to Italy (in Capri now the narcissi are in bloom, so the Gorkys write), but not yet. All our affairs must be settled first and then we can travel.... Sent from Geneva V. I. Lenin, Collected Works , to St. Petersburg Vol. 37, p. 374 First published in 1929 in the journal Proletarskaya Revolyutsia No. 11 V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY February 2, 1908 Dear A. M., I am writing to you about two matters. Firstly, about the Semashko affair. If you do not know him personally, it is not worth while your intervening in the matter described below. If you do know him, it is worth while. L. Martov made a “statement” in the Berne Social-Demo¬ cratic newspaper to the effect that Semashko was not a dele¬ gate at the Stuttgart Congress, but merely a journalist. Not a word about his being a member of the Social-Democra¬ tic Party. This is a vile attack by a Menshevik 9 on a Bol¬ shevik who is in prison. I have already sent my official state¬ ment as the representative of the R.S.D.L.P. in the Interna¬ tional Bureau. 10 If you know Semashko personally, or knew him in Nizhni-Novgorod, you should write without fail to the same newspaper saying that you are shocked at Martov’s statement, that you are personally acquainted with Se¬ mashko as a Social-Democrat, and that you are sure that he is not implicated in the affairs inflated by the internation¬ al police. I am quoting below the newspaper’s address and the full text of Martov’s statement, which M. F. will translate for you. Write to the editors yourself in Russian, and ask M. F. to append a German transla¬ tion. The second matter. All three of us have come together here now, having been sent from Russia to establish Proletary (Bogdanov, I and one “Praktik” 11 ). Everything is in running order, in a day or two we shall publish an announcement. You are on our list of contributors. Drop us a line as to whether you could give us something for the first issues (something after the manner of your “notes on philistinism” 12 22 in Novaya Zhizn , 13 or fragments from a story 14 you are writing, etc,). All the very best. Best regards to M. F.! Yours, V. Ulyanov The following was published in Berner Tagwacht (address of the editorial office: Kapellenstrasse 6, Bern. Social- Democratic organ) No. 24, January 30, 1908. “Erklarung. In einigen Zeitungen stand zu lesen, dass der unlangst in Genf verhaftete D-r Semaschko ein Delegierter der Genfer Gruppe der russischen Sozialdemokratie in Stuttgart gewesen sei. Dem gegen- iiber erklare ich, dass D-r Semaschko nicht Mitglied der russischen Section auf dem genannten Kongresse war und kein Delegiertenmandat besessen hat. Er war dort nur als Journalist tatig. “L. Martoff, Delegierter der russischen Sozialdemokratie auf dem Stuttgarter Kongress.”* That’s all. The disgusting thing about it is that Social- Democracy indirectly, as it were, shakes the dust off its feet, and repudiates Semashko! Sent from Geneva to Capri First published in 1924 in Lenin Miscellany I V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 34, pp. 377 78 * “Statement. Some newspapers reported that Dr. Semashko, recently arrested in Geneva, was a delegate in Stuttgart of the Russian Social-Democratic group in Geneva. In contradiction to this, I declare that Dr. Semashko was not a member of the Russian section at the said Congress and had no delegate’s mandate. He was there only in the capacity of journalist. “L. Martoff, delegate of Russian Social-Democracy at the Stutt¬ gart Congress .”—Ed V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY February 7, 1908 Dear A. M., I shall consult A. A. about your statement; since you did not know him personally I think it is not worth while pub¬ lishing it. 15 To what Bolshevik symposium have you sent the article on cynicism? 16 I am puzzled, because people write to me a good deal about Bolshevik symposia, but I have never heard of this one. I hope it is to the St. Petersburg one. Send me a copy of your letter to Sienkiewicz, 17 if you have one (in¬ dicating when it was sent)—but Sienkiewicz will no doubt publish it since it is an opinion poll. Your plans are very interesting and I should like to come. But, you will agree, I cannot very well throw up the Party job, which needs organising immediately. It is difficult to get a new job going. I can’t throw it up. We shall have it going in about a couple of months or so, and then I shall be free to tear myself away for a week or two. I agree with you a thousand times about the need for systematically combating political decadence, renegadism, whining, and so forth. I do not think that there would be any disagreement between us about “society” and the “youth”. The significance of the intellectuals in our Party is declining; news comes from all sides that the intelligentsia is fleeing the Party. And a good riddance to these scoundrels. The Party is purging itself from petty-bourgeois dross. The workers are having a bigger say in things. The role of the worker-professionals is increasing. All this is wonderful, and I am sure that your “kicks” must be understood in the same sense. Now—how are we to exert influence, what exactly should our literature be? Symposia or Proletary ? Of course, the easier thing is to reply: not or, but and ,—the reply will be irreproachable but of little practical value. We must have 24 legal symposia, of course; our comrades in St. Petersburg are working on them by the sweat of the brow, and I, too, have been working on them after London, while sitting in Kwakalla. 18 If possible, all efforts should be made to support them and continue these symposia. But my experience from London up to November 1907 (half a year!) has convinced me that no systematic legal literature can now be produced. I am convinced that what the Party now needs is a regular political organ, consistently and vigorously pursuing a policy of struggle against disin¬ tegration and despondency—a Party organ, a political newspaper. Many people in Russia do not believe in a foreign-based organ. But this is an error, and our collegium knew what it was doing when it decided to transfer Proletary here. That it is difficult to organise, set it up and run it— goes without saying. But it has to be done and it will be done. Why shouldn’t literary criticism be included in it? Too little space? I don’t know, of course, your system of working. Unfortunately, when we have met, we spent more time chattering than talking business. If you don’t like writing small, short, periodical (weekly or fortnightly) articles, if you prefer to work on big things—then, of course, I would not advise you to interrupt it. It will be of greater benefit! If, however, you are inclined towards joint work in a political newspaper—why not continue and make a regular feature of the genre which you began with “Notes on Philis¬ tinism” in Novaya Zhizn, and began very well, in my opinion? I wrote to you about this “with an ulterior motive” in one of the first letters, thinking: if it appeals to him, he will seize on the idea. And it seems to me that in your last letter you are seizing on it after a fashion. Or am I mistaken? How great would be the gain, both for Party work through the newspaper, which would not be so one-sided as it pre¬ viously was, and for literary work, which would be more closely linked with Party work, with systematic, continuous influence on the Party! There should be not “forays”, but a solid onslaught all along the line, without stops or gaps; Bolshevik Social-Democrats should not only attack all kinds of duffers piecemeal, but should conquer all and everything as the Japanese conquered Manchuria from the Russians. Of the three subjects that you mention for the symposia (philosophy, literary criticism, and current tactics) one- and-a-half would go into the political newspaper, into 25 Proletary , viz.: current tactics and a good half of the lite¬ rary criticism. Ah, there is nothing good about all those special, long articles of literary criticism scattered through various semi-Party and non-Party periodicals! We should try to take a step away from this old, intellectualist, stuffed shirt manner, that is, we should link literary criticism, too, more closely with Party work, with Party leadership. That is what the adult Social-Democratic Parties in Europe are doing. That is what we should do, too, without being afraid of the difficulties of the first steps of collective news¬ paper activity in this field. Large works of literary criticism—in books, partially in periodicals. Systematic, periodic articles, in the concert of a political newspaper, linked with Party work, in the spirit of what was begun by Novaya Zhizn —tell me, have you any incli¬ nation towards this, or not? The third subject is philosophy. I am fully aware of my unpreparedness in this sphere, which prevents me from speaking about it in public. But, as a rank-and-file Marxist, I read attentively our Party philosophers, I read attentively the empirio-monist Bogdanov and the empirio-critics Baza¬ rov, Lunacharsky, etc. 10 —and they drive me to give all my sympathy to Plekhanov ! It takes physical strength to keep oneself from being carried away by the mood, as Plekhanov does! His tactics are the height of ineptitude and baseness. In philosophy, however, he upholds the right cause. I am for materialism against “empirio-” etc. Can, and should, philosophy be linked with the trend of Party work? With Bolshevism? I think this should not be done at the present time. Let our Party philosophers put in some more work on theory for a while, let them dispute and ... seek a meeting of minds. For the time being, I would stand for such philosophical disputes as those between mate¬ rialists and “empirios” being separated from integral Party work. I look forward to your reply, meanwhile I must conclude. Yours, Lenin Sent from Geneva to Capri V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, First published in 1934 Vol. 34, pp. 379-82 in Lenin Miscellany XXVI V. I. LENIN TO A. V. LUNACHARSKY To A nat. Vas. February 13, 1908 Dear An. Vas., Yesterday I sent you a short note about Bringmann. I hasten to reply to your letter of February 11. I don’t quite understand why you should feel hurt by my letter. Not on account of philosophy, surely! Your plan for a section of belles-lettres in Proletary and for having A. M. run it is an excellent one, and pleases me exceedingly. I have in fact been dreaming of making the literature and criticism, section a permanent feature in Pro¬ letary and having A. M. to run it. But I was afraid , terribly afraid of making the proposal outright, as I do not know the nature of A. M.’s work (and his work-bent). If a man is busy with an important work, and if this work would suffer from him being torn away for minor things, such as a newspaper, and journalism, then it would be foolish and criminal to disturb and interrupt him! That is something I very well understand and feel. Being on the spot, you will know best, dear An. Vas. If you consider that A. M.’s work will not suffer by his being harnessed to regular Party work (and the Party work will gain a great deal from this!), then try to arrange it. Proletary No. 21 will come out on February 13 (26). So there is still time. It is desirable to have the manuscripts by Friday , which will give us plenty of time to put them in the issue which comes out on Wednesday. If it’s some¬ thing urgent we could manage it even if the copy arrives on Sunday (to avoid delay, write and send it directly to my address), or even (in an extreme case!) on Monday. ^ou, too, must write without fail. Won’t you send us for No. 21 either a political article on Russian affairs (10,000- B',000 characters) or an article on Ferri’s resignation 20 27 (8,000-10,000 characters)? Better still, not “either...or”, but “both...and”. I send you my best regards and ask you to reply whether A. M.’s contribution to Proletary is being arranged. If it is, let him begin at once, without waiting for the “meeting” 21 and an agreement. Sent from Geneva to Capri V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, _. , , , . , no . Vol. 34, pp. 383-84 First published in 1924 in Lenin Miscellany I V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY February 13, 1908 Dear Al. M., I think that some of the questions you raise about our differences of opinion are a sheer misunderstanding. Never, of course, have I thought of “chasing away the intelligentsia” as the silly syndicalists do, or of denying its necessity for the workers’ movement. There can be no divergence between us on any of these questions; of that I am quite sure, and since we cannot get together at the moment, we must start work together at once. At work we shall best of all find a common language. I am very, very pleased with your plan of writing short paragraphs for Proletary (the announcement has been sent to you). Naturally, if you are working on something big, do not break it off. Regarding Trotsky, I wanted to reply last time, but I forgot. We (i.e., the editorial board of Proletary , Al. Al., myself and “Inok”—a very good colleague from the home Bolsheviks) decided straight away to invite him on to Proletary. We wrote him a letter, proposing and outlining a theme. By general agreement we signed it the “Editorial Board of Proletary ”, so as to put the matter on a more col¬ legial footing (I personally, for example, had had a big fight with Trotsky, a regular fierce battle in 1903-05 when he was a Menshevik). Whether there was something in the form of our letter that offended Trotsky, I do not know, but lie sent us a letter, not written by him: “On Comrade Trotsky’s instructions” the editorial board of Proletary was informed that he refused to write, he was too busy. In my opinion, this is mere posturising. At the London Congress, 22 too, he acted the poseur. I don’t know really whether he will go with the Bolsheviks.... 29 The Mensheviks here have issued an announcement about the monthly Golos S otsial-Demokrata 23 over the signatures of Plekhanov, Axelrod, Dan, Martov and Martynov. I shall get it and send it to you. The struggle may become sharper. But Trotsky wants to stand “above the contending fac¬ tions”.... It is in regard to materialism as a world outlook that I think I disagree with you in substance. Not the “materialist conception of history” (our “empirios” 24 do not deny that), but philosophical materialism. That the Anglo-Saxons and Germans owed their philistinism to “materialism”, and the Romance peoples their anarchism, is something I emphati¬ cally dispute. Materialism, as a philosophy, was everywhere pushed into the background by them. Neue Zeit , 25 that most sober and well-informed organ, is indifferent to philosophy, was never a zealous supporter of philosophical materialism, and of late has been publishing the empirio-critics without a single reservation. It is wrong, absolutely wrong to think that dead philistinism could be deduced from the material¬ ism which Marx and Engels taught! All the philistine trends in Social-Democracy are most of all at war with philosophical materialism, they lean towards Kant, neo- Kantianism, the critical philosophy. No, the philosophy which Engels substantiated in Anti-Diihring keeps philisti¬ nism at an arm’s length, Plekhanov does harm to this philos¬ ophy by linking the struggle here with the factional struggle, but after all no Russian Social-Democrat ought to confuse the present Plekhanov with the old Plekhanov. Al. Al. has just now left me. I shall communicate with him again about the “meeting”. If you insist—it could be arranged for a couple of days and very soon at that. All the best, Lenin Sent from Geneva to Capri First published in 1924 in Lenin Miscellany I V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 34, pp. 385-86 V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY 25.11.1908 Dear A. M., I did not answer your letter immediately because, strange as it may seem at first glance, we had quite a serious fight on the editorial board with Al. Al. 20 over your article, or rather in a certain connection with it. Ahem, ahem I spoke not in that place and not on that subject which you thought! It happened like this. The book, Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism, 21 has considerably sharpened the old differences among the Bol¬ sheviks on questions of philosophy, I do not consider myself sufficiently competent on these questions to rush into print. But I have always followed our Party debates on philosophy very closely, beginning with Plekhanov’s struggle against Mikhailovsky and Co. in the late eighties and up to 1895, then his struggle against the Kantians from 1898 onwards (here I not only followed it, but participated in it to some extent, as a member of the Zarya 2S editorial board since 1900), and, finally, his struggle against the empirio-crit- ics and Co. I have been following Bogdanov’s writings on philosophy since his energeticist book, The Historical View of Nature , which I studied during my stay in Siberia. For Bogdanov, this position was merely a transition to other philosophical views. I became personally acquainted with him in 1904, when we immediately gave each other presents—I, my Steps 29 he, one of his current philosophical works. 30 And I at once (in the spring or the early summer of 1904) wrote to him in Paris from Geneva that his writings strongly con¬ vinced me that his views were wrong and as strongly con¬ vinced me that those of Plekhanov were correct. 31 When we worked together, Plekhanov and I often discussed Bogdanov. Plekhanov explained the fallacy of Bogdanov’s views to me, but he did not think the deviation a terribly serious one. I remember perfectly well that in the summer of 1903 Plekhanov and I, as representatives of the Zarya editorial board, had a conversation in Geneva with a del¬ egate from the editors of the symposium Outlines of a Realistic World Outlook , 31 at which we agreed to contribute— I, on the agrarian question, Plekhanov on anti-Machist philosophy. Plekhanov made it a condition of his collabo¬ ration that he would write against Mach, a condition that the symposium delegate readily accepted. Plekhanov at that time regarded Bogdanov as an ally in the fight against revisionism, but an ally who erred in following Ostwald and, later on, Mach. In the summer and autumn of 1904, Bogdanov and I reached a complete agreement, as Bolsheviks , and formed the tacit bloc, which tacitly ruled out philosophy as a neutral field, that existed all through the revolution and enabled us in that revolution to carry out together the tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy ( = Bolshevism), which, I am profoundly convinced, were the only correct tactics. There was little opportunity to engage in philosophy in the heat of the revolution. Bogdanov wrote another piece in prison at the beginning of 1906—the third issue of Empirio- monism, I believe. He presented it to me in the summer of 1906, and I sat down to study it. After reading it I was furious. It became clearer to me than ever that he was on an absolutely wrong track, not the Marxist track. I there¬ upon wrote him a “declaration of love”, a letter on philosophy taking up three notebooks. I explained to him that I was just an ordinary Marxist in philosophy, but that it was precisely his lucid, popular, and splendidly written works that had finally convinced me that he was essentially wrong and that Plekhanov was right. I showed these notebooks to some friends (including Lunacharsky) and thought of publishing them under the title “Notes of an Ordinary Marx¬ ist on Philosophy”, but I never got round to it. I am sorry now that I did not have them published at the moment. I wrote to St. Petersburg the other day to have these notebooks hunted out and forwarded to me. 32 Now the Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism have appea¬ red. I have read all the articles except Suvorov’s (I am reading 32 it now), and every article made me furiously indignant. ]\\o, no, this is not Marxism! Our empirio-critics, empirio- nronists, and empirio-symbolists are floundering in a bog. To try to persuade the reader that “belief” in the reality of the external world is “mysticism” (Bazarov); to confuse in the most disgraceful manner materialism jvith Kantianism (Bazarov and Bogdanov); to preach a variety of agnosticism (empirio-criticism) and idealism (empirio-monism); to teach the workers “religious atheism” and “worship” of the higher human potentialities (Lunacharsky); to declare Engels’s teaching on dialectics to be mysticism (Berman); to draw from the stinking well of some French “positivists” or other, of agnostics or metaphysicians, the devil take them, with their “symbolic theory of cognition” (Yushkevich)! No, really, it’s too much. To he sure, we ordinary Marxists are not well up in philosophy, hut why insult us by serving this stuff up to us as the philosophy of Marxism! I would rather let myself be drawn and quartered than consent to collaborate in an organ or body that preaches such things. I felt a renewed interest in my “Notes of an Ordinary Marx¬ ist on Philosophy” and I began to write them, 33 but to Al. Al., in the process of reading the Studies, I gave my impressions bluntly and sharply, of course. But what has your article got to do with it, you will ask? It has this to do with it: just at a time when these differences of opinion among the Bolsheviks threaten to become par¬ ticularly acute, you are obviously beginning to expound the views of one trend in your article for Proletary. I do not know, of course, what you would have made of it, taken as a whole. Besides, I believe that an artist can glean much that is useful to him from philosophy of all kinds. Finally, I absolutely agree with the view that in matters that concern the art of writing you are the best judge, and that in deriv¬ ing this kind of views both from your artistic experience and from philosophy, even if idealistic philosophy, you can arrive at conclusions that will be of tremendous benefit to the workers’ party. All that is true; nevertheless Proletary must remain absolutely neutral towards all our divergencies in philosophy and not give the reader the slightest grounds for associating the Bolsheviks, as a trend, as a tactical line of the revolutionary wing of the Bussian Social-Demo¬ crats, with empirio-criticism or empirio-monism. 3-0844 33 When, after reading and re-reading your article, I told A. A. that I was against its publication, he grew as black as a thundercloud. The threat of a split was in the air. Yesterday our editorial trio held a special meeting to discuss the matter. A stupid trick on the part of Neue Zeit came unexpectedly to our rescue. In its issue No. 20, an unknown translator published Bogdanov’s article on Mach, and blurted out in a foreword that the differences between Plekhanov and Bogdanov had a tendency, among Russian Social-Democracy, to become a factional disagreement between the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks. The fool, whether man or woman, who wrote this foreword succeeded in uniting us. We agreed at once that an announcement of our neutrality was now essential in the very next issue of Proletary. This was perfectly in keeping with my own frame of mind after the appearance of the Studies. A statement was drawn up, unanimously endorsed, and tomorrow it will appear in issue No. 21 of Proletary , which will be forwarded to you. As regards your article, it was decided to postpone the matter, explain the situation to you in letters from each of Proletary's three editors, and hasten my and Bogdanov’s trip to see you. And so you will be receiving a letter also from Al. Al. and from the third editor, about whom I wrote you previously. I consider it necessary to give you my opinion quite frankly. Some sort of fight among the Bolsheviks on the question of philosophy I regard now as quite unavoidable. It would be stupid, however, to split on this. We formed a bloc in order to secure the adoption of definite tactics in the workers’ party. We have been pursuing these tactics up to now without disagreement (the only difference of opinion was on the boycott of the Third Duma, 34 but that, first, was never so sharp among us as to lead to even a hint of a split, and, secondly, it never corresponded to the disagreement between the materialists and the Machists, for the Machist Bazarov, for example, was with me in opposing the boycott and wrote a long article on this in Proletary). To hinder the application of the tactics of revolutionary Social-Democracy in the workers’ party for the sake of dis¬ putes on the question of materialism or Machism, would be, in my opinion, unpardonable folly. We ought to fight over philosophy in such a way that Proletary and the Bol- 34 sheviks, as a faction of the party, would not be affected by it. And that is quite possible. And you, I think, ought to help in this. You can help by contributing to Proletary on neutral questions (that is, unconnected with philosophy) of literary criticism, publi¬ cism, belles lettres, and so on. As for your article, if you wish to prevent a split and help to localise the new fight— you should rewrite it, and everything that even indirectly bears on Bogdanov’s philosophy should be placed somewhere else. You have other mediums, thank God, besides Proletary. Everything that is not connected with Bogdanov’s philo¬ sophy—and the bulk of your article is not connected with it—you could set out in a series of articles for Proletary. Any other attitude on your part, that is, a refusal to rewrite the article or to collaborate with Proletary would, in my opinion, unavoidably tend to aggravate the conflict among the Bolsheviks, make it difficult to localise the new fight, and weaken the vital cause, so essential practically and politically, of revolutionary Social-Democracy in Russia. That is my opinion. I have told you all my thoughts and am now looking forward to your reply. We intended to go to you today, but find that we have to postpone our visit for not less than a week, perhaps two or three weeks. With very best regards, Yours, N. Lenin Sent from Geneva to Capri First published in 1924 in Lenin Miscellany I V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 13, pp. 448-54 3 » V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY Dear A. M., It’s a long time since I wrote to you. Our trip is being constantly put off: the main obstacle at present is the lack of news from Brussels. My friends wrote to me from there that I am expected at a meeting of the Bureau (International Socialist). I asked the secretary when I should come 35 (be¬ cause, I said, I had to go to Italy). There's still no reply. But I mustn’t miss Brussels. Have you received Proletary ? What are your intentions about it, then? And what about An. Vas.? It was with regret that I got his refusal to write about the Commune. Innokentiy is our third editor. Drop me a line about what plans you and An. Vas. have for Proletary.

LENIN TO A. M. GORKY March 16, 1908 Dear A. M., It’s a pity I can’t manage to go and see you. A reply has come from Brussels and here there is no delay. But there is no money and no time, and I cannot abandon the news¬ paper. Judging from the fact that you own a nanny-goat, I see that you are in a good humour, the right frame of mind, and life is normal with you. With us things are going none too well. We are pretty much at loggerheads with Al. Al. over this philosophy. I am neglecting the newspaper because of my hard bout of philosophy: one day 1 read one of the em- pirio-critics and swear like a fishwife, next day I read another and swear still worse. And Innokenty scolds me—and quite right too—for neglecting Proletary. Things are not running smoothly. Ah, well, it’s only natural. Things will come right. It would be fine if you could manage to write for Proletary without your major works suffering. With warm greetings and best regards to A. Vas. and Maria Fyodorovna. Y ours, Lenin Sent from Geneva to Capri V. I. Lenin, Collected Works , First published in 1924 Vo1 ' 34 ’ p ’ 387 in Lenin Miscellany I V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY To A. M., private March 24, 1908 Dear A. M., I have received your letter concerning my fight with the Machists. I quite understand and respect your feelings and I ought to say that I get something similar from my St. Pe¬ tersburg friends, but I am very deeply convinced that you are mistaken. You must understand—and you will, of course—that once a Party man has become convinced that a certain doctrine is grossly fallacious and harmful , he is obliged to come out against it. I would not be kicking up a row if I were not absolutely convinced (and I am becoming more and more convinced of this every day as I study the original sources of wisdom of Bazarov, Bogdanov and Co.) that their book is ridiculous, harmful, philistine, fideist—the whole of it , from beginning to end, from branch to root, to Mach and Avenarius. Plekhanov, at bottom, is entirely right in being against them, only he is unable or unwilling or too lazy to say so concretely, in detail, simply, without unnecessarily frightening his readers with philosophical nuances. And at all costs I shall say it in my own way. What kind of “reconciliation” can there be here, dear A. M.? Why, it is ludicrous even to mention it. A fight is absolutely inevitable. And Party people should devote their efforts not to slurring it over, putting it off or dodging it, but to ensuring that essential Party wmrk does not suffer in practice. That is what you should be concerned about, and nine-tenths of the Bolsheviks in Russia will help you in this and heartily thank you for it. flow is this to be done? By “neutrality”? No. There cannot and will not be any neutrality on such an issue. If it is 38 possible to speak of neutrality, it can only be in a relative sense: we must separate all this fight from the faction. So far, you have been writing “from the outside”, keeping away from the factional publications; go on writing in this way. Only so will the faction not be committed, not be involved, not be compelled tomorrow or the day after to decide , to vote, i.e., to turn the fight into a chronic, protracted, hopeless affair. That is why I am against allowing any kind of philosophy in the journal. 36 I know I am being abused for this: he wants to stop other people’s mouths, while he has not yet opened his own! But just think it over coolly. A journal with philosophy. No. 1—three articles of Bazarov, Bogdanov and Lunacharsky against Plekhanov. One article of mine saying that Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism — Berdayevism and reactionary clericalism. No. 2—three times three keyed up articles of Bogdanov, Bazarov and Lunacharsky against Plekhanov and Lenin. One article of mine, proving from another angle that Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism = reactionary clericalism. No. 3—howling and cursing. I could write six or a dozen articles against Studies in the Philosophy of Marxism, one article against each author and each aspect of his views. Can this drag on in this way? How long? Will this not make a split inevitable through endless exacerbation and embitterment? Will this not bind the faction to make a decision: decide, analyse, and end the “discussion” by a vote.... Think this over carefully, if you fear a split. Will the practical workers undertake to distribute books with such a “fight”? Isn’t another way better: go on writing as before, outside the factional publications. Do your scrapping on the side, for the time being the faction can wait. If there is a chance of weakening the inevitable animosity, it can only be in this way, I think. You write: the Mensheviks will gain from a fight. You are mistaken, deeply mistaken, A. M.! They will gain if the Bolshevik faction does not dissociate itself from the philosophy of the three Bolsheviks. In that case, they will definitely win. But if the philosophical fight goes on outside the faction, the Mensheviks will be definitely reduced to a political line and that will be the death of them. 39 I say: separate the fight from the faction. Of course, such a separation, on living persons, is rather difficult and pain¬ ful. It needs time. It needs solicitous comrades. Here the practical workers will help, here you should help, here it is a question of “psychology”, and you know best. I think you could help a lot here—provided that, on reading my book against the Studies , 37 you don’t become as furious against me as I became against them. As regards the journal, think it over carefully and answer me soon. I am a little doubtful whether it is worth while for us to make the journey to you together at present. Why jangle nerves unnecessarily? Why draw out the torture ... there is no avoiding a fight. Would it not be better to settle this business of the journal simply, without long negotia¬ tions and ceremonial and futile meetings. I am merely putting questions to you in order to consult you. Best regards to M.F. I shall most certainly come to Capri and try to bring my wife along, only I should like to do this independently of the philosophical fight. All the very best, Yours, Lenin P.S.

I can neither abandon the paper nor get away from my work. But this is only a delay, 1 shall come all the same. What do you think of “ Proletary ”? It is an uncared-for waif.

GORKY April 16, 1908 Dear Al. M., Today I received your letter and hasten to reply. It is useless and harmful for me to come: I cannot and will not talk to people who are preaching the union of scientific socialism and religion. The time for notebooks is past. It’s no use arguing, and it’s stupid to jangle one’s nerves for nothing. Philosophy must be separated from Party (factional) affairs: the decision of the Bolshevik Centre makes this obligatory. I have already sent to be printed the most formal declara¬ tion of war. 38 There is no longer any room for diplomacy here—of course, I am speaking of diplomacy not in the bad sense, but in the good sense of the word. “Good” diplomacy on your part, dear A. M. (if you, too, have not come to believe in God), should consist in separat¬ ing our joint (i.e., including myself) affairs from philosophy. A talk on other matter than philosophy won’t come off now: it would be unnatural. Incidentally, if these other matters, not philosophical, but Proletary matters, for example, really demand talks just now, and at your place, I could come (I don’t know whether I shall find the money: there are difficulties at present), but I repeat: only on con¬ dition that I do not speak about philosophy or religion. And I definitely intend coming to have a talk with you when I am free and through with my work. All the very best, Yours, Lenin Best regards to M. F.: she is not for God, by any chance, is she?

M., I have received the telegram from you and M. F. and am sending my refusal today or tomorrow morning. I repeat, on no account is it permissible to mix the disputes of writers about philosophy with a Party (i.e., factional) matter. I have already written about this to An. Vas. 39 and to avoid any misinterpretations or incorrect conclusions from my refusal to come I repeat it for all the comrades. We should continue to conduct our factional work harmoniously: none of us has regretted the policy which we pursued and imple¬ mented at the time of the revolution. Hence, it is our duty to defend it before the Party. We can only do this all together, and we should do it in Proletary and in all Party work. If, in the course of it, A should inveigh against B, or B inveigh against A, on account of philosophy, we must do this as a thing apart, that is, without interfering with the work. I shouldn’t like you and the comrades to put a bad construction on my refusal to come. I am very sorry, but the whole situation and the state of the editorial board prevent my coming. All the very best, Yours, Lenin We are expecting to receive the promised article about the Rome strike from An. Vas. as soon as possible. We are expecting help for Proletary from all writers: we are all answerable to our comrades in Russia, who are dissatisfied with it. 43 Let Al. Al. concern himself seriously about money!

ANDREYEVA Dear Maria Fyodorovna, I enclose a letter from our librarian 40 to A. M. The thing is this. I want very much A. M. to write a legal open letter to the Russian papers, asking assistance for the Kuklin Library in Geneva by the dispatch to it of newspapers of the period of the revolution and material on its history. A very short letter explaining to the general public why assistance to the library is also important for the work both of Gorky himself and of many other literary men he knows. I would ask you to arrange to have the letter hectographed (I hope Zinovy Alexeyevich 41 will not refuse to help in this) and sent to all Russian newspapers and journals of a more or less decent trend.

I asked them to write to Anyuta, if anything turns up, through our mutual acquaintance who works at Znaniye. 45 I hope for very little from Znaniye itself; the “boss” there, 46 who gave Anyuta a half promise, is an old fox and will probably go back on it after sniffing at the atmosphere on Capri, where Gorky lives.

GORKY’S LETTER TO K. P. PYATNITSKY 47 As regards publication of Lenin’s book, I am against this, because I know the author. He is one of the cleverest of men, a wonderful man, but he is a fighter, and a chival¬ rous act will make him laugh. Should Znaniye publish this book he will say: silly fools—and those silly fools will be Bogdanov, myself, Bazarov and Lunacharsky.... The argument that has flared up between Lenin and Plekhanov on the one hand, and between Bogdanov, and Bazarov & Co., on the other, is very important and profound. The first two, while divided on questions of tactics, both profess and preach historic fatalism; the opposite side preaches the philosophy of activity. It is clear to me on which side the truth lies.... Written prior to November 9, 1908 First published in 1958 in V. I. Lenin i A. M. Gorky , 1st ed. Printed from a typewritten copy received from K. P. Pyatnitsky’s private archives (A. M. Gorky archives) V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY November 16, 1909 Dear Alexei Maximovich, 1 have been fully convinced all the time that you and Comrade Mikhail were the most hardened factionalists of the new faction, with whom it would be silly of me to try and talk in a friendly way. Today for the first time I met Comrade Mikhail, and had a heart-to-heart chat with him both about affairs and about you, and I perceived that I had been cruelly mistaken. Believe me, the philosopher Hegel was right: life proceeds by contradictions, and living contradic¬ tions are so much richer, more varied and deeper in content than they may seem at hrsl sight to a man’s mind. I regarded the school as merely the centre of a new faction. 48 This has turned out to be wrong—not in the sense that it was not the centre of a new faction (the school was this centre and is so at the present time), but in the sense that this was incom¬ plete, not the whole truth. Subjectively, certain people made such a centre out of the school, objectively, it was such, but in addition the school drew to it real front-rank workers from real working-class life. What happened was that, besides the contradiction between the old and the new faction, a contradiction developed on Capri, between some of the Social-Democratic intellectuals and the workers from Russia, who will bring Social-Democracy on to the true path at all costs and whatever happens, and who will do so despite all the squabbling and dissension abroad, despite the “incidents”, and so on and so forth. People like Mikhail are a guarantee of it. Moreover, it turned out that a contradiction developed in the school between elements of the Capri Social-Democratic intelligentsia. 1 gathered from Mikhail that you are taking things hard, dear A. M. You have seen the working class and Social-Dem- 48 ocratic movement from an aspect and in forms and mani¬ festations which already more than once in the history of Russia and Western Europe have led intellectuals of little faith to despair of the workers’ movement and Social-De¬ mocracy. I am confident that this will not happen in your case, and after my talk with Mikhail I want to shake your hand heartily. With your gifts as an artist you have rendered such a tremendous service to the working-class movement of Russia—and indeed not only of Russia—and will render a still greater service yet, that it is on no account permis¬ sible for you to fall a prey to moods of depression evoked hy episodes of the struggle abroad. Conditions occur when the course of the working-class movement inevitably gives rise to this struggle abroad, and to splits, dissension and the quarrelling among the circles—but this is not because of the workers’ movement being intrinsically weak or Social- Democracy intrinsically erroneous, but because the elements out of which the working class has to forge its Party are too heterogeneous and diverse in calibre. The working class will forge it in any case, it will forge an excellent revolu¬ tionary Social-Democratic Party in Russia, and it will do so more speedily than sometimes seems likely from the standpoint of the thrice-accursed emigrant position; it will forge it more surely than might be imagined if one were to judge by some external manifestations and individual episodes. People like Mikhail are a guarantee of that. All the very best to you and to Maria Fyodorovna. I am now hopeful that we shall meet again and not as enemies. Yours, Lenin Wl.

GORKY’S LETTER TO V. I. LENIN 49 I tell you what, dear man. Come down here while the school has not ended, take a look at the workers, talk with them. They aren’t many, but they are worth your coming. To spurn them would be a mistake, more than a mistake. There are very serious men among them, and at any rate more normal than Mikhail and the others. And their heads are screwed on proper. Once more, don’t spurn them. Have a display of temper among yourselves—that’s your affair, but don’t touch them.... Written after November 16, 1909 Sent from Capri to Paris First published in 1958 in V. I. Lenin i A. M. Gorky, 1st ed. Printed from the author¬ ised typewritten copy (C.P.A. I.M.L. of the C.C. C.P.S.U.) V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY Dear A. M., You are wrong in asking me to come over. Why should I be slanging Maximov, Lunacharsky, etc.? You yourself write about keeping at loggerheads strictly among ourselves and yet you invite us to do the same in public. It’s no model. And about repelling the workers, you are wrong there too. If they accept our invitation and call on us, we shall have a chat with them and fight for the views of a certain news¬ paper , 50 which certain factionalists are abusing (I heard this long ago from Lyadov and others) as being a deadly bore, a semi-literate and useless paper which does not believe in the proletariat or socialism. As regards a new split, your arguments don’t hang to¬ gether. On the one hand, both are nihilists (and “Slav anar¬ chists”—why, my dear man, the non-Slav Europeans at times like ours fought, cursed and split a hundred times worse than we do!)—and, on the other hand, the split will be not less deep than that between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks. If it is a question of the “nihilism” of the “loggerheads”, of the semi-literacy, etc., of someone who does not believe in what he writes, etc.—then, the split is not deep or it is not a split at all. And if the split is deeper than that between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks—then it is not a question of nihilism, not a question of writers who do not believe in what they write. It doesn’t hold water, really! You are wrong about the present split and justly* say: “I understand people but not their deeds.” * An addition “justly”: I make a reservation. Without under¬ standing their deeds one cannot understand people either, unless it be ... outwardly. That is to say, it is possible to understand the psychol- 51 4 * What strikes you and Maximov in Proletary as insincerity and futility, etc., is due to a totally different viewpoint on the entire present moment (and, of course, on Marxism). We have been marking time for almost two years now tor¬ turing questions which still seem “disputable” to Maximov, but which events decided long ago. And if we were to con¬ tinue “disputing” about them, we would still be vainly marking time. But, by parting company, we shall show the workers clearly, directly and definitely, two ways out. The Social-Democratic workers will make their choice easily and swiftly, for the tactics of preserving (in storage cans) the revolutionary words of 1905-06 instead of applying the revolutionary method to a new, different situation, to a changed epoch, which demands different methods and differ¬ ent forms of organisation—these tactics are dead. The proletariat is moving towards revolution and will come to it, but not in the way it did prior to 1905. To one who “be¬ lieves” that the proletariat will make it, hut who does not understand this “not in the way”—to him our position is hound to seem insincere, futile, tedious, based on lack of faith in the proletariat and socialism, etc., etc. The diver¬ gence resulting from this is, undoubtedly, deep enough to make a split—at least abroad—inevitable. But it does not come anywhere near the split between the Bolsheviks and Mensheviks, if one is to speak of the depth of the split in the Party, in Social-Democracy, among Marxists. You are surprised that I fail to see Mikhail’s hysteria, lack of discipline (it is not for you to say, nor for Mikhail to listen) and other bad qualities. Well, I have had a little opportunity of testing him: I thought that nothing would come of a conversation between you and me, that there was no sense in writing. Under the impression of my talk with Mikhail, I wrote at once, in the heat of the moment, without even reading through the letter, without putting it oil until the next day. The next day I thought: I have been foolish enough to believe Mikhail. But it turned out that for all his enthusiasm Mikhail was right to some extent, ogy of one or other participant of a struggle, but not the meaning of the struggle, not its party and political significance. 52 for we did have our talk, you and I—not without hitches, of course, and not without Proletary being annihilated, but that can’t he helped! Written not earlier than November 20, 1909 Pent from Paris to Capri First published in 1924 in Krasnaya Gazeta No. 236 All the very best, N. Lenin V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 34, pp. 405-06 V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY To Al. Max. April 11, 1910 Dear A. M., I did not receive the letter from you and M. F. sent through M. S. Botkina until today. Before I forget: you can write to me at my private address (Oulianoff, 4, Rue Marie Rose, 4, Paris, XIV) and at the address of the Party—in which case it is safer to use two envelopes, the inner one marked: for Lenin, private (110, Avenue d’Orleans, Mr. Kotliarenko, Paris, XIV). I shall try and send you tomorrow the publications you ask for. Did I criticise you, and where? It must have been in Diskussionny Listok No. 1 (published as a supplement to the C.O.). 51 I am sending you a copy. If this is not what your informants had in mind, then I don’t remember any¬ thing else at the moment. I wrote nothing else during that period. Now about unity. You ask: is this a fact or an anecdote? I shall have to go back a long way to tell you about this, for there is something both “anecdotal” (rather trivial) about this fact, and something serious, in my view. There have been deep and serious factors leading to Party unity: in the ideological field—the need to purge Social- Democracy from liquidationism and otzovism; 52 in the practical field—the terribly difficult plight of the Party and of all Social-Democratic work, and the coming to matu¬ rity of a new type of Social-Democratic, worker. At the C.C. plenum 53 (the “long plenum”—three weeks of agony, all nerves were on edge, the devil to pay!) to these serious and deep-lying factors, which were by no means generally recognised, were added minor, petty factors — a mood of “conciliation in general” (without any clear idea with whom, for what, and how); hatred of the Bolshevik Centre for its implacable ideological struggle; squabbling on the part of the Mensheviks, who were spoiling for a fight, and as a result—an infant covered with blisters. And so we have to suffer. Either—at best—we cut open the'blisters, let out the pus, and cure and rear the infant. Or, at worst—the infant dies. Then we shall be childless for a while (that is, we shall re-establish the Bolshevik faction) and then give birth to a more healthy infant. Among the Mensheviks, those working for serious unity are the Plekhanovites (not quite consciously, rather slowly and waveringly, but they are nevertheless working for it, and, what is most important, they cannot help working for it), the pro-Party-ists 5 * and the workers. The Golos peo¬ ple, 65 however, are fencing, causing confusion and making mischief. They are building up a strong, legal, opportunist centre in Russia (Potresov & Co. in the press: see Nasha Zarya 58 No. 2—what a scoundrel this Potresov is!—and Mikhail, Roman, Yury -f- the sixteen authors of the “Open Letter” in No. 19/20 of Golos 57 — in practical, organisational work). The C.C. plenum wanted to unite everyone. Now the Golos people drop out. This abscess must be removed. It cannot be done without squabbling, rows, nervous strain, mud and “scum”. We are just now in the thick of this squabbling. Either the C.C. in Russia lops off the Golos supporters by removing them from important bodies (such as the Central Organ, etc.)—or our faction will have to be re-established. In No. 11 of Dnevnik, 58 Plekhanov has given an appraisal of the plenum which clearly shows that the sincere and serious desire to fight opportunism now prevails with him over the minor, petty desire to utilise the Golos opportunists against the Bolsheviks. Here, too, things take a complex and protracted course, but the Mensheviks’ legalistic, liquidationist centre that has been built up in Russia will inevitably lead to serious Social-Democrats turning away from them. Now about the Vperyodists. 69 At one time it seemed to me that within this group, too, there were two trends: towards the Party and Marxism, towards renouncing Mach¬ ism and otzovism, and the opposite. As far as the first trend is concerned, Party unity would enable the patent 55 absurdities of otzovism, etc., to be corrected in a convenient and unembarrassing Party way. But, apparently, the second trend is getting the upper hand among them. Alexin- sky (a mere babe-in-arms in politics, but one who has turned angry and is committing one stupidity after another) kicked up a row and resigned from both the editorial board of Diskussionny Listok and from the Party’s School Com¬ mittee. They will probably organise a school of their own, again a factional one, again on the side. If they do, we shall light again and win the workers away from them. And so it works out, that in the matter of unity the “anec¬ dotic” predominates at the present time, is brought into high focus, gives occasion for sniggering and sneering, etc. It is said that the Socialist-Revolutionary 60 Chernov has even written a farce about unity among the Social-Democrats entitled “A Storm in a Tea-cup”, and that this farce will be performed here in a day or two before one of the groups of the emigrant colony, who are addicted to sensationalism. It is sickening to be stuck in the midst of this “anecdotic” situation, this squabbling and row-making, nervous strain and “scum”; to observe all this is also sickening. But one should not allow oneself to succumb to the mood. Life in exile is now a hundred times harder than it was before the revolution. Life in exile and squabbling are inseparable. But the squabbling will pass away; nine-tenths of it remains abroad; it is an accessory feature. The development of the Party, the development of the Social-Democratic movement goes forward despite all the devilish difficulties of the present situation. The purging of the Social-Democra¬ tic Party from its dangerous “deviations”, from liquidation- ism and otzovism goes forward steadfastly; within the framework of unity it has progressed considerably farther than before. As a matter of fact, we had finished with otzo¬ vism ideologically before the plenum. We had not finished with liquidationism at that time; the Mensheviks succeeded temporarily in hiding the snake, but now it has been dragged out into broad daylight, now everyone sees it, now we shall kill it! And this purging is by no means only an “ideological” task, a labour of armchair workers as that fool (or rogue) Potresov thinks, who stands up for the Machists the way the Mensheviks at the plenum stood up for the Vperyodists. No, this purge is inseparably bound up with the mass work- 56 ing-class movement, which learns how to organise Social Democratic work in the present difficult period, learns precisely by rejection, finds the right path by rejecting liquidationism and otzovism. Only that windbag Trotsky imagines that this rejection can be avoided, that it is super¬ fluous, that it does not concern the workers, that the issues of liquidationism and otzovism have been posed not by life itself, but by the wicked polemicists. I can imagine how distressing the sight of this painful growth of the new Social-Democratic movement must be to those who have not seen and lived through its painful growth in the late eighties and early nineties. At that time such Social-Democrats were to be counted by the score, if not in individuals. Now there are hundreds and thousands of them. Hence the crisis and crises. And the Social-Democra¬ tic movement as a whole is coping with them openly and will overcome them honestly. All the very best, Yours, Lenin Sent from Paris to Capri V. I.

Sent from Pornic (France) V. I. Lenin, Collected Works. to Capri Vol. 43, p. 252 First published in 1958 in the journal Teatr No. 4 L V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY November 14, 1910 Dear A. M., There lias been no news from you and M. F. for a very long time. I have been looking forward eagerly to news from Capri. What’s wrong? Surely you don’t keep count of letters as some people are said to keep count of visits. Everything here is as of old. A host of trivial affairs and all kinds of trouble connected with the struggle of the various “dominions” inside the Party. Brrr!... It must be nice on Capri.... By way of relaxation from the squabbling we have taken up the old plan of publishing Rabochaya Gazeta. rA With difficulty we raised 400 francs. Yesterday No. 1 came out at last. I am sending you a copy together with a leaflet and a subscription list. Members of the Capri-Neapolitan colony who sympathise with such an enterprise (and with the “rapprochement” between the Bolsheviks and Plekhanov) are invited to afford every assistance. Rabochaya Gazeta is necessary, but we can’t make a go of it with Trotsky, who is intriguing in favour of the liquidators and the otzovists and Vperyod supporters. Already in Copenhagen Plekhanov and I protested vigorously against Trotsky’s despicable article in Vorwarts. 65 And what a disgusting article he has published in Neue Zeit. too, on the historical significance of the struggle among the Russian Social-Democrats! And Lunacharsky’s in the Belgian Le Peuple 66 —have you seen it? We are setting up a small legal periodical 87 to combat Nasha Zarya and Zhizn 68 —this, too, with Plekhanov’s par¬ ticipation. We hope to issue No. 1 soon. And so we jog along. Little by little, hard and slowly we are making headway, extricating ourselves from the squab¬ bles. 60 What is the news with you? Did you write to Stroyev and what reply did you receive? We wrote a first letter to' him to “make contact”; he received it and replied that he did not understand who was writing. We wrote again. Not a word. There’s a terrible shortage of the right people, and lhe old ones have dispersed. Arrangements were on the point of completion in St. Petersburg for putting out a weekly newspaper together with the Duma group (the Mensheviks there fortunately incline not towards the liquidators, hut towards Plekhanov), but the matter has been held up again, the devil knows why. 69 Write how you are getting on. Is your work going well? Has anything come of the journal we talked about in the summer? How are things with Znaniye? I have the right to be cross with M. F. She promised to write. Nothing has come. She promised to find out about the Paris library on the history of the Russian revolution. Nothing has come. That’s bad. All the best, Yours, Lenin Tria’s report will, probably, be published after all. The editorial board of the C.O. decided this. But the squabbling on that editorial board—ye gods!... Sent from Paris to Capri V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, First published in 1930 VoL 34 ’ pp ' 432-33 in Lenin Miscellany XIII V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY November 22, 1910 Dear A. M., I wrote you a few days ago when sending Rabochaya Gazeta , and asked what had come of the journal we talked about in the summer and about which you promised to write to me. I see in ifec/i 70 today a notice about Sovremennik , 71 pub¬ lished “with the closest and exclusive (that is what is printed! illiterately, but so much the more pretentiously and signif¬ icantly) participation of Amfiteatrov” and with you as a regular contributor. What is this? How does it happen? A “large monthly” journal, with sections on “politics, science, history, social life”—why, this is something quite different from symposia aiming at a concentration of the best forces of belles-lettres. Such a journal should either have a perfectly definite, serious and consistent trend, or it will inevitably disgrace itself and those taking part in it. Vestnik Yevropy 72 has a trend— a poor, watery, worthless trend—but one which serves a definite element, certain sections of the bourgeoisie, and which also unites definite circles of the professorate and officialdom, and the so-called intelligentsia from among the “respectable” (or rather, would-be respectable) liberals. Russkaya Mysl 73 has a trend, an odious trend, but one which performs a very good service for the counter-revolutionary liberal bourgeoisie. Russkoye Bogatstvo 74 has a trend — a Narodnik, Narodnik-Cadet 75 trend—but one which has kept its line for scores of years, and which serves definite sections of the population. Sovremenny Mir 76 has a trend — often Menshevik-Cadet trend (at present with a leaning towards pro-Party Menshevism)—but a trend. A journal without a trend is an absurdity, a ridiculous, scandalous 62 and harmful thing. And what sort of trend can there be with the “exclusive participation” of Amfiteatrov? One cannot expect H. Lopatin to provide a trend, and if the talk (said also to have got into the newspapers) is true about Kachorovsky’s participation, then that is a “trend”, but a trend of the blockheads, an S.R. trend. During our talk in the summer when I told you that I had all but written you a disappointed letter about Confessions but did not send it because of the split with the Machists which had begun at that time, you replied: “ it's a pity you did not send it”. Then you went on to reproach me for not going to the Capri school, and you said that, if matters had taken a different course, the breakaway of the Machists and otzovists might have cost you less nervous strain, less waste of energy. Recalling these talks, I have now decided to write to you without putting it off and without waiting for any verification, while the impression the news has made is still fresh. I think that a political and economic monthly with the exclusive participation of Amfiteatrov is something many times worse than a special Machist-otzovist faction. What was and still is bad about this faction is that the ideological trend deviated and still deviates from Marxism, from Social-Democracy, without, however, going so far as a break with Marxism, and only creating confusion. Amfiteatrov’s journal (his Krasnoye Znamya 77 did well to die when it did!) is a political act, a political enterprise in which there is not even a realisation that a general “left¬ ism” is not enough for a policy, that after 1905 78 to talk seriously about politics without making clear one’s attitude towards Marxism and Social-Democracy is out of the ques¬ tion, impossible, inconceivable. Things are turning out bad. It’s saddening. Yours, Lenin To M. F.— salut et fraternite. Sent from Paris to Capri First published in 1924 in Lenin Miscellany I V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 34, pp. 434-35 A. M. GOHKY TO A. V. AMFITEATROV Dear Alexander Valentinovich, The Notice concerning Sovremennik states, “Published with the closest and exclusive participation of A. Amfiteat¬ rov”—this is hardly literate, and further on in bold type: '‘with regular contributions by Maxim Gorky”. This is no good. Will you please tell them to be sure to have the bold type removed, and the “regular contributions” 79 too—this is essential! I want my name to be printed in line with those of the other contributors, I insist on this. And I have never signed my things with the name Maxim — always M. Gorky. It’s quite possible that this “M” conceals a Merodach, a Methuselah or a Mrakobes.* Forgive me, but I ask you most earnestly to meet my wishes! Most earnestly! A.

AMFITEATROV My dear Alexander Valentinovich, That funereal notice has appeared again in Rech for December 1 (14, New Style) and again I protest against the bold type and “regular contributions”. That burial notice is a great nuisance. Written after December 18, 1910 Printed from M. Gorky, First published in Collected Works , M. Gorky. Materialy i Vol. 29, p. 147, Russ. ed. issledovaniya, Vol. I G5 V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY January 3, 1911 Dear A. M., I have long been intending to reply to your letter but intensification of the squabbling* here (a hundred thousand devils take it!) distracted me. But I should like to have a chat with you. First of all, before I forget: Tria has been arrested to¬ gether with Jordania and Ramishvili. It is reported as being true. A pity, for he is a good chap. A revolutionary. Regarding Sovremennik. In Rech today I read the con¬ tents of the first issue and I am cursing and swearing. Vodo¬ vozov on Muromtsev ... Kolosov on Mikhailovsky, Lopatin “Not ours”, etc. You can’t help swearing. And here are you, teasing as it were: “realism, democracy, activity”. Do you think these are good words? They are bad words used by all the bourgeois tricksters in the world, from the Cadets and S.R.s in our country to Briand or Millerand here, Lloyd George in Britain, etc. The words are bad, turgid, and they carry an S.R.-Cadet message. It’s not good. As regards Tolstoi, I fully share your opinion that hypoc¬ rites and rogues will make a saint of him. Plekhanov, too, was infuriated by all the lying and sycophancy around Tolstoi, and in here we see eye to eye. He criticises Nasha Zarya for it in the C.O. (the next issue), 80 and I am doing so in Mysl (No. 1 arrived today. Congratulate us on our own little journal in Moscow, a Marxist one. This has been a happy day for us). Zvezda No. I 81 (it appeared on December 16 in St. Petersburg) also contains a good article by Plekhanov with a trivial comment, for which we have already scolded * That rascal Trotsky is uniting the Golosists and Vperyodists against us. It is war! the editors. 82 It was probably concocted by that ninny Yordansky, together with Bonch! But how come Sovremennik to combat the “legend about Tolstoi and his religion”. Is it Vodovozov with Lopatin? You must be joking. That they have started hitting out at the students is, in my opinion, comforting, but Tolstoi must not be allowed to get away with either “passivism” or anarchism or Naro- dism or religion. As regards quixotism in the international policy of Social-Democracy, I think, you are wrong. It is the revi¬ sionists who have long been asserting that colonial policy is progressive, that it implants capitalism and that therefore it is senseless to “accuse it of greed and cruelty”, for “without these qualities” capitalism is “hamstrung”. It would be quixotism and whining if Social-Democrats were to tell the workers that there could be salvation some¬ where apart from the development of capitalism, not through the development of capitalism. But we do not say this. We say: capital devours you, will devour the Persians, will devour everyone and go on devouring until you over¬ throw it. That is the truth. And we do not forget to add: except through the growth of capitalism there is no guarantee of victory over it. Marxists do not defend a single reactionary measure, such as banning trusts, restricting trade, etc. But to each his own. Let Khomyakovs and Co. build railways across Persia, let them send Lyakhovs, but the job of the Marxists is to expose them to the workers. If it devours, say the Marxists, if it strangles, fight back. Resistance to colonial policy and international plunder by means of organising the proletariat, by means of defending freedom for the proletarian struggle, does not retard the development of capitalism but accelerates it, forcing it to resort to more civilised, technically higher methods of capitalism. There is capitalism and capitalism. There is Black-Hundred-Octobrist capitalism 83 and Narodnik (“real¬ istic, democratic”, full of “activity”) capitalism. The more we expose capitalism before the workers for its “greed and cruelty”, the more difficult is it for capitalism of the first order to persist, the more surely is it bound to pass into capitalism of the second order. And this just suits us, this just suits the proletariat. You think I have fallen into a contradiction? In the be- 67 5 * ginning of the letter I considered the words “realism, de¬ mocracy, activity” bad words, and now I find them good? There is no contradiction here; what is bad for the prole¬ tariat is good for the bourgeois. The Germans have an exemplary journal of the opportun¬ ists: Sozialistische Monatshefle. There gentlemen like Schippel and Bernstein have long been attacking the international policy of the revolutionary Social-Democrats by raising an outcry that this policy resembles the “lamentations of compassionate” people. That, brother, is a trick of opportun¬ ist swindlers. Ask for this journal to be sent to you from Naples and have their articles translated if you are interest¬ ed in international politics. You probably have such opportunists in Italy too, only there are no Marxists in Italy, that’s what makes her so nasty. The international proletariat is pressing capitalism in two ways: by converting Octobrist capitalism into democrat¬ ic capitalism and, because it drives Octobrist capitalism away from itself, by transplanting this capitalism to the savages. This, however, enlarges the basis of capitalism and brings its death nearer. There is practically no Octobrist capitalism left in Western Europe; practically all capital¬ ism is democratic. Octobrist capitalism has gone from Britain and France to Russia and Asia. The Russian revo¬ lution and the revolutions in Asia=the struggle for ousting Octobrist capitalism and replacing it by democratic capi¬ talism. And democratic capitalism =the last of its kind. It has no next stage to go on to. The next stage is its death. What do you think of Zvezda and Mysll The former is dull, in my opinion. But the latter is all ours and I am delight¬ ed with it. I’m afraid they’ll soon close it down, though. I was wondering whether you could arrange for my book on the agrarian question to go to Znaniye. Talk it over with Pyatnitsky. I just can’t find a publisher, not for love or money. Reading your postscript: “my hands are shaking and freezing” makes me indignant. What wretched houses you have on Capri! It’s a disgrace, really! Even we here have central heating; and your “hands are freezing”. You must revolt. All the very best, Yours, Lenin 68 J r I have received from Bologna an invitation to come to the school there (20 workers). 1 have turned it down. 84 I don’t want to have anything to do with the Vperyodists. We’re trying again to get the workers to come here. Sent from Paris to Capri First published in 1924 in Lenin Miscellany I V. I. Lenin, Collected Works, Vol. 34, pp. 437-40 V. I. LENIN TO A. M. GORKY Dear A. M., How is your health? M. F. wrote that you had returned with a cough, etc. I hope you are better. We’ve had some bad luck with Mysl. You probably know what has happened from Rech and other papers. 85 We have to transfer the whole business to St. Petersburg, and begin all over again. But we have no legal and reliable people. Could you help us, if you sympathise with Mysl ? Or perhaps Pyatnitsky could help? As things are, we still have enough money to publish such a small journal (provided, of course, that we all work for nothing and pay outsiders 20 rubles a sheet! Not so generous, you see). So at present it is only technical help that is needed: to find a publisher who, without spending a kopek of his own, would bring out the journal (and we so strongly recognise the strictest legality, that we give the right both to the publisher and to the sec¬ retary of the editorial board-)- a lawyer to hold up anything in the least dangerous; we brought out four issues without the slightest fault-finding from the court. No. 5 was confis¬ cated on account of Kautsky! 88 That was obviously a mere pretext. There was nothing illegal in Kautsky). Why should not Pyatnitsky or someone else help us in such a safe business? If it is impossible to find a publisher, what about a secretary, a legal person whom we would pay 50 rubles a month for worrying about the printing press and forwarding. All we want is an honest and thoughtful person. The trouble is that we have no legal people, except workmen (and they won’t do). The second question. We have a translation of Kautsky’s latest articles against Maslov, which has already been paid for. 87 It’s quite legal. It’s an essential thing, because 70 Maslov has written a lot of nonsense and has also lied to his Russian readers. It’s 3-5 printed sheets. Could it be published—without author’s fees (for our translation has already been paid for) at cost price? Is Pyatnitsky (or some¬ one else) suitable for anything like this or not? The third question. Y. M. Nakhamkis, deported here from St. Petersburg for his connections with the Social- Democratic Duma group (he is Nevzorov or Steklov, author of a good book about Chernyshevsky), is badly in need of work and asks me to inquire whether it would be possible to publish Peary: A Journey to the North Pole. He thinks it will have a good sale. What news is there of the “plans”? Please write. And do reply to the workers at our school. 88 They are good fellows. One of them is a poet, and keeps writing verses, but the poor chap has no guide, helper, instructor or adviser. Best wishes. Yours, Lenin Robert E. Peary: La decouverte du pole nord. Paris—magnificent illustra¬ tions. The blocks can be bought here cheaply. About 15 printed sheets, each of 40,000 letters and spaces. (I have just seen Steklov, who gave me these details.)

GORKY May 27, 1911 Dear A. M., A few days ago I received a letter from Poletayev. He writes, inter alia: “We have received a letter from Gorky, He is proposing that N. I. should come abroad to work out a plan for unity around some organ, and adds that he has spoken to you about this and to the Menshevik M.” (Martov, I assume). Poletayev adds that N. I. is hardly suitable for this plan and that if somebody must come, it should be somebody else. It is hardly likely that Pokrovsky will make the journey. Reading this in Poletayev’s letter frightened me—no, really. Our uniting with Mensheviks like Martov is absolutely hopeless, as I told you here. If we start arranging a meeting for such a hopeless plan—the result will be nothing but a disgrace (personally I would not go even to a meeting with Martov). Judging from Poletayev’s letter, the participation of the Duma group is planned. Is this necessary? If it is a question of a journal, then the Duma group has nothing to do with it. If it is a question of a newspaper, it should be borne in mind that we have had plenty of discord as it is with Zvezda: they have no line, they are afraid of going with us, afraid of going with the liquidators, they play hot and cold, they give themselves airs, they vacillate. Besides, a union of the Plekhanovites+our people-f-the Duma group threatens to give Plekhanov a preponderance, for Mensheviks predominate in the Duma grou"
