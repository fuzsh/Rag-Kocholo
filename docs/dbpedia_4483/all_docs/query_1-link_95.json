        "text": "Gain real-time visibility across your winery, automate manual processes, and link data and reporting across departments with Barrel ERP—a NetSuite application designed specifically for the business needs of wineries and vineyards that creates an end-to-end operational solution.\n\nWhen added to NetSuite, Barrel ERP can help drive down costs, enhance productivity, and save time and resources by implementing a single source-of-truth platform that automates key processes and collects and organizes data into one system to make reporting easy and effective.\n\nSeamlessly connect front-of-house retail and back-of-house production operations—as well as your accounting functions—to consolidate and cross-report key business data and systems. Transform your operations with Barrel ERP so you can stay focused on what matters most: making and distributing great wine.\n\nComprehensive Visibility Across Your Organization\n\nToo often wineries hamper productivity and strategic decision-making because they continue to use dated, difficult-to-manage, or nonintegrated systems that provide poor reporting.\n\nEnhancing visibility into and across disparate areas of your company, Barrel ERP can help consistently measure and maintain relevant data to inform the right people on key processes—such as wine production and quality, cost of goods sold (COGS) tracking, inventory management, and product sales by stock keeping unit (SKU), vintage, and brand, or other measurement.\n\nKey department and focus areas can include:\n\nSales and marketing. Measure sales across various marketing channels including direct-to-consumer, distributors, wholesale, and more to understand customer demographics and buying history; identify sales by channel, brand, varietal, location; and more.\n\nAccounting. Collect and manage information for production and sales on which you pay taxes to enhance and automate tax reporting to the IRS. Report finances by brand and channel and evaluate COGS. Automate and streamline Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB) reporting to alleviate manual data collection and accelerate report generation.\n\nProduction. Manage and gain visibility into your entire production process including tank and barrel measurement and tracking as well as volume production. Provide insights into entry and exit for each stage of your production process, document all quality management measurements, packaging, and transition to inventory.\n\nInventory. Assess tasting room, barrel room, or cave and other inventory, as well as finished good stock, and more with real-time COGS calculations provided to the accounting team for every item.\n\nWarehouse. Manage all aspects of the warehouse including inventory tracking, lot management, and receipt and fulfillment.\n\nSupply chain. Provide integrated and automated purchasing coordinated with production, and warehouse management to maintain inventory levels that meet production needs without incurring additional costs from holding excessive inventory.\n\nCustomized Capabilities and Features\n\nSee how you can personalize your Barrel ERP platform to the nuances of your operations.\n\nAs the largest accounting, consulting, and wealth management firm headquartered in the West, our professionals are rooted in the country’s most prominent wine regions of California, Oregon, and Washington—and emerging winegrowing regions like Texas—while also serving clients nationwide.\n\nDeeply immersed in the wine industry, our professionals bring a collaborative approach to engagements that dedicates time to understand the specifics needs of your business and strategically develop solutions contextualized among greater industry trends and activity.\n\nWe view challenges from the perspective of winery owners because many of our professionals previously worked in executive roles within the industry and possess first-hand experience and knowledge of what it takes to pursue your goals.\n\nOur clients aren’t the only industry leaders who look to us for guidance. We frequently collaborate with influential industry organizations such as Wine Institute, California Association of Winegrape Growers, Oregon Wine Board, Washington Association of Winegrape Growers, Family Winemakers of California, Sonoma County Winegrowers, Napa Valley Vintners and Grape Growers Associations, Washington Wine Industry Foundation, Women for Winesense, and Texas Wine and Grape Growers Association.\n\nThrough our dedicated Netsuite Implementation Services, our professionals hold top NetSuite certifications and bring real-world experience to solution design—so you’re set up to hit the ground running.\n\nAdditionally, our one-firm approach can provide access to comprehensive support and insights in other key areas that may bolster your organization and establish foundations for long-term success."
