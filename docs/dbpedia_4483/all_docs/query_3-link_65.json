We will take all steps necessary to ensure that your Personal Data is securely treated in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we transfer your Personal Data out of your jurisdiction, we will implement suitable safeguards and rely on legally provided mechanisms to lawfully transfer data across borders in order to ensure that your Personal Data is protected.\n\n13) How We Protect Personal Data\n\ninsightsoftware maintains administrative, technical and physical safeguards designed to protect the User’s Personal Data and information against accidental, unlawful or unauthorized destruction, loss, alteration, access, disclosure or use. We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure an adequate level of security, while taking into account the technological reality, cost, scope, context and purposes of processing weighted against the severity and likelihood that processing could threaten individual rights and freedoms.\n\nIf insightsoftware collects account information for payment or credit, insightsoftware will only use this information to complete the task that the account information was provided for.\n\nWhile we take steps designed to protect your Personal Data, please be advised that no security system or means of transmitting data over the Internet can be guaranteed to be entirely secure, including concerns with respect to computer viruses, malicious software, and hacker attacks. We cannot and do not guarantee or warrant the security of your Personal Data or any information you disclose or transmit to us. We are not responsible for the acts of those who gain unauthorized access and we make no warranty, express, implied or otherwise, that we will prevent such access. As a result, please note that we are not responsible for damages or liabilities related to any such incidents to the fullest extent permitted by law. Where required under law, we will notify you of any such loss, misuse or alteration of Personal Data that may affect you so that you can take appropriate actions in response.\n\n14) Children\n\nWe do not intend for children to use our Sites. We do not intentionally gather Personal Data about visitors who are under the age of 16 or who are considered a minor in the jurisdiction in which you are accessing our Sites or Services. If a child has provided us with Personal Data, a parent or guardian of that child may contact us to have the information deleted from our records. If you believe we may have any information from a child under age 16 or an individual considered a minor in the applicable jurisdiction, please contact us at [email protected]. If we learn that we have inadvertently collected the personal information of a child under 16 or the equivalent minimum age depending on jurisdiction, we will take steps to delete the information as soon as possible.\n\n15) Direct Marketing and “Do Not Track” Signals\n\nDo Not Track (“DNT”) is a concept that has been promoted by regulatory authorities, including the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for the Internet industry to develop and implement a mechanism to allow internet users to control the tracking of their online activities across websites. insightsoftware works with third-party partners in order to track Users over time and across third-party websites to provide targeted advertising and, in such instances where third-party partners are assisting with this, these partners respond to DNT signals. Additionally, some third-party sites keep track of your browsing activities when they serve you content, which enables them to tailor what they present to you. If you are visiting such sites, your browser may include controls to block and delete cookies, web beacons and similar technologies to allow you to opt out of data collection through those technologies.\n\nCalifornia residents are entitled to contact us to request information about whether we have disclosed personal information to third parties for third parties’ direct marketing purposes.
