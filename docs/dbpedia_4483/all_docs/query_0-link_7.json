In November 2016, Oracle acquired NetSuite for approximately $9.3 billion. NetSuite now operates as an independent GBU (global business unit) of Oracle and is managed by now Executive Vice President Evan Goldberg.\n\nType\n\nA subsidiary of Oracle Corporation Industry Computer software Founded California (1998) Headquarters\n\nRedwood Shores, California , US\n\nKey people\n\nEvan Goldberg (SVP of Development)\n\nJim McGeever (President) (retired)\n\nLawrence (Larry) J. Ellison (stakeholder) Services A cloud-based business management platform\n\nNetSuite’s History\n\nGoldberg, a former VP of Oracle, was provided seed money for NetSuite (then NetLedger) by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Around that same time, Ellison also provided seed money to another one of his VP’s to go start a cloud technology company – Marc Benioff the founder of Salesforce.\n\nNetSuite launched just ahead of Salesforce and to this day claims the title of “the first cloud company” which is an impressive title to hold in 2020.\n\nIn the early days, NetSuite was licensed to Oracle under the brand “The Oracle Small Business Suite” but that program was short-lived.\n\nIn 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO after his experience leads him to believe that the cloud was “the final frontier of software” and all software would soon be delivered in a SaaS model. Under Nelson’s leadership, the company grew to over 5,000 people and ran up to a billion-dollar run-rate before the Oracle acquisition.\n\nNetSuite’s Offices\n\nNetSuite maintains offices in:\n\nDenver\n\nLas Vegas\n\nAustin\n\nChicago\n\nAtlanta\n\nNew York City\n\nBoston\n\nToronto\n\nThe United Kingdom\n\nSpain\n\nCzech Republic\n\nHong Kong\n\nSingapore\n\nPhilippines\n\nAustralia\n\nUruguay\n\nNetSuite’s Acquisitions\n\n2008: OpenAir – web-based timesheets and expense reports\n\nNetSuite still sells the OpenAir PSA product under the OpenAir brand\n\n2009: QuickArrow – web-based professional services automation application\n\nSolutions and staff were worked into the OpenAir and NetSuite PSA products\n\n2013: Retail Anywhere – retail e-commerce software\n\nSolutions and staff were worked into SuiteCommerce products\n\n2013: TribeHR – human resource software for small to medium-sized businesses\n\nSolutions and staff were worked into the SuitePeople products\n\n2013: LightCMS – content management software\n\nSolutions and staff were worked into the SuiteCommerce Standard product\n\n2014: Venda – retail e-commerce software\n\nSolutions and staff were worked into the SuiteCommerce Standard product\n\n2014: eBizNET solutions – advanced warehouse management\n\nSolutions and staff were worked into the NetSuite WMS solution\n\n2015: Bronto Software – email service provider\n\nNetSuite still sells the Bronto Marketing Platform under the NetSuite Bronto brand\n\n2015: Monexa – subscription billing and recurring payment\n\nSolutions and staff were worked into the SuiteBilling product\n\nWhat is NetSuite used for?\n\nNetSuite is the #1 Cloud ERP and it provides a suite of cloud-based financials and ERP for over 18,000 customers in more than 200 countries.\n\nIt’s capabilities include:\n\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) – NetSuite ERP provides the features and functions to run your entire business on one platform, ERP reduces the silos within an organization and allows them to share information freely among each other to improve processes and reduce friction.\n\nNetsuite OneWorld – NetSuite OneWorld allows an organization to have a real-time, unified view of their global business.
