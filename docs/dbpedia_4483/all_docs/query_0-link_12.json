        "text": "The Business Solution:\n\nAre version lock and outdated systems causing headaches with your on-premise ERP? Consider if switching to a cloud ERP is the right move for your business. In this software evaluation guide, we'll dive into why Gartner recognizes NetSuite as a leader and a top choice for managing cloud financials, ERP, and omnichannel commerce operations for businesses.\n\nLegacy Systems Hold Back Business Growth\n\nMost companies running on old technologies are stuck relying on disparate systems, experience outgrowth, drive inefficiencies, and experience a major time-sink with manual processing across all departments.\n\nAccording to a recent study by Hitachith Consulting, 9 out of 10 decision-makers claim that legacy systems cause inefficiency, drive up costs, and prevent their business from growing. It also revealed that 1/3 of the respondents out of 100 IT leaders (with 1,000+ staff) agreed that their legacy system created a barrier and held back their business. Deliver the best possible experience for your customers and your staff with integrated cloud software..\n\nOne of the key reasons why companies choose NetSuite is its ability to eliminate version lock and outdated systems that are common with on-premise ERP systems. By moving to a true cloud ERP like NetSuite, businesses can ensure that they are always using the latest and most up-to-date software without the need for costly and time-consuming upgrades. The ability to gather real-time business data from any location at any time with an internet connection enhances decision-making and oversight over your enterprise.\n\nOracle NetSuite allows businesses to become more competitive, lower costs, streamline business processes, and increase efficiency.\n\nAccording to Forrester, “approximately half of ERP customers are on releases that are two versions behind the current release, which may be four or more years old or more.” It’s time to think beyond your disconnected, patched, bolted-on, on-premise ERP system and look to the future!\n\n• How to choose the Right ERP for Your Business\n\n• Top Benefits of NetSuite\n\n• What are the growing costs of QuickBooks?\n\nFor the 4th Year in a Row, Gartner Names NetSuite a Top Cloud Business Solution\n\nAccording to a new report from Gartner, NetSuite has been named a Leader in MQ for Cloud Core Financial Management for Midsize, Large, and Global enterprises.\n\nWhat does this mean?\n\n#1 – NetSuite is ranked a top leader amongst a large market of technology competitors.\n\n#2 – NetSuite is the ONLY leader that serves businesses of all sizes across all regions.\n\n#3 – NetSuite has more customers using cloud financials than any other solution in the quadrant.\n\n#4 – NetSuite is one of four software vendors in the Leaders Quadrant.\n\n#5 – NetSuite has been recognized for its “completeness of vision and ability to execute“.\n\nGartner recognizes NetSuite for its ability to provide a complete range of tools and features that help businesses improve efficiency, save costs, and boost customer satisfaction. It's worth noting that NetSuite is the only leader in Gartner's Quadrant that serves businesses of all sizes.\n\nNetSuite stands by its customers, continues to invest in its products, and offers an expanding ecosystem of partners to support, service, and integrate the software. Businesses of every size are upgrading to NetSuite to gain the visibility and efficiency they need! NetSuite was also named a Top Leader in Cloud ERP for Product-Centric Enterprises.\n\nGartner's Definition of a “Leader” – Technology Research\n\nGartner believes that NetSuite is the full package with a complete cloud-based business management suite for finance, accounting, billing, revenue recognition, governance, risk and compliance, global consolidation, and more.\n\n“Leaders demonstrate a market-defining vision of how core financial management systems and processes can be supported and improved by moving them to the cloud. They couple this with a clear ability to execute this vision through products, services, and go-to-market strategies. They have a strong presence in the market and are growing their revenue and market share.\n\nIn this market, Leaders show a consistent ability to secure deals with enterprises of different sizes and have a good depth of functionality across all areas of core financial management. They have multiple proofs of successful deployments by customers, both in their home region and elsewhere. Their offerings are often used by system integrator partners to support finance transformation initiatives.\n\nLeaders typically address a wide market audience by supporting broad market requirements. However, they may fail to meet the specific needs of vertical markets or other, more specialized segments, which might be better addressed by Niche Players particularly.” – Gartner analysts\n\nThe top cloud ERP offers many advantages like instant insights, efficient processes, and a complete overview of business performance. Say goodbye to multiple versions of the software, customers receive two software updates each year to ensure they have the latest technology with new features and improved functionality.\n\n5 Reasons Businesses Choose NetSuite\n\nA UNIFIED BUSINESS SUITE:\n\nNetSuite smoothly combines all business aspects into one system, simplifying data access without managing multiple systems.
