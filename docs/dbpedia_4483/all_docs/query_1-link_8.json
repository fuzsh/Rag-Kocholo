        "text": "Confirming Your State IDs\n\nWhen filing state-specific reporting, the relevant state IDs are required. By default, the state IDs reported are defined in the jurisdiction settings.\n\nTo confirm your State IDs:\n\nGo to Setup > Payroll > Setup Tasks > Set Up Payroll.\n\nIf you have a NetSuite OneWorld account, select the subsidiary from the Subsidiary list.\n\nClick the Jurisdictions subtab.\n\nClick the subtab for the four mandated states:\n\nFor the District of Columbia, the State ID is sourced from the OTR Account Number.\n\nFor New Jersey, the State ID is sourced from the Taxpayer Identification Number.\n\nFor California, the State ID is sourced from the ALE Memberâs FEIN.\n\nFor Rhode Island, the State ID is sourced from the ALE Memberâs FEIN.\n\nNote:\n\nIf an employee earned income in DC in any month, they are considered a resident of DC for that month for ACA reporting purposes. This is true even if they resided in another state.\n\nIf you do not configure the states in the jurisdiction settings, NetSuite uses the Employer Identification Number (EIN) in the Company and Subsidiary settings.\n\nViewing and Editing an Employeeâs State History\n\nThe state history records an employeeâs residence in the four mandated states (DC, NJ, CA, and RI). If an employee moved into or out of a mandated state during a month, they are considered as residents of that state during that month.\n\nWhen you install or update the ACA SuiteApp, the employeesâ state histories are generated from the system notes on the employee record. Subsequently, when you edit an employeeâs address on the employee record, their state history is updated.\n\nTo view or edit an employeeâs state history:\n\nGo to Payroll and HR > Lists > Employees (Payroll Manager).\n\nOn the Employees list, click Edit next to the employee whose state history you want to view.\n\nClick the Affordable Care Act (ACA) subtab.\n\nClick the State History subtab.\n\nIf you need to correct information in the state history, click the row of the field you want to edit.\n\nFor each time period when the employee resided in a mandated state, enter the State, Start Month, Start Year, End Month, and End Year. To indicate that you manually edited the state history, check the Is Manually Added box.\n\nClick Save."
