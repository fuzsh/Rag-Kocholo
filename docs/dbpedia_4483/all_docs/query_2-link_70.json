        "text": "NetSuite Inc. (NYSE: N), the industry’s leading provider of cloud-based financials / ERP software suites, today announced six solution provider and value-added reseller (VAR) firms are launching new cloud business management practices with NetSuite to meet a strong customer demand for highly scalable and efficient cloud solutions for financials / ERP, CRM, Ecommerce and professional services automation (PSA) across a range of industries including manufacturing, software, wholesale distribution, non-profit, professional services and government. The new NetSuite partners including Altico Advisors, BAASS Business Solutions, Eide Bailly, Envisage Business Solutions, MorganFranklin Consulting and Project Partners, offer deep experience and a proven track record in diverse areas, including financial management and performance improvement, two-tier ERP implementations at enterprises that link cloud solutions at subsidiaries to an on-premise system at headquarters, and services resources planning (SRP) for standalone services organizations and embedded services teams based on the NetSuite OpenAir PSA solution.\n\n“Our new solution provider/VAR partners see a tremendous opportunity in partnering with NetSuite to address the phenomenal migration from Stone Age on-premise systems to the flexibility and mobility of the cloud,” said Craig West, Vice President of Americas Channel Sales at NetSuite. “We’re delighted to join forces with these leading firms to help customers achieve the transformation into nimble, innovative businesses and pursue rapid growth.”\n\nNamed earlier this year to CRN’s 2013 Partner Program Guide with a 5-Star Partner rating, the NetSuite Solution Provider Partner Program’s growth has accelerated as organizations seek IT, business and industry consulting expertise to accelerate time to value with a fast and expert implementation and to make the most of NetSuite to help increase productivity, reduce costs and power rapid growth. Launched in 2002, the NetSuite Solution Provider Program is the industry’s leading cloud channel partner program, it provides hundreds of channel partners with a cloud solution to offer prospective customers and grow their businesses as well as industry-leading margins and incentive programs, like the NetSuite SP 100, which pays 100% of first year NetSuite sales revenues. With cloud computing at the forefront of the hottest trends and cloud ERP leading the way, channel partners representing on-premise products like Sage and Microsoft Dynamics GP continue to migrate to NetSuite’s superior cloud business management suite. Designed to help solution providers transform their business model to fully capitalize on the revenue growth opportunity of the NetSuite cloud, the NetSuite Solution Provider Program delivers unprecedented benefits that begin during recruitment and range from business planning, sales, marketing and professional services enablement, to training and education.\n\nThe new partners joining the NetSuite Solution Provider Program are:\n\nAltico Advisors (www.alticoadvisors.com), headquartered in Marlborough, Mass., is launching its first cloud ERP practice to deliver NetSuite solutions to mid-market clients in manufacturing, distribution, software development, services and other industries in New England and beyond. The firm, with 20 percent year-over-year revenue growth in each of the last four years and named in 2012 as a Top 100 VAR by Accounting Today, is expanding beyond its traditional focus of on-premise Microsoft Dynamics GP and CRM to offer NetSuite cloud ERP / financials, CRM, ecommerce and PSA to clients and prospects, as well as integration services to link disparate business applications. Altico is also positioned to deliver two-tier ERP solutions for U.S. companies with multinational operations. “Cloud adoption is being driven from the CEO down in many organizations, and for us to realize our long-term growth potential, it was time to offer clients the cloud alternative,” said Michael J. Kean, Altico Principal and President. “More organizations today don’t want hardware in house with ongoing maintenance and IT staff, and NetSuite delivers simple deployment, ease of use and predictable costs.”\n\nBAASS Business Solutions (www.baass.com), headquartered in Thornhill, Ontario, with 11 offices across Canada and the U.S. and more than 2,500 clients across North America, the Caribbean and Latin America, is launching a NetSuite-based cloud ERP practice to expand beyond its traditional focus on Sage on-premise solutions for mid-market companies in manufacturing, wholesale distribution, professional services, non-profits and other verticals. With its first dedicated implementation and reseller cloud practice, BAASS is advancing its emphasis on customer satisfaction and meeting growing market demand for the mobility, flexibility and low cost of entry offered by cloud ERP / financials, CRM, ecommerce and PSA. “More and more customers ask us about cloud solutions—a lot of technology buyers today grew up using the Internet, so the cloud is second nature to them,” said Manny Buigos, VP of U.S. and Caribbean operations. “We see NetSuite as an organization investing heavily in R&D and have been very impressed with NetSuite sales and marketing, and the partner enablement program has been fantastic. We think we have a winner with NetSuite.”\n\nEide Bailly (www.eidebailly.com), headquartered in Fargo, ND and one of the top 25 accounting firms in the U.S., with more than 40,000 clients, is building out its technology consulting practice with a strong emphasis on NetSuite cloud ERP, CRM and HR applications. The NetSuite partnership leverages Eide Bailly’s merger in November 2012 with SGS Technology Group, a Utah-based firm named last year as a Top 100 VAR by Accounting Today that brought a new systems implementation and reseller business to Eide Bailly. This addition to the Eide Bailly technology services offerings positions the company to address strong demand for cloud solutions across diverse industries. “Based on industry authorities and research by our team of professionals, we determined NetSuite to be a clear leader in cloud business management and are happy to add it to our solution offerings,” said Stuart Tholen, Partner and former SGS President. “Our experience with the NetSuite Solution Provider Program has been incredible. The NetSuite training and enablement program has prepared us very well to move forward successfully towards our goal of becoming one of NetSuite’s top resellers.”\n\nEnvisage Business Solutions (www.ebsol.com.au), based in Adelaide, South Australia, has partnered with NetSuite to launch its first cloud business management practice, complementing its offerings as a top reseller and implementer of Sage on-premise solutions with NetSuite ERP / financials, CRM, ecommerce, professional services and more. With more than 200 clients across Australia and Asia, Envisage brings technological expertise and business experience in oil and gas, insurance, financial services, wholesale distribution, manufacturing and other verticals. Envisage evaluated partnering with other cloud providers, the Australia-based Oxygen and SAP’s Business ByDesign group, before selecting NetSuite for its superior product and partner program. “NetSuite is by quite a long way a more complete solution—we’re very impressed with the wealth of functionality in NetSuite and how everything is integrated,” said Joe Gentile, Envisage CEO. “We started looking into the cloud as we kept getting asked more and more if we do cloud solutions. Companies are very interested in avoiding infrastructure outlay and having access to their data anytime, anywhere.””\n\nMorganFranklin Consulting (www.morganfranklin.com), headquartered in McLean, Va., and London, U.K., is strengthening its financial management, performance improvement, and technology enablement offerings with NetSuite’s cloud-based business management software suites. It is aligning NetSuite with the global financial, merger and acquisition, compliance, and IPO readiness issues MorganFranklin helps its public, private, and government clients address. Offering NetSuite as a cloud solution for ERP/financials, PSA, and other processes in its implementation and reseller practice, MorganFranklin is positioned to offer organizations business and IT systems expertise in finance transformation, business optimization, IT strategy and planning, accounting and auditing, and more. “NetSuite is a natural correlation to many things we already do,” said John Hoebler, Managing Director at MorganFranklin Consulting, which in 2012 was named to Consulting Magazine’s “Best Firms to Work For” list and the Inc. 500|5000 list of the fastest-growing private companies in America. “Cloud ERP is growing rapidly in all areas—not just for small and mid-sized organizations but for large enterprises as well. It’s an interesting evolution in the ERP space and MorganFranklin is excited to be part of it as a partner with the clear market leader, NetSuite.”\n\nProject Partners (www.projectp.com), a global company headquartered in Half Moon Bay, California and with offices in Canada and India, is partnering with NetSuite to deliver cloud SRP and PSA to standalone professional services organizations and embedded services teams. Recognized as the world’s foremost experts in both business and technical aspects of project-centric firms, Project Partners is expanding its traditional on-premise Oracle and Primavera services focus, which target larger companies, to include NetSuite’s Services Resource Planning solutions that serve small to medium sized companies. Project Partners offers two-tier solutions that link cloud SRP at subsidiaries to an on-premise Oracle ERP solution at headquarters, and is developing add-on ISV applications for NetSuite SRP to be available at www.suiteapp.com. “We’re seeing a lot more services organizations looking for a resource and project management solution that runs in the cloud, so expanding into the NetSuite market space was an obvious next step for Project Partners,” said Randy Egger, Project Partners president and formerly Oracle’s chief architect of the Oracle Projects applications suite. “The easy-to-use NetSuite solutions run in the cloud and deliver high value at low cost.”\n\nToday, more than 16,000 companies and subsidiaries depend on NetSuite to run complex, mission-critical business processes globally in the cloud. Since its inception in 1998, NetSuite has established itself as the leading provider of enterprise-class cloud financials/ERP suites for divisions of large enterprises and mid-sized organizations seeking to upgrade their antiquated client/server ERP systems. NetSuite excels at streamlining business operations as demonstrated in a recent Gartner study naming NetSuite as the fastest growing financial management software vendor on a global basis. NetSuite continues its success in delivering the best cloud ERP/financials suites to businesses around the world, enabling them to lower IT costs significantly while increasing productivity, as the global adoption of the cloud is accelerating."
