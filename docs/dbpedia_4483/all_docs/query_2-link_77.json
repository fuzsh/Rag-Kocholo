        "text": "NetSuite Adds Three New Partners Seeking to Drive Growth with Cloud ERP\n\nApps Associates, BTM Global and iSP3 Expand Existing Oracle Relationships with NetSuite Practices\n\nSAN MATEO, Calif.—December 5, 2017—Oracle NetSuite, one of the world’s leading providers of cloud-based financials / ERP, HR, Professional Services Automation (PSA) and omnichannel commerce software suites, today announced the addition of new partners to NetSuite’s Solution Provider Program and Alliance Partner Program. Apps Associates, BTM Global and iSP3 are expanding their longtime Oracle partner relationships to add NetSuite practices to their portfolio. Partnering with NetSuite allows them to help organizations in a range of industries improve operational efficiency, business agility, customer focus and data-driven decision-making. As NetSuite partners, the three technology consulting and implementation firms are equipped to meet growing demand for cloud ERP as the pace of business accelerates and organizations look to graduate from standalone applications that can limit the ability to innovate and scale. The new partners benefit with added capacity to grow their areas of expertise and client base, as well as flexibility to offer proprietary add-on solutions and increase both margin and recurring revenue.\n\n“Our three new partners add a diversity of industry focus and expertise with a common commitment to helping clients thrive in the cloud,” said Craig West, Oracle NetSuite Vice President of Alliances and Channels. “We’re delighted to collaborate with them in delivering agile cloud solutions that help our mutual customers scale, innovate and grow.”\n\nApps Associates, a Platinum Level Member of Oracle PartnerNetwork, Extends Offerings as NetSuite Solution Provider\n\nApps Associates (www.appsassociates.com), an 800-person global technology and business services firm based in Acton, Mass., is a Platinum level member of the Oracle PartnerNetwork. Apps Associates provides services across the Oracle product line for ERP, HCM, Analytics, Cloud, Integration, Database and other technologies. Founded in 2002, Apps Associates has grown its business across the US, Europe and India with a client base in life sciences, medical devices, manufacturing, distribution, financial services, retail and healthcare. Apps Associates also partners with AWS, Salesforce, Dell Boomi, TIBCO and MuleSoft. In teaming up with NetSuite, Apps Associates furthers its mission of working with customers to enable business improvement by streamlining business processes using advanced technology. The firm will handle NetSuite financials / ERP, HR, PSA, CRM and ecommerce in response to growing customer demand for flexible cloud business management software.\n\n“When NetSuite became part of the Oracle family of products, it was a natural opportunity to extend our offerings and bring a holistic solution to our customers,” said Scott Shelko, NetSuite Practice Manager at Apps Associates. “Apps Associates brings scale and discipline with our NetSuite practice, so our customers have the value of a full lifecycle partner that really understands the platform.”\n\nBTM Global Expands its Oracle Retail Solutions Portfolio as NetSuite Alliance Partner\n\nBTM Global (www.btmglobal.com), headquartered in Minneapolis and Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, helps retailers compete in a fast-changing world with systems integration and development services. Its clients range from regional chains to the world’s most recognized brands, including Red Wing Shoes, True Value, World Kitchen and Perry Ellis International. Founded by veterans of RETEK, a software company acquired by Oracle, BTM Global has deep expertise in Oracle Retail solutions that address retailers’ needs around store-based solutions, merchandising, business intelligence and point-of-service systems, notably EMV.\n\nBTM Global notes that more retailers, especially in the small and midmarket space, are interested in agile, cloud-based solutions that can be rapidly deployed and extended into new markets. BTM Global’s new partnership with NetSuite expands its commitment to providing its clients with a diversity of expertise, resulting in more creative and bolder solutions for retailers’ technology challenges. BTM Global will provide its core services – development, implementation, support and strategic technology planning – to retailers leveraging SuiteCommerce, NetSuite’s ecommerce platform, along with CRM and back-office functionality. BTM Global is also a Gold level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork.\n\n”We’re very happy to be able to offer NetSuite customers our unique, well-rounded expertise for their integration and development needs,” said Tom Schoen, president at BTM Global. “NetSuite offers a proven omnichannel commerce solution on a unified cloud platform with access to real-time data to improve business agility.”\n\niSP3 Builds on JD Edwards Relationship as a NetSuite Solution Provider\n\niSP3 (www.isp3.ca), a technology consulting firm that focuses on implementations of Oracle JD Edwards software, is a Platinum level member of Oracle PartnerNetwork that serves companies in the mining, building and construction, oil and gas, and government industries, as well as general business.

The firm has consultants across North America and Latin America, and has completed more than 100 projects in the Americas as well as Eastern Europe and Asia. In recent years, the 23-person iSP3 has seen rising demand among both prospects and clients for cloud-based ERP. Now, as a NetSuite partner, iSP3 is able to meet that demand with NetSuite’s leading cloud ERP platform. iSP3’s NetSuite practice can address demand for cloud ERP, while providing agility and scale for clients to grow. Beyond ERP, NetSuite’s integrated capabilities for ecommerce, CRM, HR, PSA and other functions also provide iSP3 the opportunity to expand its business into new industries and business processes.\n\n“NetSuite’s cloud-based platform is a very good fit for iSP3 and our clients,” said William Liu, Senior Partner at iSP3. “The ability to deploy NetSuite’s unified system in a short period of time to gain ROI very quickly is extremely attractive.”\n\nLaunched in 2002, the NetSuite Solution Provider Program is the industry’s leading cloud channel partner program.
