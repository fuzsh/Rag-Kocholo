        "text": "BDO Digital’s custom NetSuite solutions offer built-in approval workflows and audit controls that allow you to proactively manage important business transactions and help protect your bottom line. You can set how reports move through your approval workflows and define elevation thresholds for automation.\n\nEnhanced Approval Workflows\n\nBDO Digital approval workflows allow users to define approval rules in which multiple approvals from various departments or entities are required before transactions impact the general ledger or cash flow.\n\nKey Features\n\nAuthority matrix\n\nSetting up an authority matrix clarifies roles and responsibilities within your organization so everyone knows who has the authority to make specific decisions.\n\nApproval notes\n\nLeaving approval notes let authorized decision-makers explain the rationale behind their choices so everyone stays on the same page.\n\nSeparation of duties\n\nPrevent fraud and error from negatively affecting your business by setting internal controls on all funds, including payroll distribution, deposit slips and more.\n\nAudit support\n\nA centralized cloud database facilitates quick and easy access to historical records, reducing audit time and enhancing reporting and analysis.\n\nRouting and approval\n\nThe approval routing pages allows you to establish and select the process expense reports that go through your approval workflows. Set thresholds for elevation, and easily onboard new employees.\n\nScalability\n\nAs the number of purchase orders, contracts, and invoices increases, you’ll have peace of mind that our system will always meet your demands.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic wreaked havoc on global supply chains across almost every industry, disrupting order fulfillment and resulting in lost revenue. While global supply chains are projected to return to pre-pandemic trajectories, building a resilient supply chain is critical for navigating similar large-scale emergencies.\n\nTo do so, you need visibility into your products and requirements — without the extraneous information that so often bogs companies down. BDO Digital’s custom NetSuite offerings provide intelligent supply chain solutions that work to achieve this goal in all phases of product development and order fulfillment.\n\nWith a robust cloud-based material requirements planning (MRP) system, NetSuite helps improve overall cost-efficiency by estimating raw material quantities, delivery schedules and use-by dates. Receipts management capabilities help simplify financials and accounting, and work order tracking and lot control let you monitor where orders are in the fulfillment process.\n\nKey Features\n\nPurchasing and procurement\n\nWe identify organizations that supply the products you need, aid in the purchasing process and procure the products to be sent out.\n\nMaterial requirements planning (MRP)\n\nOur robust cloud-based inventory management system improves productivity by estimating quantities of raw materials with a schedule of their deliveries, and by constantly parsing raw data such as the shelf life of stored materials and bills of lading.\n\nReceipts management\n\nFor every purchase completed, we record receipts of inventory at both outsourced and in-house facilities. This makes financials and accounting easier for your company.\n\nTransfer orders and pricing\n\nWe provide automated tracking inventory movements between subsidiaries with correct eliminations and inter-company profit calculations.\n\nVendor and materials onboarding\n\nOur CMO supply-chain solutions make it simple to onboard new vendors or materials. The process is intuitive, so you don’t waste time when adding new information to the system.\n\nWork orders and assemblies\n\nEasily track all work orders and assemblies, or implement new ones as needed—all in one place.\n\nLot control and traceability\n\nTrack which supplier lots are used for finished products and where the products end up. This feature allows for full look-back and look-forward through all products.\n\nA system that prioritizes GMP compliance is essential for ensuring consistent production according to quality standards and legal regulations. Not only are BDO Digital’s custom NetSuite solutions GMP-compliant — they also help your organization simplify meeting compliance requirements.\n\nIn-House Compliance without the Big Expense\n\nStandard NetSuite software can accommodate generic manufacturing solutions; however, it’s not ideal for pharmaceutical and biotech spaces. By enhancing basic NetSuite software with our industry-specific solutions, BDO Digital has created a scalable platform that has all the tools necessary for a GMP-compliant process.\n\nKey Features\n\nVendor onboarding and management\n\nMaintain stronger relationships with suppliers by providing a cloud-based vendor portal for collaboration, communication and connection. Vendor scorecards track and analyze every transaction so you can monitor performance and change vendors if needed.\n\nInventory management\n\nNetSuite's system limits inventory movement by status, enabling automated lot inspection and reporting via custom dashboards and alerts.\n\nBatch-release and sample management\n\nA centralized repository lets you view and manage all sample and batch data from one location, so you can more efficiently coordinate sourcing, storage, shipment and product release.\n\nGMP system validation\n\nAll the documentation needed for validation is already written, and upon delivery of your system, our team will help your organization complete and record the system testing.\n\nPurchasing process\n\nFrom APIs to secondary packaging, new equipment and miscellaneous lab equipment, all purchases are automatically logged by their class, associated trial and candidate. Easily run reports and maintain complete control over every department’s purchasing.\n\nBarcoding and WMS\n\nBDO Digital provides everything an organization might need in its facility, plus an integrated WMS system, from labels to handheld devices and printers.\n\nFinal product release/material lot inspection\n\nEvery lot of raw materials received or product produced for GMP manufacturing requires a review. BDO Digital’s system captures all relevant data and documentation and adheres to 21 CFR Part 11/Annex 11 requirements in the lot release process.\n\nSecurity configuration\n\nThe FDA's 21 CFR Part 11 requires companies to validate their electronic systems and documents for quality and compliance. Automated solutions are most effective for this, and BDO Digital provides automatic 21 CFR Part 11 compliance, personnel training, and auto-generated audit trails for any captured document and data.\n\nDashboard, reports and alerts\n\nAll the important information you need is at your fingertips, and everything else is within arm’s reach. Built-in, optimized system dashboards for each role give a 10,000-foot view, with the ability to drill down to any level of detail required for operation, automatically generate reports and receive alerts.\n\nGain complete visibility over all supply chain connections on demand with NetSuite's advanced reporting capabilities. The professionals at BDO Digital are dedicated to helping you optimize the reporting software for your specific industry and business model so you can focus on enhancing efficiency.\n\nIndustry-Specific Solutions, Optimized for Pharma\n\nBDO Digital understands that outdated, one-size-fits-all accounting systems can’t adequately address pharma-specific needs and lack Tier 1 solutions for many companies, especially those researching rare and orphan diseases. By enhancing the base NetSuite platform with industry-specific solutions, we help you meet your global financials needs.\n\nKey Features\n\nMulti-entity and multi-currency reporting\n\nGlobal companies can automate reporting for consolidations and eliminations across all their entities and currencies, simplifying international business growth.\n\nContract management\n\nOur contract expense accrual management module automates labor-intensive accrual methodologies, allows for direct input, directs connection into contract lifecycle management, and syncs solutions right into deliverables.\n\nSOX compliance\n\nSarbanes-Oxley (SOX) compliance is standard for every financial deployment we offer. We can segregate duties and offer delegation of authority/authority matrix, audit support, integrated controls, and more to make compliance maintenance easier than ever.\n\nProcure to pay\n\nBoost operational efficiency by integrating purchasing and accounts payable systems into one streamlined workflow.\n\nApproval modules\n\nOur approval modules offer access to transactions, entity records, new vendors, general ledger accounts, and more. You’ll easily see which approvals are outstanding, overdue, or completed—without having to search for the information.\n\nAdvanced reporting\n\nOur advanced reporting system is specifically optimized for pharma, meaning all your information is neatly collated and contained in one place. You can review your financial reports in a variety of ways, including by class, department, candidate, indication, lab, and more.\n\nEfficiently manage in-house production with the BDO Digital CDMO Suite. From simplified procurement processes to GMP manufacturing functionality, our contract manufacturing organization supply chain is ideal for companies throughout the processes of development, production and customer service.\n\nNetSuite's customer relationship management (CRM) software provides visibility into the customer lifecycle, from order intake to ongoing support.

It provides a seamless flow of information across the entire customer lifecycle—from lead all the way through opportunity, sales order, fulfillment and support.
