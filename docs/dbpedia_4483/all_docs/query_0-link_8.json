(After the implementation) We shaved 70%, and Freedompay has expanded to open an office in Las Vegas, London - and a lot of that has been because of NetSuite and the GURUS team.”\n\nJimmy Arkin, Accounting Manager Freedompay\n\n“Working with the GURUS team was very easy because they all know exactly what’s going on, they lay out the expectations of my team very clearly. They let us know what they’re going to be doing very clearly, and there was never any question as to whose responsibility something was or a timeline. It was all put upfront and we managed very well.”\n\nGary Banner, Controller of FXR Racing"
