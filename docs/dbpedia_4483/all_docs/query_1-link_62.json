        "text": "Work Where It’s Best for You\n\nWork Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.\n\nWork Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.\n\nWe invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.\n\nProduct teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within two time zones of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Los Angeles, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.\n\nCustomer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.\n\nWhen an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.\n\nWork at Veeva. Work where it’s best for you."
