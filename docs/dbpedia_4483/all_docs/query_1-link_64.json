        "text": "In your NetSuite research, you’ve likely realized that there are many different modules that each offer specific functionality. The modular design provides you with flexibility as you build out your solution – you can implement only the functionality you need, without paying for extra features you won’t use. However, choosing the right NetSuite modules based on your business needs can be overwhelming.\n\nThis leads us to the purpose of this post – you’ll find an overview of the NetSuite modules and the value they offer.\n\nWhat is a NetSuite Module?\n\nNetSuite ERP is designed as a suite of modules with specific functionality. This gives you the flexibility to get your base ERP in place and add new functionality over time as it makes sense for your business. This phased approach allows you to manage the cost and ease the transition for your team.\n\nHow to Choose the Right NetSuite Modules for Your Business\n\nWhile some functionality – like accounts receivable, accounts payable, general ledger and cash management – will be an obvious starting point, you might be left wondering which modules you need to meet your needs now and in the future. As a starting point, you can go back to your ERP requirements and map them to the modules listed here.\n\nBut the best approach is to connect with a NetSuite partner, like ProjectLine. We do a discovery session with your team to understand your processes and recommend the modules that will meet your needs. From there, we’ll do a tailored NetSuite demo that shows how the solution helps you overcome the challenges you’re facing in your business today. If you decide that NetSuite is the right ERP solution for your business, we’ll guide you through the implementation process and provide ongoing support.\n\nThe Complete NetSuite Module List\n\nEvery NetSuite edition includes the following core ERP functionality:\n\nGeneral Ledger\n\nAccounts Receivable\n\nAccounts Payable\n\nPayment Methods – Credit Cards, ACH, EFT\n\nBank Management & Reconciliations\n\nMulti-currency & Multi-language\n\nItem Management\n\nBasic Inventory Management\n\nBasic Project Management\n\nOrder Management\n\nPurchasing\n\nTime & Expense Management\n\nFor smaller companies with simple processes, the core functionality might be enough.
