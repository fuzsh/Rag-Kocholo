Beginning with a full client onboarding to ensure all parties are appropriately aligned, project scope is thoroughly reviewed, a detailed agenda and timeline is set, and tasks and budget are outlined.\n\nCustom solutions are designed following extensive personnel interviews, reviews of existing business processes, identification of functional gaps, and designation of appropriate customizations, integrations and reporting requirements.\n\nOnce installed, team training begins to test these new processes and optimize as needed, in preparation for wider end-user audits and the finalization of all data migrations and deployment.\n\nSecure Migration\n\nBusiness data is among an organization’s most crucial assets, making its secure migration integral to a smooth software transition.\n\nBy extracting legacy data from the old ERP/CRM and transferring it to a new system, our team ensures this process is quick and efficient, avoiding costly downtime and eliminating unnecessary expenses and potential errors that can occur from the need to rekey data.\n\nTailored Applications\n\nBy tailoring ERP/CRM and CPM applications to specific business needs, we are able to effectively streamline operations, eliminate redundancies, minimize errors, and provide valuable insights to leadership. From dashboard customizations to standalone applications, our custom development can take business operations to the next level.\n\nBSP’s team boasts extensive knowledge of programming languages and cross-platform experience—Java Scripting, HTML, Microsoft, .NET, SOAP, HubL, Webhooks, Open API Development, Web Services Programming, Dexterity language—facilitating the creation of tailor-made integrations.\n\nSupport Team\n\nThe support team is oriented to your custom solution, which is systematically reevaluated each year to provide recommendations for improvement.
