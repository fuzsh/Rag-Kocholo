        "text": "How does NetSuite work?\n\nNetSuite is the No. 1 enterprise resource planning (ERP) software solution. It gives you real-time insights into how well your business is performing so you can adjust or pivot based on changing marketing conditions.\n\nNetSuite’s cloud-based business management platform provides you with a range of applications to run your business entirely on a single platform. You can apply this platform to a number of business modules.\n\nFor example, users have access to all business models through a single sign-in portal. Drag-and-drop tools let departments personalize dashboards with metrics, charts, graphs, reminders and shortcuts. Every module shares a common database where information from across the system updates in real time and is accessible to departments across business functions. This gives your company a 360-degree view of the business to see which departments are thriving and which need more attention.\n\nUsers can access NetSuite’s platform securely from any device with an internet connection. You can track business performance and receive alerts no matter where you are. There’s also a role-based option that gives authorized workers only information pertaining to their job.\n\nNetSuite is a multitenant cloud solution. This means that every user runs the same version of the software and its back-end infrastructure. Users also receive automatic updated versions of the software.\n\nEach user’s data is stored and secured separately. NetSuite’s security team provides round-the-clock monitoring to ensure the strongest operational data center security. For instance, implementing strong encryption, role-based access controls and robust password policies are just a few ways NetSuite protects its users. Additional layers of protection include multifactor end-user authentication and token-based application authentication.\n\nNetSuite uses the software as a service, or SaaS, model. This means that your business pays a subscription fee to use the technology without having to worry about additional infrastructure or system maintenance costs. Eliminating maintenance and upgrade costs allows your company to focus on serving your customers instead of hiring additional employees to maintain the system."
