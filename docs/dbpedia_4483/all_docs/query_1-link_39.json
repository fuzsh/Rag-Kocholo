Its free tier lets you choose one app from its marketplace to try out. Upgrade to its paid tiers starting at $24.90 per user, per month (if billed annually) to access all of its apps. Upgrade further to take advantage of its on-premises or multi-company solutions at $37.40 per user, per month (if billed annually).\n\nUnlike some ERP systems, Odoo offers features for dropshipping and e-commerce. NetSuite offers both, but its e-commerce suite costs extra.

It offers features for financial management, sales and customer management, purchasing and inventory control, business intelligence as well as industry-specific capabilities. Unlike NetSuite, it offers both cloud and on-premises solutions.\n\nHowever, while it offers all the features a small business needs to scale, it doesn’t offer transparent pricing and can be complex to use.

While it may be pricier than some options with a starting monthly price of $199 per user, it’s still less expensive than NetSuite. SYSPRO excels in inventory, warehouse and supply chain management. This is specifically useful to manufacturing or distribution companies, such as automotive, fabricated metals, food and beverage, medical devices and more.\n\nSYSPRO also offers robust financial and accounting features as well as advanced reporting. However, it doesn’t offer HR features, and its CRM functionality costs extra.

Providers were ranked based on their total score across the five categories to determine the best NetSuite alternatives.\n\nHere are the specific scoring categories we used:\n\nPricing – 10%\n\nNetSuite doesn’t offer public pricing or a free trial, though it does offer a free demo. It’s typically a pricier option suited for larger companies. When assessing the top alternatives, we took into account affordability and the availability of trials as well as price transparency. While it’s not common for ERPs to offer public pricing and free trials, it’s possible to find alternatives that are more affordable with available pricing and free trials.\n\nGeneral Features – 30%\n\nTop NetSuite competitors should offer all the core features you’d expect out of a leading ERP system. When scoring the top alternatives, we assessed key functionalities such as warehouse management, inventory management, cloud accounting, CRM features, robust reporting, third-party integrations and the ability to receive real-time updates.\n\nWe also assessed whether each ERP offered a cloud-based or on-premises solution. NetSuite scored close to 100% in this category but doesn’t offer an on-premises solution. There are alternatives available that offer both cloud-based or on-premises ERP options.\n\nAdvanced Features – 20%\n\nIn addition to core features, the best NetSuite alternatives should also offer advanced features, including robust automations, HR functionality, financial management and supply chain management. NetSuite scored high marks in this category. However, some key features, such as its advanced automations and HR management system, need to be purchased as add-ons.\n\nThird-Party Ratings and Reviews – 10%\n\nImportant to our scoring criteria is real-world feedback from users. To assess what users think about the top NetSuite alternatives, we looked at third-party reviews and ratings. We considered both the average rating across leading rating sites as well as the total number of reviews. This ensures that user ratings are statistically significant.\n\nExpert Score – 30%\n\nWe also took into account our own firsthand experience with the top NetSuite alternatives. When scoring options using our expert score, we assessed metrics such as ease of use, customer support quality and value for the money. Overall, we found NetSuite to be highly customizable but more complex and more costly than some alternative options.\n\nCompare NetSuite Competitors\n\nWhat To Look For in a NetSuite Alternative\n\nThere are many factors to consider when choosing a NetSuite alternative. The first is pricing. NetSuite doesn’t offer a free trial and is one of the pricier options available. When assessing NetSuite competitors, consider your overall budget and find a solution that delivers the most value for the money. Also consider any third-party costs if you integrate with other software.\n\nThe next thing you want to consider are the core features offered in the top NetSuite alternatives. All leading ERP systems should include features such as accounting, warehouse management, inventory management, CRM functionality and more, as well as offer both on-premises or cloud solutions. NetSuite doesn’t offer on-premises ERP options, but some competitors do.\n\nYou also want to consider advanced features when selecting a NetSuite alternative. NetSuite’s ERP offers many advanced functionalities, such as robust automations and financial management. However, some advanced functionalities, such as its HR and manufacturing features require add-on upgrades, increasing the price. Choose an alternative option that has all the advanced features you need for a fair price.\n\nFinally, consider overall ease of use and customer support. NetSuite is a popular, highly customizable option with a lot of flexibility. But, it can be overwhelming and difficult to use at times. There may be other options that are more user-friendly. Make sure you assess NetSuite competitors across the full range of pricing, features and overall ease of use.\n\nIs NetSuite the Best ERP System?\n\nNetSuite offers a full suite of general and advanced features with add-on upgrades and third-party apps to customize the experience.

You can customize your experience by adding features, such as payroll, HR, demand planning, manufacturing, fixed assets management and contract renewals. NetSuite also offers SuiteApps, a third-party app marketplace for NetSuite.\n\nOn the downside, NetSuite has a high starting price and can become even more costly if you pay for add-on features and functionalities. While it’s versatile, it can be overwhelming for some and, despite generous training and onboarding tools, more intimidating to use when compared to alternative options. NetSuite is best for larger companies that need a wide range of features and customization.\n\nNetSuite Cost\n\nNetSuite doesn’t offer publicly available pricing and doesn’t have a free trial offer, but it does offer a free demo. While this isn’t uncommon for the industry, there are NetSuite alternatives that are more affordable and offer free trials. For example, while you can purchase NetSuite’s human resource management system (HRIS) as a paid add-on, it doesn’t come with its core ERP system.\n\nWhen purchasing NetSuite, you first need to choose a base package. From there, you can select the number of user licenses as well as any add-on modules. Schedule a call to get a specific quote.\n\nWhen To Choose a Competitor Over NetSuite\n\nNetSuite offers a leading ERP system with a suite of general and advanced features. However, some functionalities cost extra, making it potentially pricey versus other alternatives.
