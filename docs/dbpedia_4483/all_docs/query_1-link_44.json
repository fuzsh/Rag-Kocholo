Their audience, investors and the number of entrepreneurs and small business owners that required their help were growing at a very rapid rate. The organization was overseeing a number of increasingly more complex and bigger processes for donor management, requirements in detailed reporting, grant accounting, managing audits across multiple states - and struggling to keep up with all of it on old systems that simply weren’t keeping up with their organization’s growth.\n\nThrough a collaborative approach, the GURUS Solutions NetSuite team was able to help Opportunity Fund in developing the best ERP functionalities to support their cause. From simplifying data imports to leveraging NetSuite’s sophisticated donor management and multinational capabilities, they are now able to save time that they used to spend on manual processes and now invest that into their mission and have a larger impact.\n\nOpportunity Fund\n\nPost-Implementation\n\nNow, the California-based organization looks forward to increasing its operations across the 45 states it serves and expanding financial support to more entrepreneurs than ever before. As small business owners, from all walks of life, get the help they need, the organization’s hope is that they can play a part in creating new jobs and promoting innovation in America’s booming business market."
