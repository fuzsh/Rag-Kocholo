We had a very interesting call between one of our customers and our consultants this week that could prove useful to all. The customer had planned to invest in their ERP as it had been 3 years since they had implemented NetSuite, and the business had grown significantly since then. What was discovered by our consultants; - The data strategy had changed significantly since implementing and they were over due a data cleanse/archiving. - Their ERP system documentation was outdated, this is a great place to start before any project or program. - They had built up a cluster of outdated reports that were no longer fit for purpose, making the system less user friendly for its employees. - Business growth and the need for quick results had built up technical debt. If this sounds all too familiar, we should connect. Our consultants are able to partner with our customers to perform an ERP health check to get this work completed ahead of any heavy investments in your ERP. Please reach out to me at steve.borner@empiric.com to find out how we can help. #netsuite #erp #healthcheck #consultant #netsuiteproject\n\nIt's Q4 at NetSuite!

Executives know that there's no better time to invest in software at Oracle NetSuite than between now and May 31st.

At C&J ERP Consulting we're highly experienced at optimising NetSuite. 👉 Streamline pain points 👉 Improve business productivity 👉 Increase efficiency 👉 Reduce costs potentially too... “Having gone live with NetSuite a few years ago, we needed help to optimise NetSuite and streamline specific pain points within the system. C&J were able to come in and quickly understand our business model, creating a project plan to help us get to where we needed to be. Particular focus on areas within finance, stock management, workflow automation and reporting has helped to free up time which can be used elsewhere in the business. This has now been implemented which has been well received by the team at Wholesale Domestic, giving them far more confidence in the NetSuite system. \"C&J ERP Consulting’s customer service skills and knowledge of NetSuite was excellent from start to finish. We now have an on-going relationship as we work on future projects to enhance the system as the business continues to grow.” Brian Toward, CEO, Wholesale Domestic Bathrooms See how we can help optimise your NetSuite system today and/or book a no-strings, free consultation>>\n\nJust this week, I found myself in a fascinating discussion with a potential client facing a pivotal choice: Oracle NetSuite, or a more budget-friendly alternative. It's a scenario where short-term cost savings conflict with long-term value. But the reality is, picking an ERP isn't just about the upfront price - it's about investing in your business's growth. The cheaper option may seem appealing now, but it often has limitations that can hold you back as your business evolves. Oracle NetSuite, while more expensive upfront, is designed to fit your needs and adapt as you expand. You don’t want to be doing an ERP implementation twice in a short period! In today's rapidly changing business world, being agile and able to scale is crucial for survival. NetSuite provides a future-proof solution that allows your business to thrive, take on new challenges, and move past limitations. Remember, it's not just about how much you spend, but what you gain - a flexible system that drives your business toward greater success, step-by-step. Find out more about NetSuite in my blog post!

Once you’ve implemented NetSuite, it becomes a living, breathing power tool in setting up your business for success. It’s instant access to knowing when your business is running as it should and when to gear up for some bumps. This is why it’s important to not only make the most out of it by customizing it but to make sure it (and your NetSuite system overall) is set up right from the moment of implementation. By doing so, you’ll not only ensure you’re getting the most out of your investment from the very beginning, but you’ll be able to run your business with confidence, knowing that you’ll be making the most out of your NetSuite investment every single day. The problem? Not everyone knows how to implement it correctly. NetSuite is a massive system meant to make massive changes in your business. And if you’re not certified, things can go left very quickly. That’s why we recommend saving yourself the trouble, frustration, and overwhelm. At Ekwani, we hold your hand through implementation every step of the way. And long afterward. To learn more about how we can take the burden of implementation off your shoulders, send us a DM or visit the link here: https://hubs.ly/Q02ngFx90 #erp #smallbusiness #netsuite #oracle #scalability"
