        "text": "With a Two-Year Revenue Increase of 330 Percent, SuiteCentric Charts a Path Toward Continued Strategic Growth\n\nCARLSBAD, Calif. – March 22, 2021 – SuiteCentric, an Oracle NetSuite Solution Provider, announced that it ranked No. 62 on the Inc. Magazine second-annual Inc. 5000 Regionals California list, one of the most prestigious rankings of the fastest-growing California-based private companies. Inspired by the annual Inc. 5000 franchise, this regional list represents a unique look at the most successful companies within the California economy’s most dynamic segment—its independent small businesses.\n\n“We are honored and grateful to be recognized among so many impressive companies throughout California,” said Adam Baruh, founder and CEO of SuiteCentric. “I’m most proud of my team’s dedication and resilience, particularly over the past year or so. Earning this is a testament to their hard work and commitment to our company philosophy of TransCAREncyTM.”\n\nThe companies on this list show stunning rates of growth across all industries in California. Between 2017 and 2019, these 250 private companies had an average growth rate of 535 percent, and in 2019 alone, they employed more than 40,000 people and added nearly $7 billion to the California economy. Companies based in major metro areas—Los Angeles, the Bay Area, and San Diego—brought in the highest overall revenue.\n\nComplete results of the Inc. 5000 Regionals California list can be found at https://www.inc.com/inc5000/regionals/california starting March 16, 2021\n\n“This list proves the power of companies in California no matter the industry,” says Inc. editor-in-chief Scott Omelianuk. “The impressive revenues and growth rates prove the insight and diligence of CEOs and that these businesses are here to stay.”\n\nAbout SuiteCentric\n\nSuiteCentric is an Oracle NetSuite Solution Provider, and winner of NetSuite’s Commerce Partner of the Year award in 2020.

To qualify, companies must have been founded and generated revenue by March 31, 2017. They had to be U.S.-based, privately held, for-profit, and independent—not subsidiaries or divisions of other companies—as of December 31, 2019. (Since then, a number of companies on the list have gone public or been acquired.) The minimum revenue required for 2017 is $100,000; the minimum for 2019 is $1 million. As always, Inc. reserves the right to decline applicants for subjective reasons."
