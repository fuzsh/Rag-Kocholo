        "text": "BDO Digital helps companies unleash the power of NetSuite by combining vast ERP implementation experience with a global team of advisory, tax, audit, quality, manufacturing, sourcing, change management, and technology professionals who will serve as your trusted digital transformation guides.\n\nGrowing companies are under pressure to scale growth, manage costs, and attract talent. To address these challenges while staying ahead of competitors, organizations need technology infrastructures and data that help them work in the present moment while also planning for success in the future.\n\nCompanies using on-premises software, spreadsheets, and basic accounting systems to run their growing operations may quickly find themselves at a disadvantage in the modern business world. With their data stored across multiple systems, these companies can struggle to get a complete, accurate view of their business. The structure presents other challenges as well:\n\nSpreadsheets can be subject to errors from inaccurate data entry and incorrect formulas.\n\nData silos interfere with good decision-making by isolating information.\n\nDifferent software solutions and maintaining their licenses can quickly become expensive.\n\nEmployees are also impacted when their companies continue to operate on older, disparate systems that don’t integrate with one another. Retrieving data from and switching between multiple systems is a tedious, time-consuming task, and the repetitious process pulls employee away from more valuable, knowledge-based work. Additionally, every time a data point is entered into a new system, there’s always the risk of error. This, in turn, can create issues within customer service, financial reporting, and compliance.\n\nBy implementing a cloud-based enterprise resource planning (ERP) solution like NetSuite, organizations can eliminate these problems, gain a unified view of all operational data, and improve overall efficiency levels. A complete suite of software applications, NetSuite brings all of a company’s data together into a single system that can also be integrated with existing applications — via the NetSuite Connector for example, a CRM like Salesforce or an e-commerce solution like Shopify.\n\nOnce in place, NetSuite gives team members access to all of the data they need from a single point of entry, thus saving time, reducing errors and improving decision-making across the entire organization. By moving to a single ERP, reducing the number of third-party applications, and utilizing a best-in-class solution, these companies can streamline their processes, automate reporting, and free up internal resources to focus on more value-added tasks.\n\nToday’s C-suite is increasingly called upon to grow revenue, control expenses, and manage cash. In addition, geopolitical uncertainty and hiring the right talent while participating in competitive markets add to the challenges executives must navigate in making difficult decisions. Addressing these issues and acting with the relevant information at their disposal requires technology that provides clear financial reporting, enhances operational visibility, and automates tasks that would otherwise be handled manually. An effective ERP system also helps leaders deal with concerns around off-system processing that inhibits data sharing, control, and efficiency, which can potentially result in errors, overspending, and other negative impacts.\n\nHow an ERP System Can Make the Difference\n\nMany companies start out running their business on standard accounting software coupled with spreadsheets. As they grow, and especially if they expand internationally and add another currency, they need to graduate to a solution with functionality for multi-subsidiary, multi-currency consolidation.\n\nBeyond changing exchange rates, as processes grow within the company, the business requires software that provides functionality for inventory management and costing. This provides the visibility companies require to ensure they have the right inventory in the right place, allowing both accounting and operations to understand the revenue and profit impact of decisions that affect supply chain strategy.\n\nFinally, companies planning for an IPO, or ones that have already gone public and are approaching SOX 404(b) thresholds, can become overwhelmed by reporting complexity and the requirements for data accuracy if there are too many disparate sources and systems. Because of this, implementing an ERP system essentially becomes an audit requirement to help ensure accuracy and timeliness in providing that data.\n\nBDO Digital Harnesses the Power of NetSuite\n\nAs a subsidiary of one of the world’s leading professional services firms, BDO Digital uses a holistic, industry-centric approach when helping companies gain competitive advantage in their respective industries.
