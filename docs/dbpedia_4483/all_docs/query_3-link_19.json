My read: Oracle’s admitting Shopify’s gaining ground. The TLDR of this announcement: if you are NetSuite/Oracle CDP customer, you can integrate that data with Shopify. But why though? The whole point of the suite Oracle Commerce + CDP + NetSuite = magic. The “better together” narrative doesn’t make sense. If you can also integrate the pieces with Shopify. So why are they announcing this partnership? Shopify wins 1-2 key accounts + helps bigger brands who use NetSuite’s ERP/CDP. Netsuite can't lose anymore ERP customers trying to make Oracle Suite a thing. Long term (10 years) though: Shopify eats this entire market. Klaviyo or Yotpo become the go-to CDP. The big question is: does anybody take out NetSuite? ERP is the last major key component in this race for Ent Shopify. And it's pretty clear Shopify’s not going to build it themselves. No app has come in and taken the dominant share there. Does NetSuite keep the crown or does someone disrupt them? #shopify\n\nGreat articulation of the opportunity in front of GoodDay Software by Jeremy Horowitz'. To disrupt Netsuite ERP in the Shopify ecosystem, we will build as closely and natively into Shopify as possible. This is to bring simplicity & ease of use to merchants who need these complex operating tools badly. Coming out of Shopify Editions (Summer 2024) yesterday, it is very clear to me that GoodDay Software and many others in the Shopify ecosystem are bringing innovation to the space. Here we go.\n\nDynamic Pricing with BigCommerce & NetSuite : Imagine offering exclusive discounts to your loyal customers, rewarding high-value groups with special pricing, and attracting new buyers with competitive deals.
