        "text": "RF-SMART and its subsidiaries and affiliates (\"us\", \"we\", or \"our\") are a provider of software and services that include cloud-based solutions (the \"Services\").\n\nThis Privacy Policy (“Policy”) informs you of our policies regarding how we collect, use and disclose Personal Information and how you can control its use. This Policy also describes our practices regarding information collected from our websites, your use of the Services, software and mobile apps, social media, e-mails and other activities that reference, link or are subject to this Policy (the “Sources”). For purposes of this Policy, ICS shall include RF-SMART, and its divisions, subsidiaries, successors, parent companies, and their employees, partners, principals, agents and representatives, and any third-party providers or sources of information or data. The Sources include, without limitation, our website located at www.rfsmart.com.\n\nChanges To This Privacy Policy\n\nThis Policy is effective as of the date set forth below. We reserve the right to update or change our Policy at any time and you should check this Policy periodically. This Policy will remain in effect except with respect to any changes in its provisions in the future, which will be in effect immediately after being posted on this page. If we make any material changes to this Policy, we may notify you, such as by using an email address you have provided us, or by placing a prominent notice on our website or via the Sources.\n\nInformation Collection and Use\n\nWhen accessing and using our Services and Sources, we may ask you to provide us with certain information that identifies you or relates to identifiable individuals (“Personal Information”) which may include, without limitation:\n\nYour name, address, email addresses, telephone number, title, employment, and other contact information and information about your company, business or employer;\n\nBehavioral or demographic information about you and others;\n\nInformation about your past, present and future software, service, produce and business activities and needs;\n\nPast and current transactional behavior;\n\nFinancial and payment information provided in connection with payments and transactions with us;\n\nInformation obtained from third parties.\n\nWe may also collect other information about your interaction and use of the Services and Sources which may include, without limitation, Log Data and Cookies. These are explained below. We may use, transfer, and disclose other information we collect for any purpose, except where applicable law requires otherwise. If we are required to treat other information as Personal Information under applicable law, then we will only use it in the same way that we are permitted to use and disclose Personal Information.\n\nLog Data\n\nWe may collect information that your browser sends whenever you visit or use our Sources or Services (\"Log Data\"). This Log Data may include information such as your computer's Internet Protocol (\"IP\") address, browser type, browser version, behavioral data such as the pages of our Services or Sources that you visit, the time and date of your visit, the time spent on those pages, searches you may have performed to reach our Sources, and other statistics.\n\nIn addition, we may use third party services such as Google Analytics that collect, monitor and analyze this type of information in order to increase the functionality of our Services or Sources. These third party service providers have their own privacy policies addressing how they use such information.\n\nCookies, Pixel Tags, and other Tracking Technologies\n\nWe and our advertising technology partners use cookies and similar technologies (e.g., pixels tags and device identifiers) to recognize you and/or your device(s) on, off and across different services and devices for the purposes specified above.\n\nCookies are small text files that contain a string of characters and uniquely identify a browser on a connected device. We or our business partners and vendors may use cookies to, among other things, track user trends and collect information about how you use our customers’ sites or interact with advertising. We may use remarketing services to advertise on third party web sites to you after you visited our Services. We, and our third party vendors, use cookies to inform, optimize and serve ads based on your past visits to our Services. Most browsers are initially configured to accept cookies by default. You may, however, be able to change your browser settings to cause your browser to refuse third-party cookies or to indicate when a third-party cookie is being sent. Check your browser’s “help” files to learn more about handling cookies.\n\nPixel Tags (also called web beacons or clear GIFs) are invisible 1 x 1 pixels that are placed on webpages that use this technology for marketing and measurement purposes. When you access these webpages, pixel tags generate a generic notice of the visit. Pixel tags can be used with cookies or alone. When used with cookies, pixel tags can track activity on a site by a particular device and provide relevant online advertising to you. When you turn off cookies or have opted out of cookies, pixel tags simply detect a unique website visit and how you interacted with the advertising but do not track an individual to provide relevant online advertising.\n\nWe may collect and share the physical location of your device for purposes consistent with this Policy, such as to provide you with personalized location-based services or content. In some instances, you may be permitted to allow or deny such use of your device’s location, but if you choose to deny such use, we may not be able to provide you with the applicable personalized services or content.\n\nWe may use a tracking technique that employs embedded URLs to allow use of the electronic Sources without cookies. Embedded URLs allow limited information to follow you as you navigate the electronic Sources.\n\nUse of Personal Information\n\nWe use Personal Information for the following purposes:\n\nTo Engage in Transactions\n\nWe may use your Personal Information in connection with licensing or providing our Services to you, including entering into agreements with you and conducting background and financial research on you and your business. This may also include the collection and use of financial and payment information as part of your payment to us.\n\nTo Provide Our Services to You and Monitor Compliance\n\nWe may use your Personal Information in connection with providing our Services to you and deliver our software and Services including, without limitation, the delivery, installation, implementation and configuration of our Services and software, consulting services and related customer and technical support, both on and off-site. If you download our software or use our Services, we may use Personal Information to confirm those activities, such as downloads and contract and licensing compliance. We may also use your Personal Information to provide you customer support and track your representatives and points of contact, and to deliver updates, patches, fixes and other services and communications.\n\nTo Develop Additional Services and Enhance your Experience\n\nWe may use your Personal Information in connection with our research and development and providing improvements, updates and changes to the Services. We may use information to analyze, develop, improve, and optimize the use, function and performance of our Services and Sources. For example, we may use this information to enhance yours and our other customer’s experiences with the Services and Sources.\n\nTo Market to You and Respond to Your Requests\n\nWe and our business partners may use your Personal Information to market products and services to you including, without limitation, to pass your contact information to our staff and business partners for follow-up, marketing and advertising purposes and to inform you about conference, activities and event. In connection with those efforts, we may use your Personal Information to interact with you on third party social media and social networks. We may use your Personal Information to contact you with newsletters, via email, marketing or promotional materials and other information that may be of interest to you. You may opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by contacting us.\n\nTo Manage Our Security and Protect Our Business\n\nWe may disclose your Personal Information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate to protect the health and safety of our employees and visitors, our physical and online operations, our property, rights, and privacy, and/or that of our affiliates, you or others. If you visit our offices, you may be photographed or videotaped or required to log your arrival and departure as part of maintaining the security of our facilities. Facility security photography will be treated as sensitive information and will only be used for security and investigation purposes. We may also use Personal Information in connection with maintaining the security and protection of our networks, systems, computers, websites, Services and Sources.\n\nTo Comply with Laws\n\nWe may disclose your Personal Information as we believe to be necessary or appropriate: (a) under applicable law, including laws outside your country of residence; (b) to comply with legal process; (c) to respond to requests from public and government authorities, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes; (d) to enforce our agreements between us or others; and (e) to allow us to pursue available remedies or limit the damages that we may sustain. Additionally, in the event of an actual or contemplated reorganization, merger, sale, joint venture, assignment, transfer or other disposition of all or any portion of our business, assets or stock (including in connection with any bankruptcy or similar proceedings), we may transfer or disclose the Personal Information we have collected to relevant third parties.\n\nTo Share with Third Parties\n\nWe may use or share Personal Information with third parties, such as vendors, subcontractors, business partners and consultants who provide services to us, such as credit card processing services, order fulfillment, analytics, marketing and advertising, event management, web site management, information technology and related infrastructure provision, hosting services, cloud services, customer service, email delivery, auditing, and other similar services. We may employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate our Services and Sources, to provide the Services or Sources on our behalf, to provide hosting or cloud-based services, to perform Service-related services and/or to assist us in analyzing how our Services and Sources are used. We may also use or share Personal Information with third parties as explained in other sections of this Policy.\n\nWe may share Personal Information as required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, when we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to government requests, including public and government authorities outside your country of residence, for national security and/or law enforcement purposes.\n\nWhen third parties are given access to Personal Information, we will take appropriate contractual, technical and organizational measures designed to ensure that Personal Information is processed only to the extent that such processing is necessary, consistent with this Policy, and in accordance with applicable law.\n\nThird Party Websites and Resources\n\nOur websites and other Sources may contain links to websites and resources owned by other individuals and entities, including those of our business affiliates, vendors, and sponsors, or may bring such third party material and resources into the Site via “inverse hyperlinks” and framing technology (collectively, the “Third Party Sites”). We have no access to or control over Third Party Sites or cookies used by Third Party Sites. When you access those links, you are leaving the Site and are accessing the Third Party Sites at your own risk. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of other Third Party Sites; nor do we endorse, and we are not responsible for, the information and content contained on Third Party Sites; nor are we responsible for maintaining links to or availability of Third Party Sites. We encourage you to check the privacy policies of Third Party Sites before disclosing any non-public personal information.\n\nOur Basis For Processing Information About You\n\nFor Personal Information collected about you in the EU, our basis for processing is the following:\n\nIn order to communicate adequately with you and to respond to your requests, we need to process information about you and therefore have a legitimate interest in processing this information.\n\nIn order to engage in transactions with customers, suppliers and business partners, and to process purchases and downloads of our products and services, we need to process information about you as necessary to enter into or perform a contract with you.\n\nWe process Personal Information for marketing and sales activities based on your consent where so indicated on our sites at the time your Personal Information was collected, or further to our legitimate interest to market and promote our products and services.\n\nWe rely on our legitimate interest to analyze, develop, improve and optimize our Services and Sources, products and services, and to maintain security.\n\nIn order to comply with applicable laws and regulations, such as to comply with a subpoena or other legal process, or to process an opt-out request.\n\nOur Retention Periods For Personal Information\n\nPersonal Information about you we collect to engage in transactions with our customers, suppliers and business partners, to perform Services, and to process purchases of our products and services, will be retained for the duration of the transaction or services period, or longer as necessary for record retention and legal compliance purposes.

Personal information needed to retain your opt-out preferences is retained for as is necessary to comply with applicable law.\n\nHow We Secure Your Personal Information\n\nWe strive to implement and maintain reasonable, commercially acceptable security procedures and practices appropriate to the nature of the information we store, in order to protect it from unauthorized access, destruction, loss, damage, alteration, use, modification, or disclosure, as well as all other forms of unlawful processing.\n\nHowever, please be aware that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and we are unable to guarantee the absolute security of the Personal Information we have collected from you.\n\nYour Opt-Out Choices\n\nWe enable you to opt out of marketing communications. If you have subscribed to or receive our marketing emails or other communications and wish to be removed from our mailing lists, you may unsubscribe at any time via the unsubscribe page linked to every email sent by our marketing automation system.\n\nSome non-marketing communications are not subject to general opt-out, such as communications related to software download, performance of Services by us and our vendors, sales transactions, software updates and other support related information, patches and fixes, conferences or events for which you have registered, disclosures to comply with legal requirements, and (where permitted by law) quality assurance surveys. Some additional communications with business partners are also not subject to general-opt out, including product alerts, updates, contractual marketing and sales materials, and other notices related to business partner status.\n\nIf you would like us to delete or stop using any Personal Information, and we can reasonably cooperate and comply, please contact us using the contact information below.\n\nSMS Terms of Service\n\nRF-SMART will allow you to opt-in to SMS services online through a form.
