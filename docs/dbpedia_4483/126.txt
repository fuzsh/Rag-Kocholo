NetSuite is the leading integrated cloud business software suite, including business accounting, ERP, CRM, and ecommerce software.

NetSuite is a full software-as-a-service (SaaS) enterprise resource planning (ERP) system that is used to manage all key processes in a single system.

NetSuite requires no hardware, no large upfront cost, or any long term maintenance fees.

NetSuite is cloud-based meaning it can scale infinitely with your business.

NetSuite’s Story (So Far!)

NetSuite was founded in 1998 by Evan Goldberg under the original name NetLedger, which offered web-hosted SaaS accounting software. In November 2016, Oracle acquired NetSuite for approximately $9.3 billion. NetSuite now operates as an independent GBU (global business unit) of Oracle and is managed by now Executive Vice President Evan Goldberg.

NetSuite’s History

Goldberg, a former VP of Oracle, was provided seed money for NetSuite (then NetLedger) by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison. Around that same time, Ellison also provided seed money to another one of his VP’s to go start a cloud technology company – Marc Benioff the founder of Salesforce.

NetSuite launched just ahead of Salesforce and to this day claims the title of “the first cloud company” which is an impressive title to hold in 2020.

In the early days, NetSuite was licensed to Oracle under the brand “The Oracle Small Business Suite” but that program was short-lived.

In 2002, Zach Nelson was appointed CEO after his experience leads him to believe that the cloud was “the final frontier of software” and all software would soon be delivered in a SaaS model. Under Nelson’s leadership, the company grew to over 5,000 people and ran up to a billion-dollar run-rate before the Oracle acquisition.
