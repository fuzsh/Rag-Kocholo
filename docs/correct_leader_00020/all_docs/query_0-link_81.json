        "text": "The office of East Timor's President Jose Ramos Horta has scotched suggestions he is preparing to quit following an attempt on his life.\n\nThe 58-year-old Nobel laureate, who is recovering in Darwin after being shot by rebels outside his East Timor residence, had hinted in a media interview that he may not serve the full term of his presidency when he returns home.\n\n\"I will address the parliament when I return and I will not promise the country that I will serve the full term,\" Ramos Horta told The Australian.\n\nBut he would consider his \"responsibilities to the people\" before making a decision.\n\n\"I have responsibilities to Australia and Indonesia because they trust me,\" he said.\n\n\"And before I take a step in resigning I have to consider all of these implications, the people of East Timor, our neighbours.\"\n\nRamos Horta's media officer Joel Pereira later rejected reports Ramos Horta would quit.\n\n\"The interpretation of this interview is incorrect,\" he said.\n\n\"This is unfair ... this is not correct at all.\"\n\nRamos Horta took over as East Timor's prime minister amid a wave of violence in 2006 which killed 37 and forced thousands to flee their homes for refugee camps.\n\nHe was elevated to the presidency of East Timor in a landslide election win a year ago, and has been key in efforts to stabilise and develop the tiny nation.\n\nInternational Centre for Transitional Justice senior associate Galuh Wandita said the president was key to the future of the country.\n\n\"Obviously Jose has been a really crucial part in the whole process in East Timor, from the days during the Indonesian occupation and I think in recent years he's shown leadership in trying to reconcile the different factions, and different interests in East Timor,\" Wandita said.\n\n\"His own track record in terms of human rights, its obviously still very important for East Timor, particularly as it tries to come to terms with this new crisis and the attempted assassinations.\n\n\"The news comes as a real surprise and obviously East Timor would lose a lot if he steps down.\"\n\nEast Timor's constitution states that if the president resigns, new elections would be held within 90 days, and a new president appointed for a five-year term.\n\nIf there is \"imminent exceptional situations of war or protracted emergency\" regular elections would not be held and instead a president would be elected by the National Parliament from among its members within 90 days.\n\nOpposition Fretilin MP and former prime minister Estansilau de Silva said there were others who were capable of stepping in if the president decided to quit.\n\n\"It's not even been one year in office yet - but of course as we have said in the past no one is irreplaceable and if there is an election we have people capable to run, and I am sure they would do the job accordingly,\" he said.\n\n\"I am pretty sure he will not resign immediately, but we are not in a position to force him to continue."
