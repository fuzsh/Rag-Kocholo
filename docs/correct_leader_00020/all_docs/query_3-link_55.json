Earlier in the morning, President Ramos-Horta had a new orchid hybrid, the Dendrobium José Ramos-Horta, named in his honour. To commemorate the 20th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Timor-Leste, President Ramos-Horta planted a Diospyros ferrea tree native to the region at the Singapore Botanic Gardens.\n\nDuring the meetings, both sides affirmed the warm and longstanding relations between Singapore and Timor-Leste, which date back to before Timor-Leste’s independence. President Halimah and Prime Minister Lee welcomed the first-ever State Visit from Timor-Leste by President Ramos-Horta. They reaffirmed Singapore’s commitment to support Timor-Leste’s development through capacity building programmes, and welcomed more Timorese officials to participate in the Singapore Cooperation Programme. Prime Minister Lee reaffirmed Singapore’s in-principle support for Timor-Leste’s ASEAN membership and Singapore’s commitment to work constructively with other ASEAN Member States on an objective criteria-based Roadmap for Timor-Leste’s ASEAN membership.\n\nTo support Timor-Leste in building its capacity to prepare for ASEAN membership, Singapore will launch a special “Singapore-Timor-Leste ASEAN Readiness Support” (STARS) package. The STARS package will comprise courses for more than 300 Timor-Leste officials in two priority areas, namely ASEAN knowledge and skills training, as well as education capacity building.\n\nPresident Halimah will host a State Banquet for President Ramos-Horta this evening.\n\n. . . . .\n\nMINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS\n\nSINGAPORE\n\n8 DECEMBER 2022\n\nAnnex\n\nFACTSHEET FOR THE ORCHID NAMED AFTER\n\nHIS EXCELLENCY DR JOSÉ RAMOS-HORTA, PRESIDENT OF THE DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF TIMOR-LESTE\n\nAND TREE SPECIES PLANTED BY PRESIDENT RAMOS-HORTA\n\nDendrobium José Ramos-Horta\n\nParentage: Dendrobium Kiyoshi Blue × Dendrobium taurinum\n\nThis is a robust and free-flowering orchid hybrid.
