I have known Horta and his family for many years, and I have seen him up and personal in all sorts of different situations. While sometimes his idealism still surprises me, Timor-Leste needs his huge international credibility and network in order to get through this critical period in the country’s history. He is the only morally honest politician that I have ever met, and his humility is legendary. For example, one time, at his house - where there are no photos of him with world dignitaries - I asked where does he keep his Nobel Prize. He answered \"in a box on the floor over there\". Years ago, when he was recovering from a near-fatal assassination attempt, I suggested to him that he should get out of Timor-Leste, and become one of the United Nations big shots (which he could have done at the time) - but he chose to go back to his house on the hill in Dili, because as he told me, \"my job is not yet done\". Now that he has endorsement from the charismatic Xanana Gusmao (who I first met in prison in 1998), hopefully Jose Ramos Horta will return to the Presidency of Timor-Leste. https://lnkd.in/eVNUzHJ4"
