        "text": "Truth be told, just over a year ago, I knew little of Timor-Leste – only that it was a small country located in Southeast Asia at the eastern end of Indonesia, and its colonial past. Though, after working on several projects related to Timor-Leste and interacting with its people, I had the privilege of learning a lot more about the country than I had previously imagined – its unique coffee species, beautiful handcrafted tais clothes, pristine beaches, vibrant democracy and, of course, how the Timorese are one of the friendliest groups of people I have met.\n\nAt the same time, I also learned about the struggles that Timor-Leste faces – extreme vulnerability to weather shocks and climate change, high levels of poverty, hunger and malnutrition, and a series of economic challenges due to its heavy reliance on oil to fund the state budgets. However, they have taken steps to diversify their economy to achieve sustainable economic development and growth. For example, Timor-Leste kicked off the construction of the Tibar port in 2017 to boost international trade; and the recent construction of Timor Plaza to attract foreign visitors will help develop the tourism sector. Additionally, Timor-Leste is also actively participating in the Dubai Expo 2022 to showcase to the world its non-oil economy and attract foreign investors – be it for agriculture (especially coffee), tourism or fisheries. Economic diversification is also supported by Timor-Leste’s efforts to join regional and international groupings to expand its market reach, notably to the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) and World Trade Organisation (WTO). These initiatives are supported by international donors to ensure financing for development. For example, Australia is working closely with the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport to improve the education sector - by helping to build school leadership and teacher capacity.\n\nMore importantly though, amidst the ongoing development activities, Timor-Leste recently concluded its presidential election on 19 April and José Ramos Horta will be inaugurated on 20 May. At this juncture, one may ask: what may this change mean for Timor-Leste?\n\nIn his campaign, Horta shared his intentions to restore Timor-Leste’s political stability, as well as reduce poverty, improve health services for mothers and children, and create more jobs. Another key priority is for Timor-Leste to become an ASEAN member as early as 2023 – something that Horta also pushed for during his first presidential term in 2011. Becoming an ASEAN member would push Timor-Leste to improve its trade infrastructure, which will accelerate growth and economic diversification. Beyond economic benefits, there are also social benefits that Horta wants to highlight, as ASEAN could offer Timor-Leste more mobility, educational, and capacity building opportunities for students, young people, and businesses.\n\nBeing a well-known Nobel Laureate (for peace) who played a critical role in the East Timorese resistance during Indonesia’s occupation, Horta’s re-election has also drawn international attention, with many world leaders, such as from the European Union, New Zealand, and Singapore quickly congratulating him for his victory. This positive attention and his existing good relations with these country leaders could be used to move the needle in Horta’s key social and economic priorities through building bilateral relations to attract foreign investments and accelerate Timor-Leste’s accession to ASEAN. This is clearly important for Horta as one of the first things he did after being elected was to have meetings with the ASEAN delegates. For example, with Cambodia, where he expressed Timor-Leste’s intent to have a stronger trade relationship with the country.\n\nHowever, continued political tensions between the two main parties, the National Congress of the Reconstruction of Timor-Leste (CNRT) and the Revolutionary Front for an Independent East Timor (Fretilin) stand in the way of making timely progress. Not long ago, in early 2020, a political deadlock resulted in the government’s inability to pass the budget in the parliament which led to a political and economic crisis. With this in mind, Horta must find a way to work with both parties and find common ground to ensure that he can start his presidential term with a good and stable political foundation. While dissolving parliament is a possibility, doing so could increase the risk of political unrest. Alternatively, Horta could pursue a dialogue with all political parties in order to find a joint solution – a practice that he actively used in his previous presidential term to effectively solve challenges.\n\nOverall, it is critical for Timor-Leste to improve communication and build sustainable good relations among the political parties that will survive government changes. Having political stability and unity will allow Timor-Leste to deal with problems such as poverty and health crises, attract foreign investors and be seen as a reliable partner to Southeast Asia and the world. Therefore, the integral step here is to find a way to restore political stability, cooperation and seamless coordination, for Horta to focus on the work he promised to do for the people and the economy."
