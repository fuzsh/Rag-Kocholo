        "text": "Timor-Leste’s Tibar Bay Port has recently been fully opened. The Timor-Leste government and the owner, French Group Bollore, jointly celebrated the port’s full opening. East Timorese President Jose Ramos Horta attended the ceremony, as well as East Timorese Prime Minister Taur Matan Luak, Minister of Transport and Communications Jose Agustinio da Silva and Chinese Ambassador to East Timor Xiao Jianguo.\n\nAt the ceremony, Horta congratulated the full opening of Tibar Bay Port and thanked CHEC for actively performing its duties as the general contractor and striving to achieve a high-quality performance of the contract. Timor-Leste National News Agency and other media made special reports.\n\nTimor-Leste is the 104th country to introduce ZPMC products. At the end of 2020, the company signed an equipment procurement contract with French Group Bollore, including purchasing two quay cranes and four electrical tire cranes. These pieces of equipment adopt the latest global port crane technology and control system. The quay cranes have a front outreach of 50m and a rated lifting capability of 65 tons under the lifting device, and can easily realize the loading and unloading of Post-Panamax container liners; These quay cranes have a span of 26m and a lifting height of 18.2m. In addition, they adopt the latest cable drum power supply system of ZPMC and have the characteristics of energy saving, emission reduction, low carbon and environmental protection.\n\nThe Diba Container Terminal Project is the largest PPP project since the founding of Timor-Leste. The main construction content of it is to build a 630-meter terminal, including a 7,000 TEU berth and a 3,500 TEU berth, 3.5 million m3 of dredging, 27 hectares of land reclamation and related housing construction, a storage yard, and other supporting facilities.\n\nThe maximum annual cargo throughput of the terminal can reach 1 million containers. When fully operational, it will become the only logistics centre for East Timor’s maritime freight trade and commerce, which will greatly promote the economic development of East Timor and play a key role in the trade and commerce between countries along the Belt and Road."
