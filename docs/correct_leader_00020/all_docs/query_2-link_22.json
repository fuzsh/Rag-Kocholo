        "text": "(born 1949). After the Indonesian invasion of the tiny Southeast Asian island of East Timor, José Ramos-Horta was exiled and became his country’s leading spokesman. Ramos-Horta devoted his life to speaking out against the human rights abuses of the totalitarian Indonesian forces. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his commitment to this cause.\n\nJosé Ramos-Horta was born on December 26, 1949. His mother, Natalina, was an East Timorese woman whose family had been killed in the brutal occupation of the island by the Japanese during World War II. José’s father had been exiled from Portugal to East Timor, which was then a Portuguese colony, for joining the fight against the Spanish dictator Francisco Franco.\n\nYoung José grew up in different places on the island. When he was 7 years old, he was sent to Soibada, a Roman Catholic mission school in a remote village. José found friends and role models in some of the priests who taught him, while he lived in fear of others. Portuguese was considered the only acceptable language at school, and the young students were often beaten for speaking Titun or other Timorese languages. José was rarely able to see his parents, who lived far away.\n\nHe completed his studies at Soibada when he was 14, and unlike most of the other students he went on to high school, where he earned good grades in languages, history, and philosophy. While out on the town one night in 1970, Ramos-Horta made some anti-Portuguese statements among his friends. He was arrested by the Portuguese security police, interrogated for six hours, and subsequently exiled to Mozambique. He worked there as a journalist. When his father died, he was not allowed to go home for the funeral.\n\nRamos-Horta returned to East Timor in 1972 to find his country increasingly discontented with the nature of Portuguese colonialism. A nascent nationalist movement was taking shape and Ramos-Horta emerged as a leader of one of the groups, the Revolutionary Front of Independent East Timor, known by its Portuguese acronym FRETILIN.\n\nAs part of FRETILIN, Ramos-Horta traveled throughout East Timor listening to the people and encouraging a vision of a democratic government. Literacy campaigns were launched, and new schools and health centers were built. Reasoning that the Indonesians, who had recently thrown off their own colonial ties, would be sympathetic to their cause, Ramos-Horta traveled to Jakarta in the hope of garnering support for FRETILIN.\n\nIn 1974, internal struggles in Portugal caused Portuguese troops to begin withdrawing from East Timor. In elections in the first half of 1975, FRETILIN and another pro-independence party were clear winners. On November 28, 1975, FRETILIN declared East Timor independent from Portugal. But by that time, it had already become apparent that the Indonesian government would oppose East Timorese independence.\n\nLess than two weeks after FRETILIN’s declaration of independence, Indonesian paratroopers landed in Dili, the capitol of East Timor. Claiming that they were there to “restore order” and prevent Communists from taking control, Indonesian forces invaded the island with guns, bombs, and policies even more restrictive than those the Portuguese had imposed. Fearing for his life, Ramos-Horta fled to Australia three days before the takeover. Most of Ramos-Horta’s colleagues were slaughtered during the invasion, and Ramos-Horta was named the new foreign minister of FRETILIN.\n\nIn the years following the Indonesian invasion, hundreds of thousands of East Timorese died. Disease and war-induced famine wiped out almost one third of the island’s population in 20 years. People could not travel, or speak or gather freely. Murder, rape, beatings, and torture were common, and dismembered corpses were displayed after government massacres to discourage demonstrations and protests. In 1975, Ramos-Horta’s 17-year-old sister and 15-year-old brother were killed by Indonesian air assaults on civilians. In 1978, another brother was captured and executed.\n\nAs foreign minister of FRETILIN, Ramos-Horta was charged with the task of drawing international attention to his country’s plight and bringing about a peaceful resolution to the crisis. At age 25 he became the youngest person to address the United Nations Security Council, arguing passionately for the withdrawal of Indonesian forces. Eventually, the various East Timorese factions resisting Indonesia united under an umbrella group known by its acronym CNRM, of which Ramos-Horta was the main spokesman.\n\nHorta traveled around the world for the next 20 years, trying to keep the hope of East Timorese independence from fading away. He persuaded the United Nations (UN) to issue several declarations against the Indonesian invasion, and he succeeded in preventing most countries from recognizing Indonesia as a legitimate authority in East Timor. Although he took a position as executive director of the diplomacy training program at New South Wales University in Australia, in reality most of his time was spent presenting information about the East Timor situation to foreign governments.\n\nWhile in exile, Ramos-Horta pursued studies in law, international relations, and peace studies. He wrote extensively on international affairs and wrote a book on the East Timor crisis, ‘FUNU: The Unfinished Saga of East Timor’, which was published in 1987. He created a peace plan that called for a two-year, gradual withdrawal of Indonesian forces and a UN-sponsored referendum on self-rule. Ramos-Horta was the recipient of the Professor Thorolf Rafto Human Rights Prize in 1993 and the Gleitzman Foundation Award in 1995. He was also awarded the International Activist of the Year award in Lisbon that year.\n\nIn 1996, Ramos-Horta was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize jointly with East Timorese Bishop Carlos Belo for his work. The Indonesian government was infuriated by the awarding of the prize and denied that they repressed the East Timorese. In their view, it was Ramos-Horta who had manipulated the people for his own selfish aims. Ramos-Horta expressed hope that the Nobel Prize would help draw attention to human rights abuses and help bring an end to Indonesian rule. “Empires have melted away,” he said. “We are used to valiant talk by dictators. We are patient.”"
