        "text": "DILI, East Timor — East Timor independence leader and Nobel laureate Jose Ramos-Horta is set to be the country’s next president, with the final count showing he has secured 62 percent of the vote, according to data from the country’s elections agency.\n\nTimorese went to the polls in the half-island nation of 1.3 million people on Tuesday, choosing between Ramos-Horta and ex-guerrilla fighter President Francisco “Lu Olo” Guterres.\n\nWith 100 percent of the votes counted, Ramos-Horta had a strong lead with 62.09 percent of the votes, while Lu Olo had 37.91 percent, according to data from the election administration agency.\n\nDownload the NBC News app for breaking news and politics\n\nRamos-Horta, 72, is one of East Timor’s best known political figures and previously served as foreign minister, prime minister and then the country’s second president, from 2007 to 2012.\n\nHe was a co-recipient of the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996 for his efforts to bring a peaceful resolution to a guerrilla war in East Timor against Indonesia’s occupation of the former Portuguese colony.\n\nIn the first round of the election in April, he narrowly missed securing an outright majority. An Australian academic calculated that he needed just 30,000 additional votes to secure victory in Tuesday’s second round.\n\nSpeaking after voting near his home in the capital of Dili, Ramos-Horta said he was “very confident” he would win but would await the final results.\n\nAfter years of political tensions between major parties, this election has been widely viewed as crucial to stability. Ramos-Horta has suggested he may use presidential powers to dissolve Parliament and bring forward a general election scheduled for next year.\n\nEast Timor’s first president, Xanana Gusmao, is backing Ramos-Horta in this election and has described the current government as “constitutionally illegitimate.”\n\nLu Olo, the incumbent, refused to swear in several ministers from Gusmao’s political party on the grounds they were facing legal investigations, including for alleged corruption.\n\nThe next president will be sworn in on May 20, the 20th anniversary of East Timor’s restoration of independence."
