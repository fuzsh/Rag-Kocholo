        "text": "José Ramos-Horta\n\nNobel Lecture\n\nNobel Lecture, December 10, 1996\n\nSuas Majestades, Honoráveis Membros do Comité Nobel da Paz, Senhores Presidentes, Senhores Primeiros Ministros, Excelências:\n\nCom vossa permissão as minhas primeiras palavras serão na lingua de Camões, Fernando Pessoa, Agostinho Neto, Jorge Amado, Xanana Gusmão.\n\nApesar da brutal colonização Indonésia e da repressão cultural dos últimos 21 anos, da proibição de uma lingua e cultura que chegaram à nossa região há cerca de 500 anos, em Timor Leste esta língua secular ainda persiste teimosamente.\n\nSendo o segundo timorense de nacionalidade portuguesa a ser honrado com o Prémio Nobel da Paz, o primeiro é o nosso respeitado e venerado bispo Dom Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo, faltaria à minha herança histórica e consciência se não começasse esta minha intervenção na língua que hoje une mais de 200 milhões de pessoas nas cinco regiões do mundo.\n\nÉ com um profundo sentimento de humildade que me associo aqui a Dom Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo para receber o Prémio Nobel da Paz 1996 que foi outorgado ao povo de Timor Leste.\n\nRegisto a minha eterna gratidão àqueles que me, propuseram para este prémio. Estou Ihes para sempre moralmente endividado e asseguro que as modestas dádivas de saúde e inteligência que Deus me deu serão sempre postas ao serviço da paz e justiça para o meu povo e para a causa da paz, liberdade e democracia em todas as latitudes onde a minha fraca voz possa ser ouvida.\n\nApenas par razões práticas vou continuar a minha intervenção na língua inglesa.\n\nI will now resume my speech in English\n\nYour Majesties, Honourable Members of the Nobel Committee, Presidents, Prime Ministers, Excellencies:\n\nWith your permission, my first words will be in the language of Camões, Fernando Pessoa, Agostinho Neto, Jorge Amado and Xanana Gusmão.\n\nIn spite of the brutal Indonesian colonisation and cultural repression of the past 21 years that attempted to eradicate a language and culture that reached our region almost 500 centuries ago, in East Timor this rich centuries-old language survives stubbornly.\n\nBeing the second East Timorese of Portuguese nationality to be honoured with the Nobel Peace Prize (the first is our respected and revered Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo), I would be failing my own historical heritage and conscience if I were to start this Nobel lecture in another language other than in the language that unites more than 200 million people in the five regions of the world.\n\nIt is with a deep feeling of humility that I join today with Bishop Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo to receive the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize that has been bestowed on the people of East Timor.\n\nMy eternal gratitude to those who nominated me. I am for ever morally indebted to, and I can assure them, that God’s modest gifts of health and wisdom to me will always be put to the service of peace and justice not only for my country and people but also for the cause of peace, freedom and democracy everywhere where my faint voice can be heard.\n\nMy deepest appreciation goes to the Nobel Committee for having chosen us for the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize. Your generosity in thinking of the wretched of the earth, and your courage in standing up to the might of States, the cynicism and indifference of too many and betrayal by some, tells also a lot about the soul and history of courage of this great country of yours that fought bravely during World War II.\n\nIn recent years Norway has played a central role in fostering dialogue and peace among historical enemies. In the Middle East and Central America, your discreet nature, determination and creativity have proven that some of the world’s seemingly intractable conflicts can be resolved when there is an honest mediator and when the parties in the conflict are willing to end the war.\n\nSmall countries like Norway, Costa Rica and Portugal, and others, can succeed in mediating conflicts when mighty powers failed. Diplomacy and mediation are not prerogatives of the major powers. The small and medium-size countries without ambitions to a neo-imperial role and whose strength is their moral integrity are best placed to open dialogue among the parties in a conflict.\n\nThe East Timorese Church\n\nThe real winner of the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize is our spiritual leader, Dom Carlos Filipe Ximenes Belo. He is the embodiment of the East Timorese people’s resilience, moral rectitude, dignity and identity, and its long quest for peace and freedom. In Dom Carlos the people of East Timor have found spiritual comfort and some sense of security from the daily threats to their very existence.\n\nThe people of East Timor owe almost everything to their Church. Hence, the 1996 Nobel Peace Prize is a tribute to the whole church, the courageous priests, nuns and lay workers and the people of East Timor.\n\nMy share of the Nobel Peace prize will go entirely to a Foundation to be called Peace and Democracy Dom Martinho da Costa Lopes. I know this is too small a tribute to this great man who gave his life to his church and people.\n\nThe solidarity movement\n\nI would like also to express my gratitude to three organisations that in the past honoured my people with less well-known awards but with equal importance for our people. To Professor Thoralf Rafto Human Rights Foundation from Bergen, Gleitsman Foundation, from California, and the UN-Represented Nations and Peoples Organisation (UNPO) based in The Hague, goes my profound gratitude.\n\nWith the men, women and children in many parts of the world who have given us so many years of their lives I wish to share this moment of joy. Without the generous solidarity movement we would be even poorer and alone. Some of our good friends have passed away from this earth: Denis Freney, Michelle Turner, Michel Robert, Carlos Vilares, the little and beautiful Sarah Taylor whom God took away at age 15. We will remember them forever.\n\nAngola, Cap Verde, Guinea Bissau, Mozambique, São Tomé and Príncipe\n\nMy special greetings of friendship and eternal gratitude to my good friend, President Joaquim Chissano of Mozambique, for having taken the trouble to fly to Oslo to be with us.\n\nYou have been with us in our most lonely years when the rest of the world pretended we did not exist or offered us advice on how best to surrender. From this Noble rostrum I bow to your late predecessor, Samora Moisés Machel, one of the greatest men Africa has known.\n\nMy special greetings and deepest gratitude to presidents José Eduardo dos Santos of Angola, Mascarenhas Monteiro of Cape Verde, Nino Vieira of Guinea-Bissau, and Miguel Trovoada of São Tomé and Príncipe for their friendship and generosity.\n\nYour peoples and countries have been with us through our lonely years and I believe that you will be with us still in the years to come.\n\nTo the people of Angola who have suffered beyond imagination and are still in a painful process of national reconciliation, I extend our solidarity and friendship.\n\nAngola paid a heavy price for the liberation of Namibia and South Africa. Yet there has not been enough recognition of the enormous contribution that the two lusophone countries, Angola and Mozambique, gave to the liberation of Southern Africa.\n\nPortugal\n\nI wish to state from this august rostrum the eternal gratitude of the people of East Timor and my own to the people of Portugal, the President, our good friend Dr. Jorge Sampaio and his predecessor, Dr. Mário Soares, a man of principles and compassion.\n\nThrough Your Excellency, Mr. President, I humbly ask you to convey to your wonderful and generous people, members of Parliament and government, past and present, our most heartfelt appreciation for your gallant efforts in support of our struggle.\n\nFor many years you fought a lonely battle in the European Union against the indifference and even hostility of some of your partners. Yon have shown not only to us the East Timorese but to other smaller nations in the world that principles and morality have not been taken over completely by mercantile interests.\n\nBrazil\n\nI recently visited Brazil and was warmly welcomed by everyone. I humbly ask President Jose Sarney to convey to President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and through him to all the people of Brazil our admiration and affection for your great country and people. My warmest greetings to Betinho, Dom Paulo Evaristo and Dom Helder Camara, the conscience of the poor of Brazil and the world.\n\nYour Majesties:\n\nThis speech belongs to someone else who should be here today. He is an outstanding man of courage, tolerance and statesmanship. Yet, this man is in prison for no crime other than his ideas and vision of peace, freedom and dignity of his people.\n\nXanana Gusmão, leader of the people of East Timor, remains incommunicado in a prison thousands of miles away from his country. His trial in 1993 was universally condemned as a charade and was no more valid than the Dutch imprisonment and trial of the late President Sukarno, founding father of the Indonesian Republic.\n\nI bow to Xanana and through him to my good friends Nino Konis Santana, David Alex, Tahur Matan Ruak, Fernando Araújo and all East Timorese prisoners of conscience in jails in East Timor and Indonesia, to the thousands of victims of torture, widows and orphans. I bow to the memory of Sabalae and the thousands of our dead.\n\nThrough Xanana I bow to my people with profound respect, loyalty and humility because they are the martyrs, the real heroes and peace-makers.\n\nThe New Order regime and the Indonesian people\n\nThe East Timorese are not the exclusive victims of the Indonesian New Order regime installed in 1965. For more than 30 years, the Indonesian people have known massacres, imprisonment, torture, bans on writers, journalists, academics and labour leaders. Moslems, Catholics, Buddhists and Hindus have all known their share of repression. The only non-discriminatory policy of the New Order regime is when it comes to repression.\n\nI pay tribute to the many tens of thousands of Indonesians who died in their own struggle for freedom and democracy, who languished in the jails of the New Order, or were forced into exile in China, Albania, USSR and Western Europe. I met many of them over the years and shared long hours of conversation about our people’s suffering and dreams.\n\nThe lessons of the Jewish holocaust\n\nIn 1939, a few months before the outbreak of World War II, Harry Truman read a passionate message from President Roosevelt to the “National Meeting for Moral Rearmament” held in Washington.\n\nThe same time as the conference delegates were listening and applauding President Roosevelt’s moral speech, 900 Jewish refugees on a boat from Germany anchored off Florida were waiting for a decision from Washington as to whether they should find sanctuary in the US or be sent back.\n\nFinally, word came that their application for refugee status had been denied. The desperate refugees did not convince the morally courageous delegates to the “National Meeting for Moral Rearmament” that they had a valid fear of persecution. The 900 men, women and children were sent back to Germany. Many ended up in Hitler’s death camps.\n\nMore than half a century after the Jewish holocaust and centuries after the genocide of the indigenous peoples of Australia and the Americas, the same attitude that has allowed these crimes to take place persists today.\n\nOpinion-makers and leaders, academics, writers and journalists who pretend to be objective and neutral in the face of racism and discrimination, the rape of a small nation by a larger power, the persecution of a weaker people by a ruthless army must share the guilt. No amount of intellectual argument will suffice to erase their responsibility.\n\nSynagogues are still being desecrated. Gypsies are still discriminated against. Indigenous peoples continue to see their ancestral land taken over by developers, their culture and beliefs, and their very existence reduced to a tourist commodity.\n\nLike the Jews and Armenians in the past, like the Kurdish, Gypsies, Tibetans, Aborigines of Australia, Maoris of Aotearoa (New Zealand), Kanakis of New Caledonia, the peoples of Western Sahara, and the Indigenous peoples of the Americas, the East Timorese are a mere footnote of history, an expendable people.\n\nCold War footnote\n\nThe conflict in East Timor can be traced back to the political context of the Cold War.\n\nYon might recall a picture that made headlines in the spring of 1975. I refer to the picture of an American helicopter landing on the rooftop of the IKS Embassy in Saigon to rescue remaining diplomats, CIA operatives and a few privileged South Vietnamese stooges as Saigon fell to the Vietcong. Cambodia and Laos followed. This picture illustrated better than a thousand words the ignominious American retreat from Indochina.\n\nIn another continent, in the horn of Africa, the longest reigning US ally, emperor Haile Selassie of Ethiopia, had been overthrown a year earlier by radical army officers. Further south, the Portuguese empire had collapsed. These events seemed to confirm Lyndon B. Johnson’s domino theory which was the rationale for US intervention in Indochina.\n\nIt was in this geopolitical context that President Gerald Ford and his Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, visited Jakarta in early December 1975 as part of an Asian tour to reassure leaders of the region that the US would continue to honour its security commitments in Asia.\n\nThe invasion of East Timor which took place within hours of Ford’s departure from Jakarta was a mere footnote in the Cold War events of 1975. Thousands of East Timorese who died in the days, weeks, months and years that followed were mere footnotes to the post-Vietnam and Cold War.\n\nInviolability of colonial boundaries\n\nOne and a half years before these events, in June 1974, I visited Jakarta, in my capacity as Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Timorese Social Democratic Association, that had just been created, less than a month earlier. I had the privilege of meeting with the then Foreign Minister of Indonesia, Mr. Adam Malik. After our third round of talks, Mr. Malik addressed to me a letter which read in part:\n\nThe independence of every country is the right of every nation, with no exception for the people of (East) Timor;\n\n… whoever will govern in Timor in the future after independence can be assured that the government of Indonesia will always strive to maintain good relations, friendship and co-operation for the benefit of both countries.\n\nThe following year, in April 1975, I again visited Indonesia and met with President Suharto’s senior adviser, Gen. Ali Mortopo, to whom I reiterated our collective desire to develop friendly relations with Indonesia. Gen. Mortopo reassured me that Indonesia harboured no territorial ambitions over East Timor. However, we soon learned that the word of an Indonesian general or diplomat can be broken as easily as it is spoken.\n\nSome simple but fundamental issues need to be addressed. Does Indonesia have a valid historical claim to East Timor?\n\nThe current boundary of the Republic of Indonesia is a product of the Dutch East Indies administration. West New Guinea was absorbed by the Republic not because of a reasonable historical, cultural, ethnic kinship or geographic continuity. The only link that justified the annexation was West New Guinea’s brief colonisation by the Dutch.\n\nThe arbitrary carving up of Africa at the Berlin Conference can be blamed for some of Africa’s problems today but respect for the colonial boundaries, as unfair as most might be, has provided some peace and stability and kept most of Africa, Latin America and Asia from disintegrating.\n\nSaddam Hussein of Iraq attempted to redraw the map and rectify what he perceived to be an unfair colonial legacy by invading Kuwait. Iran has longstanding claims over Bahrain. In Latin America there are some inter-state territorial disputes as a result of perceived unfair border delimitation.\n\nThe right of peoples to self-determination\n\nFrom the Chittagon Hill Tracts in Bangladesh to Bougainville, Kurdistan, Sri Lanka, India, Tibet, Chechnya, Ogoni, West Papua, millions of peoples seek to assert their most fundamental rights and if we attempt to find a common denominator for the problems I have just listed there is one: the right of peoples to self-determination.\n\nIn most cases the demands are not for secession. They are about their survival as a people with a language and a culture, with their land and environment protected from rapacious multinationals. Only when these basic demands are not met has there been recourse to other forms of struggle with an escalation in their demands.\n\nWhile self-determination in the de-colonisation process of the non-self-governing territories almost always led to independence, this is not the case in most of the conflicts of today. The cases of Western Sahara and East Timor, are the two most salient failure’s of decolonization. In the case of Western Sahara, the UN has allowed itself to be a pawn in the machinations of a minor regional power.\n\nThe preservation of the territorial integrity of a country can be achieved only if those in power are sensitive to the basic demands and aspirations of the many indigenous peoples and nationalities that make up the country.\n\nBrute force might silence and keep dormant the dreams and aspirations of a people but the anger simmering for decades will inevitably resurface and break-up the country.\n\nThe right of the people of East Timor to self-determination\n\nThe right of the people of East Timor to self-determination is widely recognised. Apart from the former Spanish territory of Western Sahara, East Timor is the largest non-self-governing territory in the UN GA decolonization list which dates back to 1960.\n\nThe UN General Assembly and Security Council have adopted a total of 10 resolutions on the question of East Timor all reaffirming this right.\n\nIn its ruling of 30 June 1995 on the Case Concerning East Timor, Portugal vs Australia, the International Court of Justice stated that the right of sell-determination has an erga omnes character and that the people of East Timor are entitled to it.\n\nDialogue without pre-conditions and the CNRM Peace Plan\n\nThe Israeli-Palestinian peace talks and South Africa’s transition to democracy give us renewed hope in that they demonstrate that seemingly intractable problems can be resolved if there is political will and vision by all involved.\n\nIn this room today there are East Timorese leaders of every persuasion, some have come all the way from East Timor, Portugal and Australia, and I can speak for all when I say that we are ready to enter into a process of dialogue with the Indonesian authorities, under the auspices of the United Nations, without pre-conditions, to explore all possible ideas towards a comprehensive settlement of the conflict.\n\nIn 1992, after thorough consultation with our people in the country, Xanana Gusmão gave his seal of authority to what is now known as the CNRM Peace Plan which was formally presented to a meeting of the European Parliament in Brussels on 22 April 1992.\n\nThe CNRM proposal remains valid as a modest contribution towards finding a solution to the conflict.\n\nPhase One – Humanitarian phase\n\nThis phase which should take up to two years to be fully implemented, would involve all three parties working with the UN to implement a wide range of “confidence building measures”, (CBMs) but would not deal with the core of the problem which is the issue of self-determination.\n\nThese CBMs must include release of all prisoners, end of torture and summary executions and a drastic reduction in Indonesia troop presence in the territory.\n\nThese are some of the ideas which I believe could be implemented immediately without loss of face for Indonesia. Its international standing would improve significantly and its presence in the territory would be less resented, thus relieving a very tense situation.\n\nIn view of the time constraints, the full text of this plan is attached to this speech.\n\nPhase Two – Autonomy, 5 years\n\nPhase two, lasting between five to ten years, would be a period of genuine political autonomy based on ample powers vested in a local, democratically elected Territorial People’s Assembly.\n\nAt the end of the second phase, the autonomous status of the territory could be extended by mutual accord.\n\nThe East Timorese people, having enjoyed a period of peace and freedom without the presence of the most hated symbol of the occupation, the army, might accept to continue this form of association.\n\nConversely, the changing generation, altitudes and perception in Indonesia might result in Indonesia accepting as natural that East Timor becomes independent.\n\nPhase Three – Self-determination\n\nIf all parties agree that Phase Three should enter into effect immediately, then the UN begins to prepare a referendum on self-determination to determine the final status of the territory.\n\nIf God willing, East Timor becomes independent, ladies and gentlemen, allow me to share with you, our vision for our country’s future and role in the region.\n\nOur vision for the future\n\nEast Timor is at the crossroads of three major cultures: Melanesian, which binds us to our brothers and sisters of the South Pacific region; Malay-Polynesian binding us to Southeast Asia; and the Latin Catholic influence, a legacy of almost 500 years of Portuguese colonisation. This rich historical and cultural existence place us in a unique position to build bridges of dialogue and co-operation between the peoples of the region.\n\nPortugal\n\nEast Timor will maintain close lies with Portugal, a country which colonised us for almost half a millennium has shown an abiding commitment to our right to self-determination. Portugal and East Timor will be most valuable partners for ASEAN in its relations with the ELI, Africa and Latin America.\n\nAustralia and the South Pacific\n\nThe majority of the East Timorese residents outside the country are in Australia. In spite of our sadness over Australia’s role on East Timor I wish to state here our deepest appreciation to Australia for the shelter, hospitality and generosity shown to the thousands of East Timorese refugees on Australian soil.\n\nWe appreciate the many representations the previous and current govern­ments of Australia have made to impress upon the government of Indonesia regarding the human rights situation in East Timor. No other Western country has been more persistent in this regard.\n\nWe fought together during World War II and many East Timorese gave their lives for our common cause. Now and in the future, we look up to Australia for help. An independent East Timor will seek close relations with Australia and membership in the South Pacific Forum.\n\nASEAN and APEC\n\nWe are conscious of our geography which compels us to co-exist with our neighbours in that part of the world. We will seek membership in ASEAN and APEC within days of our independence.\n\nA Zone of Peace\n\nWe will not have a standing army. For our external security, we will rely on a Treaty of Neutrality to be guaranteed by the permanent members of the Security Council. We will endeavour with the UN and our neighbours to declare our region and the seas surrounding East Timor a Zone of Peace and Development.\n\nRule of Law\n\nWe will endeavour to build a strong democratic state based on the rule of law which must emanate from the will of the people expressed through free and democratic elections.\n\nHuman rights and international obligations\n\nAll international human rights treaties will be submitted to the Parliament for ratification.\n\nWe believe that human rights transcend boundaries and must prevail over state sovereignty.\n\nWe will introduce into the school curriculum at an early stage starting in the kindergarten the subject of human rights.\n\nWe will actively work with like-minded countries, NGOs and the media to strengthen the UN human rights machinery.\n\nAmnesty and national reconciliation\n\nEast Timorese now serving in the Indonesian administration in East Timor, the security forces and police, should not fear an independent East Timor. They will be invited to stay on. Their full and active involvement in running the country will be necessary to insure a smooth transition.\n\nOur society will not be based on revenge. Because of its credibility and standing, the Catholic Church will be expected to play a major role in the healing process of our society.\n\nIn August 1975, too many East Timorese died in brief but violent civil strife. Many more died even after the invasion because some in the leadership of the movement I belonged to, took upon themselves the role of judges and executioners.\n\nNational reconstruction and development\n\nEast Timor is a relatively small country. But with an area of 18,889 km2 and a total population of 700,000 (1974 figures), it is at least equal to, if not larger, in size and population, than some 40 independent states. It is potentially self-sufficient in most agricultural goods, meat and fish. It has large reserves of oil, natural gas, marble and manganese.\n\nThe invasion up-rooted thousands of people. Properties were abandoned, destroyed or sold at unfair prices. This situation will be redressed. A voluntary resettlement plan will be effected to allow the many tens of thousands of displaced East Timorese to return to their ancestral lands. We believe in free education and health care for our people. The money saved from not having a standing army will be well used in these areas. With the co-operation of WHO we will seek to eradicate malaria, tuberculosis and other preventable diseases within a decade.\n\nIndonesian migrants\n\nll is estimated that over 100,000 Indonesians are now living in East Timor. Most are poor Indonesians who came to our country looking for a better life. Indonesian migrants in East Timor will be welcome to stay.\n\nThe Suharto regime, its achievements and what it should do\n\nNo one can honestly suggest that the 30-year regime of Gen. Suharto has not done good for Indonesia. The record of the past 20 years has been impressive. The Suharto regime lifted the Indonesian economy from extreme poverty to the status of an economic tiger. Living standards, literacy, health care and food production increased to impressive levels.\n\nPresident Suharto can show leadership by releasing all prisoners, meeting Indonesia’s greatest living author, Pramoedya Ananta Toer, Megawati Sukarnoputri, leader of the PDI, daughter of Indonesia’s founding father, the late Bung Karno, Muchtar Pakpahan, Indonesia’s Lech Wałęsa, Sri Bintang, George Aditjondro, Indonesia’s most decorated environmentalist.\n\nThe leaders and militants of the PRD are among the best children of Indonesia. Instead of hunting them he should invite them to his palace for dialogue about the future.\n\nFostering a democratic and peaceful transition in Indonesia\n\nNo country, no matter how rich and endowed with natural resources, is an island unto itself. In an increasingly smaller world and competitive age, where modern electronic communications break the barriers of silence erected by dictators, Indonesia cannot continue to flout the right of the people of East Timor to self-determination and the rule of law in Indonesia.\n\nThe next two to three years will witness a transition in Indonesia. Australia, New Zealand, the US, Canada and the EU can encourage a peaceful, evolutionary transition with a discrete yet firm policy of pushing for democratic reforms and rule of law in Indonesia and for a genuine act of self-determination in East Timor.\n\nThe role of the international community\n\nWe are as determined as we are optimistic about our future. To Indonesia and our other neighbours in the ASEAN we are offering a hand of friendship and appealing to them to help us bring peace and freedom to East Timor.\n\nThe EU, working with the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan and Indonesia’s partners in ASEAN, can accelerate the on-going dialogue under the auspices of the UN Secretary-General, and give it some impetus and real substance.\n\nThe US Administration is the only major power that has adopted some concrete measures to encourage changes in Indonesia and East Timor. I express here our sincere appreciation to President Clinton for his actions on East Timor and I appeal to him to lend his youthful energy and compassion towards a permanent resolution of the conflict which he once described as “unconscionable”.\n\nThe West and arms sales\n\nWe are not asking that Indonesia be punished with comprehensive economic sanctions. We believe that economic engagement with a country can at times foster positive changes through the development of a democratically conscious class.\n\nHowever, we find it repulsive that the Western countries that more loudly make rhetorical speeches about human rights are the ones that manufacture most weapons that have killed more than 20 million people in the developing world since World War II.\n\nLand mines, torture equipment, cluster bombs, chemical weapons are weapons designed to inflict pain and death on human beings. Most victims are civilians, women and children. How can arms manufacturers, weapons designers, plant managers, politicians, who have families of their own whom they love, be so insensitive when it comes to the suffering of other human beings?\n\nHuman rights and “Asian values”\n\nThe peoples of Burma, Thailand, the Philippines, South Korea, and the democracy movements in China and Indonesia are telling the rest of the world that democracy and human rights are not an invention of the West.\n\nThe thousands of Asians who died in the streets of Manila, Bangkok, Jakarta, Rangoon, Beijing, did not die for a so-called “Asian value” that denies the people of Asia the basic and fundamental freedoms enjoyed in Europe, Latin America and in an increasing number of countries in Africa.\n\nSouth Korea\n\nThe brave people of Korea who endured decades of dictatorship and occu­pation won the struggle for democracy not with guns but with their tenacity in fighting the troops in the streets of Seoul and Kwangju.\n\nThe South Korean people can also show greater courage by being magnanimous and forgive those who have done wrong. Sometimes in history individuals in power are driven to commit wanton crimes but those who survive and are in power today should resist the temptation to exact revenge in the name of justice.\n\nThe death sentence must be abolished and the brave people of Korea should set the example by commuting the death sentence on former President Chun Do Hwan. From here I appeal to my Korean friends not to exact revenge against those who have been defeated. In victory be magnanimous.\n\nBurma\n\nI extend our most heartfelt solidarity to the brave people of Burma and their elected leader, Nobel Peace Laureate Daw Aung San Suu Kyi, in their struggle for democracy, rule of law and human rights.\n\nAt a time when some ASEAN rulers are conniving with the SLORC regime to deny the people of Burma their democratic victory, we must all stand up and redouble our efforts to restore democracy to Burma.\n\nThe US and the EU must be commended for their leadership in support of the restoration of democracy in Burma but they must escalate the pressure with additional diplomatic and economic sanctions against the SLORC.\n\nI also fully endorse the recommendations on Burma adopted by the Forum of Democratic Leaders in the Asia Pacific led by Kim Dae Jung and Cory Aquino in their recent meeting in Manila.\n\nChina, Taiwan, Tibet\n\nWhen the UN SC debated the issue of East Timor in 1975 and 1976 China was our closest ally. I worked closely with very able Chinese diplomats. In spite of the indifference of the other four permanent members, China, along with other non-permanent members, succeeded in pushing the SC to adopt two resolutions on East Timor.\n\nIt is with this feeling of gratitude and admiration for China that I appeal to the Chinese leaders to listen to their own people’s opinions and desires for a more open society, based on the rule of law, democracy, and freedom of speech. These are after all rights that are granted to each Chinese citizen by their own Constitution.\n\nWei Jing Zhen is one of China’s best children. He is being wasted away when his talents could best be used in the service of his fellow Chinese people and country.\n\nThe people of Taiwan have shown great maturity, responsibility and commitment to peace and democracy. While there is no dispute that Taiwan is part of China, as long as there is no progress on the issue of peaceful reunification of the two countries, I believe that the cause of dialogue and peace can best be served if Taiwan is granted observer status in the UN as was the case in the past with South and North Korea, South and North Vietnam. After all, China has not objected to Taiwan and Hong Kong joining the APEC.\n\nChina should listen to the voice of peace and moderation of the Tibetan people. For many years the Tibetan spiritual leader, His Holiness the Dalai Lama, has offered a moderate peace proposal to the Chinese authorities to settle the Tibetan conflict.\n\nCyprus\n\nCyprus, a shining example of democracy and tolerance, remains divided and occupied by a NATO ally whose history of aggression and violence is well-known.\n\nRecently I received a letter signed by the students of Classes C11 and C22 of Kykko B Lyceum in Nicosia who wrote:\n\nYour homeland is an occupied country at the far end of the ocean. Our homeland lies partly occupied at the far end of the Mediterranean. We live in a divided city and we cannot cross the dividing line …\n\nTo the students of Kykko B Lyceum I can only say that like the ancient Armenia you too will recover your lost land.\n\nThe prophets of doom\n\nThe world has changed dramatically over the last few years and the theorists of irreversibility and status quo have been discredited by the collapse of the USSR.\n\nWho would have thought it possible that the great Armenian people, persecuted for hundreds of years would regain a country called Armenia? The entire world conspired against the Eritrean people. Americans, Russians and Cubans all connived against that small nation. Two great nations, Israelis and Palestinians, who swore eternal hatred have shown courage and wisdom and began a painful process of dialogue. In South Africa, former enemies are trying to rebuild their common home.\n\nLast but not least, for the prophets of doom, for those in government who counsel us “realism”, allow me to remind them of a news item in the ever reliable BBC a few years ago.\n\nIt was sometime in early 1991 and I was driving from the small Swiss town of Nyon, to the Palais des Nations in Geneva, to yet another round of futility in a place where some diplomats pretend to be too busy to listen to real problems of real peoples.\n\nThe BBC was telling us the story of a Soviet cosmonaut who had gone into space a few months earlier on one of those record-breaking missions in space. When he was blasted off from somewhere in the Soviet Union he carried a passport and a nationality granted to him by the most feared military empire in the world.\n\nOnce he completed his tour of duty for the pride of the socialist motherland he prepared the spacecraft for its return voyage to earth. But he no longer had a country to return to. The mighty empire had ceased to exist. He was forced to circle the earth a few days longer until people of good will on earth decided to which country he should go to.\n\nWith this note, I will end with renewed hope that no matter the level of brute force used against us, our dreams will never die.\n\nGod bless you all. Thank you.\n\nTHE CNRM PEACE PLAN\n\nPhase One (one to two years to be implemented)\n\nThe CNRM does not pretend that this plan is the only blue-print for a peace­ful resolution of the East Timor conflict. However, it believes that it at least can be the basis for discussion by all parties.\n\nThis phase of the talks must focus on achieving:\n\nImmediate end to all armed activities in East Timor;\n\nReduction of Indonesian troop presence to a maximum of 1000 within a six-month period;\n\nRemoval of all heavy weapons, tanks, helicopters, combat aircraft, long-range artillery;\n\nImmediate and unconditional release of all political prisoners;\n\nReduction by 50 per cent of Indonesian civil servants in East Timor;\n\nStationing in the territory of UN Specialised Agencies such as UNICEF, UNDP, WHO, FAO;\n\nA comprehensive census of the population;\n\nEstablishment of an independent Human Rights Commission under the Catholic Bishop;\n\nLifting of all media control by the army;\n\nFreedom of political activities;\n\nRemoval of restrictions on the teaching of Portuguese; a Portuguese Cultural Institute is set up;\n\nAppointment of a resident representative of the UN Secretary-General.\n\nPhase Two — Autonomy phase (5 to 10 years)\n\nFull implementation of phase one is a pre-requisite for the successful implementation of phase two. Elections for a Territorial Assembly will be free and fair only if they are conducted after the full implementation of phase one.\n\nThe following must be implemented in the second phase:\n\nPolitical parties, including those advocating independence for East Timor; are legalised;\n\nThe EU sets up a legation in East Timor headed by a senior Portuguese official;\n\nElections are held for a Territorial, Assembly. The UN to provide technical support and supervision of the entire process;\n\nOnly Timorese identified as such may vote and be eligible;\n\nThe Assembly elects a Governor of the Territory;\n\nThe Assembly and the Governor have a 5-year mandate;\n\nThe Territory may enter into trade relations with foreign countries, promulgate its own laws affecting investment, land ownership, property, immigration, etc.;\n\nRemaining Indonesian troops are withdrawn within three months;\n\nThe Territory will have no army. A police force is trained by the UN and is placed under the elected governor;\n\nFurther reduction of Indonesian civil servants;\n\nPortugal and Indonesia normalise relations.\n\nThe second phase can be extended only if a 2/3 majority of the Assembly deputies vote for such an extension and this recommendation has to be put to a referendum.\n\nThis referendum is a safeguard for the people since there is no guarantee that the Territorial Assembly members will reflect the true sentiments of the people on such a crucial issue.\n\nIt is obvious that if the result of this referendum results in a majority rejection of the extension of the autonomy status the implication will be that the people will reject integration in Indonesia.\n\nPhase Three (referendum on self-determination)\n\nIf the Territorial Assembly rejects an extension of the autonomy phase, or if the Assembly votes in support of an extension but this vote is rejected in a referendum, then the final status of the territory is resolved.\n\nA UN-supervised referendum is held on the three options provided for in the UN GA Res. 1514 (XV) of 15 December 1960: independence, free association (with the colonial power Portugal) or integration with another independent state (Indonesia).\n\nA referendum must be held within one year of the end of Phase Two.\n\nFrom Les Prix Nobel.
