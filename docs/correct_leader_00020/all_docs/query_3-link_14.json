        "text": "Prepare: José Ramos-Horta won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1996, sharing the award with Carlos Filipe Ximenes, for \"their work toward a just and peaceful solution in East Timor.\" East Timor was a tiny, South Pacific Island, a former Portugese colony, which was invaded and annexed by Indonesia in 1975, and freed from Indonesian control in 1999. Ramos-Horta's curriculum vitae can be viewed on the Nobel website.\n\nRead: José Ramos-Horta's Architects of Peace essay is excerpted from a journal article titled, \"End Poverty, Secure Peace.\" In it, he makes the argument that revenge is easy, but forgiveness requires courage.\n\nExplore: An eighteen-minute video of José Ramos-Horta speaking at the Nobel Centennial Symposium can be accessed online. In it, he talks about the role of international pressure in bringing about the right of self-determination for the people of East Timor.\n\nWrite: Subsequent to East Timor's emergence as an independent nation, José Ramos-Horta has actively supported independence movements in countries such as Tibet, countries that were once independent but that have been annexed or colonized by larger countries without the assent of the people involved. How many such situations exist worldwide today? Compile an annotated listing of as many such instances as you can find. Annotations should include such details as dates of initial occupation, response of the world community (especially such organizations as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund), and the current status of independence movements. (Hint: a good way to begin your research might be to investigate \"independence movements\" using an internet search engine.)\n\nExtend: In his Architects of Peace article, José Ramos-Horta wrote of a group of Nobel Peace Prize recipients establishing the Commision of Nobel Peace Laureates for Arms Control. Numerous of the persons featured in Architects of Peace have joined with this effort, which has resulted in the \"Framework Convention on International Arms Transfers.\" Individuals who agree with the framework convention can add their names to the growing list of persons supporting this movement.\n\nAdditional Resource: East Timor became an independent nation in 2002, at which time it changed its name to Timor-Leste and joined the United Nations as that organization's 191st member. As a young country, it still requires significant international support to establish itself. Many of these efforts are coordinated by the United Nations, and details can be found on their website.\n\nBiography of José Ramos-Horta"
