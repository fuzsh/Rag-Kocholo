        "text": "Prognostic value of nocturnal pulse oximetry in patients with heart failure.\n\nPubMed\n\nRivera-LÃ³pez, Ricardo; JordÃ¡n-MartÃ­nez, Laura; LÃ³pez-FernÃ¡ndez, Silvia; Rivera-Fernandez, Ricardo; Tercedor, Luis; SÃ¡ez-Roca, GermÃ¡n\n\n2018-05-23\n\nTo analyze the prognostic value of nocturnal hypoxemia measured with portable nocturnal pulse-oximetry in patients hospitalized due to heart failure and its relation to mortality and hospital readmission. We included 38 patients who were admitted consecutively to our unit with the diagnosis of decompensated heart failure. Pulse-oximetry was considered positive for hypoxemia when more than 10 desaturations per hour were recorded during sleep. Follow-up was performed for 30.3 (standard deviation [SD] 14.2) months, the main objective being a combined endpoint of all-cause mortality and hospital readmission due to heart failure. The average age was 70.7 (SD 10.7) years, 63.3% were males. Pulse-oximetry was considered positive for hypoxemia in 27 (71%) patients. Patients with positive pulse-oximetry had the most frequent endpoint (9.1% [1] vs. 61.5% [16], PÂ = 0.003). After multivariate analysis, continuous nocturnal hypoxemia was related to the combined endpoint (HR = 8.37, 1.19-68.4, P = 0.03). Patients hospitalized for heart failure and nocturnal hypoxemia measured with portable pulse-oximeter have an increased risk of hospital readmission and death.

However, SDB was not fully examined, because sleep studies are limited. Nocturnal pulse oximetry has been suggested to be a useful tool for evaluating SDB. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the influence of SDB assessed by nocturnal pulse oximetry on clinical outcomes in patients who underwent percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). We conducted a prospective, multicenter, observational cohort study, wherein SDB was assessed by finger pulse oximetry in patients who underwent PCI from January 2014 to December 2016. SDB was defined as 4% oxygen desaturation index of 5 and higher. The primary endpoint was major adverse cardiac or cerebrovascular event (MACCE), defined as a composite of all-cause mortality, acute coronary syndrome, and/or stroke. Of 539 patients, 296 (54.9%) had SDB. MACCE occurred in 32 patients (5.8%) during a median follow-up of 1.9Â years. The cumulative incidence of MACCE was significantly higher in patients with SDB (Pâ=â0.0134). In the stepwise multivariable Cox proportional model, the presence of SDB was a significant predictor of MACCE (hazard ratio 2.26; 95% confidence interval 1.05-5.4, Pâ=â0.036). SDB determined by nocturnal pulse oximetry was associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients who underwent PCI. Screening for SDB with nocturnal pulse oximetry was considered to be important for risk stratification in patients with CAD.\n\nAccuracy of Smartphone-Based Pulse Oximetry Compared with Hospital-Grade Pulse Oximetry in Healthy Children.\n\nPubMed\n\nTomlinson, Sarah; Behrmann, Sydney; Cranford, James; Louie, Marisa; Hashikawa, Andrew\n\n2017-12-07\n\nPulse oximetry, a ubiquitous, noninvasive method to monitor oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), requires larger, nonportable equipment. Smartphone pulse oximeter applications (apps) provide a portable, cost-effective option, but are untested in children. We hypothesize that smartphone pulse oximetry will not be inferior to standard pulse oximetry measured in healthy children. Two main types of pulse oximetry apps, a camera-based app (CBA) that uses a phone camera flash and lens and a probe-based app (PBA) that uses an external plug-in probe, were compared with standard pulse oximetry measured in children ages 2-13 years without a respiratory complaint and a triage SpO 2 â¥97% seen in a pediatric Emergency Department. Two investigators obtained heart rate and SpO 2 using each app. Inter-rater reliability was tested using interclass correlations (ICCs), and Bland-Altman method was used to compare app values to triage measurements. Eighty-one patients were enrolled. ICC for SpO 2 for PBA and CBA were 0.73 and -0.24, respectively. The 95% limits of agreement between the PBA SpO 2 and triage SpO 2 were -2.8 to +2.5 compared with -4.1 to +3.5 for the CBA SpO 2 and triage SpO 2 . Mean differences between triage SpO 2 and the PBA SpO 2 (-0.17%) and triage SpO 2 and CBA SpO 2 (-0.33%) were not statistically significant. Smartphone-based pulse oximetry is not inferior to standard pulse oximetry in pediatric patients without hypoxia. Reliability was superior for PBA compared with CBA, with more precise agreement for the PBA compared with the CBA. Future studies should test pulse oximetry apps in a hypoxic pediatric population.\n\nAccuracy of pulse oximetry in children.\n\nPubMed\n\nRoss, Patrick A; Newth, Christopher J L; Khemani, Robinder G\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFor children with cyanotic congenital heart disease or acute hypoxemic respiratory failure, providers frequently make decisions based on pulse oximetry, in the absence of an arterial blood gas. The study objective was to measure the accuracy of pulse oximetry in the saturations from pulse oximetry (SpO2) range of 65% to 97%. This institutional review board-approved prospective, multicenter observational study in 5 PICUs included 225 mechanically ventilated children with an arterial catheter. With each arterial blood gas sample, SpO2 from pulse oximetry and arterial oxygen saturations from CO-oximetry (SaO2) were simultaneously obtained if the SpO2 was â¤ 97%. The lowest SpO2 obtained in the study was 65%. In the range of SpO2 65% to 97%, 1980 simultaneous values for SpO2 and SaO2 were obtained. The bias (SpO2 - SaO2) varied through the range of SpO2 values. The bias was greatest in the SpO2 range 81% to 85% (336 samples, median 6%, mean 6.6%, accuracy root mean squared 9.1%). SpO2 measurements were close to SaO2 in the SpO2 range 91% to 97% (901 samples, median 1%, mean 1.5%, accuracy root mean squared 4.2%). Previous studies on pulse oximeter accuracy in children present a single number for bias. This study identified that the accuracy of pulse oximetry varies significantly as a function of the SpO2 range. Saturations measured by pulse oximetry on average overestimate SaO2 from CO-oximetry in the SpO2 range of 76% to 90%. Better pulse oximetry algorithms are needed for accurate assessment of children with saturations in the hypoxemic range.\n\nPulse oximetry: fundamentals and technology update.\n\nPubMed\n\nNitzan, Meir; Romem, Ayal; Koppel, Robert\n\n2014-01-01\n\nOxygen saturation in the arterial blood (SaO2) provides information on the adequacy of respiratory function. SaO2 can be assessed noninvasively by pulse oximetry, which is based on photoplethysmographic pulses in two wavelengths, generally in the red and infrared regions. The calibration of the measured photoplethysmographic signals is performed empirically for each type of commercial pulse-oximeter sensor, utilizing in vitro measurement of SaO2 in extracted arterial blood by means of co-oximetry. Due to the discrepancy between the measurement of SaO2 by pulse oximetry and the invasive technique, the former is denoted as SpO2. Manufacturers of pulse oximeters generally claim an accuracy of 2%, evaluated by the standard deviation (SD) of the differences between SpO2 and SaO2, measured simultaneously in healthy subjects. However, an SD of 2% reflects an expected error of 4% (two SDs) or more in 5% of the examinations, which is in accordance with an error of 3%-4%, reported in clinical studies. This level of accuracy is sufficient for the detection of a significant decline in respiratory function in patients, and pulse oximetry has been accepted as a reliable technique for that purpose. The accuracy of SpO2 measurement is insufficient in several situations, such as critically ill patients receiving supplemental oxygen, and can be hazardous if it leads to elevated values of oxygen partial pressure in blood. In particular, preterm newborns are vulnerable to retinopathy of prematurity induced by high oxygen concentration in the blood. The low accuracy of SpO2 measurement in critically ill patients and newborns can be attributed to the empirical calibration process, which is performed on healthy volunteers. Other limitations of pulse oximetry include the presence of dyshemoglobins, which has been addressed by multiwavelength pulse oximetry, as well as low perfusion and motion artifacts that are partially rectified by sophisticated algorithms and also by reflection pulse\n\nPulse oximetry in the evaluation of peripheral vascular disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nJawahar, D; Rachamalla, H R; Rafalowski, A; Ilkhani, R; Bharathan, T; Anandarao, N\n\n1997-08-01\n\nThe role of pulse oximetry in the evaluation of peripheral vascular disease (PVD) was investigated. In addition, the value of elevating the limb to improve the sensitivity of detection of PVD by the pulse oximeter was also determined. Pulse oximetry reading in the toes were obtained in 40 young, healthy volunteers and in 40 randomly selected patients referred to the vascular investigation laboratory over a period of two months. All 40 healthy volunteers had normal pulse oximetry readings. Normal pulse oximetry reading in the toes was defined as > 95% O2 Sat and +/-2 of finger pulse oximetry reading. In all 40 patients, pulse oximetry readings were either normal or not detected at all. Since there was no gradation in decrease in the pulse oximetry reading with severity of disease or with elevation of the patient's lower extremity, an absent or no reading was considered as an abnormal result from the test. The frequency of abnormal pulse oximetry readings increased significantly in groups with abnormal ankle-brachial pressure index (ABPI) and also varied significantly with elevation of the patients' lower limbs. In patients with no PVD detected by Doppler (ABPI > 0.9), pulse oximetry readings were normal in all. However, in patients with moderate PVD (ABPI, 0.5-0.9), 84% of the patients' lower limbs had normal pulse oximetry readings and 16% had an abnormal reading at baseline level (flat). An additional 12% of the lower limbs in this group had an abnormal reading on elevation of the limb to 12 inches. In patients with severe PVD (ABPI < 0.5), 54% of the patients' lower limbs had an abnormal reading at baseline and an additional 23% had an abnormal reading at elevation of the limb to 12 inches. In conclusion, pulse oximetry was not a sensitive test for detecting early PVD.\n\nPulse oximetry screening in Wisconsin.\n\nPubMed\n\nBeissel, Daniel J; Goetz, Elizabeth M; Hokanson, John S\n\n2012-01-01\n\nPulse oximetry can be used as a screening tool to detect critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in neonates prior to hospital discharge and the development of symptoms. Newborns suspected of having CCHD based on pulse oximetry screening should have the diagnosis excluded or confirmed with echocardiography. However, echocardiography is not immediately available in all settings in which newborns are delivered and the best course of action in these settings remains to be determined. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the resources available to diagnose and treat newborns with CCHD born in the state of Wisconsin. We surveyed the nurse managers or administrators of the 99 Wisconsin hospitals in which babies are routinely delivered in the state of Wisconsin. A telephone survey was performed in February and March 2011. The number of births per facility was estimated from the most recent available data (2010). There were 66 179 total births occurring in 106 hospitals in the state of Wisconsin in 2010, with 99 hospitals routinely delivering newborns. Surveys were completed in 88/99 (88.9%), representing 95% of the state's in-hospital births. All responding hospitals had pulse oximetry available in the nursery. Twenty-five of 88 (28.4%) of responding hospitals routinely use pulse oximetry to screen for CCHD, representing 35.2% of surveyed hospital births. Same-day neonatal echocardiography was available at 33/88 (37.5%) of the responding hospitals, representing 74.4% of surveyed hospital births. The average distance to the higher-level care facility of choice from the hospitals without neonatal echocardiography is 53.1 miles. Pulse oximetry is universally available in Wisconsin newborn nurseries, and pulse oximetry screening for CCHD is currently being performed for many of Wisconsin's newborns. The majority of births in Wisconsin occur in hospitals where same-day neonatal echocardiography is available for confirmatory diagnosis of CCHD when necessary.

Therefore, various pulse oximeters have been developed continuously. However, some of the existing pulse oximeters are not equipped with communication capabilities, and consequently, the continuous monitoring of patient health is restricted. Moreover, even though certain oximeters have been built as network models, they focus on exchanging only pulse oximetry data, and they do not provide sufficient device management functions. In this paper, we propose an advanced pulse oximetry system for remote monitoring and management. The system consists of a networked pulse oximeter and a personal monitoring server. The proposed pulse oximeter measures a patient's pulse oximetry data and transmits the data to the personal monitoring server. The personal monitoring server then analyzes the received data and displays the results to the patient. Furthermore, for device management purposes, operational errors that occur in the pulse oximeter are reported to the personal monitoring server, and the system configurations of the pulse oximeter, such as thresholds and measurement targets, are modified by the server. We verify that the proposed pulse oximetry system operates efficiently and that it is appropriate for monitoring and managing a pulse oximeter in real time.

Oxygen saturation is an important parameter in cases of COPD, but there are insufficient data on the role of pulse oximetry in patients with COPD, moreso in diseases across its spectrum, such as chronic bronchitis and emphysema. We assessed the performance of pulse oximetry in acute respiratory failure of patients with COPD. This was a cross-sectional, observational study. We studied 50 subjects with COPD admitted to the Government General Hospital, a 1,000-bed tertiary referral center in Guntur, India, from June 2013 to July 2013. Simultaneous reading of S(pO2) by a handheld pulse oximeter and S(aO2) by an automated arterial blood gas analyzer were taken. Pulse oximetry was sufficiently sensitive (84.60%) to hypoxemia in respiratory failure to be used in clinical situations. The mean difference (bias) between SaO2 and S(pO2) was -3.98 (95% CI -4.68 to 3.28). There was less sensitivity (82% vs. 85%) and positive predictive value (69% vs. 85%) of the pulse oximeter to respiratory failure in subjects with chronic bronchitis versus emphysema. Pulse oximetry performed poorly in comparison with the invasive arterial blood gas analysis. The variability of the readings was greater in the subjects with chronic bronchitis than in those with emphysema.

We evaluated the accuracy of a novel pulse oximetry sensor custom designed for the nasal ala. After IRB approval, healthy non-smoking subjects [n=12; aged 28 (23-41) yr; 6M/6F] breathed hypoxic mixtures of fresh gas by a facemask to achieve oxyhaemoglobin saturations of 70-100% measured by traditional co-oximetry from radial artery samples. Concurrent alar and finger pulse oximetry values were measured using probes designed for these sites. Data were analysed using the Bland-Altman method for multiple observations per subject. Bias, precision, and accuracy root mean square error (ARMS) over a range of 70-100% were significantly better for the alar probe compared with a standard finger probe. The mean bias for the alar and finger probes was 0.73% and 1.90% (P<0.001), respectively, with corresponding precision values of 1.65 and 1.83 (P=0.015) and ARMS values of 1.78% and 2.72% (P=0.047). The coefficients of determination were 0.96 and 0.96 for the alar and finger probes, respectively. The within/between-subject variation for the alar and finger probes were 1.14/1.57% and 1.87/1.47%, respectively. The limits of agreement were 3.96/-2.50% and 5.48/-1.68% for the alar and finger probes, respectively. Nasal alar pulse oximetry is feasible and demonstrates accurate pulse oximetry values over a range of 70-100%. The alar probe demonstrated greater accuracy compared with a conventional finger pulse oximeter. Â© The Author [2014].

Artefact reduction in photoplethysmography (PPG), and therefore by application in pulse oximetry, is demonstrated using a novel non-linear methodology recently proposed by the authors. The significance of these processed PPG signals for pulse oximetry measurement is discussed, with particular attention to the normalization inherent in the artefact reduction process. Quantitative experimental investigation of the performance of PPG artefact reduction is then utilized to evaluate this technology for application to pulse oximetry. While the successfully demonstrated reduction of severe artefacts may widen the applicability of all PPG technologies and decrease the occurrence of pulse oximeter false alarms, the observed reduction of slight artefacts suggests that many such effects may go unnoticed in clinical practice. The signal processing and output averaging used in most commercial oximeters can incorporate these artefact errors into the output, while masking the true PPG signal corruption. It is therefore suggested that PPG artefact reduction should be incorporated into conventional pulse oximetry measurement, even in the absence of end-user artefact problems.\n\nClinical nurses' knowledge level on pulse oximetry: A descriptive multi-centre study.\n\nPubMed\n\nMilutinoviÄ, Dragana; RepiÄ, Gordana; AranÄeloviÄ, Branimirka\n\n2016-12-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to assess the level of knowledge on pulse oximetry among nurses. Understanding this is important because insufficient knowledge can lead to misinterpretation of pulse oximetry readings and consequently compromise patient safety. The study was cross-sectional and included a sample of 198 nurses. A modified questionnaire by Kiekkas et al. was used as the research tool. Intensive care units, anaesthesiology and emergency departments in two tertiary health care institutions in Serbia. Principles of pulse oximeter function and conditions that can affect accuracy and reliability of pulse oximetry readings. The lower percentage of correct responses about principles of pulse oximetry function was found in items related with the alarm reliability and understanding technical limitations. The factors that might affect pulse oximetry readings which were not identified by the nurses at a satisfactory level were the body position and specific kinds of ambient light. The mean scores of knowledge level were significantly different regarding departments (p=0.015). Since this study revealed a lower level of knowledge in some aspects of pulse oximetry, it can be concluded that the generally firm belief that \"experience is everything\" can be challenged. This fact is important for the quality of health care and the patient's safety. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

The objective of this commentary is to discuss a rationale for using pulse oximetry in chiropractic practice. Discussion Pulse oximetry may offer doctors of chiropractic a way to monitor patients' oxygen saturation levels. Quantification of saturation values with heart rate may give clinical aid to the management of chiropractic patients. Markedly reduced saturation levels may necessitate medical referral, whereas mildly reduced levels could lead to changes in chiropractic management. Conclusions Pulse oximetry has the potential to be an integral part of chiropractic practice.

A retrospective evaluation of the monitor downloads of 67 infants who had undergone either TTI/ECG or pulse oximetry home monitoring using a device which can detect both parameters. The patients were categorised as: apparent life-threatening events (n = 39), preterm infants (n = 21) and miscellaneous (n = 7). TTI/ECG and pulse oximetry alarm traces were scored as either true or false alarms. Classification criteria were based on visual analysis of the impedance and plethysmographic waveforms captured by the memory monitor every time alarm thresholds were violated. 5242 alarms occurred over 3452 days of monitoring: 4562 (87%) were false and 680 (13%) true. The mean duration of monitoring was 51 days (range 5-220 days). There were 2982 TTI/ECG false alarms (65% of the total) and 1580 pulse oximetry false alarms (35%) (p = 0.0042). Of the 680 true alarms, 507 (74%) were desaturations not attributable to central apnoea and 173 (26%) were true TTI/ECG alarms (p = 0.0013). Comparison of pulse oximetry and TTI/ECG alarm traces shows that true events were mostly attributable to desaturations, while false alarms were mainly provoked by TTI/ECG. The total number of false alarms is lower than reported in other studies using TTI/ECG only, thus indicating that monitoring using both pulse oximetry and TTI/ECG is suitable for home use. When the combination of both techniques is not feasible or not required, we recommend the use of motion resistant pulse oximetry alone.\n\nTexas Pulse Oximetry Project: A Multicenter Educational and Quality Improvement Project for Implementation of Critical Congenital Heart Disease Screening Using Pulse Oximetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nGuillory, Charleta; Gong, Alice; Livingston, Judith; Creel, Liza; Ocampo, Elena; McKee-Garrett, Tiffany\n\n2017-07-01\n\nObjective âCritical congenital heart disease (CCHD) is a leading cause of death in infants. Newborn screening (NBS) by pulse oximetry allows early identification of CCHD in asymptomatic newborns. To improve readiness of hospital neonatal birthing facilities for mandatory screening in Texas, an educational and quality improvement (QI) project was piloted to identify an implementation strategy for CCHD NBS in a range of birthing hospitals. Study Design âThirteen Texas hospitals implemented standardized CCHD screening by pulse oximetry. An educational program was devised and a tool kit was created to facilitate education and implementation. Newborn nursery nurses' knowledge was assessed using a pre- and posttest instrument. Results âThe nurses' knowledge assessment improved from 71 to 92.5% ( p â<â0.0001). Of 11,322 asymptomatic newborns screened after 24 hours of age, 11 had a positive screen, with 1 confirmed case of CCHD. Pulse oximetry CCHD NBS had sensitivity of 100%, specificity of 99.91%, false-positive rate of 0.088%, positive predictive value of 9.09%, and negative predictive value of 100%. Conclusion âOur educational program, including a tool kit, QI processes, and standardized pulse oximetry CCHD NBS, is applicable for a range of hospital birthing facilities and may facilitate wide-scale implementation, thereby improving newborn health.

Materials and methods A cross-sectional prospective study was conducted at Hamad Medical Corporation in Qatar. Parents of infants and children <24 months old and hospitalized with bronchiolitis were offered an interview survey. Results A total of 132 questionnaires were completed (response rate 100%). Approximately 90% of participants were 20â40 years of age, and 85% were females. The mean age of children was 7.2Â±5.8 months. Approximately eight in ten parents supported the idea of continuous pulse oximetry in children with bronchiolitis. Almost 43% of parents believed that continuous pulse-oximetry monitoring would delay their childrenâs hospital discharge. Interestingly, approximately 85% of caregivers agreed that continuous pulse oximetry had a good impact on their childrenâs health. In addition, around one in two of the participants stated that good bedside examinations can obviate the need for continuous pulse oximetry. Furthermore, 80% of parents believed that continuous pulse-oximetry monitoring would give the health-care provider a good sense of security regarding the childâs health. Finally, being a male parent was associated with significantly increased risk of reporting unnecessary fatigue, attributed to the sound of continuous pulse oximetry (P=0.031). Conclusion Continuous pulse-oximetry monitoring in children with bronchiolitis was perceived as reassuring for parents. Involving parents in decision-making is considered essential in the better management of children with bronchiolitis or any other disease. The first step to decrease continuous pulse oximetry will require provider education and change as well. Furthermore, we recommend proper counseling for parents, emphasizing that medical technology is not always essential, but is a complementary mode of managing a disease.

This raises questions on the calibratability of camera-based pulse oximetry. METHODS: We made video recordings of the foreheads of 41 healthy adults at 660 and 840 nm, and remote PPG signals were extracted. Subjects were in normoxic, hypoxic, and low temperature conditions. Ratio-of-ratios were compared to reference Spo2 from 4 contact probes. RESULTS: A calibration curve based on artifact-free data was determined for a population of 26 individuals. For an Spo2 range of approximately 83% to 100% and discarding short-term errors, a root mean square error of 1.15% was found with an upper 99% one-sided confidence limit of 1.65%. Under normoxic conditions, a decrease in ambient temperature from 23 to 7Â°C resulted in a calibration error of 0.1% (Â±1.3%, 99% confidence interval) based on measurements for 3 subjects. PPG signal strengths varied strongly among individuals from about 0.9 Ã 10â3 to 4.6 Ã 10â3 for the infrared wavelength. CONCLUSIONS: For healthy adults, the results present strong evidence that camera-based contactless pulse oximetry is fundamentally feasible because long-term (eg, 10 minutes) error stemming from variation among individuals expressed as A*rms is significantly lower (<1.65%) than that required by the International Organization for Standardization standard (<4%) with the notion that short-term errors should be added. A first illustration of such errors has been provided with A**rms = 2.54% for 40 individuals, including 6 with dark skin. Low signal strength and subject motion present critical challenges that will have to be addressed to make camera-based pulse oximetry practically feasible.

Potential use of pulse oximetry to detect aspiration is attractive to clinicians, as it is readily available, quick, and noninvasive. However, research regarding validity has been mixed. This systematic review examining evidence on the use of pulse oximetry to detect a decrease in SpO 2 indicating aspiration during swallowing is undertaken to further inform clinical practice in dysphagia assessment. A multi-engine electronic search was conducted on 8/25/16 and updated on 4/8/17 in accordance with standards published by the Preferred Reporting for Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA). Inclusion criteria included use of pulse oximetry to detect aspiration with simultaneous confirmation of aspiration via a gold standard instrumental study. Keywords included dysphagia or aspiration AND pulse oximetry. Articles meeting criteria were reviewed by two blinded co-investigators. The search yielded 294 articles, from which 19 were judged pertinent and reviewed in full. Ten met the inclusion criteria and all were rated at Level III-2 on the Australian Diagnostic Levels of Evidence. Study findings were mixed with sensitivity ranging from 10 to 87%. Potentially confounding variables were observed in all studies reviewed, and commonly involved defining \"desaturation\" within a standard measurement error range (~Â 2%), mixed populations, mixed viscosities/textures observed during swallowing, and lack of comparison group. The majority of studies failed to demonstrate an association between observed aspiration and oxygen desaturation. Current evidence does not support the use of pulse oximetry to detect aspiration.\n\nOptimal filter bandwidth for pulse oximetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nStuban, Norbert; Niwayama, Masatsugu\n\n2012-10-01\n\nPulse oximeters contain one or more signal filtering stages between the photodiode and microcontroller. These filters are responsible for removing the noise while retaining the useful frequency components of the signal, thus improving the signal-to-noise ratio. The corner frequencies of these filters affect not only the noise level, but also the shape of the pulse signal. Narrow filter bandwidth effectively suppresses the noise; however, at the same time, it distorts the useful signal components by decreasing the harmonic content. In this paper, we investigated the influence of the filter bandwidth on the accuracy of pulse oximeters. We used a pulse oximeter tester device to produce stable, repetitive pulse waves with digitally adjustable R ratio and heart rate. We built a pulse oximeter and attached it to the tester device. The pulse oximeter digitized the current of its photodiode directly, without any analog signal conditioning. We varied the corner frequency of the low-pass filter in the pulse oximeter in the range of 0.66-15 Hz by software. For the tester device, the R ratio was set to R = 1.00, and the R ratio deviation measured by the pulse oximeter was monitored as a function of the corner frequency of the low-pass filter. The results revealed that lowering the corner frequency of the low-pass filter did not decrease the accuracy of the oxygen level measurements. The lowest possible value of the corner frequency of the low-pass filter is the fundamental frequency of the pulse signal. We concluded that the harmonics of the pulse signal do not contribute to the accuracy of pulse oximetry. The results achieved by the pulse oximeter tester were verified by human experiments, performed on five healthy subjects. The results of the human measurements confirmed that filtering out the harmonics of the pulse signal does not degrade the accuracy of pulse oximetry.\n\nOptimal filter bandwidth for pulse oximetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nStuban, Norbert; Niwayama, Masatsugu\n\n2012-10-01\n\nPulse oximeters contain one or more signal filtering stages between the photodiode and microcontroller.

However, its reliability is often affected by motion artefact. Clinicians confronted with questionable oxygen saturation (SpO2) values often estimate the reliability by correlating heart rate (HR) obtained with the oximeter with that obtained by electrocardiogram. Objective: To compare the effects of motion on SpO2 and HR measurements made with Masimo signal extraction technology and those made with a Nellcor N-200. Design: Continuous pulse oximetry and HR monitoring were performed in 15 healthy, term infants (mean (SD) birth weight 3408 (458) g) undergoing circumcision, using Masimo and Nellcor pulse oximeters and a standard HR monitor (Hewlett-Packard). Simultaneous minute by minute behavioural activity codes were also assigned. Baseline data were collected for 10 minutes when the infant was quietly asleep and then continued during and after circumcision for a total duration of one hour. The oximeter HR and SpO2 values were compared and related to HR values obtained by ECG during all three periods. The effect of behavioural activity on SpO2 and HR was also evaluated. Results: When compared with results obtained with the Nellcor, the mean SpO2 and HR were higher and the incidence of artefact lower with the Masimo during all three periods. Masimo HR more accurately predicted HR obtained with a standard monitor, with lower residual error. SpO2 and HR values obtained with the Nellcor were lower and more variable during all behavioural states, especially crying, when excessive motion artefact was most likely. Conclusions: The data suggest that Masimo signal extraction technology may offer improvement in pulse oximetry performance, particularly in clinical situations in which extreme motion artefacts are likely.

Prospective experimental study. Seventeen pregnant Merino ewes. Animals included in study were late gestation ewes undergoing general anaesthesia for Caesarean delivery or foetal surgery in a medical research laboratory. Masimo Radical-7 pulse oximetry (SpO(2) ) measurements were compared to co-oximetry (SaO(2) ) measurements from arterial blood gas analyses. The failure rate of the pulse oximeter was calculated. Accuracy was assessed by Bland & Altman's (2007) limits of agreement method. The effect of mean arterial blood pressure (MAP), perfusion index (PI) and haemoglobin (Hb) concentration on accuracy were assessed by regression analysis. Forty arterial blood samples paired with SpO(2) and blood pressure measurements were obtained. SpO(2) ranged from 42 to 99% and SaO(2) from 43.7 to 99.9%. MAP ranged from 24 to 82 mmHg, PI from 0.1 to 1.56 and Hb concentration from 71 to 114 g L(-1) . Masimo pulse oximetry measurements tended to underestimate oxyhaemoglobin saturation compared to co-oximetry with a bias (mean difference) of -2% and precision (standard deviation of the differences) of 6%. Accuracy appeared to decrease when SpO(2) was <75%, however numbers were too small for statistical comparisons. Hb concentration and PI had no significant effect on accuracy, whereas MAP was negatively correlated with SpO(2) bias. Masimo SET pulse oximetry can provide reliable and continuous monitoring of arterial oxyhaemoglobin saturation in anaesthetized pregnant sheep during clinically relevant levels of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Further work is needed to assess pulse oximeter function during extreme hypotension and hypoxaemia. Â© 2012 The Authors. Veterinary Anaesthesia and Analgesia.

The Electronic Patch is a new health monitoring system incorporating biomedical sensors, microelectronics, radio frequency (RF) communication, and a battery embedded in a 3-dimensional hydrocolloid polymer. In this paper the Electronic Patch is demonstrated with a new optical biomedical sensor for reflectance pulse oximetry so that the Electronic Patch in this case can measure the pulse and the oxygen saturation. The reflectance pulse oximetry solution is based on a recently developed annular backside silicon photodiode to enable low power consumption by the light emitting components. The Electronic Patch has a disposable part of soft adhesive hydrocolloid polymer and a reusable part of hard polylaurinlactam. The disposable part contains the battery. The reusable part contains the reflectance pulse oximetry sensor and microelectronics. The reusable part is 'clicked' into the disposable part when the patch is prepared for use. The patch has a size of 88 mm by 60 mm and a thickness of 5 mm.\n\nAn analysis on the theory of pulse oximetry by Monte Carlo simulation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nFan, Shangchun; Cai, Rui; Xing, Weiwei; Liu, Changting; Chen, Guangfei; Wang, Junfeng\n\n2008-10-01\n\nThe pulse oximetry is a kind of electronic instrument that measures the oxygen saturation of arterial blood and pulse rate by non-invasive techniques. It enables prompt recognition of hypoxemia. In a conventional transmittance type pulse oximeter, the absorption of light by oxygenated and reduced hemoglobin is measured at two wavelength 660nm and 940nm. But the accuracy and measuring range of the pulse oximeter can not meet the requirement of clinical application. There are limitations in the theory of pulse oximetry, which is proved by Monte Carlo method. The mean paths are calculated in the Monte Carlo simulation. The results prove that the mean paths are not the same between the different wavelengths.\n\nTrans-abdominal monitoring of fetal arterial blood oxygenation using pulse oximetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZourabian, Anna; Siegel, Andrew M.; Chance, Britton; Ramanujam, Nirmala; Rode, Martha; Boas, David A.\n\n2000-10-01\n\nPulse oximetry (oxygen saturation monitoring) has markedly improved medical care in many fields, including anesthesiology, intensive care, and newborn intensive care. In obstetrics, fetal heart rate monitoring remains the standard for intrapartum assessment of fetal well being. Fetal oxygen saturation monitoring is a new technique currently under development. It is potentially superior to electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (cardiotocography) because it allows direct assessment of both the fetal oxygen status and fetal tissue perfusion. Here we present the analysis for determining the most optimal wavelength selection for pulse oximetry. The wavelengths we chose as the most optimal are the first in the range of 670 - 720 nm and the second in the range of 825 - 925 nm. Further, we discuss the possible systematic errors during our measurements and their contribution to the obtained saturation results. We present feasibility studies for fetal pulse oximetry, monitored noninvasively through the maternal abdomen. Our preliminary experiments show that the fetal pulse can be discriminated from the maternal pulse and thus, in principle, the fetal arterial oxygen saturation can be obtained. We present the methodology for obtaining these data, and discuss the dependence of our measurements on the fetal position with respect to the optode assembly.\n\nIdentifying individual sleep apnea/hypoapnea epochs using smartphone-based pulse oximetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nGarde, Ainara; Dekhordi, Parastoo; Ansermino, J Mark; Dumont, Guy A\n\n2016-08-01\n\nSleep apnea, characterized by frequent pauses in breathing during sleep, poses a serious threat to the healthy growth and development of children. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard for sleep apnea diagnosis, is resource intensive and confined to sleep laboratories, thus reducing its accessibility. Pulse oximetry alone, providing blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) and blood volume changes in tissue (PPG), has the potential to identify children with sleep apnea. Thus, we aim to develop a tool for at-home sleep apnea screening that provides a detailed and automated 30 sec epoch-by-epoch sleep apnea analysis. We propose to extract features characterizing pulse oximetry (SpO2 and pulse rate variability [PRV], a surrogate measure of heart rate variability) to create a multivariate logistic regression model that identifies epochs containing apnea/hypoapnea events. Overnight pulse oximetry was collected using a smartphone-based pulse oximeter, simultaneously with standard PSG from 160 children at the British Columbia Children's hospital. The sleep technician manually scored all apnea/hypoapnea events during the PSG study. Based on these scores we labeled each epoch as containing or not containing apnea/hypoapnea. We randomly divided the subjects into training data (40%), used to develop the model applying the LASSO method, and testing data (60%), used to validate the model. The developed model was assessed epoch-by-epoch for each subject. The test dataset had a median area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 81%; the model provided a median accuracy of 74% sensitivity of 75%, and specificity of 73% when using a risk threshold similar to the percentage of apnea/hypopnea epochs. Thus, providing a detailed epoch-by-epoch analysis with at-home pulse oximetry alone is feasible with accuracy, sensitivity and specificity values above 73% However, the performance might decrease when analyzing subjects with a low number of apnea/hypoapnea events.\n\nAutomated Screening of Children With Obstructive Sleep Apnea Using Nocturnal Oximetry: An Alternative to Respiratory Polygraphy in Unattended Settings\n\nPubMed Central\n\nÃlvarez, Daniel; Alonso-Ãlvarez, MarÃ­a L.; GutiÃ©rrez-Tobal, Gonzalo C.; Crespo, Andrea; Kheirandish-Gozal, Leila; Hornero, Roberto; Gozal, David; TerÃ¡n-Santos, JoaquÃ­n; Del Campo, FÃ©lix\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStudy Objectives: Nocturnal oximetry has become known as a simple, readily available, and potentially useful diagnostic tool of childhood obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). However, at-home respiratory polygraphy (HRP) remains the preferred alternative to polysomnography (PSG) in unattended settings. The aim of this study was twofold: (1) to design and assess a novel methodology for pediatric OSA screening based on automated analysis of at-home oxyhemoglobin saturation (SpO2), and (2) to compare its diagnostic performance with HRP. Methods: SpO2 recordings were parameterized by means of time, frequency, and conventional oximetric measures. Logistic regression models were optimized using genetic algorithms (GAs) for three cutoffs for OSA: 1, 3, and 5 events/h. The diagnostic performance of logistic regression models, manual obstructive apnea-hypopnea index (OAHI) from HRP, and the conventional oxygen desaturation index â¥ 3% (ODI3) were assessed. Results: For a cutoff of 1 event/h, the optimal logistic regression model significantly outperformed both conventional HRP-derived ODI3 and OAHI: 85.5% accuracy (HRP 74.6%; ODI3 65.9%) and 0.97 area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) (HRP 0.78; ODI3 0.75) were reached. For a cutoff of 3 events/h, the logistic regression model achieved 83.4% accuracy (HRP 85.0%; ODI3 74.5%) and 0.96 AUC (HRP 0.93; ODI3 0.85) whereas using a cutoff of 5 events/h, oximetry reached 82.8% accuracy (HRP 85.1%; ODI3 76.7) and 0.97 AUC (HRP 0.95; ODI3 0.84). Conclusions: Automated analysis of at-home SpO2 recordings provide accurate detection of children with high pretest probability of OSA. Thus, unsupervised nocturnal oximetry may enable a simple and effective alternative to HRP and PSG in unattended settings.

To study the effect of crystalloid and colloid fluid on the accuracy (bias) and precision of pulse oximetry haemoglobin estimation to indicate the venous haemoglobin concentration in volunteers. Open interventional crossover study. Single university hospital. Ten male volunteers aged 18-28 (mean 22) years. Each volunteer underwent three infusion experiments on separate days and in random order. The infusions were Ringer's acetate (20 mlâkg), hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.4 (10 mlâkg) and a combination of both. At the end of the infusions of Ringer's acetate, pulse oximetry haemoglobin concentration had decreased more than the true haemoglobin concentration (15 vs. 8%; P < 0.005; n = 10) whereas starch solution decreased pulse oximetry haemoglobin concentration less than true haemoglobin concentration (7 vs. 11%; P < 0.02; n = 20). The same differences were seen when the fluids were infused separately and when they were combined. The overall difference between all 956 pairs of pulse oximetry haemoglobin concentration and true haemoglobin concentrations (the bias) averaged only -0.7 gâl whereas the 95% prediction interval was wide, ranging from -24.9 to 23.7 gâl. In addition to the choice of infusion fluid, the bias was strongly dependent on the volunteer (each factor, P < 0.001). The bias of measuring haemoglobin concentration by pulse oximetry is dependent on whether a crystalloid or a colloid fluid is infused.

Stable preterm infants were monitored with a pulse oximeter and an ECG. The displays of both monitors were captured on video. Heart rate data from both monitors, including measures of signal quality, were extracted and analysed using Bland Altman plots. In 30 infants the mean (SD) difference between heart rate measured by pulse oximetry and electrocardiography was -0.4 (12) beats per minute. Accuracy was maintained when the signal quality or perfusion was low. Pulse oximetry may provide a useful measurement of heart rate in the neonatal intensive care unit. Studies of this technique in the delivery room are indicated.\n\nDevelopment and clinical evaluation of a new sensor design for buccal pulse oximetry in horses.\n\nPubMed\n\nReiners, J K; Rossdeutscher, W; Hopster, K; KÃ¤stner, S B R\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThe use of pulse oximetry in horses is limited due to inadequate readings with conventional transmission sensor probes. The objectives of this study were to 1) develop an improved sensor design for horses to be used at an appropriate anatomical site, and 2) evaluate this design in an experimental study. In vivo experiment. A new sensor design for reflectance pulse oximetry at the buccal mucosa was developed. A conventional Nonin 2000SL sensor for transmission pulse oximetry was included into this design. Three different prototypes (N1, N2a, N2b) were constructed and used with the Nonin 2500A Vet pulse oximetry monitor. Thirteen anaesthetised warmblood horses were included into a desaturation protocol (100-70% SaO 2 ). SpO 2 and pulse frequency values were recorded, using SaO 2 calculated from blood gas analysis and invasive pulse frequency measurements as reference methods. Bias and precision were evaluated by calculations of the root mean square deviation (A rms ). The agreement of the methods was tested with Bland-Altman analysis. The quality of the pulse frequency readings determined the quality of the SpO 2 -readings. Good pulse signal strength resulted in a SpO 2 -accuracy comparable to that of the original sensor (Nonin 2000SL: A rms = 3%; N1: A rms = 3.60%; N2b: A rms = 3.46%). Especially at heart rates â¤30 bpm, pulse rate readings that were about twice as high as the reference value occurred. Their exclusion from the dataset resulted in a pulse rate accuracy similar to that of the original sensor. Bland-Altman plots showed limits of agreement typical of pulse oximeters. The pulse frequency accuracy requires further improvement. The usability in clinical cases needs to be tested. The new sensor design has been shown to be suitable for buccal pulse oximetry in horses.

The measurement system consists of the optical sensor, sensor electronics, acquisition board and personal computer. The system has been tested in a two-part experimental study involving human volunteers.

Conventional pulse oximeters use expensive optoelectronic components that restrict sensing locations to finger tips or ear lobes due to their rigid form and area-scaling complexity. In this work, we report a pulse oximeter sensor based on organic materials, which are compatible with flexible substrates. Green (532ânm) and red (626ânm) organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) are used with an organic photodiode (OPD) sensitive at the aforementioned wavelengths. The sensorâs active layers are deposited from solution-processed materials via spin-coating and printing techniques. The all-organic optoelectronic oximeter sensor is interfaced with conventional electronics at 1âkHz and the acquired pulse rate and oxygenation are calibrated and compared with a commercially available oximeter. The organic sensor accurately measures pulse rate and oxygenation with errors of 1% and 2%, respectively.\n\nSimultaneous use of intrapartum fetal pulse oximetry and amnioinfusion in meconium stained amniotic fluid.\n\nPubMed\n\nHalvax, LÃ¡szlÃ³; SzabÃ³, IstvÃ¡n; Vizer, MiklÃ³s; Csermely, TamÃ¡s; Ertl, Tibor\n\n2002-09-10\n\nFetal pulse oximetry is a minimally invasive, simple technique which continuously helps to reflect in utero well-being. The presence of meconium in the amniotic fluid may be a clinical sign of fetal hypoxaemia. Amnioinfusion has a beneficial effect on the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome (MAS), and the presence of meconium below the level of the vocal cords. We studied the impact of amnioinfusion combined with fetal pulse oximetry on the incidence of meconium aspiration syndrome and operative delivery. The retrospective analysis revealed that the presence of meconium below the level of vocal cords was significantly reduced. The frequency of cesarean section is decreased, however, it did not reach statistical significance. Fetal pulse oximetry may be used in combination with amnioinfusion and cardiotocography (CTG) to reduce the risk of meconium aspiration syndrome and the number of instrumental deliveries and improve perinatal outcome.

Retrospective descriptive case series. The intravenous administration of indocyanine green for ophthalmic angiography resulted in a transient drop in oxygen saturation as measured by Nellcor fingertip pulse oximetry in three children with retinoblastoma receiving indocyanine green-guided transpupillary thermotherapy. The magnitude of reduction ranged from 92% to 94% from an initial reading of 99% to 100% in each case, with an average duration of 3 minutes. Concurrent measurement of blood pressure, pulse, and expired CO2 showed no changes during this process. Administration of intravenous indocyanine green resulted in a transient desaturation by oximetry during transpupillary thermotherapy for children with retinoblastoma under anesthesia because of the fluorescent dye's absorption of red light in a manner similar to that of deoxygenated hemoglobin, thereby leading to transient instrument misinterpretation and miscalculation of arterial oxygenation.\n\nA phantom with pulsating artificial vessels for non-invasive fetal pulse oximetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nLaqua, Daniel; Pollnow, Stefan; Fischer, Jan; Ley, Sebastian; Husar, Peter\n\n2014-01-01\n\nArterial oxygen saturation of the fetus is an important parameter for monitoring its physical condition. During labor and delivery the transabdominal non-invasive fetal pulse oximetry could minimize the risk for mother and fetus, compared to other existing invasive examination methods. In this contribution, we developed a physical-like phantom to investigate new sensor circuits and algorithms of a non-invasive diagnostic method for fetal pulse oximetry. Hence, the developed artificial vascular system consists of two independent tube systems representing the maternal and fetal vessel system. The arterial blood pressure is reproduced with a pre-pressure and an artificial vascular system. Each pulse wave can be reproduced, by digital control of a proportional valve, adjustable viscoelastic elements, and resistances. The measurements are performed by pressure transducers, optical sensor units, and a coplanar capacitive sensor. Transmission and reflection measurements have shown that the fetal and maternal pulse waves can be reproduced qualitatively. The measured light represents the transabdominal modulated signal on an abdomen of a pregnant woman.\n\nGlobal operating theatre distribution and pulse oximetry supply: an estimation from reported data.\n\nPubMed\n\nFunk, Luke M; Weiser, Thomas G; Berry, William R; Lipsitz, Stuart R; Merry, Alan F; Enright, Angela C; Wilson, Iain H; Dziekan, Gerald; Gawande, Atul A\n\n2010-09-25\n\nSurgery is an essential part of health care, but resources to ensure the availability of surgical services are often inadequate. We estimated the global distribution of operating theatres and quantified the availability of pulse oximetry, which is an essential monitoring device during surgery and a potential measure of operating theatre resources. We calculated ratios of the number of operating theatres to hospital beds in seven geographical regions worldwide on the basis of profiles from 769 hospitals in 92 countries that participated in WHO's safe surgery saves lives initiative. We used hospital bed figures from 190 WHO member states to estimate the number of operating theatres per 100,000 people in 21 subregions throughout the world. To estimate availability of pulse oximetry, we sent surveys to anaesthesia providers in 72 countries selected to ensure a geographically and demographically diverse sample. A predictive regression model was used to estimate the pulse oximetry need for countries that did not provide data. The estimated number of operating theatres ranged from 1Â·0 (95% CI 0Â·9-1Â·2) per 100,000 people in west sub-Saharan Africa to 25Â·1 (20Â·9-30Â·1) per 100,000 in eastern Europe. High-income subregions all averaged more than 14 per 100,000 people, whereas all low-income subregions, representing 2Â·2 billion people, had fewer than two theatres per 100,000. Pulse oximetry data from 54 countries suggested that around 77,700 (63,195-95,533) theatres worldwide (19Â·2% [15Â·2-23Â·9]) were not equipped with pulse oximeters. Improvements in public-health strategies and monitoring are needed to reduce disparities for more than 2 billion people without adequate access to surgical care. WHO. Copyright Â© 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

A.\n\n2007-10-01\n\nSplanchnic ischaemia can ultimately lead to cellular hypoxia and necrosis, and may well contribute to the development of multiple organ failures and increased mortality. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to monitor abdominal organ blood oxygen saturation (SpO2). Pulse oximetry has been widely accepted as a reliable method for monitoring oxygen saturation of arterial blood. Animal studies have also shown it to be effective in the monitoring of blood oxygen saturation in the splanchnic region. However, commercially available pulse oximeter probes are not suitable for the continuous assessment of SpO2 in the splanchnic region. Therefore, there is a need for a new sensor technology that will allow the continuous measurement of SpO2 in the splanchnic area pre-operatively, operatively and post-operatively. For this purpose, a new fibre optic sensor and processing system utilising the principle of reflectance pulse oximetry has been developed. The accuracy in the estimation of SpO2 in pulse oximetry depends on the quality and amplitude of the photoplethysmographic (PPG) signal and for this reason an experimental procedure was carried out to examine the effect of the source-detector separation distance on the acquired PPG signals, and to ultimately select an optimal separation for the final design of the fibre-optic probe. PPG signals were obtained from the finger for different separation distances between the emitting and detecting fibres. Good quality PPG signals with large amplitudes and high signal-to-noise ratio were detected in the range of 3mm to 6mm. At separation distances between 1mm and 2mm, PPG signals were erratic with no resemblance to a conventional PPG signal. At separation distances greater than 6mm, the amplitudes of PPG signals were very small and not appropriate for processing. This investigation indicates the suitability of optical fibres as a new pulse oximetry sensor for estimating blood oxygen saturation (SpO2) in the splanchnic region.\n\nPhotonic textiles for pulse oximetry.\n\nPubMed\n\nRothmaier, Markus; Selm, BÃ¤rbel; Spichtig, Sonja; Haensse, Daniel; Wolf, Martin\n\n2008-08-18\n\nBiomedical sensors, integrated into textiles would enable monitoring of many vitally important physiological parameters during our daily life. In this paper we demonstrate the design and performance of a textile based pulse oximeter, operating on the forefinger tip in transmission mode. The sensors consisted of plastic optical fibers integrated into common fabrics. To emit light to the human tissue and to collect transmitted light the fibers were either integrated into a textile substrate by embroidery (producing microbends with a nominal diameter of 0.5 to 2 mm) or the fibers inside woven patterns have been altered mechanically after fabric production. In our experiments we used a two-wavelength approach (690 and 830 nm) for pulse wave acquisition and arterial oxygen saturation calculation. We have fabricated different specimens to study signal yield and quality, and a cotton glove, equipped with textile based light emitter and detector, has been used to examine movement artifacts. Our results show that textile-based oximetry is feasible with sufficient data quality and its potential as a wearable health monitoring device is promising.\n\nFirst day of life pulse oximetry screening to detect congenital heart defects.\n\nPubMed\n\nMeberg, Alf; BrÃ¼gmann-Pieper, Sabine; Due, Reidar; Eskedal, Leif; Fagerli, IngebjÃ¸rg; Farstad, Teresa; FrÃ¸island, Dag Helge; Sannes, Catharina Hovland; Johansen, Ole Jakob; Keljalic, Jasmina; Markestad, Trond; Nygaard, Egil Andre; RÃ¸svik, Alet; Silberg, Inger Elisabeth\n\n2008-06-01\n\nTo evaluate the efficacy of first day of life pulse oximetry screening to detect congenital heart defects (CHDs). We performed a population-based prospective multicenter study of postductal (foot) arterial oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) in apparently healthy newborns after transfer from the delivery suite to the nursery. SpO(2) < 95% led to further diagnostic evaluations. Of 57,959 live births, 50,008 (86%) were screened. In the screened population, 35 CHDs were [corrected] classified as critical (ductus dependent, cyanotic). CHDs were prospectively registered and diagnosed in 658/57,959 (1.1%) [corrected] Of the infants screened, 324 (0.6%) failed the test. Of these, 43 (13%) had CHDs (27 critical), and 134 (41%) had pulmonary diseases or other disorders. The remaining 147 infants (45%) were healthy with transitional circulation. The median age for babies with CHDs at failing the test was 6 hours (range, 1-21 hours). For identifying critical CHDs, the pulse oximetry screening had a sensitivity rate of 77.1% (95% CI, 59.4-89.0), specificity rate of 99.4% (95% CI, 99.3-99.5), and a false-positive rate of 0.6% (95% CI, 0.5-0.7). Early pulse oximetry screening promotes early detection of critical CHDs and other potentially severe diseases. The sensitivity rate for detecting critical CHDs is high, and the false-positive rate is low.\n\nIn-vitro model for evaluation of pulse oximetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nVegfors, Magnus; Lindberg, Lars-Goeran; Lennmarken, Claes; Oberg, P. Ake\n\n1991-06-01\n\nAn in vitro model with blood circulating in a silicon tubing system and including an artificial arterial bed is an important tool for evaluation of the pulse oximetry technique. The oxygen saturation was measured on an artificial finger using a pulse oximeter (SpO2) and on blood samples using a hemoximeter (SaO2). Measurements were performed at different blood flows and at different blood hematocrits. An increase in steady as well as in pulsatile blood flow was followed by an increase in pulse oximeter readings and a better agreement between SpO2 and SaO2 readings. After diluting the blood with normal saline (decreased hematocrit) the agreement was further improved. These results indicate that the pulse oximeter signal is related to blood hematocrit and the velocity of blood. The flow-related dependance of SpO2 was also evaluated in a human model. These results provided evidence that the pulse oximeter signal is dependent on vascular changes.\n\nCritical congenital heart disease screening with a pulse oximetry in neonates.\n\nPubMed\n\nHamilÃ§Ä±kan, Åahin; Can, Emrah\n\n2018-02-23\n\nTo compare the results of pulse oximetry screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) in newborn infants performed at <24 h and >24 h following. Measurements were taken for each group at <24 h and >24 h following birth. Echocardiography was performed if the SpO2 readings remained abnormal results. A total of 4518 newborns were included in this prospective descriptive study. Of these, 2484 (60.3%) were delivered vaginally and 1685 (39.7%) by cesarean section. Median time points of the screening were 25.4 (25.3-25.5) vs. 17.3 (12.2-22.4) hours after birth. In 4109 infants screened 24 h after birth, the mean pre- and postductal oxygen saturations (SpO2) were 96.5Â±1.99 and 97.7Â±1.98, while 127 infants screened within 24 h of mean preductal and postductal SpO2 were 91.33Â±2.64 and 94.0Â±4.44. No CCHD was detected during the study period. Pulse oximetry screening was false positive for CCHD in 9 of 4109 infants (0.02%); of these, six infants were referred to pediatric cardiology and three cases were diagnosed as other significant, non-cardiac pathology. There were two cases with AVSD (atrioventricular septal defect, three cases with ventricular septal defect (VSD), and one case with patent ductus arteriosus (PDA). Saturation values are different between <24-h and >24-h neonates in pulse oximetry screening. The screening in this study identified infants with other important pathologies, this forms an added value as an assessment tool for newborn infants.\n\nNocturnal oxygen saturation profiles of healthy term infants\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTerrill, Philip Ian; Dakin, Carolyn; Hughes, Ian; Yuill, Maggie; Parsley, Chloe\n\n2015-01-01\n\nObjective Pulse oximetry is used extensively in hospital and home settings to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2). Interpretation of the trend and range of SpO2 values observed in infants is currently limited by a lack of reference ranges using current devices, and may be augmented by development of cumulative frequency (CF) reference-curves. This study aims to provide reference oxygen saturation values from a prospective longitudinal cohort of healthy infants. Design Prospective longitudinal cohort study. Setting Sleep-laboratory. Patients 34 healthy term infants were enrolled, and studied at 2â weeks, 3, 6, 12 and 24â months of age (N=30, 25, 27, 26, 20, respectively). Interventions Full overnight polysomnography, including 2â s averaging pulse oximetry (Masimo Radical). Main outcome measurements Summary SpO2 statistics (mean, median, 5th and 10th percentiles) and SpO2 CF plots were calculated for each recording. CF reference-curves were then generated for each study age. Analyses were repeated with sleep-state stratifications and inclusion of manual artefact removal. Results Median nocturnal SpO2 values ranged between 98% and 99% over the first 2â years of life and the CF reference-curves shift right by 1% between 2â weeks and 3â months. CF reference-curves did not change with manual artefact removal during sleep and did not vary between rapid eye movement (REM) and non-REM sleep. Manual artefact removal did significantly change summary statistics and CF reference-curves during wake. Conclusions SpO2 CF curves provide an intuitive visual tool for evaluating whether an individual's nocturnal SpO2 distribution falls within the range of healthy age-matched infants, thereby complementing summary statistics in the interpretation of extended oximetry recordings in infants.

For our study, we aimed to assess the accuracy of pulse oximetry and to determine the most clinically useful sites for probe placement in llamas and alpacas. The objectives included an analysis of pulse oximetry probes for accurate assessment of llamas and alpacas and to determine the best placement of the probes to achieve accurate readings. For study 1, saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen was measured in 184 arterial blood gas samples (SaO 2 ) using a co-oximeter and compared to saturation of haemoglobin with oxygen simultaneously measured using a pulse oximeter (S p O 2 ). The bias and precision for the SpO 2 -S a O 2 difference was calculated and plotted on a Bland-Altman plot. For study 2, S p O 2 data was collected 624 times from a variety of sites [tongue (T), nasal septum (NS), lip (L), vulva (V), prepuce (P), ear (E), and scrotum (S)] and recorded based upon a percentage of successful readings. Results for study 1 revealed that S p O 2 was consistently 0 to -6% points different than S a O 2 . The bias and precision of the S p O 2 -S a O 2 difference was -2.6Â Â±Â 1.7%. Results for study 2 uncovered that 540 recordings were successful readings and were obtained from the tongue and nasal septum with 97% accuracy, the lip 80%, vulva 62%, prepuce 59%, ear and scrotum < 50%. We concluded that pulse oximetry probes provide reliable estimates of arterial haemoglobin oxygen saturation in llamas and alpacas and is most accurately read when placed on the nasal septum or tongue.\n\nThe efficacy of noninvasive hemoglobin measurement by pulse CO-oximetry in neonates.\n\nPubMed\n\nJung, Young Hwa; Lee, Juyoung; Kim, Han-Suk; Shin, Seung Han; Sohn, Jin A; Kim, Ee-Kyung; Choi, Jung-Hwan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nTo evaluate clinical applicability of noninvasive hemoglobin (Hb) measurement with a pulse CO-oximeter in neonates. Prospective comparison study. Neonatal ICU. Fifty-six preterm and term infants with median age = 20 days (range = 1-98 days) and median weight = 1,440 g (range = 530-4,230 g). Hb measurements by Pulse CO-Oximetry (Masimo Radical-7) were recorded immediately prior to venous samplings. The collected data were compared with the corresponding venous Hb level obtained in laboratory testing, and a total of 137 data pairs were analyzed. Noninvasive Hb values measured with a pulse CO-oximeter were significantly correlated with the venous Hb levels (correlation coefficient, r = 0.758; p < 0.001). Hb values measured with a pulse CO-oximeter were higher than those measured with a laboratory hematology analyzer (13.3 Â± 2.6g/dL vs. 12.5 Â± 3.1g/dL). In terms of the agreement between the laboratory analyzer and the pulse CO-oximeter, 94.8% of the measurements fell within two standard deviations of the mean difference. Noninvasive Hb measurements with Pulse CO-Oximetry provide clinically acceptable accuracy, and they were significantly correlated with laboratory Hb measurement in neonates. In terms of the clinical applicability, noninvasive Hb monitoring with a pulse CO-oximeter could be useful in the early detection of Hb changes in neonates.\n\nIs pulse oximetry an essential tool or just another distraction? The role of the pulse oximeter in modern anesthesia care.\n\nPubMed\n\nShah, Amit; Shelley, Kirk H\n\n2013-06-01\n\nSince the discovery of anesthetic agents, patient monitoring has been considered one of the core responsibilities of the anesthesiologist. As depicted in Robert Hinckley's famous painting, The First Operation with Ether, one observes William Thomas Green Morton carefully watching over his patient. Since its founding in 1905, 'Vigilance' has been the motto of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA). Over a hundred years have passed, and one would think we would be clear regarding what we are watching for and how we should be watching. On the contrary, the introduction of new technology and outcome research is requiring us to re-examine our fundamental assumptions regarding what is and what is not important in the care of the patient. A vast majority of anesthesiologists would refuse to proceed with an anesthetic without the presence of a pulse oximeter. On the other hand, outcome studies have failed to demonstrate an improvement in patient care with their use. For that matter, it can be argued that outcome studies have yet to demonstrate an unambiguous role for any monitor of any type (i.e. blood pressure cuff or ECG), as outcome studies may fail to capture rare events. Because of the increased safety that has been attributed to pulse oximetry, it is unlikely that further studies can or will be conducted. As we enter a new era of clinical monitoring, with an emphasis on noninvasive cardiovascular monitoring, it might be of benefit to examine the role of the pulse oximeter in clinical care. This article reviews the available evidence for pulse oximetry. Further, it discusses contemporary issues, events, and perceptions that may help to explain how and why pulse oximetry may have been adopted as a standard of care despite the lack of supportive. Lastly, it discusses less obvious benefits of pulse oximetry that may have further implications on the future of anesthesia care and perhaps even automated anesthesia.\n\nInaccurate pulse CO-oximetry of carboxyhemoglobin due to digital clubbing: case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nHarlan, Nicole; Weaver, Lindell K; Deru, Kayla\n\n2016-01-01\n\nNewer pulse CO-oximeters provide a non-invasive and quick means of measuring oxyhemoglobin, carboxyhemoglobin and methemoglobin. Clubbing has been reported to cause inaccuracy in pulse oximeters. We present a case of inaccurate carboxy-hemoglobin measurement by pulse CO-oximetry due to digital clubbing. An 18-year-old man with a history of cystic fibrosis presented after a suicide attempt by inhalation of exhaust. At the initial emergency department evaluation, his blood carboxyhemoglobin was 33%. He was intubated, placed on 100% oxygen and transferred to our facility. Upon arrival, we placed three different pulse CO-oximeters on different fingers and toes. Carboxyhemoglobin levels measured by these meters ranged from 9%-11%. A venous blood gas drawn on arrival showed a carboxyhemoglobin level of 2.3% after four hours on 100% oxygen by endotracheal tube. Thirty minutes later, we checked arterial blood gas, which revealed a COHb level of 0.9%. Again, non-invasive carboxyhemoglobin measurements read 10%. The patient was treated with hyperbaric oxygen for carbon monoxide poisoning. This case suggests that non-invasive measurements of carboxyhemoglobin should be correlated with the clinic history and with an arterial or venous blood gas oximetry analysis.\n\nThe Accuracy of Noninvasive Peripheral Pulse Oximetry After Palliative Cardiac Surgery in Patients With Cyanotic Congenital Heart Disease.\n\nPubMed\n\nScrimgeour, Gemma E; Griksaitis, Michael J; Pappachan, John V; Baldock, Andrew J\n\n2017-01-01\n\nChildren with cyanotic congenital heart disease (CCHD) live with oxyhemoglobin saturations that are typically expressed as percentages in the range of 70s and 80s. Peripheral pulse oximetry (measurement of SpO 2 ) performs poorly in this range and yet is widely used to inform clinical decisions in these patients. The reference standard is co-oximetry of arterial samples (SaO 2 ). In this study, 515 paired measurements of SpO 2 and SaO 2 were taken from 19 children who had undergone palliative cardiac surgery. SpO 2 (Masimo SET LNCS Neo pulse oximeter) overestimated oxyhemoglobin saturation in 82% of measurements (mean 4.6% Â± 6.6%). There was a strong negative correlation between mean bias and SaO 2 ( r = -.96, P = .002, 95% confidence interval: -0.99 to -0.68). The results raise a concern that critical hypoxemia may go undetected and untreated if pulse oximetry is relied upon as the primary means of assessing oxyhemoglobin saturation in children with CCHD. Strong preference must be given to co-oximetry of arterial samples.\n\nA model for technology assessment applied to pulse oximetry. The Technology Assessment Task Force of the Society of Critical Care Medicine.\n\nPubMed\n\n1993-04-01\n\nTo test a model for the assessment of critical care technology. To develop practice guidelines for the use of pulse oximetry. A computer-assisted search of the English language literature and interviews with recognized experts in the field of pulse oximetry. Those studies that addressed one or more of the seven questions contained in our technology assessment template were analyzed. Study design was not a factor in article selection. However, the lack of well-designed clinical outcome studies was an important factor in determining the method of practice policy development we utilized. A focus person summarized the data from the selected studies that related to each of the seven assessment questions. The preliminary data summary developed by the focus person was further analyzed and refined by the task force and then sent to 16 expert reviewers for comment. These expert comments were considered by the task force, and this final consensus report was developed. Pulse oximetry combines the principles of spectrophotometry and plethysmography to noninvasively measure oxygen saturation with a high degree of accuracy over the range of 80% to 100% saturation, assuming the device is being used according to the manufacturer's instructions and without any adverse operating conditions. The appropriate clinical uses of pulse oximetry fall into one of two broad categories: as a warning system based on continuous real-time measurement of arterial desaturation, or as an end-point for titration of therapeutic interventions. There are no published studies that allow for definitive, outcome-based conclusions concerning either the clinical impact or cost-benefit ratio of pulse oximetry. The model developed for technology assessment proved to be appropriate for assessing pulse oximetry. The available data have allowed us to develop an evidence-based practice policy for the use of pulse oximetry in critical care. Critical care clinicians, researchers, and industry have a shared\n\nPulse oximetry in the pulmonary tissue for the non-invasive measurement of mixed venous oxygen saturation.\n\nPubMed\n\nNitzan, Meir; Nitzan, Itamar\n\n2013-08-01\n\nThe oxygen saturation of the systemic arterial blood is associated with the adequacy of respiration, and can be measured non-invasively by pulse oximetry in the systemic tissue. The oxygen saturation of the blood in the pulmonary artery, the mixed venous blood, reflects the balance between oxygen supply to the systemic tissues and their oxygen demand. The mixed venous oxygen saturation has also clinical significance because it is used in Fick equation for the quantitative measurement of cardiac output. At present the measurement of the mixed venous oxygen saturation is invasive and requires insertion of a Swan-Ganz catheter into the pulmonary artery. We suggest a noninvasive method for the measurement of the mixed venous oxygen saturation in infants, pulmonary pulse oximetry. The method is similar to the systemic pulse oximetry, which is based on the different light absorption curves of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin and on the analysis of photoplethysmographic curves in two wavelengths. The proposed pulmonary pulse oximeter includes light-sources of two wavelengths in the infrared, which illuminate the pulmonary tissue through the thoracic wall. Part of the light which is scattered back from the pulmonary tissue and passes through the thoracic wall is detected, and for each wavelength a pulmonary photoplethysmographic curve is obtained. The pulmonary photoplethysmographic curves reflect blood volume increase during systole in the pulmonary arteries in the lung tissue, which contain mixed venous blood. The ratio R of the amplitude-to-baseline ratio for the two wavelengths is related to the mixed venous oxygen saturation through equations derived for the systemic pulse oximetry. The method requires the use of extinction coefficients values for oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin, which can be found in the literature. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Newborn screening for critical congenital heart disease (CCHD) using pulse oximetry is an effective and life-saving strategy in developed countries. While most studies have reported false-positive results during CCHD screening, they have not elaborated on the detected disease types. We studied the effectiveness and outcomes of pulse oximetry newborn screening for non-cardiac hypoxemic diseases such as neonatal sepsis, respiratory diseases, and CCHD in a middle-income country. In a pilot study performed at the University Malaya Medical Centre (UMMC), Malaysia, all apparently healthy term newborns, delivered at UMMC were screened pre-discharge using pulse oximetry. Echocardiography was performed for newborns that had positive screening results on two separate occasions, 1-h apart. Newborns with normal echocardiograms were evaluated and treated for other non-cardiac diseases. Fifteen of 5247 term newborns had positive screening results. The median age at screening was 20 h. Thirteen newborns (0.24%) had significant non-cardiac diseases: sepsis (n = 2) and respiratory diseases (n = 11) that required hospitalization and treatment. The remaining two newborns with normal antenatal ultrasonograms had positive screening test and confirmed to have CCHD. Another 18 newborns with negative screening test were later admitted for treatment of sepsis (n = 16) and penumonia (n = 2). All newborns were treated and alive at the end of the study. The sensitivity and specificity of pulse oximetry screening for non-cardiac diseases were 42% and 99.9% respectively, and 100% and 99.7% for CCHD, respectively. Routine pulse oximetry screening test was effective in identifying newborns with CCHD and other hypoxemia illnesses, which may led to potential life-threatening condition.

In obstetrics, fetal heart rate monitoring remains the standard for intrapartum assessment of fetal well being. Fetal oxygen saturation monitoring is a new technique currently under development. It is potentially superior to electronic fetal heart rate monitoring (cardiotocography) because it allows direct assessment of both fetal oxygen status and fetal tissue perfusion. Here we present the analysis for determining the most optimal wavelength selection for pulse oximetry. The wavelengths we chose as the most optimal are: the first in the range of 670-720nm and the second in the range of 825-925nm. Further we discuss the possible systematic errors during our measurements, and their contribution to the obtained saturation results.\n\nNocturnal oxygen saturation profiles of healthy term infants.\n\nPubMed\n\nTerrill, Philip Ian; Dakin, Carolyn; Hughes, Ian; Yuill, Maggie; Parsley, Chloe\n\n2015-01-01\n\nPulse oximetry is used extensively in hospital and home settings to measure arterial oxygen saturation (SpO2).

More recently several monitors have been approved in the United States and elsewhere and the technique is emerging as a useful tool for assessing not only adequate cerebral oxygenation but also tissue oxygenation and perfusion in other organs.\n\nNew laser system for highly sensitive clinical pulse oximetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHamza, Mostafa; Hamza, Mohammad\n\n1996-04-01\n\nThis paper describes the theory and design of a new pulse oximeter in which laser diodes and other compact laser sources are used for the measurement of oxygen saturation in patients who are at risk of developing hypoxemia. The technique depends upon illuminating special sites of the skin of the patient with radiation from modulated laser sources at selected wavelengths. The specific laser wavelengths are chosen based on the absorption characteristics of oxyhemoglobin, reduced hemoglobin and other interfering sources for obtaining more accurate measurements. The laser radiation transmitted through the tissue is detected and signal processing based on differential absorption laser spectroscopy is done in such a way to overcome the primary performance limitations of the conventionally used pulse oximetry. The new laser pulse oximeter can detect weak signals and is not affected by other light sources such as surgical lamps, phototherapy units, etc. The detailed description and operating characteristics of this system are presented.\n\nCan we Replace Arterial Blood Gas Analysis by Pulse Oximetry in Neonates with Respiratory Distress Syndrome, who are Treated According to INSURE Protocol?\n\nPubMed Central\n\nNiknafs, Pedram; Norouzi, Elahe; Bahman Bijari, Bahareh; Baneshi, Mohammad Reza\n\n2015-01-01\n\nNeonates with respiratory distress syndrome (RDS), who are treated according to INSURE protocol; require arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis to decide on appropriate management. We conducted this study to investigate the validity of pulse oximetry instead of frequent ABG analysis in the evaluation of these patients. From a total of 193 blood samples obtained from 30 neonates <1500 grams with RDS, 7.2% were found to have one or more of the followings: acidosis, hypercapnia, or hypoxemia. We found that pulse oximetry in the detection of hyperoxemia had a good validity to appropriately manage patients without blood gas analysis. However, the validity of pulse oximetry was not good enough to detect acidosis, hypercapnia, and hypoxemia.

Objective methods to assess the viability and blood circulation of the anastomosis could help in preventing leaks. Intraoperative pulse oximetry is a cheap, easy to use, fast, and readily available method to assess tissue viability. Our aim was to study whether intraoperative pulse oximetry can predict the development of an anastomotic leak. The study was a prospective single-arm study conducted between the years 2005 and 2011 in Helsinki University Hospital. Patient material consisted of 422 patients undergoing elective left-sided colorectal surgery. The patients were operated by one of the three surgeons. All of the operations were partial or total resections of the left side of the colon with a colorectal anastomosis. The intraoperative colonic oxygen saturation was measured with pulse oximetry from the colonic wall, and the values were analyzed with respect to post-operative complications. 2.3 times more operated anastomotic leaks occurred when the colonic StO 2 was â¤â90% (11/129 vs 11/293). The mean colonic StO 2 was 91.1 in patients who developed an operated anastomotic leak and 93.0 in patients who did not. With logistic regression analysis, the risk of operated anastomotic leak was 4.2 times higher with StO 2 values â¤â90%. Low intraoperative colonic StO 2 values are associated with the occurrence of anastomotic leak. Despite its handicaps, the method seems to be useful in assessing anastomotic viability.\n\nAssessment of continuous acoustic respiratory rate monitoring as an addition to a pulse oximetry-based patient surveillance system.\n\nPubMed\n\nMcGrath, Susan P; Pyke, Joshua; Taenzer, Andreas H\n\n2017-06-01\n\nTechnology advances make it possible to consider continuous acoustic respiratory rate monitoring as an integral component of physiologic surveillance systems. This study explores technical and logistical aspects of augmenting pulse oximetry-based patient surveillance systems with continuous respiratory rate monitoring and offers some insight into the impact on patient deterioration detection that may result. Acoustic respiratory rate sensors were introduced to a general care pulse oximetry-based surveillance system with respiratory rate alarms deactivated. Simulation was used after 4324 patient days to determine appropriate alarm thresholds for respiratory rate, which were then activated. Data were collected for an additional 4382 patient days. Physiologic parameters, alarm data, sensor utilization and patient/staff feedback were collected throughout the study and analyzed. No notable technical or workflow issues were observed. Sensor utilization was 57Â %, with patient refusal leading reasons for nonuse (22.7Â %). With respiratory rate alarm thresholds set to 6 and 40Â breaths/min., the majority of nurse pager clinical notifications were triggered by low oxygen saturation values (43Â %), followed by low respiratory rate values (21Â %) and low pulse rate values (13Â %). Mean respiratory rate collected was 16.6Â Â±Â 3.8Â breaths/min. The vast majority (82Â %) of low oxygen saturation states coincided with normal respiration rates of 12-20Â breaths/min. Continuous respiratory rate monitoring can be successfully added to a pulse oximetry-based surveillance system without significant technical, logistical or workflow issues and is moderately well-tolerated by patients. Respiratory rate sensor alarms did not significantly impact overall system alarm burden. Respiratory rate and oxygen saturation distributions suggest adding continuous respiratory rate monitoring to a pulse oximetry-based surveillance system may not significantly improve patient deterioration detection.\n\nNoncontact simultaneous dual wavelength photoplethysmography: A further step toward noncontact pulse oximetry\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHumphreys, Kenneth; Ward, Tomas; Markham, Charles\n\n2007-04-01\n\nWe present a camera-based device capable of capturing two photoplethysmographic (PPG) signals at two different wavelengths simultaneously, in a remote noncontact manner.
