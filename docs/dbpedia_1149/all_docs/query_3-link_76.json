This re-make isn’t your garden variety “touch-up job” though, this is a full on re-do from the ground up, so much so that it might as well be a brand new game. Other than that, this week is super light on major releases, but chock full of smaller titles that will all be trying to jockey for your attention between zombie killing sprees. Let’s take a look!\n\nResident Evil 2 (PC/PS4/Xbox One) – Releases Jan. 25th\n\nJanuary 21st, 1998; Resident Evil 2 hit store shelves in North America, introducing the world to Claire Redfield and Leon S. Kennedy. Leaving the confines of the first game’s mansion and underground laboratory, players were transported to the city streets, and the museum-esque Raccoon City Police Department, before heading into other murky, underground locales. It was, for some time, the best Resident Evil game (4 took the top spot in my opinion), and now, 21 years later, almost to the day, we get to play it all over again in stunning 4K HD, with completely new graphics, gameplay and engine. The success of 2017’s Resident Evil 7 seemed to reengage the public’s interest in the franchise, and while a sequel might have been the more logical choice, the smart choice seems to have been this remake, because if pre-sales are any indication then this will be the biggest selling Resident Evil game of all time. It’ll be good to jump back into the world of zombie horror, I could use a good scare.\n\nBattlefleet Gothic: Armada 2 (PC) – Releases Jan. 24th\n\nBy the end of 2018 I was surprised if a Warhammer game didn’t come out once a month, and it looks like 2019 won’t be much different. January brings us our first Warhammer game of 2019 with Battlefleet Gotic: Armada 2. Set in the 40k mythos, this tactical space game is the sequel to the 2016 release, which currently has mixed reviews on Steam. This new entry promises “…richer content, and bigger, more impressive fleets, ships, and strategies…”, according to the official website. This is an RTS game, through and through, with large scale space battles that, according to a friend of mine, is like taking one flying church and smashing it into another flying church. You know, that same, tired old story.\n\nLEGRAND LEGACY: Tale of the Fatebounds (PC/Switch) – Releases Jan. 24th.\n\nThis indie RPG is being developed by Semisoft, an indie game company that is based in…well, I have no idea, really. I don’t think they’re Japanese, but they are certainly obsessed with JRPG’s, particularly it seems with the ones found on the PSX and PS2. They claim that their title, which I believe is their first game, is a spiritual successor to all of the great JRPG’s of yesteryear. I mean, we’ve got an actual, full blown JRPG coming next week, but if you need to scratch that itch, and you’re already done with the Tales of Vesperia remake, then this should tide you over until Kingdom Hearts III.\n\nPikuniku (PC/Switch) – Releases Jan. 24th\n\nDevolver sure is a funky studio. They remind me of an indie version of Rockstar, making games that break the mold and reshape it for future imitation. Their latest title, Pikuniku, looks like those old Colorforms toys we all had as kids (at lease I did), brought to life. The official website touts the game as a puzzle-adventure, set in a strange and playful world. Despite the colorful demeanor, the game apparently takes place in a future dystopia, tasking you, the player, with helping your neighbors overcome various struggles as you help to expose a deep state conspiracy; and who says video games don’t have anything important to say?\n\nPorts and Re-releases:\n\nSenran Kagura Burst Re:Newal (PC/PS4) – Releases Jan. 22nd. Originally released as a side scrolling 3DS title in 2013, Burst Re:Newal is now fully 3d, so you can stare at half naked Japanese teenagers on your television in 4k. If you’re getting this for the gameplay (which is like saying you buy Playboy for the articles), you’ll find yourself beating the shit out of enemies using the all new “burst mechanic”, allowing for infinite aerial combos, which according to the website means you’ll not only rip your opponent’s health bar to shreds, but also their clothes. Can’t you just look at porn instead? Remember that Mr. Show sketch about CD-ROM porn vs. a magazine? “The digital images are so impersonal compared to the warm magazine you can touch“. I’m going to post it below (I guess NSFW?):\n\nSMITE (Switch) – Releases Jan. 24th. The popular MOBA from Hi-Rez Studios is now coming to Switch, as all games are destined to, for it was foretold by the ancient soothsayers, and lo, it shall come to pass! In SMITE, you control a god, goddess, or other mythological character, in an attempt to destroy your opponent’s towers, just like every other MOBA game. I honestly don’t see anything to set SMITE from DOTA 2, League of Legends, Heroes of the Storm, or any other MOBA on the market. I would say this good for Switch owners if it was the only MOBA on the system, but it isn’t; you can already get Arena of Valor and Paladins, but I guess SMITE is the oldest of the bunch, if that does anything for you. Fun fact, I know a guy who used to work on this game, so you know, I’m pretty cool. I have connections.\n\nEverything else:\n\nLife is Strange 2 – Episode 2: Rules (PC/PS4/ Xbox One) – Releases Jan. 24th. Remember The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit, the surprise game demo released after E3 2018 that was supposed to tie into Life Is Strange 2? Well that (very) short game is now finally going to be worth the play through. After the events of the first episode of season 2, Sean and Daniel end up at their grandparent’s house, who just so happen to be neighbors with Chris, Captain Spirit’s protagonist. With him in the episode that means we’ll finally get the resolution to that game’s cliffhanger ending.\n\nAt Sundown (PC/PS4/Switch/Xbox One). A 4-player deathmatch game with maps that are covered in darkness. According to the Steam description, you must stay out of the light or else you’ll be in for a world of pain.\n\nA Fisherman’s Tale (HTC/PSVR/Vive). In this VR game you are the titular fisherman, a small puppet who learns that his little world is about to be hit by a terrible storm. Using your wits, you must reach the top of your lighthouse and turn on the beacon to keep your puppet pals safe, but as the Steam description says, everything is not what it seems, and there is a whole other world outside of your tiny little home. It could be interesting, if you’re into VR.\n\nFuturegrind (PC/PS4/Switch). Looking like a Uniracers clone, this little indie title looks to challenge your reflexes as you race your weird, two wheeled bike, thing, around a fragmented, elevated track. This is the kind of game that gives me heart palpitations (or maybe that’s French fries), they stress me out.\n\nSonar Beat (Android/iOS/PC). Here’s a weird game, maybe Steam can explain it best, “In Sonar Beat, your most valuable ally is rhythm. Your super secret nuclear submarine is under attack and only the most intense musical defense can save it! Boost your senses and launch a counter attack to the music to save yourself”. Did that help?\n\nSwitchblade (PC/PS4). Do you like e-sports? Why? I mean, Switchblade looks cool…\n\nAt The Gates (PC) – Releases Jan. 23rd. Iconic developer, no…maybe well known developer, no…um developer? Sure, developer Jon Shafer has released a Civilization clone; but it’s cool though, he worked on Civ V, so it’s all good man.\n\nJack Quest: The Tale of the Sword (PS4/Switch/Xbox One) – Releases Jan. 24th. Your girlfriend has been kidnapped by evil orcs. Take up arms and delve deep into the underworld to save the helpless woman, because you’re a man, and that’s just what men do!\n\nNotable Releases from 10, 20 and 30 years ago:\n\nOne re-make, one 3D re-invention, and one forgotten lump of coal. These are your games of yesteryear; you’re welcome.\n\nRygar: The Battle of Argus (Wii) – Released Jan. 28th, 2009: Wiki Link\n\nEven in 2009 companies were re-releasing their titles for Nintendo consoles. The 2002 title Rygar: The Legendary Adventure came out for the PlayStation 2, receiving pretty favorable reviews, but the 2009 re-release for the Wii on the other hand, well let’s just say it received fucking terrible reviews. Like many of the titles released for the Wii, this game was saddled with completely unnecessary motion controls that, instead of feeling intuitive and fun, were confusing and poorly implemented. If you need your Rygar fix, just pick up the PS2 version, or better yet, grab the NES version and play that one.\n\nCastlevania 64 (Nintendo 64) – Released Jan. 26th, 1999: Wiki Link\n\nJust like every game released on the Wii had motion controls forced on them, in the mid to late 90’s, it was believed that every 2D side scroller from the NES/SNES needed to be forced into 3D. Sony believed in this so much that they practically refused to release any 2D Japanese PSX titles in the US. In what must have been seen as a major coup at the time, Konami announced that they would be releasing an exclusive 3D Castlevania game for the Nintendo 64 (it’s the future!), unlike the PlayStation that would get a *SNORT* 2D platformer (soooo early 90’s). Well, as time has shown, that “crappy” 2D game, Symphony of the Night, would go on to be regarded as a masterpiece, while Castlevania 64 would be best remembered as, sadly, that terrible 3D Castlevania game. The game was so poorly received over the years that Konami has scrubbed its existence from the official timeline, basically marooning the game in lore limbo. I recently played the game and found it to be much more entertaining as an adult, than I did as a teenager, with some genuinely nice graphics for the time, and some pretty engaging game play. Konami would continue to make both 2D and 3D Castlevania games, including the decent Lament of Innocence on the PS2, but their first 3D effort kind of missed the mark.\n\nStar Soldier (NES) – Released Jan. 1989: Wiki Link\n\nIf you can tell what the hell is going on in the above image I’ll give you a dollar.\n\nReleased in Japan in 1986, this vertical shooter wouldn’t make it to North America until January, 1989. Originally seen as a standard of innovation in Japan, the title was a bit passé to American audiences who had already moved on to more, at the time, sophisticated games. Despite the low notoriety, the game has had several sequels, with at least three I can find in North America, Super Star Soldier, Soldier Blade and Star Soldier: Vanishing Earth, and then went back to Japan only releases throughout the 2000’s. The game was eventually re-released on the Wii’s Virtual Console and The App Store to middling reviews, with most modern reviews stating that the game was near unplayable due to the high level of difficulty and confusing stage layouts. This game seems to be all but forgotten in North America, and probably for good reason, but to the few people that picked it up in January of 1989, I hope they were able to get some enjoyment out of it.\n\nI don’t have much experience with the three games from yesteryear, but I do have a Resident Evil story. Back in 1999 I worked my final year as a staff member at my favorite summer camp, which meant I wasn’t home for most of the summer. Just before I left I had purchased the director’s cut of Resident Evil for the PlayStation, maybe popped it in once just to give it a look, and then put it back in the case as I went off to shoot bows & arrows and hike up mountains. Apparently, in my absence, my two little brothers decided to play my copy of Resident Evil. Of my two brothers, one being 10 and the other being 7, the younger one was a total scaredy cat. As the older of the two of them played through the game, the younger one would sit in terror, fingers over his eyes and wishing that the older brother would stop playing this horrific game and switch to something more wholesome, like, I don’t know, Parappa The Rapper or something. Anyway, my younger brother took the game out of the case while no one was looking, and stuck a big wad of gum on the disc, before placing it back in the jewel case, hoping that his bit of sabotage would destroy this evil thing that was plaguing both his day time reality and night time dreams. Sure enough, the gum had done something horrible to the disc, rendering it totally unplayable. I would come home just a few days later and try to play it, only to find out that it was completely ruined. Thanks little bro, your fear of zombies led to a story that I’ll be telling for years to come.\n\nWho could stay mad at this little face:\n\nShare this:"
