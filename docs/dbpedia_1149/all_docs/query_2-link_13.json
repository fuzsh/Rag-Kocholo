It was released in Australasia and Europe in April and July 2009, respectively, published by Rising Star Games. It is loosely based on the 1986 arcade game Rygar and its 1987 NES port.\n\nSet several years after the Roman Empire's conquest of Egypt, the game tells the story of Rygar, a heavy infantryman in the navy of Argus, a fictional Roman-controlled Mediterranean island. When Princess Harmonia of Argus is kidnapped by a group of Titans, Rygar is tasked by an ethereal voice to save her. To accomplish this, he is given the Diskarmor, a legendary weapon forged by the gods themselves. Believing his mission to be that of a simple rescue, Rygar soon discovers that there is much more to the Titans' objectives than he initially imagined, and soon, the fate of the world itself comes to hang in the balance."
