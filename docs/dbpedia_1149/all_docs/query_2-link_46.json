        "text": "Value of gallium 67 citrate scintigraphy in ophthalmology\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nIvanez-Alloschery, Monique.\n\n1978-01-01\n\nFor ophthalmologists scintigraphy appears as a simple method to detect endoocular or endoorbital abnormalities. However none of the many scintigraphic methods described seems reliable enough to be used alone. One of the latest isotopic explorations using gallium 67 citrate, a tracer considered tumour-tropic might be able to solve this problem. The aim of this work is to judge the value of the method in the diagnosis of malignant endoocular and endoorbital tumours on the basis of 24 anatomoclinical observations. It may be concluded from this study that ocular gallium 67 citrate scintigraphy, which gave no clearly positive results at all but some doubtful results in the case of endoocular tumours more than 5 mm in diameter, is to be rejected; fluorescein angiography and ocular echograhy provide more elements for an accurate etiological diagnosis. Orbital scintigraphy on the other hand seems to be a necessary complement to a tomodensitometric examination since both methods offer diagnostic information without systematic recurse to carotid arteriography or orbital phlebography, sometimes dangerous for the patient [fr\n\nMyocardial scintigraphy with gallium-67 in the detection of cardiac acute rejection\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMeneguetti, J.C.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nIn order to evaluate the myocardial scintigraphy with Gallium-67 potentiality in the detection of acute rejection phenomenon, 105 studies were performed in 20 patients after they had a heart transplantation. The scintigraphic images were obtained by a conventional camera-computer system. These images were acquired 48 hours after all the patients were given an intravenous injection of 111 MBq of Gallium-67 Citrate. The biopsies were done according to the Mason technique and the histological analysis followed the Billingham standards.

Early gallium-67 scintigraphy demonstrated increased uptake in the subcutaneous tissues of the face and thighs. As a result of these findings skin biopsy was obtained from the right thigh which gave a diagnosis of borderline lepromatous leprosy. The authors have been unable to find other reports of gallium-67 scintigraphy in leprosy but the pattern of gallium-67 distribution should suggest the diagnosis. 5 refs., 1 fig\n\n67Gallium citrate scintigraphy to assess metastatic spread in a dog with an oral melanoma.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLiuti, T; de Vos, J; Bosman, T; van de Wiele, C; Grinwis, G C M; van Bree, H; Peremans, K\n\n2009-01-01\n\nGallium scintigraphy was used to evaluate therapeutic response in a 10-year-old, male, Dutch sheepdog, suffering from an oral melanoma. Treatment was performed with a combination of carboplatin and hypofractionated radiation. Nineteen weeks after radiation therapy, the left submandibular lymph node was surgically removed because of metastatic disease. Thirty weeks after radiation therapy, 67Gallium scintigraphy was performed to assess for residual disease and metastasis. Increased uptake in the right submandibular lymph node area was noted and identified as a melanoma metastasis on cytology. Surgical excision was performed. Twenty-one weeks later, the dog was euthanased because of advanced pulmonary metastases. This report of a case of oral melanoma illustrates the advantages of 67Gallium scintigraphy in monitoring for the presence of metastatic disease and effectiveness of therapy.\n\nGallium-67 scintigraphy and the Heart\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nGarayt, D.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nAlthough gallium-67 was initially used for tumor imaging, clinical studies suggested its potential use as a method of detecting occult inflammatory lesions. The demonstration of diffuse myocardial uptake of gallium-67 during Lyme disease myocarditis is consistent with a pattern of diffuse myocarditis as seen in sarcoid myocarditis. Two cases are presented. A critical review of the various applications of gallium-67 scintigraphy to myocardium investigation is carried out [fr\n\nPulmonary scintigraphy by citrate of Ga67 for HIV(+) patients or AIDS. Scintigraphie pulmonaire au citrate de Ga67 chez des patients VIH(+) ou sida\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nDaumal, J.; Pena, C.; Mata, F.; Paternostro, C.; Penafiel, A. (Hopital Son Dureta, Palma de Mallorca (Spain))\n\n1993-04-01\n\nPulmonary scintigraphy with citrate of gallium 67 is useful when combined with a thorax radiography to establish the presence of an infection. When the two examinations are negative we can conclude there is no infection, but if the radiography is positive with a scintiscanning negative the most possible diagnosis is tuberculosis. If the scintiscanning is positive with a diffuse model we can envisage a pneumonia by Pneumocystis Carinii and if the model is ganglionic we can think to tuberculosis. 4 tabs.\n\nGallium-67 citrate localization in disseminated sporotrichosis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMoreno, A.J.; Brazier, J.M.; Baker, F.J.; Fox, B.J.; Pittman, D.L.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA 25-year-old woman demonstrated Ga-67 citrate accumulation within a facial cutaneous lesion and two subcutaneous nodules within the right lower extremity. Cultures of the facial lesion and one of the subcutaneous nodules grew Sporothrix schenckii. Ga-67 citrate uptake has not been reported previously with this fungal infection. Ga-67 citrate scintigraphy was helpful in defining the extent of the disease, following its course, and determining the response to therapy\n\nComparison of technetium-99m methoxyisobutylisonitrile and gallium-67 citrate scanning in the assessment of lymphomas\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nZiegels, P.; Nocaudie, M.; Huglo, D.; Deveaux, M.; Detourmignies, L.; Wattel, E.; Marchandise, X.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the value of scintigraphy using technetium-99m methoxy-isobutylisonitrile (MIBI) with that of scintigraphy using gallium-67 citrate in the assessment of Hodgkin's disease and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and to relate these results with those of CT scan and MRI. Fifty-eight patients were included either for a follow-up examination or for monitoring of their treatment. Twenty-three residual masses were studied. A whole-body scan was performed, followed by single-photon emission computed tomography (SPET) 20 min after injection of 740 MBq of 99m Tc-MIBI and 72 h after injection of 185 MBq of 67 Ga citrate. The overall sensitivity of 99m Tc-MIBI and 67 Ga citrate was 71% and 68%, respectively, and the overall specificity was 76% and 44%, respectively. For residual masses, the sensitivity was 44% with both tracers and the specificity was 80% with 99m Tc-MIBI and 53% with 67 Ga citrate. The positive predictive values were 85% and 68% and the negative predictive values were 59% and 44%, respectively. The signal-to-background ratio was 1.5 for 99m Tc-MIBI and 2 for 67 Ga citrate. At present, 99m Tc-MIBI cannot replace 67 Ga citrate in the assessment of lymphomas.

Gallium scintigraphy have been done for 11 cases of ASD (3 males and 8 females) and 4 females were positive. Among these, 67 Ga-citrate was accumulated to the bone marrow in all 4 cases and to the major joints in 2 cases. Positive cases were rather serious and administered more immunosuppressants than negative cases. In order to characterize gallium scintigraphy findings of ASD, i.e. bone marrow accumulation, we analyzed 130 cases of collagen vascular disease. Although 101 cases (77.7%) were positive, only 7 cases (5.4%) showed the accumulation of 67 Ga-citrate to the bone marrow. These include 3 cases with ASD, and 1 case with systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis and Sjogren's syndrome. We also accumulated 18 patients who exhibited bone marrow accumulation of 69 Ga-citrate, and found that 7 patients had collagen vascular and their related diseases. In conclusion, bone marrow accumulation in gallium scintigraphy is a specific feature of collagen vascular diseases, especially ASD, and it is suggested that cases with positive gallium scintigraphy in ASD can be serious and resistant to treatment.

Whole-body scintigraphy was performed 48-72 h following i.v. injection of 370 MBq gallium-67 citrate. 'Gold standards' for truth determinations were surgery, autopsy, histology, axial X-ray computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasonography and clinical follow-up. Overall, 181 of 234 studies were true negative. Eighty proven sites of disease had true positive 67 Ga uptake (in 21 patients/37 studies). Nineteen sites (in 12 patients/15 studies) were false positive. In addition, 31 benign lesions were detected and interpreted correctly in terms of non-malignancy. Ten lymphoma sites (in 6 patients/10 studies) were missed by scintigraphy. Overall, sensitivity of gallium scintigraphy was 89% when calculated by sites and 79% when calculated by studies. Corresponding specificities were 91% and 92%, respectively. Positive predictive values were 81% (sites) and 71% (studies), and negative predictive values 95% (sites and studies). Thus, gallium scintigraphy proved to be a sensitive and specific method for staging and follow-up in patients with small, non-cleaved cell lymphoma. (orig.)\n\nA case of muscular sarcoidosis diagnosed by gallium-67 scintigraphy and magnetic resonance imaging\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSohn, Hyung Sun; Kim, Euy Neyng\n\n1999-01-01\n\nGallium-67 scintigraphy is helpful in the assessment of active extrapulmonary sarcoidosis. Muscular involvement of sarcoidosis is often asymptomatic or nonspecific, and laboratory examinations do not provide convincing evidence of muscular involvement. We report a case of muscular sarcoidosis, which was detected by gallium-67 scintigraphy. In a patient who was suffering from fever and arthalgia of knee joint, gallium-67 scintigraphy showed mediastinal and hilar involvement of sarcoidosis with unexpected extensive muscular uptake. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed the detailed depiction of intramuscular infiltration of sarcoid granuloma. Gallium-67 scintigraphy is useful in detecting inflammatory muscular involvement of sarcoidosis as well as other multiorgan involvement\n\nBone marrow accumulation in gallium scintigraphy in patients with adult still's disease\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nKanegae, Futoshi; Tada, Yoshifumi; Ohta, Akihide; Ushiyama, Osamu; Suzuki; Noriaki; Koarada, Syuichi; Haruta, Yoshio; Yoshikai, Tomonori; Nagasawa, Kohei [Saga Medical School (Japan)\n\n2002-12-01\n\nWe investigated the features and the usefulness of gallium scintigraphy in the diagnosis and the assessment of Adult Still's disease (ASD) by retrospective case review.

Although 101 cases (77.7%) were positive, only 7 cases (5.4%) showed the accumulation of {sup 67}Ga-citrate to the bone marrow. These include 3 cases with ASD, and 1 case with systemic lupus erythematosus, polyarteritis nodosa, Wegener's granulomatosis and Sjogren's syndrome. We also accumulated 18 patients who exhibited bone marrow accumulation of {sup 69}Ga-citrate, and found that 7 patients had collagen vascular and their related diseases. In conclusion, bone marrow accumulation in gallium scintigraphy is a specific feature of collagen vascular diseases, especially ASD, and it is suggested that cases with positive gallium scintigraphy in ASD can be serious and resistant to treatment.

This study is the first Iranian preliminary survey of colonic transit scintigraphy using 67 Ga -citrate as a new method in constipated patients with normal radiographic and colonoscopic evaluations. Patients and methods: thirteen patients with idiopathic constipation underwent colon transit scintigraphy. After oral administration of 6-7 MBq Ga-citrates, serial abdominal images were taken up to 72 hours. Pattern classification wa s performed visually according to the distribution of radioactivity, Scintigraphic parameters such as geometric mean center of seq mental retention of tracer, as well as mean ac activity profiles and colonic tracer half-clearance time were calculated Results: Three patterns of colonic transit scintigraphy were recognized. Nine patients had the normal pattern, i.e. excellent propagation of ac activity. Three patients had the colonic inertia pattern with marked retention of activity in the transverse colon and splenic flexure at 48 hours, One patient had significant retention of activity in the recto sigmoid at 72 hours, defined as functional recto sigmoid obstruction . No significant difference was seen in GMC24h between the normal pattern and colonic inertia (P4.053), but GMC48h and GMC72h markedly differed between the two groups (P50.0 16 and 0.025 respectively). 'The mean half clearance time of the two groups was di different (P4.017). Our results are well compatible with scintigraphic diagnostic criteria in different patterns of colonic transit defined by other studies with different radiotracer. Conclusion: oral 67 Ga -citrate colon transit scintigraphy is a feasible method to evaluate idiopathic constipation and seems to be a suitable surrogate for radio-opaque markers.

Although various modes of cleansing the colon prior to scintigraphy have been suggested, there is controversy over their efficacy and none have been tested prospectively. Three hundred nine patients undergoing gallium-67 scintigraphy were randomly assigned to one of four cleansing regimens: (1) a high fiber diet (78 patients); (2) castor oil (76); (3) milk of magnesia and cascara (76); and (4) no preparation (79). Patient compliance rates for the four regimens were 17%, 32%, 36%, and 46%, respectively. After noncompliant patients were excluded, gallium-67 scintigrams were graded for colonic activity on a scale of 0-3 by three independent, experienced observers. Gallium-67 activity in the colon was significantly less after adminstration of castor oil than after no prepartion (p = 0.083). Regimen 3 did not produce significantly better results than regimen 4 (p = 0.42). A major impediment to the success of any cleansing regimen seems to be poor compliance of patients\n\nGallium67 scintigraphy in fibrinous pericarditis associated with bacterial endocarditis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMartin, P.; Verhas, M.; Devriendt, J.; Goffin, Y.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nAn 80-year-old man presented with pyrexia, progressive cardiac failure and inflammation.

(Japan). Faculty of Medicine)\n\n1994-05-01\n\nTechnetium-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy was performed in 76 patients with pathologically confirmed soft tissue diseases. In 56 patients, gallium-67 citrate scintigraphy was performed within two weeks after technetium-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy. Significant uptake of technetium-99m (V) DMSA was found in all cases of sarcoma, metastatic carcinoma, progressive benignancy (extra-abdominal desmoid etc.) and granulomatous lesions, but was not found in cases of benign, solid tumors in the soft tissue (leiomyoma, neurinoma, lipoma etc.). In conclusion, it is not necessary to treat patients with soft tissue tumors in which technetium-99m (V) DMSA did not accumulate. Therefore, it can be stated that technetium-99m (V) DMSA scintigraphy is useful for the screening of malignant tumors.

These cases showed abnormal pulmonary 67 Ga uptake with normal chest radiographs. The first case with malignant lymphoma and the second one with lung cancer suffered from pulmonary infection following secondary immuno-insufficiency due to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Pneumocystis carinii was suspected as causative agent in the first case, and gram negative bacilli in the second case. The third case with lung cancer developed radiation pneumonia after radiotherapy. The fourth case with acute bronchitis developed drug induced interstitial pneumonia presumably due to minocycline administration. It is concluded that 67 Ga-citrate scintigraphy is more sensitive for early detection of interstitial pneumonia than routine chest radiography.

Jr.; Rom, W.N.; Taylor, A.T. Jr.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nTwenty-two underground coal workers with 27 or more years of coal dust exposure were studied with gallium-67 citrate (Ga-67) imaging. Radiographic evidence of coal workers indicates that pneumoconiosis (CWP) was present in 12 subjects. The Ga-67 scan was abnormal in 11 of 12 with, and 9 of 10 without, CWP. The Ga-67 uptake index was significantly correlated with total dust exposure (p less than 0.01) and approached significant correlation with the radiographic profusion of the nodules (0.10 greater than p greater than 0.05). There was no correlation between Ga-67 uptake and spirometric function, which was normal in this group of patients; furthermore, increased lung uptake of gallium did not indicate a poor prognosis in subjects no longer exposed to coal dust. While coal dust exposure may be associated with positive Ga-67 lung scan in coal miners with many years of coal dust exposure, the scan provided no information not already available from a careful exposure history and a chest radiograph. Since Ga-67 scanning is a relatively expensive procedure the authors would recommend that its use in subjects with asymptomatic CWP be limited to an investigative role and not be made part of a routine evaluation\n\nNoninvasive staging of lung cancer. Indications and limitations of gallium-67 citrate imaging\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBekerman, C.; Caride, V.J.; Hoffer, P.B.; Boles, C.A.\n\n1990-01-01\n\nThe results of evaluation of the hila and mediastinum with 67Ga scans are contradictory, as are the recommendations by different investigators on the use of 67Ga scintigraphy in the clinical evaluation of patients with primary lung carcinoma. Nevertheless, the economy and logistic simplicity of evaluating local and distant metastases with a single imaging procedure are attractive, especially because the symptoms may not enable the physician to make a correct identification of the organ systems affected by metastases. Neumann and Hoffer state that at present conventional Ga-67 scanning techniques cannot be recommended for preoperative staging of mediastinal lymph node metastases in lung cancer patients. According to Waxman, 67Ga scintigraphy, relative to other imaging modalities, is a sensitive indicator of hilar spread of a tumor. However, because of the normally high background activity within the sternum and spine, mediastinal abnormalities may be poorly detected. Since most pulmonary tumors metastasize via regional nodes to the pulmonary hilum and then to the mediastinum, the high sensitivity for the detection of pulmonary hilar abnormalities and the high specificity for detection of mediastinal lesions suggest that gallium scintigraphy is a valuable adjunctive test when used appropriately. The results obtained locally are probably the best guide for individual physicians in the selection of diagnostic tests for their patients. Gallium scans may thus be helpful in the clinical evaluation of patients with lung cancer. Although gallium scans identify mediastinal node involvement, there is considerable controversy over the relationship between the sensitivity and specificity of the method. By detecting distant extrathoracic metastases, the 67Ga scan may identify a small group of patients who can be spared a needless operation. 92 references\n\nComparison of thallium-201 and gallium-67 scintigraphy in soft tissue and bone marrow multiple myeloma: a case report\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRoach, P.J.; Arthur, C.K.\n\n1997-01-01\n\nA 68 year old female was referred for assessment of multiple myeloma. A large myelomatous infiltrate involving the left triceps muscle showed avid uptake on both thallium-201 and gallium-67 scintigraphy. Following radiotherapy, imaging with both radiopharmaceuticals showed resolution of disease; however, tumour recurrence in the bone marrow was seen only on thallium-201 imaging. This observation suggests that while soft-tissue myleoma shows similar appearances on thallium-201 and gallium-67 scintigraphy, both at baseline and following therapy, gallium-67 may not demonstrate bone marrow infiltration which is visualized on thallium-201 imaging. Therefore, thallium-201 appears to be superior to gallium-67 in evaluation of patients with multiple myeloma when soft tissues and bone marrow are involved. 17 refs., 3 figs\n\nFollow-up of rheumatic carditis using 67Ga-citrate imaging\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCalegaro, J.U.M.; Bae, S.H.; Prado, E.S.; Gomes, E.F.\n\n2002-01-01\n\nAim: This study reports the follow -up of 25 patients (pts) with rheumatic carditis (9 male, 16 females; 4-29 years, mean 12,12) using 67-gallium citrate. Materials and Methods: the pts were divided in 2 groups: I- first attack (7pts, 2 males, with a mean follow-up of 5,65 years); II- recurrence (18 pts, 7 males, with a mean follow-up of 5,27 years).Images of the thorax and semi quantitative indexes were obtained 72 hours after intravenous injection of 37-74 MBq (1-2 mCi) of 67-gallium citrate, using a LFOV scintillation camera. 67-gallium uptake in the cardiac area was graded as mild, moderate or severe using the tracer uptake in the lung as a reference (normal up to 130%). Results: all pts in group I (2 severe, 2 moderate, and 3 mild carditis) had normal gallium uptake in up to 9 weeks after the institution of cortico therapy, with a better outcome in follow-up.In group II, 8 pts presented moderately active carditis (2 had good and 6 had a poor outcome) and 10 mildly active carditis (7 had good and 3 had poor outcome). The evolution of the disease was better in 8 pts that the reduction of 67- gallium uptake to normal limits occurred in up to 9 weeks, than in 9 pts that the scintigraphy was only normal after 10 weeks of therapy. Conclusion: normal gallium uptake in up to 9 weeks of treatment seems to be a good predictor of evolution in rheumatic carditis first attack or recurrence; in recurrence, reduction of 67-gallium uptake only after 10 weeks or increasing uptake seems to be worse predictors\n\nDiagnosis of mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysm using 67-gallium citrate\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBlumoff, R.L.; McCartney, W.; Jaques, P.; Johnson, G. Jr.\n\n1982-01-01\n\nMycotic aneurysms of the abdominal aorta are uncommon, but potentially lethal problems. Clinical subtleties may suggest their presence, but in the past, definitive diagnosis has been dependent on surgical exploration or autopsy findings. A case is presented in which 67-gallium citrate abdominal scanning localized the site of sepsis in an abdominal aortic aneurysm and allowed for prompt and successful surgical therapy. This noninvasive technique is recommended as a adjunct in the diagnosis of mycotic abdominal aortic aneurysms\n\nImportance of gallium-67 scintigraphy in primary cutaneous B-cell lymphoma: report of two cases\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nAttab, Cyomara Sanches; Moriguchi, Sonia Marta; Rocha, Euclides Timoteo da\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe authors describe two cases of cutaneous B-cell lymphoma where correct staging, treatment and follow-up could be achieved through a combination of conventional imaging studies and gallium-67 scintigraphy.

However, the accumulations of Gallium-67 in the normal pulmonary hilum are found in some cases. So, 277 cases with Gallium-67 scintigraphy were discussed. The hilar accumulation of Gallium-67 was classified into four grades, namely Grade 0: no Gallium-67 uptake, Grade I: low Gallium-67 uptake, Grade II: moderate Gallium-67 uptake, and Grade III: high Gallium-67 uptake. Gallium-67 uptake was found in 38 of 277 cases (14%). Thirty cases of these were estimated as Grade I (79%). Cases with Grade II were 20.3%, and only two cases were Grade III (0.7%). Gallium-67 accumulation, was bilateral in 28 cases out of 38 and cases with Gallium-67 accumulation increased with age. Twenty five of the 38 cases with Gallium-67 accumulation had such findings as suggesting old pulmonary inflammation though they had no symptoms of respiratory diseases. This study suggests that hilar Gallium-67 accumulation has no correlation with the active inflammation of the lymphnodes.

It is important to know the normal pattern of gallium uptake at surgical incision sites in order to properly interpret the gallium scan when investigating possible wound infection in patients who have undergone abdominal surgery. We studied 42 patients without wound infection after colorectal surgery and performed gallium scans within 40 days after surgery. Patients were divided into three groups according to the interval between the operation and the scan. In group A (26 patients) gallium scan was performed within 7 days after surgery, in group B (8 patients) between 8 and 14 days after surgery, and in group C (8 patients) between 15 and 40 days after surgery. Our data showed that in group A, 61.5% had gallium accumulation at the surgical incision site. In group B, 50% had accumulation of gallium at the surgical incision site, while in group C only one patient (12.5%) showed gallium uptake. It is concluded that the incidence of increased gallium uptake at clean surgical incision sites is high after colorectal surgery. Nuclear medicine physicians should bear in mind the high incidence of non-specific gallium uptake at such sites during the interpretation of possible wound infection in patients after colorectal surgery.

Fifty-five patients with previously untreated oral cancer were administered in this study. The diagnostic accuracy of 67 Ga scintigraphy for primary cancer, cervical lymph node metastasis, systemic metastasis or double cancer were studied. The relations of the size of lesions to the diagnostic accuracy, and the degree of 67 Ga-citrate accumulation were analyzed. In addition, we discussed what makes it difficult to diagnose the lesions by using 67 Ga scintigrams. As a result, the sensitivity was 44.2% in primary cancer, 28.6% in cervical lymph node metastasis, and 25.0% in systemic metastasis or double cancer. It was suggested that 67 Ga scintigraphy is disadvantageous for the detection of small lesions. In this study, the relation between the size of lesions and the degree of 67 Ga-citrate accumulation was not clarified. The diagnostic problems of 67 Ga scintigraphy were found to be its low reliability in imaging of the lesion's localization, normal biodistribution and non-specific accumulation of 67 Ga-citrate.

In 23 patients with radiation pneumonitis detected radiographically, abnormal 67 Ga uptake in sites other than tumors was found in all post-RT 67 Ga lung images. Three patterns of uptake were found: (A) focal uptake corresponding to the RT field (n=10); (B) diffuse uptake including the RT field (n=4); and (C) diffuse uptake outside the RT field (n=9). The area of 67 Ga uptake was consistent with that of interstitial pneumonitis as revealed histopathologically in 7 cases. 67 Ga uptake in pattern (C) was an indicator of poor prognosis for the patients with radiation pneumonitis. 67 Ga uptake in the patients with reversible pneumonitis disappeared with steroid therapy. Sixteen (20%) of 80 asymptomatic patients, in whose chest radiographs there was no finding of radiation pneumonitis, showed transient 67 Ga uptake. These were considered to occur in the subclinical radiation pneumonitis. These data suggest that 67 Ga imaging is more sensitive than chest radiography in the detection of radiation pneumonitis and is useful in the assessment of the extent and clinical course of radiation pneumonitis.

Currently gallium nitrate is undergoing Phase I clinical studies. A million fold increase in the concentration of the carrier gallium citrate over the range of carrier-free gallium-67 (pgm) to 1.0 Î¼g caused no significant alteration in the disposition of gallium-67 in rats.Gallium-67 was eliminated from blood with a biological t1/2 of 4.1 days. A linear tissue binding profile was observed for gallium-67 over this concentration range. A multi-compartment pharmacokinetic model was developed in which all the tissues studied were treated as separate compartments. At 1.0 mg dose level, significant alteration in the disposition of gallium-67 was observed in rats, > 95% of the initial radioactivity was characteristic reappearance of the radioactivity in the blood approximately 4 hours after dosing leading to a ''hump'' in the blood concentration-time profiles. Following the 1.0 mg dose low tissue levels were observed, except for the kidneys, which contained about 8% of the administered dose per gram of the tissue one-half hour after dosing. A non-linear tissue binding profile was observed to be associated with gallium at high doses. It was hypothesized that the rapid loss of gallium-67 from the vascular system following the high doses of gallium citrate was due to the accumulation of the drug in the kidneys where it was eventually eliminated via urine. The kidneys thus would act as a temporary storage site for gallium. It was concluded that the dose-related renal toxicity associated with gallium therapy may be attributed to the kidney's role as a temporary storage site following high doses\n\nWhole-body /sup 67/Ga scintigraphy in dermatomyositis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nHiraki, Yoshio; Okazaki, Yoshio; Murakami, Kiminori; Inoue, Nobuhiro; Noriyasu, Toshiaki; Takeda, Yoshihiro; Morimoto, Setsuo; Aono, Kaname\n\n1987-10-01\n\nThe presence or absence of abnormal accumulation of gallium-67 in soft tissues was studied in 11 patients undergoing /sup 67/Ga scintigraphy out of 25 patients with dermatomyositis and polymyositis (DM-PM) who had visited our hospital during the period between July 1981 and March 1987 and met the diagnostic criteria of muscle biopsy, etc. A definite image of abnormal accumulation was obtained by /sup 67/Ga scintigraphy in 3 of the patients. Although the positive site tended to be in agreement with the site of muscular symptoms in the DM-PM active stage, the accumulation was not necessarily correlated with the variations in creatine phosphokinase. From these results, it seems necessary to keep in mind the possibility that gallium-67 may also accumulate abnormally in the soft tissue lesion owing to the pathogenic process specific to DM-PM when /sup 67/Ga scintigraphy is undertaken for the purpose of screening, etc., for complication by a malignant tumor in DM-PM patients\n\nSemi-quantitative evaluation of gallium-67 scintigraphy in lupus nephritis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLin Wanyu; Hsieh Jihfang; Tsai Shihchuan; Lan Joungliang; Cheng Kaiyuan; Wang Shyhjen\n\n2000-01-01\n\nWithin nuclear medicine there is a trend towards quantitative analysis. Gallium renal scan has been reported to be useful in monitoring the disease activity of lupus nephritis. However, only visual interpretation using a four-grade scale has been performed in previous studies, and this method is not sensitive enough for follow-up. In this study, we developed a semi-quantitative method for gallium renal scintigraphy to find a potential parameter for the evaluation of lupus nephritis. Forty-eight patients with lupus nephritis underwent renal biopsy to determine World Health Organization classification, activity index (AI) and chronicity index (CI). A delayed 48-h gallium scan was also performed and interpreted by visual and semi-quantitative methods. For semi-quantitative analysis of the gallium uptake in both kidneys, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn over both kidneys, the right forearm and the adjacent spine. The uptake ratios between these ROIs were calculated and expressed as the ''kidney/spine ratio (K/S ratio)'' or the ''kidney/arm ratio (K/A ratio)''. Spearman's rank correlation test and Mann-Whitney U test were used for statistical analysis. Our data showed a good correlation between the semi-quantitative gallium scan and the results of visual interpretation. K/S ratios showed a better correlation with AI than did K/A ratios. Furthermore, the left K/S ratio displayed a better correlation with AI than did the right K/S ratio. In contrast, CI did not correlate well with the results of semi-quantitative gallium scan. In conclusion, semi-quantitative gallium renal scan is easy to perform and shows a good correlation with the results of visual interpretation and renal biopsy. The left K/S ratio from semi-quantitative renal gallium scintigraphy displays the best correlation with AI and is a useful parameter in evaluating the disease activity in lupus nephritis.

Fifty-six patients were studied. For all patients a bone scan using 99mTc-MDP was indicated. The patients were randomized allocated for 67Ga (Group 1 - 22 patients) or simultaneous administration 99mTc-labelled leucocytes and 111In-IgG.(Group 2 - 34 patients) study. For the groups 1 and 2 were confirmed respectively 12/26 y 11/34 septic lesions. The 67Ga scintigraphy showed 6 true-positive, 9 true-negative, 5 false-positive and 6 false-negative. With 99mTc-WBC, the respective values were 8, 18, 5 and 3. With 111In-IgG, the figures were 7, 17, 6 and 4, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 50%, 64,3% and 57,7% respectively for the 67Ga, 72,7%, 78,2% and 76,4% respectively for 99mTc-WBC and 63,6%, 73,9% and 70,6% respectively for 111In-IgG. In this study, the labelled leucocytes scintigraphy showed more accurate than 67Ga and 111In-IgG scans for the diagnosis of bone and joint infections. However, the obtained results were less reliable for the diagnosis of occult sepsis in the patients with joint prosthesis (Au)\n\nGallium-67 and subphrenic abscesses: is delayed scintigraphy necessary\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHopkins, G.B.; Mende, C.W.\n\n1975-01-01\n\nForty postoperative patients with clinical and roentgenographic findings suggestive of subphrenic abscess were evaluated by early and delayed 67 Ga scintigraphy. Early 67 Ga scintigraphs obtained 6 hr after injection correctly localized seven right and five left subphrenic abscesses. In no instance was an abscess present on delayed scintigraphs that was not evident on the 6-hr study. Two patients with left subphrenic abscess had false-negative results on both early and delayed scintigraphy. No false-positive studies were recorded. Early 67 Ga scintigraphy can be a valuable noninvasive adjunct in the diagnosis of subphrenic abscess.

Osteomyelitis was suggested by an increasing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive 99m Tc MDP scintigraphy. The patients were submitted to clinical treatment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 67-gallium citrate scans were used in the follow-up of the therapy. Three patients had negative gallium after three weeks of organism-specific antibiotic therapy; in two patients the gallium scintigraphy remained positive. One patient did not undergo the radionuclide scan for this clinical conditions. These results suggest that MDP scans showed higher sensitivity and specificity in detection of bone disease in chronic sinusitis. Gallium scans appeared to be valuable tool in the follow-up of the infection. There are no reports in the literature of osteomyelitis as a complication of chronic sinusitis in AIDS patient.

They were, however, claimed to be nonspecific. Quantitative Tc 99m methylene diphosphonate bone scintigraphy and gallium 67 scintigraphy were performed in eight patients with NEO and in 20 patients with severe external otitis, in order to prove usefulness of scintigraphy in the diagnosis of NEO. Ratios of lesion to nonlesion for bone scintigraphy were 1.67 Â± 0.16 in patients with NEO and 1.08 Â± 0.09 in patients with severe external otitis, and for gallium 67 scintigraphy they were 1.35 Â± 0.24 in NEO patients and 1.05 Â± 0.03 in patients with severe external otitis. There was no difference in uptake between diabetic patients with severe external otitis and nondiabetic patients. The scintigraphic studies were also evaluated using a qualitative scoring method (scores 0 to +4), according to the intensity of the radiopharmaceutical uptake. This method was found to be inferior in the diagnosis of NEO compared with the quantitative method. We conclude that lesion-to-nonlesion ratios greater than 1.5 and 1.3 on bone and gallium 67 scintigraphy, respectively, are indicative of NEO. Quantitative bone scintigraphy, which is quicker to perform, may be used as a single imaging modality for the diagnosis of NEO\n\nRole of Gallium and labeled leukocyte scintigraphy in AIDS patient\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nPalestro, C.J.; Goldsmith, S.J.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nBecause AIDS patients frequently present with minimal symptomatology, radionuclide imaging with its ability to survey the entire body, is especially valuable. Gallium-67 citrate, the most commonly performed radionuclide study for localizing infection in these patients, is most useful for detecting opportunistic infections, especially in the thorax. A negative gallium scan, particularly when the chest X-ray is unremarkable, rules strongly against pulmonary disease. A negative gallium scan in a patient with an abnormal chest X-ray and Kaposi's sarcoma, suggests that the patient's respiratory distress is related to the neoplasm. Diffuse pulmonary parenchymal uptake of gallium in the HIV (+) patient is most often associated with PCP. While there are other causes of diffuse pulmonary uptake, the more intense or heterogeneous the uptake, the more likely the patient is to have PCP. Focal pulmonary uptake is usually associated with bacterial pneumonia although PCP may occasionally present in this fashion. Lymph node uptake of gallium is usually associated with Mycob acterium avium complex, tuberculosis, or Iymphoma. When corresponding abnormalities are present on thallium scintigraphy lymphoma is likely. Gallium positive, thallium negative, studies suggest mycobacterial disease. Labeled leukocyte imaging is not useful for detecting opportunistic infections probably because of the inflammatory response incited by these organisms. Leukocyte imaging is, however, more sensitive for detecting bacterial pneumonia. In the abdomen, gallium imaging is most useful for identifying lymphadenopathy, while labeled leukocyte imaging is superior for detecting AlDS-associated colitides. In summary, radionuclide studies are valuable diagnostic modalities in AIDS. Their success can be maximized by tailoring the study to the individual's needs\n\nGallium-67 uptake by the thyroid associated with progressive systemic sclerosis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nSjoberg, R.J.; Blue, P.W.; Kidd, G.S.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAlthough thyroidal uptake of gallium-67 has been described in several thyroid disorders, gallium-67 scanning is not commonly used in the evaluation of thyroid disease. Thyroidal gallium-67 uptake has been reported to occur frequently with subacute thyroiditis, anaplastic thyroid carcinoma, and thyroid lymphoma, and occasionally with Hashimoto's thyroiditis and follicular thyroid carcinoma. A patient is described with progressive systemic sclerosis who, while being scanned for possible active pulmonary involvement, was found incidentally to have abnormal gallium-67 uptake only in the thyroid gland. Fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid revealed Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Although Hashimoto's thyroiditis occurs with increased frequency in patients with progressive systemic sclerosis, thyroidal uptake of gallium-67 associated with progressive systemic sclerosis has not, to our knowledge, been previously described. Since aggressive thyroid malignancies frequently are imaged by gallium-67 scintigraphy, fine needle aspiration cytology of the thyroid often is essential in the evaluation of thyroidal gallium-67 uptake\n\nGallium-67 uptake by the thyroid associated with progressive systemic sclerosis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nSjoberg, R.J.; Blue, P.W.; Kidd, G.S.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nAlthough thyroidal uptake of gallium-67 has been described in several thyroid disorders, gallium-67 scanning is not commonly used in the evaluation of thyroid disease.

In order to prove association of gallium accumulation with myocarditis an independent experiment was carried out in which DXR-induced rabbits were subjected to gallium scintigraphy on 10th, 20th and 30th day post-DXR administration and sacrificed immediately thereafter. On autopsy, the heart was removed for gallium count in gamma counter and tissues were collected for histopathology. Results and Discussion: 67Ga disposition studies in healthy rabbits revealed that after 48 hours post-administration the heart to liver ratio was less than 1 suggesting no residue gallium in heart tissues at this point in time. Results of the static scintigraphy in these rabbits revealed that total count and average count heart to liver ratio declined gradually from 12 hrs (1.36 Â± 0.16; 1.35 Â± 0.16) to 48 hrs (0.73 Â± 0.11; 0.74 Â± 0.10). We therefore concluded that analysis of total count and average count heart to liver ratio at 48 hrs anterior chest image would provide credible evidence of 67Ga accumulation in heart tissue. In order to study 67Ga citrate uptake in DXR-induced cardio toxicity the second experiment was conducted wherein DXR 1 mg / kg body weight was injected in rabbit (n = 7) through marginal ear vein on every 5th day (total 21 doses maximum). 67Ga 100 Î¼Ci per kg body was injected intravenously after every 10 days. After computing various indices of uptake it was evident that during cumulative dosing of DXR there was significant increased accumulation of 67Ga in heart starting from 10th (2 mg /kg) to 30th (7 mg / kg), whereas after 40th (9 mg /kg) until 90 days (19 mg/kg) gallium uptake was found to be reduced. During the study all the rabbits died at various time intervals. Evidence of radioactive counts in isolated heart indicated that gallium was indeed accumulated in heart of rabbits administered DXR. Histopathology confirmed grade III myocarditis. Thus, with scintigraphy, myocarditis could be diagnosed\n\nMyositis ossificans with Ga-67 citrate positivity\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMoreno, A.J.; Yedinak, M.A.; Spicer, M.J.; Turnbull, G.L.; Byrd, B.F.; Brown, T.J.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA 16 year-old boy presented with a firm mass within the left thigh. Ga-67 citrate and bone scintigraphy revealed soft tissue radiotracer accumulation within the mass lesion.

Clinical examination, plain film radiographs and 99 Tcsup(m)-methylene diphosphonate bone scans failed to differentiate between infection and mechanical loosening of a prosthesis. Sequential use of 99 Tcsup(m)-methylene diphosphonate and 67 Ga-citrate bone scans were performed in an attempt to discover underlying infectious process. Increased focal uptake of both radiopharmaceuticals over the same hip indicated an infectious process responsible for prosthetic loosening. There were no false positive gallium examinations. Sequential use of 99 Tcsup(m)-phosphate compounds and 67 Ga-citrate is recommended for differentiation between mechanical loosening of a prosthesis and loosening of a prosthesis secondary to an infectious process.

Of the two main groups one consisted of 69 subjects without ophthalmic complaints (control group), the other consisted of 26 patients with KCS of Sjoegren's syndome. Of the 26 patients with KCS, 7 has been diagnosed as probable KCS (probable sub-group) and the other 19 had been diagnosed definite KCS (definite sub-group). About 3 mCi (111 MBq) 67 Ga-citrate was injected IV into each subject and this was followed by scintigraphy at 24, 48, and 72 h after the injection of 67 Ga. A positive finding in the lacrimal gland was noted in 64 of 69 subjects (92.7%) in the control group and in 7 of 7 patients (100%) with probable KCS. Three of 19 patients with definite KCS (15.7%) showed positive findings under scintigraphy. When the scintigraphic finding in the lacrimal gland is not positive in patients with suspected KCS of Sjoegren's syndrome, they can then be diagnosed with little risk as definite KCS cases. Shirmer's test was performed on subjects in the probable and definite groups. There was statistical significance between the positive and equivocal or negative scintigraphic finding and Schirmer's values. These results suggest a correlation between gallium accumulation in the lacrimal gland and the tear production.

In this method the Tc-99m image was subtracted from the Ga-67 image. After normalizing both images, 4 different factors (0.6, 0.8, 1.0, and 1.2) were applied to the Tc-99m image before the subtraction. Finally, 4 subtraction images with different contrasts were obtained in one X-ray film. This method was found to be very useful in the assessment of intrahepatic focal accumulation of Ga-67, especially in cases with hepatoma, because it eliminated the uncertainty in the former method in which only visual judgment was done\n\nFacial osteomyelitis as complication of chronic sinusitis in hemophiliac-AIDS patients - scintigraphic evaluation with technetium-99m-MDP and Gallium-67; Osteomielitis da face como complicacao de sinusite cronica em hemofilicos aideticos - avaliacao cintilografica com {sup 99m} Tc-MDP e {sup 67} Ga\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nMarques, Marise da Penha Costa [Universidade Federal, Rio de Janeiro, RJ (Brazil).

Osteomyelitis was suggested by an increasing of erythrocyte sedimentation rate. The diagnosis was confirmed by a positive {sup 99m} Tc MDP scintigraphy. The patients were submitted to clinical treatment. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate and 67-gallium citrate scans were used in the follow-up of the therapy. Three patients had negative gallium after three weeks of organism-specific antibiotic therapy; in two patients the gallium scintigraphy remained positive. One patient did not undergo the radionuclide scan for this clinical conditions. These results suggest that MDP scans showed higher sensitivity and specificity in detection of bone disease in chronic sinusitis. Gallium scans appeared to be valuable tool in the follow-up of the infection. There are no reports in the literature of osteomyelitis as a complication of chronic sinusitis in AIDS patient.

Faculty of Medicine; Murakami, J\n\n1981-02-01\n\nsup(99m)Tc-phytate and /sup 67/Ga-citrate scintigraphies were evaluated clinically in 50 cases of histologically proven hepatocellular carcinoma. Detectability was higher in sup(99m)Tc-phytate scans than in /sup 67/Ga scans, and was influenced by the presence of liver cirrhosis. However, by using both scans, the highest detectability was obtained. /sup 67/Ga scan was useful especially in cases with equivocal sup(99m)Tc-phytate scintigraphy and cases with liver cirrhosis. There was no definite correlation seen between Edmondson's histological gradings and grades of /sup 67/Ga accumulation. No significant difference of /sup 67/Ga accumulation in hepatocellular carcinoma was observed regardless of the presence of liver cirrhosis. We conclude that it is better to use sup(99m)Tc-phytate as the first choice in screening of hepatocellular carcinoma and subsequent /sup 67/Ga scan if indicated.\n\nFast and simple preparation of 68Ga-citrate for routine clinical PET\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nNielsen, Karin M; Kaufmann, Jens; Mewis, Dennis\n\n2013-01-01\n\nThe imaging of infectious and inflammatory diseases using gallium-67 (â¶â·Ga) citrate scintigraphy has been a well-established diagnostic tool for decades.

The following results were obtained: 28 patients of group 1 have had a SG67 prior and after chemo- and radio-therapy. In the initial account does patients had a positive SG67 (evidencing 6 localizations of the unknown disease) after chemotherapy all of them presented residual masses by TDM. 18/28 had positive SG67 witnessing an incomplete remission (ICR). After radiotherapy, 1 patient had un-interpretable scintigraphy while the other 17 had negative SG67 with a persistence of TDM anomalies, witnessing the absence of active disease. Four patients presented a clinical and scintigraphic recurrence, 10 presented a negative scintigraphy following the chemotherapy and 3 presented a distant recurrence confirmed by the scintigraphy at a more early stage than by TDM. Eight patients of the group 2 had a SG67 after chemotherapy with an abnormal TDM and after radio-therapy. After chemotherapy 8/8 have had a positive SG67 witnessing a ICR, 7 presented a normal scintigraphy after radiotherapy (6 of them were in evolutive development or in remission and 1 evidenced recurrence at 4 months) and 1 in ICR after radiotherapy was subject to an auto-graft. In conclusion, the SG67 appears to be useful to the clinician after chemotherapy and radiotherapy in order to detect the presence of an active residual disease when anomalies on TDM are still persisting as well as in an evolutive development to confirm an early recurrence prior to the TDM. It is, worth to insist upon the realisation of a SG67 before treatment serving as a reference examination, occasionally supplementing the initial extension account\n\nUse of 67Ga citrate in the diagnosis of lung cancer\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nBogdasarov, Yu.B.; Zajtseva, T.I.; Gabuniya, R.I.; Abramov, V.F.\n\n1981-01-01\n\nA study was of the potentialities of 67 Ga citrate in the diagnosis of lung cancer, in differentiation from benign tumors and chronic inflammatory processes of the lungs. A total of 101 lung cancer patients were examined, of them 64 with central, and 37 with peripheral cancer. The results of radionuclide studies were correlated with those of surgery and with morphological findings. It has been established that in central cancer scintigraphy with 67 Ga citrate gives positive results in 87% of cases, and in peripheral cancer in 89%. This method is of great value for the diagnosis of cancer metastases to the mediastinal lymph nodes. No correlation between the intensity of 67 Ga citrate accumulation in lung tumors and their histological structure has been revealed [ru\n\nDirect separation of 67Ga citrate from zinc and copper target materials by an ion exchange\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nEl-Azony, K.M.; Ferieg, Kh.; Saleh, Z.A.\n\n2004-01-01\n\nThe separation of 6 7G a from zinc and copper target materials using an anion- f:exchanger (Dowex21K) and 0.1 M citrate buffer at pH 6 is described. The gallium-67 was separated in citrate solution and can be directly used for medical applications. Gallium-67 with a half-life of 78.3 h and gamma-rays with energies of 93, 185 and 300 keV is a cyclotron produced radioisotope for which a considerable demand exists. 6 7G a is frequently produced through proton or deuteron bombardment of natural or enriched Zn targets (Helus and Maier-Borst, 1973). It is usually separated from Zn by ion exchange chromatography (Helus and Maier-Borst, 1973; van der Walt and Strelow, 1983) or by liquid extraction Helus and Maier-Borst, 1973; Hupf and Beaver, 1970). The isotope is usually supplied in citrate solution which is widely used as 6 7G a Gallium citrate which is a well-established radiopharmaceutical for imaging soft tissue tumors and abscesses. Several routes for large scale production of 6 7G a and the development of medical applications have been reported (Silvester and Thakur, 1970; Dahl and Tilbury, 1972; Steyn and Meyer,1973; Vlatkovic et al., 1975; Neirinckx, 1976; Thakur, 1977). Various attempts were carried out to separate gallium-67 by using different ion exchange methods (Strelow et al., 1971; Das and Ramamoorthy, 1995; Boothe et al.,1991) through the labelling of citrate by using 6 7G a was carried out for medical applications\n\nGallium-67 citrate scan in extrapulmonary tuberculosis\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nLin Wanyu [Taichung Veterans General Hospital (Taiwan). Dept. of Nuclear Medicine; Hsieh Jihfang [Chi-Mei Foundation Hospital, Tainan (Taiwan)\n\n1999-07-01\n\nAim: Whole-body gallium scan was performed to evaluate the usefulness of gallium scan for detecting extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB) lesions. Methods: Thirty-seven patients with extrapulmonary TB were included in this study. Four patients were found to have two lesions. Totally, 41 lesions were identified, including 19 TB arthritis, 8 spinal TB, 5 TB meningitis, 3 TB lymphadenopathy, 2 TB pericarditis, 1 TB peritonitis, 1 intestinal TB, 1 skin TB and 1 renal TB. Results: Of the 41 extrapulmonary TB lesions, gallium scan detected 32 lesions with a sensitivity of 78%. All the patients with TB meningitis showed negative gallium scan. When the five cases of TB meningitis were excluded, the detection sensitivity of gallium scan increased to 88.9% (32/36). Conclusion: Our data revealed that gallium scan is a convenient and useful method for evaluating extrapulmonary TB lesions other than TB-meningitis. We suggest that gallium scan be included in the clinical routine for patients with suspected extrapulmonary TB. (orig.) [German] Ziel: Es wurden Ganzkoerper-Gallium-Szintigramme angefertigt, um den Nutzen der Gallium-Szintigraphie zur Erfassung von extrapulmonalen Tuberkuloseherden (TB) zu erfassen. Methoden: 37 Patienten mit extrapulmonaler TB wurden eingeschlossen. 4 Patienten hatten 2 Laesionen. Insgesamt wurden 41 Laesionen identifiziert, hierunter 19 TB-Arthritis, 8 spinale TB, 5 TB-Meningitis, 3 TB-Lymphadenopathie, 2 TB-Perikarditis, 1 TB-Peritonitis, 1 intestinale TB, 1 Haut-TB und eine Nieren-TB. Ergebnisse: Von den 41 extrapulmonalen TB-Herden erfasste die Gallium-Szintigraphie 32 Herde mit einer Sensitivitaet von 78%. Alle Patienten mit TB-Meningitis zeigten einen negativen Gallium-Scan. Wenn die 5 Faelle mit TB-Meningitis ausgeschlossen wurden, stieg die Sensitivititaet der Gallium-Szintigraphie auf 88,9% (32/36). Schlussfolgerung: Die Daten zeigen, dass die Gallium-Szintigraphie eine einfache und nuetzliche Methode zur Erfassung extrapulmonaler TB-Herde ist\n\n111In-DOTA-dPhe1-Tyr3-octreotide, 111In-DOTA-lanreotide and 67Ga citrate scintigraphy for visualisation of extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphoma of the MALT type: a comparative study\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLi, Shuren; Kurtaran, Amir; Li, Mei; Traub-Weidinger, Tatjana; Kienast, Oskar; Schima, Wolfgang; Angelberger, Peter; Virgolini, Irene; Raderer, Markus; Dudczak, Robert\n\n2003-01-01\n\nSomatostatin receptor (SSTR) scintigraphy and gallium-67 citrate ( 67 Ga) scintigraphy have been used for visualisation of Hodgkin's lymphoma and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, experience with B-cell lymphoma of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type is very limited. The aim of this study was to prospectively compare the 67 Ga scintigraphy results with those obtained by 111 In-DOTA-dPhe 1 -Tyr 3 -octreotide ( 111 In-DOTA-TOCT) and 111 In-DOTA-lanreotide ( 111 In-DOTA-LAN) scintigraphy in patients with proven MALT-type lymphoma. Comparative scintigraphic examinations using 67 Ga, 111 In-DOTA-TOCT and 111 In-DOTA-LAN were performed in 18 patients (11 female and 7 male, median age 64Â±15 years) with histologically verified MALT-type lymphomas of various origin. Planar and single-photon emission tomography imaging acquisitions were performed after injection of a mean dose of 185Â±26 MBq 67 Ga and 165Â±20 MBq 111 In-DOTA-TOCT or 111 In-DOTA-LAN. All scintigraphic results were correlated with other conventional examinations including gastroscopy, colonoscopy, endosonoscopy, ophthalmologic investigation, CT of the thorax and abdomen and bone marrow biopsy. This comparative study showed that 67 Ga scintigraphy found abnormalities in 10 of 16 patients (63%) and detected 18 of 31 clinically involved sites (58%), but was false positive in three patients. 111 In-DOTA-TOCT found abnormalities in 9 of 15 patients (60%) and detected 15 of 27 clinical lesions (56%); it was false positive in two patients. 111 In-DOTA-LAN scintigraphy showed abnormalities in 7 of 11 patients (64%) and found 12 of 22 clinical lesions (55%). False-positive 111 In-DOTA-LAN scan results were found in two patients. For supra-diaphragmatic lesions, 67 Ga scintigraphy detected 12 of 16 sites (75%). 111 In-DOTA-TOCT scintigraphy revealed 7 of 15 lesions (47%). 111 In-DOTA-LAN showed 6 of 12 positive sites (50%).

The biodistribution results of both 111 In and 67 Ga labeled T4NMPYP (3, 6, 24, and 48 hours) were similar but differed from that of 67 Ga citrate (48 hours). The optimum tumor uptake of both radiolabeled porphyrins was at 6 hours postinjection and was lower than the tumor uptake of 67 Ga citrate at 48 hours postinjection. Kidney was the only organ showing higher uptake of radiolabeled porphyrin compared to that of 67 Ga citrate. The imaging studies performed with 111 In T4NMPYP and 67 Ga citrate correspond to the biodistribution results. Osteomyelitis present in one mouse showed good localization of 111 In T4NMPYP. 15 refs., 3 figs., 5 tabs\n\nEvaluation of hilar 67Ga-citrate uptake in bronchogenic carcinoma\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nMatsuno, Noriyo; Kuyama, Junpei; Uchida, Yoshitaka; Hatano, Osamu; Imai, Yasunori; Uno, Kimiichi; Minoshima, Satoshi.\n\n1995-01-01\n\nWe evaluated hilar uptake on 67 Ga-citrate scintigraphy and correlated with hilar lymph node metastases in one-hundred seventeen cases (two-hundred thirty four hila) of bronchogenic carcinoma. Hilar uptake was classified into three grades independently on anterior and posterior chest views: no uptake (grade 0), uptake equal to that in the thoracic vertebrae (grade 1), and uptake higher than that in the thoracic vertebrae (grade 2). If a summed grade of anterior and posterior view was larger than 3, hilar uptake was considered as positive. In forty-four cases (forty-nine hila) with hilar lymph node metastases, positive hilar uptake was found in ten cases (eleven hila), resulting in sensitivity of 22% based on cases and 23% based on hila. In seventy-three cases (one-hundred forty-six hila) without hilar lymph node metastases, positive hilar uptake was found in six cases (ten hila), resulting in specificity of 91% based on cases and 93% based on hila. In comparison to scintigraphic findings of unilaterally positive hilar uptake, findings of bilaterally positive hilar uptake showed significantly lower accuracy in determining presence of hilar lymph node metastases. No definite correlation between hilar uptake and histopathology or 67 Ga-citrate uptake in a primary tumor was observed. The results indicate that usefulness of 67 Ga-citrate scintigraphy is limited when evaluating hilar lymph node metastases in bronchogenic carcinoma.

Fluorine-18 2'-deoxy-2-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) has been shown to accumulate in malignant tumours but also in inflammatory processes. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate FDG imaging with a double-head coincidence camera (DHCC) in patients with FUO in comparison with planar and single-photon emission tomography (SPET) 67 Ga citrate scanning. Twenty FUO patients underwent FDG imaging with a DHCC which included transaxial and longitudinal whole-body tomography. In 18 of these subjects, 67 Ga citrate whole-body and SPET imaging was performed. The 67 Ga citrate and FDG images were interpreted by two investigators, both blinded to the results of other diagnostic modalities. Forty percent (8/20) of the patients had infection, 25% (5/20) had auto-immune diseases, 10% (2/20) had neoplasms and 15% (3/20) had other diseases. Fever remained unexplained in 10% (2/20) of the patients. Of the 20 patients studied, FDG imaging was positive and essentially contributed to the final diagnosis in 11 (55%). The sensitivity of transaxial FDG tomography in detecting the focus of fever was 84% and the specificity, 86%. Positive and negative predictive values were 92% and 75%, respectively. If the analysis was restricted to the 18 patients who were investigated both with 67 Ga citrate and FDG, sensitivity was 81% and specificity, 86%. Positive and negative predictive values were 90% and 75%, respectively. The diagnostic accuracy of whole-body FDG tomography (again restricted to the aforementioned 18 patients) was lower (sensitivity, 36%; specificity, 86%; positive and negative predictive values, 80% and 46%, respectively). 67 Ga citrate SPET yielded a sensitivity of 67% in detecting the focus of fever and a specificity of 78%.

The combined scintigrams were correctly interpreted as indicating osteomyelitis in four studies. Of 18 studies in patients with infarction, the combined scintigrams were correctly interpreted in 16 and showed either no local accumulation of Ga-67 or less accumulation than that of Tc-99m MDP at symptomatic sites. In the other two studies, the scintigrams were falsely interpreted as indicating osteomyelitis and showed congruent, increased accumulation of both Tc-99, MDP and Ga-67. This pattern must be considered indeterminate. Overall, the results indicate that the combination of technetium and gallium scintigraphy is an effective means to distinguish osteomyelitis from infarction in patients with sickle cell hemoglobinopathies\n\nRadiolabeled, nonspecific, polyclonal human immunoglobulin in the detection of focal inflammation by scintigraphy: Comparison with gallium-67 citrate and technetium-99m-labeled albumin\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nRubin, R.H.; Fischman, A.J.; Needleman, M.; Wilkinson, R.; Callahan, R.J.; Khaw, B.A.; Hansen, W.P.; Kramer, P.B.; Strauss, H.W.\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe accumulation of nonspecific polyclonal human immunoglobulin (IgG) radiolabeled with 125 I or 111 In was compared to that of [ 67 Ga]citrate and [ 99m Tc]albumin in rats with deep thigh inflammation due to Escherichia coli infection.

As early as 3 hr postinjection, [ 111 In]IgG showed greater accumulation at the lesion than [ 99m Tc]HSA (p less than 0.01). Both [ 125 I]IgG and [ 111 In]IgG showed greater accumulation than [ 67 Ga]citrate (p less than 0.01). At 24 hr, IgG image definition increased, while HSA image definition decreased, and the intensity of accumulation of both IgG preparations was greater than that of [ 67 Ga]citrate or [ 99m Tc]HSA (p less than 0.01). At all imaging times, [ 67 Ga]citrate accumulation was surprisingly low. In inflammation produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Candida albicans, or turpentine, [ 111 In]IgG accumulation was similar to the results obtained with Escherichia coli. These studies suggest that focal sites of inflammation can be detected with radiolabeled nonspecific human polyclonal IgG\n\nDiagnosis of abdominal abscesses with 67gallium\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNoguera, E.C.; Mothe, G.A.\n\n1987-01-01\n\nTwenty six patients were studied with 67 Gallium to detect and localize the site of intra-abdominal and intraperitoneal infection. They were divided in two groups: a) with and b) without physical symptoms that could localize an abcess in the abdominal cavity. All the patients with suppuration had persistent up-take of 67 Ga in one anatomic area of the abdomen, subsequently documented by computarized axial tomography (CAT) in 58% of the cases or by laparotomy in 88% of them. Scintigraphy with 67 Ga in the patients with recent surgery not only detected focal infection in 67% of the cases but excluded subphernic collection. In 78% of patients with prolonged fever, the infection was localized. There was no false positive result. The comparison in 56% of the cases with CAT demonstrated that both techniques are 100% sensitive for the diagnosis of abdominal suppurative processes. Three of the 26 patients, after six weeks of medical treatment, were restudied with 67 Ga and CAT, showing total resolution of their previous abnormalities. It is concluded that 67 Ga scintigraphy performed as the first study in febrile patients independent of the presence or absence of physical symptoms that could localize the abdominal infection, is sensitive for the detection and localization of an abdominal abscess and that a negative result excludes it.

Barcelona (Spain)\n\n2000-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to compare the ability of 67-Gallium citrate (67Ga), 99m-Tc labelled leucocytes (99mTc-WBC) and 111-In-labelled immunoglobulin G (111In-IgG) scintigraphy in bone and joint infections diagnosis. Fifty-six patients were studied. For all patients a bone scan using 99mTc-MDP was indicated. The patients were randomized allocated for 67Ga (Group 1 - 22 patients) or simultaneous administration 99mTc-labelled leucocytes and 111In-IgG.(Group 2 - 34 patients) study. For the groups 1 and 2 were confirmed respectively 12/26 y 11/34 septic lesions. The 67Ga scintigraphy showed 6 true-positive, 9 true-negative, 5 false-positive and 6 false-negative. With 99mTc-WBC, the respective values were 8, 18, 5 and 3. With 111In-IgG, the figures were 7, 17, 6 and 4, respectively. The sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were 50%, 64,3% and 57,7% respectively for the 67Ga, 72,7%, 78,2% and 76,4% respectively for 99mTc-WBC and 63,6%, 73,9% and 70,6% respectively for 111In-IgG. In this study, the labelled leucocytes scintigraphy showed more accurate than 67Ga and 111In-IgG scans for the diagnosis of bone and joint infections. However, the obtained results were less reliable for the diagnosis of occult sepsis in the patients with joint prosthesis (Au)\n\nAbnormal splenic uptake of gallium-67 citrate in a case of infectious mononucleosis\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nCampeau, R.J.; LaCorte, W.S.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nA case of fever of undetermined origin (FUO) demonstrated abnormal intense concentration of Ga-67 citrate in the spleen. Initial workup demonstrated two negative mono spot tests for infectious mononucleosis (IM) but, on hospital day 2, a repeat mono test was positive. The diagnosis was subsequently confirmed by rising heterophilic antibody titers. Six weeks after hospital discharge, repeat Ga-67 citrate imaging demonstrated absence of abnormal splenic activity. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been previously described in IM. In the appropriate clinical setting, intense splenic uptake of Ga-67 should alert the clinician to include the possibility of IM in the differential diagnosis\n\nDiagnosis of thyroid lymphoma and follow-up evaluation using Ga-67 scintigraphy\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nNishiyama, Yoshihiro; Yamamoto, Yuka; Yokoe, Koiku; Satoh, Katashi; Ohkawa, Motoomi\n\n2003-01-01\n\nA strong association between malignant lymphoma and Hashimoto's thyroiditis has frequently been reported. However, it is difficult to detect the lymphomatous transformation of Hashimoto's thyroiditis in the early stage. The purpose of the present study was to examine the usefulness of 67 Ga scintigraphy in the diagnosis and evaluation of the therapeutic effects during follow-up, in patients with a suspected diagnosis of primary thyroid lymphoma. Twenty-five patients who were suspected of having primary thyroid lymphoma and had undergone 67 Ga scintigraphy were studied. 67 Ga planar scintigraphy was performed 72 hours after injection of 67 Ga-citrate. The degree and pattern of 67 Ga accumulation were graded visually. Histopathology on biopsy examination revealed thyroid lymphoma in 17 and Hashimoto's thyroiditis in 8 patients. Abnormal accumulation of 67 Ga in the thyroid was seen in all of the 17 thyroid lymphoma cases with additional mediastinal and abdominal involvement in one. Fifteen of 17 thyroid lymphoma patients also underwent 67 Ga scintigraphy 2-4 weeks after chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy. All 15 patients showed diminishing 67 Ga accumulation and a good clinical course. In one patient with local recurrence, abnormal accumulation could be depicted by follow-up scintigraphy. However, diffuse or enlarged accumulation in the thyroid was seen in all of the 8 Hashimoto's thyroiditis cases. The degree of abnormal accumulation in the thyroid in clinically active phase thyroiditis was more intense than that in the chronic phase thyroiditis. 67 Ga scintigraphy was helpful to confirm the diagnosis of thyroid lymphoma and to evaluate the therapeutic effects during follow-up. However, 67 Ga scintigraphy may not always distinguish thyroid lymphoma from Hashimoto's thyroiditis, especially the active phase of the disease.

However, it is expensive and not available in many hospitals. Technetium-99m has been proposed for colonic transit study but the short half-life has limited its use. Gallium-67 citrate is inexpensive and available in most countries. Most importantly, it has a suitable half-life for colonic transit study. Attempts have been made in some studies to use 67 Ga citrate to label activated charcoal, but the results have not been good because of poor stability. In this study, we successfully labelled activated charcoal with 67 Ga citrate by adding alcohol and 5% glucose solution. To evaluate the in vitro stability, the 67 Ga-activated charcoal was incubated in a milieu mimicking the intestinal content, containing lipase, trypsin and glycochenodeoxycholate at different pH values (6.0, 7.0, 7.4 and 8.0) and for different durations (0 h, 24 h, 48 h, 72 h and 96 h). For the in vivo study, the 67 Ga-activated charcoal was loaded into a commercial empty enteric capsule. Colonic transit scintigraphy was performed in five volunteers, including three healthy people and two constipated patients, after intake of the radioactive capsule. Images were obtained at 2 h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h, 24h, 48 h, 72 h etc. until no radioactivity was detected in the bowel. Our data show that the in vitro stability of 67 Ga-activated charcoal was good. The labelling efficiency still exceeded 91% at 96 h at pH values of 6.0, 7.0 and 7.4. In the group with a pH value of 8.0, the labelling efficiency gradually fell during the 4-day incubation but was still higher than 88% at the end of the fourth day. In the in vivo study, most capsules disintegrated in the caecum/colon region, and the 67 Ga-activated charcoal mixed very well with bowel content. In addition, the radioactive charcoal could be detected clearly on the 72-h image, which is very important for the evaluation of colonic transit time in patients with constipation.

Fever and leukocytosis were the first clinical signs suggesting infection. The usual diagnostic modalities, including CT and ultrasound, failed to identify the site of infection. A 67 Ga scan showed intense abnormal uptake behind the sternum. The site of uptake was shown by necropsy to be necrotic tissue involving cardiac sutures, pulmonary arteries, and the aorta due to infection with Haemophilus aphrophilus\n\nCase of sarcoidosis with generalized increased uptake of /sup 67/Ga-citrate\n\nEnergy Technology Data Exchange (ETDEWEB)\n\nOkada, Yoshitaka; Ohtake, Tohru; Nishikawa, Junichi; Iio, Masahiro; Machida, Kikuo\n\n1985-10-01\n\nA case of sarcoidosis was reported in which gallium-67 scintigraphy showed increased uptake in generalized sarcoid lesions. Gallium-67 uptake in skin lesions was also seen, which is rare in literature. A 22-year-old male patient was admitted to our hospital. The patient had a history of general fatigue, polydipsia and polyuria. On physical examination, swelling of the bilateral parotid glands and lacrimal glands was noted. There were many subcutaneous nodules, especially in both"
