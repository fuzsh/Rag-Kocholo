        "text": "Tecmo visited the lovely town of San Francisco this evening to show off the first solidly playable version of its revived classic NES game, Rygar, and IGN was on-hand to play the newly reborn title. Envisioned as a remake rather than a sequel, Rygar: The Legendary Adventure brings gamers into a majestic, mythical ancient world populated by princesses, warriors, gods and demons, all depicted in picturesque Greek and Roman environments.\n\nMuch in the same vein as Capcom's Onimusha series, Rygar has been reinvented for the more powerful PlayStation 2 with a keen eye on production values, ranging from superb CG and in-game graphics to excellent audio, in both score and effects. Producer Satoshi Kanematsu spent time in Greece researching archic temples and structures to provide an authentic look and feel for the game, which in many ways idealizes ancient Greece and Rome. Working with well-known singer and \"Diva\" Izzy for at least one song, Tecmo's team is also composing music for an 80-person orchestra, including a chorus of 20, to perform songs for the length of the game. But with all of this high brow production going on behind the scenes, Tecmo's goal is to make the game feel true to the original with a strong emphasis on Rygar's unique gameplay, based heavily around the unusual Discarmor.\n\nThe demo we played is a short, 10-minute affair, replete with an introductory video from Kanematsu (whose stud-like visage, with guitar in hand, is enough to make any Japanese girl faint), a video collage of special moves and abilities, and an impressive introductory CG film that sets up the story perfectly.\n\nThe CG work really is something to write home about. Using quick cuts to present the story, Tecmo's artists present viewers with a camera panning in on a mystical floating island (remember the island of Argus?) where a celebration is broken up by a sudden and massive earthquake. Naturally, it's not a normal tremor, but instead an evil invasion of the mainland by the newly named Titans (previously called Rollers) that spill from the earth in a frightening, epic assault. The Titans, gargoyle-faced caterpillars adorned with spikes and natural armor, are just the first wave. Chariot-riding skeletons and wieldy Cyclops armed with giant hammers filter into villages and ravage people, homes, and everything else in their way. The CG work is particularly excellent in its depiction of human faces (particularly Princess Harmonia, who resembles a certain immensely well-known female pop artist) and ethereal, well-lit sunsets and large, agrarian landscapes.\n\nFollowing the presentation, the demo disc, which should appear in some retail form as a playable teaser (and perhaps with a particular Official PlayStation magazine), enables players to start and play the demo. Just like the classic old NES version, Rygar remains classical in nature. You take on the role of a fantastically skilled Greco-Roman warrior who must rescue the princess Harmonia from assassination and restore order to the once peaceful land. The only problem is that Rygar has fallen down into the cracks of the earth, somehow unscathed, and must make his way through the labyrinthine set of corridors, coliseums, and platform-inspired structures to do so.\n\nVisually, the game is textured with an eye on classical extravagance. The Greek and Roman architecture is well constructed to create a feeling of being in an ancient and magical land. The deep tunnels and circular hallways are covered with an excellent mix of gold and rust colors, reminiscent of the height of the Roman civilization. The textures are all presented in high resolution, and the game's framerate runs at a nearly consistent 60 FPS (this early demo did lower at times, but we're sure Tecmo will correct it). Each creature, structure, enemy and setting is decadently lathered with a surprising amount of detail, polish and shine. From the looks of the demo we played, much like the designers behind Devil May Cry Temco's team looks to have created many smaller environments, which enable the team to keep the higher framerate and resolution consistent. We also expect to play in larger, more epic scale arenas and lavish landscapes, which the video and cutscenes hint at, but in the demo all of the settings are medium to small in nature.\n\nAside from that, lighting and special effects play a large part in setting the game's tone. Each time the Discarmor hits a wall or a solid object, a spray of gold sparks fly and dust lifts in a puff off the ancient walls. In one setting, Rygar must make his way through a set of timed, spiked traps which, each time they clamp down, produce a large, impressive cloud of dust and rubble. From various openings in the walls and cracks in the stone, light shines through to create a feeling of entrapment. One of the most impressive aspects of the game's high quality production is its use of sound. Using heavy base and treble effects, players get a jolt from all sorts of attacks, while bursting stone walls and slamming trap doors all highlight a keen focus on effectively used audio.\n\nThe game starts Rygar in a hallway of sorts, armed with the Discarmor. Just as in classic versions of the game, players can use this atypical weapon for both offensive and defensive tactics. On defense it's a shield (R2 or L2 are used for defend), and on offense it's a spiky yo-yo of death. Just imagine being attacked by a spiky yo-yo of death. Weird, huh? Sounds scary, doesn't it? Hm? Well, get scared real quick! It's all very funny until a spiky yo-yo of death slices your torso in twain and your Lego set is covered in blood and spit. Or pokes your eye out¿ Yeah, yo-yos are very harmful in Rygar, so watch it when you speak badly of yo-yos¿\n\nEh-hem, anyway, by pressing square or triangle to unleash the Discarmor, players unwind it for a direct attack or perform a choreographed attack, respectively. To get into the attacks with a tad more complexity, holding down Square will pick up an enemy. Then, by spinning the left analog in a circular motion, you create a circle of pain for any creatures in its perimeter. By attacking, holding Square, and waggling the Discarmor back and forth, players perform a kind of wild hose attack, sort of like a waggle.\n\nPlayers start off with a few basic moves, such as these two, and then collect new abilities as they progress past gaggles of enemies, sub-bosses, physical puzzles, and full-on mythically-derived Greek bosses. In the demo, players earn the ability to hold he Discarmor at length for long periods of time, as well as acquiring the slide skill. By pressing R1 and X, Rygar performs a quick slide, enabling him to rapidly escape slower enemies and to duck underneath low tunnels and into crawlspaces. The basic moves are X for jump, Square or Triangle to attack, and variations, such as jump and attack (X plus Square).\n\nTecmo's camera philosophy seems to try and solve problems created by last generation games. The camera work falls somewhere in between Capcom's Onimusha series and Devil May Cry, with its own slight take on still cameras. It appears that about half of the time the cameras are still and set, while the rest of the time it moves with the player from various angles. Tecmo is definitely going for a cinematic approach, with a strong attempt to create tension and mood with movie-like camera angles. But it's clear that the designers also know that still cameras retain their own set of problems, and so often times the camera moves with you, or shows Rygar from a higher, third-person perspective, almost like the isometric angles from the 16-bit days.\n\nThe demo offered a simple, quick look at Rygar's gameplay, but clearly hid much of the game's more sexy secrets. In this demo you essentially learn how to use the Discarmor, slash two-dozen or so Titans, escape an easy physical puzzle, and confront a hammer-wielding Cyclops before slipping into a giant coliseum. But it's clear that from the intro movies that Rygar can perform multiple attacks and clear various gaps and bridges using the Discarmor as a kind of grappling tool. The game shows him swinging from it much like in old Rygar games and like in Bionic Commandos. He also uses the Discarmor to bridge large gaps, linking it to various colored tags. Another enjoyable aspect of the game is Rygar's ability to break all number of environments. Doors, old stone rummble, windows and numerous other items can be smashed to bits with the Discarmor.\n\nAnd last but not least, Rygar has the ability to cast wild spells for the larger boss attacks. In doing so, players enter in to a mystical realm from which a pride of stone lions appear ready to savage the oncoming enemy. The demo just hints at this, but its clear that Rygar attains a massive amount of experience and as he does so the enemies and bosses grow more complex and more difficult to beat.\n\nIn all, we were incredibly happy with Rygar: The Legendary Adventure. It mixed some good platform action with some basic physical puzzles and a hefty amount of combat action. No doubt, Tecmo's newest project is a beautiful testament to Rygar's lineage and a potential blockbuster of a game, replete with high quality production values, a mix of new-age cinematics and graphics, and revised old-school gameplay. Look for Rygar: The Legendary Adventure to appear in national retail stores in mid-November."
