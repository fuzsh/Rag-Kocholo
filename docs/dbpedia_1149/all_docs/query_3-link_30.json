        "text": "Pneuma - Restores Icol. A blue flame dropped by enemies or found in rubble. The effects of this item are immediate when they are picked up.\n\nAmbrosia - Restores all life. This can be carried by Rygar as inventory. You can only carry one. On easy, this is increased to three. This is a rare item, so use it only when necessary.\n\nOmphalos - Restores all Icol. This can be carried by Rygar as inventory. You can only carry one. On easy, this is increased to three. This is a rare item, so use it only when necessary.\n\nCaduceus - Revives Rygar with full life and icol if killed. You can only carry one, regardless of difficulty. Automatically used if Rygar dies. This item is very rare. Try not to die unless you can't help it (like during the last boss on Legendary).\n\nHoly Sword - Increases Rygar's attack by one, up to 49. If you clear the current play, you can inherit this value on the next game.\n\nHoly Shield - Increases Rygar's defence by one, up to 49. If you clear the current play, you can inherit this value on the next game.\n\nHoly Armour - Increases Rygar's life. The maximum is 990 life. If you clear the current play, you can inherit this value on the next game.\n\nTablet, Letter, Scroll - Various background material that makes for excellent bathroom reading. Some give hints but most deal with the story.\n\nSound Chunk, Statuette, Relief - There are several and they are fairly randomised. Each unlocks a piece of music, a picture, or a movie in the Gallery. And no, they do not change the future.\n\nSilver Statue - Statue that may hold a variety of items, and are usually quite common. Their contents vary the least depending on the difficulty level chosen; any Mystic Stones from Silver Statues will become Pneuma when struck apart during a replay.\n\nBlack Statue - Statue made of a darker metal, and is more difficult to see while exploring. They are less common that Silver Statues, but their contents remain the same throughout all difficulties (except the one holding Persephone).\n\nGold Statue - Statue made of gold. For some reason, Rygar doesn't scrape up the pieces like American pennies on the floor. These statues hold crucial skills and moves that allow Rygar a greater degree of mobility and improvement. Gold statues are hard to miss, since they are necessary to finishing the game (mostly). Some gold statues holding the optional Diskarmour skills will be out of the way, but they are not necessary for finishing the game.\n\nPot Switch - From the first Rygar, the pot switch is magically attenuated to the ley lines of Argus and will unlock magick seals that bar intruders. Rygar will find many of these in his journey and they will be the immediate objective in most stages.\n\nStomp Switch - For the new Rygar, this switch resembles a giant metal pedastel. Rygar needs the stomp skill to use this switch. Like the pot switch, this switch will be linked to obstacles that bar Rygar, but they cannot be dealt with until after World 4 is cleared.\n\nMetal \"Tackle\" Box - These are large boxes made of a strange alloy. An unknown energy passes through the circuitry on the cube's surface. Rygar will need the tackle ability from World 6 before he may overcome these obstacles.\n\nMystic Stone - As opposed to \"Mystic Heroes\", these 25 stones actually do something and enhance Rygar's already impressive abilities. Some are easy to find, some are not. All are indispensable on Hard or Legendary difficulties. Plus you want to collect them all anyway to have them available for harder difficulty levels. All mystic stones are unique and can only be picked up once. When you pick up a stone from a preset location, that statue or rubble will have Pneuma the next time you smash it. The only exception is with Hestia and Eirene. These two stones occupy the same location, except on different difficulty levels.\n\nFirst Row\n\nAres, God of War - Increases attack beyond base attack value\n\nNormal difficulty. First found on World 4 Labyrinthos on Normal, inside the courtyard past the beach entrance. Strike apart one of the statues in the courtyard stairs that lead up to the Hades Execution statue. This stone is accruable. This means that each one you pick up will add its bonus to your existing Ares stone. It's quite possible to possess Ares of a very high value if you replay the game (or One World mode, Labyrinthos on Normal) enough times. Ares may also be found dropped by enemies on Hard and Legendary, and is a reward in Necromondio on Easy. Ares has a terminal limit of +50. After this, all Ares stone locations become Pneuma.\n\nAthena, Goddess of Wisdom - Increases defence beyond base defence value\n\nEasy and Normal difficulty. The Athena Stone is found in the same area as Ares on Normal difficulty. In addition, Athena can also be found inside a room barred by a metal \"tackle\" box in the Elysion Shrine. Like the Ares stone, the Athena stone can accrue its bonus, giving Rygar the needed help on Hard and Legendary modes (not so much on Legendary, but at least on Hard). Athena may also be found dropped by enemies on Hard and Legendary. Athena has a terminal limit of +50. After this, all Athena stone locations become Pneuma.\n\nDemeter, Goddess of Harvest - Decreases impact damage from knockback\n\nNormal difficulty. Replay only. Random enemy drop on Normal replay. If Rygar is knocked against a wall or floor from an attack (think Minotaur or Cyclops), he will take half the damage indicative of the difficulty level.\n\nAphrodite, Goddess of Love - Barter Icol for Life, Motion is L1 + Square or Circle\n\nAny difficulty. You will need the Swing/Lift skill. In the Palace of the Three Knights, locate the stairs hidden inside one of the alcoves. Navigate the ledges on the upper story to the right and use the yellow latch orb to swing across the gap to the statue. Equip Aphrodite when you require life and you have Icol to spare. Aphrodite, being the nymph that she is, bestows 48 life for 24 Icol. Exactly how she recovers Rygar's life is up to your livid imagination. Huhuhuhu.\n\nApollo, God of the Sun - Guard Interrupt. Motion is L1, L1 quickly or R1, R1 quickly\n\nLegendary difficulty. Random enemy drop. I earned this in World 7, Tartaros. One of the two invisible Cyclops in the room just before you fight the invisible Minotaur dropped this stone of dubious value.\n\nSecond Row\n\nArtemis, Goddess of the Hunt - Recover Life through kills\n\nAny difficulty. World 1, Colosseo. You will need the Tackle skill. The Artemis stone is behind a metal \"tackle\" box in World 1, Colosseo. The entrance is where Rygar appears on the Main Field after slaying Hekatonchiertes, the Colosseo Boss. This area of the Main Field exits to the Colosseo or Geyron Hill. A section of fence in this area is broken (towards the bottom of the screen) that allows Rygar to revisit the Colosseo. For players who are eighteen and anal, Artemis is in the statue you saw past the hanging cage near the last save point in World 1 (right before you fought Hekatonchiertes). True to her nature, Artemis awards Rygar five life for each enemy he slays.\n\nHephaestus, God of the Forge - Earn Sfaira through kills\n\nAny difficulty. In World 3, the Poseidonia Shrine, there is a balcony in the water filled courtyard outside the Shrine proper that has a statue you can't jump to. Access the statue from inside the Shrine. You will need to flood the Hall of the Sun and earn the Sea Diskamour before you can get Hephaestus. After securing the Sea Diskarmour, head back to the Hall of the Sun. After the Sea Font cut-scene, head for the Sea Font and make a small detour out of the shrine by sliding under the small hole by the Sea Font. If Hephaestus is equipped on a Diskarmour that makes a kill, Rygar earns 10 Sfaira for the kill alone. Yes, this includes bosses.\n\nDionysus, God of Partying-Down - Imparts knockback to Rygar's attacks\n\nHard difficulty. Random enemy drop. Enemies can be knocked back to take extra impact damage from Rygar's attacks. You will need to execute variant or combo attacks to deliver impart knockback, or he won't do anything useful. The standard combo attack of any Diskarmour (Square multiple times) will impart knockback.\n\nHestia, Goddess of the Hearth - Enables auto guard\n\nEasy difficulty; there are no exceptions. In the Palace of the Three Knights, in one of the black pillars ringing the center structure. Search for this valuable stone after the fight with the Sphinx Boss, not before. Hestia will automatically block for Rygar if he is not attacking, in mid-air, or staggering back from a hit. Hestia allows Rygar to move freely and instantly block most attacks, giving players with slow reactions an edge in combat.\n\nHera, Queen of Heaven - Widens Heaven Diskarmour's Remote sweep\n\nAny difficulty. Found in World 5, Mt. Othrys. After fighting the Red Boa and the Centaur Bosses, you will entertained by a nice bee-ess session with some familiar people. After the cutscene, head left and get back to the cave with four entrances. This room looks like one of those plastic sporks you pick up at Kentucky Fried Chicken. In this spork room, climb the steps and head outside to the series of ledges leading to Arcadia. Drop down the third gap for the statue. Hera widens the area of the Remote move from 90 degrees to 180 degrees.\n\nThird Row\n\nPersephone, Queen of Hades - Enables fast snap on Hades Diskarmour\n\nAny difficulty. In the Main Field. This stone requires the Stomp. Head to the area in the Main Area with the Mt. Othrys Warp and stomp the lone switch in that area. This collapses a section of the walkway to allow Rygar to get the drop on Persephone. Use the walkway above the stomp switch to get to the statue. Persephone allows Rygar to grab and throw an enemy instead of going through any twirling motion before hand. Hard and fast - just how Persephone likes it. Huhuhuhu.\n\nHermes, Messenger of the Gods - Imparts the Dash. Motion is L1 + X\n\nAny difficulty. In the Main Field. You will need the Lift/Swing skill. Head to the area of the Main Field that has the Warp to Labyrinthos. There is a side path that leads to the statue, but is not visible on the screen at first. The entrance will be to the left of the stairs by the save point. It's best to simply follow the wall to the left and attempt head away from the camera to find that side path. Once you find the side path, you will need to swing across and then make several small jumps to Hermes. Hermes allows Rygar to dash. Whether teh dash is more useful than the slide is debatable, but it allows Rygar to dash over the lava streams on Mt. Othrys without taking damage.\n\nZephyrus, the West Wind - Invincible while jumping\n\nNormal difficulty. Random enemy drop. Zephyrus renders Rygar completely immune to harm while he is ascending from a jump, but not as he is falling. If Rygar is falling from a higher ledge to a lower ledge, he will not be invincible either. Couple this with Notus to be mostly invincible in mid-air.\n\nBoreas, the North Wind - Invincible while tackling\n\nAny difficulty. In Arcadia. The third demonstration sequence in the game gives you an idea of where this stone is. In Arcadia, after earning tackle, head to the same general area that has a metal \"tackle\" box at the dead end with a rock hanging over it. Tackle the metal box and jump on it. Use the red latch orb to ride the giant rock. Stay on the giant rock until it reaches its apex, then jump off to the up and right. Swing with a Diskarmour when Rygar is in front of the \"dark patch\" on the mountain. Swing onto the rock debris and then head away from the camera when you land. The stone is in the statue on the secret ledge. Boreas renders Rygar invincible while tackling.\n\nNotus, the South Wind - Invincible while stomping\n\nAny difficulty. In Arcadia. At the first set of ferris wheel rock platforms, ignore obvious landing at the apex of the ferris wheel ride and stay on the rock until you reach another set of motionless rock platforms. The stone is in a statue on the island nearby. You can get there later, but do it this way to skip the detour. Notus makes Rygar invincible in the first half of the Stomp motion (going down). You may want to combine Notus and Zephyrus to make Rygar invulnerable 80% of the time while airborne.\n\nFourth Row\n\nEurus, the East Wind - Invincible while sliding\n\nHard difficulty. Random enemy drop. Eurus renders Rygar invincible while sliding, but only from certain attacks. Lava will also not affect Rygar if he slides over it. When Rygar starts getting out of the slide, he will be vulnerable. Gold sparks emitted while sliding will indicate whether you have Eurus equipped or not.\n\nClotho, the Fate Who Weaves - Doubles the Icol collected\n\nAny difficulty. In Mt. Othrys. Above the warp leading to the Main Field, there is a portion of the mini-map you can't reach. Use the Hades Diskarmour to snap throw a fire roller at the column across the gap to make the connection. The stone is in the statue over there. Clotho allows Rygar to gain double the Icol from the Pneuma power-up, as well as gain double the normal amount of Icol from killing enemies.\n\nLachesis, the Fate Who Measures - Increases Icol for familiar summons\n\nLegendary difficulty. In the Necromandio Cave, level 25. Lachesis reduces the Icol needed for summoning familiars by one level. If a level 1 Diskarmour has Lachesis' aid, it will only cost 30 Icol to summon the familiar instead of 40. At level 3, Lachesis gives a Diskarmour six one-level summons instead of five.\n\nAtropos, the Fate Who Cuts - Barter Life for Icol. Motion is L1 + Triangle\n\nNormal difficulty. Random enemy drop. Atropos allows Rygar to use his life to restock his Icol. Useful if you have life to spare and you need the Icol to kill a hammer wielding Cyclops. When combined with Hypnos, you will be able to fully prepare yourself for any battle. 24 Icol is gained for every 48 life used in this manner.\n\nFifth Row\n\nEirene, Goddess of Peace - Halves damage dealt from and received by Rygar\n\nLegendary difficulty; no exceptions. In the Palace of the Three Knights. Where Hestia was on Easy, Eirene is on Legendary. Get her after the fight with the Boss Sphinx. Eirene reduces the damage dealt by everyone; Rygar and enemies will experience longer fights as long as she is equipped. You may want to equip Eirene when you are dodging a Boss' attacks, then getting de-equip her just before you initiate your own attack.\n\nHypnos, God of Dreams - Imparts rest. Motion is controller idle for 10 full seconds\n\nNormal difficulty; no exceptions. On level 25 of the Necromondio Cave. Hypnos fully guarantees Rygar will always be at full life provided he has a place to rest. True, your clear time will be butt ugly, but you will have no excuse to face any boss with less than full life once you have this stone. Hypnos regenerates 10 life for each segment of time you let Rygar rest.\n\nTanatos, God of Death - Imparts chance for critical hit\n\nAny difficulty. In World 4, Labyrinthos, the left tower's second floor. Find the stone near the rubble by the save point. Rygar may now have a slim chance of reducing an enemy's life points to very low with any Diskarmour move. The screen will flash white when Tanatos works its magic. Tanatos does not work against Bosses. If it did, you wouldn't need this guide.\n\nMorpheus, God of Slumber - Imparts rest. Motion is controller idle for 10 full seconds\n\nHard difficulty. Necromondio Cave's infamous level 25. This stone lets Rygar recover Icol while resting. Use in conjunction with Hypnos (although Atropos is a good substitute) and you can pass any world in the game provided you find a spot to rest before you jump into things.\n\nDiscuss Game on our Free boards!"
