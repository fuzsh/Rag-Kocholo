        "text": "So this game may have been a bit of an inspiration for God of War, but it is not as good. The music is disappointing as it is not really all that impressive, I would say the NES version had the better music and that is just sad. For the most part it is straightforward, though there are times you must backtrack to certain areas as there is an area that is a bit like a staging ground that leads to the various levels. You can level up your Disc Armors (there are three different types) to make the game a bit less challenging. You also solve a few puzzles in this one as you collect more abilities and such along the way. You also can perform a type of summon to inflict damage upon the enemies too. He must traverse many temples and fight mighty titans on his quest to rescue the princess and put a stop to the villain Icarus' plans to destroy Argos by resurrecting the king of all titans, Cronus! The game play consists of going through temples and such for the most part using your Disc Armor weapon to attack enemies and defend yourself from their attacks.\n\nThe princess Harmonia is kidnapped and it is up to Rygar to save the day with the help of a weapon called the Disc Armor. The story has evil forces arising and attacking the kingdom of Argos. I do not want to be totally negative though as these days it is nice to have a game you can win in a sitting or two. This is the console that housed Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas so I know the system and discs could hold a lot more than this game that took me just under four hours to complete. This game is rather short, even by PS2 standards. I remember having to leave my NES on overnight paused so I could continue. The game was fun to traverse and though you had to complete it in one go, took some time to get through. Rygar was first scene in the arcades and in a very good NES port. There are other issues as well, but I shall get to them later.\n\nIt is not really anything all that special as it has pretty good graphics for the time however, there are issues with camera angles and that is unforgivable unless this game had come out on the first Playstation console. That being said, it is just an okay game.\n\nYour hero swings a weapon around and you are fighting mythical creatures and such. Rygar: The Legendary Adventure won't ever be fondly remembered as a lost masterpiece, but the gamers who give it a chance will find a solid game free from the shackles of modern conventions like angry stories or overly complicated controls.This game came out well before God Of War, but it is very similar in nature to the more well known game. The only other stab at giving the series another chance was in 2008 when Tecmo ported the game to the Wii, but they redesigned the hero to look like a total jerk, and I don't blame those who didn't want to give him another chance. Tecmo found better success with Ninja Gaiden in 2004, and Sony's God of War took a much angrier turn at Greek mythology and proved to ulimately be more successful, leaving the Rygar franchise dead in its tracks. At least, this is how my high school mind registered these new PlayStation 2 graphics. Huge castles, open skies, crazy rock formations. Rygar starts small in a tightly confined hallway, but his Greek mythology inspired chaotic world quickly opens up with marvelous set pieces. Devil May Cry's castle was a claustrophobic nightmare, dark and pitted with awkward corners and a sense of actually being trapped in hell. The true allure of Rygar came from the majestic feel of its setting, though. Rygar finds three of these on his journey, and each improves with usage, so the combat never becomes too stale. Much like the NES game though, Rygar is equipped with \"Diskarmor,\" a truly unique weapon which can best be described as a spiked shield with a retractable chain attachment. Rygar: The Legendary Adventure had all the makings of a decent new franchise for Tecmo to build on, but the game was lost amongst a cloud of better marketed titles during a time when the previous generation was finally hitting its stride.Ä¯or what it's worth, the game is a Devil May Cry clone, down to its fixed camera angles and intense combat. Tecmo tapped an NES cult classic to answer the heavy hitting action in Capcom's hot new series, Devil May Cry, and ironically, the game also became a cult hit of its time. Nothing wrong with playing a little catch up, especially for a game I would love to recommend. I missed out on last week's PlayStation 2 Classic update, but luckily they don't have anything posted this week."
