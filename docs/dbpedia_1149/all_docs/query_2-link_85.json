        "text": "Effects of trap-assisted tunneling on gate-induced drain leakage in silicon-germanium channel p-type FET for scaled supply voltages\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTiwari, Vishal A.; Divakaruni, Rama; Hook, Terence B.; Nair, Deleep R.\n\n2016-04-01\n\nSilicon-germanium is considered as an alternative channel material to silicon p-type FET (pFET) for the development of energy efficient high performance transistors for 28 nm and beyond in a high-k metal gate technology because of its lower threshold voltage and higher mobility. However, gate-induced drain leakage (GIDL) is a concern for high threshold voltage device design because of tunneling at reduced bandgap. In this work, the trap-assisted tunneling and band-to-band tunneling (BTBT) effects on GIDL is analyzed and modeled for SiGe pFETs. Experimental results and Monte Carlo simulation results reveal that the pre-halo germanium pre-amorphization implant used to contain the short channel effects contribute to GIDL at the drain sidewall in addition to GIDL due to BTBT in SiGe devices. The results are validated by comparing the experimental observations with the numerical simulation and a set of calibrated models are used to describe the GIDL mechanisms for various drain and gate bias.\n\nA III-V nanowire channel on silicon for high-performance vertical transistors.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTomioka, Katsuhiro; Yoshimura, Masatoshi; Fukui, Takashi\n\n2012-08-09\n\nSilicon transistors are expected to have new gate architectures, channel materials and switching mechanisms in ten years' time. The trend in transistor scaling has already led to a change in gate structure from two dimensions to three, used in fin field-effect transistors, to avoid problems inherent in miniaturization such as high off-state leakage current and the short-channel effect. At present, planar and fin architectures using III-V materials, specifically InGaAs, are being explored as alternative fast channels on silicon because of their high electron mobility and high-quality interface with gate dielectrics. The idea of surrounding-gate transistors, in which the gate is wrapped around a nanowire channel to provide the best possible electrostatic gate control, using InGaAs channels on silicon, however, has been less well investigated because of difficulties in integrating free-standing InGaAs nanostructures on silicon. Here we report the position-controlled growth of vertical InGaAs nanowires on silicon without any buffering technique and demonstrate surrounding-gate transistors using InGaAs nanowires and InGaAs/InP/InAlAs/InGaAs core-multishell nanowires as channels. Surrounding-gate transistors using core-multishell nanowire channels with a six-sided, high-electron-mobility transistor structure greatly enhance the on-state current and transconductance while keeping good gate controllability. These devices provide a route to making vertically oriented transistors for the next generation of field-effect transistors and may be useful as building blocks for wireless networks on silicon platforms.\n\nNew Role of P/Q-type Voltage-gated Calcium Channels\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nHansen, Pernille B L\n\n2015-01-01\n\nVoltage-gated calcium channels are important for the depolarization-evoked contraction of vascular smooth muscle cells (SMCs), with L-type channels being the classical channel involved in this mechanism. However, it has been demonstrated that the CaV2.1 subunit, which encodes a neuronal isoform...... of the voltage-gated calcium channels (P/Q-type), is also expressed and contributes functionally to contraction of renal blood vessels in both mice and humans. Furthermore, preglomerular vascular SMCs and aortic SMCs coexpress L-, P-, and Q-type calcium channels within the same cell. Calcium channel blockers...... are widely used as pharmacological treatments. However, calcium channel antagonists vary in their selectivity for the various calcium channel subtypes, and the functional contribution from P/Q-type channels as compared with L-type should be considered. Confirming the presence of P/Q-type voltage...\n\nStudy Trapped Charge Distribution in P-Channel Silicon-Oxide-Nitride-Oxide-Silicon Memory Device Using Dynamic Programming Scheme\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLi, Fu-Hai; Chiu, Yung-Yueh; Lee, Yen-Hui; Chang, Ru-Wei; Yang, Bo-Jun; Sun, Wein-Town; Lee, Eric; Kuo, Chao-Wei; Shirota, Riichiro\n\n2013-04-01\n\nIn this study, we precisely investigate the charge distribution in SiN layer by dynamic programming of channel hot hole induced hot electron injection (CHHIHE) in p-channel silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) memory device. In the dynamic programming scheme, gate voltage is increased as a staircase with fixed step amplitude, which can prohibits the injection of holes in SiN layer. Three-dimensional device simulation is calibrated and is compared with the measured programming characteristics. It is found, for the first time, that the hot electron injection point quickly traverses from drain to source side synchronizing to the expansion of charged area in SiN layer. As a result, the injected charges quickly spread over on the almost whole channel area uniformly during a short programming period, which will afford large tolerance against lateral trapped charge diffusion by baking.\n\nAnalytical model for subthreshold current and subthreshold swing of short-channel double-material-gate MOSFETs with strained-silicon channel on siliconâgermanium substrates\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTiwari Pramod Kumar; Saramekala Gopi Krishna; Mukhopadhyay Anand Kumar; Dubey Sarvesh\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe present work gives some insight into the subthreshold behaviour of short-channel double-material-gate strained-silicon on siliconâgermanium MOSFETs in terms of subthreshold swing and off-current. The formulation of subthreshold current and, thereupon, the subthreshold swing have been done by exploiting the expression of potential distribution in the channel region of the device. The dependence of the subthreshold characteristics on the device parameters, such as Ge mole fraction, gate length ratio, work function of control gate metal and gate length, has been tested in detail. The analytical models have been validated by the numerical simulation results that were obtained from the device simulation software ATLASâ¢ by Silvaco Inc.

Experimental results are presented on the main electrical parameters of MOS transistors made on silicon on sapphire, e.g. mean values and spreads of: threhold voltage and surface mobilities of transistors, breakdown voltages, and leakage currents of diodes. These devices have been made in three different technologies: enhancement P. channel technology, depletion-enhancement P. channel technology, and complementary MOS technology. These technologies are all aluminium gate processes with standard design rules and 5Î¼m channel length. Measurements show that presently available silicon on sapphire can be considered as a very suitable substrate for many MOS digital applications (but not for dynamic circuits) [fr\n\nFabrication and characterization of novel gate-all-around polycrystalline silicon junctionless field-effect transistors with ultrathin horizontal tube-shape channel\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nChang, You-Tai; Peng, Kang-Ping; Li, Pei-Wen; Lin, Horng-Chih\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this paper, we report on a novel fabrication process for the production of junctionless field-effect transistors with an ultrathin polycrystalline silicon (poly-Si) tube channel in a gate-all-around (GAA) configuration. The core of the poly-Si tube channel is filled with either a silicon nitride or a silicon oxide layer, and the effects of the core layers on the device characteristics are evaluated. The devices show excellent switching performance, thanks to the combination of the ultrathin tube channel and the GAA structure. Hysteresis loops in the transfer characteristics of the nitride-core devices are observed, owing to the dynamic trapping of electrons in the nitride core.\n\nLong Channel Carbon Nanotube as an Alternative to Nanoscale Silicon Channels in Scaled MOSFETs\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichael Loong Peng Tan\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Long channel carbon nanotube transistor (CNT can be used to overcome the high electric field effects in nanoscale length silicon channel. When maximum electric field is reduced, the gate of a field-effect transistor (FET is able to gain control of the channel at varying drain bias. The device performance of a zigzag CNTFET with the same unit area as a nanoscale silicon metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET channel is assessed qualitatively. The drain characteristic of CNTFET and MOSFET device models as well as fabricated CNTFET device are explored over a wide range of drain and gate biases. The results obtained show that long channel nanotubes can significantly reduce the drain-induced barrier lowering (DIBL effects in silicon MOSFET while sustaining the same unit area at higher current density.\n\nOptimal inverter logic gate using 10-nm double gate-all-around (DGAA transistor with asymmetric channel width\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMyunghwan Ryu\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available We investigate the electrical characteristics of a double-gate-all-around (DGAA transistor with an asymmetric channel width using three-dimensional device simulation. The DGAA structure creates a silicon nanotube field-effect transistor (NTFET with a core-shell gate architecture, which can solve the problem of loss of gate controllability of the channel and provides improved short-channel behavior. The channel width asymmetry is analyzed on both sides of the terminals of the transistors, i.e., source and drain. In addition, we consider both n-type and p-type DGAA FETs, which are essential to forming a unit logic cell, the inverter. Simulation results reveal that, according to the carrier types, the location of the asymmetry has a different effect on the electrical properties of the devices. Thus, we propose the N/P DGAA FET structure with an asymmetric channel width to form the optimal inverter. Various electrical metrics are analyzed to investigate the benefits of the optimal inverter structure over the conventional inverter structure. Simulation results show that 27% delay and 15% leakage power improvement are enabled in the optimum structure.\n\nA Non-canonical Voltage-Sensing Mechanism Controls Gating in K2P K(+) Channels.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSchewe, Marcus; Nematian-Ardestani, Ehsan; Sun, Han; Musinszki, Marianne; Cordeiro, SÃ¶nke; Bucci, Giovanna; de Groot, Bert L; Tucker, Stephen J; Rapedius, Markus; Baukrowitz, Thomas\n\n2016-02-25\n\nTwo-pore domain (K2P) K(+) channels are major regulators of excitability that endow cells with an outwardly rectifying background \"leak\" conductance. In some K2P channels, strong voltage-dependent activation has been observed, but the mechanism remains unresolved because they lack a canonical voltage-sensing domain. Here, we show voltage-dependent gating is common to most K2P channels and that this voltage sensitivity originates from the movement of three to four ions into the high electric field of an inactive selectivity filter. Overall, this ion-flux gating mechanism generates a one-way \"check valve\" within the filter because outward movement of K(+) induces filter opening, whereas inward movement promotes inactivation. Furthermore, many physiological stimuli switch off this flux gating mode to convert K2P channels into a leak conductance. These findings provide insight into the functional plasticity of a K(+)-selective filter and also refine our understanding of K2P channels and the mechanisms by which ion channels can sense voltage.

Influences of DMG properties namely the gate length ratio (L1:L2) and gate material workfunction difference (ÎÎ¦M) as well as structural and operational parameters which are silicon thickness (TSi) and threshold voltage (VTH) setting variation on the noise performance were carried out on simulation basis using ATLAS 2D. Results show better noise performance in DMG as compare to the standard gate structure of FD-SOI devices. Higher VTH for DMG design is recommended for minimized noise figure in line with the advantage of inverse VTH roll-off characteristics for short channel effects suppression.\n\nMolecular Aspects of Structure, Gating, and Physiology of pH-Sensitive Background K2P and Kir K+-Transport Channels\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSepÃºlveda, Francisco V.; Pablo Cid, L.; Teulon, Jacques; Niemeyer, MarÃ­a Isabel\n\n2015-01-01\n\nK+ channels fulfill roles spanning from the control of excitability to the regulation of transepithelial transport. Here we review two groups of K+ channels, pH-regulated K2P channels and the transport group of Kir channels. After considering advances in the molecular aspects of their gating based on structural and functional studies, we examine their participation in certain chosen physiological and pathophysiological scenarios. Crystal structures of K2P and Kir channels reveal rather unique features with important consequences for the gating mechanisms. Important tasks of these channels are discussed in kidney physiology and disease, K+ homeostasis in the brain by Kir channel-equipped glia, and central functions in the hearing mechanism in the inner ear and in acid secretion by parietal cells in the stomach. K2P channels fulfill a crucial part in central chemoreception probably by virtue of their pH sensitivity and are central to adrenal secretion of aldosterone. Finally, some unorthodox behaviors of the selectivity filters of K2P channels might explain their normal and pathological functions. Although a great deal has been learned about structure, molecular details of gating, and physiological functions of K2P and Kir K+-transport channels, this has been only scratching at the surface. More molecular and animal studies are clearly needed to deepen our knowledge.

Leak K(2P K(+ channels TASK-2, TALK-1 and TALK-2 are gated open by extracellular alkalinization. The mechanism for this alkalinization-dependent gating has been proposed to be the neutralization of the side chain of a single arginine (lysine in TALK-2 residue near the pore of TASK-2, which occurs with the unusual pK(a of 8.0. We now corroborate this hypothesis by transplanting the TASK-2 extracellular pH (pH(o sensor in the background of a pH(o-insensitive TASK-3 channel, which leads to the restitution of pH(o-gating. Using a concatenated channel approach, we also demonstrate that for TASK-2 to open, pH(o sensors must be neutralized in each of the two subunits forming these dimeric channels with no apparent cross-talk between the sensors. These results are consistent with adaptive biasing force analysis of K(+ permeation using a model selectivity filter in wild-type and mutated channels. The underlying free-energy profiles confirm that either a doubly or a singly charged pH(o sensor is sufficient to abolish ion flow. Atomic detail of the associated mechanism reveals that, rather than a collapse of the pore, as proposed for other K(2P channels gated at the selectivity filter, an increased height of the energetic barriers for ion translocation accounts for channel blockade at acid pH(o. Our data, therefore, strongly suggest that a cycle of protonation/deprotonation of pH(o-sensing arginine 224 side chain gates the TASK-2 channel by electrostatically tuning the conformational stability of its selectivity filter.\n\nGating of a pH-sensitive K(2P) potassium channel by an electrostatic effect of basic sensor residues on the selectivity filter.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nZÃºÃ±iga, Leandro; MÃ¡rquez, Valeria; GonzÃ¡lez-Nilo, Fernando D; Chipot, Christophe; Cid, L Pablo; SepÃºlveda, Francisco V; Niemeyer, MarÃ­a Isabel\n\n2011-01-25\n\nK(+) channels share common selectivity characteristics but exhibit a wide diversity in how they are gated open.

Compared to previous DG FETs with a planar-type silicon channel layer, the constructed SiNW DG FETs exhibited superior electrical properties including a higher capacitive-coupling ratio of 18.0 and a lower off-state leakage current under high-temperature stress. In addition, while the conventional planar single-gate (SG) FET- and planar DG FET-based pH sensors showed the sensitivities of 56.7 mV/pH and 439.3 mV/pH, respectively, the SiNW DG FET-based pH sensors showed not only a higher sensitivity of 984.1 mV/pH, but also a lower drift rate of 0.8% for pH-sensitivity. This demonstrates that the SiNW DG FETs simultaneously achieve high sensitivity and stability, with significant potential for future biosensing applications.\n\nVertical Silicon Nanowire Field Effect Transistors with Nanoscale Gate-All-Around\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGuerfi, Youssouf; Larrieu, Guilhem\n\n2016-04-01\n\nNanowires are considered building blocks for the ultimate scaling of MOS transistors, capable of pushing devices until the most extreme boundaries of miniaturization thanks to their physical and geometrical properties. In particular, nanowires' suitability for forming a gate-all-around (GAA) configuration confers to the device an optimum electrostatic control of the gate over the conduction channel and then a better immunity against the short channel effects (SCE). In this letter, a large-scale process of GAA vertical silicon nanowire (VNW) MOSFETs is presented. A top-down approach is adopted for the realization of VNWs with an optimum reproducibility followed by thin layer engineering at nanoscale. Good overall electrical performances were obtained, with excellent electrostatic behavior (a subthreshold slope (SS) of 95 mV/dec and a drain induced barrier lowering (DIBL) of 25 mV/V) for a 15-nm gate length. Finally, a first demonstration of dual integration of n-type and p-type VNW transistors for the realization of CMOS inverter is proposed.\n\nVoltage-gated proton channel is expressed on phagosomes\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nOkochi, Yoshifumi; Sasaki, Mari; Iwasaki, Hirohide; Okamura, Yasushi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nVoltage-gated proton channel has been suggested to help NADPH oxidase activity during respiratory burst of phagocytes through its activities of compensating charge imbalance and regulation of pH. In phagocytes, robust production of reactive oxygen species occurs in closed membrane compartments, which are called phagosomes. However, direct evidence for the presence of voltage-gated proton channels in phagosome has been lacking. In this study, the expression of voltage-gated proton channels was studied by Western blot with the antibody specific to the voltage-sensor domain protein, VSOP/Hv1, that has recently been identified as the molecular correlate for the voltage-gated proton channel. Phagosomal membranes of neutrophils contain VSOP/Hv1 in accordance with subunits of NADPH oxidases, gp91, p22, p47 and p67. Superoxide anion production upon PMA activation was significantly reduced in neutrophils from VSOP/Hv1 knockout mice. These are consistent with the idea that voltage-gated proton channels help NADPH oxidase in phagocytes to produce reactive oxygen species.\n\nExploring the Short-Channel Characteristics of Asymmetric Junctionless Double-Gate Silicon-on-Nothing MOSFET\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSaha, Priyanka; Banerjee, Pritha; Dash, Dinesh Kumar; Sarkar, Subir Kumar\n\n2018-03-01\n\nThis paper presents an analytical model of an asymmetric junctionless double-gate (asymmetric DGJL) silicon-on-nothing metal-oxide-semiconductor field-effect transistor (MOSFET). Solving the 2-D Poisson's equation, the expressions for center potential and threshold voltage are calculated. In addition, the response of the device toward the various short-channel effects like hot carrier effect, drain-induced barrier lowering and threshold voltage roll-off has also been examined along with subthreshold swing and drain current characteristics. Performance analysis of the present model is also demonstrated by comparing its short-channel behavior with conventional DGJL MOSFET. The effect of variation of the device features due to the variation of device parameters is also studied. The simulated results obtained using 2D device simulator, namely ATLAS, are in good agreement with the analytical results, hence validating our derived model.\n\nDual-gate operation and carrier transport in SiGe p-n junction nanowires\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nDelker, C. J.; Yoo, J. Y.; Bussmann, E.; Swartzentruber, B. S.; Harris, C. T.\n\n2017-11-01\n\nWe investigate carrier transport in silicon-germanium nanowires with an axial p-n junction doping profile by fabricating these wires into transistors that feature separate top gates over each doping segment. By independently biasing each gate, carrier concentrations in the n- and p-side of the wire can be modulated. For these devices, which were fabricated with nickel source-drain electrical contacts, holes are the dominant charge carrier, with more favorable hole injection occurring on the p-side contact. Channel current exhibits greater sensitivity to the n-side gate, and in the reverse biased source-drain configuration, current is limited by the nickel/n-side Schottky contact.\n\nDistinct moieties underlie biphasic H+ gating of connexin43 channels, producing a pH optimum for intercellular communication\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nGarciarena, Carolina D.; Malik, Akif; Swietach, Pawel; Moreno, Alonso P.; Vaughan-Jones, Richard D.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nMost mammalian cells can intercommunicate via connexin-assembled, gap-junctional channels. To regulate signal transmission, connexin (Cx) channel permeability must respond dynamically to physiological and pathophysiological stimuli. One key stimulus is intracellular pH (pHi), which is modulated by a tissueâs metabolic and perfusion status. Our understanding of the molecular mechanism of H+ gating of Cx43 channelsâthe major isoform in the heart and brainâis incomplete. To interrogate the effects of acidic and alkaline pHi on Cx43 channels, we combined voltage-clamp electrophysiology with pHi imaging and photolytic H+ uncaging, performed over a range of pHi values. We demonstrate that Cx43 channels expressed in HeLa or N2a cell pairs are gated biphasically by pHi via a process that consists of activation by H+ ions at alkaline pHi and inhibition at more acidic pHi. For Cx43 channelâmediated solute/ion transmission, the ensemble of these effects produces a pHi optimum, near resting pHi. By using Cx43 mutants, we demonstrate that alkaline gating involves cysteine residues of the C terminus and is independent of motifs previously implicated in acidic gating. Thus, we present a molecular mechanism by which cytoplasmic acidâbase chemistry fine tunes intercellular communication and establishes conditions for the optimal transmission of solutes and signals in tissues, such as the heart and brain.âGarciarena, C.

Using specific antibodies, both receptors were found in Purkinje cells of cerebellum7,8. We have now compared the functional properties of the channels corresponding to the two receptors by incorporating endoplasmic reticulum vesicles from canine cerebellum into planar bilayers. InsP3-gated channels were observed most frequently. Another channel type was activated by adenine nucleotides or caffeine, inhibited by ruthenium red, and modified by ryanodine, characteristics of the ryanodine receptor/channel6. The open probability of both channel types displayed a bell-shaped curve for dependence on calcium. For the InsP3-gated channel, the maximum probability of opening occurred at 0.2 ÂµM free calcium, with sharp decreases on either side of the maximum. Maximum activity for the ryanodine receptor/channel was maintained between 1 and 100 ÂµM calcium. Thus, within the physiological range of cytoplasmic calcium, the InsP3-gated channel itself allows positive feed-back and then negative feedback for calcium release, whereas the ryanodine receptor/channel behaves solely as a calcium-activated channel. The existence in the same cell of two channels with different responses to calcium and different ligand sensitivities provides a basis for complex patterns of intracellular calcium regulation.\n\nNon-basic amino acids in the ROMK1 channels via an appropriate distance modulate PIP2 regulated pHi-gating.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLee, Chien-Hsing; Huang, Po-Tsang; Liou, Horng-Huei; Lin, Mei-Ying; Lou, Kuo-Long; Chen, Chung-Yi\n\n2016-04-22\n\nThe ROMK1 (Kir1.1) channel activity is predominantly regulated by intracellular pH (pHi) and phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2). Although several residues were reported to be involved in the regulation of pHi associated with PIP2 interaction, the detailed molecular mechanism remains unclear. We perform experiments in ROMK1 pHi-gating with electrophysiology combined with mutational and structural analysis. In the present study, non basic residues of C-terminal region (S219, N215, I192, L216 and L220) in ROMK1 channels have been found to mediate channel-PIP2 interaction and pHi gating. Further, our structural results show these residues with an appropriate distance to interact with membrane PIP2. Meanwhile, a cluster of basic residues (R188, R217 and K218), which was previously discovered regarding the interaction with PIP2, exists in this appropriate distance to discriminate the regulation of channel-PIP2 interaction and pHi-gating. This appropriate distance can be observed with high conservation in the Kir channel family. Our results provide insight that an appropriate distance cooperates with the electrostatics interaction of channel-PIP2 to regulate pHi-gating. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The oriented 1-Î¼m-long silicon nanowires with the diameter of about 50 nm were vertically synthesized by the electroless metal deposition method at room temperature and were sequentially capped with the ZnO films using atomic layer deposition at 50 Â°C. The transfer characteristics (I DS âV REF ) of such ZnO/silicon nanowire EGFET sensor exhibited the sensitivity and linearity of 46.25 mV/pH and 0.9902, respectively for the different pH solutions (pH 1âpH 13). In contrast to the ZnO thin-film ones, the ZnO/silicon nanowire EGFET sensor achieved much better sensitivity and superior linearity. It was attributed to a high surface-to-volume ratio of the nanowire structures, reflecting a larger effective sensing area. The output voltage and time characteristics were also measured to indicate good reliability and durability for the ZnO/silicon nanowires sensor.

Intracellular acidification reversibly closes the Kir1.1 channel and thus decreases K+ secretion. In this study, we used Foster resonance energy transfer (FRET) to determine whether the conformation of the cytoplasmic pore changes in response to intracellular pH (pHi)-gating in Kir1.1 channels fused with enhanced cyan fluorescent protein (ECFP) and enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (EYFP) (ECFP-Kir1.1-EYFP). Because the fluorescence intensities of ECFP and EYFP were affected at pHi pHi-gating occurs in the ECFP-Kir1.1-EYFP construct, we examined the FRET efficiencies of an ECFP-S219R-EYFP mutant, which is completed closed at pHi 7.4 and open at pHi 10.0. FRET efficiency was increased from 25% to 40% when the pHi was decreased from 10.0 to 7.4. These results suggest that the conformation of the cytoplasmic pore in the Kir1.1 channel changes in response to pHi gating such that the N- and C-termini move apart from each other at pHi 7.4, when the channel is open.\n\nDual Gating Mechanism and Function of P2X7 Receptor Channels\n\nCzech Academy of Sciences Publication Activity Database\n\nKhadra, A.; Tomic, M.; Yan, Z.; ZemkovÃ¡, Hana; Sherman, A.; Stojilkovic, S.

Predicting the impacts of ocean acidification on coccolithophore calcification has received much recent attention and requires improved knowledge of cellular calcification mechanisms. Uniquely amongst calcifying organisms, coccolithophores produce calcified scales (coccoliths in an intracellular compartment and secrete them to the cell surface, requiring large transcellular ionic fluxes to support calcification. In particular, intracellular calcite precipitation using HCOââ» as the substrate generates equimolar quantities of H+ that must be rapidly removed to prevent cytoplasmic acidification. We have used electrophysiological approaches to identify a plasma membrane voltage-gated H+ conductance in Coccolithus pelagicus ssp braarudii with remarkably similar biophysical and functional properties to those found in metazoans. We show that both C. pelagicus and Emiliania huxleyi possess homologues of metazoan H(v1 H+ channels, which function as voltage-gated H+ channels when expressed in heterologous systems. Homologues of the coccolithophore H+ channels were also identified in a diversity of eukaryotes, suggesting a wide range of cellular roles for the H(v1 class of proteins. Using single cell imaging, we demonstrate that the coccolithophore H+ conductance mediates rapid H+ efflux and plays an important role in pH homeostasis in calcifying cells. The results demonstrate a novel cellular role for voltage gated H+ channels and provide mechanistic insight into biomineralisation by establishing a direct link between pH homeostasis and calcification. As the coccolithophore H+ conductance is dependent on the trans-membrane H+ electrochemical gradient, this mechanism will be directly impacted by, and may underlie adaptation to, ocean acidification. The presence of this H+ efflux pathway suggests that there is no obligate\n\nDevelopment of III-V p-MOSFETs with high-kappa gate stack for future CMOS applications\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNagaiah, Padmaja\n\nAs the semiconductor industry approaches the limits of traditional silicon CMOS scaling, non-silicon materials and new device architectures are gradually being introduced to improve Si integrated circuit performance and continue transistor scaling. Recently, the replacement of SiO2 with a high-k material (HfO2) as gate dielectric has essentially removed one of the biggest advantages of Si as channel material. As a result, alternate high mobility materials are being considered to replace Si in the channel to achieve higher drive currents and switching speeds. III-V materials in particular have become of great interest as channel materials, owing to their superior electron transport properties. However, there are several critical challenges that need to be addressed before III-V based CMOS can replace Si CMOS technology. Some of these challenges include development of a high quality, thermally stable gate dielectric/III-V interface, and improvement in III-V p-channel hole mobility to complement the n-channel mobility, low source/drain resistance and integration onto Si substrate. In this thesis, we would be addressing the first two issues i.e. the development high performance III-V p-channels and obtaining high quality III-V/high-k interface. We start with using the device architecture of the already established InGaAs n-channels as a baseline to understand the effect of remote scattering from the high-k oxide and oxide/semiconductor interface on channel transport properties such as electron mobility and channel electron concentration. Temperature dependent Hall electron mobility measurements were performed to separate various scattering induced mobility limiting factors. Dependence of channel mobility on proximity of the channel to the oxide interface, oxide thickness, annealing conditions are discussed. The results from this work will be used in the design of the p-channel MOSFETs. Following this, InxGa1-xAs (x>0.53) is chosen as channel material for developing p-channel\n\nP-channel differential multiple-time programmable memory cells by laterally coupled floating metal gate fin field-effect transistors\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nWang, Tai-Min; Chien, Wei-Yu; Hsu, Chia-Ling; Lin, Chrong Jung; King, Ya-Chin\n\n2018-04-01\n\nIn this paper, we present a new differential p-channel multiple-time programmable (MTP) memory cell that is fully compatible with advanced 16 nm CMOS fin field-effect transistors (FinFET) logic processes. This differential MTP cell stores complementary data in floating gates coupled by a slot contact structure, which make different read currents possible on a single cell. In nanoscale CMOS FinFET logic processes, the gate dielectric layer becomes too thin to retain charges inside floating gates for nonvolatile data storage. By using a differential architecture, the sensing window of the cell can be extended and maintained by an advanced blanket boost scheme. The charge retention problem in floating gate cells can be improved by periodic restoring lost charges when significant read window narrowing occurs. In addition to high programming efficiency, this p-channel MTP cells also exhibit good cycling endurance as well as disturbance immunity. The blanket boost scheme can remedy the charge loss problem under thin gate dielectrics.\n\nStudy of strained-Si p-channel MOSFETs with HfO2 gate dielectric\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nPradhan, Diana; Das, Sanghamitra; Dash, Tara Prasanna\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn this work, the transconductance of strained-Si p-MOSFETs with high-K dielectric (HfO2) as gate oxide, has been presented through simulation using the TCAD tool Silvaco-ATLAS. The results have been compared with a SiO2/strained-Si p-MOSFET device. Peak transconductance enhancement factors of 2.97 and 2.73 has been obtained for strained-Si p-MOSFETs in comparison to bulk Si channel p-MOSFETs with SiO2 and high-K dielectric respectively. This behavior is in good agreement with the reported experimental results. The transconductance of the strained-Si device at low temperatures has also been simulated. As expected, the mobility and hence the transconductance increases at lower temperatures due to reduced phonon scattering. However, the enhancements with high-K gate dielectric is less as compared to that with SiO2.\n\nDevelopment and characterization of vertical double-gate MOS field-effect transistors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nTrellenkamp, S.\n\n2004-07-01\n\nPlanar MOS-field-effect transistors are common devices today used by the computer industry. When their miniaturization reaches its limit, alternate transistor concepts become necessary. In this thesis the development of vertical Double-Gate-MOS-field-effect transistors is presented. These types of transistors have a vertically aligned p-n-p junction (or n-p-n junction, respectively). Consequently, the source-drain current flows perpendicular with respect to the surface of the wafer. A Double-Gate-field-effect transistor is characterized by a very thin channel region framed by two parallel gates. Due to the symmetry of the structure and less bulk volume better gate control and hence better short channel behavior is expected, as well as an improved scaling potential. Nanostructuring of the transistor's active region is very challenging. Approximately 300 nm high and down to 30 nm wide silicon ridges are requisite. They can be realized using hydrogen silsesquioxane (HSQ) as inorganic high resolution resist for electron beam lithography. Structures defined in HSQ are then transferred with high anisotropy and selectivity into silicon using ICP-RIE (reactive ion etching with inductive coupled plasma). 25 nm wide and 330 nm high silicon ridges are achieved. Different transistor layouts are realized. The channel length is defined by epitaxial growth of doped silicon layers before or by ion implantation after nanostructuring, respectively. The transistors show source-drain currents up to 380 Î¼A/Î¼m and transconductances up to 480 Î¼S/Î¼m. Improved short channel behavior for decreasing width of the silicon ridges is demonstrated.

They help maintain and regulate the potassium ion-based component of the membrane potential and are thus central to many critical physiological processes. VKCDB (Voltage-gated potassium [K] Channel DataBase is a database of structural and functional data on these channels. It is designed as a resource for research on the molecular basis of voltage-gated potassium channel function. Description Voltage-gated potassium channel sequences were identified by using BLASTP to search GENBANK and SWISSPROT. Annotations for all voltage-gated potassium channels were selectively parsed and integrated into VKCDB. Electrophysiological and pharmacological data for the channels were collected from published journal articles. Transmembrane domain predictions by TMHMM and PHD are included for each VKCDB entry. Multiple sequence alignments of conserved domains of channels of the four Kv families and the KCNQ family are also included. Currently VKCDB contains 346 channel entries. It can be browsed and searched using a set of functionally relevant categories. Protein sequences can also be searched using a local BLAST engine. Conclusions VKCDB is a resource for comparative studies of voltage-gated potassium channels. The methods used to construct VKCDB are general; they can be used to create specialized databases for other protein families. VKCDB is accessible at http://vkcdb.biology.ualberta.ca.\n\nInvestigation of silicon width (p, p') resonance scattering in left angle 110 right angle channeling direction\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nDitroi, F.; Meyer, J.D.; Michelmann, R.; Kislat, D.; Bethge, K.\n\n1994-01-01\n\nCrystalline silicon samples were investigated both in channeling and random directions by using the (p, p') resonance scattering at 2.3 MeV bombarding energy. The samples were positioned in the scattering chamber of a VdG accelerator after 2 m collimating path. The peaks due to the resonance at 2.1 MeV were measured at different angles in the vicinity of the channeling and random directions. A peak shift and broadening was seen at the channeling and near channeling directions compared with the random one. The spectra were also simulated using our modified Monte Carlo calculation method for stopping, range and energy distribution in highly ordered materials. The energy shift and the broadening between the random and the channeling spectra were compared and explained.

We have identified, via channel mutagenesis and x-ray crystallography, two pH-sensing amino acids and a set of nearby residues involved in molecular interactions that influence gating. We found that the minimal mutation of one histidine (H25) and one glutamate (E118) near the cytoplasmic gate completely abolished pH-dependent gating. Mutation of nearby residues either alone or in pairs altered the channelâs response to pH. In addition, mutations of certain pairs of residues dramatically increased the energy barriers between the closed and open states. We proposed a MonodâWymanâChangeux model for proton binding and pH-dependent gating in KcsA, where H25 is a âstrongâ sensor displaying a large shift in pKa between closed and open states, and E118 is a âweakâ pH sensor. Modifying model parameters that are involved in either the intrinsic gating equilibrium or the pKa values of the pH-sensing residues was sufficient to capture the effects of all mutations.

J.; Shokrani, M.\n\n1991-01-01\n\nA novel gate insulator consisting of silicon dioxide (SiO2) with a thin silicon (Si) interfacial layer has been investigated for high-power microwave indium phosphide (InP) metal-insulator-semiconductor field effect transistors (MISFETs). The role of the silicon interfacial layer on the chemical nature of the SiO2/Si/InP interface was studied by high-resolution X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The results indicated that the silicon interfacial layer reacted with the native oxide at the InP surface, thus producing silicon dioxide, while reducing the native oxide which has been shown to be responsible for the instabilities in InP MISFETs. While a 1.2-V hysteresis was present in the capacitance-voltage (C-V) curve of the MIS capacitors with silicon dioxide, less than 0.1 V hysteresis was observed in the C-V curve of the capacitors with the silicon interfacial layer incorporated in the insulator. InP MISFETs fabricated with the silicon dioxide in combination with the silicon interfacial layer exhibited excellent stability with drain current drift of less than 3 percent in 10,000 sec, as compared to 15-18 percent drift in 10,000 sec for devices without the silicon interfacial layer. High-power microwave InP MISFETs with Si/SiO2 gate insulators resulted in an output power density of 1.75 W/mm gate width at 9.7 GHz, with an associated power gain of 2.5 dB and 24 percent power added efficiency.\n\nA single amino acid gates the KcsA channel\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nHirano, Minako; Okuno, Daichi; Onishi, Yukiko; Ide, Toru\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHighlights: â¢ pH-dependent gating of the KcsA channel is regulated by the CPD. â¢ E146 is the most essential amino acid for pH sensing by the KcsA. â¢ The protonated-mimicking mutant, E146Q, is constitutively open independent of pH. â¢ Minimal rearrangement of the CPD is sufficient for opening of the KcsA. - Abstract: The KcsA channel is a proton-activated potassium channel.

However, the conformational dynamics and structural rearrangements that underlie gating and allosteric modulation remain poorly understood. We used a combination of electrophysiology, double electronâelectron resonance (DEER) spectroscopy, and x-ray crystallography to investigate activation mechanisms in a novel functional chimera with the extracellular domain (ECD) of amine-gated Erwinia chrysanthemi ligandâgated ion channel, which is activated by primary amines, and the transmembrane domain of Gloeobacter violaceus ligandâgated ion channel, which is activated by protons. We found that the chimera was independently gated by primary amines and by protons. The crystal structure of the chimera in its resting state, at pH 7.0 and in the absence of primary amines, revealed a closed-pore conformation and an ECD that is twisted with respect to the transmembrane region. Amine- and pH-induced conformational changes measured by DEER spectroscopy showed that the chimera exhibits a dual mode of gating that preserves the distinct conformational changes of the parent channels. Collectively, our findings shed light on both conserved and divergent features of gating mechanisms in this class of channels, and will facilitate the design of better allosteric modulators.

HV 1 has been identified in a wide range of eukaryotes throughout the animal kingdom, with the exception of insects. Therefore, it has been proposed that insects do not possess an HV 1 channel. In the present study, we report the existence of an HV 1-type proton channel in insects. We searched insect transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) sequence databases and found putative HV 1 orthologues in various polyneopteran insects. To confirm that these putative HV 1 orthologues were functional channels, we studied the HV 1 channel of Nicoletia phytophila (NpHV 1), an insect of the Zygentoma order, in more detail. NpHV 1 comprises 239 amino acids and is 33% identical to the human voltage-gated proton channel 1. Patch clamp measurements in a heterologous expression system showed proton selectivity, as well as pH- and voltage-dependent gating. Interestingly, NpHV 1 shows slightly enhanced pH-dependent gating compared to the human channel. Mutations in the first transmembrane segment at position 66 (Asp66), the presumed selectivity filter, lead to a loss of proton-selective conduction, confirming the importance of this aspartate residue in voltage-gated proton channels.

Usually, large protein tails are attached to this core, hanging toward the inside of the cell. These cytoplasmic regions are essential for normal channel function and, due to their accessibility to the cytoplasmic environment, constitute obvious targets for cell-physiological control of channel behavior. Here we review the present knowledge about the molecular organization of these intracellular channel regions and their role in both setting and controlling Kv voltage-dependent gating properties. This includes the influence that they exert on Kv rapid/N-type inactivation and on activation/deactivation gating of Shaker-like and eag-type Kv channels. Some illustrative examples about the relevance of these cytoplasmic domains determining the possibilities for modulation of Kv channel gating by cellular components are also considered.

The discovery of these channels began with predictions made by early pioneers, and has culminated in their extensive functional and structural characterization by electrophysiological, spectroscopic, and crystallographic studies. With the aid of a variety of crystal structures of these channels, a highly detailed picture emerges of how the voltage-sensing domain reports changes in the membrane electric field and couples this to conformational changes in the activation gate. In addition, high-resolution structural and functional studies of K+ channel pores, such as KcsA and MthK, offer a comprehensive picture on how selectivity is achieved in K+ channels. Here, we illustrate the remarkable features of voltage-gated potassium channels and explain the mechanisms used by these machines with experimental data.

NIDOS films with varied nitrogen content have been boron implanted, then annealed and finally analysed by secondary ion mass spectroscopy (SIMS). In order to simulate the experimental SIMS of boron concentration profiles in the NIDOS films, a model adapted to the particular conditions of the samples elaboration, i.e. the very high boron concentration and the nitrogen content, has been established. The boron diffusion reduction in NIDOS films with increasing nitrogen rates has been evidenced by the profiles as well as by the obtained diffusion coefficients, which shows that the nitrogen incorporation reduces the boron diffusion. This has been confirmed by capacitance-voltage (C-V) measurements performed on MOS capacitors: the higher the nitrogen content, the lower the flat-band voltage. Finally, these results demonstrate that the improvement of the gate oxide quality occurs with the suppression of the boron penetration.\n\nOpening of K+ channels by capacitive stimulation from silicon chip\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUlbrich, M. H.; Fromherz, P.\n\n2005-10-01\n\nThe development of stable neuroelectronic systems requires a stimulation of nerve cells from semiconductor devices without electrochemical effects at the electrolyte/solid interface and without damage of the cell membrane. The interaction must rely on a reversible opening of voltage-gated ion channels by capacitive coupling. In a proof-of-principle experiment, we demonstrate that Kv1.3 potassium channels expressed in HEK293 cells can be opened from an electrolyte/oxide/silicon (EOS) capacitor. A sufficient strength of electrical coupling is achieved by insulating silicon with a thin film of TiO2 to achieve a high capacitance and by removing NaCl from the electrolyte to enhance the resistance of the cell-chip contact. When a decaying voltage ramp is applied to the EOS capacitor, an outward current through the attached cell membrane is observed that is specific for Kv1.3 channels. An open probability up to fifty percent is estimated by comparison with a numerical simulation of the cell-chip contact.\n\nVoltageÂ gating of mechanosensitive PIEZO channels.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMoroni, Mirko; Servin-Vences, M Rocio; Fleischer, Raluca; SÃ¡nchez-Carranza, Oscar; Lewin, Gary R\n\n2018-03-15\n\nMechanosensitive PIEZO ion channels are evolutionarily conserved proteins whose presence is critical for normal physiology in multicellular organisms. Here we show that, in addition to mechanical stimuli, PIEZO channels are also powerfully modulated by voltage and can even switch to a purely voltage-gated mode. Mutations that cause human diseases, such as xerocytosis, profoundly shift voltage sensitivity of PIEZO1 channels toward the resting membrane potential and strongly promote voltage gating. Voltage modulation may be explained by the presence of an inactivation gate in the pore, the opening of which is promoted by outward permeation. Older invertebrate (fly) and vertebrate (fish) PIEZO proteins are also voltage sensitive, but voltage gating is a much more prominent feature of these older channels. We propose that the voltage sensitivity of PIEZO channels is a deep property co-opted to add a regulatory mechanism for PIEZO activation in widely different cellular contexts.\n\nDopant induced single electron tunneling within the sub-bands of single silicon NW tri-gate junctionless n-MOSFET\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nUddin, Wasi; Georgiev, Yordan M.; Maity, Sarmistha; Das, Samaresh\n\n2017-09-01\n\nWe report 1D electron transport of silicon junctionless tri-gate n-type transistor at 4.2âK. The step like curve observed in the current voltage characteristic suggests 1D transport. Besides the current steps for 1D transport, we found multiple spikes within individual steps, which we relate to inter-band single electron tunneling, mediated by the charged dopants available in the channel region. Clear Coulomb diamonds were observed in the stability diagram of the device. It is shown that a uniformly doped silicon nanowire can provide us the window for the single electron tunnelling. Back-gate versus front-gate color plot, where current is in a color scale, shows a crossover of the increased conduction region. This is a clear indication of the dopant-dopant interaction. It has been shown that back-gate biasing can be used to tune the coupling strength between the dopants.\n\nEffects of Voltage-Gated K+ Channel on Cell Proliferation in Multiple Myeloma\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nWei Wang\n\n2014-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Objective.

In addition, the response of the proposed device towards aggressive downscaling, that is, its extent of immunity towards the different short-channel effects, has also been considered in this work.

In voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels, much of our knowledge in this area comes from Shaker-type channels, for which voltage-dependent gating is quite rapid. In these channels, activation and deactivation are associated with rapid reconfiguration of the voltage-sensing domain unit that is electromechanically coupled, via the S4âS5 linker helix, to the rate-limiting opening of an intracellular pore gate. However, fast voltage-dependent gating kinetics are not typical of all Kv channels, such as Kv11.1 (human ether-Ã -go-go related gene, hERG), which activates and deactivates very slowly. Compared to Shaker channels, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying slow hERG gating is much poorer. Here, we present a comparative review of the structureâfunction relationships underlying activation and deactivation gating in Shaker and hERG channels, with a focus on the roles of the voltage-sensing domain and the S4âS5 linker that couples voltage sensor movements to the pore. Measurements of gating current kinetics and fluorimetric analysis of voltage sensor movement are consistent with models suggesting that the hERG activation pathway contains a voltage independent step, which limits voltage sensor transitions. Constraints upon hERG voltage sensor movement may result from loose packing of the S4 helices and additional intra-voltage sensor counter-charge interactions. More recent data suggest that key amino acid differences in the hERG voltage-sensing unit and S4âS5 linker, relative to fast activating Shaker-type Kv channels, may also contribute to the increased stability of the resting state of the voltage sensor.

They are found in diverse species, from unicellular marine life to humans. In all cells, their function requires that they open and conduct current only under certain conditions, typically when the electrochemical gradient for protons is outwards. Consequently, these proteins behave like rectifiers, conducting protons out of cells. Their activity has electrical consequences and also changes the pH on both sides of the membrane. Here we summarize what is known about the way these proteins sense the membrane potential and the pH inside and outside the cell. Currently, it is hypothesized that membrane potential is sensed by permanently charged arginines (with very high p K a ) within the protein, which results in parts of the protein moving to produce a conduction pathway. The mechanism of pH sensing appears to involve titratable side chains of particular amino acids. For this purpose their p K a needs to be within the operational pH range. We propose a 'counter-charge' model for pH sensing in which electrostatic interactions within the protein are selectively disrupted by protonation of internally or externally accessible groups.

This opens opportunities for the incorporation of materials with intrinsically better transport characteristics. An alloy of silicon and germanium is one such material that is gaining much recognition as the active component of MOSFETs and as the secondary structures (such as the gate electrode). This work examines a batch of buried channel Si 0.64 Ge 0.36 p-MOSFETs, with a minimum effective length of 0.35 Î¼m, under different bias conditions and at different temperatures. High current and transconductance enhancements are apparent at long gate lengths. The carrier mobility is up to a factor of 2.5 times that of silicon at room temperature and 7.5 times at 4 K. A clear trend of decreasing peak mobility with decreasing silicon cap thickness is evident. Simulations show that scattering caused by the roughness of the SiO 2 /Si interface dominates, rather than alloy scattering or Si/SiGe roughness, even for a buried channel. This scattering increases with the proximity of the carriers to the interface. An increase of interface trap density with decreasing cap thickness, demonstrates that segregated germanium exists some distance into the cap and interferes with the oxidation process. This will increase scattering through increased SiO 2 /Si roughness and increased trapped charge. The short channel, high field results are comparable or slightly worse than those of silicon due to lower saturation drift velocity. However, fitting to a drift-diffusion model shows an apparent increase in saturation velocity for short channels, especially at low temperatures. This effect correlates with the low field mobility and is greater for devices containing SiGe. This is an indication of velocity overshoot, which may enhance the performance of SiGe MOSFETs at deep submicron gate lengths.

In this paper, we introduce a simple method to fabricate FET silicon nanowires using only standard microelectromechanical system (MEMS) processes. The key steps of our fabrication process were a local oxidation of silicon (LOCOS) and anisotropic KOH etchings that enabled us to reduce the width of the initial silicon structures from 10 Âµm to 170 nm. To turn the nanowires into a FET, a top-gate electrode was patterned in gold next to them in order to apply the gate voltage directly through the investigated liquid environment. An electrical characterization demonstrated the p-type behaviour of the nanowires. Preliminary chemical sensing tested the sensitivity to pH of our device. The effect of the binding of streptavidin on biotinylated nanowires was monitored in order to evaluate their biosensing ability. In this way, streptavidin was detected down to a 100 ng mL â1 concentration in phosphate buffered saline by applying a gate voltage less than 1.2 V. The use of a top-gate electrode enabled the detection of biological species with only very low voltages that were compatible with future handheld-requiring applications. We thus demonstrated the potential of our devices and their fabrication as a solution for the mass production of efficient and reliable FET nanowire-based biological sensors\n\nHigh Sensitivity pH Sensor Based on Porous Silicon (PSi Extended Gate Field-Effect Transistor\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNaif H.

In spite of its FD-SOI nanoscale thickness and long channel feature, the device has surprisingly exhibited a Drain-Induced Barrier Lowering (DIBL effect at RT. However, this effect was suppressed at 77âK. If the apparition of such anomalous effect can be explained by a parasitic short channel transistor located at the edges of the channel, its suppression is explained by the decrease of the potential barrier between the drain and the channel when lowering the temperature.\n\nAn analytic model for gate-all-around silicon nanowire tunneling field effect transistors\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nLiu Ying; He Jin; Chan Mansun; Ye Yun; Zhao Wei; Wu Wen; Deng Wan-Ling; Wang Wen-Ping; Du Cai-Xia\n\n2014-01-01\n\nAn analytical model of gate-all-around (GAA) silicon nanowire tunneling field effect transistors (NW-TFETs) is developted based on the surface potential solutions in the channel direction and considering the band to band tunneling (BTBT) efficiency. The three-dimensional Poisson equation is solved to obtain the surface potential distributions in the partition regions along the channel direction for the NW-TFET, and a tunneling current model using Kane's expression is developed. The validity of the developed model is shown by the good agreement between the model predictions and the TCAD simulation results.

As such, they are essential components of neuromuscular and neuronal systems, and are targeted by toxins from a wide variety of phyla, including the cnidarians.

Palythoa caribaeorum is a zoanthid commonly found around the Mexican coastline. In this study, we tested the activity of P. caribaeorum venom on voltage-gated sodium channel (NaV1.7), voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV2.2), the A-type transient outward (IA) and delayed rectifier (IDR) currents of KV channels of the superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons of the rat. These results showed that the venom reversibly delays the inactivation process of voltage-gated sodium channels and inhibits voltage-gated calcium and potassium channels in this mammalian model. The compounds responsible for these effects seem to be low molecular weight peptides. Together, these results provide evidence for the potential use of zoanthids as a novel source of cnidarian toxins active on voltage-gated ion channels.\n\nVoltage-Gated Proton Channels: Molecular Biology, Physiology, and Pathophysiology of the HV Family\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2013-01-01\n\nVoltage-gated proton channels (HV) are unique, in part because the ion they conduct is unique. HV channels are perfectly selective for protons and have a very small unitary conductance, both arguably manifestations of the extremely low H+ concentration in physiological solutions. They open with membrane depolarization, but their voltage dependence is strongly regulated by the pH gradient across the membrane (ÎpH), with the result that in most species they normally conduct only outward current. The HV channel protein is strikingly similar to the voltage-sensing domain (VSD, the first four membrane-spanning segments) of voltage-gated K+ and Na+ channels. In higher species, HV channels exist as dimers in which each protomer has its own conduction pathway, yet gating is cooperative. HV channels are phylogenetically diverse, distributed from humans to unicellular marine life, and perhaps even plants. Correspondingly, HV functions vary widely as well, from promoting calcification in coccolithophores and triggering bioluminescent flashes in dinoflagellates to facilitating killing bacteria, airway pH regulation, basophil histamine release, sperm maturation, and B lymphocyte responses in humans. Recent evidence that hHV1 may exacerbate breast cancer metastasis and cerebral damage from ischemic stroke highlights the rapidly expanding recognition of the clinical importance of hHV1.

After initial amplification within the phototransduction cascade the signal is translated into an electrical signal by the action of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNG channels. CNG channels are ligand-gated ion channels that are activated by the binding of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP or cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP. Retinal CNG channels transduce changes in intracellular concentrations of cGMP into changes of the membrane potential and the Ca2+ concentration. Structurally, the CNG channels belong to the superfamily of pore-loop cation channels and share a common gross structure with hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN channels and voltage-gated potassium channels (KCN. In this review, we provide an overview on the molecular properties of CNG channels and describe their physiological role in the phototransduction pathways. We also discuss insights into the pathophysiological role of CNG channel proteins that have emerged from the analysis of CNG channel-deficient animal models and human CNG channelopathies. Finally, we summarize recent gene therapy activities and provide an outlook for future clinical application.\n\nVoltage-dependent gating in a \"voltage sensor-less\" ion channel.\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHarley T Kurata\n\n2010-02-01\n\nFull Text Available The voltage sensitivity of voltage-gated cation channels is primarily attributed to conformational changes of a four transmembrane segment voltage-sensing domain, conserved across many levels of biological complexity. We have identified a remarkable point mutation that confers significant voltage dependence to Kir6.2, a ligand-gated channel that lacks any canonical voltage-sensing domain. Similar to voltage-dependent Kv channels, the Kir6.2[L157E] mutant exhibits time-dependent activation upon membrane depolarization, resulting in an outwardly rectifying current-voltage relationship. This voltage dependence is convergent with the intrinsic ligand-dependent gating mechanisms of Kir6.2, since increasing the membrane PIP2 content saturates Po and eliminates voltage dependence, whereas voltage activation is more dramatic when channel Po is reduced by application of ATP or poly-lysine. These experiments thus demonstrate an inherent voltage dependence of gating in a \"ligand-gated\" K+ channel, and thereby provide a new view of voltage-dependent gating mechanisms in ion channels. Most interestingly, the voltage- and ligand-dependent gating of Kir6.2[L157E] is highly sensitive to intracellular [K+], indicating an interaction between ion permeation and gating. While these two key features of channel function are classically dealt with separately, the results provide a framework for understanding their interaction, which is likely to be a general, if latent, feature of the superfamily of cation channels.\n\nAn analytical threshold voltage model for a short-channel dual-metal-gate (DMG) recessed-source/drain (Re-S/D) SOI MOSFET\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSaramekala, G.

For the first time, the advantages of recessed source/drain (Re-S/D) and of dual-metal-gate structure are incorporated simultaneously in a fully depleted SOI MOSFET. The analytical surface potential model at Si-channel/SiO2 interface and Si-channel/buried-oxide (BOX) interface have been developed by solving the 2-D Poissonâs equation in the channel region with appropriate boundary conditions assuming parabolic potential profile in the transverse direction of the channel. Thereupon, a threshold voltage model is derived from the minimum surface potential in the channel. The developed model is analyzed extensively for a variety of device parameters like the oxide and silicon channel thicknesses, thickness of source/drain extension in the BOX, control and screen gate length ratio.

Notwithstanding advances from recent bacterial NaV (BacNaV) structures, key questions about gating and ion selectivity remain. Here, we present a closed conformation of NaVAe1p, a pore-only BacNaV derived from NaVAe1, a BacNaV from the arsenite oxidizer Alkalilimnicola ehrlichei found in Mono Lake, California, that provides insight into both fundamental properties. The structure reveals a pore domain in which the pore-lining S6 helix connects to a helical cytoplasmic tail. Electrophysiological studies of full-length BacNaVs show that two elements defined by the NaVAe1p structure, an S6 activation gate position and the cytoplasmic tail \"neck\", are central to BacNaV gating. The structure also reveals the selectivity filter ion entry site, termed the \"outer ion\" site. Comparison with mammalian voltage-gated calcium channel (CaV) selectivity filters, together with functional studies, shows that this site forms a previously unknown determinant of CaV high-affinity calcium binding. Our findings underscore commonalities between BacNaVs and eukaryotic voltage-gated channels and provide a framework for understanding gating and ion permeation in this superfamily. Â© 2013.

Emerging evidence indicates that the voltage-operated model is shared by some other transmembrane proteins expressed in both excitable and non-excitable cells. In this review, we summarize current knowledge about voltage-operated proteins, which are not classic voltage-gated ion channels as well as the voltage-dependent processes in cells for which single voltage-sensitive proteins have yet to be identified. Particularly, we will focus on the following. (1) Voltage-sensitive phosphoinositide phosphatases (VSP) with four transmembrane segments homologous to the voltage sensor domain (VSD) of voltage-gated ion channels; VSPs are the first family of proteins, other than the voltage-gated ion channels, for which there is sufficient evidence for the existence of the VSD domain; (2) Voltage-gated proton channels comprising of a single voltage-sensing domain and lacking an identified pore domain; (3) G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) that mediate the depolarization-evoked potentiation of Ca 2+ mobilization; (4) Plasma membrane (PM) depolarization-induced but Ca 2+ -independent exocytosis in neurons. (5) Voltage-dependent metabolism of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns[4,5]P 2 , PIP 2 ) in the PM.

To achieve this goal, both p- and n-type SGNAFETs with a channel thicknesses of 2 or 4 nm were fabricated, and the stable transistor operation of both SGNAFETs in air, water, and a KCl buffer solution were confirmed. In addition, synchronized current changes were observed between the ionic current through the nanopore and the SGNAFETâs drain current during DNA translocation through the nanopore.

In addition to its structural role, it regulates the fluidity and raft structure of the membrane and influences the course of numerous membrane-linked signaling pathways and the function of transmembrane proteins, including ion channels. This is supported by a vast body of scientific data, which demonstrates the modulation of ion channels with a great variety of ion selectivity, gating, and tissue distribution by changes in membrane cholesterol. Here, we review what is currently known about the modulation of voltage-gated K + (Kv) channels by changes in membrane cholesterol content, considering raft association of the channels, the roles of cholesterol recognition sites, and those of adaptor proteins in cholesterol-Kv channel interactions. We specifically focus on Kv1.3, the dominant K + channel of human T cells. Effects of cholesterol depletion and enrichment and 7-dehydrocholesterol enrichment on Kv1.3 gating are discussed in the context of the immunological synapse and the comparison of the in vitro effects of sterol modifications on Kv1.3 function with ex vivo effects on cells from hypercholesterolemic and Smith-Lemli-Opitz patients.
