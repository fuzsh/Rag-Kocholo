        "meta_description": "Seven years later, you can't merely port a game to the Nintendo Wii, add one new gameplay mode (the lame Gladiator mode), and charge people money for that. Ethically, that's wrong. Tecmo should have put a little note on the inside of the instruction booklet that begins, &quot;Congratulations, Sucker.&quot;\r  \r  Tecmo obviously isn't the only developer/publisher attempting to cash in on the Wii's runaway success by releasing half-assed ports from its back catalogue. But The Battle for Argus is one of the most egregious examples of that behavior Crispy Gamer has seen.",

I'm glad someone's giving it the attention it deserves.\n\nXtraTrstrL4066d ago\n\nWell it wasn't forgotten, in 2002 they made a 3D PS2 Rygar: The Legendary Adventure. I owned this original one though, and it was a very cool metroidvania game. It was weird, how it'd be a top-down game in certain areas, then go to the sidescrolling in others. The music was always very memorable. They need to make another sequel, but in this same metroidvania style. If I remember correctly the PS2 game was just level based. This was a great game overall."
