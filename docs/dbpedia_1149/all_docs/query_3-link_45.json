        "text": "The post-apocalypse is a narrative context that focuses on the destruction and rebirth of civilization, society, and culture. Familiar signs are mixed with the unfamiliar to create something new, a unique post-apocalyptic Other as the decontextualization, recontextualization, and resignification of sound breed new possibilities for identity. Videogames allow players to explore this new identity as an expressly interactive and immersive medium, while eclectic digital music embodies and communicates this identity within the medium in ways that it cannot in others. In this work, I analyze the musical approaches in three post-apocalyptic videogames, Borderlands, Bastion, and Fallout 3. In these games, the eclectic musical approach aims to evoke an ambiguity and originality achieved through digital production using synthetic and instrumental sounds found in sound library software. Also, pre-existing music from a specific time period is recontextualized in the futuristic post-apocalypse, establishing a temporal Other through temporal displacement. Both are possible due to the global digital database, a growing, easily accessed digital archive epitomized in sound library software and digital composition. It is in this database and through the use of technology that sound becomes a simulacrum of its former self, and the barrier created by terms like “Western” and “non-Western” decays. The virtual Othering in these three games draws attention to the value of sound in music-making and, consequently, to the redirection of meaning in musical sound and the virtual world.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to delineate the contents of the music concepts and skills charts for grades kindergarten through six of the Richardson Independent School District in Texas into six 6-week instruction periods for the school year based upon a logical and effective sequence. The Richardson ISD music concepts and skills charts organize musical learning into eight categories: Rhythm and Meter, Melody, Vocal Development, Instrument Skills, Movement and Singing Games, Listening and Timbre, Expressive Elements, and Form. In order to delineate the contents of the yearly charts, the study posed eight research questions, each of which sought to determine a sequence for introducing concepts and skills in one of the eight categories. To develop an appropriate sequence for introducing concepts and skills in each category, a review of literature examined existing research and related pedagogical literature authored by experts in the field of elementary music education. The sequence found in the district’s adopted textbook series, Spotlight on Music published by Macmillan/McGraw Hill, served as a guide for delineation of the Richardson ISD concepts and skills. The textbook series divided lesson objectives into six units for every grade level, each of which was correlated to one of the six 6-week grading periods that comprise a school year in Richardson ISD. Each lesson objective from the textbook was assigned to one or more of the eight Richardson ISD concepts and skills categories and assigned to a particular 6-week grading period based upon both the findings in the review of literature and upon the comparison and correlation with the sequence in the textbook series. In grades K-2, the sequence outlined in the textbook series more directly influenced the sequence of concepts and skills of the Richardson ISD curriculum. Beginning with third grade, but particularly with sixth grade, the textbook sequence and the contents of the Richardson ISD music concepts and skills charts became more divergent. The results of the study should assist elementary music teachers in Richardson ISD in better organizing and implementing the district’s curriculum. The study concludes with abbreviated and succinct curriculum charts divided into six 6-week periods for each grade level with the results outlined in the study.\n\nThe title 'Relaxation Music' suggests an intended function. This paper endeavors to define how this may be achieved. A composer of 'Relaxation Music' may intuitively feel that he/she is serving this purpose. Intuition and opinion are also used for the selection of already-composed music to be packaged as Relaxation Music. Consequently, not all music marketed as Relaxation Music has a relaxing effect on the listener (only 16.6% according to one study). So, what exactly makes music relaxing? How does a composer achieve the intended function? Empirical studies carried out by non-musicians have identified relaxing qualities of music. These studies result in a broad definition of relaxation music. This paper expands on research conducted by scientists and psychologists with an in-depth musical analysis of a body of work deemed to be relaxing by existing research. Reductive harmonic analysis reveals that the harmony of relaxing works do not depart from a central reference point. The melodies of these works were found to be interesting and enjoyable by layperson listeners. However, in-depth reductive analysis uncovered somewhat of an avoidance of compositional techniques that are traditionally used to make a melody interesting. This study shows that, in addition to possessing the traits outlined in previous literature, relaxing music contains enough harmonic and melodic interest to keep the listener engaged, without being overly stimulating. This is primarily achieved with the use of simple harmonic and melodic reference points as well as a tentative use of the tools that create stimulation.\n\nABSTRACT The purpose of this study was to compile, analyze, and annotate a diverse collection of Brazilian children‘s songs and games for use in the American general music classroom. The data gathering process consisted of 47 days of fieldwork in several locations in Northeast, Southeast, and Central Brazil and ongoing conversations with informants. Research employed participant observation, structured and semi-structured interviews, and content analysis. The raw data consisted of audio and video and field notes. The following criteria for song selection were developed: 1) accessibility for the young voice, 2) accessibility of Portuguese for the English speaker, 3) aesthetic reasons (beauty, novelty, etc.) 4) diversity, 5) and the representation of Brazilian children‘s songs. From these criteria, the collection was limited to 30 songs. These were notated in standard notation and mastercopy format, translated, and pronunciation helps (IPA and phonetic) were included. The results of this study yield information about history/context, music elements, extramusical elements, specific to individual songs and the songs as a collection. The historical and contextual background of the songs reveal subjects ranging from history, land, animals, cuisine, and social issues, to economy, work, relationships, religious, and military life. In many cases, the songs reflect the demographics and social classes of Brazil. The genres consist of: cirandas, playground rhymes and songs, action songs, singing games, nonsense songs, children‘s songs, holiday songs, courting songs, role playing songs, and love songs. Texas Tech University, Bradley Layne Green, December 2010 vii The musical and textual features of the songs are: anacruses, outlines of the tonic triad, melodic sequences, repeated note group fragments at the ends of phrases and motives, and descending pentachords at the final cadence. The text often contains animal sounds, repeated syllables and vowel sounds, and parlendas (tongue twisters). The time signatures are and , with only one song in. The rhythmic content ranges in complexity from quarter notes to sixteenth-eighth-sixteenth notes and dotted sixteenths. Approximately two-thirds of the songs contain anacruses and two-thirds (20 of 30) of the songs contain semitones. The smallest range is a minor third, and the largest range is an octave. With the exception of one song in the Aeolian mode, the tonality of the songs is either major or intervallic centered with a major feel. Formally, the songs are divided into two or four sections. Songs in this collection can be used at many levels of teaching and learning because of the variety between simple and complex musical material. Trustworthiness is sought by using triangulation in the form of multiple data sources, member checks, and the involvement of peers and dissertation committee members in reviewing material for authenticity and reliability; an extended period of fieldwork and communication with informants, and self reflection. Recommendations and implications for further research are included.\n\n\"Over the last 25 years, U2 has been considered one of the most successful rock bands, which reflects in the immense popularity of their recordings and the vast attendance at their concerts. However, few of their supporters appreciate the artistic quality of their music. One of the best examples of profound art in U2’s catalogue is Achtung Baby, released in 1991 and frequently described as their reinvention. Not only was it revolutionary in terms of the band’s presentation, but it also introduced a new era of U2’s music influenced by dance music. Furthermore, lyrical themes changed, focusing on relationships and romance, while at the same time satirizing the emerging popculture based on technology such as television. The aim of this essay is to analyse the way this lyrical context is incorporated in the musical content of Achtung Baby. Due to the nature of musical subject, multiple approaches to analysis were used. First, spectrography was carried out in order to analyse timbre and dynamics. Second, comments from the musicians, album’s producers and engineers were considered to evaluate the role of post-production in shaping the final recording. Finally, most of the analysis was effectuated by standard musicology methods – by examining diverse audio material. As a conclusion, Achtung Baby was largely influenced by its lyrical context on the levels of instrumentation, timbre, texture, harmony, melody, form and rhythm alike. Despite having retained certain characteristics of previous U2 albums, it is indeed a reinvention, if not a complete rebirth of U2. Moreover, it exhibits a high level of conceptuality, with a distinct narrative entangled through the whole album in both music and lyrics. Thus Achtung Baby gained the status of a cult recording, protuberant among myriads of mediocre albums of aging bands in the 90’s.\"\n\nThe Nigerian film industry (Nollywood) embraces both motion picture and television approaches; yet it cannot be called one or the other in its entirety. This ‘both and neither’ nature has forced scholars such as Kenneth Harrow to ask: ‘how are we to read their films?’ and, by virtue of this article, their film music. I argue that the capacity to do so subsists in a thorough understanding of the industry’s organisation and long-held divergent creative process. My ethnographic study reveals that Nollywood’s structure of film music production differs significantly from some other known cinema traditions of the world. One such striking observation is that Nollywood film music projects and production (recording, editing, spotting, etc.) are entirely carried out without the involvement of film directors. And this unique process and structure strongly influences its film music approaches and aesthetics. This paper, thus, presents and examines those differences with a view to offering insights on how Nollywood film music might be understood."
