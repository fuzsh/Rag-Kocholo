        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nThe effects of climate change are increasingly visible. Storms, droughts, fires, and flooding have become stronger and more frequent [239]. Global ecosystems are changing, including the natural resources and agriculture on which humanity depends. The 2018 intergovernmental report on climate change estimated that the world will face catastrophic consequences unless global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are eliminated within 30 years [372]. Yet year after year, these emissions rise.\n\nAddressing climate change involves mitigation (reducing emissions) and adaptation (preparing for unavoidable consequences). Both are multifaceted issues. Mitigation of GHG emissions requires changes to electricity systems, transportation, buildings, industry, and land use. Adaptation requires planning for resilience and disaster management, given an understanding of climate and extreme events. Such a diversity of problems can be seen as an opportunity: there are many ways to have an impact.\n\nIn recent years, machine learning (ML) has been recognized as a broadly powerful tool for technological progress. Despite the growth of movements applying ML and artificial intelligence (AI) to problems of societal and global good, there remains the need for a concerted effort to identify how these tools may best be applied to tackle climate change. Many ML practitioners wish to act, but are uncertain how. On the other side, many fields have begun actively seeking input from the ML community.\n\nThis article aims to provide an overview of where ML can be applied with high impact in the fight against climate change, through either effective engineering or innovative research. The strategies we highlight include climate mitigation and adaptation, as well as meta-level tools that enable other strategies. In order to maximize the relevance of our recommendations, we have consulted experts across many fields (see Acknowledgments) in the preparation of this article.\n\n1.1 Who is this Article Written For?\n\nWe believe that our recommendations will prove valuable to several different audiences (detailed below). Given the wide diversity of technical areas involved, we do not assume any prior familiarity with application domains (such as agriculture or electric grids) and have tried to provide relevant keywords and background reading within each section of the article. While we use basic terminology from ML, knowledge of the specific ML techniques we reference is not necessary to understand any of our key points. For an overall introduction to ML, see e.g., [78].\n\nResearchers and engineers:. We identify many problems that require conceptual innovation and can advance the field of ML, as well as being highly impactful. For example, we highlight how climate models afford an exciting domain for interpretable ML (see Section 8.1). We encourage researchers and engineers across fields to use their expertise in solving urgent problems relevant to society.\n\nEntrepreneurs and investors:. We identify many problems where existing ML techniques could have a major impact without further research, and where the missing piece is deployment. We realize that some of the recommendations we offer here will make valuable startups and nonprofits. For example, we highlight techniques for providing fine-grained solar forecasts for power companies (see Section 2.1), tools for helping reduce personal energy consumption (see Section 11.2), and predictions for the financial impacts of climate change (see Section 14). We encourage entrepreneurs and investors to fill what is currently a wide-open space.\n\nCorporate leaders:. We identify problems where ML can lead to massive efficiency gains if adopted at scale by corporate players. For example, we highlight means of optimizing supply chains to reduce waste (see Section 5.1) and software/hardware tools for precision agriculture (see Section 6.2). We encourage corporate leaders to take advantage of opportunities offered by ML to benefit both the world and the bottom line.\n\nLocal and national governments:. We identify problems where ML can improve public services, help gather data for decision-making, and guide plans for future development. For example, we highlight intelligent transportation systems (see Section 3.4), techniques for automatically assessing the energy consumption of buildings in cities (see Section 4.2), and tools for improving disaster management (see Section 9.4). We encourage policymakers to consider opportunities for working with ML experts and building ML capacity in relevant public sector bodies. We further encourage public entities to release data that may be relevant to climate change mitigation and adaptation goals. (For further policy-related recommendations on this topic, see e.g., [406].)\n\n1.2 How to Read this Article\n\nThe article is broken into sections according to application domain (see Table 1). To help the reader, we have also included the following flags at the level of individual strategies.\n\n$\\,$ denotes bottlenecks that domain experts have identified in climate change mitigation or adaptation and that we believe to be particularly well-suited to tools from ML. These areas may be especially fruitful for ML practitioners wishing to have an outsized impact, though applications not marked with this flag are also valuable and should be pursued.\n\n$\\,$ denotes applications that will have their primary impact after 2040. While extremely important, these may in some cases be less pressing than those which can help act on climate change in the near term.\n\n$\\,$ denotes applications where the impact on GHG emissions is uncertain (for example, rebound effects may apply ) or where there is potential for undesirable side effects (negative externalities).\n\nThese flags should not be taken as definitive; they represent our understanding of more rigorous analyses within the domains we consider, combined with our subjective evaluation of the potential role of ML in these various applications.\n\nDespite the length of the article, we cannot cover everything. There will certainly be many applications that we have not considered, or that we have erroneously dismissed. We look forward to seeing where future work leads.\n\n1.3 A Call for Collaboration\n\nAll of the problems we highlight in this article require collaboration across fields. Collaboration reduces the chance of failure modes such as working on a problem that is not actually impactful, overly simplifying a complicated issue, or using advanced computational tools when simple tools will do the job.\n\nCollaboration is also essential to ensure that innovations will be deployed with the intended impact. Relevant stakeholders should be involved in the full pipeline of problem scoping and development, so that the final solution is well-tailored to the setting in which it will be used. For example, code can be written using a language and a platform that are already popular with the intended users, or can be integrated into an existing, widely used tool.\n\nWe realize that finding partners, as well as relevant resources such as data, can often be difficult. We encourage readers to visit the website that accompanies this article, www.climatechange.ai , where we offer additional resources, as well as opportunities for knowledge-sharing and networking.\n\n1.4 The Broader Picture\n\nWe emphasize that ML is not a silver bullet. The applications we highlight are impactful, but no one solution will “fix” climate change. There are also many areas of action where ML is inapplicable, and we omit these entirely. Moreover, while we focus here on ways in which ML can help address climate change, ML can also be applied in ways that make climate change worse. For instance, ML is used widely to accelerate activities such as fossil fuel exploration and extraction [303, 406, 814], while some ML models are themselves energy-intensive to train and run [69, 459, 720, 764].\n\nFinally, technology is not in itself enough to solve climate change, nor is it a replacement for other aspects of climate action such as policy. Many technological tools useful in addressing climate change have been available for years but have yet to be adopted at scale by society. While we hope that ML will be useful in accelerating effective strategies for climate action, humanity also must decide to act.\n\n2 Electricity Systems by Priya L. Donti\n\nAI has been called the new electricity, given its potential to transform entire industries [591]. Interestingly, electricity itself is one of the industries that AI is poised to transform. Many electricity systems are awash in data, and the industry has begun to envision next-generation systems (smart grids) driven by AI and ML [559, 623, 661, 814].\n\nElectricity systems are responsible for about a quarter of human-caused GHG emissions each year [370]. Moreover, as buildings, transportation, and other sectors seek to replace GHG-emitting fuels (Section 3–4), demand for low-carbon electricity will grow. To reduce emissions from electricity systems, society must\n\nRapidly transition to low-carbon electricity sources (such as solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear) and phase out carbon-emitting sources (such as coal, natural gas, and other fossil fuels).\n\nReduce GHG emissions associated with existing fossil fuel and electricity infrastructure, since the transition to low-carbon power will not happen overnight.\n\nImplement these changes across all countries and contexts, as electricity systems are everywhere.\n\nML can contribute on all fronts by informing the research, deployment, and operation of electricity system technologies (Figure 1). Such contributions include accelerating the development of clean energy technologies, improving forecasts of demand and clean energy, improving electricity system optimization, and enhancing system monitoring. These contributions require a variety of ML paradigms and techniques, as well as close collaborations with the electricity industry and other experts to integrate insights from operations research, electrical engineering, physics, chemistry, the social sciences, and other fields.\n\n2.1 Enabling Low-Carbon Electricity\n\nLow-carbon electricity sources are essential to tackling climate change. These sources come in two forms: variable and controllable. Variable sources fluctuate based on external factors; for instance, solar panels produce power only when the sun is shining, and wind turbines only when the wind is blowing. On the other hand, controllable sources such as nuclear or geothermal plants can be turned on and off (though not instantaneously ). These two types of sources affect electricity systems differently, presenting distinct opportunities for ML techniques.\n\n2.1.1 Variable Sources. Most electricity is delivered to consumers using a physical network called the electric grid, where the power generated must equal the power consumed at every moment. This means that solar panels, wind turbines, and other variable electricity generators are supported by some mix of natural gas plants, storage, or other controllable sources ready to buffer changes in their output (e.g., when unexpected clouds block the sun or the wind blows less strongly than predicted). Today, this buffer is often provided by coal and natural gas plants run in a CO$_2$-emitting standby mode called spinning reserve. In the future, this role is expected to be played by energy storage technologies such as batteries (Section 3.3), pumped hydro, or power-to-gas [226]; see [27] for an overview. ML can both reduce emissions from today's standby generators and enable the transition to carbon-free systems by helping improve necessary technologies (namely forecasting, scheduling, and control) and by helping create advanced electricity markets that accommodate both variable electricity and flexible demand.\n\nForecasting supply and demand.\n\nSince variable generation and electricity demand both fluctuate, they must be forecast ahead of time to inform real-time electricity scheduling and longer-term system planning. Better short-term forecasts can allow system operators to reduce their reliance on polluting standby plants and to proactively manage increasing amounts of variable sources. Better long-term forecasts can help system operators (and investors) determine where and when variable plants should be built. While many system operators today use basic forecasting techniques, forecasts will need to become increasingly accurate, span multiple horizons in time and space, and better quantify uncertainty to support these use cases. ML can help on all these fronts.\n\nTo date, many ML methods have been used to forecast electricity supply and demand. These methods have employed historical data, physical model outputs, images, and even video data to create short- to medium-term forecasts of solar power [9, 19, 161, 478, 524, 771, 818], wind power [216, 285, 450, 512], “run-of-the-river” hydro power [623], demand [351, 429, 458, 673], or more than one of these [402, 857] at aggregate spatial scales. These methods span various types of supervised ML, fuzzy logic, and hybrid physical models, and take different approaches to quantifying (or not quantifying) uncertainty. At a more spatially granular level, some work has attempted to understand specific categories of demand, for instance by clustering households [63, 421] or by disaggregating electricity signals using game theory, optimization, regression, and/or online learning [24, 409, 473].\n\nWhile much of this previous work has used domain-agnostic techniques, ML algorithms of the future will need to incorporate domain-specific insights. For instance, since weather fundamentally drives both variable generation and electricity demand, ML algorithms forecasting these quantities should draw from innovations in climate modeling and weather forecasting (Section 8) and in hybrid physics-plus-ML modeling techniques [161, 818, 822]. Such techniques can help improve short- to medium-term forecasts, and are also necessary for ML to contribute to longer-term (e.g., year-scale) forecasts since weather distributions shift over time [404]. In addition to incorporating system physics, ML models should also directly optimize for system goals [198, 220, 842]. For instance, the authors of [198] use a deep neural network to produce demand forecasts that optimize for electricity scheduling costs rather than forecast accuracy; this notion could be extended to produce forecasts that minimize GHG emissions. In non-automated settings where power system control engineers (partially) determine how much power each generator should produce, interpretable ML and automated visualization techniques could help engineers better understand forecasts and thus improve how they schedule low-carbon generators. More broadly, understanding the domain value of improved forecasts is an interesting challenge. For example, previous work has characterized the benefits of specific solar forecast improvements in a region of the United States [523]; further study in different contexts and for different types of improvements could help better direct ML work in the forecasting space.\n\nImproving scheduling and flexible demand.\n\nWhen balancing electricity systems, system operators use a process called scheduling and dispatch to determine how much power every controllable generator should produce. This process is slow and complex, as it is governed by NP-hard optimization problems such as unit commitment and optimal power flow that must be coordinated across multiple time scales (from sub-second to days ahead). Further, scheduling will become even more complex as electricity systems include more storage, variable generators, and flexible demand, since operators will need to manage even more system components while simultaneously solving scheduling problems more quickly to account for real-time variations in electricity production. Scheduling processes must therefore improve significantly for operators to manage systems with a high reliance on variable sources.\n\nML can help improve the existing (centralized) process of scheduling and dispatch by speeding up power system optimization problems and improving the quality of optimization solutions [333, 608]. For instance, ML can be used to approximate or simplify existing optimization problems [75, 242, 311, 871], find good starting points for optimization [52, 196, 382], identify redundant constraints [541], learn from the actions of power system control engineers [197], or do some combination of these [858]. Dynamic scheduling [225, 546] and (safe) reinforcement learning (RL) could also be used to balance the electric grid in real time; in fact, some electricity system operators have started to pilot similar methods at small, test case-based scales [520].\n\nWhile many modern electricity systems are centrally coordinated, recent work has examined how to (at least partially) decentralize scheduling and dispatch using energy storage, flexible demand, low-carbon generators, and other resources connected to the electric grid. One strategy is to explicitly design local control algorithms; for instance, recent work has controlled energy storage and solar inverters using supervised learning techniques trained on historical optimization data [191, 192, 410, 411]. Another strategy is to let storage, demand, and generation respond to real-time prices that reflect (for example) how emissions-intensive electricity currently is. In this case, ML can help both to design real-time prices and to respond to these prices. Previous work has used RL and dynamic programming to set real-time electricity prices [30, 90] and more broadly for power market design [30, 881]. Techniques such as (deep) RL [291, 292, 810, 881], agent-based models [173, 662, 663, 863], online optimization [99], and dynamic programming [704] can then help maximize profits for decentralized storage, demand, and generation, given real-time prices. See also [30] for an overview of deep learning techniques for demand response. In general, much more work is needed to test and scale existing decentralized solutions; barring deployment on real systems, platforms such as PowerTAC [638] and Grid2Op [519] can provide large-scale simulated environments on which to perform these tests.\n\nAccelerating materials science.\n\nScientists are working to develop new materials that can better store or otherwise harness energy from variable natural resources. For instance, creating solar fuels (synthetic fuels produced from sunlight or solar heat) could allow us to capture solar energy when the sun is shining and then store this energy for later use. However, the process of discovering new materials can be slow and imprecise; the physics behind materials are not completely understood, so human experts often manually apply heuristics to understand a proposed material's physical properties [49, 105]. ML can automate this process by combining existing heuristics with experimental data, physics, and reasoning to apply and even extend existing physical knowledge. For instance, recent work has used tools from ML, AI, optimization, and physics to figure out a proposed material's crystal structure, with the goal of accelerating materials discovery for solar fuels [49, 298, 773]. Other work seeking to improve battery storage technologies has combined first-principles physics calculations with support-vector regression to design conducting solids for lithium-ion batteries [257]. (Additional applications of ML to batteries are discussed in Section 3.3.) Recent work has also proposed the use of ML for scalable simulation of electrocatalysts for power-to-gas applications [894].\n\nMore generally in materials science, ML techniques including supervised learning, active learning, and generative models have been used to help synthesize, characterize, model, and design materials, as described in reviews [105, 490] and more recent work [299]. As discussed in [105], novel challenges for ML in materials science include coping with moderately sized datasets and inferring physical principles from trained models [800]. In addition to advancing technology, ML can inform policy for accelerated materials science; for instance, previous work has applied natural language processing to patent data to understand the solar panel innovation process [813]. We note that while our focus here has been on electricity system applications, ML for accelerated science may also have significant impacts outside electricity systems, e.g., by helping design alternatives to cement (Section 5.2) or create better CO$_2$ sorbents (Section 7.1).\n\nAdditional applications.\n\nThere are many additional opportunities for ML to advance variable power generation. For instance, it is important to ensure that low-carbon variable generators produce energy as efficiently and profitably as possible. Prior work has attempted to maximize electricity production by controlling solar panels [1, 3, 678] or wind turbine blades [2, 833] using RL or Bayesian optimization. Other work has used graphical models to detect faults in rooftop solar panels [377] and genetic algorithms to optimally place wind turbines within a wind farm [188]. ML can also help control batteries located at solar and wind farms to increase these farms’ profits, for instance by storing their electricity when prices are low and then selling it when prices are high; prior work has used ML to forecast electricity prices [460, 838] or RL to control batteries based on current and historical prices [825].\n\nML can also help integrate rooftop solar panels into the electric grid, particularly in the United States and Europe. Rooftop solar panels are connected to a part of the electric grid called the distribution grid, which traditionally did not have many sensors because it was only used to deliver electricity “one-way” from centralized power plants to consumers. However, rooftop solar and other distributed energy resources have created a “two-way” flow of electricity on distribution grids. Since the locations and sizes of rooftop solar panels are often unknown to electricity system operators, previous work has used computer vision techniques on satellite imagery to generate size and location data for rooftop solar panels [165, 514, 868]. Further, to ensure that the distribution system runs smoothly, recent work has employed techniques such as matrix completion and deep neural networks to estimate the state of the system when there are few sensors [199, 388, 626].\n\n2.1.2 Controllable Sources. Controllable low-carbon electricity sources can help achieve climate change goals while requiring very few changes to how the electric grid is run (since today's fossil fuel power plants are also controllable). ML can support existing controllable technologies while accelerating the development of new technologies such as nuclear fusion power plants.\n\nManaging existing technologies.\n\nMany controllable low-carbon technologies are already commercially available; these technologies include geothermal, nuclear fission, and (in some cases ) dam-based hydropower. ML can provide valuable input in planning where these technologies should be deployed and can also help maintain already-operating power plants. For instance, recent work has proposed to use ML to identify and manage sites for geothermal energy, using satellite imagery and seismic data [593]. Previous work has also used multi-objective optimization to place hydropower dams in a way that satisfies both energy and ecological objectives [856]. Finally, ML can help maintain nuclear fission reactors (i.e., nuclear power plants) by detecting cracks and anomalies from image and video data [129] or by preemptively detecting faults from high-dimensional sensor and simulation data [107]. (The authors of [794] speculate that ML and high performance computing could also be used to help simulate nuclear waste disposal options or even design next-generation nuclear reactors.)\n\nAccelerating fusion science.\n\nNuclear fusion reactors [577] have the potential to produce safe and carbon-free electricity using a virtually limitless hydrogen fuel supply, but currently consume more energy than they produce [146]. While considerable scientific and engineering research is still needed, ML can help accelerate this work by, e.g., guiding experimental design and monitoring physical processes; see also [360]. Fusion reactors require intelligent experimental design because they have a large number of tunable parameters; ML can help prioritize which parameter configurations should be explored during physical experiments. For instance, Google and TAE Technologies have developed a human-in-the-loop experimental design algorithm enabling rapid parameter exploration for TAE's reactor [53].\n\nPhysically monitoring fusion reactors is also an important application for ML. Modern reactors attempt to super-heat hydrogen into a plasma state and then stabilize it, but during this process, the plasma may experience rapid instabilities that damage the reactor. Prior work has tried to preemptively detect disruptions for tokamak reactors, using supervised learning methods such as support-vector machines, adaptive fuzzy logic, decision trees, and deep learning [110, 413, 567, 811, 846, 850] on previous disruption data. While many of these methods are tuned to work on individual reactors, recent work has shown that deep learning may enable insights that generalize to multiple reactors [413]. More generally, rather than simply detecting disruptions, scientists need to understand how plasma's state evolves over time, e.g., by finding the solutions of time-dependent magnetohydrodynamic equations [57]; speculatively, ML could help characterize this evolution and even help steer plasma into safe states through reactor control. ML models for such fusion applications would likely employ a combination of simulated and experimental data, and would need to account for the different physical characteristics, data volumes, and simulator speeds or accuracies associated with different reactor types.\n\n2.2 Reducing Current-System Impacts\n\nWhile switching to low-carbon electricity sources will be essential, in the meantime, it will also be important to mitigate emissions from the electricity system as it currently stands. Some methods for mitigating current-system impacts include cutting emissions from fossil fuels, reducing waste from electricity delivery, and flexibly managing demand to minimize its emissions impacts.\n\nReducing life-cycle fossil fuel emissions.\n\nReducing emissions from fossil fuels is a necessary stopgap while society transitions towards low-carbon electricity. In particular, ML can help prevent the leakage of methane (an extremely potent GHG) from natural gas pipelines and compressor stations. Previous and ongoing work has used sensor and/or satellite data to proactively suggest pipeline maintenance [213, 898] or detect existing leaks [81, 749, 823, 826], and there is a great deal of opportunity in this space to improve and scale existing strategies. In addition to leak detection, ML can help reduce emissions from freight transportation of solid fuels (Section 3), identify and manage storage sites for CO$_2$ sequestered from power plant flue gas (Section 7.2), and optimize power plant parameters to reduce CO$_2$ emissions. In all these cases, projects should be pursued with great care so as not to impede or prolong the transition to a low-carbon electricity system; ideally, projects should be preceded by system impact analyses to ensure that they will indeed decrease GHG emissions.\n\nReducing system waste.\n\nAs electricity gets transported from generators to consumers, some of it gets lost as resistive heat on electricity lines. While some of these losses are unavoidable, others can be significantly mitigated to reduce waste and emissions. ML can help prevent avoidable losses through predictive maintenance, e.g., by suggesting proactive electricity grid upgrades (see also Sections 5.3 and 9.2). Prior work has performed predictive maintenance using long short-term memory (LSTM) [76], bipartite ranking [702], and neural network-plus-clustering techniques [581] on electric grid data, and future work will need to improve and/or localize these approaches to different contexts.\n\nModeling emissions.\n\nFlexibly managing household, commercial, industrial, and electric vehicle (EV) demand (as well as energy storage) can help minimize electricity-based emissions (Sections 3, 4, 5, and 11), but doing so involves understanding what the emissions on the electric grid actually are at any moment. Specifically, marginal emissions factors capture the emissions effects of small changes in demand at any given time. To inform consumers about marginal emissions factors, initiatives such as WattTime [832] and the electricityMap project [789] have used ML and regression-based techniques to forecast marginal emissions based on electricity and weather data. Recent work has also used ML for trend extraction and feature selection within marginal emissions forecasting models [476]. Great Britain's National Grid ESO uses ensemble models to forecast average emissions factors, which measure the aggregate emissions intensity of all power plants [576]. There is still much room to improve the performance of these methods, as well as to forecast related quantities such as electricity curtailments (i.e., the wasting of usually low-carbon electricity for grid balancing purposes). As most existing methods produce point estimates, it would also be important to quantify the uncertainty of these estimates to ensure that load-shifting techniques indeed decrease (rather than increase) emissions.\n\n2.3 Ensuring Global Impact\n\nMuch of the discussion around electricity systems often focuses on settings such as the United States with near universal electricity access and relatively abundant data. However, many places that do not share these attributes are still integral to tackling climate change [370] and warrant serious consideration. To ensure global impact, ML can help improve electricity access and translate electricity system insights from high-data to low-data contexts.\n\nImproving clean energy access.\n\nImproving access to clean electricity can address climate change while simultaneously improving social and economic development [430, 431]. Specifically, clean electricity provided via electric grids, microgrids, or off-grid methods can displace diesel generators, wood-burning stoves, and other carbon-emitting energy sources. Figuring out what clean electrification methods are best for different areas can require intensive, on-the-ground surveying work, but ML can help provide input to this process in a scalable manner. For instance, previous work has used image processing, clustering, and optimization techniques on satellite imagery to inform electrification initiatives [219]. ML can also help operate rural microgrids through accurate forecasts of demand and power production [120, 601] as well as tailored optimization and control schemes [493], since small microgrids are even harder to balance than country-scale electric grids. Generating data to aid energy access policy and better managing energy access strategies are therefore two areas in which ML may have promising applications.\n\nApproaching low-data settings.\n\nWhile ML methods have often been applied to grids with widespread sensors, system operators in many countries do not collect or share system data. Although these data availability practices may evolve, it may meanwhile be beneficial to use ML techniques such as transfer learning to translate insights from high-data to low-data settings (especially since all electric grids share the same underlying system physics). Developing data-efficient ML techniques will likely also be useful in low-data settings; for instance, in [680], the authors enforce physical or other domain-specific constraints on weakly supervised ML models, allowing these models to learn from very little labeled data.\n\nML can also help generate information within low-data settings. For instance, recent work has estimated the layout of electricity grids in regions where they are not explicitly mapped, using computer vision and graph search techniques on satellite imagery [278, 359]. Companies have also used satellite imagery to measure power plant CO$_2$ emissions [114, 301] (also see Section 6.1). Other recent work has modeled electricity consumption using regression-based techniques on cellular network data [85], which may prove useful in settings with many cellular towers but few electric grid sensors. Although low-data settings are generally underexplored by the ML community, electricity systems research in these settings presents opportunities for both innovative ML and climate change mitigation.\n\n2.4 Discussion\n\nData-driven and critical to climate change, electricity systems hold many opportunities for ML research and practice. At the same time, applications in this space hold many potential pitfalls; for instance, innovations that seek to reduce GHG emissions in the oil and gas industries could actually increase emissions by making them cheaper to emit [814]. Given these domain-specific nuances, working in this area requires close collaborations with electricity system decision-makers and with practitioners in fields including electrical engineering, the natural sciences, and the social sciences. Interpretable ML may also enable practitioners to better understand, apply, and audit models in real-world settings. Similarly, it will be important to develop hybrid ML models that explicitly account for system physics (see e.g., [132, 164, 304, 680, 843]), directly optimize for domain-specific goals [198, 220, 842], or otherwise incorporate or scale existing domain knowledge. Finally, since many modern electric grids are not data-abundant (although they may be data-driven), understanding how to apply data-driven insights to these grids may be the next grand challenge for ML in electricity systems.\n\n3 Transportation by Lynn H. Kaack\n\nTransportation systems form a complex web that is fundamental to an active and prosperous society. Globally, the transportation sector accounts for about a quarter of energy-related CO$_2$ emissions [372]. In contrast to the electricity sector, however, transportation has not made significant progress to lower its CO$_2$ emissions [154] and much of the sector is regarded as hard to decarbonize [162]. This is because of the high energy density of fuels required for many types of vehicles, which constrains low-carbon alternatives, and because transport policies directly impact end-users and are thus more likely to be controversial.\n\nPassenger and freight transportation are each responsible for about half of transport GHG emissions [712]. Both freight and passengers can travel by road, by rail, by water, or by air (referred to as transport modes). Different modes carry vastly different carbon emission intensities. At present, more than two-thirds of transportation emissions are from road travel [712], but air travel has the highest emission intensity and is responsible for an increasingly large share. Strategies to reduce GHG emissions from transportation consist of [712]:\n\nreducing transport activity;\n\nimproving vehicle efficiency;\n\nalternative fuels and electrification; and\n\nmodal shift (shifting to lower-carbon options, like rail).\n\nEach of these mitigation strategies offers opportunities for ML (Figure 2). While many of us probably think of autonomous vehicles (AVs) and ride-sharing when we think of transport and ML, these technologies have uncertain impacts on GHG emissions [820], potentially even increasing them. We discuss these disruptive technologies in Section 3.1 but show that ML can play a role for decarbonizing transportation that goes much further. ML can improve vehicle engineering, enable intelligent infrastructure, and provide policy-relevant information. Many interventions that reduce GHG emissions in the transportation sector require changes in planning, maintenance, and operations of transportation systems, even though the GHG reduction potential of those measures might not be immediately apparent. ML can help in implementing such interventions, for example, by providing better demand forecasts. Typically, ML strategies are most effective in tandem with strong public policies. While we do not cover all ML applications in the transportation sector, we aim to include those areas that can conceivably reduce GHG emissions.\n\n3.1 Reducing Transport Activity\n\nA colossal amount of transport occurs each day across the world, but much of this mileage occurs inefficiently, resulting in needless GHG emissions. With the help of ML, the number of vehicle-miles traveled can be reduced by making long trips less necessary, increasing loading, and optimizing vehicle routing. Here, we discuss the first two in depth—for a discussion of ML and routing, see for example [873].\n\nUnderstanding transportation data.\n\nMany areas of transportation lack data, and decision-makers often design infrastructure and policy with uncertain information. In recent years, new types of sensors have become available, and ML can turn this raw data into useful information. Traditionally, traffic is monitored with ground-based counters that are installed on selected roads. A variety of technologies are used, such as inductive loop detectors or pneumatic tubes. Traffic is sometimes monitored with video systems, in particular when counting pedestrians and cyclists, which can be automated with computer vision [870]. Since counts on most roads are often available only over short time frames, these roads are modeled by looking at known traffic patterns for similar roads. ML methods, such as SVMs and neural networks, have made it easier to classify roads with similar traffic patterns [270, 454, 796]. As ground-based counters require costly installation and maintenance, many countries do not have such systems. Vehicles can also be detected in high-resolution satellite images with high accuracy [177, 390, 566, 747], and image counts can serve to estimate average vehicle traffic [405]. Similarly, ML methods can help with imputing missing data for precise bottom-up estimation of GHG emissions [583] and they are also applied in simulation models of vehicle emissions [46].\n\nModeling demand.\n\nModeling demand and planning new infrastructure can significantly shape how long trips are and which transport modes are chosen by passengers and shippers—for example, discouraging sprawl and creating new transportation links can both reduce GHG emissions. ML can provide information about mobility patterns, which is directly necessary for agent-based travel demand models, one of the main transport planning tools [864]. For example, ML makes it possible to estimate origin-destination demand from traffic counts [504], and it offers new methods for spatio-temporal road traffic forecasting—which do not always outperform other statistical methods [223] but may transfer well between areas [776]. Also, short-term forecasting of public transit ridership can improve with ML; see for example [158, 586]. ML is particularly relevant for deducing information from novel data—for example, learning about the behavior of public transit users from smart card data [280, 515]. Also, mobile phone sensors provide new means to understand personal travel demand and the urban topology, such as walking route choices [795]. Similarly, ML-based modeling of demand can help mitigate climate change by improving operational efficiency of modes that emit significant CO$_2$, such as aviation. ML can help predict runway demand and aircraft taxi time in order to reduce the excess fuel burned in the air and on the ground due to congestion in airports [379, 474].\n\nShared mobility.\n\nIn the passenger sector, shared mobility (such as on-demand ride services or vehicle-sharing ), is undoubtedly disrupting the way people travel and think about vehicle ownership, and ML plays an integral part in running and optimizing these services (e.g., [768, 837]). However, it is largely unclear what the impact of this development will be on GHG emissions. For example, shared cars can actually cause more people to travel by car, as opposed to using public transportation. Similarly, on-demand taxi services add mileage when traveling without a customer, possibly negating any GHG emission savings [765]. On the other hand, shared mobility can lead to higher utilization of each vehicle, which means a more efficient use of materials [341]. The use of newer and more efficient vehicles, ideally electric ones, could increase with vehicle-sharing concepts, reducing GHG emissions. Some of the issues raised above could also perhaps be overcome by making taxis autonomous. Such vehicles also might integrate better with public transportation, and offer new concepts for pooled rides, which substantially reduce the emissions per person-mile.\n\nML methods can help to understand the energy impact of shared mobility concepts. For example, they can be used to predict if a customer decides to share a ride with other passengers from an on-demand ride service [133]. For decision-makers it is important to have access to timely location-specific empirical analysis to understand if a ride share service is taking away customers from low-carbon transit modes and increasing the use of cars. Some local governments are beginning to require data-sharing from these providers (see Section 4.3).\n\nCar-sharing services using AVs could yield GHG emission savings when they encourage people to use public transit for part of the journey [552] or with autonomous EVs [408]. However, using autonomous shared vehicles alone could increase the total vehicle-miles traveled and therefore do not necessarily lead to lower emissions as long as the vehicles have internal combustion engines (or electrical engines on a “dirty” electrical grid) [131, 495]. We see the intersection of shared mobility, autonomous and EVs, and smart public transit—prioritizing low-carbon vehicle technologies and shared transportation—as a path where ML can make a contribution to shaping future mobility. See also Section 3.2 for more on AVs.\n\nWhen designing and promoting new mobility services, it is important that industry and public policy prioritize lowering GHG emissions. Misaligned incentives in the early stages of technological development could result in the lock-in to a service with high GHG emissions [36, 44].\n\nFreight routing and consolidation.\n\nBundling shipments together, which is referred to as freight consolidation, dramatically reduces the number of trips (and therefore the GHG emissions). The same is true for changing routing so that trucks do not have to return empty. As rail and water modes require much larger loads than trucks, consolidation also enables shipments to use these modes for part of the journey [407]. Freight consolidation and routing decisions are often taken by third-party logistics service providers and other freight forwarders, such as in the less-than-truckload market, which deals with shipments of smaller sizes. ML offers opportunities to optimize this complex interaction of shipment sizes, modes, origin-destination pairs, and service requirements. Many problem settings are addressed with methods from the field of operations research. There is evidence that ML can improve upon these methods, in particular mixed-integer linear programming [70]. Other proposed and deployed applications of ML include predicting arrival times or demand, identifying and planning around transportation disruptions [279], and clustering suppliers by their geographical location and common shipping destinations. Proposed planning approaches include designing allocation algorithms and freight auctions, and ML has for example been shown to help pick good algorithms and parameters to solve auction markets [708].\n\nAlternatives to transport.\n\nDisruptive technologies that are based on ML could replace or reduce transportation demand. For example, additive manufacturing (AM) or 3-D printing has (limited) potential to reduce freight transport by producing lighter goods and enabling production closer to the consumer [407]. ML can be a valuable tool for improving AM processes [859]. ML can also help to improve virtual communication [733]. If passenger trips are replaced by telepresence, travel demand can be reduced, as has been shown for example in public agencies [34] and for scientific teams [518]. However, it is uncertain to what extent virtual meetings replace physical travel, or if they may actually give rise to more face-to-face meetings [762].\n\n3.2 Improving Vehicle Efficiency\n\nMost vehicles are not very efficient compared to what is technically possible: for example, aircraft carbon intensity is expected to decline by more than a third with respect to 2012, simply by virtue of newer models replacing aging jets [713]. Both the design of the vehicle and the way it is operated can increase the fuel economy. Here, we discuss how ML can help design more efficient vehicles and the impacts that autonomous driving may have on GHG emissions. Encouraging drivers to adopt more efficient vehicles is also a priority; while we do not focus on this here, ML plays a role in studying consumer preferences in vehicle markets [103].\n\nDesigning for efficiency.\n\nThere are many ways to reduce the energy a vehicle uses—such as more efficient engines, improved aerodynamics, hybrid electric engines, and reducing the vehicle's weight or tire resistance. These different strategies require a broad range of engineering techniques, many of which can benefit from ML. For example, ML is applied in advanced combustion engine design [384]. Hybrid EVs, which are more efficient than combustion engines alone, rely on power management methods that can be improved with ML [15]. Aerodynamic efficiency improvements need turbulence modeling that is often computationally intensive and relies heavily on ML-based surrogate models [865]. Aerodynamic improvements can not only be made by vehicle design but also by rearranging load. Lai et al. [461] use computer vision to detect aerodynamically inefficient loading on freight trains. AM (3-D printing) can produce lighter parts in vehicles, such as road vehicles and aircraft, that reduce energy consumption [341, 407]. ML is applied to improve those processes, for example through failure detection [722, 730] or material design [309].\n\nAutonomous vehicles.\n\nML is essential in the development of AVs, including in such basic tasks as following the road and detecting obstacles [87]. While AVs could reduce energy consumption—for example, by reducing traffic congestion and inducing efficiency through eco-driving—it is also possible that AVs will lead to an increase in overall road traffic that nullifies efficiency gains. (For an overview of possible energy impacts of AVs, see [95, 820], and for broader impacts on mobility, see [327].) Two advantages of AVs in the freight sector promise to cut GHG emissions: First, small AVs, such as delivery robots and drones, could reduce the energy consumption of last-mile delivery [758], though they come with regulatory challenges [517]. Second, trucks can reduce energy consumption by platooning (driving very close together to reduce air resistance), thereby alleviating some of the challenges that come with electrifying long-distance road freight [318]. Platooning relies on autonomous driving and communication technologies that allow vehicles to brake and accelerate simultaneously.\n\nML can help to develop AV technologies specifically aimed at reducing energy consumption. For example, Wu et al. [851, 852] develop AV controllers based on RL to smooth out traffic involving non-AVs. Their studies of emergent behaviors in mixed-autonomy environments aim to understand the impact that varying shares of AVs can have on potentially reducing congestion-related energy consumption ML methods can also help to understand driving practices that are more energy efficient. For example, Jiménez et al. [392] use data from smart phone sensors to identify driving behavior that leads to higher energy consumption in EVs.\n\n3.3 Alternative Fuels and Electrification\n\nElectric vehicles.\n\nEV technologies—using batteries, hydrogen fuel cells, or electrified roads and railways—are regarded as a primary means to decarbonize transport. EVs can have very low GHG emissions—depending, of course, on the carbon intensity of the electricity. ML is vital for a range of different problems related to EVs. Rigas et al. [684] detail methods by which ML can improve charge scheduling, congestion management, and vehicle-to-grid algorithms. ML methods have also been applied to battery energy management (for example charge estimation [330] or optimization in hybrid EVs [15]), and to detect faults and lateral misalignment in wireless charging of EVs [780].\n\nAs more people drive EVs, understanding their use patterns will become more important. Modeling charging behavior will be useful for grid operators looking to predict electric load. For this application, it is possible to analyze residential EV charging behavior from aggregate electricity load (energy disaggregation, see also Section 4.1) [827]. Also, in-vehicle sensors and communication data are increasingly becoming available and offer an opportunity to understand travel and charging behavior of EV owners, which can for example inform the placement of charging stations [779] or alternatives such as battery swapping stations.\n\nBattery EVs are typically not used for more than a fraction of the day, allowing them to act as energy storage for the grid at other times, where charging and discharging is controlled for example by price signals [265] (see Sections 2.1.1 and 2.2). There is much potential for ML (e.g., RL [810]) to improve such vehicle-to-grid technology, which, like other mechanisms for grid energy storage (see Section 2.1.1), can help to reduce GHG emissions from electricity generation. Vehicle-to-grid technology comes with private and social financial benefits. However, consumers are expected to be reluctant to agree to such services, as they might not want to compromise their driving range [343].\n\nFinally, ML can also play a role in the research and development of batteries, a decisive technology for EV costs and usability. Work in this area has focused on predicting battery state, degradation, and remaining lifetime using supervised learning techniques, fuzzy logic, and clustering [42, 104, 218, 358, 414, 725, 735, 819, 854]. However, many models developed in academia are based on laboratory data that do not account for real-world factors such as environmental conditions [735, 819, 854]. By contrast, industry lags behind in ML modeling, but real-world operational data are readily available. Merging these two perspectives could yield significant benefits for the field.\n\nAlternative fuels.\n\nMuch of the transportation sector is highly dependent on liquid fossil fuels. Aviation, long-distance road transportation, and ocean shipping require fuels with high energy density and thus are not conducive to electrification [162]. Electrofuels [98], solar fuels (Section 2.1.1), biofuels [6], hydrogen [111, 803], and perhaps natural gas [792] offer alternatives, but the use of these fuels is constrained by factors such as cost, land-use, and (for hydrogen and natural gas) incompatibility with current infrastructure [162]. Electrofuels and biofuels have the potential to serve as low-carbon drop-in fuels that retain the properties of fossil fuels, such as high energy density, while retaining compatibility with the existing fleet of vehicles and the current fuel infrastructure [407]. Fuels such as electrofuels and hydrogen can be produced using electricity-intensive processes and can be stored at lower cost than electricity. Thus, as a form of energy storage, these fuels could provide services to the electricity grid by enabling flexible power use and balancing variable electricity generators (Section 2.1.1). Given their relative long-term importance and early stage of development, they present a critical opportunity to mitigate climate change. ML techniques may present opportunities for improvement at various stages of research and development of alternative fuels (similar to applications in Section 2.1.1).\n\n3.4 Modal Shift\n\nShifting passengers and freight to low carbon-intensity modes is one of the most important means to decarbonize transport. This modal shift in passenger transportation can for example involve providing people with public transit, which requires analyzing mode choice and travel demand data. ML can also make low-carbon freight modes more competitive by helping to coordinate intermodal transport.\n\nPassenger preferences.\n\nML can improve our understanding about passengers’ travel mode choices, which in turn informs transportation planning, such as where public transit should be built. Some recent studies have shown that supervised ML based on survey data can improve passenger mode choice models [322, 571, 597]. Seo et al. propose to conduct long-term travel surveys with online learning, which reduces the demand on respondents, while obtaining high data quality [724]. Sun et al. [770] use SVMs and neural networks for analyzing preferences of customers traveling by high speed rail in China. There is also work on inferring people's travel modes and destinations from social media or various mobile phone sensors such as GPS (transportation mode detection), e.g., [156, 798]. Also in the freight sector, ML has been applied to analyze modal trade-offs, for example, by imputing data on counterfactual mode choices [706].\n\nEnabling low-carbon options.\n\nIn order to incentivize more users to choose low-carbon transport modes, their costs and service quality can be improved. Many low-carbon modes must be integrated with other modes of transportation to deliver the same level of service. For example, when traveling by train, the trip to and from the station will often be by car, taxi, bus, or bike. There are many opportunities for ML to facilitate a better integration of modes, both in the passenger and freight sectors. ML can also help to improve the operation of low-carbon modes, for example, by reducing the operations and maintenance costs of rail [383] and predicting track degradation [746].\n\nBike sharing and electric scooter services can offer low-carbon alternatives for urban mobility that do not require ownership and integrate well with public transportation. ML studies help to understand how usage patterns for bike stations depend on their immediate urban surroundings [364]. ML can also help solve the bike sharing rebalancing problem, where shared bikes accumulate in one location and are lacking in other locations, by improving forecasts of bike demand and inventory [675]. Singla et al. [739] propose a pricing mechanism based on online learning to provide monetary incentives for bike users to help rebalancing. By producing accurate travel time estimates, ML can provide tools that help to integrate bike shares with other modes of transportation [281]. Many emerging bike and scooter sharing services are dockless, which means that they are parked anywhere in public space and can block sidewalks [25]. ML has been applied to monitor public sentiment about such bike shares via tweets [775]. ML could also provide tools and information for regulators to ensure that public space can be used by everyone [741].\n\nCoordination between modes resulting in faster and more reliable transit times could increase the amount of people or goods traveling on low-carbon modes such as rail. ML algorithms could be applied to make public transportation faster and easier to use. For example, there is a rich literature exploring ML methods to predict bus arrival times and their uncertainty [18, 526]. Often freight is packaged so that it can switch between different modes of transport easily. Such intermodal transportation relies on low-carbon modes such as rail and water for part of the journey [407]. ML can contribute by improving predictions of the estimated time of arrival (for example, of freight trains [56]) or the weight or volume of expected freight (for example, for roll-on/roll-off transport—often abbreviated as Ro-Ro [560]). Intelligent transport systems of different modes could be combined and enable more efficient multimodal freight transportation [407].\n\nSome modes with high GHG emissions, such as trucks, can be particularly cost-competitive in regions with lax enforcement of regulation, as they can benefit from overloading and not obeying labor or safety rules [407]. ML can assist public institutions with enforcing their regulations. For example, image recognition can help law enforcement detect overloading of trucks [888].\n\n3.5 Discussion\n\nDecarbonizing transport is essential to a low-carbon society, and there are numerous applications where ML can make an impact. This is because transportation causes a large share of GHG emissions, but reducing them has been slow and complex. Solutions are likely very technical, are highly dependent on existing infrastructure, and require detailed understanding of passengers’ and freight companies’ behavior. ML can help decarbonize transportation by providing data, gaining knowledge from data, planning, and automation. Moreover, ML is fundamental to shared mobility, AVs, EVs, and smart public transit, which, with the right incentives, can be used to enable significant reductions in GHG emissions.\n\n4 Buildings & Cities by Nikola Milojevic-Dupont & Lynn H. Kaack\n\nBuildings offer some of the lowest-hanging fruit when it comes to reducing GHG emissions. While the energy consumed in buildings is responsible for a quarter of global energy-related emissions [372], a combination of easy-to-implement fixes and state-of-the-art strategies could reduce emissions for existing buildings by up to 90% [802]. It is possible today for buildings to consume almost no energy [595]. Many of these energy efficiency measures actually result in overall cost savings [754] and simultaneously yield other benefits, such as cleaner air for occupants. This potential can be achieved while maintaining the services that buildings provide—and even while extending them to more people, as climate change will necessitate. For example, with the changing climate, more people will need access to air conditioning in regions where deadly heat waves will become common [553, 554].\n\nTwo major challenges are heterogeneity and inertia. Buildings vary according to age, construction, usage, and ownership, so optimal strategies vary widely depending on the context. For instance, buildings with access to cheap, low-carbon electricity may have less need for expensive features such as intelligent light bulbs. Buildings also have very long lifespans; thus, it is necessary both to create new, energy-efficient buildings, and to retrofit old buildings to be as efficient as possible [150]. Urban planning and public policy can play a major role in reducing emissions by providing infrastructure, financial incentives, or energy standards for buildings [536].\n\nML provides critical tools for supporting both building managers and policymakers in their efforts to reduce GHG emissions (Figure 3). At the level of building management, ML can help select strategies that are tailored to individual buildings, and can also contribute to implementing those strategies via smart control systems (Section 4.1). At the level of urban planning, ML can be used to gather and make sense of data to inform policymakers (Section 4.2). Finally, we consider how ML can help cities as a whole to transition to low-carbon futures (Section 4.3).\n\n4.1 Optimizing Buildings\n\nIn designing new buildings and improving existing ones, there are numerous technologies that can reduce GHG emissions, often saving money in the process [276, 499, 595, 754, 802]. ML can accelerate these strategies by (i) modeling data on energy consumption and (ii) optimizing energy use (in smart buildings).\n\nModeling building energy.\n\nAn essential step towards energy efficiency is making sense of the increasing amounts of data produced by meters and home energy monitors (see for example [723]). This can take the form of energy demand forecasts for specific buildings, which are useful for power companies (Section 2.1.1) and in evaluating building design and operation strategies [20]. Traditionally, energy demand forecasts are based on models of the physical structure of a building that are essentially massive thermodynamics computations. ML has the potential to speed up these computations greatly, either by ignoring physical knowledge of the building entirely [452, 617], by incorporating it into the computation [195], or by learning to approximate the physical model to reduce the need for expensive simulation (surrogate models) [274]. Learning how to transfer the knowledge gained from modeling one building to another can make it easier to render precise estimations of more buildings. For instance, Mocanu et al. [544] modeled building load profiles with RL and deep belief networks using data on commercial and residential buildings; they then used approximate RL and transfer learning to make predictions about new buildings, enabling the transfer of knowledge from commercial to residential buildings, and from gas- to power-heated buildings.\n\nWithin a single building, understanding which appliances drive energy use (energy disaggregation) is crucial for targeting efficiency measures, and can motivate behavioral changes. Promising ML approaches to this problem include hidden Markov models [445], sparse coding algorithms for structured prediction [443], harmonic analysis that picks out the “signatures” of individual appliances [750], and deep neural networks [423].\n\nTo verify the success or failure of energy efficiency interventions, statistical ML offers methods for causal inference. For example, Burlig et al. [102] used Lasso regression on hourly electricity consumption data from schools in California to find that energy efficiency interventions fall short of the expected savings. Such problems could represent a useful application of deep learning methods for counterfactual prediction [332].\n\nSmart buildings.\n\nIntelligent control systems in buildings can decrease their carbon footprint both by reducing the energy consumed and by providing means to integrate lower-carbon sources into the electricity mix [277]. Specifically, ML can reduce energy usage by allowing devices and systems to adapt to usage patterns. Further, buildings can respond to signals from the electricity grid, providing flexibility to the grid operator and lowering costs to the consumer (Section 2.1.1).\n\nMany critical systems inside buildings can be made radically more efficient. While this is also true for various appliances such as refrigerators and lightbulbs, we focus on the example of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) systems, both because they are notoriously inefficient and because they account for more than half of the energy consumed in buildings [499]. There are several promising ways to enhance HVAC operating performance, each providing substantial opportunities for using ML: forecasting what temperatures are needed throughout the system, better control to achieve those temperatures, and fault detection. Forecasting temperatures, as with modeling energy use in buildings, has traditionally been performed using detailed physical models of the system involved; however, ML approaches such as deep belief networks can potentially increase accuracy with less computational expense [4, 255] (see also Section 5.3). For control, Kazmi et al. [417] used deep RL to achieve a scalable 20% reduction of energy while requiring only three sensors: air temperature, water temperature, and energy use (see also Section 5.3 for similarly substantial gains in datacenter cooling). Finally, ML can automate building diagnostics and maintenance through fault-detection. For example, the energy efficiency of cooling systems can degrade if refrigerant levels are low [435]; ML approaches are well-suited to detect faults in these systems. Wang et al. [829] treated HVAC fault-detection as a one-class classification problem, using only temperature readings for their predictions. Deep autoencoders can be used to simplify information about machine operation so that deep neural networks can then more easily predict multiple kinds of faults [387].\n\nMany systems within buildings—such as lights and heating—can also adjust how they operate based on whether a building or room is occupied, thereby improving both occupant comfort and energy use [614]. ML can help these systems dynamically adapt to changes in occupancy patterns [669]. Moreover, occupancy detection itself represents an opportunity for ML algorithms, ranging from decision trees [193, 882] to deep neural networks [896] that take input from occupancy sensors [193], WiFi signals [896, 897], or appliance power consumption data [882]. Energy game-theoretic frameworks can also incentivize occupants to actively minimize their energy demand, and ML can help here to develop tailored incentives based on different energy usage behaviors [159].\n\nIn Section 2.1.1, we discussed how using variable low-carbon energy can mean that the supply and price of electricity vary over time. Thus, energy flexibility in buildings is increasingly useful to schedule consumption when supply is high [683]. For this, automated demand-side response [357] can respond to electricity prices, smart meter signals, or learned user preferences [393]. Edge computing can be used to process data from distributed sensors and other Internet of Things devices, and deep RL can then use this data to efficiently schedule energy use [489], at the level of single or multiple buildings, or at the microgrid and grid level [631].\n\nWhile smart building technologies have the capability to significantly increase efficiency, we should note that there are potential drawbacks [346]. First, smart building devices and connection networks, like wireless sensor networks, consume energy themselves. Deep neural networks can be used to monitor and optimize such operations [39]. Second, rebound effects are likely to happen in certain cases [45], leading to additional building energy consumption typically ranging between 10 and 20% [671]. Third, if control systems optimize for costs, interventions do not necessarily translate into energy efficiency measures or GHG reductions. Therefore, public policies are needed to mandate, support and complement the actions of individual building managers [499]. Another concern in the case of widespread adoption of smart meters is the impact on mineral use and embodied energy use arising from their production [736]. Finally, smart home applications present security and privacy risks [144] that require adequate regulation.\n\n4.2 Urban Planning\n\nFor many impactful mitigation strategies—such as district heating and cooling, neighborhood planning, and large-scale retrofitting of existing buildings—coordination at the district and city level is essential. Policymakers use instruments such as building codes, retrofitting subsidies, investments in public utilities, and public–private partnerships in order to reduce GHG emissions without compromising equity. Where energy-use data on individual buildings exist, ML can be used to derive higher-level patterns. However, many regions of the world have almost no energy consumption data, which can make it difficult to design targeted mitigation strategies. ML is uniquely capable of predicting energy consumption and GHG mitigation potential at scale from other types of available data, thereby guiding policy design [536].\n\nModeling energy use across buildings.\n\nUrban Building Energy Models (UBEMs) provide simplified information on the energy use of all buildings across a city. These are different from individual building models, which model energy use of only specific buildings, but with finer details and temporal granularity (Section 4.1). While UBEMs have yet to be adopted at scale, they are expected to become fundamental for enabling localized action by city planners [677]. UBEMs can for example be used for planning and operating district heating and cooling, where a central plant supplies many households in a district. In turn, district heating and cooling reduces HVAC energy consumption and can provide flexible load [808], but it needs large amounts of data at the district level for implementation and operation.\n\nUBEMs include features such as the location, geometries, and various other attributes of interest like building footprint, usage, material, roof type, immediate surroundings, and the like. ML can be used to held predict energy consumption from such features. For example, Kolter and Ferreira used Gaussian process regression to predict energy use from features such as property class or the presence of central air conditioning [444]. Based on energy data disclosed by residents of New York City, Kontokosta and colleagues used various ML methods to predict the energy use of the city's 1.1 million buildings [448], analyzed the effect of energy disclosure on the demand [610], and developed a system for ranking buildings based on energy efficiency [611]. Zhang et al. [879] matched residential energy consumption survey data with public use microdata samples to estimate residential energy consumption at the neighborhood level. Using five commonly accessible features of buildings and climate, Robinson et al. predict commercial building energy use across large American cities [689].\n\nBeyond energy prediction, buildings’ features can be used by ML algorithms to pinpoint which buildings have the highest retrofit potential. Simple building characteristics and surrounding environmental factors—both potentially available at scale—can be used [83, 432].\n\nThere have also been attempts to upscale individual-building energy models to the district scale. Using deep neural networks for hybrid ML-physical modelling, Nutkiewicz et al. provided precise energy demand forecasts that account for inter-building energy dynamics and urban microclimate factors for all buildings on a campus [589].\n\nGathering infrastructure data.\n\nSpecifics about building infrastructure can often be predicted using ML techniques. Remote sensing is key to inferring infrastructure data [79, 224, 339, 496, 535, 868] as satellite data present a source of information that is globally available and largely consistent worldwide. For example, using remote sensing data, Geiß et al. [273] clustered buildings into types to assess the potential of district heat in a German town.\n\nThe resolution of infrastructure data ranges from coarse localization of all buildings at the global scale [224], to precise 3D reconstruction of a neighborhood [79]. It is possible to produce a global map of human settlement footprints at meter-level resolution from satellite radar images [224]. For this, Esch et al. used highly automated learners, which make classification at such scale possible by retraining locally. Segmentation of high-resolution satellite images can now generate exact building footprints at a national scale [535]. Energy-relevant building attributes, such as the presence of photovoltaic panels, can also be retrieved from these images [868] (see Section 2.1.1). To generate 3D models, LiDAR data are often used to retrieve heights or classify buildings at city scale [339, 496], but its collection is expensive. Recent research showed that heights can be predicted even without such elevation data, as demonstrated by [77, 537], who predicted these from real estate records, census data and features characterizing the neighborhood of each building. Studies, which for now are small scale, aim for complete 3D reconstruction with class labels for different components of buildings [79].\n\n4.3 The Future of Cities\n\nSince most of the resources of the world are ultimately channeled into cities, municipal governments have a unique opportunity to mitigate climate change. City governments regulate (and sometimes operate) transportation, buildings, and economic activity. They handle such diverse issues as energy, water, waste, crime, health, and noise. Recently, data and ML have become more common for improving efficiency in such areas, giving rise to the notion of smart city. While the phrase smart city encompasses a wide array of technologies [579], here we discuss only applications that are relevant to reducing GHG emissions.\n\nData for smart cities.\n\nIncreasingly, important aspects of city life come with digital information that can make the city function in a more coordinated way. Habibzadeh et al. [319] differentiate between hard-sensing, i.e., fixed-location-dedicated sensors like traffic cameras, and soft-sensing, for example, from mobile devices. Hard sensing is the primary data collection paradigm in many smart city applications, as it is adapted to precisely meet the application requirements. However, there is a growing volume of data coming from soft sensing, due to the widespread adoption of personal devices like smartphones that can provide movement data and geotagged pictures. Urban computing [886] is an emerging field looking at data analytics in urban spaces, and aiming to yield insights for data-driven policies. For example, clustering anonymized credit card payments makes it possible to model different communities and lifestyles—of which the sustainability can be assessed [181]. Jiang et al. provides a review of urban computing from mobile phone traces [391]. Relevant information on the urban space can also be learned from social media activity, e.g., on Twitter, as reviewed in [367, 703]. There are, however, numerous challenges in making sense of this wealth of data (see [558]), and privacy considerations are of paramount importance when collecting or working with many of these data sources.\n\nFirst, cities need to obtain relevant data on activities that directly or indirectly consume energy, and such data are often proprietary. To obtain these data, the city of Los Angeles now requires all mobility as a service providers, i.e., vehicle-sharing companies, to use an open-source application programming interface. Data such as location, use, and condition of all those vehicles, which can be useful in guiding regulation, are thus transmitted to the city [134]. ML can also distill information on urban issues related to climate change through web-scraping and text-mining, e.g., [775]. As discussed above (Section 4.2), ML can also be used to infer infrastructure data.\n\nSecond, smart city applications must transmit high volumes of data in real-time. ML is key to preprocessing large amounts of data in large sensor networks, allowing only what is relevant to be transmitted, instead of all the raw data that is being collected [480, 672, 804]. Similar techniques also help to reduce the amount of energy consumed during transmission itself [563].\n\nThird, urban policy-making based on intelligent infrastructure faces major challenges with data management [286]. Smart cities require the integration of multiple large and heterogeneous sources of data, for which ML can be a valuable tool, which includes data matching [89, 190], data fusion [885], and ensemble learning [451].\n\nLow-emissions infrastructure.\n\nWhen smart city projects are properly integrated into urban planning, they can make cities more sustainable and foster low-carbon lifestyles (see [563, 602, 853] for extensive reviews on this topic). Different types of infrastructure interact, meaning that planning strategies should be coordinated to achieve mitigation goals. For instance, urban sprawl influences the energy use from transport, as wider cities tend to be more car-oriented [151, 189, 228]. ML-based analysis has shown that the development of efficient public transportation is dependent on both the extent of urban sprawl and the local development around transportation hubs [547, 737].\n\nCities can reduce GHG emissions by coordinating between infrastructure sectors and better adapting services to the needs of the inhabitants. ML and AI can help, for example, to coordinate district heating and cooling networks, solar power generation, and charging stations for EVs and bikes [602], and can improve public lighting systems by regulating light intensity based on historical patterns of foot traffic [169]. Due to inherent variability in energy demand and supply, there is a need for uncertainty estimation, e.g., using Markov chain Monte Carlo methods or Gaussian processes [602].\n\nCurrently, most smart city projects for urban climate change mitigation are implemented in wealthier regions such as the United States, China, and the European Union. The literature on city-scale mitigation strategies is also strongly biased towards the Global North [466], while key mitigation challenges are expected to arise from the Global South [570]. Infrastructure models described in Section 4.2 could be used to plan low-carbon neighborhoods without relying on advanced smart city technologies. To transfer strategies across cities, it is possible to cluster similar cities based on climate-relevant dimensions [326, 494]. Creutzig et al. [151] related the energy use of 300 cities worldwide to historical structural factors such as fuel taxes (which have a strong impact on urban sprawl). Other relevant applications include groupings of transportation systems [326] using a latent class choice model, or of street networks [494] to identify common patterns in urban development using hierarchical clustering.\n\n4.4 Discussion\n\nWe have shown many different ways that ML can help to reduce GHG emissions from buildings and cities. A central challenge in this sector is the availability of high-quality data for training the algorithms, which rarely go beyond main cities or represent the full spectrum of building types. Techniques for obtaining these data, however, can themselves be an important application for ML (e.g., via computer vision algorithms to parse satellite imagery). Realizing the potential of data-driven urban infrastructure can advance mitigation goals while improving the well-being of citizens [50, 150, 802].\n\n5 Industry by Anna Waldman-Brown\n\nIndustrial production, logistics, and building materials are leading causes of difficult-to-eliminate GHG emissions [162]. Fortunately for ML researchers, the global industrial sector spends billions of dollars annually gathering data on factories and supply chains [310]—aided by improvements in the cost and accessibility of sensors and other data-gathering mechanisms (such as QR codes and image recognition). The availability of large quantities of data, combined with affordable cloud-based storage and computing, indicates that industry may be an excellent place for ML to make a positive climate impact.\n\nML demonstrates considerable potential for reducing industrial GHG emissions under the following circumstances:\n\nWhen there is enough accessible, high-quality data around specific processes or transport routes.\n\nWhen firms have an incentive to share their proprietary data and/or algorithms with researchers and other firms.\n\nWhen aspects of production or shipping can be readily fine-tuned or adjusted, and there are clear objective functions.\n\nWhen firms’ incentives align with reducing emissions (for example, through efficiency gains, regulatory compliance, or high GHG prices).\n\nIn particular, ML can potentially reduce global emissions (Figure 4) by helping to streamline supply chains, improve production quality, predict machine breakdowns, optimize heating and cooling systems, and prioritize the use of clean electricity over fossil fuels [74, 227, 416, 880]. However, it is worth noting that greater efficiency may increase the production of goods and thus GHG emissions (via rebound effects) unless industrial actors have sufficient incentives to reduce overall emissions [748].\n\n5.1 Optimizing Supply Chains\n\nIn 2006, at least two Scottish seafood firms flew hundreds of metric tons of shrimp from Scotland to China and Thailand for peeling, then back to Scotland for sale—because they could save on labor costs [147]. This indicates the complexity of today's globalized supply chains, i.e., the organizational processes and shipping networks that are required to bring a product from producer to final consumer. ML can help reduce emissions in supply chains by intelligently predicting supply and demand, identifying lower-carbon products, and optimizing shipping routes. (For details on shipping and delivery optimization, see Section 3.) However, for many of these applications to reduce emissions, firms’ financial incentives must also align with climate change mitigation through carbon pricing or other policy mechanisms.\n\nReducing overproduction.\n\nThe production, shipment, and climate-controlled warehousing of excess products is a major source of industrial GHG emissions, particularly for time-dependent goods such as perishable food or retail goods that quickly fall out of fashion [828]. Global excess inventory in 2011 amounted to about $8 trillion worth of goods, according to the Council of Supply Chain Management Professionals [847]. This excess may be in part due to mis-estimation of demand, as the same organization noted that corporate sales estimates diverged from actual sales by an average of 40% [847]. ML may be able to mitigate these issues of overproducing and/or overstocking goods by improving demand forecasting [12, 797]. For example, the clothing industry sells an average of only 60% of its wares at full price, but some brands can sell up to 85% due to just-in-time manufacturing and clever intelligence networks [294]. As online shopping and just-in-time manufacturing become more prevalent and websites offer more product types than physical storefronts, better demand forecasts will be needed on a regional level to efficiently distribute inventory without letting unwanted goods travel long distances only to languish in warehouses [685]. Nonetheless, negative side effects can be significant depending on the type of product and regional characteristics; just-in-time manufacturing and online shopping are often responsible for enabling product fads with shorter lifespans, in addition to smaller and faster shipments of goods (mostly by road) that lack the energy efficiency of freight aggregation and slower shipping methods such as rail [685, 799].\n\nRecommender systems.\n\nRecommender systems can potentially direct consumers and purchasing firms toward climate-friendly options, as long as one can obtain information about GHG emissions throughout the entire life-cycle of some product. The challenge here lies in hunting down usable data on every relevant material and production process from metal ore extraction through production, shipping, and eventual use and disposal of a product [336, 674]. One must also convince companies to share proprietary data to help other firms learn from best practices. If these datasets can be acquired, ML algorithms could hypothetically assist in identifying the cleanest options.\n\nReducing food waste.\n\nGlobally, society loses or wastes 1.3 billion metric tons of food each year, which translates to one-third of all food produced for human consumption [316]. In developing countries, 40% of food waste occurs between harvest and processing or retail, while over 40% of food waste in industrialized nations occurs at the end of supply chains, in retail outlets, restaurants, and consumers’ homes [316]. ML can help reduce food waste by optimizing delivery routes and improving demand forecasting at the point of sale (see Section 5.1), as well as improving refrigeration systems [532] (see Section 5.3). ML can also potentially assist with other issues related to food waste, such as helping develop sensors to identify when produce is about to spoil, so it can be sold faster or removed from a storage crate before it ruins the rest of the shipment [256].\n\n5.2 Improving Materials\n\nClimate-friendly construction.\n\nCement and steel production together account for over 10% of all global GHG emissions [243]; the cement industry alone emits more GHGs than every country except the USA and China [477]. ML can help minimize these emissions by reducing the need for carbon-intensive materials, by transforming industrial processes to run on low-carbon energy, and even by redesigning the chemistry of structural materials. To reduce the use of cement and steel, researchers have combined ML with generative design to develop structural products that require less raw material, thus reducing the resulting GHG emissions [416]. Novel manufacturing techniques such as 3D printing allow for the production of unusual shapes that use less material but may be impossible to produce through traditional metal-casting or poured concrete; ML and finite element modeling have been used to simulate the physical processes of 3D printing in order to improve the quality of finished products [62].\n\nAssuming future advances in materials science, ML research could potentially draw upon open databases such as the Materials Project [380] and the UCI Machine Learning Repository [271] to invent new, climate-friendly materials [830]. Using semi-supervised generative models and concrete compression data, for example, Ge et al. proposed novel, low-emission concrete formulas that could satisfy desired structural characteristics [271].\n\nClimate-friendly chemicals.\n\nResearchers are also experimenting with supervised learning and thermal imaging systems to rapidly identify promising catalysts and chemical reactions [140, 686], as described in Section 2.1.1. Firms are unlikely to adopt new materials or change existing practices without financial incentives, so widespread adoption might require subsidies for low-carbon alternatives or penalties for high GHG emissions.\n\nAmmonia production for fertilizer use relies upon natural gas to heat up and catalyze the reaction, and accounts for around 2% of global energy consumption [551]. To develop cleaner ammonia, chemists may be able to invent electrochemical strategies for lower-temperature ammonia production [551, 849]. Given the potential of ML for predicting chemical reactions [140], ML may also be able to help with the discovery of new materials for electrocatalysts and/or proton conductors to facilitate ammonia production.\n\n5.3 Production and Energy\n\nML can potentially assist in reducing overall electricity consumption, streamlining factories’ HVAC systems, and developing models for electrifying industrial processes so they can be run on low-carbon energy instead of coal, oil, or natural gas [305]. Again, the higher the incentives for reducing carbon emissions, the more likely that firms will optimize for low-carbon energy use. New factory equipment can be very expensive to purchase and set up, so firms’ cost–benefit calculations may dissuade them from retrofitting existing factories to run using low-carbon electricity or to save a few kilowatts [288, 633, 778]. Given the heterogeneity across industrial sectors and the secrecy of industrial data, firms will also need to tailor the requisite sensors and data analysis systems to their individual processes. ML will become a much more viable option for industry when factory workers can identify, develop, implement, and monitor their own solutions internally instead of relying upon outside experts [337]. The ML community can assist by building accessible, customizable industry tools (i.e., “low-code” or “no-code” user interfaces) tailored for people without a strong background in data science.\n\nAdaptive control.\n\nOn the production side, ML can potentially improve the efficiency of HVAC systems and other industrial control mechanisms—if given necessary data about all relevant processes. To reduce GHG emissions from HVAC systems, researchers have suggested combining optimization-based control algorithms with ML techniques such as image recognition, regression trees, and time delay neural networks [5, 202] (see also 4.1). DeepMind has used RL to optimize cooling centers for Google's internal servers by predicting and optimizing the power usage effectiveness, thus lowering HFC emissions and reducing cooling costs [227, 268]. Deep neural networks could also be used for adaptive control in a variety of industrial networking applications [8], enabling energy savings through self-learning about devices’ surroundings.\n\nPredictive maintenance.\n\nML could also contribute to predictive maintenance (see also Sections 2.2 and 9.2) by more accurately modelling the wear and tear of machinery that is currently in use, and interpretable ML could assist factory owners in developing a better understanding of how best to minimize GHG emissions for specific equipment and processes. For example, creating a digital twin model of some industrial equipment or process could enable a manufacturer to virtually experiment with a new piece of code before uploading it to the factory floor, and to test out scenarios for lower GHG emissions without slowing down production [290, 777]. Digital twins can also reduce production waste by identifying broken or about-to-break machines before the actual factory equipment starts producing damaged products. Industrial systems can employ similar models to predict which pipes are liable to spring leaks, thus minimizing the direct release of GHGs such as HFCs and natural gas.\n\nUsing cleaner electricity.\n\nML may be particularly useful for enabling more flexible operation of industrial electrical loads, through optimizing a firm's demand response to electricity prices (see also Section 2). Such optimization can contribute to cutting GHG emissions as long as firms have a financial incentive to optimize for minimal emissions, maximal low-carbon energy, or minimum overall power usage. Demand response optimization algorithms can help firms adjust the timing of energy-intensive processes such as cement crushing [880] and powder-coating [43] to take advantage of electricity price fluctuations, although published work on the topic has to date used relatively little ML. Online algorithms for optimizing demand response can reduce overall power usage for computer servers by dynamically shifting the internet traffic load of data providers to underutilized servers, although most of this research, again, has focused on minimizing costs rather than GHG emissions [99, 352]. Berral et al. proposed a framework that demonstrates how such optimization algorithms might be combined with RL, digitized controls, and feedback systems to enable the autonomous control of industrial processes [74].\n\n5.4 Discussion\n\nGiven the globalized nature of international trade and the urgency of climate change, decarbonizing the industrial sector is becoming a key priority for both policymakers and factory owners worldwide. Many companies are now writing decarbonization strategies in response to increasing pressure from governments, financial institutions, and stockholders (see, e.g., [620, 793]). These strategies are evolving rapidly, using ML alongside many approaches not covered here.\n\nAs we have seen, there are a number of highly impactful applications where ML can help reduce GHG emissions in industry, with several caveats. First, incentives for cleaner production and distribution are not always aligned with reduced costs, though policies can play a role in aligning these incentives. Second, despite the proliferation of industrial data, much of the information is proprietary, low-quality, or very specific to individual machines or processes; practitioners estimate that 60%–70% of collected industrial data goes unused [138, 310]. Before investing in extensive ML research, researchers should be sure that they will be able to eventually access and clean any data needed for their algorithms. Finally, misjudgments can be very costly for manufacturers and retailers, leading most managers to adopt risk-averse strategies towards relatively untested technologies such as ML [337]. For this reason, ML algorithms that determine industrial activities should be robust enough to guarantee both performance and safety, along with providing both interpretable and reproducible results [338, 709].\n\n6 Farms & Forests by Alexandre Lacoste\n\nPlants, microbes, and other organisms have been drawing CO$_2$ from the atmosphere for millions of years. Most of this carbon is continually broken down and recirculated through the carbon cycle, and some is stored deep underground, e.g., as fossil fuels, but a large amount of carbon is sequestered in the biomass of trees, peat bogs, and soil. Our current economy encourages practices that are freeing much of this sequestered carbon through deforestation and unsustainable agriculture. On top of these effects, cattle and rice farming generate methane, a GHG far more potent than CO$_2$ itself. Overall, land use by humans is estimated to be responsible for about a quarter of global GHG emissions [370] (and this may be an underestimate [511]). In addition to this direct release of carbon through human actions, the permafrost is now melting, peat bogs are drying, and forest fires are becoming more frequent as a consequence of climate change itself – all of which release yet more carbon [573].\n\nThe large scale of this problem allows for a similar scale of positive impact. According to one estimate [335], about a third of GHG emissions reductions could come from better land management and agriculture. ML can play an important role in some of these areas. Precision agriculture could reduce carbon release from the soil and improve crop yield, which in turn could reduce the need for deforestation. Satellite images make it possible to estimate the amount of carbon sequestered in a given area of land, as well as track GHG emissions from it. ML can help monitor the health of forests and peatlands, predict the risk of fire, and contribute to sustainable forestry (Figure 5). These areas represent highly impactful applications, in particular, of sophisticated computer vision tools, though care must be taken in some cases to ensure that ML tools are used in ways aligned with decarbonization.\n\n6.1 Remote Sensing of Emissions\n\nHaving real-time maps of GHGs could help us quantify emissions from agriculture and forestry practices, which remain relatively uncertain [371], as well as monitor emissions from other sectors (Section 2.2).\n\nSuch information would be valuable in guiding regulations or incentives that could lead to better land use practices. For example, data on emissions make it possible to set effective targets, and pinpointing the sources of emissions makes it possible to enforce regulations.\n\nWhile GHGs are invisible to our eyes, they must by definition interact with sunlight. This means that we can observe these compounds with hyperspectral cameras [428, 711]. These cameras can record up to several hundred different wavelengths (instead of simply red, green, and blue [RGB]), providing information on the interaction between light and individual chemicals. Many satellites are equipped with such cameras and can perform, to some extent, estimations of CO$_2$, CH$_4$ (methane), H$_2$O, and N$_2$O (nitrous oxide) emissions [73, 378]. While extremely useful for studying climate change, most of these satellites have very coarse spatial resolution and large temporal and spatial gaps, making them unsuitable for precise tracking of emissions. Standard satellite imagery provides RGB images with much higher resolution, which could be used in an ML algorithm to fill the gaps in hyperspectral data and obtain more precise information about emissions. Some preliminary work [378] has studied this possibility, but this remains largely an open problem with high potential impact.\n\n6.2 Precision Agriculture\n\nCrop production is a significant source of GHG emissions. This might come as a surprise, since plants take up CO$_2$ from the air. However, modern industrial crop production involves more than just growing plants. First, the land is generally stripped of existing vegetation, releasing carbon sequestered there. Second, the process of tilling exposes topsoil to the air, thereby releasing carbon that had been bound in soil aggregates and disrupting organisms in the soil that contribute to sequestration. Finally, because such farming practices strip soil of nutrients, nitrogen-based fertilizers must be added back to the system. Synthesizing these fertilizers consumes massive amounts of energy, about 2% of global energy consumption [551] (see Section 5.2). Moreover, while some of this nitrogen is absorbed by plants or retained in the soil, some is converted to nitrous oxide, a GHG that is about 300 times more potent than CO$_2$.\n\nSuch industrial agriculture approaches are ultimately based on making farmland more uniform and predictable. This allows it to be managed at scale using basic automation tools like tractors, but can be both more destructive and less productive than approaches that work with the natural heterogeneity of land and crops. Increasingly, there is demand for sophisticated tools which would allow farmers to work at scale, but adapt to what the land needs. This approach is often known as “precision agriculture.”\n\nSmarter robotic tools can help enable precision agriculture. Robots are under development, for example, with the ability to perform mechanical weeding, targeted pesticide application, and vacuuming of pests [766], as well as the collection of large datasets for continual improvement [68]. Many corporate players now exist in the space of ML-aided robotics for precision agriculture [80, 212, 742, 788]. There remains significant room for development, since many tasks remain challenging for robots, and furthermore there are a large number of specific tasks and agricultural settings to consider.\n\nThere are many additional ways in which ML can contribute to precision agriculture. Intelligent irrigation systems can save large amounts of water while reducing pests that thrive under excessive moisture [335]. ML can also help in disease detection, weed detection, and soil sensing [482, 699, 821]. ML can guide crop yield prediction [866] and even macroeconomic models that help farmers predict crop demand and decide what to plant at the beginning of the season [503]. These problems often have minimal hardware requirements, as devices such as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) with hyperspectral cameras can be used for all of these tasks.\n\nGlobally, agriculture constitutes a $2.4 trillion industry [785], and there is already a significant economic incentive to increase efficiency. However, efficiency gains do not necessarily translate into reduced GHG emissions (e.g., via rebound effects increasing consumption of particularly emissions-intensive products). Moreover, significantly reducing emissions may require a shift in agricultural paradigms, for example, widespread adoption of regenerative agriculture, silvopasture, and tree intercropping [335]. ML tools for policymakers and agronomists [126] could potentially encourage climate-positive action: for example, remote sensing with UAVs and satellites could perform methane detection and carbon stock estimation, which could be used to incentivize farmers to sequester more carbon and reduce emissions.\n\n6.3 Monitoring Peatlands\n\nPeatlands (a type of wetland ecosystem) cover only 3% of the Earth's land area,"
