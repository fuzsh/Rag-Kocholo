        "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat does not transactivate mature trans-acting responsive region RNA species in the nucleus or cytoplasm of primate cells.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChin, D J; Selby, M J; Peterlin, B M\n\n1991-01-01\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-encoded transactivator Tat is essential for viral gene expression and replication. By interacting with a nascent RNA stem-loop called the trans-acting responsive region (TAR). Tat increases rates of initiation and/or elongation of HIV transcription. Several reports have also suggested that Tat has additional effects on mature HIV RNA species including modification of primary transcripts in the nucleus and their increased translation in the cytoplasm. These posttranscriptional effects are most pronounced in the Xenopus oocyte. To investigate directly whether Tat has similar effects on viral transcripts in cells that are permissive for HIV replication, we cotransfected and microinjected human and monkey cells with Tat and TAR in the form of DNA or RNA. Whereas Tat transactivated TAR DNA targets, it did not transactivate TAR RNA targets in the nucleus of microinjected cells or in the cytoplasm of transfected cells. We conclude that in cells permissive for viral replication, Tat exerts its effect primarily at the level of HIV transcription.

It was shown Tat induced HIV-1 transactivation through inhibiting EZH2 activity. Tat decreased the levels of H3K27me3 and EZH2 occupy at the long terminal repeat (LTR) of HIV-1. We further showed for the first time that transfected with Tat construct resulted in an increase in phosphorylated EZH2 (p-EZH2), mediated by active Akt. ROS/Akt-dependent p-EZH2 was correlated with Tat-induced transactivation. Our study reveals that novel mechanisms allow Tat-induced HIV-1 transactivation by ROS/Akt-dependent downregulating the EZH2 epigenetic silencing machinery.

Tat, a potent activator of HIV-1 gene expression, serves to greatly increase the rate of transcription directed by the viral promoter. This induction, which seems to be an important component in the progression of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), may be due to increased transcriptional initiation, increased transcriptional elongation, or a combination of these processes. Much attention has been focused on the interaction of Tat with a specific RNA target termed TAR (transactivation responsive) which is present in the leader sequence of all HIV-1 mRNAs. This interaction is believed to be an important component of the mechanism of transactivation. In this report we demonstrate that in certain CNS-derived cells Tat is capable of activating HIV-1 through a TAR-independent pathway. A Tat-responsive element is found upstream within the viral promoter that in glial-derived cell lines allows transactivation in the absence of TAR. Deletion mapping and hybrid promoter constructs demonstrate that the newly identified Tat-responsive element corresponds to a sequence within the viral long terminal repeat (LTR) previously identified as the HIV-1 enhancer, or NF-kappa B domain. DNA band-shift analysis reveals NF-kappa B binding activity in glial cells that differs from that present in T lymphoid cells. Further, we observe that TAR-deleted mutants of HIV-1 demonstrate normal late gene expression in glial cells as evidenced by syncytia formation and production of viral p24 antigen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Images PMID:1505523\n\nSite-specific cleavage of the transactivation response site of human immunodeficiency virus RNA with a tat-based chemical nuclease.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJayasena, S D; Johnston, B H\n\n1992-01-01\n\ntat, an essential transactivator of gene transcription in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), is believed to activate viral gene expression by binding to the transactivation response (TAR) site located at the 5' end of all viral mRNAs. The TAR element forms a stem-loop structure containing a 3-nucleotide bulge that is the site for tat binding and is required for transactivation. Here we report the synthesis of a site-specific chemical ribonuclease based on the TAR binding domain of the HIV type 1 (HIV-1) tat. A peptide consisting of this 24-amino acid domain plus an additional C-terminal cysteine residue was chemically synthesized and covalently linked to 1,10-phenanthroline at the cysteine residue. The modified peptide binds to TAR sequences of both HIV-1 and HIV-2 and, in the presence of cupric ions and a reducing agent, cleaves these RNAs at specific sites. Cleavage sites on TAR sequences are consistent with peptide binding to the 3-nucleotide bulge, and the relative displacement of cleavage sites on the two strands suggests peptide binding to the major groove of the RNA. These results and existing evidence of the rapid cellular uptake of tat-derived peptides suggest that chemical nucleases based on tat may be useful for inactivating HIV mRNA in vivo.

These variants with an undiminished virulence can multiply rapidly in order to progress to AIDS. One of the targets to intervene in HIV-1 replication is the trans -activator of transcription (Tat), a major regulatory protein that transactivates the long terminal repeat promoter through its interaction with trans -activation response (TAR) RNA. In this study, HIV-1 infected patients ( n = 120) from North India revealed Ser46Phe (20%) and Ser61Arg (2%) mutations in the Tat variants with a strong interaction toward TAR leading to enhanced transactivation activities. Molecular dynamics simulation data verified that the variants with this mutation had a higher binding affinity for TAR than both the wild-type Tat and other variants that lacked Ser46Phe and Ser61Arg. Other mutations in Tat conferred varying affinities for TAR interaction leading to differential transactivation abilities. This is the first report from North India with a clinical validation of CD4 counts to demonstrate the influence of Tat genetic variations affecting the stability of Tat and its interaction with TAR. This study highlights the co-evolution pattern of Tat and predominant nucleotides for Tat activity, facilitating the identification of genetic determinants for the attenuation of viral gene expression.\n\nActivation of HIV Transcription by the Viral Tat Protein Requires a Demethylation Step Mediated by Lysine-specific Demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSakane, Naoki; Kwon, Hye-Sook; Pagans, Sara; Kaehlcke, Katrin; Mizusawa, Yasuhiro; Kamada, Masafumi; Lassen, Kara G.; Chan, Jonathan; Greene, Warner C.; Schnoelzer, Martina; Ott, Melanie\n\n2011-01-01\n\nThe essential transactivator function of the HIV Tat protein is regulated by multiple posttranslational modifications. Although individual modifications are well characterized, their crosstalk and dynamics of occurrence during the HIV transcription cycle remain unclear. We examine interactions between two critical modifications within the RNA-binding domain of Tat: monomethylation of lysine 51 (K51) mediated by Set7/9/KMT7, an early event in the Tat transactivation cycle that strengthens the interaction of Tat with TAR RNA, and acetylation of lysine 50 (K50) mediated by p300/KAT3B, a later process that dissociates the complex formed by Tat, TAR RNA and the cyclin T1 subunit of the positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). We find K51 monomethylation inhibited in synthetic Tat peptides carrying an acetyl group at K50 while acetylation can occur in methylated peptides, albeit at a reduced rate. To examine whether Tat is subject to sequential monomethylation and acetylation in cells, we performed mass spectrometry on immunoprecipitated Tat proteins and generated new modification-specific Tat antibodies against monomethylated/acetylated Tat. No bimodified Tat protein was detected in cells pointing to a demethylation step during the Tat transactivation cycle. We identify lysine-specific demethylase 1 (LSD1/KDM1) as a Tat K51-specific demethylase, which is required for the activation of HIV transcription in latently infected T cells. LSD1/KDM1 and its cofactor CoREST associates with the HIV promoter in vivo and activate Tat transcriptional activity in a K51-dependent manner. In addition, small hairpin RNAs directed against LSD1/KDM1 or inhibition of its activity with the monoamine oxidase inhibitor phenelzine suppresses the activation of HIV transcription in latently infected T cells. Our data support the model that a LSD1/KDM1/CoREST complex, normally known as a transcriptional suppressor, acts as a novel activator of HIV transcription through demethylation\n\nA Minimal Chimera of Human Cyclin T1 and Tat Binds TAR and Activates Human Immunodeficiency Virus Transcription in Murine Cells\n\nPubMed Central\n\nFujinaga, Koh; Irwin, Dan; Taube, Ran; Zhang, Fan; Geyer, Matthias; Peterlin, B. Matija\n\n2002-01-01\n\nThe transcriptional elongation of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) is mediated by the virally encoded transactivator Tat and its cellular cofactor, positive transcription elongation factor b (P-TEFb). The human cyclin T1 (hCycT1) subunit of P-TEFb forms a stable complex with Tat and the transactivation response element (TAR) RNA located at the 5â² end of all viral transcripts. Previous studies have demonstrated that hCycT1 binds Tat in a Zn2+-dependent manner via the cysteine at position 261, which is a tyrosine in murine cyclin T1. In the present study, we mutated all other cysteines and histidines that could be involved in this Zn2+-dependent interaction. Because all of these mutant proteins except hCycT1(C261Y) activated viral transcription in murine cells, no other cysteine or histidine in hCycT1 is responsible for this interaction. Next, we fused the N-terminal 280 residues in hCycT1 with Tat. Not only the full-length chimera but also the mutant hCycT1 with an N-terminal deletion to position 249, which retained the Tat-TAR recognition motif, activated HIV-1 transcription in murine cells. This minimal hybrid mutant hCycT1-Tat protein bound TAR RNA as well as human and murine P-TEFb in vitro. We conclude that this minimal chimera not only reproduces the high-affinity binding among P-TEFb, Tat, and TAR but also will be invaluable for determining the three-dimensional structure of this RNA-protein complex.

Quantitative analysis of the efficiency of elongation revealed that a majority of the elongation complexes generated by the HIV-1 promoter were not highly processive and terminated within the first 500 nucleotides. Tat trans-activation of transcription from the HIV-1 promoter resulted from an increase in processive character of the elongation complexes. More specifically, the analysis suggests that there exist two classes of elongation complexes initiating from the HIV promoter: a less-processive form and a more-processive form. Addition of purified Tat protein was found to increase the abundance of the more-processive class of elongation complex. The purine nucleoside analog, 5,6-dichloro-1-beta-D-ribofuranosylbenzimidazole (DRB) inhibits transcription in this reaction by decreasing the efficiency of elongation. Surprisingly, stimulation of transcription elongation by Tat was preferentially inhibited by the addition of DRB.

In this study, TAT was conjugated with Distearoyl phosphatidylethanolamine-(polyethylene glycol) 2000 -maleimide (DSPE-PEG 2000 -Mal) to obtain TAT-PEG 2000 -DSPE. TAT-NLCs-LID were successfully prepared and characterized by determination of their particle size, morphology, drug encapsulation efficiency and in vitro drug release behavior. The skin permeation of LID-LNPs was examined using a Franz diffusion cell mounted with depilated mouse skin in vitro and in vivo anesthesia effect was evaluated on mice. The results showed that TAT-NLCs-LID have substantially small mean diameter (157.9ânm) and high encapsulation efficiency (81.8%). From the in vitro skin permeation results, transdermal flux of TAT-NLCs-LID was about several times higher than that of LID solution and NLCs-LID. In vivo anesthesia effect evaluation illustrated that TAT-NLCs-LID can enhance the transdermal delivery of LID by reducing the pain threshold in mice. These results indicate that the novel TAT containing drug delivery system is very useful for overcoming the barrier function of the skin and could deliver anesthetic through the skin. TAT-NLCs-LID could function as promising topical anesthetic system.\n\nChemical synthesis of biologically active tat trans-activating protein of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChun, R; Glabe, C G; Fan, H\n\n1990-01-01\n\nFull-length (86-residue) polypeptide corresponding to the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 tat trans-activating protein was chemically synthesized on a semiautomated apparatus, using an Fmoc amino acid continuous-flow strategy. The bulk material was relatively homogeneous, as judged by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and isoelectric focusing, and it showed trans-activating activity when scrape loaded into cells containing a human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat-chloramphenicol acetyl-transferase reporter plasmid. Reverse-phase high-pressure liquid chromatography yielded a rather broad elution profile, and assays across the column for biological activity indicated a sharper peak. Thus, high-pressure liquid chromatography provided for enrichment of biological activity. Fast atom bombardment-mass spectrometry of tryptic digests of synthetic tat identified several of the predicted tryptic peptides, consistent with accurate chemical synthesis.

A reconstituted reaction that is Tat-specific and TAR-dependent for activation of HIV transcription has been used to identify and partially purify a cellular activity that is required for trans-activation by Tat, but not by other activators. In the reaction, Tat stimulates the efficiency of elongation by polymerase, whereas Sp1 and other DNA sequence-specific transcription factors activate the rate of initiation. Furthermore, while TATA binding protein (TBP)-associated factors (TAFs) in the TFIID complex are required for activation by transcription factors, they are dispensable for Tat function. Thus, Tat acts through a novel mechanism, which is mediated by a specific host cellular factor, to stimulate HIV-1 gene expression.

Iron(II) supramolecular helicates were evaluated for their in vitro activity to inhibit Tat-TAR RNA interaction using UV melting studies, electrophoretic mobility shift assay, and RNase A footprinting. The results demonstrate that iron(II) supramolecular helicates inhibit Tat-TAR interaction at nanomolar concentrations by binding to TAR RNA. These studies provide a new insight into the biological potential of metallosupramolecular helicates.\n\nA novel local anesthetic system: transcriptional transactivator peptide-decorated nanocarriers for skin delivery of ropivacaine.\n\nPubMed\n\nChen, Chuanyu; You, Peijun\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBarrier properties of the skin and physicochemical properties of drugs are the main factors for the delivery of local anesthetic molecules. The present work evaluates the anesthetic efficacy of drug-loaded nanocarrier (NC) systems for the delivery of local anesthetic drug, ropivacaine (RVC). In this study, transcriptional transactivator peptide (TAT)-decorated RVC-loaded NCs (TAT-RVC/NCs) were successfully fabricated. Physicochemical properties of NCs were determined in terms of particle size, zeta potential, drug encapsulation efficiency, drug-loading capacity, stability, and in vitro drug release. The skin permeation of NCs was examined using a Franz diffusion cell mounted with depilated mouse skin in vitro, and in vivo anesthetic effect was evaluated in mice. The results showed that TAT-RVC/NCs have a mean diameter of 133.2 nm and high drug-loading capacity of 81.7%. From the in vitro skin permeation results, it was observed that transdermal flux of TAT-RVC/NCs was higher than that of RVC-loaded NCs (RVC/NCs) and RVC injection. The evaluation of in vivo anesthetic effect illustrated that TAT-RVC/NCs can enhance the transdermal delivery of RVC by reducing the pain threshold in mice. These results indicate that TAT-decorated NCs systems are useful for overcoming the barrier function of the skin, decreasing the dosage of RVC and enhancing the anesthetic effect. Therefore, TAT-decorated NCs can be used as an effective transdermal delivery system for local anesthesia.\n\nExosome-associated release, uptake, and neurotoxicity of HIV-1 Tat protein.\n\nPubMed\n\nRahimian, Pejman; He, Johnny J\n\n2016-12-01\n\nHIV-1 Tat is an indispensible transactivator for HIV gene transcription and replication. It has been shown to exit cells as a free protein and enter neighboring cells or interact with surface receptors of neighboring cells to regulate gene expression and cell function. In this study, we report, for the first time, exosome-associated Tat release and uptake. Using a HIV-1 LTR-driven luciferase reporter-based cell assay and Western blotting or in combination with exosome inhibitor, OptiPrep gradient fractionation, and exosome depletion, we demonstrated significant presence of HIV-1 Tat in exosomes derived from Tat-expressing primary astrocytes, Tat-transfected U373.MG and 293T, and HIV-infected MT4. We further showed that exosome-associated Tat from Tat-expressing astrocytes was capable of causing neurite shortening and neuron death, further supporting that this new form of extracellular Tat is biologically active. Lastly, we constructed a Tat mutant deleted of its basic domain and determined the role of the basic domain in Tat trafficking into exosomes. Basic domain-deleted Tat exhibited no apparent effects on Tat trafficking into exosomes, while maintained its dominant-negative function in Tat-mediated LTR transactivation. Taken together, these results show a significant fraction of Tat is secreted and present in the form of exosomes and may contribute to the stability of extracellular Tat and broaden the spectrum of its target cells.\n\nExtensive interactions between HIV TAT and TAF(II)250.\n\nPubMed\n\nWeissman, J D; Hwang, J R; Singer, D S\n\n2001-03-09\n\nThe HIV transactivator, Tat, has been shown to be capable of potent repression of transcription initiation. Repression is mediated by the C-terminal segment of Tat, which binds the TFIID component, TAF(II)250, although the site(s) of interaction were not defined previously. We now report that the interaction between Tat and TAF(II)250 is extensive and involves multiple contacts between the Tat protein and TAF(II)250. The C-terminal domain of Tat, which is necessary for repression of transcription initiation, binds to a segment of TAF(II)250 that encompasses its acetyl transferase (AT) domain (885-1034 amino acids (aa)). Surprisingly, the N-terminal segment of Tat, which contains its activation domains, also binds to TAF(II)250 and interacts with two discontinuous segments of TAF(II)250 located between 885 and 984 aa and 1120 and 1279 aa. Binding of Tat to the 885-984 aa segment of TAF(II)250 requires the cysteine-rich domain of Tat, but not the acidic or glutamine-rich domains. Binding by the N-terminal domain of Tat to the 1120-1279 aa TAF(II)250 segment does not involve the acidic, cysteine- or glutamine-rich domains. Repression of transcription initiation by Tat requires functional TAF(II)250. We now demonstrate that transcription of the HIV LTR does not depend on TAF(II)250 which may account for its resistance to Tat mediated repression.\n\nFBI-1 can stimulate HIV-1 Tat activity and is targeted to a novel subnuclear domain that includes the Tat-P-TEFb-containing nuclear speckles.\n\nPubMed\n\nPendergrast, P Shannon; Wang, Chen; Hernandez, Nouria; Huang, Sui\n\n2002-03-01\n\nFBI-1 is a cellular POZ-domain-containing protein that binds to the HIV-1 LTR and associates with the HIV-1 transactivator protein Tat. Here we show that elevated levels of FBI-1 specifically stimulate Tat activity and that this effect is dependent on the same domain of FBI-1 that mediates Tat-FBI-1 association in vivo. FBI-1 also partially colocalizes with Tat and Tat's cellular cofactor, P-TEFb (Cdk9 and cyclin T1), at the splicing-factor-rich nuclear speckle domain. Further, a less-soluble population of FBI-1 distributes in a novel peripheral-speckle pattern of localization as well as in other nuclear regions. This distribution pattern is dependent on the FBI-1 DNA binding domain, on the presence of cellular DNA, and on active transcription. Taken together, these results suggest that FBI-1 is a cellular factor that preferentially associates with active chromatin and that can specifically stimulate Tat-activated HIV-1 transcription.\n\nFBI-1 Can Stimulate HIV-1 Tat Activity and Is Targeted to a Novel Subnuclear Domain that Includes the Tat-P-TEFbâcontaining Nuclear Speckles\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPendergrast, P.

Grb2 (growth factor receptor-bound protein 2) is an adaptor protein that contains two SH3 domains and is involved in receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signal transduction pathways. The HIV-1 transactivator factor Tat is required for viral replication and it has been shown to bind directly or indirectly to several host proteins, deregulating their functions. In this study, we show interaction between the cellular factor Grb2 and the HIV-1 trans-activating protein Tat. The binding is mediated by the proline-rich sequence of Tat and the SH3 domain of Grb2. As the adaptor protein Grb2 participates in a wide variety of signaling pathways, we characterized at least one of the possible downstream effects of the Tat/Grb2 interaction on the well-known IGF-1R/Raf/MAPK cascade. We show that the binding of Tat to Grb2 impairs activation of the Raf/MAPK pathway, while potentiating the PKA/Raf inhibitory pathway. The Tat/Grb2 interaction affects also viral function by inhibiting the Tat-mediated transactivation of HIV-1 LTR and viral replication in infected primary microglia.

In the study reported here, we expressed Tat in tomato and observed phenotypic abnormalities, including stunted growth, absence of root formation, chlorosis, and plant death, as a result of reduced cytokinin levels. These reduced levels were ascribed to a differentially expressed CKO35 in Tat-bombarded tomato. Of the two CKO isoforms that are naturally expressed in tomato, CKO43 and CKO37, only the expression of CKO37 was affected by Tat. Our analysis of the Tat confirmed that the Arg-rich and RGD motifs of Tat have functional relevance in tomato and that independent mutations at these motifs caused inhibition of the differentially expressed CKO isoform and the extracellular secretion of the Tat protein, respectively, in our Tat-bombarded tomato samples.\n\nHIV-1 Tat affects the programming and functionality of human CD8âº T cells by modulating the expression of T-box transcription factors.\n\nPubMed\n\nSforza, Fabio; Nicoli, Francesco; Gallerani, Eleonora; Finessi, Valentina; Reali, Eva; Cafaro, Aurelio; Caputo, Antonella; Ensoli, Barbara; Gavioli, Riccardo\n\n2014-07-31\n\nHIV infection is characterized by several immune dysfunctions of both CD8âº and CD4âº T cells as hyperactivation, impairment of functionality and expansion of memory T cells. CD8âº T-cell dysfunctions have been associated with increased expression of T-bet, Eomesdermin and pro-inflammatory cytokines, and with down-regulation of CD127. The HIV-1 trans-activator of transcription (Tat) protein, which is released by infected cells and detected in tissues of HIV-positive individuals, is known to contribute to the dysregulation of CD4âº T cells; however, its effects on CD8âº T cells have not been investigated. Thus, in this study, we sought to address whether Tat may affect CD8âº T-cell functionality and programming. CD8âº T cells were activated by T-cell receptor engagement in the presence or absence of Tat. Cytokine production, killing capacity, surface phenotype and expression of transcription factors important for T-cell programming were evaluated. Tat favors the secretion of interleukin-2, interferon-Î³ and granzyme B in CD8âº T cells. Behind this functional modulation we observed that Tat increases the expression of T-bet, Eomesdermin, Blimp-1, Bcl-6 and Bcl-2 in activated but not in unstimulated CD8âº T lymphocytes. This effect is associated with the down-regulation of CD127 and the up-regulation of CD27. Tat deeply alters the programming and functionality of CD8âº T lymphocytes.\n\nSpecific binding of a HeLa cell nuclear protein to RNA sequences in the human immunodeficiency virus transactivating region.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGaynor, R; Soultanakis, E; Kuwabara, M; Garcia, J; Sigman, D S\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe transactivator protein, tat, encoded by the human immunodeficiency virus is a key regulator of viral transcription. Activation by the tat protein requires sequences downstream of the transcription initiation site called the transactivating region (TAR). RNA derived from the TAR is capable of forming a stable stem-loop structure and the maintenance of both the stem structure and the loop sequences located between +19 and +44 is required for complete in vivo activation by tat. Gel retardation assays with RNA from both wild-type and mutant TAR constructs generated in vitro with SP6 polymerase indicated specific binding of HeLa nuclear proteins to the TAR. To characterize this RNA-protein interaction, a method of chemical \"imprinting\" has been developed using photoactivated uranyl acetate as the nucleolytic agent. This reagent nicks RNA under physiological conditions at all four nucleotides in a reaction that is independent of sequence and secondary structure. Specific interaction of cellular proteins with TAR RNA could be detected by enhanced cleavages or imprints surrounding the loop region. Mutations that either disrupted stem base-pairing or extensively changed the primary sequence resulted in alterations in the cleavage pattern of the TAR RNA. Structural features of the TAR RNA stem-loop essential for tat activation are also required for specific binding of the HeLa cell nuclear protein.

The skin permeation of LID-TAT-N was examined, and compared with LID-CL and lidocaine injection (LID-IJ, as negative control), using a Franz diffusion cell mounted with depilated mouse skin in vitro for 12 hours. Each experiment was repeated six times. The anesthetic effect of the new topical anesthetic was investigated on the cornea of rabbits. The mean diameter of LID-TAT-N was smaller than that of LID-CL [(152.7 Â± 10.6) nm vs. (259.5 Â± 15.5) nm, P < 0.01]. The 12 h cumulative permeation amount was significantly higher in LID-TAT-N group [(1 340.0 Â± 97.5) Âµg Â· cm(-2)] than those of LID-CL and LID-IJ groups [(1 060.6 Â± 80.2), (282.6 Â± 65.1) Âµg Â· cm(-2), respectively, P < 0.05]. Rabbit corneal reflex results showed that LID-TAT-N had anesthetic effect and the duration of analgesia [(24.8 Â± 2.8) min] was also longer than that of LID-IJ [(14.5 Â± 2.3) min, P < 0.05]. LID-TAT-N had good transdermal ability, and the advanced skin penetration feature can improve its tropical anesthetic effect.\n\nInteraction between HIV-1 Tat and DNA-PKcs modulates HIV transcription and class switch recombination.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhang, Shi-Meng; Zhang, He; Yang, Tian-Yi; Ying, Tian-Yi; Yang, Pei-Xiang; Liu, Xiao-Dan; Tang, Sheng-Jian; Zhou, Ping-Kun\n\n2014-01-01\n\nHIV-1 tat targets a variety of host cell proteins to facilitate viral transcription and disrupts host cellular immunity by inducing lymphocyte apoptosis, but whether it influences humoral immunity remains unclear. Previously, our group demonstrated that tat depresses expression of DNA-PKcs, a critical component of the non-homologous end joining pathway (NHEJ) of DNA double-strand breaks repair, immunoglobulin class switch recombination (CSR) and V(D)J recombination, and sensitizes cells to ionizing radiation. In this study, we demonstrated that HIV-1 Tat down-regulates DNA-PKcs expression by directly binding to the core promoter sequence. In addition, Tat interacts with and activates the kinase activity of DNA-PKcs in a dose-dependent and DNA independent manner. Furthermore, Tat inhibits class switch recombination (CSR) at low concentrations (â¤ 4 Âµg/ml) and stimulates CSR at high concentrations (â¥ 8 Âµg/ml). On the other hand, low protein level and high kinase activity of DNA-PKcs promotes HIV-1 transcription, while high protein level and low kinase activity inhibit HIV-1 transcription. Co-immunoprecipitation results revealed that DNA-PKcs forms a large complex comprised of Cyclin T1, CDK9 and Tat via direct interacting with CDK9 and Tat but not Cyclin T1. Taken together, our results provide new clues that Tat regulates host humoral immunity via both transcriptional depression and kinase activation of DNA-PKcs. We also raise the possibility that inhibitors and interventions directed towards DNA-PKcs may inhibit HIV-1 transcription in AIDS patients.\n\nEffects of human chromosome 12 on interactions between Tat and TAR of human immunodeficiency virus type 1.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAlonso, A; Cujec, T P; Peterlin, B M\n\n1994-01-01\n\nRates of transcriptions of the human immunodeficiency virus are greatly increased by the viral trans activator Tat. In vitro, Tat binds to the 5' bulge of the trans-activation response (TAR) RNA stem-loop, which is present in all viral transcripts. In human cells, the central loop in TAR and its cellular RNA-binding proteins are also critical for the function of Tat. Previously, we demonstrated that in rodent cells (CHO cells), but not in those which contain the human chromosome 12 (CHO12 cells), Tat-TAR interactions are compromised. In this study, we examined the roles of the bulge and loop in TAR in Tat trans activation in these cells. Whereas low levels of trans activation depended solely on interactions between Tat and the bulge in CHO cells, high levels of trans activation depended also on interactions between Tat and the loop in CHO12 cells. Since the TAR loop binding proteins in these two cell lines were identical and different from their human counterpart, the human chromosome 12 does not encode TAR loop binding proteins. In vivo binding competition studies with TAR decoys confirmed that the binding of Tat to TAR is more efficient in CHO12 cells. Thus, the protein(s) encoded on human chromosome 12 helps to tether Tat to TAR via its loop, which results in high levels of trans activation.

The Tat-mediated transactivation (TMT) is a critical step in the HIV replication cycle that could give the opportunity to reduce the size of latent reservoirs. More than two decades of research led to the identification of various TMT inhibitors. While none of them met the criteria to reach the market, the search for a suitable TMT inhibitor is still actively pursued. Really promising compounds, including one in a Phase III clinical trial, have been recently identified, thus warranting an update.\n\nHIV-1 Tat addresses dendritic cells to induce a predominant Th1-type adaptive immune response that appears prevalent in the asymptomatic stage of infection.\n\nPubMed\n\nFanales-Belasio, Emanuele; Moretti, Sonia; Fiorelli, Valeria; Tripiciano, Antonella; Pavone Cossut, Maria R; Scoglio, Arianna; Collacchi, Barbara; Nappi, Filomena; Macchia, Iole; Bellino, Stefania; Francavilla, Vittorio; Caputo, Antonella; Barillari, Giovanni; Magnani, Mauro; Laguardia, Maria Elena; Cafaro, Aurelio; Titti, Fausto; Monini, Paolo; Ensoli, Fabrizio; Ensoli, Barbara\n\n2009-03-01\n\nTat is an early regulatory protein that plays a major role in human HIV-1 replication and AIDS pathogenesis, and therefore, it represents a key target for the host immune response. In natural infection, however, Abs against Tat are produced only by a small fraction (approximately 20%) of asymptomatic individuals and are rarely seen in progressors, suggesting that Tat may possess properties diverting the adaptive immunity from generating humoral responses. Here we show that a Th1-type T cell response against Tat is predominant over a Th2-type B cell response in natural HIV-1 infection. This is likely due to the capability of Tat to selectively target and very efficiently enter CD1a-expressing monocyte-derived dendritic cells (MDDC), which represent a primary target for the recognition and response to virus Ag. Upon cellular uptake, Tat induces MDDC maturation and Th1-associated cytokines and beta-chemokines production and polarizes the immune response in vitro to the Th1 pattern through the transcriptional activation of TNF-alpha gene expression. This requires the full conservation of Tat transactivation activity since neither MDDC maturation nor TNF-alpha production are found with either an oxidized Tat, which does not enter MDDC, or with a Tat protein mutated in the cysteine-rich region (cys22 Tat), which enters MDDC as the wild-type Tat but is transactivation silent. Consistently with these data, inoculation of monkeys with the native wild-type Tat induced a predominant Th1 response, whereas cys22 Tat generated mostly Th2 responses, therefore providing evidence that Tat induces a predominant Th1 polarized adaptive immune response in the host.\n\nEffects of FSH and 17beta-estradiol on the transactivation of estrogen-regulated promoters and cell proliferation in L cells.\n\nPubMed\n\nPasapera, Ana MarÃ­a; JimÃ©nez-Aguilera, MarÃ­a del Pilar; Chauchereau, Anne; Milgrom, Edwin; Olivares, Aleida; Uribe, AÃ­da; GutiÃ©rrez-Sagal, RubÃ©n; Ulloa-Aguirre, Alfredo\n\n2005-03-01\n\nIn the present study, we analyzed human follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)-induced cell proliferation and transactivation of estrogen-sensitive reporter genes-in L cells stably expressing the human FSH receptor [L-(hFSHR(+)) cells]. In order to dissect the signaling pathways involved in this process, L-(hFSHR(+)) cells were transiently transfected with either the 3X-ERE-TAT-Luc or the ERE-VitA2-TK-CAT reporter genes and treated with FSH or PKA activators (cholera toxin, forskolin and 8-Br-cAMP) in the presence or absence of various kinase inhibitors. We found that FSH and all PKA activators, specifically induced transactivation of both reporter genes. Transactivation of estrogen-sensitive genes by FSH or PKA activators were blocked (approximately 90%) by H89 (PKA inhibitor) and LY294002 but not by Wortmannin (PI3-K inhibitors), 4-OH-tamoxifen, ICI182,780 or SB203580 (p38 MAPK inhibitor); PD98059 (ERK1/2 inhibitor) partially (approximately 30%) blocked the FSH-mediated effect. The combination of FSH and estradiol resulted in a synergistic effect on transactivation as well as on cell proliferation, and this enhancement was attenuated by antiestrogens. We additionally analyzed the participation of the coactivators SRC-1 and cAMP response element binding protein (CREB)-binding protein (CBP) in FSH-evoked estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent transactivation; we found that CBP but not SRC-1 potentiated FSH-induced transcriptional activation of both ER-sensitive reporters, being this effect stronger on the ERE-VitA2-TK-CAT than on the 3X-ERE-TAT-Luc reporter. Thus, in L-(hFSHR(+)) cells FSH induces transcriptional activation of estrogen-sensitive genes through an A-kinase-triggered signaling pathway, using also to a lesser extent the ERK1/2 and p38 pathways. PI3-K is not apparently involved in this FSH-mediated process since LY294002, but not Wortmannin, specifically binds ERs and completely blocks estrogen action. Presumably, CBP cooperates with the ER on genes that contain\n\nNucleolar protein trafficking in response to HIV-1 Tat: rewiring the nucleolus.\n\nPubMed\n\nJarboui, Mohamed Ali; Bidoia, Carlo; Woods, Elena; Roe, Barbara; Wynne, Kieran; Elia, Giuliano; Hall, William W; Gautier, Virginie W\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe trans-activator Tat protein is a viral regulatory protein essential for HIV-1 replication.

We used the protein transduction domain (PTD) of transactivating transcriptional factor (TAT) derived from HIV TAT protein to increase the delivery efficiency of aquatic protein vaccines. Vibrio parahaemolyticus outer membrane protein K (ompK), a reported vaccine candidate for the prevention of V.âparahaemolyticus infection, was fused with TAT-PTD expressed in Escherichia coli. We found that PTD-ompK fusion protein effectively penetrated into marbled eel bodies. Analysis of ompK antibody titres demonstrated that immersion vaccination with PTD-ompK was superior to ompK alone and induced robust immune stimulation in marbled eels. Both active and passive protection analyses against immersive challenge with V.âparahaemolyticus strains demonstrated that marbled eels immunized with PTD-ompK survived significantly longer than those immunized with ompK alone. Our results indicated that TAT-PTD could be served as is an efficient delivery system for aquatic immersion vaccinations against various infectious diseases commonly seen in aquatic farm industry.

Up to now, no study has reported on the recombinant expression of this important human chaperone. Herein, we describe the successful purification and characterization of recombinant human Hsp70-2 in Escherichia coli in both the full-length and the chimeric protein containing the protein transduction domain corresponding to the trans-activator of transcription (Tat) from HIV. Under optimized conditions, the Tat-Hsp70-2 was expressed in a soluble form and purified by two chromatographic steps (in a 3.6Â mg/L fermentation broth yield): recombinant Tat-Hsp70-2 was folded and showed ATPase activity. In contrast, the full-length recombinant protein was only expressed in the form of inclusion bodies and thus was purified following a refolding procedure. The refolded Hsp70-2 protein was inactive and the protein conformation slightly altered as compared to the corresponding Tat-fused variant. The Tat-Hsp70-2 protein (100Â nM), when added to human neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells subjected to hydrogen peroxide or 6-hydroxydopamine stress, partially protected from the deleterious effect of these treatments. This work describes an approach for the functional expression of human Tat-Hsp70-2 that provides sufficient material for detailed structure-function studies and for testing its ability to protect neuroblastoma cells from oxidative stress.

We find that the viral transactivator Tat promotes hyperactivation of T cells by blocking the nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacetylase SIRT1. Tat directly interacts with the deacetylase domain of SIRT1 and blocks the ability of SIRT1 to deacetylate lysine 310 in the p65 subunit of NF-ÎºB. Because acetylated p65 is more active as a transcription factor, Tat hyperactivates the expression of NF-ÎºB-responsive genes, a function lost in SIRT1â/â cells. These results support a model where the normal function of SIRT1 as a negative regulator of T-cell activation is suppressed by Tat during HIV infection. These events likely contribute to the state of immune cell hyperactivation found in HIV-infected individuals.

The viral Tat activator recruits Positive Transcription Elongation Factor b (P-TEFb) and Super Elongation Complex (SEC) that jointly drive transcription elongation. While substantial progress in understanding the role of SEC in HIV gene transcription elongation has been obtained, defining of the mechanisms that govern SEC functions is still limited, and the role of SEC in controlling HIV transcription in the absence of Tat is less clear. Here we revisit the contribution of SEC in early steps of HIV gene transcription. In the absence of Tat, the AF4/FMR2 Family member 4 (AFF4) of SEC efficiently activates HIV transcription, while gene activation by its homolog AFF1 is substantially lower. Differential recruitment to the HIV promoter and association with Human Polymerase-Associated Factor complex (PAFc) play key role in this functional distinction between AFF4 and AFF1. Moreover, while depletion of cyclin T1 expression has subtle effects on HIV gene transcription in the absence of Tat, knockout (KO) of AFF1, AFF4, or both proteins slightly repress this early step of viral transcription. Upon Tat expression, HIV transcription reaches optimal levels despite KO of AFF1 or AFF4 expression. However, double AFF1/AFF4 KO completely diminishes Tat trans-activation. Significantly, our results show that P-TEFb phosphorylates AFF4 and modulates SEC assembly, AFF1/4 dimerization and recruitment to the viral promoter. We conclude that SEC promotes both early steps of HIV transcription in the absence of Tat, as well as elongation of transcription, when Tat is expressed. Significantly, SEC functions are modulated by P-TEFb.\n\nSuper elongation complex promotes early HIV transcription and its function is modulated by P-TEFb\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKuzmina, Alona; Krasnopolsky, Simona; Taube, Ran\n\n2017-01-01\n\nABSTRACT Early work on the control of transcription of the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) laid the foundation for our current knowledge of how RNA Polymerase II is released from promoter-proximal pausing sites and transcription elongation is enhanced.

First, the plasmid DNA (pIRES-H5/GFP) nanoparticle was formulated using PAMAM dendrimer and TAT peptide and then characterized for surface charge, particle size, DNA encapsulation and protection of the pIRES-H5/GFP DNA plasmid to enzymatic digestion. Subsequently, the potency of the TAT-conjugated dendrimer for gene delivery was evaluated through in vitro transfection into Vero cells followed by gene expression analysis including western blotting, fluorescent microscopy and PCR. The effect of the TAT peptide on cellular uptake of DNA vaccine was studied by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. Finally, the ability of TAT-conjugated PAMAM dendrimer for transdermal delivery of the DNA plasmid was assessed through artificial membranes followed by qRT-PCR and flow cytometry. TAT-conjugated PAMAM dendrimer showed the ability to form a compact and nanometre-sized polyplexes with the plasmid DNA, having the size range of 105 to 115 nm and a positive charge of +42 to +45 mV over the N/P ratio of 6:1(+/-). Â In vitro transfection analysis into Vero cells confirms the high potency of TAT-conjugated PAMAM dendrimer to enhance the cellular uptake of DNA vaccine.Â The permeability value assay through artificial membranes reveals that TAT-conjugated PAMAM has more capacity for transdermal delivery of the DNA compared to unmodified PAMAM dendrimer (P<0.05). The findings of this study suggest that TAT-conjugated PAMAM dendrimer is a promising non-viral vector for transdermal use.This article is open to POST-PUBLICATION REVIEW.

The presence of anti-Tat antibodies is negatively correlated with disease progression, hence making Tat a potential vaccine candidate. The cytotoxicity and moderate immunogenicity of Tat however remain impediments for developing Tat-based vaccines. Here, we report a novel strategy to concurrently enhance the immunogenicity and safety profile of Tat. The grafting of universal helper T-lymphocyte (HTL) epitopes, Pan DR Epitope (PADRE) and Pol711 into the cysteine rich domain (CRD) and the basic domain (BD) abolished the transactivation potential of the Tat protein. The HTL-Tat proteins elicited a significantly higher titer of antibodies as compared to the wild-type Tat in BALB/c mice. While the N-terminal epitope remained immunodominant in HTL-Tat immunizations, an additional epitope in exon-2 was recognized with comparable magnitude suggesting a broader immune recognition. Additionally, the HTL-Tat proteins induced cross-reactive antibodies of high avidity that efficiently neutralized exogenous Tat, thus blocking the activation of a Tat-defective provirus. With advantages such as presentation of multiple B-cell epitopes, enhanced antibody response and importantly, transactivation-deficient Tat protein, this approach has potential application for the generation of Tat-based HIV/AIDS vaccines.\n\nSynergistic Enhancement of Antitumor Efficacy by PEGylated Multi-walled Carbon Nanotubes Modified with Cell-Penetrating Peptide TAT\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nHu, Shanshan; Wang, Tong; Pei, Xibo; Cai, He; Chen, Junyu; Zhang, Xin; Wan, Qianbing; Wang, Jian\n\n2016-10-01\n\nIn the present study, a cell-penetrating peptide, the transactivating transcriptional factor (TAT) domain from HIV, was linked to PEGylated multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs) to develop a highly effective antitumor drug delivery system. FITC was conjugated on MWCNTs-polyethylene glycol (PEG) and MWCNTs-PEG-TAT to provide fluorescence signal for tracing the cellular uptake of the nanocarrier. After loaded with an anticancer agent, doxorubicin (DOX) via Ï - Ï stacking interaction, the physicochemical characteristics, release profile and biological evaluation of the obtained nano-sized drug carrier were investigated. The DOX loaded MWCNTs-PEG and MWCNTs-PEG-TAT drug carriers both displayed appropriate particle size, excellent stability, high drug loading, and pH-dependent drug release profile. Nevertheless, compared with DOX-MWCNTs-PEG, DOX-MWCNTs-PEG-TAT showed improved cell internalization, intracellular distribution and potentiated anticancer efficacy due to the TAT-mediated membrane translocation, endosomal escape and nuclear targeting. Furthermore, the therapeutic efficacy of DOX was not compromised after being conjugated with MWCNTs-PEG-TAT and the proposed nanocarrier was also confirmed to have a good biocompatibility. In conclusion, our results suggested that the unique combination of TAT and MWCNTs as a multifunctional drug delivery system might be a powerful tool for improved anticancer drug development.\n\nKetone bodies protection against HIV-1 Tat-induced neurotoxicity.\n\nPubMed\n\nHui, Liang; Chen, Xuesong; Bhatt, Dhaval; Geiger, Nicholas H; Rosenberger, Thad A; Haughey, Norman J; Masino, Susan A; Geiger, Jonathan D\n\n2012-07-01\n\nHIV-1-associated neurocognitive disorder (HAND) is a syndrome that ranges clinically from subtle neuropsychological impairments to profoundly disabling HIV-associated dementia. Not only is the pathogenesis of HAND unclear, but also effective treatments are unavailable. The HIV-1 transactivator of transcription protein (HIV-1 Tat) is strongly implicated in the pathogenesis of HAND, in part, because of its well-characterized ability to directly excite neurons and cause neurotoxicity. Consistent with previous findings from others, we demonstrate here that HIV-1 Tat induced neurotoxicity, increased intracellular calcium, and disrupted a variety of mitochondria functions, such as reducing mitochondrial membrane potential, increasing levels of reactive oxygen species, and decreasing bioenergetic efficiency. Of therapeutic importance, we show that treatment of cultured neurons with ketone bodies normalized HIV-1 Tat induced changes in levels of intracellular calcium, mitochondrial function, and neuronal cell death. Ketone bodies are normally produced in the body and serve as alternative energy substrates in tissues including brain and can cross the blood-brain barrier. Ketogenic strategies have been used clinically for treatment of neurological disorders and our current results suggest that similar strategies may also provide clinical benefits in the treatment of HAND.

Mass-spectrometry analysis of whole-cell extracts from 2D10 Jurkat T cells revealed that JIB-04 targets Serine Hydroxymethyltransferase 2 (SHMT2), a regulator of glycine biosynthesis and an adaptor for the BRCC36 K63Ub-specific deubiquitinase in the BRISC complex. Importantly, knockdown of SHMT1,2 or BRCC36, or exposure of cells to JIB-04, strongly increased Tat K63Ub-dependent destruction via autophagy. Moreover, point mutation of multiple lysines in Tat, or knockdown of BRCC36 or SHMT1,2, was sufficient to prevent destruction of Tat by JIB-04. We conclude that HIV-1 Tat levels are regulated through K63Ub-selective autophagy mediated through SHMT1,2 and the BRCC36 deubiquitinase.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus-1 protein Tat induces excitotoxic loss of presynaptic terminals in hippocampal cultures.\n\nPubMed\n\nShin, Angela H; Thayer, Stanley A\n\n2013-05-01\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of the CNS produces dendritic damage that correlates with cognitive decline in patients with HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND). HIV-induced neurotoxicity results in part from viral proteins shed from infected cells, including the HIV transactivator of transcription (Tat). We previously showed that Tat binds to the low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein (LRP), resulting in overactivation of NMDA receptors, activation of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway, and subsequent loss of postsynaptic densities. Here, we show that Tat also induces a loss of presynaptic terminals. The number of presynaptic terminals was quantified using confocal imaging of synaptophysin fused to green fluorescent protein (Syn-GFP). Tat-induced loss of presynaptic terminals was secondary to excitatory postsynaptic mechanisms because treatment with an LRP antagonist or an NMDA receptor antagonist inhibited this loss. Treatment with nutlin-3, an E3 ligase inhibitor, prevented Tat-induced loss of presynaptic terminals. These data suggest that Tat-induced loss of presynaptic terminals is a consequence of excitotoxic postsynaptic activity. We previously found that ifenprodil, an NR2B subunit-selective NMDA receptor antagonist, induced recovery of postsynaptic densities. Here we show that Tat-induced loss of presynaptic terminals was reversed by ifenprodil treatment. Thus, Tat-induced loss of presynaptic terminals is reversible, and this recovery can be initiated by inhibiting a subset of postsynaptic NMDA receptors. Understanding the dynamics of synaptic changes in response to HIV infection of the CNS may lead to the design of improved pharmacotherapies for HAND patients. Copyright Â© 2012 Elsevier Inc.

Human neurotropic virus, JC virus (JCV), a causative agent of the degenerative demyelinating disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy, contains sequences in the 5' end of the late RNA species with an extensive homology to HIV-1 TAR. In this study, we examined the possible role of the JCV-derived TAR-homologous sequence in Tat-mediated activation of the JCV late promoter (Tada et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 87:3479-3483, 1990). Results from site-directed mutagenesis revealed that critical G residues required for the function of HIV-1 TAR that are conserved in the JCV TAR homolog play an important role in Tat activation of the JCV promoter. In addition, in vivo competition studies suggest that shared regulatory components mediate Tat activation of the JCV late and HIV-1 long terminal repeat promoters. Furthermore, we showed that the JCV-derived TAR sequence behaves in the same way as HIV-1 TAR in response to two distinct Tat mutants, one of which that has no ability to bind to HIV-1 TAR and another that lacks transcriptional activity on a responsive promoter. These results suggest that the TAR homolog of the JCV late promoter is responsive to HIV-1 Tat induction and thus may participate in the overall activation of the JCV late promoter mediated by this transactivation.

Contrary to claims that the activity of the HIV-1 LTR responds poorly in rodent cells to trans activation by the viral tat gene product, cotransfection of RAW264 cells with a tat expression plasmid in transient transfection assays caused a > 20-fold increase in reporter gene expression that was inhibited by mutations in the TAR region. RAW264 cells stably transfected with the tat plasmid displayed similarly elevated HIV-1 LTR-driven reporter gene activity. By contrast to previous reports indicating a negative role for nef in HIV transcription, cotransfection of RAW264 cells with a nef expression plasmid trans activated the HIV-1 LTR driving either a chloramphenicol acetyltransferase or a luciferase reporter gene. The action of nef was specific to the LTR, as expression of nef had no effect on the activity of the simian virus 40, c-fms, urokinase plasminogen activator, or type 5 acid phosphatase promoter. trans-activating activity was also manifested by a frameshift mutant expressing only the first 35 amino acids of the protein. The effects of nef were multiplicative with those of tat gene product and occurred even in the presence of bacterial lipopolysaccharide, which itself activated LTR-directed transcription. Examination of the effects of selected mutations in the LTR revealed that neither the kappa B sites in the direct repeat enhancer nor the TAR region was required as a cis-acting element in nef action. The action of nef was not species restricted; it was able to trans activate in the human monocyte-like cell line Mono Mac 6. The presence of a nef expression cassette in a neomycin phosphotransferase gene expression plasmid greatly reduced the number of G418-resistant colonies generated in stable transfection of RAW264 cells\n\nMultiple transcriptional regulatory domains in the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 long terminal repeat are involved in basal and E1A/E1B-induced promoter activity.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKliewer, S; Garcia, J; Pearson, L; Soultanakis, E; Dasgupta, A; Gaynor, R\n\n1989-01-01\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) is the site of activation of the HIV tat protein. However, additional transactivators, such as the adenovirus E1A and herpesvirus ICPO proteins, have also been shown to be capable of activating the HIV LTR. Analysis of adenovirus mutants indicated that complete transactivation of the HIV LTR was dependent on both the E1A and E1B proteins. To determine which regions of the HIV LTR were important for complete E1A/E1B activation, a variety of oligonucleotide-directed mutations in HIV transcriptional regulatory domains were assayed both in vivo and in vitro. S1 nuclease analysis of RNA prepared after transfection of these HIV constructs into HeLa cells infected with wild-type adenovirus indicated that the enhancer, SP1, TATA, and a portion of the transactivation-responsive element were each required for complete E1A/E1B-mediated activation of the HIV LTR. These same promoter elements were required for both basal and E1A/E1B-induced levels of transcription in in vitro transcription reactions performed with cellular extracts prepared from cells infected with dl434, an E1A/E1B deletion mutant, or wild-type adenovirus. No mutations were found that reduced only E1A/E1B-induced expression without proportionally reducing basal levels of transcription, suggesting that E1A/E1B-mediated induction of the HIV LTR requires multiple promoter elements which are also required for basal transcriptional levels. Unlike activation by the tat protein, there was not a rigid dependence on maintenance of the transactivation-responsive stem base pairing for E1A/E1B-mediated activation either in vivo or in vitro, indicating that activation occurs by a mechanism distinct from that of tat induction.

Since injection of Pm-fortilin reduces shrimp mortality caused by white spot syndrome virus (WSSV), there is potential application of fortilin in shrimp culture. In the present study, in order to improve trans-membrane transportation efficiency, the protein transduction domain of the transactivator of transcription (TAT) peptide was fused to fortilin. The Pichia pastoris yeast expression system, which is widely accepted in animal feeds, was used for production of recombinant fusion protein. Green fluorescence protein (GFP) was selected as a reporter because of its intrinsic visible fluorescence. The fortilin, TAT and GFP fusion protein were constructed. Their trans-membrane transportation efficiency and effects on immune response of shrimp were analyzed in vitro. Results showed that TAT peptide improved in vitro uptake of fortilin into the hemocytes and midgut of Litopenaeus vannamei. The phenoloxidase (PO) activity of hemocytes incubated with GFP-Fortilin or GFP-Fortilin-TAT was significantly increased compared with that in the control without expressed fortilin. The PO activity of hemocytes incubated with 200 Î¼g mL-1 GFP-Fortilin-TAT was significantly higher than that in the group with the same concentration of GFP-Fortilin. Hemocytes incubated with GFP-Fortilin-TAT at all concentrations showed significantly higher nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity than those in the control or in the GFP-Fortilin treatment. The present in vitro study indicated that TAT fusion protein improved the immune effect of fortilin.\n\nOral Administration of TAT-PTD-Diapause Hormone Fusion Protein Interferes With Helicoverpa armigera (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae) Development.\n\nPubMed\n\nZhou, Zhou; Li, Yongli; Yuan, Chunyan; Zhang, Yongan; Qu, Liangjian\n\n2015-01-01\n\nDiapause hormone (DH), which can terminate diapause in Helicoverpa armigera HÃ¼bner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), has shown promise as a pest control method. However, the main challenge in using DH as an insecticide lies in achieving effective oral delivery, since the peptide may be degraded by digestive enzymes in the gut. To improve the efficacy of oral DH application, the Clostera anastomosis (L.) (Lepidoptera: Notodontidae) diapause hormone (caDH) was fused to the Protein Transduction Domain (PTD) of the human immunodeficiency virus-1 transactivator of transcription (TAT). Cellular transduction of TAT-caDH was verified with the use of a green fluorescent protein fusion, and its ability to terminate diapause was verified by injection into diapausing H. armigera pupae. Orally administered TAT-caDH resulted in larval growth inhibition. In TAT-caDH-treated insects, larval duration was delayed and the pupation rates were decreased at both development promoting conditions [27 Â°C, a photoperiod of 14:10(L:D) h] and diapause inducing conditions [20 Â°C, a photoperiod of 10:14(L:D) h]. No significant difference in diapause rate was observed between the TAT-caDH-treated and caDH-treated or control pupae maintained at diapause inducing conditions. Our results show that treatment with a recombinant TAT-caDH protein can affect larval development in H. armigera, and it suggest that TAT-DH treatment may be useful for controlling pests. This study is the first record of oral DH application in insect. Â© The Author 2015.

In vitro releases of insulin and Tat from ES-coated chitosan nanoparticles had a pH-dependant characteristic. A small amount of the contents was released from the coated nanoparticles at pH 1.2 simulated gastric fluid, while a fairly fast and complete release was observed in pH 7.4 medium. Caco-2 cell was used as the model of cellular transport and uptake studies. The results showed that the cellular transport and uptake of insulin for ES-coated chitosan nanoparticles co-loading insulin and Tat (ES-Tat-cNPs) were about 3-fold and 4-fold higher than those for the nanoparticles loading only insulin (ES-cNPs), respectively. The evaluations in vivo of ES-Tat-cNPs were conducted on diabetic rats and normal minipigs, respectively. The experimental results on rats revealed that the pharmacodynamical bioavailability of ES-Tat-cNPs had 2.16-fold increase compared with ES-cNPs. After oral administration of nanoparticle suspensions to the minipigs, insulin bioavailability of ES-Tat-cNPs was 1.73-fold higher than that of ES-cNPs, and the main absorption site of insulin was probably located in the colon for the two nanoparticles. In summary, this report provided an exploratory means for the improvement of oral absorption of insulin.\n\nBovine foamy virus transactivator BTas interacts with cellular RelB to enhance viral transcription.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Jian; Tan, Juan; Guo, Hongyan; Zhang, Qicheng; Jia, Rui; Xu, Xuan; Geng, Yunqi; Qiao, Wentao\n\n2010-11-01\n\nViruses are obligate intracellular parasites that depend on cellular machinery for their efficient transcription and replication. In a previous study we reported that bovine foamy virus (BFV) is able to activate the nuclear factor ÎºB (NF-ÎºB) pathway through the action of its transactivator BTas to enhance viral transcription. However, the mechanism used by NF-ÎºB to enhance BFV transcription remains elusive. To address this question, we employed a yeast two-hybrid assay to screen for BTas-interacting proteins. We found that RelB, a member of NF-ÎºB protein family, interacts with BTas. We confirmed the putative RelB-BTas interaction in vitro and in vivo and identified the protein regions responsible for the RelB-BTas interaction. Using a luciferase reporter assay, we next showed that RelB enhances BFV transcription (BTas-induced long terminal repeat [LTR] transactivation) and that this process requires both the localization of the RelB-BTas interaction in the nucleus and the Rel homology domain of RelB. The knockdown of the cellular endogenous RelB protein using small interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly attenuated BTas-induced LTR transcription. The results of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed that endogenous RelB binds to the viral LTR in BFV-infected cells. Together, these results suggest that BFV engages the RelB protein as a cotransactivator of BTas to enhance viral transcription. In addition, our findings indicate that BFV infection upregulates cellular RelB expression through BTas-induced NF-ÎºB activation. Thus, this study demonstrates the existence of a positive-feedback circuit in which BFV utilizes the host's NF-ÎºB pathway through the RelB protein for efficient viral transcription.\n\nThe HIV-1 viral protein Tat increases glutamate and decreases GABA exocytosis from human and mouse neocortical nerve endings.\n\nPubMed\n\nMusante, Veronica; Summa, Maria; Neri, Elisa; Puliti, Aldamaria; Godowicz, Tomasz T; Severi, Paolo; Battaglia, Giuseppe; Raiteri, Maurizio; Pittaluga, Anna\n\n2010-08-01\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1)-encoded transactivator of transcription (Tat) potentiated the depolarization-evoked exocytosis of [(3)H]D-aspartate ([(3)H]D-ASP) from human neocortical terminals. The metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) 1 receptor antagonist 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt) prevented this effect, whereas the mGlu5 receptor antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl) pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP) was ineffective. Western blot analysis showed that human neocortex synaptosomes possess mGlu1 and mGlu5 receptors. Tat potentiated the K(+)-evoked release of [(3)H]D-ASP or of endogenous glutamate from mouse neocortical synaptosomes in a CPCCOEt-sensitive and MPEP-insensitive manner. Deletion of mGlu1 receptors (crv4/crv4 mice) or mGlu5 receptors (mGlu5(-/-)mouse) silenced Tat effects. Tat enhanced inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate production in human and mouse neocortical synaptosomes, consistent with the involvement of group I mGlu receptors. Tat inhibited the K(+)-evoked release of [(3)H]gamma-aminobutyric acid ([(3)H]GABA) from human synaptosomes and that of endogenous GABA or [(3)H]GABA from mouse nerve terminals; the inhibition was insensitive to CPCCOEt or MPEP. Tat-induced effects were retained by Tat(37-72) but not by Tat(48-85). In mouse neocortical slices, Tat facilitated the K(+)- and the veratridine-induced release of [(3)H]D-ASP in a CPCCOEt-sensitive manner and was ineffective in crv4/crv4 mouse slices. These observations are relevant to the comprehension of the pathophysiological effects of Tat in central nervous system and may suggest new potential therapeutic approaches to the cure of HIV-1-associated dementia.\n\nCritical chemical features in trans-acting-responsive RNA are required for interaction with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein.\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSumner-Smith, M; Roy, S; Barnett, R; Reid, L S; Kuperman, R; Delling, U; Sonenberg, N\n\n1991-01-01\n\nThe human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat protein binds to an RNA stem-loop structure called TAR which is present at the 5' end of all human immunodeficiency virus type 1 transcripts. This binding is centered on a bulge within the stem of TAR and is an essential step in the trans-activation process which results in a dramatic increase in viral gene expression. By analysis of a series of TAR derivatives produced by transcription or direct chemical synthesis, we determined the structural and chemical requirements for Tat binding. Tat binds well to structures which have a bulge of two to at least five unpaired bases bounded on both sides by a double-stranded RNA stem. This apparent flexibility in bulge size is in contrast to an absolute requirement for an unpaired uridine (U) in the 5'-most position of the bulge (+23). Substitution of the U with either natural bases or chemical analogs demonstrated that the imido group at the N-3 position and, possibly, the carbonyl group at the C-4 position of U are critical for Tat binding. Cytosine (C), which differs from U at only these positions, is not an acceptable substitute. Furthermore, methylation at N-3 abolishes binding. While methylation of U at the C-5 position has little effect on binding, fluorination reduces it, possibly because of its effects on relative tautomer stability at the N-3 and C-4 positions. Thus, we have identified key moieties in the U residue that are of importance for the binding of Tat to TAR RNA. We hypothesize that the invariant U is involved in hydrogen bond interactions with either another part of TAR or the TAR-binding domain in Tat.

CUS2 protein is associated with U2 RNA in splicing extracts and interacts with PRP11, a subunit of the conserved splicing factor SF3a. Absence of CUS2 renders certain U2 RNA folding mutants lethal, arguing that a normal activity of CUS2 is to help refold U2 into a structure favorable for its binding to SF3b and SF3a prior to spliceosome assembly. Both CUS2 function in vivo and the in vitro RNA binding activity of CUS2 are disrupted by mutation of the first RRM, suggesting that rescue of misfolded U2 involves the direct binding of CUS2. Human Tat-SF1, reported to stimulate Tat-specific, transactivating region-dependent human immunodeficiency virus transcription in vitro, is structurally similar to CUS2. Anti-Tat-SF1 antibodies coimmunoprecipitate SF3a66 (SAP62), the human homolog of PRP11, suggesting that Tat-SF1 has a parallel function in splicing in human cells.

We report here that HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (Tat, fragment 1â86) produced a concentration-dependent increase in cytosolic Ca2+ in cardiac-projecting parasympathetic neurons of nucleus ambiguus retrogradely labeled with rhodamine. Using store-specific pharmacological agents, we identified several mechanisms of the Tat-induced Ca2+ elevation: 1) lysosomal Ca2+ mobilization, 2) Ca2+ release via inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate-sensitive endoplasmic reticulum pools, and 3) Ca2+ influx via transient receptor potential vanilloid type 2 (TRPV2) channels. Activation of TRPV2, nonselective cation channels, induced a robust and prolonged neuronal membrane depolarization, thus triggering an additional P/Q-mediated Ca2+ entry. In vivo microinjection studies indicate a dose-dependent, prolonged bradycardic effect of Tat administration into the nucleus ambiguus of conscious rats, in which neuronal TRPV2 played a major role. Our results support previous studies, indicating that Tat promotes bradycardia and, consequently, may be involved in the QT interval prolongation reported in HIV-infected patients. In the context of an overall HIV-dependent autonomic dysfunction, these Tat-mediated mechanisms may account for the higher prevalence of sudden cardiac death in HIV-1-infected patients compared with general population with similar risk factors. Our results may be particularly relevant in view of the recent findings that significant Tat levels can still be identified in the cerebrospinal fluid of HIV-infected patients with viral load suppression due to efficient antiretroviral therapy.

The peculiar traits of AM fungi have so far limited traditional approaches such as genetic transformation. The aim of this work was to investigate whether the protein transduction domain of the HIV-1 transactivator of transcription (TAT) protein, previously shown to act as a potent nanocarrier for macromolecule delivery in both animal and plant cells, may translocate protein cargoes into AM fungi. We evaluated the internalization into germinated spores of Gigaspora margarita of two recombinant TAT fusion proteins consisting of either a fluorescent (GFP) or a luminescent (aequorin) reporter linked to the TAT peptide. Both TAT-fused proteins were found to enter AM fungal mycelia after a short incubation period (5-10 min). Ca2+ measurements in G. margarita mycelia pre-incubated with TAT-aequorin demonstrated the occurrence of changes in the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration in response to relevant stimuli, such as touch, cold, salinity, and strigolactones, symbiosis-related plant signals. These data indicate that the cell-penetrating properties of the TAT peptide can be used as an effective strategy for intracellularly delivering proteins of interest and shed new light on Ca2+ homeostasis and signalling in AM fungi.

By mutating and substituting cis-acting sequences, we mapped elements of the human immunodeficiency virus long terminal repeat that are responsible for creating each transcription complex. Whereas processive complexes are efficiently assembled by upstream promoter elements in the absence of the TATA box, nonprocessive complexes absolutely require the TATA box. Moreover, the TATA box alone can set up these nonprocessive complexes, and nonprocessive but not processive complexes are trans activated by Tat. Finally, a strong DNA-binding site between the TATA box and trans-activation-responsive region interferes with either the assembly or movement of these nonprocessive complexes and diminishes the effects of Tat. Thus, Tat affects a critical step in the formation of elongation-competent transcription complexes.

A long-lived reservoir of latently infected CD4(+) memory T cells represents the most important sanctuary for the virus and the greatest obstacle for viral eradication. In this work, we present an initial step toward a gene therapy approach aimed at the activation of latent provirus to induce the death of latently infected T cells. Latent HIV-1 infection is characterized by the failure of viral gene expression as a consequence of uninitiated or aborted transcription. We have constructed an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector (p5p53RTAT3) that expresses the viral trans-activating protein Tat in a drug-regulated manner and p53 in a Rev-dependent manner. We have demonstrated that the Tat-expressed protein from p5p53RTAT3 vector reactivates latent HIV-1 proviruses in J1.1 and ACH-2 cell lines and promotes p53-induced apoptosis in the presence of Rev. Our system was able to trigger the trans-activation of the provirus 5' long terminal repeat (LTR), stimulate the expression of the Rev protein from a tat-defective provirus, and provoke apoptosis selectively in the cells transfected with a tat-defective HIV-1 provirus in contrast to those with no HIV-1 provirus. However, the Rev-dependent p53 killing of latently infected cells was not effective enough for complete elimination of the awakened HIV-1 viruses. In summary, we have developed a vector system that is efficient in activating latent HIV-1 proviruses but that needs further improvement to kill infected cells.\n\nHIV-1 Tat targets Tip60 to impair the apoptotic cell response to genotoxic stresses\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCol, Edwige; Caron, CÃ©cile; Chable-Bessia, Christine; Legube, Gaelle; Gazzeri, Sylvie; Komatsu, Yasuhiko; Yoshida, Minoru; Benkirane, Monsef; Trouche, Didier; Khochbin, Saadi\n\n2005-01-01\n\nHIV-1 transactivator Tat uses cellular acetylation signalling by targeting several cellular histone acetyltransferases (HAT) to optimize its various functions. Although Tip60 was the first HAT identified to interact with Tat, the biological significance of this interaction has remained obscure. We had previously shown that Tat represses Tip60 HAT activity. Here, a new mechanism of Tip60 neutralization by Tat is described, where Tip60 is identified as a substrate for the newly reported p300/CBP-associated E4-type ubiquitin-ligase activity, and Tat uses this mechanism to induce the polyubiquitination and degradation of Tip60. Tip60 targeting by Tat results in a dramatic impairment of the Tip60-dependent apoptotic cell response to DNA damage. These data reveal yet unknown strategies developed by HIV-1 to increase cell resistance to genotoxic stresses and show a role of Tat as a modulator of cellular protein ubiquitination.

Both viral and cellular transcription factors, including transcriptional activators, suppressor proteins and epigenetic factors, are involved in HIV transcription from the proviral DNA integrated within the host cell genome. Among them, the virus-encoded transcriptional activator Tat is the master regulator of HIV transcription. Interestingly, unlike other known transcriptional activators, Tat primarily activates transcriptional elongation and initiation by interacting with the cellular positive transcriptional elongation factor b (P-TEFb). In this review, we describe the molecular mechanism underlying how Tat activates viral transcription through interaction with P-TEFb. We propose a novel therapeutic strategy against HIV replication through blocking Tat action.\n\nHuman immunodeficiency virus type 1 Tat binds to Candida albicans, inducing hyphae but augmenting phagocytosis in vitro\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGruber, Andreas; Lell, Claudia P; Speth, Cornelia; Stoiber, Heribert; Lass-FlÃ¶rl, Cornelia; Sonneborn, Anja; Ernst, Joachim F; Dierich, Manfred P; WÃ¼rzner, Reinhard\n\n2001-01-01\n\nTat, the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) transactivating protein, binds through its RGD-motif to human integrin receptors. Candida albicans, the commonest cause of mucosal candidiasis in subjects infected with HIV-1, also possesses RGD-binding capacity. The present study reveals that Tat binds to C. albicans but not to C. tropicalis. Tat binding was markedly reduced by laminin and to a lesser extent by a complement C3 peptide containing the RGD motif, but not by a control peptide. The outgrowth of C. albicans was accelerated following binding of Tat, but phagocytosis of opsonized C. albicans was also increased after Tat binding. Thus, Tat binding promotes fungal virulence by inducing hyphae but may also reduce it by augmenting phagocytosis. The net effect of Tat in vivo is difficult to judge but in view of the many disease-promoting effects of Tat we propose that accelerating the formation of hyphae dominates over the augmentation of phagocytosis.
