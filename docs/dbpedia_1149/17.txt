Can someone help me find the MP3s of the official soundtrack for Rygar: The Legendary Adventure? I've looked high and low and other than a few tracks on Youtube all I've found are dead links to it.

I've found it at KHInsider*; you'll have to look for the Japanese album name, "Symphonic Poem Argos no Senshi Original Soundtrack."

Thank you, thank you, thank you! I've looked for it on that site (but under the title of Rygar of course) and never found it, I never would have imagined it'd be hiding on there under a different title!
