        "text": "Mishti Doi is a simple dessert made with sweetened milk and curd. Milk is reduced and is sweetened with jaggery and set with some curd to make this delicious sweet. Usually the curd is set in earthen pots. As they absorb the moisture, you end up with a thick yogurt. This is so popular in Bengal and Bangladesh. We lived in Calcutta for a while and my dad is such a huge fan of mishti doi. When we shifted to Pondicherry, he used to make this for us when we were kids. But I never made it for the blog until now.\n\nI have tried mishti doi a few times with condensed milk and it wouldn’t set properly. After a few tries I just stopped trying. When I was doing milk sweets for this month, I wanted to try it again. But this time, I decided to make it to suit my diet. Usually milk is reduced and set, but I added amul cream to the milk so that it increases the fat content without adding too much carbs. And I also added a combination of stevia and erythritol to sweeten the dish. Erythritol when used separately is not too sweet and stevia gives an after taste when used. By combining them together you can get rid of both the issues and my mishti doi turned out mildly sweet and so yum. I even added some saffron to the milk to make it more fragrant.\n\nServes Two\n\nIngredients:\n\nMilk – 1/3 cup\n\nAmul Cream – 1/3 cup\n\nSaffron – a pinch\n\nStevia – 1/4 tsp\n\nErythritol – 1 tsp\n\nCurd Culture – 1 tsp\n\nProcedure:\n\nIn a pan mix together milk, cream and saffron.\n\nBring it to boil.\n\nRemove from flame and mix stevia and erythritol.\n\nOnce it is warm, mix the curd culture and divide it between two ramekins or two terracotta bowls.\n\nAllow it to set overnight or 6-8 hours.\n\nRefrigerate for one or two hours and serve chilled.\n\nCheck out the Blogging Marathon page for the other Blogging Marathoners doing BM# 87\n\n[inlinkz_linkup id=760145 mode=1]"
