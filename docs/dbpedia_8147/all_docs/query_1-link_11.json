        "text": "Mishti Doi is an authentic Indian dessert from the state of West Bengal in India. Sweet thick yogurt with caramelized sugar makes this divine sweet loved by all.\n\nSimilar to Coconut Rice Kheer and Carrot Almond Pudding ( Gajar Halwa ) , Mishti Doi is a popular Indian Sweet dessert. Learn How to Make Best Mishti Doi easily using this fail-proof recipe. All you need is 3 basic ingredients that are easily available.\n\nInstant Pot Mishti Doi\n\nI am including pro tips, easy shortcuts and substitutions that will help you make this recipe confidently. Detailed instructions to make it on Stovetop as well as electric pressure cooker like Instant Pot are also included.\n\nSetting yogurt in InstantPot brings consistent results. It yields thick and creamy , firmly set yogurt using the YOGURT function. It is my preferred method to set the Mishti Doi.\n\nRecipe Inspiration\n\nMy best friend and bubble buddy is Bengali. True to her identity, she makes the best Bengali food and popular bengali sweets. I learned how to make mishti doi from her and I often make it like a pro.\n\nWhat is Mishti Doi ?\n\nIn Bengali language â€˜mishtiâ€™ means sweet and â€˜doiâ€™ is yogurt (curd). So literally the meaning of word is Sweet yogurt or meetha dahi. However the sweetener is added before setting the yogurt and not afterwards. Which makes it unique and rich compared to regular sweetened yogurt.\n\nIt is also called Meethi Dahi in Hindi. This dessert is often made during Durga Puja. Since yogurt is called curd in India, you can also call it caramelized sweet curd dessert.\n\nHow is Mishti Doi different from regular yogurt ?\n\nThe method of making mishti doi is different than making regular yogurt. The milk is boiled longer, thickened and reduced compared to just heating it up.\n\nYou also add caramelized sugar in milk before adding yogurt culture and letting it set.\n\nMishti Doi takes a longer time to set firm compared to regular yogurt or curd.\n\nPro Tips\n\nUse full fat milk or full cream milk. Since sweetener is added to it already, low fat or toned milk does not set to firm yogurt. It often gets curdled and watery.\n\nThe yogurt culture should be thick. Strain it on cheesecloth to remove excess water before using.\n\nDo not mix the yogurt culture in hot milk. It will curdle. Let it cool down to lukewarm levels before mixing the culture.\n\nUse earthen bowls or pots if possible. The porous walls of the earthen bowls absorb the moisture from the yogurt, which makes the mishti doi firm and thick.\n\nFermenting mishti doi takes more time as compared to making curd. So please be patient.\n\nThe time to set the Mishti Doi will also depend upon the local temperature conditions. If you live in cold climate zones, keep the yogurt in a warm place in your house. Inside a lit oven, near a heater vent or gas stove are good options.\n\nHow To Make Mishti Doi Quickly?\n\nYou can also use regular jaggery or palm jaggery instead of caramelized sugar.\n\nInstead of boiling and reducing the milk, use warm milk + a can of condensed milk. However, since condensed milk is already sweet, reduce the sugar quantity in half.\n\nAdditional Flavors\n\nYou can serve Mishti Doi as is ! I love to add a pinch of saffron and cardamom powder for wonderful aroma and flavor. A sprinkle of ground nutmeg or cinnamon powder is also great for enhancing the earthy rich flavors of Mishti Doi.\n\nYou can also add crushed nuts ( especially almonds or pistachio) on top. Dry Coconut chips or granola works as well.\n\nFresh berries or cut up mango also make excellent additions to serve it along. It adds a freshness and vibrant color.\n\nServing Suggestions\n\nYou can use Mishti Doi as a sweet or dessert. You can make it set in individual portion size cups usually terracotta bowls or earthenware and let people choose their topping. These DIY dessert bars are fun and party friendly.\n\nIt can also be used in breakfast menu along with Chocolate Chia Seed Pudding, Sweet Potato Chocolate Brownies or Almond Flour Mug Cakes. Serve it along with fresh fruit and granola for fancy gourmet food.\n\nIngredients\n\nÂ½ cup yogurt\n\nÂ½ cup sugar\n\n4 cups whole milk\n\nHow To Make Mishti Doi\n\nKeep yogurt culture on a coffee filter or cheesecloth for at least an hour to strain the water. This process is very important as this will make the yogurt thick in consistency.\n\nOn a medium heat, start caramelizing sugar. Stir continuously and keep a close eye so that it doesnâ€™t burn.\n\nOnce sugar is caramelized, turn off the heat and add half cup of milk. Dissolve the caramelized sugar properly.\n\nNow add all the remaining milk and turn on the heat to medium and keep stirring intermittently.\n\nContinue to boil the milk till it reduces the quantity to approximately â…”rd.\n\nTurn off the heat. Let the reduced milk and caramelized sugar mixture cool down till it becomes lukewarm.\n\nAdd strained yogurt spoon by spoon and whisk it well. Make sure it is evenly distributed in the warm caramelized milk mixture.\n\nNow pour the yogurt milk mixture in desired containers and close them with aluminum foil. Let it set undisturbed in a warm , dark place for 8-10 hours. Perfect texture, thick and rich Mishti Doi will be ready. Enjoy !\n\nIf using Instant Pot : Start the yogurt function on Instant Pot. Add a cup of water and set the trivet in the main insert. Keep the milk with yogurt culture containers on the trivet and close the lid. Perfect texture, thick and rich Mishti Doi will be ready in 8 hrs.\n\nLove Indian Food ?
