        "text": "Many Indian desserts can take a bit of time and effort to put together. But Mishti Do which is a fermented sweet yoghurt with a lovely caramel flavour is a simple pud that is light and airy and super easy to make.\n\nThis dish comes from West Bengal where they love their sweets and this one is high up on the list of favourites.\n\nTraditionally it is served in terracotta or clay pots because the porous nature of the pots allows water to evaporate from the dessert which thickens it and the pots also provide the right temperature for the yoghurt culture to grow so it sets. If you can prepare this the night before so you give it enough time to set.\n\nI know it sounds simple but sometimes its the simple things that are more special."
