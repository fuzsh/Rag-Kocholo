It is fresh and juicy, fruity and filled with flavours – sweet and tangy and spicy and salty. With the chickpeas going in, it is a protein-packed salad that can double up as a light lunch as well.\n\nIt is quite an easy task to put together this Pineapple & Chickpea Salad, too. My family loves it, and I make it whenever I can get my hands on some ripe, sweet pineapple. There are just a few, fresh ingredients that go into it, and absolutely nothing processed. Let’s see how to go about preparing this salad, in today’s post.\n\nPineapple & Chickpea Salad – Ingredients Used\n\nPineapple and chickpeas are the major ingredients here. You need to use a pineapple that is fresh and juicy, ripe but not overly so, the right blend of sweet and tangy. Peel and cut it up into slices, remove the core and thorns, and chop into bite-sized pieces, for the salad. Chickpeas here are kabuli chana, also called ‘garbanzo beans’, quite commonly available in India, and used in dishes like Chana Masala and Sundal.\n\nI have also used a few veggies here, to make the salad more substantial and nutritious – cucumber, onion and carrot. For best results, use a fresh ‘seedless’ cucumber – popularly known as ‘English cucumber’ – chopped up finely. I have used the orange Ooty carrot here, grated, but the juicy, red and sweet carrots that are popularly called ‘Delhi carrots’ would taste much better. As for the onion, I used a red one, finely chopped up.\n\nSome green chilli and fresh coriander go into this salad, finely chopped. Apart from salt, lemon juice and honey have been used for flavouring (scroll further down this post for vegan substitutes). If you are using honey, make sure you get a good-quality, unadulterated one.\n\nHow To Make Pineapple & Chickpea Salad\n\nHere’s how to put together the salad.\n\nIngredients (serves 2):\n\n1/3 cup chickpeas (kabuli chana)\n\n1/2 of a small pineapple\n\n1 small onion\n\n1 small carrot\n\n1/2 of a medium-sized cucumber\n\n1 green chilli or as per taste\n\n1 tablespoon finely chopped coriander\n\nSalt to taste\n\nJuice of 1/2 lemon or to taste\n\nAbout 1 tablespoon honey or to taste\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Rinse the chickpeas well. Then, soak them for 8-10 hours or overnight in enough water to cover them completely.\n\n2. When the chickpeas are done soaking, drain out the water from them. Transfer the chickpeas to a wide vessel, and add in enough fresh water to cover them. Place the vessel in a pressure cooker. Pressure cook for 5 whistles or till the chickpeas are cooked. Let the pressure release naturally.\n\n3. Once the pressure has gone down completely, remove the cooked chickpeas from it. Drain out the water – reserve it for use in soups, rasam, etc. Let the drained cooked chickpeas cool down fully.\n\n4. Transfer the cooled cooked chickpeas to a large mixing bowl. Chop up the pineapple, remove the thorns, and add to the mixing bowl. Peel and grate the carrot, and add to the bowl too. Chop up the cucumber and onion finely, and add these to the mixing bowl as well.\n\n5. Chop the green chilli very finely, and add it to the mixing bowl. Add the finely chopped coriander to the mixing bowl too.\n\n6. Add in salt to taste.\n\n7. Add in the lemon juice.\n\n8. Add in the honey.\n\n9. Mix everything well together. Your Pineapple & Chickpea Salad is ready. Serve immediately.\n\nOther Salad Recipes On My Blog\n\nThere are quite a few salad recipes already on the blog. Do check out these:\n\nPasi Parippu Kosumalli| South Indian Lentil Salad\n\nKobichi Koshimbir| Maharashtrian Cabbage Salad\n\nMathulai Kosumalli| South Indian Pomegranate Salad\n\nIndian Spiced Orange Salad\n\nApple Kachumbar| Indian Apple Salad\n\nZero-Oil Vegetable Salad\n\nThai Carrot Salad\n\nSriracha Pineapple Salad\n\nThai Grapefruit Salad\n\nSom Tam Mamuang| Thai Raw Mango Salad\n\nThai Rainbow Rice Salad\n\nSom Tam| Thai Green Papaya Salad\n\nEasy Mexican Salad, With A Desi Touch\n\nCan This Salad Be Made Vegan?\n\nThis Pineapple & Chickpea Salad recipe is completely vegetarian and gluten-free. However, it is not vegan (plant-based) due to the use of honey.\n\nYou can use maple syrup instead of honey, to make the salad vegan. Jaggery powder or coconut sugar would be great substitutes too.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nFor best results, use a ripe pineapple that is a good mix of sweet and sour. However, it should not be overly ripe.\n\nAdjust the quantity of salt, lemon juice, honey and green chillies as per personal taste preferences.\n\nThis salad is best consumed immediately after preparation.\n\nMake sure the chickpeas are cooked well. They need to be cooked through, but not overly mushy.\n\nDid you like this recipe?

It is luscious and comforting, subtly spiced and delicious, healthy and easy to put together. What more would you want from a soup?\n\nI find this soup absolutely blissful on cold wintry days or on dull days when the sky is overcast. Slow sips of this delicate soup do awaken my spirits. It is creamy without any cream actually being used in it, delectable, and can actually be put together with just a few everyday ingredients. No processed ingredients required! Let’s see how – scroll down for the Creamy Cauliflower Soup recipe.\n\nWhat Are The Ingredients Used?\n\nCauliflower is the main ingredient used in this soup, of course. There is also some onion and garlic added in for flavour. These are pan-roasted, using very little oil.\n\nI have used milk to add a creamy texture and lovely taste to the soup.\n\nThere are just two basic seasonings used – salt and pepper. A garnish of dried mixed herbs, just before serving, elevates the soup to a whole new level.\n\nCreamy Cauliflower Soup Recipe\n\nHere’s how to make the soup.\n\nIngredients (serves 4-6):\n\n1. A small-sized cauliflower, about 2-1/2 cups when chopped into small florets\n\n2. 1 small onion\n\n3. 5-6 cloves of garlic\n\n4. 1/2 tablespoon oil\n\n5. Salt to taste\n\n8. 1/2 cup milk, boiled and cooled\n\n7. Coarsely crushed pepper to taste\n\n8. 1/2 tablespoon of jaggery powder (optional)\n\n9. Dried mixed herbs for garnishing, as required\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Wash the cauliflower thoroughly and chop it into small florets. Also, peel the onion and garlic cloves and chop them roughly. Keep these ready.\n\n2. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add in the chopped onion and garlic, and turn the flame down to medium. Saute on medium flame for 3-4 minutes or till the onion and garlic are cooked and begin to turn brown.\n\n3. Add in the cauliflower florets at this stage. Also add in a little salt and water. Mix well. Cover and cook on medium flame till the cauliflower is cooked through. This can take 8-10 minutes. You will need to uncover the pan intermittently to stir the contents, and add in a splash of water if the vegetables have become too dry. Switch off gas when done.\n\n4. Allow the cooked vegetables to cool down completely, then transfer them to a mixer jar. Add in about 1/2 cup of water. Grind everything together to a smooth puree.\n\n5. Now, return the puree to the same pan we used earlier and place it on medium flame.\n\n6. Wash the mixer jar with about 1/2 cup of water and add this to the pan as well. Mix.\n\n7. Add 1/4 to 1/2 cup more water, depending upon the consistency of the soup you require. Mix.\n\n8. Also add in the milk. Mix well. Cook on medium flame for a minute or two.\n\n9. Add salt to taste, crushed pepper and jaggery powder. Mix well.\n\n10. Cook on medium flame for 4-5 minutes or till the soup comes to a boil, then let it simmer for about 2 minutes. It will thicken up considerably by this time. Switch off gas when the soup has thickened up but is still runny – remember that it will thicken up further with time.\n\n11. Serve the soup warm, garnished with mixed dried herbs.\n\nGluten-Free, But Not Vegan\n\nThis Creamy Cauliflower Soup recipe is completely vegetarian, but not vegan because of the use of dairy-based milk. I think coconut milk or other vegan milk (like oat milk or almond milk) would work well in this soup too, though I have never tried that out.\n\nThis recipe is gluten-free.\n\nRelated Event: Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge\n\nThis Creamy Cauliflower Soup Recipe is brought to you in association with the Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge.\n\nThe Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge is a group of enthusiastic food bloggers, who share recipes based on a certain theme every month. The way this group functions is very unique and interesting. Every month, the members of the group are divided into pairs. Each pair exchanges two ingredients secretly, unknown to the rest of the group members. These two ingredients are then used by each pair in a recipe that fits into the theme for the month. Upon completion, every participant shares a picture of the dish in the group, and the rest of the members try to guess the two secret ingredients that have been used in each one. It’s fun, and a great learning experience!\n\nThe group’s theme for the month of November 2023 was ‘Soups’, chosen by Narmadha of Nams Corner. She suggested that we experiment with ingredients and come up with a soup recipe, which would be perfect for the cold winter that is settling in gradually in most parts of India.\n\nI was paired with Kalyani of Sizzling Tastebuds for the month. She made this dazzling Carrot Celery Soup using the two secret ingredients that I gave her (‘celery’ and ‘sweet potato’). She suggested I use the ingredients ‘cauliflower’ and ‘garlic’ in my dish, and I prepared this Creamy Cauliflower Soup Recipe.\n\nOther Soup Recipes On My Blog\n\nI would suggest you also check out the other soup recipes on my blog. There are quite a few!\n\nChettinad Thakkali Soup| South Indian Tomato Soup\n\nItalian Flavoured Tomato Soup\n\nHot & Sour Vegetable Soup With Burnt Garlic\n\nSweet Corn Soup\n\nFrijoles Charros| Mexican Bean Soup\n\nBroccoli Almond Soup\n\nPalak Ka Shorba| Spinach Soup\n\nThai Tom Yum Vegetable Soup\n\nLemon Coriander Soup With Veggies\n\nMushroom Soup| Cream Of Mushroom Soup\n\nDal Ka Shorba| Indian-Spiced Lentil Soup\n\nTom Kha| Vegetarian Thai Coconut Soup\n\nMug Nu Paani| Gujarati Moong Bean Soup\n\nVegetarian Thukpa| Tibetan Noodle Soup\n\nTips & Tricks\n\n1. For best results, use a fresh, firm cauliflower that is free of blemishes.\n\n2. It is okay to let the vegetables get a little browned. That gives the soup a lovely, roasted flavour. However, do make sure the veggies do not get burnt.\n\n3. Here, I have used a pan to roast the vegetables. You can use an oven to do so too, but I prefer the pan.\n\n4. I have used boiled and cooled full-fat milk here.\n\n5. The jaggery powder is optional. You can skip it if you do not prefer using it. However, I do think it adds a beautiful flavour to the soup.\n\n6. I have used mixed dried herbs from Keya, to garnish the soup (not sponsored).\n\n7. I have used home-made crushed pepper here, which I make in small batches. I gently dry-roast a handful of black pepper for about a minute, allow it to cool down completely, then crush it coarsely in a small mixer jar. I store this in a clean, dry, air-tight bottle at room temperature and use as needed.\n\n8. You can use white pepper to season the soup too, instead of the black pepper I have used here.\n\n9. Remember to stop cooking the soup when it is still on the runnier side. It will thicken up with time.\n\n10. Adjust the quantity of water you use, depending upon the consistency of the soup that you require.\n\nDid you like this recipe? Do tell me, in your comments!\n\nMishti Kumro Bhorta| Bengali Pumpkin Mash\n\nMishti Kumro Bhorta refers to mashed pumpkin curry, made the Bengali way. This is an utterly flavourful dish, full of robust tastes, and makes for an excellent side to rotis. It can also be had mixed with plain rice which, I understand, is the way Bengalis typically like eating it. My family and I love having this bhorta with rice and a simple dal tadka.\n\nI used to have a cook from Odisha earlier, a guy who was well-versed with Bengali cooking. He would cook us a bit of Bengali food every now and then, and this Mishti Kumro Bhorta was one of the things he introduced us to. As an aside, I love how the Bengalis make bhorta (mash) using every conceivable vegetable, much as we South Indians make chutneys!\n\nI loved the Mishti Kumro Bhorta to bits the first time I had it, and our cook was sweet enough to roughly outline the recipe for me. Let me share with you all today how to put together this beautiful, flavoursome dish – it is quite an easy thing to make.\n\nWhat Goes Into Mishti Kumro Bharta\n\n‘Mishti Kumro Bharta‘ (Bengali) literally translates to ‘sweet pumpkin mash’. It is traditionally made using the sweetish red pumpkin, in place of which I have used butternut squash. I find butternut squash to be much more sweeter, flavourful and easier to cook than the regular Indian red pumpkin, and use it in several Indian dishes. Do check out this post where I have made South Indian style Parangikkai Poriyal with butternut squash – I have also described in this post, in detail, how to cut and use a butternut squash. I have also used butternut squash with great success in Avial, Mathan Erissery, Pumpkin Halwa and Parangikkai Rasavangi.\n\nApart from the squash, onion and a generous amount of garlic goes into the bhorta too. The usual suspects like salt and turmeric powder go in too, along with a little bit of sugar and red chilli powder. A dash of lemon juice is also used to flavour the dish.\n\nA few spoons of mustard oil go into this Mishti Kumro Bhorta too, which is what gives the dish an authentic Bengali flavour.\n\nOnce done, the bhorta is garnished with a generous amount of finely chopped coriander.\n\nHow To Make Mishti Kumro Bhorta\n\nIngredients (serves 4-6):\n\nA medium-sized butternut squash, 3 cups when peeled and chopped\n\nAbout 4 tablespoons of mustard oil\n\n1 medium-sized onion\n\n6-7 cloves of garlic\n\nSalt to taste\n\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n\nRed chilli powder to taste\n\n1/2 tablespoon sugar or to taste\n\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander\n\nA generous dash of lemon juice\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Remove the top of the butternut squash and cut it in half. Remove the peel, the strings and seeds. Do not discard the strings and seeds – they can be used in a chutney later (will share the recipe for the same some other time).\n\n2. Chop up the peeled and de-seeded butternut squash into cubes. Keep ready.\n\n3. Heat 1 tablespoon of mustard oil in a pan. Add in the butternut squash, along with the turmeric powder and a little salt. Add a splash of water, and turn the flame down to medium. Cook covered on medium flame till the squash is cooked through. This should take 7-8 minutes. You will need to uncover the pan intermittently, and splash some more water if the pan has got very dry. It is okay if the squash gets some charred, brown bits while cooking – this greatly adds to the flavour of the bhorta.\n\n4. While the squash is cooking, peel the garlic cloves. Smash them roughly, using a mortar and pestle. Keep ready.\n\n5. Peel the onion and chop finely. Keep ready.\n\n6. When the squash is cooked, transfer it to a plate.\n\n7. Heat about 3/4 tablespoon mustard oil in the same pan. Add in the smashed garlic cloves. Saute on medium heat for about a minute, then add in the chopped onions. Saute for 2-3 minutes on medium heat or till the onions start browning.\n\n8. At this stage, turn the flame down to low, and add the cooked squash cubes back into the pan.\n\n9. Add salt to taste, red chilli powder and sugar.\n\n10. Cook on low flame for about 2 minutes, mixing the ingredients together and mashing them up with the back of the ladle. Switch off gas when done.\n\n11. Add in the finely chopped coriander and lemon juice. Mix well.\n\n12. Add about a tablespoon of mustard oil, raw. Mix well. Your Mishti Kumro Bharta is ready. Serve it warm with rotis or rice. We like having it with rice and simple dal tadka.\n\nVegan And Gluten-Free\n\nThis recipe for Mishti Kumro Bhorta is entirely vegetarian and vegan. It is suitable for people following a plant-based diet.\n\nThis is a completely gluten-free recipe as well.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nMake sure the butternut squash is well cooked. You should be easily able to mash a cube of the cooked vegetable between your fingers.\n\nMustard oil is a must in this recipe. It is what gives this bhorta an authentic Bengali touch. For best results, use kacchi ghani mustard oil. However, if you don’t like the pungency of mustard oil or do not have it, you can use any other oil instead.\n\nA tempering of panch phoron (a mix of the five spices – cumin, mustard, fennel, nigella seeds and fenugreek – that is quite common in Bengali dishes) can be used in the bhorta too. I usually don’t, and neither do I use asafoetida to temper this bhorta.\n\nThe onions do not have to be completely cooked. You can cook them till slightly done and crunchy and add them to the bhorta. Alternatively, you can add in the onions raw as well.\n\nJaggery powder can be used in place of the sugar that I have used here. However, that might alter the colour of the final dish. Adjust the quantity as per personal taste preferences. You may also skip the sugar/jaggery if you feel the natural sweetness of the butternut squash is enough.\n\nYou may use dry red chillies or green chillies in place of the red chilli powder I have used here. Adjust the quantity as per personal taste preferences.\n\nThe lemon juice is optional. You can avoid it if you don’t prefer it. However, personally, I would highly recommend adding a dash of lemon juice. It adds a beautiful flavour to the bhorta.\n\nI have used a butternut squash here, which I bought at Namdhari’s Fresh (not sponsored). In case you cannot find butternut squash, you can use the regular Indian red pumpkin (which is what is traditionally used in this bhorta) . Butternut squash tastes sweeter and much more flavourful than red pumpkin, though.\n\nAs mentioned above, do not discard the fibre and seeds from the butternut squash. They can be used to make a chutney.\n\nDid you like this recipe? Do tell me, in your comments!\n\nCream Cheese Stuffed Dates\n\nThese Cream Cheese Stuffed Dates are just perfect for parties and get-togethers. Free of refined sugar, they are relatively guilt-free little sweet treats, decadent and absolutely delicious.\n\nDo try making these beauties for your Diwali dos! They are super simple to put together too – they need a sum total of 4 ingredients, and a platter takes just about 10 minutes to set up.\n\nThe Ingredients You Need\n\nSo, what are these 4 ingredients you need to make these Cream Cheese Stuffed Dates? Dates and cream cheese are 2 of them, of course! Use a moist, soft variety of dates like Kimia and good-quality cream cheese that is free of preservatives and additives.\n\nThe third ingredient is walnuts, which I have used for the crunch factor.\n\nThe fourth ingredient is honey! Dates are naturally sweet, but stuffing them with cream cheese reduces their sweetness quite a bit. Drizzling some honey over the stuffed dates helps balance it out. For best results, use pure honey that does not contain additives.\n\nCheck out the ‘Tips & Tricks’ section of this post to know which ingredient brands I typically use.\n\nHow To Make Cream Cheese Stuffed Dates\n\nHere is how to go about making them.\n\nIngredients (for 10-12 stuffed dates):\n\n10-12 Kimia dates\n\n10-12 walnut kernels\n\nAbout 10 tablespoons of cream cheese or as needed\n\n1-2 tablespoons honey\n\nMethod:\n\nToast the walnuts on medium flame, in a small pan, for a few seconds. Transfer to a plate and allow them to cool down completely.\n\nWhen the walnuts have cooled down fully, chop them up roughly. Keep aside.\n\nSlit open the Kimia dates with a knife and remove the stem, if any. Remove the seeds from the dates. Keep the prepared dates ready.\n\nStuff about a tablespoonful of cream cheese into each de-seeded date.\n\nTake each stuffed date and gently press some of the toasted and chopped walnuts on top of the cream cheese.\n\nPlace all the stuffed dates on a serving platter. Drizzle them with honey. Serve immediately.\n\nRelated Event: Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge\n\nI present this recipe here in assocation with the Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge, which is run by a group of passionate food bloggers.\n\nShhh Cooking Secretly Challenge is a monthly event, wherein the members share recipes based on a pre-determined theme every month. How the group works is rather interesting. The group members are divided into pairs each month, with every pair deciding upon two ingredients secretly, unknown to the rest of the group. Each pair then uses these two ingredients to create a recipe that fits the theme of the month. Upon finishing, everyone posts a picture of their dish in the group, the other members trying to guess the two secret ingredients that have been used therein.\n\nSo, Rafeeda of The Big Sweet Tooth suggested the group theme for October 2023, ‘No Sugar Healthy Desserts’. She suggested we make sweets without refined sugar, avoiding jaggery as well – an apt theme, considering the upcoming festive season where most of us will be prepping sweet treats. Rafeeda made this beautiful Dry Fruit & Nut Kheer for the theme – sweetened with just dates, it looks so tempting and delicious!\n\nI was paired with Mayuri ji, the very versatile blogger at Mayuri’s Jikoni, for the month. I suggested she use ‘sea salt’ and ‘almonds’ as her secret ingredients, and she came up with this gorgeous viral Date Bark that is completely free of refined sugar. Looks so good! To me, Mayuri ji gave the secret ingredients of ‘walnuts’ and ‘cream cheese’, and I used them to make these Cream Cheese Stuffed Dates.\n\nFree Of Refined Sugar, But Not Vegan\n\nThis is a vegetarian recipe that is free of refined sugar. However, dates by themselves contain a considerable amount of natural sugar. Therefore, diabetics should consume this dessert in moderation.\n\nThis recipe is gluten-free. However, it is not vegan because it uses honey and cream cheese.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nYou can use any variety of dates you prefer. For best results, use fresh, moist and juicy ones that aren’t too hard or dry. I find Kimia dates work best in this recipe. I buy them from Ajfan, a specialty dry fruit and nut store here in Bangalore (not sponsored).\n\nAlmonds can be used in place of the walnuts I have used here. Toast them in a similar manner, then chop them up and use them to garnish the stuffed dates.\n\nYou can add chopped cranberries or lemon/orange zest to the cream cheese, for a surprise factor.\n\nYou can mix in some honey with the cream cheese, if you like more sweetness. Here, I haven’t – I just drizzled a little honey over the stuffed dates, and it was just perfect for us. You can even skip the honey completely, if you don’t prefer using it.\n\nMaple syrup can be used in place of the honey, too.\n\nUse good-quality honey and cream cheese, that are free of preservatives and additives. I prefer using honey from organic brands like Svastya Organics, Zizira or Akshayakalpa and cream cheese from Vallombrosa’s (not sponsored).\n\nFor parties and the like, you can make the stuffed dates about a day in advance and keep them chilling in the refrigerator. Take them out of the refrigerator to thaw them at least an hour prior to serving. Drizzle with honey just before serving.\n\nDid you like this recipe?

Sweet corn kernels are cooked in a tomato-based gravy till rich and creamy and delicious. Does that sound like a long, tedious and complicated task? It’s so not! This sabzi is a breeze to put together! Today, let me take you through the process of making Sweet Corn Masala or Makai Ki Sabzi, my way.\n\nMy version of Sweet Corn Masala is a rather simple home-style one, requiring a few basic ingredients from the everyday pantry. It does turn out delish, and the family and I love it to bits. Mine is a no-onion, no-garlic version, but you can use these ingredients too if you prefer. There is minimal oil used, only 1/2 tablespoon, and no cream or other processed ingredients. What, then, makes this sabzi so creamy and decadent? Read on to find out.\n\nLooking for other home-style North Indian sabzis to go with roti? Check out my posts on Palak Paneer, Matar Paneer, No-Fry Paneer Kofta, Pressure Cooker Chana Masala, No-Cream Methi Matar Malai, Dhaba Style Aloo Matar, Baingan Bharta, Aloo Methi, Lehsooni Palak and Dal Makhani.\n\nWhat Goes Into My Sweet Corn Masala\n\nThe most important ingredient here is sweet corn, of course. I would suggest buying fresh corn-on-the-cob, separating the kernels at home, and then using them to make this sabzi. I find that this yields a better-tasting sabzi than using frozen corn kernels, though those could also be used in a pinch.\n\nTomatoes and ginger form the base of the gravy. I use milk to make it creamy, and cashewnuts for thickening it.\n\nApart from salt and turmeric, I use red chilli powder and home-made garam masala to flavour the sabzi. I also add a dash of jaggery powder to make it more flavourful – my Gujju tastebuds expect this, I guess. 🙂\n\nLike I was saying earlier, there is minimal oil that goes into this sabzi. Some cumin is used for the tempering.\n\nLastly, the Makai Ki Sabzi is garnished with finely chopped coriander and, optionally, kasoori methi.\n\nRelated Event: Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge\n\nI am sharing this recipe with you in association with the Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge, which is run by a group of passionate foodies and bloggers. The group members post every month, based on a certain pre-determined theme.\n\nFor the Shhh Cooking Secretly Challenge, the group members are divided into pairs. Each pair agrees upon two ingredients, secretly, without the rest of the group knowing. All the group members then go on to prepare a dish using their own two secret ingredients. Upon completion of this task, everyone posts a picture of their dish in the group. The other members of the group then try to guess the two secret ingredients that have gone into each dish. It’s a super fun exercise, full of creativity and learning!\n\nFor the month of September 2023, it was my turn to suggest the theme and, keeping in mind the festive season that is currently on in India, I thought of going with ‘No Onion, No Garlic Sabzi‘. All the group members came up with absolutely beautiful entries to the theme, including my partner for the month, the very talented Sasmita of First Timer Cook.\n\nSasmita suggested I make something using ‘red chilli powder’ and ‘cumin seeds’ as my secret ingredients, and I decided to use them to showcase this family favourite Makai ki Sabzi.\n\nSweet Corn Masala| Makai Ki Sabzi Recipe\n\nThe detailed recipe follows.\n\nIngredients (serves 4-6):\n\nTo grind together:\n\n1. 4 medium-sized tomatoes\n\n2. A 1-inch piece of ginger\n\n3. 10 cashewnuts\n\nOther ingredients:\n\n1. 2 cups of sweet corn kernels\n\n2. 1/2 tablespoon oil\n\n3. 1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds (jeera)\n\n4. Salt to taste\n\n5. 1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n\n6. Red chilli powder to taste\n\n7. 1/2 tablespoon jaggery powder or to taste (optional)\n\n8. 1/2 teaspoon garam masala or to taste\n\n9. 1 cup boiled and cooled milk\n\n10. 1 tablespoon finely chopped coriander\n\n11. 1 tablespoon kasoori methi (optional)\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Wash the sweet corn kernels well. Drain out the water.\n\n2. Take the corn kernels in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add in enough water to cover the kernels fully, about 1-1/2 cups. Place the pan on high flame and let it heat up. Once the water comes to a boil, reduce flame to medium. Let the corn cook on medium flame till it is tender, 8-10 minutes. Switch off gas at this stage. You will need to stir intermittently. Keep the cooked corn ready.\n\n3. In the meantime, we will prepare the puree that this sabzi requires. Chop the tomatoes into quarters. Peel the ginger and chop finely. Take the chopped tomatoes and ginger in a mixer jar, and add in the cashewnuts. Grind together to a smooth paste. Keep ready.\n\n4. Now, we will start preparing the Sweet Corn Masala sabzi. Heat oil in a heavy-bottomed pan. Add in the cumin seeds, and let them sputter.\n\n5. Reduce the flame to medium, and add in the tomato puree we prepared earlier. Wash the mixer jar with a little water, and add it to the pan too. Mix well.\n\n6. Add a little salt, red chilli powder and turmeric powder. Mix well. Cook on medium flame for 6-7 minutes or till the raw smell of the puree is completely gone and it has thickened up a bit.\n\n7. At this stage, add in the jaggery powder (if using). Also add in the boiled and cooled milk.\n\n8. Also add the cooked corn to the pan, along with the water it was cooked in. You should be left with about 1 cup of water – if you feel it is too much, you can reserve some of the cooking water. Mix well. Cook for 3-4 minutes on medium flame.\n\n9. Add in the garam masala. Taste and adjust the salt as needed.\n\n10. Cook on medium flame for 4-5 minutes more or till the gravy thickens up. Switch off gas when the gravy has thickened up quite a bit, but is still on the runnier side. Remember that it will thicken up further with time.\n\n11. Mix in the finely chopped coriander. If using kasoori methi, crush it between the palms of your hands and add it to the sabzi too. Your Sweet Corn Masala is ready. Serve it warm, with rotis, pooris or parathas.\n\nGluten-Free, But Not Vegan\n\nThis is a completely vegetarian recipe that does not contain onion or garlic.\n\nIt is gluten-free as well. I have used home-made garam masala here, which does not contain any gluten. If you are using store-bought garam masala, do check the ingredient list to make sure it matches your dietary requirements.\n\nThis Makai Ki Sabzi is not vegan, because I have used milk. I haven’t tried making this with vegan (plant-based) miilk.\n\nThis sabzi contains sweet corn (which is naturally quite sweet) as well as some jaggery. Calorie-rich cashewnuts are used in it too. It is, therefore, advisable for diabetics and weight-watchers to consume this in limited portions only.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nI have used sweet corn kernels which I separated from fresh corn on the cob, to make this sabzi. I used a corn peeler (which I bought from Home Centre – not sponsored) to do so. You can also use a knife for this purpose, though a corn peeler makes the job easier.\n\nI prefer using kernels from fresh corn to make this sabzi. However, frozen corn kernels can be used too.\n\nI have used boiled and cooled full-fat milk here.\n\nI like adding a bit of jaggery to my food, and I have done so in this sabzi as well. You may skip it if you don’t prefer using it.\n\nThe colour of the gravy comes from the Aashirwad Bydagi Chilli Powder that I have used. This chilli powder is not overly spicy, which works perfectly for us, and is bright red in colour (not sponsored).\n\nI have used home-made garam masala here, which is quite strong and needs to be used in very little quantities only. If you are using store-bought masala, adjust the quantity as per personal taste preferences.\n\nGoda masala, chana masala and sabzi masala all work perfectly in place of the garam masala. You can even use a mix of chana masala and garam masala.\n\nAlmonds can be used to thicken the gravy, in place of the cashewnuts I have used here.\n\nI have not used onions or garlic here, but you could do so if you want to. Use 1 small onion and about 5 cloves of garlic for 4 medium-sized tomatoes. I have used the sour ‘Nati’ (coutry) tomatoes.\n\nThis sabzi tends to thicken up with time. Remember to switch off the gas when it is still on the runnier side – it will get thicker in some time.\n\nIf you are making the sabzi in advance and it thickens up too much, you can gently reheat it with a little water just before serving.\n\nDid you like this recipe?
