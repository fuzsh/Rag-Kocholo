        "text": "Ahead of ‘Kaanchi’s release, a film written and directed by Subhash Ghai, the filmmaker speaks to us about what went into the making of the film.\n\nWhat is Kaanchi all about?\n\nIt’s a love story of a small-town girl, who becomes the voice of the nation after she fights against the powerful and corrupt. It’s inspiring; it sends out the message, ‘Fear no evil, do what’s right and fight for it’.\n\nWhat made you zero in on Mishti as your lead heroine?\n\nShe has proved that she was born to play Kaanchi. I found a perfect face and a good actor in her. It’s amazing how she carries the whole film with so much ease, despite being raw.\n\nALSO READ: Subhash Ghai’s ‘Kaanchi’ co-stars get ‘carried away’ while shooting for kissing scene\n\nHer look in the poster reminds one of Aishwarya Rai from Taal.\n\nYes, like Mansi of Taal, Kaanchi too believes in revolting against injustice. She is not the Radha of the 80s or Ganga of the 90s, she is a woman of today.\n\nListen to the songs of ‘Kaanchi’ on Gaana.com\n\nYour lead characters often hail from small towns.\n\nThe soul of India still lives in its villages. Ethnic characters bring out the contrast between rural life and the cosmetic world of big cities.\n\nYour films have always had strong female characters (Pardes, Taal, Khalnayak).\n\nI am fascinated when a woman stands equal to powerful men. Their indomitable spirit is most inspiring.\n\nAre you happy with Kartik Aryan and Mishti’s chemistry?\n\nKartik is star material and can share chemistry with anyone. That shows in the film. The two look like they were made for each other.\n\nYou’ve got back to direction after four years. What are your expectations from Kaanchi?\n\nMake a film only when you want to, how long you’ve taken doesn’t matter. Kaanchi is a labour of love. I’ve given it my best.\n\nKaanchi, produced under the banner Mukta Arts, releases April 25.\n\nCredits: Bombay Times, April 24th. Renuka Vyavahare,TNN"
