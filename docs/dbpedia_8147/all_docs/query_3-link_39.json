        "text": "Sometimes we focus too much on goals far in the future and forget about what we need to do today. Want to do well in a course in a few years? If you do not study now and just daydream, you won’t get there. Want to build up a big investment portfolio over time? If you do not start putting in small amounts now and just wait for a big miracle, you are missing out on what consistent effort can do. The little things you do today add up over time. I have seen it myself. Just like how a sea is made of tiny drops, small daily efforts can help you finish your syllabus and grow your investments. Dream big, but break your big dreams into smaller, daily goals. You will be surprised by the results.

Let me try to tell you what I understand. No matter how much we argue that attempts don’t matter and that skills are what count, the reality is that they (attempts) DO matter. As far as I know, Bain is not hiring CAs at the moment. I have seen some posts about McKinsey hiring tax professionals, but BCG has been actively focusing on hiring CAs who have cleared their exams on their first attempt and have a rank of at least one level above CA. But again, why are the criteria so stringent? One reason is that they aim to streamline their hiring process. BCG’s hiring procedure is extensive, involving a month-long process with gifts, buddies (employees from the firm who help candidates through the interview), and sometimes even dinners with partners. Out of 70-80 top rankers who could be eligible, only about 5-10 are selected. They are looking for a combination of excellent communication skills, an outstanding academic background (which they place significant emphasis on), structured thinking, and more. So, I suppose the stringent filter is justified given the prestige of the firms and the intense competition, even among top rankers. It is understandable that these filters can be discouraging. However, in my opinion, it is a positive sign that CAs are now being considered for these roles right after qualifying. Management consulting is undoubtedly a rewarding and challenging career. Currently, the primary paths to enter this field are either to achieve a high rank or to pursue an MBA. Remember, even at top colleges like IIMs, LSR, and SRCC, only a few students are selected for these positions. It is also possible to enter after gaining some years of experience, but you might start in a fresher role, which may not be appealing to everyone.

But when we think about future drops, they can feel intimidating and risky. For example, in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic caused the market to crash. At that time, it felt like everything was falling apart. However, now, just a few years later, that crash is seen as a huge opportunity. Those who invested during the panic have seen their investments grow substantially. (similar to 2008 crash) We often hear the advice to \"buy when everyone is selling,\" but if we are honest with ourselves, we often lack the conviction because the future seems uncertain. Another important point to remember is: \"Do not convert your notional losses into actual losses.\" If the market were to fall by 10-20% today, it might seem like a big risk. People might hesitate to invest, fearing it could drop further. However, in a few years, they might look back and say, \"That was a perfect time to buy!\" I have made a 20-minute video to share my views on how to profit when the market falls, including tips on how you could top up your investments during such times. Let me know your thoughts! (link in comments) Seekhna Shuruh Toh Jeetna Shuru! #NeerajArora #TheMoneyPodcast\n\nNo matter what we say, generational wealth certainly makes a difference. For instance, a person earning 10 LPA can be better off than someone earning 20 LPA if they come from a wealthier family background. A 10 LPA individual (X) might not have to spend on their own house, wedding, or car, thanks to family support. In contrast, a 20 LPA person (Y) might come from a background where the family always lived in rented accommodations. As a result, Y might need to buy the first house for their parents, cover the costs of their own wedding (and sometimes even support siblings’ education), and purchase a car. I know many Ys who have cleared their CA Finals and have followed a similar journey, and I could not be more proud of them. When we say privilege does not matter, it certainly does. It is up to the person with privilege to utilize it effectively. If X does not work as hard as Y, within about 15 years, the situations might reverse, and Y could end up with a better net worth than X. Thoughts? Note: This is just an illustrative example to highlight the impact of privilege. It is not meant to compare individual journeys. Everyone has their own path. #wealth #privilege #gratitude\n\nDocument your life as much as you can. I vlogged for an entire year, and whenever I revisit those vlogs, I feel a deep sense of satisfaction. They allow me to relive the best days of the year, even when I am not feeling at my best. I feel nostalgic looking back at my daughter's life from a few years ago. Many people will tell you to live in the moment, and I agree, but it is also valuable to record memories through photos and videos. This way, when you browse your gallery, you can recall some of the most significant moments of your life. In the busy life of a student or professional, we often forget certain events that are only remembered through photographs and videos. If you are on a trip, take some time to capture a few pictures. It is surely important to strike a balance—if you are spending more time snapping photos than enjoying the moment, that is an issue. Just take a few photos and then immerse yourself in the experience. This is not necessarily for social media, but for yourself. Thoughts? #neerajarora #vlogs #memories #nostalgia\n\nThere is a common confusion in the market: firm or domain? I have a rather biased view, to be honest. I will always recommend that a person go for the best brand name they can get. If you want to get into Statutory Audit but end up in Internal Audit, still go. If you want to get into Direct Tax but end up in Indirect Tax, still go. Unless there is a drastic difference in the type of work you want to do, choose the best firms. The work is not the only reason, the policies at top firms are generally the most organized. While some firms impose restrictions on transfers, leaves, and industrial training, top firms typically offer a generous 30-day notice period and have well-defined leave policies. After qualification, the brand name of the firm can open more doors for you than you might have imagined. If you work at a big firm and perform well (which is likely if you stay long enough), you may receive a placement offer from them. Thus, an offer from a big firm with a clear career trajectory might be available to you even before your results are out. The quality of people you work with and interact with at these firms is unparalleled. Additionally, the stipend at top firms is the highest in the industry. Unless you have very strong reasons to choose a lesser-known firm (relative to the other offers you have), always opt for the firms with the best brand names available! Note: Please note that these are my personal views and recommendations based on my experiences and observations. I understand that each individual’s career path + priorities may differ. If you have a different perspective or disagree with my suggestions, I completely respect that. #91ArticleshipSeries #neerajarora #skill91 #edu91\n\nMany students do not fear failure, they fear their parents. Some parents place so much unexpected pressure on their children that the students are no longer genuinely studying but merely pretending to study longer hours to give the impression of \"working hard.\" Often, this pressure stems from parents' fear that their children might not have a successful future if they do not study hard. It is natural to have these concerns, but it becomes problematic when a child perceives this \"concern\" as \"toxicity.\" After the CA results, my Telegram is flooded with messages asking, \"How can I face my parents?\" It is not just the fear of failure, it is the fear of facing their parents. If only parents would say, \"It is okay, beta. If you did not succeed today, you will succeed tomorrow. We are here for you.\" In an environment where preparing for professional exams takes a toll on a person’s mental well-being, and where loneliness and expectations can become overwhelming, sometimes a person is simply unable to cope. I hope we understand that a person's life is more important than anything else. If parents show a little more confidence in their child's abilities, it can make a world of difference. I am sure you do not want your child to seek support outside, whether through addiction or harmful company, due to a lack of support at home. I am writing this as a teacher. I hope all the parents connected with me will focus on creating a supportive and loving environment, rather than adding to the pressure with high expectations. #parents #love #ca #support\n\nMy experience in a bank audit 👇🏻 Banks will use all sorts of tricks to stop you from conducting the audit. You enter the bank and get treated like royalty—almost like you are the damad of the bank manager. In one of my audits, the bank employees would take us to restaurants on the other side of the city and treat us to chole bhature with lassi. You know what was the main goal? To pass 30-40% of our time with this. (Let us be honest—can you work effectively after such a heavy meal?) Others could often claim the printer was out of order. While this excuse might seem weak now, it was quite common 15-20 years ago. Knowing this, my senior always carried a printer with cartridges in the car to avoid any work stoppage due to such issues. This is why the first bank audits are memorable. You will find that your seniors are experienced in handling all kinds of situations (har cheez ka solution hoga unke pass). To all the CAs and senior articles, what is one funny incident you remember from your client interactions? #ca #91ArticleshipSeries #neerajarora\n\nI recently met the founder of a ~$3 billion company. He shared a strong opinion: he believes the Indian audience is not growing intellectually and is instead focused on quick fixes and easy money. Honestly, I find myself agreeing with him. Many people today are not interested in reading books, listening to podcasts that make them think, exercising regularly, or building a personal brand. Instead, they often stay glued to distracting apps like Instagram and Snapchat. Those who truly commit to avoiding these instant gratifications are already ahead of most people. They are focused and determined. The benefits of their habits might not be immediately visible, but they will definitely show up in a few years. Developing good habits will gradually make you someone who is street-smart, aware, fit, and highly valuable to anyone you work with. On the other hand, falling into bad habits can lead to struggles with career growth, lower pay, poor focus, and health problems. It might seem like the Indian market is overwhelming and the competition is tough. However, the competition is not as intense in specialized fields or management roles. You just need to become someone who stands out as a valuable resource. Remember, it is not about the size of the competition but about how you prepare yourself. Invest in good habits and be patient. Your future self will thank you. Seekhna Shuru Toh Jeetna Shuru! #habits #growth #neerajarora"
