        "text": "In continuation with my Basundi post, I prepared this experimental Bengali styled Mishti Doi with some of the Basundi I have made recently.\n\nBengali Mishti Doi needs no introduction. Originally a sweet yogurt with caramelized sugar for a brownish hue.\n\nMishti Doi is an inseparable part and a must in every Bengali festivals or ceremonial meals as a dessert. A popular dessert in the Eastern states of West Bengal, Orissa as well as in the neighboring country of Bangladesh.\n\nThis used to be a sweetmeat shop bought as well as Mom made dessert back at my hometown.\n\nSuch is my craving for this sweet caramelized dairy produce dessert that in the recent past I have started making this at home with my Ima’s recipe.\n\nI still remember, accompanying my Ima to the local Mishtanno Bhandar or sweetmeat shop a week before she had prepared Mishti Doi at home for the very first time.\n\nThe purpose of visit at that time seemed quite boring for me, definitely I wasn’t keen in knowing the recipe like Ima did as she spoke to the owner, asking about the whole procedure right from selection of the earthen or terracotta pots to boiling the milk and setting the doi in the earthen pots later.\n\nThe aroma of the wet earthen pot holding the doi soaking up the extra water present gave the best taste to the caramelized mass of thick sweetened yogurt that remained after the curd had set.\n\nBeing a simple preparation, this Basundi Mishti Doi can be prepared at home by following the below mentioned instructions.\n\nBasundi Mishti Doi\n\nIngredients\n\n1 1/2 cups (360 ml) Kesar Elaichi Basundi\n\n2 Tbsp Yogurt\n\nMethod\n\n1.Warm the basundi a little, about luke warm. Stir in the yogurt till incorporated well.\n\n2.Pour in the mixture into small earthen or terracotta pots or ramekins and keep in a warm place to set overnight, undisturbed.\n\n3.Remove and refrigerate for few hours. Serve chilled, garnished with slivers of almonds, pistachios and few saffron strands.\n\nNOTE: Make sure that the milk is not too hot when the curd is added, as it will curdle.\n\nWhen in doubt half the recipe and make a small amount.\n\nPublished by Pushpita's Chakhum\n\nHello There! Thanks for stopping by my blog! This is Pushpita Aheibam, a freelance feature writer by profession, food writer and blogger by passion, a wife, homemaker, a mother to an adorable boy and last but not the least a food enthusiast. To me \"Food is about the palate, satiating the taste buds and the tummy, wonderful eating experiences and sweet memories.\" This blog is my personal attempt to retain, cook, and share traditional indigenous delicacies of my home state Tripura, as well as inherited Meitei (Manipuri) delicacies, with available local ingredients. When it comes to cooking and eating, I love to look beyond Manipuri cuisines and cooking too. After all, food knows no boundaries. Hence do find different regional recipes too which are cooked in, and served from my Contemporary Manipuri Chakhum (Kitchen) from time to time. My Ima (Mother), a loving wife, mother of two grown-ups, a homemaker, a Meitei Cuisine expert, a food connoisseur has been the major source of inspiration. Equally inspired by my Ene (Paternal Aunt), Abok Apabi (a Paternal Grandmother of mine), 2 other experts in traditional Meitei Cuisines, several food connoisseurs who I have been following right as a teen. My foodie son and hubby have been motivating me to extend my culinary journey beyond the regular cooking. So the recipes I am sharing are tried, tested in my kitchen and tasted in my home. Enjoy the food journey here in my Chakhum and do try them out in your's. Home cooked love served fresh from my kitchen. Until then happy reading and happy cooking! ~ Pushpita Aheibam View all posts by Pushpita's Chakhum"
