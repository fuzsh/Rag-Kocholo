        "text": "BENGALIS simply cannot do without sweets. They love the soft, luscious stuff that drips. No meal ever ends without one and I am yet to find a Bengali diabetic who agrees with his doctor's contention that sweets can be dangerous. In fact, most Bengalis are convinced that sweets are a panacea for most ailments and that they are actually dieting when they skip a meal and eat a couple of sweets instead. No wonder some of Bombay's loveliest Bengalis agreed to drop whatever they were doing one sultry September afternoon -- at very short notice -- to blind taste mishti doi at the Contractor residence on Malabar Hill.\n\nFarzana brought in the mishti doi in different sized clay pots. Some tiny, a few not so small, and one big pot in which the entire upper crust of the doi - which is always slightly harder than the rest - was entirely missing. All you had was the soggy stuff underneath and that too had been messed around. Some neophyte had obviously run a metal spoon through it and ruined the consistency of the doi much to the disappointment of all of us who were supposed to taste it.\n\nThe doi, we were informed, had come in from three sources: Ganguram in Calcutta, the legendary makers of mishti doi, and from Mishti Bela and Sweet Bengal in Bombay, the two well known Bengali sweet shops that are said to match Calcutta sweet for sweet. We were all asked to identify the mishti doi from Calcutta.\n\nTapur, the most adventurous of us all, swooped down on all the samples and instantly made her choice public. The big pot was the real stuff, she claimed. The rest were very poor Bombay cousins. Tupur, her less adventurous twin, born 12 minutes later, tried the pots out more cautiously but came to an identical conclusion. Bipasha, in moonlight white, dropped a bit of doi on her churidar only to come to the same conclusion. Moon Moon almost retched on the smaller pots and stuck to the big one. I agreed with them by just looking at the quality and colour of the clay pots and, the moment I tasted the doi I knew how huge the difference was.\n\nBadly messed up as it was and minus the upper crust, the mishti doi from Calcutta was still way, way ahead of the others and no true blue Bengali would ever make the mistake of confusing the local doi with the real stuff. It was what any punter would say, No race. Not one of us could have failed the test. The difference was too obvious. The local mishti doi was too red, too feeka, and far, far too sweet. Sickeningly sweet. It slithered around in the pots and caved in too easily to your touch.\n\nThe real stuff was richer but less sweet. It was thick and you could dig into it with your finger or your spoon without it dripping all over you. It had a mature, intelligent taste to it. It was, in other words, entirely Bengali. The fakes were feeka and faltu. There was no sense of history or heritage backing them: it did not require too much of a palette to figure that one out. It was obvious and no Bengali would ever be caught dead eating the stuff. Like no Bengali would ever eat the North Indian sweets that masquerade as Bengali sweets in New Delhi's Bengali Market.\n\nThey would rather face a firing squad of squint-eyed midgets with bad breath. It was an enchanting afternoon and I was finally convinced of what I had always known before, that the loveliest and cleverest Bengali women are brought up, no, not on a diet of lettuce and rabbit feed but on the finest sweets that man has ever discovered.\n\nMoral of the story: The most gorgeous Bengali women are the most difficult to cheat on. They can reckon the real blindfolded."
