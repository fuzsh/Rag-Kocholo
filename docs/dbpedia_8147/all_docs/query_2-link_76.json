I won three prestigious awards there, namely, trophy for the best diligent student and two gold medals for the Best Outgoing Student of the Year and the Jayatee Deshmukh Trust Scholarship for the Best Outgoing Girl Student at the University Level.\n\nPresently I am pursuing my post-graduation in Graphic Design from National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad.\n\nHaving lived in myriad cities during my design education I have learnt and adapted to new people and languages. My journey in design is reflective of all such collective experiences around me."
