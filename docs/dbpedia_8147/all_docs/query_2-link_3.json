Mishti is introduced as a 6-7 year old, mischevious and sweet child. She is being pampered by Singhanias' as she's the youngest grandchild of the house. Mishti is close to her step-cousins, Naksh, Gayu and Naira.\n\n7 years later[]\n\nMishti is now a teenager who is suffering from short stature. She has a close friendship with Maheshwaris' granddaughter, Kuhu. Post Naira's return, Mishti and Kuhu become close to her and try to unite Naira and Kartik. Post Akshara's death and Naman is arrested for attempting to kill Naitik, Karishma too moves on her life. Hence, Devyani decides to send Mishti to Maheshwaris', for her well-being.\n\n2 years later[]\n\nMishti is now grown up and lives with Maheshwaris', who have taken care of her as their own. She shares a sister bond with Kuhu and hates Devyani, thinking she abandoned her."
