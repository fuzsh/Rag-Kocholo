        "text": "Read\n\nMay 15, 2023\n\nFrom the outside, Ciara has a picture-perfect life. Her best friend Mishti has found herself discontent in her arranged marriage. And their neighbor Lauren, ostracized from the neighborhood, finds an unlikely ally in Mishti. When one of them is found dead, it seems the perfect time for everyone to start airing some dirty laundry. Utterly engrossing.\n\nMarch 10, 2023\n\nMy Reviews Can Also Be Found On:\n\nTwitter - Amazon - Storygraph - The Book Review Crew\n\n3.5 Stars\n\nWhat a delectable domestic suspense this was, and even though there is a body at the bottom of the stairs we do not know how or why. I felt this was more character driven than plot. And what a cast of characters they are. It's no wonder Ciara is found the way she is. (Not a spoiler as it is in the blurb and the first pages of the book.) Ciara is a character you love to hate and boy did I loathe her. Then we have hippy dippy Lauren and the Calcutta, India transplant, Mishti. All three of them have husbands and personalities that I found lacking.\n\nI liked that the book is told from all the women's points of view and that there are then and now sections of the book. I found the story engaging and it held my interest throughout. I don't usually enjoy books where there is no one to root for but I liked this one. The ending was surprising if a little sad and I love books that can make me feel something. Three and a half stars rounded up.\n\nThank you to NetGalley and the publisher for the Advance Readers Copy.\n\nJanuary 28, 2023\n\nI would have to say, neighborhood /domestic thrillers are probably my favorite reads!\n\nI‚Äôm always apprehensive when I see the word ‚Äòdebut.‚Äô Not now! Disha Bose wrote an unputdownable, suspenseful read that won‚Äôt stop racing through my mind!\n\nThree couples, all neighbors in a small village:\n\nCiara and Gerry are successful, proudly living in the largest home on the block. In Gerry‚Äôs mind, his wife keeps herself busy posting on Instagram. Well, not quite. Little does he know she‚Äôs a very popular influencer, managing to secretly stash away a small fortune of her own.\n\nLauren and Sean are the outliers to the neighborhood. Everyone has an opinion about them, none of which are good. Poor Laura desperately wants to fit in‚Ä¶but she just can‚Äôt help herself.\n\nMishti and Parth, a couple who are together thanks to an arranged marriage. With seemingly nothing in common other than their shared daughter.\n\nThe author really brought all these characters to life in vivid detail! You have an glimpse inside each marriage and friendship. Not only the side of themselves they show the world, but revealing their own hidden insecurities as well.\n\nMishti was my favorite character, and I‚Äôm sure many readers will feel that same way. She unselfishly put her own needs and happiness aside to appease everyone else in her life. I‚Äôll be honest‚Ä¶She kind of broke my heartüíî\n\nNow one member of this neighborhood group has been found dead. You‚Äôll find out who right away. But the storyline takes you deep into the inner-workings of the neighborhood to root out the guilty party and their motive. Enjoy the journey!\n\nI am so glad I had the opportunity to read this book! This author is highly talented and I cannot wait to read more of her books in the future!\n\nThank you to Random House Publishing Group via Netgalley\n\nApril 4, 2023\n\n3.5 ‚≠êÔ∏è rounded up!\n\n‚ÄúBEHIND THE FILTERS, REALITY IS LESS POLISHED‚Äù\n\nThree neighbors, all with imperfect lives‚Ä¶\n\nCiara Dunphy presents a picture perfect life on Instagram. Her brand began with skin care, but she has become the Queen Bee of the neighborhood, and her circle of friends now seek out mothering advice from the mother of two little ones. Only her husband knows how badly she is really coping behind closed doors-but she won‚Äôt allow him to help.\n\nFortunately, for Mishti Guha, the demure wife of an Immigrant from Calcutta, Ciara welcomed her into her clique. She has been perpetually COLD since moving to Ireland, and persistently lonely, since her husband, chosen for her by her well meaning parents, offers her no warmth or companionship. At least she has her daughter, Maya.\n\nMishti may be from a different continent now, but she immediately recognizes that the ‚Äúrules of engagement‚Äù between women are the same in Ireland as they were back home. It doesn‚Äôt take her long to realize that her other neighbor, Lauren, is the outcast in their community. She knows who she should align herself with.\n\nDressing in long floating skirts, paired with brightly patterned blouses, Lauren doesn‚Äôt dress like the others, and her three small children happily running half naked in her yard make her the butt of cruel jokes. But, she speaks her mind, and holds her ground. She isn‚Äôt afraid of Ciara.\n\nNow, one of them is dead, and anyone could be to blame.\n\nAlthough we don‚Äôt know who is responsible until the last 20% or so, this ISN‚ÄôT really much of a murder mystery.\n\nIt IS an entertaining novel of domestic suspense, about three women, trying to hide their dirty laundry‚Äù. üß∫ And, it was a fun palette cleanser between darker reads.\n\nSOAPY and SUDSY, what makes this one a bit UNIQUE is that Mishti is in an arranged marriage which isn‚Äôt like the arranged marriages of friends and family back home, but also isn‚Äôt like the marriages of her new contemporaries either. The contrasts are interesting.\n\n3.5 stars rounded up for bringing something new to the ‚Äúneighborhood genre‚Äù!\n\nThis is a debut from author Disha Bose, who was born in India but now resides in Ireland, lending authenticity to the story.\n\nI WILL be watching for her next novel!\n\nA buddy read with DeAnn. Check out her review to see if she enjoyed it too.\n\nAVAILABLE NOW!\n\nThank You to NetGalley and Ballantine Books for the invitation to read this! It was my pleasure to offer a candid review!\n\nMarch 31, 2023\n\nCiara Dunphey is the picture of perfection. She's Instagram famous and is married to well-to-do Gerry and they have two children together. She's also the most popular woman in their village and she always has an entourage of kiss ass women following her around. *smooch smooch*üòö\n\nOne of her entourage is Mishti, who recently moved here from Calcutta with her husband of arrangement, Parth. They have a loveless marriage but a beautiful daughter that Mishti loves more than anything. She isn't sure why the popular Ciara has taken her under her wing but she'll do whatever it takes to stay there. Better to be part of the clique than the outcast.\n\nSpeaking of the outcast, that would be Lauren. Lauren is a bit bohemian with her long flowing skirts and disheveled appearance. Married to an older man and with three kids that can often be seen running naked through the yard. Her and Ciara have never seen eye to eye and Ciara makes sure that no one she's friends with will ever befriend Lauren.\n\nNow one of them is dead and their dirty laundry is about to be aired out and exposed.\n\nThere isn't enough bleach to cleanse these lost souls. Talk about terrible people. Mishti is the only exception. Ciara and Lauren are just awful and the husbands? Oh boy, they're even worse. It's one of those books that you just can't look away from. It's a spin cycle of secrets that will have you feeling much better about your own life. Trust me.\n\nSharp writing and short chapters make this a page-turner. So I say pop some popcorn, pour some wine, and settle in for some gossip galore. Your laundry can always wait until tomorrow. 4 stars!\n\nThank you to NetGalley and Random House Publishing Group - Ballantine for my complimentary copy.\n\nJanuary 30, 2024\n\nI don‚Äôt usually read Domestic thrillers but this had me hooked from the very beginning to the very end, Disha Bose did her best to keep you thinking you had it then bang ‚ùóÔ∏è she threw you completely sideways I loved this one.\n\nCiarra Dunphy was in a loving relationship had three children married & had it all a beautiful üè† house was followed by thousands on instagram but inside she was falling apart.\n\nMisti her best friend from Calcutta she had an arranged marriage Ciarra didn‚Äôt have many friends so they suited each other.\n\nThen Lauren who everyone hated as she used to pick on kids at school partner Shaun who was a devoted father.OR WAS HE!!\n\nThis was the most twisty domestic thriller that I have read the characters were unlikeable I didn‚Äôt like any of them.\n\nThere is a murder of Cara found dead in her home who would do this & why?\n\nWhat this means for Mishti , Lauren & Shaun turns their ideal world upside down highly recommended all the happy dance. üíÉ stars üåü\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nI have a love/hate relationship with unlikeable characters. I don‚Äôt have to like them, but I do have to find them interesting. There has to be some nuance to their personalities, something that makes them three dimensional. Dirty Laundry could win a prize for the most unlikeable characters. Ciara is supposedly the perfect mother according to her Instagram account. But she was a b**ch, plain and simple. The things she thinks are acceptable behavior! My eyes were rolling. Her friend, Mishti was in an arranged marriage with an absentee husband. He treats her like she‚Äôs the hired help. Lauren is the outcast. It‚Äôs a small town and she‚Äôs never been accepted. Her partner, Sean, is unemployed, undependable and unfaithful, but she‚Äôs ok with that. She is living proof love can be blind. These three female characters weren‚Äôt nuanced, if anything, they were pretty flat. But I was curious to see if Mishti and Lauren would grow backbones and become independent.\n\nThe story goes back and forth in time and switches between the three women. The reader is told early on about a murder but this can‚Äôt really be considered a murder mystery.\n\nThis was entertaining, an easy read. It doesn‚Äôt really cover any new ground but I truly wanted to see how it would play out. I thought the ending worked well.\n\nMy thanks to Netgalley and Random House- Balllantine Books for an advance copy.\n\nMarch 15, 2023\n\nThree couples who couldn‚Äôt be more different live in a village near Cork, Ireland. There‚Äôs Gerry and ‚Äòflawless‚Äô Ciara Dunphy, an Instagram sensation featuring skincare routines and children! Her daughter Bella is, shall we say, challenging, and Ciara is being pushed to her limits so much so that she‚Äôs itching to pick a fight today. Maybe she‚Äôll pick one with Gerry, there might be some justification in that but her target is much more likely to be Lauren Doyle. Lauren has been sleep deprived for years and she has her own issues with partner Sean but she thinks she‚Äôs way luckier than Ciara though she‚Äôs aware things have to change. Finally, there‚Äôs Misthti and Parth Guha and theirs is an arranged marriage and it‚Äôs fair to say that Parth treats Mishti like a servant. She is from Kolkata and is perpetually cold in the changeable Irish climate. Ciara and Mishti have been good friends but things are a tad cooler lately. The unfolding shebang is certainly dramatic and centres around Ciara which is just the way she likes it!\n\nWell, this lot need to get a boil wash on pronto as there‚Äôs plenty of dirty Irish linen on display for your delectation and delight! I love the way Disha Bose draws you into these peoples lives and makes it feel almost like viewing a fly in the wall television drama as we rarely know exactly what goes on behind closed doors. Desperate Housewives eat your heart out!! This is a fascinating insight into the dynamics of marriage and relationships, warts and all. You also are witness different styles of parenting or lack of. Despite the fact that‚Äôs there is friendship and marriage, there‚Äôs also loneliness in places you least expect it.\n\nThe characterisation is very good, Mishti is my favourite character as bless her, she‚Äôs so out of her depth. Ciara is an acquired taste at the very least. Most of the characters are unlikeable and all of the men are worth diddly squat having their own very dirty laundry. Wash it yourselves chaps. The storyline builds and the doo doo definitely hits the fan in a really entertaining ending.\n\nOverall, this is an enjoyable and entertaining novel and it‚Äôs clear Disha Bose is talented. Can‚Äôt wait to read what\n\nshenanigans she imagines next!\n\nWith thanks to NetGalley and especially to Penguin General UK for the much appreciated arc in return for an honest review.\n\nOctober 15, 2022\n\nI‚Äôm quite disappointed with this book. Nearly the first 40-50% of the book was fluff that could‚Äôve been trimmed or cut all together. I found myself quite bored. Once the story did finally pick up, it was completely rushed and crammed into the last 15% of the book which is disappointing; with no true resolution. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this book.\n\nFebruary 6, 2023\n\nDirty Laundry is a novel by Disha Bose, a new author I found on Goodreads and NetGalley. Listed as a recommendation for mystery lovers in 2023, I eagerly received an early copy and added it to my January queue. I very much enjoyed the book but I will say, all of the characters except for Mishti were truly horrible people. And I'm not entirely sure if that was meant to be the case. Several couples (parents with toddler children) in a small country village where social media is all the rage. They basically spar with each other over how to raise children, each trying to up the other with curating a social media presence that's not an accurate depiction of their lives. It all started with a very rude encounter between two women and went further south quickly. I must say, they were both in need of a good therapist, and they should've had their kids taken away from them. While they might be semi-decent mothers, they were teaching such poor values, those kids will be monsters in the future. Okay, rant done... all that to say is it's pretty powerful when an author can create this type of emotion in a reader. So... the story follows the women through a few years and culminates in the death of one of them. By the time you figure out the relationships between all the couples, it becomes an intriguing puzzle to solve, but it's really not a mystery in the typical sense. It's a drama about the lengths people go to prove they are happy when in reality, they are desperately in need of a dose of the truth about themselves. Even Mishti has her troubles and does a few not-so-nice things, but mostly, I felt a lot of sympathy for her throughout the story and understand why she took the steps she did at certain points in time. Great book, can't wait to see what else the author dreams up.\n\nFebruary 4, 2023\n\nI‚Äôm conflicted about this book! Usually, I feel pretty strongly one way or another, but this book is a bit different. The first 75-80% is about three women in a small Irish town:\n\nCiara is the perfect Instagram mom, posting skincare tips and parenting advice. Her husband, Gerry, is completely uninterested in her (and seemingly his own children). Other women want to be her, even though they know her life isn‚Äôt anything like what she shows off online.\n\nLauren has always been a bit of a loner, and she definitely feels like an outcast, even in adulthood. She‚Äôs in somewhat of a common-law marriage with Sean, who seems to think they are in an open relationship (although Lauren never agreed to those terms). They have three children together, and while life together used to be good, their relationship has now flatlined.\n\nMishti is a woman from India, living in an arranged marriage with Parth, but pining for another man from her hometown of Calcutta. Her husband treats her like property, and she‚Äôs made very few friends since being in Ireland. Her daughter is about the only thing keeping her going, as she really doesn‚Äôt have much else in her life.\n\nThese characters are written well, and were all entertaining in their own ways. The part that threw me until the end was why we were learning everything about these women and what it would lead to. They all had decent stories that intertwined nicely, but it took a long time to get to the big twists and the action.\n\nI wouldn‚Äôt call this a page-turner, but it was good, and short enough that I still finished it in one sitting. I liked disliking the characters, and the ending was done quite well. I‚Äôm giving this 3.5 stars, rounded up for being a debut novel. These women all had dirty laundry, indeed!\n\n(Thank you to Random House - Ballantine, Disha Bose, and NetGalley for the ARC in exchange for my review. This book is slated to be released on April 4, 2023.)\n\nOctober 23, 2023\n\n2‚≠ê\n\nGenre ~ domestic neighborhood drama\n\nSetting ~ Ireland\n\nPublication date ~ April 4, 2023\n\nPage Count ~291 (39 chapters p+e)\n\nAudio length ~ 8 hours 39 minutes\n\nNarrator ~ Chandrika Narayanan-Mohan\n\nPOV ~ multiple 3rd\n\nFeaturing ~ debut, 2 parts ~ then & now, dated chapters, infidelity, references to suicide, slow burn, verbal abuse\n\nMishti, Lauren & Ciara are our main characters and I did not like or care about what happened to any of them, not a one. That goes for the husbands, too.\n\nMishti is in arranged marriage with Parth. Lauren is our bohemian mom and girlfriend to Sean. Ciara, our social media influencer (blah), is married to Gerry and is dead and we don't know why or whodunit until the end. I liked the mystery involving this, but not the why.\n\nI liked that these mom's each bring something different to the friendship circle, so that was nice that they each have their own personality, but that's not to say they have a great one.\n\nOverall, this was very slow moving for me with a lot of character development and full of drama. I was not a fan of the ending either. Really Lauren??\n\nSide note ~ the cover looks cool.\n\nThere are quite a few fans of this one, so don't let me deter you. It's an editor's pick on Amazon, too. And apparently a Good Morning America pick.\n\nI was able to listen to an audio copy as well.\n\nNarration notes:\n\nWas not a super big fan. She was a bit nasally, which was distracting. She did alter her voices slightly for each POV, so that was good.\n\n*Thanks to the author, Random House and NetGalley for the ARC.

Okay, so I have yet to find a neighborhood stabby I enjoyed quite like I did Liane Moriarty‚Äôs take on things, but this is a pretty decent selection if you‚Äôre looking for some poolside fun this summer.\n\nThe story here takes place in a village about an hour away from Cork City. Ciara is the Instagrammer with the most influence, and all the other mammies in the ‚Äòhood follow her parenting, style and child-rearing advice religiously. Oh, and also she‚Äôll be dead before the end of the prologue. The remainder of the story is figuring out just who did the whodunit where . . . .\n\nAnd I had no idea who it was going to be because it could have been anyone.\n\nThis didn‚Äôt have the humor or snark or likeability factor when it came to the characters like others I have loved in this sort of category, but it certainly kept me turning pages!\n\n3.5 Stars\n\nMay 13, 2023\n\nThis was a mess of a book, but in a fun way. It isn't the best domestic thriller that I've read, but it was interesting learning more about the intimate details of this small Irish village. 3.5 Stars\n\nDirty Laundry follows three women, Lauren, Mishti, and Ciara, as they navigate the ins and outs of a small Irish Village. Ciara who is close friends with Mishti is considered the \"queen bee\" of the all the moms and absolutely loathes Lauren who's more of an outcast. However, when Ciara reveals information that pushes Mishti towards having a closer relationship with Lauren, she begins to feel as though she's losing control. Eventually, she turns up dead and readers are taken back in time to figure out all of the details of the characters and community that could be responsible for Ciara's untimely death.\n\nWhat Worked: I love a messy story! And to be quite honest, the foundation of this story is built upon the messiness of each character. I appreciated that Bose took the time and effort to carefully develop the personality of each character. They were well rounded, interesting, and perfectly imperfect. As a result, I was extremely interested in the revelation of the character responsible for the death of Ciara and learned some not so great things about their husbands along the way. Clearly, this is a testament to Bose's skills as a writer. She was able to drag me into this town and get me invested in their drama as if I was a part of the community.\n\nWhat Didn't Work: Towards the end of the book, it became quite clear who was primarily responsible for the death Ciara. While Bose attempted to throw curveballs to distract readers from the responsible individual, it was pretty obvious. Additionally, Ciara isn't a likeable character. She does horrible things to the other characters and exhibits no remorse. When she does die, I can't say that I actually cared and I'm not sure whether that was Bose's intent or not. By creating such an unlikeable character, I ended up not caring about her death which almost led to me not caring about the book as I got closer to the end. I think it's a hard balance to the balance between keeping readers invested in the story and introducing unlikeable characters and centering the narrative around them.\n\nOverall, this was a solid domestic thriller. I'm interested in checking out what Bose does in the future.\n\nMarch 12, 2024\n\n*cloud library app*\n\nNot bad for what it is.. sometimes you just need to have a book where you are just along for the ride.\n\nI liked and disliked two of the main females, the other povs were okay and \"meh\" for me. I sympathized with the one person but could also see where it could have gone another way as well.\n\nI went into this blind other than a vague remembrance of the plot and would suggest the same way (up to you of course). For me, it was more fun that way with this one.\n\nIt was a good one for distracting me from real life stress, so hats off to the author there üëçüèº.\n\nIs it the best thriller I've read? Not really (I've read a fair few though, and some crime books ) but it's not the worst either.\n\nNarration was good and I loved it was set in Ireland even though we didn't get to see much of it outside the neighborhood.\n\nGrab your popcorn üçø and enjoy the ride:).\n\nApril 1, 2023\n\nThis was most definitely not for me. I would say reading this was the equivalent to watching a bad episode on bravo where literally nothing happens, you just learn about the characters. I kept waiting for the tea to spill but there was nothing, it‚Äôs called Dirty Laundry insinuating there must be secrets to be aired. The title is the most interesting part of the book. Without spoilers basically something very ‚ÄúC-list‚Äù happens in the first 10% of the book, the next 80% is nonsensical background that barely carries the plot, last 10% it‚Äôs finally over. Dirty Laundry? More like a shirt you wore for 3 hours.\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\nThe beautiful Ciara Dunphy and her handsome, successful husband Gerry have it all‚Äî the large, beautiful home, the two perfect children, the blissfully happy home life, the perfect family picture. They are the envy of all the neighbors whose wives want to be Ciara and the husbands who want to be with her. Ciara is a successful influencer on social media, selling skin care products and giving ideal parenting advice. Of course, her reality is anything but the perfection she portrays on social media. Her best friend, Mishti Guha, lives on the same street with the standoffish husband picked for her by her parents in Calcutta. Mishti always feels cold in Ireland, and is trying to raise a daughter in a country where no one looks like her. Lauren Grady is a mom of three whose garden butts up against Ciara‚Äôs; she is the outcast of the neighborhood friend and internet mothers‚Äô groups that fawn all over Ciara. She was born and bred in the village, and has been made the target of nasty jokes and comments. She is the only imperfection in Ciara‚Äôs world, and as a result is the one shunned by them all. However, she may have found a very unlikely sympathetic ally in Mishti. When Ciara is found dead in her immaculate home, everyone around her could be considered a suspect. It seems like the perfect time to deflect the blame onto someone else by airing all of their ‚ÄúDirty Laundry.‚Äù\n\nThis is an incredible, wonderfully dark, attention-grabbing debut by author Disha Bose! I was drawn in from the beginning and completely hooked, following every twist and turn to the conclusion. I felt as if I were watching reality television, observing the interaction of the entire neighborhood from the comfort of my favorite reading chair. From the very beginning, the clique of women who shun one mother as an outsider based on the opinion of the ‚Äúpopular one‚Äù gave me serious high school mean girl vibes. Once you‚Äôve been bullied and ostracized by the mean girl, everyone will stick to her like glue. They‚Äôve seen the way she‚Äôs treated you, and the one way to prevent themselves from the same rejection is to follow her lead. For some people, old high school attitudes never grow up; once someone is labeled ‚Äúan enemy‚Äù to the leader of the group, the entire group considers that person the enemy. That‚Äôs definitely the case here, with Ciara struggling to maintain a false, perfect front or trying to claim she is the‚Äúvictim‚Äù to the others for ‚Äúlikes‚Äù on her profile, pictures, and comments. We all know/have known a ‚ÄúCiara‚Äù or two in our personal lives! ‚ÄúDirty Laundry‚Äù is a domestic thrill ride and a commentary on social media and society in general. I was captivated, and look forward to more of Disha Bose‚Äôs work in the future.\n\nI‚Äôd like to thank NetGalley, Disha Bose, and Ballantine Books/Random House for the opportunity to read and review this ARC.\n\nJuly 17, 2023\n\nCiara Dunphy appears to have it all... a loving husband, perfect children and a beautiful home in a small Irish village ...until she's found murdered and the false facade comes crumbling down. Two other village women along with Ciara form the \"best friend's circle... Mishti Guha, also a mother, who is just plain \"different\", for lack of a better word...from the others... and Lauren Doyle, also a mother, who usually finds herself the target of most of the small village folk's nasty jokes, become close-knit, unlikely allies. When Ciara is murdered, secrets start to come uncovered. What seemed to be \"perfect\" now is reveled for what it really was. It seems that everyone has something to be gained from Ciara's murder. In order to keep the blame from themselves, her friends turn into enemies and begin to air each other's \"dirty laundry\"....and there is a plethora of it to go around. Readers will see how delicate, intricate and complicated the fabric of friendship often is as well as the motivations to keep up appearances. We quickly learn the truth of nothing is ever as it seems.\n\nDecember 20, 2022\n\n3.5 stars\n\nI have to confess to feeling a little bit let down by this story. Disha Bose has created such a thoroughly unlikeable character as Ciara (who I'd have cheerfully murdered after only a few pages) but the rest of the story didn't quite live up to the promise of the first few chapters.\n\nDon't get me wrong, it would make a good holiday read but it certainly didn't have the twists and turns of the sort of thriller I really enjoy. It was just a little too tame for me.\n\nCiara is an excellent character though - self-centred, obsessed with social media, loves the power she wields in her social circle but its not entirely clear how she has ended up with this power. Her husband seems utterly superfluous to the plot, as do quite a few of the other characters. Although we have to follow each to find out who is responsible for Ciara's death.\n\nMishti who has settled in Ireland with her psychiatrist husband (both of whom are dissatisfied with their arranged marriage) has fallen under Ciara's spell but again its not clear why (apart from one very early incident) Mishti continues to be friends with someone so clearly manipulative.\n\nWe also have Lauren who appears to have no friends (and again, despite her living in the same village it is not clear exactly why nobody likes her). Lauren is a target for Ciara's taunts so she's a prime suspect.\n\nThen we have 3 men - Ciara's ineffectual but successful husband Gerry, Mishti's husband Parth and Lauren's husband Sean - all of whom Ciara has bound to her in some way.\n\nThere are all the ingredients for a truly suspenseful tale but by the end I wasn't really bothered how Ciara had died or why. Like I said, early promise which ran out for me. I'd definitely pick up another book by this author because I think she'll definitely hone her craft in future stories. One to come back to I hope.\n\nApril 14, 2023\n\nGood Morning America book of the month. I can only assume none of them ever read it.\n\nNovember 23, 2022\n\nThe plot here is good and I never mind a cast of unlikeable characters and these are highly unlikeable! A lot of envy, greed, selfishness and the pitfalls of social media are present. I thought the pacing was good and enjoyed the twist.\n\nThe comparison I‚Äôve seen of this debut to Desperate Housewives is a good one. If you are in the mood to read about some self absorbed, awful couples, these three truly fit the bill! Very entertaining and funny in a sadly relatable way in our society today. Thank you to NetGalley for an early copy in exchange for an honest review.\n\nMay 23, 2023\n\nDisha Bose is an emerging voice that stands out in what's becoming a blessedly saturated genre, domestic suspense! If you're craving something along the lines of Desperate Housewives, or Big Little Lies, this one will definitely quench your thirst - I really enjoyed it!\n\nAptly-named, Dirty Laundry centers around three women who all live in the same small village in Ireland. Ciara Dunphy is a social media lifestyle influencer who has it all: a loving and attractive husband who makes very good money, a beautiful home and adorable well-behaved children. All of the local moms follow her online mothering advice and pretty much idolize her. You could say Ciara is the queen bee of the village. Little do her followers, as well as her neighbors know, she's got a very secret life riddled with big-time problems. Looks can definitely be very deceiving when it comes to Ciara!\n\nMishti Guha is Ciara's best friend and recent immigrant from India. She is married to Parth, via an arranged marriage, but they have very little in common and even though they've been married several years now, Mishti knows very little about her husband, and finds herself secretly longing for an old flame back home in Calcutta!\n\nLauren Doyle is the local outcast. She's not one to follow any recent trend, and doesn't care what other people think of her, or her family. She's used to being the ostracized one, and the butt-end of everyone's jokes. Lauren doesn't have any friends, but she's okay with that because she loves her husband and her two beautiful children beyond measure. Then suddenly Lauren uncovers an incredible betrayal, now she's determined to stand up to those who have always bullied her once and for all...namely Ciara Dunphy.\n\nWhen Lauren goes to Ciara's home to confront her only to find her lying dead at the bottom of her stairs, she's not exactly shocked, nor is she grieving her lifelong nemesis. All she knows is that somebody apparently beat her to the task of shutting Ciara up for good, but who could have possibly wanted her dead? Come to find out, there are many people Ciara has mistreated over the years, many more than perhaps she herself even realized! But who had the intestinal fortitude to shut her up for good?!\n\nAs this slow, intense mystery unraveled and shocking secrets were exposed one after another, I found myself at the edge of my seat and completely captivated! After the first couple of chapters, which were introductory and character building, I was absolutely hooked! This felt like a classic guilty-pleasure, in the best way possible. The development of all of the complex, and incredibly flawed yet intriguing characters is what drew me in, but the heart-stopping suspense and mystery elements really impressed me, up until the last page!\n\nThis is a novel domestic suspense lovers need to read, you'll be talking about it (and maybe comparing the characters to those in your real life?) for days!!\n\nApril 12, 2023\n\nI really, really liked this one! It is full of drama between three women who are neighbors. We have the social media star, the outcast, and the arranged marriage bride. This follows the ebbs and flow of their relationship with each other, and their husbands. Of course there is a murder. The author did a great job building up the characters and it was impossible to know who did the killing. Everyone had a reason.\n\nNovember 22, 2022\n\nWhile this book was well-written, there was not a single character with whom I could empathize. Characters had few to no redeeming qualities and when I reached the end, it was not satisfying. Perhaps it is a good representation of 'real life' but not a book I would recommend spending one's valuable time reading.\n\nJanuary 26, 2024\n\nCerridwen is an Instagram celebrity. She blogs, videos and posts pics of her ‚Äúperfect‚Äù family daily. Everyone loves her, except her neighbor Lauren. The two of them have tolerated each other but sincerely dislike each other.\n\nWhat lies below the surface is that Cerridwen‚Äôs perfect family is anything but perfection. Cerra, hates her life, her children drive her crazy, she doesn‚Äôt like her husband, and she‚Äôs having an affair with her enemies boyfriend. She‚Äôs also attracted to her best friends husband.\n\nEverything is coming to a head for Cerra, she‚Äôs ending the affair, she‚Äôs decided that her bff‚Äôs husband isn‚Äôt worth the effort and no longer finds him attractive. Cerra‚Äôs husband loads up the kids and takes them to his mother‚Äôs house. He‚Äôs learned of the affair and has decided he‚Äôs leaving and divorcing Cerra.\n\nHer lover after having admitted he loves Cerra, decides he‚Äôd rather stay with Lauren after Cerra tells him they‚Äôre done. What happens next is shocking‚Ä¶\n\nThis is a good book. I enjoyed reading it and was very surprised by the ending.\n\n4/5 üåü\n\n0/5 üå∂Ô∏è\n\nThis entire review has been hidden because of spoilers."
