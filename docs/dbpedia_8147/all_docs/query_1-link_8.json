        "text": "Mishti doi, or sweetened yogurt, is one of the delights of visiting Kolkata. The city formally known as Calcutta is a cultural hub in northeastern India, and the local Bengalis revel in their culture which is steeped in ancient tradition. Part of that tradition is food, and Bengali cooking is something quite apart from the rest of Indian cooking. Bengalis, both in Indian West Bengal and in Bangladesh, are famed for their desserts, and mishti doi is the one which evokes some of the fondest memories for many.\n\nMaking true mishti doi is an art form which requires great skill and patience. Milk must be boiled down, then caramelised sugar and yogurt culture added in the correct amounts, before the dish is left in a warm spot to set. Only hours later do you find out whether the dish has been successful or not – and I admit I have failed many times.\n\nLuckily for mere mortals like myself, salvation is at hand, with a quick microwavable recipe which tastes (if not looks) almost the same! Real mishti doi should be caramel brown with a silky appearance, while this one turns out white with a slightly mousse-like texture – but it still turns out a sinfully delicious approximation of the original Bengali taste.\n\nMishti Doi\n\nServes 4, takes 10 minutes to prepare (3 hours to set)\n\nIngredients\n\n500g full cream Greek yogurt, or dahi\n\n395g (1 can) sweetened condensed milk\n\nwhole almonds, chopped\n\nYou’ll need\n\nA microwave-safe bowl\n\nMethod\n\n1. Whisk the yogurt in a microwave-safe bowl until it is smooth.\n\n2. Whisk in the condensed milk until smooth.\n\n3. Microwave the yogurt on medium – high heat for 3 minutes.\n\n4. Lightly touch the centre of the yogurt to see if it’s set. If yogurt sticks to your finger (ie – it’s still semi-liquid), then microwave it for a further 1 minute.\n\n5. Remove the dish from the microwave and allow it to cool for 1 hour. Once it has reached room temperature, refrigerate until cold.\n\n6. Spoon it out into small dishes and top with chopped almonds. Around the sides, a hard, cheesy crust may have formed – while this isn’t bad, the choicest bit is the soft sweet yogurt centre."
