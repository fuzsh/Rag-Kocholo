Misti Doi is just an upscale version where the yogurt is sweetened with Caramelised Sugar or Date Palm Jaggery. This is possibly the most popular and beloved sweet dish in Bengal. Sometimes date palm jaggery harvested in the winter (nolen gur) is the choice of sweetener, and this gives Mishti Doi a characteristic golden brown or reddish colour and also a slight smoky flavour.\n\nToday, I’m sharing with you the version using caramelised sugar! I already have a detailed post on Mishti Doi, where I prepare it slightly different! You can check out the recipe HERE. That doesn’t mean the other method did not work, it just took a little longer to set. Try and see which one works best for you! Both the recipes work well but I found that the method I’m sharing today works great if you are living in cold climatic conditions like I do! This also give a very creamy & rich Mishti Doi.\n\nDespite its immense popularity, Mishti Doi is rarely prepared at home, possibly because it is widely available in practically every mithai shop in every neighbourhood in Bengal. Also, it takes planning and you need to make it at least a day in advance before you can eat it.\n\nHow simple is Mishti Doi Preparation\n\nAlthough the misti doi recipe requires only three ingredients, and even though the process is fairly simple with minimum prep and effort, it does requires some planning and you need to make it at least a day in advance before you can eat it. You will also need patience to make this scrumptious sweet as it has a waiting time of around 8 to 12 hours for the yogurt to set depending on the climatic conditions where you live.\n\nThe rich, smooth, creamy goodness of Mishti Doi is so addictive that can’t stop after one spoonful.\n\nBefore getting into the recipe, I would like to throw some light on some key points!\n\nIngredients for Bengali Mishti Doi Recipe:\n\nMilk – Misti doi can be made light by using just full fat milk or creamier like flan by using condensed milk mixed with heavy cream. I’m just using full fat milk.\n\nHung Curd – You will need to drain out any excess water from the yogurt. This will ensure a much thick texture to the sweetened yogurt.\n\nSugar or Jaggery – I usually prepare with caramelised sugar. You can also make Misti Doi using date palm jaggery.\n\nFlavouring- Add a pinch of ground cardamom or saffron for a delicate fragrance and flavour. Garnish with a handful of chopped pistachios or almonds or pistachios for that extra crunch. This is completely optional though!\n\nEast tip to Caramelise Sugar:\n\nCaramelising sugar can be tricky as it can get crystallise making an unmanageable mess.\n\nCover the pan as you caramelise the sugar. The steam will not be able to escape and there by it will create condensation which will avoid the crystallisation of the sugar. Do not stir until the colour changes. Once the colour starts to change, remove the lid and continue cooking until you get the dark caramel colour. Add a 2 tablespoons water, mix well and turn off the heat. Adding water prevents the caramel sauce from burning\n\nEasiest would be to add a squeeze of lemon, but you CANNOT take this step here as it will curdle your milk and the yogurt won’t set.\n\nHow to set Yogurt?\n\nThere are several different ways you can set yogurt.\n\nThe yogurt is traditionally set and fermented in an earthen, terracotta, or clay pot. This helps to absorb excessive moisture, giving Mishti Doi its typical dense but soft and creamy texture. The pot is kept undisturbed in a warm and dry place and at times swathed in cloth to ensure that the yogurt sets properly. In India my Mom would always set yogurt by placing it inside a warm pot. And then she would wrap the pot with few thick fabrics, or hand towels.\n\nYou can also use the Oven method. Place the prepared milk in 180°C preheated oven and bake for 5 minutes. Then, turn off the oven but keep the lights on. The warmth helps to set the yogurt perfectly with thick consistency. Leave it there for 8 hrs. After that, place it in the refrigerator for 2 hours before serving.\n\nYou can use the yogurt mode in Instant Pot of any electric pressure cooker and set yoghurt.\n\nYou can use any yogurt maker to set it.\n\nThe hot and humid temperature in India makes this process of setting yogurt a breeze.\n\nEasy Steps to follow for\n\nBengali Mishti Doi Recipe\n\nPreparing Hung Curd:\n\nPlace a cheese cloth on a colander and add the yogurt on it. Then grab the edges of the cloth and squeeze it gently to drain off the excess water. Keep it aside for at least an hour.\n\nBoiling Milk:\n\nTake a deep sauce pan that can hold the total quantity of the milk. Add milk and bring it to a boil with occasional stirring.\n\nMilk should reduce to almost half the quantity. Add in 1/4 cup sugar to this and mix.\n\nCaramelising Sugar:\n\nTo another pan over medium heat, add 1/2 cup sugar. leave it undisturbed until it melts and changes to orange colour. If you are caramelising sugar for the first time, it can be tricky. So, cover the pan and let it simmer in medium high heat. The steam will not be able to escape and hence it will create condensation which will avoid the crystallisation of the sugar. Keep an eye and lift the lid occasionally to notice the change of colour.\n\nAs soon as the colour changes to mild orange, add 2 tablespoons water & mix well until the colour changes to a slightly dark shade. Turn off the heat.\n\nPreparing Caramel Milk:\n\nAdd this caramelised sugar to the reduced boiling milk and stir until well blended. Simmer for 5 minutes and turn off the heat.\n\nLet the milk cool just until it is lukewarm (but not hot). The milk should just be hot enough so you can dip your finger comfortably.\n\nOnce the milk has cooled down, take the hung yogurt out of the cloth to a bowl and whisk it.\n\nThen pour little bit of the warm milk to the yogurt and whisk until it’s smooth. To this add a little cardamom powder for flavour & whisk again.\n\nMixing & Setting Yoghurt:\n\nIt’s time to add lukewarm milk to the yoghurt mixture. I would recommend straining the milk for a a smooth & creamy doi. but, this is optional.\n\nPour the entire milk to the yogurt mixture and whisk until you see no lump.\n\nPour the mixture to your choice of container. Could be earthenware, ceramic, glass or even steel.\n\nCover with aluminium foil. Place it in a bowl with a kitchen towel & wrap in layers to trap heat.\n\nPlace it in a warm place undisturbed for 8 to 10 hours for the yoghurt to set.\n\nServing Mishti Doi:\n\nIt took me about 10 hours to set as I live in a cold place. Once yoghurt is firm, place it in the refrigerator for about 2 hours to further set and cool down.\n\nEnjoy it plain or garnish with coarsely crushed nuts and extra caramel on top. You can also add a few saffron strands. This is all optional though!\n\nBENGALI MISHTI DOI RECIPE | BENGALI SWEET YOGHURT RECIPE\n\nMishti Doi or Mishti Dahi is an iconic Bengali dessert, a fermented set yogurt sweetened with caramelised sugar or date palm jaggery.\n\nCook Time40 minutes mins\n\nTotal Time40 minutes mins\n\nServings: 6\n\nAuthor: Padma Veeranki\n\nIngredients\n\n1 Litre Full fat Milk\n\n¼ Cup White Granulated sugar Adjust to your taste\n\n1 Cup Thick Yogurt\n\nFor Caramel Sauce:\n\n2 tbsp Water\n\n½ Cup White Granulated Sugar\n\nInstructions\n\nPreparing Hung Yoghurt:\n\nPlace a cheese cloth on a colander and add the yogurt on it.
