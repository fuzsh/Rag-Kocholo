        "text": "Mishti Doi/Bhappa Doi is a popular sweet dish of India (particularly in West Bengal). It’s a beautiful dessert light and fluffy with the goodness of curd and milk best to beat the heat in summers. I was introduced to this beautiful dessert by my mom (I call her amma).She loves mishit doi and all Bengali deserts.She personally never tried making them fearing it won’t turnout good.\n\nI wanted to give mishit doi a try from a long time, so when this time I visited her I got recipe from my Bengali friend and made it for her and she was so happy with the outcome.\n\nSo here’s my recipe for mishit doi/bhappa doi.\n\nIngredients:-\n\n1/2 tin milkmaid.\n\n1 glass evaporated milk (2 glass full cream milk reduced till its 1 glass).\n\n1glass thick curd.\n\n1spoon caramel made from sugar.\n\nDry fruits for garnish.(i have used almonds & cashews)\n\nMethod:-\n\nMishti/Bhapa doi is very easy to make. Combine all ingredients (curd, milkmaid, evaporated milk and caramel) till there are no lumps and place it in double boiler. Cook till its firm and cooked. Let it cool keep in fridge serve chilled. Garnish it with dry fruits\n\nNote: – I didn’t add extra sugar if you want you can.\n\nMy one glass measure exact 150 ml.\n\nApart from milkmaid I didn’t add extra sugar if you wish you could add."
