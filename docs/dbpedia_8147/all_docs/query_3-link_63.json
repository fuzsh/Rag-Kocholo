        "text": "Ridhi Shah's wedding was nothing like she expected.\n\nFor one, the Mumbai resident organised her three-day shaadi all by herself to minimise her contact with family and friends, even decorating her own hands with elaborate mehndi designs to mark the start of the ceremony.\n\nInstead of the groom circling the sacred fire by her side — an important rite of a Hindu marriage ceremony — he was beamed in from Sydney onto Ridhi's computer screen via the video conferencing platform Zoom.\n\nIndian weddings usually also feature pyramids of gold and silver foiled sweets, but not this time.\n\nInstead, guests took photos of their mishti — traditional Indian sweets — and promptly shared the pictures in the wedding WhatsApp group.\n\nThis was an international marriage in 2020, Ridhi explained, and sacrifices had to be made.\n\n\"Borders got closed, all the stuff happened, like lockdown. So, I got stuck,\" Ridhi said.\n\nIn some ways, it was a fitting ceremony for a couple who first met though a phone call.\n\nRidhi and Rishy Gudhka started chatting over a year ago after being introduced by Indian matchmakers, and only met briefly in January when Sydneysider Rishy visited India for a friend's wedding.\n\nRidhi's father gave the couple his blessings soon after, and the marriage was set for May 25, 2020 in Sydney.\n\nThen the global pandemic struck, and the family's plans were thrown into chaos.\n\nBut Hindu custom, which places great importance on certain auspicious dates, called muhurat, when marriages must be performed, meant Ridhi was keen to press ahead with their wedding plans.\n\nSeven months since their virtual wedding, Ridhi and Rishy have not been able to meet in person, but Ridhi said technology, such as video calls, had allowed them to bridge the gap.\n\n\"We don't have that kind of feeling that we are away from each other even though he is doing his work, I'm doing my work,\" Ridhi said.\n\nIndian weddings are a massive affair, with an estimated one-fifth of an average Indian's wealth accumulated over a lifetime going towards their child's marriage, according to a 2016 KPMG report.\n\nThe bride's family traditionally covers the majority of costs for what is sometimes called a \"mini festival\".\n\nThat includes food for hundreds of guests over three days, venue hire, musicians and sometimes accommodation costs for guests from out of town.\n\nThe pandemic has threatened the multi-billion-dollar industry, changing the way young couples like Ridhi and Rishy are meeting, getting engaged and building their lives together.\n\nBut despite the obstacles, a new \"weddings at home\" industry is thriving, with astrologers, matchmakers and matrimonial sites offering virtual services to meet a growing demand.\n\nAnd some say it might influence the way South Asians get married for years to come.\n\nMatchmaking in the time of coronavirus\n\nPreeti Kothari is the Sydney-based matchmaker who brought Rishy and Ridhi together.\n\nMs Kothari said her business, Soulmate Matrimonial, had about 200 clients at its peak, but the pandemic had led to a \"distinct drop\" in her business.\n\nHer clients include single men and women, and parents looking to arrange their child's marriage.\n\n\"We have customers from India as well, so as the flights had closed, no-one was sure when they would be able to get married or meet,\" Ms Kothari said.\n\nMatchmaking can happen informally in South Asian communities, with aunties, grandparents and neighbours trading information in order to find \"alliances\" for their young, single contacts.\n\nOr as is the case with Ms Kothari, it can be a business, where professional matrimonial services pair individuals from around the world, based on their education, cultural backgrounds, and social standing.\n\nMs Kothari said the pandemic narrowed the pool of potential suitors, and pushed her clients to seek alliances within Australia, instead of overseas.\n\n\"They know that overseas alliances are now difficult, so they are seeking alliance within Australia,\" Ms Kothari said.\n\nThat's the case for 30-year-old Sydney student Shefali, another client of Soulmate Matrimonial.\n\n\"I'm just looking in Australia because you can see nowadays, with the pandemic, it's very hard to get the visas,\" said Shefali, who only wants to be known by her first name.\n\nShe said the stress of finding a partner this year had also affected her parents in India, who were also looking for a suitable match for her.\n\n\"They are worried about me. [They want me] to get married with someone over [in Australia],\" Shefali said.\n\n\"But, how? I'm stuck here and the guy, he's not there!\"\n\n'Parents are very much involved'\n\nArranged or planned marriages are still common in many South Asian families, where parents assist their children in finding a spouse.\n\nParents often see it as their duty to find stable and healthy relationships for their children and take great care in selecting families that will complement their own.\n\nTiming can be everything — and with a year lost to the pandemic, parents of older singles may fear that options in the marriage market are drying up.\n\nMatchmaker Ms Kothari said that can be a source of great anxiety for many South Asian families.\n\n\"Parents are very much involved. Sometimes I would say parents even register for the children with us, but the children don't know,\" Ms Kothari said.\n\n\"The lockdown is slowly getting over, [but] still, people are anxious over when [their children] are able to get married, because they can't go to India.\"\n\nFor Shefali, the pandemic has not only interrupted her plans to build a new family in Australia, but also made her realise how much she misses her family in India.\n\nWith borders closed, she is worried she won't see her parents for many months to come.\n\n\"I was crying just [a few] days ago. I want to go home.\"\n\nWeddings from home\n\nWhile many singles in Australia struggled with isolation this year, in India some matrimonial businesses have adapted to deal with the pandemic.\n\nShaadi.com, one of the most popular sites for South Asian parents worldwide to find prospective partners for their children, this year recorded a 30 to 40 per cent increase in registrations compared to the previous year, according to senior marketing director Adhish Zaveri.\n\nMr Zaveri said people had more time on their hands to contemplate marriage and spent more time on their website as a result.\n\nHe said the challenges of living alone during the pandemic made many Indians \"realise the need of having a life partner during such times\".\n\nAdapting to lockdown restrictions, the company introduced new video conference tools to help clients meet and launched a platform called \"Weddings from Home\" to assist with planning a COVID-compliant wedding.\n\nWhile Mr Zaveri believes the pandemic has led many matrimonial businesses like his own to embrace more technology, he doubts the trend will last once coronavirus is brought under control.\n\n\"When the pandemic is behind us, I think people will go back to the traditional ways of getting married,\" he said.\n\n'Two families meeting for a lifetime'\n\nIt's not uncommon for arranged marriages in Australia to involve one partner who live overseas.\n\nIn those cases, the wedding ceremony is not just a celebration, but a legal necessity to help secure a partner visa for Australia.\n\nRidhi had hoped her virtual wedding with Rishy could be registered and approved for her Australian visa, but discovered that wasn't possible.\n\nMelbourne-based migration consultant Bina Shah, who has assisted many young couples with settling in Australia, said there had been major delays in processing immigration visas this year.\n\n\"We have had few approvals over the pandemic time,\" Ms Shah said.\n\n\"With great difficulties, few people have managed to reunite with their families. But there are still a lot of partners who are waiting [for] the decisions on their applications.\"\n\nShe said she had been fielding calls from anxious parents, concerned that their children's relationships were \"on the verge of breakdown\" because couples had been forced to spend time apart during the pandemic.\n\nIndian culture puts great emphasis on not just the couple's relationship, but the relationship between two families, which means a marriage crisis could escalate, Ms Shah said.\n\n\"And they have to maintain the relationship with each other for a lifetime.\"\n\nDespite the struggles, Ms Shah said there might be some winners in the post-pandemic arranged marriage market.\n\nShe said Australia's ability to keep case numbers and unemployment rates relatively low throughout the pandemic compared to other countries, might make it a desirable destination for Indians looking for a partner abroad.\n\n\"I believe everyone in the world is looking at Australia and how they handled the pandemic and how we got places under control,\" Ms Shah said.\n\n\"It will be a very valuable passport to have. You're more marketable or more easily marketable, I would say.\"\n\nBack in India, Ridhi Shah longs to be with her husband in Sydney, and plans to hold another marriage ceremony to register the union.\n\nBut, as far as her family is concerned, the couple are married — even though they have never met each other as husband and wife.\n\n\"Whomever I have told we have done such a Zoom wedding, everyone is like, 'What? How can this happen? How did you do that?',\" Ridhi said.\n\n\"I am very much happy.\"\n\nAsk us your coronavirus questions"
