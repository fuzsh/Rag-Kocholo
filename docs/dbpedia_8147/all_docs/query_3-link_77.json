        "text": "Basanti Pulao is a dish that is synonymous with Bengali cuisine. This signature flavorful dish is a sweet Pulao or Pilaf that is known for its saffron color. The word \"Basanti\" translates to a type of yellow color, which is why this pulao is also known as Holud Pulao. The dish is also commonly referred to as Bengali Mishti Pulao, which translates to \"sweet pulao\" in English.\n\nJump to:\n\nIngredients and Tips to cook perfect Bengali Basanti Pulao\n\nThe family recipe of Basonti Pulao\n\nJagadhatripujo special Bashonti Pulao- My first experience of cooking bhog\n\nBengali Holud Pulao- Its origin and serving suggestion\n\nHere's how I make Basanti Pulao at Debjanir Rannaghar!\n\nRecipe Card\n\nBengali Basanti Pulao Recipe Video\n\nRice Recipes apart from Basanti Pulao from Debjanir Rannaghar\n\nHere's the Bengali Holud Pulao Pin for your pinterest board!\n\nIngredients and Tips to cook perfect Bengali Basanti Pulao\n\nCooking Basanti Pulao is a meticulous and intricate process that requires a perfect balance of fragrant spices and sweet flavors. We prepare this pulao with high-quality Gobindobhog rice and ghee. The addition of ghee in the making of Basanti Pulao provides it with a luxurious and irresistible taste.\n\nTo enhance the complexity of the dish, we incorporate a variety of whole spices, such as cinnamon, cardamom, and bay leaves. These spices impart a unique and delightful flavor to the Bengali Mishti Pulao, which is both aromatic and delectable. The distinct yellow color of basanti pulao comes from the use of saffron or yellow food color, which also adds a floral aroma and flavor.\n\nIn addition to the spices, we include cashew nuts and raisins, which contribute a subtle crunch and sweetness to the Pilaf.\n\nThe family recipe of Basonti Pulao\n\nPassed down from Thakuma to my mother and aunt, this recipe holds a special place in our hearts. Basanti Pulao, also known as Holud Pulao, is not only a family favorite, but an essential dish prepared on the day of Jagadhatri Pujo in our ancestral home in North Calcutta. As I mentioned this renowned Bengali rice delicacy is characterized by its vibrant yellow hue and the use of Gobindobhog Rice.\n\nAt our home, Jagadhatri Pujor Bhog feels incomplete without Basanti Pulao. Thakuma, before her passing, set the menu in stone, and we continue to honor her choices to this day. I simply cannot envision our Pujor bhog without the presence of Basanti Pulao alongside Phulkopir Dalna. My mother takes charge of cooking the bhog, which consists of five plates filled with various Bengali delicacies including Bhoger Khichuri, Aloor Dum, Basanti Pulao, Aloo Phulkopir Dalna, Chanar Dalna, Tomato Amsotto Khejur er Chutney, Payesh, and more. When it comes to the guests, we enlist the help of \"Rannar Thakur,\" our trusted cook, who faithfully follows the same recipe.\n\nJagadhatripujo special Bashonti Pulao- My first experience of cooking bhog\n\nBack in 2002, due to an unexpected emergency, the professional cook (rannar Thakur) had to leave, leaving us without anyone to prepare meals for the approximately 80 guests we were hosting. In a spontaneous turn of events, it was decided that the family members would step in and take charge of the cooking duties. At that time, I was a young college student, full of energy, and eager to take on the challenge. I volunteered to prepare the Pulao and Chanar Dalna dishes. My mother was not very confident in my cooking abilities as I was only 18 then. However. my father provided me with emotional support throughout the process.\n\nWith a great deal of worry, I managed to cook the Pulao and Chanar Dalna for our guests. I still remember my father's unwavering support during that time. It was my first experience cooking in such large quantities. Thankfully, no one complained or asked for seconds, so I hope that the guests enjoyed the food I prepared.\n\nBengali Holud Pulao- Its origin and serving suggestion\n\nBengali Holud Pulao, also known as Basanti Pulao, is a sweet rice dish that is typically cooked with a generous amount of sugar. To balance out the sweetness, it is often served with spicy accompaniments like Mangshor Jhol or Aloor Dum. This dish pairs well with both meat and vegetarian options, making it a versatile choice. Unlike other spicier rice dishes, Basanti Pulao has a subtle flavor that complements the boldness of its side dishes. Its origins can be traced back to the Murshidabadi cuisine, as evident from the use of saffron. It is also reminiscent of the famous Zarda Pulao. Additionally, the names Pallo and Pulaka, derived from Sanskrit, further emphasize the aromatic nature of this rice dish.\n\nHere's how I make Basanti Pulao at Debjanir Rannaghar!\n\nPrint\n\nRecipe Card\n\nBengali Basanti Pulao Recipe Video\n\nRice Recipes apart from Basanti Pulao from Debjanir Rannaghar\n\nAuthentic Awadhi Vegetable Tehri Recipe (also known as veg Tehri)\n\nBhat Bhaja (also known as Bengali Bhaja Bhat)\n\nBangladeshi Mutton Tehari (also known as Gosht Tahiri)\n\nBou Khuda (also known as Boua Pulao or Bou Khudi)\n\nBengali Niramish Khichuri (also known as Bhoger Khichuri aka Bengali Khichuri)\n\nMurgi Khichuri (also known as Murgir Mangshor Khichuri\n\nIlish Pulao (also known as Bengali Hilsa Pulao) Recipe\n\nDhakai Morog Pulao (also known as Sahi Morog Pulao)\n\nKolkata Mutton Biryani (also known as Calcutta Biryani)\n\nBirista Pulao (Also known as Piyaz Beresta Pulao)\n\nMasoor Daler Patla Khichuri (also known as Bengali Red Lentil Khichdi) aar Ilish Mach Bhaja\n\nGhee Bhat (also known as Bengali Sweet Pulao)\n\nKhejur Gurer Payesh (also known as Bengali Rice Kheer with Date Palm Jaggery)\n\nNiramish Bhuni Khichuri (also know as Bengali Bhuni Khichuri)\n\nMuri Ghonto (Also known as Bengali Fish Head and Rice Mishmash)\n\nPish-Pash (Also known as Indian Rice and Chicken Hotchpotch)\n\nChaler Payesh (Also known as Bengali Rice Kheer)\n\nCrab Biryani (Also known as Crab Dum Biryani or Nandu Biryani)\n\nHave you tried the Basanti Pulao Recipe from Debjanir Rannaghar!\n\nDo let me know how it came out.
