        "text": "Thundering beats of the Dhak\n\nAnd blowing of the conch shells\n\nRinging of the cymbals and bells\n\nAnd the fragrance of Dhuno in the air\n\nKumari Puja and Sandhi Puja\n\nEach has a story to tell\n\nAarti and Pushpanjali\n\nAnd the Divine Bhog\n\nAs the frenetic celebration fades away\n\nThat mirth and spirit will always remain\n\nMAA SHAKTI resides within us\n\nDiscover Her once again\n\nBeing away from Bengal since childhood and a Probashi Bengali (non-resident Bengali), I have never felt distanced from Durga Puja traditions.\n\nMy parents had inculcated the Worship of Shakti and the spirit of this festival right from the very beginning.\n\nEvery year, our mid-term school exams would coincide with this 5 day festivity. I still remember how we managed to visit different Puja Pandals in the evening and later at night, study hard for the next day’s exam paper.\n\nMaa Durga’s homecoming has had a very special place in my life, and I had always desired to visit Kolkata – to see the craftsmanship, the gorgeous Pandals, learn more of this tradition and the rituals.\n\nI feel blessed that Maa Durga gave me the opportunity to experience this outpouring of devotion and incessant love.\n\nIt is an incomparable experience of witnessing the glory and grandeur when Maa Durga and Her Children, Lord Ganesha, Maa Saraswati, Maa Lakshmi and Lord Kartikeya come home.\n\nBIDDING FAREWELL TO MAA DURGA\n\nAfter four days of celebrations, as Maha Navami draws to a close every year, there is a sense of finality that brings in sadness and an unexplained emptiness.\n\nMaa Durga’s journey back to her home in Mount Kailash, the abode of Lord Shiva, is also celebrated as a big moment of the festivity.\n\nMaa’s BIDAI (farewell) ceremony is marked with traditions which are centuries old, which have been followed by the womenfolk in Bengal, and anywhere in the world where Durga Puja is celebrated.\n\nMaa Durga, adored as our own, is showered with eternal love and affection just like the Bidai ceremony of our daughter leaving home after marriage. The same unusual mix of emotions prevail – of joy and sorrow, and it remains undefined which is greater.\n\nDASHAMI PUJA AND DARPAN BISARJAN\n\nDARPAN BISARJAN\n\nAfter Dashami morning Aarti and Pushpanjali, when the time arrives to bid adieu, it is difficult to hold back tears when Thakurmoshai’s chants (Head priest) of Dashami Puja fills the air.\n\nBisarjan Puja is performed by the priest in the Puja Kalash (Ghot in Bengali) where the reflection of Maa Durga in the water of Puja Kalash signifies that She is on her way home.\n\nThis is called DARPAN BISARJAN.\n\nThereafter, devotees seek a glimpse of Maa Durga’s reflection in a mirror immersed in an earthern pan filled with water, as part of the Darpan Bisarjan ritual.\n\nDEBI BORON AND SINDOOR KHELA\n\nDEBI BORON RITUAL\n\nDressed in the traditional saris (white with red border), married women offer their prayers and respect to Maa Durga with their Boron Dala.\n\nMaa Durga’s Boron Dala comprises of Mishti (sweets), Sindoor (vermillion), Paan and supari (Betel leaves and nuts), Turmeric, Durva (special type of grass used in Puja) and Dhaan (rice grains).\n\nWomen offer Sindoor on the Forehead and Feet of Maa Durga and pray for the long life of their husband and happiness for all in the family.\n\nSINDOOR KHELA\n\nSINDOOR KHELA\n\nAfter Debi Boron begins Sindoor Khela, where married women apply Sindoor on each other’s forehead followed by Sindoor on their three bangles shankha, pola and loha (three bangles, made of conch shell, coral and iron) as a symbol of good luck, prosperity and happiness in their married life.\n\nSindoor Khela is one of the most joyous and colourful moments towards the end of the festivity, when women playfully celebrate and smear Sindoor on each other’s faces and share the mishti prasad from their Boron dala.\n\nNEELKANTH : MESSENGER TO KAILASH\n\nNEELKANTH BIRD\n\nSovabazar Rajbari followed a special tradition on Dashami with the Neelkanth bird (also named as the Indian Roller bird).\n\nMs. Ajanta De, daughter of Late Kali Prasad Deb, and from the 7th generation of Sovabazar Rajbari family, fondly recalls “ Two Neelkanth birds arrived every Dashami morning. These birds, fairly large in size, were brought from Sundarbans. We had to take special care of these birds as long as they were with us.\n\nAs soon as Maa Durga’s Pratima would leave Rajbari Thakur Dalan, one Neelkanth bird would be flown away from Rajbari. It was believed that the Neelkanth bird would carry the message to Lord Shiva in Kailash that Maa Durga has begun her journey and is on her way to Kailash.\n\nAfter reaching the banks of holy Ganga river, another Neelkanth bird would be flown away, simultaneously alongwith the immersion of Maa Durga’s Pratima (idol).\n\nThis time, the bird would carry the message to Lord Shiva that Maa Durga has reached Kailash.”\n\nThis tradition was initiated by Raja Nabakrishna Deb of Sovabazar Rajbari in 1757 and was followed over many generations. This practise was however discontinued in 2010, after Neelkanth Bird was declared as one of the protected species of birds.\n\nNeelkanth Fanush during immersion\n\nToday, the Chhoto taraf bari (Rajbari of Raja Rajkrishna Deb, Sovabazar) follows this tradition by lighting the Fanush (Flying Sky Lantern) which has a picture of Neelkanth Bird drawn on it.\n\nThis Fanush is released when Maa Durga’s Pratima is immersed in the holy Ganga river.\n\nSHANTI JAL, SANDESH AND SHUBHO BIJOYA\n\nBIJOYA SAMMELANI AT SOVABAZAR RAJBARI\n\nBijoya Dashami celebrations at Sovabazar Rajbari is perhaps the oldest and has remained unique. This tradition has been maintained by nearly 10 generations after Raja Nabakrishna Deb, who had started Durga Puja in 1757 in this Rajbari.\n\nAfter the immersion of Maa Durga’s Pratima, sacred Ganga water from the same spot is taken in a Puja Kalash by Sovabazar Purohit moshai (priest) known as SHANTI JAL. This is placed in the Rajbari Thakur Dalan.\n\nAt 7 pm, unfailingly, all members of the Rajbari family assemble at the Thakur Dalan, men and women in their new attire will be seated opposite each other.\n\nSoon, Purohit moshai joins and chants Peace invocation for three times and sprinkles Shanti Jal – sacred Ganga water from the Kalash on the family gathering. Durga Puja comes to an end with this ritual.\n\nThereafter, family members offer their prayers to their Family Deity, Shri Radha Gobinda which is on the second floor of the Rajbari .\n\nThis Family Deity is over 260 years old, established in 1757 by Raja Nabakrishna Deb.\n\nA special ritual of tying cloth strands made out of Shri Govinda’s Angavastra is considered sacred, which also safeguards the family against any mishap.\n\nFinally, the entire family get together in the central courtyard of the Rajbari, for the much awaited Sandesh and Siddhi.\n\nGreetings of Shubho Bijoya amidst the young and old, with laughter and cheer is how the beautiful celebration of Durga Puja ends at Rajbari, Sovabazar.\n\nOLABIBITOLA SARBAJANIN DURGOTSAB, HOWRAH, WEST BENGAL\n\nStarted way back in 1948, OLABIBITOLA SARBAJANIN DURGOTSAB’s eldest member, Shri Sajol Kumar Banerjee, 96, still actively involved with the Puja, shares the humble beginnings of this Puja.\n\n“With very little inhabitation around this place, few of us got together with our small savings to start this Puja. Post partition, our purpose was to build community feeling through this initiative.”\n\nShri Akhil Bondhu Bhattacharya adds “Some members of this group were part of our freedom struggle. This Puja started with Debi Mukh and Daker Shaaj Pratima. We have maintained this tradition for the last 72 years.”\n\nThis is just one of the many stories of unknown people who have selflessly strived in difficult times to imbibe the spirit of Durga Puja in Bengal and their immense contribution to this celebration will be always remembered.\n\nJAI MAA DURGA\n\nBehind the glory and grandeur of Durga Puja Celebrations, are the Kumbhakars.\n\nRead about the World’s Largest Studio, KUMORTULI."
