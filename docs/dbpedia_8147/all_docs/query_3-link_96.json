        "text": "EVENT: DESI BLOGGERS CONNECT\n\nTHEME: DIWALI DHAMAKA\n\nThe Group Desi Bloggers Connect:\n\nMy contribution for this theme is Coconut Laddoos/ Coconut Fudge Balls. Bloggers Connect is a Facebook Group where members support each other by sharing and commenting on each others post. I’ve met many food bloggers though this group. For this Diwali Festival, the admins decided that we should prepare a sweet and savory or either dish to share for the theme.\n\nMy Story:\n\nWhen I volunteered to take part in this event, I had jotted down a few options. One was a recipe that my mother in law use to make often during Diwali. However, its a bit time consuming and it will have to wait for another time. After I got back from India, wasn’t keeping well because of a very bad viral infection. It has taken a couple of weeks for me to overcome it. I had planned to mark a sweet dish that my Mother in Law use to make often during Diwali. However, due to my illness had to cancel the idea as its a time consuming recipe.\n\nCoconut Laddoos/ Coconut Fudge Balls – my contribution\n\nI was going to inform the admins that I cannot take part. Then I remembered the quick coconut laddoos/ coconut fudge balls recipe that I usually make for Diwali. Every year, I make a huge batch to give out as Diwali gift. I also serve them to people who come home to wish us on that day. As I hate to back out at the last minute when I’ve committed to something, I thought that these coconut beauties would make a perfect contribution to the Diwali celebration.\n\nDiwali Celebration/ Diwali Dhamaka\n\nDiwali is known as the festival of Lights. And it is one of the most important festivals celebrated by Hindus world over. The celebrations include making a variety of food for families and guests. We also carry out various religious ceremonies. Read more about Diwali here.\n\nOur Diwali Celebration\n\nAs hubby and I are getting older, we tend to miss family even more during the festivals and Diwali is no different. I really wish we could be with them. However, that it is not possible. We have a tradition of inviting the few family friends we have over for dinner or lunch. I try and make it as festive as possible.\n\nDiwali Goodies that I always make:\n\nMasala Farsi Puri – spicy fried puri or crackers\n\nMagas – famous Gujarati Sweet made from Chickpea Flour\n\nKansar – Diwali festivities begin with this humble sweet dish\n\nGoogra – another Gujarati speciality. Fried Pastry is filled with nuts and semolina. My all time favorite.\n\nSome years It is tough a choice between Boondi Laddoo and Mohanthal.\n\nI make Gur Na Ladwa in remembrance of my mum.\n\nDate and Nut Cookies to add to the goodie bag I prepare\n\nKiddies too need special treats, so I make Coconut Chocolate\n\nThese Saffron Pistachio Muffins too go in the goodie bag.\n\nCoconut Laddoos/ Coconut Fudge Balls\n\nComing to this easy peasy recipe, its a must for coconut lovers like me, I cannot resist anything that has coconut. Once you have the ingredients at hand, its very easy to make. So lets get right to the recipe. The combination of milk powder, ghee (clarified butter) and milk makes the fudge. You can roll the coconut balls or laddoos in coconut, or finely chopped nuts. Sometimes for a more festive look I roll them in colored sprinkles or chocolate ones.\n\nIngredients required for Coconut Laddoos/Coconut Fudge Balls\n\nDesiccated Coconut – best to use unsweetened. Need extra for coating the balls.\n\nMilk Powder – any variety\n\nMilk – fresh milk\n\nSugar\n\nMelted Ghee or Unsalted Butter – make sure you measure melted ghee or butter\n\nCardamom Powder – best to grind fresh for full flavour\n\nRose Water – optional\n\nDietary Tips:\n\nGluten Free\n\nVegetarian – no eggs, gelatin\n\nPin for Later:\n\nCheck out what fellow Desi Bloggers have made:"
