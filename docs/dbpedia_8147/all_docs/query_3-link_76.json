        "text": "Bengali meals has the only traditionally developed multi course format where food is served in course not all at once.\n\nThrough “JEEMAN” I got the opportunity to share traditional Format of Bengali cuisine. It was total vegetarian and I had cooked all the dishes following the format.\n\nAbout\n\nBengali food is subdivided into four different types of dishes . one Charbya or food that is chewed such as rice and vegetables or fish, chosya or food that is sucked lehya or food that are meant to be licked like chutney and peya which includes drinks mainly milk. Food is served on Metal plates and bowls called “Kansa”, kind of bronze .\n\nBengalis are very particular about the order in which the food should be served. Each dishes are eaten separately with a little rice so that individual flavor of each dishes are enjoyed.\n\nThe first item served specially in winters would be a spoonful of Gawa Ghee ( clarified butter of cow milk) over small portion of steaming hot rice eaten with a pinch of salt and crushed green chili.\n\nThen comes the bitter preparation either bhaja or shukto, a thick soupy mixture of vegetables in a ginger-mustard sauce followed by Shak or green leafy vegetable. Then comes lentils or dals together with roasted or fried vegetables.\n\nNext come the vegetable dishes like chenchki, chochori, paturi followed by curries like dalna, gonto, dolma.\n\nNon veg meals main course definitely consists of Fish preparations, macher jhol, kalia, paturi or doi mach.\n\nIn meats in Hindu families it was always Khashir Mangsho or goat meat. In some communities it would be Duck meat but never chicken. It started during the British Raj.\n\nThen comes Chaatney(chutney) to clear the palate together with Papor which is crisp wafer.\n\nConcluding but most important part of the meal would be Doi (curd) and Mishti (sweet dish).\n\nGet up after the meal, wash your hand and mouth the concluding item would be handing out of beatle leaf which is considered to be an digestive and an astringent aid.\n\nTraditionally like any other region of India, people in Bengal eat seated on the floor together with family members. Male members and children in the families were feeded first and youngest female of the family had the responsibility of serving the meal. People would sit on asan or individual piece of carpet or a lon mats spread on floor.\n\nMeal was served on a Kasar Thala and bati , gelash i.e. metal plate , small bowls and glass. The individual curried dishes were served in bati(bowl) are placed around the Thala format wise running from right to left. Rice is mounded and placed in the middle of thala with a little salt, chilis and lime on the upper orner. The food is eaten with the fingers of the right hand and strict etiquette is observed with reard to this.\n\nDue to this elaborate dinning habit of Bengalis, the housewives paid maximum time and attention to the kitchen.\n\nHowever, in modern times, with growing fast life, courses are frequently skipped or combined with everyday meals. However, minimum three course meals are very common even today. Like lentil with bhaja or a dry vegetable and a curry . In case of veg meals (which is rare) it would be dalna and for non veg it would be fish curry of mutton or chicken curry. Urbanisation has replaced the serving system and everything is placed on table and it is self served. Professional cetering and buffet style dinning is now commonplace.\n\nThe traditions are far more dead, However during family occasions and in ceremonial feasts ,still it is tried that these rituals are observed.\n\nMy Servings:\n\nWelcome Drink\n\nGuests were served with Aam Pora Shorbot in terracotta glass . It was prepared with roasted mango pulp, mishri or rock sugar as sweetner, pink rock salt and Bengali bhaja moshla. Topped with home grown mint leaves.\n\nStarter\n\nI had served my prize winning dish, Mochar Bora stuffed with dry fruits. Its fritters prepared with banana blossoms. Home made Kasundi as the sauce.\n\nThe Meal\n\nTeto/Bitter\n\nSince it is hot summer time I skipped the Ghee. And started with Teto i.e. bitter, crispy Karela fry.\n\nLau Shak paturi\n\nI had used bottle gourde leaves (Lau Shaak) cooked alongwith with begun (brinjal), Jhinga ( ridge guard), Kumro (pumpkin). The shak steamed or cooked in oil with other vegetables and fresh coconut , mustard and poppy paste.accompanied by a pungent paste of fermented mustard seeds, spices\n\nGondhoraj Lebu pata diye Musoor Dal\n\nRed lentil cooked in oil and tampering of whole dry red chili and Nigella seeds. Cooked with aromatic Bengals Gondhoraj lemon leaves. Topped with slices of lemon.\n\nBhaja\n\nDal is always accompanied with a bhaja or a crispy fries. Alu bhaja, Beguni, Bhidi, or Potol, any of seasonal vegetable. I had prepared Potol Bhaja and it was cut in flower shape and named it phul potol bhaja.\n\nMain course\n\nDalna\n\nSince it was a vegetarian meal, I had prepared Dhokal Dalna which is a steamed lentil cake, deep fried and then curried with ghee, cumin powder, Bengali garam masala.\n\nNon Veg\n\nBengali meal are always associated with fish curry which is very important part of the meal. There are countless types of curry and varies from every part of Bengal. Most common are, Macher Jhol or the regular curry . Others are Macher Kalia, Mach Paturi, Doi Mach, Tel Jhol, Macher Jhal, Macher Tok, Mach Bhape, shorshe Bata etc etc etc.\n\nMeat was initially once a week affair but now a days it is common on any day of the week. Special feature of Meat preparation is with big chunky potatoes in the curry.\n\nChaatney\n\nAfter the rich course of dalna or Non Vegg, the meal moves to sweeter part with sweet and tangy Chutney. It is prepared with seasonal availability. Most common is tomato, Raw green mango, Pineapple, Green raw papaya or seasonal fruit chutney. This is served with Papad. Since it is green mago time , I had prepared Mango chutney.\n\nDoi Mishti\n\nThe last and most important part of the meal is Sweet Curd and Mishti. Bengalis have sweet tooth and no meal is complete without mishti. If nothing is available then be it with spoonful of sugar or gud with milk. Sometimes a spoonful of cooked rice is mixed with milk and sugar to finish the meal on sweet note.\n\nI had prepare Mishti Doi or sweet curd and Narkol Khoya Shondesh which was very much appreciated.\n\nThe meal was concluded with Paan Supari.\n\nIt was an awesome experience and have planned regular food pop up of traditional Bengali Cuisine."
