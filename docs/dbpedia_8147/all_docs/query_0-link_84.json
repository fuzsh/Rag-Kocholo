        "text": "London\n\nMishti is 7 months pregnant, she is not the same Mishti anymore, she is not the angry confident chorni anymore. Mishti has lost her confidence, she is always in some kind of fear now, even though in last few months things have gotten little better the sexual abuses have lessened. Since she got pregnant Nishant's behavior towards her have changed little bit, may be because now he feels less insecure or he feels now that she is pregnant and carrying his child he felt he owned Mishti now.\n\nEverytime BM asked her why she doesn't come to India Mishti avoided saying Nannu will be so lonely, he doesn't want to miss even a min of this pregnancy. Somehow BM was never very happy with everything, she always felt some kind of fear some kind of emptiness in Mishti, she was not the same old Mishti.\n\nNow that she is pregnant Nishant wanted her to do everything according to him, he didn't care how she was feeling, she had to eat sleep and do everything according to his wish as he felt his ways will keep Mishti and the baby healthy. He had cameras fixed in the house everywhere even the bathroom, Mishti was watched by him 24/7.\n\nThere are times Mishti tried running away but to her bad luck Nishant would always find her and punish her, she was even punished for getting lost in the shopping mall as she was looking at some dresses and didn't realize Nishant left the store, when he found her he dragged her to the car in the mall's parking lot and forced her to pleasure him for not keeping up with him. The last time she tried running away was when she got pregnant she was only 3 months pregnant and Nishant caught her, he locked her in the room for three days, raped her day and night it was so bad that at one point Mishti just became numb that every time he came to the room she would just go to the bed and close her eyes as if she was dead but Nishant knew this won't stop Mishti so he played the master stroke and showed Mishti a medicine and told her next time she does something stupid he will mix this medicine in her food and she will loose the baby and not only that he will tell the family that Mishti purposely aborted the baby as she doesn't want kids so early.\n\nShe wasn't scared of being blamed for anything anymore but there was no way she could hurt her baby. She wasn't going to let Nishant harm her child, so she gave up on ever running away or doing anything like that, all she wanted was her child to be healthy and happy. Mishti was trying hard to keep Nishant happy so that he doesn't torture her anymore and slowly Nishant's torture became less.\n\nIndia\n\nPooja enjoyed her 2 weeks stay in India, she was really impressed with Abir's NGO his work his paintings but somehow she never heard any poems from Abir even though everyone always said Abir is very poetic and writers beautiful poems but she could never make his recite his poems. She really got comfortable with the family and everyone else... Pooja felt comfortable being with Abir, she got along with Kunal too she felt she found a younger brother in Kunal as she didn't have anyone younger than her.\n\nTwo weeks flew by and it was time for Pooja to leave but when she was coming back to London she felt she was leaving something behind and after coming back she couldn't stop talking about her time in India and everyone. Now Pooja was no more an investor only she has become family... Abir was very happy to meet Pooja, after a long time he felt he could talk to someone, even though Pooja didn't know the whole story but she understood little bit of Abir's story and knew he was in a state where he just needed a friend or someone he could talk to and she was happy to be that friend. For a change this time Abir didn't know much about Pooja or her personal life, Abir was more of a talker now and Pooja the listener. The family was surprised to see Abir like that with Pooja because they always saw Abir observing or listening to everyone and not opening about himself but with Pooja things were very different somehow Abir was very carefree when it came to showing his emotions or saying anything but he wasn't very observant about her, neither he asked Pooja much about her life or anything. There was a point when Kunal even said to Pooja that he has never seen Bhai talking so freely about him or his likes and dislikes to anyone not even to Mishti because he always wanted to know what Mishti likes and disliked where as he doesn't ask Pooja about her likes and dislikes. Abir didn't even know that Pooja was engagement broke once 2 years back as she found out He was marrying her because of money, she didn't love him but still heart broken as they were engaged and was developing feelings for him, so kinda knows the feeling of dejection and also rejection. Pooja didn't mind listening to Abir she could really feel Abir's pain may be for a change there was someone who understood Abir more than Abir himself may be for a change it was time for Abir to be understood than him understanding someone.\n\nFew weeks passed and in London Mishti has given birth to a baby boy....\n\nNamish Maheshwari\n\n15 December 2021\n\nFor the first time Mishti was really happy after one whole year, she was also happy that Nannu chose a nice name for the baby which meant Lord Vishnu. This new was given to everyone back home BP BM couldn't believe they have become great grand parents ofcourse from Nishant's side. They were all ecstatic and sent sweets to every one all friends and family. But ofcourse as Rajvansh family was KuHu's in laws they decided to come and give the sweets as they came and gave the good news everyone congratulated them without and bad feelings or anything Rajvansh famiky was genuinely happy for Mishti. Abir who was not at home and just came in, he was happy to see everyone that too seeing sweets in front of him made him happier as he loved sweets. Abir asked why so much of sweets were here? Everyone kinda hesitated but Jasmeet chachi with a sarcastic tone said she became Dadi Mishti gave birth to her son's heir. She just had a baby boy.\n\nAbir almost choked on his own saliva but there was no way he was going to show it to anyone. Abir congratulated everyone he even fed Jasmeet Chachi a big piece of sweet and said now U've become Katrina Dadi from Katrina Chachi and everyone laughed. Abir made an excuse that he needs to take a shower as he was doing a lot of field work and excused himself. He came to the room locked his door and cursed himself, somehow it still hurt a lot that Mishti left him, he felt only if Mishti didn't choose Nishant then today he would be enjoying this day.. suddenly there was a video call and it was Pooja\n\nAbir:: hey Pooja how are u? What's up?\n\nP:: hi!!!! Abir are you ok?\n\nA:: Yea I'm fine why? Why do you ask?\n\nP:: because I see tears rolling down ur cheeks... are u ok?\n\nA:: umm iii... I mean...\n\nP:: is Mishti Ok?\n\n(Abir just looked at pooja and couldn't believe that she could read his mind, she knew it has something to do with Mishti, he didn't want to hide and not only that he only had Pooja who actually understood him without even saying anything.)\n\nA:: Mishti just gave birth to a boy\n\nP:: oh!! Abir ??!! It's ok to cry, just the way it's normal to laugh when u r happy it's normal to cry when u r hurting\n\n(Abir couldn't believe she said exactly the same thing what he told Mishti, it feels like Pooja is the Abir in Abir's life)"
