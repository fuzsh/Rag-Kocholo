        "text": "Mishti Kumro Bhorta refers to mashed pumpkin curry, made the Bengali way. This is an utterly flavourful dish, full of robust tastes, and makes for an excellent side to rotis. It can also be had mixed with plain rice which, I understand, is the way Bengalis typically like eating it. My family and I love having this bhorta with rice and a simple dal tadka.\n\nI used to have a cook from Odisha earlier, a guy who was well-versed with Bengali cooking. He would cook us a bit of Bengali food every now and then, and this Mishti Kumro Bhorta was one of the things he introduced us to. As an aside, I love how the Bengalis make bhorta (mash) using every conceivable vegetable, much as we South Indians make chutneys!\n\nI loved the Mishti Kumro Bhorta to bits the first time I had it, and our cook was sweet enough to roughly outline the recipe for me. Let me share with you all today how to put together this beautiful, flavoursome dish – it is quite an easy thing to make.\n\nWhat Goes Into Mishti Kumro Bharta\n\n‘Mishti Kumro Bharta‘ (Bengali) literally translates to ‘sweet pumpkin mash’. It is traditionally made using the sweetish red pumpkin, in place of which I have used butternut squash. I find butternut squash to be much more sweeter, flavourful and easier to cook than the regular Indian red pumpkin, and use it in several Indian dishes. Do check out this post where I have made South Indian style Parangikkai Poriyal with butternut squash – I have also described in this post, in detail, how to cut and use a butternut squash. I have also used butternut squash with great success in Avial, Mathan Erissery, Pumpkin Halwa and Parangikkai Rasavangi.\n\nApart from the squash, onion and a generous amount of garlic goes into the bhorta too. The usual suspects like salt and turmeric powder go in too, along with a little bit of sugar and red chilli powder. A dash of lemon juice is also used to flavour the dish.\n\nA few spoons of mustard oil go into this Mishti Kumro Bhorta too, which is what gives the dish an authentic Bengali flavour.\n\nOnce done, the bhorta is garnished with a generous amount of finely chopped coriander.\n\nHow To Make Mishti Kumro Bhorta\n\nIngredients (serves 4-6):\n\nA medium-sized butternut squash, 3 cups when peeled and chopped\n\nAbout 4 tablespoons of mustard oil\n\n1 medium-sized onion\n\n6-7 cloves of garlic\n\nSalt to taste\n\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric powder\n\nRed chilli powder to taste\n\n1/2 tablespoon sugar or to taste\n\n1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander\n\nA generous dash of lemon juice\n\nMethod:\n\n1. Remove the top of the butternut squash and cut it in half. Remove the peel, the strings and seeds. Do not discard the strings and seeds – they can be used in a chutney later (will share the recipe for the same some other time).\n\n2. Chop up the peeled and de-seeded butternut squash into cubes. Keep ready.\n\n3. Heat 1 tablespoon of mustard oil in a pan. Add in the butternut squash, along with the turmeric powder and a little salt. Add a splash of water, and turn the flame down to medium. Cook covered on medium flame till the squash is cooked through. This should take 7-8 minutes. You will need to uncover the pan intermittently, and splash some more water if the pan has got very dry. It is okay if the squash gets some charred, brown bits while cooking – this greatly adds to the flavour of the bhorta.\n\n4. While the squash is cooking, peel the garlic cloves. Smash them roughly, using a mortar and pestle. Keep ready.\n\n5. Peel the onion and chop finely. Keep ready.\n\n6. When the squash is cooked, transfer it to a plate.\n\n7. Heat about 3/4 tablespoon mustard oil in the same pan. Add in the smashed garlic cloves. Saute on medium heat for about a minute, then add in the chopped onions. Saute for 2-3 minutes on medium heat or till the onions start browning.\n\n8. At this stage, turn the flame down to low, and add the cooked squash cubes back into the pan.\n\n9. Add salt to taste, red chilli powder and sugar.\n\n10. Cook on low flame for about 2 minutes, mixing the ingredients together and mashing them up with the back of the ladle. Switch off gas when done.\n\n11. Add in the finely chopped coriander and lemon juice. Mix well.\n\n12. Add about a tablespoon of mustard oil, raw. Mix well. Your Mishti Kumro Bharta is ready. Serve it warm with rotis or rice. We like having it with rice and simple dal tadka.\n\nVegan And Gluten-Free\n\nThis recipe for Mishti Kumro Bhorta is entirely vegetarian and vegan. It is suitable for people following a plant-based diet.\n\nThis is a completely gluten-free recipe as well.\n\nTips & Tricks\n\nMake sure the butternut squash is well cooked. You should be easily able to mash a cube of the cooked vegetable between your fingers.\n\nMustard oil is a must in this recipe. It is what gives this bhorta an authentic Bengali touch. For best results, use kacchi ghani mustard oil. However, if you don’t like the pungency of mustard oil or do not have it, you can use any other oil instead.\n\nA tempering of panch phoron (a mix of the five spices – cumin, mustard, fennel, nigella seeds and fenugreek – that is quite common in Bengali dishes) can be used in the bhorta too. I usually don’t, and neither do I use asafoetida to temper this bhorta.\n\nThe onions do not have to be completely cooked. You can cook them till slightly done and crunchy and add them to the bhorta. Alternatively, you can add in the onions raw as well.\n\nJaggery powder can be used in place of the sugar that I have used here. However, that might alter the colour of the final dish. Adjust the quantity as per personal taste preferences. You may also skip the sugar/jaggery if you feel the natural sweetness of the butternut squash is enough.\n\nYou may use dry red chillies or green chillies in place of the red chilli powder I have used here. Adjust the quantity as per personal taste preferences.\n\nThe lemon juice is optional. You can avoid it if you don’t prefer it. However, personally, I would highly recommend adding a dash of lemon juice. It adds a beautiful flavour to the bhorta.\n\nI have used a butternut squash here, which I bought at Namdhari’s Fresh (not sponsored). In case you cannot find butternut squash, you can use the regular Indian red pumpkin (which is what is traditionally used in this bhorta) . Butternut squash tastes sweeter and much more flavourful than red pumpkin, though.\n\nAs mentioned above, do not discard the fibre and seeds from the butternut squash. They can be used to make a chutney."
