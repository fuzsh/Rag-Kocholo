        "text": "Families are made in the heart. The only time family becomes null is when those ties in the heart are cut. If you cut those ties, those people are not your family. If you make those ties, those people are your family. And if you hate those ties, those people will still be your family because whatever you hate will always be with you.\"\n\n― C. JoyBell C.\n\nThe social fabric of South Asian society is based on the concept of families. No matter what a family is an important part of a person's life something we cannot choose but have to co-exist with. Both Abir and Mishti did not have a quintessential Indian family. Abir's father had abandoned his mother when Abir was 5 years old. The story was even more bleak for Mishti. While her dad was implicated for attempted murder her mother remarried leaving her behind with her grand mother. Unable to bear the responsibility of raising a young child her grand ma give her responsibility to her late daughter in law's parents who were more than willing to take Mishti in as this would help them fill the void that had been left after their daughter's death. Vishambar Maheswari and Rajshri Maheswari were in the literal sense Mishti's miracles. Two people who taught her the meaning of unconditional love but not every family is perfect and there were a few members of the Maheswari clan who despised her.\n\n\"Mishkin not fair yaar you promised you will stay over on campus to help me with our operations management project.\" Abir huffed in annoyance\n\n\"Bir I have to go my aunt and cousin are coming home today\" Mishti explained\n\n\"You mean that annoying Nunnu\"\n\n\"Omg Abir not Nunnu its Nannu\" Mishti chided him\n\n\"Its still a weird name you know\" personally Abir had never liked Mishti's cousin he had only met Nishant once when he picked Mishti up from college and he been very rude with Abir.\n\n\"His actual name is Nishant he is annoying but he is family so I have to go\" Mishti explained\n\n\"Okay fine\"\n\nPresent Day\n\nAbir was reminiscing the last time Mishti had mentioned Nishant Maheswari's name back in 3rd year of college. It had been 4 days since she had revealed in the hospital that the person behind the shooting could be Nishant. Despite his protests Mishti left the hospital that day. Owing to his injuries, they had to cancel the site visit to the school location. Ever since that day in the hospital room Mishti had not contacted Abir. She hadn't even dropped a small text accruing about his health. Abir looked at the date it had been four days but it seemed like she did not care enough to check up on him. His mind was buzzing with these thoughts when his phone beeped indiacting that he had received a message. It was from Mishti.\n\n\"Oh so finally she remembered to talk to me\" Abir thought and opened the text. To his disappointment it only said that she needed to meet him urgently to discuss something important. Although Abir had been hurt by her lack of concern for him he couldn't seem to to bury the nagging feeling that Mishti was facing a huge problem. Perhaps she didn't want to worry him. He quickly texted her that she could come to his place if she was comfortable and to his surprise Mishti agreed and replied pretty quickly. Something was definitely wrong with her. Abir asked Meeta to make tea just the way Mishti liked it. Half an later the door bell rang and Abir hurriedly opened the door to greet her.\n\nIt had been 4 days since she had let her guard down in front of him and revealed Nishant's name. Ever since than she had not talked to him because she was afraid that she might reveal even more information that would endanger his life. Heck he got shot because of her. When she had realized back in college Mishti Aggarwal had vowed to protect Abir Rajvansh even if she had to fight the whole world to guarantee his safety she would. Even she had to fight her own heart she would. Even if she had to make Abir hate her she would because she rather live far away from him in a world where he existed a world without Abir Rajvansh was out of question for her. Before texting Abir she had mentally prepared herself to opt out of the school project maybe she had to find another way to fulfill her dream. However, when he opened the door to of his apartment she wasn't prepared for the onslaught of emotions she felt well looking at his place.\n\nThe Windows.\n\n\"Abir, you know I want to live in a place with a lot of windows. I want to feel the sun on my face when I get up in the morning. I know it's silly but don't you think when sunlight illuminates things everything looks golden and even more pretty\"\n\nMishti remembered how she had once told him that her dream house would have a lot of windows. She looked at the hues of blue and pink that Abir had used to decorate his house.\n\n\"Mera favorite color blue hain Bir so please lets use blue paint\" She had told him\n\n\"Really par mera toh pink chalo dono colors kartay hain\" Abir had replied.\n\nAbir had to call her name thrice to jolt her out of her memories.\n\n\"Mish..Mishti are you planning to stand outside the whole day? Andar ahao na please tum.. \" Abir stopped himself right in the nick of time. Truth to be told he had always imagined Mishti's homecoming to a bit different but sometimes things happen differently than we have envisioned. As much as Mishti had been affected by his choice of an apartment and the décor Abir was equally affected by her presence in a place he wished he could live with her and call his house a home. For a minute or two both of them were unable to say anything as there internal thought process had dismantled there ability to have a conversation but than both of the spoke up at the same time.\n\n\"Mishti..\n\n\"Abir\" she said\n\n\"Okay you first since you were the one who wanted to meet up so urgently \"Abir encouraged her to speak up\n\n\"Abir I umm I have done a lot of thinking and I have decided to withdraw from the project and go back to London. I am really sorry I know its going to be hard for you to find another partner so soon but I just can't I have to leave\" she said and got up.\n\nAbir held her hand from the back and stopped her.\n\n\"10 years ago Mishti you left without saying anything you could have done the same thing this time too. Tumhari adadat hain cheezon ko adhoora chodnay ki\" He lamented\n\n\"Abir just let me go please\" Mishti said\n\n\"I am not going to force you to stay but at least tell me what's wrong why are you abandoning this project something I know you really wanted to pursue. How is Nishant involved in all this mess please Mishti just this time don't leave without an explanation\" He pleaded with her\n\n\"Abir I can't I have already put you in a lot of danger. The truth will endanger your life and I have already lost a lot of loved ones\" she explained\n\n\"Mishti do you think you are the only one who has lost the people they have loved. You left me a decade ago and just a month later I had to bury my baby brother so don't tell me how it feels to lose people because I think I have a fair idea\" Abir said with tears in his eyes\n\n\"I am sorry about Kunal, Abir I really am\" Mishti said\n\n\"If you are sorry than you should help me complete this project this was Kunal's last wish I have already told you that. For me this isn't business Mishti its personal and I know that this project means something to you too. Don't give some random person the power to shatter your dreams\" Abir advised her.\n\n\"See that's the problem Abir its not just any random person its Nishant I know first hand what he is capable of and I am not willing to take a risk. I am sorry\" she said and turned to leave.\n\n\"MishKin..\" she stopped when he uttered her nickname.\n\n\"Do you remember this wallet?\" he showed her battered old brown wallet the one that had almost been stolen when they had met for the first time.\n\n\"You have still kept it Bir it has been 14 years\" she said with tears in her eyes\n\n\"Yeah people often ask me why I have kept such an old wallet even when I can afford a designer one but this wallet is my most prized possession. See its not about Kunal, losing people or our love or our friendship that day you decided to help a stranger even though you I never asked for your help so now let me help you. Let someone in MishKin no matter how strong we are we all need help sometimes don't fight this battle alone please. Aur remember like I said agar life main 1% chance bhi ho humay who chance laina chaiyay. Help maang kar toh dekho try nahi karo gi toh pata kaisa chala ga\" Abir said.\n\n\"You have no idea what mess you are getting into Bir\" Mishti said cryptically as she decided to tell him the truth."
