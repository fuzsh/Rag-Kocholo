        "text": "About Mishti Chocolates\n\nIn 2015, Chocolatier Arpita Kohli began a journey that led to a flourishing business built around chocolate. When her daughter, Mishti, was diagnosed with a dairy allergy, Arpita transformed her household into a vegan and allergy-friendly zone. Not content to assign her family to uninspired foods devoid of pleasure and nutritious value, Arpita rethought traditional foods, specifically chocolate.\n\nMishti Chocolates was born from Arpita’s desire to reimagine vegan and allergy-friendly to mean better tasting and better for you. Today, a wide variety of flavorful chocolates are enjoyed by an active community of health-conscious patrons and flavor-seeking aficionados.\n\nGuided by principles of simplicity and creativity, Team Mishti is devoted to making chocolate with phenomenal flavors and real ingredients, without the oils, extracts and allergens that pervade most chocolate products on the market. Taste a morsel of Mishti Chocolate for a pure, unforgettable experience."
