Not to be confused with Aaron Ramsey (born 2003).

Aaron James Ramsey (born 26 December 1990) is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Cardiff City]] and the Wales national team. Ramsey mainly plays as a box-to-box midfielder, but has also been deployed on the left and right wings.

Ramsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a £5 million deal, where he quickly gained first team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against Stoke City in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the 2011–12 season. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the 2013–14 season campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Hull City.

Ramsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their UEFA Euro 2016 campaign, where he helped his country to the semi-finals and was included in the Team of the Tournament and also helped Wales to the last 16 of UEFA Euro 2020. Ramsey then helped Wales qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 2022 for the first time since 1958, describing it as a "dream come true".
