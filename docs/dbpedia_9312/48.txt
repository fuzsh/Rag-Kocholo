Aaron Ramsey, Wales' national football team captain, has returned to his boyhood club, Cardiff City.

The club confirmed on their official website that the 32-year-old midfielder has signed a two-year contract, marking his third stint with the Bluebirds.

Ramsey’s career in football began at Cardiff City, where he became the youngest player to debut for the first team in April 2007, at just 16 years and 123 days. This record still stands.

Ramsey first left Cardiff for Arsenal in 2008, after which he had a brief loan spell at Cardiff in February 2011.

Over the span of his career, Ramsey has accrued more than 500 appearances, competing at the highest levels of world football. This includes impressive stints at Arsenal and Juventus.

Ramsey was a three-time Emirates FA Cup winner during his time with Arsenal, scoring decisive goals in the finals against Hull City in 2014 and Chelsea in 2017.

In Italy with Juventus, he became a Serie A champion in the 2019/20 season and a Coppa Italia winner in 2021. Ramsey also has two UEFA Europa League runner-up medals to his name.

Internationally, Ramsey has earned 83 caps for the Wales national team, scoring 20 goals. He played a critical role in Wales' journey to the semi-finals of the UEFA EURO 2016 and their qualification for UEFA EURO 2020.

Upon signing his new contract, Ramsey expressed his joy at returning home. "It feels unbelievable to finally be back here," Ramsey said. "I always thought one day I’d come back, and now it’s the perfect time to do that."

The club's management was equally thrilled about the homecoming. Erol Bulut, the team's coach, thanked the club’s top brass for making this possible and emphasized that Ramsey’s successful career and experience would be invaluable to the club.

"Aaron started here, and now he is back to help us to achieve our targets," Bulut said.
