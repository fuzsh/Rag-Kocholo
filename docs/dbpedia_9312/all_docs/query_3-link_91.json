        "text": "Former Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey is considering his future in international football after Wales failed to qualify for Euro 2024. Despite being a key player, Ramsey didn't play in the play-off defeat against Poland on Tuesday.\n\nThe Cardiff-born midfielder, who made over 200 appearances for the Gunners before leaving in 2019, has had an injury-plagued season and hasn't started a game for six months due to knee and calf problems. He will turn 34 at the end of this year and with 84 caps and 21 goals, he's one of Wales' most successful players.\n\nHowever, with the World Cup qualifiers starting in a year, Ramsey is thinking about whether to continue playing for Wales. Wales manager Rob Page said they hadn't discussed Ramsey's future yet, but praised his contribution both on and off the pitch.\n\nThe start of qualifying for the 2026 World Cup is 12 months away, and the PA news agency reports that Ramsey will contemplate his international future after Wales' painful Euro exit.\n\n\"There have been no conversations like that,\" Wales manager Rob Page said about Ramsey's future straight after defeat to Poland. \"It's been, what, an hour since we've ended the game.\n\n\"Aaron was a big part of this squad as well. It's not just what he brings on the pitch, it's off the pitch as well.\n\nREAD MORE: What Manchester City XI vs Arsenal could be as John Stones joins four other doubtful stars\n\nREAD MORE: Mikel Arteta has turned potential weakness into Arsenal's biggest Premier League title strength\n\n\"We want to continue to add to the squad and at the right time we'll start introducing the younger ones in.\""
