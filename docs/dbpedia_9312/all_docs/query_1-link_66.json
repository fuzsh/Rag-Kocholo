        "text": "Wales manager Rob Page has stated Aaron Ramsey has a lot to offer, as Wales prepare for their Euro 2024 playoff matches.\n\nRamsey’s name has certainly raised a number of eyebrows in the Red Wall, particularly as the captain hasn’t played a full game for Cardiff City since the last South Wales derby in mid-September.\n\nDespite his injury hit season, Page says Ramsey is still a huge player, and even if he can only play a handful of minutes, it’s a chance he’s willing to take.\n\n“It’s not been ideal for him; he’s had a few setbacks. If there’s a chance of having him in the squad I’m going to take it; irrespective of what happens on the grass.\n\n“He’s on the grass this week and his rehab back to full fitness has gone to plan. The last two camps we’ve had him in and around the camp even though he’s not been able to play, so to have some of his stature be involved in the camp is beneficial for us.\n\n“We’ll get him on camp, and we’ll assess. We’ve already had conversations with him. Our medical team are based in Hensol where Cardiff train. We see him, we have eyes on him every day.\n\n“That’s the luxury we’ve had of being in the same vicinity. If it’s a bit part of the game then great, we’ll use him for that. He’s still got a lot to offer.”\n\nColwill’s return\n\nRamsey’s City teammate, Rubin Colwill, is a name that returns to the senior squad for the upcoming games against Finland and either Estonia or Poland.\n\nColwill has spent a lot of time this season in Wales’ U21 squad, where he’s helped them on their European Championship push.\n\nPage is happy with the work Colwill has done with Matty Jones and is eager to see the midfielder forward back in the camp.\n\n“When I was U21s manager, we had a similar situation with Harry Wilson. Ryan Giggs sent him back down with me for a couple games and he was outstanding. He led by example, played a big part in the results that we had, and his attitude was brilliant, especially for the younger players to see.\n\n“When you’re identified as a potential talent who’s going to play for Wales, when you work with the U21s, you’re still in the system. That was the message to Rubin, to Luke Harris, and to every U21 player who comes up.\n\n“Going down isn’t a negative. You’re still playing international football and getting the cap accumulation, then at the right time, we’ll introduce you to the first team.\n\n“Rubin has done well at Cardiff, he’s earned the right to be back in the senior team, and we’ll see what he’s like in camp.”\n\nGoalkeeper conundrum\n\nAs far as the squad is concerned, almost all of the players selected are playing regular minutes for their clubs and are thriving.\n\nThe four players at Leeds United, the trio at Ipswich Town, and the likes of Brennan Johnson, Harry Wilson, and David Brooks have been integral to their clubs’ form over the last few weeks, and it’s giving Page a real selection headache.\n\nHowever, one area of the pitch that’s a problem is in the goalkeeping department.\n\nNone of the four keepers called up by Page have been getting minutes and will come into these two games lacking match sharpness.\n\nThe scenario for the manager isn’t ideal. But despite that, he’s choosing to look at the positives.\n\n“It is disappointing that the goalkeepers aren’t playing, but all we can do is try. We’ve asked players to go and play minutes, and I get it, as a player it’s not easy to leave a football club when you’ve got a considerable enough time left on your contract, so it’s not that straight forward unfortunately. I can’t control that now.\n\n“We’ve had this situation in the past and we’ve done ok. It’s not ideal, but I’ve got to focus on the positives; and those positives are all the other ten outfield players, for the first time, are getting the minutes we want them to.\n\n“We’re in a far healthier position now then what we have been.”\n\nRhian Wilkinson support\n\nIn the past, Rob Page has spoken of his strong working relationship with former Wales manager Gemma Grainger.\n\nNow, Grainger has moved on to Norway, and Rhian Wilkinson has been hired as her successor.\n\nPage revealed he messaged Wilkinson immediately when he received the news of her hiring, and he’s looking to continue the one nation sentiment that has been growing over the last few years.\n\n“I was as surprised as anybody when Gemma left, but that’s football, that’s life, and we move on.\n\n“When Rhian was appointed, I messaged her straight away saying she’s got our support in every capacity, and that we’ll help in any way we can. That’s the relationship we had with Gemma, and we want that to continue.\n\n“We’re one team, and we’re there to support her.”\n\nWALES TEAM TO PLAY AND FINLAND AND ESTONIA/POLAND\n\nWayne Hennessey (Nottingham Forest), Danny Ward (Leicester City), Tom King (Wolverhampton Wanderers), Adam Davies (Sheffield United)\n\nBen Davies (Tottenham), Joe Rodon (Leeds United), Joe Low (Wycombe Wanderers), Chris Mepham (Bournemouth), Ben Cabango (Swansea City), Neco Williams (Nottingham Forest), Jay DaSilva (Coventry City), Connor Roberts (Leeds United)\n\nWes Burns (Ipswich Town), Ethan Ampadu (Leeds United), Josh Sheehan (Bolton Wanderers), Dylan Levitt (Hibernian), Jordan James (Birmingham City), Charlie Savage (Reading), Harry Wilson (Fulham), Nathan Broadhead (Ipswich Town), Aaron Ramsey (Cardiff City)\n\nRabbi Matondo (Rangers), David Brooks (Southampton), Dan James (Leeds United), Liam Cullen (Swansea City), Rubin Colwill (Cardiff City), Brennan Johnson (Tottenham), Kieffer Moore (Ipswich Town)"
