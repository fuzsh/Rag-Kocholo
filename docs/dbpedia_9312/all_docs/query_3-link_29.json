        "text": "Captain Aaron Ramsey is a surprise inclusion for Wales' Euro 2024 play-offs despite recent injury issues.\n\nRamsey, 33, has been limited to only two appearances for club side Cardiff City - totalling 72 minutes - since a knee injury in September.\n\nA calf strain meant he was expected to miss the play-offs, but he has made a quicker than expected recovery.\n\nWales boss Rob Page has named a 28-man squad for Wales' semi-final with Finland and possible play-off final.\n\nWales face Finland at Cardiff City Stadium on Thursday, 21 March with a potential final against Poland or Estonia to follow five days later, also in Cardiff, for a place in this summer's European Championship.\n\nThe return of Ramsey - who missed the last group qualifiers in October and November - is a major boost for Wales after Cardiff boss Erol Bulut initially ruled him out of the play-offs.\n\n\"It's not been ideal for Aaron, he's had a few setbacks but if there was a chance of having him in the squad I was going to take it,\" Page said.\n\n\"He's back on the grass and his rehab has gone to plan. To have someone of his stature involved is beneficial for us.\n\n\"When you have someone of his quality, if there is a chance to get him in I'll take it.\"\n\nPage says Wales have been monitoring Ramsey's fitness at the training base they share with Cardiff City and are keen to assess how involved he can be in the play-offs.\n\n\"We have eyes on him every day,\" he said.\n\n\"If it's a bit-part of the game we can use him for, we will take it.\n\n\"If he has the potential to give us some minutes off the bench we will use him.\n\n\"Aaron knows his body and knows exactly what he needs to do to get himself fit.\""
