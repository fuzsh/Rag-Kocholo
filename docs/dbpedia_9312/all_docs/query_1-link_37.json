        "text": "Aaron Ramsey has probably had a better Euro 2016 than most England players, so Three Lions fans may be pleased to see he’s no longer Welsh, according to Uefa’s website!\n\nThe Arsenal midfielder was named in Ruud Gullit’s fantasy team, but someone somewhere made something of a mess of getting his national team shirt right.\n\nWales fans won’t be too pleased with this error, especially as their unfancied side actually finished above England in Group B.\n\nIf Ramsey is indeed about to make a switch, could Gareth Bale also be convinced? They’re very welcome to Jack Wilshere and Raheem Sterling in a swap deal.\n\nMore surprising perhaps, is that Uefa didn’t include the ‘Welsh Xavi’ Joe Allen in a Spain shirt."
