        "text": "Wales captain Aaron Ramsey is returning to his boyhood club, Cardiff City, it has been confirmed.\n\nRumours have been rife in recent weeks linking Ramsey with a return to the Bluebirds.\n\nCardiff City said he had signed on a two-year deal and also revealed that his oldest son, Sonny Ramsey, had also signed a \"letter of intent\" provisional contract with the Championship club.\n\nRamsey said in a statement: \"It feels unbelievable to finally be back here. I always thought one day I'd come back, and now it's the perfect time to do that.\n\n\"To be back with my family and around familiar faces is just brilliant, so I'm delighted to be back here now. I've missed that a lot in the last year or so, so it was important for me to be back around them.\"\n\nManager Erol Bulut added: \"This is, of course, a great day. Aaron started here, and now he is back to help us to achieve our targets.\"\n\nIt comes after he vowed to be \"back together\" with his family last month ahead of the summer transfer window.\n\nThe midfielder, who is overseeing the Wales campaign to reach Euro 2024, had spent the last year at Nice.\n\nHe began playing for Cardiff as a schoolboy in 1999 and started his senior career at the club before leaving in 2008.\n\nRamsey then moved to Arsenal where he stayed for 11 years, making 262 appearances and scoring 40 goals.\n\nThe Cymru captain spent three years at Juventus from 2019 to 2022 and has also spent periods on loan at Nottingham Forrest and Rangers during his career.\n\nRead more:\n\nWales captain takes part in three peaks challenge for charity\n\nBe the first to get Breaking News\n\nInstall the Sky News app for free\n\n\"The most challenging thing is being away from my family so that's the situation I find myself in but other than that there's a lot of positives that I've taken out of that,\" Ramsey said ahead of the summer international window.\n\n\"Seeing the kids growing up and things like that, missing out on certain things, it's always difficult.\n\n\"It's difficult for anybody to go through I imagine. So whatever we do going forward we will be reunited if you like and back together.\""
