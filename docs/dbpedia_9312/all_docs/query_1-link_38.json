        "text": "Aaron Ramsey starred for Arsenal and continues to shine for Wales. So what's gone wrong for him at Juventus? And what happens next?\n\nThe 31-year-old's recent form for Wales has all the hallmarks of a player who is still operating at his best but he has struggled to make the desired impact at Juventus following his 2019 free transfer from Arsenal, where he scored 64 goals in 369 games.\n\nRamsey made 65 appearances for the Turin giants across his first two campaigns but endured numerous spells out of the side.\n\nAllegri: Ramsey is an outgoing player\n\nTransfer Centre LIVE!\n\nThis season under Massimiliano Allegri, who returned to the club in May to succeed Andrea Pirlo, the situation has worsened. Ramsey has only appeared five times, making his last appearance in September. He has not started back-to-back games for the club since March and is set to leave this month after Allegri confirmed the Welshman is an \"outgoing player\".\n\nWhat's gone wrong for him in Italy? And could he return to the Premier League when the transfer window opens in January? Sky in Italy reporter Francesco Cosatti answers our questions.\n\nWhat were the expectations of Ramsey when he arrived at Juventus?\n\nFC: \"Expectations were high. The only doubts were about his physical condition, with the knowledge that the Welshman's best football had been a few years ago. But by choosing him, Juventus secured a player of the highest level who was much appreciated both on and off the pitch.\"\n\nWhat was the view in Italy on him as a player and his time at Arsenal?\n\nFC: \"There was a clear awareness of what his path at Arsenal had been. He was one of their most important players of the last decade. He was seen as a versatile player who could move between midfield and attack without too much difficulty, and a player who could score goals and play box to box.\"\n\nWas it seen as a good deal for Juventus?\n\nFC: \"The fact that it was a free transfer, with his contract the only expense to Juventus, made it seem like a really good deal. Ramsey had a very good reputation. The fans were aware of his advancing years but believed he was a potential starter in the team - or at least a European-level squad player.\"\n\nSo what has gone wrong for him?\n\nFC: \"There are many aspects. First of all, the many injuries and physical problems. Ramsey has never finished two consecutive games in full at Juventus. This season, he has played 112 minutes across five appearances. It is really too little.\n\n\"The pandemic has also changed all the habits of the players, in terms of how they work, and from that point of view it has certainly been more complicated for him.\n\n\"Then there is the triple change of coach in three years, from Maurizio Sarri, to Pirlo, to Allegri. This last season is definitely the most difficult for him.\"\n\nHow do the Juve hierarchy and fans feel when they see him putting in superb performances for Wales?\n\nFC: \"I can only answer as far as the Juventus fans are concerned: they are surprised and wonder why in Italy Ramsey is unable to produce the same high-level performances.\n\n\"In Italy there is talk of 'Doctor Aaron' and 'Mister Ramsey' to make people understand his dual experience as a footballer. Right now, they are quite disappointed with his performances for Juventus.\"\n\nIs he popular with his team-mates in the Juventus dressing room?\n\nFC: \"The team-mates have a high regard for Aaron. He is a nice guy who fits right in in the locker room. He is very polite and appreciated by all the staff on a human level.\"\n\nHas Ramsey said anything about why it's not worked out?\n\nFC: \"From the national team headquarters in Wales, he implied he had not been 'managed correctly' by Juventus, and that, with Wales, he is given more rest and recovery time after games, unlike at Juventus.\n\n\"But then, the day after Ramsey came back to Turin from the international break, he suffered a physical problem and he wasn't able to join the squad for the match against Lazio.\"\n\nIs there a future for Ramsey at Juventus?\n\nFC: \"January could be a defining month for Ramsey. Probably a new experience would motivate the player more and free up a place in midfield where Juventus could look for a new profile of player.\"\n\nWill they let him leave permanently?\n\nFC: \"We know that Juventus are ready to listen to any interesting offers for Ramsey. He is not seen as non-transferable. The fact he only has five appearances in Serie A and the Champions League this season shows he is not a priority for the manager.\"\n\nIf he does leave, how will his time at Juventus be judged?\n\nFC: \"If Ramsey leaves Juventus, I am sure that in future we would be talking about a high-level European player who, due to too many physical problems, was unable to show all his talent.\n\n\"Off the pitch, he will be remembered as an exceptional young man and professional, who is highly regarded for his character and human value.\"\n\nCould Ramsey return to Premier League?\n\nSpeaking to Sky Sports News, Sky Italy transfer supremo Gianluca Di Marzio said: \"Ramsey may come back to the Premier League. He had an official proposal from Burnley to sign for them, but he said no.\n\n\"He wants to play for a more ambitious team, Newcastle have asked for him too before Christmas. We'll see whether anyone can sign him in January.\"\n\n'Ramsey return likely this month'\n\nSky Sports News' Kaveh Solhekol on The Transfer Show:\n\n\"I don't think he's got a future at Juventus. The manager Massimiliano Allegri was speaking today, he was asked about Aaron Ramsey and he was very dismissive. He basically said that Ramsey is a player who is on his way out of the club.\n\n\"He's barely played... he's played something like just over an hour this season and he's on big, big money. There are reports that he's earning Â£325,000 a week.\n\n\"He's earning that much because he moved to Juventus on a free transfer. It's a really important year for Ramsey because of Wales.\n\n\"They've got this really important World Cup qualifier coming up against Austria, and if they get through that they would face Scotland or Ukraine for a place in the World Cup so Ramsey needs to be playing regularly.\"\n\nFollow the January transfer window with Sky Sports\n\nWho will be on the move in January?\n\nThe January transfer window opened on Saturday, January 1, 2022 and closes at 11pm on Monday, January 31."
