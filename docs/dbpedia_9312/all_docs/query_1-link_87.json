        "text": "Gareth Bale is the Wales player most pored over, but he is not the only show in town and Ramsey, with or without those hair highlights, is proving it in France. If he was seen as the most capable member of Bale's supporting cast before, he is pushing for something close to equal status and it cannot hurt that he is now so easy to make out.\n\nRamsey can be spotted gliding past opposition midfielders like fluorescently-dyed particles moving through the human body. If there is extra scrutiny now, he is rising to it stylishly, making use of the pockets of space he finds in his advanced midfield position, and as in the 3-0 win over Russia, he is having a decisive impact.\n\nRamsey was superb in that final group game against the Russians and managed to outshine Bale. Perhaps most importantly, he is linking up with Bale effectively, too. International teams with one or two obvious stars can sometimes be hindered by a tendency to use them as elements isolated from the rest of the side; it makes sense, as Wales manager Chris Coleman has done, to put your two best players close together and let the chemistry develop. Ramsey and Bale provide a potent, dynamic, intelligent dual threat from deep areas and interchange frequently during games; lose one, and it is hard to get the best out of the other.\n\nNow Ramsey must step up again on arguably the biggest occasion of his career and he may do so as Wales' captain. Ashley Williams is an injury concern for Friday's quarterfinal against Belgium after injuring his shoulder in the round-of-16 win over Northern Ireland. If he is not passed fit to play in Lille, Ramsey will almost certainly be given the chance to show exactly how his game has developed.\n\nIt was a low moment in Ramsey's international career when, back in October 2012, Coleman took away the armband he had been given by former Wales coach Gary Speed at the age of just 20. Ramsey, for all his excellence, was still callow and Coleman believed that with Wales still struggling with the awful impact of Speed's tragic death, a more senior figure would be better suited to shoulder what had become a considerable burden.\n\n\"It takes time to overcome something like that and I don't think we have recovered from it,\" admitted Ramsey at the time, also stating a wish to take the captaincy again one day. \"It was a great privilege to be captain and I'd love to do it again in future.\"\n\nThat day may come sooner than he could have expected.\n\nIf it does, a 25-year-old Ramsey certainly seems equipped for the responsibility. Even if not, he has led through the standard of his performances this summer. \"All areas of Aaron's game in this tournament have been excellent,\" said Coleman of his midfielder prior to the Northern Ireland game, in which Ramsey grew in influence during the second half. \"Positionally he's better, he's a lot more disciplined with us. But when you have a player with that kind of energy, you don't want to restrict him too much, you've got to let him express himself and enjoy himself.\"\n\nRamsey was among the Wales players captured in a video that apparently showed the team celebrating Iceland's win over England earlier this week. The social media reaction it prompted was overblown and it is a sign of the times that this constitutes a story at all.\n\nFar more significant is what Ramsey is achieving on the pitch this summer and the evidence suggests his confidence in standing out from the crowd was justified. There have been few better midfielders in the competition and there may well be much more to come."
