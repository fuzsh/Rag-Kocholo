        "text": "Aaron Ramsey, rekindles his love story with Cardiff City as he aims to take them back to the Premier League while cheering on Arsenal to win it.\n\nAs he steps back onto familiar turf, Aaron Ramsey isn’t just seeking personal success; he’s paving a pathway towards the Premier League and management.\n\nAaron Ramsey: from Cardiff’s hometown hero to Premier League aspirant\n\nAaron Ramsey has come full circle, returning to his hometown club, Cardiff City, with ambitious dreams of not only reinvigorating the club but also pursuing a future in Premier League management.\n\nAfter a career that spanned top clubs in England, Italy, and France, Ramsey is back where it all began, eager to make an indelible mark.\n\nRamsey’s journey took him from the lush valleys of Wales to the glamour of Arsenal, where he spent 11 years and clinched five trophies. His time in Italy with Juventus and a brief stint in France with Nice further enriched his footballing experience. Yet, when the opportunity arose to return to his roots, Ramsey was unwavering in his decision.\n\n“I’ve played at the highest level for the majority of my career but the time was right for me to come back to Cardiff,” Ramsey explained in a recent interview. “On and off the field, it’s the perfect place for me. I always wanted to return one day, and this is a great opportunity.”\n\nThe Championship may not be as glittering as the Premier League, but Ramsey sees it as a challenge worth embracing. Despite a slow start to Cardiff City’s campaign, he remains optimistic about their prospects. Ramsey believes the key lies in learning to see out games when they take the lead, a skill he hopes to help instil in his teammates.\n\nWhile Ramsey’s primary focus remains on his playing career, it’s hard to ignore his growing interest in management. He has already started studying for his coaching qualifications, a testament to his ambition to follow in the footsteps of his former teammate, Mikel Arteta. Ramsey and Arteta played together at Arsenal from 2011 to 2016, and the Welshman recognised Arteta’s managerial potential even then.\n\n“You could always see Arteta had the knowledge, intensity, and desire to be a manager one day,” Ramsey recalled. “He has been brilliant for Arsenal.”\n\n“I would have loved to win the Premier League while I was there and I am rooting for the current side to go on and achieve it.\n\n“They’ve signed good players this summer, they’re back in the Champions League and they’re in a good place. Hopefully they can go one step further.”\n\nArteta, who completed his coaching qualifications at the Welsh FA’s renowned coaching centre in Newport, serves as an inspiration to Ramsey. The former teammates have discussed the transformational effect of coaching qualifications on their understanding of the game. Ramsey envisions a future where he, too, can influence the beautiful game from the touchline.\n\n“I think I want to stay in the game when I finish and maybe one day I will go into management,” he said. “But for the moment I am fully focused on playing and I have many more years left.”\n\nOf course, Ramsey’s journey has not been without its hardships. A career-altering injry occurred on February 27, 2010, when a reckless tackle by Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross left him with fractures to his right leg. The road to recovery was arduous, filled with moments of doubt, but Ramsey’s determination carried him through.\n\n“When you’ve done something like that, your brain tells you not to do it again otherwise you’re going to get hurt,” he reflected. “So it’s about retraining your brain and trusting it again, but that takes a long time.”\n\nIn a testament to his resilience, Ramsey’s career reached new heights after the Shawcross incident. He clinched nine trophies, including FA Cups and a Serie A title, showcasing his ability to bounce back from adversity. Shawcross, meanwhile, retired last year after sliding down the divisions with Stoke.\n\nNow, as Ramsey embarks on this new chapter with Cardiff City, his dream is clear: to guide his boyhood club back to the Premier League.\n\nIt’s a challenge that resonates deeply with him, as it blends his passion for playing with his aspiration to play at the highest level.\n\nWith his unwavering determination and an eye on emulating the success of his former teammate Arteta, Ramsey’s return to Cardiff could be the start of an inspiring new footballing story.\n\nCardiff currently sit in 16th place on seven points from six games. Ramsey has scored three goals in those six games."
