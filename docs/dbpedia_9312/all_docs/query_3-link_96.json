        "text": "It was in August 2009 that an 18-year-old Aaron Ramsey came on for Arsenal in a 3-0 win over Rangers in the Emirates Cup pre-season tournament. The teenage midfielder already had a list of accolades to his name, having become Cardiff City’s youngest player at 16 years and 124 days, the second-youngest player in an FA Cup final and moved to Arsene Wenger’s club for just under £5 million.\n\nHe had built himself a list of admirers, and one of those was Rangers’ former high-performance director Adam Owen.\n\nKnowing Owen was a huge fan of his fellow Welshman, Rangers goalkeeper Neil Alexander made sure he secured Ramsey’s shirt after the game to give to Owen.\n\nAs fate would have it, the following month, Owen joined the Wales national team set-up as their fitness coach. He spent the next nine years working with Ramsey, achieving memorable success in reaching the semi-finals of Euro 2016, and developed such a good relationship they remain good friends.\n\nNow, Ramsey is moving to Ibrox.\n\nOwen has a link to both of Rangers’ deadline-day signings as he gave Polish right-back Mateusz Zukowski his debut as a 16-year-old when managing Lechia Gdansk in 2017 but it is Ramsey, or Rambo as he is known in the game, who could be the game-changer after signing on loan from Italian giants Juventus until the end of the season.\n\nReports in Italy suggested Rangers would pay a fee of around £2 million to gain his services but sporting director Ross Wilson has said that the wage contribution have agreed is within their existing structure. It is understood Juventus agreed deals with others clubs across Europe who could offer a greater financial contribution but Ramsey’s preferred destination was Rangers.\n\n“Aaron and Mateusz are two of my boys. I just need to get (Gareth) Bale there now!” Owen says.\n\n“If they can keep Rambo fit and manage him properly, they’ve pulled off an incredible transfer for Scottish football.\n\n“He’s without a doubt the biggest player (to move to Scotland) since Gazza (joined Rangers in 1995). He’s signing from Juventus.\n\n“He’s really humble, but self-assured. I’m desperate for him to do well and for him to be going to Rangers is fantastic.\n\n“Every international camp, I’d be telling him about the club. I’m just gutted he didn’t come when I was still there.\n\n“He’s got so much ability, he’s top class. Even at Juventus, he went through a period where he was playing, assisting and getting man of the match. When he is fit to play, he is more than capable of playing at that level.\n\n“He’s not done at 31. He wouldn’t be going to Rangers if he wasn’t motivated. He’s fully aware of what it’s like up there and he’s gone there to play and win things. That’s the type of lad he is.”\n\nRamsey moved to Juventus in the summer of 2019 following 11 years at Arsenal where he scored 65 goals in 371 games and won three FA Cups, scoring the winning goal in two of those finals.\n\nAt his peak, Ramsey was a top-level attacking midfielder for them. He scored 16 goals in all competitions in 2013-14 — his best return in a single season — but has reached double figures only twice since.\n\nMuch of that has been because of his fitness problems in Italy. He arrived in Turin still recovering from a hamstring injury and that set the tone for his time there — he has completed 90 minutes just twice in two and a half seasons in Serie A.\n\nEven when he played three games in a row and scored in a crucial victory over Inter Milan in March 2020, COVID-19 arrived and the sense of momentum ground to a half. Just 34 of his 70 Juventus appearances have been starts and his tally of six goals and six assists has not justified the rumoured £400,000 a week wages Juventus agreed to pay him for five years when he signed.\n\nRamsey’s limited availability can be seen in the table below, which shows that you have to go back to the 2017-18 season for the last time he played over half the league minutes. Data from Transfermarkt gives some context to the reasons behind that as he has suffered 13 separate injuries, which have meant he has not had even a few months of sustained fitness.\n\nRamsey’s fitness struggles have not been so obvious when it comes to Wales duty.\n\nHe started all four of their games at last summer’s European Championship and then their final four World Cup qualifiers in October and November, scoring three goals in those matches as they booked a play-off meeting with Austria in March that could lead to a showdown against Scotland a few days later with a place at Qatar 2022 on the line.\n\nHe puts that down to having his own fitness team around him who can provide bespoke advice and training.\n\n“I still feel good, given the opportunity and managed correctly,” he said. “It has been frustrating that I have picked up these little injuries (at Juventus), which have cost me a lot of games. I would like to see myself playing more and be out there more.\n\n“The number of minutes I’ve played, it has been difficult. There have been many factors and changes that I haven’t been used to.”\n\nOwen is a trusted voice for Ramsey and has assisted him in a personal capacity even after he moved to Arsenal and then Juventus. He believes any talking down of the midfielder’s capabilities or suggestions that his body will not let him play regularly anymore are not accurate.\n\n“He’s a top athlete when he’s managed in the right way. He outperforms everyone when he’s physically prepared in the right way,” says Owen.\n\n“From a sports science and medical point of view, you know there are certain players whose output is so much greater, because of the amount of work they put into the game, that they can’t be treated collectively. Everyone has a different physiology, and if they do that they will get the best out of him.\n\n“The relationship we have had for a long time means that I always try to help him out, but it’s been tricky because I’ve been involved in club football all over the world. He has a certain way of working that he has to stick to. It’s about treating him as an individual.”\n\nRamsey is the biggest name to join Rangers since Gascoigne left Lazio for Walter Smith’s side 27 years ago. That was a move that sent shockwaves through Scottish football and the Englishman went on to help the club secure nine-in-a-row.\n\nWith qualification for next season’s Champions League dependent on them retaining the title, there was a clamour for Rangers to make a statement signing after selling Nathan Patterson to Everton this month for a club-record fee.\n\nRamsey is that but the pressure will now be on him to deliver, just as it was for other big names from British football who have come north of the border, such as Roy Keane, Craig Bellamy, Robbie Keane and Joey Barton. However, that will be nothing new, given he and Bale have been the two superstars in their national team for over a decade.\n\n“He’s used to pressure. He had it at 16 (when he made his Cardiff debut at such a young age). He’s grown up with it at Arsenal and Juventus. He just took everything in his stride at Wales,” says Owen.\n\n“He’s a top-class lad who is quiet and just gets on with his job. All the lads loved him as he is down to earth and has a top mentality. He’s not a shouter but he’ll lead the group by example and keep the ball at the right time, he’ll create, he’ll score goals.”\n\nRamsey has performed at the highest level in English and European football. It is easy to forget that amid his recent struggles with injuries this is a player who played 70 minutes in the centre of the park in a 3-0 win over Barcelona in the Nou Camp less than 16 months ago.\n\nHe is Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s fourth signing of the window, following the additions of James Sands and Amad Diallo on loan, and the arrival of 20-year-old Zukowski.\n\n“I got told a lot about him, so I went to watch him play in the under-19s, as a 16-year-old, and I ended up taking him to train with the first-team,” says Owen of their time together at Lechia Gdansk. “I gave him his debut and took him with me to the training camp to play Qarabag in a friendly. I kept him around the first team before moving to China (working under former Wales manager Chris Coleman at Hebei China Fortune).\n\n“Physically, he’s a beast. He is a good kid and physically he was a big strong lad even at that age. He started off in the youth teams as a striker, so we’d play him as a No 9 or a winger in a front three, but he’s obviously developed defensively. If you look at the goal he scored recently, he’s clearly more than a defender as he’s good in attacking areas.\n\n“He’s really powerful, it doesn’t matter where you put him. He had to improve technically and tactically but it looks like he’s done that. He’s got a determination about him and he texted me last night saying he wants to give a good account of himself and will work really hard.\n\n“Lechia was a great club to ground himself in, with a big stadium and the pressure of playing in front of the fans. He had a tough upbringing but he dealt with that and now I just want to see him kick on again.”\n\nOwen is splitting his time between another Polish club Lech Poznan, where he spends a week or two per month as consulting technical director, and his role with ISSPF, a global faculty of sports science and performance educators who partner with clubs and universities. They have partnered with Lech Poznan, Croatia’s Dinamo Zagreb, a South African club who play at African Champions League level and several universities across the globe who have access to a collection of experts in different areas.\n\nPoznan are sitting pretty, four points clear at the top of the Polish league and with a new academy in the pipeline, but Owen harbours ambitions of getting back into coaching in British football.\n\nIf two of his former players can produce the goods for Rangers until the end of the season, however, that will make him a happy man.\n\n(Top photo: Marcio Machado/Getty Images)"
