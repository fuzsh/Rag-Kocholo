        "text": "Cardiff City manager Erol Bulut says Wales did not contact the club before recalling Aaron Ramsey.\n\nThe midfielder, 33, is in Wales' squad for next week's Euro 2024 play-offs despite managing only 72 minutes since a knee injury in September.\n\nA calf strain meant Ramsey was expected to miss out on Wales duty but, having returned to training, he could feature in Saturday's derby at Swansea City.\n\n\"We will decide [Friday] if he will be in the squad or not,\" said Bulut.\n\n\"I don't want to risk Aaron to let him play 20 or 30 minutes and then lose him for the rest of the season, so I need to speak to the medical team and Ramsey.\n\n\"I was expecting [communication] from the management or manager of Wales, but I haven't had any discussion or communication with him about that.\n\n\"In the past he [Wales manager Robert Page] made some talks to the press which was in a different way.\n\n\"I would advise him to have better communication with us or at least the medical department, before the press.\"\n\nWales face Finland in a play-off semi-final at Cardiff City Stadium on Thursday, 21 March with a potential final against Poland or Estonia to follow five days later, also in Cardiff, for a place in this summer's European Championship.\n\nThe return of Ramsey is a major boost for Wales after Bulut initially ruled him out of the play-offs.\n\nCardiff and the Football Association of Wales (FAW) share a training base on the outskirts of the Welsh capital, adding to Bulut's frustration that he heard nothing in advance about Ramsey's recall.\n\n\"We have to communicate. We're not far away from each other so it's easy normally,\" he said.\n\n\"It was not positive what he [Page] said before so we need to talk together and to the medical department to know what he is thinking or what we are thinking.\n\n\"We are not people that don't give news also. He is a national player, of course [Page] has to know about the players, but he can also speak with us.\""
