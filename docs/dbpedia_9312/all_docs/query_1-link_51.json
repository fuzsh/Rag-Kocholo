        "text": "AARON RAMSEY is considering his Wales future after their cruel Euro 2024 play-off exit.\n\nThe Dragons captain, 33, was an unused substitute and watched on as Dan James suffered penalty heartbreak in the 5-4 shootout loss to Poland in Cardiff on Tuesday night.\n\nThe painful defeat ended Welsh hopes of qualifying for this summer’s finals in Germany.\n\nRamsey has won 84 caps and is sixth on the all-time list of goalscorers with a tally of 21 strikes.\n\nBut it is understood to be weighing up whether he will play on for his country in the 2026 World Cup qualifying campaign.\n\nThe Cardiff midfielder has had an injury-plagued season with a knee injury keeping him out for five months.\n\nAfter returning for two substitute appearances for the Bluebirds, Ramsey picked up a calf injury and was a doubt for the Euro play-offs.\n\nHe was named in Robert Page’s squad and played 20 minutes for Cardiff in the South Wales derby defeat to Swansea on March 16.\n\nBut Ramsey did not play a single minute either against Finland in last Thursday’s 4-1 win or the Poland defeat with Ben Davies taking over as captain.\n\nRamsey, who has a year left on his Cardiff contract, was part of three major qualification successes with Wales.\n\nCASINO SPECIAL - BEST CASINO WELCOME OFFERS\n\nHe was named in the team of the tournament at Euro 2016 where Chris Coleman’s men reached the semi-finals.\n\nThe ex-Arsenal and Juventus star also played at the delayed Euro 2020 and the 2022 World Cup – Wales’ first global appearance since 1958.\n\nThe World Cup qualifiers start next March and Ramsey would be 35 by the time the finals in USA, Canada and Mexico come around if Wales qualified.\n\nNottingham Forest goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey, 37, who has 109 caps, is another Wales player who could now weigh up his international future.\n\nPage said: “There have been no conversations like that. It’s been an hour since we’ve ended the game. Aaron was a big part of this squad.\n\n\"It’s not just what he brings on the pitch, it’s off the pitch as well. We want to continue to add to the squad and at the right time we will start introducing the younger ones in.\"\n\nWhen quizzed why Ramsey was not brought on in extra-time or for penalties, Page added: “Who could he have come on to replace?\n\n\"We needed the two 6s in the middle of the park. We weren’t going to take any more gambles or unnecessary risks late on into injury-time.\n\n\"We made the changes which we thought were going to go on and win us the game.”"
