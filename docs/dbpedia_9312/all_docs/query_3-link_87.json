        "text": "The Metro says “Aaron Ramsey selection for City encounter baffles Arsenal fans”\n\nAre we winning the midfield battle?\n\nBy Cameron Wolfe\n\nI wonder if those same Arsenal fans were still baffled after the game had finished.\n\nI thought for most of the game we were awesome. We played once again as a team from front to back and definitely dominated the midfield.\n\nFor the fifth Premier league game we defended well. We definitely had the best chances and even had more possession (52%). More importantly we bossed the midfield. This was down to the four midfielders interchanging and closing down City at every opportunity. At the heart of it was Aaron Ramsey.\n\nIt was great to see him start a game for Arsenal and even better to see him still there at the end. After he came on late in the Southampton game last week I was impressed by how effortlessly he slotted in. He was always driving forward, willing to take a shot at goal and closing down the opposition when he needed to.\n\nAgainst City he started the game just as he finished last week. It would be hard to single out anyone in particular as man of the match but Aaron would have to been there or there abouts for the award.\n\nAre we now seeing what Arsene Wenger saw when he first signed the young Welshman at only eighteen? I think we are. He’s a genuine midfielder. He can motor box to box. He likes to shoot when in a good position even from outside the box and he’s not afraid to tackle. Even after suffering that awful leg break two and a half years ago. After missing a more than whole season out recovering from the break and then being loaned out to build up his fitness/sharpness. He’s now at least getting back to his very best.\n\nWith a midfield of Diaby, Arteta, Santi and Ramsey. We were more than a match for City who boast some of the most expensive players in the EPL. With Jack and Thomas almost back to full fitness. Not counting the others who are pushing for a first team place then we can hope to have the strength and depth to compete on all fronts this season.\n\nOnce again looking at the bench during the City game. It’s more than encouraging (Keeper aside) to see a strong bench. As has been proved time and again it’s bringing on a proven experienced player at crucial times that can be game changing. Over the next few months injures aside we should have that in abundance.\n\nDominating the midfield is crucial in any football game but more so in the EPL. It’s the teams who boss the midfield and create the chances that end up winning the games. Against City with a little luck and better finishing we could have easily came away with three well won points.\n\nAfter the match Arsene said “It’s down to consistency and what happened today should strengthen our belief”\n\nIf we keep on playing the way we have been since the start of the season then theirs no reason we shouldn’t be pushing the other teams even closer come May.\n\n——————\n\nThe club that changed football\n\nLooking for a terraced house in Northamptonshire?"
