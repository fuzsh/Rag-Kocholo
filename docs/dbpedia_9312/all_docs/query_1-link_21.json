        "text": "The former Arsenal man will add quality and further competition in the middle of the park for Giovanni van Bronckhorst’s side as they continue to compete on three fronts between now and May.\n\nRamsey began his career at Cardiff City, and was their youngest-ever player. After helping the Championship side reach the FA Cup final in 2008, he made the move to Arsenal.\n\nWith the Gunners, he scored the winner against Allan McGregor’s Hull City in the 2014 FA Cup Final, won the tournament again the year after and grabbed another winner in the 2017 Final.\n\nIn all, he made 371 appearances for the London club in an extraordinary 11-year spell which was punctuated with loan time at Nottingham Forest and Cardiff in 2010/11 as he recovered from a broken leg.\n\nHe joined Juve in 2019, and has made 83 appearances for the Old Lady in two-and-a-half seasons. In that time, he also added a Serie A title and a Coppa Italia to his name.\n\nInternationally, Ramsey has been a mainstay of the Wales national team for a number of years. He was a key part of the side which earned them qualification for Euro 2016 – their first major tournament in 58 years.\n\nHe was then named as part of UEFA’s ‘Team of the Tournament’ for his role in helping the Welsh reach an unprecedented semi-final, where with Ramsey suspended, they were eventually defeated by Portugal.\n\nRamsey would also help the Welsh to the rescheduled Euro 2020, and there, they again made it out of their group to the Last 16 where they were defeated by Denmark.\n\nIn all, he has 71 Wales caps to his name and has netted 20 times for his country. He also featured for Great Britain at the 2012 Olympic Games, scoring once in five appearances.\n\nRamsey now arrives at Rangers to add his wealth of international, Champions League, Premier League and Serie A experience to the squad.\n\nSpeaking after agreeing his deal at Rangers, a delighted Ramsey said: “I am really pleased to be joining a club like Rangers, where there is so much to look forward to between now and May.\n\n“I had a number of offers on the table, but none matched the magnitude of this club, with European football and the chance to play in front of 50,000 fans every other week.\n\n“I have had some fantastic conversations with the manager and Ross Wilson, and I’m really looking forward to working with both of them, and to meeting the supporters.”\n\nManager, Giovanni van Bronckhorst, continued: “I’m absolutely delighted that we have been able to add a player of Aaron’s quality, experience and leadership to our squad.\n\n“As soon as it was mooted as a possibility, I was really keen for us to try everything to get the deal done, and huge credit must go to Ross and to the Board for the work they have put in on this.\n\n“I look forward to welcoming Aaron to the training centre tomorrow.”\n\nSporting Director, Ross Wilson, added: “This is a really exciting signing for both Rangers and Aaron. As soon as I was made aware of the opportunity we had to bring Aaron to Rangers around a week ago, we have worked really hard to secure his signature.\n\n“Not only is Aaron a world-class player who will play a key role in our team, his level of ability and professional standards will be an inspiration to our existing players.\n\n“We see Aaron as a leader, a quality player and a wonderful character to bring into our club. I’ve admired his career since his emergence at Cardiff and across Arsenal, Juventus and with Wales. We are all looking forward to working with him closely.\n\n“I am thankful to Juventus for their professional approach and discretion. Juventus and Aaron had many significant offers from elsewhere and we are delighted that he has chosen Rangers.\n\n“Any agreement we reach has to be within our normal wage model and Aaron’s desire to play here has enabled us to achieve this with Juventus’s cooperation.”\n\nA subscription to RangersTV starts from just £6 per month, and provides not only exclusive access to the club’s teams, but also original feature videos and documentaries, our incredibly popular Inside Ibrox and Away Days shows and our extensive archive of match action from through the years.\n\nJoin the action on RangersTV here"
