        "text": "Not to be confused with Aaron Ramsey (born 2003).\n\nAaron James Ramsey (born 26 December 1990) is a Welsh professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for Premier League club Cardiff City]] and the Wales national team. Ramsey mainly plays as a box-to-box midfielder, but has also been deployed on the left and right wings.\n\nRamsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a £5 million deal, where he quickly gained first team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against Stoke City in February 2010. After two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the 2011–12 season. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the 2013–14 season campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Hull City.\n\nRamsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their UEFA Euro 2016 campaign, where he helped his country to the semi-finals and was included in the Team of the Tournament and also helped Wales to the last 16 of UEFA Euro 2020. Ramsey then helped Wales qualify for the FIFA World Cup in 2022 for the first time since 1958, describing it as a \"dream come true\".\n\nHonours[]\n\nClub[]\n\nCardiff City\n\nFA Cup runner-up: 2007–08\n\nArsenal\n\nFA Cup: 2013–14, 2014–15, 2016–17\n\nFA Community Shield: 2014, 2015\n\nEFL Cup runner-up: 2017–18\n\nUEFA Europa League runner-up: 2018–19\n\nJuventus\n\nSerie A: 2019–20\n\nCoppa Italia: 2020–21; 2019–20\n\nSupercoppa Italiana: 2020\n\nRangers\n\nScottish Cup: 2021–22\n\nUEFA Europa League runner-up: 2021–22\n\nIndividual[]\n\nWelsh Young Player of the Year: 2009, 2010\n\nPremier League Player of the Month: September 2013\n\nArsenal Player of the Season Award: 2013–14, 2017–18=\n\nLondon Player of the Year: 2014\n\nUEFA European Championship top assist provider: 2016\n\nUEFA European Championship Team of the Tournament: 2016\n\nPremier League Goal of the Month: October 2018\n\n[]\n\nAaron Ramsey profile at Arsenal F.C.\n\nAaron Ramsey profile at Soccerbase\n\nAaron Ramsey profile at Goal.com\n\nWales"
