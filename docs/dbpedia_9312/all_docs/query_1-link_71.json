There's still no reason why Ramsey might not be back for the final qualifier of the year is there? And Collison's surgery should be healed by pre-season, I read elsewhere.\n\nAnyone know the truth behind how long these two are gonna be out?\n\nPost by Tim P on\n\nnot heard any updates on ramsey in a while, apart from the endless shawcross sympathy articles: 'boo hoo ramsey never returns my calls' etc\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nAn update would be good but can't find any anywhere.\n\nRemembering how he totally outshone them all as a 17 year old in the under 21 playoff, its really frustrating now watching the likes of Milner, Adam Johnson, Huddlestone getting all the plaudits.\n\nPost by squatter1 on\n\nAw, man - looks like Collison is out till new year after all.\n\nnews.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/w/west_ham_utd/8668696.stm\n\nWith a full team, we had a chance. With our first choice central midfield pair injured for the first three matches, we're screwed. How much bad luck can you get?\n\nPost by saints19 on\n\nWe still have Ledley Edwards, Stock, Dorman.....not really ideal but we have options playing at a decent level. Plus, Ramsey (who with respect to Jack is by far the better) is supposed to be coming back in autumn this year.\n\nPost by caeboy on\n\nHello All. Last I saw on Aaron via Arsenal.com was posted April 29th. Early Autumn!\n\nAaron suffered a broken leg against Stoke City in February but has made good progress in his recovery and could return to action in the autumn. \"Aaron will make a full recovery,\" confirmed physio Colin Lewin. \"Other footballers have suffered a similar injury. The surgery went very well and the early signs are very good. We don't expect Aaron to return until the early autumn. He has some metalwork in there and that provides the stability for the fracture. The specialists have encouraged him to walk and this weight-bearing will aid the fracture healing. It’s early days but the signs are very good.\"\n\nPost by dwyrainpell on\n\nI spoke to Brian Flynn in Manchester airport\n\nlast Saturday (I just approached him and said hello - really friendly guy).\n\nHe said that Aaron is completely fine and will be in training from July. He also\n\nsaid that Collison was p'd off with all the rumours about\n\nswitching alliegance - he's a 100% comitted.\n\nPost by jon6a on\n\nI really hope Ramsey doesn't turn out like Eduardo and become a shadow of his former self. Hopefully he's young enough to recover fully, maybe he'll be more determined to become a better player, who knows?\n\nPost by Deleted on\n\nGunter's said a couple of days ago that Rambo will be running in a few weeks and kicking a ball a few weeks after that.\n\nIf he is in training from July, there is no doubt AW will want to bring him through very slowly and carefully at Arsenal. Can't see him being available for September and Montenegro but is there an outside chance of him being available for the key double header in October now?\n\nPost by idiot on\n\nit'll be interesting to see if collison finds a bit of form when he comes back,he had gone off the boil somewhat at west ham before his injury\n\nPost by flynnfan on\n\nI think Collison going 'off the boil' might well have been related to his injury. Bit like Ledley at he start of last season. Hopefully he'll come back strongly after a long rest.\n\nPost by idiot on\n\nI think Collison going 'off the boil' might well have been related to his injury.
