        "text": "Two summers ago, Aaron Ramsey’s future at Arsenal was in doubt. Many Gunners fans were demanding a transfer or, at the very least, a loan away from the Emirates so he could regain his once-promising form.\n\nStill shaken by the 2010 horror tackle and ensuing, gruesome leg break that robbed him of his confidence and comfort on the pitch, Ramsey looked a shell of the player he had been tapped as following his big-money move from Cardiff as a 17-year-old. But with the passage of time and the help of a sports psychologist, he gradually moved past the nightmares of Ryan Shawcross’s shocking challenge.\n\nNow still just 23 years old, Ramsey is the best player in the Premier League — yes, you read that correctly — and, more so than even the $130 million duo Alexis Sanchez and Mesut Ozil, the central figure in Arsenal’s quest for domestic and Champions League glory.\n\nRamsey’s skill and comfort on the ball often catches the eye first. Equally adept in close confines or open spaces, he terrorizes opponents with an array of flicks, back heels, and audacious dribbles.\n\nIn this respect, his game looks far more La Masia than Rhymney Valley Comprehensive School, the humble school in rural Wales where Ramsey began his soccer career and somehow developed sublime quality on the ball while his mates were off playing rugby.\n\nAs valuable as Ramsey’s skill on the ball, though, are his goals. He scored 16 in 34 games in all competitions last season, and many of a very high quality.\n\nRamsey’s scoring prowess seemingly came out of nowhere, as he scored more goals in 2013–14 alone than he had in his previous 104 appearances for Arsenal, from 2008–2013.\n\nOftentimes, when a player manages a surprisingly high goal tally in a given season, it is the result of an unsustainably high shot conversion rate, leading to inevitable regression in the following season. But Ramsey had an only slightly-above-average rate of scoring on 37 percent of his shots on target. Thus, rather than fluky variance, it likely was a combination of more favorable shot locations and skill refinement. The history of the Premier League shows that its best scorers often take a significant leap at age 22. All of this suggests Ramsey should be able to repeat last season’s scoring success this time around. Early returns are promising, as he scored in Arsenal’s first two matches of the season.\n\nAlong with his substantial attacking quality, Ramsey also brings it on the defensive end, where he parlays his endless stamina into superb tackling numbers. Ramsey’s 65 total tackles ranked 17th in the league, despite his missing three and a half months with a thigh injury. He also tackled at a tidy 57 percent success rate, especially impressive given the increased difficulty of tackling higher up the field.\n\nIn composite, Ramsey’s offense-defense combination makes him unparalleled in the Premier League. Only Cesc Fabregas, Yaya Toure, and Steven Gerrard can approach his offensive contributions from the center of midfield (with all three relying more on set pieces than Ramsey does, anyway), and each has severe defensive limitations. Fabregas gets by without playing much defense at all, shielded by the dogged effort and disciplined positioning of Nemanja Matic and often John Obi Mikel and/or Ramires. Toure sneakily doesn’t play much more defense than Fabregas, tackling at far less than half the rate Ramsey did a season ago and relying on Fernand(inh)o to defend the middle of the pitch. And Gerrard’s defensive game has been slipping for years with his advancing age (pun richly intended).\n\nWith a goal every 185 league minutes and an assist every 231, very few forwards even matched Ramsey’s overall contributions. And no forward or attacking midfielder can even come close to his defensive work. It all adds up to a frighteningly well-rounded player, a jack-of-all trades who is a master of most trades, too.\n\nHow crucial is Ramsey for Arsenal? Well, raw numbers help paint part of the picture: prior to Ramsey’s injury on Boxing Day, Arsenal won 68 percent of their games last season. That number fell to 55 percent in his absence. When Ramsey finally returned in April, Arsenal won all five of his starts, including the FA Cup final, in which he scored the excellent extra-time winner. Small samples and all, those numbers are admittedly subject to a litany of non-Ramsey factors, but closer analysis shows just how and why Ramsey is so essential to the Arsenal cause.\n\nMost noticeably, Ramsey “gambles” in the box like no other Arsenal player. The Gunners are often content to pass the ball around the final third without much of a cutting edge; even now-injured primary striker Olivier Giroud prefers to bring his teammates into play with his back to goal rather than make runs in behind the defense. Ramsey, on the other hand—though plenty adept at playing the Arsenal Way—uses his prolific fitness to burst into the box at every opportunity, as he did last week at Everton to score a goal generally reserved for center forwards.\n\nThe fact that this goal came in the 83rd minute makes it even more vintage Ramsey, as most other center mids would be too tired to make this type of run, especially at two goals down and with the game seemingly lost.\n\nAll in all, his willingness to get into advanced positions (and stay there even if he doesn’t immediately receive the ball) gives Arsenal a much-needed scorer of the type of scrappy goals that often prove decisive in big games. On the road last season in something of a must-win Champions League game at reigning finalists Borussia Dortmund, Ramsey’s persistence in the box led to a famous winner.\n\nRamsey, though, is even more valuable to Arsenal for his ability to turn defense into attack.\n\nSome players—Mesut Ozil and Santi Cazorla for Arsenal—can spring counterattacks by dribbling away from pressure and playing a smart pass to an advancing runner. Others—think Theo Walcott and Alexis Sanchez—thrive on the receiving end of those passes. But very few players are capable of consistently starting and then finishing counters all by themselves.\n\nEnter Ramsey, whose unique combination of pace, stamina, dribbling skills, vision, and finishing makes him a genuinely absurd counterattacking proposition. Among many prime examples from a season ago, Ramsey’s finest counterattacking moment came at his boyhood club of Cardiff. Before you watch, keep in mind that this came in the 90th minute, when mortal players are far too tired to sprint 10 yards, let alone 70.\n\nThis was a familiar enough pattern when Ramsey was fit a season ago. Again and again, Ramsey was the one receiving the ball from a defender (or winning it himself) before racing down the entire pitch to score, assist, or facilitate a goal with a key pass.\n\nOn the defensive side, Ramsey’s presence gives Arsenal a stability they sorely lack when he’s off the pitch, as his tackling prowess and boundless running help him thwart opposing counters. Further, his aforementioned ability to drive out from the defensive third into the attack is essential in relieving pressure and allowing Arsenal’s defenders to rest.\n\nWith Ramsey in the team, Arsenal picked up shutout wins at home to Liverpool and Napoli, as well as the road shutout at Dortmund. Without him, Arsenal’s most impressive clean sheet was probably home to Manchester United or away at Tottenham, neither a particularly impressive achievement last season. And only with Ramsey out in the second half of the season did the Gunners fall apart at the hands of Chelsea, Liverpool, and Everton. Overall, in Ramsey’s 1,849 Premier League minutes, Arsenal conceded just 17 goals. In the 1,748 minutes he was off the field, the Gunners conceded 24 times.\n\nAll told, Ramsey is the key man for Arsenal if they plan on winning any major silverware this season, as his ability on both sides of the ball is unmatched in England. Injuries kept him out of far too many of Arsenal’s big games a season ago, but he’ll get the chance a week from Saturday against Manchester City to remind the world just how good he is.\n\nAll statistics courtesy of Opta."
