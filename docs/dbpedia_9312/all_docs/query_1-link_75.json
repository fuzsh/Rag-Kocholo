        "text": "Tonight in Denmark, Wales are set to hand Arsenal's Aaron Ramsey his first cap in what is being hailed as the biggest Wales debut since Ryan Giggs made his debut in 1991.\n\nRamsey first emerged earlier this year as a substitute in Cardiff City's hugely successful FA Cup run, winning admirers all over Europe. He quickly made it into the Bluebirds first team, and came on as a substitute at the FA Cup Final against Portsmouth.\n\nAfter that match, the likes of Everton and Manchester United beat paths to his door, but it was Arsenal who secured his signature for Â£5 million.\n\nSince his arrival at Emirates Stadium, Ramsey has mainly been used in the much-heralded Carling Cup team but has also come on as a substitute in Premier League games and has scored in the Champions League against Fenerbahce.\n\nArsene Wenger has said that Ramsey is likely to be a regular member of the first team for the 2009/2010 season.\n\nHis international form has been amazing as well. At just 17 years old, Ramsey has been the best player in Wales' Under-21 team, and was the man of the match in both playoff legs against England, which the Welsh narrowly lost 5-4 on aggregate.\n\nIn the second leg at Villa Park, Ramsey scored a wonder goal from long range, which made the world take notice of his talents.\n\nWales coach John Toshack obvious liked what he saw, and though he has called Ramsey up to Welsh squads before, as an unused substitute, tonight is the first game he's guaranteed to start.\n\nRamsey will be the playmaker in the Welsh midfield, and from what I've seen so far, he won't be afraid of any opposition, especially given that Denmark will be led in attack by Ramsey's Arsenal team-mate Nicklas Bendtner.\n\nRamsey demands the ball whenever he doesn't have it, and that's a lot of balls for a 17 year old to be like that on the pitch. He can also put in the tackles, and still set up the attack.\n\nWales don't have another qualifier until March, so after tonight, there's another game in February to bed him in, but one thing is for certain: This will not be Aaron Ramsey's only Welsh cap."
