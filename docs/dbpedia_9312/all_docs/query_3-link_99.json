We released the rating of Roberto Firmino yesterday. He got 86 total points with highest 90 in tenacity. The detailed results are as follows:\n\nNow, let's welcome our guest today - Aaron Ramsey!\n\nCast your vote from 6 dimensions - Pace, Dribbling, Shooting, Passing, Physicality and Tenacity (5 is the highest and 1 is the lowest). The Final points = Total points of 6 dimensions /6 * 20.\n\nReminder: Ratings could be changed according to the positions in the field (like shot for strikers and save for goalkeepers).\n\nAaron Ramsey is a Welsh footballer who plays as a midfielder for Arsenal. He mainly plays as a box-to-box midfielder but has also been deployed on the left and right wings.\n\nRamsey played as a schoolboy for Cardiff City, where he spent eight years in youth football, became the club's youngest ever first team player, and made 22 appearances for the senior team â including the 2008 FA Cup Final.\n\nRamsey moved to Arsenal in 2008 in a Â£5 million deal, where he quickly gained the first-team experience. However, his career stalled significantly after he suffered a broken leg in a match against Stoke City in February 2010.\n\nAfter two loan spells away from Arsenal, he returned to full fitness and re-established himself as a regular starter during the 2011â12 season. Ramsey was a key player for Arsenal in the 2013â14 season campaign, scoring 16 goals in all competitions, including the winner in the 2014 FA Cup Final against Hull City. He also played in the 2015 FA Cup Final, which Arsenal wonï¼ and scored a second FA Cup winning goal in 2017.\n\nRamsey made his full international debut for Wales in 2008 and was part of their UEFA Euro 2016 campaign, where he was included in the Team of the Tournament. He also represented Great Britain at the 2012 Olympics. He earned 58 caps with 14 goals for Wales until now.\n\nHere are some fantastic moments of Ramsey:\n\nWho do you want to see tomorrow? Vote for your player!"
