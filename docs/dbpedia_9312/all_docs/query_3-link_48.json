        "text": "AARON RAMSEY has been one of Wales' key players since his breakthrough at Cardiff City as a youngster.\n\nMaking 75 appearances for Wales and scoring 20 goals, Ramsey has been part of an impressive squad - and he'll be hoping to add to his tally in Qatar.\n\nThe most impressive run for the Dragons was in Euro 2016, where Wales reached the semi-final before falling to defeat to Portugal.\n\nRamsey netted once and registered four assists in the tournament, including setting up two goals against Belgium in a famous quarter-final victory.\n\nHe will be hoping to impress as Wales face Iran in their latest clash in Group B at the World Cup.\n\nWho does Aaron Ramsey play for?\n\nThe midfielder's most notorious spell was with Arsenal, where he spent 11 years and made 371 appearances before taking a risk to move to Italy on a free transfer.\n\nA significant pay rise saw Ramsey touted as the future of Juventus' midfield but his time at the club was hampered by injuries, playing just 70 times in three years.\n\nWith speculation surrounding his future in 2021, Ramsey departed on a season-long loan to Scottish side Rangers.\n\nUnfortunately for Ramsey, the most memorable moment of his spell at the Gers was a penalty shoot-out miss in the Europa League final against Eintracht Frankfurt.\n\nHis Juventus contract expired in 2022, allowing Ramsey to depart for free and he was heavily linked with a move to Nottingham Forest as well as a potential return to Cardiff being touted."
