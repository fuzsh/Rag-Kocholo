Become a member today\n\nWales captain Aaron Ramsey is reportedly close to re-joining boyhood Cardiff City.\n\nThe Caerphilly-born midfielder, 32, completed a medical at the club on Thursday July 13.\n\nHe is now set to leave French side OGC Nice on a free transfer after one season on the Riviera.\n\nIt has been rumoured that Ramsey had offers on the table from clubs in Saudi Arabia, but has opted for a return to south Wales instead.\n\nRamsey came through the Bluebirds’ academy before leaving the club to join Arsenal back in 2008.\n\nDuring an 11-year spell in North London, Ramsey made 371 appearances and scored 65 goals.\n\nHe also lifted the FA Cup three times, scoring the winning goals in the 2014 and 2017 finals.\n\nHis time at Arsenal also saw him return to Cardiff on loan in 2011.\n\nHe left the Gunners in 2019 to join Italian giants Juventus.\n\nRamsey’s time in Italy came to an end in 2022 after his contract was “mutually terminated” a year early.\n\nHe departed Juventus after helping the club to one Serie A title, as well as picking up a Coppa Italia and a Supercoppa Italia.\n\nWhile at Juventus, the former Ysgol Gyfun Cwm Rhymni pupil had a six-month loan spell at Scottish side Rangers – but his time in Glasgow was hampered by injury.\n\nHe joined Ligue 1 side OGC Nice in the summer of 2022, but his stint in the south of France now looks to be coming to an end.\n\nInternationally, Ramsey has won 82 caps for Wales and starred as the side reached the EURO 2016 semi-finals in France.\n\nHe was also involved in Wales’ EURO 2020 and 2022 World Cup campaigns, and took over as captain following Gareth Bale’s retirement earlier this year.\n\nRamsey recently unveiled a new football pitch at Trinity Fields School and Resource Centre in Ystrad Mynach.\n\nSign-up to our daily newsletter\n\nOGC Nice"
