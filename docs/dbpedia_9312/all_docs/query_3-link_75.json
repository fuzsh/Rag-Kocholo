        "text": "Wales captain Aaron Ramsey has held talks with Cardiff over a sensational return to his boyhood club, talkSPORT undertands.\n\nRamsey, who played for Cardiff in the 2008 FA Cup final as a teenager, is a free agent after being released by French club Nice.\n\nThe former Arsenal midfielder is understood to have rejected offers from Turkey.\n\nRamsey swapped the Bluebirds for the Gunners in 2008, but was back at the Cardiff City Stadium in January 2011 for a one-month loan.\n\nComing back from the horrific broken leg he suffered away at Stoke, Arsene Wenger was keen for him to gain match fitness.\n\nHaving impressed so much in his six Championship, Cardiff asked for a loan extension until the end of the season - which was immediately rejected by Arsenal.\n\nBut he could now be making a permanent move back to his old stomping ground to add to his 28 appearances in all competitions.\n\nCardiff's new boss Erol Bulu was recently asked about a potential move for the three-time FA Cup winner.\n\nRemaining coy, he said: \"I will tell you more next week if we can get to sign some players, so then you will know.\"\n\nBulu also stated he met with the Wales skipper in Cardiff last month when the Dragons lost 4-2 against Armenia in a Euro 2024 qualifier.\n\nHe stated: \"I met him in the stadium when he was playing against Armenia. I saw him play, that’s it.\n\n“Maybe. Maybe I’m going to meet him following this. We will see, we never know.\"\n\nRamsey, who spent just one season in France, scored just once from his 34 outings as Nice finished in ninth spot.\n\nShould he make the move to the Championship outfit, he will be looking to inspire them to top-flight football after four seasons spent in the second-tier."
