        "text": "Wales have suffered a huge injury blow in their quest for automatic Euro 2024 qualification as captain Aaron Ramsey has been ruled out. Cymru play against Croatia in a crunch qualifier match on October 15th, but Cardiff City manager Erol Bulut has explained that he does not expect the veteran to be fit for Wales.\n\nFollowing their 2-0 win over Rotherham on Saturday, the Cardiff City manager said Ramsey isn't likely to be fit for Wales: \"\"I don't think so,\" he said. \"Not possible... If it was possible he would be here today with us.\"\n\nREAD MORE: Buzzing Erol Bulut delighted with 'perfect' run of wins but urges patience as Cardiff City soar into play-off spots\n\nRATINGS: Brilliant Cardiff City player ratings v Rotherham as Etete on another level and defender has right old ding-dong\n\nHe added: \"It was a rupture on his tendon, where he had an injury many years before (and) he got surgery.\n\n\"We have to see how they get it healed, maybe an operation or not. We are waiting.\"\n\nWales picked up a helpful 2-0 win over Latvia back in September, but they need a draw or win over Croatia to keep automatic qualification hopes alive in Group D.\n\nCymru currently sit in fourth place, and are three points behind Croatia and Turkey, who are tied at the top.\n\nWales first face Gibraltar in a friendly on October 11th, before their big clash against Croatia just four days later."
