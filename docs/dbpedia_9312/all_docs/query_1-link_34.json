        "text": "AARON RAMSEY has sealed his ‘perfect’ homecoming to boyhood club Cardiff on a free transfer.\n\nAnd the Wales skipper, who had his Nice contract terminated by mutual consent on Saturday, was joined by eldest boy Sonny, 7, after he signed for the Bluebirds' academy.\n\nCaerphilly-born Ramsey then signed a two-year deal after turning\n\ndown a lucrative offer from Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe star midfielder, 32, was beaming as he was pictured signing his deal alongside his boy, who has put pen to paper on an intent-to-sign which will see him officially join the academy when he turns eight.\n\nThe pair also sported No10 shirts as they walked out at their new home of the Cardiff City Stadium.\n\nRamsey tweeted: \"It's an unbelievable feeling to be back at home.\n\n\"Although I feel as if I never really left. Wherever I went it was always a part of me and now I can't wait to go out there in the blue shirt again.\n\n\"What makes it even better was my boy also signed for Cardiff academy the same day which was a special moment for us both.\"\n\nRamsey had already agreed personal terms - which included a pay-cut - with Cardiff and passed a medical on Thursday.\n\nBut he was waiting for the green light from Nice to complete the move.\n\nThe ex-Arsenal and Juventus star triggered a 12-month contract extension after playing 34 games in Ligue 1.\n\nBETTING SPECIAL - BEST SPORTS BETTING APPS IN THE UK\n\nBut talks between Ramsey’s representatives and the French club finally reached a positive solution which allowed him to resign for Cardiff.\n\nRamsey started his career with the Bluebirds and became the Welsh side's youngest ever player in April 2007 at the age of 16 years and 123 days - a record that stands to this day.\n\nHe left for Arsene Wenger's Arsenal over Manchester United after the FA Cup final 1-0 loss to Portsmouth in 2008.\n\nRamsey added: “It feels unbelievable to be back here.\n\n\"I always thought one day I’d come back and now it’s the perfect time.\n\n\"To be back with my family and around familiar faces is just brilliant so I'm delighted to be back here now.\n\n\"I've missed that a lot in the last year or so, it was important for me to be back around them.\n\n\"I’m a Cardiff fan, and watching them over the years since I’ve been away, we’ve had some low points but some big highs as well, being in the Premier League and representing Cardiff on the big stage.\n\n\"That’s a target of mine - to try and help my teammates and this club to get back to the top.\n\n“I’ve said it many times in the past - I owe so much to Cardiff, to the fans, to everybody who has been at the club when I was here as a young boy coming through.\n\n“For me now to come full circle, to be part of this team now, and hopefully achieve the goals we want, there’s no better feeling than that.”"
