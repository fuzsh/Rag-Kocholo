        "text": "Aaron Ramsey will miss Wales' Wembley friendly against England on Thursday after his club Juventus put their players into a bio-secure 'bubble'.\n\nTwo non-playing staff members at the Turin club tested positive for cornavirus and the whole team have gone into \"fiduciary isolation\", which Juventus said means the players can \"carry out regular training and match activities, but will not be allowed contact with [anyone] outside the group\".\n\nRamsey started Juventus' first two matches of the Serie A season, in a promising sign that new manager Andrea Pirlo sees him as an integral member of the side, unlike his predecessor Maurizio Sarri. But although he was ready to start Sunday's match against Napoli, the game was called off in peculiar circumstances.\n\nNapoli failed to turn up after their squad was placed in isolation following positive coronavirus tests. Napoli issued a statement saying they were ordered not to travel by their local health authority but the league refused to postponed the fixture and Juventus' players turned up only to find their opponents had not come. Under current Serie A rules, Juventus will be given a 3-0 victory for the game unless Napoli successfully appeal the league's decision.\n\nWales hope that Ramsey will be available for the following Nations League games away against the Republic of Ireland and Bulgaria on Sunday 11 and Wednesday, Oct 14 respectively.\n\n\"Aaron Ramsey is currently unable to join the squad until after the England match,\" the Football Association of Wales posted on its Twitter account.\n\nRamsey's absence is a further blow to manager Ryan Giggs, who has become used to being without the 29-year-old former Arsenal playmaker.\n\nA succession of injuries has meant that Ramsey has started only once for Wales since the beginning of 2019, the decisive Euro 2020 qualifier when he scored both goals in the 2-0 victory over Hungary.\n\nGiggs has also lost West Brom striker Hal Robson-Kanu to injury for the October triple-header and was already without captain Gareth Bale.\n\nBale was allowed to train at Tottenham during the international break as he recovers from a knee injury picked up on Wales duty last month."
