        "text": "There cannot be too many professional footballers who would be unable to remember an FA Cup final played at the old Wembley stadium but when Aaron Ramsey explains that this time last year he was taking his GCSEs it is easy to forgive the teenager. Indeed the Cardiff City midfielder would be entitled to point out that he is more interested in making history rather than spending time reading up on it as he hopes to become the youngest player to win the FA Cup.\n\nTo put things into perspective, Ramsey was not even born when David James, Portsmouth's goalkeeper, made his debut for Watford in August, 1990. Little more than 10 years earlier Paul Allen had helped West Ham United beat Arsenal in the FA Cup final at the age of 17 years and 256 days but Ramsey, who will not turn 18 until Boxing Day, would surpass that record if he is on the winning side against Portsmouth tomorrow.\n\nThe big question is whether it will also be his last game for the club as the vultures gather. \"We don't have to sell him now,\" said Dave Jones, Cardiff's manager. \"But if Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal or Liverpool come calling and the price is right it's difficult to say to the kid, you are not going to play with [Wayne] Rooney and [Cristiano] Ronaldo. We have been very honest since we've been at the club and if it is the right deal for the club and the player then we will do it.\"\n\nCardiff are understood to be seeking about £5m for the 17-year-old - who was called into John Toshack's senior Wales squad yesterday for the first time - but that asking price would do nothing to deter the Premier League's elite given Ramsey's burgeoning reputation. Trevor Sinclair, the former England midfielder, says he has never seen anyone better at the same age and Stephen McPhail, who graduated from Leeds at the same time as Alan Smith and Jonathan Woodgate, predicts the youngster will become \"a superstar\".\n\n\"He is only 17 but when you watch him play you would think that he has been playing for years,\" said the Cardiff captain. \"He's a bit special. He can handle anything you throw at him. Whether the gaffer has played him out wide or at full-back, he has made sure that he has performed properly and has done the right things at the right time. He very rarely makes the wrong decision. He's got superb vision and weight of pass and he's very level-headed.\"\n\nThe latter is evident after only a few minutes in Ramsey's company. Indeed Rambo, his moniker, could not seem more inappropriate as he shyly recalled school days in Caerphilly. \"My parents made me do well,\" said Ramsey who passed 10 of his 11 GSCEs. \"They've always tried to drill into me the importance of getting the right results and they helped me get those. But I've always wanted to be a footballer and never thought of anything different.\"\n\nThat single-mindedness, allied to an ability to dominate games through his superb passing ability and indefatigable energy levels, prompts McPhail to draw comparisons with Steven Gerrard. Ramsey admits that the Liverpool captain is his current favourite player although he recalls that there was another hero when he was younger. \"I used to enjoy watching Roy Keane and the way he affected other players,\" said the former Cardiff trainee.\n\nWhether Ramsey remains at Ninian Park or not, he has already left an indelible mark on the club. When he came on against Hull City in April last year, aged 16 years and 123 days, he eclipsed John Toshack as the youngest player to appear for Cardiff. Ever since then Jones has sought to play down expectations although, with Sir Alex Ferguson among those following Ramsey's progress in the past six months, there is little to suggest the hype is misplaced.\n\n\"Nothing fazes him but there's an awful lot of pressure being put on the kid at this moment in time,\" said Jones. \"I've said many times, in Wales, when they have something special they drain it. We are trying to cocoon him away from that. If he's right to play [against Portsmouth] then he'll play. If he's not, then I'll do what I think is right. The one thing I do know is that he will have many more appearances in top games because he will be a top player.\"\n\nCup final prodigies\n\nIf Aaron Ramsey plays and Cardiff beat Portsmouth, he will be the youngest FA Cup winner at 17 years and 143 days, beating Paul Allen's 17 years 256 days in 1980.\n\nCesc Fábregas (18 years 17 days) was a winner in 2005 with Arsenal, as was Norman Whiteside (18 years 19 days) in 1983 with Manchester United."
