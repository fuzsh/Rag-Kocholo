        "text": "Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey will not travel to Dublin for Wales' Nations League match against the Republic of Ireland after his wife gave birth to twins.\n\nThe Football Association of Wales announced this morning that Ramsey wouldn't travel, with boss Ryan Giggs sharing the happy news in his press conference.\n\nGiggs said: \"Good news, he has had two additions to the family. Huge congratulations to Rambo.\"\n\nThe Arsenal midfielder earned his 56th international cap in the 4-1 friendly defeat to Spain last Thursday, captaining Wales in the second half.\n\nHowever, the Football Association of Wales announced he will not travel with the squad to Dublin, with Swansea winger Daniel James called up from the under-21s to take his place.\n\nThe FAW said in a tweet: \"Daniel James has been called up to the senior team from the under 21's this morning.\n\n\"Aaron Ramsey will no longer travel with the squad to Dublin due to family reasons.\"\n\nRamsey was allowed to miss Arsenal's Europa League tie against Qarabag in Azerbaijan earlier this month to stay in London with his pregnant wife.\n\nHis personal situation was addressed when manager Ryan Giggs named his 25-man squad for the double header against Spain and the Republic.\n\nGiggs said: \"We have to weigh it up and it's something for us to assess.\n\n\"Obviously we are at home for the first game. That's a plus, but we are just monitoring the situation.\"\n\nIt's the latest blow to Wales boss Ryan Giggs after Gareth Bale has returned to Real Madrid.\n\nGiggs’ star man missed Wales’ 4-1 friendly defeat to Spain and has now been ruled out of the match-up with Ireland due to muscle stiffness.\n\nHe had been expected to travel to Dublin on Monday but has decided to avoid angering Real chiefs by returning to his club side.\n\nReal bosses weren't happy as they want Bale to be fully fit for their El Clasico trip to bitter rivals Barcelona on October 28.\n\nBale trained alone with Giggs’ fitness staff over the weekend and underwent a tough session on Sunday before decided to go home to Madrid.\n\nAnd Giggs suggested after the loss to Spain at the Principality Stadium that Bale would be absent for the trip across the Irish Sea.\n\n\"Gareth is struggling for Tuesday,\" Giggs said on Thursday.\n\nBale was among the scorers when Wales beat the Republic in their first Nations League game in September, but midfielder Aaron Ramsey is not underestimating Martin O'Neill's men."
