        "text": "What good is being the best if it brings out the worst in you?\n\nYou know you're ugly when you go to the proctologist and he sticks his finger in your mouth.\n\nI want a girl just like the girl that Dad kept on the side.\n\nMy childhood was bad. No father. Mother was greedy and brought me up awful -- never made me breakfast once. I don't want to get started. One story is worse than another.\n\nThe only normal people are the ones you don't know too well.\n\nWe lived in a neighborhood that was too rich for us. When I was young, I had to deliver groceries to the homes of the kids I went to school with. I had to go to the back doors to make the deliveries. It was embarrassing. That was one thing out of a hundred.\n\nPeople seldom live up to their baby pictures.\n\nI've been writing jokes since I'm fifteen. Not out of happiness, but to go to a different place, because reality wasn't good to me.\n\nA sense of humor is rare. It isn't telling a joke about how there are three ways to get to heaven. It's being in a restaurant and hearing someone say, \"Everyone's got their tale of woe,\" and then turning around and saying, \"Unfortunately, in life, there's more woe than tail.\"\n\nI got my first break and became a singing waiter at eighteen or nineteen. I couldn't make a living at it. I quit. Then I got married and sold aluminum siding. My wife had problems physically. It was not good.\n\nNever tell your wife she's lousy in bed. She'll go out and get a second opinion.\n\nYou'll find out it's lonely at the top when there's no one on the bottom.\n\nWhen I was forty, I was getting divorced, living in a low-class, dirty hotel in New York. My mother was dying of cancer. I owed $20,000. That was about the lowest. I came back to show business, and I couldn't get a job. I was turned down by every small-time agent in New York.\n\nI started over again with an image: \"Nothing goes right.\" Then when The Godfather came out, all I heard was, \"Show respect. With me, you show respect.\" So I changed the image to \"I don't get no respect.\" I tried it out in Greenwich Village. I remember the first joke I told: \"Even as a kid, I'd play hide and seek and the other kids wouldn't even look for me.\" The people laughed. After the show, they started saying to me, \"Me, too -- I don't get no respect.\" I figured, let's try it again.\n\nWhen you walk up five flights of stairs at four in the morning, there's definitely a hooker involved.\n\nI can't figure women out. They put on makeup for three hours. They wear things that make them smaller. Things that make them bigger. Then they meet a man and they want truth.\n\nIt would be great if people never got angry at someone for doing something they've done themselves.\n\nIf sex is a pain in the ass, then you're doing it wrong.\n\nI introduced fifteen or twenty new comedians who made it big. Jerry Seinfeld, Jim Carrey, Tim Allen, Roseanne, Dice. That makes me feel good.\n\nAfter I got divorced, I said to myself, I will never, ever get married again. It was in cement. I went through a really rough twenty-five years, but it happened again. I fell in love. I told her, \"Baby, I don't want a prenuptial agreement. This is it.\" Everyone told me I was nuts. Well, my new wife and I are married six years and we get along great. You can make anything work if you're both givers.\n\nIf every man was as true to his country as he was to his wife, we'd be in a lot of trouble.\n\nTime and tide and hookers wait for no man.\n\nI recently had double-bypass surgery. As they wheel you in, the doctor always gives you a last look. You know that look. That look of confidence to make you feel good. I always say to every doctor, \"If I don't make it, I'll never know it.\"\n\nIt's great to have gray hair. Ask anyone who's bald.\n\nI've learned to control everything. I don't get angry at anything. Somebody can do me wrong. That's life. What good is it to get angry?\n\nMan, who don't like spaghetti?\n\nI am the world's oldest teenager. I've never lost my youthful attitude.\n\nIf I could have dinner with anyone who lived in the history of the world, who would it be? That depends on the restaurant.\n\nI'm a downer. I've been depressed my whole life. Figure it out.\n\nYou live with life's disappointments and learn from them. At seventy-eight, I know it all.\n\nHe who laughs last didn't get it in the first place.\n\nOriginally published in the October 2000 issue"
