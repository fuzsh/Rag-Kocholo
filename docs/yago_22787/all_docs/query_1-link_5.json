It is about a street dog named Rover, who is owned by a Las Vegas showgirl. Rover gets dumped off Hoover Dam by the showgirl's boyfriend. However, rather than drowning, Rover ends up on a farm.\n\nDirected by James L. George and Bob Seeley. Produced by Willard Carroll and Tom L. Wilhite.\n\nYou'll laugh! You'll sing! You'll dance! You'll sit up and beg for more!\n\nRover Dangerfield\n\n[edit]\n\nAll night I'd sit up and beg, she told me I was too old to beg!\n\n[after attacking one of the wolves] That one's for the three little pigs!\n\nI guess that's my trouble, no class. I looked up my family tree, two dogs were using it!\n\nHey folks! I'll never dampen your holidays! [door slams shut] No respect. No respect at all.\n\nDialogue\n\n[edit]\n\nRover Dangerfield: [about playing fetch] He throws a stick, you run and get it, you bring it back and he throws it again! I don't get it! I mean, what's the point?\n\nRaffles: Because it makes them happy and it gives them lots of exercise\n\nRover Dangerfield: If they want exercise, let them run and get it.\n\nRaffles: So what should I do?\n\nRover Dangerfield: It's very simple. You do nothing.\n\nRover Dangerfield: Where's Flappy?\n\nQueenie: Carmine fired him. He couldn't remember the routines.\n\nRover Dangerfield: Oh, I saw that coming. Flappy was dumb. Yeah, he used to walk backwards and wag his head. I mean dumb! Carmine taught him to sit, he forgot how to stand! And when Carmine paper-trained him, that was something. He went right on the paper. The only trouble is, Carmine was reading it!\n\nTurkey: Let me tell you, I won't be here very long.\n\nRover Dangerfield: I tell ya, the way I see it, you probably won't be around after Christmas!\n\nTurkey: Well, that would suit me just fine! Well, I might have known: There's absolutely nothing to eat here!\n\nRover Dangerfield: Yeah? Look in a mirror!\n\nTurkey: Oh... I don't get it.\n\nRover Dangerfield: Don't worry about it, drumstick. You will!\n\n[Rover attacks Rocky]\n\nRocky: [kicks him off] You dirty mutt!\n\nConnie: Rocky, what are you doing?\n\nRocky: I thought I was rid of you for good!\n\nConnie: 'Rid of you for good'?\n\n[Connie slaps him in the face]\n\nRocky: [furiously] What, are you taking the dog's side? Huh?\n\n[Rocky grabs Connie until Rover pushes him, Rover and the other dogs chase him out the door]\n\nConnie: Rover, NAIL HIM!\n\n[Daisy leads rover to the barn and they were coming to piles and piles of hay which had a pair of boxer shorts on top of one stack. Rover is tucking his tie and was about to kiss Daisy, but then she turned his face and made him look as the shorts seemed to move. And where this made Rover curious of what was in or under the boxer shorts. As he looked, there popped out a puppy which strongly resembled him. he heard a yip and saw another puppy that look resembled him and one pop out of the hay, another one resembled him barking underneath the bucket and there was one puppy who looked like Daisy who was teething on the hose and she look at her mother and her new father whom beams a smile]\n\nRover Dangerfield: Hey, i'm a father of five!\n\n[Another puppy then fell on Rover's face and Rover held out the final puppy in his litter]\n\nRover Dangerfield: Six!\n\n[Then the puppy speaks to him in a child-like voice]\n\nRover's Son: Hey, take it easy, I'm only a pup.\n\n[Rover hugs his son and put his paw over Daisy}\n\nRover Dangerfield: Hey, boys. Daddy's home!\n\nTaglines\n\n[edit]\n\nYou'll laugh! You'll sing! You'll dance! You'll sit up and beg for more!\n\nThe dog who gets no respect.\n\nRodney Dangerfield is Rover, a big city hound who trades bright lights for barnyard laughs!\n\nVoice cast\n\n[edit]\n\nRodney Dangerfield as Rover Dangerfield/Rover's Son\n\nSusan Boyd as Daisy\n\nRonnie Schell as Eddie\n\nNed Luke as Raffles\n\nShawn Southwick as Connie\n\nSal Landi as Rocky\n\nBert Kramer as Max\n\nRobert Pine as Duke\n\nDana Hill as Danny\n\nEddie Barth as Champ\n\nDennis Blair as Lem\n\nDon Stewart as Clem\n\nGregg Berger as Cal\n\nw:Heidi Banks as Katie\n\nPaxton Whitehead as Count\n\nChris Collins as Big Boss/Sparky/Horse\n\nChris Collins and Tom Williams as Coyotes\n\nChris Collins, Bernard Erhard and Danny Mann as Wolves\n\nRobert Bergen as Gangster / Animal\n\nTress MacNeille as Queenie / Chorus Girls / Hen / Chickens / Turkey\n\nDee Bradley Baker as Rover and Daisy's Pups\n\nAdditional voices\n\n[edit]\n\nRobert Bergen\n\nBurton Sharp\n\nLouise Chamis\n\nBill Farmer\n\nBarbara Goodson\n\nPatricia Parris\n\nRoss Taylor\n\nWikipedia has an article about:"
