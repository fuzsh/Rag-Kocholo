        "text": "“I tell ya, my family were always big drinkers. When I was a kid, I was missing. They put my picture on a bottle of Scotch.”\n\n“When I was a kid I got no respect. When my parents got divorced there was a custody fight over me... and no one showed up.”\n\n“In my life I've been through plenty. When I was three years old, my parents got a dog. I was jealous of the dog, so they got rid of me.”\n\n“I remember the time I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of my finger to my father. He said he wanted more proof.”\n\n“When I was a kid my parents moved a lot, but I always found them.”\n\n“I asked my old man if I could go ice-skating on the lake. He told me, ‘Wait til it gets warmer.’”\n\n“My mom took me to a dog show, and I won!”\n\n“My wife and I were happy for twenty years. Then we met.”\n\n“I haven't spoken to my wife in years. I didn't want to interrupt her.”\n\n“My wife's a lousy cook. After dinner, I don't brush my teeth. I count them.”\n\n\"My wife has to be the worst cook. In my house, we pray after we eat.\"\n\n“My wife’s not too smart. I told her our kids were spoiled. She said, ‘All kids smell that way.’”\n\n\"Once, somebody stole our car. I asked my wife if she saw who it was. She said, 'No, but I did get the license number.'\"\n\n\"My wife had her driver's test the other day. She got 8 out of 10. The other 2 guys jumped clear.\"\n\n“I told my psychiatrist that everyone hates me. He said I was being ridiculous, everyone hasn't met me yet.”\n\n“A girl phoned me the other day and said, 'Come on over. There's nobody home.' I went over. Nobody was home.”\n\n“I drink too much. The last time I gave a urine sample it had an olive in it.”\n\n“On Halloween, the parents send their kids out looking like me.”\n\n“I have good-looking kids. Thank goodness my wife cheats on me.”\n\n“My psychiatrist told me I was crazy and I said I want a second opinion. He said okay, you're ugly too.”\n\n\"When I was born, the doctor came out to the waiting room and said to my father, 'I'm very sorry. We did everything we could. But he pulled through.'\"\n\n“I went to a fight the other night, and a hockey game broke out.”\n\n“I told my doctor I broke my arm in two places. He told me to keep out of those places.”\n\n“I live in a tough neighborhood. They got a children's zoo. Last week, four kids escaped.”\n\n“My doctor told me to watch my drinking. Now I drink in front of a mirror.”\n\n“Once on my birthday my ol' man gave me a bat. The first day I played with it, it flew away.”\n\n“Marriage … it's not a word, it's a sentence.”"
