        "text": "“My mother made the mistake of moving into a neighborhood that was rather well-to-do — Kew Gardens — ’cause her sisters lived there. But we never belonged there. We were living above a store, and I delivered orders after school. I’d be going to school with these kids, and after school I’d be delivering orders to their houses, you know what I mean? Also, in those days I experienced quite a bit of anti-Semitism in school, even among the teachers. And the fact that I came from a split home. All in all, I felt on the outside. Like, Christmas to me meant delivering trees to make some money.” Telling his story, Rodney sounds weary, but no more than usual. There’s no self-pity as he looks back. Just the facts.\n\nAt age fifteen, Jacob began writing jokes, “maybe because of depression. You wanna escape into unreality.” At nineteen, he adopted the stage name Jack Roy — Roy having been his father’s vaudeville handle — and landed his initial job, in the Catskill Mountains, first home-away-from-home for many great comics. Jack got the job by scraping up twelve dollars to pay the agent’s commission in advance, and he worked ten weeks at twelve dollars a week plus room and board. With his act — jokes, bits of burlesque, even a few songs — somewhat polished, he returned home to look for club work. All he found was a job as a waiter at the Polish Falcon in Brooklyn for five dollars a night. He realized that some waiters doubled or tripled their income by doing a singing stint onstage with a piano and drums.\n\n“So I go to the entertaining-waiters association to join the union. ‘No work, get out, can’t join the union.’ I have my last three bucks. I say, ‘Look, here’s for Christmas,’ and I beg him to put me in the union.” Rodney shakes his head. “You’re always begging your whole goddamn life. You wonder why certain people can become comedians. They’re used to humiliation.” He continues: “So I got in the union. I was a singing waiter.”\n\nJack Roy scratched out jobs here and there, getting paid with eight quarters for one gig in Newark, New Jersey. He still lived at home, and would until he was twenty-eight, when he got married. Till then, “I worked, did okay. I was adequate.” Joe Ancis remembers: “He always wrote beautiful stuff–good, solid comedic lines, good concepts, but it lacked a character.”\n\nRodney says he quit because he was tired of traveling and the pressures of showbiz, and because he wanted “a normal life.” He was, he says, “looking for love.” His wife, Joyce, was a singer, and she also gave up showbiz for normalcy. But, says Dangerfield, “I later learned it wasn’t show business that was crazy, it was me.”\n\n“Last week, I broke up with my psychiatrist. He told me I was going crazy. I said to him, ‘If you don’t mind, I’d like a second opinion.’ He said, ‘All right, you’re ugly too.'”\n\nEditor’s picks\n\nEven while he was away from showbiz, Rodney was “always writing jokes. Writing, writing, writing.” He sold his gags to such comics as Joan Rivers and Jackie Mason, but he knew he should have been doing them himself.\n\nIn his earlier stab at it, the woe-is-me jokes never quite fit him. Now, at forty, he was beginning to look the part. While in the siding business, he came up with the line: “The trouble with me is, I appeal to everyone who can do me absolutely no good.” As he reeled through a tumultuous marriage, he could say that line — and many others like it — with authority.\n\nHis marriage, he says, “was a real mixed-up affair. I divorced the same girl twice: got married, divorced, married, divorced — one of those numbers. I was very much down at the time.”\n\nJack Roy was booked into a Brooklyn club he’d worked in the early days. To avoid embarrassment, he asked the owner, George McFadden, to advertise him under another name. “He came up with Rodney Dangerfield,” says Rodney. “I don’t know where it came from.” (Most likely from the J.P. Donleavy novel The Ginger Man, which features a character named Sebastian Dangerfield.) Still, some of his old friends heard who “Rodney” was and caught his act.\n\n“They said, ‘Rodney Dangerfield?’ I said, ‘If you’re gonna change your name, change it.’ A friend of mine said, ‘Why don’t you keep it?’ So I said, ‘Yeah, what the heck. I’m depressed enough to go crazy, so I’ll call myself Rodney Dangerfield.'”\n\nTrying to relaunch his career, Rodney found himself begging again. In 1967, he asked his agents to get him an audition for The Ed Sullivan Show. As soon as he heard Rodney, Sullivan booked him for six shows. Other TV appearances followed, and later that year, he recorded his first album, The Loser.\n\n“I found myself starting to pack places,” he says. No respect caught on fast. “Jack Benny mentioned to me that it was the greatest image he had ever heard of. Everyone gets no respect.” In 1968, Rodney put out another album, I Don’t Get No Respect. By this time, he was a father of two and, on and off, a husband. To stay close to his family, and defying all advice and odds, he opened his own nightclub in 1969."
