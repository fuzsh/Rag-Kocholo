        "text": "One day, though, I decided to change my act - I wanted to stop doing my impressions and start being myself onstage. Well, things got pretty weird for a while after that. And by 'weird' I mean that I was bombing night after night. But I stuck with it, mainly because I could always hear Rodney laughing in the wings. After a show, he'd say to me, 'Man, those people were lookin' at you like you were from another planet!' But I was making him laugh, so I knew I was onto something. A lot of comedians even a star as big as Rodney Dangerfield, would have dumped an opening act that wasn't making his audience laugh, but Rodney stood by me, told me to keep on doing what I was doing.\n\nSt. Peter: Can you tell me, uh.. how was your childhood?\n\nRodney Dangerfield: Oh, I tell ya’, I had a rough childhood, alright? When I was a kid, my parents moved a lot – but I always found ’em. I’ll tell ya’, I got no respect as a kid. I worked in a pet store; people kept asking how big I would get!\n\nSt. Peter: Did you have any pets?\n\nRodney Dangerfield: I had a dog. Apparently, his favorite bone was in my arm!\n\nSt. Peter: How was your luck with the ladies?\n\nRodney Dangerfield: I had no luck with women, alright? I went to my doctor; you know my doctor – Dr. Bid a Boom Ba. Yeah, I told him I think my wife has VD, he gave himself a penicillin shot!\n\nSt. Peter: Were you married?\n\nRodney Dangerfield: Yeah, but I haven’t spoken to my wife in years – I didn’t want to interrupt her!\n\nSt. Peter: Was she a good cook?\n\nRodney Dangerfield: She can’t cook! She’s the worst cook in the world, alright? The other night, she fixed alphabet soup – it spelled out 'Help!' Are you kidding? What a lousy cook! I mean, how can toast have bones?\n\nSt. Peter: Was your wife an intelligent woman?\n\nRodney Dangerfield: Are you kidding? My wife’s not smart, you know? She used to reach inside her bra to count to two.\n\nSt. Peter: Rodney, how was your sex life?\n\nRodney Dangerfield: I got no sex life! The only time my wife makes love to me, there’s always a reason for it! Now, one night she used me to time an egg. I’ll tell ya’, that’s the story of my life – I get no respect! I get no respect at all, alright? So, whattaya say, St. Peter, do I get in or what?\n\nSt. Peter: Of course, you do.\n\nRodney Dangerfield: Then, what’s with all the questions?\n\nSt. Peter: [ solemnly ] I just wanted to hear those jokes one more time.\n\nRodney Dangerfield: Finally! A little respect!\n\nSt. Peter: Come on in."
