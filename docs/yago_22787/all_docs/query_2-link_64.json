I'm Terry Gross.\n\nBefore making his formal announcement this morning that John Edwards would be\n\nhis vice presidential running mate, John Kerry e-mailed his decision to over\n\none million subscribers to his Web site, an unprecedented use of the Internet.\n\nWe're going to talk about the Internet and politics with Joe Trippi. He\n\npioneered the use of the Internet in presidential politics when he managed\n\nHoward Dean's primary campaign last year. Trippi was widely credited with\n\nhelping Dean transform himself into a front-runner. Trippi had previously\n\nworked on the presidential campaigns of Ted Kennedy, Walter Mondale, Gary Hart\n\nand Richard Gephardt. Now he's written a book called \"The Revolution Will Not\n\nBe Televised: Democracy, the Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything.\" I\n\nspoke with him last Thursday.\n\nBefore you had managed the Dean campaign, you'd basically sworn off\n\npresidential politics. Why did you swear off presidential politics?\n\nMr. JOE TRIPPI (Author, \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised\"): It's the\n\ntoughest thing that you can do. It's a draining experience. It's physically\n\nnearly impossible to get through a presidential. And what happens when you do\n\none is you're absolutely convinced it's the greatest thing you've ever been a\n\npart of, and you're absolutely convinced that you will never, ever, let\n\nyourself do it again. And so in 1980, I did it; I did it in '84; I did it in\n\n'88. And in '88, I really swore off and actually stayed out for 15 years,\n\nkept my promise to myself for 15 years. I don't see myself doing another\n\none--hopefully I can keep that one--for at least over 15, and if I do that, I\n\nwon't be doing another one. You know, they're just really taxing.\n\nGROSS: Yeah. So why did you decide to work on the Dean campaign?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Well, I didn't want to. It was one of these things--I really did\n\nnot want to run another presidential or be part of one. But again, because it\n\njust--you don't really believe you're going to live through it if you've been\n\nthrough one. But I fell in love with him. I went out to Iowa on one trip\n\nwith him. For the first time in 30 or 40 years, I heard a person running for\n\npresident of the United States actually talking about our responsibility as\n\ncitizens to each other and not for ourselves, talking about how the greatest\n\ncountry on this planet should be able to provide health care to every one of\n\nhis citizens, and he meant it, and he had done it in Vermont. And I just was\n\nin that room in that house in Iowa, and I was screaming at myself to get out\n\nof there. If I stayed and listened to him any longer, I'd end up doing his\n\ncampaign.\n\nAnd, well, that side of me won out and I ended up going up to Burlington and,\n\nI think, really starting something with Governor Dean that was one of the\n\ngreatest campaigns, I think, in the last 30 or 40 years, all those people out\n\nthere that came, that got the message and understood they could make a\n\ndifference.\n\nGROSS: So what was the size of the Dean campaign when you took it over?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Oh, we had about six or seven people. We had less than $100,000\n\nin the bank. When I first got up there, we were trying to--it was impossible,\n\nnearly impossible to scrape enough money to pay for his next airline ticket to\n\nIowa for him. And we had 432 supporters nationwide. It wasn't anything that\n\nyou thought, you know, on paper was going to become much of anything. And we\n\nhad almost no money or resources even to dig ourself out of the hole we were\n\nin.\n\nGROSS: Now of course, you thought of using the Internet, really using the\n\nInternet, to help gain financial and voting support for Dean. What was your\n\ninitial idea of how the Internet could be used for the campaign?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Well...\n\nGROSS: And I should mention here that you'd worked for high-tech businesses,\n\nso you had some experience with the Net.\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Well, I had, back in the late '90s, visited, spent a lot of time\n\non bulletin boards on the Web as just a private citizen as well. And one of\n\nthe things that happened was I was on this bulletin board of a company named\n\nTHQ that made games for PlayStations and Game Boys and Xboxs(ph), of all\n\nthings. And there was a guy named David Hanes(ph) on that board who was just\n\nan ordinary citizen. He was very smart. He'd post things. But he also--we\n\nall learned something about each other. He would post things like, `Guys, I'm\n\nsorry I haven't posted for four or five days, but my wife just gave birth to\n\nour baby son Christian.' And later on, he'd tell you how the games were bad,\n\nbut, `Hey, Christian walked today.' And you learned that he had a dog named\n\nBruin(ph) and that he was a triathlete, amateur triathlete who lost every race\n\nhe ever ran in. And you really got to know him as a person.\n\nAnd then one day, someone came on that bulletin board and said, `I have tragic\n\nnews. David Hanes died of a massive heart attack today at age 31, leaving his\n\nbaby Christian'--I think who was then about 18 months old. And what I saw\n\nhappen was this funeral on the Internet. Citizens from all over the country\n\nwho barely--didn't know this guy, had never met him, but knew everything about\n\nhim, started eulogizing him. And then we tried to start an education fund for\n\nhis son.\n\nAnd I remember distinctly thinking, gosh, if you could build a community like\n\nthis--we don't do these things today for our next-door neighbor or the\n\nperson--too many of us don't--or the person five blocks away in our own\n\nneighborhoods, but here was this community that was built around, of all\n\nthings, a PlayStation game maker. And I thought, what--that was the first\n\ntime I thought, wow, what could happen if you used that same kind of community\n\nbuilding on the Internet for a presidential campaign or to strengthen our\n\ndemocracy or to get people involved in actually changing the country? And\n\nthat's what we set out to do in the Dean campaign.\n\nAnd the American people now really have a tool that can let them connect with\n\neach other in really dynamic and energetic ways and really--those of us who\n\nwant to change the country--and I believe most Americans believe they really\n\ndeep down want to make a difference; they just don't believe they can. But\n\nnow we have the tools to do it.\n\nGROSS: Well, one of the things you did in the campaign was, through a Web\n\nsite called Meetup.com, you had Dean supporters being able to communicate\n\nwith each other. Would you explain how you used this Web site for the\n\ncampaign?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Meetup.com is a Web site that allows people to come together,\n\ndiscuss their hobbies, different interests, and then meet each other offline.\n\nAnd we had looked at that site and realized that we had to decentralize the\n\ncampaign; we had to give people a place to go meet. We didn't have campaign\n\noffices in 50 states. And so we got people to sign up at Meetup.com, sign up\n\nas Dean supporters, and then meet on the first Wednesday of every month. We\n\nstarted out with really a couple thousand people, and by the end of the\n\ncampaign, we had 190,000 Americans meeting together in their own communities\n\non the first Wednesday of every month. They gather there; they decide what\n\nthey were going to do, what precincts they were going to leaflet, what\n\ndifferent campaign things they were going to do over the next 30 days. And\n\nthen they'd come up and come back the next first Wednesday and meet up again\n\nand do it all over again. And it was really an astounding thing.\n\nI think it was one of the breakthroughs of the Internet this year is that we\n\nnow--MoveOn.org and the Dean campaign in particular prove that you can use the\n\nInternet to get thousands and thousands of people to do things, not on the\n\nInternet, but in their own communities.\n\nGROSS: Now you organized a campaign blog when you were managing Dean's\n\ncampaign. What did you want the blog to accomplish?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Well it was...\n\nGROSS: And why don't you explain what a blog is, for any of our listeners\n\nthat don't know what a blog is.\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Well, first of all, the real word for it is `Weblog.' It's sort\n\nof a journal that's kept by usually an individual who, you know, just\n\nbasically talks about issues or things that interest him, and other people who\n\nhave that same interest start reading that blog, which is short for Weblog.\n\nWe started the first--it was the first blog in presidential campaign history.\n\nIt was called the Call to Action blog. It was ugly and messy and really\n\ndifficult to navigate, but we were doing things that no one else had ever done\n\nbefore.\n\nIt would eventually turn into the Blog for America, which was the BMW of\n\nblogs. It was really interactive. You could get comments from your\n\nsupporters, ideas from them. And a lot of the great ideas of the campaign\n\nactually came from our own supporters communicating to us on the blog and\n\ngiving us great ideas that really helped get the campaign off the ground.\n\nOne of the simple things was we had signs up on our site, you know, Iowans\n\nfor--`Iowa for Dean,' `Another New Hampshire voter for Dean'--that people\n\ncould download. We put up all 50 states. And the first mention on the blog\n\nwas, `Hey, you forgot Puerto Rico. You screwed up.' And we immediately, you\n\nknow, realized that, yeah, Puerto Rico votes for Democratic nominations, so we\n\nput up a `Puerto Rico for Dean' sign within a minute or two and got a protest\n\nfrom a guy in London saying that he was an American abroad who was going to\n\nvote in the presidential and we didn't have an `Americans abroad for Dean'\n\nsign. So we put that up immediately, and the thank-you came from Spain. All\n\nthis happened in a 10-minute part of time that was an amazing exchange between\n\nus and our supporters, and they saw the mistakes we made and we plugged them.\n\nAnd that same thing in any other presidential election I'd been involved in\n\nwould have probably taken three or four months. I mean, no one in Puerto Rico\n\nwould even know that there were signs, and the people in California would have\n\nto try to figure out where the LA headquarters was, and they'd have to get in\n\ntheir car to go get them. And so in a lot of ways, the blogs made us a lot\n\nstronger, a lot smarter. And that was a small thing, but some of them were\n\nreally huge events, ideas that really made the campaign take off.\n\nGROSS: Now there are ways to subvert the Internet; there are ways to use\n\ndirty tricks in e-mail and on the Internet. Did you feel that your blog or\n\nthat your e-mail campaigns were undermined at any point through dirty tricks?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Yeah, but I don't--you know, back in the old days when Thomas\n\nJefferson was running for president, it was difficult to go negative on the\n\nguy. You know, how do you say `too soft on crime' or `has no leadership' to\n\nattack the guy who wrote the Declaration of Independence? It's kind of tough\n\nto do. So John Adams got a bunch of guys on horseback and they ran around the\n\nstates saying that Jefferson was dead, which was kind of hard to disprove back\n\nthen. You couldn't hold a newspaper up with the date on it and a picture of\n\nJefferson and get that around. They just had to get guys on horseback on\n\nJefferson's side running around screaming, `He's alive, he's alive,' try to\n\ndisprove a negative, which is often tough to do.\n\nSo we've had those kind of tactics since the very early days of the republic.\n\nIt's nothing new. On the Net, it is out there. I mean, we had an e-mail go\n\nout--somebody sent an e-mail out from `Dean for Americas' with an S, not `Dean\n\nfor America,' but you had to look real close, signed it with my name and sent\n\nit out to hundreds of thousands of people with me saying that we needed\n\nvolunteers, but please don't volunteer if you're gay because in all of our\n\nstates there's--bunking quarters are close, or something like that. And this\n\nthing took--it really did take on a life of its own, to the point where Iowa\n\nTV stations were running that I'd sent this out. I literally had to go on the\n\nair in Iowa, you know, and say I didn't send it out. Here's a guy, a\n\ncandidate who signed the civil unions bill for gay and lesbian couples, giving\n\nthem the most basic rights, and the only state to have done it at that point.\n\nAnd this e-mail's floating around there, it was just totally fabricated, and\n\nthe antithesis of what the campaign was about.\n\nSo those kinds of things happened, but again, with the Internet, you've\n\ngot--and immediately you can go right on--you know, right back out and say\n\nit's not true, at least, in a way that you might have a chance of convincing\n\npeople. I think the negativism that was there in the early days of the\n\nrepublic was a lot tougher on horseback to fight.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Joe Trippi. He managed Howard Dean's presidential primary\n\ncampaign. Trippi has written a new book about politics and the Internet.\n\nWe'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: If you're just joining us, my guest is Joe Trippi, and he was the\n\ncampaign manager for Howard Dean's presidential primary race. And he's\n\nwritten a new book called \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Democracy,\n\nThe Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything.\"\n\nI want to ask you about the so-called `I have a scream' speech which Howard\n\nDean gave after the Iowan caucuses. And, you know, he named, you know, in a\n\nloud voice, in a crowded room, the states that he hoped to win in. And this\n\nwas played over and over and over again on the TV news and was used kind of as\n\na symbol of Howard Dean uncorking, losing his cool. It's this--what does this\n\ntell us about his character? I looked for `I have a scream' in your index;\n\nyou refer to this in your index as `Iowa concession speech.' So what was that\n\nwhole episode like for you? And actually, let me start with this. Since\n\nyou've been talking so much about the importance of the Internet, if you look\n\nat--if you Google `I have a scream' and Howard Dean, what you come up with\n\nfirst is a lot of remixes.\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Right.\n\nGROSS: There were a lot of people who took the `I have a scream' speech and\n\nremixed it and put it on their Web site. Was that a good thing or a bad\n\nthing?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Well, you live by the Internet and you pay the price with--we had\n\na lot of Dean mixes of great speeches that happened early on. In fact, the\n\nDNC speech that just sort of launched his candidacy from, I think, March of\n\n2003 was remixed over and over again and really spread all over the Net and\n\nhelped get us off the ground. So I think, you know, the remixes that are kind\n\nof fun--and you know, I listened to both of them, and a lot of them were\n\ngreat. But I think what happened there is--I mean, that room was 3,000\n\npeople, easy, going out of their minds, you know, really screaming and\n\nhollering and applauding and cheering, and he was just trying to get heard--I\n\nmean, he was trying to--if you look at the real tapes of the thing from behind\n\nand the crowd, not the ones you saw on television, it's just a guy rallying\n\nhis troops and doing it loudly because he couldn't hear himself. I mean, you\n\ncould not hear yourself in that room.\n\nThe most amazing thing to me, having been involved in Gary Hart's campaign in\n\n1988--you know, there's something wrong going on here when a guy like Gary\n\nHart who understood the threat of terrorism in 1988 was campaigning, saying\n\nthat we had to retool our military, had to make it leaner, more agile, that\n\nthe Soviet Union was no longer a threat, that the threat was terrorists and\n\nunstable Third World states, and, you know, we all got caught up in this\n\npersonal life stuff. And there was a mistake in judgment there on his part.\n\nBut we relegated him to the back benches because of, you know, a mistake he\n\nmade in 1988. You know, you look at that and you look at 2003 and you look at\n\npost-September 11th, 2001, and you wonder who made the bigger mistake, Gary\n\nHart or all the sort of gossipy press stuff that destroyed him. And now\n\nwe're to the point...\n\nGROSS: The mistake you're referring to is his...\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Is the Donna Rice...\n\nGROSS: ...affair with Donna Rice.\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Donna Rice.\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. TRIPPI: But now we're getting to the point where--this is where I--you\n\nknow, I'm not apologizing for Gary Hart; I'm just posing the question. But\n\nthen you have to ask yourself, what have we come to when we now run a guy out\n\nof the race because he actually shows emotion? I mean, he\n\nactually--'cause--Why?--'cause he yells at his concession speech? That's why\n\nwe roll him off the stage? And even in 1988, the press was more interested in\n\ntailing Gary Hart than tailing his stands on changing the military to prevent\n\nfuture terrorist attacks. This guy knew more in 1988 about terrorism than any\n\nother person--than most of the guys running today.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Joe Trippi. He managed Howard Dean's presidential primary\n\ncampaign and has written a new book about using the Internet in politics.\n\nLet's hear one of the `I have a scream' remixes from the Internet. This one\n\nis mixed with the Outkast hit \"Hey Ya!\" We'll start with the actual soundbite\n\nfrom Dean's Iowa concession speech.\n\nDr. HOWARD DEAN (Former Governor, Vermont; Democratic Presidential Candidate):\n\n(From 2003) We're going to California and Texas and New York. And we're going\n\nto South Dakota and to Oregon and Washington and Michigan. And then we're\n\ngoing to Washington, DC, to take back the White House! (Screams)\n\n(Soundbite of \"Hey Ya!\" remixed with Dean speech)\n\nBackup Singers: Hey ya.\n\nDr. DEAN: (Screams)\n\nBackup Singers: Hey ya.\n\nDr. DEAN: (Screams) And then we're going to Washington, DC. (Screams) We're\n\ngoing to California. (Screams) And Washington and Michigan and Washington.\n\n(Screams) And South Dakota and Oregon and then (Screams) then--and then--and\n\nthen we're going to California. (Screams) And then we're going to Washington,\n\nDC. (Screams)\n\nGROSS: So what was your approach to doing damage control after the `I have a\n\nscream' thing?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Well, I mean, from my point of view, we were pretty terminal\n\nbefore that speech ever happened. I mean, that speech just meant that it was\n\ngoing to be very difficult to ever get back, although I had my doubts about\n\nthat anyway. And we had taken such a pounding in Iowa that, you know, I\n\nreally--I think we make too much of that speech today. I don't think it was\n\nthe last straw or anything. But in terms of damage control, I mean, we did\n\neverything we could do. I mean, we went on Letterman's show and made fun of\n\nourselves on the Top Ten list. We, you know, did the Diane Sawyer interview\n\non ABC with Governor and Judy Dean, his wife, you know, and I think they did\n\ngreat. And he did very well in a debate in that period, too, where we were\n\nall trying to push back on this.\n\nBut the problem, you know, is that we were shooting single bullets, you know,\n\none at a time. We were shooting and rolling, shooting and rolling, shooting\n\nand rolling, and the entire national media was out there with Uzis and--with\n\nthat tape, I mean, of the speech in Iowa, just literally machine-gunning us.\n\nAnd so, you know, shooting and rolling wasn't doing any good.\n\nGROSS: Joe Trippi managed Howard Dean's presidential primary campaign.\n\nTrippi's new book is called \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised: Democracy,\n\nthe Internet, and the Overthrow of Everything.\" He'll be back in the second\n\nhalf of the show. I'm Terry Gross, and this is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\n(Soundbite of applause)\n\nGROSS: Coming up, Rodney Dangerfield. He has a new memoir called \"It's Not\n\nEasy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs.\" And we\n\ncontinue our conversation with Joe Trippi, who worked as Howard Dean's\n\ncampaign manager.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: This is FRESH AIR. I'm Terry Gross back with more of the interview I\n\nrecorded last week with Joe Trippi. He managed Howard Dean's presidential\n\nprimary campaign and used the Internet to mobilize voters, raise money and\n\ntransform Dean into a front-runner. Trippi has written a new book about the\n\nInternet and politics called \"The Revolution Will Not Be Televised.\" Trippi\n\nleft Dean's campaign last January.\n\nNow Howard Dean hired Roy Neel to run the campaign after--how long had you\n\nbeen managing it at that point?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: I think about 13 months.\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm. Then you left the campaign. Now Neel had worked with Al\n\nGore. Gore had endorsed Dean in the primary. One school of thought says that\n\nthis was all bad for Dean because it made him seem more establishment and less\n\nlike the insurgent candidate. You're a partisan here, but would you agree\n\nwith that?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: No, I think Gore didn't hurt because it was an establishment\n\nendorsement. Gore hurt because the day he endorsed us, it meant all the\n\nother campaigns--all of them in unison--decided they had to destroy Howard\n\nDean. And I think the national press corps didn't say `destroy Howard Dean.'\n\nThey just said, `Oh, my gosh, this guy's going to be the nominee, and we have\n\na responsibility to ask him the tough questions and test his mettle,' which\n\nthe press does have that responsibility.\n\nAnd I think those two forces--there was no conspiracy, but those two forces\n\ncombined and a third thing, I think, which needs to be said--we were many,\n\nmany things. One of the things we were essentially was, you know, an amateur\n\nbaseball team playing in the majors. And I don't mean that in any disrespect\n\nto anybody, but the governor had never run for office before, really. He'd\n\nbecome governor when the sitting governor, Snelling, passed away of a heart\n\nattack, so he didn't run for governor. The first time he ran for re-election,\n\nno one real ran against him. And then, a testament to his governing, he\n\nreally did get health care for those kids; he really did get prescription drug\n\nbenefits for those seniors; lowered the income tax twice. No one real ever\n\nran against him. He essentially ran against Bozo the Clown for governor every\n\nyear that he was re-elected.\n\nSo you have both of those forces moving in on us and Governor Dean who is in\n\nthe first real campaign of his life. And it's not for Congress, it's not for\n\ngovernor; it's for president of the United States. And he, me and others in\n\nthe campaign made some rookie mistakes there the last three or four weeks that\n\nwere not anybody's fault. It's not his fault that he was such a good governor\n\nhe never had a tough race.\n\nGROSS: What mistake, in retrospect, do you think you've made?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Oh, I made lots. I mean, the biggest one, it was--gosh, I was on\n\n\"Crossfire\" with Paul Begala and Tucker Carlson about four days before Iowa.\n\nAnd our momentum's slowing down; we cannot have a mistake right then. I\n\nhadn't made a mistake with the press up to that point, not a real bad\n\none--luckily because it's only luck that you can get through 13 months without\n\nblowing yourself up at least once. And I blew myself up and the campaign up a\n\nlittle bit four days before Iowa when Tucker Carlson, I think, turned to me\n\nand said, `Jeez, you've got all these congressional endorsements, you've got\n\nGore, you've got Tom Harkin. Who's next? Jimmy Carter?' And I knew that we\n\nwere meeting with Jimmy Carter in Plains, Georgia, on Sunday, so I said, `Tune\n\nin Sunday and find out.' Well, I also knew Carter wasn't going to endorse us.\n\nIt was a jokey quip.\n\nThe next thing that happened, CNN and the entire news media goes into `Dean to\n\nbe endorsed by Carter on Sunday.' Carter's going to great lengths to say, `I\n\ndidn't invite Dean down here, and I'm not going to endorse him.' So here we\n\nare, you know, four days before Iowa, and now I've launched a controversy\n\nabout whether Carter's endorsing us, whether we're trying to pull a fast one.\n\nAll for what was going to be an innocent stop to go to church with Jimmy\n\nCarter in Plains, Georgia, suddenly turned out to be, you know, a terrible hit\n\nfor the campaign. I did that.\n\nYou know, there were others. I'm not--you know, my point of view of this\n\nthing is that a presidential campaign is really tough. We had a lot of great\n\npeople. Most of them came on their own, drove up from Utah or Alabama, kids\n\nwho'd never worked on a campaign before who were suddenly running huge chunks\n\nof the country because of their energy. We couldn't get the A team of\n\nDemocratic Party politics to come work for Howard Dean. They thought we were\n\nridiculous. They thought he had no chance. They weren't going to waste their\n\ntime or their careers on him. And so we had this great, amazing campaign of\n\namateurs, essentially, who ran circles around the New York Yankees, the Los\n\nAngeles Dodgers and the Red Sox for 13 months.\n\nGROSS: One last question: At the beginning of the interview you said that\n\nyou went to work for Howard Dean, even though you'd sworn off presidential\n\npolitics, because you love him. You still love him. I mean, he replaced you\n\nwith somebody else. He lost. You still love him.\n\nMr. TRIPPI: I think Howard Dean showed more courage than just about any\n\npolitician I can think of throughout that campaign. He was against that war\n\nwhen 80 percent of the American people were for it. This guy stuck his chin\n\nout and changed this party and helped change the country. I'm happy that he\n\nlet me have any opportunity to be a part of it. I'm proud of what I did.\n\nI'm proud of continuing my fight. He had every right to make the changes in\n\nhis campaign; it was his campaign.\n\nGROSS: One last question: What is the greatest way that you think the Dean\n\ncampaign changed the Democratic Party?\n\nMr. TRIPPI: I think the party didn't think it could beat Bush. It just was\n\nso afraid of taking Bush on. They were so afraid of him. They were afraid of\n\nhis favorability ratings. They were afraid of the war president; that many of\n\nthem voted for the war out of fear, not out of conscience. I think many of\n\nthem support--he had 99 senators support the Patriot Act. Only one, Russ\n\nFeingold, had the bald guts to say, `No, I'm not supporting this thing. It's\n\ntaking America's citizens' rights away.'\n\nAnd, you know, Dean was the first guy to come along and say, `What the hell is\n\ngoing on here? What's gone on with the--where did the principles of this\n\nparty go?' And he called the party out on it, and the grassroots said, `Yeah,\n\nfinally. Finally someone's speaking the truth.' And what happened was\n\ncongressmen out there, other senators, most of the candidates, including John\n\nKerry, started to move towards Dean's positions at least in rhetoric if they\n\ncouldn't change their votes. But I think it really woke up the party and woke\n\nup an energy and activism in this country that's so sorely needed if we're\n\nreally going to change the system.\n\nGROSS: Well, Joe Trippi, thanks so much for talking with us.\n\nMr. TRIPPI: Thank you. It's great to be here.\n\nGROSS: Joe Trippi's new book is called \"The Revolution Will Not Be\n\nTelevised.\"\n\nComing up, we give Rodney Dangerfield some respect. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n* * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * * *\n\nInterview: Rodney Dangerfield discusses his career and new book,\n\n\"It's Not Easy Bein' Me\"\n\nTERRY GROSS, host:\n\nMy guest Rodney Dangerfield created his comic persona around his signature\n\nline.\n\nMr. RODNEY DANGERFIELD: One of my problems--you know, I don't get no respect,\n\nno respect at all.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Every time I get in an elevator, the operator says the same\n\nthing to me: `Basement.'\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: I get no respect. The other day I was standing in front of\n\na big apartment house. The doorman asked me to get him a cab.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Same thing with my friends. No respect. My friends tell me\n\nwhen I call on the phone I should use a certain signal. I have to let it\n\nring twice, hang up and don't call back.\n\nGROSS: At the age of 82, Rodney Dangerfield is still complaining about\n\nrespect. But in reality he's revered by many younger comics, not only for his\n\nstand-up comedy but for his performances in such movies as \"Caddyshack,\" \"Back\n\nto School\" and \"Natural Born Killers.\" Jim Carrey wrote the introduction for\n\nDangerfield's new autobiography, \"It's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No\n\nRespect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs.\"\n\nAlthough Dangerfield hopes to perform again, he's had some pretty major health\n\nproblems in the past few years, including heart-bypass surgery, a heart attack\n\nand surgery to bypass clogged arteries in his brain. He came to a studio in\n\nNew York to record our interview.\n\nRodney Dangerfield, welcome to FRESH AIR. Now I gotta ask you, you know, your\n\ncomedy is built around your most famous line, `I don't get no respect.' And\n\nyou've said that \"The Godfather\" inspired you to come up with it. How did it\n\ncome to you? Did you think of it the first time you saw \"The Godfather\"\n\nmovie? Like, how did it actually...\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Maybe not the first time...\n\nGROSS: Yeah.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: ...but I heard the word `respect.' When \"The Godfather\"\n\ncame out, all you hear was, `She's with me. Show her respect.' `I want\n\nrespect. I'm with him.' `OK. Don't know respect? Respect--you're out of\n\nyour mind, you know? Respect.' So I wrote a joke about respect and see what\n\nthe reaction would be. It's the first joke I wrote. I was working in a place\n\ncalled Upstairs at the Duplex in Greenwich Village. And I told the joke, and\n\nI says--the first time I said ...(unintelligible) `I don't get no respect.' I\n\nsaid, `When I was a kid, they played hide-and-seek. They wouldn't even look\n\nfor me, you know?' And that was the first joke I wrote, and that was the--and\n\nthe audience came over to me afterwards and said, `Hey, me, too, Rodney, no\n\nrespect.' `Me, too, Rodney, no respect.' And all of a sudden I found an image,\n\nyou know? And it's been good for me (laughs). I mean, I've written probably\n\nover 500 `no respect' jokes and all in that `no respect' theme, you know?\n\nGROSS: Now you started doing the `respect' stuff when you came back to show\n\nbusiness...\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...at around the age of 40. You had left show business for around 12\n\nyears. You had a family; you needed to make money to support your family...\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Right.\n\nGROSS: ...you went into the aluminum siding business for a while.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Right.\n\nGROSS: What was your act like the first time around?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: When I quit show business--you have any idea how well I was\n\ndoing at the time I quit? I was the only one who knew I quit.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: What was your act like back then when you were in your 20s?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Oh, well, this is a--I was immature and young. I came back\n\nat 40, I had an image ...(unintelligible) that was it. My act was more of\n\na--immature material, I guess. I'd show a fellow driving a car and coming out\n\nwith his girl, or a fellow goes to a dance, he looks over at the girls and\n\nmakes remarks, you know, something like that.\n\nGROSS: And you did impressions when you were in your 20s, didn't you?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yes. When I was young, I did impressions. I did W.C.\n\nFields and Al Jolson. Amateur night, so I was working, you know? But I did\n\nimpressions, only those two. I did a Chinese act, \"On Too Long.\"\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: And you sang, too, right?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yes, I sang. I sang Jolson; I did his numbers. In fact, I\n\nonce did a show with Al Jolson. I was a kid, 21, in Atlantic City, and he was\n\ndoing a benefit show there and asked me to go on, do five minutes before him\n\nto warm up the audience. I said, `OK.' So...\n\nGROSS: Now when you started performing, you didn't use the name Rodney\n\nDangerfield. That was a name...\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: My legal name is Jack Roy, R-O-Y. And I started\n\nperforming, and that was the name I used the first time in my career. When I\n\ncame back the second time, then I became Rodney Dangerfield. And with a name\n\nlike that, if you don't hit, you're an idiot, you know. So I'm...\n\nGROSS: Now I know it was an emcee who gave you the name Rodney Dangerfield,\n\nright?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: It was the owner of a club up in Inwood, New York, Inwood\n\nLounge, you know. And at that time I was just coming back to show business.\n\nI don't know how good I am or this or that, so I asked him not to put my name\n\nin the paper; to make up some other phony name of some kind. He did that, and\n\nhe put in the paper Rodney Dangerfield. So I walked out in the club. It was\n\nthe same people after 15 years ago that heard I was working, and they came\n\nback. And so they yelled out to me when I walked on. They said, `Rodney\n\nDangerfield?' I said, `Look, if you're going to change your name, change it.'\n\nGROSS: Now you were born with the last name of Roy, but Roy was actually your\n\nfather's stage name.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: That's right.\n\nGROSS: His birth name was Cohen.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: His first name was Phil, Philip. Philip Cohen is his legal\n\nname, but he became Roy and Arthur. Arthur was my uncle, and they did a\n\nvaudeville act, you know--comedy vaudeville act. That was...\n\nGROSS: What was the act like?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: They would break plates. They would throw plates into the\n\ntheater like a boomerang, and it would swing over the people's heads and come\n\nback to the stage. That was quite a feat to do it, but they did that mostly\n\nin their act; that was part of it, you know. And other than that, there were\n\nsome little juggling and humor, whatever went on there, you know.\n\nGROSS: Now I know you weren't close to your father, and he really didn't even\n\nlive with the family when you were growing up. But I'm wondering if you went\n\nto see him much, if you saw his act much.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: I never saw his act; I was too young. But I used to go to\n\nsee him twice a year. He lived in New York, a half-hour from Kew Gardens\n\nwhere we lived. And I'd take a subway in, 10 years old, 12 years old,\n\nwhatever it was, and I'd meet him for an hour, and he'd walk me back to the\n\nsubway and I'd go home. My father saw me two hours a year; that's what it\n\namounted to.\n\nGROSS: So did it make you want to be in show business?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Who knows? I don't know. You know, show me some love, show\n\nme some--I mean, hear the laughs, the applause. I'll take love any way I can\n\nget it, you know. And I guess--Who knows?--to get love, you know, in show\n\nbusiness; to try and make some money, but there's no money in it when you\n\nstart. So it's just because you like to do it, I guess.\n\nGROSS: It seems like you had a really rough childhood. You never got to see\n\nyour father, but two hours a year you got to see him. You didn't really like\n\nyour mother; she sounds like she was a really difficult woman.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah.\n\nGROSS: Was there anything that was fun or funny in your childhood? Were\n\nthere...\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Nothing funny at all.\n\nGROSS: Seriously? So you think you had an unhappy childhood all the time?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Extremely. I never went to a ball game; no one took me\n\nanywhere. My mother was very, very unfair, the way she operated. Terry, I\n\nthink you read the story. I saved up a hundred bucks for the--selling ice\n\ncream on the beach, and she took it. You know what I mean?\n\nGROSS: Did you start being funny--I mean, if your childhood was so miserable,\n\nwere you funny when you were a child? Did you make other people laugh, even\n\nif you weren't laughing?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah. I guess I was sort of being funny when I was about\n\n13, 14. I used to mind a newsstand, and a friend of mine from when we went to\n\nschool would come down. I'd make him laugh an hour and a half.\n\nGROSS: So what were the first jokes you remember telling on stage?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: When I was 17 years old, I was booked by an agent named\n\nJack Miller(ph), who packed about 10 people in his car in New York, and we all\n\ndrove out to Newark, and we did a job at a theater there. And he paid\n\neveryone $2 each, and you got paid in quarters. Why no one ever knew. Well,\n\nyou get paid in quarters. The first joke I told out there, and it still got a\n\nlaugh for me, you know. I said, `Look at the audience tonight. The women\n\nlook like a beautiful bed of roses. Of course, there's a weed here and there,\n\nyou know.' So that was the joke I told, and I was 17.\n\nGROSS: When you decided to get back into show business, one of the ways you\n\ndid it was by opening up your own club.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Well, I'll tell you, the club was opened way after I was in\n\nshow business. I was already doing OK when I opened the club, you know. And\n\nI opened the club for--well, one big reason was I had two small kids at home,\n\nyou know, at four and eight, and I couldn't leave town and leave them alone.\n\nI had a domestic situation that was difficult, you know. So I decided to open\n\na nightclub, so that I could be in New York and work in New York only and my\n\nkids won't be alone, you know.\n\nGROSS: How often did you perform at it yourself?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: When the club opened, I worked there for nine years. And\n\nthen I would start taking breaks and, I mean, going out.\n\nGROSS: Did you have to come up with a lot of new material, since you were\n\nstaying in the same city?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Well...\n\nGROSS: What comics usually do is they travel around, so the people in\n\nMinneapolis haven't heard the material that they did in New York, and you can\n\nuse the same act.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Now, you know, everyone in my club, as in many\n\nclubs--there's never the same people. It is always changing because my\n\nbusiness all came from out of town. So if I was on \"The Tonight Show\" with\n\nJohnny Carson, they would know--he would say I was working at my own place,\n\nDangerfield's, in New York. And a lot of people would come to New York and\n\nthey'd come to the club, you know. Just had to do the show on \"Carson\" every\n\nthree or four months, and that would keep business coming in from out of town.\n\nGROSS: Now you helped a lot of comics get started at your club.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah. Yeah.\n\nGROSS: You want to name some of them?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah. Well, Jim Carrey. I met Jim, though--he worked at a\n\nclub, too, but I met him--I was working in Toronto, and they told me to catch\n\nthis fellow; they think he's pretty good. And I caught him, and he was doing\n\nimpressions. And he was great, great. So I asked him to work with me, and\n\nthe first job we went to was Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, which was a big deal\n\nto him, he told me. You know what I mean? And after that he opened for me\n\nfor two years on the road. So I was directly responsible helping him get in\n\nthe States and everything else.\n\nSam Kinison is one of my proteges--or was. He's a genius, Sam Kinison was,\n\nyou know. He was too much--and I thought he was great. And I put him on my\n\nshow; twice he was on. And Jerry...\n\nGROSS: Seinfeld?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah, Jerry Seinfeld. He was on the show, too, and a lot\n\nof others: Bob Saget, Louie Anderson, Rita Rudner.\n\nGROSS: I don't think this was at your club, but I know Andy Kaufman used to\n\nopen for you.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah, yeah. I loved Andy, you know (laughs). He opened for\n\nme--I asked him if he wanted to do a couple of jobs for me. He says, `Yeah.'\n\nI said, `OK.' And Andy's bit, you see, is he'd come on as a different\n\ncharacter and make the audience hate him. That was the bit. In his act, they\n\nwere coming on stage; they hit him, they hated him. You know what I mean?\n\nAnd that's what he would do. And I got a big kick out of it. And people told\n\nme, `Well, have a guy die for you. It would get us laughs.' I says, `No,\n\nhe's great. It's all right ...(unintelligible.' He said, `OK.' He was a\n\nvery talented guy, and he was different. For example, the whole audience was\n\nbooing him, absolutely booing him: `Get out, you bum! Boo! Boo!' Right?\n\nAnd so Andy says, `Now there's a few of you out there who are ruining it for\n\nthe rest of you.' But the whole place wanted him off. You know what I mean?\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: In fact, the second night the boss got smart. He put a huge\n\nnet right across the whole stage because they were going to throw things at\n\nhim. He knew it, right? And he did it. It worked OK. He only got hit\n\ntwice. Egg went through the net and a tomato, I think. And the rest\n\nwas--just stopped it.\n\nGROSS: My guest is Rodney Dangerfield. His new autobiography is called \"It's\n\nNot Easy Bein' Me.\" We'll talk more after a break. This is FRESH AIR.\n\n(Soundbite of music)\n\nGROSS: My guest is Rodney Dangerfield, and he has a new autobiography which\n\nis called \"It's Not Easy Bein' Me.\"\n\nYou know, you mentioned in your book that you've had problems with depression\n\nover the years.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah, I've been depressed many times.\n\nGROSS: It seems to be true of a lot of comics.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: I don't know. Depression--you know, the thing has no areas.\n\nIt can happen to an electrician, to a dockworker, anybody, you know. But I've\n\nexperienced it, I guess, my whole life, you know. When I was 15, I was\n\nwriting jokes just to get away from it all. I wanted to escape from life, so\n\nI wrote jokes, you know.\n\nGROSS: What was awful about your life?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Well, being brought up with no father and a mother who was\n\nextremely selfish, right? She never made me breakfast her entire life; always\n\ngot up at 11:00. But before I'd go to school, I'd mind the newsstand for an\n\nhour and a half, and I always had the same breakfast: Orangeade, doughnut and\n\ncoffee. That was a home-cooked meal for me (laughs).\n\nGROSS: Did your mother ever see you perform? Did she live to see you become\n\nvery successful?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: I don't know. No, no. No. My father did. In fact, I flew\n\nhim up here from Florida to come to the club and spend a night or two in the\n\napartment with me. So he flew up there. He saw whatever success I had at the\n\ntime.\n\nGROSS: Did your relationship change when he saw how successful you were?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: No, I don't think that had nothing to do with it. Our\n\nrelationship changed because I became older, and I forgave him for everything.\n\nHe cried to me, and he said, `Will you forgive me?' He meant for never seeing\n\nme, never--know what I mean?\n\nGROSS: Mm-hmm.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Two hours a year, I told you. And knowing my mother, he\n\ncouldn't have been happy with her, you know. I like my father better as a\n\nperson, you know?\n\nGROSS: Now you write in your book that your father's funeral was one of the\n\nloneliest moments of your life...\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah, right, right.\n\nGROSS: ...and that you were the only one there.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: I was there alone, you know.\n\nGROSS: Yeah, you were the only one at the funeral.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: I was there alone. And as they were lowering his body into\n\nthe ground, one of the workers comes over to me and says, `Hey, Rodney, can I\n\nhave your autograph?' What timing, you know (laughs)?\n\nGROSS: Can you talk a little bit about how you put together your act? Do\n\njokes just come to you whole, or do you have to, like, work at them and refine\n\nthem?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Well, sometimes you hit one right off the bat, suddenly,\n\nboom, right? And sometimes you can try, but you've got to sit and write one,\n\nlike I wrote a joke, you know, the other day. It was in the book, I think,\n\nyou know. I'm getting old. I had an accident. I was arrested for hit and\n\nwalk.\n\nGROSS: (Laughs) And then how do you figure out how to put them all together\n\nto make up, like, an act?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Well, I have to put together a stand-up, which is usually\n\nabout eight jokes, and a panel, which is about 30 jokes. So I need\n\napproximately 38 new jokes each time. And what you do is you take them and\n\nyou put them in--you make a necklace out of it. You put them together, so one\n\nfollows another correctly, you know, and they make sense. I don't know what\n\nelse to say. You put them together. And I guess sometimes you can't tell\n\npeople exactly how you do something, you know.\n\nGROSS: Sure.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: It's difficult.\n\nGROSS: Having built so much of your career on this `don't get no respect'\n\nimage, do you realize how appreciated you are now in comedy? Do you have a\n\nsense of that?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Yeah. In my own head, though, you see, I can never be a big\n\nshot. And I just--like, if I check in a hotel and the bellhop grabs my bag, I\n\nfeel like I should be taking the bag, you know? But I appreciate the fact\n\nthat I'm popular with people. It's a very nice feeling rather than to be\n\nunpopular. So I'm happy about the way things went.\n\nGROSS: So are you performing anymore?\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: I haven't performed in a long time now, about a year and a\n\nhalf, you know, because I was recuperating from an operation twice or\n\nsomething like that. But I will be performing very shortly and go back and\n\nsee if I can fool them again.\n\n(Soundbite of laughter)\n\nGROSS: Well, thank you so much for talking with us.\n\nMr. DANGERFIELD: Thank you so much, Terry.\n\nGROSS: Rodney Dangerfield's new autobiography is called \"It's Not Easy Bein'\n\nMe\".\" A new album featuring him singing called \"Romeo Rodney\" is scheduled to\n\nbe released at the end of the year.\n\n(Credits)"
