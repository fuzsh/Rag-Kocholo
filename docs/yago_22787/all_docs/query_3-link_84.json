        "text": "In the time it takes to make the 30-second elevator ride to his penthouse apartment in Westwood, Rodney Dangerfield could rattle off nine good jokes.\n\nThat is not just an arbitrary figure; Dangerfield is proud of that number. He boasts that he tells nine jokes in one particular 30-second portion of his Las Vegas show. In the one-hour show, he tells more than 400 jokes.\n\nBut that's work and Rodney is not working now, even though he has one more interview scheduled.\n\nHe has been fielding questions all day about his new movie, Meet Wally Sparks, which opens Friday, and now he's ready to relax.\n\nA visitor is led by an assistant to the dining room of his spacious apartment, where he is greeted by Dangerfield, who already has changed and is wearing a lumpy bathrobe, white socks and slippers that are falling off his feet. His voice is hoarse, but he's enough of a trouper to answer a few more questions.\n\nAlthough his answers are peppered with a few one-liners, Dangerfield, 75, is not a nonstop laugh riot. He is a serious man, a thoughtful man, an unhappy man.\n\n\"I have never been happy,\" he says matter-of-factly. \"My whole life has been a downer.\"\n\nOne waits for the punch line, but it never comes. Apparently, despite all the adulation and money, Rodney Dangerfield is indeed an unhappy man.\n\n\"There was nothing about my childhood that made me happy,\" he explains, \"and the scars of youth stay with you forever.\n\n\"All the attention I get now is very nice and I really do appreciate it, but the people don't love me. They love my work. And even if they do love me, it's not enough to make me happy.\"\n\nBorn Jacob Cohen on Long Island, the youngster began writing jokes at 15, not because he was a happy kid but because he wanted to escape his real life.\n\n\"My parents were separated my whole life and I was raised by my mother,\" he said. \"We lived in a neighborhood that was too rich for us, and every day, after school, I would deliver food to the back doors of the homes where the rich kids lived. It was humiliating and made me want to escape.\n\n\"They say people go into show business for the recognition, and maybe that's why I went into it. I know I never got any recognition from my mother and father.\"\n\nPicking the name Jack Roy, he began working as a standup comic at 19 but never made much of a go of it. At 28, about to marry, he quit show business and went into the aluminum-siding business.\n\nFor 12 years, he ran a sales office in Englewood, N.J., but the frustration of not being on the stage in front of an audience was eating away at him. His marriage was failing at that point and he decided to take another stab at telling jokes.\n\n\"I went to an old friend who ran a comedy club and told him I wanted to perform again,\" Dangerfield said. \"But I told him I was too embarrassed for him to advertise my name in case I failed. So he made up a name. It was Rodney Dangerfield.\"\n\nAt 40 and $20,000 in debt, the newly named comic knew he needed to do something different from what he did as Jack Roy. He needed an image, a character, a theme for his new act. So he came up with the idea that he would be the guy who talked about nothing going right in his life.\n\nFor several years, he talked about \"nothing goes right for me\" but then, on the night of his fourth appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show, he remembered some of the gangsters who hung out at the clubs where he performed. He said they were always talking about either getting respect or getting no respect.\n\n\"I realized that night that that was going to be my new image, that I get no respect,\" he said. \"I knew it would work because everybody feels sometimes like they get no respect.\"\n\nThe \"no respect\" bit worked, and Dangerfield has become a cultural icon who transcends generations. He appeals to older audiences who love his classic setup and punch-line humor, and the MTV generation worships him. Films such as Back to School and Caddyshack are required video rentals among college students.\n\n\"Rodney is the world's oldest teenager, and that's why kids love him,\" said Harry Basil, Dangerfield's frequent opening act in Las Vegas and his writing partner on Meet Wally Sparks.\n\n\"In his movies, he defies authority,\" Basil said. \"He says what the kids would love to say to authority figures. He is the perennial outsider, and everybody identifies with that. Everybody feels like they have been wronged or treated unfairly or have not received enough respect. It's a universal feeling, and Rodney is our champion.\"\n\nIn Meet Wally Sparks, Dangerfield plays the most obnoxious TV tabloid talk-show host in America. Let's put it this way: Jerry Springer thinks he goes too far.\n\nWhen the head of his station (Burt Reynolds) warns him to clean up his act, he sets out to interview a conservative governor (David Ogden Stiers) at his Southern mansion, but things don't work out exactly as planned.\n\nDangerfield and Basil said they worked on the script four years, and that, in Dangerfield's words, is what separates this film from the rest of the comedy pack.\n\n\"I'm difficult; I like Laurel and Hardy and the old-timers,\" Dangerfield said. \"I don't want to knock anybody, but I don't get belly laughs from the comedies that are coming out now. Okay, they're cute, but I don't laugh.\n\n\"And the reason is the script. They throw these scripts together in three months, and that's not enough time to hone a comedy script. You just can't do it. I don't care how funny you are.\"\n\nDangerfield has been married three years (to a Mormon), and he says he is no longer drinking, although the reason may have as much to do with the anti-depressants he's taking as it is with his wife's religion.\n\n\"Things are going well, and I enjoy it when people are entertained by my act,\" he said. \"That's all I want; I have enough money. I just want to make people laugh. That's my goal in life. It won't make me a happy man, but it will be enough.\""
