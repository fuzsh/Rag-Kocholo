        "text": "Even comedian Rodney Dangerfield’s home gets no respect.\n\nThe late comedian’s wife is having a hard time finding an audience to buy this snazzy estate.\n\nJoan Dangerfield, 70 — who was married to the popular comic until his death at age 82 on Oct. 5, 2004 — initially listed her luxe Los Angeles compound for $17.8 million last February but, unable to find a compatible buyer, has cut its price down $16.995 million.\n\n“I figured it would sell in a week, but didn’t quite work out that way,” she recently told the Wall Street Journal of the mansion, which she purchased for $6.25 million in the early 2000s, adding that its failure to sell has been quite a surprise. “It was a shock for me to just watch it sit there on the market.”\n\nThe listing is held by Aaron Kirman of AKG | Christie’s International Real Estate, who told The Post that it’s “an honor to represent Mrs. Dangerfield on this one-of-a-kind, trophy, legacy estate. The combination of privacy, architectural integrity and incredible view is a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity in the prized Bird Streets of Los Angeles.”\n\nThe home, which is set on “a hill of solid rock” that offers a panoramic view of the city, has four bedrooms and six bathrooms and measures 16,673 square feet spread across two stories.\n\nIt was built in 2004 by John Andrews Group Architects, according to the Robb Report, and features a sunken living room surrounded by floor-to-ceiling windows, Art Deco accents and an infinity-edge pool-equipped backyard.\n\nOther outdoor amenities include an outdoor shower, a terrazzo patio and a bust of Rodney by the jacuzzi.\n\nThere’s a chandelier hanging from one of the skylights, the kitchen has a circular breakfast nook, and the primary suite boasts its own fireplace, a mother-of-pearl tile-accented wall, direct access to the outdoors, an en suite bathroom with a double sink vanity and a changing room.\n\nElsewhere on the property, there’s a home theater, formal dining room and two-car garage."
