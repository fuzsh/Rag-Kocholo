        "text": "[about playing fetch]\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nHe throws a stick, you run and get it, you bring it back and he throws it again! I don't get it! I mean, what's the point?\n\nRaffles:\n\nBecause it makes them happy and it gives them lots of exercise\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nIf they want exercise, let them run and get it.\n\nRaffles:\n\nSo what should I do?\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nIt's very simple. You do nothing.\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nWhere's Flappy?\n\nQueenie:\n\nCarmine fired him. He couldn't remember the routines.\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nOh, I saw that coming. Flappy was dumb. Yeah, he used to walk backwards and wag his head. I mean dumb! Carmine taught him to sit, he forgot how to stand! And when Carmine paper-trained him, that was something. He went right on the paper. The only trouble is, Carmine was reading it!\n\nTurkey:\n\nLet me tell you, I won't be here very long.\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nI tell ya, the way I see it, you probably won't be around after Christmas!\n\nTurkey:\n\nWell, that would suit me just fine! Well, I might have known: There's absolutely nothing to eat here!\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nYeah? Look in a mirror!\n\nTurkey:\n\nOh... I don't get it.\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nDon't worry about it, drumstick. You will!\n\n[Rover attacks Rocky]\n\nRocky:\n\n[kicks him off] You dirty mutt!\n\nConnie:\n\nRocky, what are you doing?\n\nRocky:\n\nI thought I was rid of you for good!\n\nConnie:\n\n'Rid of you for good'?\n\n[Connie punches him in the face]\n\nRocky:\n\n[furiously] What, are you taking the dog's side? Huh?\n\n[Rocky grabs Connie until Rover pushes him, Rover and the other dogs chase him out the door]\n\nConnie:\n\nRover, NAIL HIM!\n\n[Daisy leads rover to the barn and they were coming to piles and piles of hay which had a pair of boxer shorts on top of one stack. Rover is tucking his tie and was about to kiss Daisy, but then she turned his face and made him look as the shorts seemed to move. And where this made Rover curious of what was in or under the boxer shorts. As he looked, there popped out a puppy which strongly resembled him. he heard a yip and saw another puppy that look resembled him and one pop out of the hay, another one resembled him barking underneath the bucket and there was one puppy who looked like Daisy who was teething on the hose and she look at her mother and her new father whom beams a smile]\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nHey, i'm a father of five!\n\n[Another puppy then fell on Rover's face and Rover held out the final puppy in his litter]\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nSix!\n\n[Then the puppy speaks to him in a child-like voice]\n\nRover's Son:\n\nHey, take it easy, I'm only a pup.\n\n[Rover hugs his son and put his paw over Daisy}\n\nRover Dangerfield:\n\nHey, boys. Daddy's home!"
