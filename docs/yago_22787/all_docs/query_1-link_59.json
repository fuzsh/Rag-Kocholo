        "text": "A 1991 animated feature film produced by Hyperion Pictures and released by Warner Bros, starring the voice talents of comedian Rodney Dangerfield, who also wrote and co-produced the film. It is about a street dog named Rover, who is owned by Connie, a Las Vegas showgirl. However, Rover gets dumped off Hoover Dam by Connie's boyfriend, Rocky; however, rather than drowning, Rover ends up on a farm.\n\nTropes used in Rover Dangerfield include:\n\nBabies Ever After\n\nBlack Comedy Burst: The Turkey scene.\n\nCasanova Wannabe: Rover.\n\nCrouching Moron, Hidden Badass: Rover.\n\nDead Turkey Comedy: Averted. The turkey gets killed, but it ain't played for laughs.\n\nWell, afterwards it isn't, but the goofy way Rover tries to revive said Turkey clearly was meant to.\n\nEpic Fail: Rover fails so badly at sheep herding that when he turns his back on them to be with Daisy they've somehow gotten stuck up a tree.\n\nFamily-Unfriendly Death: Yes, children, the silly turkey dies, on camera, mouth agape, eyes wide in terror.\n\nAnd broken neck swaying.\n\nFan Service: There's a shot of Rover's owner in a very skimpy Las Vegas showgirl uniform at one point -- it shows shocking skin considering it's in a movie for children.\n\nFish Eyes: As is apparently common in cartoons of Rodney Dangerfield himself, Rover's eyes are often drawn slightly like this.\n\nGender Equals Breed: Rover and Daisy's pups; 5 little Rovers and one little Daisy.\n\nHumanoid Female Animal: Inverted; the film provides a rare example of the opposite!\n\nHurricane of Puns: In some scenes, the one-liners contain puns a lot.\n\nIncredibly Lame Pun: Basically the main source for humor.\n\nInk Suit Actor: Rover to Rodney Dangerfield.\n\nJerkass: Rocky, the nastiest dog-kicking classic \"bad boy\" you'll ever see. He totally deserved to see the Hoover Dam in the end.\n\nLong Bus Trip: Eddie, Rover's little buddy at the beginning. Whatever happened to him in the end?\n\nMood Dissonance: Two characters are Killed Off for Real during the span of the movie, one on-screen and one off-screen, and both in rather dark ways.\n\nNice Guy: Raffles.\n\nNo Celebrities Were Harmed\n\nOne-Liner\n\nObviously Evil: Rocky.\n\nOf Corpse He's Alive: Rover attempts this with the turkey. The farmer isn't fooled.\n\nShoot the Dog: Subverted.\n\nThe Renaissance Age of Animation\n\nViva Las Vegas: Though most of the film takes place on a farm, the shots in Vegas have lots of scenes of flashing lights, casinos, and sequin clad feathery showgirls."
