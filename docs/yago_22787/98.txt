He was born on November 22, 1921, in Babylon, New York, and passed away on October 5, 2004, in Los Angeles, California.

Dangerfield's journey to comedic success was not an easy one. He faced numerous hurdles and setbacks throughout his life, which ultimately shaped his distinct comedic persona. Born into a struggling Jewish family, Dangerfield had a difficult childhood. His father struggled to maintain a steady job, and his mother was often a source of emotional turmoil. Reflecting on his early years, Dangerfield once quipped, "I told my psychiatrist that everyone hates me. He said I was being ridiculous - everyone hasn't met me yet." After an upbringing filled with financial instability, Dangerfield followed his passion for comedy and pursued a career in entertainment. He started performing stand-up comedy in the 1940s, initially using the stage name Jack Roy. However, despite his talent, Dangerfield's career struggled to gain momentum, and he spent several years performing in small venues, earning very little recognition or financial success. This period of his life was filled with frustration and disappointment, and he often contemplated quitting comedy altogether. However, Dangerfield's determination and unwavering love for the craft kept him going. It was not until the late 1960s and early 1970s that Dangerfield's career finally took off. His breakthrough came with a series of memorable appearances on popular television shows, including "The Ed Sullivan Show" and "The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson."

In 1980, Dangerfield achieved another significant milestone in his career with the release of his comedy album, "No Respect." The album became an instant hit, earning Dangerfield a Grammy Award for Best Comedy Album. It was also during this time that Dangerfield began appearing in films, becoming a recognizable presence on the silver screen. Some of Dangerfield's most notable film appearances include his breakthrough role in the 1980 comedy "Caddyshack," where he played the eccentric Al Czervik. This role solidified his status as a comedic legend, and he went on to star in numerous successful films throughout the 1980s and 1990s, including "Back to School," "Easy Money," and "Ladybugs." Dangerfield's career spanned over 60 years, during which he established himself as a true comedic icon. His style of humor, characterized by his trademark self-deprecation and quick one-liners, remains influential and widely recognized today. As he once quipped, "I'm not a sexy guy. I went to a hooker. I dropped my pants. She dropped her price." Beyond his comedic talent, Dangerfield was also a respected writer. He penned two best-selling books, "It's Not Easy Bein' Me: A Lifetime of No Respect but Plenty of Sex and Drugs" and "I Couldn't Stand My Wife's Cooking ... So I Opened a Restaurant."
