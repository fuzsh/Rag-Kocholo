        "text": "SUMMARY\n\nWilliam Peirce was a tobacco planter and merchant, a burgess representing Jamestown, a member of the governor’s Council (1632–1643), and one of the first slaveholders in the Virginia colony. Born in England, where he married and had a daughter, he sailed for Virginia with his family in 1609. His ship, the Sea Venture, crashed in Bermuda, and there Peirce befriended John Rolfe. The two cultivated tobacco together in Virginia and Rolfe married Peirce’s daughter, Joane. In 1619, Peirce was one of three men dispatched by the governor to meet a ship containing the first Africans to arrive in the colony; one of those Africans, a woman identified as Angelo, was living in the Peirce household six years later. Peirce fought the Indians of Tsenacomoco during the Second Anglo-Powhatan War (1622–1632) and in 1623 was appointed captain of the Governor’s guard and commander of James City. His brick house in the city was described by George Sandys as “the fairest in Virginia.” Peirce was elected a burgess in 1624 and then served on the Council for more than a decade, taking part in the removal of the royal governor, Sir John Harvey, in 1635. After appearing in London to explain his actions, he returned to Virginia and died sometime between 1645 and 1647.\n\nEarly Years\n\nPeirce was born in England, perhaps about 1580, but little else is known of his early years. He is often confused with a William Pierce, also from England, who settled with the Pilgrims at Plymouth in what later became Massachusetts. Both had wives named Joane. The surname Peirce was spelled with dozens of variations, including Pierce, Pearse, Perse, Perce, and Peerce.\n\nOn June 2, 1609, Peirce, his wife, Joane, and their young daughter, also Joane, left England for the struggling colony in Virginia, part of a fleet that included nine ships and 600 passengers. Aboard the Blessing, Joane Peirce and her daughter arrived safely in Virginia sometime late in August. William Peirce, however, traveled on the flagship Sea Venture, which encountered a hurricane at sea and washed ashore in Bermuda. After spending the winter on the islands building two new ships, Peirce and the others sailed to Jamestown the next spring. There, they found only about sixty survivors of the Starving Time, including Peirce’s wife and daughter.\n\nPlanter, Merchant, and Slaveholder\n\nBy 1619 Peirce was a lieutenant of the Jamestown guard and accompanied the governor, Sir George Yeardley, when he made a treaty that year with the Chickahominy Indians. Late in August or early in September of 1619 two English ships arrived at Point Comfort carrying Africans stolen from a Portuguese slave ship bound for Vera Cruz, New Spain (present-day Mexico). Yeardley dispatched Peirce; John Rolfe, then the colony’s secretary; and a Mr. Ewens (probably William Ewens) to meet the second of the two ships, the Treasurer. Although the ship had fled by the time they arrived, a few of its enslaved Africans had been left behind. One of those, an African woman identified as Angelo, appeared in the census of January 24, 1625, as living in the Peirce household. It is likely that Peirce purchased her in 1619, making him one of Virginia’s first slaveholders.\n\nIn December 1619, Peirce received a patent for 650 acres on Mulberry Island, on the north side of the James River about ten miles below Jamestown. Soon after he received another 1,450 acres in a transaction that involved John Rolfe, whom he had befriended on the Sea Venture and who was the first in Virginia to cultivate a marketable variety of tobacco. Sometime in 1619–1620 Rolfe, whose second wife, Pocahontas, had died in England, married Peirce’s daughter Joane. In his will, dated March 10, 1621, Rolfe appointed Peirce guardian of his children. He died the next year.\n\nPeirce thrived in the colony. He appeared to have been close to Governor Sir Francis Wyatt and George Sandys, the colonial treasurer, both of whom arrived in 1621. In May 1623, Wyatt named Peirce captain of the Governor’s guards and commander of James City. Peirce also served as the colony’s cape merchant, running a store in the city, and as lieutenant governor. In addition, he was responsible for the island’s two blockhouses, the small fortified structures that dotted the perimeter of the settlement. In 1623 and 1627, as part of the Second Anglo-Powhatan War, he led mid-summer attacks against Indians along the Chickahominy River, either destroying or stealing their corn crops.\n\nPeirce built a brick house on Jamestown overlooking the James River and Sandys lived there for a time as he experimented with the cultivation of silkworms and worked on his famous translation of Ovid’s Metamorphoses. In a letter to an official of the Virginia Company of London, dated April 8, 1623, Sandys declared the house to be “the fairest in Virginia.” The James City lot was a large one, and the elder Joane Peirce cultivated a garden of three to four acres, one year reaping 100 bushels of figs. In 1625, the Peirce household included Peirce’s wife, the enslaved woman Angelo, and the indentured servants Thomas Smith, aged seventeen, and Henry Bradford, aged thirty-five, both of whom had arrived aboard the Abigaile in January 1625. Ester Edrife worked as a maidservant and had been in the colony since 1619 or 1620. With several more working on the Mulberry Island plantation, Peirce claimed a total of thirteen servants in 1625, making him one of the wealthiest men in the colony. (Yeardley and Sandys had thirty-nine and thirty-seven, respectively.) Two years later, he received three additional male servants who had been tenants of the now-defunct Virginia Company. In 1635 he patented 2,000 acres on Lawnes Creek in what became Isle of Wight County, and sometime in the 1640s acquired another 1,170 acres in James City County, and 27 acres of land adjacent to the Governor’s Land. On July 18, 1640, six white servants and a black male slave attempted to escape from Peirce, a case that appeared before the General Court.\n\nPolitical Career\n\nIn 1624, Peirce was elected a burgess from Jamestown at a time when the Virginia Company was riven by factional intrigue and financial problems. That year the General Assembly, in a document signed by Peirce, formally rebutted claims by Alderman Robert Johnson, of the Virginia Company, that the colony had thrived under the martial law first administered by Sir Thomas Gates and Sir Thomas Dale beginning in 1610. Peirce served as a member of the governor’s Council from 1632 to 1643 and in January 1640 was appointed tobacco inspector for Stanley Hundred and Denbigh Parish.\n\nIn 1629, Peirce made a return visit to England and published a short and widely read account, A relation in generall of the present state of his Majties Colony in Virginia. At a time when disease ravaged the colony and the English had long been at war with the Indians of Tsenacomoco, Peirce was optimistic. He described the colony’s English population—numbering, he guessed, at between 4,000 and 5,000—as “well housed in every plantation,” with an abundance of wildlife and fish and a soil ideal for the cultivation of corn. “The Colony, under the favor of God and of his Maj,” he wrote, “hath bene raised to this height of people and provision, especially by the means of Tobacco.”\n\nIn 1635 Peirce was a leader among those on the Council who sought to remove the royal governor, Sir John Harvey, from office. Protesting the governor’s plan for a royal monopoly on the tobacco trade, the councillors arranged for armed musketeers to surround the governor’s house, and Harvey was forced to leave Virginia. The governor returned to the colony two years later, and on August 27, 1640, the king summoned Peirce and three other councillors to London to answer for their actions in the affair. Peirce’s property was seized, but the Privy Council later reinstated it and allowed him to return to Virginia, his position intact. Peirce died sometime between 1645 and June 22, 1647.\n\nMAP\n\nTIMELINE\n\nWilliam Peirce is born in England.\n\nWilliam Peirce, his wife, Joane Peirce, and their young daughter leave England for Virginia, part of a fleet that includes nine ships and 600 passenger.\n\nA hurricane strikes the nine-ship English fleet bound for Virginia on a rescue mission. The flagship Sea Venture is separated from the other vessels and irreparably damaged by the storm.\n\nAfter being damaged by a hurricane, eight of nine English ships bound for Virginia arrive safely at Jamestown under the assumption that the flagship Sea Venture, carrying Captain Christopher Newport and Sir Thomas Gates, had been lost at sea. The news sends the colony into a political tailspin.\n\nWhile the English colonists starve in Virginia, the shipwrecked crew and passengers of the Sea Venture make camp in Bermuda. They build two new boats, the Patience and Deliverance, from Bermuda cedar and the scavenged remains of the Sea Venture.\n\nThe party of Virginia colonists headed by Sir Thomas Gates, now aboard the Patience and Deliverance, arrives at Jamestown. They find only sixty survivors of a winter famine. Gates decides to abandon the colony for Newfoundland.\n\nBy this year William Peirce is a lieutenant of the Jamestown guard and accompanies Sir George Yeardley when he makes a treaty with the Chickahominy Indians.\n\nSometime during this period, John Rolfe marries his third wife, Joane Peirce.\n\nThe White Lion, captained by John Colyn Jope, arrives at Point Comfort, where Jope sells \"20. and odd Negroes\" in exchange for food. These are the first Africans to enter the Virginia colony. Four days later, the Treasurer arrives and its captain, Daniel Elfrith, sells two or three of the enslaved Africans aboard.\n\nWilliam Peirce receives a patent for 650 acres on Mulberry Island, on the north side of the James River about ten miles below Jamestown.\n\nIn his will, John Rolfe appoints William Peirce guardian of his children. Rolfe dies soon after.\n\nIn a letter to a Virginia Company official, George Sandys declares William Peirce's house to be \"the fairest in Virginia.\"\n\nGovernor Sir Francis Wyatt names William Peirce captain of the Governor's guards and commander of James City.\n\nWilliam Peirce leads an attack against Indians along the Chickahominy River.\n\nWilliam Peirce is elected a burgess from Jamestown.\n\nThe Jamestown muster lists \"Angelo a Negro Woman\" as living in the household of William Peirce.\n\nWilliam Peirce leads an attack against Indians along the Chickahominy River.\n\nWhile visiting London William Peirce publishes A relation in generall of the present state of his Majties Colony in Virginia.\n\nWilliam Peirce serves on the governor's Council.\n\nWilliam Peirce patents 2,000 acres on Lawnes Creek in what will become Isle of Wight County.\n\nWhile William Claiborne is at Kent Island, a faction of Council members to which he belongs decides to evict Governor Sir John Harvey from office.\n\nWilliam Peirce is appointed tobacco inspector for Stanley Hundred and Denbigh Parish.\n\nSix white servants and a black male slave attempt to escape from William Peirce.\n\nThe king summons William Peirce and three other councillors to London to answer for their actions in attempting to remove Governor Sir John Harvey from office.\n\nWilliam Peirce dies sometime during this period.\n\nFURTHER READING\n\nMcCartney, Martha W.
