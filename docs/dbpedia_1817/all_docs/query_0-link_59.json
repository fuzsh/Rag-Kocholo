[1][2][3] His older brother, Malcolm, was strangled at the age of two.[2][4] His two older sisters, Claricia and Hodierna, both died unmarried.[5]\n\nHenry succeeded his father as earl of Huntingdon in 1136.[1][6] His mother had a hereditary claim to the earldom of Northumberland which King David demanded also be invested in Henry, but King Stephen refused to do so.[6] Accordingly, in 1138 David sent his army into Yorkshire where he suffered an ignominious defeat at the Battle of the Standard with Henry, who had led the men of Cumberland and Teviotdale, barely escaping with his life.[6] However, the heroic calvary charge which Henry led at the last minute on a flank of the English army (accompanied only by what was left of his father's bodyguard) was so much admired that when peace was restored in the spring of the following year, Stephen relented and did present him with Northumberland .[1][7] [8]\n\nNotable Events\n\nHenry subsequently spent time at King Stephen's court, becoming a favorite there, and later accompanied Stephen to the seige of Ludlow. There Henry was nearly unhorsed by a grappling iron and would have been taken captive, but King Stephen fought off Henry's attackers and rescued him.[6][8] It was during his sojourn at Stephen's court that Henry met his future bride, Ada de Warenne.[8]\n\nHenry was trained from the age of about fourteen to inherit the throne of Scotland, his name constantly linked with his father's in charters, and in a document dated 1144 he was styled \"rex designatus\" (king-designate).[6] Coins were issued in his name at Bamburgh, Carlisle, and Corbridge.[6] On 22 May 1149 he stood sponsor to Henry Plantagenet for his knighting.[6] In 1150 he joined with his father to found a Cisterian house at Holmcultram, Cumberland for monks from Melrose Abbey.[1][6]\n\nMarriage and Children\n\nEarl Henry married in 1139 Ada de Warenne, a daughter of William de Warenne, 2nd earl of Surrey and earl of Warenne, and Isabel de Vermandois.[1][2] There were at least six children from this marriage: [see research notes]\n\nMalcolm IV, King of Scots; b. 20 Mar 1141;[9][10] d. 9 Dec 1214[11][12]\n\nAda Dunkeld; b. bef. 1143[13] m. 28 Aug 1162 Floris III, count of Holland[14][15]\n\nWilliam I, King of Scots; b. c.1143;[3][16] m. 5 Sep 1189 Ermengarde Beaumont;[16][17] d. 4 Dec 1214[18][19]\n\nDavid Dunkeld, earl of Huntingdon; b. c.1144[2][3] m. 26 Aug 1190 Maud Chester;[3][2] d. 17 Jun 1219[2][3]\n\nMargaret (or Margery) Dunkeld; b. c.1145[20][21] m(1) 1160 Conan IV, duke of Brittany and earl of Richmond;[3][14][22] m(2) Humphrey de Bohun, earl of Hereford[3][14]\n\nMaud (or Matilda) Dunkeld; b. aft. 1146;[21] died unmarried in 1152[23][24][14][25]\n\nDeath\n\nHenry, earl of Northumberland, died 12 June 1152, aged (about) 37 years, and was buried at Kelso Abbey in Roxburghshire.[26][1][27] Contemporary historians in both England and Scotland lamented the earl's early death and praised him as \"all that is excellent in a knight, a prince, and a man.\"[8] Henry's death turned out to be a heavy blow to Scotland, as the following year his father, King David, also died and Henry's eldest son Malcolm, not an experienced heir but a boy only eleven years of age, succeeded his grandfather as King of Scots.[6][8] His widow, the Countess Ada, granted a toft in Haddington to Dunfermline Abbey, Fife, for the soul of her husband, Earl Henry.[1]\n\nResearch Notes\n\nPosssible fourth daughter of Henry and Ada\n\nDouglas Richardson discusses briefly the possiblity of a fourth daughter whose name is unknown, who in 1168 was offered in marriage to an unnamed son of Guglielmo V, marquis of Monferrato, and whose history is unknown.[28] As evidence of this daughter's existence, Richardson cites Giles, Joannis Saresberiensis postea episcopi Carnotensis Opera Omnia, vol. 2 (1848), p. 131; and Millor, Letters of John of Salisbury, vol. 2 (1979), p. 555. Unfortunately neither of these sources appear to be available online. Because virtually nothing is known about this possible daughter (even the suggested marriage cannot be confirmed) and no other historians include any mention of her, she has not been included in the list of children on this profile.
