        "text": "Greetings cousin.I have researched the Golightly name back to the youngest son of King William I. the Lion of Scotland. His wisdom was to 'Sur'name his youngest son Henry as Henery 'Galactely'which is Galic for Golightly.William was born on December 4th 1143, died 72 years later on the same date, 1215.\n\nHe had 4 children by Queen Emmerguard, Margaret who married Gil'bert Mareschal [Marshal] then Margotta, then Isabelle, then Alexander, then Robert, Sur named de London, who died as a child, then Henry Golightly.\n\nHis mother was Lady Isabelle de Clare, of Richard Stromgbow de Clare of the Norman Lords.\n\nHis name Henry aquired the, Sur 'sir' name Golightly, nominated by the king on the advise of keeping his youngest son away from royal positions.\n\nHis older brother Alexander II became King and died then his son Alexander III ruled Scotland, died and as he had no children the throne was vacant.\n\nHenry Golightly married a de Clare, had his own children, then in 1296 Patrick Golightly was one of the 13 competitots for the throne of Scotland.\n\nThe sacred Rock of the Scone was stolen by Edward I, July 4th 1296, and taken to london. It remanined there until July 4th 1996 when queen Elizabeth sent it back.\n\nAs the stone was stolen, Patrick withdrw from the competition for the throne, and his second cousin John Baloil became king.He however was less royal being descended from the brother of William I. the Lion.\n\nBaloil became king, then his second cousin\n\nalso of the same linage, Robert Bruce took the throne by war. From this king descends James VI. of Scotland who was nominated by\n\nWilliam Shakespeare [real name Edward de Veer] to Elizabeth I. as she lay dying.\n\nJames became king of England. His mother Mary Queen of Scotts was beheaded by a warrant signed by Elizabeth, so the guilt was rewarded in James becoming king.\n\nHis son was Charles I. who was also beheaded by the Freemason parliament as he, like James and Mary, were of the firm belief that the Divine right of kings over ruled paliaments, as the throne was held in trust for Jesus Christ.\n\nJames did little but authorise the King James bible of 1611. In this bible are a series of number codes that were discovered by the Parliament, and a new translation was ordered and the codes removed.\n\nIn the codes the prophecy nominates the name of the family the true royal name is. In Isaiah 22:22 it mentiones the royal descendant as being the 'key' of the house 'family' of David.\n\nIn 586 BC Nebuccadnezza beseiged Jerusalem, captured the king, Zedekiah and took him to Babylon, murdering his four sons and blinding the King, who died.\n\nIn Ireland, ancient records reveal that the prophet Jeremiah and Baruc his scribe, arrived from Spain with the kings court and two daughters. In Tara is a mound were the ancient royal regalia are stored.\n\nThe government, now Freemasons, refuse its reopening, as the contents prove the royal line of Judah was intact in the two daughters.\n\nFirst cousin marriages ensured that the Judah line remained pure, so William, being the true descendant of the queen, was aware that the Knights Templars were claiming the descendant of Jesus was alive and the true King.\n\nThe claim was that Jesus did not die on the cross, was taken down, revived, overcame the wonds and married Mary Magdalene.That offspring is put forard today as being HRH Prince Michael James Alexander Stewart, of the Robert Bruce line.He was born in Brussels. April 22nd 1958.\n\nHe is presently the Prince recognised by the Knights Templars, and Lady Diana was a Sturt, the same name as the older spelling Stewart. Her murder was concocted because she was to marry an Egyptian Arab and Muslim.She was also pregnant at the time, so my MI6 Informant told me.\n\nThe murder was carried out on the orders of the Freemasons headed up by the Duke of Kent, is Antichrist, as it is the beast today predicted by the prophet John.\n\nThe death car was overtaken by a motor bike ridden by two men, one driving the other carrying a 'light' canon, which fired a bright blinding light, so powerful it was seen by a gentleman who was outside the tunnel hundreds of meters behind the crash scene.\n\nProphect tells us that the true king must arrise out of the Judah line of david and that it has never and will never be destroyed.\n\nThe Golightly Standard is a Lions head with an ancient crown of David, which is flown above the Union Jack.The Union Jack is of de Clare Standard or insignia or flag.\n\nIn Canada in 1995, I appeared in court and demanded the queen acknowledge the Golightly linage as being the true royal family.I contended that the Golightly name must produce a child that is Christ.\n\nI was throne out of court, but the records stand that this contention was made. In any case, I was set upon by agents of the CIA who threatened to silence me, I therefor must have hit a nerve.\n\nTo find the most royal man is to find the man who is Christ, and to do that the marriages of a Golightly to a first cousin name also descended from the same King William, is our man. It can be either a woman Golightly married to another of royal blood or a male Golightly married to one of royal blood, and that child is potentially the King or Christ.God will accomplish it, but it is nice to know.\n\nI first noticed I was under survailance some years ago.I was living in Canada just when the Internet was kicking off.I could not get on the Internet.\n\nIn time, as I am a bit of a computer nut, I found away around them.I moved into an apartment and the former teneant left her phone line, and I had a new one installed.\n\nI tried to get on the net and as along as I used it for research of other endevours, I was allowed on line.However I hooked up on the otherb line in another name, JcksSprat and can get out to do the real job at hand.\n\nvery interesting? yes?\n\nAll royals seek the genetics you and I have, as the direct line of Willim is from King David of Israel, and we are in fact the true royal family.\n\nPoor Lady Diana paid the ultimate price, so take heed.\n\nLove Brian."
