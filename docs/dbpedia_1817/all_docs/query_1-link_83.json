        "text": "The song rang out around Wembley louder than ever after England reached the final of Euro 2020 with Wednesday night’s amazing 2-1 win over Denmark.\n\n“Three Lions”, referring to the England national team’s badge, has helped inspire Harry Kane and his teammates right up until the moment he slammed in the rebound from his saved penalty in extra time to send the fans wild, and ensure his country’s first major final since the 1966 World Cup victory – a 55-year wait.\n\nNext comes Italy at Wembley on Sunday night, with a chance to make history.\n\nBut what is the origin of England’s association with the King of the Beasts, and why do they adorn the crest on the shirts of the the national team? Here’s all you need to know.\n\nWhy are three lions associated with England?\n\nThe lion is England’s national animal, with an association that goes back almost 1,000 years ago.\n\nIt started with Henry I, fourth son of Norman William the Conqueror, whose coat of arms featured a lion rampant on a red background.\n\nIn 1121 he married Adeliza of Louvain, whose father also used a lion on his arms – so Henry adapted his one to include a pair of them.\n\nThen, in 1152, Henry I’s grandson Henry, Duke of Normandy married Eleanor of Aquitaine – whose family also had a lion on its crest. Young Henry himself became King Henry II of England in 1154 – founding the great Plantagenet dynasty\n\nIt was their son Richard the Lionheart – famed for his exploits in the Crusades (he actually spent very little time in England, was once held for ransom by an Austrian and a German, and was killed by a Frenchman while besieging a castle) – who decided to combine all three lions to make up his arms.\n\nThat symbol – three golden lions on a red background – to be exact, Gules, three lions passant guardant in pale or – went on to represent the kings of England until 1340, when Edward III added the lilies of the arms of France. England claimed some big wins against the French at key fixtures – such as Agincourt – in a 100-year tournament, although later squads failed to repeat their trophy exploits.\n\nAnd to this day, the three lions can still be seen flying proudly on the UK’s Royal Standard.\n\nBut why they are on the England shirt?\n\nThe three lions is the emblem of the Football Association – which would have had to ask for permission to use it due to its royal association.\n\nThe national team has worn them on their shirt – blue on a white background – ever since the first international against – yes, it had to be – Scotland in 1872.\n\nThere was a minor design change in 1949 when the crown that was above the lions was removed, to differentiate the badge from that of the England cricket team.\n\nIn May, the FA revealed a new lion logo for its grassroots initiative England Football. It features a red lion, lioness and cub, and aimed to the give the crest “a fresh purpose that symbolises inclusivity at all levels of football,” the FA said. However, it does not replace the Three Lions on the national shirt.\n\nSo, if 55 years of hurt ends on Sunday night, remember the 1,000 years of history."
