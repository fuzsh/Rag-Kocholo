Marjory de HUNTINGDON [123503] was born after 1152 in Huntingdon Huntingdonshire England and died in 1213 in Forfar Angus Scotland.\n\n133. King Henry II PLANTAGENET Of England [35152] (Matilda BEAUCLERC Empress Of Germany79, Henry I King Of England49, William \"The Conqueror\" (King Of England)33, Robert I \"The Magnificent\"20, Richard II10, Richard I8, William I of Normandy (Duke)6, Rollo1) was born on 5 Mar 1133 in Le Mans Sarthe Pays-de-Loire France and died on 6 Jul 1189 in Chinon Indre-et-Loire France at age 56.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia says:\n\nHenry II (5 March 1133 \\endash 6 July 1189), also known as Henry Curtmantle (French: Court-manteau), Henry FitzEmpress or Henry Plantagenet, ruled as Count of Anjou, Count of Maine, Duke of Normandy, Duke of Aquitaine, Count of Nantes, King of England (1154\\endash 89) and Lord of Ireland; at various times, he also controlled Wales, Scotland and Brittany. Henry was the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Matilda, daughter of Henry I of England. He became actively involved by the age of 14 in his mother's efforts to claim the throne of England, then occupied by Stephen of Blois, and was made Duke of Normandy at 17. He inherited Anjou in 1151 and shortly afterwards married Eleanor of Aquitaine, whose marriage to Louis VII of France had recently been annulled. Stephen agreed to a peace treaty after Henry's military expedition to England in 1153: Henry inherited the kingdom on Stephen's death a year later.\n\nHenry was an energetic and sometimes ruthless ruler, driven by a desire to restore the lands and privileges of his royal grandfather, Henry I. During the early years of the younger Henry's reign he restored the royal administration in England, re-established hegemony over Wales and gained full control over his lands in Anjou, Maine and Touraine. Henry's desire to reform the relationship with the Church led to conflict with his former friend Thomas Becket, the Archbishop of Canterbury. This controversy lasted for much of the 1160s and resulted in Becket's murder in 1170. Henry soon came into conflict with Louis VII and the two rulers fought what has been termed a \"cold war\" over several decades. Henry expanded his empire, often at Louis' expense, taking Brittany and pushing east into central France and south into Toulouse; despite numerous peace conferences and treaties no lasting agreement was reached. By 1172, he controlled England, large parts of Wales, the eastern half of Ireland and the western half of France, an area that would later come to be called the Angevin Empire.\n\nHenry and Eleanor had eight children. As they grew up, tensions over the future inheritance of the empire began to emerge, encouraged by Louis and his son King Philip II. In 1173 Henry's heir apparent, \"Young Henry\", rebelled in protest; he was joined by his brothers Richard and Geoffrey and by their mother, Eleanor. France, Scotland, Flanders and Boulogne allied themselves with the rebels. The Great Revolt was only defeated by his vigorous military action and talented local commanders, many of them \"new men\" appointed for their loyalty and administrative skills. Young Henry and Geoffrey revolted again in 1183, resulting in Young Henry's death. The Norman invasion of Ireland provided lands for his youngest son John, but Henry struggled to find ways to satisfy all his sons' desires for land and immediate power. Philip successfully played on Richard's fears that Henry would make John king, and a final rebellion broke out in 1189. Decisively defeated by Philip and Richard and suffering from a bleeding ulcer, Henry retreated to Chinon in Anjou, where he died.\n\nHenry's empire quickly collapsed during the reign of his youngest son John. Many of the changes Henry introduced during his long rule, however, had long-term consequences. Henry's legal changes are generally considered to have laid the basis for the English Common Law, while his intervention in Brittany, Wales and Scotland shaped the development of their societies and governmental systems. Historical interpretations of Henry's reign have changed considerably over time. In the 18th century, scholars argued that Henry was a driving force in the creation of a genuinely English monarchy and, ultimately, a unified Britain. During the Victorian expansion of the British Empire, historians were keenly interested in the formation of Henry's own empire, but they also expressed concern over his private life and treatment of Becket. Late-20th-century historians have combined British and French historical accounts of Henry, challenging earlier Anglo-centric interpretations of his reign.\n\nHenry married Eleanor d'AQUITAINE Queen of England [35157]. Eleanor was born in 1121 in Nantes Loire-Atlantique Pays de la Loire France and died on 1 Apr 1204 in Poitiers Poitou-Charentes France at age 83.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia says of Eleanor,\n\nEleanor of Aquitaine (1122 \\endash 1 April 1204) (French: Aliénor d'Aquitaine, pronounced ['a?li.??'n?? 'da?ki'ten]) was Queen of France from 1137 to 1152 as the consort of King Louis VII,[1] Queen of England from 1154 to 1189 as the wife of King Henry II, and Duchess of Aquitaine in her own right from 1137 until her death in 1204. As the heir of the House of Poitiers, rulers in southwestern France, she was one of the wealthiest and most powerful women in western Europe during the High Middle Ages. She was patron of literary figures such as Wace, Benoît de Sainte-Maure, and Bernart de Ventadorn. She led armies several times in her life and was a leader of the Second Crusade.\n\nEleanor was the daughter of William X, Duke of Aquitaine. She became duchess upon her father's death in April 1137, and three months later she married Louis, son of her guardian King Louis VI of France. Days after the wedding, her husband acceded as the French king. They had two daughters, Marie and Alix. As queen of France, Eleanor participated in the unsuccessful Second Crusade. Soon afterwards, she sought an annulment of her marriage,[2] but her request was rejected by Pope Eugene III.[3] Eventually, Louis agreed to an annulment, as 15 years of marriage had not produced a son.[4] The marriage was annulled on 21 March 1152 on the grounds of consanguinity within the fourth degree. Their daughters were declared legitimate, custody was awarded to Louis, and Eleanor's lands were restored to her.\n\nAs soon as the annulment was granted, Eleanor became engaged to her third cousin Henry, Duke of Normandy. The couple married on Whitsun, 18 May 1152. Henry and Eleanor became king and queen of England in 1154. They had five sons and three daughters. However, Henry and Eleanor eventually became estranged. Henry imprisoned her in 1173 for supporting the revolt of their eldest son, Henry, against him. She was not released until 6 July 1189, when her husband died and their third son, Richard I, ascended the throne. As queen dowager, Eleanor acted as regent while Richard went on the Third Crusade. She lived well into the reign of her youngest son, John.\n\nChildren from this marriage were:\n\n170 i. Comte William IX PLANTAGENET de Poitiers [122802] was born on 17 Aug 1153 in Rouen Seine-Maritime Haute-Normandie France, died in Apr 1156 in Wallingford Berkshire England at age 2, and was buried in Reading Abbey Reading Berkshire England.\n\n171 ii. King Henry PLANTAGENET of England [122803] was born on 28 Feb 1155 in London Middlesex England and died on 11 Jun 1183 in Lot Aquitaine France at age 28.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia says,\n\nHenry the Young King (28 February 1155 \\endash 11 June 1183) was the eldest surviving son of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine. Beginning in 1170, he was titular King of England, Duke of Normandy, Count of Anjou and Maine. Henry the Young King was the only English king since the Norman Conquest to be crowned during his father's reign, but was frustrated by his father's refusal to grant him meaningful autonomous power.[1][2] He died aged 28, six years before his father, leaving his brother Richard to become the next king\n\n172 iii. Duchess Matilda PLANTAGENET of Saxony [122804] was born in Jun 1156 in Windsor Berkshire England, died on 28 Jun 1189 in Brunswick Saxony at age 33, and was buried in Brunswick Cathedral Brunswick Saxony.\n\n173 iv. King Richard I \"The Lion Heart\" PLANTAGENET of England [122805] was born on 8 Sep 1157 in Oxford Oxfordshire England, died on 6 Apr 1199 in Châlus Duchy of Aquitaine France at age 41, and was buried in Fontrevault Maine-et-Loire France.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia says, along with very much more,\n\nRichard I (8 September 1157 \\endash 6 April 1199) was King of England from 1189 until his death in 1199. He also ruled as Duke of Normandy, Aquitaine and Gascony, Lord of Cyprus, and Count of Poitiers, Anjou, Maine, and Nantes, and was overlord of Brittany at various times during the same period. He was the third of five sons of King Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine and seemed unlikely to become king, but all his brothers except the youngest, John, predeceased their father. Richard is known as Richard Cur de Lion (Norman French: Le quor de lion) or Richard the Lionheart because of his reputation as a great military leader and warrior.[1] The troubadour Bertran de Born also called him Richard Oc-e-Non (Occitan for Yes and No), possibly from a reputation for terseness.[2]\n\nBy the age of 16, Richard had taken command of his own army, putting down rebellions in Poitou against his father.[1] Richard was an important Christian commander during the Third Crusade, leading the campaign after the departure of Philip II of France and achieving considerable victories against his Muslim counterpart, Saladin, although he finalized a peace treaty and ended the campaign without retaking Jerusalem.[3]\n\nRichard probably spoke both French and Occitan.[4] He was born in England, where he spent his childhood; before becoming king, however, he lived most of his adult life in the Duchy of Aquitaine, in the southwest of France. Following his accession, he spent very little time, perhaps as little as six months, in England. Most of his life as king was spent on Crusade, in captivity, or actively defending his lands in France. Rather than regarding his kingdom as a responsibility requiring his presence as ruler, he has been perceived as preferring to use it merely as a source of revenue to support his armies.[5] Nevertheless, he was seen as a pious hero by his subjects.[6] He remains one of the few kings of England remembered more commonly by his epithet than his regnal number, and is an enduring iconic figure both in England and in France.\n\n+ 174 v. Duke Geoffrey II PLANTAGENET of Brittany [122806] was born on 23 Sep 1158 in Oxford Oxfordshire England, died on 19 Aug 1186 in Paris Isle-de-France France at age 27, and was buried in Cathedral of Notre Dame Paris Isle-de-France France.\n\n175 vi. Prince Philip PLANTAGENET of England [123081] was born about 1160 in Oxford Oxfordshire England and died on 7 Jan 1163 in Oxford Oxfordshire England aged about 3.\n\n+ 176 vii. Queen Consort Eleanor PLANTAGENET of Castile [81991] was born on 13 Oct 1161 in Domfront en Poiraie Orne Basse-Normandy France, died on 25 Oct 1214 in Burgos Castile & Leon Spain at age 53, and was buried in Abbey of Santa Maria la Real de Huelgas Burgos Castile Spain.\n\n177 viii. Queen Joan PLANTAGENET of Sicily [122807] was born in Oct 1165 in Anjou Isère Auvergne-Rhone-Alpes France, died on 4 Sep 1199 in Fontrevault Maine-et-Loire France at age 33, and was buried in Abbaye de Fontrevault Fontrevault Maine-et-Loire France.\n\n+ 178 ix. John PLANTAGENET King Of England [35158] was born on 24 Dec 1166 in Oxford Oxfordshire England, died on 18 Oct 1216 in Newark Nottinghamshire England at age 49, and was buried in The Quire Worcester Cathedral Worcester Worcestershire England.\n\nHenry next married Rosamund de CLIFFORD [82055]. Marriage status: mistress. Rosamund was born in 1136.\n\nThe child from this marriage was:\n\n+ 179 i. 3rd Earl William LONGESPEE of Salisbury [82053] was born about 1176 in Salisbury Wiltshire England and died on 7 Mar 1226 in Salisbury Wiltshire England aged about 50.\n\nHenry next married UNKNOWN [122808]. Marriage status: mistress.\n\nThe child from this marriage was:\n\n180 i. Archbishop Geoffrey PLANTAGENET of York [122809] was born about 1152 and died on 12 Dec 1212 in Normandy France aged about 60.\n\nGeneral Notes: Wikipedia says of this Geoffrey, along with much more,\n\nGeoffrey[a] (c. 1152 \\endash 12 December 1212) was an illegitimate son of Henry II, King of England, who became bishop-elect of Lincoln and archbishop of York. The identity of his mother is uncertain, but she may have been named Ykenai. Geoffrey held several minor clerical offices before becoming Bishop of Lincoln in 1173, though he was not ordained as a priest until 1189. In 1173\\endash 1174, he led a campaign in northern England to help put down a rebellion by his legitimate half-brothers; this campaign led to the capture of William, King of Scots. By 1182, Pope Lucius III had ordered that Geoffrey either resign Lincoln or be consecrated as bishop; he chose to resign and became Chancellor instead. He was the only one of Henry II's sons present at the king's death.\n\nGeoffrey's half-brother Richard I nominated him archbishop of York after succeeding to the throne of England, probably to force him to become a priest and thus eliminate a potential rival for the throne. After some dispute Geoffrey was consecrated archbishop in 1191. He soon became embroiled in a conflict with William Longchamp, Richard's regent in England, after being detained at Dover on his return to England following his consecration in France. Geoffrey claimed sanctuary in the town, but he was seized by agents of Longchamp and briefly imprisoned in Dover Castle. Subsequently, a council of magnates ordered Longchamp out of office, and Geoffrey was able to proceed to his archdiocese. The archbishop spent much of his archiepiscopate in various disputes with his half-brothers: first Richard and then John, who succeeded to the English throne in 1199. Geoffrey also quarrelled with his suffragan bishops, his cathedral chapter, and other clergy in his diocese. His last quarrel with John was in 1207, when the archbishop refused to allow the collection of a tax and was driven into exile in France. He died there five years later.\n\n134.

Like his father, Richard fitz Gilbert has since become commonly known by his nickname Strongbow (Norman French: Arc-Fort), which may be a mistranscription or mistranslation of \"Striguil\".\n\nHis son Gilbert de Striguil (or de Strigoil) died unmarried before 1189 and the earldom passed via Richard's daughter Isabel to her spouse William Marshall.\n\nRichard married UNKNOWN [122913].
