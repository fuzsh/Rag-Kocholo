        "text": "William the Lion, 1143-1214: Kingship and Culture\n\nOwen, D.D.R.\n\nSoftcover. Condition: Good. 1st Paperback Edition. This biography reviews the known facts of the life of William the Lion, Scotland&apos;s longest reigning king, and presents them within the broad context of the country&apos;s early history and culture. While much of the story centres on the often brittle relationship with the English Plantagenets, Scotland emerges as a European power, respected not least for its now largely forgotten cultural flowering. This is demonstrated in the later chapters by an examination of a body of hiterto undervalued texts, notably a skit on the Grail legend. Set in Scotland, the romance was probably composed by a St Andrews&apos; bishop for the court circle, and can claim to be the country&apos;s earliest surviving vernacular work. This interdisciplinary approach, by juxtaposing established facts with literary interpretations, offers historians and the general reader with a new and more rounded view of both the domestic conditions and the reputation abroad of William the Lion&apos;s Scotland. D.D.R. Owen is the author of &quot;Eleanor of Aquitaine: Queen and Legend&quot;. Seller Inventory # SONG1862320055"
