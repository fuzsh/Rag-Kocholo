Certainly England and the English people ought to have stood in the forefront and to have been treated in the fullest detail, if this book were intended for a history of Richardâs reign; but it has been written with no such intention. It is merely an attempt to sketch, from materials of which some of the most valuable and interesting have become accessible to students only within a comparatively recent period, the life-story of a prince who reigned less than ten years and lived less than forty-two, yet whose personal character, peculiar circumstances, and adventurous career have given himâwhether deservedly or notâa conspicuous place in mediÃ¦val history, and made him a hero of romance in every country from England to Palestine.\n\nThe only detailed biography of Richard known to me is that which Mr. G. P. R. James wrote many years ago. A wealth of material unknown at that time has since then been placed within our reach. This is especially the case with regard to the Crusade of 1191-1192. Richardâs struggle with Saladin is the phase of his career which has contributed the most to his fame; and my studies have led me to believe that he himself regarded it as the most important work of his life. Every step in his policy from the hour when he took [vi] the Cross till he set out for Holy Land appears to have been taken primarily, if not solely, with a view to the one enterprise which his contemporaries emphatically called âthe work of Godâ; and there is no reason to doubt that when compelled to leave that work unfinished, he left it with the full intention of returning to complete it, and would have returned, had not his destiny been ordained otherwise. I have therefore allowed myself to tell the story of the Crusade with a fullness of detail which may be thought disproportionate to the brief space of time which the expedition actually occupied, and to its direct influence on the history of his dominions; and I have made a lavish use of the materials, Eastern and Western, contained in the publications of the various French literary and historical societies, especially the great Recueil des Historiens des Croisades. The chief treasure in that collectionâchief, at least, for my purposeâis the elaborate edition of Bohadin with its French translation, superseding the crabbed Latin of Schultens; although, as will be seen, I cannot but think that Schultensâs work still retains a value of its own. Of the relations between the two versions of our chief Western authority for the story of the Crusadeâthe Itinerarium Peregrinorum et Gesta Regis Ricardi and the Estoire de la Guerre Sainte par AmbroiseâI made, about fourteen years ago, a somewhat minute study based on the notes written by Mr. T. A. Archer in the margins of his copies of those two books; I having had the melancholy pleasure of becoming their owner after his death. The results of that study, with a brief statement of the circumstances which had impelled me to it and assisted me in it, appeared in the English Historical Review for July 1910. After going over the ground again I see no reason to alter the conclusion which I had then formed on the subject; rather do I find myself confirmed in that opinion. I have, however, thought it right, when citing either or both of the two versions, to give in every case a separate reference to each of them.\n\nKate Norgate.\n\nJanuary, 1924.\n\n[vii]\n\nCONTENTS\n\nBOOK I RICHARD OF AQUITAINE, 1157-1189 CHAPTER I PAGE THE BOY DUKE, 1157-1179 1 CHAPTER II FATHER AND SONS, 1179-1183 32 CHAPTER III KING HENRYâS HEIR, 1183-1189 57 BOOK II RICHARDâS CRUSADE, 1189-1192 CHAPTER I THE YEAR OF PREPARATION, 1189-1190 91 CHAPTER II THE OUTWARD VOYAGE, 1190-1191 119 CHAPTER III THE FALL OF ACRE, 1191 152 CHAPTER IV FROM ACRE TO JOPPA, 1191 176 CHAPTER V [viii] THE ADVANCE ON JERUSALEM, 1191-1192 193 CHAPTER VI RICHARD AND SALADIN, 1192 230 BOOK III RICHARD AND EUROPE, 1192-1199 CHAPTER I RICHARD AND THE EMPIRE, 1192-1194 264 CHAPTER II RICHARD AND FRANCE, 1194-1199 294 NOTES I.

(Geoffrey of Vigeois, A.D. 1185).\n\nCHAPTER I\n\nTHE BOY DUKE\n\n1157-1179\n\nBonum est viro cum portaverit jugum adolescentia sua.\n\n1157\n\nâThe eagle of the broken covenant shall rejoice in her third nestingââthus ran one of the predictions in the so-called âprophecy of Merlin,â which in the latter half of the twelfth century was generally regarded as shadowing forth the destiny of Henry Fitz-Empress and his family. âThe queen,â said those who interpreted the prophecy after the event, âis called the eagle of the broken covenant because she spread out her wings over two realms, France and England, but was separated from the one by divorce and from the other by long imprisonment. And whereas her first-born son, William, died in infancy, and the second, Henry, in rebellion against his father, Richard, the son of her third nesting, strove in all things to bring glory to his motherâs name.â[1]\n\n[2] 1157\n\nThere was nothing to mar the rejoicing of either Eleanor or Henry in September 1157. The young king had overcome the difficulties which had beset him at the opening of his reign. Public order and the regular administration of public justice had been restored throughout his realm. He had obtained the French kingâs recognition of his rights over Normandy and the Angevin lands, and also over Eleanorâs duchy of Aquitaine,[2] where in the winter of 1156 he had received the homage of the barons and kept the Christmas festival with her at Bordeaux.[3] King and queen 1157 returned to England in the spring.[4] Soon afterwards the last remnant of opposition to the rule of the Angevin king in England had been disarmed in the persons of Earl Hugh of Norfolk and Count William of Boulogne; Henry had âsubdued all the Welsh to his will,â[5] and received, together with the homage of Malcolm of Scotland, a formal restitution of Northumberland, Westmorland and Cumberland,[6] which had been in the possession of the Scots since 1136. From these successes Henry had either just returned, or was on his way back to rejoin his queen at Oxford, when their third son was born thereâno doubt in Beaumont palaceâon September 8.[7] A woman of S. Albanâs was chosen for the boyâs nurse and fostered him together with her own son, born on the same night and afterwards known as Alexander Neckam,[8] author of a treatise on natural science or what passed for science in his time. Her name was Hodierna; in later days she had from the royal domains in Chippenham an annuity of seven pounds, doubtless granted to her by her royal nursling, whom she seems to have survived by some twenty years.[9] Whether she dwelt [3] 1157 at the court while he was under her charge, or whether, like his ancestor Geoffrey Martel, he was sent to dwell with his foster-mother, there is nothing to show. Before he was two years old his destiny was planned by the king; Richard was to be heir to the dominions of his mother.\n\nâAquitaine,â says an English writer of the time, âabounding in riches of many kinds, excels other parts of the western world in such wise that it is reckoned by historians as one of the happiest and most fertile among the provinces of Gaul. Although its fields respond abundantly to culture, its vines to propagation, and its woodlands to the chase, yet nevertheless it takes its name not from any of these advantages, but from its waters (aquÃ¦), haply esteeming as alone worthy of account among its delights that which its health-giving water brings forth either to be returned to the sea, or uplifted in the air. If, indeed, we track the Garonne from its fount along its rapid course to the sea, and if we also follow the line of the Pyrenean mountains, all the country that lies between derives its name from the beneficent waters that flow through it. Furthermore, in those parts smoothness of tongue is so general that it promises impunity to everybody, and any one who knows not the manner of that people cannot know whether they are more constant in deed than in word. When they set themselves to tame the pride of their enemies, they do it in earnest; and when the labours of battle are over and they settle down to rest in peace, they give themselves up wholly to pleasure.â[10]\n\nWhatever may be thought of Dean Ralphâs etymology, there was an element of truth in his description, half jesting though it seems to be, of the country and the character of its people. He gives indeed hardly sufficient prominence to the pugnacious side of the latter; and the boundaries [4] 1157 which he assigns to the former are considerably narrower than those of the duchy of Aquitaine as it stood at the time of Richardâs birth. That duchy comprised, in theory at least, fully one-third of the kingdom of France. As counts of Poitou its dukes bore direct sway over a territory bounded on the north by Britanny, Anjou, and Touraine, on the west by the sea from the bay now known as that of Bourgneuf to the mouth of the Charente, and on the east (roughly) by the course of the river Creuse from a little distance below Argenton to its junction with the Vienne; and also over the dependent district of Saintonge on the north side of the estuary of the Garonne, or Gironde. As counts of Gascony they were overlords of a number of lesser counties and lordships, extending from the mouth of the Garonne to the Pyrenees, and forming a territory nearly twice the size of Poitou. Between Poitou and Gascony lay the counties of AngoulÃªme, La Marche, and PÃ©rigord, and, between the two latter, a cluster of minor fiefs which collectively formed the district known as the Limousin, and of which the most important was the viscounty of Limoges. All these had from early times owned the overlordship of the Poitevin counts in their ducal capacity. So, too, had Berry, an extensive district lying to the north of La Marche. The north-eastern portion of Berry, which formed the viscounty of Bourges, had, however, for a long time past been lost to the dukes and reckoned as part of the Royal Domain of France. On the eastern and south-eastern borders of the duchy lay the counties of Auvergne and Toulouse. Toulouse, with its dependenciesâthe Quercy or county of Cahors, Alby, Foix, Carcassonne, Cerdagne and Roussillonâhad always been a separate fief held directly of the Crown; but the right to its ownership had for the last sixty years been in dispute between the Poitevin counts and its actual holders, the house of St. Gilles, who also held the neighbouring county of Rouergue and with it the overlordship of a number of smaller fiefs along the southern coast. Auvergne, originally a part of the Aquitanian duchy, was strongly disposed to reject the authority of the Poitevin dukes; and both Auvergne and Toulouse were more or less openly [5] 1157 supported in this matter by the French king. Nor were the other underfiefs of the duchy, or even the barons of Poitou, by any means models of feudal obedience. For a century or more the dukes had been periodically at strife with the counts of AngoulÃªme, the counts of La Marche, the lords of Lusignan (in Poitou), the viscounts of Limoges, and the neighbours and rivals of these last.[11] It was little more than twenty years since Count William of AngoulÃªme had carried off from Poitiers Eleanorâs stepmother, the Countess Emma, âby the counsel of the chiefs of the Limousin who feared lest the Poitevin yoke should be laid more heavily upon themâ owing to her marriage with the duke, she being a daughter and a possible co-heiress of the viscount of Limoges.[12] At Limoges itself, moreover, there seems to have been a perennial rivalry between the bishop, the viscount, the abbot of the great abbey of S. Martial, and the townsfolk.[13]\n\nWhen Henry II went to Limoges after his marriage in 1152 he seems to have been welcomed as duke by the viscount; but strife arose between his followers and the citizens which so enraged him that he ordered the recently built walls of the town to be razed and the bridge to be destroyed. As the townâlocally called âthe castleââwas held by the viscount of the abbot, this was an offence to all parties at once; and the abbot retorted by refusing to grant the dukeâs claim to a procuration in the cityâthat [6] 1157 is, outside the wallsâsaying he was only bound to grant it within the enclosure of the âcastle.â[14] Henry, though angry, had his mind fixed on more important matters, and let the insult pass; but on his next visit to Limoges, in 1156 1156, he successfully asserted his ducal rights.[15] In the spring or early summer of 1159 he again went to Aquitaine, 1159 to prosecute by force of arms his claim, as Eleanorâs husband, to the county of Toulouse. The support of the Count of Barcelona and his wife, the Queen of Aragon, was purchased by a promise that Richard should wed their infant daughter and should on his marriage receive the Dukedom of Aquitaine.[16] The Quercy was conquered by Henry and held for him awhile after he had abandoned the siege of Toulouse and returned to Normandy. A treaty made between 1160 Henry and Louis of France in May 1160 contained a provision for a yearâs truce between Henry and Raymond of Toulouse, during which Henry was to keep âwhatever he at the date of the treaty had of the honour of Toulouse, Cahors, or Quercy.â[17] This was probably not much, as his troops had already been withdrawn from the conquered territory; the greater part of it seems to have fallen back into Raymondâs hands, and we hear nothing more of the relations between him and Henry for nearly thirteen years.\n\nWhere and how the future duke of Aquitaine was being brought up there is nothing to show. All that we know about him, till he was well advanced in his thirteenth year, [7] 1160 is that the sheriffs of London paid ten pounds six and eightpence for his travelling expenses on some occasionâprobably 1163 his elder brotherâs birthday feastâin 1163,[18] and that in May 1165 he went with his mother and eldest sister 1165-6 to join the king in Normandy.[19] Henryâs quarrel with S. Thomas of Canterbury was then at its height; and Henryâs discontented subjects in Aquitaine were quick to take advantage of the opportunity for mischief given them by the difficulties with France in which that quarrel involved him. On the pretext of âcertain liberties whereof he had deprived themâ some of them became so troublesomeâchiefly, it seems, by their intrigues with King Louis[20]âthat 1166 in November 1166 he summoned them to a conference at Chinon. It took place on Sunday, November 19,[21] with so little result that he sent Eleanor, who had apparently been trying to maintain order in the duchy during his absence, back to England and himself went to keep Christmas at Poitiers.[22] Whether Richard went with his mother or stayed with his father does not appear.\n\n1167\n\nIn March Henry had a conference with Raymond of Toulouse at Grandmont. Shortly afterwards he tried to assert his ducal authority over the count of Auvergne. The only result was a fresh rupture with Louis,[23] which was temporarily patched up by a truce made in August to last till Easter next, March 31, 1168.[24] Before that date a formidable rebellion broke out in Aquitaine. The counts 1167-8 of AngoulÃªme and La Marche,[25] the viscount of Thouars,[26] [8] 1167-8 Robert of Seilhac in the Limousin and his brother Hugh,[27] Aimeric of Lusignan in Poitou, Geoffrey of Rancogne in the 1168 county of AngoulÃªme,[28] âwith many others,â sought to rebel against the king, and went about ravaging with fire and sword. When the king heard of this he hurried to the place, took the strong castle of Lusignan and made it stronger still, and destroyed the villages and fortresses of the rebels. He then revictualled his own castles, and left the duchy under the charge of Eleanor (who had rejoined him after Christmas) and of Earl Patrick of Salisbury, while he himself went to meet Louis on the Norman border on April 7.[29] The truce between the kings was now expired, and Henry desired a treaty of peace; but meanwhile the southern rebels were urging Louis to insist that Henry should indemnify them for the loss and damage which he had inflicted upon them, and which they represented as a breach of his truce with France, the French king being supreme lord of Aquitaine.[30] They even placed in the hands of Louis the hostages which they had promised to Henry.[31] Louis did not go to the conference in person, but sent some nobles to represent him.[32] To them Henry proposed a new scheme for the future of Aquitaine: that its young duke-designate should marry the youngest daughter of Louis. The French envoys refused to bind their sovereign [9] 1168 to this unexpected condition; it was, however, agreed âthat if Richard should ask for his rights over the Count of St. Gillesââthat is, of Toulouseââthe king of France should try the cause in his court.â Thus the settlement of Aquitaine on Richard was, by implication at least, recognized by France, although Richard himself was not yet eleven years old. As to the aggrieved nobles, Henry promised them restitution;[33] but Louis would not give up the hostages; and the conference ended in another truce to last till the octave of midsummer.[34]\n\nScarcely had the parties separated when tidings came that Earl Patrick had been slain in a fight with some of the malcontents.[35] Henry was too much overburdened with other cares to attempt during the rest of that year any personal intervention in Aquitaine. Eleanor seems to have urged him to make it formally over to Richard.[36] She probably saw that there was no likelihood of a good understanding between her people and her Angevin husband, and hoped to be more successful in governing them herself in the name of her son. Her suggestion, and that which Henry had made nine months before to the representatives 1169 of Louis, were both carried into effect on January 6, 1169, when the two kings made peace at Montmirail. The two elder sons of Henry and Eleanor were both present at the meeting. Henry himself first did homage to Louis for his continental possessions; young Henry did the like for Britanny, Anjou and Maine; then Richard was betrothed to the French kingâs daughter Aloysia, and likewise performed the homage due to Louis for the county of Poitou and the duchy of Aquitaine.[37]\n\nThe feudal situation created by these transactions was a strange one. It was capable of at least two different [10] 1169 interpretations, and its practical result, so far as Aquitaine was concerned, was that for the next twenty years there were two dukes of that country. Henryâs purpose in thus making his sons do homage to Louis was to guard against the possibility of dispute, after his own death, as to the portion of his dominions to which each of them was entitled. In his eyes the homage was anticipatory of a future and perhapsâfor he was not yet thirty-sixâstill very remote event, and its effect was merely prospective. But, so far as can be seen, no such limitation of its scope was expressed in the act of homage; and the legal effect of that act therefore was not merely prospective, but immediate; it at once made the younger Henry and Richard respectively count of Anjou and duke of Aquitaine, not under the suzerainty of their father, but under the direct overlordship of the French king. Such at least would be its legal effect as soon as the boys were old enough to govern for themselves; and this age young Henry had almost reached, for he was in his fourteenth year. Their father, on the other hand, as the sequel shows, never intended to give during his own lifetime any real authority at all to young Henry, nor did he intend to give any to Richard otherwise than with a tacit but perfectly well understood reservation of his own right of intervention and control whenever he might choose to exercise it; and he still remained legally both count and duke, for he had just repeated, in both capacities, his own homage to Louis. There can be no doubt that Louis was fully alive (although it seems that Henry was not) to the advantages which the French Crown might derive from this complicated state of affairs. But he was, of course, not desirous of pointing them out to his rival; and during the next four years he carefully refrained from all interference with the affairs of the Angevin dominions. The new duke of Aquitaine was, however, not yet twelve years old, and it was clearly with the French kingâs sanction that his father, in the spring, marched into the duchy and forcibly brought the counts of AngoulÃªme and La Marche and most of the other rebels to submission.[38]\n\n[11] 1169\n\nOur only certain notice of Richard between January 1169 and June 1172 shows him to have been, at some time in 1170 1170, at Limoges with his mother, laying the foundation-stone of the abbey of S. Augustine.[39] On the Octave of 1172 Whit-Sunday, June 11, 1172, his formal installation as duke took place at Poitiers. In the abbey church of S. Hilary he was placed, according to custom, in the abbotâs chair, and the sacred lance and banner which were the insignia of the ducal office were given to him by the Archbishop of Bordeaux and the Bishop of Poitiers. He afterwards proceeded to Limoges, where he was received with a solemn procession; the ring of S. Valeria, the protomartyr of Aquitaine, was placed on his finger, and he was then proclaimed as âthe new Dukeâ[40]âfor it was in virtue of this double investiture, given not by the king of France, but by the local prelates and clergy as representatives of the local saints of the land, that the dukes of Aquitaine claimed to hold their dukedom.\n\nEight months later another important ceremony took place at Limoges. Henry and Eleanor, accompanied by their two elder sons, held court in the castle for a week with the kings of Aragon and Navarre, and the counts of Toulouse and Maurienne. Alfonso of Aragon, Raymond of Toulouse, and Humbert of Maurienne had met Henry at Montferrand in Auvergne, the last-named to make a treaty of marriage between his daughter and Henryâs youngest 1173 son, John, the two former to seek the kingâs mediation in a quarrel between themselves. Alfonso was the son of Queen Petronilla and Raymond of Barcelona, and brother of the girl to whom Richard had been betrothed in 1159. He and Raymond of Toulouse were at strife about the homage of Cerdagne, Foix, and Carcassonne; both were anxious for the friendship of their nearest and most powerful neighbour. [12] 1173 Henry âmade peace between them,â and Raymond, whose territories were ringed in by those of Aragon and Aquitaine, paid the peacemaker his price; âhe became the man of the king, and of the new king his son, and of Count Richard of Poitou, to hold Toulouse of themââthat is, to hold it immediately of Richard, who held it under his elder brother and his fatherââas a hereditary fief, by military service at the summons of either king or count, and by a yearly payment of a hundred marks of silver or of ten destriers worth at least ten marks each.â[41]\n\nA few months later Richard entered actively on public life; and he made a bad beginning. Towards the end of March the younger King Henry fled from his fatherâs court in Normandy to that of Louis.[42] The elder Henry had been warned at Limoges by Raymond of Toulouse that âhis wife and his sons had formed a conspiracy against himâ;[43] but he had disregarded the warning, and left Richard and [13] 1173 Geoffrey in Aquitaine under the guardianship of their mother. Early in the summer both the lads joined their elder brother in France,[44] and all three pledged themselves by a solemn oath, at a great council in Paris, ânot to forsake the king of France, nor to make any peace with their father save through him (Louis) and the French baronsâ; Louis in return swearing, and causing his barons to swear, âthat he would help the young king and his brothers, to the utmost of his power, to maintain their war against their father and to gain possession of the kingdom of Englandâ for young Henry.[45]\n\nThe âyoung kingâ was eighteen years old; he was as shallow-minded and selfish as he was handsome and superficially attractive; and he had fallen under the influence of Louis, to whose daughter he was married. Crowned in 1170 as his fatherâs heir, he chose to consider himself aggrieved by being given no share in the government of England or of the Angevin home-lands. He may have persuaded his brothers to consider themselves as victims of a similar grievance with regard to their duchies of Aquitaine and Britanny. He and Louis were naturally anxious to secure the forces of those two duchies in support of their scheme of ousting the elder King Henry from his dominions, continental and insular; and they hoped that the example of the boy-dukes might help to detach their respective vassals from their fatherâs cause.[46] But the lads had a nearer counsellor than young Henry or Louis, and one to whose counsels it was only natural, and in a measure right, that they should listen with reverence and submission. Eleanor unquestionably sided with her elder son against her husband, for she was caught in the act of trying to make her way from Aquitaine to the French court disguised in the dress of a man.[47] Certainly nothing can justify, or even excuse, the duplicity of this âeagle of the broken covenantâ towards the husband and sovereign who, even when his eyes were fully opened to the treason of their eldest son, still put such confidence in her loyalty [14] 1173 as to leave the younger eaglets in her charge. But there is a very considerable excuse for Richard and Geoffrey. On the ground of that feudal loyalty which was a principle of such importance in the life of those days, there was, indeed, something to be said for all three of the brothers, and more especially for Richard. None of them were homagers of Henry II; all of them were homagers of Louis and of Louis alone. For Richard it might further be urged that if he was under any other feudal obligation, it was more to his mother than to his father; his possession of Aquitaine was their joint gift, but it was on Eleanorâs consent that the validity of the gift really rested; Henry possessed the dukedom only in right of his wife. On the higher ground of filial duty Henryâs and Eleanorâs claims to the obedience of their children were equal; Richard and Geoffrey suddenly found that those claims were conflicting, and that a choice must be made between the two. That the choice really lay between right and wrong is much plainer to us than it could be to these lads, of whom the elder was not yet sixteen, and both of whom were under the direct personal influence of their mother. On her, rather than on them, lies the responsibility for their wrong choice.\n\nEleanor, captured by some of her husbandâs scouts, was at once placed by him in strict confinement.[48] Her eldest sonâs cause gained practically nothing by the adhesion of his young brothers. According to one account, both of them accompanied him to the siege of Drincourt in July.[49] The success of that siege, however, was due, not to any of the three, but to their allies the counts of Flanders and Boulogne; moreover, the death of the latter soon afterwards caused the Flemish troops to withdraw to their own country, and nothing further came of the expedition.[50] The rebel barons of Geoffreyâs duchy all submitted to his father in the autumn.[51] At a conference on September 25 at Gisors Henry made fair offers to all three of his sons; âbut the [15] 1173 king of France did not deem it advisable that the [English] kingâs sons should make peace with their father.â[52] At some time before the end of the year Richard was knighted by Louis.[53] Young Henry and Geoffrey seem to have remained at the French court through the winter, but Richard characteristically went his own way; he returned to Aquitaine. Considering the extent of that country and the character of its previous relations with Henry II, it seems to have furnished a very small proportion of names to the list of avowed partizans of the young king; and the more important Aquitanian names which we do find there are those of men whose disobedience is very unlikely to have been in any way connected with that of RichardâCount William of AngoulÃªme, Geoffrey of Rancogne, Geoffrey and Guy of Lusignan, William of Chauvigny, and Thomas of Coulonges in Poitou, Charles of Rochefort in Saintonge, Robert of BlÃ© in the Limousin, and in Gascony Jocelyn of Maulay and Archbishop William of Bordeaux.[54] The first four of these needed no incitement from the young dukeâs example, and the last two are not likely to have been influenced by it, to throw off their allegiance to his father. The Aquitanian rebels in 1173 would probably have been more numerous had not the barons of the Limousin been at that time too busy fighting among themselves to give much heed to disagreements between their rival rulers. The confusion in those parts was aggravated by a swarm of âBrabantines,â or foreign mercenaries,[55] probably brought in by Henry at an earlier time, and now roving about the land and preying on it wholly at their own will and pleasure. There was no one to control either Brabantines or barons, since Richardâs withdrawal and Eleanorâs imprisonment had left Aquitaine without any resident governor at all, till in the winter Richard went back to put himself single-handed at the head of affairs. We hear of him as far south as Bordeaux, where he was no doubt sure of a welcome from Archbishop William, and secured the support of another great churchman, the abbot of S. Cross, by confirming the [16] 1173 privileges of the abbey.[56] He tried to win to his cause the rising town of La Rochelle; but in this he failed; the townsfolk shut their gates in his face.[57] He soon, however, had under his command a considerable force of knights which 1174 c. May 12 at Whitsuntide 1174 seized the city of Saintes. Henry was then at Poitiers; at the head of a body of loyal Poitevins he marched upon Saintes and drove out the intruders,[58] and recovered possession of several other rebel fortresses.[59] The hopes of young Henry and Louis had broken down both in Aquitaine and in Normandy. In England they broke down still more completely; and the failure of the rebellion there led to the reopening of negotiations for peace.\n\nSome ten or fifteen years later a bitter enemy of Henry II described the characters of young Henry and of Richard both at once in the form of a comparison, or rather contrast, between them.[60] The contrast showed itself even in the ill-omened first stage of their political and military careers. Throughout the rebellion of 1173-4 the young king was a mere toolâand a very inefficient oneâin the hands of Louis. At the instigation of Louis he had entered upon the war, and at the dictation of Louis he was ready to accept terms of peace. Geoffrey was apparently contented with a similar position; but not so Richard. Eleanor might have made a tool of her second son, but no one else could do so. It was not for love of either young Henry or Louis that he had sided with them, and not at their behest 1174 Sept. 8 would he give up the struggle. On his seventeenth birthday the kings met at Gisors; but âthey could not come to a settlement because of the absence of Count Richard, who at that time was in Poitou, making war on the castles and men of his father.â The conference ended in a truce till [17] 1174 Michaelmas,[61] on the understanding that meanwhile Henry should subdue Richard by force without hindrance from Louis, young Henry, or their adherents. Richard was not yet hardened enough to contemplate fighting his father in person; âwhen King Henry was come into Poitou, his son Richard dared not await him, but fled from every place at his approach, abandoning all the fortresses that he had taken, not daring to hold them against his father.â When he learned the terms of the truce, his indignation at being thus deserted by his supposed allies made him suddenly determine on a better course. âHe came weeping, and fell with his face on the ground at the feet of the king his Sept. 23 father, beseeching his forgiveness.â It was granted instantly and completely.[62] Father and son re-entered Poitiers together.[63] At Henryâs suggestion Richard went in person to assure his elder brother and Louis that he was no longer an obstacle to the conclusion of peace; and on September 30 the peace was made at Montlouis in Touraine. Henryâs three sons placed themselves at his mercy and âreturned to him and to his service as their lord.â He promised to each of them a specified provision; and they all pledged themselves to accept these provisions as final and nevermore to require anything further from him save at his own pleasure, nor to withdraw themselves or their service from him. Richard and Geoffrey also did homage to him âfor what he granted and gave them.â Young Henry would have done likewise, but his father would not permit it âbecause he was a king.â[64] This treaty seems to have been afterwards put into writing and formally executed at Falaise, probably on October 11.[65] 1175 Early in 1175 Richard and Geoffrey did homage to their father again at Le Mans,[66] and on April 1 their elder brother did the same at Bures.[67]\n\nThe new provision for Richard did not include his reinstatement as duke of Aquitaine or count of Poitou. It consisted [18] 1175 merely of âtwo fitting dwelling-places, whence no damage could come to the king, in Poitou,â and half the revenues of that county in money.[68] The strict letter of the treaty of Montlouis (or of Falaise) in fact reinstated Henry II as sole ruler of all the Angevin dominions, and reduced all his sons to the position of dependents on his bounty. Henry, however, soon showed that he had no intention of enforcing this punishment to the uttermost on Richard and Geoffrey. The treaty ordained that all lands and castles belonging to the king and his loyal barons were to be restored to their owners and to the condition in which they had been fifteen days before âthe kingâs sons departed from himâ; so, too, were the lands of the rebels, but in their case no mention was made of their castles.[69] With these castles, therefore, Henry was left free to deal at his pleasure. Accordingly, when early in 1175 he set himself to carry out this clause of the treaty in Anjou and Maine, he not only revictualled and repaired whatever fortresses of his own had suffered damage, and destroyed whatever new fortifications had been added to the castles whose owners had defied or resisted him, but also ordered that some of these latter should be razed. Geoffrey was sent to carry out this process in Britanny, and Richard in Aquitaine, while the two Henrys returned to England together on May 9.[70]\n\nBesides the avowed partizans of young Henry in Aquitaine, there were others who had seized the opportunity afforded them by the war to fortify their castles and set the ducal authority at defiance. The men of the South for the most part would at any moment gladly have flung off that authority altogether, no matter whether it was wielded by the heiress of the old ducal house, her husband, or her son. The Aquitanian barons whose castles had in the time of the war been fortified or held against Henry II made it clear that they were not disposed to give them up to Richard. He therefore, in pursuance of his fatherâs orders, set out [19] 1775 âto reduce the said castles to nothing.â He began after midsummer by marching into the county of Agen, where Arnald of Bonville had fortified Castillon against him, âand would not give it up.â This place, âfortified by both nature and art,â held out against the duke and his engines of war for nearly two months; âat last he took it, and in it thirty knights whom he kept in his own hands.â[71] We have no certain knowledge of his further movements 1176 till the following spring, when he and Geoffrey of Britanny went to England together. They landed on Good Friday, April 7.[72] Richardâs purpose seems to have been to seek counsel and help in the difficult task which his father had assigned to him, for when the Easter festivities were over it was arranged by the elder Henry that the younger one should go with Richard into Poitou âto subdue his enemies.â Young Henry went to Normandy on April 20;[73] Richard probably returned about the same time, though the brothers did not cross the Channel together.[74] During his absence Vulgrin of AngoulÃªme, a son of the reigning count William Taillefer, had âpresumedâ to march into Poitou at the head of a troop of Brabantines. The bishop of Poitiers had at once resolved, with Theobald Chabot, who was âthe leader of Duke Richardâs soldiery,â to âdeliver the people committed to him out of the hand of their enemies,â and the invaders, although they far outnumbered the forces of the bishop and the constable, had been completely routed near Barbezieux.[75] Richard made straight for Poitou and [20] 1176 called out its feudal levies, âand a great multitude of knights from the regions round about flocked to him, for the wages that he gave them.â He began by punishing some of the rebels in Poitou; next, after Whitsuntide (May 23), he marched against Vulgrinâs Brabantines and defeated them in a pitched battle between St. Maigrin and Bouteville, near the western border of the Angoumois. Thence he led his host into the Limousin, to punish Count Aimar of Limoges, who also had taken advantage of the dukeâs absence to commit some breaches of the peace. First, Richard besieged and took Aimarâs castle of Aixe with its garrison of forty knights. Then he attacked Limoges, and in a few days was master of the city and all its fortifications. All this was the work of a month. Shortly after midsummer he returned to Poitiers; there he was at last joined by the young king. After taking counsel with the Poitevin barons it was decided that the next step should be the punishment of Vulgrin of AngoulÃªme. The brothers led their united forces to ChÃ¢teauneuf on the Charente, south-west of AngoulÃªme, and won the place after a fortnightâs siege. Thereupon young Henry âwould stay with his brother no longer, but following evil counsel departed from him.â Richard, thus suddenly deserted, moved cautiously further away from AngoulÃªme to Moulineuf, another castle belonging to Vulgrin; this he captured in ten days. Then he turned back again and laid siege to AngoulÃªme itself. Within its walls were not only Vulgrin and his father, Count William, but also Aimar of Limoges and two other rebel leaders, the viscounts of Ventadour and of Chabanais. In six days Count William was forced to surrender into Richardâs hands himself, his city, and all its contents, his castles of Bouteville, Archiac, Montignac, Jarnac, La Chaise, and Merpins, and to give hostages for his submission to the mercy of Richard and of King Henry, to whom Richard immediately sent him and the other nobles who had surrendered with him.[76] They presented themselves [21] 1176 before Henry at Winchester on September 21, fell at his feet, and âobtained mercy from himâ; that is to say, he, it seems, sent them back again with instructions that they should be temporarily reinstated in their possessions, pending a fuller consideration which he purposed to give to their case when he should return to Normandy.[77]\n\nHaving for the moment reduced northern Aquitaine to subjection, Richard set himself to a like task in Gascony. After keeping Christmas at Bordeaux he marched upon Dax, which had been fortified against him by its viscount Jan. 1177 with the help of the count of Bigorre. Its recovery by Richard was quickly followed by that of Bayonne, held against him by its viscount Ernald Bertram. Thence he marched up to the very âGate of SpainââSt. Pierre de Cize, on the Navarrese border at the foot of the Pyreneesâtook the castle of St. Pierre in one day, razed it, compelled the Basques and Navarrese to swear that they would keep the peace, âdestroyed the evil customs which had been introduced at Sorde and LespÃ©ronâ (two towns in the Landes) âwhere it was customary to rob pilgrims on their way to or from S. James,â and by Candlemas was back at Poitiers, havingâfor the momentâârestored all the provinces to peace.â[78] The count of Bigorre in the south and a few barons of Saintonge and of the Limousin had not yet submitted; Richard, however, made no further movement against any of them for many months. His inaction may have been due to instructions from his father, who was probably unwilling to let him engage in another campaign against these rebels at a moment when all the available forces of the Angevin house and the presence of Richard himself seemed likely to be needed in another quarter.\n\nThe richest baron of Aquitanian Berry, Ralf of DÃ©ols, the lord of ChÃ¢teauroux, whose lands were said to be worth as much as the whole ducal domains of Normandy,[79] had died at the close of 1176 leaving as his sole heir a daughter three [22] 1176 years old. The wardship of this child and of her heritage belonged of right to her suzerain, the Duke of Aquitaine; but her relations were resolved to keep, if possible, both herself and her lands in their own power,[80] so they carried her off to La ChÃ¢tre,[81] and prepared her castles and their 1176 own for defence and defiance. When these tidings reached King Henry in England, he sent urgent orders to his eldest son to assemble the Norman host without delay and take forcible possession of the lands of DÃ©ols.[82] Henryâs action in this matter is noticeable as showing that he regarded Richardâs tenure of the dukedom of Aquitaine at this period as merely nominal or delegated; he claimed Denise of DÃ©ols as his own vassal, not as Richardâs. It is, however, not at once apparent why, since he had intrusted to Richard the task of subduing the other Aquitanian rebels, he did not leave the affair of DÃ©ols to the same hands. The reason may have been mainly a geographical one. These things 1176-7 may have taken place at a moment when Henry knew Richard to be busily engaged at the very opposite end of the duchy, at any rate somewhere in Gascony, perhaps at its extreme southern border. The young king, on the other hand, was in Normandy, whence it would be easy for him to lead a force through Maine and Touraine into Berry. On receiving his fatherâs instructions he did so, and laid siege to ChÃ¢teauroux, which surrendered to him at once.[83] He did not, however, gain possession of the little heiress or of the rest of her lands; for the matter now became complicated by the intervention of the supreme lord of Berry and of Aquitaine, King Louis.\n\nFor more than eight years, ever since January 1169, Aloysia of France had been in Henryâs guardianship as the destined bride of Richard. According to one of the best informed English writers of the time, Louis, when this engagement was made, had promised that on the marriage of the young couple he would make over to Richard, as Aloysiaâs dowry, the city of Bourges with all its appurtenances;[84] that is, the portion of Berry the ownership of [23] 1176-7 which was in dispute between France and Aquitaine. Ten years beforeâin the year of Aloysiaâs birthâhe had promised to King Henry a like cession of the Vexin, the disputed border-land of France and Normandy, as the dowry of Aloysiaâs sister Margaret on her intended marriage with Henryâs eldest son, and Henry had taken advantage of the ambiguous wording of a clause in the treaty to have the two childrenâcontrary to Louisâs intentionâat once formally married in church; whereby he gained immediate possession, not indeed of the whole Vexin, but of that portion of it which had once been Norman and which contained its most valuable fortresses, these being surrendered to him by the Templars, who were by the treaty to have them in custody till the marriage should take place. That marriage, nevertheless, had brought more advantage to Louis than to Henry, by bringing Margaretâs husband, as soon as he reached manhood, under the influence of his father-in-law in opposition to his own father. There was but too much reason to fear a like result in the case of Richard; and the dangers of such a result were even greater in this case than in the former one, owing to special circumstances connected with the betrothal of Richard and Aloysia. That betrothal was the price, or part of the price, paid by Henry at Montmirail in 1169 for Louisâs sanction, as overlord, to the scheme devised by Henry for securing a certain distribution of his dominions among his sons. Henryâs own renewal of homage to Louis on that occasion for all his continental territories was a token that he did not intend to renounce his personal rights over any of his lands, but merely to secure for himself the power of sharing those rights with his sons whenever he might choose to do so, and for the boys an unquestionable right of succession at his death to their respective shares of the Angevin heritage. But, somewhat like Louis nine years before, Henry made a mistake which rendered it possible for his adversary to put another construction upon the matter. He secured young Henryâs claims to the future possession of the heritage of Geoffrey of Anjou and Maud of Normandy, and Richardâs claim to the heritage of Eleanor, by making them do homage to Louis for Anjou and Aquitaine [24] 1176-7 respectively; but he omitted to secure the subordination of their claims to his own during his lifetime by making them do homage to himself. Owing to this omission, it was open to Louis to assert, if he chose, that the Angevin counties and the Norman duchy legally belonged to young Henry and the duchy of Aquitaine to Richard, in virtue of the homage rendered by them for those lands direct to himself as overlord; Henry IIâso he might argueâhaving by his consent to that homage tacitly renounced all claim to the lands for which it was rendered, and being thenceforth merely in temporary charge of them as guardian of the boys. The promise of the cession of Bourges was a very small price to pay for a weapon so tremendous as that which Henry had thus, it seems, unconsciously placed in the hands of an enemy whose mean jealousy and unscrupulous astuteness he appears never to have fully realized. He unintentionally made this possible construction of the treaty of Montmirail still more plausible through the crowning of his eldest son in 1170 and the solemn installation of the second as duke of Aquitaine in 1172. Louis acted upon it in 1173, although he does not seem ever to have put it into formal words; and his action, coupled with that of the ungrateful sons urged on by their mother, must have opened Henryâs eyes to the peril in which he had involved himself through his misplaced confidence in the loyalty both of his overlord and of his own family. It showed that as soon as Richard and Aloysia were married, Louis might and in all probability would demand the recognition of his new son-in-law as sole ruler of Aquitaine, independent of any superior save Louis himself.\n\nAt the close of 1175 or early in 1176 Louis, it seems, reminded Henry that, Richard being now in his nineteenth 1175-6 year and Aloysia in her sixteenth, it was full time for the contract of marriage between them to be carried into effect; but the answer which he received was so unsatisfactory that he referred the matter to the Pope. We have no actual record of any communication between the kings on the subject at this time, but something of the kind must have 1176 taken place to cause the Popeâs action. In May 1176 [25] 1176 Alexander bade Cardinal Peter, then legate in France, lay the whole of Henryâs lands on both sides of the sea under Interdict âunless he (Henry) would permit Richard and Aloysia to be married without delay.â[85] The legate, however, seems to have done nothing in the matter for more than a year. Probably the two kings were negotiating; 1177 but we hear nothing of their negotiations till June 1177, when Henry sent an embassy to France to âconveneâ Louis about the dowries which he had promised to give with his two daughters to the young king and to Richardâto wit, the Vexin (that is, its eastern or âFrenchâ part, which was still in Louisâs hands) and the viscounty of Bourges.[86] It seems that Henry, having found Margaretâs marriage fail to give him the control over her promised lands, demanded to be put in possession of those of Aloysia before he would allow her to marry Richard. But meanwhile the Pope had in May renewed the injunctions which he had issued to Cardinal Peter eleven months before; and on July 12 the English envoys returned with the news that Peter was instructed to lay the whole of their sovereignâs dominions, insular and continental, under Interdict, unless Richard were at once permitted to take for his wife the maiden whom Henry âhad so long already, and longer than had been agreed, had in his custody for the said Richard.â[87] Henry at once made the English bishops appeal to the Pope. Illness detained him in England for nearly five weeks;[88] then he went to Normandy (August 18), and on September 21 met Louis and the legate at Nonancourt.[89] In the legateâs presence he promised that Richard should wed Aloysia, if Louis gave Bourges to Richard and the Vexin to the young king as previously agreed.[90] Whether the wedding or the cession was to take place first, however, seems to have been left an open question; and four days later the whole matter was again postponed indefinitely by a treaty whereby the [26] 1177 two elder kings pledged themselves to take the Cross and go to the Holy Land together, and meanwhile, as brother Crusaders, to lay aside all mutual strife and make no claims or demands upon each otherâs possessions as they held them at that moment, except with regard to Auvergne and to any encroachments which the men of either party might have made upon those of the other in the territory of ChÃ¢teauroux or of the lesser fiefs on the border of their respective lands in Berry. If on these excepted matters they could not agree between themselves, twelve arbitrators were to decide according to the sworn evidence of the men of the lands in question.[91]\n\nAll immediate danger of interference from either Louis or the Legate being thus removed, Henry summoned the Norman host to meet at Argentan on October 9 for an expedition against the rebels in Berry.[92] Young Henry and Richard had, by his desire, joined him on his arrival in Normandy;[93] the former was now despatched in advance into Berry, and when the kingâs host reached the Norman border at AlenÃ§on Richard was detached from it and once more sent into Poitou âto subdue the enemiesâ there, while the king himself marched upon ChÃ¢teauroux. After receiving its formal surrender he proceeded to La ChÃ¢tre; this place, and the little Lady of DÃ©ols, were also given up to him at once. Thence he proceeded into the Limousin and called upon those of its nobles and knights who had taken part in the rebellion of 1173 to give an account of their conduct; one of the most important of them, the viscount of Turenne, surrendered his chief castle, âstrongly fortified by both art and natureâ; with the others Henry dealt âaccording as each of them deserved.â[94] He then hurried back to GraÃ§ay in Berry, to meet Louis and the commissioners who were to report to the two kings the result of their investigations about Auvergne. What that result was we are nowhere directly told; we only hear that both the rivals declared themselves content to abide by it.[95] The [27] 1177 next reference to the overlordship of Auvergne, however, some twelve years later, seems to indicate that the commissioners gave their award in favour of the duke of Aquitaine.\n\nAnother of Henryâs vassals in Berry, Odo of Issoudun, had lately died leaving an infant heir, and this child had been stolen by his kinsman the duke of Burgundy. The custody of his fief was offered to the king by the barons who had it in their keeping, but he refused to receive it without the child,[96] whom he made no attempt to reclaim. It was not worth while to risk an embroilment with Burgundy about a petty lordship in Berry at the moment when an opportunity was just presenting itself for annexing to the Poitevin domains a valuable fief of the duchy of Aquitaine, the county of La Marche, which lay between Berry and the Limousin. Count Adalbert V of La Marche had separated from his wife, lost his only son, and seemingly disinherited his only daughter with her own consent;[97] the kinship between him and his only other surviving relatives was so remote that he deemed himself free to dispose of his county without regard to them; and he now offered to sell it to its overlord, King Henry, for a sum of money wherewith he himself might go to end his lonely days in the Holy Land. In December Henry went to meet him at Grandmont; the bargain was quickly struck, the conveyance executed, and the purchase moneyâless than a third of what Henry is said to have estimated the county as worthâpaid down, and the barons and knights of La Marche did homage to Henry as their immediate liege lord.[98]\n\n[28] 1177\n\nIn all these proceedings of Henry in Aquitaine there is no reference to Richard. They clearly indicate that the elder holder of the ducal title still claimed the ducal power and authority as his own, not his sonâs. He seems, however, to have left to Richard the punishment of one important Limousin rebel whose case he had a year before expressly reserved for his own judgement; for it was Richard who now âtook away the castleââthat is, the fortified townââat Limoges where S. Martial rests in his minsterâ from the viscount; âand it served the viscount right,â adds a Norman chronicler, âfor helping the count of AngoulÃªme against the duke.â[99] This seems to have been about the time when Henry was in Aquitaine, and it is the only act of Richardâs mentioned by any chronicler between Henryâs arrival in Normandy in August 1177 and his return to England in July 1178.[100] We may infer, almost with certainty, that it was done by Henryâs order; and, with considerable probability, that the unusual state of quiescence in which Richard seems to have passed these eleven months was due in part at least to the restraint placed on him by Henryâs presence on the continent. So long as Richard remained in the dependent position to which he had been reduced by the agreement at Montlouis, it would be impossible for him to take any considerable military or political action, unless by his fatherâs order, while his father was within reach. 1178 But in the autumn of 1178, when Henry was once more in England, Richardâs activity re-commenced. âWith a great hostâ he again proceeded into Gascony[101] as far as Dax. There, to his delight, he found that the count of [29] 1178 Bigorre, who two winters before had helped the viscount of Dax to hold the city against the duke, had somehow incurred the displeasure of the citizens and was fast in their prison. They seem to have handed him over to Richard; âbut 1177 King Alfonso of Aragon, grieving that his friend the count of Bigorre was held in chains, came to the said duke, and entreating that his friend might be liberated, stood surety for him that he would do the will of the duke and of his father the king of England; and the count of Bigorre, that he might be set free, gave up to the duke Clermont and the castle of Montbron.â Richard then went northward again, and after keeping Christmas at Saintes gathered another âgreat hostâ for the subjugation of Saintonge and the Angoumois.[102] These two districts had been for years, and indeed for generations, a seed-plot of rebellion. Richard seems to have been bent upon reducing them to order once 1178 for all. The moving spirits of defiance there were Vulgrin of AngoulÃªme and Geoffrey of Rancogne. Count William of AngoulÃªme, after being reinstated by Henry in his capital city, seems to have made over the government of his county to his eldest son, Vulgrin, who had headed the resistance to Richard in 1176. Geoffrey of Rancogne took his name from a place in the same county, and was also owner of two lordships of far greater importance in Saintonge, one of which, Pons, lay close to the border of the Angoumois, and the other, Taillebourg, was a fortress of great strength, about half way between Saintes and St. Jean dâAngÃ©ly. It was to Pons that Richard now laid siege. After some weeks, finding that he made no progress, he left his constables 1179 there with a part of his forces, and led the rest, in Easter week (April 1-8), into the Angoumois. A three daysâ siege won the castle of Richemont; four other castlesâGenzac, Marcillac, Gourville, Auvilleâwere taken in the last fortnight of April and levelled with the ground. Then he turned westward again, re-crossed the border, and marched upon Taillebourg.[103]\n\nBy Richardâs contemporaries the siege of Taillebourg was looked upon as âa most desperate enterprize, which none of [30] 1179 his predecessors had ever ventured to attempt. Never before had a hostile force so much as looked upon the castle.â It seems indeed to have been not merely a castle but a strongly fortified, though small, town, the castle properâperched on the summit of a rock of which three sides were inaccessible by nature and the fourth was defended by artâforming the citadel. âGirt with a triple ditch; defying from behind a triple wall every external authority; amply secured with weapons, bolts, and bars; crowned with towers placed at regular intervals; furnished with a handy stone laid ready for casting from every loop-hole; well stocked with victuals; filled with a thousand men ready for fight,â this virgin fortress âwas in no wise affrightedâ at the dukeâs approach. Richard, however, had made up his mind to âsubdue the pride of Geoffrey of Rancogne once for all.â He had collected auxiliaries from every quarter; and he set them all to work as soon as the host reached Geoffreyâs border. âHe carried off the wealth of the farms; he cut down the vines; he fired the villages; whatever was left he pulled down and laid waste; and then he pitched his tents on the outskirts of the castle close to the walls, to the great alarm of the townsfolk, who had expected nothing of the kind.â At the end of a week (May 1-8), âdeeming it a disgrace that so many high-spirited and well-proved knights should tamely submit to be shut up within the walls, they agreed to sally forth and fall upon the dukeâs host at unawares. But the duke bade his men fly to arms, and forced the townsmen to retire. The mettle of horses, the worth of spears, swords, helmets, bows, arbalests, shields, mailcoats, stakes, clubs, were all put to proof in the stubborn fight that raged at the gates, till the townsmen could no longer withstand the fierce onslaught of the dukeâs van headed by the duke himself. As they retired helter-skelter within the walls, he by a sudden dash made his way with them into the town. The citadel now became their only refuge from their assailants, who rushed about the streets plundering and burning at their will.â Two days laterâon Ascension Day, May 10âthe castle was surrendered, seemingly by Geoffrey [31] 1179 in person; and in a few days more the whole of its walls were levelled with the ground.[104]\n\nThe capture of Taillebourg was Richardâs first great military exploit. It laid the foundation of his military fame, not so much by the intrinsic importance of the exploit itself as by the revelation, in the campaign of which it was at once the turning-point and the crown, of the character and capability of the young duke. Its immediate result was the complete submission of the rebels against whom that campaign was directed. Not only did Geoffrey of Rancogne surrender Pons,[105] but Vulgrin of AngoulÃªme, before the end of the month, gave up his capital city and his castle of Montignac; and when Richard, after razing the walls of all these places, sailed for England, he left in Aquitaine, for the moment at least, âall things settled according to his will.â[106] He seems to have visited the tomb of S. Thomas the Martyr at Canterbury[107] before joining his father. Henry received him âwith great honourâ[108] and gave him his reward; when the young conqueror returned to Aquitaine shortly before Michaelmas, he returned not merely as his fatherâs lieutenant, but as once again, with his fatherâs sanction, count of Poitou.[109]\n\n[32]\n\nCHAPTER II\n\nFATHER AND SONS\n\n1179-1183\n\nDomus divisa contra se.\n\n1179\n\nWe are not told on what conditions, if any, the restitution of Poitou was made to Richard by his father. The matter might become important whenever Henry should again cross the sea; but so long as the king remained in England it would have scarcely any practical effect on Richardâs position in Aquitaine. Whether he commanded the feudal host and disposed of the feudal revenues of Poitou as count or as his fatherâs delegate, he was, in his fatherâs absence, equally master of both; and in Aquitaine at large the temporary degradation inflicted on him by Henry seems never to have been recognized at all. He himself had never laid aside the style and title of duke of Aquitaine, nor the princely state belonging to that dignity, nor had he hesitated to deal with the demesne lands of Poitou as his own absolute property. In his own eyes he was count and duke by virtue not of any grant from either Henry or Louis, but of his descent from the old ducal line and of the investiture which he had received at Poitiers and at Limoges from the clergy and people of the duchy. His subjects regarded him in the same light. They fought and intrigued against him not as an intruder or a usurper, nor as the lieutenant of one whom they counted as such, but precisely because he was to them the incarnation of the ducal authority in a form which was specially obnoxious to their habits of turbulent independence and lawless self-will. For seven years they had been watching with growing uneasiness and dismay the development [33] 1179 of the ânew duke,â whom as a boy of fourteen they had acclaimed at Limoges in 1172, into a man of very different character from the dukes of the last two or three generations.\n\nNone of the pictures of Richardâs outer or inner man which have come down to us date from a time quite so early as the year 1179; but the main features of his personality, outward and inward, were already marked enough to show us in those pictures a true likeness of the young conqueror of Taillebourg. In the sculptured effigies of Richard at Fontevraud and at Rouen the outlines of the face give so little indication of age as to suggest that in the living model they may have beenâexcept for the beard and moustacheâalmost the same at forty-one as at twenty-one; the features are well proportioned and finely formed. In life they were crowned with a profusion of hair âof a colour midway between red and yellowââin other words, of the rare golden or still rarer auburn hue. The young dukeâs stature was lofty,[110] above the average height,[111] his frame shapely and well proportioned, with long, straight, flexible limbs; âno arm was better adapted than his for drawing sword, nor more powerful to strike with it.â[112] His whole person had such an aspect of dignity that two independent observers, at different times, described it in the same wordsââa form worthy to occupy a place of high commandâ;[113] and the seemliness of his appearance was enhanced by that of his manners and dress.[114] The stories of his gigantic strength all relate to the time of the Crusade, when that strength was in its maturity; but a man of whom such tales were told must have been a born athlete. On the other hand, it was certainly before his Aquitanian days were over that he contracted the quartan ague which, says Gerald of Wales, âwas given him to repress the over fierce workings of his mind, but by which he, like the lion, yea, more than lion that [34] 1179 he was,[115] seemed rather to be influenced as by a goad; for while thus almost continually trembling, he remained intrepid in his determination to make the whole world tremble and fear before him.â[116]\n\nIn this sentence of Geraldâs we have perhaps the earliest foreshadowing of the epithet which was to become attached exclusively to Richardâs name. The king of beasts has in all ages been a common simile for a king of men, whether the kingship be material or metaphorical.[117] But Geraldâs words seem, from their context, meant to carry a special significance which is more distinctly implied in the special form of Richardâs traditional surname. Richard is not the only hero whom poets and romancers, in the golden age of old French poetry and romance, credited with the possession of âa lionâs heart,â[118] but he is the only one who became known to the world for all time as pre-eminently and absolutely âThe Lion-Heart.â We cannot tell precisely when the epithet came into general use; one writer used it within eight years after Richardâs death.[119] It had evidently fixed itself in popular tradition before a less high-souled generation of romancers sought to explain a surname, whose true meaning they were too far removed from the old epic spirit to appreciate or understand, by devising an origin for it in an impossible tale of their own clumsy invention.[120] Its [35] 1179 true origin need be sought no further than the character of him who bore it.\n\nâAmong the virtues in which he excels, three especially distinguish him beyond compare: supereminent valour and daring;[121] unbounded liberality and bountifulness; stedfast constancy in holding to his purpose and to his wordââthus Gerald of Wales wrote of Richard some eight or nine years after the campaign of Taillebourg.[122] The young dukeâs energy and daring had been proved before that expedition; and his lavish readiness to reward those who served him had contributed in no small degree to his military successes, by means of the crowd of highly trained soldiers whom it attracted to his standard. What medieval writers call âconstancyâ was one of the qualities most universally admired in the medieval world. Richardâs âconstancyâ had, as yet, shown itself chiefly in a form which compelled the admiration and respect of all his Aquitanian subjects, but was not likely to win him the love of the Aquitanian baronage. From the hour when his father laid on him, a lad of scarce sixteen years and a half, the task of restoring the ducal authority in Aquitaine, his aim was to rule and govern what Gerald truly calls âthat hitherto untamed countryâ in such wise âthat not only might he establish within its borders a far more complete and unbroken peace than was wont to reign there, but also, recovering what in time past had been lopped off and separated from it, restore all things to their pristine condition.â[123] The barons of the duchy were for the most part far from regarding âpeace within its bordersâ as a thing to be desired; and [36] 1179 Richardâs ideal of a well-ordered state, while thus differing from theirs, was not made more attractive in their eyes by the methods which he employed to realize it. Unlike his elder brother, he did not court popularity; he was indeed absolutely indifferent to it, if not contemptuous of it. âStrictness and firmness, gravity and constancy,â were the characteristics in him which men contrasted with the young kingâs easy good-nature, indulgent temper, and pleasantness towards all who approached him. Richardâs generosity and graciousness were of a higher type than young Henryâs; they were displayed only where they were deserved.[124] With him everything was earnest. Even martial sports had no charm for a lad who, while other young knights of his dayâhis brothers among themâwere acquiring the use of arms in an endless round of tournaments, was serving his military apprenticeship in real warfare; a warfare which he waged with tireless persistence and relentless severity for nearly ten years, âthat he might quell the insubordination of an unruly people, and make innocence secure amid evildoers.â[125]\n\nHis zeal for public order and justice, his ruthless application of the utmost rigor of law to those who in his eyes deserved punishment, naturally provoked the hatred of his opponents, and laid him open to the charge of cruelty.[126] No instances, however, are recorded; the Aquitanian chroniclers say nothing on the subject, and there is no real ground for supposing that his sternness towards the barons who withstood his will was other than what Gerald represents it to have beenâpart of a wholesome and necessary [37] 1179 discipline.[127] In 1183 they are said to have accused him of crimes of another kind;[128] but this accusation rests only upon an English writerâs report of the pleas by which they sought to justify their own treason. That some at least of the worst details of the charge were a product of that ârecklessness of tongueâ for which the men of the south were notorious, may with much probability be inferred from the silence of the Aquitanian chroniclers on this point also. The only comment made by a contemporary local writer on Richardâs character and conduct during these early years of storm and stress is a tribute of praise even more impressive, considering the period and the circumstances in which it was written, than the panegyrics that were lavished from all quarters upon his later achievements. Geoffrey of Breuil seems to have been a member of a junior branch of the knightly family of Breuil in Poitou; his fatherâs house was at Ste. Marie de Clairmont, near Excideuil in PÃ©rigord. He made his profession as a monk at S. Martialâs abbey at Limoges in 1160, was ordained priest in 1167, and ten years later was made Prior of Vigeois in the Limousin. His sketch of Aquitanian history ends abruptly at the year 1185. In that year he, as he says, decided to insert in his work âthe names of the kings who are ruling the world in this our age.â After mentioning by name Prester John, the two Emperors, the kings of Jerusalem, France, England, Scotland, Denmark, Sicily, Morocco, Spain, and Hungary, he continues: âIn the list of the kings let there be written down the duke of Aquitaine and Gascony, Richard, who has never been slack in deeds of prowess, and whose youth is distinguished by great strenuousness of life.â[129]\n\n[38] 1179\n\nA cessation of war between duke and barons in Aquitaine was usually followed by trouble with the mercenary troops who were always employed by one party or the other, sometimes by both parties, and who when such employment was lacking fell to raiding on their own account. This occurred in the summer of 1179 during Richardâs absence in England after the fall of Taillebourg. Bordeaux was ravaged and burnt by some âBasques, Navarrese, or Brabantines,â evidently soldiers of this class.[130] With the barons Richard seems to have had no particular trouble for the next two years or more. On July 7, 1179, old Count William of AngoulÃªme and his stepson Aimar of Limoges, âwith many others,â set out on a pilgrimage to Jerusalem.[131] William died a month later at Messina; Vulgrin, who had surrendered the city to Richard, thus became head of the family, but the dignity and authority of count of AngoulÃªme seems to have been shared between him and his brothers.[132]\n\nThe recent humiliation of Vulgrin and the absence of Aimar of Limoges and his fellow pilgrims may help to account for the fact that the year 1180 is almost a blank in the chronicles of Aquitaine. King Henryâs presence in Normandy from April 1180 to July 1181 may also have had a pacific effect throughout all his continental dominions. It is, moreover, probable that some of the pilgrims had come 1180 to an agreement with Richard before they started; it seems almost certain that Aimar had done so, for when he returned, in December 1180, he was solemnly welcomed at Limoges on Christmas Day[133] in a manner which implies that he had been reinstated in his former position of authority there, [39] 1180 and we hear of no further hostilities between him and Richard for more than six months.[134] We hear indeed of no 1181 further military movements in Aquitaine till after King Henryâs return to England at the end of July 1181. Then Richard marched into Gascony and took possession of Lectoure, the chief town of the viscounty of Lomagne. He was seemingly on his way thence to Dax when VÃ©zian of Lomagne, in the middle of August, came and submitted himself to him at S. Sever. VÃ©zian was probably a very young man, for he was not yet a knight. His submission was not only accepted as frankly as it was offered, but it was rewarded by the bestowal of knighthood from Richardâs hand.[135] In November Richard joined his brothers in punishing the count of Sancerre for his rebellion against the young King Philip of France, whom Henry had charged his sons to protect and support during his own absence over-sea.[136]\n\nIt was probably in the interval between these two expeditions, to Gascony and to Sancerre, that a new strife arose in the Angoumois. Count Vulgrin Taillefer III had died on June 29[137] leaving an only child, a girl âwho,â says Geoffrey of Vigeois, âwas the cause of great calamity to her country.â Richard, as duke, took her into his wardship as heiress of AngoulÃªme and claimed also the wardship of her land;[138] but her uncles, William and Aimar, tried to [40] 1181 seize their dead brotherâs heritage. Richard drove them out of AngoulÃªme, whereupon they found a refuge at Limoges with their half-brother, viscount Aimar.[139] It was plain that Richard would soon be involved in a new war with them and with Aimar of Limoges; and meanwhile other influences were tending to develope that war into a general one. The comparative peace of the last eighteen months was almost ominous; it certainly did not imply contentment on the part of the barons of Aquitaine. They were all this while writhing under the iron rule of their young duke; many of them were plotting schemes for âdoing their utmost to drive him out of the duchy of Aquitaine and the county of Poitou altogether.â[140] Strangely enough, the impulse which at length brought their plottings to a head seems to have sprung from a private quarrel between two brothers who did not rank among the great vassals of the duchy.\n\nThe castle of Hautefort, on the border of the Limousin and PÃ©rigord, was the joint patrimony of Constantine and Bertrand de Born. They lived in it together, but in continual discord, till Constantine drove Bertrand out, seemingly in the latter part of 1181 or early in 1182. Bertrand, however, soon made his way back, and expelled Constantine in his turn. Constantine appealed for help to their immediate feudal superior, the viscount of Limoges,[141] and also, it seems, to the duke. Both took up his cause; but at the moment they were at enmity with each otherâprobably about the AngoulÃªme successionâso âRichard made war against Aimar, and Richard and Aimar made war against Bertrand and ravaged and burned his land.â Constantine was âa good knight as regards fightingâ;[142] Bertrand was something moreââa good knight, and a good fighter, [41] 1181 and a good squire of dames, and a good troubadour, and wise and well-spoken, knowing how to deal with bad and goodâand all his time he was at war with all his neighbours.â[143] The condition of things described in these last words was to Bertrand an ideal condition: âI would that the great men should be always quarrelling among themselves,â he said.[144] It was the ideal of a typical Aquitanian baron; and that ideal had become much less easy of realization now that the young duke was master of the land than it had been while the ducal interests were represented only by a woman or left in charge of mere seneschals. Bertrand seems to have conceived a project of so working on the minds of the other malcontents as to band them together with himself in a conspiracy whose primary and ostensible object was to be the overthrow of the duke, but which by uniting all its members in a sworn alliance with each other and therefore with its originator, Bertrand, should enable him to maintain his position as master of Hautefort. If Aimar of Limoges could be bound to Bertrand in a sworn league against Richard, Bertrand would be at once rid of one of his present antagonists, and another and a greater one wouldâso at least the allies might hopeâsoon have 1181-2 his hands too full of other work to trouble himself further about Hautefort.[145]\n\nAimar and his three half-brothers,[146] being already banded together against the duke for the preservation of AngoulÃªme to the male line of Taillefer, were naturally quite ready to [42] 1181-2 embrace Bertrandâs projectâif indeed the project had originated with Bertrand. It seems to have first taken shape in a meeting at Limoges: âin an ancient minster of S. Martial,â says Bertrand, âmany rich men swore to me on a missal.â[147] They seem to have sworn that no individual among them should make terms with Richard for himself independently of his allies.[148] Among the earliest members of the league thus formed were, besides the brothers of AngoulÃªme and their half-brother of Limoges, the three other viscounts of the LimousinâVentadour, Comborn, and Turenneâthe count of PÃ©rigord, and William of Gourdon in Quercy.[149] To these were soon added âother barons of PÃ©rigord and of the Limousin and Quercy whom Richard was disinheriting.â[150] In one of his most vigorous sirventes Bertrand made a stirring appeal to the great nobles of Gascony, Gaston of BÃ©arn, VÃ©zian of Lomagne, Bernard of Armagnac, Peter of Dax, Centol of Bigorre: âif they will it, the count [of Poitou] will have enough to do in those parts; and then, since he is so valiant, let him come with his great host this way and measure himself with us!â The effect of Richardâs repressive measures in Saintonge and in Poitou are indirectly acknowledged in the poetâs next words: âIf Taillebourg and Pons and Lusignan and MaulÃ©on and Tonnay were fit for action, and if there were a stirring and stalwart viscount at Sivray, I will never believe that they would not help us. He of Thouars, too, whom the count has threatened, should join us if he be not a dastard.â[151] Of Richardâs relations at this period with Aimeric of Thouars, Ralf of MaulÃ©on, and the lords of Tonnay and Sivray, we know nothing. The head of the house of Lusignan was that same Geoffrey who had been a prominent leader in the Poitevin rising of 1167, and had also [43] 1181-2 joined in the revolt of 1173. Since then a new cause of strife had arisen between him and the Angevin rulers of Aquitaine. At the time when Adalbert of La Marche sold his county, according to his own statement, there was âno one protesting and indeed no one existing who had a right to protestâ against the sale.[152] But on the actual annexation of La Marche to the ducal domain Geoffrey of Lusignan âwith his brothersââhe had fiveâdid more than protest; he âresisted, saying that La Marche belonged to him as heirâand,â adds Geoffrey of Vigeois, âhe got it.â[153] How and when he got it we do not know, but it was probably not earlier than the autumn of 1182, since Bertrand de Born shortly before that time evidently did not regard the Lusignans as being in a position to afford much practical help to the league, and in June of that year Henry was still sufficiently master of the county to make a peaceful visit to Grandmont for the third time within sixteen months.[154] Obviously, however, the league would have the sympathies of the claimant of La Marche and his brothers. It seems to have also had those of some at least of the towns; âthe burghers are shutting themselves in all roundââthat is, rebuilding or strengthening their town wallsâsaid Bertrand.[155]\n\nConcerted action was, however, so difficult to men accustomed by lifelong habit to fighting each for his own hand that before the allies were ready for a simultaneous rising their project seems to have become known to the duke. On Sunday, April 11, 1182, he âwith a few of his people manfully capturedâ the Puy-St.-Front, a stronghold which stood in much the same relation to the city of PÃ©rigueux as that of the âcastle of S. Martialâ to the city of Limoges. The capture was evidently a surprise, characteristically planned and executed by Richard on the spur of the moment 1182 when he discovered that Elias of PÃ©rigord, with whom he does not seem to have had any previous trouble, âwas favouring his enemies.â He then marched upon Excideuil [44] 1182 and ravaged the Limousin border from that fortress to Corgnac. By the middle of May the rebel leaders were apparently so disheartened that they were ready to discuss terms of peace, not indeed with Richard, but with his father. Soon after Whitsuntide (May 16) the counts of AngoulÃªme and PÃ©rigord and the viscount of Limoges met the king at Grandmont, but no agreement was reached. Henry then went to support Richard in the Limousin. Richard suddenly attacked Excideuil, and took the town, though not the castle; Henry went to St. Yrieix, placed a garrison there, and then laid siege to Pierre-BuffiÃ¨re, which surrendered after twelve days. At midsummer he was back at Grandmont. Richard meanwhile had gone from Excideuil back to PÃ©rigueux. It seems that in his absence Elias had recovered Puy-St.-Front, and this time it was well prepared for defence. Richard âgirded it all round about with a very great hostâ; in a few days he was rejoined by his father, and at the end of the month by his elder brother. The result was that in the first week of July both Elias of PÃ©rigord and Aimar of Limoges submitted. The peace was sworn in S. Augustineâs abbey at Limoges; Aimar promised that his half-brothers should have no further help from him, and placed two of his sons in Richardâs hands as hostages; Elias surrendered PÃ©rigueux to the young duke, who thereupon made peace with him, but took the precaution of destroying all the towers of the city wall.[156] 1181 Twelve months earlier, he had ordered a more complete destruction of the defences of Limoges. There, the walls of the castle of S. Martial, which Henry had ordered to be razed thirty years before, had been hurriedly rebuilt by the burghers during the war of 1174, âlest when peace was restored the duke should forbid it.â[157] The duke seems to have let them alone for seven years; it may have been 1181-2 some recent addition to the fortifications which made him issue at midsummer 1181 an order that they should again be pulled down; and the burghers dared not disobey him.[158]\n\n[45] 1181-2\n\nThe league seemed to have failed; but its ultimate failure was by no means assured yet. Two at least of its members were by this time contemplating, if indeed they had not already taken, steps to win support for it outside the duchy. Aimar Taillefer offered his homage for AngoulÃªme to the lord paramount, King Philip of France; Philip accepted the homage, and thus pledged himself to uphold Aimar in his struggle for the county against Richard, who was still determined to reclaim it for its late countâs daughter, 1182 Maud.[159] There was another young king in whom, although his kingship was merely nominal, Bertrand saw a yet more desirable tool for the purposes of the league. Before young Henry joined his father and brother at the siege of Puy-St.-Front, he had been âjoyfully receivedâ by the monks of S. Martialâs at Limoges[160]âperhaps not by the monks only. The careless, easy, shallow disposition of Eleanorâs eldest son was far more in accord than the energetic temper of Richard with the ideas of the Aquitanian nobles as to what their duke should be. The policy of setting him up as Richardâs rival was obvious; and a characteristic action on Richardâs part helped, most opportunely from Bertrandâs point of view, to stir up the elder brotherâs latent jealousy of the greater independence granted to the younger one by their father. About half way between ChÃ¢telleraut and Poitiers, on the borders of Anjou and Poitou, there rose out of the champaign land a certain hill which seems to have struck Richard as being a good site for a castle. He built a castle on it accordingly, just as the first âgreat builderâ of the Angevin family, Fulk the Black, had built so many of the fortresses in the Loire valley, and just as [46] 1182 he himself in later days built the last and greatest of all the fortresses reared by Fulkâs descendantsâwithout regard to the fact that the site did not belong to him. It really belonged to his father; but, being in Anjou, it formed part of the territory destined to fall at his fatherâs death to the share of the young king.[161] Bertrand seized his opportunity. âAt Clairvauxââsuch was the name given, somewhat inappropriately as it seems, to the new fortressââa fair castle has been, without hindrance, built and set in the midst of the fields. I would not that the young king knew of it or saw it,â ran the troubadourâs sarcastic verse, âfor he would not be pleased therewith; but I fear, so white it is, he will see it from MatefÃ©lon.â[162] The young king seems to have remonstrated with Richard,[163] but without effect. It is doubtful whether these things took place before or after his visit to Limoges; the sequence of events in Aquitaine during the years 1181-2, like that of Bertrandâs sirventes on which we are largely dependent for our knowledge of those events, is obscure; but one thing is clear: before Christmas 1182 young Henry was secretly pledged to the league against his brother.\n\nOutwardly, that league was for a time broken up by the submission of Aimar of Limoges and Elias of PÃ©rigord, and for some months the Taillefer brothers and their adherents in the Angoumois seem to have been the only enemies whom Richard had to fight. At the beginning of November he took from them the castle of Blanzac;[164] and about the same time Chalais was fortified against him [47] 1182 by its lord, Oliver of Castillon.[165] Before Christmas Richard rejoined his father and brothers in Normandy. He seems to have taken Bertrand de Born with him; at any rate he and Bertrand were for a while both at once with the court at Argenton, and to all appearance on very friendly terms.[166] Most likely, however, their friendliness was on both sides only external. Bertrand soon afterwards unceremoniously expressed his opinion that the Norman court, âwhere there was no gab and laughter and no giving of presents,â was not worthy to be called a court, and declared that the dulness and rusticity (âlâenois e la vilaniaâ) of Argenton would have been the death of him, but for the âgood companyâ of the duchess of Saxony,[167] Richardâs sister, to whom the troubadour had (according to his own account) been introduced in a highly complimentary manner by Richard himself.[168] Bertrandâs own military resources were small,[169] and he is not likely to have taken any active part in the recent war; but the earlier sirventes by which he had striven to foment it seem to have already brought upon him a warning from the duke,[170] and it may have been a measure of policy on Richardâs part, when he quitted his duchy, to command or invite the poet to accompany him, and even to be at some pains to furnish him with a new subject for his verse.\n\nThe darkest secrets connected with the league did not come out till after Christmas. The festival week was spent [48] 1182 by the two Henrys, Richard, and Geoffrey, at Caen.[171] On 1183 January 1, 1183, the young king, âof his own accord, no one compelling him,â publicly took an oath on the Gospels that he would serve his father loyally and faithfully from that time forth; âand becauseâas he assertedâhe desired to retain in his mind no malice or rancour whereby his father might afterwards be offended, he made known to him that he (young Henry) was bound by an agreement with the barons of Aquitaine against his brother Richard; having been moved thereto because the castle of Clairvaux had been built against his will, in the patrimony which was his rightful inheritance, by his said brother; wherefore he besought his father to take that castle from Richard and retain it in his own keeping.â Richard, when admonished by his father on the subject, at first refused to give up the castle, but afterwards at his fatherâs desire âfreely made it over to him to dispose of it according to his good pleasure.â[172]\n\nThe question of Clairvaux was thus settled for the lifetime of the elder king; the settlement was that which the younger one had himself proposed, and it ought to have led to his immediate withdrawal from his engagements with Richardâs enemies. But the incident had a further significance which filled Henry II with dismay. It showed him that on his death not only might this particular dispute between young Henry and Richard be reopened, but a crowd of other disputes might arise among all his sons about their feudal relations with each other, and that unless these relations were fixed beforehand, all his schemes for preserving the integrity of the Angevin dominions would probably come to nought. As soon as the festival season was over he set out with his sons for Anjou. When they reached Le Mans, he expressed his desire that young Henry, as the future head of the family, should receive the homage of Richard and Geoffrey for their respective duchies.[173] It seems that the proposition was made privately to the young king, and was at least tacitly accepted by him. Accordingly, on arriving at Angers, Henry II took measures for confirming once for all âa bond of perpetual peaceâ between the three [49] 1183 brothers. First, each of them swore to keep his fealty to his father always and against all men, and always to render to him due honour and service. Next, they all swore that they would âalways keep peace among themselves according to the disposition made by their father.â[174] Whatever may have been the case with regard to Geoffrey and Britanny, it appears that Richard, at least, was thus far wholly unaware that the âdispositionâ which he was thus pledged to respect implied any arrangements beyond those which already existed concerning his tenure of Poitou or of Aquitaine. The elder king now publicly called upon the younger one to receive Geoffreyâs liege homage for Britanny. To this neither of the brothers objected, and the homage was duly rendered and received.[175] Next, the father âused his utmost endeavours that the young king should grant the duchy of Aquitaine to his brother Richard, to be held by Richard and his heirs by an undisputable right.â[176] Richard at first declared he would do no homage to his brother, who was no more than his equal either in personal distinction or in nobility of birth; but afterwards, yielding to his fatherâs counsel,[177] he consented. Thereupon, however, the young king drew back.[178] He seems to have explained more fully the nature and extent of his entanglement with the malcontent barons of Aquitaine, and to have urged that he could not thus desert their cause without a guarantee that his father would make a settled peace between them and Richard. The final settlement between the brothers was therefore postponed till the Aquitanian barons could meet the king and his sons at Mirebeau. Henry promised that he would then confirm peace on the terms settled in the preceding summer, or, if this did not satisfy the barons, he would judge their cause in his own court. Geoffrey of Britanny was sent to invite or summon the barons to the meeting.[179] With these arrangements [50] 1183 young Henry professed himself content, and he promised that he would, at Mirebeau, accept Richardâs homage, but on one further condition: that Richard should, after performing the homage, swear fealty to him on some holy relics. This last requirement, being a plain insinuation of lack of confidence in Richardâs honour, was an insult to which Richard could not submit. He âbroke out in a white heat of passion,â and not only again refused to perform the homage at all, butâso it was saidâdeclared that it was unmeet for him to acknowledge, by any kind of subjection, a superior in a brother born of the same parents, and that as their fatherâs property was the due heritage of the first-born, so he himself claimed to be, with equal justice, the lawful successor of their mother.[180] âLeaving nought but insults and threats behind himâ he quitted the court, hurried into his own duchy, and prepared for defence.[181] His vehemence kindled the wrath of his father, who hastily bade the young king ârise up and subdue Richardâs pride,â and sent orders to Geoffrey to âstand faithfully by his eldest brother and liege lord.â[182]\n\nNeither young Henry nor Geoffrey needed a second bidding. Geoffrey, sent into Aquitaine as a messenger of peace, had carried thither, as a contemporary writer says, not peace but a sword. He and his eldest brother were already in collusion, and instead of executing his fatherâs commission to the malcontent barons, he had secretly used the opportunity which that commission gave him to renew the alliance between them and the young king, whom they were now eager to set up as duke in Richardâs [51] 1183 stead.[183] At the beginning of February[184] the young king set out for Limoges; it seems to have been arranged that his father, with a small force, should travel by another route and join him there later.[185] Geoffrey was there already; the viscount, Aimar, at once joined them, and endeavoured to terrify the burghers of the castle into doing likewise. His threats were emphasized by the neighbourhood of a host of Routiers who seem to have been secretly engaged to be in readiness for a call from Geoffrey.[186] That call Geoffrey now gave, and one body of these ruffians, with some of his own vassals, swooped down from Britanny upon Poitou and began plundering and burning the demesnes of the count, who retaliated by making similar raids into Britanny, âand if any man of that troop fell into his clutches, that manâs head was cut off without respect of persons.â[187] Another body of Routiers had come up from Gascony under a certain Raymond âBrunus, or Brenuusâ at the call of Aimar, and were with him engaged on February 12 at Gorre, some few miles south of Limoges, in besieging a churchâprobably fortified by the villagers for use as a place of refugeâwhen the duke fell suddenly upon them. From a castle somewhere beyond Poitiers he had ridden for two days almost without stopping; his force was small, but the enemies were caught at unawares; many of them were made prisoners; a nephew of their commander, Raymond, was laid low by Richardâs own hand; Aimar and the rest of the band escaped only because the horses of the Poitevins were too exhausted for pursuit.[188]\n\n[52] 1183\n\nThe English chronicler who records Richardâs treatment of the captured invaders may have been shocked at the indiscriminate ruthlessness which slew mercenaries and knights all alike; but the Prior of Vigeois evidently saw nothing more than just retribution in the fate of the sacrilegious âchildren of darknessâ who were made prisoners at Gorre. Richard dragged them to Aixe and there âcaused some of them to be drowned in the Vienne, some to be slain with the sword, and the rest to be blinded.â[189] It was almost a necessity to get rid of these men. The league was no longer secret; many of the conspirators were delivering up their castles to the young king.[190] The danger was evident enough to make Richard send an urgent message to his father asking him to come to the rescue at once.[191] Henry accordingly advanced towards Limoges. A watchman on the castle wall cried out that the city folk were bringing up troops to destroy their rivals of the castle; someone else spread a report that Geoffrey of Britanny was in great danger outside the walls; the townsfolk rushed out and began a fierce fight which was with difficulty stopped when the royal banners were re"
