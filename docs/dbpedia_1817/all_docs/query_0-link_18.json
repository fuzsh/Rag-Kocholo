        "text": "William, having repeatedly but vainly solicited the restitution of Northumberland from Henry II., at length joined in a confederacy with his son, the celebrated Coeur de Lion, for the purpose of dethroning that monarch; Richard not only assuring him of the territory he desired, but also granting the earldom of Cambridge to his younger brother David. In 1174, William served the purposes of this confederacy by an invasion of Northumberland, which he spoiled without mercy. He was prosecuting the siege of Alnwick with a small party, when a large body of Yorkshire horsemen came upon him unexpectedly. Though he had only sixty horse to present against four hundred, he gallantly charged the enemy, crying out, \"Now we shall see who are true knights.\" He was unhorsed, disarmed, and made prisoner, while his companions, and some others who were not then present, submitted to the same fate, from a sentiment of duty. Henry did not make a generous use of this triumph. He caused the captive monarch to be brought into the presence of his court at Northampton, with his feet tied together under the belly of a horse, as if he had been a felon; and afterwards placed him in strict confinement in the castle of Falaise in Normandy. The Scots, towards the close of the year, recovered their monarch from captivity, but at the expense of a temporary surrender of their national independence. In terms of the treaty formed on this occasion, William was to do homage to the English king for the whole of his dominions; an object at which the latter had long unjustly aimed: and the castles of Roxburgh, Berwick, Jedburgh, Edinburgh, and Stirling, were surrendered as pledges on the part of the king of Scots, for the performance of his promise. The independence of the Scottish church was at the same time impignorated, but with certain cautious ambiguities of phrase that reflect great credit on the ingenuity of its dignitaries, who managed this part of the treaty. The claims of the English church over Scotland, however, disturbed several of the ensuing years of the reign of William, who, in resisting them, backed as they were by the pope and all his terrors, showed surprising fortitude and perseverance.\n\nIn 1189, Richard Coeur de Lion, having acceded to the throne, and considering that William of Scotland had forfeited his independence in consequence of an attachment to his own interest, restored it to him, along with the castles of Berwick and Roxburgh. Perhaps it was not altogether from a generous or conscientious motive that the king performed this act of justice. He was about to commence his celebrated crusade, and it might be apparent to him that the king of Scots was not a neighbour to be left dissatisfied: he also stipulated for ten thousand merks as the price of the favour he was granting to his brother monarch. The treaty, however, which these mingled notions had dictated, was the blessed means of preserving peace between the two countries for upwards of a century. When Richard was afterwards so unfortunate as to become a captive in a foreign land, William contributed two thousand merks towards his ransom. Such transactions afford a pleasing relief to the general strain of our early history."
