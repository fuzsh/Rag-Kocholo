        "text": "Born in Nashville, William Edmondson was a self-taught artist who started carving stone sculptures in 1931, after believing he received a divine message from God. He often used limestone and stones from demolished buildings to create his works. Edmondson began by carving tombstones for the local African American community, and later expanded his work to include animals, birdbaths, and figures such as preachers, schoolteachers, and Eleanor Roosevelt. In 1937, Edmondson gained national attention when he became the first African American and self-taught artist to have his work exhibited at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.\n\nDate: ca. 1940\n\nLocation: Davidson County\n\nTheme: Art\n\nGallery: Change and Challenge\n\nAccession Number: 81.256"
