        "text": "Senator Olympia Snowe, a Maine Republican, says that she isn’t running for reëlection in November. Basically, she’s had it with Washington, and with fighting that leads nowhere. In a statement Tuesday she said:\n\nWhat motivates me is producing results for those who have entrusted me to be their voice and their champion…. I do find it frustrating, however, that an atmosphere of polarization and ‘my way or the highway’ ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions.\n\nWith my Spartan ancestry I am a fighter at heart; and I am well prepared for the electoral battle, so that is not the issue. However, what I have had to consider is how productive an additional term would be. Unfortunately, I do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the Senate to change over the short term.\n\nIt’s her life, of course, but her departure is a mark of many losses. Much of the focus will be on the disappearance of the moderate Republican, and of the New England Republican, and of really anyone whose name a nineteen-fifties computer given some stereotypes on punch cards wouldn’t have been able to churn out (for either side).\n\nBut while it’s easy to join in a chorus about the awful partisanship, one also has to ask: Is it really true that there is nothing to fight for in Washington anymore? Judging from the past few months, the more a common consensus breaks down, the more even basic principles seem to be at risk. And there are moments—wars, health policies, collapsing debt ceilings—when a voice, even one that loses the argument, could make a difference. No doubt politics is enervating and awful. It’s still vital.\n\nIt also matters that Snowe is a woman. Out of a hundred senators, seventeen are women now. That’s not good, no matter that it’s a lot better than it was twenty years ago. The last couple of elections haven’t provided much of a lift; a sixth of the way up is not a proper place for a plateau. And, once Snowe leaves, there will only be four Republican women senators; one of them, Susan Collins of Maine, said that she was “absolutely devastated” to be losing her. (Far more conservative Republicans sounded less than thrilled, too; Snowe is unlikely to be replaced by a G.O.P. candidate, and that could decide who gets the majority.) That shortage of women may explain nothing, or, when it comes to issues like access to birth control, quite a lot.\n\nIt does seem, at least, that there are more routes into politics for women than when Snowe first ran, in 1973, as the widow of a state representative, to fill her husband’s seat. But where are all the women senators around her, or waiting to be her next? One hopes that they’re not all on a single side of the aisle.\n\nPhotograph by Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call/Getty Images."
