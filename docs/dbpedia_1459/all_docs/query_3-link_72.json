        "text": "You won't be surprised to hear that at the Women's Campaign Fund's 32nd Annual Parties of Your Choice Gala last night, some powerful words were shared about the recent reproductive rights debates happening in congress. But this quote from Maine Senator Olympia Snowe is one for the books!\n\nThe Women's Campaign Fund, a fantastic non-partisan organization focused on getting female pro-reproductive health candidates in office, presented Senator Snowe with a Lifetime Achievement Award for her pro-woman work (fun fact: New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, who presented Senator Snowe the award, also intro'd the 2011 Women of the Year Awards, too!). In her acceptance speech, Senator Snowe sniped the recent contraceptives debate in Congress, saying:\n\n\"You know, it really is surprising, because I feel like it's a retro debate. It took place in the 1950s. It's sort of back to the future, isn't it? And it is surprising in the 21st century that we would be revisiting this issue.\"\n\nYES. YES, YES, YES. I'm obsessed. One more reason to love the women in office, and also those helping further the fight for reproductive rights, like last night's other guests--they included Sandra Fluke (who won the first annual Name It. Change It. award), Martha Stewart, Siobhan Bennett, Lilly Ledbetter and tons more, even including the Congresswoman from my childhood district in New York, Nita Lowey. Cool!\n\nOh, and one more thing: If you have the reproductive rights debate on your mind again--as you should!--consider this your required reading for the evening: Oklahoma City-based reporter Esmé E. Depre's \"Curbing Female Reproductive Rights Raises Taxpayer Costs\" on Bloomberg.com. Yes, it's as epic as it sounds.\n\nWhich women leading the fight for reproductive rights inspires you right now?\n\nP.S. Speaking of inspiring Congresswomen, this one just a set record for her days of service--that's 12,858 of 'em and counting.\n\nPhoto: Andrew H. Walker/Getty Images, Courtesy of WCF"
