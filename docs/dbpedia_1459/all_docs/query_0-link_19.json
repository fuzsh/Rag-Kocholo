        "text": "Sharon H. Abrams is the Executive Director of the Maine Children’s Home for Little Wanderers in Waterville, Maine, a statewide nonprofit organization whose mission is “to build and strengthen families and their children, instilling hope for the future and a better quality of life.” The agency celebrated its 100th anniversary in 1999.\n\nSharon has been a tireless advocate for teen parents and their needs, having taught and directed the teen parent school program of the Home from 1974 to 1990, when she became assistant director and then executive director of the organization in 1992.\n\nWhat makes Sharon special is not necessarily the number of teen mothers that she has affected over her 30-year tenure, but the quality of the effect. Hundreds of pregnant and parenting girls grew into women under Sharon’s careful guidance, and many of them attribute their success as mothers, partners, and citizens not to the Maine Children’s Home alone, but to the individual who taught them about life, about living and about being a good mother.\n\nSharon created a Teen Parenting Conference in Maine five years ago, an event that continues to grow and provide important tools to those who offer services to this vulnerable and important group of young women. Her passion and high ideals for families and children are visible in her own “blended” family. She leads by example, imparting a strong belief that each person can achieve goals with proper guidance. In 1978, Sharon was selected to attend a study of the new curriculum of caring by the Kennedy Foundation in Washington, D.C., and was chosen in 1979 as one of America’s Outstanding Young Women.\n\nSharon has brought the Maine Children’s Home through its most difficult and rewarding times. In 2001, she launched a successful capital campaign to ensure the agency’s longevity; a process that led to the Dorothy “Bibby” Alfond Campus of the Home that offers new and enhanced programming, employment opportunities, an astute Board of Directors, and a growing donor base.\n\nTwo gubernatorial appointments to a board and commission are testament to the important role Sharon has played in Maine’s social service arena. Her past involvement on the Commission to Study Poverty Among Working Parents, as well as her current role on the Maine Board of Social Worker licensure, have afforded Sharon the ability to positively affect change on a statewide level.\n\nSharon has brought many honors to the Maine Children’s Home, including the Maine Children’s Alliance 1999 Giraffe Award, the Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce 2000 Community Service Award, and the Waterville Business and Professional Women’s Business of the Year Award. In 2003, the Mid-Maine Chamber of Commerce awarded the Home a Certificate of Achievement Award, due in large part to Sharon’s outstanding leadership.\n\nIt is not only timely but fitting that such a modest, hard-working woman receive this esteemed recognition for all she has done for the children and families in Maine.\n\n2004 Photograph\n\nInducted March, 2004\n\nChesterville, Maine\n\nHealthcare for women involves much more than just blood pressures and pelvic exams. It has been Connie Adler’s mission to promote recognition that the care of women must include the pursuit of reproductive rights, contraceptive choice, and prevention of domestic violence and sexual assault, all embedded within a system that provides access to healthcare for all of Maine’s citizens. Connie Adler, MD has been a Family Medicine physician at Franklin Health Women’s Care in Farmington, where she has provided obstetrical, gynecologic, and primary care to women and families for 23 years.\n\nDr. Adler currently serves as Secretary of the Board of Directors of Franklin Memorial Hospital in Farmington, as well as on the Boards of the Maine Health Access Foundation (MeHAF) and Maine Family Planning. She has served on the Boards of the Maine Women’s Fund, Sexual Assault Victims Emergency Services, and Peace in Our Families. She has been involved with Family Planning programs since 1989 and has been on the Maine Family Planning Board of Directors for 10 years, serving as board president from 2010 to 2014.\n\nConnie was the Medical Director for the Maine Breast and Cervical Health Program from 1996 – 2001; during that time, she and her colleagues established a statewide program that allowed Maine women to access essential, life-saving healthcare services that in many cases would have been inaccessible or unaffordable for them.\n\nDr. Adler’s tenure as Maine Family Planning’s Board President combined compassion, competence and courage. Overseeing a statewide network of 40+ family planning sites serving an average of 25,000 Maine women and teens, she helped MFP transform its system to respond to the Affordable Care Act and to the realities of our rural state. To increase access in the most rural sections of Maine, she oversaw the implementation of telehealth systems, allowing women in even the most remote parts of the state to access confidential, compassionate reproductive health care. During Dr. Adler’s presidency, Maine Family Planning became the only Title X grantee in the US to initiate a Women’s Centered Medical Home by co-locating primary care services in an established family planning clinic in Belfast, Maine.\n\nConnie has been a leader in preventing and addressing domestic violence and sexual assault in Maine. The success of policies and protocols implemented in Western Maine resulted in cultural changes and improvements in health and safety that have rippled throughout the state. Dr. Adler was instrumental in efforts to include universal screening for DV in emergency department and obstetrical visits, as well as screening for DV at primary care offices. Her influence extends beyond healthcare spaces, as well. Farmington has posted signage about domestic violence along major roadways, and the DV trainings she helped develop are currently administered to law enforcement statewide.\n\nRecently Dr. Adler won the Maine Women’s Fund leadership award for service to women, the Franklin Community Health Leadership Award, the Maine Medical Association award for humanitarian service promoting safe obstetric care for women in Nicaragua, the Hanley Center award for physician leadership, and the Peace in Our Families award.\n\nHer life has been immeasurably enriched by her two daughters, Naiche and Shifra, and her nephew, Joel, and by the humor and ingenuity of her husband, Mike Rowland, MD. Connie is deeply appreciative of the thousands of women who have shared their stories with her over the years.\n\nDr. Adler has a BA from Cornell University and an MD from Tufts University School of Medicine; she completed her residency at Maine-Dartmouth Family Medicine in Augusta. Except for 5 years working in a Migrant and Community Health clinic in Washington, Connie has practiced in Maine since 1983.\n\nInducted March 2016\n\nSharon Barker’s contributions to the advancement of women and girls in Maine are extensive and long-lasting. In her leadership and advocacy roles throughout her career, Sharon has demonstrated a deep commitment to public service. Her personal power, keen intellect and exemplary networking skills have brought disparate people and causes together to create a better place for Maine people to live, work, grow and succeed.\n\nSharon has worked tirelessly to challenge and change the status quo for women, including improving educational access and creating economic opportunities as well as providing for their health care, safety, and reproductive freedom. Her focus is always on gender dynamics, and her approach is to act as a bridge and a catalyst, leveraging others’ work and communicating across generations and between sectors.\n\nThrough her position as Director of the University of Maine Women’s Resource Center, Sharon has made significant contributions in the development of all students (men and women) and the entire faculty and staff who work in so many diverse disciplines with diverse responsibilities. She has offered leadership in different ways at different times, responding to the needs and opportunities she encounters, including leadership programs for women students, networking opportunities for women in fields where they are under-represented, advocacy for support staff and socioeconomic equity, exploring power dynamics, building coalitions, and working with men and women to achieve gender equity.\n\nAs an influential and engaged citizen of Maine, Sharon’s reach extends far beyond the University of Maine campus. She provides support to the public schools and to numerous community and governmental organizations that benefit women and girls, including the nationally recognized “Expanding Your Horizons” conference for middle school girls, her leadership in founding Mabel Wadsworth Women’s Health Center and her service on numerous boards of directors and committees (e.g., Mabel Wadsworth Center, Penobscot Valley AAUW, Maine Women’s Fund, Eastern Regional Commission for Women, Good Samaritan Agency, Bangor CUReS Project, Bangor Rape Crisis Center, Women’s Business Development Corporation, and the Komen Foundation). In addition, Sharon has made significant public service contributions on state task forces, committees and special projects; for example, she served on Congressman John Baldacci’s Advisory Committee on Juvenile Crime, Domestic Violence, Drug Abuse and Hate Crimes. Most recently, Sharon served as a member of the Maine Jobs Council and chairs its Women’s Employment Issues Committee, which issues an annual report, “Working Women in Maine: Initial Indicators for Progress,” tracking Maine women’s success in the labor market.\n\nSharon’s prominence on the national level is exemplified by her receipt of two grants. A grant from AAUW Educational Foundation established a scholar-in-residence program at the University of Maine with author and researcher Lyn Mikel Brown. Brown studied the societal forces that influence girls and ultimately affect women’s friendships, and wrote the book Girl Fighting, one of many outcomes of this grant. The second grant created the Maine Girls Collaborative Project, a member of the National Girls Collaborative Project, through funding from the Puget Sound Center for Teaching, Learning and Technology and the National Science Foundation. This initiative brings girl-serving organizations together to strengthen capacity by sharing practice research and program models, outcomes and products to increase girls’ participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics fields.\n\nSharon’s work has been widely recognized through a variety of local, state, and national awards. Notable among these are the 2004 Sarah Orne Jewett Award of the Maine Women’s Fund, the 1997 National Education Association’s Mary Hatwood Futrell Award, the 1997 Mabel Sine Wadsworth Women’s Health Achievement Award, the 1999 Bangor and Maine Federation of Business and Professional Women’s Woman of the Year Awards and the 1995 Steve Gould Award at the University of Maine.\n\nSharon was born in Canada and grew up in Aroostook County. She attended the University of Maine, receiving degrees in psychology and public administration. Her family has always been a primary support in her life, along with Ruth Lockhart, her lifelong friend and professional colleague. Sharon lives in Bangor with her life partner, John Hoyt. They have two sons, Adam Barker-Hoyt and Matthew Hoyt and a granddaughter Chelsea Hoyt.\n\n2009 photo\n\nFor more than twenty-five years Lyn Mikel Brown, Ed.D. has dedicated her life to changing the cultural environment for girls and young women in Maine. As a founding member of the Harvard Project on Women’s Psychology and Girls’ Development, an AAUW Scholar in Residence, a member of the APA Presidential Task Force of Adolescent Girls, a consultant to the Ms. Foundation’s National Girls’ Initiative, her work has been instrumental to creating widespread and enduring change for Maine girls and women in the areas of programming and policy.\n\nDr. Brown’s acclaimed work on girls’ development has consistently broken new ground and challenged old perceptions. She is the author of five books, five curriculums, and numerous articles. Her books include, Meeting at the Crossroads: Women’s Psychology and Girls’ Development (with Dr. Carol Gilligan), which sparked an international debate about the lives of girls and redefined our understanding of women’s development, and Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection Among Girls, which explores the way our culture nurtures and reinforces competition and general meanness among girls. Her research focuses on the relational lives of girls, their expression of anger and resistance, and how cultural definitions of femininity and popular media impact girls’ sense of themselves, their desires, and their agency.\n\nBut what sets Dr. Brown apart is more than just research, because embedded in her approach to her work is a dedication to translating theory into practice. While she’s an academic by training, she’s an activist through and through. Much of her activism is done through the organization she co-founded more than twelve years ago, Hardy Girls Healthy Women (HGHW). HGHW is a non-profit founded on her research and dedicated to empowering girls with knowledge, critical thinking skills, and a platform to drive social change.\n\nAt Hardy Girls, Dr. Brown develops strength-based programs and materials that scaffold girls’ leadership and social change work. Working with the Girls Advisory Board at Hardy Girls and her students at Colby, for example, she founded Powered by Girl, an online media literacy and activism site dedicated to providing a space for girls and young women to make their voices heard on sexism in the media through blogging, art, and social networking.\n\nAs a professor at Colby College, Dr. Brown brings both her research and practice into the classroom and her classroom into the community. Every student she teaches works with school- or community-based youth groups and the curriculum she developed with her Colby students and with Dr. Mary Madden, From Adversaries to Allies, has been used with over 100 girls coalition groups across the state, as well as with girls groups in 41 states across the country, giving both her students and the girls they work with opportunities to develop their leadership and voice.\n\nThroughout her career, Dr. Brown has collaborated with community leaders to encourage them to include girls’ voices. She has worked with school guidance counselors to incorporate strength-based methods and her work with the State Board of Education and the Governor’s Subcommittee on Youth Safety brings a gendered lens and the voices of lesbian, bi, and transgendered girls to the tables where policies are made. She helped to revive and now co-facilitates the Waterville High School Gay, Straight, Trans Alliance, and helped to initiate and now sits on the Executive Committee of the Waterville Inclusive Community Project.\n\nBecause she believes girls have the capacity to positively impact the culture they grow up in, Dr. Brown has worked to develop a national platform for girls’ voices. In 2010, with her friend, Dr. Deborah Tolman, she co-founded SPARK Movement, a growing coalition of girls, activists, researchers, and partner organizations united in their determination to challenge the sexualization of girls and women in the media and work collectively to demand girls’ rights to embodiment and healthy sexuality.\n\nDr. Brown has had a deep and widespread impact on the lives of women and girls throughout Maine. Her research, teaching, advising, and activism have been credited with changing lives and changing the way people understand and work with girls around the country. The key to bettering women’s lives is a strong foundation of empowerment and support in girls’ lives. Dr. Brown’s lifelong work has ensured that this is the case for Maine girls, and thus for Maine women.\n\n2013 Photograph\n\nInducted 2013\n\nMary R. Cathcart of Orono is a former advocate for battered women, a Maine State Representative and State Senator, and currently a Senior Policy Associate with the University of Maine’s Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center. In 2009, she co-founded Maine NEW Leadership, a six-day, intensive, nonpartisan institute held annually at the University of Maine and designed to educate, engage, and empower the next generation of women leaders for Maine.\n\nMary has worked tirelessly in various capacities over the past thirty years to advance the cause of women in Maine, to improve their lives, and to bring enduring change. She was nominated for this honor by the Penobscot Valley Branch of AAUW, where she has been a member since the 1980’s and serves on the Leadership Team.\n\nMary Cathcart’s association with women’s concerns began shortly after she arrived in Maine as a young wife and mother of two young children in the 1970’s. She enrolled in hotline training at Spruce Run, a new organization at the time, and the third oldest domestic violence shelter in the country. Mary worked with others in the statewide domestic violence coalition to seek funding for shelters and pass legislation to protect women and their children from abuse.\n\nAfter several years as a hotline volunteer and steering committee member, Mary was hired as community education coordinator for Spruce Run; she trained volunteers for public speaking and hotline service, worked with the media to publicize the facts about violence against women, and engaged with local law enforcement and the district attorney on better training for police and placing an advocate for battered women in the DA’s office. Because of that work, Mary was appointed to the Maine Commission for Women. Believing that the Commission should reach out to women beyond Augusta, she was instrumental in founding the Eastern Regional Commission for Women, which was responsible for re-establishing a rape crisis center for the Bangor region.\n\nIn 1988, Mary was elected to the Maine House of Representatives, where she sponsored legislation to strengthen Maine’s Protection from Abuse Act. In the 1990s, she was appointed by former U.S. Senator George J. Mitchell to the United States Commission on Child and Family Welfare, and was elected by her peers to chair that body, which held public hearings around the country and made important recommendations on parental rights and responsibilities in the best interest of children.\n\nIn both the Maine House and Maine Senate, Mary continued to advocate for social justice, particularly for women and children. She sponsored legislation to require a judge to consider a history of domestic abuse between the parents when determining custody and visitation arrangements, and also brought forward legislation concerning breastfeeding.\n\nElected to the Maine Senate in 1996, Mary Cathcart quickly became known as a staunch supporter of higher education. Determined to convince the State to invest in research and development, she sponsored legislation that resulted in the creation of Maine’s first Joint Select Committee on Research and Development, which she co-chaired for 2 years. Her efforts led to a successful R&D bond and ongoing funding to support University research.\n\nThroughout her years in office, Mary not only worked with other legislators on both sides of the aisle to craft good public policy but also devoted many hours to assisting her constituents with their concerns and problems. She had a reputation for always returning constituents’ calls and listening with empathy to what they had to say.\n\nWhen Mary reached her 4-term limit in the Maine Senate, she was offered a position in the Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center at the University of Maine.\n\nShe has sought to build stronger relationships between Maine’s flagship public university and state government, initiating a program that brings 2 or 3 state leaders to campus each semester for one-day residencies to educate UMaine students and faculty on the challenges policymakers face and encourage them to engage in public service. At the MCS Center, Mary co-founded Maine NEW Leadership in 2009, to offer undergraduate women students an opportunity to receive, at no charge, hands-on leadership training to build their confidence in themselves as potential leaders and inspire them toward public service and political action. Mary continues to co-direct the program, which has prepared 106 younger women from 27 different higher education institutions to step forward as leaders. She is dedicated to sustaining the NEW Leadership institute and spends numerous hours networking, fundraising, and seeking opportunities for students to practice their leadership skills through shadowing women legislators and speaking to civic organizations.\n\nMary has found time also to volunteer as a board member at a number of organizations, including the New England Board of Higher Education, which she chaired in 2006-2008; Eastern Maine Medical Center; Maine Centers for Women, Work and Community; and Maine Center for Economic Policy.\n\nMary Cathcart envisions a future where women and children feel safe to pursue their dreams, women’s voices are heard everywhere, and women occupy at least half the seats at the tables of power.\n\nPhotograph 2013\n\nInducted 2013\n\nAs an Olympian and community activist, Julia Clukey has championed the advancement of opportunities for girls and young women in Maine.\n\nJulia Clukey graduated in 2003 from Cony High School; she went on to graduate Magnum Cum Laude from DeVry University earning her B.S in electrical engineering. From 2003-2016 she was a member of the USA Luge National team competing at the Olympic, world, and national level. She currently serves on the USA Luge Board of Directors, and the Athletes Advisory Committee focusing her energy on inclusion & safe sport initiatives.\n\nJulia has received numerous honors and awards for her service to her community, her state, and her country including being given a key to the city of Augusta in 2010, inductee to the Maine Sports Hall of Fame in 2014, the 2013 Female athlete of the year, and named by Maine Magazine as 1 of 50 Mainers “Boldly leading our state”.\n\nBeyond her professional and athletic achievements, Julia is a true role model for young girls. She founded Pathways to Potential; A Maine based non-profit with the unwavering belief that all students, regardless of income or background, deserve a quality education and career success. In 2010 Julia launched a “Julia Inspires campaign” that focuses on encouraging students to find their passion, create a plan and have the courage to go after their dreams. Since 2012, each summer Julia hosts “Julia Clukey’s Camp for Girls at Camp KV“ on Maranacook Lake in Readfield, Maine. The camp was designed for girls ages 8-11 as a place to develop self-confidence and a healthy lifestyle. In 2018 she has partnered with St. Joseph’s University to host a the Empow-HER leadership conference for High School girls focused on allowing them to leverage their distinct combination of brilliance, determination, and uniqueness to make our community a better place. To date her programs have reached more than 24,000 students.\n\n“A woman among women, a person among people. Pat Collins has made a difference in the lives of her family, her community and her state. We are pleased to recognize this person who truly is North of Ordinary.”\n\nNancy Hensel, UMPI, 2001, presenting Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters to Pat Collins.\n\nPatricia M.

Married in 1948 they settled in Caribou and raised 6 children, including United States Senator Susan Collins. Firm in her belief that education is the way to a better life, Patricia entered the work force in 1973, serving for nine years as Religious Education Coordinator at Holy Rosary Church. This positively impacted hundreds of Caribou families.\n\nAlways motivated and willing to work towards a better future for all, Patricia utilized her public speaking and organizational skills to move into city and state government. Elected Mayor of Caribou, she went on to lead the Maine Committee for Judicial Responsibility & Disability and the University of Maine System Board of Trustees for several years where she earned tremendous respect from her male peers.\n\nAs Chairman of the Board for Catholic Charities Maine, Pat is known for taking a unique and personal approach to leadership. She is fond of saying, “Don’t call it charity, call it justice,” when referring to these vital statewide programs.\n\nA graduate of the University of Maine with a BA in Mathematics and of the University of Maine at Presque Isle with a BA in Art, Pat Collins is a genuine, personable and consistent example of a committed public servant. Her actions have improved the lives of Maine women and children by her leadership in the educational, health and human service organizations essential to their needs, involvement with the Maine Women’s Forum and as a Court Appointed Special Advocate. Achieving the delicate balance offamily, community service and success in the arts, Patricia M. Collins is truly a “woman among women”.\n\n2005 Photograph\n\nInducted March 2005\n\nUnited States Senator Susan Collins has established a record of integrity, unsurpassed work ethic, and a steadfast commitment to the people of Maine. Her willingness to reach across the aisle and her centrist, moderate approach has earned her the title of “The Most Bipartisan Republican” by her Senate colleagues.\n\nSenator Collins brings these qualities to her work on her four important Senate Committees: Homeland Security, Armed Services, Appropriations, and Aging. She has authored landmark, bipartisan legislation to strengthen our nation and is an effective advocate for America’s taxpayers and most vulnerable citizens.\n\nSenator Collins has been named the “Greenest Republican” in the Senate for her record of standing for clean air, clean water, and clean energy. She is long-time supporter of measures to help small businesses to grow and create more jobs, earning a 100 percent rating from the nation’s largest small business organization year after year.\n\nSenator Collins has been a leader for education legislation, including authoring the law providing a tax deduction for teachers who spend their own money on classroom supplies. As a national leader in health care advocacy, she has worked to improve health care, particularly in rural areas, founded the Senate Diabetes Caucus, and serves as co-chair of the Task Force on Alzheimer’s Disease.\n\nSenator Collins has been a champion for women. She is a leader on issues of women’s health and domestic violence, has worked for successful equal pay legislation, and is the author of legislation to create a privately funded National Women’s History Museum in Washington, D.C.\n\nSenator Collins’ integrity, leadership, hard work, and dedication have earned honors from many professional and civic groups. In 2009, she received the University of Maine’s Stillwater Presidential Award and the Distinguished Public Service Award, the Untied States Navy’s highest civilian award. For her work on homeland security, she has also been honored by families who lost loved ones on September 11th, and by the American Association of Port Authorities. In addition, Senator Collins has been named “Guardian of Small Business” by the National Federation of Independent Businesses, “Legislator of the Year” by the American Diabetes Association, and has received honors from other groups ranging from the Veterans of Foreign Wars Association to the National School Boards Association.\n\nSusan Margaret Collins was born in Caribou on December 7, 1952. Her family runs a fifth-generation lumber business, founded by her ancestors in 1844. Each of Senator Collins’ parents has served as Mayor of Caribou, and her father served Maine as a State Senator. Her mother, Pat Collins, was inducted into the Maine Womens Hall of Fame in 2005 in recognition of her extensive public service.\n\nInducted 2011\n\nHome Economist, Feminist, Environmentalist, Citizen Activist, Liz Crandall is truly a leader in the movement to improve the physical, emotional, social, and political environment of the women of Maine. Liz earned her B.S. and M.S. degrees in family economics and resource management from Kansas State College, and her Ed.D. at Boston University, pursuing her interests in the foundations of education, human relations, and conflict resolution.\n\nUsing her background in resource management to improve her new hometown environment within weeks of moving to Brunswick, she voted for a curb-side recycling program and was appointed to the Brunswick Recycling Committee which she served as chair, helping to organize a successful model program. Liz was also involved in organizing, raising funds for, publicizing, and implementing the League of Women Voters’ Hazardous Waste Pick-up.\n\nOn a statewide level, the American Association of University Women asked Liz to serve as representative to the New England Energy Task Force, of which she was an original member. Liz’s roles in investigating alternative, safe energy sources, in improving the collection of hazardous wastes, and in establishing curb collection of recyclable wastes, are only a few examples of her commitment to improve the environment and the lives of residents of her adopted and beloved State of Maine.\n\nAs citizen activist for women, Liz advocated for services and legislation in domestic violence, equity, discrimination, reproductive freedom, and teen pregnancy. To inform and assist victims of domestic violence, Liz helped publicize state-wide the Information Guide for Abused Women in Maine. To further equity for women, Liz campaigned for the ERA; participated in the first Women’s March on Washington, and a daybreak vigil in Kennebunkport during the Bush administration; lobbied personally on both state and federal levels to protect welfare programs for women and children; and wrote a series of newspaper articles on “getting out the vote”. To combat discrimination in housing, credit, employment, and public accommodations against women, racial minorities, gays and lesbians, and people with AIDS, Liz served as legislative chair for AAUW and the Maine Home Economics Association and as a member of the Women’s Legislative Agenda Coalition. Her work was recognized in 1987 when she received the Presidential Award of the Maine Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance for Courage, Service and Integrity.\n\nFrom 1993-1995, Liz served as state liaison for AAUW’s Legal Advocacy Fund which supports women who have sued institutions of higher education for gender discrimination. To protect women’s reproductive freedom, Liz has been a representative to the Maine Choice Coalition since its inception and helped to develop its bylaws. Liz helped arrange hearings on legislation to provide courses in parenting and school-based child care for teen parents in an effort to end the cycle of uneducated and uninformed children bearing children.\n\n1996 Photograph\n\nInducted March, 1996\n\nPortland, Maine\n\nJoanne grew up in a working class, labor union family where her parents taught her to work hard to do well, and, equally important, to do good – to leave the world, or at least one’s small corer of it, better than one found it. Educated in public schools and grateful to the University of Maine for bringing her to this beautiful state, Joanne found in Maine generous mentors who supported and encouraged her passion for politics and her aspirations to work for social justice.\n\nAs a feminist activist and political strategist, policy advocate and lobbyist, State House staffer and bon-profit leader, Joanne’s guiding star has been Margaret Meade’s elegantly simple proposition that we must “Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world”. She has always believed that justice-for-all will grow in small but certain degrees by applying passion, perseverance, and the knowledge that we may never see nor benefit from the fruits of our own work…but that those who follow us, certainly will.\n\nShe has had the privilege of serving as a partner and leader in many campaigns that have made a difference for Mainers, present and future. With the Board of Directors of the Maine Women’s Lobby/Maine Women’s Policy Center, she advocated for state laws ensuring reproductive choice, privacy, and health care for Maine women; guaranteed insurance coverage for breast screening, the nation’s first law protecting all workers from sexual harassment and intimidation in the workplace; and many other policies protecting and enhancing gender equity and equality. With partners in the Maine Choice Coalition, she fought to defeat a statewide referendum denying Mainers reproductive freedom and choice; and with the leaders of the Maine Bar Foundation, helped establish Maine Equal Justice, the state’s premiere advocate for low-income families and workers. As Chief of Staff to Democratic leaders in the state legislature, she gained an enduring respect for those in public service – and the skill to recognize when and how elected officials and advocates despite their different missions and obligations, can together “do good” in the messy, hard, and hallowed work of democracy.\n\nJoanne loves the State of Maine and how its people model government and political action of, by, and for the people. To this end, she has served on the Board of Trustees of Planned Parenthood of Northern New England and Planned Parenthood/Maine Action Fund, the Board of the Maine Coalition to End Domestic Violence, the Advisory Council of the Maine Women’s Fund, the Muskie Commission on Access to Civil Legal Services, and the U.S. Commission on the Glass Ceiling.\n\nJoanne is excited to continue her work as a coach and mentor with the next and future generations of advocates, political activists, and social justice warriors.\n\nLinda Smith Dyer, lawyer and activist, was a founder of the Maine Women’s Lobby. In 1977 Linda traveled to the National Women’s Conference in Houston, Texas, having been elected at a state meeting to be one of 19 women representing the state of Maine at this prestigious national conference. The following year she helped organize a statewide conference in Augusta to discuss the needs of Maine women. During the 1970’s, in addition to supporting the Equal Rights Amendment, Linda Smith Dyer lent her support to innovative legislative reforms that would have provided assistance to displaced homemakers and victims of domestic violence, breakthrough issues that the Maine Legislature had never previously been confronted with. In 1977-78, several bills, including funding for domestic violence programs, were not enacted in the waning days of the Legislative session even though the bills had widespread public support and unanimous conunittee endorsements. Linda and a small group of Maine women decided that their lack of permanent presence at the State House would not be repeated. Consequently, Linda Dyer sent out a call to arms to other activists to organize a Maine “Women’s Lobby,” the purpose of which would be to create a fulltime presence for women in the halls of the Maine Legislature and to put an end to the death-by-neglect of major pieces of legislation significant to women in the notorious late night bargains reached at the “Appropriations Table” or through closed-door back-room deals.\n\nIn 1978 Linda Dyer, with two other women (Janet Mills and Lois Reckitt) who had attended the Houston and Augusta conferences, organized the Maine Women’s Lobby, a one-of-a-kind non-profit membership organization, unique in the nation, based on $2 dues, extremely low overhead, and a less than shoestring budget. The first Board of the Maine Women’s Lobby hired a fall time, professional lobbyist to represent the views of Maine women at the State House and Legislature. The Lobby has funded a full time lobbyist at the Maine Legislature since 1979.\n\nUnder Linda’s leadership and as a result of her dedication, the Lobby has become one of the most successful organizations of its type in the nation and has had an enduring impact on the lives and health of women in Maine. In the last 22 years the Lobby has not only survived but endured and flourished, developing a longstanding reputation as a thoughtful, knowledgeable and powerful presence in the halls of the State House.\n\nLinda is an attorney and graduate of the University of Maine School of Law. She has been an active member of the Bar and served as President of the Maine State Bar Association in 1998. As Bar President, Linda urged women attorneys to become more involved and assume leadership roles in an organization and profession dominated by men. Through her own positive example, she demonstrated to women both within and outside the profession that hard work and commitment could make a difference.\n\nLinda is 52 and grew up in Monmouth, Maine. She lives in Winthrop with her husband, Charles Jacobs, and daughter Lauren Jacobs. She has twin sons from a prior marriage, Rick and Skip Dyer, both of whom were high school Merit Scholars and graduates of Stanford University.\n\n1998 Photograph\n\nInducted March 2001\n\nIn 1984, ten years after her brother, William’s murder, federal laws were enacted to protect the rights of crime victims. Although not aware of it at the time of her brother’s death, the passing of these laws put Mary on a path that led to a career in victim advocacy.\n\nMary Farrar studied at the University of Maine at Farmington. She was hired by the Somerset District Attorney’s Office in February of 1990. For six years she advocated for children and adult victims of sexual assault, and victims of domestic violence, aggravated assaults and attempted murders. In addition to being an advocate, Mary educated crime victims about their rights as victims, encouraged them to exercise those rights, and guided them through the criminal justice system.\n\nThe State of Maine Office of the Attorney General hired Mary in 1996, where she worked for fourteen years providing direct services to surviving families and friends of murder victims.\n\nThe Maine Chapter of Parents of Murdered Children welcomed her as their victim advocate. More importantly, they embraced her into their unique group as a fellow family member of a murdered victim. She is on the board of directors and remains an active member. The members of the Maine Chapter continue to provide her with emotional support and friendship and are her extended family.\n\nMary was instrumental in the planning and success of the Maine Chapter’s first Victim’s Rights Week in 2006, and in organizing Maine’s first National Day of Remembrance for Murdered Victims in 2007. These have become annual remembrance programs and continue to be events that raise awareness about the aftermath of murder.\n\nMary was the State of Maine Office of the Attorney General Employee of the Year in 2000. She has served as a member of many elected and appointed panel positions throughout her career, including: the Maine Homicide Review Panel, the Department of Corrections Victim’s Advisory Group, the Maine Elder Death Review Panel, and the Maine Commission to End Domestic Violence and Sexual Assault. Mary has testified before Maine Legislative Committees, and is a past panel member for the Impact of Crime Program at the Maine Correctional Center and the Maine Correctional Reentry Network as a representative and advisor for the crime victim community. In 2010 she was a member of a working group involved in a bill for the enactment of Elder Abuse legislation.\n\nShe has also facilitated training on trauma and death notification practices for the Muskie School Social Worker Studies at the University of Southern Maine and the Maine State Police, local law enforcement agencies and Emergency Medical Services in Southern Maine.\n\nIn December 2009, Mary was hired by the Department of Corrections as a victim advocate. She provided services in regard to restitution and notification of release of prisoners to crime victims.\n\nAfter twenty-one years of services to crime victims, she retired from her position as a Victim Advocate in October 2011. She continues to serve on the Department of Correction’s Victim Advisory Group and work on behalf of crime victim’s rights as well as watch over legislative bills that have a direct impact on crime victims.\n\nMary received the distinguished Father Ken Czillinger Professional Award from the National Organization of Parents of Murdered Children in August of 2011 for her contribution, dedication and sensitivity to the victims of violent crime.\n\nLaura A. Fortman has dedicated her adult life to improving the lives of Maine women and girls. In fact, thousands of women who have never heard Laura’s name have benefited from her tireless work on their behalf.\n\nLaura was once a single parent trying to make ends meet while putting her education and commitment to women to best use. She spent three years working at the Women’s Resource Center in Portsmouth, New Hampshire before moving to Maine in the mid-1980s. At a time when sexual assault and domestic violence services were still struggling grassroots and marginalized programs, she was the successful Executive Director of the Sexual Assault Crisis and Support Center in Augusta. She was a well-known and very visible spokesperson for women and children rendered invisible by sexual assault and domestic violence.\n\nLaura’s contributions as a key leader in the anti-violence movement in Maine are one example of the enduring value of her contribution to women. Always conscious of the need to couple support and empowerment of individual women with broad based social change and problem-solving, she not only managed the agency, but she also served as a statewide leader and advocate across the state. Importantly, she has consistently coupled her advocacy on behalf of women and girls with nurturing leadership in others, mentoring many young and not so young, women at the Maine Women’s Policy Center.\n\nAs Executive Director of the Maine Women’s Lobby and the Maine Women’s Policy Center for over a decade, she was the voice for women and girls in the Legislature, speaking to the full array of circumstances affecting women, including health care, reproductive rights, economic security, discrimination, and education. In the legislative and policy arena, she helped to pass Maine’s Reproductive Privacy Act, insurance coverage for contraception, a resolution requiring the Department of Labor to implement Maine’s Equal Pay Act, Maine’s Parents as Scholars program empowering welfare recipients to access higher education, the ground-breaking employment leave for victims of violence law, and unemployment insurance protection for part-time workers and for victims of violence, among many others. Through her leadership on the Commission to Study the Unemployment Compensation System, the Commission to Study the Costs and Benefits of Paid Family Medical Leave, the Maine Health Care Performance Council, and many others, she brought the voices of women to the policymaking process.\n\nAppointed Commissioner of the Maine Department of Labor in 2003, Fortman brought her management and political competence to the state’s workforce development system. Under her leadership, that system has developed new standards for helping women attain professional and economic success, fostering, first and foremost, equal pay for women and long-term security for Maine’s families and communities. In her tenure, the wage gap has narrowed, and the state’s employment services have improved for women, offering better pay and a wider range of jobs, including nontraditional occupations. Laura Fortman has been a tireless advocate for improving the social, economic, and political lives of Maine women and girls. Her work has truly touched the lives of every woman in Maine.\n\n2007 Photograph\n\nEthel “Billie” Wilson Gammon is a Mother, Grandmother, Teacher, Humanitarian, and the innovative Founder of the Washburn-Norlands Living History Center. A community minded citizen and activist, Billie’s background has included teaching Sunday School, being a Girl Scout leader and a youth leader of high school students, organizing the first senior citizens’ group in the community and a reading club at the North Livermore Library.\n\nBillie’s most enduring endeavor has involved the Norlands, historic home of the famous Washburn family. Billie became interested in the Norlands library in 1954, and that interest became a lifelong passion to pursue her visions of the Living History Center that the Washburn farm has become.\n\nBillie became the volunteer Executive Director of the Norlands Living History Center, negotiating the establishment of a Foundation and the transfer of ownership from the members of the Washburn family to the Foundation in 1973. With some help from other volunteers, Billie has worked intently to preserve the mansion of 23 rooms, the large barn, church, library, schoolhouse, office building, two carriage sheds and about 450 acres of land. Extensive fund-raising efforts have been essential, and Billie has devoted much time and skill to this endeavor, working to secure grants and private donations over many years.\n\nAlways a teacher, Billie has never stopped developing educational programs at Norlands. Young women from Maine and other states have come as interns for periods of six months or a year, and have lived, learned, studied, and worked to earn college credits. Many girls attending the learning center have gone on to become history majors, to teach or to work in museums because of Billie’s influence.\n\nBillie organized “Live-Ins” which are held Friday to Monday periodically throughout the year. Women, girls, teachers, and even families may attend, having the unique experience of living, learning and working as was done in the 1800s. This program attracts people from many parts of the country. Maine children also benefit from the Living History Center with whole classes of schoolchildren arriving by bus to spend a day in this historic atmosphere where people who lived and worked on the Washburn farm a hundred years ago come to life in contemporary times in the roles played by current volunteers. Billie values this kind of “role playing” as an effective and memorable teaching procedure for people of all ages.\n\nAmong the many honors Billie has received are the Achievement Citation Award (AAUW of Maine, 1976), Outstanding Woman of the Year (Livermore/Livermore Falls Historical Society, 1976), Distinguished Achievement Award (University of Maine Farmington, 1976), Distinguished Alumni Award (University of Maine Machias, 1979), Honorary Membership (Delta Kappa Gamma, 1980), Jefferson Award (1983), Maine Historic Preservation Award (1983), Woman of the Year (Business and Professional Women, 1988), Appreciation Award (North East Regional Conference on the Social Studies, 1991), and “Recognition of 34 years as Director of Norlands” from the Maine Senate and House of Representatives (1988).\n\nThe Norlands Living History Museum has become a valuable reality for the people of Maine because of Billie Gammon’s foresight and determination in the pursuit of her vision for it. Beyond her tireless efforts to make this dream come true, Billie’s smile and her enthusiasm are contagious and have endeared her to everyone who has become a friend of Norland’s. Billie’s life is a testimonial of what an innovative and determined woman can accomplish.\n\n1997 Photograph\n\nInducted March 1997\n\nProfessor Caroline Gentile, a nationally known educator in the field of Health, Physical Education and Recreation, has been teaching physical education at the University of Maine at Presque Isle for 54 years. Her dream was to build a physical education program that would serve the County, the State, and the regions beyond. Over the years, the program gained a reputation for excellence around New England and has remained in good standing throughout her tenure.\n\nProfessor Gentile’s leadership role at UMPI is legendary. She has served on and chaired every University committee, and for twenty years chaired the Division of Health, Physical Education and Recreation. She has also served on the Governor’s Advisory Commission on HPER.\n\nCaroline Gentile’s greatest contribution to the welfare of women has been her outstanding abilities as a teacher and role model. A perfectionist, she demands the best from her students. Her ethics, integrity, discipline, motivation and professionalism are reflected in the success of many of her graduates, including Major General Mary Morgan of the U.S. Army; Bonnie Tyler, nominated in 1991 as Physical Education Teacher of the Year for the United States; and Sherry Abbott Deschaine, who retired in 1998 as Professor Emerita of Physical Education at Bates College. The achievements of these women and many others have been passed on to the next generation as an enduring legacy of the many exemplary qualities of their mentor — Caroline Gentile.\n\nIn November, Miss Gentile received the Outstanding Leadership Award from the Maine Association of Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance. During the banquet, the presenter asked if those present who had had Miss Gentile for a teacher would stand up. In a crowded Samoset dining hall, half of the people in the room rose to their feet.\n\nHer concern for women’s issues is evidenced by her active participation in the National Federation of Business and Professional Women’s Clubs since 1947, in the American Association of University Women, and in Delta Kappa Gamma. She is a community advocate for women and was a gubernatorial appointee to the Maine Commission for Women. In 1999 Professor Gentile was selected by the “Maine Sunday Telegram” to serve on a committee to identify the top 20 Maine athletes of the century. The person selected as the top Maine athlete of the century was a woman-Joan Benoit Samuelson. It seems fitting that Caroline Gentile will be inducted into the Maine Womens Hall of Fame along with Joan.\n\nMiss Gentile received a B.S. degree from Sargent College in 1946, an M.A. from New York University in 1949, and did further graduate work at the University of Wisconsin and Columbia University. She was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters from the University of Maine at Presque Isle in 1996.\n\n2000 Photograph\n\nInducted March 2000\n\nA ‘Drum Major for Justice’ leveraging educational expertise and community resources to promote positive leadership and equitable treatment of women and girls across Maine.\n\nNominated by Dr. Glenn A. Cummings, President University of Southern Maine\n\nArriving in Maine over a decade ago with ample experience in standing up for minority and underserved populations, as well as promoting leadership development to enhance their power, Dr. Joyce Taylor Gibson was selected as Dean of Lewiston-Auburn College (LAC), and was eager to serve the near 80% female student body. Joyce hails from a Mississippi family that was heavily engaged in the Civil Rights movement, one where her parents taught her the invaluable worth of every human being, where she cut her teeth on ‘doing the right thing’ to defend those marginalized in our society. With this family and history of standing up for others, she led and sustained a variety of initiatives to strengthen women students, faculty and staff at the college, university and community levels. It was her experience, confidence and strong belief in equity, fairness and justice that permeated her Deanship, leveraged her influence with hundreds of students, faculty and community leaders, and built her reputation as a fierce warrior for social justice. Some of these activities included:\n\nSupporting, Sustaining Programs focused on Women’s Developments. This work included promoting university-business partnerships to create new internships, support successful programs housed at LAC such as New Ventures, and seeking scholarships for LAC students; creating joint programs with Middlesex Community College and other community agencies to help sustain and expand programs with primarily female students, such as Nursing, Occupational Therapy and the Social Sciences. She is an Associate faculty in USM’s Women and Gender Studies program and a 2016 recipient of the Mary Ann Hartman Award from the Women, Gender and Sexuality Program at UMaine Orono, honoring her educational achievements.\n\nAddressing inequities and unfairness in policies and practices at the university and Androscoggin community. Challenging the imbalance in salaries of USM women faculty, and conducting research with USM faculty, and Deans through a National Science Foundation grant to address the gap in recruitment, retention and promotion of women in STEM and Social Science fields at USM are examples of work important to her. Her collaborations with educators and parents in the local schools focused on reducing discrimination against new immigrant and refugee children, and trouble-shooting with parents to ensure that equitable services were available for integrating new families into the schools. These interests led to her appointment by the Lewiston mayor in 2016 to a team of citizens to examine the needs of the immigrant and refugee population and to make recommendations to the Lewiston City Council, to improve services for current and future residents. This year-long study culminated in a report, The Immigrant and Refugee Integration and Policy Development Working Group Report, that brought new policies and important changes to the lives of immigrants and other underserved people in the city.\n\nPromoting leadership development for future women leaders of Maine. Along with fostering leadership roles of women within the college, Joyce was invited to work with the celebrated Maine New Leadership program of the Margaret Chase Smith Policy Center, where she helped educate and mentor college women in civic and political leadership for Maine’s future. Introducing middle and high school girls to leadership came through work with the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute, and a network of professional women who collaborated on programs that built skills and confidence that enhanced the development of these younger girls. Her observations about women’s leadership in higher education led to new research with a group of her colleagues who studied the incidence of women presidents in the Northeast, including Maine; their first article published in the International Journal of Leadership and Change was “Leading through the Messy Middle: Women Presidents of Maine Colleges and Universities”.\n\nInfluencing policy and practices for creating a more inclusive, diverse and equitable community has been the underlying focus of her work throughout her tenure. The impact of this work cannot be overstated, as Maine and the nation prepare for a more multicultural society in this century. Her influence in the state-wide Diversity Council at the UMaine System, her years of participation with Maine’s ACLU, her work with local and state-wide immigrant organizations, and her specific roles at USM as faculty lead of the Inclusion, Diversity, Equity Council and Advisor to the President, have positively impacted the lives of countless, students, faculty, staff and alumni.\n\nThe struggle for the recognition and achievement of the rights of women has a dedicated champion in Ellen Golden. Her decision to make a positive difference in women’s rights comes from a lifetime commitment to social and economic justice and knowledge of the history and current conditions of women in our society. In both her personal and professional lives, Ellen has been an advocate for the needs and rights of women in general and for the needs and rights of women business owners in particular.\n\nIn the mid-1980’s, with the aid and support of CEI, a private non-profit community development corporation, Ellen found an ideal position from which to work on behalf of Maine’s women business owners. She discovered that although women were starting businesses at twice the rate of men, there was little information about their experiences. Her subsequent pioneering research helped to define the characteristics of and challenges facing Maine women entering a traditionally man’s world.\n\nAction followed research. In collaboration with Maine’s technical college system, Ellen organized a statewide series of seminars for women business owners. For a more permanent resource, Ellen started the state’s first targeted business counseling program for women at CEI. Its Women’s Business Center, with funding from the US Small Business Administration (SBA), has helped over 15,000 Maine women start and manage their businesses. To ensure the continuity of this work, Ellen has hired and coached younger women who currently staff the WBC. Ellen has also promoted micro and small business financing – at CEI, in Maine and nationally – to increase financing for women business owners. As a result, more than 1,000 women entrepreneurs across the state have received over $46 million in capital from CEI.\n\nThroughout her career, Ellen has worked to build a stronger infrastructure for women as business owners. She developed and delivered training to bankers, business counselors and others to help them work more effectively with women business owners while training women to understand better how to access business resources. She was a founder of the Association of Women’s Business Centers which successfully advocated with Congress for sustaining funding for the WBC program nationally. She founded MicroNet, a statewide microenterprise association, in 1994 to share best practices, coordinate services, develop policy and train practitioners across New England in microenterprise development. In recognition of her contributions, she received state and regional awards from the US SBA for her advocacy on behalf of women, minorities and financial services as well as the 20th Anniversary Star Award from the Maine Centers for Women, Work and Community.\n\nEllen’s volunteer activity has shown her dedication to women, complemented her work and created a lasting impact on Maine women. Her presence on the boards of organizations such as the Maine Commission for Women, SBA Advisory Council for Maine, Association for Enterprise Opportunity and the National Commission on Women’s Voices in the Economy has ensured that women’s issues were raised and women’s voices heard.\n\nHer tenure as a board member of the Maine Women’s Lobby illustrates her role as a volunteer. In the early 1990’s, she chaired an Economics Task Force which turned its attention to sexual harassment as a barrier to economic security. The result was first in the nation legislation mandating workplace training in sexual harassment. Ultimately, the task force led to the founding of the Maine Women’s Policy Center, the Lobby’s sister organization which improves the social, political and economic status of Maine women and girls through research, education and leadership development. When she returned to the Lobby Board in 2008, her experience with organizational development helped the Lobby through a leadership transition and prepared it to move forward as an important resource for Maine women and girls.\n\nCommunication has been at the center of Ellen’s advocacy in support of women’s economic development. Statistics make women visible, but stories make statistics meaningful. Whether it has been testifying before Congress on women business ownership and microenterprise development or presenting at events in Maine, nationally or internationally or in private conversations, Ellen has told and will continue to tell the story of women’s experiences and accomplishments.\n\nInducted 2015\n\nAmong Dorothy Murphy Healy’s roles in life were those of turkey farmer, teacher and Director of Development for Westbrook College. But she is most noted and best remembered for her tireless efforts to collect and preserve the novels, stories, diaries, journals, letters and memorabilia of noted Maine women writers; and most especially for her loving diligence in uncovering the writings of many, many unsung Maine women who, in fact, were pioneers in many fields of literature.\n\nFrom 1967 until her death in 1990, Mrs. Healy was curator of The Maine Women Writers Collection which she co-founded in 1959. Each year she gave between 50 and 60 public lectures on the Collection, and annually ran several conferences, book openings and literary receptions at the Collection’s house in Westbrook College.\n\nThe extent and importance of the Collection cannot be overstated. From a modest beginning, it has expanded to more than 4,000 volumes. These volumes represent the work of over 400 Maine women writers and 200 additional authors whose publications are closely related in focus. In 1986, Down East magazine described the Collection as “…an extraordinary contribution to Maine’s literary heritage … probably the finest assemblage of its kind in the United States today.” Of Dorothy Healy, Down East declares: “(this) literary treasure would never have been as valuable without the wisdom, energy and enthusiasm devoted to it over the years by its co-founder and (since 1967) its curator, office staff, and public relations director, all rolled into one.”\n\nIndeed, Mrs. Healy dedicated herself for over thirty years to securing rare and valuable materials, cataloging and caring for them and making their availability and existence known to the public. And while her great personal interest was in discovering writings from the nineteenth century, she eagerly acquired the latest works of many women who are currently enhancing Maine’s literary reputation. But perhaps the most unique acquisitions in the Collection are the many works by Maine women who, though their names may not be familiar today, were true pioneers in a variety of literary fields. These authors were rescued from obscurity by Dorothy Healy.\n\nDorothy M. Healy is honored here for her dedication to the Maine women who wrote and the world of women who are now able to read and study these authors. Mrs. Healy has rescued women of the past, enlightened women of the present, and bequeathed a treasure to women of the future.\n\n1988 Photograph\n\nInducted March, 1993\n\nSince 1979, Karen Heck has dedicated her professional career to bettering the lives of women and girls throughout the State of Maine. Through her tireless efforts and far-sighted vision, she has advanced a broad spectrum of women’s issues, including reproductive rights, economic security, literacy, safety, and health. To put it quite simply, the hallmark of her life has been to make life better for all women and girls in whatever way she can.\n\nKaren has an endless supply of energy for working to promote women’s issues in Maine. She has worked both locally and statewide for a variety of causes and countless programs have benefited from her attention over the past twenty-five years. Her efforts most recently have resulted in the widely acclaimed Hardy Girls Healthy Women, Inc., which she co-founded in 2000 with Lyn Mikel Brown and Lynn Cole as an outgrowth of their annual girls’ conference, Girls Unlimited! Hardy Girls programs offer diverse learning experiences ranging from media literacy, self-esteem, adventure and career opportunities, in all of which Karen has been a guiding light.\n\nIn addition to Karen’s work with Hardy Girls, she has been a principal for more than ten years in The Avalon Group, a consulting company focused on women’s and girls’ health issues. She also is a Senior Program Officer for The Bingham Program, a charitable endowment that promotes health and advances in medicine in Maine. Prior to these endeavors, during her tenure with the Kennebec Valley Community Action Program, Karen focused much of her attention on family planning and reproductive rights, and promoting fair taxation and universal healthcare.\n\nKaren has volunteered thousands of hours in her role as a community activist, fundraiser and champion for women’s rights. It would be virtually impossible to list all of the wonderful causes to which Karen has applied her energy, iron-willed determination and unbridled enthusiasm.\n\nKaren is committed to making Maine a great place. She helped found the Peace in Our Communities Task Force, is a member of the American Association of University Women and Bridges for Peace and Justice, a member and past president of the Waterville Rotary, the current Vice President of Waterville Main Street, past president of the Coalition and Family Planning Providers’ group, a past board member of the Maine Women’s Fund, founder and past board member of Safe Abortions for Everyone, and has volunteered her time to help in various ways with the Mid Maine United Way, the Waterville Boys and Girls Club, the Mid Maine Homeless Shelter as well as for various Maine women’s political candidacies.\n\nAlthough Karen doesn’t look for acknowledgment of her accomplishments, she has received recognition and accolades in many forms. Most recently, she was awarded the Maine Statewide AAUW 2006 Achievement Citation Award, the highest award for extraordinary community involvement in women’s issues. In 2002, Karen was awarded the Business and Professional Women’s Women of the Year Award, together with Lyn Brown and Lynn Cole, for their work founding Hardy Girls Healthy Women.\n\nThroughout her more than twenty-five years of working in Maine, Karen has brought wisdom, creativity and strength to the table for women and girls. In all her professional and volunteer work, Karen has made life in the state of Maine the way life should be for women and girls. She has been a mentor, a friend and an ally to tens of hundreds of women, young and old, helping in ways large and small. It is with great honor that her sister Janet Heck Doyle and Hardy Girls Healthy Women have nominated Karen for the 2008 Maine Women’s Hall of Fame.\n\n2007 Photograph\n\nInducted March, 2008\n\nDr. Nancy H. Hensel is President of the University of Maine at Presque Isle, having moved into this position in 1999 from the University of Maine at Farmington where she served first as Dean of the College of Education, Health and Rehabilitation (1992-95) and then as Provost and Vice President for Academic Affairs (1995-99). Before her affiliation with UMF, she lived and worked in California. She received both her bachelor’s and master’s degrees from California State University, San Francisco, and her doctorate from the University of Georgia. Her academic preparation has concentrated most heavily on early childhood education, and throughout her career, her professional research, writings and presentations have focused on a variety of issues related to women’s equity.\n\nAs a leader in higher education in Maine, Dr. Hensel has led several efforts that significantly benefit the citizens of Maine. She chaired the state Committee on Results Based Teacher Certification, which developed the ten standards for teacher education that are now used to certify all Maine teachers. Her strong leadership, staying the course in a very difficult change process, resulted in a teacher education certification process that is noted nationwide as exemplary and has led to Maine having some of the best-prepared teachers in the country.\n\nIn her work at Presque Isle, she led the effort to establish the Houlton Higher Education Center, where individuals, especially women who are place-bound by family and other responsibilities, can receive work training, complete their GED, or earn a college degree in their own community. The Center is a partnership of the University of Maine at Presque Isle; the Northern Maine Technical College; Women, Work and Community; and the Houlton Adult Education Program. It was Dr. Hensel’s efforts that coordinated the planning of this one-stop education center, including working with state legislators to obtain funding. Because of her efforts, this innovative Center now serves as a model throughout Maine and rural areas elsewhere to address the training and education needs of individuals, especially women, for whom traditional education programs do not work.\n\nThroughout her career, Dr. Hensel has been a tireless advocate for women, constantly exploring the complex issues facing women and the many intersections of issues that are unique to women in today’s society. She has, in her writings and professional presentations, explored over and over again, in many ways, the question, “How is balance struck for women?”\n\nIn her professional work, she has constantly studied, researched, and written on women’s issues. Her 1991 groundbreaking monograph was the first of its kind to focus on the impact of maternity and child rearing on university tenure; this monograph has since had significant impact on university campuses nationwide as leaders have increasingly sought to address the issues of tenure, maternity leave, and women’s roles in the higher education power structure.\n\nDr. Hensel serves as both a professional and personal model for women who seek to become leaders with integrity. She has achieved a remarkable career and has a strong sense of herself, but her actions come from a selfless place. In an environment traditionally dominated by males, she has taken a chair at the leadership table while remaining true to herself, governed by her intelligence and sense of justice, and she has led other women by her example.\n\nNot to be overlooked are the challenges she establishes for herself personally. Her friends have marveled at her personal focus on adventure and exploration of the unknown. From seats of comfort, they have cheered her on as she has explored the flora and fauna of the Amazon, the icy environment of the South Pole, and with great respect, waited for word as she traveled to Tanzania and climbed Mt. Kilimanjaro. Dr. Hensel sets persona’ goals for herself that unintentionally built deep respect for her among her friends and colleagues, both female and male alike.\n\nAs Dr. Hensel takes her place in the Maine Women’s Hall of Fame, all citizens of Maine should be proud that ten years ago she chose Maine as her home. Women throughout the state, her friends, colleagues, and even those who do not know her personally have benefited, and will continue to benefit, significantly from that choice.\n\n2003 Photograph\n\nInducted March 2003\n\nJudith Magyar Isaacson is an educator, a well-known author, a champion of equal opportunity for women, and a human-rights advocate whose passion was forged by her experiences in the Holocaust.\n\nShe was born in Kaposvar, Hungary, in 1925. When she was 19, her family was deported to Auschwitz¬≠Birkenau, where her grandmothers and an aunt were gassed upon arrival. From there, Judith, her mother, Rozsa, and her aunt Magda Rosenberger were sent to a slave labor camp in Hessisch Lichtenau, a satellite of Buchenwald. They lost the rest of their family in the Holocaust, including Judith’s father, Jeno, who perished at MiihldorfLager. Miraculously, the three women were liberated together in Leipzig by American forces in April 1945.\n\nJudith met Irving Isaacson, a captain in the U.S. Army Office of Strategic Services, a month later. They married that year and came to the United States in 1946. Today Judith and Irving, an attorney, have three children and seven grandchildren.\n\nJudith Isaacson earned a bachelor’s degree in mathematics at Bates College in 1965 and a master’s in math at Bowdoin College two years later. She taught math at Lewiston High School and then at Bates, where she became the dean of women in 1969 and dean of students in 1975.\n\nAs dean, Isaacson was instrumental in ending practices biased against women – for example, in athletics and in separate, drastically unequal codes of conduct for men and women. At the same time, she emerged as a public advocate of women’s rights. She continued to work for those rights as a member of the Bowdoin College Board of Overseers from 1984 to 1996.\n\nIn 1976, after discussing her wartime experiences with a group of students, Isaacson was moved to record those memories. Seed of Sarah: Memoirs of a Survivor was published by the University of Illinois Press in 1990. It won glowing notices in The New York Times Book Review and The Boston Globe, was placed on the New York Public Library’s “Books for the Teen Age” list, and became a valued source for Holocaust research and women’s studies. Isaacson’s papers are available to researchers at the Edmund S. Muskie Archives and Special Collections Library at Bates.\n\nSeed of Sarah has appeared in German and Hungarian translations, and was adapted by Maine composer Mark Polishook for an opera and subsequent film. The book continues to sell worldwide and has brought increasing demand for Isaacson’s services as a speaker. She has appeared frequently before student groups and other audiences to share her memories and speak out for fair and equal treatment of all people.\n\nIn addition to her board service to Bowdoin College, Isaacson has served on the governing boards of the Auburn Public Library, Central Maine Medical Center, and the CMMA Nursing School. She has received honorary doctorates from Bates, Colby College, and the University of New England; and received both the University of New England’s Deborah Morton Award and the Hargraves Preservation of Freedom Prize, established at Bowdoin to stimulate appreciation of Constitutional rights and freedoms.\n\nMost important, Seed of Sarah over the years has become an enduring inspiration of courage and resilience for young women and men.\n\n2004 Photograph\n\nInducted March, 2004\n\nReproductive rights and justice have been Judy’s passion for her entire life. Because of her father’s work, it is difficult to say when she first became involved with family planning and reproductive health—perhaps before she was born! She has been interested in issues surrounding women, families, and cultural diversity for many years.\n\nIt was her first career as wife of Stanley Kahrl, and mother of four children that broadened her activism beyond family planning. During the 1960s, she championed childbirth education so that women could have increased choices concerning anesthesia during delivery. At a time when only 15% of women in the US breastfed their babies, she became involved with La Leche League, a women-led organization, which promoted breastfeeding. She served on the board of directors of La Leche League International. Other board experience included Planned Parenthood of Central Ohio, Columbus School for Girls, and the Columbus Academy. Her work experience included being the first Diversity and Coeducation Coordinator at Columbus Academy.\n\nJudy also served on the board of directors of Pathfinder International for over five decades. She has traveled to visit Pathfinder programs in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Most recently she visited Mozambique, Ethiopia, and Tanzania. The last included visiting a program which integrated conservation with reproductive health programs.\n\nJudy moved to Maine from Ohio in 1996. Living on an old farm in Maine, she feels she has “come home.” Judy has been involved with local land conservation efforts of the Kennebec Estuary Land Trust (KELT). She served on the Forest Conservation Collaborative and the Friends of Catalytic Conservation of The Nature Conservancy, both of which made grants for innovative programs in the developing world.\n\nDuring her travels abroad with Pathfinder, she saw the influence of grandmothers in their communities. In 2013, Judy founded Grandmothers for Reproductive Rights (GRR!) to turn older women’s anger into energy to fight restrictions on sexual and reproductive health, rights and justice. Judy’s vision has had a direct impact on women and girl in Maine: sexual and reproductive health and justice have an influence on every issue, including poverty, education, climate change, the health of our environment, war and immigration.\n\nGRR! focuses on investing in the leadership development and growth of personal power in older women activists to amplify their voices and effect change. Generations of lived experience fuel determination to combat attacks on reproductive freedom. Older women offer hope and perspective to younger women, along with modelling persistence. Elders join with younger women to shake off the stigma that too often holds us back from speaking out. This work combats the tendency in our culture for older women to become invisible.\n\nJudy has been honored with the Sarah Orne Jewitt Award from the Maine Women’s Fund; an award from the Mabel Wadsworth Center for her creativity and leadership to advance reproductive justice; the David and Sherry Huber Award presented to Judy and GRR!; and a lifetime achievement award from Pathfinder International.\n\nJudy is excited to see so many older women become activists to protect sexual and reproductive rights and justice more widely in Maine and spreading across the country. They hope younger generations will be able to exercise those rights for which they fought so hard\n\nInducted March 2022\n\nDr. Theodora J. Kalikow, President of the University of Maine at Farmington (UMF), is an unassuming individual who quietly runs one of Maine’s finest educational institutions. Dr. Kalikow’s strengths include inspiring women, contributing to the community locally and statewide, volunteering on numerous committees, and offering educational opportunities to hundreds of women and men.\n\nLeading the Maine Academic Management Institute (ME-AMI), President Kalikow is a visionary who has been a significant force in providing a forum for professional development for women in academia throughout Maine and in actively supporting leadership education for Maine women. Her commitment to and involvement in ME-AMI has markedly influenced the lives and careers of women with whom she has collaborated. Her values, directness, unassuming nature, kindness, “can-do” attitude, and sense of humor make her a fine role model for women learning leadership skills. She also engages in considerable one-on-one mentoring of women, using her wide network of contacts to help women advance professionally.\n\nPresident Kalikow was instrumental in establishing the Women’s Studies Program at UMF, which affects women and men students every year. Under her watch, UMF also achieved national recognition as the top liberal arts college in its region. She is known statewide as a model for establishing outstanding town-gown relationships with the people of Farmington. When UMF’s Mantor Library needed upgrading, she orchestrated a successful fundraising campaign with the town’s public library, which was also in need of substantial renovation.\n\nThe enduring value of President Kalikow’s commitment to women is noteworthy. As a university president, she has been a model for many women. Her influence in Maine has been to encourage and empower women to reach for higher goals than they would have without her influence. As a leader and manager, she is positive, direct, open, honest, and appreciative of the diverse viewpoints of those around her. Her commitment to education runs deep and is a way to help make the world a better place to live in. Women who meet her quickly understand her values and feel encouraged to act on their own.\n\nOver the past decade, groups in Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Colorado have honored President Kalikow. In 2000 she received the Maryann Hartman Award from the University of Maine’s Women’s Studies Program. Her intelligence, hard work, and focused commitment to her goals has earned her the respect of the people she has worked with and recognition by many organizations in Maine and beyond.\n\n1997 Photograph\n\nInducted March 2002\n\nThe oldest child of a Navy family, Bishop Chilton Knudsen grew up in several parts of the world. Military life taught her to subordinate the interests of self to the mission at hand and to adopt an inner stance of respect toward all people. In her early life she dreamed of being a medical missionary. In college she became interested in the social issues of Vietnam, the environment, civil rights and women’s rights.\n\nIn an Episcopal Church deeply divided about the proposed ministry of women, a historic vote in 1976 did open the priesthood to women, and on the next day, Chilton Knudsen announced her call to the ministry. She completed years of study in the ordination process and received her M.Div. from Seabury-Western Theological Seminary in 1980. As a church leader, she assumed many responsibilities, including pastoral care for clergy and their families, crisis intervention, teaching, and ministry development.\n\nShe was elected Bishop of Maine in November 1997, the only woman among a slate of five nominees, and is still one of only five women diocesan Episcopal bishops, out of 110 dioceses. Since her election, 38 Maine women have been ordained to the orders of Deacon and Priest, serving congregations in every region of the state from Presque Isle to Eastport, from Norway to Dover-Foxcroft. Thirty-nine congregations in the state benefit from some level of ordained ministry by women. With Bishop Knudsen’s leadership and vision, Maine leads the nation in the percentage or women leading congregations.\n\nAs a religious leader in Maine, Bishop Knudsen has created a legacy for women and girls that will flourish long after her retirement, which is set for 2008. Her dedication to ensure that women are given full opportunity to serve in the leadership of the church and her surety of the ability of women to offer unique and important gifts in the area of pastoral care have made an indelible impression on the lives of many women and men in Maine.\n\nUnder Bishop Knudsen’s leadership the Episcopal Diocese of Maine is committed to keep the doors of its smallest churches open. It is there, she posits – in the small rural communities that are economically stressed – that the Church is needed most. In many communities the Episcopal Church is where social services are housed: the literacy program, the jobs program, the local food and clothing bank. Many of these smaller congregations are served by women priests and deacons who have been raised up by their local congregations to serve. Women and families across Maine benefit from the social programs that thrive at the local level because the Bishop’s support to struggling communities refuses to wane.\n\nBishop Knudsen, and the women clergy she nurtures, provide Maine girls and young women, Sunday by Sunday, exemplars of leadership, courage, and confidence in a highly respected role of each community’s life. Bishop Knudsen’s contribution to young women, and not-so-young women, continues to benefit the people of Maine by providing a place for self-esteem and confidence to blossom and nourish far into future generations.\n\n2000 Photograph\n\nInducted March 2006\n\nFirst Female President of Thomas College, First Female President of the Maine Development Foundation, and First Female Maine State Economist\n\nThere is a reason why Laurie Lachance’s three career changes have landed her at the top of the fields of higher education, human development, and economics in her beloved State of Maine. Laurie has a profound understanding of the role that leveraging individual potential plays in the development of an economy. When it comes to human capital, Laurie believes that it’s at the heart of everything that we do and everything that we can achieve. That belief, along with the action steps that she has delivered over her entire career, have profoundly improved the aspirations of women across the State of Maine and beyond.\n\nIn her position as State Economist, Laurie emphasized the role that human capital plays in value-added economic development. As the leader of two great Maine institutions, she has maintained a laser-like focus on unlocking the innovation that resides within us all. Her move to higher education matched her rhetoric of two decades prior – that higher education is a key ingredient that promotes economic development.\n\nLaurie Lachance was born and raised in Dover-Foxcroft, Maine. A product of the humble beginnings that are part and parcel of a rural Maine upbringing, Laurie sought the best education that Maine had to offer. She earned her Bachelor’s degree from Bowdoin College, her Master’s degree from Thomas College, and was awarded an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Maine at Presque Isle.\n\nLaurie’s career began as an economist for Central Maine Power. As State Economist, she served an unprecedented three Maine governors: a Republican, an Independent, and a Democrat. During her eleven year tenure as State Economist she served as the chair of the Maine State Revenue Forecasting Commission, restoring public trust in the forecasting process. Her advocacy of promoting lower energy costs through restructuring of the market is one of many shining examples of her influence.\n\nLater in her career, Laurie turned her attention to human potential. In a letter of support to the Maine Women’s Hall of Fame Committee, Cheryl Miller of the Maine Development Foundation expressed what it was like to operate under the leadership of President Lachance in a work environment that was at times made up of all women. In Miller’s words, “she creates a culture of kindness and honesty…we all became more than we thought we ever could be, both professionally and as an organization. For those who know her, she is consistently one who inspires, empowers and affirms all those she touches. ”Her tenure at Thomas College has been characterized by growth and change. The College has flourished with new buildings, programs and playing fields along with major gains in student population. Thomas College is a business and liberal arts educational institution located in central Maine whose mission is to prepare students “for success in their personal and professional lives, and for leadership and service in their communities.”\n\nAs U.S. Senator and former Maine Governor Angus King said of Laurie in her nomination letter, “To each opportunity she brings the same abundant enthusiasm and unflagging optimism in the belief that positive thinking can overcome obstinate obstacles and turn the most hostile skeptics into ardent promoters of a new idea.” Senator King went on to add: “I guarantee that we haven’t yet realized all the great things that Laurie will introduce and make happen.”\n\nInducted 2014\n\nGail H. Laughlin was born Abbie Hill Laughlin at Robbinston, Maine (near Calais) in 1868. She was one of nine children. In 1890 she attended Wellesley College after spending four years as a bookkeeper, earning only $4.00 per week to pay for her tuition to college. In 1896 Gail Laughlin entered Cornell School of Law from which she graduated in 1898. Ms. Laughlin was the first woman from Maine to practice law. She moved to California to begin her work as an attorney, followed by a judgeship in San Francisco.\n\nGail Laughlin became involved in the suffrage movement (women’s right to vote) in New York, Ohio, Kentucky, Nebraska, and Minnesota. At that time, all travel was by stagecoach. As her involvement in women’s issues grew, she traveled to St. Louis in 1919 to attend a women’s organizational meeting which established the National Federation of Business and Professional Women’s Clubs. Gail Laughlin was elected the first president of this new organization which still exists today as an International association with over 100,000 members in the United States.\n\nIn 1924 Gail Laughlin returned to Portland, Maine where she opened a law firm with her brother, Fred. She became the president of a local Portland chapter of the Business and Professional Women’s Clubs in 1926, when the national convention was held there. She served three terms in the Maine House (1927-1934) and then three terms in the Maine Senate (1937-1941) and was the first woman with a law degree to be a member of the Maine legislature.\n\nGail Laughlin introduced and supported many pieces of legislation. Included were bills on the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, establishing an overseer to control the use of drugs, early environmental laws regarding waste dumping into Maine rivers, and obtaining funding for a 22,666 acre national wildlife preserve in Washington County in the 1930’s (now Moosehorn Wildlife Refuge). She was also instrumental in organizing the Department of Health.\n\nIn addition, she sponsored several bills which were instrumental in helping women. She sponsored An Act Relating to the Commitment of the Insane to stop husbands from committing their wives involuntarily. She supported a Registration Bureau for Nurses, an increase in the minimum wage and regulations, and sponsored a bill conferring equal rights of guardianship for father and mother. Perhaps one of the most important bills affecting girls involved changing the law permitting girls to marry at age 13 and boys at 15 to 16 years for girls and 18 years for boys.\n\nGail Laughlin died at the age of 84 in Portland, Maine.\n\n1920 Photograph\n\nInducted March, 1991\n\nDeeply committed to reproductive rights and equality for all women, Ruth L. Lockhart began her career in love for women’s health in the mid-1970’s when she volunteered as a receptionist for a local family planning program. Since then, she has accumulated more than 35 years of experience in the field of reproductive and sexual health care.\n\nAs a family planning counselor, Ruth found that providing women with the information they needed to make decisions about their own bodies created an empowering experience that had a profound and positive impact on their lives. She became an expert in women’s health issues and a local, state and regional trainer.\n\nRecognizing the need for an independent, community-based organization that could step up and speak out about issues of reproductive choice and lesbian rights when needed, a small group of five activists, including Ruth, decided to form a new non-profit in Bangor. With its founding in 1984, Mabel Wadsworth Women’s Health Center became and remains the only private, non-profit, freestanding, feminist health center in Maine and one of fewer than fifteen in the nation. Ruth served for many years on the Center’s board of directors and volunteered her spare time to work on organizational development and community education.\n\nRuth became director of the Bangor Sexually Transmitted Diseases Clinic in 1984. As one of the first AIDS educators in Maine, she presented educational sessions for diverse audiences throughout the state. Ruth served on the Governor’s Task Force on AIDS and was instrumental in forming the anonymous HIV/AIDS antibody testing program for City of Bangor and trained counselors to sensitively educate clients about the risks, benefits and results of HIV antibody testing.\n\nRuth continued this work when she became a Health Educator for the University of Maine and was its first professional AIDS educator. She organized and chaired UMaine’s AIDS Task Force and provided reproductive and sexual health programming campus-wide. She created peer educator programs, which gave students the opportunities to teach and learn from each other. Her Health education position grew to include coordination of the student women’s health services. She also co-chaired UMaine’s Rape and Sexual Assault Awareness Program and served on the Lesbian/Gay/Bisexual Concerns Committee.\n\nRuth was appointed Mabel Wadsworth Women’s Health Center first Executive Director in January of 1992. Her work since then has been wholly focused on developing Mabel Wadsworth Center into a premiere women’s health care provider, educator and advocate for women in Eastern and Northern Maine. The Center is now the only publicly available abortion provider north of Augusta. As a representative to many state, regional and national coalitions, including serving as chair of the Maine Choice Coalition, Ruth works tirelessly to advance the cause of women’s reproductive health and rights.\n\nBorn and raised in Fort Fairfield, Maine, Ruth is very proud of her Aroostook County roots. As a potato picker from first grade through high school, Ruth developed a strong work ethic that still guides her to this day. She graduated from the University of Southern Maine in the early 1970’s with a degree in elementary education and a certificate in special education/learning disabilities. Her work in rural public schools gave her a deep and lasting understanding of poverty in Maine as well as broadened her appreciation for different learning styles. She lives in Bangor with Peter Thibeau, her husband of 32 years. She is the proud mother of two grown children, Chad and Abby. Ruth is especially grateful to Sharon Barker, her friend for the past 50 years, for introducing her to Mabel Sine Wadsworth and to the field of reproductive health and rights and for envisioning Mabel Wadsworth Women’s Health Center.\n\nRuth’s vision is for a future where all women are in control of their lives all of the time – a world where feminist principles will benefit all people.\n\nDale McCormick has spent over three decades fighting for jobs, economic justice, health care for all, human rights, and equality for women. As a young child, she was fascinated with carpenter’s tools. That fascination has become a lifetime focus. Dale was the first woman in the country to complete a carpentry apprenticeship with the carpenter’s union. She is a member of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters local 1996, and has been a carpenter and contractor for 30 years.\n\nIn 1988, Dale founded Women Unlimited, a program that successfully trains women on welfare to compete for high-paying jobs in trade and technical occupations. Dale has, in her own way, become the Susan B. Anthony of today’s woman in striving to bring women aboard the work force with dignity, proper training, and fair pay. The results have been astounding and women have proven they are capable of any task they have been trained to undertake.\n\nDale helped found in 1984 and became the first President of the Maine Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance (now called Equality Maine), which advocates statewide for civil rights and better treatment for lesbian/gay/bi/transgender/and questioning people.\n\nShe was a co-founder of Northeast Women in Transportation, which educated women’s organizations around the country about the opportunities in the Federal Intermodal Surface Transportation and Efficiency Act (ISTEA) for increasing the number of women and minorities in the construction industry.\n\nMcCormick won a seat in the Maine Senate in 1990 and was re-elected twice in a conservative district. She was elected Treasurer of the State of Maine on December 4, 1996 and served 8 years. Dale is Maine’s first female Constitutional Officer.\n\nDale McCormick has a B.A. from the University of Iowa and has written two books: Against the Grain: A Carpentry Manual for Woman and Housemending: Home Repair For The Rest of Us.\n\nIn 2005 Governor John Baldacci appointed Dale as Director of the Maine State Housing Authority. This quasi-governmental organization each year finances the construction of $130 million of affordable housing, weatherizes 1000 homes, serves 48,000 households on heating assistance, gets the lead out of 200 homes, assists 8,000 Mainers with their rent, and helps 1000 Mainers buy their first home.\n\n2002 Photograph\n\nInducted March 2007\n\nWaterville, Maine\n\nAs an educator, Betty-Jane Stanhope Meader impacted and inspired young women and girls every day for 44 years, 41 of them at Thomas College.

Presently, she is the first diversity and inclusion chair on the AAUW of Maine board\n\nFor the first six years of her retirement, Betty-Jane was a member of the Board of Visitors at the University of Maine at Farmington, her alma mater, and where she met her husband, Dick, the men’s basketball coach at UMF. They have two sons, Lance, and Daren, and four grandchildren. Betty-Jane is a past state president and a present board member of the Maine Association of Family and Consumer Sciences, and is currently the membership chair of the Kappa Chapter of Delta Kappa Gamma, a society for key women educators. For seven years, Betty-Jane was a member of the Coalition/Alliance for Maine Women. Annually, she serves as a mentor at Girl’s Day at the State House.\n\nIn addition, Betty-Jane has never forgotten her roots in Dover-Foxcroft. A 1964 graduate of Foxcroft Academy, she later served on the board of trustees for five years. In 2014, she received the Dr. Mary Chandler Lowell Award “presented by the alumni and trustees in recognition of her many personal and professional achievements, which serve inspiration and encouragement to the students and graduates of Foxcroft Academy.” Betty-Jane continues to support and Academy and its students, as well as other young people in Maine and beyond.\n\nJessica Ulrika Meir, a first generation American and the youngest of five children, was born and raised in Caribou, Maine. Her childhood dream of becoming an astronaut came to fruition in 2013, when she was selected as one of the eight members of the 21st NASA astronaut class. She holds a Bachelor of Arts in Biology from Brown University, a Master of Science in Space Studies from the International Space University, and a Doctorate in Marine Biology from Scripps Institution of Oceanography (UCSD).\n\nFrom 2000 to 2003, Jessica worked for Lockheed Martin’s Human Research Facility (NASA Johnson Space Center), supporting human physiology research on the space shuttle and International Space Station. During this time, she also participated in research flights on NASA’s reduced gravity aircraft and served as an aquanaut crew member in the Aquarius underwater habitat for the 4th NASA Extreme Environment Mission Operations (NEEMO) mission.\n\nFor her Ph.D. research at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO), Jessica studied the diving physiology of marine mammals and birds, focusing on oxygen depletion in diving emperor penguins (Antarctic field research) and elephant seals (northern California). She investigated the high‐flying bar-headed goose during her post‐doctoral research at the University of British Columbia, training geese to fly in a wind tunnel while obtaining various physiological measurements in reduced oxygen conditions. In 2012, Jessica accepted a position as Assistant Professor at the Harvard Medical School/Massachusetts General Hospital, where she continued her research on the physiology of animals in extreme environments. She also took part in Smithsonian Institution diving expeditions to the Antarctic and Belize, and was highly active in scientific outreach efforts.\n\nIn the astronaut office, Jessica has extensive Mission Control Capsule Communicator (CapCom) experience, including serving as Lead CapCom for Expedition 47, the BEAM (Bigelow expandable module on the International Space Station) mission, and an HTV (Japanese Space Agency cargo vehicle) mission. She was also the ground IV (mission control communicator to spacewalking astronauts) for two International Space Station spacewalks. In 2016, Jessica served as a crew member on the European Space Agency (ESA) CAVES space analog caving mission in Sardinia, Italy.\n\nJessica’s trajectory to space launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome aboard a Soyuz spacecraft, together with Soyuz Commander Oleg Skripochka of the Russian space agency Roscosmos and the first astronaut from the United Arab Emirates, Hazza Ali AlMansoori, Jessica served as flight engineer on the International Space Station for Expeditions 61 and 62 (Sept"
