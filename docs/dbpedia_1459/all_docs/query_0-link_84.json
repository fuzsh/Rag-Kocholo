First, this volume considered how to define American women. The women selected for inclusion represent a cross section of American women in terms of race, class, ethnicity, age, and regional background. As a group they reflect the reality of a multicultural American society as well as the contributions made by all women in shaping America’s history. This volume illustrates that women have been activists and leaders at all ages and time periods. The reality of women’s activism and leadership is found in the variety of their differing stories and backgrounds. Second, this volume considered how to define activists and leaders. The women selected for this work represent a broad spectrum of approaches to activism and leadership. An examination of social change movements reveals that activists employ a number of varied strategies and tactics. Among the most prominent are education, legal change, nonviolent direct action, the vote, and self-help efforts. Some activists focused their efforts on a single strategy, but many combined several strategies at the same time, employed different tactics over a lifetime, or employed different tactics as situations changed. Many groups sought to educate both themselves and members outside their group. Women have\n\nbeen involved in educating the public through speaking, writing, and teaching. During the 1800s, few occupations other than teaching were open to women. Many 19th-century activists worked as teachers before becoming full-time social activists. They were the vanguard who changed educational systems and started autonomous schooling when formal institutions were reluctant to change. This volume includes activists who worked as educators and who addressed the general public to create change in educational institutions. American women have also employed legal strategies to create change. Changing the status quo often requires legal challenges. Women’s legal activities have included pressing cases through the courts and lobbying for legislative changes. This volume includes activists and leaders who worked to create legal and legislative changes from inside or outside formal systems. Another core strategy in creating social change is the use of nonviolent direct action. Nonviolent direct action includes boycotts, arrests, mass marches, and sit-ins, strategies that are often used when legal changes have been created but not enforced. This volume includes activists and leaders who engaged in direct action strategies. The right to vote is considered a primary tenet of democracy. Yet, the United States Constitution originally excluded all citizens except propertied white males from exercising this privilege. Many\n\nS\n\nvii\n\nA TO Z OF AMERICAN WOMEN LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS\n\ngroups struggled for the right to vote, and lives were sometimes lost in these endeavors. This volume includes activists and leaders who worked to extend suffrage to all American adults. Various social groups employed self-help efforts. Through persistent and earnest efforts, women organized their own newspapers, clinics, colleges, churches, and social service organizations. Battered women’s shelters and rape crisis centers exist today due to the efforts of community activists and leaders. Today, some may assume that these organizations have always existed, but many women struggled to make such institutions a part of the American fabric. This volume includes activists and leaders who initiated change through self-help efforts. Many people were instrumental in supporting this project. First, I must thank the best literary agent a girl could have, Elizabeth Frost-Knappman. She encouraged me to undertake this project and remained a cheerful adviser who lent much-needed encouragement and advice. I am indebted to her generous spirit. My friend Marge Freking assumed the painstaking task of proofreading the manuscript and went beyond the call of duty in her efforts. I am indebted to her dedication. Only a true friend would take on such an onerous task. My editor at Facts On File, Nicole Bowen, offered much-needed criticism and guidance, which resulted in a better manuscript. Victoria Harlow researched photographs. Her visual selections strengthened the impact of the text. Our department administrative assistant, Cindy Veldhuisen, gave support in compil-\n\nviii\n\ning two computer-generated lists, and graduate student Sharon Van Natta performed the tedious task of copying needed references. I was assisted by independent researchers Adrienne Baker, Laura Fulton, Michelle Grace, Lydia Graecyn, Alana Kohmann, and Maureen McDowel. Most important, I thank my family. My sons, Dimitri and Alexi; grandfather, Cornell Langston; brother, Tony Langston; uncle, David Langston; and father, Donald Langston, provided me with emotional substance and living examples of the way I hope all men will be in the future. The inspiration for this book came from the women in my family. They served as role models of unparalleled strength and human possibility. I remain impressed by the wit and warmth of my mother, Verna Allen Langston Simonian; my grandmother, Christine Redman Hightower Langston; my aunt, Venita Langston Norman; my aunt, Hazel Allen Ayers; my sisters, Julie Langston Armstrong and Jill Langston Brown; and my nieces, Misty, Darcy, Calie, Katie, Jamie, and Jenny. Finally, I dedicate this work to my mother. Her survival as a woman who dealt successfully with teen pregnancy, poverty, and underpaid work allowed me to pursue dreams that had been unattainable for her. Her exceptional intelligence and remarkable perseverance inspired me to always do my best. After a lifetime of hard work she died of ovarian cancer at age 59. She remains the most extraordinary “ordinary” woman I have ever known.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nhe very definition of leaders and activists often favors public acts and figures over private ones. However, most women are “ordinary” women who lead extraordinary lives, whose contributions never gain public acknowledgment. A common dilemma in traditional accounts of prominent women is the bias that favors women privileged by their race and class. Privileged women often receive more resources and opportunities than other women. Suffragist Alice Paul, for example, never had to work for wages. Hull House founder Jane Addams used part of her inheritance to start the settlement house. Republican governor Christine Todd Whitman and Senator Nancy Kassebaum were born into wealthy, politically influential families. Privileged women are often among the public “firsts,” the first elected to political office and the first admitted to universities and professions. In attempting to provide an accurate representation of the past, there is an apparent shortage of written materials by or about women who lack race or class privilege. However, many women from humble beginnings manage to achieve monumental results despite the odds against them. Cherokee chief Wilma Mankiller rose from a childhood of rural poverty in Oklahoma and urban poverty in California to become chief of the largest American Indian nation in the United States. Former slave Bridget Mason became one of Los Angeles’s first millionaires and used her for-\n\ntune for philanthropic purposes. The parents of Senator Margaret Chase Smith worked as a waitress and a barber. The parents of Congresswoman Barbara Jordan worked as a truck driver and a clerk in segregated Texas. Congresswoman Barbara Mikulski’s parents ran a bakery. Representative Geraldine Ferraro, raised by her widowed mother, became the first female vice-presidential candidate on a major party ticket in 1984. Labor and civil rights movements often afford some leadership opportunities for nonprivileged female participants, though usually not at the top ranks. Rosa Parks sparked the modern civil rights movement by her refusal to move to segregated seating on a city bus. During the 1964 Democratic Party national convention, the head of the Mississippi Freedom Party, Fannie Lou Hamer, galvanized the nation with her testimony on voting rights in the South. Her leadership contributed to the end of all-white primaries and delegations. Fishing rights activist Janet McCloud used direct action protests that eventually led to a court decision supporting the treaty rights of Northwest tribes. Many women who became leaders never married or had children, including Jane Addams, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton, Dorothea Dix, Jeannette Rankin, and Dixy Lee Ray. Some women did not find their true vocation until after their children were raised. Abolitionist and women’s rights activists Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Angelina\n\nT\n\nix\n\nA TO Z OF AMERICAN WOMEN LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS\n\nGrimké both had their work interrupted by childrearing. Ella Baker took a few years off from her work as an organizer in the civil rights movement to raise her niece. The time-intensive demands of child-rearing are often in conflict with the timeintensive demands of leadership. Many women’s rights advocates led emotional lives that centered on other women. Many suffragists, such as Susan B. Anthony and Anna Howard Shaw, and settlement-movement leaders, such as Jane Addams, led lives in which their significant partners in professional or private life were other females. Traditional historical accounts have often ignored sexual identities outside the heterosexual world, yet historians have found evidence of romantic friendships or lifelong companionship in the lives of Jane Addams, Judi Bari, Rachel Carson, Dorothea Dix, Helen Keller, Alice Paul, and Eleanor Roosevelt. In more recent decades, some women, such as Joan Baez and Kate Millett, have publicly claimed a bisexual identity or a lesbian identity, as Urvashi Vaid has. In the United States, radical political identities have also often been downplayed or ignored. Although the names of a few politically radical women, such as Emma Goldman, “Mother” Mary Harris Jones, Lucy Parsons, Elizabeth Gurley Flynn, Emma Tenayuca, and Angela Davis, are prominent in American history, the radical identities of other popular public figures, such as Helen Keller, Frances Willard, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Florence Kelley, and Margaret Sanger, who were all socialists, seldom appear in traditional historical accounts. Also often overlooked is the racially mixed identity of some American women leaders. Ignoring the racially mixed identity of American leaders supports the myth that the United States is racially “pure.” Activists with racially mixed identities include Ada Deer, Frances Harper, Winona LaDuke, Wilma Mankiller, Bridget Mason, Janet McCloud, Pauli Murray, Lucy Parsons, Linda Chavez, and Josephine Ruffin. The lives of the women in this volume resonate with the experiences of many. It is empowering to learn that others have struggled and failed, somex\n\ntimes failing several times before achieving their goals, or that their goals changed as they strove to achieve them. For example, Clara Barton lost several jobs because of the sexism she encountered before she established the American Red Cross while she was in her 50s. Although some women acquired leadership positions late in their lives, Others, such as civil rights activist Ruby Doris Smith Robinson, Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare Oveta Culp Hobby, Planned Parenthood president Faye Wattleton, and Roe v. Wade attorney Sarah Weddington, achieved great results from their efforts at an early age. Some women remained activists into old age. Mary Church Terrell participated in a sit-in to desegregate public accommodations in Washington, D.C., when she was in her 80s. Grace Thorpe began organizing against nuclear waste storage on her reservation, funded only with her social security checks. Senator Margaret Chase Smith served until age 74. Former governor Nellie Ross served as director of the United States Mint until age 77. Some women were spurred into activism late in life, while others, such as Ruby Doris Smith Robinson, became activists before they reached adulthood. Several women struggled with visible and notso-visible disabilities. Abolitionist Harriet Tubman suffered from sudden spells of narcolepsy following a head injury she received while enslaved. Wilma Mankiller dealt with kidney disease; Girl Scout founder Juliet Low was deaf; U.S. Surgeon General Antonia Novello underwent multiple surgeries for a congenital colon condition; and environmentalist Judi Bari experienced permanent injuries after her car was bombed. Many women fought periods of severe depression, among them Jane Addams, Joan Baez, Dorothea Dix, Charlotte Perkins Gilman, Kate Millett, Eleanor Roosevelt, and Clara Barton. Some women found that their religious background compelled their activism. Among abolitionist and early women’s rights advocates, Quakers and Unitarians were represented in higher numbers, including Susan B. Anthony, the Grimké sisters, and Lucretia Mott. Quakers and\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nUnitarians traditionally sought gender equality in their practices. A number of civil rights activists found the foundation for their work in AfricanAmerican churches, while some Catholics felt that liberation theology urged them to action. The stories of the women in this volume, their setbacks and triumphs as well as their battles against gender, race, and class injustice, offer inspiring examples to us and to future generations. The following historical overview presents an outline of broad historical movements that underlay and in many cases spurred women to activism and leadership. 1. Pre-Conquest America. Historians argue that for the last 1,300 years Europe has been more uniformly patrilineal and patriarchal than many American Indian cultures. Gender relations varied greatly among the nations in preconquest America. Some American Indian nations were every bit as oppressive to women as were European cultures. However, other American Indian cultures were matrilineal and, some argue, matriarchal. Women held elevated positions, both formally and informally, in the largest of the contemporary American Indian nations, the Cherokee and Navajo. The Beloved Woman of the Cherokee Nation, Nancy Ward, held office on the tribal council. Other nations that have been noted for the high status of women included those of the Iroquois, Hopi, Zuni, Northern Paiute (Numu), Mandan, and the groups of the eastern Pueblo. European emigrants wrote extensively, and most often with disapproval, of the greater freedom women and children enjoyed in some American Indian societies. The 1848 Seneca Falls women’s rights convention sought many of the same rights that some American Indian women already had, including the right to own property, divorce, retain custody of children, relax restrictive clothing, vote, hold political offices, serve in the ministry, practice medicine, and pursue other professions. 2. The Colonial Years: 1607–1775. In European societies, women’s public roles were often limited. In the rapidly growing American colonies, however,\n\nroles were less rigid, and many female emigrants from Europe took advantage of managerial and entrepreneurial opportunities. Women such as First Lady Abigail Adams ran both the family farm and business enterprises during their husbands’ long absences. European emigrant and author Fanny Wright wrote of the freedom women had in America compared to that in Europe. Starting with religious leader Anne Hutchinson, women in America rebelled against the restrictions placed on them by religious orthodoxy and other institutions. 3. The Early Republic: 1775–1825. Female intellectuals were influenced by the egalitarian philosophy of the French Revolution and by their own observations of some American Indian societies, including the Iroquois. The voluminous letters of Abigail Adams recorded the public and private relations that women endured during this time period. Some of the first women’s organizations were formed as charities for poor women and children in an increasingly urban society. 4. The Age of Colonization: 1825–1860. The U.S. government policy of Manifest Destiny (which held that the United States had the right to expand west across the continent to the Pacific Ocean) led to dire consequences in the lives of American Indian women. Disease, massacre, and displacement decimated Indian nations. Some Indian societies were exterminated entirely. Others faced great pressure to assimilate to EuropeanAmerican ways. One of the largest and most “civilized” nations, the Cherokee, was marched by force from their already reduced lands in Georgia to what they were told would be Indian territory forever. Today that Indian territory is the state of Oklahoma. One in four Cherokee died on the Trail of Tears. The annexation of northern Mexico in the Treaty of GuadalupeHildalgo in 1848 also dispossessed many Latinos of their property. European-American families of the time were moving, both westward to more rural settings and into the paid workforce of factories in urban areas. The earliest American factories initially employed young farm girls in New England textile mills. xi\n\nA TO Z OF AMERICAN WOMEN LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS\n\nEmployed women began to organize groups such as the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association to gain better wages and working conditions. These groups articulated clear understandings of gender and class dynamics. They are among the earliest feminist groups in America. Public schooling was expanding at this time. Some female seminaries began to offer secondary schooling to women. One of the first colleges for women was established at Mount Holyoke in Massachusetts. Such women’s colleges were established in increasing numbers because most universities at the time did not admit women. Some religious groups, such as the Quakers and Unitarians, taught and emphasized gender equity. Consequently, many early feminists and abolitionists were Quakers and Unitarians, such as Lucretia Mott, Angelina Grimké, Susan B. Anthony, Jane Addams, and Alice Paul. Members of these denominations were involved in women’s rights causes in larger numbers than their actual proportion in society. African-American women often became involved in feminist causes after first being active in the abolitionist movement. Women such as Sojourner Truth and Harriet Tubman were active in both movements, though they often faced racism in groups dominated by white women and sexism from male abolitionists. 5. The Civil War and Industrial Society: 1860–1890. Women’s public activities often expanded during wartime, when the number of men at the battlefront created labor shortages at home. Women also contributed to military projects during wartime. During the Civil War, women carried the major load of hospital and relief work. Dorothea Dix, who advocated better care for the mentally ill, served in the army as superintendent of female nurses. Clara Barton organized the collection of medical supplies for the Union army and served as a nurse on the battlefield. Schools for nurses opened at the end of the Civil War and professionalized this work, though most schools were racially segregated. A few women, such as abolitionist Harriet Tubxii\n\nman, were involved in military maneuvers and served as scouts and spies. At the end of the Civil War, many women worked for freedmen’s aid societies, which offered assistance and schooling to those who were formerly enslaved. Female abolitionists, among them Sojourner Truth became involved in this work. By the 1870s, campaigns to reform prisons and charitable institutions were coalescing. Women visited institutions, wrote reports, and lectured publicly on these issues. Dorothea Dix published reports, testified before legislative bodies, and campaigned publicly to improve the treatment of the mentally ill in institutions and society. The depression of 1873 and the growth of poverty induced women such as “Mother” Mary Harris Jones to become involved in early labor groups including the Knights of Labor and the coal miners’ union. Leftist Lucy Parsons and socialist Kate Richards O’Hare sought answers to economic inequity in radical left political groups. Other women were drawn to missionary work and moral issues dealing with temperance and prostitution. The Woman’s Christian Temperance Union (WCTU) was formed in 1875. President Frances Willard joined the movement after serving as an administrator of a women’s college. She moved the WCTU toward support of suffrage. The women’s rights movement after the Civil War focused increasingly on suffrage. Early organizing had been achieved through petitions and lectures. Two large-scale suffrage organizations were both founded in 1869: the American Woman Suffrage Association, headed by Lucy Stone, and the National Woman Suffrage Association, headed by Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony. Twenty years later the two organizations merged and began a united battle for suffrage. In the 1870s Paiute activist Sarah Winnemucca lectured nationally on the plight of American Indians. Among the white reformers drawn to her message was Helen Hunt Jackson, who indicted the federal government for its mistreatment of American Indians in her book A Century of Dishonor.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\n6. The Progressive Era: 1890–1920. The idea of settlement houses, which served the poor, began in England but was quickly adapted by women in the United States. Single women with college educations from women’s colleges, such as Vassar and Bryn Mawr, were particularly drawn to this work. Jane Addams established Hull-House, one of the most famous settlement houses in the United States. Many talented women, including children’s bureau director Julia Lathrop, came to live and work at Hull-House. Another resident of HullHouse, Dr. Alice Hamilton, was a pioneer in the field of industrial diseases. Many settlement house workers supported unions. The National Consumers’ League, led by Hull-House veteran Florence Kelley, inspected factories and issued reports on wages and working conditions of the largely female workforce. They boycotted businesses that were particularly problematic in their treatment of workers. Women began to receive appointments to state boards and institutions in recognition of their work experience and expertise. Many women who would become prominent in the New Deal era of the 1930s began their careers in settlement houses, including Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins and First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt. Jane Addams, Emily Greene Balch, and Congresswoman Jeanette Rankin were also prominent in the peace movement that grew with World War I. They organized the Woman’s Peace Party in 1915, hoping to find alternatives to war in international relations. By the 1890s the suffrage movement was headed by Anna Howard Shaw and Carrie Chapman Catt. They sought to bring women’s homemaking skills into the public realm and “clean house” on political corruption. Others sought recognition for women’s work in the home. Traditional female skills used to manage households were professionalized into the home economics movement, headed by chemist Ellen Richards, the first female faculty member at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). She founded the American Home Economics Association in 1908.\n\nAfrican-American women organized the woman’s club movement, which was composed largely of middle-class women working to benefit the African-American community. Segregation existed in the club movement. In 1900 the General Federation of Women’s Clubs refused to seat Josephine Ruffin, who was representing an African-American club. Suffrage clubs were often segregated as well. The Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA), founded in 1890, was the only integrated women’s group. Discrimination in white women’s groups did not deter women of color, however. Journalist Ida WellsBarnett spearheaded an active antilynching campaign and worked on behalf of suffrage. In the 1920s Selena Sloan Butler founded the first AfricanAmerican parent-teacher association (PTA), which later merged with the segregated white groups. 7. 1920s to World War II. In August 1920, shortly after the end of World War I, women won suffrage. Some women were elected to Congress based on their own merits, such as Jeannette Rankin of Montana, who became the first female congressional representative. More often, however, widows of elected officials who died in office assumed the positions vacated by their husbands’ deaths. Senator Margaret Chase Smith and Governor Nellie Tayloe Davis Ross attained office in this way. After women won the vote, the suffrage movement split into two groups. The more moderate branch formed the League of Women Voters to promote political education, and the radical National Woman’s Party, headed by Alice Paul, pushed for passage of an equal rights amendment to the Constitution. The rising acceptance of psychoanalysis and the economic boom of the Roaring Twenties brought a focus on individual issues and new freedom, although women’s romantic friendships were frowned upon. One of the most difficult public policy battles, for birth control, was led by nurse Margaret Sanger. Birth control devices—condoms, for example—could prevent disabling and deadly venereal diseases for which there were no cures at the time, but birth control was considered both xiii\n\nA TO Z OF AMERICAN WOMEN LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS\n\nimmoral and illegal. Abortion had been made illegal in 1873, and approximately 10,000 women died each year in illegal abortions. Many children were orphaned as a result. The Great Depression led to a decrease in marriage and birth rates, since large families were not affordable. Subsequently, support for birth control increased. Gallup polls in the 1930s showed that the majority of Americans—63 percent—favored birth control education and practices. 8. World War II: 1941–1945. During World War II a shortage of males at home meant increased employment opportunities for women. With only brief training, women performed 80 percent of all jobs previously held by men. Federal funding for day care was made available as women’s labor was indispensable to the war effort. While men were fighting the war, women provided support services in the military, building the planes, ships, and weapons used to win the war. The Women’s Army Corps (WAC) and Women Appointed for Voluntary Emergency Service (WAVES) were created in 1942 to enlist women in noncombatant duties. Women were integrated into the armed forces when the Women’s Armed Services Integration Act was passed in 1948. Women of color were able to find employment outside of domestic and agricultural labor. Not all American women were able to enjoy expanded job opportunities however. During World War II one of the most shameful episodes in American history occurred when Japanese-American citizens were incarcerated in camps. 9. 1950s. After the war women were laid off from their jobs en masse so returning male veterans might find employment. This occurred although many women were the sole support of their families. The media supported the idea that women belonged at home after the war ended. Some advancements for women were made during this decade, however. Women were finally admitted to Harvard Medical School and allowed to work as interns in hospitals. Symphony orchestras also began to accept female musicians. Scientist Alfred Kinsey conducted a study which found that one in 10 Americans was homosexual. xiv\n\nThis was a startling statistic, as it made clear that variety in sexual identity was much more common than previously thought. The 1950s were a time of repressive politics symbolized by Senator Joseph McCarthy’s “witch hunt” for people he believed to be homosexuals and communists. More alleged homosexuals were fired from government jobs than were reputed communists. Most homosexuals remained “in the closet” until the gay liberation movement of the late 1960s and 1970s. 10. 1960s. By the 1960s, increasingly reliable methods of birth control, specifically the development of the birth control pill, led to smaller families. Birth control was legalized by a 1965 Supreme Court ruling, although marriage was a prerequisite to get a prescription for birth control. Many churches continued to proselytize against the use of birth control. By the beginning of the 21st century, 97 percent of women of childbearing age use contraceptives, a right that is often taken for granted. Reduced demands in child rearing allowed women to seek employment opportunities. In 1963 former first lady Eleanor Roosevelt chaired President John F. Kennedy’s Commission on the Status of Women. One of the recommendations of that commission resulted in the Equal Pay Act of 1963, mandating that women and men must receive the same wages for doing the same jobs. Because of segregation in the job market, however, most men and women were not employed in the same jobs. Further protection against gender discrimination was enacted in the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which was shepherded through the legislative process by Congresswoman Martha Griffiths. The largest feminist organization in the nation is the National Organization for Women (NOW), founded in 1966. One of the issues concerning feminists at that time was that advanced math and science classes in many public schools were closed to girls. Additionally, many high school shop and cooking classes were segregated by gender. Women were not allowed to wear slacks in schools and many workplaces. Some colleges exercised admission quotas of 5 percent or less for women students, and women had to achieve better scores\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nthan men in order to be accepted into a college. Women’s athletics received only 1 to 2 percent of athletic budgets. Pregnant students or teachers could be expelled from colleges. Married women were routinely denied promotions and credit. One of the first issues that NOW activists addressed was the practice of gender-segregated want ads in newspapers. NOW also lent early support to the plight of airline stewardesses who were fired if they married. Stewardesses were routinely fired at age 32 since at that age they were deemed too old to be attractive to customers. Businesses routinely asserted that they had the right to regulate the appearance of female employees. While liberal organizations like NOW pushed for legal and legislative reforms, the more radical branch of the women’s movement used more militant direct action. Many younger radical feminists, or women’s liberationists, as they were called, had been influenced by the African-American civil rights movement. The leadership of Ella Baker, adviser of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), led to the adoption of more democratic processes in civil rights, student, and women’s groups. Unlike the large national and hierarchical structure of NOW, radical feminists operated from small collectives like the symbolic WITCH group. (The acronym stood for Women’s International Terrorist Conspiracy from Hell, and they participated in such ad hoc actions as the hexing of Wall Street.) Radical feminists raised public awareness of issues that had traditionally been considered private, such as battering, sexual assault, incest, and the effects of pornography on society. Many women liberationists were involved in starting the first sexual assault crisis centers and battered women’s shelters. 11. 1970s. By the early 1970s lesbian feminists began to challenge the homophobia they confronted in women’s groups. NOW president Betty Friedan urged lesbians to stay in the closet so that they would not damage the movement, but they were increasingly unwilling to do so and found support among heterosexual allies. Although socialist feminism was never as influential in the United States as in Europe, Latin\n\nAmerica, and other regions in the world, by the late 1970s several groups and publications advocated that class differences among women should be recognized. Leftist activist Angela Davis was one national figure in this movement. Socialist feminists supported welfare rights and unionization efforts among women workers. Many activists lent their energies to economic issues such as comparable worth. 12. 1980s to Present. While middle-class settlement workers had gone into poor immigrant communities in their work, in the 1980s and 1990s many women returned to their own communities to create social change. Women of color had been involved in feminist groups from the beginning. NOW was originally the idea of civil rights attorney Pauli Murray, who proposed that an organization similar to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) was needed for women. In the early 1970s, many women of color had formed groups separate from white feminists as they felt their concerns were not fully supported in mainstream groups. The 1983 publication of This Bridge Called My Back, an anthology of writings by women of color, edited by Cherríe Moraga and Gloria Anzaldúa, vocalized many of their concerns During this time, Wilma Mankiller returned to work in the Cherokee Nation, Winona LaDuke returned to the White Earth Reservation to start a land recovery project, vice president of the United Farm Workers (UFW) Dolores Huerta continued to lead the farmworkers movement, and Linda Chavez-Thompson became vice president of the largest labor organization in the country, the AFL-CIO. A great deal of change has occurred as a result of the activism and leadership offered by American women from all walks of life. Women gained the right to attend colleges, to practice in professions, to vote, and to use birth control. Women activists broke the silence concerning violence against women and children. They established institutions now taken for granted, such as shelters for battered xv\n\nA TO Z OF AMERICAN WOMEN LEADERS AND ACTIVISTS\n\nwomen shelters and sexual-assault crisis centers. Women athletes have excelled in a broad range of sports at all levels including the Olympics. Women who engaged in various forms of activism and who led groups and movements in every generation created enormous social change, though it often fell short of their vision of what they hoped to accomplish.\n\nxvi\n\nAt the beginning of the 21st century, women are blessed with the broadest range of choices ever, thanks to the work of women throughout U.S. history. It is necessary to remain mindful of their sacrifices and pioneering spirit as women today travel in their footsteps on a path many hope will lead to a more just world for future generations—both daughters and sons.\n\nA\n\nABZUG, BELLA SAVITSKY\n\nShe defended unions, civil rights clients, and those prosecuted by McCarthyism, a “witch hunt” of leftists and others during the 1950s led by Senator Joseph McCarthy. In 1961, Abzug was a founder of Women’s Strike for Peace and served as its executive director from 1961 to 1970. When she was 50, in 1970, Abzug was elected to Congress from New York City’s 19th District. She was one of only nine women in the House of Representatives and the only Jewish woman. Abzug served three terms in Congress, starting in 1971. On her first day in Congress she made a resolution calling for the immediate withdrawal of troops from Vietnam. Abzug was also the first person to call for President Nixon’s impeachment and was a founder of the Congressional Caucus on women’s issues. In the 92nd Congress, along with Representative MARTHA GRIFFITHS of Michigan, Abzug introduced 20 bills pertaining to women, on such issues as abortion rights, social security, credit for women, extension of the minimum wage to domestic workers, and more comprehensive child care. Abzug authored the first law banning the discrimination women then faced in obtaining credit.\n\n(1920–1998) Congressional Representative, Women’s Rights Leader\n\nBella Abzug was the first woman elected to the House of Representatives on a women’s rights platform. Her campaign slogan was “This woman’s place is in the House—the House of Representatives.” Bella Savitsky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920, the year women gained suffrage, to Emanuel and Esther Savitsky. Her father was a Russian-Jewish immigrant butcher who died when Abzug was 13. After her father’s death, Abzug recited Kaddish in the synagogue every day for a year, a Jewish prayer ritual traditionally performed only by males. She was elected student body president at Hunter College and completed her bachelor of arts degree in 1942. She married stockbroker Martin Abzug in 1944 and had two daughters. Abzug’s application to Harvard Law School was rejected due to the school’s male-only policy at that time. She became one of six women admitted to Columbia University’s School of Law in a class of 120. Abzug graduated from law school in 1947 after serving as editor of the Columbia Law Review. 1\n\nABZUG, BELLA SAVITSKY\n\nMember of Congress Bella Abzug in one of her trademark hats (Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress,Washington, D.C.)\n\nunclassified government documents). In 1971 she was unable to secure passage of the first gay rights bill. Her colleagues named her one of the three most influential members of Congress in a 1976 U.S. News and World Report poll. A 1977 Gallup poll rated her as one of the 20 most influential women in the world. Abzug’s diary-type account of her first two years in Congress, Bella! Ms. Abzug Goes to Washington, was published in 1972. In 1976, Abzug ran for the U.S. Senate but lost the New York State Democratic primary to Patrick Moynihan by only one percentage point. Abzug also ran for mayor of New York City in 1977, but lost to Ed Koch. She was the first woman candidate for both positions. Her last national position was as cochair of President Jimmy Carter’s National Advisory Council on Women. In 1984, with her congressional aide Mim Kelber, Abzug coauthored Gender Gap: Bella Abzug’s Guide to Political Power for American Women. Her husband died two years later, in 1986. Her last book, Women Looking Beyond 2000, published in 1995, examined how closely women in the developing world were tied to environmental issues. Abzug used a wheelchair for mobility during her last few years, and died at age 77 on March 31, 1998, following heart surgery. Gloria Steinem said of Abzug, “In a just country, she would have been president.” Further Reading\n\nWhile in Congress she worked on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was never enacted. In 1971, with representatives SHIRLEY CHISHOLM and PATSY MINK and women’s rights activists BETTY FRIEDAN and GLORIA STEINEM, she founded the National Women’s Political Caucus with the goal of getting more women into public office. In 1977, Abzug and Mink were successful in gaining funds for the first and thus far only federally funded national women’s conference. Held in Houston, Texas, the conference drew 15,000 participants. In 1970 Abzug authored the Freedom of Information Act (which allowed citizens access to 2\n\nAbzug, Bella, with Mim Kelber. Gender Gap: Bella Abzug’s Guide to Political Power for Women.

Abigail Smith was born on November 11, 1744, in Weymouth, Massachusetts, a coastal town south of Boston. She was the second child of Elizabeth Quincy Smith and Congregational minister Reverend William Smith. Her mother was descended from notable Puritan clerics. Her father was a large landholder and political leader. Like most girls of her time, Adams was educated at home. Most New England schools admitted only boys; girls were taught within the family household. Generally, girls were taught only enough reading so they could read their Bibles and write letters. They also learned basic arithmetic to be able to help balance their family budgets. Adams read much more than the Bible in her family’s library and she took an avid interest in political events. When she was 14 she met John Adams, a former schoolteacher and Harvard graduate. They were married on October 25, 1764, and John Adams began a career in law. The couple lived on his small farm at Braintree, Massachusetts. His practice soon expanded to Boston. Adams had six children in seven years, three sons and two daughters; a sixth child was stillborn. Early in their marriage, her husband traveled as a circuit judge; later he moved into politics. She wrote him daily letters that detailed life in the colonies as the American Revolution loomed, struggles with wartime shortages, and inflation. Adams bought land, managed the family farm and its tenants and employees, raised her children, and served as “deputy husband.” Even when living abroad, she made the decisions regarding the farm and dairies. Her skillful management allowed the family to become modestly prosperous. During the Revolutionary War she became a merchant by selling items her husband sent her as gifts. From\n\nthis modest start, Adams expanded her business by importing and retailing tea, china, handkerchiefs, ribbons, and fabrics. She made purchases in her husband’s name, since married women could not own property. Because she raised her children alone, due to her husband’s long periods of absence, she sometimes referred to herself as a “nun” or a “widow.” In 1784, she joined her husband at his diplomatic post in Paris. The following year, she accompanied him to Great Britain in his role as the first U.S. minister to that country. They returned to Massachusetts in 1788 and John served under President George Washington as the first vice president of the nation. In 1796, Adams was elected the second president of the United States.\n\nFirst Lady Abigail Adams, from an original painting by Gilbert Stuart, circa 1830 (Prints and Photographs Division, Library of Congress,Washington, D.C.)\n\n3\n\nADAMS, ABIGAIL SMITH\n\nAdams pursued an active self-education throughout her lifetime. She read numerous newspapers, a broad range of literature, and a little French, and attended lectures on science at the Royal Academy while she was in England. Adams often regretted her lack of formal education. She believed women were the intellectual equals of men and should have equal rights to education. As she stated to her husband, “It is really mortifying Sir, when a woman possessed of a common share of understanding considers the difference of Education between the male and female Sex, even in those families where Education is attended too.” She was one of the most well-read women in America, and the thousands of letters she wrote recorded the details of life during times of revolution and reflected the history of the young country. She was an influential adviser to her husband and son and held many progressive ideas. As a believer in equal education for men and women, she made certain that her own daughter received a good education. The rhetoric of liberty and freedom influenced her ideas regarding slavery, which she opposed, and she defended her right to teach a black servant to read. As Adams stated, “I have sometimes been ready to think that the passion for Liberty cannot be Eaquelly Strong in the Breasts of those who have been accustomed to deprive their fellow Creature of theirs.” One of the most famous passages from her letters was written to her husband in 1776, regarding the formation of the U.S. Congress. She told him: “Remember the ladies, and be more generous and favorable to them than your ancestors. Do not put such unlimited power into the hands of the husbands—If particular care and attention is not paid to the ladies, we are determined to foment a rebellion, and will not hold ourselves bound by any laws in which we have no voice or representation.” Like the early feminist theorist Mary Wollstonecraft, Adams applied the ideals of late-18thcentury democratic revolutions to the status of women. Suffrage leader ELIZABETH CADY STANTON later called Adams “the first American woman 4\n\nwho threatened rebellion unless the rights of her sex were secured.” The Adams family retired to Quincy, Massachusetts, in 1801 after John was defeated in his reelection bid by Thomas Jefferson. Their daughter Abigail had a mastectomy in 1811 and died two years later in 1813. Abigail Adams died October 28, 1818, at age 74. Her son John Quincy Adams became president less than a decade after her death. In 1840, her grandson Charles Francis Adams edited two small volumes of the Letters of Mrs. Adams and her literary contribution in capturing the nation’s history became clear. The edition went through four printings in the 1840s alone. Charles Adams also published The Familiar Letters of John Adams and His Wife in 1876. Her letters offered a glimpse into the life of a president’s family and the personal side of the American Revolution. Letters were one of the few respectable outlets for women’s writing at the time since they were expected to be read privately, and women writing for publication were still frowned upon. (They were also an efficient way to communicate; by the 17th century the postal system had been developed to the point that letters could be delivered within the same city on the day they had been written.) In 1952, the family donated Abigail Adams’s letters to the Massachusetts Historical Society. Harvard University Press currently publishes her letters in six volumes. Adams declined the suggestion to have her letters published during her lifetime, perhaps out of a desire to maintain her privacy, but they remain one of the best accounts of an American woman’s life in the revolutionary period.

Laura Jane Addams was born on September 6, 1860, in rural Cedarville, Illinois, the youngest of five children. Her parents, Sarah Weber Addams and John Huy Addams, were Quakers. Her mother died in childbirth when Jane was two. Her father, an abolitionist and state senator for eight terms, remarried five years later. Young Jane was a good student and wished to pursue a college education at Smith College, recently opened in Northampton, Massachusetts. Her ambition was unusual; at that time the general opinion held that higher education for women was unnecessary and even dangerous. Harvard Medical School professors published books claiming to prove that higher education damaged women’s reproductive systems. Though her father supported the concept of women’s education, he would not allow her to attend Smith, which he considered too distant; he wanted her closer to home. In 1877, Adams enrolled in the Rockford Female Seminary in Illinois from which she graduated as valedictorian. The summer following her graduation, her father died suddenly from appendicitis. Addams inherited part of his considerable fortune. In the fall she enrolled in the Woman’s Medical College\n\nJane Addams as a young woman (University of Illinois at Chicago, the University Library, Jane Addams Memorial Collection)\n\nof Pennsylvania, but she had to quit medical school after one semester, as she required a spinal operation. She struggled with depression for several years. During this time she traveled abroad. While in England in 1887, she visited a settlement house called Toynbee Hall. That visit set her life on a different path. The settlement movement had started in 1884 in England and represented an entirely new method of bringing middle-class charity to the poor. Toynbee Hall was the first settlement house where volunteers with university backgrounds lived with the poor rather than just working in poor neighborhoods during the day and returning to their middle-class neighborhoods in the evening. Previous organized charities had stressed moral virtue as the cure for poverty. However, settlement house workers labored for social change, believing that people were poor not due to 5\n\nADDAMS, LAURA JANE\n\npersonal defects but because of social dynamics. Between 1890 and 1910, about 400 settlement houses were founded. Hull-House was among the first in the United States. In 1889, Addams used her inheritance to found Hull-House in Chicago with her college companion, Ellen Gates Starr, to serve the poor, largely immigrant urban population. (Addams never married, but in 1890, at age 30, she met Mary Rozet Smith, a benefactor of Hull-House, who became her lifelong companion.) Volunteers resided at Hull-House and did their own laundry, cooking, and cleaning. In the first year of operation, HullHouse volunteers served nearly 50,000 neighborhood residents. Addams wrote, “The relationship of the settlement to its neighborhood resembles that of the big brother whose mere presence on the playground protects the little ones from bullies.” Female settlement workers in the United States had a longterm influence on the development of social work and the development of the welfare state, although Addams always remained somewhat critical of the social work profession, because it “spoke of ‘clients’ rather than of ‘neighbors in need.’” One of Hull-House’s first projects was a day care center. Parents normally worked 12- to 16-hour days, leaving their children unsupervised, and settlement workers wanted to help members of the neighborhood with, as Addams recalled, “the humblest neighborhood services. We were asked to wash the newborn babies, to prepare the dead for burial, to nurse the sick, and to mind the children.” HullHouse offered vocational training, citizenship and literacy classes, child and medical care, a meeting place for labor unions and cultural groups, music and art classes, an art gallery, and leisure activities. Hull-House volunteers helped pass legislation to improve the conditions of workers, especially women and children, including the first state protective legislation for women and children, compulsory education laws, and in 1903, state child labor laws, so strong that they would not be matched by federal legislation until 1916. They also reformed the juvenile justice system, establishing the first juvenile court in the nation. 6\n\nAddams hired only union labor for all HullHouse construction projects. Some wealthy Chicago residents thought she was a socialist. Although some later critics have critiqued HullHouse for its commitment to the assimilation of immigrants into American culture, Addams stated repeatedly that the diverse community surrounding Hull-House provided a model for respecting cultural differences, given the range of ethnicities, and further believed, “Internationalism engendered in the immigrant quarters of American cities might be recognized as an effective instrument in the cause of peace.” Addams became the vice president of the National Woman’s Trade Union League in 1903 and was a founder and an executive committee member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). She joined the National American Woman Suffrage Association in 1906, serving as its vice president from 1911 to 1914. In 1910, she became the first woman granted an honorary doctorate from Yale University. Jane Addams’s reputation as a writer made her the country’s best-known settlement worker and Hull-House the country’s most famous settlement house. She wrote more than 450 articles and 12 books, including the best-seller Twenty Years at Hull-House, published in 1910. Addams had all her books printed only in union shops. In 1915, she was elected chair of the Woman’s Peace Party and served as the first president of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom from 1919 to 1929. She was one of the founders of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1920. Addams’s popularity declined during the Red Scare, a wave of hysterical fear of communism that swept the United States after the 1917 Russian Revolution. The Red Scare led to the Palmer Raids of 1919–21, during which thousands of innocent people were arrested as radicals. Addams defended those arrested. The Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) of which Addams was a member, denounced her as procommunist, and later expelled her. Her advocacy of labor unions and her\n\nALBRIGHT, MADELEINE KORBEL\n\npacifist values also caused her to lose some supporters. In particular, her pacifist stance during World War I was widely criticized. By 1919 her name appeared on a “traitor list” presented to the Senate Judiciary Committee. In 1931, Addams became the first American woman awarded the Nobel Peace Prize and remains the only social worker to receive such recognition. She donated the prize money to the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom. Addams died of colon cancer in a Chicago hospital four years later at age 74, on May 21, 1935, and was buried in Cedarville, Illinois. Her funeral, held at HullHouse, was attended by thousands. As she had requested, her work for the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, as well as for HullHouse, were listed on her tombstone. Hull-House continued to operate into the 1960s.

Madeleine Korbel was born on May 15, 1937, in Prague, Czechoslovakia. Her father, Josef Korbel,\n\nwas from Moravia, which is now part of the Czech Republic. His family moved to Prague in 1928, and he married his high school sweetheart, Mandula Spieglova. Madeleine was the first of their three children. When she was an infant, her family moved to Belgrade, Yugoslavia. Her family was forced to flee their home twice. First, when Madeleine was two, they went to London to escape the Nazis. After the war the family returned to Czechoslovakia and in 1947, Madeleine was sent to boarding school in Switzerland, where she learned to speak French. But the Korbels fled Czechoslovakia again in 1948, this time driven out by Stalinism. Her father, a Czechoslovakian diplomat, was able to bring his family to America when Madeleine was 11 years old. They settled temporarily in New York City, then moved to Colorado, where Josef Korbel taught international relations at the University of Denver. She completed high school in 1955 and received a scholarship to attend Wellesley College in Massachusetts, where she studied politics and journalism. She graduated with honors in 1959 with a degree in political science. During a summer job at the Denver Post, she met her future husband, Joseph Albright, whose family owned a number of newspapers, including the Denver Post. Three days after graduation they married and moved to Chicago, where her husband worked as a reporter for the Sun-Times. An editor at the SunTimes told Albright that he would not hire her because her husband worked there. No other local newspaper would hire her either, so for a time she worked for the Encyclopedia Britannica. The family moved to Long Island, New York, in 1961 when her husband went to work for Newsday. Albright gave birth that year to twin daughters; a third daughter was born six years later. Albright enrolled in the graduate program in public law and government at Columbia University, earning a master’s degree and a certificate in Russian studies in 1968. The family then moved to Washington, D.C., where her husband was transferred. During this time she studied international relations at Johns Hopkins University. In 1976, 7\n\nANTHONY, SUSAN BROWNELL\n\nAlbright became the chief legislative assistant for Democratic Senator Edmund Muskie. Also in 1976, Albright earned her Ph.D. at Columbia University’s Department of Public Law and Government. Her doctoral dissertation focused on the role of the press in the 1968 reform movement in Czechoslovakia. Albright served on President Jimmy Carter’s National Security Council from 1978 to 1981 through the mentorship of one of her Columbia professors, Zbigniew Brzezinski. The next year, after 23 years of marriage, Albright’s husband left her for a younger woman. After leaving government, Albright wrote Poland: The Role of the Press in Political Change (1983), which won an award from the Smithsonian Institution’s Woodrow Wilson Center for Scholars. She taught at Georgetown University from 1982 to 1993 and served as director of the Women in Foreign Service program. Albright took pride in winning Best Teacher awards four years in a row while at Georgetown. In 1992, under President Bill Clinton, Albright served as ambassador to the United Nations and as a member of Clinton’s National Security Council. She was the second woman to hold the position at the United Nations. (The first was JEANE KIRKPATRICK, appointed by President Ronald Reagan in 1981.) In 1996, the Senate unanimously confirmed Albright’s historic nomination for secretary of state. Shortly after her confirmation, a Czech cousin revealed to the press that Albright’s family were not Catholics, as Albright believed, but Jews, and that three of her grandparents had died in concentration camps. A Washington Post reporter found the evidence in documents that had just recently been made available by the Czech Republic. Some suspected that Albright had kept her family history a secret, but Albright said that her parents had practiced “historical amnesia” with the hope of protecting their children from anti-Semitism. In January 1997, when she took office as secretary of state, Albright became the highest-ranking woman in the history of the federal government, 8\n\nand the third-highest-ranking official in the Clinton administration. Albright served as secretary of state during a period of rebuilding in post–cold war Europe. She negotiated the expansion of NATO and peace accords in Bosnia and the Middle East. She resigned with the election of President George W. Bush in 2000. As of 2001 Albright remained the only woman to be secretary of state, and she was the last to serve in this position at the close of the 20th century. Further Reading Albright, Madeleine.

Born on February 15, 1820, in Adams, Massachusetts, to Quakers Lucy Read Anthony and Daniel Anthony, Susan B. Anthony was the second of seven children. Because of the economic\n\nANTHONY, SUSAN BROWNELL\n\nSusan B. Anthony, 19th-century suffragist (Still Picture Branch, National Archives, College Park, MD)\n\ndepression of 1837, her family was forced to declare bankruptcy. They moved to Rochester, New York, where their home became a meeting place for antislavery activists, who included their neighbor, the great African-American antislavery orator Frederick Douglass. Quakers were against slavery and believed in equality between men and women. When a male schoolteacher refused to teach Anthony long division, a subject he viewed as only fitting for boys, her father started a home school and employed a female teacher. Anthony completed her formal education at a Quaker seminary for women in Philadelphia.\n\nTeaching was one of the few professions open to women at that time. Anthony became a teacher in 1839 and helped support her family with her wages, which were one-fifth of what her male colleagues made. At a state teacher’s convention she offered resolutions against racial segregation in schools, which read in part: “Resolved: That the exclusion of colored youth from our public schools, academies, colleges, and universities is the result of wicked prejudice.” In 1846, she became headmistress of Canajoharie Academy in Rochester, New York. However, Anthony protested the inequity in her wages as a woman and resigned after three years. 9\n\nANTHONY, SUSAN BROWNELL\n\nAnthony joined the Daughters of Temperance in 1848, and in 1852 she founded the Woman’s New York State Temperance Society. The leaders of the temperance movement, which advocated against the use of alcohol, were concerned mainly with the abuses women and children suffered at the hands of alcoholic males. But Anthony encountered sexism even in the temperance movement and was refused permission to speak or even be seated at conventions. When she attended a state convention of the Sons of Temperance in 1852, she was told that, as a woman, she should listen and not speak. Shortly thereafter, Anthony attended her first women’s rights convention. She became a representative for the American AntiSlavery Society in New York in 1856. Rioters burned her effigy and chased after her during her antislavery speaking engagements. Anthony met women’s rights leader ELIZABETH CADY STANTON in 1851 when she traveled to Syracuse, New York, for an antislavery convention. The two became prominent women’s rights advocates and formed a 50-year friendship. When she first met Stanton, Anthony was a 31-year-old retired teacher. Because Anthony and Stanton were criticized for talking too much about women’s rights, they resigned from the Woman’s New York State Temperance Society. By 1854, Anthony had circulated petitions for married women’s property rights and women’s suffrage and begun a New York State campaign for women’s suffrage. At a New York State Teachers Convention in 1857, Anthony called for the education of women and African Americans. An expanded Women’s Property Act that allowed women to control their own wages, children, and inheritance, was passed in 1860, but suffrage was a more prolonged battle. For a brief period Anthony wore bloomers, a style composed of a skirt that fell slightly below the knees and loose trousers gathered at the ankles. The new design challenged the fashion of tightly laced waists, which constricted women’s bodies. Elizabeth Miller, a cousin of Stanton’s, had designed the dress and named it after Amelia Bloomer, who publicized it in a paper she edited. Women who wore 10\n\nbloomers were accused by the press of advocating an end to marriage and the family because of their masculine attire. Women who sported the modified dress were harassed in public. Anthony stopped wearing the garment and noted, “The attention of my audiences was fixed upon my clothes instead of my words.” In one of their first joint actions, Anthony and Stanton formed the National Woman’s Loyal League in 1861, which demanded the emancipation of all slaves in the United States. In the same year they collected 400,000 signatures on an antislavery petition, the largest number ever collected. After the Civil War, Anthony and Stanton opposed ratification of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, which extended suffrage to black males but excluded women. As Anthony stated, “I would sooner cut off my right hand than ask the ballot for the black man and not for woman.” In her view, “My work will not be done until the power of the ballot is in the hands of all women black and white.” Some historians would later surmise that part of her reaction may have been elitist and racist, since she opposed giving the vote to “illiterate males before educated women.” Debate over the proposed Fifteenth Amendment divided the suffrage movement into two organizations in 1869: the National Woman Suffrage Association (NWSA), led by Anthony and Stanton, and the American Woman Suffrage Association (AWSA) led by Lucy Stone. Anthony was the founder and an officer of the NWSA from 1869 to 1890. Men could become members of, but not hold office in, the NWSA. (Men headed many women’s organizations at this time.) As the radical branch of the women’s rights movement, Stanton and Anthony’s NWSA had a broader agenda than just suffrage, as indicated in its statement of purpose: “The woman question is more than a demand for suffrage—It is a question covering a whole range of women’s needs and demands—including her work, her wages, her property, her education, her physical training, her social status, her political\n\nANTHONY, SUSAN BROWNELL\n\nequalization, her marriage and her divorce.” Divorce was an unpopular issue due to the influence of churches. Anthony voted in the 1872 presidential election in Rochester, New York. She was quoted in the press as saying that the framers of the Constitution said, “We, the people, not we, the white male citizens.” She was arrested for voting and stood trial, but as a woman, was prohibited by law from testifying. The judge wrote his opinion and the allmale jury’s verdict before the trial had even started and fined Anthony $100 for illegal voting, a fine she never paid. During the nation’s centennial Fourth of July celebration at Independence Hall in 1876, Anthony gained access to the event by using a reporter’s pass, and after the Declaration of Independence was read she disrupted the proceedings by reading the Declaration of Rights for Women. Anthony was owner and editor of the women’s rights newspaper the Revolution, published from 1868 to 1870. This short-lived NWSA journal had 3,000 subscribers. Its motto was, “Men, their rights, and nothing more; women, their rights, and nothing less!” The paper investigated employment discrimination, scrutinized divorce law changes, examined the organization of female laundry workers, tailors, and typesetters, and endorsed equal pay for women. Similar to the stance Ms. magazine would take a century later in declining what it saw as unethical advertising, Stanton refused to accept advertising for quack medical cures. During the years that the Revolution was published, Anthony formed the Working Women’s Association (WWA). Anthony served as president for this organization of women in the publishing and garment trades who were excluded from allmale trade unions. The WWA was one of the first unions in the country for women. In response, the men’s typographical union accused her of running a nonunion shop at the Revolution offices and presses. When the paper ceased operations in 1870, Anthony assumed responsibility for $10,000 worth of debts owed by\n\nthe Revolution. She went on the lecture circuit for six years, earning $75 per lecture in order to repay the debt with interest. Anthony organized the first Woman Suffrage Convention in Washington, D.C., after the NWSA and the AWSA, the two branches of the suffrage movement, merged in 1890. Once again she created a unified group, the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Anthony served as vice president (1890–92) and then president (1892–1900) of the NAWSA. In later years the differences between Anthony and Stanton became more apparent. Stanton viewed Anthony’s suffrage-first strategy as conservative compared to her own larger perspective of social reform. But the two worked together to document the history of the women’s rights movement. Anthony, Stanton, and two other women’s rights activists, Matilda Joslin Gage and Ida Harper, edited four volumes from 1882 to 1902. Two more volumes were published after Anthony’s death. The six volumes of the History of Woman Suffrage 1881–1922 were the official records of the NAWSA. In the 1890s, Anthony raised $50,000 for the University of Rochester in exchange for their admitting women for the first time, in 1900. During this same time period, Anthony also worked on her autobiography, Life of Susan Anthony. In 1900, at age 80, Anthony retired as president of NAWSA. At a Baltimore conference in 1906, which celebrated her 86th birthday, she gave one of her most famous speeches regarding suffrage, “Failure is Impossible.” Susan B. Anthony died shortly afterward, in Rochester, New York, on March 13, 1906. Stamps with Anthony’s portrait were issued in 1936 and 1955. In 1979, she became the first woman to appear on U.S. currency when her image appeared on the dollar coin. Anthony appeared before Congress every year from 1869 to 1906 to petition for suffrage. Fourteen years after her death, suffrage for women was attained in the Nineteenth Amendment, passed in 1920—often known as the Susan B. Anthony Amendment. It had taken 144 years for women to gain full citizenship. 11\n\nANTHONY, SUSAN BROWNELL\n\nFurther Reading Banner, Lois. “The Selected Papers of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.

She suspected she was not accepted into the girls’ glee club because of her skin color. She completed high school in Palo Alto and joined the Quakers’ social action wing, the American Friends Service Committee. While still in high school, Baez committed her first act of civil disobedience by not participating in practice air raid drills. Her photo appeared on the local newspaper’s front page. In 1956, she first heard Martin Luther King Jr. speak about civil rights. She also bought her first guitar, and during periods of depression, taught herself how to play music. In 1958, the Baez family moved to Belmont, Massachusetts, when her father accepted a post at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Baez enrolled in Boston University but ended up spending most of her time singing in local coffeehouses. At 18, she was discovered by a talent scout while performing at a Boston coffeehouse in 1959. Baez became well known after her appearance at the Newport Folk Festival in\n\nPeace Advocate, Singer\n\nJoan Baez became the first famous female folksinger and used her name recognition for peace advocacy. Joan Chandos Baez was born on January 9, 1941, in Staten Island, New York, the second of three daughters. Her mother, Joan Bridge, was an immigrant from Edinburgh, Scotland, and her father, Albert Baez, was an immigrant from Puebla, Mexico. Her father grew up in Brooklyn, New York. His father, a Methodist minister, worked with Brooklyn’s Hispanic community. Albert Baez completed a degree in physics at Drew University in Madison, New Jersey, then moved the family to California when he entered a master’s program in mathematics at Stanford University. The family moved back to the East Coast after Joan’s father completed his Ph.D. Hired as a research physicist at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York, her father worked on secret military projects there. Because he and his wife had become Quakers and were opposed to war, he left the university position for a lower-paying career as a college professor at a number of schools. 13\n\nBAEZ, JOAN CHANDOS\n\nFolksinger Joan Baez on National Educational Television folk music special, 1967 (Prints & Photographs Division, Library of Congress,Washington, D.C.)\n\n1959. In 1960, her first album was third on the list of 100 best-selling albums. She was briefly involved romantically with Bob Dylan and admitted to the public that she had had at least one affair with a woman. In 1962, she conducted the first of three concert tours to southern college campuses—playing for integrated audiences only. In 1963, she sang the unofficial civil rights anthem “We Shall Overcome” at the famous civil rights March on Washington. She joined Martin Luther King Jr. on several civil rights marches, including the Selmato-Montgomery march in 1963. Beginning in 1964, Baez refused to pay federal taxes to support U.S. military involvement in the Vietnam War. She withheld 60 percent of her income—the amount of the federal budget that the government devoted to military expenditures—and the Internal Revenue Service responded by placing liens on her house and cars. She continued to with14\n\nhold her taxes for a decade. In 1964, she played at a benefit concert to oppose Proposition Fourteen, which would have allowed segregated housing in California. When she showed up at the Free Speech Movement protest at the University of California, Berkeley, the police waited until she left the occupied building before arresting 800 students. In 1965, she began protesting against the Vietnam War outside the White House. That same year she founded the Institute for the Study of Nonviolence in Carmel, California, which remained there for more than a decade before moving to Santa Cruz, where the name changed to the Resource Center for Nonviolence. In 1966, Baez gave a benefit concert for farmworkers in California. The following year, she was denied permission to perform at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., by the Daughters of the American Revolution because of her antiwar activism. Instead, Baez gave a free concert at the base of the Washington Monument. She also appeared at the Women Strike for Peace benefit. In October of that year, she was among 119 people arrested for blockading the induction center, where young men were drafted for military service in Vietnam, in Oakland, California. For this action, she was sentenced to serve 10 days in jail. Martin Luther King Jr. visited her in jail during her confinement. Two months later, Baez was arrested again with a group of 49 demonstrators at the same induction center. For the second offense, she was given a 90-day sentence. She published her first autobiography, Daybreak, in 1968, and the book became a best-seller. In March 1968, she married David Harris, the leader of an antidraft organization called the Resistance. They had one son and divorced after a few years. Baez remained a strong antiwar, antinuclear, and peace advocate. In 1972, she helped organize an antiwar demonstration for women and children called Ring Around the Congress. She then spent a year on the West Coast establishing Amnesty International, an organization that drew attention to human rights abuses throughout the world. Baez protested the 1973 military coup in\n\nBAKER, ELLA JOSEPHINE\n\nChile whereby the dictatorship of General Augusto Pinochet replaced the democraticaly elected government of Salvador Allende. In 1976, she marched with the Irish Peace People in Northern Ireland. In 1977, she appeared at a protest at Kent State University organized in response to official plans to build a gymnasium over the site where four students protesting the Vietnam War were shot by National Guardsmen in 1970. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Baez remained active in the nuclear freeze movement. In 1978, she gave several benefit concerts in California to defeat Proposition Six, which would have prevented openly gay people from teaching in public schools. Baez founded Humanitas International Human Rights Committee in 1979 and headed the group for more than a decade. In 1987, her second autobiography, And A Voice to Sing With, became a New York Times best-seller. She remains on the board of Amnesty International.

She organized African-American cooperative campaigns in Harlem during the Great Depression; became a leader of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) in the\n\n1940s; served as the first interim director of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) in the 1950s; helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) in 1960; and helped found the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party in 1964. Ella Baker was born in Norfolk, Virginia, on December 13, 1903, to Georgianna Ross Baker and Blake Baker, the children of former slaves. Ella Baker was the second of three children. Her family moved to Littleton, North Carolina, when she was eight, to land her maternal grandparents had purchased from their former master. Her grandfather was pastor at the local church. Her father worked as a waiter on a ferry between Norfolk, Virginia, and Washington, D.C., and her mother had worked as a schoolteacher before having children. Because there was no local secondary school, when Baker was 15 she was sent to the high school academy of Shaw University, Shaw boarding school in Raleigh, North Carolina. After completing high school, she attended college classes at Shaw. Baker graduated from college in 1927 as valedictorian of her class. Although Baker wanted to be a medical missionary or social worker, she could not afford the extended education these professions required. She was also unable to afford graduate work in the sociology department at the University of Chicago, although she had been accepted there. At the start of the Great Depression, Baker moved to New York City, where, despite her college diploma, she initially waitressed and worked in factories. The first political group she joined in Harlem was the Young Negroes Cooperative League, a consumer cooperative. Baker became the group’s first national director in 1931, overseeing a network of buying clubs and cooperative grocery stores. She taught literacy classes for the Workers Education Project, part of the New Deal Works Progress Administration (WPA) programs. As Baker later recalled, “New York was the hotbed of let’s-call-it radical thinking. You had every spectrum of radical thinking on the WPA.” She married longtime friend T. J. Robert in the late 1930s but never used her husband’s 15\n\nBAKER, ELLA JOSEPHINE\n\nname. Baker worked as a reporter and editor for a variety of African-American publications, including the American West Indian News and the Negro National News. A 1935 investigation that she conducted on African-American domestic workers was published in The Crisis, the magazine of the NAACP. She began working for the NAACP in 1938, first as a field secretary, then as its director of branches from 1943 to 1946. As a field secretary, she traveled six months of every year to branches in the South to raise money and membership. Her work was dangerous, because NAACP members in the South risked being beaten or killed by people opposed to its mission. In 1944, she organized a series of regional leadership conferences to help develop local leaders. Baker was critical of what she saw as the NAACP’s topheavy hierarchy and agitated constantly for local empowerment. (The NAACP’s primary focus had been on increasing its membership, and thereby its dues, not on increasing the participation of its members.) She resigned from her paid position in 1946 when she assumed custody of her nine-year-old niece. In 1951, Baker made an unsuccessful bid for a New York City Council seat, running on the Liberal Party ticket. She continued to act as a volunteer for the NAACP and became the first woman president of the New York branch in 1954. In 1956, she cofounded and served as executive secretary of a northern organization, In Friendship, which helped raise funds for the southern civil rights struggle occurring around the Montgomery, Alabama, bus boycott. Baker was centrally involved in integrating New York City schools in 1957. That same year, the SCLC was formed, and Baker moved to Atlanta in January 1958 to serve as its executive secretary and to coordinate its citizenship campaign. One of her first tasks for SCLC in 1958 was to organize meetings throughout the South on Lincoln’s birthday. The purpose of the meetings was to announce SCLC’s plans to increase the number of 16\n\nblack registered voters in the South in one year. Ultimately, Baker would organize more than 65 SCLC branches in the South. Although she organized the entire operation, she was not made a director of SCLC—because she was not a minister and was not a man. As Baker later recalled, “I knew from the beginning that having a woman be an executive of SCLC was not something that would go over with the male-dominated leadership. And then of course, my personality wasn’t right. . . . I was not afraid to disagree with the higher authorities.” She was a critic of the male ministers who led SCLC, including civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Baker criticized both the NAACP and SCLC for their entrenched hierarchy and exclusion of women. She was 54 when she started to work at SCLC and had considerably more experience in organizing on behalf of civil rights than did the ministers for whom she worked. She was especially critical of overreliance on one leader, no matter how charismatic. As Baker perceived it: “In government service and political life I have always felt it was a handicap for oppressed peoples to depend so largely upon a leader, because unfortunately in our culture, the charismatic leader usually becomes a leader because he has found a spot in the public limelight. It usually means he has been touted through the public media, which means that the media made him, and the media may undo him.” A strong proponent of participatory democracy, Baker stated, “You didn’t see me on television, you didn’t see news stories about me. The kind of role that I tried to play was to pick up pieces or put together pieces out of which I hoped organization might come. My theory is, strong people don’t need strong leaders.” When student-led sit-ins began in Greensboro, North Carolina, in February 1960, Baker helped found an independent student organization. (Sitins protested public segregation at restaurants and other establishments.) Baker organized a conference for students in April 1960 at Shaw University that led to the formation of SNCC. The student\n\nBALCH, EMILY GREENE\n\norganization challenged the more moderate and hierarchical SCLC. In 1964, Baker helped found and served as chief adviser to another cutting-edge civil rights group, the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP), which challenged the all-white Mississippi delegation to the Democratic National Convention. (FANNIE LOU HAMER served as vice president of the MFDP.) The grassroots, participatory model, which Baker struggled to achieve in every organization she was involved in, served as a role model to numerous groups outside the civil rights movement, including Students for a Democratic Society and the women’s liberation movement of the 1970s. Ella Baker died in New York on December 18, 1986, at age 83. Her funeral was held in Harlem. Pallbearers included major civil rights leaders such as Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown, Julian Bond, James Forman, and Bayard Rustin. According to Forman, “She has served black people without fanfare, publicity, or concern for personal credit.” During her lifetime, historian Howard Zinn acknowledged Baker as “the most tireless, the most modest, and the wisest activist I know.” Her life was the subject of a 1983 documentary, Fundi: The Ella Baker Story. Her legacy continues, for as Baker stated, “I believe that the struggle is eternal. Somebody else carries on.” Further Reading Baker, Richard. “Ella’s First Year.” Life 21 no. 7 (June 1998): 114–115.

She was born on January 8, 1867, near Boston, Massachusetts, to Ellen Noyes Balch and Francis Vergnies Balch. Her father, a graduate of Harvard University who volunteered to fight in the Civil War, became a successful attorney. Her mother worked as a teacher before her marriage and died when Balch was 17. Balch was the third child in a family of six girls and one boy. She attended private schools and graduated in 1889 from the first class at Bryn Mawr College, a women’s educational institution founded by Quakers. A fellowship from Bryn Mawr allowed her to study economics in Paris for a year and to write Public Assistance of the Poor in France, which was published in 1893. She cofounded the Denison Settlement House in Boston. She then studied at Radcliffe College and the University of Chicago and spent a year at the University of Berlin (1895–96). Balch began teaching social economics at Wellesley College in 1896. In 1906, she publicly declared herself a socialist. In 1910, she authored a classic work in sociology, Our Slavic Fellow Citizens. By 1913, she had been promoted to the rank of full professor and chair of the sociology department. She participated in movements for child labor laws, women’s suffrage, and racial justice issues. She became the first president of the Boston Women’s Trade Union League, and in 1915 she was among 42 women who served as delegates to the International Congress of Women at The Hague. This international gathering of prominent women leaders attempted to prevent World War I by persuading representatives of both the directly involved states and the neutral states to engage in a mediation process. After the congress, she coauthored, with Hull House founder JANE ADDAMS and industrial health pioneer ALICE HAMILTON, a summary of the delegation’s attempts to mediate World War I 17\n\nBARI, JUDITH BEATRICE\n\nentitled Women at The Hague: The International Congress of Women and Its Results (1915). Balch next went to work on the editorial staff of the progressive weekly, The Nation. In 1918, in a response to her pacifist activities during World War I, Balch was dismissed from Wellesley College. At age 52, she lost both her position and her pension. Nevertheless, Balch upheld an outspoken internationalist position when most Americans still maintained an isolationist view. She served as secretary-treasurer of the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom (WILPF) for three years, from 1919 to 1922, and would work for WILPF for the rest of her life. During this period Balch, who was raised as a Unitarian, became a Quaker. Balch advocated withdrawal of U.S. troops from Haiti in 1926 after an 11-year U.S. occupation, and she published her views in 1927 in the book Occupied Haiti. Largely as a result, troops were withdrawn in 1934. Balch, ever active in the WILPF, again served as its secretary-treasurer in 1934. Nazi persecutions of Jews, the disabled, the left, and “racially impure” groups led her to change her strong pacifist views during World War II, for she believed that neutrality in the face of Nazism was “impractical, amoral, and selfish.” She spoke out against U.S. internment of Japanese-American citizens and advocated monetary compensation for their losses. She also lobbied the U.S. government to accept Jewish refugees. Balch was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1946 at age 79. Only two other women had previously received that prize: Jane Addams in 1931 for her work in the settlement housing movement, and Austrian writer Baroness Bertha von Suttner in 1901 for her poetry. Balch donated her 1946 Nobel Peace Prize money to the WILPF. She spent her last four years in a Cambridge nursing home. Emily Greene Balch died just one day after her 94th birthday on January 9, 1961. She had devoted her life to the pursuit of peace. 18\n\nFurther Reading Alonso, Harriet Hyman. “Nobel Peace Laureates.” Journal of Women’s History 7 (summer 1995): 6–26. Balch, Emily Greene.

Environmental\n\nJudi Bari, the leader of the Earth First! movement in northern California, was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on November 7, 1949. Her ItalianAmerican father was a diamond setter; her Jewish mother, a teacher. Bari was the second of three daughters and grew up in a middle-class suburb in Maryland. She entered the University of Maryland in 1967 and protested against the Vietnam War while she was a student there. After leaving school she worked for the U.S. Postal Service in Washington, D.C., where she organized a strike of postal workers and wrote a newsletter about the strike. She moved to Sonoma County, California, with her husband in 1979. While there, she was involved in protests for peace in Central America and remained active in labor issues, including the organization of sawmill workers into an International Workers of the World local. While working as a carpenter, she learned that the wood she used was coming from old-growth redwood trees. Some of those redwood trees were at least 1,000 years old and 97 percent of oldgrowth redwoods had already been cut. The environmentalist group Earth First! used rallies, demonstration blockades, and tree sittings to\n\nBARTON, CLARISSA HARLOWE\n\nprotest the continued cutting. Bari began to get involved by organizing blockades of logging trucks for Earth First! She guided Earth First! to reject tree spiking, a method of protest that involved driving metal spikes into trees to damage logging, a tactic that could cause injuries to workers. She began to build alliances between timber workers and environmentalists. As Bari later recalled, “When I got involved with Earth First! I like"
