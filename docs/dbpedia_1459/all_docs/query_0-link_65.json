        "text": "How plausible is this?\n\nPresidents\n\n1893: 24) Stephen Grover (Grover) Cleveland – died [1]\n\n1893-1901: 25) Harriet Rebecca Lane Johnston [2]\n\n1901-1904: 26) Marcus Alonzo “Mark” Hanna – died [3]\n\n1904-1909: 27) Theodore Roosevelt – killed [4]\n\n1909-1917: 28) Susanna Madora Salter [5]\n\n1917-1920: 29) James Beauchamp “Champ” Clark – died [6]\n\n1920-1925: 30) Thomas Riley Marshall\n\n1925-1933: 31) Charles Curtis [7]\n\n1933-1945: 32) Franklin Delano Roosevelt Sr. – died [8]\n\n1945-1946: 33) James Aloysius “Jim” Farley – killed [9]\n\n1946-1949: 34) Benjamin Oliver Davis, Sr. [10]\n\n1949-1957: 35) Anna Eleanor Roosevelt [11]\n\n1957-1965: 36) Margaret Madeline Chase Smith\n\n1965-1969: 37) Henry Martin “Scoop” Jackson\n\n1969-1977: 38) Edward William “Ed” Brooke III\n\n1977-1981: 39) Cornelia Genevive Gjesdal “Coya” Knutson [12]\n\n1981-1983: 40) Donald Henry Rumsfeld – killed [13]\n\n1983-1993: 41) Jeanne Duane Jordan Kirkpatrick\n\n1993-2001: 42) Ronald Vernie “Ron” Dellums\n\n2001-2009: 43) Olympia Jean Bouchles Snowe [14]\n\n2009-2017: 44) William Blaine “Bill” Richardson [15]\n\n2017à: 45) Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton [16]\n\n[1] Died in a boat accident – a smaller boat crashed into Cleveland’s, on which he was being operated; the ensuing explosion mortally wounded the President and caused the President’s boat to sink, and several aides struggled to lift the dying President onto another nearby vessel.\n\n[2] First female President. Previously served as US First Lady (1857-61), US HoR (1882-3), US Senator (1891-3), and US VP (1893). Was nominated for VP because she was more popular than her husband. Her husband had been coaxed into running for a special US HoR election in 1879 (The POD). When he was appointed to an open US Senate seat in 1882, Harriet was chosen to serve the remaining months of her husband’s HoR term. When her husband was then elected Governor, Harriet served out the rest of her husband’s Senate seat. In 1893, her husband resigned from the governorship to become the first US First Gentleman. Her husband died in 1896, only five days after Harriet won the 1896 Presidential election. Her election over 72-year-old Republican challenger Levi P. Morton was incredibly narrow. VP: William Jennings Bryan.\n\n[3] Ran because his friend McKinley refused to over concern for his wife’s health. Won over VP Bryan. Died from exhaustion and typhoid fever.\n\n[4] Assassinated – was walking alongside Mexican President Porfirio Diaz in the disputed Chamizal strip between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, and was shot in the heart (by a radical farmer via palm pistol) at close range right outside the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route on the day of a summit between the two leaders. He died 1 hour later.\n\n[5] Second female President. After serving as a Prohibition mayor (1887-8), became a Republican and served in US HoR (1891-9), then as Governor (1903-5), then as interim US Senator (1906-7) before becoming TR’s 2nd VP (1909). The 2nd Mexican-American War (1910-1920; a US victory) occurred in her first term, and she finally got Prohibition passed in 1916.\n\n[6] Died from pneumonia in December.\n\n[7] First (and so far, only) Native-American President. VP: Frank O. Lowden.\n\n[8] Died from a cerebral hemorrhage. In order to be on the 1944 ticket, Farley ran for VP from Maryland, where he’d recently bought a house.\n\n[9] Assassinated (simply for being Catholic) by an 83-year-old Protestant who fired five times before being apprehended; three of the bullets hit Farley, one fatally hit the Secretary of State in the forehead, and one missed entirely.\n\n[10] First African-American President, previously served as the US Secretary of War (September 1945-1946). Declined running for a full term.\n\n[11] Nominated in a successful draft effort. VP: Harry Truman.\n\n[12] Narrowly re-elected to US HoR in 1958, divorced abusive husband in 1960 and left US HoR in 1961. After serving in Jackson’s cabinet, elected MN Governor (1971-7). VP: Jimmy Carter.\n\n[13] Accidently shot down by the USSR while on route to Japan for a diplomatic visit. This quickly led to the Nuclear War of 1983 (September-October), in which 4 cities (2 American, 2 Soviet) were nuked and millions of people were killed. Kirkpatrick survived a February 1984 impeachment attempt, just barely won the 1984 nomination, then won in November 1984 by an incredibly narrow margin; the results were contested by her opponent, Gary Hart, but the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that Kirkpatrick was the winner. She narrowly won re-election in 1988.\n\n[14] First Greek-American President. VP: John McCain.\n\n[15] First Hispanic President. Nearly impeached in 2015. VP: Joe Biden.\n\n[16] 8th female US President. Just won the 2016 election. VP: Julian Castro.\n\nPresidents\n\n1901-1904: 26) Marcus Alonzo “Mark” Hanna – died [3]\n\n1904-1909: 27) Theodore Roosevelt – killed [4]\n\n1909-1917: 28) Susanna Madora Salter [5]\n\n[3] Ran because his friend McKinley refused to over concern for his wife’s health. Won over VP Bryan. Died from exhaustion and typhoid fever.\n\n[4] Assassinated – was walking alongside Mexican President Porfirio Diaz in the disputed Chamizal strip between El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, and was shot in the heart (by a radical farmer via palm pistol) at close range right outside the El Paso Chamber of Commerce building along the procession route on the day of a summit between the two leaders. He died 1 hour later.\n\n[5] Second female President. After serving as a Prohibition mayor (1887-8), became a Republican and served in US HoR (1891-9), then as Governor (1903-5), then as interim US Senator (1906-7) before becoming TR’s 2nd VP (1909). The 2nd Mexican-American War (1910-1920; a US victory) occurred in her first term, and she finally got Prohibition passed in 1916.\n\nTheodore Roosevelt is never going to come to power. He was too progressive for the party bossed and the only reason he was vice president was because historically that position led to political stagnation. Of course, McKinley was shot, leading to his coming to power IOTL. He's never going to be elected into power.\n\nI believe in Gap80's list he states that Theodore Roosevelt is the vice president to President Marcus Alonzo “Mark” Hanna, similar to him being VP to McKinley.\n\nThe difference in this list is that Theodore Roosevelt, has to wait until 1904, instead of 1901, to become president. And either wins the 1904 presidential election like in OTL or is the VP elect when President Hanna dies, but either way its still plausible."
