        "text": "Senator Olympia Snowe on 2000 GOP convention\n\nIn-Depth Coverage of the Republican National Convention\n\n(CNN) -- Maine Senator Olympia Snowe is only the fourth woman in history to be elected to both houses of Congress. She served in the House of Representatives for 16 years before replacing late Senator Margaret Chase Smith in 1994. Her legislative efforts include budget issues, campaign finance reform, health care, education and women's issues.\n\nChat Moderator: Thank you for joining us today, Senator Snowe, and welcome to the Allpolitics chat room.\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: Thank you. Its good to be here online.\n\nChat Moderator: Republicans have traditionally had a problem with the women's vote. Is the party more confident this year of competing with the Democrats for that vote?\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: Yes. I think it is due, in large part, to Governor Bush's emphasis on education, which is a primary issue to women and working families who are very much concerned about ensuring the very best possible education for their children. The emphasis during the course of this convention has been on diversity and inclusiveness, and that is an issue that has resonated as well with women in the past. The Republican party has traditionally had a gender gap. We are hoping this time, with the kind of message and issues that we will be emphasizing, that that would bridge this gap with women.\n\nQuestion from JrTyD: Olympia, Colin Powell's speech was very liberal, and John McCain didn't mention campaign finance reform. How well do these speakers represent the candidates here? How well do they represent Republicans?\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: I think that what this convention is all about is expressing issues and themes that change, in some ways, the face of the Republican party. Unfortunately, in the past, the conventions and the speeches that were delivered at those conventions appeared to be too harsh and intolerant. I think this time Governor Bush wanted to be sure that the perception of the Republican party was one of inclusion, and that Colin Powells speech emphasized children, inclusiveness and the traditional roots of the Republican party. I think both McCain and Powell were representative of the majority of delegates here at the convention, as well as Republicans nationwide. Thats why both speakers were received so enthusiastically.\n\nQuestion from WisOldMan: Senator Snowe, do you see the GOP convention having a carry-over effect to Congressional races for the GOP?\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: I hope so. I think that, if anything, the positive message being carried forth from this convention certainly will be helpful overall to congressional candidates. Ultimately, however, as a candidate myself, each of us has to run on his or her own record.\n\nMESSAGE BOARD\n\nThe conventions\n\nQuestion from Amyloo: Senator Snowe, which speaker so far has stirred you up the most? Isn't that what convention speeches are supposed to do?\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: Well, there are actually a number of outstanding speeches, but certainly I have to say Colin Powell and Condoleezza Rice -- both what they said and what they represent in terms of the issues concerning children and individual opportunity. Condoleezza Rice, not only because of her exceptional leadership and expertise in the fields of national security and defense, but also because she is a very accomplished woman.\n\nI should say Dick Cheney, as well, did a very effective job in drawing the differences between the two candidates for President.\n\nQuestion from Sunny1-CNN: Senator Snowe, the Republican platform doesn't match what we're hearing being said during the convention. Should we believe our eyes or our ears?\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: It's an interesting question. I think the platform has been modified to a considerable degree from the previous platform, most especially on the issue of education. For the first time in a long time, for example, the party platform does not call for the abolition of the Department of Education. Also, for the first time, the party platform has as a separate chapter -- the issue of education. In fact, 13 percent of the overall platform is devoted to the issue of education, and that is consistent with much of the message that is coming out of this convention and its speakers.\n\nQuestion from Jethro: Senator, are we not destroying the institution of the political conventions by removing actual news-making?\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: Well, it's actually been a long time since conventions have made news. I think given the primary process as we know it today essentially removes any suspense from the convention and, hence, news -- with the exception, possibly, of who might be the presumptive nominee's running mate in this case. Governor Bush made that selection prior to the convention. In 1980, Reagan, as the nominee, kept that decision in suspense until the final moment.\n\nChat Moderator: Thank you for joining us today, Senator Snowe.\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe: Thank you.\n\nSenator Olympia Snowe joined us by telephone from the Republican convention in Philadelphia. CNN.com provided a typist for her. The above is an edited transcript of that chat.\n\nCNN COMMUNITY:\n\nCheck out the CNN Chat calendar\n\nPost your opinion on our message boards\n\nRELATED STORY:\n\nGOP delegates officially name Bush presidential nominee\n\n8/3/00\n\nRELATED SITES:\n\nThe Office of Sen.
