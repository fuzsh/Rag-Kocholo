        "text": "Snow Surname Name Meaning, Origin, History, & Etymology\n\nThis English and Anglo-Saxon last name originated as a nickname for a person who had a very pale complexion or very white/blonde hair, from the Old English word snaw, meaning snow. In this theory, it may refers to the Viking, Norse, or Scandinavian folks that ended up establishing roots in England during medieval times. In some cases, it can also be an Americanized and shortened form of the German/Jewish surnames Schnei, Schnee, and Schneu. Others believe it means “the son of Snow”, similar to the last names Winter and Frost, which represents seasons, and was the name given to a child born in the snow. Others suggest the name derives from an old, perhaps mythical King of Denmark named Snow, and Snaer is a personification of snow in Norse mythology. Others mention is may be from the Dutch word snoo or Dano-Norwegian word snu, meaning cunning, sly, and crafty, (and hence referred to a person with these character traits) although there doesn’t seem to be much momentum behind this theory. It is believed the family first established itself in Rutland, likely before the Norman Conquest of 1066 AD, where they held land and titles. Some spelling variants or names with similar etymologies include Snowe, Snaw, Snows, and Snew.\n\nPopularity & Geographic Distribution\n\nThe last name Snow ranks 687th in popularity in the United Status as of the 2000 Census.

In Northern Ireland, it ranks highest in county Fermanagh. Henry Brougham Guppy’s 1890 book Homes of Family Names in Great Britain states the following in regard to this last name: “The Snows are now found in Devon, Essex, and Staffordshire.
