        "text": "Born: February 21, 1947 Augusta, Maine Died: Spouse: John R. McKernan, Jr. Olympia Jean Bouchles Snowe (born February 21, 1947 in Augusta, Maine) is a Republican politician and the senior United States senator from Maine. A moderate Republican in a Senate\n\nwith 44 Democrats, 55 Republicans, and one independent, Snowe often affects close votes and filibusters. This has given her enormous political influence on contentious issues; Congressional Quarterly noted \"her presence at the negotiating table in the 107th Congress . . . become nearly a necessity.\" Her moderate views have drawn attacks from conservative Republicans; the Club for Growth and Concerned Women for America label her a \"Republican in Name Only\" (\"RINO\"). Snowe married John McKernan, then-governor of Maine, in February 1989. Snowe and McKernan had served together in the United States House of Representatives from 1983 to 1986.\n\nSnowe was born Olympia Jean Bouchles, the daughter of George and Georgia Goranites Bouchles. Her father emigrated to the United States from Sparta, Greece. Snowe's early life was riddled with tragedy; her mother died of breast cancer when she was eight, and her father died of heart disease barely a year later. Orphaned, she was moved to Auburn, Maine, to be raised by her aunt and uncle, a barber and a textile mill worker respectively, along with their five other children. Her brother John was raised separately, by other family members. Within a few years, illness would also claim her uncle's life. Following her mother's death, Snowe was sent to St. Basil's Academy in Garrison, New York, where she remained from the third grade to the ninth. Returning to Auburn, she attended Edward Little High School, before entering the University of Maine in Orono, Maine in 1969, where she earned a degree in political science. Snowe later received an honorary degree from Bates College. Shortly after graduation, Bouchles married her fianc√©, Republican state legislator Peter Snowe."
