Sir Thomas More (Pronounced /ˈmɔr/; February 7, 1478 – July 6, 1535), also Saint Thomas More, was an Englishlawyer, social philosopher, author, statesman and noted Renaissance humanist. He was an important counsellor to Henry VIII of England and for three years toward the end of his life he was Lord Chancellor. He is also recognized as a saint within the Catholic Church and in the Anglican Communion.He was an opponent of the Protestant Reformation and of Martin Luther and William Tyndale. More coined the word \" utopia\" - a name he gave to the ideal, imaginary island nation whose political system he described in Utopia, published in 1516. He opposed the King's separation from the papal church and denied that the king was the Supreme Head of the Church of England, a status the king had been given by a compliant parliament through the Act of Supremacy of 1534. He was imprisoned in the Tower of London in 1534 for his refusal to take the oath required by the First Succession Act, because the act disparaged the power of the Pope and Henry’s marriage to Catherine of Aragon. In 1535 he was tried and executed for treason by beheading. More was beatified by the Catholic Church in 1886 and canonised, with John Fisher, in 1935. In 1980, he was added to the Church of England's calendar of saints. Born in Milk Street, London, on the 7 February 1478, Thomas More was the eldest son of Sir John More, a successful lawyer, and his wife Agnes ( née Graunger). More was educated at St Anthony's School, then considered one of the finest schools in London, and later spent the years 1490 to 1492 as a page in the household service of John Morton, the Archbishop of Canterbury and Lord Chancellor of England.Morton was an enthusiastic supporter of the 'New Learning' of the Renaissance, and thought highly of the young More. Believing that More showed great potential, Morton nominated him for a place at Canterbury College, Oxford, where More began his studies in 1492.More received a classical education at Oxford, and was a pupil of Thomas Linacre and William Grocyn, becoming proficient in both Greek and Latin. He left Oxford in 1494, after only two years at the insistence of his father, to begin his legal training in London at the New Inn, one of the Inns of Chancery.In 1496 he became a student at Lincoln’s Inn, one of the Inns of Court, where he remained until 1502, when he was called to the bar. According to Erasmus, More once seriously contemplated abandoning his legal career in order to become a monk. Between 1503 and 1504 More lived near the Carthusian monastery outside the walls of London, and joined in the monks' spiritual exercises. Although he deeply admired the piety of the monks, he ultimately decided on the life of a layman upon his marriage and election to Parliament in 1504.In spite of his choice to pursue a secular career, More continued to observe certain ascetical practices for the rest of his life, wearing a hair shirt next to his skin and occasionally engaging in flagellation. Sir Thomas More (later canonized St. Thomas More) is famous for his book Utopia (1515) and for his martyrdom. As Chancellor to Henry VIII he refused to sanction Henry's divorce of Queen Catherine. More was imprisoned, tried and executed. This drama was made into a play and an excellent (though not historically accurate) film - A Man of for All Seasons . St. Thomas More, Martyr (Patron of Lawyers) St. Thomas More was born at London in 1478. After a thorough grounding in religion and the classics, he entered Oxford to study law. Upon leaving the university he embarked on a legal career which took him to Parliament. In 1505, he married his beloved Jane Colt who bore him four children, and when she died at a young age, he married a widow, Alice Middleton, to be a mother for his young children. A wit and a reformer, this learned man numbered Bishops and scholars among his friends, and by 1516 wrote his world-famous book \"Utopia\". He attracted the attention of Henry VIII who appointed him to a succession of high posts and missions, and finally made him Lord Chancellor in 1529. However, he resigned in 1532, at the height of his career and reputation, when Henry persisted in holding his own opinions regarding marriage and the supremacy of the Pope. The rest of his life was spent in writing mostly in defense of the Church. In 1534, with his close friend, St. John Fisher, he refused to render allegiance to the King as the Head of the Church of England and was confined to the Tower. Fifteen months later, and nine days after St. John Fisher's execution, he was tried and convicted of treason. He told the court that he could not go against his conscience and wished his judges that \"we may yet hereafter in heaven merrily all meet together to everlasting salvation.\" And on the scaffold, he told the crowd of spectators that he was dying as \"the King's good servant-but God's first.\" He was beheaded on July 6, 1535. His feast day is June 22nd.

A lot of people think that how you behave is a given or that behavior is character. When you move around a lot, you learn that behavior is mutable. I would change, depending on where I was. I would go to one school and everyone would dance one way and, then, at a new school, you'd notice that no one picked up their feet when they danced. You're like, O.K. - I'll shuffle my feet like them. You learn that there's no one way to dance or be. For some reason, a lot of actors come from these peripatetic backgrounds - army kids, missionary kids, kids of salesmen. It teaches you to watch, to reinvent, that character can change…… Character Dress Important Clue Personal Quote: I always find that aspect of a character important. But, you can't say, \"Ooh - I like that Cristóbal Balenciaga dress and I'm going to wear it.\" You have to wear something that the character has access to. People tell stories about themselves with their clothing, their hair, with the way they move and the way they present themselves. I learned that when I was young. I was always on the lookout for clues. And there are a lot of clues in how people dress….. Boggie Nights Personal Quote: The script [for Boogie Nights (1997)] is primarily about love and loss and human connection, and although Tom reveals himself very slowly, what he reveals is very genuine….. Personal Quote: [on meeting director Tom Ford]: I met him in 1998, right after my son was born. [Moore has two children and is married to the director Bart Freundlich.] Tom made a dress for me for the Oscars, the first time I was nominated, for Boogie Nights (1997). In that movie, I played Amber Waves, a porno actress. Tom was unbelievably charming and handsome and normal, not scary, which surprised me because he was one of the first designers I'd ever met. He made me a really beautiful black chiffon dress that kind of had an empire waist. Because I'd just had a baby, my boobs were really big. I didn't feel confident enough to wear it. But Tom was incredibly gracious. He said, 'I don't care - wear it, don't wear it - it's just a dress,' And that was the beginning of my friendship with Tom. Personal Quote: You never have sex the way people do in the movies. You don't do it on the floor, you don't do it standing up, you don't always have all your clothes off, you don't happen to have on all the sexy lingerie. You know, if anybody ever ripped my clothes, I'd kill them….. Blue Dress Blue Car Personal Quote: It's true, the classic, iconic American ideal, that heroine, our idea of perfection is this blonde woman in a blue dress and a blue car….. Acting Personal Quote: That's the beauty of what actors do, that you only have yourself as a resource. And so the trick is to find something in them that you connect to somewhere. And with every single one of my characters, I have to find something that I really understand and ultimately believe….. Military Family Personal Quote: My parents were very liberal. That's a misconception about the military. I'm a proud Army brat. I love the military. It breaks my heart what this war has done to it. These backdoor, draft like returns of soldiers to the front - you don't do that. You don't send a soldier back three or four times. That's not OK.\" ….. Personal Quote: When someone says, 'I'm not political,' I feel like what they're saying is 'I only care about myself. In my bathtub. Me and my bathtub is what I care about.' ….. Female Woman Lady Girls Mothers Moms Personal Quote: There's always a female audience. But we will only go if they make movies for us because we're just too busy. It makes me crazy when people ask why women don't go to the movies. Number one, there are no movies for us and, number two, we have jobs and families. I never get out of the house with two little kids. If I go, I want to know it really is something for me. I want it to be relevant to me… …. Physiognomy Personal Quote: The great disappointment is that when you're acting, you've literally become a different person in your head, and when you see it you go, Oh! It's the same face! You feel sometimes so limited by your physiognomy. You are desperately trying to look different, but it doesn't always work. There are some things that you can change, but unfortunately you're always left with the same face….. Acting Career Dreams Personal Quote:[on growing up with dreams on an acting career]: I thought I was going to be a stage actress. One of the pathetic, secret parts of my personality is I love musical theater. I did that in high school but not very well. Even now, I love musicals: Hairspray (1988) is genius. But I think people think of me as a bore, you know. A tragic bore. Dark is not something I am, but from the beginning people assumed my métier was tragedy. When I started out, I was cast on a soap opera, \"As the World Turns\" (1986), as a quintessential good girl. I did that for a while and then they created the role of my evil, selfish half-sister/cousin. I played that too. They immediately thought of me as dark….. Personal Quote: I try to make my characters as specific as I can….. Great Character Good Story Personal Quote: If I have a hesitation on reading, I don't commit. I respond to the material or not. I like story. That's what I'm attracted to even more than character. It's no fun if it's a great character but not a good story. What did Flaubert say? \"Be ordinary in your life so that you can be violent and original in your work!\" I believe that….. Charlotte in A Single Man (2009)]: Personal Quote: on playing Charlotte in A Single Man (2009)]: No, I wasn't thinking about Ann-Margret [in Carnal Knowledge (1971)]. A lot of the character began with a particular vocal choice: she's someone who is very wealthy, very educated and kind of a party girl. There's this way of speaking among these women where you don't know whether they're posh or hammered all the time. So, that's where I started. Then I listened to very early Julie Christie, to get the early-'60s kind of sound, and then I listened to some very modern British party girls. That's how I came up with Charly's sloppy sound….. Children and Personal Quote: My children don't watch my movies. First of all, they're not interested and, secondly, my movies are not for children. As an actor, you're trying to portray the human condition and sometimes we don't wear clothes. I made a movie called Chloe and there's a great deal of sexual material in it. The director, Atom Egoyan said: \"You know, people do this. And when they do it, they're usually nude.\"….. Fearless Personal Quote: [on giving fearless performances] - I always say that to be fearless you actually have to be afraid. And acting is not something that scares me.It's something I enjoy….. Personal Quote Done: If there's something that you haven't done that you've been waiting to do, the by all means, don't wait any longer. Do it!..... Personal Quote Candy: Like all parents, we both have our strengths and our weaknesses. I'll tend to be 'Yeah, sure, you can have that gum'. I'm easy with candy. I feel like 'Ugh, it's not going to kill you.'….. Comic Role in Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011)] Personal Quote: [on uncharacteristically playing a comic role in Crazy, Stupid, Love. (2011)] The older you get, the less alluring tragedy becomes. I think it's very easy, when you're 23, to see everything dark and tragic, but as you get older and see what people go through you realize people want to laugh…… Redhead Personal Redhead Quote: My very first director told me that if you have red hair, somebody is casting you for a reason. He said, \"There will be parts that you don't get because, especially onstage, people can see you.\" I've been wigged plenty of times, but the funny thing is that even when I have a different hair color, people tend to still remember me as having red hair…… Personal Lifestyle Choice as a Kid Quote: I had a very wonderful teacher in Frankfurt, my English teacher, she was the drama coach and she said, \"You could do this for a living.\" And it hadn't occurred to me, I didn't know anybody who did, I didn't know any actors, I'd never been to a real play, only school plays. So, she handled me a copy of Dramatics magazine and said, 'These are schools that you can apply to,' and I came home and told my parents I was going to be an actress.***** Pg. 595 Red is a Natural Basic Instinct Expression Color of more than a Line…..\n\n​\n\n​\n\nPage 134\n\n​\n\n​\n\n507.)

Born on February 18, 1950, in Memphis, Tennessee, Shepherd won the 1966 Miss Teenage Memphis contest. Turning to modeling, Shepherd at 5' 9\" and 140 lbs. was more full-figured than 'Twiggy' and her clones who were popular in the late 1960s, and she quickly became a success, being named the 1968 Model of the Year. --> Maybe Three Visionary Daughters & 3 Daughters Know Daughter Maybe Mama Knows Best --> Cybill Lynne Shepherd (born February 18, 1950) is an Americanactress, singer and former fashion model. Her best known roles include starring as Jacy in The Last Picture Show, Maddie Hayes on Moonlighting, as Cybill Sheridan on Cybill, as Betsy in Taxi Driver and as Phyllis Kroll on The L Word. Early Life: Shepherd was born in Memphis, Tennessee, the daughter of Patty (née Shobe), a homemaker, and William Jennings Shepherd, who managed a home appliance business. Named after her grandfather Cy and her father Bill, Shepherd won the 1966 \"Miss Teenage Memphis\" contest at age 16, and the 1968 \"Model of the Year\" contest at age 18, making her a fashion star of the 1960s, resulting in fashion modeling work through high school and after. Career:According to Shepherd's autobiography, it was a 1970 Glamour magazine cover that caught the eye of film director Peter Bogdanovich. His then-wife Polly Platt, however, claimed that it was she who upon seeing the cover in a check-out line in a Ralphs grocery store in southern California, said \"That's Jacy\", referring to the role Bogdanovich was casting — and ultimately offered to Shepherd — in The Last Picture Show (1971). Personal Life:In her autobiography, she revealed that in 1978 she called her mother, crying, unhappy with the way her life and career were going, to which her mother replied \"Cybill, come home\". She went home to Memphis where she met and began dating local auto parts dealer and nightclub entertainer David M Ford. She became pregnant and they married that year. Their daughter Clementine Ford was born in 1979 but the marriage ended in divorce in 1982.

So what's wrong with that?\" She also said in an interview: \"I have wondered about [lesbianism]... At various times in my life. Religious Beliefs: Shepherd has described her religious beliefs as \"a goddess-worshiping Christian PaganBuddhist\" . Irish Trivia Inane Doggie Nose: Was told she had a \"great ass\" by Marlon Brando as she walked away from him at a Hollywood party held for Stella Adler. Adler had been the acting teacher of both Brando and Shepherd's then-lover, Peter Bogdanovich. Shepherd had been sitting on a couch with Brando and Adler when Brando announced he couldn't stand her inane talk. After being insulted, she got up and left, only to be complimented by the great actor on her derrière. At the party, Adler also told her that her \"Irish nose\" prevented her from being a great beauty. Induction Trivia: Inducted into the Texas Film Hall of Fame on March 10, 2006. The other inductees were Matthew McConaughey, Kris Kristofferson, JoBeth Williams and Lyle Lovett. Dedication Dedicated more than Trivia Fact: Larry McMurtry's 1987 novel, \"Texasville\" is dedicated to her. \"Texasville\" is the sequel to \"The Last Picture Show\", the film version of which Shepherd made her acting debut as Jacy. She would reprise the role in the sequel's 1999 film adaptation…… Mini Biography: Shepherd did not appear again for four years, with a leading role the TV series \"The Yellow Rose\" (1983). Though the series was short-lived, the smaller medium was kinder to her. She next took the lead in the tongue-in-cheek detective series \"Moonlighting\" (1985), and she began to thrive as an actress. She won an Emmy nomination for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series. But she had to share the spotlight with superstar-in-the-making Bruce Willis, her \"Moonlighting\" (1985) co-star, whom she detested. After a so-so return to films, including Texasville (1990) her former lover's under-whelming sequel to The Last Picture Show (1971), she returned to the box with Memphis (1992) (TV), a TV-movie she executive-produced and co-wrote with Larry McMurtry. (McMurtry, author and screenwriter of The Last Picture Show (1971), had dedicated his novel \"Texasville\" to her.) Soon, she achieved her most sustained singular success as a comedienne in the situation comedy \"Cybill\" (1995), for which she was three times nominated for an Emmy as Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series. She had arrived. Cybill has continued to thrive in the fourth decade of her acting career, appearing in TV movies such as Martha, Inc.: The Story of Martha Stewart (2003) (TV), and touring with a musical act based on her well-received autobiography \"Cybill Disobedience\". Her recovery from the depths of a shattered career after an auspicious start is remarkable and unique in the industry and gives lie to F.
