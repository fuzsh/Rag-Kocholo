Snowe previously served as a member of the US House of Representatives from Maine's 2nd district from 3 January 1979 to 3 January 1995, succeeding Bill Cohen and preceding John Baldacci. Snowe was the youngest Republican woman ever elected to the House, the first Greek-American congresswoman, and the first woman to serve in both houses of a state legislature and both houses of US Congress. Snowe and fellow Maine Republican senator Susan Collins were known for being Rockefeller Republicans, supporting social liberalism and fiscal conservatism.\n\nBiography[]"
