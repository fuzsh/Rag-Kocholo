You heard it here first.\n\nShe is a Republican. A former Senator. Born in 1947. She is pro-choice and supports gay rights. She is not a lawyer, which might be a good thing.\n\nIf confirmed, she would be a moderate, centrist voice on the court.\n\nRepublicans would be blocking the nomination of Olympia Snowe at their peril. If Obama were to play it cannily, he would put his Republican adversaries in a quandary. How could they turn down one of their own?\n\nNOTE: On the 17th, The Times noted the possibility of a Republican legislator was unlikely but not off the table:\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\n[email protected]\n\nWelcome to Talker of the Town! My name is David Kramer. I have a Ph.D in English and teach at Keuka College. I am a former and still active Fellow at the Nazareth College Center for Public History and a Storyteller in Residence at the SmallMatters Institute. Over the years, I have taught at Monroe Community College, the Rochester Institute of Technology and St. John Fisher College. I have published numerous Guest Essays, Letters, Book Reviews and Opinion pieces in The New York Times, Rochester Democrat and Chronicle, the Buffalo News, the Rochester Patriot, the Providence Journal, the Providence Business News, the Brown Alumni Magazine, the New London Day, the Boston Herald, the Messenger Post Newspapers, the Wedge, the Empty Closet, the CITY, Lake Affect Magazine and Brighton Connections. My poetry appears in The Criterion: An International Journal in English and Rundenalia and my academic writing in War, Literature and the Arts and Twentieth Century Literary Criticism. Starting in February 2013, I wrote for three Democratic and Chronicle blogs, \"Make City Schools Better,\" \"Unite Rochester,\" and the \"Editorial Board.\" When my tenure at the D & C ended, I wanted to continue conversations first begun there. And start new ones. So we created this new space, Talker of the Town, where all are invited to join. I don’t like to say these posts are “mine.” Very few of them are the sole product of my sometimes overheated imagination. Instead, I call them partnerships and collaborations. Or as they say in education, “peer group work.” Talker of the Town might better be Talkers of the Town. The blog won’t thrive without your leads, text, pictures, ideas, facebook shares, tweets, comments and criticisms."
