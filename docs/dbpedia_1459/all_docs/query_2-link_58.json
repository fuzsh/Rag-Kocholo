        "text": "If there was a lesson to be learned — or reinforced — at the 18th Women United Luncheon it was that bickering, bluster, name-calling and under-handed maneuvering are not the only ways to effect change.\n\nFormer U.S. Sen. Olympia Snowe, the keynote speaker at this benefit for Mile High United Way, and Libby Anschutz, recipient of the 2016 Frances Wisebart Jacobs Award, are women who have made a difference — not by being loud and obnoxious but by making collaboration one of their strong suits.\n\nAnschutz uses the magic of music to bring attention to causes relating to health, education, human services, public policy and personal values. Snow, a Republican from Maine who in 2005 was named the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine, has been a leading policymaker in such arenas as women’s issues, aging and foreign affairs.\n\n“Bipartisanship isn’t a political theory. It is a necessity … (and) we must demand it,” Snowe told the 950 who attended the event held at the Marriott City Center. And, with a nod to the upcoming election, “We can do better, we must do better, America deserves better.”\n\nAnschutz is the co-founder and keyboardist for Tracksuit Wedding and director of community affairs for AEG Live Rocky Mountains. After earning a bachelor of arts degree from Princeton, she served as president of Ansbro Petroleum, president of The Anschutz Foundation and held various roles at the Anschutz Investment Co., Qwest Communications and Montgomery Securities.\n\n“Libby understands that music is the soul of the universe,” said luncheon chair Maggie Dehn, senior director at TIAA, the event’s presenting sponsor. “She brings life to everything she touches and is the real deal when it comes to effecting change.”\n\n“This is what a community united looks like,” observed Mile High United Way’s president and chief executive officer, Christine Benero. “We use civil dialogue to reach common ground. We are women who are willing to be powerful images and role models because we know that when we lift each other up, the entire community benefits.”\n\nAnschutz’s husband, Jeff Allen; parents, Phil and Nancy Anschutz, and sister, Sarah Hunt, were at the luncheon, along with state Rep. Janet Buckner; Arlene Hirschfeld; Christie Isenberg; MJ Powers; Susan Noble; Caz Matthews; and Neyeska Mut.\n\nDehn was joined by such colleagues as Kathie Andrade, the company’s chief executive officer of retail financial services, and senior managing directors Cathy McCabe and Ray Bellucci.\n\nOthers helping to raise $290,000 for such United Way programs as Reading Matters, the 2-1-1 Help Center and Bridging the Gap were board chair Mary McBride; former chair Brad Busse; Linda Brisnehan; Teresa Van De Bogart; Carol Lay; Kimberly Smith; Julie Bearup; and Tinesha Ross, a project manager with United Launch Alliance, which also was a luncheon sponsor.\n\nJoanne Davidson: 303-809-1314, partiwriter@hotmail.com and @joannedavidson on Twitter"
