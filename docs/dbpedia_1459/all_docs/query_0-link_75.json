Trial Lawyer.\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 07:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nMarch 09, 2024\n\nBadness in Depositions: \"Stop me before I coach again.\"\n\nAn objection must be stated concisely in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner.\n\n--from Rule 30(c)(2), Fed. R. Civ. P.\n\nDefending lawyers who testify are bad. And let he or she without sin cast the first stapler. In defending in a deposition, giving speeches and coaching your witness on the record is \"bad\" because it may be suggestive of the answer the witness should give. We could go on and on and on about this--but we'll just be quiet and let you read it.\n\n(Does this guy ever shut up?)\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 03:59 AM | Comments (0)\n\nNovember 06, 2023\n\nHey, Counselor, is that a Popularly-Elected State Court Judge in Your Pocket?\n\nOr just happy to see me?\n\nJudges should not have \"constituents.\" But in most American states, they still do. And there is no way to dress that up.\n\nElection Day Reminder: If you can vote at the polls for a state judiciary candidate today, please don't. Raise your aspirations. Go to the track, play pinball, drink Ripple, watch Gong Show reruns, or visit that \"Leather World\" alternative lifestyle clothing-and-book store on Route 73 you've always wondered about. From past WAC? posts:\n\nQuick and dirty re: elected state judges and campaign money. See also, That a popularly-elected state judge in your pocket?. We've followed and written a lot on the U.S. Supreme Court case about a popularly elected state supreme court judge, and campaign money recipient, who failed to disqualify himself in arguably suspect circumstances. SCOTUS ruled in June 2009 that a West Virginia judge should indeed have disqualified himself from hearing an appeal of a $50 million jury verdict against an a coal company because its CEO had been a major campaign donor. See slip opinion in Caperton v. Massey Coal Company (June 8, 2009).\n\nThe popular election of state judges--permitted in some aspect in a clear majority of the states--gives the appearance of justice being \"for sale.\" Elected judges can be especially \"bad\" for good clients who do business all over the U.S. and the world. Even when elected judges are \"good\"--and, to be fair, there are some great ones--state systems of popularly-elected judiciary will never inspire much confidence. Elected jurists who hear and decide business disputes are steeped in a taint.\n\nThe point: Judges should not have \"constituents,\" i.e. law firms, and their clients, who make campaign contributions. Right now, in most American states, they do. And there is no way to dress that up.\n\nGenerally county-based, American litigation at a state level is already frustratingly local and provincial for \"outsider defendants\"--businesses from other U.S. states and other nations sued in local state courts--who cannot remove to federal courts, the forums where federal judges can and should protect them from local prejudice.*\n\nAmerican states that still hang on to electoral systems look increasingly provincial, classless, and silly from a global perspective. Merit selection is not perfect--and also poses risks--but it is far better than what most American states currently have in place. It's time for American states to grow up. See our many past posts over the last four years on this subject in our category on the right side of this site: Federal Courts.\n\n*One reason that federal diversity jurisdiction was created in the first place was because of the framersâ concern that prejudices of state judges toward out-of-state persons would unfairly affect outcomes in trial courts. Erwin Griswold, Law and Lawyers in the United States, 65 (Cambridge, Harv. Press 1964). Over 200 years later, our current systems in the states make that local prejudice almost inevitable. See also, the interview by General Electric's Mike McIlwrath in July 2009 of Prof. Geoffrey Hazard of Hastings Law School, who addresses why European business really fear U.S. state courts.\n\n--from a 11.03.09 WAC? post\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:10 PM | Comments (0)\n\nSeptember 30, 2023\n\nCERTIORARI GRANTED.

North Star. Exalted Teacher. Consigliere.: The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.\n\nYes, \"read the rule...\" The Federal Rules of Civil Procedure are remarkable and, well, amazing. They vibrate, hum and glow with the hard work of the few who have worked on them over the years. In your first year. Tenth year. Twentieth year. Fortieth year of practice. They are shorter and better (i.e., much easier to grasp) than any non-FRCP-based state counterparts. There are flaws and ambiguities--but precious few. You notice something different every time. You never take them for granted. Look. At. Them. Every. Time. Read the Advisory Committee Notes, too. They, too, are to the point--and lean. Start with the Rule. Read the Note.

Good trial lawyers overlook that FRE 612 applies to depositions as well as to trials. Federal decisions have applied the rule to depositions based upon Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(c). So ask a deponent if he or she looked at documents before the deposition other than those being produced at the deposition. If the answer is \"yes\", request that they be produced. Go to the judge. You can have them produced during or after the deposition. Often the best documents are the ones that never make it to the deposition, like handwritten records that even opposing counsel doesn't know about.\n\nScopes trial, outdoor proceedings, July 20, 1925\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:10 AM | Comments (0)\n\nNovember 13, 2019\n\nPaul Cezanne, Les joueurs de carte, 1892\n\nPaul Cezanne, Les joueurs de carte, 1890-1892\n\nPosted by Holden Oliver (KitzbÃ¼hel Desk) at 08:00 PM | Comments (0)\n\nNovember 08, 2018\n\nSound Post-Midterms Advice. Overstatements are Bad. Avoid Them.\n\nBeing part-Irish like me is a gift. Mainly.\n\nBut overstatements for lawyers at work are Mainly Bad. True, they can be hilarious. With them, at parties, and in arguments with lame store clerks, we can drive home a point using hyperbole. Overstatements can even impress your date, wife or mistress--or all three. They can feel good to make.\n\nBut they are Bad for lawyers (and for our witnesses). We should keep them out of pleadings and remarks to arbitrators, mediators and judges. And juries.

A tall smart Houston professional black woman had slipped on a step and (allegedly) hurt her back in a BK facing the FBI building. She had diversity juridction so it went to DC district court before older WASPy judge (John Lewis Smith) who were were happy to draw. Plaintiff was also the first deponent I had ever examinedâdeposition lasted 6 hours (carrier hated me for that)âand she seemed smart but smallish, fragile and ailing when I took it.\n\nThe trial lasted 3 days. The judge hated her and black attorney (who was excellent) and loved me and my Pittsburgh-based partner like we were his Mayflower Bros. But the jury of course was mainly black. When she walked into the courtroom the first day she sashayed in healthy and shapely and about 6â2â in these 3â heels. (Thatâs how confident their side was. Great rack, too. Everyone male in the courtroom wanted to jump her....but I digress here.) She didnât seem sick. She wasnât poor. She seemed happy. But testified off this âvictimâsâ script that her life was ruined. Our cross examination was skillful and to most observersâincluding to a black paralegal we shipped in from Detroit just to sit thereâdevastating.\n\nAnd she won. Not a lot.

We don't care as much as you do about your maintaining or developing collegiality with other lawyers in your jurisdiction; in fact, we could not care less.\n\n6. If opposing counsel shows animosity toward you for following the procedural rules and keeping things moving, that is tough. This is not about the lawyers. We hired you to represent us.

But who gets to be lead counsel in litigation is ultimately determined by both merit and the client.\n\nWhen are we going to stop treating women lawyers and other female professionals like ne'er-do-wells and screw-ups who need special treatment to succeed? There's actually a discussion out there on why more women are not lead trial counsel. See this August 1 ABA piece entitled \"Why aren't more women lead counsel?\" The article grows out of a panel this summer at the ABA Annual Meeting, which in turn had grown out of an American Bar Foundation study. The ABF study among other things found that, unsurprisingly, men were disproportionately appearing as lead counsel in civil cases (based on 558 cases in the Illinois Northern federal district) by 76% to 24%. The study's conclusion is below. Brackets and italics are mine. The italics highlight phrases which I think would be insulting in the extreme to talented women in any profession; the implication in the italics is that women lawyers are ne'er-do-wells, screw-ups and/or congenitally handicapped:\n\nFostering the success of women litigators redounds to the benefit of clients, who obtain top-notch representation in their cases [Huh? Why does it help clients? More choice?]; to law firms, which have made a substantial investment in hiring and training their women litigators; and to women lawyers themselves, who are able to realize their full potential and advance in their careers. We believe it is imperative for all concerned that women are encouraged and supported in their pursuit of a career in the courtroom and the role of lead counsel at trial.\n\nWe hope that this study will heighten awareness about the existence of significant gender disparities in the ranks of lead trial lawyers. We want to spur a dialogue that will result in concrete and effective actions to increase the numbers of women lead trial counsel. These recommended best practices will help women litigators develop their skills and obtain the same opportunities for leadership roles and success in the courtroom as their male colleagues.\n\nMe personally? And professionally? Look, I would rather work with women lawyers generally than with male lawyers because I think women lawyers, for whatever reason, are generally on balance better planners, thinkers and practitioners, and better with clients, than are men. They tend to write better. Much better with deadlines, frankly. They're feisty. Many are as mean as snakes. But who gets to be lead counsel in litigation is ultimately determined by both merit and the client.\n\nFor trial work both women and men should be lead counsel (or first chair) if (a) they deserve it based on skills and (b) clients want it. Plenty of women certainly do deserve to be lead counsel based on merit. Lots. They are legion. Are there stats on this? Of course not. Qualitatively, can we say there is currently as much female as there is male first-chair talent? Actually some kind of parity in terms of skill? Are they roughly equal in numbers? It's a hard thing to measure but, no. Probably not.\n\nLitigation is still way overpriced, insane, male-oriented, overly-testosterone-driven and inefficient; I've no numbers (if you do, show me) but my sense is that women over the past two or three decades in private practice, and certainly in larger firms, have had the good sense to chose transactional work and more efficient forms of litigation (e.g., administrative, regulatory, ADR) than state and federal trial court forums where machismo, sporadic irrationality and other forms of male insanity are well-tolerated whether these modalities are working or not. That may change. I see women choosing both conventional trial and appellate work more and more, and getting as good at it as male lawyers or even better. In the meantime, we can assume that no one will be insane enough to suggest that the imbalance between male and female lead counsel be rectified (read: contrived) by a quota system. Right?\n\nMore important is the problem of women who want and deserve on the basis of merit to be lead counsel--but really are thwarted or held back by gender-bias. What then? It's a tough question. Here's the tough answer. Right or wrong, clients--not notions of political correctness and private enterprise-side affirmative action--should drive who serves as lead counsel. Law firms are already under tremendous pressures to embrace mediocrity and settle for something less than clients want and deserve. Firms are under no obligation to force clients to \"evolve\" so that women in litigation are first chairs--even when they merit lead counsel spots on defense or plaintiff teams in the finest litigation shops. Nor should they be. Granted, it's not a fair answer. But it's a client's call.\n\nThe ABA article--which makes some good points about former women prosecutors going to law firms before silly notions of \"parity\" creep into it and the wheels fall off--is here:\n\nIf women want to be trial lawyers, the best place to have first-chair opportunities may be with federal prosecutors, according to a recent ABA study. But considering that many assistant U.S. attorneys eventually join big firms as partners, some wonder why there are few women at big law firms leading trials.\n\nâMost male litigators who serve as federal prosecutors, they get their tickets punched. Thereâs no absence of female lead prosecutors, and they also get gobbled up by big firms. But what happens to them, and why arenât they serving as lead counsel?â asked Ruben Castillo, chief judge of the Northern District of Illinois U.S. district court.\n\nCastillo spoke on a Saturday panel at the ABA Annual MeetingââWomen as Lead Counsel at Trial: What You Can Do to Take the Lead,â sponsored by the ABAâs Commission on Women in the Professionâthat discussed the lack of women serving as lead counsel. He noted that the event had very few men in the audience.\n\nâIâve been on the bench 21 years, and I would say Iâve had about 14 or 15 cases where the women before me were lead counsel,â Castillo said, adding that he plans to have some sort of conference on the issue in the future.\n\nThe panelists focused on a recent study by the American Bar Foundation and the Commission on Women in the Profession titled First Chairs at Trial: More Women Need Seats at the Table (PDF). The study reviewed 600 Northern District of Illinois cases filed in 2013. Out of the 558 civil cases, 76 percent of the lead counsel were men. For the 50 criminal cases, 67 percent of the lead counsel were men. Out of the 50 criminal cases that went to trial, 79 percent of the lawyers serving as lead counsel were men.\n\nAnother panelist, Sandra Phillips, noted that she recently hired two women of color to lead two significant class action cases against her employer, Toyota Motors North America.\n\nPhillips, the holding companyâs general counsel and chief legal officer, says that she actively seeks female outside counsel, and occasionally gets pushback from law firms. Often, she added, the firms respond that older white males have the most experience and knowledge about her employer, and it would be unfair to assign the work to someone else. âIf weâre going to move the needle on this, we need to dispense with this notion of fairness. Itâs not fair that 79 percent of the people who are taking the lead in the courtroom are men,â said Phillips, who is based in Torrance, California.\n\nâWho really wins cases?â Phillips added. âLawyers who have been around for 40 years and know the company well, or lawyers who can tell a good story in the courtroom, who are collaborative, competitive and solution-oriented?â\n\nPaula Hinton, a Winston & Strawn litigation partner based in Houston, says that she does sometimes encounter implicit bias, usually from clients.\n\nâThey tend to go with what they think is the safe choice of a white male for their lead lawyer who has an established reputation,â she said. âBut at trial time, if the case is in a ditch, I get parachuted in. What happens is itâs not going well with what they thought was a safe choice.â\n\nA potential solution mentioned to improve first-chair gender numbers was letting lawyers who write briefs argue them, recognizing that the writing is often done by female associates or junior partners.\n\nâSometimes when a male senior partner is in front of me arguing, I can see the female associate next to them flinching, as the beautifully written brief they wrote is ruined,â said Sophia Hall, a Cook County, Illinois, circuit court judge.\n\nWhen judges notice that a first-chair lawyer seems to be having problems making his or her argument, they can ask the lawyer seated next to him or her for further explanation, panelists said. If the associate can do a good job answering the courtâs questions, itâs often a sign that he or she will be a good trial lawyer.\n\nâIn larger cases where thereâs a courtroom full of suited lawyers, Iâm looking for someone who is going to help me understand,â added Hall, mentioning one complex case where a âwoman piped up, âI have a chart.â â\n\nHall said: âThat got my attention. You can call attention to yourself by having not only a sense of the law but also the context, and present it in a way thatâs understandable.\n\nâThe other important thing is that a lawyer leading the case can work with personalities. With male lawyers, sometimes you go through testosterone pyrotechnics, and females can sit back and cut to the chase. As judges, weâre looking for a voice of reason thatâs calm and intelligent. If you can do that, it will allow you to look really good.â\n\nThe issue of calling attention to yourself was also addressed.\n\nâYou need to have a reputation that precedes you. You donât get the reputation by just sitting in your office,â said Stephanie A. Scharf. A litigation partner with Chicagoâs Scharf Banks Marmor who co-authored First Chairs at Trial with Roberta D. Liebenberg, a senior litigation partner with Philadelphiaâs Fine, Kaplan and Black.\n\nâNothing is better than trying a case,â said Liebenberg when asked why she never abandoned litigation as a career. âThereâs nothing more exhausting, but thereâs nothing better.â\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:40 PM | Comments (1)\n\nJuly 11, 2015\n\nHelp Wanted: Texas local counsel in Dallas-FW-Arlington area.\n\nSingers of songs and dreamers of plays\n\nBuild a house no wind blows over.\n\nThe CPAsâtell me why a hearse horse snickers\n\nhauling a CPA's bones.\n\n--Carl Sandburg (mainly) from The Lawyers Know Too Much, ABA Journal, Vol. VII, No. 1 (Jan. 1921), p. 23 (see jump below)\n\nWe usually represent corporations unfairly accused in federal courts of something bad (contract, patent, trademark or copyright issue), sloppy (spilt fossil fuel/CERCLA/drive-by littering/RCRA) or plain low-down (fraud/insider trading felony murder) by either another corporation by a government.

Let's put an end to the practice in 38 states of electing judges.\n\nToday, Americans are voting in mid-term federal elections for all House seats and one-third of the U.S. Senate seats. Moreover, except in Louisiana--with its general election in early December--voters in each state are voting for candidates for office in a extraordinarily wide variety of state, county, municipal and local elections. Unfortunately, voters in 37 (Louisiana the exception, again) of the 38 states that popularly elect judges will also participate today in those contests.\n\nThe popular election of state judges in all of these states is a bad practice and should come to an end. Anyone who has read my writings in various newspapers and legal periodicals over the past 20 years, or has read this blog since three Hull McGuire lawyers started it nine years ago, knows that our firm prefers whenever possible to do its business litigation in federal courts--where judges are appointed on the basis of merit and, in our view, do appreciably better work as jurists than their state counterparts--and regards state courts as unpredictable and often dysfunctional venues to be avoided.\n\nRegular readers also know that our problem with state courts is that most of them are filled at all levels with judges who are elected. We won't repeat all of our arguments here. Suffice to say that popular elections of judges does two unproductive things. First, in effect, they give successful candidates \"constituents\". Second, citizens and litigants are given the impression that justice is \"for sale.\" America outgrew electing state judges generations ago, and to continue this practice is wrong. See, also, \"Is that a state judge in your pocket? Or you just hugely happy to see me?\". Judges should be appointed on a merit system by people who know how to identify and evaluate the excellent lawyers we want on the bench.\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 12:13 AM | Comments (0)\n\nJune 07, 2014\n\nBlowing it in Brooklyn: When prosecutors withhold evidence favorable to the accused.\n\nSometimes winning isn't everything.

Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83 (1963) . As a result of Brady, federal and state prosecutors are in effect under a continuing obligation to disclose information or evidence which tends to prove the innocence of a criminal defendant, or would allow the defense to impeach the credibility of government witnesses.*\n\nSapien has written a fine article about wrenching and almost unfathomable consequences for defendants and their families when even well-regarded Assistant U.S. Attorneys or Assistant District Attorneys fail to turn over exculpatory evidence and information. Lengthy but excellent.\n\n*Prosecutors under Brady are also required to turn over evidence or information which could be used to reduce a sentence.\n\n(Bebeto Matthews/AP Photo)\n\nJonathan Fleming (above hugging one of his lawyers) was 27 when he reported to prison after his conviction on a murder charge. Last month, after serving 24 years in prison of a 25 year sentence, Fleming, now 51, was released. The withheld evidence in his case was a time-stamped phone bill and a communication from the Orlando police (indicating Fleming was seen around his Orlando hotel at the time of the Brooklyn murder) that powerfully supported Fleming's alibi he was in Orlando, Florida rather than Brooklyn at the time the murder occurred.\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 05:36 PM | Comments (0)\n\nApril 08, 2014\n\nOntario trial judge: \"Paper must vanish from this Court...\"\n\nSo says Canadian Justice David M.

With an assist from the enduring Army Times, Mayer sketches the classic collision of Selfies and Blowing Off Military Retreat Honors. In a nutshell, an Army private assigned to the 59th Sustainment Brigade at Fort Carson, Colorado, ducked into her car to avoid saluting the American flag being lowered at 5 p.m., selfied herself and trumpeted her disobedience with considerable sass in the selfie's caption. Legions of folks, some veterans, complained. A Fort Carson post spokesperson named McNutt has confirmed that the military chain of command is all over this like a big dog, and Pfc. Sheffey will have to answer. Our take?

Why?\n\nYes, we continue to bang this drum. But we think that the popular election of state judges is bad for everyone, and especially bad for businesses, both American and non-American companies, that typically appear before judges in a number of states. American state courts with judges chosen popularly send a message to citizens, clients and the entire world that (1) judges have \"constituents\", and (2) justice in those forums is for sale.

What is the significance of the \"delayed answer\" to a question? In one culture, delay means hesitancy and evasiveness (e.g., to most Westerners). In another, delay may denote careful consideration of the question--and a sign of respect to the questioner.\n\nFour years ago, GE's in-house counsel Mike McIlwrath interviewed Australian mediator Joanna Kalowski, who works out of both Australia and Paris.

As Rome discovered too late, protecting every terrain and border is expensive and draining. As business and trial people learn young, butting heads with everyone who has ever done you a disservice, or fighting every point in an oral argument, or an evidentiary or discovery dispute, will not just be expensive and draining.

You wild man, John Roberts.\n\nFancy if surprising footwork there, John Roberts. And it was interesting to everyone to see how SCOTUS got there. Today by a 5-4 vote the U.S. Supreme Court surprisingly upheld the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act passed by Democrats in 2010. And it did that with a ruling penned by Chief Justice Roberts which--to the Court's credit--did not create commerce when none existed to even regulate under the Commerce Clause. Bad constitutional lawyering by Roberts was avoided by his reaching to uphold ACA under the Power to Tax. The decision has a long-term effect on SCOTUS practice (and to a much lesser extent on constitutional law) and powerful short-term effect on, of course, the 2012 elections. CNN, by the way, had first reported that the ACA's mandate to make people buy insurance (clearly if unfortunately unconstitutional under the Commerce Clause, in our view, and the biggest problem with the ACA) had been struck down--but finally got it right. Excerpt:\n\nThe most anticipated Supreme Court ruling in years allows the government to continue implementing the health care law, which doesn't take full effect until 2014. That means popular provisions that prohibit insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions and allow parents to keep their children on family policies to the age of 26 will continue.\n\nIn the ruling, the high court decided the most controversial provision--the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance -- is valid as a tax, even though it is impermissible under the Constitution's commerce clause.\n\n\"In this case, however, it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance,\" Chief Justice John Roberts wrote in the majority opinion. \"Such legislation is within Congress's power to tax.\"\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 02:54 PM | Comments (0)\n\nJune 23, 2012\n\nUsing the complaint against your client: Confer right away--like now--with your shop's dorky non-litigators on the 33rd Floor.\n\nLitigation puts a spotlight on things you can fix. Things you can fix now. The opportunities are endless--for both GCs and outside counsel--and you see them in every dispute filed.\n\nTake a look at the last three or four complaints filed against any of your clients. Or, even better, review again that one you just received today. If you are outside counsel, or even inside counsel, and \"do\" litigation, you are presented with all manner of improvements and changes a good client can and should make to its operations right away.\n\nYes, fix it. Like now. A client problem--it will usually fall in the category of \"imperfections\" or \"operational glitches\" rather than wrongdoing or illegality--is sitting there in the complaint right now looking at you.\n\nNow, before the next order is received, before the next shipment is made, before the next employee termination, before you execute the next license agreement, before the next disposal of that residual waste from day-to-day operations, get that problem to someone who can fix it, not litigate it.\n\nBut how many of us--outside counsel, and even GCs in litigation management and oversight--don't say or do anything, or simply put it off, because we think it's not part of our \"litigation\" job?\n\nOr we think it's a problem we'll mention to the polite transactional and tax lawyers down the hall--the ones the client has used to plan and grow for decades--when and if we get around to it? But we never do take action on it. It becomes a well-meaning \"things-to-do\" note made in the excitement of the beginning of a fight.\n\nLitigation often hands you the chance to add long-term value immediately--and solve an operations problem before you finish the barest outline of the Answer or Rule 12 Motion.\n\nExamples: Lame or muddy contract language inherited from a predecessor. Confusing or poorly drafted choice of law or ADR provisions, which always seem to get litigated preliminarily in an expensive opening sideshow that delays focus on the merits. Or waste storage or handling methods which \"comply\"--but just barely--and makes a state or federal agency or private citizen look a little too hard and long at your client's facility next Spring.\n\nMy favorite after terms and conditions in contract language is always this: Bad HR practices, or the repeated \"un-classy\" firing--a termination which is legal but brutal and inartful and will get you sued. You win handily--but fees to obtain summary judgment exceed $100,000.\n\nHow handy is that? At what price glory?\n\nLong-term, you're not hired--as outside counsel or a GC--to have a good defense, or a \"good case\". You are hired to have: (1) no future issue, (2) no investigation (3), no dispute and/or (4) no lawsuit.\n\nThe opportunities are endless--for both GCs and outside counsel--and you see them in every dispute filed.\n\n(from several past posts)\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 01:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nJune 21, 2012\n\nIn San Diego: Kreep v.

For an unusually good explanation of why Americans historically have resisted arbitration and other ADR, see the op-ed piece by Stanford law professor Amalia Kessler entitled \"Stuck in Arbitration\", which appeared earlier this week in the New York Times. Excerpt:\n\nThe standard historical account begins with the Federal Arbitration Act [1925], but the practice of extrajudicial dispute resolution has a much longer history.\n\nMid-19th century Americans across several territories and states â including Florida, California and New York â engaged in a nearly forgotten debate concerning âconciliation courts.â\n\nWidely adopted throughout Europe and its colonies during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, these were institutions composed of respected community leaders seeking to persuade disputants to accept an equitable compromise in secret, lawyer-free proceedings and without regard to the formal rule of law.\n\nDespite the efforts of American proponents of these courts, proposals to establish them went nowhere.\n\nIn the view of their opponents (including businessmen and lawyers), such courts were incompatible with the American commitment to freedom. Adjudication, they successfully insisted, was a vital bulwark of liberty. It enabled individuals to publicly assert their rights as equal citizens under the law.\n\nAs one delegate to the 1846 New York State Constitutional Convention argued, âIn a free country like thisâ â one âwhere every man was the equal of his fellow-manâ â âthere would always be litigation.â\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 12:28 PM | Comments (0)\n\nFebruary 11, 2012\n\nImperfections: They rarely derail the Way Ample.\n\nDon't let anybody tell you that you never want overweight jurors, or that you always want them -- or that you never or always want any other group.

And Canada plans to diversify.\n\nIn a widely-circulated AP article today, Rob Gillies reported that \"with pipeline to US on hold, Canada eyes China\". This development is also likely to become a political issue in the ongoing American presidential campaign. Historically, virtually all of Canada's oil production has gone to the United States. Excerpts:\n\nPrime Minister Stephen Harper says Canada's national interest makes the $5.5 billion pipeline [a non-American one now seriously being discussed in Canada] essential. He was \"profoundly disappointed\" that U.S. President Barack Obama rejected the Texas Keystone XL option but also spoke of the need to diversify Canada's oil industry. Ninety-seven percent of Canadian oil exports now go to the U.S.\n\n\"I think what's happened around the Keystone is a wake-up call, the degree to which we are dependent or possibly held hostage to decisions in the United States, and especially decisions that may be made for very bad political reasons,\" he told Canadian TV.\n\nAlberta has the world's third-largest oil reserves after Saudi Arabia and Venezuela: more than 170 billion barrels. Daily production of 1.5 million barrels from the oil sands is expected to increase to 3.7 million in 2025, which the oil industry sees as a pressing reason to build the pipelines.\n\nMeanwhile, China's growing economy is hungry for Canadian oil. Chinese state-owned companies have invested more than $16 billion in Canadian energy in the past two years, state-controlled Sinopec has a stake in the pipeline, and if it is built, Chinese investment in Alberta oil sands is sure to boom.\n\nPosted by Holden Oliver (KitzbÃ¼hel Desk) at 12:59 AM | Comments (0)\n\nDecember 13, 2011\n\nProperty Rights Dissipate in Keystone State: \"Police Dude, where's my marijuana?\"\n\nA modest proposal.

No surprise to us that fellow Midwesterner Day ended up here. Tennessee is the warrior-breeding Volunteer State. It hatches, and attracts, both brawlers and serious students of war. Record numbers of Tennessee men stepped up to fight in the 1812 and Mexican wars. Alvin York, World War I's most decorated American soldier, came from Pall Mall, near the Kentucky border. Like Texas--the only other semi-straight state so far this century--Tennessee is a Real Man's State.\n\nIn fact, a recent study by the prestigious KitzbÃ¼hel Institute showed that Tennessee male lawyers as an overall group are relatively, well, \"masculine\" compared to practitioners in other jurisdictions. And Volunteer State guy litigators are far less likely than their counterparts in other American states to: (1) move about the office with a sashay; (2) either talk on phone or type with a lisp (alarmingly on rise these days in \"Chicago Land\"--this includes Milwaukee and Indianapolis); or (3) wear their Cartier \"Halo Scroll\" diamond tiaras to work on casual Fridays or Saturday mornings.\n\nAnyway, back to John Day.

And if you represent litigation-savvy corporations, think about advocating early settlement in the context of business-to-business disputes. For those clients, it may be an even easier sell. Excerpts:\n\nIt is not a sign of weakness to try to settle a case early. It doesn't mean that a lawyer views her case as tenuous and has decided to throw in the towel. Nor does it mean that a lawyer is scared of a prominent opposing counsel or the thought of a jury trial. After all, most of us chose litigation for the thrill of trial, not because we are afraid of it. Rather, trying to settle a case early usually is the right thing to do for our clients to save money, time and the psychological commitment of litigation.\n\nThe Rules of Professional Conduct can be read to prescribe an ethical duty to explore early settlement options in litigation. Rule 1.4 directs lawyers to \"reasonably consult\" with a client as to strategies to accomplish the client's objectives. An attorney-client discussion about settlement is a necessary component of any discussion of litigation \"objectives,\" since settlement is the outcome -- if not the express objective -- of most litigation. Rule 2.1 adds that a lawyer's duty to provide independent professional judgment and candid advice should take into account economic facts that may be relevant to the client's situation.\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nJuly 05, 2011\n\n\"Scientific\" Evidence at the Casey Anthony Trial: Come to think of it, it bothered us a little, too.\n\nSee at Deliberations \"The Real Danger from Casey Anthony's Trial: Scary Scientific Evidence\".

Cross-River Gorilla hunting in Western Africa--but with hand guns? By the way, it's not cool to get sued by anyone--even by a bad actor or a duffer. A good, bad, ugly or even very bad American civil law suit from a defense standpoint is expensive, protracted and tough to shut down. No one ever \"wins\". Once it happens, you don't talk about it. Once you're served, you don't tell everyone you meet about it. Talking, writing and venting post-suit hits already-raw nerves, fans fires, generates unneeded \"evidence\", virtually ensures a regime of super-expensive discovery, makes co-defendants turn on each other, and stretches out proceedings and pretrial by-play by months and even years.\n\nPiling On is Low-Rent, Mean-Spirited & Prissy. And Expensive. Move On.\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nMarch 21, 2011\n\nBusiness-to-Business Recession Litigation: Smarter, and Shorter, Battles This Time.\n\nFinality itself is, very often, your client's \"win\".\n\n--Some in-house guy in northern Italy, and others.\n\nLet's indulge in a few law markets stereotypes.\n\nGood times = expansion and deals. Bad times = smaller pies and lawsuits. Generally, it's true. But expect something different in the long run: more arbitration. The world's economic \"new normal\" has already given ADR (alternative dispute resolution) a huge boost.\n\nHowever, I've never bought the idea that ADR generally is \"faster, cheaper and better...\" than court litigation to hear and decide disputes between corporate clients. Faster? Maybe, if you work at it. Cheaper? Maybe, if you work at it. Better result? Maybe, and only if the arbitrator is not afraid to apply the law, and not wimp out and merely \"split the baby\".*\n\nBut arbitration does hold the promises of its promotional cliches. You have to work hard for them, though.\n\nArbitration's main advantages--either in U.S. or abroad? For us, there are three. Only three--so don't buy or drink the promotional Kool-Aid unless you have nothing better to do. First, ADR allows non-U.S. litigants who are parties to deals with ADR clauses to avoid U.S. courts, which are dreaded due to perceived inefficiencies, delays, surprises and unexpected expense, and the very real possibility of awakening The Yankee Vampire: big jury verdicts with punitive damages.\n\nSecond, and more importantly, ADR lets litigants select their own judge or panel of judges. You can often find more skillful, expert and efficient deciders than the government's jurists (i.e., state court judges in America) to hear and decide your dispute. In ADR, those panelists are everything. GCs and their law firms should spend time, money and brainpower selecting them. And even for many disputes around $10 million, you don't need a panel. You just need one \"good\" man or woman. Get it over with. Repose and finality is very often itself a \"win\".\n\nThird, you can write your own procedural rules--or borrow from the many fine sets already out there.\n\nRaphael's \"The Judgment of Solomon\"\n\n*Your client's case is the weaker one? The \"WAF\"--Wimpy (or Wanker, in UK) Arbitrator Factor--usually favors the company with the weaker case. If after your firm's best case development you are stuck with really bad facts and/or bad law--and you can't get back to a court with a jury--consider identifying wankers on the Arbitrator List, and manipulating opponents into picking the \"least objectionable wanker\" for your client.\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nMarch 11, 2011\n\nWho says popular election of state judges is \"Fishy\"?\n\nHow rude. Not giving money to sitting judges and would-be judges for their campaigns? Next thing you know, lawyers will no longer be the main event--with clients calling some of the shots. See at Choose Judges on Merit, a site by the \"renegade\" Pennsylvanians for Modern Courts, these two gems: Jukebox Justice and Electing Judges is 'Fishy'. But whoa there, PMC. Without lawyers writing those campaign checks, only honest and highly-qualified jurists will want to have anything to do with state courts. There'd be a merit system that hatches all these boring smart ex-lawyers who as law students made Law Review and Coif and as kids couldn't get elected Junior High Student Council Treasurer if they'd passed out free beer, airplane glue and cheerleaders as party favors.

GE's Michael McIlwrath and King and Spalding's John Savage prepared International Arbitration and Mediation: A Practical Guide for counsel who regularly advise and guide businesses when they negotiate international deals. Kluwer Law International, 528 pages.\n\nPosted by Holden Oliver (KitzbÃ¼hel Desk) at 12:59 AM | Comments (0)\n\nJanuary 17, 2011\n\nMy American States: Dudes, Where's My Merit-Based Judge Selection?\n\nYes--it's the same basic article we always run. Get used to it.\n\nSocially, we are pretty liberal on these folks. No really. Three or four of our firm's friends are elected state judges, or ex-state judges.\n\nWe still say hello to them in public--and once even had one to dinner. We would probably not object too terribly strongly if one of our sisters, brothers, sons or daughters very very briefly dated one, probably.\n\nStates: Can You Get Off Your Knees, Please? Look, maybe think of it like this: Good Crops, Motherhood, the Flag, Andy Griffith, puppies, selflessness, courage, Beauty, Truth, a thin Marie Osmond, a really good-looking Eleanor Roosevelt, Sweetness, Light, and replacing state judicial elections with merit-based selection in 39 American states.\n\nLet's be clear. Popular election of state judges is beneath: (a) you, (b) your law firm, (c) your family's dog, and (d) your business clients, and especially if you act for businesses who trade nationally or globally. That institution, favored in a majority of states in some form, makes states that still conduct them appear insular and potentially unfair to both American litigants and to non-Americans and their businesses abroad.\n\nWith each election cycle campaign donations are driving up the costs. This is, of course, wasteful and inefficient. See \"The New Politics of Judicial Elections in the Great Lakes States, 2000â2008\" by Justice at Stake. More importantly, the very existence of state laws regulating campaign contributions to candidates running for judicial office send two unintended but lousy messages:\n\n1. Judges, like mayors and congressmen, have \"constituents\".\n\n2. Justice, like real estate or widgets, is \"for sale\".\n\nWe appreciate that many of the some 10,000 elected American judges were excellent lawyers, and that as jurists they do first-rate, honest, exemplary, and often inspiring work. We have indeed stayed loose and open-minded on this subject.\n\nIn fact, 3 or 4 of our firm's friends are elected state judges--or ex-state judges. (Hull even dated one for until she turned 35.) We are gracious. We say hello to them in public--and once even had one to dinner. We would probably not object too strongly if one of our sons or daughters very briefly dated one. But elected benches are by nature glaringly \"fishy\" to even the most casual observer and especially, it seems to us, in the Midwest and South, and wherever else American Horse Sense abounds.\n\nMerit-based selection, of course, is not perfect. However, it has worked very well for two centuries in American federal courts with a minimum of bad appointments and embarrassments--even if you adjust for the fact that state judges outnumber federal judges (who are appointed for life) by a factor of over 10 to 1. Last year, we followed the U.S. Supreme Court case about a popularly elected state supreme court judge, and campaign money recipient, who failed to disqualify himself in arguably suspect circumstances. In Caperton v. Massey Coal Company (June 8, 2009), the Supreme Court ruled that a West Virginia judge should indeed have disqualified himself from hearing an appeal of a $50 million jury verdict against an a coal company because its CEO had been a major campaign donor.\n\nJudges should not have \"constituents\"--i.e. law firms, and their clients, who make campaign contributions. Right now, in most American states, they do. And there is no way to dress that up. Generally county-based, American litigation at a state level is already frustratingly local and provincial for \"outsider defendants\"--businesses from other U.S. states and other nations sued in local state courts--who cannot remove to federal courts, the forums where federal judges can and should protect them from local prejudice.* American states that still hang on to electoral systems look increasingly provincial, classless, and silly from a global perspective. It's time for the States to grow up, and adopt systems of merit-based appointment.\n\n*One reason that federal diversity jurisdiction was created in the first place was because of the Framersâ concern that prejudices of state judges toward out-of-state persons would unfairly affect outcomes in trial courts. Erwin Griswold, Law and Lawyers in the United States, 65 (Cambridge, Harv. Press 1964). Over 200 years later, our current systems in the states make that local prejudice almost inevitable.

But we are so heavily invested in it, and so used to it, that we are even incapable of experiencing the \"oh-my-god\" embarrassment it ought to cause every day those state systems continue to exist. Our national denial is still in concrete.\n\nWe've mentioned Tocqueville before. If he were alive today, we had argued, Alexis de Tocqueville might very well \"like\" George W. Bush--as his exemplary American, warts and all. The younger Bush as president for 8 years--or anything he did or didn't do--would not have surprised or disturbed the famously prescient Tocqueville. In fact, it would have all made perfect sense to him.\n\nBut Tocqueville would be appalled to learn that a majority of the American states still have some form of popular election of judges.\n\nThe young French author who toured America in 1831 noted that some American states already were in the process of reducing the power and independence of the state judiciary through certain \"innovations\", and it disturbed him. One was the state legislatures' ability to recall judges. And another:\n\nSome other state constitutions make the members of the judiciary elective, and they are even subjected to frequent re-elections. I venture to predict that these innovations will sooner or later be attended with fatal consequences; and that it will be found out at some future period that by thus lessening the independence of the judiciary they have attacked not only the judicial power, but the democratic republic itself.\n\nfrom Democracy in America, Vol. I, Part 2, Ch. 8 (Tocqueville's emphasis in some translations).\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nDecember 07, 2010\n\nAccelerated Global Arbitration Rules: A Curb on Madness.\n\nCPR's are barely 15 months old. Global. Commerical. Agile. Mobile. Flexible. Deliberately Hostile to making attorneys the main event. Aggressive. We are all free to use them to conduct arbitrations as they were originally intended to be conducted--and \"get it done\". Make closure a priority--and even a success. Puts the arm on lawyer wankfests. No, you won't starve. Tell your clients about them. Get them in contract clauses. See \"Global Rules For Accelerated Commercial Arbitration (effective August 20, 2009)\" by the NYC-based CPR Institute. They are custom-built for higher stakes disputes arising under business-to-business contracts. Best two features: (1) The default position is a sole (one) arbitrator. (2) Arbitrators should make award ASAP and in any event within six months of formation of the tribunal.\n\nPosted by Holden Oliver (KitzbÃ¼hel Desk) at 11:59 PM | Comments (0)\n\nAt Above The Law: \"Overseeing International Litigation\".\n\nSee Mark Herrmann's Inside Straight column yesterday at Above The Law. Excerpts:\n\nThis has been fascinating (to me, at least, but I realize Iâm a little odd) in several ways. I never before focused on what a U.S.-centric litigation life I had been living. Thereâs a brave new world out there, and Iâd never given it a momentâs thought.\n\nMy standard litany hardly turns me into an expert in, say, Sudanese civil procedure, but my few questions are enough to elicit the general lay of the land. Itâs also surprising to see that, so long as the judiciary is honest, itâs possible to participate in basically any type of judicial proceeding and be generally comfortable with the process.\n\n[S]uppose opposing counsel in Sudan threatens my client (or my local counsel) with criminal proceedings to try to coerce settlement of a civil case. If thatâs the way people litigate in Sudan, can I tell my local counsel to retaliate by threatening to initiate criminal proceedings of our own? Or am I constrained by American rules of propriety even when Iâm playing in a Sudanese sandbox?\n\nPosted by JD Hull at 11:40 PM | Comments (0)\n\nDecember 03, 2010\n\nTrials: McElhaney on Not Digging Holes.\n\nArgue to the judgeânot with the judge.\n\nIn this month's ABA Journal, Jim McElhaney gives us \"Keeping Out of a Hole: Itâs a Lot Easier to Avoid Problems Than to Fix Them\".

Non-U.S. clients are also wary of jurisdictions that still elect state judges.\n\nIf you have Europe-based clients, you already know that in-house lawyers across the Atlantic do not like to have their company's commercial disputes heard and decided by American courts (even by our most efficient and respected U.S. district courts). Their reasons, however, turn on more than the obvious and commonly-given ones: lengthy and expensive proceedings, juries hearing civil disputes, and the fear of large damages awards, including punitive damages. Another reason is the perception abroad of the extraordinary \"localism\" (generally county-based) of judges and juries in the state systems. Still another is the effect that contingency fee arrangements can have on the litigation process. There are more reasons--and every one of them can be troubling to both non-U.S. and American in-house lawyers.\n\nAt the podcast series of the International Institute for Conflict Prevention & Resolution (CPR), do not miss the interview by Mike McIlwrath, an in-house lawyer with General Electric in Europe, of Geoffrey C.

Episode II of McIlwrath-Kirby IDN Interview.\n\nHave you ever gone back and reviewed your firm's bill to a client to determine the fees on your end to select a panel of three arbitrators? How much was that? How long did it take?\n\nWas having three arbitrators important to the client? And was it worth it?\n\nPart II: Is one arbitrator enough? And if there's more than one, how do you spot a \"wine\" arbitrator on the panel? In June we featured Part I of Mike McIlwrath's interview with Jennifer Kirby, former Deputy Secretary General of the ICC's Court of International Arbitration in Paris.

How does a mediator or arbitrator arrive at a true--and fair--consensus on the meaning of ordinary verbal and non-verbal conduct by a witness? What is the significance of the \"delayed answer\" to a question? In one culture, delay means hesitancy and evasiveness (e.g., to most Westerners). In another, delay may denote careful consideration of the question--and a sign of respect to the questioner.\n\nIn 2009, GE's in-house counsel Mike McIlwrath interviewed Australian mediator Joanna Kalowski, who works out of both Australia and Paris. Kalowski discusses how she became a mediator and lessons that come directly from her work. She has also trained mediators in Australia, New Zealand, India, Singapore, Italy, Thailand and Hong Kong.

Clients have had good reason over the years to disbelieve promises by law firms to restore arbitration to its original goals of faster-cheaper-better. Almost none of them were kept. Litigation is a money-maker, and larger firms, boutiques and other Western law shops with higher-end corporate clients have too much riding on the fees. But some observers think that New York City-based Debevoise & Plimpton, with 650 lawyers in US, Europe and Asia, still may have done the right, sane and smart thing by developing and announcing its \"Debevoise Protocol to Promote Efficiency in International Arbitration\" (April 2010). Do see, by GE's Mike McIlwrath, an in-house oil and gas litigation lawyer based in Florence, Italy, this article: \"Faster, Cheaper: Global Initiatives to Promote Efficiency in International Arbitration\", reprinted from 76 Arbitration 568â570 (2010).

If you view Western Pennsylvania as an obtuse, unoriginal and sleepy commercial backwater--an insular ex-steel region where execs from a tiny white male master class daily bark orders to lower castes before hitting the links--please think again. You're 40 years behind.\n\nDo see \"In re ESI: Local Rules Enhance Value of Rule 26(f) 'Meet & Confer' \" by Joy Flowers Conti, a well-regarded U.S. district court judge, and Pittsburgh lawyer Richard Lettieri. The article appeared in the ABA's The Judgesâ Journal, Volume 49, Number 2, Spring 2010. Ironically, most commercial trial lawyers who focus on federal courts know much less about electronically-stored information (\"ESI\"--routine e-mail, mainly) than they should. Whether you do litigation or transactional work, and especially if your client reps are in-house people or GCs, you'd better know lots.\n\nJudge Conti, and Lettieri, who spent nearly two decades with Big Blue, do know more. Many of the lessons of the Conti-Lettieri article, we might add, are preventative and preemptive for non-litigators. Again, get your transactional people involved. All business lawyers need to get smarter on (1) ESI, (2) Rule 26, Fed. R. Civ. (a short but storied and common sense rule governing discovery generally) and (3) all federal local rules that tweak Rule 26. All three.\n\nIt's an important area whether you defend cases against corporations or not. If you represent plaintiffs, of course, you will read it with interest to further your nefarious agendas against Corporate Personhood, Motherhood, Good Crops, and Stock Options. We are watching you guys.\n\nFinally, you may want to take time out to learn about ESI and discovery. If you do, see along with the Conti-Lettieri piece: (1) Fed. R. Civ. P. 26--\"Duty to Disclose; General Provisions Governing Discovery\", (2) its 45 years of Advisory Committee Notes, and (3) the fine work and thinking reflected, and discussed in the article, in W.D.
