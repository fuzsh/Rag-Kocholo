The Sperrins have had quite a snowstorm.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/snow-on-the-glenshane-4925\n\nSnow Cuts Off a Transmitter\n\n02min 55sec\n\n1965\n\nAn Independent Television Authority transmitter in Ballyclare is one of the casualties of a snowstorm as it’s cut off from the outside world.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/snow-cuts-off-a-transmitter-4282\n\nSnowy Scenes in 1950s East Belfast\n\n57sec\n\n1950s\n\nShort film by Samuel Bracegirdle, showing the snowy streets and hills of 1950s Belfast.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/snowy-scenes-in-1950s-east-belfast-5663\n\nBig Freeze Airlifts\n\n04min 02sec\n\n1963\n\nThe Big Freeze of early 1963 saw life across much of the British Isles come to a standstill as roads were blocked by snow and ice for many weeks. This footage shows the process of helping stranded communities gain essential supplies with airlift often being the only workable solution, including, as in this footage, airlifting bales of straws for animals on farms.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/big-freeze-airlifts-6134\n\nA Flu Outbreak in Northern Ireland,\n\n04min 03sec\n\n1966\n\nA flu outbreak has hit Northern Ireland. Jimmy Robinson talks to some people trying to deal with the issue. A doctor at Belfast City Hospital tells of staff shortages due to illness. Some beds have had to be moved around. Chemist Harry Boyd on the Ormeau Road says there have been some shortages of medicine. Dr Mahoney in Knock has been busier than normal but plays down talk of an epidemic. He offers advice on how to deal with the flu.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/a-flu-outbreak-in-northern-ireland-5047\n\nDonegal Railways Closures\n\n03min 07sec\n\n1961\n\nCo Donegal in the Republic of Ireland at one time had an extensive rail network linking up with lines in Northern Ireland. By the 1950s it had been largely dismantled and by 1960 it was completely gone. This mute UTV film is dated to 1961 but is more likely from 1959 or 1960 as it shows the line still in operation. We see steam trains in operation passing through stations such as Killygordon in the Republic and Strabane CDR (adjacent to the Strabane GNR station), both of which closed in January 1960.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/donegal-railways-closures-6009\n\nNew Year's Resolution? Look fine for '89!\n\n01min 22sec\n\n1988\n\nChristmas is for mulling wine, not mulling over resolutions. However, the beginning of a new year is the perfect opportunity to start forming healthy habits. This report details the Eastern Health Board's rollout of the World Health Organisation's Healthy City Campaign. The Board used brightly coloured advertisements to attract attention to the drive. The Belfast public volunteer their opinions on the initiative and the ads.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/new-years-resolution-look-fine-for-6313\n\nA Leap Year Birthday\n\n01min 27sec\n\n1964\n\nIt’s a leap year and Jimmy Robinson investigates any weddings and birthdays. Susan Bell of Glenlola Collegiate in Bangor is a Leap Year baby but it doesn’t bother her too much.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/a-leap-year-birthday-3831\n\nLeap Day Weddings and Babies\n\n51sec\n\n1964\n\nIt’s a Leap Year so footage of weddings on the day and all the Leap Year babies. At least remembering your anniversary shouldn’t be an issue.\n\nThe wedding takes place at Lisburn Cathedral and the babies were born at Belfast City Hospital.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/leap-day-weddings-and-babies-3982\n\nThe UTV Staff Sing White Christmas 04min 16sec\n\n1984\n\nEamonn Holmes introduces this humorous festive piece for Good Evening Ulster on UTV. Highlighting that 'White Christmas' is the most famous Christmas song of all, he goes out onto the streets of Belfast getting the public to sing a line each, which was then edited together into a unique rendition.\n\nPerhaps unfortunately, the UTV celebrities also get in on the act, with presenters such as Gerry Kelly and Jackie Fullerton contributing. Barry McGuigan, decked out in a Santa suit, asks if the referee can stop them from further punishment.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/the-utv-staff-sing-white-christmas-5901\n\nKeep Your Christmas Tree Looking Fresh!\n\n04min 47sec\n\n1984\n\nKate Smith visits a garden centre to learn about the traditions behind some of the plants and foliage we use to decorate our homes during Christmas.

Some little ones munch on sweets they got as gifts. The nurses sing 'Oh Come All Ye Faithful', 'Once in Royal David's City' and 'Hymn for Christmas Day' as they walk around the wards carrying laterns and bringing some of the children with them.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/nurses-singing-christmas-carols-at-lissue-3156\n\nChristmas Preparations, 1965\n\n02min 19sec\n\n1965\n\nChristmas preparations are well underway in Belfast. The postmen are busy and everyone is down at George’s Market buying their turkeys. The traditional holly is also on sale. The shops are packed with people.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/christmas-preparations-1965-4973\n\nPanto Time at the Grand Opera House\n\n04min 42sec\n\n1964\n\nRehearsals are on for the pantomime at the Grand Opera House. This year it’s Cinderella and the main actors introduce themselves. Adrienne McGuill is playing Dandini. The producer was Stanley Page who talks to Jimmy Greene about the panto.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/panto-time-at-the-grand-opera-4001\n\nThis is Christmas in Belfast City\n\n02min 28sec\n\n2021\n\n\"The Echoes from the Archive programme allowed me to delve into Belfast’s history. The footage that I chose showing Belfast City Centre during Christmas in the 1960s was quite special to me. Watching the swarm of people in the city, the high street and Belfast’s Christmas tree was reminiscent of my own childhood growing up in Belfast. I like how that sense of busyness of the city has always been there. This programme has enabled me to connect more with home.\" Text by Amy McCloy\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/this-is-christmas-in-belfast-city-5448\n\nPre-Ski Training\n\n06min 58sec\n\n1963\n\nJust as the 1960s saw a surge in package holidays to sunny climes on the continent, so there was a corresponding increase in those taking up winter holidays, particularly for skiing. Previously a pastime of the rich, alpine skiing holidays suddenly became affordable to a greater number of people and by the late 1970s and early 1980s it was even common for schools to offer skiing trips for pupils. This UTV report drops in on a Norwegian ski instructor who is teaching other prospective ski instructors, who in turn will teach the novice skier. He was confident that by training first timers before they arrived on the slopes they could save two or three days during which they could be enjoying the swish of their skis going downhill instead of tumbling over.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/preski-training-6182\n\nMcGilloway's Way: A Winter's Tale\n\n25min 23sec\n\n1990\n\nOliver McGilloway present's McGilloway's Way, a programme which celebrates the dramatic and beautiful landscapes surrounding Ulster.\n\nThis episode is set during the depths of winter when snow is laying on the ground and the seas are rough. McGilloway chats about the changes in the weather compared to past winters and even the waves seem \"to be more furious in recent times\" and this is due to global warming \"where there are more carbon dioxide gasses in the air and that only increases in the wildness of these winds\".\n\nNext, it's over to a farm to discuss sheep farming and the potential disappointments it may hold. However, it's not all doom and gloom with newborn lambs prancing in the snow!\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/mcgilloways-way-a-winters-tale-3307\n\nBuzz Lightyear: to Christmas and Beyond!\n\n02min 40sec\n\n1966\n\nThe must-have toy of 1995 was Buzz Lightyear. The Space Ranger was one of the main characters from Pixar's 1995 film Toy Story.\n\nWhen the Christmas season rolled around, Buzz action figures fell off the shelves with style. Parents struggled to find the toy anywhere. Even Santa was affected by the shortage. In this report, UTV's Jeanie Johnson travels to Belfast's Disney Store to find out how Mickey's Belfast Team is preparing for the festive season.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/buzz-lightyear-to-christmas-and-beyond-6284\n\nDean Sammy Crooks, aka Black Santa, outside St Anne's Cathedral\n\n02min 55sec\n\n1983\n\nDean Sammy Crooks, the first Black Santa was known as a person of determined character who would unapologetically approach people for money and, as a result, he was responsible for raising large sums for the cathedral, for overseas disaster appeals and, as has become a mark of the Christmas sit-out, vital contributions to local charities.\n\nIn this short news report, Black Santa is seen in action outside St Anne’s Cathedral, Belfast.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/dean-sammy-crooks-aka-black-santa-2191\n\nIce Skating at Dundonald Ice Bowl\n\n17min 33sec\n\n1988\n\nBehind the scenes look at the Nicky Slater skating show with interviews by Jacqui Berkley.\n\nFeatures local children practicing their group routine, British pair champions discussing how long they've skated and creator of the show Nicky chatting about the reception they've received in Belfast and around the country.\n\nFootage ends with Kurt Browning on the ice - just back from the 1988 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary - where Browning landed the first ratified quadruple jump!\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/ice-skating-at-dundonald-ice-bowl-2665\n\nMoulton Bicycle\n\n41sec\n\n1963\n\nA short silent piece of footage filmed around Belfast of a lady taking her new Moulton design bicycle for a ride. Designed by Alex Moulton it was considered at the time the first major innovation in bicycle design since the 1880s and did away with the traditional diamond frame, bringing in what was called the F-Frame, which he considered easier to mount for people who were less physically able. It sold extremely well and became an iconic design of the 1960s.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/moulton-bicycle-6117\n\nSugar Beet Harvesting in Moneymore\n\n01min 38sec\n\n1963\n\nShort footage of farm workers following a tractor as it harvested sugar beets from the fields in the Moneymore area.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/sugar-beet-harvesting-in-moneymore-6147\n\nNorthern Ireland Honey\n\n08min 54sec\n\n1963\n\nA report on the manufacture of honey at the Northern Ireland Honey company. We are shown the bees collecting pollen from nearby apple blossom, work being carried out to collect sheets of honeycomb from the hives, and then the honey being treated in machines. At the end of the process is a member of staff proudly adding the company labels to full glass jars of local honey.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/northern-ireland-honey-6118\n\nAround Portaferry\n\n03min 21sec\n\n1962\n\nUlster Television excelled in the early 1960s at filming reports from around the country to give an insight into life outside of Belfast. Although there is no surviving sound for this report from Portaferry on the Ards Peninsula in Co Down, it still acts as an important snapshot of life in the town at this time. Of special note is the journey across to Strangford. This was before the car ferry came into service and this important route was travelled in a small open boat. Film fans will even notice the long gone Portaferry cinema and, by magnifying the film poster on its front, we can see that the British comedy School for Scoundrels was showing at the time.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/around-portaferry-1962-6036\n\nNewcastle Lifeboat\n\n02min 01sec\n\n1961\n\nThe Newcastle lifeboat is one of the oldest in Ireland, having been established in 1825. This short film shows it in action going out to sea and being winched back to its station.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/newcastle-lifeboat-6005\n\nCopeland Island Bird Observatory\n\n05min 32sec\n\n1962\n\nThe Copeland Islands are situated a short distance from the mainland of Northern Ireland opposite the harbour of Donaghadee in Co Down. Very sparsely populated, they have few claims to fame. One is that they staged a naval battle as part of the American War of Independence, another is their lighthouse on Mew Island, and another is that the remains of a previous lightkeeper’s residence on Lighthouse Island have been rebuilt into a bird observatory, which is still in use today. The islands are an important breeding ground for several types of gull, terns and eider. Sadly, the sound of this interesting piece on the work carried out there no longer exists but birdwatchers and appreciators of island life will still find much to be fascinated by.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/copeland-island-bird-observatory-6029\n\nLouis Armstrong Arrives in Belfast\n\n02min 17sec\n\n1962\n\nSatchmo the Great, a film about the world-famous jazz musician Louis Armstrong, had just played in Belfast in March 1962, to help with the student rag fundraising at Queen’s University, when the great man himself was persuaded to come and play in person the following month. Armstrong and his wife were given a New Orleans-flavoured march upon arrival at Nutts Corner airport, all the way up to the waiting UTV camera Crew where this interview was conducted. His concert would take place at the King’s Hall in Belfast on 25 April 1962.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/louis-armstrong-arrives-in-belfast-6050\n\nFoster’s Ballroom in Belfast\n\n01min 53sec\n\n1960\n\nSituated on the Lisburn Road in Belfast, Foster’s Ballroom was a popular venue in the glory days of dancehalls. This film, with added music soundtrack, captures a night in which the ballroom rolled back the years to put on a night of 1920s-themed music and costumes. A fleet of vintage cars delivered the revellers to the hall and the slightly sped-up film completes the illusion of the 1920s as the costumed dancers prepare to Charleston the night away.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/fosters-ballroom-in-belfast-5961\n\nBagpipe Making in Dromore\n\n03min 31sec\n\n1962\n\nAdrienne McGuill was best known as the host of the children’s show Romper Room on UTV, but she was also a roving reporter for the nightly news. In this report she visited the Co Down town of Dromore to interview John Magill who had been making bagpipes for over fifty years, as well as playing them himself for almost seventy.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/bagpipe-making-in-dromore-6052\n\nAlexander Irvine’s House in Pogue’s Entry\n\n02min 09sec\n\n1963\n\nA report by James Greene from Pogue’s Entry in Antrim town, the birthplace of the celebrated Ulster author Dr Alexander Irvine and made famous in his book My Lady of the Chimney Corner. It had fallen into disrepair over the years but the report showed that plans were afoot to restore it and a member of the Tourist Board is seen cutting the first sod for a new centre devoted to Irvine.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/alexander-irvines-house-in-pogues-entry-6131\n\nMaintenance of Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge\n\n01min 02sec\n\n1963\n\nA team of four men set off purposefully in this short film as they stride out across the famous Carrick-a-Rede rope bridge to make sure it is safe for another year, tending to the rope with a fearlessness for the drop to the sea below.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/maintenance-of-carrickarede-rope-bridge-6127\n\nChecking the Tilt of Belfast’s Albert Memorial Clock\n\n03min 35sec\n\n1962\n\nA fascinating film looking at the work undertaken to measure the tilt of the Albert Memorial Clock at the end of High Street in Belfast. Built in 1869, on what turned out to be not entirely stable ground, the clock tower became famous as Belfast’s answer to the Leaning Tower of Pisa. Although work has been completed to stabilise the tower today, at the time the film was made it was continuing to slant and the measurements were important to find out if the rate of subsidence posed a danger to the structure.\n\nThe film also presents a rare opportunity to see up inside the clock tower and view its internal workings. Watch out though if you have a fear of heights!\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/checking-the-tilt-of-belfasts-albert-6066\n\nDo You Dare to Ride the Downpatrick Train of Terror? 02min 12sec\n\n1989\n\nRonan Kelly takes the Ghost Train to Downpatrick on Halloween. The train alights at a disused train platform where George the Ghost awaits to haunt the passengers. Merlin the Magician also makes an appearance. Do you dare to go on the ghost train?\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/do-you-dare-to-ride-the-5900\n\nArmagh Graveyard Tales\n\n03min 27sec\n\n1961\n\nIn this film, Charlie Witherspoon reported for UTV from the city of Armagh where he visited both the Protestant and Catholic cathedrals to tell two stories connected to their graveyards.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/armagh-graveyard-tales-5997\n\nKillymoon Castle, Cookstown\n\n01min 22sec\n\n1960\n\nFilm of Killymoon Castle in Cookstown, Co Tyrone. These silent shots show the beautiful ceilings, stairways and stained-glass windows of the castle which was built in its current form in 1803.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/killymoon-castle-cookstown-5995\n\nClog Making in Newtownards\n\n05min 28sec\n\n1960\n\nFootage showing the traditional craft of making wooden clogs. Two veteran cobblers are shown adding the leather uppers to the wooden soles and nailing and hammering them into place. The clogs are then shown being sold and wrapped in brown paper and string at the Edgar’s shoe shop in Newtownards, Co Down.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/clog-making-in-newtownards-5977\n\nLace-Making in Crossmaglen\n\n06min 26sec\n\n1961\n\nIn this film, Ulster Television’s Charlie Witherspoon visits the town of Crossmaglen in Co Armagh to look in on the craft of lace-making. The local speciality was Carrickmacross lace, a form of ornate, hand-stitched lace with its origins in Italy. The film shows how the skills required for the craft had been put on the curriculum for Crossmaglen Technical School and Witherspoon talks to both the principle and teacher of the class. Inside the school, he watches a class of eighteen girls engaged in learning the skills and he speaks to them afterwards about whether a reasonable wage is possible from producing lace products.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/lacemaking-in-crossmaglen-5996\n\nCaravan Making in Cookstown Part 1\n\n06min 29sec\n\n1960\n\nA film showing the work of Mr Hamilton of Cookstown who specialised in making traditional caravans for the travelling community. As well as setting fire to the metal rims for the wooden wheels as he hammers them into place we see him in his workshop constructing the frame of the actual caravan.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/caravan-making-in-cookstown-part-1-5979\n\nJames Simmons - Spectrum\n\n02min 54sec\n\n1985\n\nA glimpse of the writer James Simmons performing his poem 'The Pleasant Joys of Brotherhood' to the tune of 'My Lagan 'Love', before reading an excerpt from another of his works about the harvest. Final scenes see him typing at his desk and walking away.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/james-simmons-spectrum-insert-2933\n\nA Silent War: Interview with Tory Campbell (Sakura)\n\n05min 34sec\n\n2021\n\nWriter Tory Campbell talks about collaborating with Ross Thompson on A Silent War.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/a-silent-war-interview-with-tory-5778\n\nAn Interview with Sam Cree\n\n03min 14sec\n\n1966\n\nPlaywright Sam Cree heads to Hollywood to sign a contract for his play Cupid Wore Skirts to become a movie.\n\nSam Cree began his writing career with Jimmy Young and went on to write many plays and films, including many Carry On films. His plays are performed regularly still.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/an-interview-with-sam-cree-5014\n\nIf Stones Could Speake: A History of The Honourable the Irish Society\n\n17min 42sec\n\n1994\n\nThis short documentary was created by Vinny Cunningham for the Tower Museum about The Honourable the Irish Society. The Society has a central role in the history of the city. Created in 1609 and incorporated in 1613 by royal charter of James I, the society funded the construction of their home city’s famous walls and the Guild Hall.\n\nThis documentary details The Honourable the Irish Society’s history as an organisation for the planting of Ulster and its transformation into its current function as a charitable body.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/if-stones-could-speake-a-history-5822\n\nStories of Kiltierney Deer Park and Ardess Church and Graveyard\n\n28min 48sec\n\n2023\n\nKiltierney is a privately-owned farm with a rich heritage that dates to 100BC.\n\nOnce a deer enclosure and important food store for Plantation landlords, the present-day owner Noel Graham farms this part of Fermanagh with an appreciation for the stories that lie behind the Deer Park walls.\n\nThrough this short film you will learn a little about this special place and hear about its history through the pre-historic, medieval, Plantation and World War II periods.\n\nThe film also introduces the viewer to Ardess Church of Ireland and graveyard, one of Fermanagh's oldest Christian sites with a wonderful and respectful story to tell about the church and its connection to Kiltierney Deer Park, its Plantation history and the Famine grave and its respectful restoration.\n\nThis film is presented by the Courthouse Kesh Ltd, supported by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds through the Lough Erne Landscape Partnership and funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/stories-of-kiltierney-deer-park-and-5941\n\nElena Binnig - The Big House\n\n03min 23sec\n\n2023\n\nA big house but empty inside?\n\nThe short film explores the places that used to be called asylums or mental hospitals in the past but now remain empty and are slowly decaying.

Armagh is the ecclesiastical capital of Ireland, with the famous for St Patrick's Cathedral found within the city. Undoubtably, the county has benefitted from the waters of Lough Neagh and has created an environment which is well suited for plant growth.\n\nThe footage begins with the owner of a large apple orchard, Peadar MacNeice, showing McGilloway around his orchard - which was originally planted in 1865 by his ancestor. MacNeice touches on modern approaches to orchards, though the focus is on the traditional, with the original orchard centred around a well. Apple trees found within the orchard range from the Golden Noble to the Norfolk Royal, with the latter taking twelve years before the plant bears fruit, due to the branch needing to hang down.\n\nFollowing this is an interview with Donald Whiteside at Gosford Forest. Here, the viewer is told about the squirrels are commonly found in the forest. However, in comparison to the multitude of grey squirrels, there are only five pairs of red squirrels known to inhabit the forest. Therefore, grey squirrels are controlled in forest parks, as they have a detrimental effect on the surrounding habitat, damaging hardwood trees for their sweet sap and eating nuts from the trees before they are ripe, thereby taking a food source away from the red squirrel. Also featured in the programme is an informal chat with local wildlife enthusiast Melvyn Willis, who sells in his shop several gadgets to attract both birds and foxes.\n\nWrapping up the episode is Richard Sterritt who talks the audience through the process of preparing a goat's coat, to make it ready for a Lambeg drum - a process which is 'steeped in heritage and folklore'.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/mcgilloways-way-the-orchard-county-2505\n\nPhil Kieran: Last Words\n\n03min 06sec\n\n2023\n\nThis film was created by Tori Clarkson.

He was in the area to visit the collection of old bicycles maintained by the Meharg brothers. As well as the penny farthing, Witherspoon also took to the roads on a bizarre tandem bicycle, where the two riders sit side by side rather than behind each other. He also grappled with another primitive early bicycle utilising a rather awkward steering wheel instead of handlebars. Witherspoon was always good value in these location reports and his face as he struggles with these forgotten wrong turns in the history of cycling is quite a picture.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/old-bicycles-5885\n\nThe Changing Face of Irish Transport: From Horse-Drawn Trams to Trains\n\n21min 39sec\n\n1954\n\nA.

Jacqui chats to three women who have each tried a different brand of fake tan (on just their right leg). Comparing and contrasting the outcomes, the conclusion is drawn that highest price doesn't necessarily equate to best results!\n\nNext up, Check It Out Producer Jamie Delargy takes a swimming lesson with instructor Eddie Officer.

Through the use of photographs, home videos and interviews with the man himself, we start to understand Leo's multifaceted identity and how embedded Leo is in both the Italian and Northern Irish communities and cultures.\n\nThe story starts with Leo's grandparents eloping to Belfast. However, they never fully settled and moved back to Italy after a few short months and it was there that they raised their children, including Leo's mother. Leo's mother and father were from neighbouring villages, Casalvieri and Casalattico. They wed in their thirties, however, due to a lack of work in the area, they had little choice but to migrate. They passed through various places in North America before eventually settling in Belfast, finding themselves amidst the growing Italian community that had taken root in the city. This community, based predominantly on York Street and the Crumlin Road, was often referred to as 'Little Italy' at the time.\n\nLeo relates the challenges he faced in assimilating to Northern Irish society, going to an English speaking school but coming home and being surrounded by those who spoke primarily, or exclusively Italian. He also describes how his familiarity with, and appreciation of, the Italian culture grew each time he journeyed back to his parents' hometowns.\n\nAlso featured in the programme, interviews with two Italian natives, now living in Belfast, who share their thoughts on how they've integrated into the local society.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/homelands-to-townlands-italian-2555\n\nMulticultural Festival\n\n21min 42sec\n\n2001\n\nCelebrating the multitude of cultures which Northern Ireland has, the footage catches the journey from the City Hall to St Georges Market, with dancing, music and costumes!\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/multicultural-festival-4244\n\nBoat Trip to Rathlin\n\n03min 27sec\n\ncirca 1957\n\nTravel across the Sea of Moyle towards the island that sheltered Robert the Bruce in 1306.\n\nLeave the gently bobbing raft, board the Rathlin boat and begin the 6-mile journey across the choppy straits of Moyle.

There however, is some sobering evidence of the Great Famine, with potato ridges still seen in the hills today.\n\nNext, McGilloway explores the woodland, where the floor is \"like an oasis\" with its multitude of organisms, which is only possible due to the small slither of light that comes through. But, even on the sunniest of days you would need a torch to see clearly in amongst the densely packed trees!\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/mcgilloways-way-hidden-tyrone-3322\n\nTake Ten: The History Man\n\n11min 55sec\n\n1987\n\nJamie Delargy meets Jonathan Bardon, a historian and educator, who moved from Dublin to Belfast in the 1960’s and developed a strong interest in the history of the city and a passion for making history of Belfast alive for its citizens.\n\nJamie joins Jonathan on a tour of Belfast’s history as they visit a linen factory, explore the Georgian terrace of Joy Street and stop by the popular Crown Bar for a bit of ‘opulence and flamboyance’.

Initially critics were unsure how safe these craft would be, Time magazine’s Dan Neil described it as, “A vehicle that promised to revolutionise drowning”, according to him, “Its flotation was entirely dependent on whether the bilge pump could keep up with the leakage.” Nonetheless, between 1961 – when they were first produced for public purchase – and 1965 some 4,000 Amphicars were manufactured. Remarkably some 700 remain in existence. Major Brownlow purchased his Amphicar so that he could visit his dog kennels which were on the other side of the Lough from his estate. He spotted the vehicle in 1963 and, before buying it, tested the vehicle in the Thames. It served him well for the next five years, until he persuaded the local authority to run a car ferry.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/amphicar-2613\n\nScenes of Derry City,\n\n1965\n\n02min 50sec\n\nScenes of Derry city centre with views of Duke Street and John Street.

The sumptuous harvest feast, replete with delicacies such as apple tart, fadge and a steaming fruit dumpling, heaped with cream, is one of the film’s highlights, sure to make the mouth water. The filming experience inspired Mrs McDowell to write a sequel, Roses and Rainbows.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/other-days-around-me-1760\n\nSeamus Heaney: A Sense of Ireland 06min 17sec\n\n1980\n\nSeamus Heaney on how writers help give a nation its sense of self.

She shares her thoughts on the writing experience, discusses the writers she considers great and quotes from her own novels.\n\nIn terms of personal experience, she refers to the overbearing influence of her mother, of how \"her sensibilities became mine\". In particular, she notes that her own attitudes to personal relationships (with men) was, in effect, an echo of her mother's attitudes. Love and sex with a man - in or out of wedlock - was seen as a terrible wrong.\n\nO'Brien's rural upbringing was another formative influence. She observes that she used language and imagination as a means of running away from a real life comprising \"of cattle and donkeys\". However, Ireland's landscape, she sees as a positive influence, and something that manifests in her work in important ways.\n\nIn summation, she believes that (good) writing comes from \"the blood and guts of one's experience\".\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/irish-writers-edna-obrien-2676\n\nIrish Writers: Michael Longley 19min 09sec\n\n1993\n\nProfile of Michael Longley (b.1939), one of Northern Ireland's foremost poets and author of renowned collections, including Gorse Fires (1991) and The Weather in Japan (2000) and The Stairwell (2015).\n\nIn this episode of Irish Writers, Longley discusses the life experiences and cultural touchstones that were pivotal in his development as a writer. He shares his thoughts on the writing experience, discusses the writers he considers great and quotes from his own poems.\n\nA significant part of Longley's identity comes from the fact that he is a twin. \"From the moment of conception, right through birth and babyhood and through to the age of 16 or 17,\" he never spent a night on his own. Despite this, both Michael and his twin were vastly different in terms of personality, something they came to appreciate in their later years.\n\nHe describes Belfast and the West of Ireland as the \"two poles in my life\". It is in a remote part of Mayo, called Carrigskeewaun, where he feels he has truly grown both personally and professionally. Inspiring some of his most beautiful nature poems, not least ‘Remembering Carrigskeewaun’, the townland is also home to a family tradition, it become customary that each of Longley's children, newborn, is carried by hand to the secluded beach.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/irish-writers-michael-longley-2830\n\nIrish Writers: Maeve Binchy\n\n19min 12sec\n\n1993\n\nProfile of Maeve Binchy (1939 to 2012), one of Ireland's most renowned and successful novelists. Her warm, humorous and compassionate writing style are showcased in international best sellers, including Light a Penny Candle (1982), Echoes (1985), Circle of Friends (1990) and Tara Road (1998).\n\nIn this episode of Irish Writers, Binchy discusses the life experiences and cultural touchstones that were pivotal in her development as a writer. She shares her thoughts on the writing experience and quotes from her novels.\n\nShe recounts her first, somewhat unusual, foray as a writer. Having gone to Israel, she determined to keep her family informed of what she was doing (and allay their fears), by writing them long detailed letters. Unbeknownst to Binchy, her family had one of these letters typed-up, sent to a magazine and it was soon published! Amused, she describes arriving home to discover she had become a \"writer by accident!\" What, she pondered, \"might happen if I did it [tried to become a writer] on purpose?! However, despite this early, inadvertent break, it would be another four years before a piece of her work was again published.\n\nBinchy explains a common trope, of basing her stories within villages. It is, she says, strategic. \"It's terribly easy... because you don't have to think a whole lot of complicated excuses as to why Mary met John\". Similarly, she often writes about children, as their experiences and lives are something that everybody can, to some degree, understand. However, she notes that she choose not to write children's books, as her past career as a teacher would come through, and the children could \"sniff that out\"!\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/irish-writers-maeve-binchy-2832\n\nThe New Marine Biology Unit in Portaferry\n\n43sec\n\n1966\n\nA new Marine Biology Unit is opened in Portaferry.

The College was the centrepiece of the development of further education in Belfast. Purpose built, it acted as a showpiece on a par with Belfast’s other prominent buildings of the era, including the Belfast City Hall, St. Anne’s Cathedral and the Presbyterian Assembly Buildings.\n\nKnown colloquially to the citizens of Belfast as “the Black Man Tech” or simply ‘the Tech”, the College has been the gateway to education and employment for thousands of skilled apprentices, students and trainees in ship building and engineering and industries such as ropes and linen. Most families in Belfast and indeed Northern Ireland can claim a connection. Famous artists, engineers, broadcasters, politicians and sporting personalities count as its alumni, but the real history of the College is the ordinary men and women entering further and higher education with hopes of improving their chances of gaining employment or seeking to develop their inherent talents.\n\nBelfast College of Technology closed its doors for the last time as an educational establishment in summer 2011, as the Belfast Metropolitan College transferred to the Titanic Quarter of Belfast. History came full circle as the College, which educated thousands of shipyard apprentices, took up a location where they once worked became a part of a new renaissance in this quarter of the city.\n\nhttps://digitalfilmarchive.net/media/belfast-tech-artisans-and-dreamers-2177\n\nWhat Will You Do When You Leave School? 02min 44sec\n\n1964\n\nJimmy Greene talks to some 15 year olds at Orangefield High about their intentions now they are at school leaving age.
