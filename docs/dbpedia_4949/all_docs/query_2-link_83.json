The show was created from the Pilot Project contest on Teletoon.[2] The show premiered in the United States exclusively on Hulu on October 13, 2013.[3][4]\n\nOn June 9, 2014, it was announced that a third season of the show had been ordered.[5] It was revealed at Fan Expo Canada 2015 that the third season would air in October on Adult Swim.[6] They also ran a promotional contest to name Special Agent Strait McCool's horse previously only known as Horse.[7]\n\nUltimately, on January 19, 2016, it was announced that it would not be ordering a fourth season of the show. Although the series was not renewed after three seasons, the YouTube channel still uploads daily as of 2024.[8] 46 episodes were produced.\n\nPlot\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series follows a New York City mafia caporegime Jimmy Falcone, who moves to Regina, Saskatchewan to join a witness protection program after he kills his mob boss, Don Gambini.[9][10] While pleading for his uncle Francesco \"Cheech\" Falcone's life, Don Gambini told Jimmy that he was required to kill his uncle. Then he made a sexual innuendo about Jimmy's oldest daughter Theresa, so an angry Jimmy impulsively threw Don Gambini out the 19th-floor window to his death. The rest of the Gambini mob retaliated by trying to kill Jimmy, not caring if any of his family got killed. With no other options, Jimmy cuts a deal with the FBI to protect his family, and they agree to place the Falcones in Witness Protection if Jimmy testifies against his fellow mobsters. This results in Jimmy and his family moving to Regina and living a new life under the name McDougal.[9]\n\nCast\n\n[edit]\n\nJames Danger \"Jimmy\" Falcone (McDougal) (voiced by Tony Nappo) - The show's main protagonist. After his uncle, Cheech, had been caught repeatedly exposing mafia secrets (Jimmy Hoffa’s burial site, the Kennedys, Scientology, etc.) to the public in bars and clubs, Jimmy was forced to plead with his boss Don Gambini for Cheech's life. However, his request was rejected and Gambini made a crude remark towards Jimmy's daughter Teresa. In retaliation, Jimmy kills Gambini by throwing him out of a high-rise window. Not too long after Gambini’s death, the Gambini mob tries to kill Jimmy in retaliation, not caring if they killed his family in the process. In order to avoid retribution, he ratted out his former mob fellows to the FBI and has his family relocated to Regina, Saskatchewan via witness protection as a result. He consistently calls the city \"Vagina\" (among many other malapropisms) despite being set up with a job at the Regina Tourism Office by the witness protection program. He conforms to a stoic, masculine gangster archetype, though occasionally exposes more sensitive sides. He cares deeply about his family, regardless of their shortcomings and failures, including Cheech, whose antics have caused, and continue to cause, him trouble. His struggles to successfully meld his gangland instincts with the Canadian way of life driving many of the series' plots.\n\nCookie Falcone (McDougal) (voiced by Jacqueline Pillon) - Jimmy's wife. She describes herself as a typical Brooklyn girl, which, to her, implies loyalty but with a degree of materialism and the expectation that her husband will take care of her—whenever he falls short, she quickly becomes disgruntled. She met Jimmy while she was stripping at a club. She loves her children but expresses vacillating degrees of resentment towards Cheech, as the cause of her family's move to Canada. She is frequently portrayed as the voice of reason. She has a brother named Paulie, who is similar to Petey, but she feels unable to talk about him around the family, due to his past betrayal of Jimmy.\n\nFrancesco \"Cheech\" Falcone (McDougal) (voiced by Chuck Shamata) - Jimmy's uncle. Cheech's inability to keep mob secrets to himself is the primary reason the Falcone family is in witness protection. He is an alcoholic and his hare-brained antics often drive episode plots. Despite his idiocy, Jimmy cares deeply about him and often attempts to keep him in line. The rest of the family is somewhat more ambivalent towards Cheech, treating him with wildly varying degrees of coldness. Gina, in particular, seems to dislike, or even loathe, Cheech.\n\nTheresa Maria Falcone (McDougal) (voiced by Emilie-Claire Barlow) - Cookie & Jimmy's eldest daughter. She is 17 and matches up with the ditzy, airheaded, promiscuous archetype, often using her beauty to attract and exploit boys. She is superficial and materialistic, yet shows a slightly more sensitive side as the show progresses.\n\nPeter Frampton \"Petey\" Falcone (McDougal) (voiced by Danny Smith) - Cookie and Jimmy's middle child and only son. He is 16, a straight-A student, and a self-professed activist involved with a range of issues (most typically, environmentalism and pacifism). At school, he's unpopular and deemed a \"loser\" by many of the other kids. His personality and intellectual interests strongly contrast with those of his family. At one point, while attempting to understand the discrepancy, he comes to believe himself to be adopted—after which it's revealed that he simply takes after a different side of the family, specifically his uncle Paulie. He is the only member of the family who is happy about the relocation to Canada, having seemingly hated the \"old life\".\n\nGina Madonna Falcone (McDougal) (voiced by Linda Kash) - Cookie and Jimmy's youngest child. She is 7 and takes after her father and uncle in possessing the mentality of a mobster, which is frequently shown to become sociopathic. She sometimes expresses a desire to kill Cheech for creating the circumstances that forced their move to Canada. She has a crush on Don Gambini's son, Carmine, who is similar to her and reciprocates her feelings.\n\nSpecial Agent Strait McCool (voiced by Ted Atherton) - A well-meaning, friendly, and conscientiously law-abiding Royal Canadian Mounted Police agent assigned to oversee the McDougal family. As an officer of the law, he is extremely - unrealistically - competent, described by his senior in one episode as having \"cleaned up the entire west side of the country\" after working vice, homicide, and narcotics. He is an ever-present thorn in Jimmy's side whenever the latter attempts to pull off a scheme. McCool reveals that his father abandoned him and his only known relative is his mother. He is revealed to be a former gambling addict, attend swinger parties and it was revealed by Cookie that he starred in a porno movie. His catchphrase is \"For Canada, where...\" or \"For Canada, and...\", ending with an apparently humorous aphorism or pithy summation somehow related to the current conversation, the episode's plot, or Canadian culture more broadly. McCool is likely a direct parody of Rocky and Bullwinkle's dimwitted but well-meaning Canadian Mountie, Dudley Do-Right.\n\nShwa-Shwa (voiced by Damon Papadopulos)\n\nSally Manero - formerly known as Salvatore \"Sal\" Falcone, Sally is Jimmy's estranged transgender mother and Cheech's biological sister. First appearing in The Broadfather, she explained that the reason for her disappearance was because the mob would kill her if they knew she was a trans, leading to her abandoning Jimmy at the age of 13 and Jimmy assuming his \"father\" had been killed by a rival gang. Initially, Jimmy refused to reconcile with his \"father\", not because she is trans, but because she abandoned him when he was still young. However, Jimmy eventually does so after Sally explains to him that it hurt her to leave her own child, but had she stayed, Jimmy would have never been made capo.\n\nEpisodes\n\n[edit]\n\nSeason 1 (2012)\n\n[edit]\n\nFugget About It season 1 episodesNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitleWritten byOriginal air date11\"Hate Crime Legislation is for Pussies\"Jeff Abugov & Willem WennekersSeptember 7, 2012 ( ) 22\"The Full Mountie\"Jeff AbugovSeptember 14, 2012 ( ) 33\"Screw You, Mr. Wonderful\"Pat BullardSeptember 21, 2012 ( ) 44\"The Man With No Ass\"Rebecca AddelmanSeptember 28, 2012 ( ) 55\"Cousin Sammy Dies in the End\"Jay ShoreOctober 5, 2012 ( ) 66\"Rainbows and Painted Hos\"Jeff Abugov, Rebecca Addelman, Pat Bullard, Charles Horn, & Willem WennekersOctober 12, 2012 ( ) 77\"Chokin' and Tokin' in the Queen City\"Pat BullardOctober 19, 2012 ( ) 88\"Al Capone Wears Ladies Underwear\"Willem WennekersOctober 26, 2012 ( ) 99\"Petey Gets God'd\"Rebecca AddelmanNovember 2, 2012 ( ) 1010\"The Oracle of Vagina\"Charles HornNovember 9, 2012 ( ) 1111\"The Horny Bastard\"Jeff AbugovNovember 16, 2012 ( ) 1212\"Sex on Ice\"Charles HornNovember 23, 2012 ( ) 1313\"Hunts With Handgun\"Willem WennekersNovember 30, 2012 ( )\n\nSeason 2 (2013)\n\n[edit]\n\nFugget About It season 2 episodesNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitleWritten byOriginal air date141\"The McFrugals\"Renee PercySeptember 5, 2013 ( ) 152\"Mennonites!\"Steven ClarkSeptember 12, 2013 ( ) 163\"Too Cool for Night School\"Charles HornSeptember 19, 2013 ( ) 174\"The Broadfather\"Willem WennekersSeptember 26, 2013 ( ) 185\"Royally Screwed\"Nicole DemerseOctober 3, 2013 ( ) 196\"You Only Try Haggis Once\"Jeremy WinkelsOctober 10, 2013 ( ) 207\"From My Cold Limp Hands\"Willem WennekersOctober 17, 2013 ( ) 218\"The Fugly American\"Willem WennekersOctober 24, 2013 ( ) 229\"The Man from P.I.G.L.E.T.\"Jeremy WinkelsNovember 7, 2013 ( ) 2310\"Pizza with Extra Cheech\"Willem WennekersNovember 14, 2013 ( ) 2411\"The Balls on This Room\"Nicole DemerseNovember 21, 2013 ( ) 2512\"Ass-Jax\"Steven ClarkNovember 28, 2013 ( ) 2613\"Effin' Neighbors, Eh?\"Steven ClarkDecember 5, 2013 ( )\n\nSeason 3 (2015–2016)\n\n[edit]\n\nFugget About It season 3 episodesNo.\n\noverallNo. in\n\nseasonTitle [11]Written byOriginal air date271\"Havana Kill Castro\"Willem WennekersOctober 28, 2015 ( ) 282\"Universal Prostitution and Pizza Fridays\"Steven ClarkNovember 13, 2015 ( ) 293\"Just Stick It in That There Doo-Dad\"Laurie ElliottNovember 20, 2015 ( ) 304\"Confetti Deathblow\"Tony BinnsNovember 27, 2015 ( ) 315\"Jimmy Gets Goosed\"Andrew De AngelisDecember 4, 2015 ( ) 326\"Casino Loyale\"Andrew De AngelisDecember 11, 2015 ( ) 337\"Vagina's Got Talent\"Laurie ElliottDecember 18, 2015 ( ) 348\"New York State of Blind Drunk\"Willem WennekersJanuary 1, 2016 ( ) 359\"Cookie's Ovary-Actin'\"Kyle MuirJanuary 8, 2016 ( ) 3610\"Royal Canadian Groping Pariah\"Andrew De AngelisJanuary 22, 2016 ( ) 3711\"What the Fuck is the Grey Cup?\"Steven ClarkJanuary 29, 2016 ( ) 3812\"Sasquatchewan\"Willem WennekersFebruary 5, 2016 ( ) 3913\"Nonna Your Business\"Steven ClarkFebruary 12, 2016 ( ) 4014\"Layin' Some Pipeline\"Laurie ElliotFebruary 19, 2016 ( ) 4115\"Keepin' Up with the McFelchers\"Bobby TheodoreFebruary 26, 2016 ( ) 4216\"Horse Springs Paternal\"Willem WennekersMarch 4, 2016 ( ) 4317\"Hot, Wet, Amphibious Summer\"Laurie ElliottMarch 11, 2016 ( ) 4418\"An Unmarried Bra Whisperer\"Steven ClarkMarch 18, 2016 ( ) 4519\"Spicy Apocalypse\"Willem WennekersMarch 25, 2016 ( ) 4620\"Vengeance Wore a Unitard\"Steven Clark & Willem WennekersApril 1, 2016 ( )\n\nTelecast and home media\n\n[edit]\n\nThe series premiered on Teletoon's late night block, Teletoon at Night in Canada on September 7, 2012.[12] The series moved to Adult Swim, and the third season premiered on October 28, 2015 with the final episode aired on April 1, 2016.\n\nIt was announced in August 2013, that Hulu have strike a deal for the series, and premiered in the United States exclusively on the streamer on October 13, 2013.[3][4] The series is currently available on Tubi and The Roku Channel.\n\nEntertainment One released the first season on DVD as a 2-disc set on September 30, 2014.
