        "text": "Today actor Matt Dillon joins fellow quinquagenarians like Nic Cage and Brad Pitt in turning the big 5-0. Dillon started acting as a teen in the late '70s and has clocked over 50 credits in a wide range of genres, most notably mainstream roles in There's Something About Mary, Wild Things, Crash, and Singles. But unlike his aforementioned contemporaries, Dillon's never succumbed to starring in a franchise or any summer blockbuster action films, which is incredible thinking he could totally helm a superhero flick. He's opted for more indie fare in the past decade, but this summer he'll make a major comeback when he stars in his first TV role, the M. Night Shyamalan-produced Wayward Pines series on Fox. We look forward to seeing what he does with primetime, but in the meantime, we celebrate Matt Dillon as we've come to know him, from crop top-wearing lost teen to bonafide ladies man.\n\nOver the Edge (1979)\n\nAt fifteen years old, Dillon made his film debut. Dillon's Richie sports sleeveless crop top shirts and other questionable fashions from the late '70s.\n\n\"A dead kid...\"\n\n\"Steers and queers\"\n\nMany think the line about Texas and steers and queers originated from Full Metal Jacket, but it was actually Dillon who first said it in this film. (An Officer and a Gentleman used it a second time in 1982.)\n\nLittle Darlings (1980)\n\nHe flirts with Kristy McNichol in a charming way. Then he takes her virginity.\n\nMy Bodyguard (1980)\n\nDillon turns the tables and plays a greasy bully. He gets bonus points for wearing white pants while trying to intimidate someone.\n\nTex (1982)\n\nThe first in a trio of S.E. Hinton/Francis Ford Coppola collaborations he starred in, this was Dillon's first lead role.\n\nTex broods because his brother sold his damn horses.\n\nBut he feels better after setting his arts and crafts on fire.\n\nThe Outsiders (1983)\n\nSo much young talent: Dillon with Cruise, Macchio, Estevez, Howell, and Lowe.\n\nHere, he packs a powerful punch.\n\nYet he can be a little clumsy.\n\nRumble Fish (1983)\n\nRusty James's brother teaches him about Siamese fighting fish.\n\nThe Flamingo Kid (1984)\n\nIn the mid-'80s, Dillon got goofy. Here, he makes eating annoying.\n\nDillon shares a scene with babelicious Lucille Bluth (Jessica Walter). Who knew she was once so ripped?\n\nMore eating issues: Dining on rich people food can be difficult.\n\nTarget (1985)\n\nDillon pals around with his dad (Gene Hackman), who turns out to be a spy.\n\nA fleeting action star is born. Dabbling in international espionage, he and his dad save his mother from being blown to bits.\n\nKansas (1988)\n\nLook at that badass swagger! He owns this mediocre film.\n\nThat gold tooth warns others not to mess with him. He is a dangerous criminal, after all.\n\nHe's also a violent gum chewer.\n\nDrugstore Cowboy (1989)\n\nKeeping with the outlaw mindset, Dillon won an Independent Spirit Award for his portrayal of a pharmaceutical robber/drug addict in probably Gus Van Sant's best work.\n\nHats... so many hats.\n\nSeriously, don't get near any hats on a bed or else. Don't mention puppies either.\n\nA Kiss Before Dying (1991)\n\nOverall a terrible film, but Dillon gets to strangle people and then a train runs over him at the end, resulting in an unintentionally funny denouement.\n\nSingles (1992)\n\nIn grunge-era Seattle, Cliff's the lead singer of band Citizen Dick, along with Pearl Jam members Eddie Vedder and Jeff Ament, and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell. The flowing mane, the soul patch... so vintage.\n\nComposing bad Citizen Dick songs.\n\nInstalling glass-breaking speakers.\n\nCliff learns to appreciate Bridget Fonda. Again, with the hats.\n\n\"Bless you,\" Cliff says.\n\nIf you stop being an egotistical musician and start being polite, you'll get the girl.\n\nThe Saint of Fort Washington (1993)\n\nBack to drama: Dillon plays a homeless schizo photographer who hears voices and eventually gets stabbed to death. Speaking of being murdered...\n\nTo Die For (1995)\n\nBeing sexy has its price, as he'll find out later when Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Stone (Nicole Kidman) hires Joaquin Phoenix to whack him.\n\n\"Put your face on me,\" he demands.\n\nUntil the day he dies, he's an avid supporter of his nutty wife, though.\n\nBeautiful Girls (1996)\n\nWe feel your pain, Matty.\n\nIn & Out (1997)\n\nDillon went platinum blond to play a pretentious actor.\n\nCameron Drake inadvertently outs Kevin Kline during an acceptance speech at the Oscars. Dillon didn't win any awards for this, but Joan Cusack did receive an Oscar nom for her role.\n\nThere's Something About Mary (1998)\n\nThe film was Dillon's biggest hit, and it won him an MTV Movie Award for Best Villain.\n\nChanneling Dr. Teeth.\n\n\"Puffer, stay away from the light!\"\n\nWhile trying to resuscitate Mary's dog, Dillon accidentally sets Puffer on fire.\n\nWild Things (1998)\n\nDillon has a threesome with Denise Richards and Neve Campbell, which is probably the only thing people remember about this movie — besides the Sapphic pool scene, of course.\n\nWell, and Bill Murray as his lawyer.\n\nAnd Dillon and Kevin Bacon sharing a brewskie, with homoerotic undertones.\n\nOne Night at McCool's (2001)\n\nThere's a Village People joke in here somewhere. Believe it or not, Dillon plays the most normal dude.\n\nMatt: \"Do you like water?\"\n\nLiv Tyler: \"I love it. It's actually my second favorite thing in the world.\"\n\nMatt: \"Really? Then what's your first favorite?\"\n\nLiv: \"Fking.\"\n\nCrash (2004)\n\nSay what you will about Crash beating out that gay cowboy movie for Best Picture, but Dillon's performance as a cop cinched him a much-deserved and overdue Oscar nomination.\n\nEmployee of the Month (2005)\n\nAfter doing the intense Crash, Dillon lets loose and goes postal at his bank job.\n\nThen he turns down hooker Jenna Fischer's many advances.\n\nModern Family (2011)\n\nIn a rare television appearance, Dillon guests as Claire's (Julie Bowen) limo-driving ex-boyfriend, who's romancing her mother (Shelley Long).\n\nIn the end, a man's gotta have a code.\n\nGirl Most Likely (2013)\n\nBut sometimes that code involves wearing a rubber suit so you don't get struck by lightning for the fourth time."
