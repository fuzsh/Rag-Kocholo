        "text": "A black comedy about an alluring beauty called Jewel and the three men who fall in love with her one night. The story begins in McCool’s bar after closing time. Barman Randy takes the attractive girl under his wing after her companion throws her out of the car. Watching from afar is Randy’s distant cousin, the married lawyer Carl. Then Jewel and Randy make passionate love in his house and she tells him about the trick she and her companion Utah use when they intend stealing something. Then the rough-cut Utah himself appears and forces Randy to go back to the bar with him to get money out of the safe. But his partner unexpectedly appears at the bar and shoots him. Detective Dehling is assigned to investigate the case but he, too, falls for the girl big time. Each of the men tells his story to their “confessor” and thus a mosaic of events is created, dominated by black humour, bizarre eroticism and a high-speed outcome. The role of hired assassin is played by Michael Douglas, who produced the film.\n\nHarald Zwart (b. 1966, Fredrikstad, Norway) studied at the Dutch Film Academy in Amsterdam. He became established not only in Scandinavia but also in Britain, France, Germany and the USA for his numerous spots and videoclips. He made the short films Gull og gronne skoger (1993) and Hytta (1996) and in 1998 the feature film Hamilton, produced in Sweden, featuring the popular secret agent created by well-known writer Jan Guillou. A four-part TV version with the same title was made in 2001. He began the American stage of his career with the film One Night at McCool’s. He is currently working on the film version of the comic-strip series Wolff and Byrd, entitled Supernatural Law."
