        "text": "SEX/NUDITY 8 - Lots of sexual innuendo, including references to oral sex, multiple partner sex, and homosexual sex. A man and woman kiss passionately. A woman throws a man on the bed, takes off her shirt and straddles him, he rubs her bra-covered breasts (the two are obviously having sex, but we only see the man's pants at his ankles and the woman in her bra). A woman goes down on a man to perform fellatio but we don't see her actually do it. A woman erotically washes a car, rubbing her breasts against the foamy windshield, squirting water up her dress between her legs and on her breasts (she's clothed but wet); two men watch her do this, full of lust. We see a woman in her bra straddling a man in bed and humping him. A man unbuckles his pants to have sex with a woman but she doesn't want to. A man forcefully slams a woman on a bed and talks dirty to her and is ready to rape her but she defends herself. A man and woman engage in S&M, with the dominatrix whipping the man's buttocks several times (he's on his hands and knees enjoying the lashing). A woman puts a man's hand on her inner thigh and then the two have sex, but we only see them in bed post-coitus and covered. We see a man in an S&M outfit (dog collar, chains, etc.) and his underwear sticks out through the hole in the back of his outfit. We see a shirtless man. It's implied two women will get together sexually and ask a man to join them. A woman licks a man's hear sexually. We see a woman on the toilet from her belly up.\n\nVIOLENCE/GORE 6 - Threatening with guns and many shots fired. A man is shot and killed; we see the corpse in a pool of blood near his head. A man is shot in the shoulder; we see bloody on his shirt. A man in shot in the gut and blood gushes out onto his shirt; he dies. We see a corpse being zipped up in a body bag. A woman slaps a man ; a man slaps a woman. A man tries to rape a woman but she kicks him in the groin, knocking him into a shelf; the man is all bloody and dies when an appliance falls on his head. A man tries to rape a woman in a car; we hear her scream and see them scuffle but she escapes. A woman has a black eye. A man jumps out of a window. A dumpster falls on a man.\n\nBe aware that while we do our best to avoid spoilers it is impossible to disguise all details and some may reveal crucial plot elements.\n\nWe've gone through several editorial changes since we started covering films in 1992 and older reviews are not as complete & accurate as recent ones; we plan to revisit and correct older reviews as resources and time permits.\n\nOur ratings and reviews are based on the theatrically-released versions of films; on video there are often Unrated, Special, Director's Cut or Extended versions, (usually accurately labelled but sometimes mislabeled) released that contain additional content, which we did not review.\n\nFILTER by RATINGS\n\nDid you know you can now filter searches by any combination of ratings? Just go to our search page or use the search bar, with or without a keyword, from the top navigation menu. Move sliders from 0-10 in any combination, check and uncheck MPAA ratings and use keywords to further filter results -- please let us know what you think.\n\nTHE ASSIGNED NUMBERS\n\nUnlike the MPAA we do not assign one inscrutable rating based on age but 3 objective ratings for SEX/NUDITY, VIOLENCE/GORE & LANGUAGE on a scale of 0 to 10, from lowest to highest depending on quantity & context |more|"
