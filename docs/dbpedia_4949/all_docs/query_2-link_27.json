        "text": "After appearing as a Battle Advisor during on The Voice's very first season, as a Top 12 Mentor in Season 8, and as the Mega Mentor in Season 23, Reba McEntire claimed a Coaches chair of her own during Season 24 and will extend her red chair reign for Season 25 of the show.\n\nKnown in many circles as the undisputed \"Queen of Country,\" the chart-topping, Grammy Award-winning, Country Music Hall of Fame inductee is more than just a prolific musical artist. She's also an actress, entrepreneur, and philanthropist — a modern-day Renaissance woman, if you will.\n\nRELATED: Reba McEntire and Carrie Underwood Did a Thrilling Live Duet of a Reba Classic\n\nMcEntire's taken on several classic acting roles in the realms of theater, film, and television and thus even for those unfamiliar with the sheer breadth of her music career may have spotted her in beloved projects like Tremors or on her self-titled sitcom.\n\nReba McEntire Movies after Tremors: From North to Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar\n\nIn 1994, McEntire continued to collect exciting film roles, starring in the dramedy North as Ma Tex and in The Little Rascals as A.J. Ferguson. McEntire's ability to bring country charm to the big screen was beloved by fans old and new and so, while simultaneously starring in several television projects, she went on to star in the 2001 comedy One Night at McCool's as Dr. Green.\n\nMcEntire has also taken her voice to the studio for several children's films, playing Dixie in the film The Fox and the Hound 2 and Betsy in the live-action film adaptation of Charlotte's Web in 2006. She also provided the voice of Etta in the 2016 animated film The Land Before Time XIV: Journey of the Brave and the voice of Joy Jenkins in the 2019 film Spies in Disguise.\n\nMcEntire proved through her beloved sitcom that she has wit for days — which lent itself perfectly for her role as Trish in the 2021 comedy Barb and Star Go to Vista Del Mar (from future Strays director Josh Greenbaum), starring alongside SNL star Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo.\n\nReba McEntire's TV Movies: From The Gambler to The Hammer\n\nIn her most recent television movie, Reba McEntire's The Hammer, McEntire played the newly appointed Judge of the 5th Judicial District of Nevada, Kim Wheeler. Inspired by Wheeler's real-life experience as one the last traveling circuit judges in the U.S., the 2023 television film is a gripping testament to McEntire's chameleonic talent.\n\nMcEntire has starred in several other television films throughout her sprawling acting career, starting in 1991 when she starred in The Gambler Returns: The Luck of the Draw. It was a fateful role considering that was when she first met her co-star and future partner, Rex Linn, whom she has dated since 2020, according to Entertainment Tonight.\n\nRELATED: Reba McEntire Talks the \"Pressure\" of Coaching The Voice After Blake Shelton\n\nMcEntire has also starred in the television films The Man from Left Field (1993), Is There Life Out There? (1994), Forever Love (1998), Secret of Giving (1999), and the 2021 television movie Christmas in Tune.\n\nReba McEntire's Emmy-Nominated Sitcom Reba\n\nMcEntire's self-titled sitcom, Reba ran for over 120 episodes across six seasons between 2001 and 2007. Created by Allison M. Gibson, the multi-camera series starred McEntire as a fictionalized, wisecracking version of herself.\n\nThe sitcom is famous for its viral theme song, \"I'm a Survivor\" (sung by Reba, of course), the lyrics of which — \"A single mom who works two jobs / Who loves her kids and never stops / With gentle hands and the heart of a fighter\" — mirror the everyday trials and tribulations of the show's main character.\n\nReba scored Primetime Emmy and Golden Globe nominations for her role in the series and took home a win at the 28th Annual People's Choice Awards, which named McEntire Favorite Female Performer in a New Television Series, according to Rolling Stone.\n\nReba McEntire's New NBC Comedy Series\n\nGood news for Reba fans: McEntire is returning to the sitcom world in a new comedy, coming soon to NBC. While a title and premiere date for the series has yet to be announced, hilarity is guaranteed on the horizon.\n\nRELATED: Reba McEntire Is Returning to TV With a New NBC Comedy: Details\n\nA logline for McEntire's new, multi-cam sitcom teases: \"Reba inherits her father’s restaurant and is less than thrilled to discover that she has a new business partner in the half-sister she never knew she had.\"\n\nWhat to Know About Reba McEntire's Music Career\n\nMcEntire was instilled with a love of singing from a young age by her mother, Jackie, according to the Country Music Hall of Fame website. That passion led Reba to form a musical trio, the \"Singing McEntires,\" with siblings Pake and Susie.\n\nHer big break came in 1974 when country star Red Steagall heard her rendition of the national anthem at the National Finals Rodeo in Oklahoma City. Steagall bankrolled Reba's first professional studio session, which led to an official record deal with Mercury Records a year later. The label released her first six albums — Reba McEntire, Out of a Dream, Feel the Fire, Heart to Heart, Unlimited, and Behind the Scene — between 1977 and 1983.\n\nRELATED: Listen to All of Reba McEntire's Biggest Hits Before She Joined The Voice\n\nMcEntire ultimately grew frustrated with Mercury, whom she felt was trying to pigeonhole her into the genre of country-pop. She eventually signed with MCA Records in 1984.\n\nHer relationship with MCA lasted for over two decades, yielding such acclaimed albums as My Kind of Country (1984), which went gold and nabbed McEntire the title of Female Vocalist of the Year at the Country Music Awards (she'd go on to win the accolade three more times)."
