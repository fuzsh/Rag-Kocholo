        "text": "WELCOME SHATRAUG, IT HAS BEEN SOME YEARS SINCE OUR LAST INTERVIEW. IN THE PAST YOU HAVE MENTIONED SOME LYRICS REVOLVE AROUND OCCULT PHENOMENA AND SUPERSTITIONS  I FIND THIS VERY INTERESTING AND COULD YOU GIVE US A COUPLE OF EXAMPLES WHERE YOU HAVE EXPLORED THESE TOPICS WITHIN HORNA? COULD YOU EXPLAIN FURTHER WHAT YOU MEAN BY THIS QUOTE (FROM AN OLD INTERVIEW) EVERY PRIDE-FILLED DESTINY HAS TO BE EARNED?\n\nGreetings Dale! Long time no see indeed. Glad to see old dogs still barking at the moon. The lyrics Ive been writing these years have nearly all been evolving on and off around occult things, mostly touching my visions and ritual hours, concrete occult study, ideas, thoughts, even a lesson or too I might add. There is too much to say when it comes to it all but before this latest concept album on Black Death the entire Envaatnags  album was focused on three themes, the self, sorcery and lycanthropy. Our vocalist Corvus has written very satisfying texts as well. I can only say that as I do not know his full visions and intents with all of it. Sorcery and lycanthropy as themes are self-explaining, that would need no further look but the self I mention is all about personal visions, feelings, some other inspirations. Anything can set alight the flame of creation. Damn it Dale, I cant remember what this quote was about now that its taken out of context. I can only relate to it that in my present view it would mean you have to be true to yourself, only this way you can reach what you seek for.\n\nHORNA HAVE ON RECENT ALBUMS ADDED A BIT MORE MELODICISM BUT AS A FOLLOWER I APPRECIATE YOU HAVE NEVER SACRIFICED YOUR HARSH ROOTS. DO YOU FIND IT DIFFICULT TO FIND A PROPER BALANCE BETWEEN THE TWO? IT IS DIFFICULT TO INDUCE A DEEP COLD HATRED IN THE LISTENER AND AT THE SAME TIME MAKING HIM WANT TO HEADBANG TO THE MUSIC  IS THIS THE SORT OF REACTION YOU STRIVE FOR? EVER WORRY HORNA MAY BECOME TOO MELODIC?\n\nHell no, I cant see us becoming melodic in a way it would be gay, no way. I think you can bring a lot of different elements even from pop music, normal heavy metal etc into Black Metal to give variation and effective passages without losing any in the atmosphere. On the contrary, by avoiding the repetition of elements which are used in every other Black Metal album you will in the end be creating something that has a unique tone to it. I cant distance myself to be objective enough to know how I manage this in the end but it just happens, I kind of need to have that certain feeling everything falls in place. Some of the songs I compose are kind of on the edge of being too melodic but I think it gives a nice contrast to the final creation. I dont even know what to expect from myself either, anything could happen I guess. Who knows, maybe one of these days I compose another album in the vein of our most raw materials.\n\nDo you ever feel like you are possessed or channeling something when writing your music? Do you believe in unexplained phenomena, ghosts, spirits etc ?\n\nOh, you can be sure of that. I do not know what comes to me when I get that feeling I need to create, it just cant be stopped. It will gnaw on bone and muscle until I start doing it and wont let go until its all finished. I could be obsessed with new ideas until Im all dried out again, purged of all the energy flowing through me. I believe there is something left of all spiritual life of those who passed away, it can manifest at times like a warning signal in the back of your head. I once felt a beckoning within me to drive off the highway as soon as possible and once I took the next ramp, three minutes later the whole fucking rear end axel tore away and my car bashed on the other lane with a full circle. Had I been on the highway instead of a normal road well, you figure. There is also a more vicious proof of evil spirits existence but I do not speak of this in more detail. Lets just say I prayed to vengeance an enemy and got what I needed.\n\nIT HAS BEEN 8 YEARS SINCE OUR LAST INTERVIEW. DO YOU THINK SOME OF THE TREND-HYPE OF THE BLACK METAL SCENE IS STARTING TO FADE AWAY AND THE LONG TIME FOLLOWERS, WHOSE HEARTS STILL BURN REMAIN? DO YOU THINK HONOUR IS COMING BACK IN THE SCENE OR IS IT SLIPPING WORSE THAN EVER? IS IT A PERPETUAL CYCLE OF STRENGTH / WEAKNESS COMING AND LEAVING THE SCENE? DO YOU THINK THE BLACK METAL SCENE HAS FINALLY RID ITSELF OF THIS PERCEIVED ASSOCIATION WITH THE ROMANTICISM OF GOTH?\n\nI think the trend-hype is worse than ever really. There are far more labels releasing crap that should be no more than demos and sell those for a full price, not to mention they offer those in trade instead of buying anything they want to sell in their shabby distros. Honour is something very rare these days but I know a lot of people who embrace it still. The romanticism is surely something only mainstream people associate with. On the other hand, I would say even Horna has created lyrics of the romantic kind, its all in the eye of the beholder and what you find in your heart. As for the scene that exists today I really think that some of the best music you can find is released in small circles on demos only. This kind of bands I have found dont seem to be so eager to release an album after another but instead focus on creating true black art which seems to be much neglected by many. I do like the depressive/ suicidal trend thats going on, the atmosphere of some bands is simply great very dark and obscure.\n\nWHY HAS SATANIC WARMASTER LEFT HORNA, DID HE SIMPLY WANT TO CREATE HIS OWN MUSIC OR REASONS OF LACK OF MOTIVATION ETC ? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF HIS SOLO BANDS OUTPUT? WAS IT DIFFICULT TO FIND A SIMILAR / SUITABLE REPLACEMENT?\n\nWhen he left Horna he was simply drained of all motivation to continue. At that time he didnt have any bands or projects for roughly a year at all I think, at least didnt notice any. After he got some inspiration back he started on his own. I think it was a good choice as hes been doing great music since then. Finding Corvus was pure luck really, I heard a demo where he was doing vocals and got in touch, everything clicked and the first time we met in person we already went and recorded vocals on a couple of Horna songs. He is definitely a more suitable person to front Horna than SW was, no offense to him of course.\n\nBLACK METAL SODOMY <lyrics>\n\nNazarene, nazarene bastard child!\n\nYou were born from a whore and you\n\nwill bleed like she before!\n\nSodomy, sodomy, raping you\n\nwith my horns and hellish steel,\n\nagony and pain to feel!\n\nSuffering, suffering baby cries.\n\nYou may reach Gethsemane but not with\n\nyour virginity!\n\nCarpenter, carpenter - not your seed!\n\nNow you know the whore she was -\n\ndead, defiled and bloody mass!\n\nSodomy, sodomy, impurity!\n\nHell will come without a doubt and\n\nyou will not be helping out!\n\nCrucifix, crucifix in your ass!\n\nRotting, dead, defiled and gone - so\n\nis said so be it done!\n\nWITH HORNA AND SARGEIST YOU RELEASE A LOT OF SPLIT VINYLS, DO YOU ALWAYS CHOOSE THE BAND ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SPLIT OR DOES THE LABEL SOMETIMES CHOOSE? DOES THE BAND YOU SHARE A VINYL WITH HAVE TO HAVE A SIMILAR VIEW ON THE SCENE AND BLACK METAL? DO YOU REGRET ANY SPLITS AND WISH THE OTHER BAND WAS NOT A PAST RELEASE?\n\nMost of the time the split releases are something I have suggested the other band in question. Some have been offered by labels and depending on interest we have either accepted or declined. The overall view doesnt necessarily have to be the same but there has to be something mutual to give reason for the split to exist. Ah yeah, there isnt much I regret but some splits have been really awful in the end. A good example is the split EP with Fog This was originally planned to be a split with Crucifier and I had sent all artworks and masters to Dork Horizon when they decided Crucifier wasnt good enough for it and insisted on having their own band Fog on the other side. At that point I spoke to other guys of the band and they rather wanted the split out instead of canceling entirely and that was a mistake. Im sure we couldve found a label whod done it like planned.\n\nIN OUR OLD INTERVIEW, YOU TOLD OF AN EARLY LIVE SHOW WHERE SOME FARMERS (??) THREATENED THE BAND WITH VIOLENCE AND THE POLICE HAD TO ESCORT YOU FROM THE SHOW? PLEASE GIVE US MORE DETAILS ON THIS, WAS IT IN REACTION TO SOMETHING DONE ON STAGE OR WAS IT MERELY BECAUSE YOU ARE A SATANIC BAND? IS THERE ANY OTHER CRAZY STORIES SURROUNDING LIVE SHOWS, REHEARSALS ETC OF HORNA?\n\nAhahaha, that was the fucking shit man. Those religious pigs were really there to stop us because we worship the devil and they feared we burn their church and what not. Those idiots had even stabbed all the tires from the car NEXT to my car. It later turned out it was the car of their local priest, ahahhaha. That was really freaked out, funny and frightening at the same time as the cops really saves our asses that day. We were indeed escorted 30 kilometres outside the village in case someone would have driven after us. That has to be the most absurd gig we ever did. Nothing beats this. Well, on the second gig there was supposed to be a band called Azazel playing too. Half of the band arrived to the venue, totally drunk and not having any intent to play either. The guitarist then obviously took some drugs as an hour later he was swimming in puddles with a ladies swimming suit on and croaking that he was a happy frog. I dont there has been any crazier happenings since those days 10 years ago. Everything else just pales in comparison. Anyhow, if I started to recall all sort of stuff Id make a fucken novel.\n\nDOES HORNA DO ANYTHING SPECIAL DURING LIVE SHOWS? I HEARD YOU TOURED WITH BEHEXEN AND THEY BAPTIZED THE AUDIENCE IN BLOOD, THREW RATS (I WAS AT SOME NUN-SLAUGHTER SHOWS AND THEY THREW ANIMAL BONES AND RATS AROUND AS WELL - THE AUDIENCE ABUSED THE CORPSES OF COURSE) AND A BIBLE INTO THE AUDIENCE  IS THIS SOMETHING HORNA ENJOYS LIVE?\n\nWith Horna we basically go out on stage and let it go, no holds barred. Its pure black energy. We never cared how well we play live and I think its not even the point to go there and show that you can play exactly like the shit was recorded. When being live it should really be something else, a mass ritual of rage and hatred. We have used some blood but in general we never bothered adding any external elements to our shows.\n\nDO YOU ENJOY PLAYING LIVE? IS THIS A PRIORITY FOR YOU? WHICH DO YOU PREFER PLAYING LIVE VS. REHEARSAL VS. RECORDING AND WHY? DO YOU FIND THE TRAVEL IN BETWEEN SHOWS AND EQUIPMENT SET UP TEDIOUS? DO YOU PLAY ANY COVERS LIVE OR IN REHEARSAL  WHICH ONES?\n\nPlaying live is definitely great from time to time. Its all up to the audience in the end. Give a good audience who get on with the music and it saves the day. On some gigs theres been so fucking weak feedback we simply cut our set in half and left the stage. We are no rockstars and wont play all the shit because they paid for it. If its not welcome then fuck off entirely. And traveling! Thats the fucking worst part in touring for sure, sitting hours on your ass with nothing better to do than get drunk. Being at a venue and waiting for the show is usually ok though I seriously hate rehearsing but recording and playing live are nice. Unfortunately nothing works without some rehearsing. Weve been playing a Beherit cover for years, thats about it. We have recorded some covers like Carpathian Forest or Motorhead, played some Slayer in the past as well as Rotting Christ and Emperor but its not really interesting nowadays. We dont have the time to let the focus be disturbed.\n\nWAS THERE A REASON TO SEPARATE YOUR MUSICAL CREATION WITH THE BIRTH OF SARGEIST? DID SARGEIST START FROM MATERIAL WRITTEN FOR HORNA BUT DID NOT FIT HORNAS DIRECTION? IS SARGEIST A MORE PURE EXPRESSION OF BLACK METAL OR JUST SOMETHING DIFFERENT? DO YOU FIND THE LYRICS OF HORNA AND SARGEIST ARE IN A VERY ALTERED PATH FROM EACH OTHER?\n\nAt the time when I saw Sargeist was needed the difference was huge regarding themes and ideas but as time passed by, Im not sure if Sargeist is needed now. The paths separated yet have unified again. During 2001/2002 when all this happened I was under a heavy creative mood, just writing and writing and I needed to channel it all out. Sargeist is entirely pure form of Black Metal, nothing but satanic praise and obscurity. With Horna I allow things expand to what ever extent possible, never letting go of the filthy old roots though.\n\nWHAT ARE YOUR OPINIONS ON THE FOLLOWING ALBUMS: VENOM BLACK METAL & KING DIAMOND ABIGAIL?\n\nAbigail has to be one of the best metal albums ever made. Period. Black Metal was and is an album I never got into in the past but nowadays I enjoy early Venom quite much. I am still more impressed by Bathory.\n\nAM I CORRECT THAT HORNAS LYRICS OFTEN DEAL MORE AND MORE WITH FINNISH NATIONALIST PRIDE? WHAT AREAS OF FINNISH HISTORY HAVE YOU COVERED AND WHICH AREAS DO YOU WISH TO DEAL WITH IN THE FUTURE? WHAT IS THE FINNISH SISU? DO YOU OFTEN SPEND TIME IN FORESTS AND NATURE OF FINLAND, DO YOU HUNT OR ANYTHING OF THIS SORT?\n\nWe havent touched so many topics actually. There is some reference to WW2 events and we have recorded a famous WW2 Finnish warmarch Oi Kallis Kotimaa (oprecious fatherland) which may lead to the assumptions we are more into it than before. Personally speaking this is true of course, I have mentioned my interests in interviews quite often. With Horna we stick still to the esoteric and occult foundations. Some thoughts and visions often cross paths though. For more nationalist ideas I am involved in a project called Blutschrei with Vilheim from Sombre Chemin and Ravenum from the local band Hammer. He was the drummer in Horna for a really short while before injuring his arm and being unable to play drums proper ever again. Anyhow, back to the questions. I get out each night when everyone else is sleeping (partly forced to take out the dog before sleeping) and enjoy the silence, the dark and cold. Specially this winter-time, it is soothing for my soul. I do not hunt but I have thought about it, specially interested in hunting with a bow instead of guns to keep it more natural. I love going fishing, haha Finnish sisu is guts, pride, loyalty, courage its the best example of true Iron Will.\n\nFOR ME, I AM A WAR BUFF AND I FIND THE FINNISH REPULSION OF THE SOVIET UNION IN WW2 A VERY INTERESTING AND GREAT EVENT. THE BATTLE OF SUOMUSSALMI (RAATE) WAS SKILLFUL AND THE FINNS CAPTURED RUSSIAN EQUIPMENT AND USED IT AGAINST THEM. THIS KIND OF FORCED THE FINNISH ARMY TO JOIN THE GERMANS DURING OPERATION BARBAROSSA WHAT IS YOUR OPINION ON THESE EVENTS? DOES THE HISTORY OF THE FINNISH CIVIL WAR, FENNOMNIA (PUBLICATION OF KALEVALA) AND ITS INDEPENDENCE (FROM SWEDEN & RUSSIA) INTEREST YOU? IS MILITARY SERVICE STILL COMPULSORY IN FINLAND AND HAVE YOU SERVED THERE AND WHAT AREA?\n\nThe service is still mandatory here. I was there in the beginning of 2000 in the fire commanding battery (or what ever its called in English) but not for long, they got rid of me for being too violent. I was into it but at the same time I couldnt take all the tossing around and obedience. Got a bit over-heated, used my fists against a commanding officer, out I went. Not the best end for it but at least I avoided jail which was good. I have become more and more interested in the WW2 history in Finland and Germany during the last couple of years yet running a label, bands and having two kids isnt leaving me with much time to focus on anything extra. Its a shame really, have tons of resource material to read and watch but no time to do any of it yet. Anyhow, Suomussalmi is one of the best examples what Finnish army can do in the winter, separating the enemy troops and destroying them one by one immobilizing every attempt to retreat nowhere. History also tells how badly the Red were prepared to fight during winter a million men with hundred guns and other shit. We were lucky even if skilled too. Interesting you should mention Fennomnia, I really wonder how many Finns actually know that without it there would be no language or culture like we have now most likely. Wed be talking fucking Swedish or wed be living this culture hidden like criminals.\n\nSOME FINNISH CULTURAL RELATED QUESTIONS: VIRPOMINEN IS THIS SOME KIND OF FINNISH VERSION OF TRICK OR TREATING ON HALLOWEEN? IS THE FINNISH WALPURGIS NIGHT, VAPPU STILL CELEBRATED WITH MUCH DRINKING OF ALCOHOL? WHAT IS GLÖGI AND DO YOU EVER DRINK IT? IS IT TRUE PEOPLE IN FINLAND EAT SOMETHING CALLED KALAKUKKO WHICH TRANSLATES INTO FISHCOCK IN ENGLISH?\n\nAlright, lets start the lesson. Virpominen is an old tradition where you would take a willow branch and go wave it at people wishing them health, happiness and a good year. It is kind of similar to Halloween in a way but you would usually go one week later on Easter to get a reward for it. Nowadays it is also connected to another tradition where kids dress up like witches anyhow, its now a fucken Christianized tradition so I dont care about it. Vappu is still the fucking king of all drinking nights, haha. It doesnt match even midsummer Juhannus or New Years Eve, its just crazy. Genuine glögi is a drink like your eggnog, instead a mix of juice, red wine and some herbs. It is drank only at Yule times anyway. Not bad but nothing special either. Kalakukko could indeed be translated like a fish rooster but the meaning is of older origin and actually means fish hidden. It is literally fish inside a rye cover. There is also slices or bits of pork inside to give the fish taste. Nowadays there are tons of variations of it but the only true one includes vendice.\n\nYOU HAVE YOUR OWN RECORDING STUDIO, WHAT KIND OF EQUIPMENT DO YOU USE? DO YOU PREFER ANALOG OR DIGITAL AND WHY? WHAT DO YOU THINK OF PRO TOOLS AND LOOPING AND SHIT? IT MUST ADD TO CREATIVITY HAVING THE CONTROL TO RECORD WHEN YOU WANT, HOW YOU WANT AND AS LONG AS YOU WANT? DO YOU ALSO MIX AND MASTER THE MUSIC YOURSELF?\n\nI go all analog. I used to have a digital working station but I was never satisfied with the sound I got from it so I sold it, got an old 8-tracker instead and thats been very good so far. I dont use any of Pro Tools but I know what it is. I only need some computer assistance in making masters of the music to send to pressing or to use directly as master sources for copying tape etc. I work everything I record from start to finish, including mixing and mastering. On some occasions I go for additional mastering at a local studio but not often anyhow. Its great to have the possibility to record exactly when we want indeed, the ideas are taken into reality as soon as possible instead of waiting for ages like so often if you wanted to go to an actual studio. I dont actually care much what I use when recording. From my experience the worst microphones are best for recording drums though, everything else goes pretty much based on the feeling with each session.\n\nLET US TALK ABOUT 2 REGRETTABLE RELEASES FROM THE PAST. THE FIRST IS OUT ON CANADIAN LABEL LOOKINGLASSBLACK RECORDS, A SPLIT VINYL WITH OUROBOROS, WHAT IS THE SITUATION SURROUNDING THIS? SECOND, IN THE BIO FOR THE ENVAATNAGS EFLOS  YOU MENTION HUADANKYLMYYDEN MAILLA IS NO LONGER (OR NEVER CONSIDERED) PART OF THE HORNA HISTORY AND NO SONGS FROM THIS ALBUM WILL BE PLAYED LIVE  Why? SPEAKING OF THIS LAST RELEASE, IS SOLISTITIUM RECORDS STILL ALIVE AND WAS THIS A BAD CONTRACT FOR YOU?\n\nThe split with Ouroboros itself wasnt really bad, only the label which did it. He didnt exactly send as many copies as agreed and turned out a real faggot with nothing to do with Black Metal and we made that clear. He seems to have disappeared entirely since then, no idea where he is or what he does and I couldnt care less. He tried to fool people into believing he was truly into it but the truth came out as it always does. Haudankylmyyden Mailla was created and recorded in about 3 months after we had just done Kohti Yhdeksän Nousua. That album was made without thinking twice, I had just lived through an ordeal and near-death experience, Moredhel whom I formed Horna with left during the studio session and things were fucking wrong. I still think that album has too many stolen ideas. Solistitium is called Omvina or something these days so they are still around. Our contract with them was never too bad, it just didnt lead where we wanted. Then again, I dont really know what the fuck we wanted during that time anyhow\n\nI READ THAT YOU ARE A NINTENDO FIEND, WHAT GAMES HAVE BECOME ADDICTIVE LATELY? WHAT OTHER INTERESTS DO YOU HAVE OUTSIDE OF MUSIC? ALSO WHAT BANDS ABUSE YOUR STEREO THE MOST IN RECENT MONTHS? DO I HAVE A HEARING PROBLEM OR DID I HEAR A RIFF ON THE SUDENTAIVAL ALBUM INFLUENCED BY THE CANADIAN BAND ANNIHILATOR?\n\nHaha, yeah, more or less, I just havent found the time to play anything in ages. I have all the games I want but I seriously lack time make kids and your life will be cut down in size when it comes to anything personal (Yes I know this very well as I have a child as well). Outside music I read some, watch movies, usual shit. During recent times Ive been giving my stereo all kind of stuff but nothing in particular that would have been spinning more than others. In my car Ive had for a while the entire Pearl Jam discography, haha. I think Ive never heard anything from Annihilator except Never, Neverland LP which I had years ago. Would be interesting to know what youve been hearing, at least my recollection doesnt find it.\n\nHORNA IS NOW AROUND FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. IS IT EASIER OR HARDER NOW TO COME UP WITH NEW MATERIAL AFTER ALL OF THESE YEARS? HAS SONG BUILDING / CRAFTING BECOME EASIER WITH EXPERIENCE? DO YOU WRITE MANY RIFFS OR PARTS AND JUST SAVE THEM ON TAPE OR MUST YOU ALWAYS CREATE A SONG FROM BEGINNING TO END BEFORE WORKING ON ANOTHER TRACK?\n\nInspiration is coming as often or seldom as it always has. I do not know when I get the moment again but so far it has always arrived at some point. Even now we have probably two albums worth of unfinished songs to work on so thats no problem at all. If we ever catch the current ideas then Id start to worry more about finding new inspiration. The way I compose I usually write riffs and song ideas to their final form on one take. If it doesnt feel right on the first attempt then I usually discard the whole thing. I have tons of notebooks filled with such ideas which may or may not become songs sometime. I guess everything is taking the test of time this way as well.\n\nTHE ÄÄNIÄ YÖSSÄ SEEMS LIKE A BIT OF A DIFFERENT RELEASE FOR HORNA, ESPECIALLY WITH THE SPEED OF THE HYMNS. WAS THIS INTENTIONAL AND IS THIS SOMETHING WHICH WE CAN EXPECT ON THE NEXT ALBUM? THIS RECENT ALBUM IS ON DEBEMUR MORTI PRODUCTIONS, HOW DID THIS DEAL COME ABOUT AND WILL YOU USE DIFFERENT LABELS BESIDES WOODCUT FOR FUTURE ALBUMS? ANY NEW VINYL PLANS IN THE WORKS?\n\nWoodcut is in the past now. We fulfilled out obligations to them and left as soon as possible. Things lead to a situation where he was simply talking bullshit all the time and doing nothing good for bands. He did handle things alright inside Finland but elsewhere it was a real pain to get anything to happen or done. We are very proud to have signed with Debemur Morti, they have done a perfect job so far and I had befriended Void who runs this label much earlier. Even if they say you shouldnt mix business and friends our dealings have proven that wrong. Next vinyls will actually be released together with Debemur Morti and Grievantee and are Ääniä Yössä LP and Horna/Sacrificia Mortuorum split LP. On this split LP you will see better what our future sounds like as its a mix of the speed we have usually had and the atmosphere of the last two albums coldest moments. We have simply create hypnotic, cold and oppressive Black Metal recently, this you will hear soon enough I think. Going back to Ääniä Yössä it was indeed intentionally made dragging and lethargic, lacking energy and instead approaching true grief and depression. I cant yet say if we are incorporating similar ideas in the future but it is possible, as much as is possible that we record another album of total slaughter.\n\nEXPLAIN HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT THE WAY THE SCENE GOES THESE DAYS, KEEPING IN MIND THINGS LIKE SNAIL MAIL LETTER WRITING, PHOTO-COPIED FANZINES, IRCS, TAPE TRADING, FLYERS, PRINTED FANZINES, DEMOS VERSUS EMAIL, WEBZINES, MP3S, DEMOS ON CDS (RECORDED ON HOME COMPUTERS) THAT DO NOT SOUND LIKE DEMOS, NO SNAIL MAIL CONTACTS (ONLY INTERNET ONES) ON FLYERS / RELEASES ETC\n\nCommunication is surely a lot easier and faster which is good most of the time. Then again, it has also made people expect answers and things to happen a lot faster than before which is just insane. If you dont reply a mail within a week you get another asking if it ever came through and other shit. Anyway, its still very handy and you can be reached fast when needed, all info is easier to process and so on. Among the things you mention are a lot I hate in the scene today those are webzines, demo cdrs and actually all cds made before the band is actually READY for a fucking album release, mp3 everywhere, P2P networks Tape trading is as good as dead, people are after everything in mp3 and its such a shame how even new vinyl releases are ripped and turned into mp3 for share, not to mention old demo tapes and so on. Everything must be at hand immediately, fast, there is no effort in finding anything with a long search that would gratify your quest once you finally got something worth seeking for 5 years. I totally support the old way of making zines, that is the only way I will even read it. The same for demos really, if its a tape I will take it and listen through as it shows already more dedication than spreading some links to mp3s or other downloadable sound samples. In fact, the best demos I have heard this year have ALL been tapes, there are no exceptions.\n\nOKAY I COULD GO ON LONGER BUT I THINK YOU WILL WANT TO STRANGLE ME IF I MAKE THIS INTERVIEW ANY LONGER. IT IS AN HONOUR BROTHER TO HAVE HORNA ONCE AGAIN IN THE PAGES OF CANADIAN ASSAULT! TELL US THE NEAR FUTURE PLANS OF HORNA AND SARGEIST TOO AND FEEL FREE TO SEND HAILS OUT TO ANY CONTACTS AROUND THE SCENE.\n\nAh no, it is my honour to be here again. Thanks for the support through all the years Dale! This has been one hell of a journey tonight. Sargeist are doing a split EP with Aosoth next, then its unsure what will happen and when. In addition to the two coming LPs on Debemur Morti & Grievantee Horna will be doing some split vinyl again, at least one with Legion Of Doom which should be out already and others. I wont tell more at the moment as nothing else is recorded than these so anything might change. Keep on checking for the news at our websites.\n\nwww.legion-horna.com"
