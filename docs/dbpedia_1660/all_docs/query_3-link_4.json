        "text": "Debemur Morti\n\nUlcerate – Stare into Death and Be Still Review\n\n“You’ve seen it happen. Your favorite band, who released some of the best records you’ve ever heard, who completely changed the way you thought about music, who could do no wrong, release a new record that you just can’t enjoy. You don’t know what to do. Maybe you lose some respect for the band. Maybe you lose some respect for yourself – for putting too much faith in your heroes or for failing to appreciate what must be a work of genius far beyond your understanding. It sucks. At least, I imagine it would. You see, I can’t relate to your shameful feelings because the band that reshaped my understanding of music was Ulcerate.” Stare into fanboyism.\n\nBlut Aus Nord – Hallucinogen [Things You Might Have Missed 2019]\n\n“Whichever the style, the quality of <'sb>Blut Aus Nord output never faltered. They could and have done whatever they wanted. Yet even in such a varied discography, their thirteenth LP Hallucinogen arrives as a sharp and expectedly unexpected detour. An ascendance to a higher celestial plane.” Black trip.\n\nWhite Ward – Love Exchange Failure Review\n\nAMG is on the case of the brand new White Ward release. Is that gumshoe on your shoe?\n\nCrimson Moon – Mors Vincit Omnia Review\n\n“Crimson Moon originated as a single-man black metal project in 1994, the creation of Scorpios Adroctonus. In 1998, he moved from America to Germany and expanded the project. But the output of Crimson Moon has been sparse, with only three albums since it was formed. The last was 2016’s Oneironaut, which impressed many (including our own Al Kikuras) with its expansive, but occasionally excessive, approach. Now the band is back with Mors Vincit Omnia (Death Conquers All) in, by their standards, record time. Is that occult itch about to be scratched?” Institutional blasphemy.\n\nTenebrae In Perpetuum – Anorexia Obscura Review\n\n“Black metal bands love to talk about how their take on the genre is the coldest, the harshest, the scariest, the blackest black metal that ever blacked. More often than not, all that talk of evil scariness is just braggadocio. Little variation separates one icy tremolo from another, and if you’ve seen one skinny corpse painted croaker, you’ve pretty much seen them all. That guy contorting his body into tortured positions, pulling at his face and rolling his eyes back while rasping about the annihilation of the psyche probably winds down backstage with a cucumber water and Candy Crush. Italian band Tenebrae In Perpetuum on the other hand might just be on to something sinister.” Fear the mind.\n\nThenighttimeproject – Pale Season Review\n\n“It’s been a hot minute since I even remotely touched anything Katatonia-related. That’s not out of complete and utter disownership of a great band, mind you. I’ve just been bombarded with so much doom and black metal that keeping up with them can be a bit difficult. So when word that former members the Brothers Norrman had not only put out a new October Tide album, but also the second full-length album from their prog-rock outfit Thenighttimeproject, I figured a reacquainting/discovery mission was in order.” Night shift.\n\nLatitudes – Part Island Review\n\n“I have historically shown more than a little apprehension towards the post-metal tag. At first, I felt it screamed pretension, a trait that tends to break my enjoyment of music if not kept in check. Lately, though, I’ve reassessed my opinion after finding deep enjoyment of bands often placed within the post-metal spectrum—Astronoid, Downfall of Gaia, and more recently, Latitudes.” No man is Part Island.\n\nAoratos – Gods Without Name Review\n\nThis post has been removed because it promoted Nazi or Nazi-adjacent metal bands or musicians. We apologize.\n\nKaleikr – Heart of Lead Review\n\n“Iceland’s black metal scene is one of the world’s most singular, with bands like Misþyrming and Zhrine combining some of the dissonance of French bands with the Earthy atmospheres of the Cascadian scene while oddballs Sólstafir fall in with psychedelia and krautrock. Some of the most well-received black metal of the early decade came roaring out of Reykjavík, and with an impressive roster of active bands there’s sure to be more to come. Much like New Zealand, the island nation has gained most of its notoriety in the metal world in the last ten years, but unlike New Zealand, very little of that notoriety has gone to death metal. Kaleikr have a thing or two to say about that.” Death on ice."
