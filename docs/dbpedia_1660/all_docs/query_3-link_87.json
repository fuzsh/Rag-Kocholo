        "text": "Drummer extraordinaire, Jamie Saint Merat, and New Zealand-based death metal trio Ulcerate will unleash their anticipated sixth album, Stare Into Death And Be Still, on April 24th via new label home Debemur Morti Productions.\n\nThe unmistakable sound of Ulcerate finds its emotional apex on Stare Into Death And Be Still, as the band emerges from the claustrophobia and dissonance of their recent past to present a next-level exploration of melody, harmony, and power. The band’s signature, ultra-atmospheric blend of unorthodox death metal with the textures of futurist black metal is here pared-down with the consummate hand of experience, giving stunning credence to the riff, the song, and the meaning.\n\nEmbracing production clarity, Ulcerate uses these songs to fully showcase their otherworldly musicianship: a vocal performance from Paul Kelland of unadulterated authority, Michael Hoggard’s guitar, and Jamie Saint Merat’s percussion working in tandem with startling skill and originality, simultaneously skewed and heart-rending, often addictively succinct and reveling in strident motifs that hook, haunt and transform the listener with their expressive honesty.\n\nThematically, the album explores the concept of “death reverence” – drawing on recent personal experience to confront the truism that death and tragedy aren’t always sudden or violent, that people are often passive observers trapped “in the silent horror of observing death calmly and cleanly.”\n\nStare Into Death And Be Still is the deepest, purest, and most meticulous form of Ulcerate: a soul-searching conflagration of atypical melodicism, immaculate virtuosic dexterity, and sublimated psychological upheaval. A breathtaking new beginning for one of the most uniquely talented bands in extreme music.\n\nStare Into Death And Be Still will be released on CD, LP, and digital formats.
