Harmony Of Null Mater\n\nFeaturing the band’s previously internet-only released two EPs - 2007’s &quot;Interlude Premier&quot; and 2012’s &quot;Interlude Second&quot; - for the first time on CD, &quot;Monolithe Zero&quot; will allow many MONOLITHE followers to listen to those songs for the first time, as well as two cover songs, one of them never having been released before.\r\n\r\nOriginally released in two sections, &quot;Interlude Second&quot; &#39;s song &quot;Harmony Of Null Matter&quot; is delivered in its full, uninterrupted 36 minutes version.\r\n\r\nThe entire track list has been remastered and wrapped-up in fantastic new artwork by visual master Robert Høyem.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the harsh, heavy, almost brutal atmospheres of &quot;Monolithic Pillars&quot; to the eerie, ethereal and spacey experimentalism of &quot;Harmony Of Null Matter&quot;, &quot;Monolithe Zero&quot; is a new, not-to-be-missed, 65-minute ticket to the cosmic mind trip the band’s music usually provides.",
