        "text": "I got recommended this album from a friend a couple of weeks ago but it’s been quite far down the backlog of reviews I’ve wanted to do it has had to wait until now. I got to start with saying wow! What is this? White Ward are experimenting with and crushing boundaries of black metal as it is nothing! Saxophone in black metal? Why not? Taake has used a banjo so put that it in the genre too! The thing is it works, most of the time. The passages between traditional black, post-black and basically jazz works so well I am stunned. As this is my very first listen to the band and their music I did not think anyone really did this type of music. I mean jazz-post-black metal!?\n\nThing is though I do find this music a bit weird for my personal taste, due to the jazz influences. I do love the fact White Ward are doing this and I am sure it will be in many peoples album of the year lists but I would actually like this album more if it had, well less sax in it. It’s a cool thing and does make me go “wow you can do that!?” at first but after a 40 minute album I am not too sure anymore. I mean Stillborn Knowledge is a freaking great song, as are most of the songs on the album. One by one. When I listen to the whole album though I don’t get swallowed up in it like some has. Basically what I am saying is this jazz-post-black metal isn’t really my thing for a full album but I am sure I will listen to their songs every know and then for the sake of their creativity. I like my post-black metal without the jazz. A shame, I really hoped I would love this album and I feel like I should but I just don’t. Not my kind of jam, but I am still stunned with a band breaking boundaries like this, so if you’re reading this do give White Ward a try. Who knows you might come to love this type of thing.\n\nFutility Report is out now through Debemur Morti Productions.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/whitewardofficial\n\nLabel: Debemur Morti Productions\n\nFor fans of: Ulver and Agalloch\n\nFavorite song: Stillborn Knowledge\n\nNamed after a region in England called The Fens, Fen have since their formation in 2006 made a big name for themselves in the atmospheric black metal scene. The band members grew up in this mysterious landscapes, with marshes and wetlands, and this is where they’ve found the inspiration for their music. Winter is the bands fifth full-length release and it’s been three years since their latest masterpiece Carrion Skies.\n\nFen are one of those bands that brings you epic songs which, more often than not, goes past the ten minute mark. I know this isn’t for everyone just due to the length and you’re probably afraid that you will lose interest halfway through the song. I urge you not to let time be a factor for giving this one a miss, you owe it to yourself to get embraced by this cold and bleak winter that Fen offers you. It’s an album that should be experienced as a whole, which fans of Fen (and quite a few other atmospheric black metal bands) should know by now. It might not be an album where you turn on a song on your way to work which takes 5-10 minutes but see it as an audiovisual journey instead.\n\nThe Winter starts somewhat warm and gently. It’s that time of the year where you’re not entirely sure what to wear as the climate hasn’t truly become cold. Then the snapping cold hits and all of a sudden it’s a harsh icy landscape. This is portrayed in the opening song I: (Pathway) as the beginning of Winter is upon us. The songs smoothly transitions on the album, making this an even greater experience to the listener who wants to not only hear but to feel the Winter breeze.\n\nIn many ways this is the perfect way to give tribute for the ten years Fen have existed. It brings an interesting concept, with an atmosphere that’s fitting Winter and a journey in mysterious landscapes of darkness and sorrow. This is Fen at it’s finest and you should allow yourself to be absorbed and fully embrace this journey you’re about to take in the cold Winter. It captures the season from start to finish, ending with VI (Sight) that makes you feel that spring might even be coming soon.\n\nFen’s fifth full-length release Winter is out now through Code666 Records.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/fenofficial\n\nFor fans of: Agalloch and Alcest\n\nFavorite song: V (Death)\n\nFirst of all I have to start with saying that The High Heat Licks Against Heaven has to be one of the most beautiful album covers I’ve laid my eyes on. That in itself made Nidingr capture me and want me to listen to the album. So who are Nidingr? Nidingr started off as a solo project in 1992, then named Audr (old Norse Auðr: meaning ‘desolate, empty’), by Teloch (Mayhem). He was eventually joined by Blargh (ex-Dødheimsgard) in 1996 and they changed their name to Nidingr (old Norse: Níðingr, an insult meaning ‘scoundrel, a person of hatred and sin’). The band started as a pure Norwegian black metal act but later on changed their style to a more black and death hybrid with a viking theme. During the years the members have changed and Nidingr now consists of founder Teloch together with Øyvind Myrvoll (ex-Dødheimsgard, ex-Myrkur, ex-God Seed (all live)) on drums, Cpt. Estrella Grasa (Kort Prosess) on vocals and Sir (ex-God Seed, Djerv, Gaahls Wyrd, ex-Myrkur (live)) on bass. As you can see that’s some high profile names and that’s always been the case with Nidingr. The High Heat Licks Against Heaven is the bands fourth full-length album.\n\nThe music is very dark, there is an atmosphere on this album that speaks of Ragnarok. The lyrics are full with raids, tales of old, death and destruction. The tempo on the songs varies a lot, The Ballad of Hamther having that agressive Norwegian black metal feel to it, whereas On Dead Body Shore they play more of the black and death hyrbid the likes of Behemoth are famous for. Just to on the track after, Gleipnir, slow it down and it becomes almost a sludge and doom fest. I think the difference in approaches while keeping the red line on the songs is Nidingr’s strong point. It’s something special about Nidingr that I can’t really put a name on it. It’s just good music that’s different but really well made from veterans in the Norwegian black metal scene who knows what they are doing. There’s even some well known guests on the tracks Ash Yggdrasil and Naglfar is Loosed, as Garm of the band Ulver and Myrkur makes appearances.\n\nI didn’t like every single track on the album, simply because of the different approaches to them. I would say it’s the same for me and Enslaved, I love what they do for the viking metal scene but some songs are just not for me. However I do respect what Nidingr does just as well and there are a few tracks here I will definitely go back to at times. The album as a whole is a cool piece of black metal that fans of Enslaved, Helheim and Dødheimsgard will like. Nidingr – The High Heat Licks Against Heaven is out now through Indie Recordings.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/nidingr\n\nTwitter: http://www.twitter.com/NIDINGR\n\nFor fans of: Helheim and Dødheimsgard\n\nFavorite song: On Dead Body Shore\n\nArt. That’s the only word I need to describe Forndom. This is not simply music, this is art. This is expressing emotions and a way of life through sound as well as the artwork and live performances. Let me copy a line taken from the record label Nordvis, one of my favorite labels, “We aim to work with musicians who build their musical creations around old native traditions, folklore & the great outback”. Forndom does exactly that. You might have heard of Wardruna before but you should definitely learn to remember Forndom.\n\nI can’t help but to get taken away by this kind of music. It is so atmospheric and brings harmony to my very soul. I saw Wardruna live a few weeks ago and it was honestly one of the best experiences I’ve ever had in my live. There is something special with the old ways and instruments that sweeps you away to a world long lost to many. The man behind the Forndom project is L. Swärd. Inspired by Scandinavian folklore he has brought forward a masterpiece that will surely calm your spirit and take you into the wild.\n\nLonging for something in the same musical realm as Wardruna? Then Formdom’s Dauðra Dura will a must have.\n\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/Forndom\n\nFor fans of: Wardruna and Ulver\n\nFavorite song: Svitjod"
