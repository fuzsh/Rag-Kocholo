        "text": "Walls around torment me I hear voice in silence What? That can not be Again drowned in violence Musty odour in the coffin Of injured consciousness Overflow me with a medley Of pain, anguish and regret Trembling hands fumble in The void, in blind howling mess Life! The life I seek But still come upon walls in darkness Endless maze of stone and sorrow Conceals remains of me I found truth - became a dust, dry and hollow At the foot of the wall Leaden clouds reflect in still eyes While I take roots in all-embracing walls\n\nCrunch of stained-glass windows Under bare feet Luminescent anguish Of everyday retreat Consubstantiality Of discrepant wills Breakes against mortality Forces me to knees Punishment of being old Till the end of time Everlasting pain and cold Rational decline Here I stand, obsessed old man Blinded, on the very brink Downpour is whipping me With indelible ink My gift became damnation My incarceration I'm stuck here for the ages I'm doomed to be old man Sentinels on guard of death Cannot let me in I'm deprived of their excuse I've invented a new sin I am doomed to be old man Old man Insusceptibility To the flames of guilt Made me perfect innocent My emotions (are) sealed Physical infirmity Continual decay Two centuries of suffering of living every day\n\nSeeking after the oblivion After end of masquerade Roam about the broken bridges Over rivers full of blades Gloomy silence reigns in ether Soul answers the same way Nothing leaves us scanty hope There's no reason to withstand Mocking voices Stinging laugh These walls are driving mad Hateful silence Fills the streets And Moon turns into red Gargoyles watch me from the rooftops With ancient evil in their eyes I'm completely consent to them If you're guilty - pay the price So tear me to pieces For I go mad Inhale my dispair And make me dead ...make me dead\n\nBefuddling fog hangs low on water Concealing faces of the mossy drowned men Children of thy Gods, all misbegotten ones Gained their peace in dance of black waves In disregard they look towards the skies Wrapped up with silt and mellow seaweed Salt water brood, immune to Love or Blight Nonfluctuating whole point of life Veins without blood, lifeless shrunk containers Tie up the bed of the exhausted world Drowned in cold, ancient plains and mount ridges Hide from all eyes dead shell of days\n\nI am the breath of breeze Over rippled stars' reflection Ageless child of the Sea Sculpting waves until perfection I am roar of the surf The lullaby sang by the Ancients Only the Sea I serve All drowned men - my immolations\n\nWhere sky meets the ocean, where wind is standstill The lonesome blue whale awaits for reveal Principal of planet, Leviathan of Deep Hovers in darkness in millennial sleep Circled by narwhals, spearmen of Gulf Sire of mammals is safe on behalf Coldness and pressure, depths of arcane Shelter blue giant, save God from men\n\nWalls around torment me, I hear voice in silence What? That can not be Again drowned in violence White eternity my coffin The life, what drifting in mirror... My life empty, my life - as sin Real is gone away... far away... Hours turn into years I'm drowning in time Shadows through windowpane Pull your hands on me Voice filled my world I was speechless Trying to scream And all of a sudden ended No more can, all stopped Falling around grey days Happy? the meaning? existence? No, only walls... White eternity my coffin The life, what drifting in mirror... My life empty, my life - as sin Real is gone away... far away...\n\nGuilty if I, I don't believe love? Guilty if I, That is not sing, and shout? Guilty if I, That all the hate me? Guilty! Guilty! I don't see the point in life. Just hold on to a straw. That slowly falls, In cold grave of your joy. Guilty if I, That your face like the back? Guilty if I, That all the words as fallen leaves? Guilty! Guilty! Freedom! You are no more. As long as I can, See your faces, your back.\n\nWelcome to the world of the closed graves. Where you nothing mean. Welcome, to the world of slaves. Where home - A white crypt. In crowds of people lose yourself, Everything roads rule in emptiness. The madness consumed the mad, Come age of great joyness, Welcome, to the world of faceless, Where light and darkness mixed in sins. Welcome, to the world of dreams, That lost under alien control. In crowds of people lose yourself, Everything roads rule in emptiness. The madness consumed the mad, Come age of great joyness, Outside the door - Empty, she solid. And in it - The same soulless. Is it worth to endure the void, Or fill it with faceless? Don't look for a sense, Separate walls of illusions, The great age essence, Will give you crazy visions."
