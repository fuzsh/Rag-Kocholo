        "text": "Well, here we are again. Another year is coming to a close, and it’s time for all writers and other enthusiasts of Extreme Metal to highlight the releases that get us through said year. You know how this goes by now, it’s time for me to submit my contribution and give my 50 picks for 2019. I started doing top 50s last year and I might as well keep that going, because it’s been a pretty damn good year and there’s again, too many to just make a measly top 30. As always, there were bangers, disappointments, duds, things that got overhyped and overlooked, divisiveness ran rampant, bands were canceled on Twitter, blah, blah, whatever, but overall, Extreme Metal continues to thrive. I’m not gonna get into a whole spiel about how my year was personally, because who the fuck cares? Let’s just get into it and talk about my picks for the cream of the crop for 2019.\n\nSo, without any further adieu, here it is. My Top 50 of 2019:\n\n50. Blue Hummingbird on the Left: Atl Tlachinolli (Nuclear War Now! Productions/Iron Bonehead Producions)\n\nOne of the early bangers that 2019 dropped on us, the Black Twilight Circle strikes again with one of the best releases to come from that circle yet. This is Blackened Death Metal that celebrates it’s Aztec roots, with a sound that resembles the sweltering heat of Mexico and the cavernous desolation of Hell itself. The spirit of Blasphemy is very well-present in this band’s sound and it shows like a stain on white clothing. This is hellish, nasty and barbaric Blackened Death, with an oppressive atmosphere to it, that suffocates you as it hammers your head in with those meaty riffs and blasting ferocity. As extreme and blasphemous as it can get when it comes to Blackened DM being done right. Another staple release of the Black Twilight Circle and a great pick up for Nuclear War Now! and Iron Bonehead Productions!\n\n49. Deadspace: Dirge (Talheim Records)\n\nThe first new album I listened to and reviewed this year. Deadspace is a quite overlooked band, on the same stylistic boat as Depressive Black Metal heavyweights like Lifelover, Psychonaut 4 and Shining. Their sound used to be pretty unconventional for the genre, going a more clean, melodic route, but for this one, they made a complete 180 and embraced their cold, grim roots, leaving the clean vocals, melody and catchiness that sweetened their sound behind. This is more of a straight-up Black Metal album, that conveys the most negative of emotions, through desolate landscapes and pace-shifting, tremolo riff-ridden blasts of 2nd wave ferocity. I dug what they were doing prior to this, but like I said in my review, somewhere in the middle of my first listen, I realized I like this Deadspace better. Dark, demented and searingly despondent. Underrated reease by and underrated act.\n\n48. Olkoth: The Immortal Depths & Treasures of Necromancy (Signal Rex)\n\nThis is technically a compilation of 2 demos, but whatever. More traditional Black Metal, but with unique twist. Olkoth are raw and well-rooted, but adds a bit of a melodic flavor to their sound and make it work. It’s not overbearing and it doesn’t overshadow anything. If anything, it contributes to the cold, bleak desolation of the old school Black Metal sound and keeps things fresh and engaging. I was surprised by how well blended both sides were and that made it one of my favorite Black Metal releases of the year. Just as grim and vicious as your typical Raw Black Metal act who know how to play their instruments and transcend the stigma that the sub-genre gets these days, especially the more forward-thinking fans who prefer progression and experimentation. This IS a form of progression to me and I really fucking dug it. Great Black Metal that should have been talked about more this year!\n\n47. Lord Mantis: Universal Death Church (Profound Lore Records)\n\nIn my opinion, one of the best Sludge bands going today, have outdone themselves witht his one! Lord Mantis add a certain flair to their sound, upping the ante with some Death Metal-like riffs and overall structure of sound and atmosphere. Building from their earlier style of nasty, angry Blackened Sludge, to implementing other elements into it, like said DM riffs and a little bit of an Eyehategod feel, specifically in the vocals, with an apocalyptic atmosphere around it. It’s beautifully chaotic and ruthlessly aggressive, matching right up with it’s title. If a Universal Death Church was a real thing, whatever that may entail, this is the exact soundtrack that should accompany it. Easily the band’s best and most transcendent work yet, furthering their name into the upper echelon of Sludge and maybe even beyond.\n\n46. Gatecreeper: Deserted (Relapse Records)\n\nGatecreeper are as divisive as it gets, when it comes to being one of the more hyped bands in Extreme Metal today, which I touche on my piece on obscurity and how scarce it’s become nowadays, but that didn’t stop me from thoroughly enjoying this knuckle-dragging, face-beating riff-driven, old school style Death Metal with a modern twist to it. It’s a classic Kurt Ballou-produced Death Metal album, with that heavy, dense production value, a la Vallenfyre or Misery Index, and it’s well pulled-off by these desert-dwelling neanderthals. Every bit as good as Sonoran Depravation, which I still jam out to this day, maybe even better. Straight Death Metal that kicks you in the face and leaves you for dead in the dry, humid, unforgiving desert. Fuck the haters, not everything has to be cavernous and elaborately structured. Gatecreeper are the real deal and deserve their hype far more than many other bands who are hyped to the moon do. Baby, it’s hot outside.\n\n45. Vargrav: Reign in Supreme Darkness (Werewolf Records)\n\nIt’s no secret how I feel about Symphonic Black Metal. I’ve carried that sentiment for years. This year, however, we got two examples of how it should be done and both restored my faith in the sub-genre just a little bit. First, this cold, desolate piece of Emperor-worshiping art that captures the same essence that In the Nightside Eclipse created all those years ago, that I fell in love with as a teenager. It’s the closest I’ve ever heard an album come to duplicating the same sound and feel, while putting it’s own spin on it. The keyboards serve as the backbone that adds to the foggy production, giving it that chilling atmosphere that compliments the instrumentation. Everything is so well-placed and nothing really sounds out of order or messy, fuck, dare I even say, that some tracks are even better than those of their afflatus. The best way I can describe this album is haunting, in every way possible, and it succeeds where so many bands fail, or just don’t give a shit to succeed in. THIS is how it’s done.\n\n44. Exhumed: Horror (Relapse Records)\n\nDeathgrind masters, Exhumed, who’s last few outings I found underwhelming, made a comeback that I didn’t see coming by a mile. Simply put, this album brings back the punch that albums like Gore Metal, Slaughtercult and even All Guts, No Glory brought to the table, and keeps that energy throughout all 15 tracks. This is a quick album, clocking in at only 36 minutes long (it’s a Grind album, so duh), but it does what it needs to and crams as many fast, intense riffs and hammering blasts as humanly possible, and doesn’t let up from start to finish. Definitely Exhumed’s best album in a while, with classic Horror VHS-inspired artwork that I can always appreciate. No way I could leave this one off the list.\n\n43. Black Knife: Spell Caster (Husk Records)\n\nBlackened Punk continues to run rampant and grow going into 2020, and this gem is one of the best examples of that! Black Knife play devilish Blackened Punk with everything that attracts me to the sub-genre; aggression, catchiness, precision and filth. The Motorhead influence is real and clear on this one and it shows, in the grooves and 70s style Heavy Metal riffage. Gad I came across this monster, especially in the midst of all the Devil Master hype. These guys should be recognized just as much and I’m sure they will in the near future.\n\n42. Whiskey Ritual: Black Metal Ultras (Folter Records)\n\nWhat do you get when you take a little Marduk, mix it with some GG Allin-style sleaze, the aggression and spite of other Punk gems like Antiseen, Gang Green, The Murder Junkies, etc, you get one of the best Blackened Punk acts around and their best release yet. Like I said in my brief review of this one back in July, there’s a much heavier influence on the Punk elements of their sound on this album, to the point where it can be classified as more of a Punk album than BM. It’s still as much of a Whiskey Ritual album as the other three are and it’s just as much of a filthy sleazefest! Just a raw, 0-fucks-given head-smashing of catchy riffs, gnarly grooves and spiteful, snarling vocals. A ot of people cite Midnight as the best act doing this style, but no one holds a candle to these motherfuckers in my opinion. pure grime through and through!\n\n41. Musmahhu: Reign of the Odious (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nThe latest project by mastermind, Swartadauþuz, this time, going down the desolate path of Death Doom, and pulling it off damn well. This is dark, crushing and sounds like the soundtrack to being lost in a deep, dark cave somewhere, in the midst of the apocalypse, presumably alone and entrenched in silence and the prospect of danger looming in the shadows around you. I put this above even the more recognized acts of the cavernous Death Metal style that are much more hyped and revered, like Triumvir Fowl, Dagger Lust, Abysal, Grave Miasma and so on. This one brings a whole new level of darkness and desolation to the table and has done it the best out of the rest of them this year. I don’t know what exactly it is that brings out such power in Musmahhu’s sound that makes it stand out, but it works and it makes for an absolute Death Doom ripper. Maybe it’s the genius of Swartadauþuz, or maybe something that I hear in it, but fuck it, it’s great stuff and more than worthy of a spot here!\n\n40. Deus Mortem: Kosmocide (Terratur Possessions)\n\nThis is a band I was unaware of, until it reared it’s ugly head at me with this album and they hype behind it. I’m glad it did, because this is modern Black Metal done right, with just the right kind of atmosphere to it, that pulls from the more traditional sects of the genre and uses it as groundwork to build it into something unique, but still cold and searing, without getting too messy and straying too far from the point. The chaos is there and definitely channeled through the roots of old, which was immediately evident through tracks like Remorseless Beast and The Soul of the Worlds. There are also parts that sound like more chaotic versions of tracks from A Blaze in the Northern Sky or even an early Gorgoroth album, which is a very good thing. Atmospherically chaotic and full of uniquely gripping riffs, shifting tempos and great vocal work. One of the better modern style BM albums I’ve heard this year, that I mistakenly slept on for a bit. My attention has been obtained by Deus Mortem for sure.\n\n39. Encoffination: We Proclaim Your Death o’ Lord (Selfmadegod Records)\n\nWhen you look at the logo of this act, I’m sure most would roll their eyes at the TOTALLY not obvious Incantation influence, but fuck me if I didn’t enjoy this one for what it is. This is cavernous Death Doom at it’s darkest and most menacing. I hate to make another tired Incantation comparisons that so many bands get these days, but the influence is too obvious to deny here. Nonetheless, it takes the cavernous DM sound and slows it down into a dense, rumbling void of sound, with a production style that makes everything basically vibrate in your ear and an atmosphere as oppressive and suffocating as being in stuck in a windowless room, in a burning building in Louisiana, in the dead of summer, with no AC, maybe even worse. This band’s sound is a true personification of Hell itself and although it’s pretty blatant, the Incantation worship is at least done right. One of the best and most stomach-churning Doom albums I’ve heard this year, no exaggeration!\n\n38. Gold: Why Aren’t You Laughing? (Artoffact Records)\n\nI’m usually not too keen on Post-Metal, or anything with “Post” in front of it, save for Post-Punk, but Gold is an anomaly that made itself an exception to that rule. The best way I can describe this, is a combination of energetic Post-Metal, with a good deal of heaviness to it, a little hint of Post-Punk and Alternative, plus a small seasoning of Doom. It’s a weird mix, but somehow it all comes together in a strange but pretty captivating way. It’s melodically structured, and strikes a really good middle ground between heavy and catchy, to the point where I wasn’t sure whether or not to classify this as non-Metal. It rests somewhere between, which is what makes it unique, while not being too hipstery. Glad I discovered this when I did, it was a lock for a spot on this list from my first listen. Can’t remember the last time something of this nature sent chills down my spine, the way this did.\n\n37. Asagraum: Dawn of Infinite Fire (Edged Circle Productions)\n\nThe first time I heard Asagraum, I wasn’t a big fan, but their first album grew on me after giving it a second chance. This album takes things to a whole new level and solidifies my liking of them. These gals play the straightforward, no frills, bullshit-free style of modern Black Metal, a la Marduk, Watain and Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult, that just wants to beat you over the head with a relentless wave of blasts, intense riffs, that shift from fast tremolo picking, to groovy chords. with slightly varying tempos to it, ranging from fast, to super fast and strident. It’s Mardukism at it’s most Marduk-y and it’s done right and well! Not the most groundbreaking form of Black Metal, but it’s quality Black Metal done by women not named Myrkur… which isn’t saying much, but it’s still something. Great stuff.\n\n36. Saturnus Terrorism: Pamphlet (Independent)\n\nI don’t really go out of my way to explore genres anymore. As I get older, my desire and energy to do so has dwindled. I guess being a busy adult does that to you. This band however, is one of the better, more obscure discoveries I’ve made through some boredom-induced label-exploring. Saturnus Terrorism offers an aggressive, strident form of Black Metal, that’s somewhat skates the line of modernity, but has a rawness to it, that blurs said line and does pretty much whatever it wants. It has a good dynamic to it, with ranging paces, slowing it down when it needs to and unleashing itself on you and turning the aggression up when the time is right. Top it off with some nasty, bellowing vocals and some awesome, well-placed riffs and you got one of the best French Black Metal releases this year! Very overlooked release by a band that’ll make waves in the underground in the near future.Remember he name and keep an eye out!\n\n35. Sanguisugabogg: Pornographic Seizures (Maggot Stomp)\n\nAhh, yes. The musty, smelly beast known as Sanguisugabogg, who’s made quite a name for itself this year, got me on board for fucking sure! This EP is a dirty, grimy, groovy Death Metal filthfest, with some of the meatiest, neanderthalic riffs and swampy, stomping snare-smashing, with the slimiest and mustiest of atmosphere’s, sounding like the musical equivalent of a garbage dump, filled with dead body parts and maggot-filled junkie corpses. One of the filthiest releases of the year, appropriately under the Maggot Stomp umbrella, who I think are the current masters of putting out the most putrid of old school Death Metal goodness! Can’t wait to see what this sleazy beast comes out with next. For anyone into the most knuckle-dragging style of OSDM.\n\n34. Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult: Mardom (War Anthem)\n\nAside from being at the helm of the revival of the old Bethlehem, and putting out the second album of said revival, which you’ll be hearing about shortly (spoiler alert), Onielar got back behind the mic for her main project and delivered another hell of a banger with that too! Darkened Nocturn Slaughtercult need no introduction at this point, both their presence and music speak for themselves and neither have to say much. Much like the new Asagraum album, which I just talked about, Mardom displays the more punishing side of Black Metal, that mercilessly brings the hammer down on you, in the form of sharp, well-executed riffs, relentless double-bass blasting, visceral shrieks and an atmosphere to it that resembles being dead center of an all out war. I also love how Onielar’s vocal style changes between projects to fit each respective one, from the tortured, manic howls in Bethlehem, to said more visceral style for this. DNS only gets more and more vicious with each release, and I’d definitely call this their best work yet. I said early in the year that Onielar was going to make two appearances on my year-end list, and alas!\n\n33. Have a Nice Life: Sea of Worry (The Flenser)\n\nOne of the better Shoegaze acts around today with their third and dare I say, best album to date. Have a Nice Life combine somber Shoegaze, with dreary Post-Punk and a hint of experimentation with both sides, creating an atmospheric dream of melancholic sound, melody and tone, with much more dynamic to it than you’d notice on your first listen. To me, their sound rests somewhere between the Gothic Rock-oriented Darkwave of Dead Can Dance, the despondency of Giles Corey, and the black and white fogginess of bands like Planning for Burial and Wreck & Reference, with a hint of upbeatness to it. Very riveting stuff that goes the extra mile to either enamor you into depression or uplift you out of it, depending on your mood. So, fix yourself a nice, hot cup of coffee, sit down in a dark, quiet room, put some headphones on and see where it takes you. They’re an exception to my Shoegaze rule for a reason. This album is all you need to hear to know why.\n\n32. Raw Hex: Always High, Always Low (Closed Casket Activities)\n\nThe AC//13 is back with a fucking vengeance! Like I said in my recent mini-review of this, Raw Hex bring back everything I love about the AC///13 crew and throw it right back in your face, letting you know that it’s not going to go down easily. Take the head-crushing fury of Young and in the Way and the grinding speed of Votnut and roll it into one, and you get this absolute monster of Blackened Grind, that sonically tramples you from start to finish. That same “fuck you” attitude and Punk sleaziness is reincarnated into an even colder form and grinds over your eardrums with no fucking remorse to show you afterward. Just a quick and painful beating, in the form of some of the most well-played and precise Blackened, Punk-infused Grindcore you’ll hear all year, picking right up where it’s predecessors left off and avenging their demises with their spirits right there with it. Hopefully this one is here to stay. FUCK THIS LIFE!\n\n31. Devourment: Obscene Majesty (Relapse Records)\n\nThe long-awaited new album by the kings of Brutal Death and bringing the slamz. Devourment kicked things up several notches and broke the pattern of being underwhelming, compared tot heir classics like Molesting the Decapitated and Butcher the Weak. Obscene Majesty brings back the trampling brutality, with a disgusting, chunky tone and that devastating punch to it, that harkens back to those early albums and models itself after it. Just a fucking barrage of meaty guitars, thick, bassy drums, that relentlessly hammer you with ruthless precision. Pure neanderthalic ignorance from start to finish. Expect nothing less from the torchbearers of Brutal Death Metal.\n\n30. Mayhem: Daemon (Century Media Records)\n\nI can’t tell you how worried I was, when this one was announced. With the polarizing nature of everything they put out since De Mysteriis dom Sathanas, with the verious experimental paths their sound took, all the way up to Esoteric Warfare, which was met with a LOT of scrutiny among the Black Metal purist group. Darkthrone’s latest album was one thing, they dug themselves out of the slump they spent over a decade in with Arctic Thunder in 2016 and only got better with it for Old Star, but Mayhem were a totally different story with where they were going. four years after their last album, and ESPECIALLY considering them now being under Century Media, this one could have gone either way, but fuck me if it didn’t deliver in an unexpected way. This album is a return to form in a unique way, it brings back the darkness and signature vibe of DMdS, but keeps things fresh and precise, and abandons most of the needless experimentation that’s hindered their sound for the last almost 20 years. It’s more straightforward and to the point, which leaves more room for the riffs to shine through (most of which are very good), and allows you to know what the fuck you’re listening to and enjoy it. Great riffs, varying tempos, chaotic atmosphere and an all-around energetic listen. Anyone who didn’t like it likely only listened to it once and casted it aside. Without question, Mayhem’s best work in fucking years and took me by surprise. Spot on this list was earned, for sure.\n\n29. Coffins: Beyond the Circular Demise (Relapse Records)\n\nCrawling ashore from across the sea in Tokyo, comes the debut full-length by Death Doom monsters, Coffins, which I predicted on Twitter a couple months prior to it’s release, was going to be a fucking banger. Call me Nostradamus, because I was beyond right. I wish I had the chance to give this one a full review, which I had to call off due to time constraints, but this is a top-tier extreme Doom Metal album if there ever was one. Thick, meaty, bassy, crushing and well executed, with massive riffs, muddy, pounding drums, slow and patterned, with volatile outbursts of blast-beats that sneak up on you when you least expect it, and topped off with equally massive bellowing vocals. Just downright evil and nasty, through and through. Hearing it for the first time on Halloween night was also a plus! Great debut by a band who clearly waited for the right time to unleash it. Death Doom done right.\n\n28. Blut Aus Nord: Hallucinogen (Debemur Morti Productions)\n\nOne of the most evolutionary and creatively staggering bands in Black Metal, who basically masquerade as an ever-changing being, who takes on a new form with literally every new release, who’ve explored different styles and bending them into their own image, including traditional Black Metal, Industrial Black Metal, Blackened Doom, Avant Garde Black Metal, Atmospheric, you name it, they probably did it. Hallucinogen only takes things further down their path of genre-bending madness, as it delves into the realm of Psychedelic Black Metal, with a progressive tinge to it. The overall sound is fairly melodic, but the atmosphere and trippy vibe is still very much in tact, presenting various segments of either tempo-shifting aggression, ranging from groovy to blasty, calm, picking passages in-between, and various moments in-between, utilizing some very catchy riffs in the process. It’s a strange, but enamoring listen all throughout that’s better heard than explained. BAN continue to be one of the most creative forces in Extreme Metal today and this is another album I would have given a full review, had I had more time. Great album in a discography already full of gems!\n\n27. Sadisme: Festering in Telepathic Communion (Death Kvlt Productions)\n\nThe latest entity of the Vampyric Black Metal sect, howling desolate invocations under a blood moon, in the form of raw, throat-slitting chaos. Sadisme is as primal and malevolent as it gets, and it’s everything I look for in the sub-genre, and demonstrates what should make it stand out as it’s own style. Just raw, visceral aggression and cacophony, under loud, piercing production, with a good hint of melody to it and some great riff work. It takes the foundation layed by acts like Drowning the Light and Vampyric Blood, taking the primal, minimalistic traits of Black Metal’s more traditional ways, and bringing it into more creative and interesting territories, the way newer acts to the scene, like Akasha, Moon Labyrinth and Terror Noxpheratur have been doing lately. I feel like this, as well as the heep of Blackened Punk that currently runs amok nowadays, is a more natural progression of traditional BM, as opposed to a bunch of dorks just playing generic tremolo riffs and aimlessly reaming their instruments on some cheap recording equipment. This is well-played, creative and mesmerizing in a very desolate, haunting way, while still keeping it as sketchy and sonically unfriendly as possible. It just proves that you can still be creative and esoteric, while keeping all of the extra nuance to a minimum. Another one of the better, more obscure releases that 2019 has bestowed upon us.\n\n26. Miscarriage: Imminent Horror (Sentient Ruin Laboratories)\n\nThe true sonic equivalent of the word “disgusting”. Just by looking at this absolute mess of a cover, you’d think that this is something rather fucked and messy, right? Well, you’re wrong. It’s worse. This is one of the most terrifying albums I’ve heard all year, in a time where a lot of bands try to out-do each other, by creating the most fucked up sound they can; this fucking band takes that cake, by far. Like I said in my mini-review of this a while back, it sounds as if Pissgrave mutated into something even more vile than it already was. I don’t even know if I can really call this a Death Metal album, it has traces of Death Metal in it’s sound, but you can also hear hints of Sludge, Goregrind and various other sounds that you;d have to really listen closely to detect. It’s just a violent mess of a sound, that makes you feel like taking a long, hot shower after listening to it. It makes you feel violated and question your sanity. Even worse, it forces you to listen and endure the torture again, to fully grasp. This is easily the best release from the more fucked up and gross corners of Extreme Metal and it wasn’t going to go without getting it’s just due. Next-level fucking disgusting and I love it!\n\n25. Morbid Cross: Disciples of the Goat (Independent)\n\nAnother one of the best discoveries that I made this year, Morbid Cross is pure, aggressive and riffy Death Thrash, that goes for the throat and doesn’t let up from start to finish. If this was the last year of Slayer’s existence, their spirit definitely lives on in this budding act’s sound. Some of the riff on here even remind me of things off of Show No Mercy and Hell Awaits. Hell, look a the fucking cover art. I mean… yeah. It’s still it’s own thing, however and doesn’t even come close to ripping anything or anyone off. Just a good, old fashioned, classic style Thrashy ass beating, with some old school Death Metal tendencies. Evil, aggressive, technically sound and as straightforward as it gets. Great stuff! I hope these dudes go places very soon.\n\n24. Haunter: Sacramental Death Qualia (I, Voidhanger Records)\n\nThis is a band that’s been building a profile for a while now, who started out as a Screamo band, then somehow grew into the beast that dropped this insanely unique and spellbinding ripper of a full-length. This is what I can only describe as Progressive Blackened Death Metal, that knows how to navigate the sonic specter that they created for themselves in sound. It’s unpredictable and makes you really fucking pay attention to fully grasp what it’s conveying. It’s very well-done Prog Death, filled with some massive riffs, acoustic passages and some really monstrous moments, with massive riffs and crushing drums. It can go from that, to a lengthy acoustic passage break in the blink of an eye. The chaos and cacophony transition well between one another and if you have an ear for this kind of stuff, like this and bands like Esoctrilihum or Convulsing, then you’ll dig this one and probably get lost in it. If you’re into straightforward stiff and not into more complex stuff like this, then I’d definitely say avoid it. Progressive Extreme Metal is an acquired taste, and this is no different, but it’s dark, demented and has depth to it, and it knows how to control tension with it. Very well done and a good album to move things forward for Blackened Death Metal going into the next decade.\n\n23. Arnaut Pavle: S/T (Mystískaos)\n\nNow on to Finland for some raw, furious Punk-infused Black Metal, that’s as ice cold as it is ruthless. I’ve finally gotten around to giving Arnaut Pavle a listen and I definitely should have done so sooner. It’s no secret that I can’t have enough Blackened Punk filth in my life, and this scratches that itch splendidly. It’s just non-stop, pissed off, spiteful ferocity, that goes for the throat from start to finish, and hammers down some fairly simple, but nasty riffs. It reminds me a lot of mid-2000s Darkthrone (Ravishing Grimness to The Cult is Alive), which is also a plus. Another great contribution to what Akitsa, Nyredolk, Akasha, Cruel Master and the likes have made a staple of in this decade. Pure sonic cruelty at it’s purest!\n\n22. Possessed: Revelations of Oblivion (Nuclear Blast Records)\n\nEveryone who has a favorite “comeback album”, can take theirs and flush it down the fucking toilet, because THIS is the true definition of one! After a 32-year absence, with some personal struggles among members in that time on top of that, Death Thrash legends, Possessed have finally returned and blew every other act of the style out of the water, and into another fucking galaxy. This album is fierce, super aggressive and laced with precision and deadly riffage. I wan’t sure what to expect when this album was announced, but from the second I pressed play on this one, to say I was floored would be an understatement. Possessed have clawed their way through trials and tribulations, as well as 30-plus years of stagnation, and delivered with a fucking banger. Absolute classic-style hellish Thrashing through and through. A little clean on the production end, but the riffs and hammering precision makes up for it in spades. Excellent album and the perfect example of what a comeback album should be!\n\n21. Full of Hell: Weeping Choir (Relapse Records)\n\nAll hype and hullabaloo aside, Full of Hell is one of the most interesting bands in Extreme Metal right now, which is why their last album, Trumpeting Ecstasy landed itself on my #1 spot for 2017. There was no doubt in my mind that this one would make this years list too. It may not be number one this time, but it’s still FoH doing what they do best, combining Death Metal, Grindcore, Noise and even some Sludge, into an onslaught of sonic relentlessness, that goes down many different paths at once, but somehow finds a way to condense it into a solid core sound that makes sense. It’s controlled chaos at it’s best, which I feel like Full of Hell are better at doing than most, as I said in my review of this album. Fast, sharp, ruthless and dark, yet interesting and enamoring, planting it’s feet somewhere in-between old school, crusty Grindcore and the darker, more fucked up and experimental side of it. FoH remains an ever-evolving act, with many tricks up it’s sleeve, a lot of which I’m sure haven’t even been put to use yet. Great stuff as always!\n\n20. Nordjevel: Necrogenesis (Osmose Productions)\n\nI don’t like to use the word “fun” too much, when it comes to Black Metal, but listening to this album sure is an exhilarating experience. Nordjevel are straightforward, modern style Black Metal, that’s fast, riffy and aggressive, but keeps a good punch to it’s sound and keeps things sharp and on point. Maybe a little generic to some, which I’d understand, but it has an energy to it that just pulls me in and get’s me going. It’s equally as evil sounding as it is chaotic, keeping in touch with it’s roots and it’s not too sanitized production-wise. It’s modern, but not plastic, by any means, just fast, loud and scathing Black Metal from front to back. One of the better acts of this particular group.\n\n19. Blood Incantation: Hidden History of the Human Race (Dark Descent Records)\n\nAhh, Blood Incantation. The ever-so hyped and hysteria-ridden Blood Incantation. It’s finally time to talk about the most anticipated Death Metal album of the year and maybe even the decade. Putting all the memes, Twitter arguments and divisiveness aside, here’s my take. It’s on this list for a reason. Everything about Starspawn and what made that album great, is amplified by 10 on this album and given a more progressive feel, similar to Human/Individual Thought Patterns-era Death, at least from what I can tell, but it waits for just the right moment to hit you with the full brunt of said progression, and once that moment comes, it hit you hard. I described this album n Twitter as a four-course meal at a fancy restaurant: first track is the appetizer, second track is the soup/salad, third track is the breadsticks, all three of which follow a simpler formula, with a tinge of melodic riffing to them, and the fourth and last track is the main fucking course, that lets loose and gives you a full-on ensemble of thick, meaty riffs, spacey melodies, shifting tempos, slow picking breaks and so on. Just a well done, complex track, that the first three tracks build to, that culminates this in the most grandiose way I’ve ever heard done on an OSDM album. Despite all the hype, this album IS worth a listen, even for the last track alone. Great stuff and worth the wait.\n\n18. Mgła: Age of Excuse (No Solace)\n\nMgła is a band you’ll either love of hate. Their fanfare is as divided as we are as a country politically, or when it comes to climate change, but there’s no denying the prowess and efficiency that these hooded Polish menaces bring to the table, which shines through on this album more than ever. There’s no climate change in the band’s sound, as it’s colder and starker than it’s ever been, with a solid lacing of melody to it, that makes it all the more chilling and abrasive. Like I said before, Mgła is one of the best Melodic Black Metal bands there is, because they know how to incorporate it into their sound, while keeping their roots in tact and blends it together with seeming ease. The melody is just as dark and negatively toned, mirroring the void of nihilistic philosophies that fuels their sound. Whether you like it or not, Mgła are undoubtedly one of the defining Black Metal acts of this decade and Age of Excuse is just another example why. A little on the hyped side, but they deliver in every way they can.\n\n17. Tomb Mold: Planetary Clairvoyance (20 Buck Spin)\n\n2019’s obsession with cosmic Death Metal brought on some bangers, for sure, including this one. Blood Incantation weren’t the only one who went all green-logo on us and took things off of our plane of existence and explored the unknown. Well, unlike Blood Incantation, Tomb Mold takes the more straightforward route and go right for the throat and focus more on bringing those thick, meaty riffs in full swing, under a murky atmosphere and just hammer it all down on you the true old school way. I couldn’t cite the last album as the best Death Metal album of last year, but this one is a huge step up from it and it hit me much harder and didn’t leave me guessing whether or not it needs time to grow on me. This one grew on my like an infectious space parasite from the first listen and I had no problem jamming it out several times afterwards on the same day. Pure, unbridled OSDM brutality that breaks through the scrutiny that the genre gets nowadays and proves that it belongs in the conversation. Cosmic Death at it’s most otherworldly!\n\n16. Fluids: Exploitative Practices (Independent)\n\nI only got to talk about this one briefly in my Summer Wrap-Up QAT a few months back, but I’ll echo my sentiment here. Disgusting Goregrind-infused Death Metal, that brought me back to the shock and awe that I felt upon first discovering Goregrind as a teenager, with a thick, brain-melting bassy production value to it, similar to that of Mortician or early Devourment. Caveman riffs, hammering blasts, nasty grooves, guttural bellows and overall skin-crawling sleaze is all you can expect from this and that’s all you really need; basically the sonic equivalent of the most violent, stomach-curdling bowel movement you’ve ever experienced, which is what real Goregrind should sound like. Vile and in your face, without any regard for you as a listener. Great fucking stuff for all you caveman-riff freaks out there!\n\n15. Deiphago: I, the Devil (Hells Headbangers)\n\n“I’m the Devil… and I’m here to do the Devil’s work”\n\nDeiphago are well known among the grinding Blackened Death Metal crowd and need no introduction, but this album was sure to be an intriguing one, considering the involvement of Kurt Ballou, handling production duties. This is Deiphago, being their usual, violent, chaotic selves, but with a noisier touch to them than usual, thanks again to the production style of Mr. Kurt. It adds to their sound well and gives it more dynamic, which freshen things up a good bit and less reason to lump them into the War Metal tag. I know they get classified as that pretty often, but I’ve always though they were more than that. I’ve always saw them as really violent Blackened Death Metal, above all else. That’s exactly what this is and it doesn’t disappoint in the least. It’s a good follow-up to their classics, like Filipino Antichrist and Satan Alpha Omega, plus, a big step up from their previous album, Into the Eye of Satan. Just pure, noisy, satanic violence through and through. Expect nothing less by these Filipino blasphemers.\n\n14. Crypt Sermon: The Ruins of Fading Light (Dark Descent Records)\n\nI’m very picky when it comes to traditional Doom Metal, so I proceeded this one with caution, but good lord, this is good! Crypt Sermon check all the boxes when it comes to bringing that classic, Candlemass style to the table and pulling it off well, which not many bands of the genre do. The riffs are thick, massive and catchy, the vocals are powerful and searing and the drums complete the package, by laying the hammer down on you in the most crushing way possible. Classic style Doom done right and done well! With so many bullshit bands claiming the title (*cough Ghost cough*), it’s good to see the genre finally done some justice. Great stuff!\n\n13. Pissgrave: Posthumous Humiliation (Profound Lore Records)\n\nAnother one of the most hyped Death Metal bands out today, who really drew attention to themselves with that tasty cover art, drawing the shock and awe of everyone who’s clearly never seen a Goregrind cover before, but nonetheless delivered once again, for everyone who enjoyed Suicide Euphoria (Well, me at least). A little cleaner on the production, but still as violent and visceral as a Death Metal band can get, especially in those vocals, that incorporates some elements of Grind as well. Probably the best modern Death Metal album of the year, that’s good if you want a break from OSDM for a bit. Overrated to some, but worthy of the hype it’s gotten, I think. Nasty, filthy Death at it’s most beautifully putrid.\n\n12. Darkthrone: Old Star (Peaceville Records)\n\nI understand why some people blow off Darkthrone nowadays, I truly do. Their brand of Punky Heavy/Black Metal rendered them a sad shell of their former selves for well over 10 years, which drove a lot of people away, myself included. It wasn’t until Arctic Thunder, where they really found their footing with this sound and turned thing up a notch. This album only continues that style, of doomy, gloomy Heavy Metal-infused BM, with massive sounding guitars, that create some catchy fucking riffs, combined with Nocturno Culto’s snarly howls. They really reinvented themselves into something compelling, by slightly changing things around and adding an evtra punch to their sound that was missing since The Cult is Alive. I don’t know about anyone else, but I love this stuff and I can’t relate to anyone who doesn’t like it. If you’re expecting them to put out another Transylvanian Hunger or A Blaze in the Northern Sky, it ain’t happening, so get the fuck over it! This is the Darkthrone that should have existed since TCiA and it may have come a bit late, but it fucking came! Great album, no matter what anyone says.\n\n11. Bethlehem: Lebe Dich Leer (Prophecy Productions)\n\nThe continuation of Bethlehem’s return to form, thanks to Onielar and her ability to recreate those manic shrieks that made them infamous in the first place. Their self-titled album was only the beginning and this album takes things further down that road, with a little bit more of a melodic feel to it, which they blend together with the darkness and despondency of the signature Bethlehem sound. Similar to Mgła, they know how to mix melody and the stark cold vibe of their sound and style, without one overshadowing the other. It made for some very compelling moments and despondent riffs and passages throughout songs. It’s still no Dictius te Necare or Sardonischer Untergang im Zeichen irreligiöser Darbietung, but it’s still very dark and manic sounding stuff, that comes ever-so close to captures the same magic. I said Onielar would make 2 appearances on this list, and here ya go. Great stuff that reminds me why I got into this band as a teenager and why they still keep me around today.\n\n10. Teitanblood: The Baneful Choir (Norma Evangelium Diaboli)\n\nAnother band I feel gets unfairly lumped into the War Metal tag, who has much more to offer than that, who REALLY came through and proved such with this album. This is Teitanblood’s magnum opus, without a doubt. The atmosphere, vibe and overall delivery is like that of a war breaking out in Hell. It’s cavernous, dismal and dynamic, exploring areas, even briefly, like Death Doom and OSDM, on top of the signature chaotic Blackened Death Metal sound that these guys have established themselves with, that puts them on a much bigger plane than just the War Metal tag. The riffs are also brought here, no questions asked; some of the best and most disgusting ones I’ve heard all year. One of the biggest shockers of the year and easily Teitanblood’s best work yet, even with a change in artwork colors to go with it. If this is what a baneful choir sounds like, then I want more of it!\n\n9. Diocletian: Amongst the Flames of a Burning God (Profound Lore Records)\n\nNOW we’ll talk about some War Metal that actually fits the term. The long-awaited new album by Diocetian came out of nowhere and absolutely obliterated every wannabe caveman riff conveyor and showed them how it’s really fucking done. This is a savage beast of an album that I still can’t help but blast into my ears at least once or twice a week. The chaos and vitriol in the overall sound, truly harkens back to the more neanderthalic acts of the Ross Bay Cult, like Conqueror, Revenge, Proclamation and so on, by going all out in it’s delivery and jamming it’s foot on the accelerator and keeping it there, no matter what kind of danger it poses to those who come in contact with it. Just a merciless, violent plundering from start to finish, without a single fuck to give about you as a listener. The best War Metal album of the year, hands down. Few come close to capturing the essence like these manics have. VERY few.\n\n8. Chelsea Wolfe: Birth of Violence (Sargent House)\n\nWe all knew this was gonna be on here, right? I’ve been aboard the Chelsea Wolfe wagon from the day I discovered here through Pain is Beauty, and since then, she’s taken her sound to darker, doomier depths, with Abyss and Hiss Spun. This album, however, strips all of the Gothic Rock, Post Punk and Darkwave nuance and goes down the quiet, somber road of Dark Folk, or Neofolk, if you want to call it that. It’s still Chelsea being herself, but in a much slower and stark fashion and it’s just as compelling and haunting as ever. Her voice, coupled with the acoustic melody and dreary atmosphere really makes for a sobering listen, especially during long commutes or on slow, depressing days. It offers that sort of dark, foggy calm, while spellbinding you with beautiful soundscapes and drab musings, just as much as her more abrasive works are. Another excellent outing by one of my favorite non-Metal artists out right now. This isn’t just out of hype, I couldn’t give a fuck less about that, she really is one of the more interesting artists out there that I still inevitably find myself delving into while I’m knee-deep in my “Depressing Shit” playlist on Spotify. Great album and possibly her best yet.\n\n7. Vastum: Orificial Purge (20 Buck Spin)\n\nAs vast and wild as the current wave of old school Death Metal has been the last few years, very few bands have taken it to as deep, disturbing depths, lyrically and thematically, as San Francisco, CA’s Vastum. Deriving from the usual lyrical tropes of death, gore, Satan and all that jazz, this band is known for exploring less touched upon and even more taboo (especially nowadays) topics, like dark erotica and sexual depravity. Hell, they even have a song about incels on their first album. Well, three albums in now and they’ve released what I can easily call their best work yet. This album has just the right atmosphere that I love when it comes to OSDM, as well as the right tone in the instrumentals, namely the thick, hammering drum sound. It has a harshness to it, that makes you feel like it’s somehow directed at you specifically. Kind of a weird way of looking at it, but that’s basically the vibe this album gives off. Combine that with the subject matter and you got a pretty damn compelling Death Metal album, perhaps the most compelling of the year. Some real twisted stuff, with some well done riffage to back it up.\n\n6. Vitriol: To Bathe from the Throat of Cowardice (Century Media Records)\n\nBoy oh boy, do I regret sleeping on this one for most of the year. I’ve hear about Vitriol for a good couple years now, but I never really bothered to give them a listen up until recently. Well, as you can tell by this album being on this list and by it’s position on it, that’s a very much regretful decision on my part. This is the best modern Death Metal album of the fucking year, bar none and Vitriol is my new favorite of the bunch. To be this barbaric in sound, while being so cohesive in delivery is astounding. This is on the same boat as some of the more technical bands with cleaner production that I very much dig, like Misery Index, Man Must Die or even Hate Eternal, but somehow even more venomous and spiteful. It just sounds like a shockwave of sound and fury, just coming at you at full speed, leaving you no choice but to stand there and accept it, and it stays that way until it’s running time drains out. I’m sure you catch my drift by now, but goddamn, this one is a beast and I can’t find enough aggressive adjectives to describe it. A truly dangerous listen, that held my interest all throughout, that re-opened my eyes and made me realize that the current wave of OSDM is just a microcosm of what the genre really has to offer. Forward-thinking DM done right, no cap!\n\n5. Akasha: Canticles of the Sepulchral Deity (Grey Matter Productions)\n\nOne of my most anticipated releases early on in the year. The debut full-length by what I consider the current standard-barer for Vampyric Black Metal and one of the best new USBM acts around, which has been criminally overlooked by the underground. Akasha bring that scathing, razor-sharp, raw sound and use it to it’s full potential, bringing equally sharp guitars, vicious, gripping riffs, shifting tempos, and foggy shrieks, combining, so many different styles and smooshing them all into one, like Raw/Atmospheric Black Metal, Thrash, Punk, some Hardcore and probably some other things I missed. Just a whirlwind of spiteful viciousness and hatred, culminating in one huge chaotic soundscape of sonic terror, that’s well-controlled and well executed, executing the listener as well. Great riffs, great production and all-around sinister stuff. One of the most underrated albums of 2019, bar fucking none!\n\n4. Tenebrae in Perpetuum: Anorexia Obscura (Debemur Morti Productions)\n\nDepressive Black Metal doesn’t have the best rep these days, but every now and then, something comes along that takes it to deeper, darker and more fucked up depths, that make it compelling and truly cathartic. This is the latest example of that, as it goes for a very more manic and visceral sound, that dwells in the realm of Blackened Doom and channels the ways of acts like Silencer and early Bethlehem, to reach deep down and pour every last drop of it’s damaged soul into the recording. It’s sort of a weird, unique sound, but it has that psychotic feel to it that enamored me when I discovered those two aforementioned bands over a decade ago. This is definitely no bedroom Black Metal drek, recorded on some cheap, shitty computer software, this is DSBM done the proper way and with an intense punch to it, that’ll reach deep into your psyche and bring out your most negative thoughts and feelings. Some truly crazy shit that serves as a needle in the haystack that is Depressive BM. Intense, manic and vicious, the way tortured souls truly sound in aural form.\n\n3. Fleshgod Apocalypse: Veleno (Nuclear Blast Records)\n\nSo, you’re probably wondering why Fleshgod Apocalypse is on this list… and so high on it. Well, if you saw my review of this album, you’ll know why. I’ve criticized the band so many times, for so many years now, who started out as one of my favorite Technical Death Metal bands, then turned into what I call “Death Metal Dimmu Borgir”. I don’t necessarily have a problem with the Symphonic Death Metal thing, but the way the symphonic element overshadowed literally everything else,, especially the guitars and damn near the drums, just annoyed the shit out of me. I wasn’t going to even bother with this one, but thanks to Instagram, I heard a small bit of a song that raised my curiosity, so I gave it a listen, and I was floored. Everything that was wrong with this direction in sound is finally corrected and the mess has been cleaned up immensely. You can actually hear the guitars, the drums, the other instruments implemented into it and everything works with and compliments each other almost immaculately. I’m usually not a fan of super-experimental/Avant Garde stuff, but these guys know how to create something truly compelling, while sticking to their Tech-Death roots and balancing it all out. This is a great album and without question, their best work since the Mafia EP. I still favor their early stuff more than anything, but this is their most compelling stuff yet.\n\n2. Krypts: Cadaver Circulation (Dark Descent Records)\n\nNow for my favorite Death Metal album of the year. Krypts return with their third album and absolutely crush every other OSDM release that came out this year (yes, including Blood Incantation), which is saying something. This album SOUNDS like an old school Death Metal album, with just the right atmosphere and prowess to it. It’s doomy, oppressively suffocating and has an otherworldly tone to it, that’s further built upon, with sweltering melodic riffs that shine through the chaos like sunshine on a pile of rotting corpses in the desert. I’ve seen a couple people call it “Deathgaze”, saying it has a Shoegaze feel to it; I wouldn’t necessarily go that far, but I see where that comes from. The melodic element does add a “gaze” to the sound, but that’s been done many times in OSDM, with bands who go for a full on cosmic tone. That’s exactly what this album goes for and it hits the nail right on the head, as far as I’m concerned. The overall delivery and vibe of this album is just apocalyptic and crushing, and I couldn’t help but sit there in a trance as I heard it for the first time. A clear cut example of Death Metal excellence in 2019. You’ll be hard pressed to find another one that sounds half as dangerous as this one!\n\n*Drum roll*\n\n1. Gardsghastr: Slit Throat Requiem (Profound Lore Records)\n\nLike I said about that Vargrav album earlier, this is how Symphonic Black Metal is done. No other release did it better this year, or even in the last 20 fucking years, as this band has. Helmed by Alex Poole, mastermind behind Chaos Moon, who put out one of the absolute best Black Metal albums of the decade in 2017’s Eschaton Mémoire, carried over his unhinged genius into his latest project, Gardsghastr. The best way to describe this album is haunting, powerful and soul-crushing. The symphonic element is blended in with the instrumentals so thoroughly and leaves room for every other detail to be noticeable and heard, and it compliments it, rather than overshadow it and it gives the overall sound even more of a chilling vibe. That, combined with intense, well-written riffs and blasting ferocity, it makes for a nightmarish ride of a listen, that invokes emotion. It’a an abrasive listen that gave me the same chills down my spine, as Emperor’s In the Nightside Eclipse did all those years ago. I knew this was my #1 form my first listen, off of that fact alone, and it was going to be hard to top, which few albums came close to doing, but still fell short. Another great gem for modern Black Metal, that represents the genre’s forward-thinking ways well and proves that not everything has to revert to the ways of the early 90s to be interesting. Alex Poole is a special talent and knows how to craft something with detail and leaves no ground uncovered, and if you can restore my interest in a genre I’ve been deaf to for years, you’ve done something right. Once again, this is how it’s done, no matter how many hacks try to over-sanitize it. My favorite album of 2019, without question.\n\n_________________________________________\n\nThat wraps it up, folks. Read it, agree with it, disagree with it, call me a poser, call me trendy or whatever. This is my list and I’m sticking to it. Sorry if it doesn’t meet your arbitrary fucking requirements. Again, pretty goddamn good year. Hopefully this isn’t too long of a post either, because I did go off a bit in some of those paragraphs. This wasn’t east to make, but it’s always worth it. But yeah, that’s all she wrote for 2019 (well, there are still leftovers, but that’ll be covered after the holidays) and I’m hanging it up for now. Onward to the next 12 months!\n\nBut, before we get to that… there is one other thing to talk about. Not only is it the end of the YEAR, but this also spells the end of the DECADE… and you know what that means.\n\nStay tuned."
