        "text": "Today, discover (or rediscover) the Debemur Morti label thanks to maPlatine.com. Phil, the manager of the label, accepted to answer a few questions and tell us more about the history of the label.\n\n‚Äì Can you tell us a little more about the creation of the Debemur Morti label?\n\nIn 2003, following my diverse (catastrophic) experiences with certain underground labels, the idea to found Debemur Morti Productions was born. I wanted a solid structure preaching Black Metal as a serious artistic approach. A structure on which an artist could count on. The lack of seriousness and the amateurism (which is still omnipresent today) are unacceptable flaws in my eyes, ‚Äúunderground‚Äù is not a synonym for mediocrity. I am a serious person, who likes things done well. I therefore supply the artists with whom I collaborate a sincere, devoted, and professional work. I had no previous experience, I learned everything on the spot, step by step without counting the hours. This year, the label celebrates its 15th anniversary and I can say that I am proud of the work we have done so far.\n\n‚Äì Why choose the name ‚ÄúDebemur Morti‚Äù? What does it mean?\n\nI have already answered this question several times but for those who have never heard of Demebur Morti: ‚ÄúDebemur Morti nos nostraque‚Äù [Horace, Ars poetica, v.63], means ‚ÄúWe are doomed to die, we and all our belongings.‚Äù.\n\nI chose this name because it completely speaks to me. The transience and the fragility of life are summarized in this name. Today, when thinking about it, I tell myself that the irony of this choice is that it will enable me to leave a mark in history (at least the history of Black Metal).\n\n‚Äì What is the philosophy of your record label?\n\nWe have always favoured quality over quantity. In addition, it is primordial that the Art of the groups affiliated to DMP (Debemur Morti Productions) is authentic, deep, and pure ‚Äì In summary, ‚Äútrue‚Äù Art (true, in the sense of ‚Äúnon-artificial‚Äù). However, it also has to carry a spiritual dimension. The goal is to offer a piece that can transcend the listener.\n\n‚Äì How many artists are today on the Debemur Morti label?\n\nBetween 28 and 29 groups are more or less active on our label. You can discover them here.\n\n‚Äì Are there artists with whom you are particularly proud of having worked with?\n\nIt is complicated! I am proud of the label‚Äôs history and the majority of the groups I have worked with but there are clearly a few groups that marked ‚Äúturning points‚Äù in the label‚Äôs history. These groups enabled us to reach the next ‚Äúlevel‚Äù in terms of visibility. I am especially thinking of HORNA (Finland), ARCKANUM (Sweden), BLUT AUS NORD (France), and ARCHGOAT (Finland).\n\n‚Äì What is your favorite part when releasing a new record?\n\nEvery part is particular. The step I appreciate the most is THE moment just before pressing the ‚Äúplay‚Äù button when one of our groups sends us a new album. This mix of anxiety and excitement is clearly one of my favorite moments.\n\nI also particularly enjoy the final result. Discovering the vinyl record, especially since we always try to make beautiful objects, touching the cardboard, placing the vinyl record on my vinyl turntable‚Ä¶ it is a unique ritual that I share with no one!\n\n‚Äì Are there any new releases coming soon? üôÇ\n\nWe are soon releasing WALLACHIA‚Äôs, a Norwegian Black Metal group, new album. It is, for I, their best album since their demo/first album. It includes all the essential ingredients in order to make an epic and magical album. To listen to again and again. Which is what I am doing while responding to this interview!\n\nLastly, in May, we are releasing a new album made by a quite unknown Polish group. This group is called HEGEMONE and they created a small bomb of Post Black Metal which is truly ‚Äúin this time period‚Äù. We were blown away when the group contacted us! And the artwork made by Dehn Sora is absolutely amazing with a different cover for the CD version and the vinyl record version.\n\n‚Äì Have you always wanted to work in music?\n\nLets say that music has always been a part of my life in one way or another. I have lived with music since a very young age. I cannot say that I have always dreamed of founding a label, that would be lying, but I am not surprised of being where I am today seeing that music is an important part of my life. This naturally happened and it is what makes that even after 15 years, it is still a pleasure for me to do this!\n\n‚Äì Do you listen to vinyl records? What turntable do you have?\n\nAbsolutely! I purchased an old Pink Triangle a few years ago. I love this turntable. The sound restitution of this turntable is great and it is beautiful to look at. If I am not mistaking, it is the Export version.\n\n‚Äì How many vinyl records do you have in your collection? What style of music do you listen to the most?\n\nI do not know anymore, I stopped counting a few years ago! I mainly have (Black) Metal, but also more mainstream groups such as PLACEBO, MUSE, EDITORS, or WARPAINT. I also have a few classical music vinyl records.\n\n‚Äì If you had to choose only two vinyl records from your collection, which ones would you choose? And why?\n\nThis is a super difficult question‚Ä¶ choosing two vinyl records is a little like choosing which torture method I would enjoy the most to make myself suffer, hehe. Especially since depending on my mood, I think that I could name two different vinyl records according the time period of the year. But here I go anyways: WARPAINT ‚Äì ‚ÄúWarpaint‚Äù because it is an outstanding album that I have listened to again and again many many times.\n\nAnd for the second album, I would say BLUT AUS NORD ‚Äì ‚ÄúThe Work Which Transforms God‚Äù because for me, this album changed my life/my way of seeing things. You must absolutely listen to this album with headphones in Parisian public transports. Strong sensations guaranteed.\n\n‚Äì Thank you Phil üôÇ"
