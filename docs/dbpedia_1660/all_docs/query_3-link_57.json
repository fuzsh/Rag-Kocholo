        "text": "Alexander Donat from Berlin, Germany is a true millipede of music. While he runs his Blackjack Illumnist label, he mostly releases albums consisting of primarily himself in various incarnations. Three of those I will point out in a bit more detail below. It is amazing to see how one person can have so many different faces and sounds within, sounding like a chaotic punker at first, and then a sexy gothic electro darko the next. It must have something to do with his extensive music collection, which he also shares on his socials, and the 2022 music list alone will already keep you busy for a couple of days…! But let’s dive into a couple of his most important creative outlets first, before we meet their maker and talk to him in person…\n\nToday There’s No Tomorrow by Fir Cone Children was my first encounter with Donat and his many aliases. On this album he sounds like a psychedelic rock band, a schizophrenic anarcho punk band, and an artsy electro pop unit all at once. If you didn’t know, you would never have expected it all to be the work of just one guy in his bedroom. The album sounds bigger and more extensive than that. It sounds like this band is ready to tour and take over the squatter venues of the European underground. I don’t know if that might ever happen, but when it does Weirdo Shrine will be present in the pit!\n\nVlimmer is Donat’s darkest solo project, abruptly throwing us from our purple fumed punk cloud and into a shady studded leather dungeon. The lyrics are completely in German this time, which is a perfect language for this gothic rave party nightmare. Just when things get too creepy for me, Donat throws the rudder sideways again, sounding like an 80s worshipping pop act echoing Aha, or Dead or Alive, but in German of course. It’s not 100% my kind of party, but it is a danceable party for sure!\n\nAssassun is Donat’s electronic dance project with a gothic twist. There is a strong 90s euro goth feeling here, as Donat interchanges faux rap shouts and gothic lamenting vocals. It’s music The Cure fans can pick coins on, but neon dreadlocked cyber goths can dance to as well. I think fans of bands like Hocico and VNV Nation might dig it, but at the same time it has a weirdo campy side to it that might appeal to fans of DEVO and even The Residents. Personally I love the feeling of being sandwiched between thick layers of synthesizers that the album gives me a couple of times.\n\nSo let’s meet mister Donat himself! Ever wondered what it is like to be the most prolific artist on your own DIY label? Check it out:\n\nHow are you? Can you introduce yourself and your multiple endeavors?\n\nEverything’s mostly looking well, thanks! My name is Alexander Donat, and I run an independent record label that has DIY written all over, focussing on small edition releases in handmade packaging. On Blackjack Illuminist Records I release music of international bands as well as my own music, and I sell it on tapes, CDs and sometimes vinyl, too. It’s a lot of fun, even though it feels like doing at least seven jobs at the same time: musician, producer, mastering engineer, art director, social media coordinator, promotional guy, postal dude…\n\nWhat can you tell me about your musical background?\n\nBoth my father and my grandfather are respectively were professional musicians, not like me in alternative music scenes but in the classical music field. Our house was filled with music all the time and I tried out several instruments, some of which for a longer period of time, others for just a year. Today I see myself as a passionate dilettante who doesn’t practice his instruments, I simply play the stuff I like, record it and usually never play it again.\n\nWhat does a regular day in your life look like? What role does music play?\n\nAt daytime I’m an elementary school teacher in Berlin Neukölln, and when the sun goes down I head into my cellar where my studio is, doing all the musician and label things mentioned above. Luckily, I get along with much less sleep than an average person. It allows me to produce a lot in a relatively short time. Music is my life, and I’m lucky and grateful I have the chance to still pursue my dreams even though I’ve got a challenging job.\n\nWhat do people often forget when they think about starting a record label?\n\nIf you start from scratch and want to be recognized, it’s a helluva job, ‘cause usually things don’t happen on their own. You will have to put a lot of work and passion into it, don’t do it for the money! Also, if you don’t release on a regular basis you might be forgotten quickly, there’s so much music out there and the zines and blogs out there come and go, you should always try to stay up to date. Finally, my personal and very subjective standpoint, I have the impression that many musicians start a label for their own music in the first place, and when they open up for artists outside their own bubble – which is something a record label makes a record label really – they suddenly make less music of their own. Make up your mind if that’s something you want to do. Also, ask yourself what your label might look like after a year – do you think you have the necessary resources: time, money, patience, resilience and passion?\n\nWhere do you live and how does it affect your musical doings?\n\nI live in a Berlin suburb, and while I go to shows in Germany’s capital, I barely play live here, which is not only primarily due to the fact that there’s probably too much going on gig-wise, but also because I’m more of a studio person. I do have occasional gigs with WHOLE which is a duo, but recording new music is more important to me, although I’m a stage maniac and love the limelight. I simply wouldn’t have any capacities left for doing all the booking.\n\nThat said, I don’t think Berlin has an influence on my music, I’m rather influenced by artists from around the globe than by a certain location.\n\nWhat is your take on music reviews these days? (seeing as you started your own way of doing it ;))\n\nTalking about music is awesome and a lot of fun. I’m a huge fan of the good old print magazine, and reading reviews about new and old bands is one of the most inspiring things to do. You never really know if you can trust the reviewer, sometimes I have a feeling that even though a rating is not the best I might end up liking the record, and vice versa, a raving review might leave you with a disappointing record. Music’s best when it’s some kind of surprise box. When it comes to my own music, it always excites me to read reviews, it’s maybe the highest praise when someone takes the time to listen, make notes of their thoughts to finally sit down and type words into their computer. To me reviews are an important variable in the whole music-making process. Not because I want to make music someone has to like, no, it’s because I’m curious what listeners think about the songs I love making.\n\nWho are your favorite current other artists and record labels at the moment?\n\nIn 2022 I found myself in another black metal phase with Blut Aus Nord’s “Disharmonium” ending on the very top of my top 20 list of best releases. I started discovering a handful of other albums by the artist on Debemur Morti which was probably my favourite label last year. Aara and White Ward were also new bands to me, they also released music on Debemur Morti in 2022.\n\nWhat is “the dream” for you as an artist, and as a label owner?\n\nFor a long time I thought my dream would be to see Blackjack Illuminist Records keep expanding and getting bigger each year, but I figured that it sounded rather capitalist, and it eventually would lead to disappointment. Now I’m simply grateful when people listen to the stuff I release, whether it’s my own music or someone else’s. Personally, it always feels great when someone orders from a country I haven’t received an order from before. I’m still waiting for Bandcamp email telling me someone from the African continent ordered a CD or something! What I also love is surprising stuff, like meeting new people, getting asked to participate in projects, seeing that Blackjack Illuminist bands get attention. Another dream which is actually coming true: In a couple of months I’m going to release a live album by my favourite band, No Age. And it’s not even the first time! Still, it feels so unreal …\n\nCan you tell me about your immediate future plans?\n\nBesides that No Age tape there will be a new ASSASSUN album coming on 24th March. Later this year you can expect new albums by Feu Follet, Fir Cone Children, WHOLE, Vlimmer and, hopefully, Social Union. It’s going to be exciting!\n\nWhat should the Weirdo Shrine reader do after reading this interview?\n\nListen to my best-of 2022 Spotify playlist, because it was an extraordinarily amazing year for music.
