        "text": "Reading Time: 2 minutes\n\nA full length with only two songs.\n\nYou’ve haven’t read wrong. This is NOT an EP, it’s a trip to the folk black metal from Sweden.\n\nFirst song is called Abortologen and let’s analyze it: Starting as pure black metal it has some melodic parts but not in “vampiric/goth” sense. More like Dark Funeral (minus the drums). There is a change of phrase when the song stays midtempo: that part is when the band starts to resound something like Kampfar, Helheim or Einherjer. Another change and over again the song explodes into purest black metal with solos and all the jive. In the midst of the song (that is 16 minutes long) the cohesive part is impressing because is very difficult to make a long song like NOT doing 20 tunes into one. No, the song progresses, but there is a sense of union in the riffs WITHOUT sounding repetitive. By the epic ending of the vocals and the grandiloquent final part announce the grand finale, but there is a surprise: a capela vocal, very sad, like a lament. And then BLACK METAL EXPLOSION to end it all. Great!\n\nKom Eld, Kom Regn with its regal beginning announces a new phase in the album, this time sounding very much like Enslaved. The folk value of it is epic but the change of tempo is imminent: soon the sound transforms into a menacing thing with vary harsh vocals and pure energy, this time not so melodic (quasi-atonal) and the mid-tempo here serves as a warning sign. And everything (as always) blasts into pure black metal dementia. This part is for die-hards of Tulus and the likes. Of course, this is just a comparison because to blend all the aforementioned alleged influences, the band OUGHT to be original. Over again the epic folk part is back putting the listener into a time machine to Viking times. Particularly, there is a part with intricate tempo that over again goes into full throttle BM, but the strange and cool change of tempos show the intelligence of this great opus. The final part consists in a low guitar sound in a bard fashion and the grandiloquence of the conclusion.\n\nThis album is surprisingly good. Okay, it demands LOTS of spins, but the end result is something of spectacular. This is the perfect middle ground of everything good in black metal. Ambitious and bull-eye.\n\nAv stoft is out now on Nordvis.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nWEB:\n\nhttps://nordvis.com/en/jordfast-a-41\n\nhttps://jordfast.bandcamp.com/\n\nSOCIAL PROFILES:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/jordfastband\n\nYouTube Channel: http://www.youtube.com/c/Nordvis\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 1 minute and 20 seconds.\n\nFrench band goes full technical.\n\nBrutal technical band Fall Of Seraphs goes full tech/brutal on this new release, accordingly, their debut album following a demo. I heard the demo. The former is good. This is MUCH BETTER.\n\nFirst song called The Eradication Dogma has enough gas to be a hell of a headbanger with fast drumming and coolest production. The “reverb” vocals cause a supernatural sensation as in the second song called Mirror Of Transcendence. In this one, the solos and the riffs and the subtle change of tempos is great and I believe this is the best song of the album, but wait because there is more.\n\nFire Path Of Punishment is kind alike the aforementioned song, and, at least for me, that is not a flaw. Brutal, technical parts equally distributed, played with gusto and exploding the speakers. Over again the solos are the stars here, great!\n\nTitle track From Dust To Creation, even venture in some thrash territory as their biz is to change tempos, but they are not jazzy, you know, but who cares, as long as they play fast as the speed of light and very noisy. Last song Brood of Decomposition has a sense of urgency as it announces the end of this 28-minute 7-track album. The brutality continues, the hate continues. These Frenchmen are the real deal lemme say! Over again the riffs are real earworms in current death metal scene, because is not every day that happens.\n\nThis is an album that maybe has some repetitions. Is that a problem? I don’t think so. I’m totally for this.\n\nFrom Dust to Creation is out now on Memento Mori.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nMORE INFO:\n\nwww.facebook.com/fallofseraphsofficial\n\nwww.fallofseraphs.bandcamp.com\n\nwww.memento-mori.es\n\nwww.facebook.com/memento.mori.label\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 2 minutes.\n\nGermanic Pagan Madness.\n\nFirtan is a Pagan/Atmospheric (well kinda) band that returns with their new album Marter showing purest black metal all the way with fantastic instrumentation and composition.\n\nFirst song Faðir is already an epic and a classic. Fast, heavy and somewhat with melodic (how come?) riffs that doesn’t sound incongruent, on the contrary: it adds insult to injury or more strength to the tune. Drums sound like an explosion until an acoustic guitar takes place but over again the metal comes back ripping and the intelligent riffs are something of great beauty! The solos by the end of song are very pleasant to hear ad the intricate nature and technical approach only make things more interesting.\n\nAs in the second song called Amor Fati, with calm but striking beginning until it, brick by brick, becomes a heavier work and the mix of melodic guitars and crazy harsh vocals make the contrast very good to hear. Then everything explodes into fury softly resounding like Uada, but with great originality. This is a 9-minute tune that has so many variations like acoustic drums, to fastest double bass drumming that is a trip. Ace as fuck! The end is pure dark ambient and by this time one starts to guess if he/she’s listening to the same band. Confusing. Flawless.\n\nParhelia has a grandiose approach with spoken words, unbridled velocity and evil vocalizations. It’s really a devil-may-care musical attitude that doesn’t sound like a free jazz, I mean these guys know how to bet and to win. Over again the song is full of variations like the same riff on repetition but without the black metal on the background in a folk audacity that few is capable of executing.\n\nPeraht, although maintaining the way the guitars are playing and even putting more Enslaved-like attitude in it, is very violent by the end of the day, don’t mattering the perfect approach on the guitars and production. It’s when the beauty meet entropy. Order from chaos, you name it.\n\nThe whole album, which has 8 songs on its digital version (a 9th track exists EXCLUSIVELY on vinyl and CD boxset) is extraordinary and the more I like this type of black metal but I must admit this band is especially different. A real tour-de-force throughout the realms of Pagan/Atmospheric Black Metal!\n\nMarter is out NOW on AOP Records.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nMORE INFO:\n\nwww.facebook.com/Firtanofficial\n\nwww.aoprecords.de\n\nwww.facebook.com/aoprecs\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 1 minute and 50 seconds.\n\nReal Black Metal with ancient accent.\n\nWhen I first listened to this I was really baffled for the rawness and trueness of this material: brutal Belgian BM with members of Possession and Diskaterion, this is second to none stuff beginning with the art that is pure medieval madness.\n\nFirst song of this 5-track EP is 1611, V.C. with a super raw approach to the guitars and simple, but on spot drumming, dissonant as fuck, and it contains a certain dramatic satanic “alert” on the riffs, varying basically on phrases, remembering the very first days of the second wave of black metal or the merging of the 1st with the 2nd if you will.\n\n1634, K.M. is nothing different, except that the riffs are not so earworm but, even so, they are simple and easy to catch and when I talk about rawness, that doesn’t go to the production: as if the whole thing was clear but with a grit put directly in the instruments. Perfection as the whole thing remembers an excellent band one has heard before.\n\nMeesters van de Hooge Wercken works more like an interlude but the dark ambient nature of the song gains hues of guitars and by the end of the song it gains drums. But the whole business is threatening as hell, and I daresay it reproduces the art of the album. But it’s not an instrumental though: it has vocals by the end of it.\n\nThe lengthiest song is the next one – 1638, D.V.J. – with a big intro then it returns to the gruff black metal riffs but the drums this time around are more mid-tempo with double bass and just then the whole thing gains traction: it’s simple and it’s effective. The vocals are raspy as hell, like a demon speaking in tongues.\n\nLonging For The Ancient Kingdom is a Ancient Rites cover and although the song being NOT an original it doesn’t differs from the whole opus, making the completion an impeccable conclusion.\n\nMaybe this EP is a project, but Hanghedief deserves a full length of new songs if this perfection can be replicated. I’m already a diehard fan.\n\nOverduyvelsche Boosheit is out now on 12″ MLP/MCD/TAPE on Iron Bonehead.\n\nRating: 9/10\n\nMORE INFO:\n\nwww.ironbonehead.de\n\nwww.ironboneheadproductions.bandcamp.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/IronBoneheadProductions\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 1 minte and 30 seconds.\n\nThe dynamics of metallic chaos.\n\nEmbrace of Thorns should be a known name for those who like blackened death metal or black/death, you name it. Hailing for Greece, this new album Entropy Dynamics brings the brutal metal of hell they are supposed to do.\n\nAlthough black in essence the good production of this album sounds more like Morbid Angel than Blasphemy, although it may appeal to fans of the latter.\n\nFor example, the title of the song Entropy Dynamics / Nucleus Dissolved lives up to its name, because it’s difficult to solve the chaotic musical structure, even with a lot of spins. This is a positive point because it maintains the fan of this type of music entertained trying to deal with the puzzle.\n\nI Wish you Burn in an Endless Funeral Pyre is a sincere statement that translates in hatred drumming, somewhat intricate riffs, (that in the basis is pure black metal), and buzzing and heaviness that is strange to hear because not everyday it appears out there.\n\nThe Lament of the Destroyed shows their warlike side with authentic ignorant and intransigent metal of hell, pure fastness, real distaste for human life. Double bass drumming eating one’s mind away, intricate riffs and all the jive!\n\nAnother highlight is the truculent tune Transformation into a Celestial Ghoul which shows their mystical side, very contemptuous attitude in guitars, black metal drums all along and abhorrent vocals.\n\nAll in all, this 51-minute album is not easy to digest in one spin, and this is for those who are fanatical for this type of aggression. I think it’s pretty okay, because at the end of the day: WHAT is wrong with a good friendly satanic destructive musical commando?\n\nEntropy Dynamics is out now on Nuclear Winter.\n\nRating: 7,5/10\n\nMORE INFO:\n\nwww.facebook.com/EmbraceOfThorns\n\nwww.embracethorns.bandcamp.com\n\nwww.nuclearwinterrecords.com\n\nwww.nuclearwinterrecords.bandcamp.com\n\nwww.facebook.com/martyrdoomproductions\n\nwww.instagram.com/nuclearwinterrecords\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 1 minte and 10 seconds.\n\nLyric video for CARAVAN OF BROKEN GHOSTS is out!\n\nAstral Fortress, the next release of the utter gods of Darkthrone is going to be out on Friday (October 28th) and a new video (lyric video) was posted in the misanthropic medias to celebrate the occasion. The song is Caravan of Broken Ghosts. A post on Facebook explains:\n\n“We promised you a new song – “Caravan Of Broken Ghosts” – your first glimpse into ASTRAL FORTRESS (out Friday next week).\n\nFenriz says of the track “There is a revisit vibe of ‘Quintessence’ at first, which is a total coincidence as it is Ted’s song and I wrote ‘Q’. The song then explodes into fiercer metal, pounding and catching there as well, with clever riff shifts. And then the classic doom ending. Thank you, Ted“\n\nEnjoy this lyric video, created by Fenriz and Matthew Vickerstaff and a hike with Fenriz through one of his favourite forests!”\n\nThe fact that the video was recorded on the horizontal during the metal punk hike of Fenriz and the INCREDIBLE “FX” (like slows the video when the song slaws and accelerate when the song… well.. accelerates, just make the whole think looks TRUE!\n\nNobody knows if Fenriz were just making fun or not. I think nobody cares, because in a technologic world of filters, algorithms and whatnot, Fenriz and Nocturno Culto are managing to keep the truest metal!\n\nYou can order Astral Fortress here : https://darkthrone.lnk.to/AstralFortress\n\nWhat the video!\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 1 minute and 40 seconds.\n\nThe UK death metal entity is back!\n\nThis is a band that has only qualities. I have no memories of a band that doesn’t record the same album twice and even so, it’s always a virtue (no pun intended, I mean really).\n\nThe Corruption of Virtue goes less to technical death metal and more to pure death metal but of course, the band always plays like hell.\n\nRitual Cannibalism is a suitable opener for those who seek the most headbanger death metal ever, the riffs (oh always them) are second to none and the more one spins the album the more he gets used to this great song. The continuation, called Sectarian Warfare, has a bassline that is infernally good, along with the solo that is NEVER dull. When I said they changed their technicality I tried to say they put it almost all in the marvelous solos of the album.\n\nEmbrace Dystopia (at least its beginning) sounds a lot like the song Spiritual Healing from Death. Apart of that it has a fast approach and unbridled guttural vocals, but honestly this duo of guitarists, Shoi Sen and Paul Nazarkardeh kinda of steal the scene here. What an epic track, really!\n\nAnother great number (and one to crank it up!) is the track Religious Cancer, with a sound that, sounds somewhat different in this paradoxically cohesive work. There’s more thrash metal in it, but of course, it’s not a traditional thrash metal track, it sounds more death thrash!\n\nThe Sword Verses is the closer and it is complex one, going more to their tech past: it starts like a syncopated biz, then it goes to bona fide death metal with intricate riffages and then there are changes of tempo all the way! Great song!\n\nThis album is another gem of De Profundis , a band that deserves more love for the quality of their musicians (all of them), and if you REALLY like death metal you MUST spin this one like hell!\n\nThe Corruption of Virtue is out now on Transcending Obscurity Records.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 1 minute, 35 seconds\n\nThe Norwegian band announces the new album after 5 years!\n\nThe classic band Dødsengel from Norway announce a new album after 5 year-hiatus which according to the press release is a is a devotional work of idiosyncratic spiritual Black Metal in eleven chapters:\n\n01. Ad Babalonis Amorem Do Dedico Omnia Nihilo\n\n02. In The Beginning\n\n03. Annihilation Mantra\n\n04. Waters Of Unravelling\n\n05. Bursting As Boils From The Backs Of Slaves\n\n06. The Lamb Speaks\n\n07. Agnus Dei\n\n08. Hour Of Contempt\n\n09. In The Heart Of The World\n\n10. Dies Irae\n\n11. Abomination Gate\n\nMixed and mastered by Dødsengel, the cover artwork was designed by Mitchell Nolte (BAEST, WEREWOLVES), while the layout & symbols were created by Jon Barghest. Band photos are courtesy of Nicolai Karlsen.\n\nSays Malach Adonai about the lyrics:\n\n“The lyrics were written during a time when I was dealing with death, disease and loss. Being a devoted Thelemite I found myself contemplating and working with the Goddess Babalon to a greater extent than earlier. In our system, she is the Gate of life and death, the portal of manifestation and incarnation, and much more. I found that work profoundly rewarding and inspiring, as a way to sublimate and explore the consequences of my experiences. I usually write in bursts of inspiration – a magickal journal, if you will – reflecting the Work I undergo. The cohesive theme of the album was born through that spontaneous and honest process.”\n\nThe band has a new single out, called Ad Babalonis Amorem Do Dedico Omnia Nihilo, watch it below. The release will be responsibility of Debemur Morti and its coming out on December 16th; Debermur Morti Productions: https://www.debemur-morti.com/en/\n\nPre-orders for all items via the label’s EU, US and Bandcamp shops will begin on October 7th, 9 AM CET. Save he date! Included: will be released on CD, vinyl and digitally, Two exclusive DMP vinyl editions (slipcase & book-like) and fitting merchandising (t-shirts/hoodies) will be available as well. Pre-orders for all items via the label’s EU, US and Bandcamp.\n\nRoderick Blutrache\n\nReading Time: 1 minute and 4 seconds.\n\nDecember 9th will present this GREAT compilation of demos.\n\nMaybe one of the most classic Black Metal bands, of all the times (Godkiller from Monaco) isn’t returning, but this compilation for the first time presents REMASTERED version of Ad Majorem Satanae Gloriam 1994 demo and the The Warlord 1995 demo for the very first time in CD, vinyl and digital format.\n\nAccording to the press release, this “compilation must be understood as a nostalgic link to the early Black Metal scene. Duke narrates:\n\n“The title is taken from the lyrics of a track featured on GODKILLER‘s first EP, “The Rebirth Of The Middle Ages”, entitled ‘The Neverending Reign Of The Black Knights’. “We Are The Black Knights” is a federating title that sums up what the Black Metal scene was at the time.”\n\nAlso according to the press release, the song Waiting For Lilith is already out there as a single to show the intention of the quality remaster of the demo and also as a single to compilation: the track can already be listened here: https://godkiller666.bandcamp.com/album/we-are-the-black-knights\n\n“As far as I remember, ‘Waiting For Lilith’ was the first track I wrote for the first demo, “Ad Majorem Satanae Gloriam” (1994). It is an energetic song, but it is punctuated by slower, darker, more depressive passages, with accompaniments of classical instruments (timpani, violins, church organ). This alternation of rhythms is one of the characteristics of GODKILLER‘s style. It is a mixture of Metal (Death and Black on this track) and more intimate atmospheres, inspired by a music not stemming from Metal, rather from the music of the 80s (DEAD CAN DANCE, BAUHAUS, THE CURE and so on) and classical music. The lyrics evoke a classic figure of Satanism: Lilith, Queen of the succubus. She is the incarnation of evil and the terror of women in childbirth, because she steals newborns to devour them.”\n\nStill according to press release:\n\n“We Are The Black Knights” will be released via Debemur Morti Productions on CD, vinyl (including an exclusive DMP version) and digitally, accompanied by a t-shirt design (men/women), on December 9th. Pre-orders via the label’s EU, US and Bandcamp shops will begin on October 7th.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01. March Of The Mediaeval War\n\n02. Waiting For Lilith\n\n03. Celebrate His Glory\n\n04. Those From The Race Of Cain\n\n05. Feasting The Coming Victory\n\n06. Path To The Unholy Frozen Empire\n\n08. Bren Det Hvite Riket\n\nRoderick Blutrache"
