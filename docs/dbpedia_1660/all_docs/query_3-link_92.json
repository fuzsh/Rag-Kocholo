        "text": "This edition includes more typos than ever thanks to my new kitten Dennis that insisted on strolling the keyboard as I tried to write this, and some records. To the metals…\n\nBoyfrndz – Impulse\n\nGenre: Progressive/Experimental\n\nOrigin: Austin, Texas\n\nLabel: Brutal Panda\n\nBuy now on Amazon.com\n\nSomewhere between Torche and The Mars Volta, or perhaps The Fall of Troy and newer Mastodon, you'll find Boyfrndz. So, a little stoner-y, a little math-y, and a lot more….y. The new record, and the band overall, is thoroughly unique and enjoyable.\n\nJim Breuer and The Loud & Rowdy – Songs From The Garage\n\nGenre: Comedy\n\nOrigin: Valley Stream, New York\n\nLabel: Metal Blade\n\nBuy now on Amazon.com\n\nThe SNL-Alumni has always dabbled with metal in his stand up, and it was only a matter of time until he dropped a full-on comedy metal record. I actually think he could release a proper metal record if he wanted to. His voice really works in a modern thrash setting.\n\nDeath Angel – The Evil Divide\n\nGenre: Thrash\n\nOrigin: San Francisco, California\n\nLabel: Nuclear Blast\n\nBuy now on Amazon.com\n\nJim Breuer could certainly drop a thrash record if he wanted to, but he should probably study up. His studies should start here. Death Angel have been one of thrash's most solid bands for a long while now, and in that time, quality has rarely dipped. This record is a band further cementing themselves as one of the best in their field.\n\nLacuna Coil – Delirium\n\nGenre: Gothic rock/metal\n\nOrigin: Milan, Italy\n\nLabel: Century Media\n\nBuy now on Amazon.com\n\nLacuna Coil are a band that rarely surprises their listeners. This time is different though. There are some moments when the band is going for the throat on this record. Some melodic death metal and some djentier rhythms are present, and they add some much needed freshness to this band. Best, and most interesting, release from them in a while.\n\nSix Feet Under – Graveyard Classics IV: The Number Of The Priest\n\nGenre: Death metal covers\n\nOrigin: Tampa, Florida\n\nLabel: Metal Blade\n\nBuy now on Amazon.com\n\nI think if Six Feet Under just became a cover band I'd be okay with it. Their long-running Graveyard Classics series has returned and they are sticking to just Judas Priest and Iron Maiden covers this time. So if you want your metal gods tuned real low and translated into gruff death metal, this is for you.\n\nSpell – For None And All\n\nGenre: Heavy metal\n\nOrigin: Vancouver, Canada\n\nLabel: Bad Omen\n\nBuy now on Amazon.com\n\nHere we have another one of those occult rock bands that are all the rage these days. This one, however, is one of the proggier and diverse ones I've heard. The Black Sabbath influence is strong, but they also clearly love the first few Iron Maiden albums, and maybe even some Rush. I've been coming back to this one a lot.\n\nThrice – To Be Everywhere Is To Be Nowhere\n\nGenre: Post-hardcore/Progressive rock\n\nOrigin: Irvine, California\n\nLabel: Vagrant\n\nBuy now on Amazon.com\n\nI'll take a moment for you to get your \"THIS ISN'T FUCKING METAL!\" and \"YOU TALKED ABOUT THIS INSTEAD OF (insert some O.G. death metal band you love that has been releasing the same derivative bullshit for two decades)!?!?\" complaints out of the way. Ready to listen now? Okay, good. Thrice are a band strongly rooted in the Orange County Emo/Screamo/Post-Hardcore/Whatever scene, and are often written off for being just that. I actually wrote them off initially. However, the band evolved into a rather interesting experimental rock band that brings the heavy in their mid to late period with albums like The Alchemy Index and Vheissu. This album is much more in that realm than their early OC material, and the band overall is probably better than (some!) readers give them credit for.\n\nAlso dropping today…"
