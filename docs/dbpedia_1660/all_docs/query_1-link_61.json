        "text": "Hail, how is the beer today ? Which albums will you pick while answering this interview ?\n\nAlcohol is for retards. Right now I'm listening to De Novissimis \"Nothing Grows Here\".\n\nCould you briefly introduce your band to readers ? When did you create MYRKR ? The band name means darkness, doesn't it ?\n\nYes the name means darkness, basic but effective. We started around mid 2004 as a two-piece and have remained so since.\n\nYour band is pretty new as you started in 2004, how old are you ? How do you feel yourself in front of older band members from Scandinavian B.M scene from bands such as Sorhin, Funeral Mist, The Black, Arckanum, Ofermod, Nastrond which started in the early 90' ?\n\nWe may not have started MYRKR as early as those bands, but we were both around then so we are old enough.\n\nThe first official MYRKR material was a 200 copies limited demo tape, \"Rekwiz\" that contained 3 tracks and an intro. How was the feed back then ?\n\nThe demo sold out pretty much straight away and had good feedback. Lots of labels contacted us and stuff. We had offers to release the demo too but we decided to do it by ourselves."
