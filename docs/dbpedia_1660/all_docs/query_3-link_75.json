        "text": "~\n\nGreetings, infernal warbröethers and all that. After a marathon stretch we’re finally here, hammering the last rusty nail into our 2020 LISTCRUSH series – the full-length albums that resonated most with me throughout 2020. At a cursory glance, Metal Archives has 3146 full-length black metal albums logged as being released last year. Of those, I probably only checked out around a thousand, tops. So remember: this is in no way a definitive list. I’m not the grand arbiter of taste or final word on anything. These are just the records that tickled my own personal blasphemy glands juuuust right.\n\nThe original shortlist was over 200 albums long and I’ve (excruciatingly) whittled it down to a hundred of the finest – there is no “near misses” section, because in a year in which we were absolutely spoiled for good music as most had much else better to do in quarantine, there are simply too many that would have very deservedly made the cut.\n\nThere are records that immediately blew my mind (number 92, number 2, number 8), records that crept up over time to become firm favourites (number 31), expected hypebeasts (number 4) and records that deserve FAR more attention (59, 63). There were things of beauty (58, 24) and ugliness (49, 38). There are records that I fell asleep to almost every night since they were released (number 3), thrilling new discoveries (95), old masters making a triumphant return (6)… and in the case of number ONE, records that unleashed their black irradiant glories extremely late in the year yet annihilated everything else that had come before.\n\nIf any of the album titles are highlighted, clicking that will take you to our coverage of the album (reviews, premieres, interviews and all that good stuff). This list is strictly black/blackened, so if you’d like recommendations for other genres hit me up – for example my top death metal album was Ulcerate, of course, followed by Atræ Bilis. I’d probably give label of the year to the untouchable Debemur Morti Productions and if you want to check out what I consider to be the strongest demos, EPs or Splits I heard last year, read Part 1 HERE and Part 2 HERE.\n\nThat’s it. Have at it, Listcrush is finally done for another year. Hails.\n\n~\n\nTOP 100 ALBUMS OF 2020\n\n100. FORTRESS OF THE OLDEN DAYS – Verlassenheit (Worship Tapes / A Pile Of Graves)\n\n99.

KOMMODUS – Kommodus (GoatowaRex)\n\n~\n\n1. ABIGOR – Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook) (World Terror Committee)\n\nI originally intended to keep it simple and wasn’t going to write anything at all about any album on this list, but I simply have to say a few words about this diabolical gem. After TT blew me away at the death of 2019 with the dazzling NEDXXX (well, personnel are still as-yet unconfirmed but I’d bet a solid hundred that he and Rune from Shaarimoth were involved) he’s done it again with Abigor‘s twelfth album, Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook). I’ve been listening to these nine tracks repeatedly since release and over countless spins each experience brings something new to appreciate and astound – be it tiny details in each intricate composition, or an entirely new favourite track each time. Silenius from Summoning puts in what may be the best performance of his life here, too – I liked Höllenzwang, but this proves Abigor remain at the absolute top of the game. I mean, just check out the final moments of album closer ‘Terrorkommando Eligos’ – what other band would have the testicular fortitude and sheer unbridled ability to pull off what’s ostensibly a minute or two of wild, slavering, black metal drum & bass?\n\nTHIS is, hands down, the best black metal album of the year for me. Listen to it. Hail Abigor.\n\n~\n\nUltimate respect to all artists, labels, writers and supporters of the black arts. You are all lords.\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\n~\n\nA grey emptiness, unfolding\n\nSickness bled out\n\n~\n\nGood news, for those attuned to such frequencies: unleashed in all its glory upon this very day is King of the Silent World, the third full-length by Australian wraths GRAVEIR.\n\nIf I can get a little personal here for a moment, one of my favourite aspects of the uniquely melancholic maelstrom of malady this five-piece effortlessly conjure has always been the thematic detail they put into their songs. Rather than phone-in the same tired black metal clichés (that all too often act as background noise at most when listening to an album) they instead never fail to intrigue; always exploring the most interesting of topics. Whether it’s tales of blood eagles on their first full-length Iconostasis or the Dyatlov Pass Incident on 2018’s superb Cenotaph the listener is always left spellbound by the additional layer added to the experience, wanting to dig deeper… and that’s despite never making their lyrics available to the public.\n\nThat’s exactly what happened to me after we premiered the incredible third album track ‘The Fetch of Crooked Spine’ just under a week ago now. I simply had to know more… so, for the second part of our coverage of this remarkable album, we are honoured and excited to host vocalist Gloom as he takes our hand and leads us through a track by track walkthrough. Although their lyrics may never be revealed, his commentary allows us to glean a moment’s invaluable insight into these hymns of malignant madness – alongside a display of the incredible artwork created specifically for each track by the preternaturally talented Danielle Sera for an entirely immersive, multi-faceted experience. So read on, dive into the bleakness, thick and viscous… and enter the wretched beauty of the Silent World. There’s nothing else like it.\n\n~\n\n1. Charnel Bacchanalia\n\n“A celebration and reverence of death. As humans death is one of our greatest fears, we avoid it and labour under the delusions that “all life is precious”. The thought of decay is glossed over, we do our best to beautify the event but would ignore the deaths we create through carelessness, dehumanising others, for sustenance, for land and resources or politics. Death is an inexorable part of the cycle. It is a constant, we will be forced to confront our delusions. This song asks us to lean in and stare our mortality in the face and be thankful for it.\n\nVvoid joined us after the writing for the album was done but we had him add the opening lead so that there would be some of his input on the album. He did a more than admirable job stepping into the band and the album wouldn’t have been what it was without him. I am greatly looking forward to more of his contributions for our next release.”\n\n~\n\n2. Scaphism\n\n“This is a fairly literal depiction of Scaphism, an ancient form of Persian execution (though its legitimacy is disputed). The condemned was fed milk and honey and enclosed in two boats where they would be exposed to the elements, starve, dehydrate, get infected from laying in their own filth and be slowly consumed by insects and vermin. What fascinated me about this is the level of creativity and the lengths to which human ingenuity will stretch to inflict cruelty on one another. Whether real or not there are plenty of other examples past and present of the things that we will do to one another.\n\nThe other interesting element is the psychology, devising a punishment so cruel and unusual that it could only inflict terror in the general populace. Fear can compel a populace to bend its knee to many things that would otherwise be considered unconscionable.”\n\n~\n\n3. The Fetch of Crooked Spine\n\n“A fetch is a doppelganger that would appear to people when they were about to die. This reaches right into our fear of mortality, the overwhelming anxiety of the malign apparition drives the subject to suicide creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. The open question is what does knowing you are going to die ultimately mean? With acceptance would the subjects end have been less violent and their last days filled with anxiety?\n\nMusically the song ends with the opening riff and no vocals. This is to reflect the passing of the narrator and to reflect life and death as a cycle.”\n\n~\n\n4. Bathed in Acheron\n\n“This song depicts suicide by drowning, pulling in references from Greek mythology. Acheron is the River of Woe in the underworld. In this song it represents despair and sadness, being baptised/bathed in it is the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n\nIt also references the tale of Narcissus who, lured by a nymph to a pool became entranced by his own reflection and ended up drowning himself. This represents fixation on oneself, an inability to get out of our own heads. The tunnel vision that can lead to tragic outcomes.\n\nFinally, this song contains the album title King of the Silent World. This has two elements to it – firstly it is a euphemism for death. Death is the point we cease to talk, cease to breathe, think, hope, have dreams we fall silent. The Silent World was also the title of a Jacques Cousteau documentary so it is a reference to the eerie serenity that you feel when underwater.\n\nThis song was originally going to be instrumental as I couldn’t work out how to tackle it but it came to me in the end, which I think was the right outcome.”\n\n~\n\n5. In Remnant Light\n\n“The burdens of guilt, negative emotions can weigh us down as can parasitic people. We can carry this baggage with us so that it poisons our future and colours of view of the world, our decision making and limits our ability to succeed. This song is about being willing to go through suffering to cast off these ghosts and find strength.\n\nWe fear pain, injury, and scars but they can be valuable. Struggle helps us grow, scars teach lessons and toughen us. Sometimes you must cut off a limb to save our lives. We do well to remember this and be ok with discomfort if we can see the end goal is freeing.”\n\n~\n\n6. Immacolata\n\n“Immacolata means immaculate and is typically tied in Catholicism to the Immaculate Conception. Too often we see cases of violence there are elements of this at play. A sense of ownership, a need to control, professions of love, lust and desire and sadly a conclusion in violence.\n\nThe subject of this song is entranced by this woman that he has idolized and put onto a pedestal. He desires her but she is unattainable. In awe of her power and beauty, he overlooks that she is cruel and poisonous. He is simultaneously disgusted by his weakness and is torn between desires of lust and destruction.\n\nThis is really a case of ugly people doing ugly things to one another and the complicated dynamics and emotions that come with that. That’s uncomfortable territory and opens up a whole lot of questions, but the purpose of most of my writing is not to definitely answer any of them but to offer perspectives and get people to think about what they mean.”\n\n~\n\n7. Waiting…\n\n“A look into the mind of a monster. I think we often tend to label people who do horrible things as monsters as it creates distance from them being people. Those behaviours are us, the worst parts of our natures that we gloss over or that lie dormant until nudged into existence through our life experiences or illnesses.\n\nThe subject is wrestling with dark desires, acknowledging that they are wrong but being drawn into a spiral of obsession.\n\nThe mid-section of the song has the same underlying riff which increases in tempo each cycle to reflect an ever more feverish and manic mental state.”\n\n~\n\n8. Fodder for the Gears\n\n“This is a Cronenbergian vision of the cruelties that can be inflicted in the pursuit of growth, productivity and profit taken to a dystopian endpoint. Bodies are fed through the gears as fuel for dark machinery, every hungry and without emotion.\n\nAs a real world example you can look at child labour, or the Foxconn Suicides, or the potential implications that could come as a result of using Artificial Intelligence to replace human decision making.”\n\n~\n\n9. Phantasms in Daguerreotype\n\n“This song was about impending mortality, old age and reflecting back on a lifetime of regrets. This is played out through the subject looking at an old photograph of their younger self, untroubled by life and full of potential.\n\nBoth are unable to move forward, the younger idealized self quite literally and the subject through being hung up on mourning over not being their idealized self and facing the twilight of their life.\n\nThe phantasms part comes from degradation of the prints resulting in what appeared to be ghosts in the photos. This is a metaphor for being haunted by the past and failing to live in the present. Life only moves forward or stops, it is impossible to go back to past glories.”\n\n~\n\n10. Father, Devourer\n\n“This looks at the story of Saturn devouring his children as an allegory for the inevitable cycle of entropy. That which is young and beautiful will wither and die. It is the inescapable cycle. Saturn is literally time, death and age devouring youth and vitality. Saturn is a slave to his actions as he is a monster.\n\nThis ties off the overarching themes of death and the human experience that underpin the album. I try to focus on experiences or concepts that are fundamental to who we are whether they are parts we would like to acknowledge or not. These will be spun into more fantastical forms, not unlike myths and fables of old as a way to help convey very real things about our nature and our society.”\n\n~\n\nKing of the Silent World is available now via Impure Sounds and Brilliant Emperor.\n\n~\n\nPurchase King of the Silent World digitally from the Graveir Bandcamp HERE, on 2LP from the Impure Sounds webstore HERE and on cassette from the Brilliant Emperor webstore HERE.\n\nSupport GRAVEIR:\n\nOfficial Facebook\n\nOfficial Bandcamp\n\nOfficial Website\n\nOfficial Instagram\n\n~\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more kvlt sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\nAnd thus, the world was plunged into darkness once more. Picking up where we left off in our interview with frontman Gloom for the first part of our coverage of the Australian wraith’s upcoming new release ‘Cenotaph’, the time has come recite the necessary incantations and take a deeper look at this great release.\n\nA little history for those who missed part one and can’t be bothered clicking back: the embryonic stirrings of Graveir began in 2009 and eventually blossomed over time into the full rotting flower we see today, resplendent in filth. Currently consisting of Pandora on bass (also doing time in the excellent Moon), skinsman XI (ex-Moon, ex-Dead River Runs Dry, ex-Vyrion and more), the twin obscenities of Emaciation (Arms of the Abyss, Defamer, Tower of Fire) and Alone on guitars plus Gloom (ex-The Silenced) tearing his throat to pieces in the name of art, ‘Cenotaph’ is the project’s fourth release overall and follows their superb end-of-year-list -making split with Mar Mortuum from 2017.\n\nIf their contribution to that split was superb, they’ve taken things another step further on this EP. As ‘Sanguine Inferno’ bursts to life in sorrowful dissonance and begins to traverse it’s darkened path, you’re struck by the deep melodious bleakness in their sound; throughout the course of the journey it’s as if the songs try to take flight but are weighted down by utter hopelessness. Which is a very good thing, a definite honing of their abilities and focus has taken place here and the EP reaches down into depths no sentient being should ever have to experience.\n\n‘Dyatlov’ draws inspiration from the Dyatlov Pass Incident that occurred in an almost impassable region of Russia’s frozen Ural mountains in 1959. The bodies of nine ski hikers were found scattered and damaged by an “unknown compelling force” whilst apparently attempting to flee their tent (which had been destroyed from the inside), skulls and ribs smashed. One woman had her tongue cut out, some were dressed only in socks and undergarments in the freezing snow. The mystery of what took place that night remains unsolved to this day; and it’s a fitting theme for this track as it surges through the mire, its haunting misery punctuated by violent throes of horror. One of my favourites on the EP and one in which you realise how unusually prominent and integral to their sound the basswork is, as Pandora‘s sinister rumble and dreadful tones add menace and instill a real fear of the unknown. Very welcome and effective here, providing the sinewed muscle to XI‘s winding percussive backbone.\n\nEP centrepiece ‘Whips’ continues in dysphoric form, piling the melancholia on even harder before it then flies into a tempestuous rage. Despite their relatively short run times I find the tracks deceptively epic and expansive in their progression, there’s a depth to each one that reveals itself further and further with each listen. On the latter half of ‘Droit De Seigneur’ Gloom and Emaciation‘s dual vocal assault is utterly terrifying, while Alone‘s guitars sound like that door tucked away in the darkest reaches of your mind that hides and locks away all the unspeakable things has been ripped from its hinges. Both great songs, but they save the best until last: ‘New Gods (Drowning the Sun)’.\n\nIt might just be because I’ve spent the most time with this particular track overall, but it fucking kills. The moods it taps into, the true despair and intensity; frontman Gloom said in our interview that it decribes “the building of the new order over the bones of the old, through bloodshed”, which is not only a fitting theme for this piece but also the EP as a whole. Graveir are building a new order for themselves here, perfecting their formula and crushing everything in their path in the process.\n\nIt may sound like I’m just blowing hyperbole but I honestly am quite partial to this release. There’s a raw charm to their morose melodic power and a sense of integrity to the sound and songs, you can tell they’ve been crafted with care. The overall production hits me just right and sounds like the audio equivalent of dead things reaching out to consume your flesh. Which will most likely be while you still breathe and remain totally cognizant of what is taking place, but… Not quite yet. No, this is the sound of that fleeting moment in between life and death, when you’re frozen and everything stretches into eternity, forcibly aware of your own fragile mortality and its impending end. Each time you visit this world it pulls you further and further down… And I haven’t even mentioned the fantastic Norot Art cover artwork yet. Just look at it.\n\nA killer EP, one that spells big things for the impious lot. Vinyl and shirt pre-orders available now from the ultimate purveyors of misanthropic art down under, Impure Sounds.

Fresh off the back of contributing to one of the greatest splits of 2017, the Australian horde of Gloom, Alone, Emaciated, XI and Pandora have announced a new EP about to seep out and spread its insidious influence across the earth: the mighty ‘Cenotaph’.\n\nIt’s available for pre-order as we speak and I’ll be taking a more in-depth look into its wretched majesty when the time arises, but for now we can feast our ears upon the stellar teaser track ‘New Gods (Drowning the Sun)’. The horrifyingly dissonant guitars and depraved multi-pronged vocal assault contained within head up what I believe to be their strongest recorded work to date; and I’m extremely pleased to say I was fortunate enough to sit down with throatsman Gloom to discuss the track, the EP itself and all things Graveir. So have a listen at the link below, and read on.\n\n~\n\nGreetings Gloom, sincerest thanks for speaking to us. First up, a little history: What inspired the creation of Graveir, and what is its purpose?\n\n– The genesis of Graveir really started in 2009 as a vehicle for me to write the kind of music I was interested in. It’s not for everyone so I’d found myself playing in things more out of friendship. There was always compromise rather than a full creative expression. There was no real timeline on it, just a collection of riffs which ended up being the genesis of the songs on the demo.\n\nI think it was around 2012 I met XI and found we were pretty much on the same wavelength. Being a particularly driven individual, once I showed him what I had been working on that was enough to set things on the path. Pretty quickly we’d demoed the songs. Admittedly these were pretty rudimentary given my lack of technical ability and preparation at the time but these helped us to form the remainder of the lineup in late 2013. I am pleased to say it has progressed from those humble beginnings much further than I would ever have expected.\n\nAs for its purpose, I am generally interested in the interplay between the sacred and the profane so sonically I wanted something that had a definite sense of melody but also felt slightly unsettling at the same time. At least to my ears, t’s the friction between the two that helps create the atmosphere in our music.\n\nYou have a new EP on the way, titled ‘Cenotaph’. How do you feel about it, did everything turn out exactly as planned? What was the creative process like?\n\n– I think we will never be 100% satisfied with anything, no matter how good it is. This is healthy as prevents stagnation but it becomes important to know when to let something go and release it. People will ultimately make of it what they will. I am comfortable with the release – which is as close to happy as you should ever realistically be.\n\nThe recording was definitely a positive experience. We recorded locally so there wasn’t any time pressures and all of our equipment was available to us. Ean Redman, who recorded and mixed the album is someone we know on a personal level so the recording environment was very good. Tonally I think we got some good sounds from the instruments.\n\nThe writing process itself is fairly painless, new material comes easily to us. As for how it comes together, someone will demo guitars and guide drums for a song and send it around for initial opinions and if it is received well we take it to rehearsal and adjust it until we have a finished version and I’ll add lyrics to it from there.\n\nThe dictionary defines a ‘Cenotaph’ as: “a monument, sometimes in the form of a tomb, to a person or group of persons buried elsewhere”. Why did you select this as the title?\n\n– It came from the lyrics for New Gods (Drowning the Sun) and seemed fitting for the overall tone of the album and the artwork. In a more literal sense it does serve as somewhat of a monument between where we have come from and to where things are heading.\n\nThe first teaser track is the aforementioned ‘New Gods (Drowning the Sun)’ and in my opinion is another huge step forward from everything you’ve done before, oozing with a bleak and unsettling menace. Can you describe the themes and intentions behind the track?\n\n– Definitely – the lyrics centre around the cycle of domination and violence that come with change. More specifically changing of religion within a society. What we often refer to as mythology is really an insulting way of denigrating what was previously the dominant religion of a society i.e. “That was all make believe, what I am telling you now is the one and only truth.”. The song describes the building of the new order over the bones of the old through bloodshed.\n\nListening through from your last full-length ‘Iconostasis‘ and the great 2017 split with Mar Mortuum you can really hear the refinement of certain aspects of your sound, such as the development of a mutidimensional vocal assault that proves to be devastatingly effective. What would you say the biggest progression or development has been for Graveir since ‘Iconostasis’?\n\n– There are three key things I’d point to as having the biggest impact on our sound to date.\n\nThe first thing that happened is that after the demo I was able to share more of the songwriting duties and this has continued to increase over time. We try to make sure everyone has had some songwriting contribution on all our releases but the composition of this has shifted. For example on Iconostasis if one of us wrote a song we would normally write both guitar parts before sending it to everyone. Now we will often write one guitar track then send it to either Alone or Emaciation to complete which often adds a different perspective to things.\n\nThe second thing is improving as musicians over time. This has enabled us to stretch our songwriting and technical abilities. Listening to a demo from 2009 versus today this becomes very apparent. This one is especially true for me.\n\nFinally, Emaciation adding additional vocals has really helped add some additional depth into the songs both live and on the newer material.\n\nThere will also be a track on the EP titled ‘Dyatlov’. I’m curious, because if I’m correct this is something that has always fascinated me: Would this be referring to the Dyatlov Pass Incident? If so, can you tell us a little about why you chose to write about it?\n\n– You are correct, it is referring to the events that occurred in Dyatlov Pass. The title was initially just a working title, which will often change once I actually start writing lyrics. However after doing a bit more reading and research I found it a particularly fascinating topic.\n\nWhat makes the Dyatlov Pass Incident a compelling case may be more to do with the level of development of forensic science as well as the propensity for secrecy on the part of the Soviet government.\n\nIf I had to take my best guess I think it was something of a military nature, perhaps air mines or some other weapon capable of generating significant concussive force. The interest for me lyrically was the thought of the isolation and the unforeseen terror that would have followed.\n\nThe EP will be adorned with evocative cover artwork by incredible occult artist Norot Art. How did this come about, were you big fans of his work? How does the resulting image tie in with the themes of the EP?\n\n– Essentially just by being fans of his artwork. From there we made contact and he agreed to do the artwork. He has done a stellar job and we are extremely happy with the end result. Our approach when contacting artists is to give them a listen to the songs, lyrics and titles to enable them to draw out what resonates with them and draw something based off that. We give little to no instruction or guidance beyond that. So, given that it draws from the source material I think it fits the overarching themes on the EP (which are essentially meditations on the nature of death, suffering and change) quite well.\n\n‘Cenotaph’ will see the continuation of your recent partnership with the great underground Australian label Impure Sounds. How has it been to work with them?\n\n– No complaints whatsoever. Graveir isn’t a money-making venture so any notions to that effect are easily dispensed of so long as you aren’t being exploited. What then becomes important is finding someone who will show as much care for the release as we have in making it and that on a personal level we are dealing with people we respect, like and trust.\n\nWe know the EP is in good hands so it is a largely stress-free process for us. Impure Sounds don’t run a massive release schedule so can give each release they put out care and attention it deserves. We have nothing but positive things to say about the label and would gladly work with them again.\n\nI know you’ve been playing a few live shows of late, have you aired any of the new material and was it received well?\n\n– This is always a balancing act as you don’t want to play all the new songs months ahead of the EP release otherwise there isn’t all that much excitement around the new material for the audience. Recent shows we’ve done one or two songs just to test them out in a live setting and to add a something unexpected to the setlist.\n\nWe did do a set of the EP material late last year at an event hosted by our friends the Brewditos. Given the excellent quality of the beer on offer and their support over the past few years we thought we should repay the favour with something special. Hard to say how much of it was the beer but the reception was very positive.\n\nFor the uninitiated, what can one expect from a Graveir live ritual?\n\n– Great question – I think you can expect to hear a close representation of what is on the recordings. For the most part we don’t record anything we can’t re-create live and we avoid using anything overly processed so I think this translates well in the live setting only with a bit more of a feral energy to it. Outside of that you should expect a sufficiently bleak atmosphere.\n\nAustralia has a killer black metal scene. Are there any sorely underrated Australian bands that you believe deserve more widespread attention?\n\n– Completely agree with that sentiment. I think there are some bands that are getting some well-deserved recognition at the moment such as Départe and Greytomb which I hope continues as they have both produced some excellent releases.\n\nOn the other side of the equation there are some excellent bands who I think are due a bit more than they might currently have. Ignis Gehenna, Convulsing, Siberian Hell Sounds, Norse, Bleakwood, Snorri, Ploughshare, Mar Mortuum, Host and Dødknell have all put out great releases in the past year or two. I’d also be interested in a follow up from Dead River Runs Dry as I thoroughly enjoyed the first album. I will miss Funeral Moon who were great and were over all too soon.\n\nWhen can we expect the full EP to drop? Will it be on vinyl, CD, cassette?\n\n– Release date will be April 20th and will be vinyl and digital only at this stage. CDs may come later but I think it depends on the level of interest.\n\nSincerest thanks for your time, Gloom. Very keen to hear the rest of the EP. Any last words?\n\n– Thank you for the well-thought out questions, it has been a pleasure answering them. I hope I have answered them sufficiently. I will be interested to hear what you think of the rest of the EP once it is out.\n\n~\n\nPre-order ‘Cenotaph’ on vinyl or digital from Impure Sounds here.\n\nSupport Graveir:\n\nOfficial Facebook\n\nOfficial Bandcamp\n\nOfficial YouTube\n\n~\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more kvlt sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com"
