        "text": "~\n\nGreetings, infernal warbröethers and all that. After a marathon stretch we’re finally here, hammering the last rusty nail into our 2020 LISTCRUSH series – the full-length albums that resonated most with me throughout 2020. At a cursory glance, Metal Archives has 3146 full-length black metal albums logged as being released last year. Of those, I probably only checked out around a thousand, tops. So remember: this is in no way a definitive list. I’m not the grand arbiter of taste or final word on anything. These are just the records that tickled my own personal blasphemy glands juuuust right.\n\nThe original shortlist was over 200 albums long and I’ve (excruciatingly) whittled it down to a hundred of the finest – there is no “near misses” section, because in a year in which we were absolutely spoiled for good music as most had much else better to do in quarantine, there are simply too many that would have very deservedly made the cut.\n\nThere are records that immediately blew my mind (number 92, number 2, number 8), records that crept up over time to become firm favourites (number 31), expected hypebeasts (number 4) and records that deserve FAR more attention (59, 63). There were things of beauty (58, 24) and ugliness (49, 38). There are records that I fell asleep to almost every night since they were released (number 3), thrilling new discoveries (95), old masters making a triumphant return (6)… and in the case of number ONE, records that unleashed their black irradiant glories extremely late in the year yet annihilated everything else that had come before.\n\nIf any of the album titles are highlighted, clicking that will take you to our coverage of the album (reviews, premieres, interviews and all that good stuff). This list is strictly black/blackened, so if you’d like recommendations for other genres hit me up – for example my top death metal album was Ulcerate, of course, followed by Atræ Bilis. I’d probably give label of the year to the untouchable Debemur Morti Productions and if you want to check out what I consider to be the strongest demos, EPs or Splits I heard last year, read Part 1 HERE and Part 2 HERE.\n\nThat’s it. Have at it, Listcrush is finally done for another year. Hails.\n\n~\n\nTOP 100 ALBUMS OF 2020\n\n100. FORTRESS OF THE OLDEN DAYS – Verlassenheit (Worship Tapes / A Pile Of Graves)\n\n99.

KOMMODUS – Kommodus (GoatowaRex)\n\n~\n\n1. ABIGOR – Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook) (World Terror Committee)\n\nI originally intended to keep it simple and wasn’t going to write anything at all about any album on this list, but I simply have to say a few words about this diabolical gem. After TT blew me away at the death of 2019 with the dazzling NEDXXX (well, personnel are still as-yet unconfirmed but I’d bet a solid hundred that he and Rune from Shaarimoth were involved) he’s done it again with Abigor‘s twelfth album, Totschläger (A Saintslayer’s Songbook). I’ve been listening to these nine tracks repeatedly since release and over countless spins each experience brings something new to appreciate and astound – be it tiny details in each intricate composition, or an entirely new favourite track each time. Silenius from Summoning puts in what may be the best performance of his life here, too – I liked Höllenzwang, but this proves Abigor remain at the absolute top of the game. I mean, just check out the final moments of album closer ‘Terrorkommando Eligos’ – what other band would have the testicular fortitude and sheer unbridled ability to pull off what’s ostensibly a minute or two of wild, slavering, black metal drum & bass?\n\nTHIS is, hands down, the best black metal album of the year for me. Listen to it. Hail Abigor.\n\n~\n\nUltimate respect to all artists, labels, writers and supporters of the black arts. You are all lords.\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\n~\n\nTales Of Anguish\n\n~\n\nIndividualism is a core tenet of black metal. Right from the first stirrings of the second wave, achieving something unique with your art against what everyone else was already doing was a prized quality to have. Whilst this may seem to be becoming all the more difficult to attain in the current era as the constant glut of new bands ensure almost every conceivable angle has been taken, Venezuelan/Chilean project SELBST has achieved this by the most pure and subtle of ways – focusing wholly on the individual.\n\nSelbst‘s second album Relatos De Angustia (“Tales Of Anguish”) might indeed have a range of influences apparent, but there’s a sense that none of it is contrived or even intentional – it’s all sourced and delivered from the internal workings of main man N, who seems largely unconcerned with anything besides a laser focus on expressing what is within at the most microcosmic and macrocosmic levels, with complete honesty. This intensely internal focus has resulted in something wholly individualist and quite unique – yes, there might be musical touchpoints to other established acts but immersion into the depths of Relatos De Angustia shows, as it is allowed to sink in, that nothing is quite like Selbst.\n\nThe album is astonishingly deep. Immense, yet intricately detailed. Every time I listen to it I’m blown away by just how fucking good it is. Each experience leads to discovery of undiscovered nuances arising from the complexity, and tracks like ‘Silent Soul Throes’ or ‘Sculpting the Dirtiness of its Existence are simply amongst the best pieces of musical art composed this year. N and his partners (in this case Nebiros Sad of Gates Of Tyrant and Missa Mortvm on session drums, with a guest clean vocal spot from Rogger Canonico) wield the torrents of crushing emotion they conjure with a deft touch; allowing them to either soar or sledgehammer-obliterate in equal measure. As soon as I heard it a few months ago I knew it would feature in many, many end of year lists and it has been in regular rotation ever since. It’s hands-down the best thing the project has ever done, the culmination of everything they’ve been working towards – their masterwork.\n\nSo why has it taken BMD so long to cover this incredible album? Because we have been working on an interview with N himself for some time, which we present below alongside a full-stream of the album for those who somehow haven’t heard it yet.\n\nSo read on, click play on the majestic otherness and soul-searing humanity of Relatos De Angustia, pick up one of the precious few remaining physical copies via Debemur Morti Productions… and lose yourself in these tales of anguish.\n\n~\n\n~\n\nGreetings, N. It’s a pleasure to be speaking with you once again, this time for the recent release of the immense second Selbst full-length, Relatos De Angustia. Now that the album has been out for a little while and you’re beginning to have the benefit of hindsight – did you achieve everything you wanted to with the record? Did you have any particular aims in mind when you first began the creative process?\n\n– The pleasure of being here is mine! The truth is that the positive reception that the album has had, so far, has been a pleasant surprise to me. To be honest, even though I felt a bit of pressure because it was going to be my first release for this new label, I had nothing in mind but to be moved by creation and make music, trying to get a new and different album in comparison with what I had done before. I didn’t want to repeat myself.\n\nI’ve seen some huge praise being heaped upon the record, and personally I think it’s the best work you’ve done to date. Has the reception to it surprised you at all?\n\n– Thanks for that! The truth is again that it has been a total surprise. I felt a bit insecure when the album was about to come out, because it was also the first time that I was recording the voice for a full length and that was one of the most difficult things to do for me. I didn’t know what types of opinions people were going to have due to the great change that was coming. It has been flattering to see that the change in the voice has been something positive, based on the feedback I’ve got since the beginning.\n\nYes, this album also marks the first time that you have stepped behind the microphone and taken over vocals for Selbst – and just quietly, the vocals are indeed fucking excellent! What happened to Nicolás, and why did you decide to perform the vocals yourself?\n\n– With Nicolás Onfray, everything ended very well. He’s focused on his band Animus Mortis, as far as I know. The issue was that I did not feel comfortable having someone else sing these songs that are so personal to me. It felt like something was missing or out of place. In addition, the change ended up being beneficial, since with the whole thing of playing live, it is much more practical to have fewer members. Everything flows in a simpler and more harmonious way if there are fewer people, in my opinion.\n\nIs this the first time you have ever been a vocalist? If so, did you find it challenging in any way?\n\n– Yes, first time in my life. I had recorded the vocals for the cover I did for Hirilorn last year, but beyond that, nothing more. I had been doing the vocals live since approximately 2018, and well I always recorded the phrases for my previous vocalist and for Nicolás as well, so I was always practicing in some way. It was a great experience and it helped me to strengthen myself in that regard. It was an incredible personal achievement to finally be able to pull it off on a recording!\n\nYou definitely pulled it off! Now, the title translates to “Tales Of Anguish”, and the album is certainly a tour-de-force of intense emotions. Are these stories personal? How much of yourself did you put into the record?\n\n– My music has always been a very personal reflection of myself, and this is something that I have definitely strengthened even more on this album. “Tales of Anguish” is a journey through the darkest corners of my consciousness, my frustrations and my sometimes inability to see things in a color that I can describe as the only nuance capable of describing existence, which is not other than a sad and desolated gray…\n\nI feel this would tie in with the cover art – a fascinating and disturbing sculpture by Fabio Rincones. Can you tell us a little about this art? What is it intended to signify?\n\n– The visual representation of this individual devouring himself definitely represents what this album is saying in its lyrics. It was a concept that Fabio and I worked on with the intention of transmitting in a conceptual but clear way the message of “Stories of Anguish”, which is this kind of third-person narration of an alienated and isolated individual, mired in his own misery, that is slowly consumed by the product that emerged from the depths of his being… his work.\n\nThe tortured artist, consumed by his work… I can certainly imagine the creation of a Selbst album takes a lot out of you. Touching on the sound of the album for a moment, the press release likens Selbst to a mixture of the French and Icelandic scenes, and I’ve thought the same myself – but what do YOU feel has actually gone into the creation of the Selbst musical palette? What have been your main inspirations for the sound of Relatos De Angustia and Selbst in general?\n\n– Consciously I have not tried to go in one direction or another, I think that this is something that has happened unintentionally, or so people in general see it. I think that in Selbst’s music there is a bit of everything I listen to, which goes through both black metal and anything else that has nothing to do with it. I feel like I have a kind of tendency to compose melancholic riffs.\n\nThey are powerfully melancholic. Now, moving to labels – the album has been released by the impeccable Debemur Morti Productions, one of my favourite labels. What led to the jump from Sun & Moon records to Debemur Morti?\n\n– This was not planned in any way, it was something that just happened hahahaha. After the first album came out under Sun & Moon Records, I got an email from Debemur Morti Productions one day – they were offering me a deal, I couldn’t believe it. From there, we started to negotiate and the rest is history. I have no complaints about my previous labels in general; I think that at their level, each one made important contributions in the history of Selbst. And that is something that I am truly thankful for and deeply appreciate.\n\nAnd speaking of labels, it would be remiss of me to not also ask – many readers may know that you also own and run Unpleasant Records. What’s going on with your own label at the moment? Do you have any releases lined up for the future?\n\n– The truth is that I have left this project a bit forgotten at the moment. The last thing I did was to release the Nox Desperatio – Incineratio Arcana Nocte CD, but after that, I focused entirely on the new Selbst. I have been active with the distro, but I have nothing planned for the near future at the moment… although, this may change!\n\nI hope so, Unpleasant Records is a great label. How are things looking on the live front? Do you have any shows lined up where we will be able to see this new material performed in the flesh?\n\n– Terrible, hahahaha. With the coronavirus disaster, we even lost our space in a monthly rehearsal room where we were doing great. We haven’t rehearsed the whole band since last year, so there is still a lot of work to be done to get back on stage. I hope to be able to resume the rehearsals as soon as the quarantine issue fully passes here in Santiago.\n\nIf I am correct, “Selbst” translates as “Itself”, which is a very unique name for a black metal band – but is also remarkably emblematic of what I perceive to be the rather unique and individualist nature of your art. Given that this year marks exactly ten years since the birth of Selbst, how do you feel the project has grown since its inception? Have your motivations changed for it at all?\n\n– My personal motivation has only grown over the years, I can assure you of that! It has been an enriching experience for me as an individual, without a doubt. I think that my way of composing has matured enormously and I am increasingly satisfied with the achievements I have had. Time has flown by, without realizing it I’ve been creating music for Selbst for 10 years!\n\nSpeaking of; do you have anything special planned to mark that ten year anniversary?\n\n– There is something that I still have pending with Sun & Moon Records, but I have to wait to be able to announce it… I think that if it happens as I have planned, it would be a great way to celebrate it!\n\nAnd finally – with Relatos De Angustia completed and set free into the world, what now? Have you begun to work on any new music?\n\n– Oh not at all haha, I feel creatively exhausted right now as I have every time I’ve finished a recording before. I will need a good time to recover and begin to consider new material. I prefer things to flow naturally in that regard. I think I’ll focus more on promoting this album and hopefully we can resume rehearsals and events, as soon as this shitty coronavirus situation passes…\n\nSincerest thanks once again for your time, N. It has been a pleasure. Any final words or wisdom for us all?\n\n– Thank you for the constant support! To finish, I would like to let the people know that Selbst will be on the online version of the Mexico Black Metal Fest that will be totally free. You can stay tuned by updating our social networking.\n\nRelatos De Angustia is available now via Debemur Morti Productions.\n\n~\n\nPurchase Relatos De Angustia on CD, digital, LP and cassette from Bandcamp HERE or from the Debemur Morti webstore HERE.\n\nSupport SELBST:\n\nOfficial Facebook\n\nOfficial Bandcamp\n\nOfficial Website\n\nOfficial YouTube\n\nOfficial Instagram\n\n~\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more cult sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\nUNPLEASANT: /ʌnˈplɛz(ə)nt/\n\n(adjective)\n\ncausing discomfort, unhappiness, or revulsion; disagreeable.\n\n~\n\nContinuing the theme of great underground labels in this run of BMD Label Spotlights, today we have an excellent newcomer that deserves your unwavering attention: the ChileanUnpleasant Records. Only active for a year thus far, the label does exactly what a good label should – dig up the best artists from deep in the caverns of musical obscurity (some of these artists have no social media pages or much online presence at all) and drag them into the sunlight for the world to appreciate.\n\nIt’s also run by none other than the enigmatic N from Chilean/Venezuelan black masters Selbst, who took the time to sit down with us and chat about all things Unpleasant. But before we get to that, let’s have a quick look at the label’s first triptych of killer cassette releases:\n\n~\n\nFirst, FOSA. Demo MMXVI was originally recorded in 2016 and this nihilistic carnage definitely deserved a revisit. Punishing, relentless crusty black fury with crushing tones meets a deep, deceptive melodicism and even a sliver of slithering dissonance and black noise; all capped off with hellish, proselytizing vocals and riffs that could crack open the earth, this celebration of all things negative is a winner from start to finish. Seriously, every track is incredible and the raw power in their sound is immense. I really fucking love this demo, and I’m shattered that by the time I discovered Unpleasant Records I’d already missed this tape. Jump on this at name-your-price download… while crossing your fingers for a repress. Oh, and it’s their only release of their four year existence, too. Perhaps it’s time for a full-length?\n\n~\n\nI did, however, manage to grab a tape copy of both of these next two releases, the first of which is Nox Desperatio‘s austere debut album Anima Veritas Vita Morte. This duo summon raw, enflamed black metal done the old way, emanating esotericism and hatred from the shadows to drain you of all life. Some welcome depressive elements pop up here and there but overall this is nothing but old-school obscurity with no frills and no fucking about; just the way it should be. Name-your-price download and tapes are still available. Prepare thyself, for darkness and despair falleth over the Earth.\n\n~\n\nAnd finally, Moriturio‘s Luminatione Exaltat Serpens – nothing but pure black metal. The songwriting shines through on this one, dark tension and ancient glory oozing from the tremolo-heavy compositions while the vocalist shrieks like a creature of the night. As N says below, these few tracks comprise all of their recorded material and might very well be their swansong; which, if true, is a crying shame as the atmosphere and energy they summon is something special. Raise your claws to the moon, grab a free download and/or buy a tape of this now before they all sell out – then read on below for our chat with main man N.\n\n~\n\nGreetings N! It’s great to speak with you today. Some people may know you from Venezuelan/Chilean project Selbst, but you also run a label, Unpleasant Records! So, let’s start with the intent behind the label. If Unpleasant Records had a mission statement, what would it be?\n\nN: The one of giving to know dark and terrible gems. Unpleasant, for the majority. Of black metal and related music in general, that only those who are prepared to receive in their hearts would listen and comprehend properly…\n\nHails. Correct me if I’m wrong, but I believe the label has been active for about a year now; what made you finally decide to start it up?\n\nN: For a long time I wanted to start in this, nothing ambitious but dedicated! I wanted to give an opportunity to bands that were looking to start and acquire a physical release to begin showing their work and to give them some support.\n\nEspecially thinking about good bands from my country, Venezuela (which are really, really few).\n\nWell, I know one great band from Venezuela. As mentioned, you’re also a member of Selbst and I’m sure have many, many other things that also keep you busy. How do you find balance between your art, life and your label?\n\nN: Sometimes I can hardly find a balance, I am a natural procrastinator… but beyond this, I am someone very null, a normal work-home-etc guy. I’m not into partying a lot, I’m a bit bitter in that aspect. This year I had another issue that I also had secretly between my eyes and for a long time, and that is playing live with SELBST. About that, it has been a bit year moved.\n\nUnpleasant Records’ first three releases are: Fosa’s Demo MMXVI, Nox Desperatio’s Anima Veritas Vita Morte, and Luminatione Exaltat Serpens by Moriturio. Can you tell us a little of your personal feelings about each one?\n\nN: Let’s see…\n\nFOSA was a revelation for me. I loved their demo and their 100% nihilistic and anti-showbiz-egocentric attitude (a rare occurrence in the Chilean scene). They go against everything and everyone. It is a band with true attitude, created by true nihilists and fucked-up people. For me it was an honor to give them this little support. Besides, their songs were sung in SPANISH!!!\n\nNOX DESPERATIO is very important for me because they are from Venezuela. Anima Veritas Vita Morte is a work with composition quality, totally sung in Spanish as well, and done in a masterly way! This is always a difficult language to work with for metal music, especially in black metal, but it seems that it flows naturally. Also, the people involved in this project are super talented and dedicated to black metal. They have sacrificed a lot, and still do, even with all the crap situation that my country is currently experiencing. That is not a little amount.\n\nFinally, MORITURIO is one of my favourite and best-achieved black metal acts from my country. Unfortunately, they don’t have a wide or constant discography; this work feels like a goodbye (maybe?) for a great project that many people out there should know. Also sung in Spanish, although inspired in my opinion by the typical black metal like Sargeist, etc. it has an original and frightening touch. Catchy and deeply, extremely atmospheric riffs.\n\nI hope to get more works like those in the future!\n\nSo far, you have released all three of those albums on cassette. What is the appeal of this format to you? Is this your preferred listening format, and do you have any plans to branch out into vinyl or CD for future releases?\n\nN: I would LOVE to release vinyl formats in the future. But I’m working with cassette tapes now for several reasons. On one hand for a matter of costs, it’s much easier to start up. Also because it is a format I like; it is small, and it facilitates storage and shipping.\n\nI like to buy cassette releases from bands and labels. Like vinyl, it has that classic touch that the CD does not have, and much less a digital download…\n\nI agree, analog for life. Also of note: all three albums have been pressed in limitations of 50. Are you open to the idea of represses, or is it going to be a one-time-only sort of deal? What do you think about each option, which appeals to you more?\n\nN: Of course, I’m totally open to reissues, but as you can notice, I am a normal person who wanted to start a independent small label with short editions. It was like a experiment. Therefore, if everything goes well, I could make more copies if necessary. One learns on the fly…\n\nYou should reissue FOSA so I can order a tape, haha. Anyway I hope it goes well – the releases are amazing. Some labels end up with quite an eclectic roster releasing a variety of genres, will Unpleasant Records take this path? How do you decide which bands or artists to release on the label?\n\nN: I would like to, as long as it’s something unpleasant! Haha. The truth is I have little time and, mainly, I release projects of people more or less close to whom I want to support.\n\nEspecially, as mentioned before, bands from my country with a brutal sound, that touch my fibers, will have an advantage for me.\n\nIs it only yourself that runs the label at the moment? If so, would you ever take on any help?\n\nN: I took this decision on a personal basis, so I prefer to work and keep it like this. Even when some extra monetary help is always welcome, I prefer to take longer and do it on my own, to be able to work freely in any way I want, without waiting for second opinions from anyone!\n\nThe best way. Something that I guess many readers will want to know: Are you accepting demos?\n\nN: Yes, although I have already planned the next releases for 2019. But you know, even so, my humble door is open for any not-shitty proposal!\n\nBe prepared for an influx of shitty demos, haha. Now, I notice Unpleasant Records also acts as a distro. Are you open to trades with other labels?\n\nN: Trades are, definitely, an important part in the underground! It helps the band, it helps the label, and even helps with promotion I think. You will not always get something good, but it will help you to promote unknown bands and keep the interest of potential buyers alive in the material that you bring constantly to your distro. Apart from strengthening ties and making contacts or some shit like that.\n\nGiven that the label is fairly new, you might be in a good position to answer this, as I’m sure you’ve come across at least a few problems: Do you have any advice for those aspiring to start their own label?\n\nN: I can only say that if you want to make a living from this, you better get away. This is something that is done for the sake of Art. With passion and dedication. You can always recover, in some way, what you invest; but it is not likely to make you a millionaire haha.\n\nSimply do it! And convince yourself to not worry about money. If you find music created with the soul, with approach, then support it and work hard in the promotion of it and it will find, for sure, a place in this world’s shitty metal scene with a lot of fucking bands coming out every day. That’s very important!\n\nAnd finally – Everything you’ve released so far is superb. Can you drop us a hint of any future black gold you have lined up?\n\nN: I can tell you now that I am working on a tape reissue of the second album of the Chileans ANIMUS MORTIS, and the second full-length of NOX DESPERATIO!\n\nTwo impeccable works!!!\n\nNice. Okay, I lied about that being the last question. While I’ve got you here, I’m going to sneak in a quick one regarding Selbst, as I fucking love Selbst: You’ve just released Secular Compendium – a remastered compilation of your demo and splits, which is excellent but serves to whet the appetite for more. So… any news on a new release?\n\nN: For the moment I can only say I’m working on the next full album. But like the first one, I’ll take it easy, I want something worthy of showing!\n\nBut before that, next year will see to light the vinyl edition of my beloved “SELBST”! And more live performances as well…\n\nExcellent, I can’t fucking wait. Sincerest thanks for your time, N. Any final words?\n\nN: Many thanks to you for your interest in UNPLEASANT RECORDS and SELBST!\n\nAnd don’t forget folks, “Without drugs, life would be a mistake”… Or was it music?\n\n~\n\nSupport Unpleasant Records:\n\nOfficial Facebook\n\nOfficial Bandcamp\n\n~\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more kvlt sounds and tonal blasphemy.\n\nEmail: blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\nWrapping up the two part LISTCRUSH series of the releases that resonated and affected us the most throughout 2017, here’s the top 40 full-length albums. A little late, but last year was absolutely monolithic for Black Metal in general so what was originally going to be a top 20 stretched out to 40, and could have easily continued to 100. As in Part One, every single one of these albums and artists is highly recommended for your full attention. Enjoy.\n\n~\n\n~ TOP 40 ALBUMS OF 2017 ~\n\n40: KROLOK – ‘Flying Above Ancient Ruins’ (Hexencave Prod.)\n\nA Mortiis-style introduction echoes down cobwebbed halls before bursting into the moonlit sounds of the best era of Scandinavian hell. This Slovakian vampyric horde effortlessly nailed it.\n\n~\n\n39: HAUNTING DEPTHS – ‘Death’s Sacred Fire’ (Goatowarex)\n\nNo names, no country of origin, no information available for the project at all; just great fucking black metal.\n\n~\n\n38: BEZMIR – ‘Void’ (Werewolf Promotion)\n\nOne of Ukranian dark ambient maestro Severoth‘s many solo projects, now he channels the violence and terror of the cosmic void. Whenever I needed a quick fix of blistering, uncompromising savagery I always went straight to this beast.\n\n~\n\n37: EVILFEAST – ‘Elegies of the Stellar Wind’ (Eisenwald)\n\nThis Polish gem crept silently in right at the death of the year and enchanted me with its ethereal, cold grimness. Magic.\n\n~\n\n36: WHOREDOM RIFE – ‘Dommedagskvad’ (Terratur Possessions)\n\nNorwegian Black Metal is alive and well. The fucking riffs in this one should be illegal.\n\n~\n\n35: NIGHTBRINGER – ‘Terra Damnata’ (Season Of Mist)\n\nAnother go-to album if I needed a fix of viciousness. Majestic, sophisticated, devotional; and not the only entry on this list from these US mystics.\n\n~\n\n34: ALMYRKVI – ‘Umbra’ (Ván Records)\n\nMy favourite cosmic black/death album of the year, the debut album from these Icelandic wizards was everything I hoped for and more.\n\n~\n\n33: THROANE – ‘Plus Une Maine a Mordre’ (Debemur Morti)\n\nA deep, deep album. Nobody creates art like Dehn Sora. Avant-garde madness, a bleeding wound that will not heal.\n\n~\n\n32: ENTHEOGEN – ‘Without Veil, Nor Self’ (Fallen Empire Records, Mystískaos)\n\nAlex Poole‘s second entry into these lists. As I said in a previous article, this “will split your mind off into several simultaneous perceptual tangents allowing reality to become both an entirely new proposition and completely inconsequential all at once”. Mental.\n\n~\n\n31: HAVUKRUUNU – ‘Kelle Surut Soi’ (Naturmacht Productions)\n\nI was a big fan of the Finns previous effort ‘Havulinnaan’ so when I first heard ‘Kelle Surut Soi’ I was a little disappointed by the differences, as they’d seemingly toned down a large part of what I enjoyed about them. Then I actually opened my ears, and holy shit.\n\n~\n\n30: THE CLEARING PATH – ‘Watershed Between Firmament and the Realm of Hyperborea’ (I, Voidhanger Records)\n\nItalian prodigy Gabriele Gramaglia pushing everything into the stratosphere. Black Metal taken to almost incomprehensible new heights. Could have been higher up the list on a different day.\n\n~\n\n29: ISRATHOUM – ‘Channeling Death and Devil’ (Altare Productions)\n\nEasily should have landed on more lists. As I wrote once before: “Five years was worth the wait; they’ve created a perilous album with an undeniable power that will bend you to its will. A trek down black metal’s many dark and winding paths; a sinister, ritualistic experience infused with dangerous occultism and coiled savagery, eyeing you with disdain and contempt, knowing it could tear out your throat with a mere flick of its wrist.” Evil.\n\n~\n\n28: PERVERTED CEREMONY – ‘Sabbat of Behazaël’ (Nuclear War Now! Productions)\n\nSheer ritualistic abomination; frenzied, fetid and foul. I felt like I needed a shower after every listen. Beautiful.\n\n~\n\n27: URN – ‘The Burning’ (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nUtterly blasphemic blackthrash from the Finns. The energy and sheer traditional headbang-ability of this is off the chain.\n\n~\n\n26: INCONCESSUS LUX LUCIS – ‘The Crowning Quietus’ (I, Voidhanger Records, Invictus Productions)\n\nBlack Metal that shreds? Yes. This album fucking rips. Glorious satanic power and might.\n\n~\n\n25: BESTIA ARCANA – Holókauston (Dark Descent Records)\n\nThe Nightbringer gents pulled off a spectacular coup releasing this and ‘Terra Damnata’ in the same year. An apocalyptic conjuration to rival anything any of them have ever done, including Akhlys. This tore open the earth.\n\n~\n\n24: KRALLICE – ‘Go Be Forgotten’ (Hathenter Records)\n\nMy favourite thing they’ve done in a minute, by a long shot. The production, the art; the inhuman musical abilities. This is one that will never be forgotten.\n\n~\n\n23: FACELESS ENTITY – ‘In Via ad Nusquam’ (Nebular Carcinoma Records, Altare Productions, The Throat)\n\nForever mourning the dead and the living. Ominous, obscure atmosphere; I listened to a shitload of raw black this year and this was among the best.\n\n~\n\n22: FROZEN GRAVES – ‘Frozen Graves’ (Kuunpalvelus)\n\nFinland showing everyone how it’s done; pure black metal. Probably would have been higher on the list if it’d dropped earlier than November and I’d been able to spend more time with it.\n\n~\n\n21: SVARTSYN – ‘In Death’ (Agonia Records)\n\nSweden’s finest annihilate once again. Misanthropic fury that will slice you in half with no mercy.\n\n~\n\n20: VOID PRAYER – ‘Stillbirth from the Psychotic Void’ (The Throat, Goatowarex)\n\nThis raw, disassociative dysphoria still haunts my dreams.\n\n~\n\n19: MORK – ‘Eremittens Dal’ (Peaceville Records)\n\nWhen these men hit their stride nobody can beat them for capturing the essence of ’90s Norway. It isn’t mere imitation; it’s a channeling of powerful natural spirit continuing in the current age. The carriers of the torch for True Norwegian Black Metal.\n\n~\n\n18: VOËMMR – ‘Nox Maledictvs’ (Signal Rex)\n\nRecorded over two nights in an abandoned farmhouse, you can almost feel the spirits of the dead crackling in the air as these Portuguese enigmas coax otherworldly atmospheres from their instruments.\n\n~\n\n17: AU-DESSUS – ‘End of Chapter’ (Les Acteurs de l’Ombre Productions)\n\nThe only post black album to make my list this year, this is monumental. Listen to it. Now.\n\n~\n\n16: SELBST – ‘Selbst’ (Sun & Moon Records)\n\nThe Venezuelans killed it with top notch composition, thunderous sound and one overall devastating album. Very well done.\n\n~\n\n15: URARV – ‘Aurum’ (Svart Records)\n\nThe man with the best voice in Norwegian Black Metal returns with another outstanding project. Bjorn ‘Aldrahn’ Dencker brings the avant-garde weirdness once again, and it is excellent.\n\n~\n\n14: FLEURETY – ‘The White Death’ (Peaceville Records)\n\nObliterating the notion of genre constraints since the early ’90s, Norwegians Fleurety are back with a stunningly bizzare rabbit hole from which there is zero chance of escape and even less of understanding. “We were always being normal”…\n\n~\n\n13: DSKNT – ‘PhSPHR Entropy’ (Sentient Ruin Laboratories)\n\nA churning maelstrom tearing apart the very physics of reality at a molecular level. I’d been following this release from Swiss enigma ASKNT with extreme interest, then when Sentient Ruin Laboratories picked it up for release I couldn’t have been happier. Terrifying. You need this in your life.\n\n~\n\n12: MRTVI – ‘Negative Atonal Dissonance’ (Transcending Obscurity Records)\n\nHow many artists are truly experimenting with black metal, or music in general? For Damjan from mental Serbian/UK project MRTVI it’s gone past the ‘experimental’ stage, he’s now inventing. Full of improvisation and all sorts of sonic abandon, my 2017 list is stacked with avant-garde alchemy but this may just be the most batshit. Anxiety inducing.\n\n~\n\n11: TCHORNOBOG – ‘Tchornobog’ (I, Voidhanger Records, Fallen Empire Records)\n\nI watched the hype slowly creep and then explode on this when it was released, and it was completely deserved. Monstrous, disturbing songs that warp your psyche; this isn’t an album you can dip in and out of. Dive in to the horror.\n\n~\n\n10: NORSE – ‘The Divine Light of a New Sun’ (Transcending Obscurity Records)\n\n“A warped, angular beast that lumbers towards you, continuously shape-shifting as body parts and facial features drop off and regrow in a horrifying, gibbering terror. Utterly inhuman.” Many, many more people should have paid attention to this dissonant Australian behemoth of an album. Superb.\n\n~\n\n9: AOSOTH – ‘V: The Inside Scriptures’ (Agonia Records)\n\nBacked up their last in spectacular fashion. I listened to this many, many times; and I still haven’t even received my vinyl yet.\n\n~\n\n8: TETRAGRAMMACIDE – ‘Primal Incinerators of Moral Matrix’ (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nUltimate punishment. These Indian commandos took the gloves clean off with this release and created an all out assault of sonic war crimes, each frenzied blow landing with lazer precision. The most brutal album on this list, and arguably of the year.\n\n~\n\n7: BLUT AUS NORD – ‘Deus Salutis Meae’ (Debemur Morti Productions)\n\nNobody does it like these gentlemen. It may not have been the giant leap forward many were expecting, but they didn’t need to. Still the best in the game.\n\n~\n\n6: ACRIMONIOUS – ‘Eleven Dragons’ (World Terror Committee)\n\nSemjaza is a man who knows his stuff, and this album ticked every single box for me. Perfect black art deserving of the highest praise. Glory to the one who is Eleven.\n\n~\n\n5: CHAOS MOON – ‘Eschaton Mémoire’ (Blood Music)\n\nAlex Poole does it again. This time allowing a more collaborative effort for his main project, the inclusion of Eric Baker on vocals this time around is absolutely inspired. Top shelf USBM, absolutely essential.\n\n~\n\n4: SEVEROTH – ‘Forestpaths’ (Werewolf Promotion)\n\nI listened to this album more times than any other over the course of the year. Ukranian demon Severoth‘s second entry into this list is a spellbinding journey through an immersive, frozen world. Something about this release hits me just right. A masterpiece.\n\n~\n\n3: american – ‘Violate and Control’ (Sentient Ruin Laboratories)\n\nFucking savagery. The US black industrial noise terrorist duo crafted something special here; something hideous and usually hidden but now dragged screaming into the light. The only album I purchased on multiple formats, and it’s pleased me to no end that I’ve seen it pop up on a few other year-end lists. Hanging to see what they do next.\n\n~\n\n2: BLACK CILICE – ‘Banished From Time’ (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nReleased in early March and never bettered. The raw black metal album of the year. Incredibly affecting, I was lost in its hypnotic swathes of cavernous howls for what felt like an eternity. Atmosphere like no other.\n\n~\n\n1: YELLOW EYES – ‘Immersion Trench Reverie’ (Gilead Media)\n\nThis album crept up on me. I had no idea it would be my album of the year until I was compiling this list, when I realised there could be only one release that could, and should, be at the top. At first listen you think it’s cool and the US crew had made some nice improvements building on ‘Sick With Bloom’; but once it starts to get under your skin and the nuances begin to reveal themselves there’s nothing quite like it. The field recordings from Tibet are only the icing on a rich, fascinatingly calm and natural yet grim and unsettling cake. Oustanding. Unique. In a banner year for Black Metal, this was the best.\n\n~\n\nNear Misses: Synodic – ‘Infinite Presence In A Violent Universe’, Desolate Shrine – ‘Deliverance from the Godless Void’, Bašmu – ‘VVitchblood’, Orm – ‘Orm’, Theurgia – ‘Transformation’, Fell Ruin ‘To The Concrete Drifts’, Fin – ‘Arrows of a Dying Age’, Enisum – ‘Seasons of Desolation’, Lóstregos – ‘Lendas Baixo o Luar’, Vassafor – ‘Malediction’, Windswept – ‘The Great Cold Steppe’, Dodecahedron – ‘Kwintessens’, Sarkrista – ‘Summoners of the Serpents Wrath’, Woe – ‘Hope Attrition’, Doedsvangr – ‘Satan Ov Suns’, Weregoat – ‘Pestilential Rites of Infernal Fornication’, Acedia Mundi – ‘Speculum Humanae Salvationis’, Malokarpatan – ‘Nordkarpatenland’, Wiegedood – ‘De Doden Hebben Het Goed II’, Falls of Rauros – ‘Vigilance Perennial’, Ofermod – ‘Sol Nox’.\n\n~\n\n…And that caps off the 2017 edition of LISTCRUSH. My utmost respect and admiration to all the artists that toiled in the darkness and blessed us with their blackened works last year. Think I missed anything? You’re probably right, send me your favourite shit. I’ll be chewing on a stack of remaining 2017 releases for the next few months anyway.\n\nHails 2017; bring on 2018.\n\n-A\n\n~\n\nGet in early for next year: Email blackmetaldaily@outlook.com\n\nSubmissions welcomed.\n\nLike Black Metal Daily on Facebook for more kvlt sounds and tonal blasphemy."
