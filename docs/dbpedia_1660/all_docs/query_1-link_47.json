        "text": "Finnish black metal band\n\nHorna is a Finnish black metal band formed in 1994. The band has appeared on over thirty releases including splits, demos, EPs and albums since 1995, which have been released through numerous record labels. The name \"Horna\" is Finnish for \"abyss\" or \"hell\".[2] It was chosen because, to Shatraug, it sounded harsh and powerful.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nHorna was formed in 1994 by vocalist and guitarist Shatraug and guitarist Moredhel.[3] Horna did not start recording until early 1995. The first demo, Varjoissa, was released in September that year and sold out. In 1996, Nazgul von Armageddon took over vocal duties and the band recorded their first full-length album Hiidentorni in January 1997, resulting in a deal with the Greek label Solistitium Records. The band continued to release albums under this label through June 1998, when Moredhel and bassist Skratt left the band. Bassist Thanatos replaced Skratt soon afterwards, and Moredhel re-joined that August. In 1999, the band signed to Norwegian label Oskorei Productions for a vinyl-only release of the band's third album, Haudankylmyyden Mailla, and the band released a series of limited vinyl-only EPs and split albums through most of the early 2000s, with full-length studio albums coming out in the latter half of the decade.[1] In 2002, Nazgul von Armageddon left the band, leaving vocal duties to Corvus.[3] In July 2003, it was announced that guitarist Aarni T. Otava had left the group. Horna cited the loss of \"dedication\" as the reason behind his departure, and revealed that Horna's performance at 2003's Tuska Open Air Metal Festival would be their last with Otava handling guitar duties. In 2008 Horna embarked on an American tour. They played their first American show on Halloween 2008 at \"The Black Castle\" courtesy of underground promoter Chris \"Hate War\" Wood.[4]\n\nIdeology\n\n[edit]\n\nHorna has been criticized for NSBM ties.[5] Former lead vocalist Nazgul von Armageddon was alleged to have expressed Nazi views in his solo project Satanic Warmaster. In 2005, founder Shatraug accused Nazgul of being \"the Nazi in our ranks\" and the band's website in 2007 declared that \"[w]hat any ex-members might represent is not what we stand for.\"[6][7] Shatraug said that Horna was \"nationalist to a certain point\", but not National Socialist.[6]\n\nIn 2010, Horna concerts in Germany and Austria were cancelled because of allegations that the band was involved with NSBM. The band responded, \"fuck off to Antifa and their fascist intolerant propaganda... We are satanist, religious, devil-worshipping, alcohol-consuming occult bastards and our band has NOTHING to do with NS.\"[8][9]\n\nOn their 2019 American tour, Horna shows in New York City, Denver, Portland and Oakland were canceled after MetalSucks posted an article highlighting the band's connection to NSBM artists.[10] During that tour in Houston, members of the far-right extremist group Atomwaffen Division were seen doing Nazi salutes in the crowd during Horna's performance.[11] In response, Horna said: \"We judge every man and woman only by their demeanor, not by their race or sexual preferences. We have zero interest in politics, left or right.\"[10]\n\nMembers\n\n[edit]\n\nCurrent members\n\n[edit]\n\nShatraug (Ville Pystynen) – guitar (1994–present), vocals (1994–1996), backing vocals (1996–present)\n\nInfection (Mynni Luukkainen) – bass guitar (2002–2008), guitar, backing vocals (2008–present)\n\nSpellgoth (Tuomas \"SG.7\" Rytkönen) – lead vocals (2009–present)\n\nLRH (Lauri \"Kassara\" Rytkönen) – drums (2016–present)\n\nVnoM (Ville Markkanen) – bass guitar (2018–present)\n\nFormer members\n\n[edit]\n\nMoredhel (Jyri Vahvanen) – guitars (1994–1998), bass (1999–2000)\n\nGorthaur (Jarkko Heilimo) – drums (1994–2003, 2005)\n\nNazgul von Armageddon (Lauri \"Werwolf\" Penttilä) – lead vocals (1996–2001), keyboards (1999)\n\nSkratt (Pasi Teitto) – bass (1997–1998), keyboards (1997–1998)\n\nA.T.
