        "text": "A lot of focus rightfully lands on the scores and scores of black metal bands around the world, but what about the organizations and teams that support their supremacy? No matter how large or small an act is, they all rely on the logistical and financial backing of their record label. As such, we’re looking at a few labels that have proven to be especially important advocates for worthy artists.\n\nWhile they didn’t exactly make our list, we think you should also pay attention to bands on the following labels: Dark Essence Records, Karisma’s sub-label; Osmose Productions; and Avantgarde Music. We must acknowledge that Season of Mist still works with greats like Tsjuder and Nargaroth.\n\nThe defunct British enterprise Misanthropy Records was one of the fiercest early champions of classic groups, such as Ved Buens Ende and Mayhem. Similarly, Metalion’s Head Not Found, a sub-label of Voices Music & Entertainment, was an honorable venture while it lasted. As the most important extreme metal fanzine writer of all time, Metalion clearly had a rare eye for talent. We likewise salute Shiiver from Arcane Archivist Zine for recently starting the label and publishing company Inscripted Mist Creations.\n\nDespite this article’s focus on black metal, our semi-diverse picks have also partnered with notable clients who represent other genres. Fortunately, the labels on our list are all motivated by the earnest desire to propagate the dark and malignant arts, as opposed to leeching off their bands.\n\nThe Sinister Initiative\n\nFounded in 2017, The Sinister Initiative carries with it a superior roster of great bands. TSI currently boasts the genius of Cold Prophet, Høstsol, and Shining. Whereas Cold Prophet’s eponymous debut first gripped us with its gorgeous black ambient wrath in 2022, the other two bands unleashed a couple of the best albums of 2023. In fact, Shining’s self-titled eleventh full-length masterpiece and Høstsol’s Länge Leve Döden rank among the greatest BM records of all time, in my unerring view. This is, of course, because the legendary Niklas Kvarforth is behind both triumphs. We must note that King Diamond’s Andy La Rocque lent his expertise to all three efforts.\n\nTSI is currently operated by “The Sinister Three” — the femme fatale Missy Hedning, Kvarforth, and Tuomas Tahvanainen of Shining and Cold Prophet. The brilliant Missy serves as an empowering example to women everywhere; she was partially responsible for this year’s expanded reissue of Lots of Girls Gonna Get Hurt (2012), my favorite EP. Tuomas doubles as a revered graphic designer, and has thus created magnificent covers for some of TSI’s releases. Like his fellow-superhuman teammates, Kvarforth brings decades of experience; he started his first label, Selbstmord Services, as a teenager in the ’90s. The Sinister Three may charm us with their wicked sense of humor and marketing excellence, but this dangerously cool trio is truly committed to making the world an even worse place.\n\nIn the past, TSI has conspired with Srd and Deinonychus. TSI has furthermore enriched us with material by Bethlehem, Benighted, and Livsnekad that features jaw-dropping vocal contributions by Kvarforth. In the future, we hope to hear an offering that TSI has teased by a project called Seger. This album should showcase the unsurpassed artistry of, again, Mr. Kvarforth, Shining and Mayhem’s Charles Hedger, ex-Enochian Crescent’s Mathias Palmroth, and Behemoth’s Zbigniew Prominski.\n\nTerratur Possessions\n\nDiscovering the Trondheim-based Terratur Possessions and its artists will surely open new doors for you as a listener. One thing that sets this label apart from all but the elite few is that nearly all of their bands are exceptional — you don’t have to worry about counterfeits mixed in with the diamonds. A large percentage of the greatest new titles come from Terratur’s clients: Manii, Knokkelklang, Whoredom Rife, Syning, Askeregn, Darvaza, Enevelde, Sarath, Dark Sonority, Mare, Misotheist, and many others. This year, the label introduced us to the miraculous emerging acts Syn, Parfaxitas, and Kråbøl. Terratur has furthermore released and/or reissued content by Celestial Bloodshed; Kaosritual; One Tail, One Head; Selvhat; Skuggeheim; Castrum Doloris; Dødsengel; Vemod; Min Kniv; etc.\n\nTerratur is closely linked to the celebrated movement known as Nidrosian Black Metal. Therefore, Terratur has played a major role in the history of the genre. Terratur Possessions was formed in 2007 by Ole A. Aune, who co-organizes Beyond the Gates and is always pulling together other exciting events. Aune teams up with great visual artists, top engineers like Kark, and so forth to ensure optimal results for his musicians and customers. Terratur’s offerings are actually distributed by our next selection.\n\nVán Records\n\nFounded in 2004, Germany’s Ván Records has been spreading misanthropy since 2004. Ván is the brainchild of ex-Nagelfar and ex-Graupel’s Sven Dinninghoff. Sven told Bardo Methodology: “Ván is a label for genuine, dark, and valuable music; timeless and not driven by fashion, hype, or trends. This ‘Acherontic Audio Art’ moniker we use is appropriate in a more metaphorical manner of speaking.” Ván’s lineup stars the brutal yet easy-to-swallow Cum Chalice, Duivel, Kwade Droes, Endstille, etc. In the past, Ván has partnered with the likes of the mighty Urfaust, Dødsengel, and Fluisterwoud.\n\nAftermath Music\n\nThe Aftermath Music record shop opened its doors in 1995, and the label was established in 1998. Aftermath may be a small label, but their selectivity is part of what distinguishes them. Aftermath has released material by bands like Manes, Tulus, Koldbrann, NettleCarrier, and Ljå. Djevel is one of the gems of Aftermath’s roster. While accepting Djevel’s Spellemann / “Norwegian Grammy,” the group’s superstar drummer, ex-Emperor’s Faust, thanked Aftermath and its founder, Haavard Holm. Djevel’s mastermind, Trånn Ciekals, is currently nominated for one of Norway’s most prestigious awards, Edvard-prisen, for composing the outfit’s latest offering, Naa skrider natten sort (2022). At the moment, Djevel is working on their next album, which is bound to bring even more glory to Aftermath.\n\nDebemur Morti Productions\n\nDebemur Morti Productions emerged in Paris in 2003. Their past and present clients include Manes, Behexen, Archgoat, Dødsengel, Urfaust, Celestial Bloodshed, Arckanum, Wallachia, Doedsvangr, and Manii. The label has joined forces with a ton of surprisingly individualistic outfits. Debemur Morti’s owner, former musician Phil, told maPlatine that it is imperative that “the Art of the groups affiliated to DMP (Debemur Morti Productions) is authentic, deep, and pure — in summary, ‘true’ Art (true, in the sense of ‘non-artificial’). However, it also has to carry a spiritual dimension. The goal is to offer a piece that can transcend the listener.” In conversation with Bardo Methodology, Phil stressed that he treats his “bands the way I’d like to be treated if I still had one.” He emphasizes that he places the utmost value on seriousness and professionalism.\n\nPeaceville Records\n\nThe famous Peaceville Records is known for giving creative freedom to their artists, a feature common to our other picks. Peaceville was established in 1987 by the fabled Paul “Hammy” Halmshaw. Although Hammy’s initial reaction to Darkthrone’s conversion to black metal on A Blaze in the Northern Sky (1992) was resistance and extreme displeasure, he would prove a crucial ally to the genre. The English label is now run by Paul Groundwell. Peaceville’s BM clients include Thorns, Mork, Fleurety, RUÏM, Mysticum, Kvist, Mortem, Dødheimsgard, Doedsmaghird, Valkyrja, etc. Granted, Peaceville’s artists are fairly diverse in terms of their stylistic modes of expression. Peaceville formerly collaborated with the death-doom and gothic metal pioneers Paradise Lost and My Dying Bride. The label is furthermore respected for its decades-long relationship with the death metal giants Autopsy.\n\nWe were especially impressed by a pair of phenomenal Mayhem box sets that Peaceville unveiled in 2018 and 2022 by Finn Håkon Rødland. Hopefully, Rødland’s box for Thorns’ Grymyrk will become available next year. It is also important to mention here that the most excellent Secret Service Publicity handles PR for Peaceville, as well as the next label on our list, which is great for bands and also for me since I only want to deal with the best — Austin Griswold.\n\nProphecy Productions\n\nFounded in 1996 by Germany’s Martin Koller, the international Prophecy Productions and Lupus Lounge, one of the former’s sub-labels, presently boast Kall, Vemod, Arcturus, Bethlehem, Xasthur, and Dold Vorde Ens Navn. In what was arguably the most exciting signing of the year, Prophecy recently acquired the Fosen-based group of BM hooligans dubbed Slagmaur — close accomplices of Thorns. In the past, the mind-blowingly awesome yet sadly defunct Silencer worked with Prophecy and Lupus. Like Silencer, the tragically disbanded Lifelover was not only one of Prophecy’s greatest clients, but they are remembered as one of the best black metal outfits of all time. Lifelover notably played a 2015 reunion show at the annual Prophecy Fest. This year’s edition was apparently a huge hit.\n\nSoulseller Records\n\nThe esteemed and trustworthy Dutch label Soulseller was launched in 1999 by Jorn Rap. At present, Soulseller works with bands, such as Svarttjern, Sarke, Khold, Tulus, Vesen, Nattverd, In the Woods…, and Gorgoroth. They have also helped spread content by other important names: the pioneering yet deceased act Old Funeral, Ved Buens Ende, Dold Vorde Ens Navn, Mayhem, Setherial, Ophthalamia, Enslaved, Helheim, Malignant Eternal, Deathcult, Aeternus, Den Saakaldte, and so forth.\n\nRegain Records"
