        "text": "Band: Ulcerate | Album: Cutting the Throat of God | Genre: Death metal, Progressive metal | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Auckland, New Zealand | Label: Debemur Morti\n\nFor fans of: Gorguts, Artificial Brain, Blood Incantation\n\nBandcamp\n\nBarely a month ago, I commented on how infrequently New Zealand shows up on this site. (Indeed, that was the first time I had featured any Kiwis here in three-and-a-half years.) And now here I am, covering (what is most likely) that country’s most respected metal band!\n\nI covered Ulcerate’s last album, 2020’s Stare into Death and Be Still, and I liked it. I didn’t revere it quite as much as many others, but it’s a solid album overall. My thoughts on it haven’t moved much since my original review. This trio’s new release though, Cutting the Throat of God, takes the thundering, intelligent death metal of their last album and further refines it into something spectacular.\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Ulcerate – Cutting the Throat of God” →\n\nBand: Hail Spirit Noir | Album: Fossil Gardens | Genre: Psychedelic black metal | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Thessaloniki, Greece | Label: Agonia Records\n\nFor fans of: Sigh, Riverside, Thy Catafalque\n\nBandcamp\n\nHail Spirit Noir is a Greek experimental metal act hailing from the Macedonian city of Thessaloniki. I have briefly touched on Greece’s relative influence within the metal scene before, and I have covered Hail Spirit Noir once before, as well. HSN is one of my favorite contemporary metal bands, and they are responsible for two of my favorite albums of the 2010s: their 2012 debut, Pneuma, and their 2016 third album, Mayhem in Blue. 2020’s Eden in Reverse was a solid release, too, though their last album–2021’s Mannequins–was a weird, one-off synthwave project. And I’m really not a fan of synthwave.\n\nFossil Gardens, the band’s sixth full-length release, sees HSN get back to their core sound. I once saw someone describe their music as “blackened psychedelic folk,” and while I don’t necessarily agree with that description, they were admittedly onto something. This band’s sound is undoubtedly and undeniably metallic, but influences from psychedelic rock pervade their music more than any metal band this side of Sigh.\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Hail Spirit Noir – Fossil Gardens” →\n\nBand: Ulls | Album: Cripta nau | Genre: Progressive rock | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Barcelona, Spain | Label: Independent\n\nFor fans of: Pink Floyd, Banco del Mutuo Soccorso, The Mars Volta\n\nBandcamp\n\nOne of my primary motivations for starting this site was highlighting small-time bands that are easy to overlook. One such act is Ulls. Ulls (Catalan for “eyes”) is a one-man project based out of Barcelona that plays a somewhat heavy, eerie, organ-fueled variety of prog. The music often leans heavily on atmosphere, evoking certain acts who have scored films, like Goblin or early Pink Floyd.\n\nTheir 2019 LP, Anoia s’apodera (“Boredom sets in”) was one of my favorites of that year. However, it was released in December 2019, and I didn’t discover it until a few months into 2020. Thus, all it got on this site was a brief Odds & Ends entry. That is a big reason why my year-end best-of lists now cover December-to-November. When I got the alert from the Bandcamp app that Ulls was releasing a new record, titled Cripta nau (“Ship crypt”), I was quick to pre-order it.\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Ulls – Cripta nau” →\n\nBand: Half Empty Glasshouse | Album: The Exit Is Over There! | Genre: Avant-prog | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Auckland, New Zealand | Label: Uncharted Sounds\n\nFor fans of: black midi, Arcturus, 5uu’s\n\nBandcamp\n\nI swear I cover more than just avant-prog. Please ignore the fact that this is the fourth consecutive full-length review I’ve posted of an avant-prog act. 2024 is shaping up to be kind of a slow year in most of the other pico-genres I cover, but the crazy stuff is having a decent one. But you know what I don’t cover that often? New Zealanders!\n\nHalf Empty Glasshouse is a New Zealandic avant-prog and experimental metal band that takes the classical influences of bands like Eunuchs and integrates it even more. The Exit Is Over There! is their second full-length release, and it’s a concept album about public backlash to experimental music throughout history. The twisted, disgusted and disgusting faces on the album’s cover are a perfect complement to this theme.\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Half Empty Glasshouse – The Exit Is Over There!” →\n\nBand: Eunuchs | Album: Harbour Century | Genre: Avant-prog | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Sydney, Australia | Label: Independent\n\nFor fans of: black midi, Squid, Frank Zappa\n\nBandcamp\n\nEunuchs are an Australian quartet who employ a whole host of assisting musicians to construct dense, symphonic soundscapes. At the heart of things, they are a rock band, but traditional rock instrumentation is often minimized or buried beneath dense layers of strings, woodwinds, and reeds. Bubbling up amidst all that is a chaotic, angry energy that provides for unique contrasting effects.\n\nIn many ways, these Aussies remind me of black midi, the foremost band in the current avant-prog scene (insofar as there even is such a scene). These guys lean even harder into non-traditional instrumentation, though. Large swathes of this album push the very definition of “rock.”\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Eunuchs – Harbour Century” →\n\nBand: Present | Album: This Is NOT the End | Genre: Avant-prog, RIO | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Brussels, Belgium | Label: Cuneiform Records\n\nFor fans of: Univers Zero, 5uu’s, Magma\n\nBandcamp\n\nRock in Opposition (usually shortened to RIO) is a movement I’ve referred to a few times, but I’ve never really delved into it too deeply. Narrowly speaking, it refers to a specific group of five (initially, later expanded to eight) experimental rock bands who toured and played together in 1978 and 1979. These oddball bands (including Univers Zero, Henry Cow, and Samla Mammas Manna) were opposed to the music industry’s “refusal” to promote them. This stance, to me, comes off as a bit petty and self-centered. These bands played weird, aggressively un-commercial music. At a certain point, one needs to be realistic about their target audience. A major label isn’t going to promote an album like Hérésie. More broadly speaking, though, RIO now refers to the bands which are stylistically descended from these initial bands. I’ve used that label to refer to acts like PoiL, Cratophane, and Ahleuchatistas.\n\nThough not a member of the eight “official” RIO bands, Present appeared not long after. It was founded in 1979 by Roger Trigaux, a founding member of Univers Zero, which is a band I respect more than I enjoy (and that sentiment can largely be applied to the original RIO movement as a whole). They’re often minimal and moody and influenced by chamber music. I can appreciate it on a certain artistic level, but I don’t really like it that much.\n\nThis Is NOT the End was my first exposure to Present, and I like it a lot. It has a lot less of the chamber music-influenced stuff I associate with Univers Zero, but it has plenty of exciting, experimental, and overall-weird passages. This release is the band’s first since 2009, but it is, despite its title, the band’s final release. Trigaux, the band’s driving force, passed away in March of 2021, in the midst of recording.\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Present – This Is NOT the End” →\n\nBand: Dvne | Album: Voidkind | Genre: Progressive metal | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Edinburgh, UK | Label: Metal Blade\n\nFor fans of: The Ocean, metallic Porcupine Tree, Inter Arma\n\nBandcamp\n\nDvne (presumably pronounced like “dune,” though Google Translate also tells me it’s Bosnian for “days ago”) is a Scottish quintet, and they’re one of the more talked-about bands on the parts of the Internet where I spend my time. Voidkind is their third full-length album, coming three years after their last release. Dvne is a band I’ve listened to and contemplated covering before, but for whatever reason Etemen Ænka, their 2021 album, just didn’t quite catch my fancy. (2021 was also an exceptionally good year for the type of music I like, so they had some stiff competition for my attention. 2024, in contrast, is shaping up to be a slower year for me.)\n\nDisregarding my above disparaging of the current year, Voidkind is a legitimately good album. Dvne’s sludge metal roots have gone in a more atmospheric, post-metal-type direction. Normally, I’d be a bit wary about that–unless it’s preceding the word “punk,” the prefix “post-” is often an indicator there’s a higher risk I’ll be a bit bored–but the songwriting is smart, and the playing is crushing and dynamic.\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Dvne – Voidkind” →\n\nArtist: Stuart Wicke | Album: Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám | Genre: Progressive rock | Year: 2024\n\nFrom: Louisville, USA | Label: Independent\n\nFor fans of: Blue Öyster Cult, Pink Floyd, The Decemberists’ proggier stuff\n\nBandcamp\n\nPoetry isn’t really my thing, and that is borne out in my usual disinterest in lyrics. Obviously, though, poetry and lyrics speak strongly to some folks, and one of those folks is Kentuckian singer-songwriter Stuart Wicke. Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám is Wicke’s eighth full-length release, coming just four months after his last effort. Consisting of just two long songs, each of them draws their lyrics from poetry.\n\nOpening the album is “Song on the End of the World”, a three-part, 15-minute epic. Part two draws its inspiration from the poem of the same by Czesław Miłosz, and parts one and three are based on “America: A Prophecy” by poet William Blake.\n\nContinue reading “Album Review: Stuart Wicke – Rubáiyát of Omar Khayyám” →"
