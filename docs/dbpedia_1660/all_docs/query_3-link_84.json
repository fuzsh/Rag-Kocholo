        "text": "In the Woods… is a Norwegian avant-garde metal band from Kristiansand, formed in 1992. The band released a total of four studio albums, three singles, one compilation album and one live album throughout its initial existence. The band disbanded in 2000 and reformed in 2014.\n\nThe band started out as a death metal band called Green Carnation. With some members leaving, including Terje Vik Schei (a.k.a. Tchort), the remaining members formed In the Woods… The band released a demo in 1993 called The Isle of Men, as well as a full-length album named Heart of the Ages in 1995. This album was unique at the time since the band expanded the limits of their black metal style into the soothing sound of keyboards and female vocals combined with eerie distorted vocals and clean singing as well. The following, Omnio, is often regarded as their best album, featuring even more experimental music, 11 minute songs with more female vocals and reflective lyrics, together with magical instrumental overtures. The third album, Strange in Stereo, brought an enigmatic change in style, since the music got far more depressive and changing.\n\nIn 2000, In the Woods… released the album Three Times Seven on a Pilgrimage, a compilation of three of their previous 7″featuring covers from Pink Floyd, Jefferson Airplane and King Crimson, together with some newly released and rebuilt songs, like the new version of Child of Universal Tongue.\n\nAfter releasing Three Times Seven on a Pilgrimage, the band held a farewell performance in their home town of Kristiansand which featured all musicians, including the former members. The performance was recorded and released as Live at the Caledonien Hall in 2003. It was confirmed that this was the band’s last official release. Some of the members went on to play in the similarly-styled band Green Carnation, others took up personal projects and founded the independent label Karmakosmetix Records, created to support new experimental bands such as In the Woods…\n\nAnders Kobro announced the reformation of the band’s core lineup (Kobro, X. Botteri and C:M. Botteri) in 2014. 2015 was the year the newest lineup was announced, featuring Kobro, X. Botteri and C:M Botteri, James Fogarty and a younger guitar player named Corey (Kåre Andre Sletteberg). Together, they released their newest album Pure in September 2016 under their new label, Debemur Morti Productions. Keyboard player Job Phenex Bos is joining them during live sessions."
