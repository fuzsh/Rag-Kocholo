        "text": "Goddamn, is it me, or did September last like, 10 minutes? Anyway, what’s up, Scvmbags! It’s a time of rejoicing and celebration. We’ve finally made it to Fall Equinox and it’s finally time for the yellow orb in the sky to take a backseat, as we enter “spooky season”. The time for bleakness, colder weather and leather jackets! It’s been a brutal summer over here in New York and I’m pumped to finally move on. But, before we do, as the third quarter of 2022 comes to a close, it’s time to bust out the ol’ shovel and dig up what has yet to be highlighted from this brutal season of Sky Satan.\n\nAmidst a discography review and taking a bit of a break from writing over the last couple months, I only got to write a couple of full reviews, so there’s a lot of meat on the bone this time around, and boy, is some of it juicy! Also, let me note that, just because some of these are in the “Other Mentions” section, doesn’t mean that they’re not good as well, there was just an abundance of new stuff that I was able to get around to and far too much for everything to get a paragraph. So, check those out too, as they’re also more than worthy of your time! Anyway, let’s pick the bones and see what Summer 2022 has bestowed upon us.\n\nWhat Remains for Q3 2022:\n\nShitangel: Shithead Metal (Drakkar Productions)\n\nFIRST and foremost…\n\nIn an era of insincere, gimmicky samey-sameness, spreading across every sub-genre of Extreme Metal like a plague, there’s always a razor-sharp needle in the haystack, that bursts onto the scene not fucking around, ready to wreak hostile, Christ-pissing debauchery at every turn, that will make your local youth pastor soil himself like an untrained dog with IBS. Those bands that come along are few and far-between, but Burlington, Vermont’s Shitangel have come rolling into your small, God-fearing town and are guaranteed to leave it in a heap of blood, piss and vomit, with a sonic assault of Blackened Death Thrash, fusing every aspect into a raw, feverish cavern of hellish atmosphere, where everything is crisp and executed with the upmost cohesion. A rollercoaster ride of monstrous riffs, belted out from every angle, with smooth transitions between every section. From the blasting ferocity of Golden Shower Baptism, to the abrasive, snarling groove of the title track, to the explosive breakdown of Overflow of Christian Vomit, to the Archgoat-esque hammer blasts of Sadomasichrist, this thing is a pummeling from start to finish, and nothing is lost in the mix. Punchy, offensive and all out of fucks to give for you as a listener. No candelabras, no stupid frames on the cover, just riffs and violence! Buy this and play it for a Jehovah’s Witness next time they come knocking on your door.\n\nTrhä: Vat Gëlénva!!! (Independent)\n\nI’ve just recently became familiar with Trhä, and hearing his sound for the first time, was like taking a hit of acid, or something else of that form, in an abandoned amusement park, that makes you cognizant of every soul who died on every ride, as their mangled corpses appear before you and try to lure you onto said rides with them, as a sign of your own impending death. This is Black Metal with an air of suffocating panic, and a soul of nightmarish beauty. A lurid fever dream of wistful keyboards, ringing out like a haunted carousel, to a chorus of shrieks from disfigured ghosts, dragging you into the maw of death, to ride said carousel with them for eternity. Razor-like guitars and throaty shrieks balance out the beauty and serve as a guide through this maze of glaring heat, leading you to the cold chill of exhaustion, as you reach the light at the end of this ghastly tunnel. Ambient Black Metal with a blood-red charm. Harrowing and immersive.\n\nHexis: Aeternum (Debemur Morti Productions)\n\nThe third full-length by Denmark’s Hexis, which they continue to grow into the nihilistic beast that crawled from the atmospheric abyss that was Abalam, and conjured the spirits of the dead to feed itself with Tando Ashanti. Aeternum is a crushingly ominous chamber of sonic venom, that sinks into your soul like the fangs of a horned viper, as turbulent drums rumble beneath hefty, down-toned guitars, which become one and form into a neurotic cycle of disarray, that spirals out with apocalyptic splendor. While not as atmospheric as their earlier material, Hexis continues to channel Black Metal’s more unorthodox fringes, like 777 – Sect(s) era Blut Aus Nord or some of the early works of The Ruins of Beverast, and implements them into their own dissonant brand of Post-Black Metal, birthing an entirely new and unique sound, with its own essence and meaning. Quite possibly their best work yet, from the side of Post-Black Metal that I personally find more favorable, that drinks from the poisonous chalice of Black Metal’s occultic roots, and revels in chaos and dissension, alongside Plebeian Grandstand and Altar of Plagues. Not your millennial grandson’s cornball Blackgaze nonsense; this is the work of the subdivision of that scene’s outliers, who prefer to dwell in the shadows.\n\nPatria: Hexerei (Ketzer Records)\n\nI’m fairly new to Patria, but once I came across this album and the energy it carries, I was hooked. Hateful, intense Black Metal, with the intensity and skill of a master swordsman with a flaming blade. Razor-like riffs, crushing drums and some of the most well-placed keyboards I’ve heard in a long fucking time. A stellar amalgamation of all those elements, with just the right amount of production behind it, striking the perfect middle-ground between rawness and luster. Feverishly intense, emotive and relentless, like a firey arrow straight through the heart. Pretty overlooked for the most part, but definitely worth giving a shot if you haven’t already!\n\nAutonoesis: Moon of Foul Magics (Independent)\n\nA masterclass in Progressive Death Metal, from the deepest and most mysterious corners of the cosmos. This album dropped from the sky like a spacecraft crashing into deep woods, and we were the locals who discovered it and watched as the ship opened and were mesmerized by what it contained. A blend of melodic Death, Black and Thrash, coiled up into a a trepidatious journey through the desolate caverns of the vast horizons beyond our own. A winding pathway, built on baneful riffs, hallucinatory melodies and bellicose atmospherics, shifting said journey between a somber stroll through deep space, and a hellacious rollercoaster through black holes. An incalculable dreamscape of fear and wonder, by way of early 90s-rooted, but forward-thinking Prog Death, in the vein of Appalling Spawn or mid-era Death. Great stuff!\n\nBlackbraid: Blackbraid I (Independent)\n\nPossibly the biggest name to come out of the Indigenous Black Metal movement, by far, with their debut full-length, that was met with an abundance of hype, that would unfortunately make detractors out of some, but still managed to find its footing and accumulate a following. Blackbraid is polarizing for sure, but there’s no denying his ability to create some gripping Atmospheric Black Metal, with subtle Folk elements peppered in, that stand out when implemented, which does just enough to keep from treading waters of stylistic complacency. A foggy, fierce and overall gripping homage to nature. heritage and Native American folklore. Blackbraid has earned his place among the modern giants, despite all the debate and bickering.\n\nCoscradh: Nahanagan Stadial (Invictus Productions)\n\nRaw, ignorant and primitive Blackened Death Metal, with a blood-wet grit that pulls no punches. Absolute bare-bones brutality, with the rawness of bands like Teitanblood, the blasphemous conviction of Angelcorpse and the knuckle-dragging barbarity of Revenge or Conqueror, all rolled up into one, filthy, dripping slab of Death Metal glory! More raw than any nerd with a candelabra can ever dream of achieving. Top tier Black/Death that stands out among the herd!\n\nWeregoat: The Devil’s Lust (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nThe long-awaited new EP from everyone’s favorite Bestial Black Metal perverts, Weregoat, finally conceived to further spread the gospel of Angelic filth, by ramming it into your skull with reckless abandon and leave you broken, bruised and with more orifices carved into your flesh, for horned up goatmen and fleshless incubi to enjoy as the main course for their blood orgy later on. Massive, chunky, hammering and deliciously violent, with no chance given for a breather. Blackened Death Metal the way it should be! Well worth the wait, for both us and that lovely lady on the cover, created by the one and only Rok from Sadistic Execution!\n\nKorpituli: As Infinite Shadows of the Nightsky (Korpituli Productions)\n\nI’ll never turn down Finnish Black Metal, and an album like this only solidifies that sentiment. Korpituli has made a name for itself, by creating some of the most mesmerizing Atmospheric Black Metal of the modern era, with a sound that explores the vast corridors of the mind and making the universe inside your head one with the universe around you. As sharp as a blade, but as potent as a shroom, Korpituli represents the mysterious wonder of the cosmos. as well as the mind, body and spirit, conveying such by immersing you in a fog of memories and dreams, both light and dark, and conjuring your deepest truths, to use and enhance your being. Pure emotion and bliss, found within darkness and mental turbulence. A gem within a sub-genre I usually find plagued by stagnation.\n\nGrenadier: Trumpets Blare in Blazing Glory (Drakkar Productions)\n\nStraight up Arghoslent worshipping Melodic Death Metal from Canada (do what you will with that information). Grenadier is the real deal and this ain’t your usual sanitized Melo-Death for mainstream ears. This album is a fucking riff buffet, that exudes triumph and mightful will, firing on all cylinders from the push of play, where glory does indeed blaze through the air as those catchy riffs are fired off one by one, with no room for a breather. Heavy, memorable and powerful! Perfect for all you sketchy fuckers out there.\n\nOrgan Failure: Neurologic Determination of Death (Headsplit Records)\n\nTruth be told, every other form of Death Metal is running circles around each and every “OSDM” band currently coming down the pipeline. In this case, we have Deathgrind. Miasmatic Necrosis put out an album that wiped the floor AND the street with every one of these HM2-jocking dorks, and Organ Failure is the latest one to come out and pick the bones. Neurologic Determination of Death is rotten, viscious and direct Deathgrind, with a seasoning of Goregrind peppered into the mix, with a bassline as thick as chunky, brain matter soup! A quick and painful pummeling of gravely guitars and muddy drums, floating through the murk of guttural, almost inhuman bellows. If early Carcass and Regurgitate is your bag, so is this. Filthy and inhumane all throughout. Get on it and get sterilized afterward.\n\nAbhor: Sex Sex Sex (Ceremonia Daemonis Anticristi) (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nI’ve always enjoyed Abhor and their ghoulish, keyboard-laden style of Occult Black Metal, akin to that of Cultes des Ghoules or Mortuary Drape, and Sex Sex Sex all but disappointed me. The cheesy satanic imagery actually lines right up with their fiendishly groovy Black Metal sound, laced with intoxicating keys and catchy riffs, that flow like a smooth shot of Fireball whiskey. Some incredibly exquisite stuff, tailored with raw emotion and devilish conviction, hailing the desolate one himself, without overstaying its welcome. This will sure as shit be getting a lot of spins from me this Halloween season.\n\nBloodbath: Survival of the Sickest (Napalm Records)\n\nBloodbath’s sound pretty much is what it is at this point and you’ll either love it or hate it, and I, myself have been on both sides of the fence. The band’s discography is a spotty one for sure, and it’s no secret that I view Nightmares Made Flesh as the best fucking thing they’ve ever done. That said, I also believe that Nick Holmes is the best thing that ever happened to them, and their output with him at the helm thus far has been super solid, and Survival of the Sickest might be the best yet of the Holmes era. This might be their most Nightmares Made Flesh sounding album since Nightmares Made Flesh itself; maybe not fully in sound, but the punch and the viscera that I only recognize from that album, was definitely channeled here. You can definitely expect the usual formula; the catchy riffs, punchy grooves, Holmes’ signature snarls wreaking allover the place, the whole nine yards. Fairly accessible, but a fine deviation from the rest of the 90s revivalist OSDM pack. Definitely polarizing, but an enjoyable outing by a band I’ve always had a softspot for.\n\nOther Mentions:\n\nVerberis: Adumbration of the Veiled Logos (Independent)\n\nTriumvr Foul: Onslaught to Seraphim (Vrasubatlat)\n\nBurialkult: Infernal Death Manifest (Drakkar Productions)\n\nThe Chasm: The Scars of a Lost Reflective Shadow (Lux Inframundis Productions)\n\nMoribund Dawn: Dark Mysteries of Time and Eternity (Carbonized Records)\n\nCastrator: Defiled in Oblivion (Dark Descent Records)\n\nBody Asphyxiation Science: Gravitational Blood Art (Gurgling Gore)\n\nNean: The Ominous Catharsis (Crystal Voidscape Records)\n\nCut: Vanquish the Weak (Independent)\n\nMerihem: Incendiary Darkness (I, Voidhanger Records)\n\nLysergic Mirror: Perceptual Purging (Jems Label)\n\nChamber of Mirrors: Apocalyptic Dream (Independent)\n\nRejoice! The Light Has Come: Untitled 2022 EP (Independent)\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nThat does it, my dudes. Again, quite a bit to unpack here, but definitely check out some of these other mentions as well, specifically, Cut (meaty Blackened Death from China), Moribund Dawn (Melodic Black Metal, Sweden style, from Arizona), Nean (Bleak and nihilistic Black Metal from France) and Burialkult (punishing Blackened Death from Victoria, British Columbia), as well as the others! It was also a brutal summer for Extreme Metal and it made this Sky Satan season just a bit more tolerable. The tomb was kind to us this time around.\n\n‘Till next time. I’m packing in the shovel and heading off into the final stretch of 2022, which looks pretty goddamn promising.\n\nAlso… SHITANGEL FUCKING RULES!! GET ON THEM, POSERS!!\n\nThis is an entry that almost didn’t happen. I spent 2 weeks in a deep funk and was even wondering where I was even going with this blog. Therefore, I didn’t really think I had it in me to put one together. But, alas! Here we are. After finally pulling myself out of my latest depressive rut, I said “fuck it” and decided to put one together, because there are indeed some releases from the last couple months that need to be highlighted, that I enjoyed the hell out of, especially once I was finally able to get my head back on straight and get things back to (some level of) normalcy. With this selection, it had to be done! I’m back and I’ve got my shovel in hand and It’s time to dig up what’s left of the second quarter of 2022. So, let’s get out our flashlight, descend into the cavern and see what horrors await us.\n\nWhat Remains for Q2 2022:\n\nWhite Ward: False Light (Debemur Morti Productions)\n\nThis one was a wildcard for me, as I’m quite iffy on both Post-Black Metal and anything Avant Garde, but fuck, did White Ward make it work and make quite a name for themselves in the process! I’ve never heard outside elements like saxophone and other foreign (to BM) instruments implemented so seamlessly and used in ways that actually make sence, and not just for the sake of it. White Ward displays that sheer craftsmanship with glaring results, and forges a sound, both sonically eviscerating and cosmically engrossing, never breaking stride and exploding with emotive radiance through each track, without wasting a second. A perfect convergence of darkness and light, beaming across the sky, through vibrant melodies and razor sharp riffs, mired in the haunting glow of symphonic keyboards, saxophone and vocals ranging from visceral shrieks, to dramatic cleans and some surprises in-between. This is the type of album you’ll either get and allow yourself to drown in, or just scoff at and toss aside, either way, it’s an experience, that provides a cathartic climax to any longing soul, lost in nostalgic reverence.\n\nInanna: Void of Unending Depths (Momento Mori)\n\nLike your Death Metal hypnotic and Lovecraftian? Here’s a mid-year favorite for 2022! Inanna’s Void of Unending Dephts is an astral projection into the deep cosmos, shaking hands with ancient deities from beyond our realm. Chilean Progressive Death Metal, rife with intense riffs and searing melodicism, balanced and blended like a painting on a cave wall. A lengthy, but rewarding listen, dripping with otherworldly emotion, to be entranced by. Grab hold of the abomination’s tentacle and hold on tight.\n\nVomitrot: Rotten Vomit (Independent)\n\nMy expectations for Death Metal in 2022 ebb and flow like bipolar mood swings, but every now and then, there’s a gem that just gets it right and scratches that itch until it bleeds. Vomitrot is filthy, vomitous Death Metal, here to satisfy all your emetophillic needs! Sonically vile, atmospherically rotten and instrumentally crushing, reaching damn near Pissgrave levels of barbaric savagery, with a good hint of Doom added into the mix. I hesitate to slap the OSDM tag on this one, but it might be THE stand out of the genre for 2022, simply for having the balls to push the extreme to the excruciating level that I desire and shoving it down your throat until you upchuck a bloody, chunky heap onto your bathroom floor. So, sit down, throw those headphones on and give this beast a spin. Just keep a bucket nearby.\n\nOrgan Trail: Appetite for Dissection (Horror Pain Gore Death Productions)\n\nDeathgrind with teeth and claws, that comes out swinging for the meat on your bones from the press of play, but the chase is exhilarating. Pretty straightforward and nothing too off the beaten path, in terms of Grinding Death, but it’s brutal, nasty and face smashing, in just the right way. Riffs are present and aplenty, everything is delivered relentlessly and it does indeed have an appetite and will either swallows you whole like a snake to a mouse, or chew you up and spit you out, if it doesn’t like the taste. As harsh and relentless as Deathgrind can get, without taking itself too seriously.\n\nPaganizer: Beyond the Macabre (Transcending Obscurity Records)\n\nSwedish Death Metal for fans of Swedish fucking Death Metal. The best way I can describe this rifftastic beast of a 12th album by these underrated 20-year vets, still belting out punishment with cruel force. Very old school in spirit, but nowhere near generic, nor too progressive. Just the right amount of hammering aggression and more than enough sinister tone course through the veins of every track, coming at you at varying tempos and aims for the throat with every strike. Not much more to be said; Swedish Death Metal the way it was always intended to be. Dark, bludgeoning and blessed by the riff gods, if such deities exist.\n\nCome to Grief: When the World Dies (Translation Loss Records)\n\nSludge Doom at its most ominous and nihilistic, that dripps with venom and hatred. Come to Grief will drag you right into their misery-laden bubble and make you see the world for what it really is, by playing its own soundtrack to its imminent demise, while its foundation crumbles beneath us. A dystopian walk through a derelict wasteland, reduced to valleys of dirt, ash and death, vividly depicted through a pallet of crushing riffs and slow, patterned drums, crawling with despondency, stepping on the deceased skulls as it walks through this apocalyptic valley of death. Excellent, straightforward Sludge, possessed by depressive longing and worldly resentment. A catharsis of grief in raw, sonic form.\n\nEgregore: The Word of His Law (20 Buck Spin)\n\nThe debut full-length by Vancouver, BC’s Egregore is indeed as tumultuous and disorderly as it looks and as many have described it as. A scalding melting pot of riffs, drenched in harrowing atmospherics and fuled by abstract esoterica, that boils voraciously as it unfolds, throwing you into an abrasive spiral of knuckle-dragging riffs, murky drums and bellowing growls, amalgamating into a sonic fever dream, slathered in chaos and panic. Once the debris clears and you lay violated by this swift, but painful assault, no god can answer your prayers, but the eye that watches you, lamenting at the perverse masterpiece it has created. Definitely another favorite for the first half of 2022.\n\nHeinous: Ritual, Blood and Mysterious Dawn (Independent)\n\nI’m at the point where I can’t take candelabras seriously anymore, but the flames that burn through the wax displayed here, burn with true sincerity and the lowermost depths of bloodlust. The sound of Belgium’s Heinous is a harrowing fog of chaotic mysticism, snarling with satanic lust and feral eroticism, opening doors to relams far beyond anything the feeble mind can comprehend. Occult Black Metal with a bloodsoaked aura, suffocating and oppressive atmospherically, as well as methodical and torturous in sound and delivery. Conviction rings loud and true throughout the fog and tainted air on this one and you’re bound, gagged and forced to bleed out, as it drains your blood for sacrificial purposes.\n\nTheriomorph: Diabolical Bloodswords (Terratur Possessions)\n\nBlack Metal is a sword, and Theriomorph has no qualms with driving it through your heart and licking the blade clean afterwards. One of the purest Black Metal releases I’ve heard this year thus far, adhering to the genre’s grassroots formula and delivering it with razor sharp precision and force. An insatiably bloodthirsty monolith of satanic grandiosity, forged from the rawest passion for suffering sheep and slaying false gods without remorse. No gimmicky bullshit to be found here, as so-called “Raw Black Metal” nerds will choke on its venom if exposed.\n\nEggs of Gomorrh: Wombspreader (Godz ov War Productions)\n\nWant to know what it feels like to be torn limb from limb by parasites, as they contort your body to properly rip it apart socket by socket, as they feast on your flesh and tissue? Eggs of Gomorrh has you covered, as they present a style of Blackened Death, that makes your skin crawl and makes you want to bathe in Purel afterward. Sick, vile and relentless invocations, that feel like you’re caught in a mudslide with a bunch of hellish creatures, unseen by the outside world, who eat you the fuck alive, both to survive and keep from being spoken of. Filthy, murky and vengeful, in the vein of Blackened Death Metal’s slimiest purveyors, like Father Befouled and Prosanctus Inferi. Not for the faint of heart… or easily preyed upon.\n\nBilly Odal: …and the Search for Agartha (Not On Label)\n\nPost-Punk is usually pretty scarce on this blog, but thankfully, I can change that, at least for the time being! Billy Odal was a random Bandcamp find and definitely one that was meant to happen! If you’re into the romantic, crooning Goth Rock of Sisters of Mercy, the Black Metal-tinged Post Punk stylings of Cemetery Echo, with the inclusion of foggy shrieks, and a little bit of Classic Rock licks and rhythms mixed in as well, then this is a unique one to sink your teeth into! It’s rife with emotion, vigour and melancholy, fused with catchy, melodic rhythmics and a little bit of menacing Blackened grit. It’s dreary, it’s emotive and it’s golden. A gem for any Post-Punk freak out there!\n\nOther Mentions:\n\nBlood Countess: Occulta Tenebris (Independent)\n\nVampyric Mass: Malignant Transference (Independent)\n\nDestruction Ritual: S/T (Independent)\n\nZous: No Ground to Give (Closed Casket Activities)\n\nVoimaton: Profane Vestige (Personal Records)\n\nCadaver Coils: Offerings of Rapture and Decay (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\nAparthiva Raktadhara: Adyapeeth Maranasamhita (আদ্যাপীঠ মরণসংহিতা) (Iron Bonehead Productions)\n\n_____________________________________________________\n\nThat’s all for now, folks. Again, this was kind of on a whim, but I feel like it needed to be done, especially since I aim to be more productive on the blog this year. I gotta say, it’s been a pretty damn good year for Death Metal so far! Inanna, Vomitrot, Egregore and others that I’ve reviewed recently (Light Dweller, Pharmacist, Aeviterne, Immolation) have all belted out some rippers over the first half of the year, and there are others that I’m highly anticipating! NONE of which are generic OSDM. Whenever I think it’s time for Death Metal to be Ol’ Yeller’d, something comes along and gives me hope! That’s basically my main takeaway from this list, but maybe you feel otherwise. In which case, more power to ya!\n\nThe first half of 2022 is in the tomb and it’s time to leave it to rot, as we enter the season of the cursed yellow orb. See y’all fuckers soon!\n\nDeath Metal, beyond it’s primal stages, has had it’s ups, but many, many downs over the years. As the genre became more modernized, bands like Suffocation and Cryptopsy came along and were able to introduce more technicality and sharper precision to the style, and create something interesting, while sticking to it’s primitive roots and build off of them, without straying too far from the art. Then there were bands like Lykathea Aflame, Cynic and Gorguts, who brought a new level of progression and technical prowess to the table, and gave it their own genre-bending twist, that added a new layer of melodic depth and psychedelic cacophony, and managed to fuse both elements together, into their own, distinctive, mind-fucking sound, that resonated with those who were itching for something different, that separated itself from the herd, and pushed the creative boundaries of where Death Metal can go, and opened the door to new sonic planes, which in turn, made them stick out like sore thumbs, with albums that still get talked about to this day. Then, there are bands who take the term “technical” a smidge too seriously and mindlessly wank their instruments until they’re blue in the face, while over-producing their sound to no end. There’s a way to do these things on both the technical and progressive sides of the spectrum, as demonstrated by the first few bands I just mentioned; the band who are the subject of this review, New Zealand’s Ulcerate, can do both, as they have proven time and time again, throughout their already insane discography, but have solidified with this nightmarish hellscape of an album that they have bestowed upon us here in 2020.\n\nStare into Death and be Still is Ulcerate’s sixth album, and further demonstrates the band’s technical prowess, and holistic skill, that they tirelessly implement into their sound, to create an ominous, menacing, psychedelic trip in aural form, that overtakes your senses and makes you sit there and pay attention to every last note and word that it’s conveying to you, through a punishing, but equally spellbinding amalgamation of beauty, darkness and esoterica. Very rarely does a Death Metal album take melody, ferocity, technicality, atmosphere and progression, and blend it together in such a massive and vibrant way, that it sends chills down your spine, like a cold breath on the nape of your neck, in the form of potent, melodic riffs that sneak up on you when you least expect it and catch you off-guard, under a chaotic storm of quaking drums and maiming guitars, all kept at a pace, and carefully crafted, to where everything is placed where it should be, and nothing is wasted. Every inch and detail of this album is laced with the deepest and rawest of emotion, which molds it into one of the most evolutionary and captivating Death Metal albums I’ve heard in recent memory, which a very select few bands can pull off, including Ulcerate, who, in and of themselves, are an evolutionary band, who peels back their stylistic repertoire layer by layer with every release. Everything flows together through various tempos, well-placed riff sections, moments of calm and outbursts of chaos, under an atmosphere that sounds like being trapped in a cave in the middle of a storm, in a dystopian, post-apocalyptic landscape that you were somehow unlucky enough to survive.\n\nStarting off with the mid-paced and spiraling The Lifeless Advance, which really caught me off guard, with the level of potency in the melodic riff that swells through the first minute of the track, that immediately brought on the goosebumps. It’s the more melodic side of this album that sneaks up on you and plants itself into your psyche and fill you with euphoria. That quickly became apparent as this track went on, and upped the chaos throughout. The more chaotic side is also very well done, and showcases the band’s tight technical prowess, that stays within it’s boundaries and doesn’t go too overboard, into fretboard wankery, a la a majority of the Tech-Death genre over the years. These guys showcase Tech-Death in it’s most precise form, keeping within the confines of what it should naturally sound like, while evolving within said confines, even on slower tracks, like that first one, as well as well as the title track, plus the harsher and more aggressive numbers, like Exalted in Ash and There is No Horizon. The band holds true to the genre’s chaotic and crafty roots, while making it their own, and soaking it in their own nuance, as bands like Suffocation and Cryptopsy did (the former of which helped spawn a whole other genre in Slam); in Ulcerate’s case, the defining element is absolutely the melody, that drags you through a gut-wrenching fog of melancholia and disdain, though raw, visceral emotion; sounds like something of a Death Metal version of Svartidauði or Sinmara. Very few bands can make atmosphere and melody meet in such a smooth and endearing way, and make it flow together so effortlessly.\n\nI’m also not discounting the rest of Ulcerate’s discography. They’ve always been one of the more interesting Technical Death Metal acts around, who kick the over-the-top fretboard wankery to the curb, and use their skill to their utmost advantage, to craft a multiverse of holistic disarray, with each album exploring a similar, but simultaneously different sonic plane, that they mold into their own image, by pulling from the deepest, darkest facets of their psyche. This is Death Metal for the deep thinkers, as well as those tied up by depression, or just the nihilistic-minded, who crave chaos and dwell in despondency. The emotion is real and you can feel it, with every melodic riff that offers you a small breath of air, as you suffocate in the oppressive atmosphere that this album permeates. The tracks I’ve already mentioned are just the tip of the iceberg, as there is so much to unpack and discover with every listen, even in the slower and more steady tracks, like Visceral Ends and closer, Dissolved Orders. This is the most multi-faceted, detailed and organically ardent Death Metal I’ve heard in a long time, that the term ‘Progressive fits right into, and is actually deserving of that merit, unlike many other cacophonous messes of bands, who that term gets thrown at willy nilly. This is something truly evolutionary, with a solid foundation, that’s built on naturally and with purpose. The end result is a harrowingly beautiful experience of a listen, from front to back.\n\nI think it’s corny when a band calls their new album “the official soundtrack to the apocalypse”, which we’ve seen plenty of lately, but if we truly are witnessing one right now, this is definitely the album I’d want to perish to. True emotion and nightmarish beauty radiates from this from start to finish, without a single low point, or any wasted motion; a true, psychedelic trance of an album, if there ever was one. Ulcerate have never been one to disappoint throughout their existence thus far, and this album is the magnum opus of them all, so, give it a listen and let the void consume you.\n\nStare into Death and be Still is available now through Debemur Morti Productions and the Ulcerate Bandcamp.\n\nYou probably hear a lot about War Metal these days if you’re on the Extreme Metal section of social media. I don’t want to call it a “trend”, because that would be a bit of a stretch, but it has been getting a lot of buzz lately, especially with newer bands lighting up the genre like a nuclear holocaust. Bands like Antichrist Siege Machine, Ride for Revenge, Tetragrammacide, Nyogthaeblisz and others have sort of revitalized things for the genre in recent years and made it even more dissonant and punishing than usual, with the addition of Noise to the mix. We have the more classic names mentioned a lot now too, like Blasphemy, Revenge, Black Witchery and so on, but these newer acts are getting some shine lately and it’s good to see, because I do like all of them. This review isn’t about them, however; I’m just pointing out the obvious. This review is for the latest offering by one of the hardest hitters of them all, who pack just as devastating of a punch now as they always have! This is the new album by the mighty Archgoat, and it’s another fucking ripper of absolutely ruinous proportions.\n\nThe Luciferian Crown is the 4th full-length album by the Finnish war blasphemers, and it’s already gotten a hell of a reception, which after hearing it myself, is definitely the right one. This is Archgoat at their absolute most violent and destructive, bearing their signature brand of filthy and chaotic Blackened Death Metal with thick, nasty guitars that sound like the audio equivalents to spiked bats beating you into bloody mush, equally thick, head-bashing drums that belt out those signature paced but crushing blast-beats that make the band’s sound so recognizable and topping off the madness, is the sickening growls of Lord Angelslayer, that still sound as vile and snarly as ever. The only difference I can find between this album and the last 3, is the production, which isn’t necessarily clean, per se, just a bit different, but it works. Archgoat remain one of the more consistent bands in Extreme Metal, who know how to keep things fresh while making their sound nastier and more punishing with each passing release. This album is nothing short of another example of that.\n\nAfter a brief intro, Jesus Christ, Father of Lies wastes no time in blasting out at you with vicious force, with said blast-beats and blistering chords, while the snarls seep over them. It begins beating your ear-cells into submission right from the jump and gives no fucks in doing so. A ton of sweet riffs are present as well. There was always something particularly harsh and barbaric about Archgoat’s sound, that makes them stand out, even in a sub-genre as saturated (at one point, at least) as War Metal. They have this certain feel of evil and malice to them, that creates the apocalyptic vibe that surrounds their sound; their production has always helped with that too, especially on their first 2 albums. Back to this album, Jezebels Black Mass Orgy continues the barbaric assault and doesn’t let up from the previous one, aside from a new set of hellish riffs. Then comes Messiah of Pigs, which you may want to skip the intro of if you’re a vegan, especially the annoying kind; another savage brute of a track where Angelslayer’s growls particularly shine through. The guy sounds extra fucking demented on this album and I love it.\n\nThere are also tracks that take things in a Thrashier direction, like Darkness Has Returned and Star of Darkness and Abyss, which has somewhat of a Destroyer 666 feel to it, which I dig. Both good tracks that’ll make your head bop, whether it wants to or not. Then there’s The Obsidian Flame (from My Depths), in which the intro alone will melt your face allover your clothes; one of the few tracks that slows things down a bit but still keeps that punch packed and lethal. Same goes for the title track. Another standout is the chaotic, rumbling closer, I Am Lucifer’s Temple. It’s always good when the closing track stands out and ends an album on a memorable note. It’s a paced and pretty groovy track, the ripping chords are protruded one last time, but much slower and an odd bass riff hovers throughout it. The vocals also reach a new height of ugliness for the last track. Again, it ends on a memorable note.\n\nSo, needless to say, Archgoat once again did not disappoint. They bring pure bestial savagery to the table like no other in their genre. Whether you want to call it War Metal or Blackened Death Metal (potato, potaato), is your choice, but the ruthlessness and evil that they bring to it is unmatched, as far as I’m concerned. I’ve been a fan of these guys for well over a decade now, and the fact that they’ve been around for well over 2, and are still putting out quality, head-smashing jams says it all. I was in full anticipation mode from the moment this album was announced and to say it was worth the wait would be an understatement. Another job well done by one of Extreme Metal’s most revered veterans. Hail to the fucking goat!"
