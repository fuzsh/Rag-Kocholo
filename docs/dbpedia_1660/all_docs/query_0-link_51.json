        "text": "Finnish Black Metal horde BEHEXEN recently announced that a new album is in the works and should be released in 2021.\n\nIn the meantime, past albums have been reissued on vinyl through their current label, Debemur Morti Productions. “Rituale Satanum“, “My Soul For His Glory“, “Nightside Emanations” and “The Poisonous Path” are available now, “By The Blessing Of Satan” should be done later this year.\n\nBEHEXEN was born under a black banner in 1994 when Torog (vocals), Horns (drums) and Reaper (guitars) joined forces. Black Metal has been the keyword since inception.\n\nThe first demo “Reality Is In Evil…” briefly saw the moonlight in ’95; the second demo “Eternal Realm” surfaced in ’97; and the third demo “Blessed Be The Darkness” followed in ‘98. At this point, Reaper left the band and BEHEXEN recruited Gargantum on guitar and Lunatic on bass in order to perform live rituals. “Blessed Be The Darkness” brought forth an ill-fated deal from Sinister Figure and the debut album “Rituale Satanum” was recorded in the summer of 1999. Due to countless problems, the band drifted away from this rip-off label and waited three years for that deal to expire. During this period, Veilroth joined as second guitarist.\n\nIn May 2003, BEHEXEN signed with Finnish label Woodcut Records and recorded their second full-length album “By The Blessing Of Satan” which was unleashed the following year.\n\nIn 2008, fresh from the Tour Of The Blackmoon with ARCHGOAT and HELL MILITIA, the band unleashed its third album, “My Soul For His Glory” on Hammer Of Hate.\n\nBEHEXEN has now inked a deal in blood with Debemur Morti Productions to deliver the fourth full-length, the two parties having conspired previously on a reissue of the BEHEXEN / HORNA split.\n\nBEHEXEN, with original members Torog and Horns, is and always will be Black Metal in its blackest and rawest form.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/behexen.official/"
