        "text": "Akhlys – House of the Black Geminus\n\nRelease Date: 5th July 2024\n\nLabel: Debemur Morti Productions\n\nBandcamp\n\nGenre: Black Metal\n\nFFO: Blut Aus Nord, Deathspell Omega, Darkspace, Nightbringer.\n\nReview By: Ceta\n\nAkhlys is a band shrouded in mystery and even controversy. However, that hasn’t stopped them from becoming one of the most interesting bands in black metal right now. Their sound could be described as trapped in a very violent and chaotic nightmare. It’s horrifying and yet fascinating. Hence, my expectations on House of the Black Geminus were slightly higher than usual.\n\nHouse of the Black Geminus delivers an intense and dense atmospheric experience. It stands out as the band’s most immersive work yet. Unlike their previous albums, this one isn’t as chaotic; it’s characterized by an overwhelming loudness that makes it difficult to discern the intricate riffs, (but that’s nothing new) drawing listeners in with a compulsion to unravel its complexity. I’m a fan of the Dreaming I, so this album sounds considerably different. It’s more focused on sound experimentation than on being pure black meal\n\nAkhlys has clearly evolved their sound with this release. While the album retains familiar pieces regarding its shape, it introduces several new elements. There’s a significant level of exploration; the mix is more compressed, and there are shorter melodic lines than before. The album creates a relentless wall of malevolent noise. This change marks a departure from their previous works, focusing more on creating a menacing atmosphere than bleak melodies.\n\nThe production quality of House of the Black Geminus is notably loud. The pervasive white noise in the background, though intentional, can be distracting. I believe there might be a synth making this “noise”, but honestly Akhlys twists instruments’ natural sounds so much, that I don’t know what’s what anymore. In a way, that can be seen as a positive, though. I also think it’s an album that might take time some time to click. If this is your first time with the band, it’s going to take a while to just understand what this nightmare is."
