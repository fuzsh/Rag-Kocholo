The misuse of and addiction to opioids,including prescription pain relievers, heroin, and synthetic opioids such as fentanyl, is a serious national crisis that affects public health as well as social and economic welfare. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that the total \"economic burden\" of prescription opioid misuse alone in the United States is $78.5 billion a year, including the costs of healthcare, lost productivity, addiction treatment, and criminal justice involvement.\n\nRoughly 21 to 29 percent of patients prescribed opioids for chronic pain misuse them.\n\nBetween 8 and 12 percent develop an opioid use disorder.\n\nAn estimated 4 to 6 percent who misuse prescription opioids transition to heroin.\n\nAbout 80 percent of people who use heroin first misused prescription opioids.\n\nOpioid overdoses increased 30 percent from July 2016 through September 2017 in 52 areas in 45 states.\n\nThe Midwestern region saw opioid overdoses increase 70 percent from July 2016 through September 2017.\n\nOpioid overdoses in large cities increase by 54 percent in 16 states.\n\nIn the late 1990s, pharmaceutical companies reassured the medical community that patients would not become addicted to prescription opioid pain relievers, and healthcare providers began to prescribe them at greater rates. This subsequently led to widespread diversion and misuse of these medications before it became clear that these medications could indeed be highly addictive.3,4 Opioid overdose rates began to increase. In 2017, more than 47,000 Americans died as a result of an opioid overdose, including prescription opioids, heroin, and illicitly manufactured fentanyl, a powerful synthetic opioid.1That same year, an estimated 1.7 million people in the United States suffered from substance use disorders related to prescription opioid pain relievers, and 652,000 suffered from a heroin use disorder (not mutually exclusive)\n\nDOT Compliance Checklist in Shubuta, MS\n\nDOT 49 CFR Part 40 Requirements for Safety Sensitive Employees.\n\n(FMCSA-FAA-USCG-FRA-PHMSA-FTA)\n\nPre-Employment Tests\n\nCorrect Federal Custody & Control Form (CCF)\n\nSubstance Abuse Professional Process\n\nRegulations on File\n\nRandom Pool Testing\n\n*Supervisor Training\n\n*Written Policy\n\nPost-Accident Testing Situations\n\nPrevious Employers Checks\n\nEmployee Education\n\nRecord Keeping\n\nRemoval of covered Employee\n\nDesignated Employer Representative\n\n* In addition, any company which employs 2 or more covered employees must have a written drug and alcohol policy and all supervisors must complete the DOT Supervisor Reasonable Suspicion Training.

Only after your employer receives a negative pre employment DOT drug test result (and negative alcohol test result - if administered) may you begin performing in a safety-sensitive capacity.\n\nWhat is random DOT Drug Testing in Shubuta, MS ?\n\nAll safety sensitive employees are subject to unannounced random drug & alcohol testing. Alcohol testing is administered just prior to, during or just after performing safety-sensitive functions. Depending on the industry specific regulations, you may only be subject to random drug testing.\n\nListed below are the current (2019) DOT random testing rates for each DOT agency.\n\n(800) 221-4291\n\nEnroll\n\nWhat is reasonable suspicion DOT drug testing in Shubuta, MS ?\n\nSafety sensitive individuals and employees are required to submit to any test (whether it is a drug test, alcohol test or both) that a supervisor requests based on reasonable suspicion. Reasonable suspicion means that one or more trained supervisors reasonably believes or suspects that you are under the influence of drugs or alcohol. Supervisors cannot require testing based on a hunch or guess alone; their suspicion must be based on observations concerning your appearance, behavior, speech and smell that are usually associated with drug or alcohol use\n\nWhat is return to duty DOT Drug Testing in Shubuta, MS ?\n\nIf you have violated the prohibited drug & alcohol testing rules, you are required to take a return to duty drug and/or alcohol test before being allowed to return to a safety-sensitive function for any DOT regulated employer.

In most cases you will then have to take a drug and alcohol test if you are involved in a qualifying crash. Each DOT agency may have specific rules with regards to what is a post-accident test, for example, the FRA requires a blood specimen for drug testing and an alcohol test.\n\nIf you are involved in a qualifying accident, you are required to remain available for this testing and are not permitted to refuse testing.\n\nRemember: Safety-sensitive employees are obligated by law to submit to and cooperate in drug & alcohol testing mandated by DOT regulations.\n\nWhat is DOT follow up drug testing Shubuta, MS ?\n\nDOT follow up testing occurs when an individual has violated the drug and alcohol testing rules. The amount of follow-up testing you receive is determined by a Substance Abuse Professional (SAP) and may continue for up to 5 years. This means the SAP will determine how many times you will be tested (at least 6 times in the first year), for how long, and for what substance (i.e. drugs, alcohol, or both). Your employer is responsible for ensuring that follow-up testing is conducted and completed. Follow up testing is in addition to all other DOT required testing and all follow-up tests will be observed.
