This charming and sexy second chance romance is the perfect beach read for fans of Helen Hoang and Ali Hazelwood.\n\nAt first glance, Hope Evans just landed the perfect job: spending the summer on a shark research boat. Except as every marine biologist knows, it's what's going on beneath the surface that counts, and Hope's new position comes with a big catch--the boat belongs to her ex-boyfriend, Adrian Hollis-Parker. For three years Hope's been treading water, staying away from anything that reminds her of their past. It's time to dive back into a job that could springboard her career--and maybe offer much-needed closure.\n\nSince their split, Adrian has risen to internet fame as a shark expert with the launch of his YouTube channel to dispel myths and educate viewers about sharks. But success rings hollow without Hope. Embracing this new career trajectory was a risk, but working in cramped quarters with the woman he never stopped loving? That has the potential to backfire in heartbreaking ways.\n\nSide by side, weathering storms of every kind, they'll have to navigate the murky waters of past hurts...and hope it's not too late to chart a new course...\n\nPerfect for fans of:\n\nSTEM Romance\n\nForced proximity\n\nCinnamon Roll Hero\n\nSlow Burn\n\nClosed Door Romance\n\n\"A cozy affirmation for introverts and homebodies about loss, love, and being enough.\" —Abby Jimenez, author of Yours Truly\n\nShe found the right guy at the dead wrong time . . .\n\nWhen thirty-year-old post-double-mastectomy BRCA1 carrier and reluctant thrill-seeker Alison Mullally arrives at her ex-boyfriend Sam’s funeral to discover that no one knows he dumped her, she agrees to play the grieving girlfriend for the sake of the family. Little did she know this meant packing up Sam's apartment with his prickly best friend, Adam Berg. After all, it'll only take four weekends . . .\n\nBut Adam doesn’t want Alison anywhere near him. Forced to spend long hours with the grump and his monosyllabic demeanor, Alison decides to put her people-pleasing abilities to the test. She will make him like her. And after awkward family affairs and packing up dilemmas, the two form a tenuous friendship . . . if “friendship” means incredible chemistry and sexual tension. Can Alison come clean and finally embrace the life and love she's always wanted?

An aging abuela slowly morphs into a marionette puppet. A struggling academic discovers the horrifying cost of becoming a Self-Made Man.\n\nIn There Is a Rio Grande in Heaven, Ruben Reyes Jr. conjures strange dreamlike worlds to explore what we would do if we woke up one morning and our lives were unrecognizable. Boundaries between the past, present, and future are blurred. Menacing technology and unchecked bureaucracy cut through everyday life with uncanny dread. The characters, from mango farmers to popstars to ex-guerilla fighters to cyborgs, are forced to make uncomfortable choices--choices that not only mean life or death, but might also allow them to be heard in a world set on silencing the voices of Central Americans.\n\nBlazing with heart, humor, and inimitable style, There Is a Rio Grande in Heaven subverts everything we think we know about migration and its consequences, capturing what it means to take up a new life--whether willfully or forced--with piercing and brilliant clarity. A gifted new storyteller and trailblazing stylist, Reyes not only transports to other worlds but alerts us to the heartache and injustice of our own.\n\nWhen someone dies to save your life, how do you ever forgive them?\n\nA World of Hurt is Mindy Mejia's highly-anticipated follow-up to the \"propulsive\" USA Today bestselling thriller To Catch a Storm where an Iowa City police officer and a DEA informant must work together to hunt down the remains of a hidden drug empire.\n\nKara Johnson always knew she'd die young and violently. It didn't matter who delivered the final blow, she would deserve it--her years spent running drugs and spreading violence would guarantee it. But death doesn't always go as planned. When her girlfriend sacrifices herself to save Kara's life, Kara is left grieving and adrift. She doesn't know why she's alive until the DEA shows up and offers her a choice: go to prison or turn informant to lure out the last of the drug trafficking ring that murdered her girlfriend.\n\nMax Summerlin is the kind of cop who needs answers--he's been shot twice in the last year while looking for them. Despite his family's objections and his struggle with chronic pain, he accepts an invitation from the DEA task force eagerly. That is, until he realizes he'll be babysitting reformed drug trafficker Kara Johnson as she goes undercover.\n\nMax knows Kara is keeping secrets. Kara doesn't trust anyone, let alone Max. But the cop and the criminal will have to find a way to work together fast, because they aren't the only ones hunting down the remains of a drug empire.

But her job search is not going well and when her resumé is rejected for the thirty-seventh time, she takes matters into her own hands. She gets “creative” listing her qualifications and answers the ethnicity question on applications with a lie—a half-lie, technically. No one wanted Native American Ember, but white Ember has just landed her dream accounting job on Park Avenue (Oklahoma City, that is).\n\nAccountant Ember thrives in corporate life—and her love life seems to be looking up too: Danuwoa Colson, the IT guy and fellow Native who caught her eye on her first day, seems to actually be interested in her too. Despite her unease over the no-dating policy at work, they start to see each other secretly, which somehow makes it even hotter? But when they're caught in a compromising position on a work trip, a scheming colleague blackmails Ember, threatening to expose their relationship. As the manipulation continues to grow, so do Ember’s lies. She must make the hard decision to either stay silent or finally tell the truth, which could cost her everything.\n\nFrom the author of Sisters in Arms comes the incredible, untold story of Effa Manley, a black businesswoman in the male dominated baseball industry, and, currently, the only woman inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame.\n\n1930s, New York City\n\nAn ambitious Harlem woman's husband upends her social climbing when he buys a Negro Leagues baseball team and appoints her as the team's business manager. Overnight, Effa Manley goes from 125th Street's civil rights champion to an interloper in the boys' club that is professional baseball.\n\nNavigating her way through gentlemen's agreement contracts, the very public flirtatious antics of superstar Satchel Paige, and a sports world that would much rather see this woman back in her \"place\" at home, Effa ultimately whips her team, the Newark Eagles, into the Negro Leagues Champions of 1946. But how long will she get to enjoy the fruits of her success before Major League Baseball tears it all apart\n\nBased on the incredible life of Effa Manley, an unforgettable and inspiring story about a woman with a dream who wound up with a baseball team.\n\nIn the vein of Where'd You Go, Bernadette and Fleishman Is in Trouble, a wickedly funny and incisive debut novel following a mother trapped in the rat race of NYC parenting as her life unravels.\n\n\"Heavenly hilarity for readers.\"--Good Housekeeping\n\nIt takes a village...just not this one.\n\nAnnie Lewin is at the end of her rope. She's a mother of three young children, her workaholic husband is never around, and the vicious competition for spots in New York City's kindergartens is heating up. A New York Times journalist-turned-parenting-advice-columnist for an internet start-up, Annie can't help but judge the insanity of it all--even as she finds herself going to impossible lengths to secure the best spot for her own son.\n\nAs Annie comes to terms with the infinitesimal odds of success, her intensifying rivalry with hotshot lawyer Belinda Brenner--a deliciously hateful nemesis, what with her perfectly curated bento box lunches and effortless Instagram chic--pushes her to the brink. Of course, this newly raw and unhinged version of Annie is great for the advice column: the more she spins out, the more clicks and comments she gets.\n\nBut when she commits a ghastly social faux pas that goes viral, she's forced to confront the question: is she really any better than the cutthroat parents she always judged?\n\nA shimmering epistolary novel incorporating emails, group texts, advice columns, newspaper profiles, and more, Plays Well with Others is a whip-smart, genuinely funny romp through the minefield of modern motherhood.

Warren's new home is on the verge of monumental change; the interstates under construction will bring new people, new opportunities, and new problems to Vermont, and the Cold War and protests against the war in Vietnam have finally reached the dirt roads and rolling pastures of Bethany.\n\nWarren has barely unpacked when he's called up to a remote farm on Agony Hill. Former New Yorker and Back-to-the-Lander Hugh Weber seems to have set fire to his barn and himself, with the door barred from the inside, but things aren’t adding up for Warren. The people of Bethany—from Weber’s enigmatic wife to Warren's neighbor, widow and amateur detective Alice Bellows — clearly have secrets they’d like to keep, but Warren can’t tell if the truth about Weber’s death is one of them. As he gets to know his new home and grapples with the tragedy that brought him there, Warren is drawn to the people and traditions of small town Vermont, even as he finds darkness amidst the beauty.\n\nTwo generations of a folk-rock dynasty collide over art, love, longing, and family secrets in this captivating and poignant debut\n\nIt's 1996, and alt-rocker Emma Cantor is on tour, with her sights trained on a record deal.

Emma is baffled by Judie's coldness, and is deeply shaken when she learns a long-kept secret about their family. When Emma uncovers more about her mother's past, she is vaulted to new heights as a performer. But the knowledge she gains also propels her toward a musical betrayal that further fractures her relationship with Judie. Increasingly famous, but fragile and isolated, Emma grapples with her mother’s legacy and what it means for her own future.\n\nWith the richness of a beloved folk song, The Singer Sisters moves between ’60s folk clubs and ’90s music festivals, chronicling the ups and downs of stardom while asking what women artists must sacrifice for success.\n\nA diverse group of New Yorkers are brought together by the search for a missing woman—in this electric novel of secrets, connection, and community.\n\n“Cinematic, preternaturally humane, and absolutely unputdownable—I just loved it.”—Claire Lombardo, People “What Your Favorite Authors are Reading This Summer”\n\n“Riveting.”—Charmaine Wilkerson, New York Times bestselling author of Black Cake\n\nBrooklyn, 2020.
