        "text": "Executive Department\n\nArticle X of the Chickasaw Constitution states, \"The Supreme Executive power of the Chickasaw Nation is vested in a Chief Magistrate, who shall be styled 'The Governor of the Chickasaw Nation.'\" He is the official spokesperson for the tribe and shares in the law-making process through recommendations made to the tribal legislature. The governor's duties include the day-to-day operations of the tribe, as well as the signing of official papers and official appointments.\n\nThe governor of the Chickasaw Nation works much like U.S. presidents with staff and cabinet members to help guide the many departments and divisions within the tribe. While some departments and divisions serve the tribal citizens directly through programs and services, many tribal employees work behind the scenes, fulfilling internal tribal needs.\n\nJudicial Department\n\nThree justices are also elected on the tribal supreme court. The three supreme court justices perform constitutional interpretative duties much like the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nThe first constitution of the Chickasaw Nation was ratified in 1856. A new constitution was ratified in 1983. The seat of the tribal government is located in Ada, with regional offices located in Ardmore, Ada, Tishomingo and Purcell."
