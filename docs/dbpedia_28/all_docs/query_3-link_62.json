        "text": "After the destruction of their homeland in 1704, the Southeastern Apalachee dispersed across the Southeast, with two communities eventually settling along the Central Gulf Coast within 50 miles of each other. Residing in a complex cultural borderland created by constant Native American migrations and European power struggles, the Apalachee experienced rapid culture change in the 18th century, as evidenced by their material remains at the archaeological sites of Mission San Joseph de Escambe in Northwestern Florida and Blakeley Park in Southern Alabama. This thesis explores the nature of the cultural evolution the Apalachee experienced through a highly detailed ceramic analysis and includes a comparative analysis of both 18th century Apalachee settlements, as well as the sites of 17th century Apalachee Mission San Luis de Talimali and the late 18th century Creek village Fusihatchee. Making use of the theoretical perspectives of creolization, hybridity, and practice theory, it can be argued that 18th century Apalachee ceramics reflect a hybridized ceramic practice, influenced by cultural history, geographic location, and social networks.\n\nThe Pensacola-Mobile region of the 18th century was a nexus of cultural change, and the stage of a creolization of Apalachee identity. In the process of studying cultural hybridization experienced by dispersed peoples, new ceramic analysis methods were developed to answer research questions that necessitated minute levels of detail. These new methods added a nuanced depth to a study that required ample data to discuss late contact period culture change and have the potential to be applied for future research of other projects.\n\nBy the early 18th century, the Northern Gulf Coast was a nexus of cultural exchange; home to many displaced native peoples. After the destruction of their homeland of Tallahassee in 1704, the Apalachee became dispersed across the American Southeast, contacting several cultures including the Creeks, several Mobile Bay and Mississippi Valley Indian groups, and French colonists. The Pensacola-Mobile region developed into a cultural borderland which facilitated creolization and hybridization of multiple ethnic groups. This discussion of Apalachee history examines the cultural transformations experienced by people in the 18th century, and to determine how it may be reflected in ceramic traditions.\n\nExcavations at the terrestrial settlement of Tristán de Luna y Arellano on Pensacola Bay suggest that the material culture of the colonists at the site between 1559 and 1561 included a significant amount of contemporaneous Native American ceramics evidently scavenged along with food from evacuated communities along the coast and interior. Combined with newly-discovered documentation detailing the establishment and use of a road between Pensacola and the temporary Spanish settlement at Nanipacana in central Alabama, and deteriorating Native-Spanish relations during this period, these new data offer important insights into the indigenous social geography of this region at a pivotal time.\n\nAfter 1704 attacks by the British and their Native American allies, some Apalachee fled their homeland to French Mobile, Spanish Pensacola, and Creek areas. Primary research indicates that those Apalachee who chose to ally politically with either the French or Spanish maintained social connections with both nations as well as the Lower Creek, and through the Creek enjoyed an economic connection with the British. At the same time, by consistently referring to the groups as Apalachee, documents imply some maintenance of Apalachee tradition during the eighteenth century. Comparisons of ten tightly-dated ceramic assemblages quantify material shifts through time and space and augment the historical record. This synthesis illustrates that Apalachee refugees had sufficient resources to play Europeans against each other yet adopted new ceramic traditions. Political and material maneuvering thus allowed them to maintain their social identity.\n\nIn 1704 the Apalachee of La Florida dispersed across the Southeast, with two communities eventually settling in the Central Gulf Coast, some 50 miles apart. Residing in a complex cultural borderland created by constant Native American migrations and European power struggles, the Apalachee experienced rapid culture change in the 18th century. Making use of ceramic data from these two Apalachee settlements, as well as their ancestral homeland of San Luis and the 18th century Creek village of Fusihatchee, this paper examines how Apalachee culture evolved in the 18th century, and how it became evident in their hybridized ceramic practice."
