As any resident will tell you, Texas itself is a vast country, encompassing virtually the entire Southern Plains, but with a good dose of forests, prairies, deserts, mountains, canyons, rivers, and coastline. A multitude of Indian peoples made use of these environments for thousands of years. Apaches, Comanches, and Kiowas traveled the plains, Wichitas and Tonkawas on the prairies, Caddos in the East Texas forests, Atakapas and Karankawas on the Gulf Coast, Coahuiltecans in South Texas, and Jumanos and Tiguas along the Rio Grande and Pecos. Of course, these were just the major nations. There were also a multitude of much smaller, virtually autonomous bands whose members saw themselves as a single people but who have long since vanished from the land and the history books: Beitonijures, Achubales, Cujalos, Toremes, Gediondos, Siacuchas, Suajos, Isuchos, Dijus, Colabrotes, Unojitas, Juanas, Yoyehis, Humez, Bibis. And these are just a scant few of the many peoples who made Texas home at one time or another. Sometimes it is easy for us to forget that the Indians of Texas had a history long before Spaniards ever showed up in the Western Hemisphere. And that ancient history, as well as how Indian peoples saw their world, ordered their societies, put food in their stomachs, and determined how they interacted with each other. All this is certainly meal for the historian’s metate. Add the Spanish, French, English, Mexicans, Americans, and such migrant Indians as the Alabama-Coushattas, and you have a mix that has attracted historians for more than forty years and continues to do so in ever-growing numbers. Unfortunately, the story of European and American colonists has overshadowed that of Texas Indians. Because historians rely so much on written records, which the Spanish, French, Mexicans, and Americans left in vast quantities, we often overplay the roles of the Spanish or Americans and virtually ignore that of the Indians. Too often Texas Indian history has devolved into Spanish-Indian relations or American-Indian relations. In 1961 anthropologist W. W. Newcomb, with the publication of The Indians\n\nix\n\nx\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nof Texas, was the first to really examine the Indians themselves and their own history. Providing both a cultural and historical study of the Indian peoples of Texas, it has remained the classic history of Texas Indians. Nevertheless, Professor Newcomb would certainly agree that much new information on Texas Indians has come to light in the last forty years. However, I have tried to follow in his footsteps. This book is a history of the Texas Indians, not a history of Europeans or Americans in Texas. At every step I have tried to keep the Indians at center stage. Rather than just rudderless victims of Europeans, Indians had their own agendas and utilized strategies to realize them. This is not to say they did not suffer greatly at the hands of Europeans and Americans, only that Indian peoples were players in their own drama and tried to arrange things to their benefit. Sometimes it worked. Sometimes it did not. As the reader begins this historical adventure, a few caveats might make the road a little easier to travel. First, historians examine change and continuity over time, and the Indians of Texas certainly experienced both. Outside pressures, fresh ideas, and new products helped change their societies. A Wichita in 1542 was certainly different from a Wichita in 1842. But Indian peoples had an ancient history during which they developed beliefs, traditions, outlooks, and approaches that provided a foundation for their societies. These often changed little, and many can still be found among Wichitas and other Indians at the turn of the twenty-first century. Another caution is that readers should be prepared for the changeability of Indian identity. Over time and for a variety of reasons, bands and nations might break apart and their people scatter to the winds. Some might form a new band with a new name. Some might go live with other bands. Some might be absorbed by wholly different peoples. Or they might welcome outsiders into their bands. To put it in perspective, one could think of the Celts, Angles, Saxons, and Jutes, the different peoples who helped make modern Britain. What did it take to be a Saxon? How did a person know she was an Angle and not a Jute or a Celt? What became of them? And what happened after 1066 when the French settled in England? Were there “full-blooded” Jutes then? Where are they now? Similarly, one would be hard-pressed in these early years of the twenty-first century to find a Rio Grande Jumano either in or outside of Texas. Some Jumanos became Apaches; some became Mexican peasants; and others went to live with other Indians. Nevertheless, one can still find people up and down the Rio Grande who might trace their ancestry back to the Jumanos. For many Europeans and Americans, Indians seemed to run willynilly around Texas with plenty of madness but little method. Over the years, many historians have viewed Indians in similar lights, often using\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nxi\n\nsuch words as “treacherous” or “renegade” to describe them. These concepts fade when one looks closer at Indian politics and diplomacy or even admits that Indians possessed such things. Indian history becomes clearer when we view Indians as people hoping to navigate their way through an increasingly confusing world. Rival chiefs offered competing views of the direction their people should take. Indian peoples long understood the value of trade networks and worked to be a part of them or even dominate them. They also had a sense of territoriality, knowing where theirs ended and other people’s began. And they were quick to prevent intruders from invading their land or having access to valuable resources, such as the Southern Plains buffalo herds. They also understood the need for economic and military allies and went out of their way to make alliances in order to solidify their own advantages or press a war against their enemies. Indians, however, wanted not only to navigate through life but also, like most people, to maximize their economic well-being while adhering to traditional values and mores. If we can acknowledge this, then much of what Indians did in Texas makes sense even to non-Indians in the twentyfirst century. Indians lived in a world that made sense to them. That a buffalo might be a buffalo or maybe a spirit come to impart knowledge would not have surprised many Indians. That a dream could tell people what to do or even change the direction of their life was accepted by virtually every Indian of Texas. Everyone knew that life needed to be kept in balance and this entailed a host of obligations ranging from where to place a tepee or house, the way to smoke a pipe, how to dispose of a baby’s umbilical cord, or when to take revenge in order to restore harmony and allow the victim’s spirit to pass on to the next world. Kin took care of kin, and while people were free to display individual character traits, their first duty lay not in advancing themselves but in protecting and sustaining their community. Nevertheless, sustaining one’s community through bravery, generosity, and wisdom accorded status, something all men and women craved and which in turn brought political and spiritual power. Rather than “red devils” or “noble savages,” Indians had all the same virtues and vices of people the world over. And they usually wanted the same thing. Like all human beings, the Indians of Texas, deep down, wanted safety and security in this world and the next. At the most basic, Indian people wanted full bellies, peaceful sleep, good families, friendly neighbors, prosperous times, helpful gods, and an easy afterlife. Over the millennia they developed religious beliefs, political structures, social configurations, and economic strategies to achieve these goals. Consensus, community welfare, lines of kinship, obligations of reciprocity, harmony and balance, the divinity of nature all shaped the Indian worldview.\n\nxii\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nThis “red road” clashed lethally with European and American concepts of individual rights, authoritarian leadership, property ownership, capitalism, and a dynamic, conversion-oriented religion. European and American men also sought status, which came through land ownership and wealth, rather than generosity. Europeans and Americans lived in a world in which white was better than red and Christianity better than anything the Indians had. They believed what they had was “civilization” and what the Indians had was “savagery.” Therefore Europeans and Americans did not take Indians seriously. Certainly they took Indian threats to heart, but never the Indians themselves nor their culture. Few settlers or officials believed that Indians truly utilized the land or had legal claim to it. Nor did they believe that Indian culture possessed anything of value, that Indians suffered the same emotions that non-Indians did, or that an Indian might be one’s equal before God or the law. Over the last five hundred years, this Euroamerican way of viewing the world gradually triumphed. Helping it along were European diseases and superior technology combined with the Indians’ own fluid political structure, the inability of their societies to rapidly modernize, and the Indian determination to adhere to traditional ways in the face of a changing world. Of course, history is long and continues its march. So who knows what the next five hundred years will bring to Texas and the Indians who once called it home, and indeed still do. A word also needs to be said about some of the terminology and organization in this book. The debate goes on about what to call Indian people. Wherever possible, I have tried to call them by their national names—Comanches, Caddos, Kiowas, and such. Naturally, this may not be what they originally called themselves, but it is what they call themselves today and it is how most people know them. When it came to grouping them together as a whole, then I have opted for “Indian” over “Native American.” Most Indian people I know do not mind the term “Indian” and many prefer it over “Native American.” It is also less confusing than trying to get around “Native American” and the similar “Native- born American.” When referring to non-Indians, I’ve tried to be specific and use such national identities as Spain, France, England, Mexico, United States, and Texas. When I need to be very specific about non-Indians, sometimes I employ such terms as “Mexican,” “Anglo,” “African American,” “Tejano,” or “Texan.” When being a little more general, I’ve used “European” for colonial peoples and “American” for those who came to Texas after the colonial period. “Euroamerican” comes\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nxiii\n\nin to play when I want to differentiate between “Indian” and “non-Indian” characteristics. In organizing this book, one question I had to consider was “are those Indians who were pushed out of Texas into Oklahoma during the second half of the nineteenth century still Texas Indians?” I believe they are, and I know that many of them still consider Texas home. Just as I believe that those Indian people who migrated in to Texas became Texas Indians in their own right. Therefore, both the immigrant and emigrant Indians have their story told here. Unfortunately, Texas Indians pushed into Oklahoma do not get much press. While there are hundreds, even thousands, of works on Texas Indians prior to 1880, there are scant few once they are defeated and placed on reservations. Much historical and anthropological work needs to be done on Texas (and Oklahoma) Indians in the twentieth and twenty- first centuries. It is an open field. Finally, in writing this book, I have learned just how much research on Texas Indians has been done in the last forty years. To be sure, a considerable number of historical and anthropological books and articles have been published and more are coming out every day. I have tried to use as many and as large a variation of published sources as time and space would allow. However, I know that I have missed some and I hope these fine historians and anthropologists will forgive me. As always, a book such as this does not write itself. I owe much thanks and a tremendous amount of appreciation to friends and colleagues who have made this work possible. First and foremost, Sophie Williams, Madeleine Bombeld, and Mary Corchoran in the Inter-Library Loan Department at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington. They worked hard to get me the articles and books I needed. A great thank-you also goes to my “boss,” Kathleen Berkeley, chair of the Department of History at UNCW. She has always been in my corner, always supported me and my penchant for researching and writing. Others at UNCW to whom I owe a nod of thanks include Andrew Clark and Renee Vincent. Both have listened to me for hours talking about Texas Indians. And both have offered constructive advice on how to approach certain subjects. Friends and colleagues around the country also helped in their own way. These include Gary Anderson at the University of Oklahoma, Brian Hosmer at the Newberry Library in Chicago, Mike Green and Theda Perdue at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Terri Baker at Northeastern State University in Tahlequah, Oklahoma, and her husband, Tom, Greg Cantrell, Donald Chipman, and F. Todd Smith at the University of North Texas, Wendy St. Jean now at Boston University, Clyde Ellis at Elon University, and the staff at Texas A&M University Press. As always, gratitude goes\n\nxiv\n\nP R E FA C E\n\nto my mother, Ann, my late father, Dick, and my two sisters, Tracy and Rhonda. Many friends in Wilmington and around the country also gave support in one way or another: Floyd Ebron, Jake Sulzbach, Gary Baer, Maureen Hankins, Kevin Sands, Kay Parks, Carrie Griffin, and Caryn Mills. I hope all will take pride in the part they played in making this history possible but none should shoulder any blame for errors. That is for me alone.\n\nThe Texas Indians\n\nChapter 1\n\nTexas’ Earliest Peoples t is not certain when the first human being set foot in Texas, just as it is not definite when the first person appeared in the Western Hemisphere. If, as scientists now say, humanity began in Africa about 4 million years ago and trekked outward from there, then the Western Hemisphere’s isolation from the rest of the world meant that these earliest humans never reached it. No Australopithecus, Homo Erectus, or Neanderthals ever left their mark on America. Instead human beings first reached North America, somewhere between 40,000 and 12,000 years ago. Texas has played its own role in the development of thought about the peopling of the Americas. During the 1950s, the bones of a woman, dubbed “Midland Minnie,” were discovered in Midland County. It caused a stir when her age was estimated first at 20,000 years, then later at 37,000 years, making her remains the oldest ever found in the Western Hemisphere. However, most research says she is about 12,000 years old, though arguments still rage over it.1 There is also no agreement on from where and how the first peoples arrived in this hemisphere. Most scientists believe they came from northeast Asia. However, increasing evidence points to several different migrations to the Western Hemisphere and from different parts of Asia. Until recently, the most widely held theory has people crossing the Alaskan land bridge, which anthropologists call “Berengia.” During the Pleistocene Epoch,\n\nI\n\n3\n\n4\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nwhich began about 1.6 million years ago, four separate ice ages, each thousands of years long, came and went. In the Western Hemisphere the last ice age, the Wisconsin glaciation, began 90,000 years ago and lasted for about 80,000 years. During the Wisconsin glaciation, much of the oceans’ water became trapped in glaciers, some extending far down into the northern United States. The lowering sea levels opened a fifty-five-mile-long, thousand-mile-wide bridge at the Bering Straits, allowing mammoth hunters from Asia to cross from one hemisphere to the other. Some anthropologists believe there may have been several waves of migrations across Berengia. Another theory gaining credibility points to people in small skin-covered boats, island-hopping across the Aleutians then down the Pacific coast.2 Peoples other than northeast Asians may well have contributed to the American Indian gene pool. Recent studies point to migrants from Japan, Europe, and Africa. While it is quite possible that some of these groups reached the Western Hemisphere thousands of years ago, it appears that the vast majority of early Americans descended from Asians, who either killed off or absorbed these other strays. No matter when or how people arrived, once in this hemisphere, humans multiplied and rapidly spread across the land, reaching the southern tip of South America about a thousand years or so later. When the ice age ended about 10,000 years ago and refilled the oceans, Berengia slipped back beneath the waves, essentially isolating the peoples of the Western and Eastern Hemispheres from each other.3 Many Indian peoples point to their own oral traditions to explain their presence on the continent. Almost all Indian origin stories say they were created right here in this hemisphere. The Caddo farmers of East Texas say they emerged from underground near present-day Cross Lake and moved west into Texas’ Angelina and Trinity river valleys. The Tonkawas, people of North and Central Texas, say they also lived underground until wolves uncovered them and brought them into the Texas daylight. Ever since, the Tonkawas have revered the Great Wolf. The Atakapas of the upper Texas coast believe they came from the sea, later surviving a great deluge that covered all but the highest hills.4 In any event, the earliest evidence of humans in Texas so far is about 12,000 b.p. (before the present day), though some archaeologists think this date could be pushed back several thousand years. No matter what the date, Texas was different then from what it is in the early twenty-first century. Much of it was cool, wet, and green, with vast forests growing tall under regular rainfall. Grasslands covered the high plains of the Llano Estacado in West Texas. The climate was a pleasant ten degrees cooler than now, with mammoths, giant bison, tiny horses, and other herd animals\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n5\n\ngrazing alongside hundreds of streams and rivers that flowed across the region.5 While we will never know what these earliest Texans called themselves, anthropologists and ethnohistorians refer to them as Paleoindians.\n\nPaleoindians (ca. 12,000 B.P.–ca. 8,000 B.P.) These first peoples of Texas lived by hunting the large herd animals, particularly mammoths and giant bison. They also gathered a variety of local plants. Though Paleoindians may have descended from early Asian hunters, and most shared Type O blood, once they got here they quickly began diversifying in physical appearance. Some were tall, some short, some big, others small. Some had narrow heads and faces; others rounded, broad faces. And of course over time these groups intermarried and had children and so changed even more.6 By 11,500 b.p. maybe a few hundred people lived in Texas. Men mainly hunted big animals, as their bulky thrusting spears worked better on them than on smaller game. In much of Texas, that meant bison, mammoth, camels, and horses; the horses then were much smaller than those the Spanish brought with them. Of course, when the opportunity presented itself, hunters took deer, rabbits, squirrels, gophers, prairie dogs, turtles, lizards, and fish as well. In Texas, the giant bison seemed to be preferred over mammoth, possibly because there were more bison than mammoths on the Southern Plains. Women were no less important than men to the survival of the Paleoindian band. They might help the men on the hunt, butchering the animals and dressing the hides. They also gathered seeds, roots, nuts, berries, and firewood, and snared small game.7 Since they followed the herds, Paleoindian peoples lived in small bands of upward of forty people. The band formed the basic social and political unit of these hunter-gatherers and essentially was one big extended family. Often on the move, Paleoindians lived in caves and under rock overhangs where available and in small man-made shelters and places safe from wild animals when natural cover was not present. Always on the move meant traveling light, so it was useless for a person to acquire too many possessions. There could be no classes or even any true specializations. While one individual may have been better at making tools than someone else and another a superior game tracker, all men were equal in that all men, as long as they were able, had to hunt to provide for themselves and their family.8 Paleoindians followed the herds, moving where the game was most abundant, usually setting up their camps overlooking a watercourse. Teams of fathers, sons, brothers and other male relatives might go out daily\n\n6\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nor weekly to hunt in the area around their camp. Women might assist in these local hunts. Periodically, longer hunts were made, usually during the fall or spring. During these long hunts, teams trekked out a hundred miles or more and might be gone for several days or weeks. Women usually remained behind at a secure base camp, protected by a few older men. Staking out a water hole, hunters tried to ambush their prey as it came to drink. Sometimes they stampeded mammoths or bison over a cliff then leisurely killed off the wounded. At other times they built an artificial barrier to trap bison. Of course, some days consisted of long, tiring marches with little to show for the effort. No matter which method they used, it often took six or eight spear thrusts to take down a single mammoth or bison and several might be killed at one time. Skeletons have been found with numerous spear points still inside them. Because mammoths and bison were so difficult to bring down, Paleoindians depended to a considerable extent on the plants and small game acquired by the women. However, once the big game had moved on, so did the Paleoindians.9 Whatever game they hunted, Texas Paleoindians utilized an efficient set of stone tools. They chipped and pressure-flaked beautiful but deadly flint points. Some of these points had notches in the base, making it easier to bind them to the spear. Others had blood gutters, which quickly bled the wounded animal to death. These spears, some with detachable shafts, they either stabbed or hurled into the animal. After the kill, they used flint knives and scrapers to dress the meat and hides. Animal bones could then be made into spear-point shafts, shaft straighteners, awls, and needles. Ribs might be used as shelter supports.10 Hunting shaped all aspects of Paleoindian life. The people became great walkers. A hunting territory was normally about two hundred miles in diameter, and some bands returned to the same area time and again. Sometimes they traveled hundreds of miles to gather a favorite type of flint. Often on the move, the band relocated its camp by an average of sixteen miles a year, and when a person died, she might find herself five hundred miles away from the place of her birth.11 This dependence on hunting also gave rise to Paleoindian religious beliefs. Like later hunter-gatherers, each Paleoindian band probably had a medicine man who tried to harness spiritual power for the benefit of the band. This might mean using rituals to draw a herd of bison over a cliff or to areas nearer the band’s hunters. The medicine man, who could have been a woman, also tried to cure the sick, heal the wounded, change the weather, and predict the future. He or she also sent off the dead, who were typically covered in red ochre and buried along with stone projectile\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n7\n\npoints, bone and shell beads, maybe even with turtle shells, antler pieces, and bird claws.12 Though limited to rocks, wood, and bones, Paleoindians in Texas made important technological advances that propelled their societies into new directions. About 11,500 years ago, Paleoindians throughout North America began creating a rather distinct and efficient spear point. Archaeologists call it the Clovis point because these shapes were first found embedded in mammoth bones at Blackwater Draw near the town of Clovis, New Mexico, on the Texas border. These spear points predominated in Texas between 11,500 and 11,000 years ago, and the people who used them relied heavily on mammoths for food. Clovis people wandered throughout Texas, occupying sites near present-day San Marcos; at Miami in the Panhandle; in Denton County; at an oft-used butchering site near Lubbock; at the “original” Clovis kill site at Blackwater Draw; and in various places around East Texas. Nevertheless, most Clovis sites in Texas are on the Llano Estacado. Clovis people also migrated out of Texas, carrying their tools with them. Clovis points made out of flint from Texas’ Hill Country have been found in eastern Louisiana.13 Then, between 10,000 and 11,000 years ago, the Paleoindians in the western part of North America made another technological leap, one that made them even better hunters. They created a more efficient spear point, smaller but wider and with a deep blood gutter running from base to tip. At the same time, the climate of Texas’ high plains began drying, with many running streams giving way to standing ponds and marshes. During this time, mammoths became extinct in Texas. Whether climate change or human hunters that led to their extinction is still debated. With mammoths gone, Paleoindians in Texas, utilizing these new spear points, now turned on the giant bison. These points were first found near Folsom, New Mexico, embedded in the bones of a giant bison. Because of this, they are called Folsom points, and the people who used them are part of the Folsom culture. Though bison were important to Folsom cultures, those in the forests of East Texas relied to a greater extent on smaller game and foraging.14 Though Clovis and Folsom points have not been found mixed together at archaeological sites, one should not think of this as the “dying out” of the Clovis people and the birth of the Folsom, but rather a technological and cultural evolution. Like the people who used Clovis points five hundred years before them, Folsom people, at least those in West Texas, lived in rock shelters and caves, often the same ones previously used by Clovis people, such as at the Lubbock Lake site. Evidence of Folsom culture has also been found in East Texas, the Llano Estacado, the Central Prairies, and in the lower Pecos River valley. These camp sites usually overlooked\n\n8\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nwater sources where bison came to drink. Still, hunting could be a hazardous job, so like all human beings, Folsom people tried to make a hard job easier. At Bonfire Shelter near the Rio Grande, Folsom Paleoindians regularly ran herds of bison over a seventy-foot cliff. The bones of about 120 of the huge animals eventually collected at the cliff’s base.15 Since hunting was their life, Folsom people in Texas possessed a tremendous understanding of stone and its properties. Paleoindians from both the Clovis and Folsom periods knew what type of flint was best for tool-making and where to find it. One of the best places was at Alibates quarries in present-day Potter County, north of Amarillo. Tools made from this particular flint have been found all over North America and as far south as central Mexico. Paleoindian toolmakers dug tons of stone from the Alibates quarries, which continued to attract Indian peoples until the mid-nineteenth century. Now with a quality projectile point, Folsom people became choosy consumers, as the Lake Theo site near Quitaque in the Panhandle shows. At Lake Theo, Folsom peoples erected a base camp. From there, they drove bison into nearby canyons and killed them. They quickly butchered the youngest, most delectable bison and carried the ribs, legs, and hindquarters back to the base camp. Near the butchering site, the hunters set up a small shrine of bison bones arranged into a circle, then covered it with bones from the butchered animals.16 Always looking to improve their tools, Paleoindians in Texas began experimenting with various point designs. Both the Clovis and Folsom points had deep notches in the sides of the point’s base. About 10,000 years ago, toolmakers began making points without these notches, while finishing them with pressure flaking. Generally called Plano points, such different styles in Texas as Midland, Plainview, Lerma, Golondrina, Angostura, San Patrice, and Firstview have been identified by archaeologists. While Paleoindians still relied on the giant bison, they also hunted the small horses and the smaller, modern buffalo. And when these large animals were not available, they went after deer, rabbits, and rodents, which they supplemented by gathering and grinding seeds. The variety of point styles from this period seems to indicate that Paleoindians used different points for different animals. For example, Plainview points may have been used to bring down bison, while Golondrina points may have been for smaller game, such as deer, and may even have doubled as butchering knives.17 During this time, between 10,000 and 11,000 years ago, the ice age began coming to an end. The same climate changes that first killed off the mammoths in Texas began to alter all North America. Over the next several thousand years these climatic changes helped bring about the extinction of most giant mammals in the Western Hemisphere. The climate in\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n9\n\nTexas warmed in some areas, cooled in others. Rainfall fluctuated, bringing more and longer wet and dry cycles. Ponds evaporated. The tree line retreated east. Deserts formed in Southwest Texas, while on the Southern Plains grasslands appeared, attracting deer as well as the smaller American bison. Texas began to take on much of the geographic and climatic look it has today, though it was probably a little moister then. Over time, these changes took a toll on the large mammals. Some could not adapt as their habitats grew smaller and water became scarcer. Others could not adjust their reproductive cycles to the changing climate. Mothers might now give birth when there was no food for their young. New parasites and diseases killed their share, while there were always packs of wolves and coyotes ready to take out the young or feeble. Helping this killoff were the Paleoindians who staked out water holes, ran herds over cliffs, and deliberately preyed on the young female animals. By about 6,000 years ago, all these pressures resulted in the extinction of the mammoths, giant bisons, horses, camels, and giant armadillos, leaving the American buffalos and the members of the deer family as the largest animals in North America. Long droughts continued on and off for the next few thousand years, killing off the big animals and periodically driving the American buffalo north out of the Texas plains.18 The disappearance of the large animals forced the Paleoindians to diversify their economy, making them more dependent on foraging and smaller game. In turn, this brought about a flourishing of ancient Native American culture. Anthropologists call this the Archaic Period, in which a rather common hunter-gatherer culture could be seen across the United States. Nonetheless, regions developed certain distinctions based on geography and climate. East of the ninety-fifth meridian, where lush forests grew and deep rivers ran, the peoples of East Texas had access to a wider variety of foods and materials and so developed a denser population than the Western Archaic, or Desert Culture, peoples of Central and West Texas.19\n\nArchaic Indians (ca. 8,000 B.P.–ca. A.D. 800) The Archaic Period covered thousands of years. It was so long that archaeologists divide it into early, middle, and late periods, during which time culture changed gradually but dramatically. Now early Indians became true hunter-gatherers, and their diets diversified accordingly. They tended to stay in one place longer, seasonally cycling through a distinct territory. Men hunted the smaller animals that proliferated as the ice age came to an end. Where a band lived determined much of what they ate. Cultures near\n\n10\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nthe coast took fish, shellfish, and water birds, often creating mounds of discarded oyster shells. In East and South Texas, Archaic peoples hunted deer, rabbits, turkeys, raccoons, even mice and snakes. Plains bands still relied heavily on buffalo, often making long autumn and winter hunts complete with butchering camps. But buffalo could not always be relied upon, as a very bad drought hit Texas about seven thousand years ago and lasted on and off for three thousand years.20 During the Archaic Period, women became ever more important to the band’s economy. Women gathered seeds, roots, nuts, berries, insects, and shellfish, and snared small game, which provided most of the food eaten by Archaic Indians. Among the plants women gathered were wild grapes and plums, a variety of berries, even wild onions and turnips. Using mortar holes cut in rock, women ground to a pulp such plants as agave, mesquite beans, prickly pear tunas, persimmons, acorns, walnuts, hackberries, and huajillo beans. Women and girls gathered firewood and lined campfires with rocks to help conserve heat. They used rock ovens to bake roots and cacti.21 To exploit these new resources, Archaic Indians brought about amazing technological innovations. Though still limited mainly to stone, shell, bone, and wood, the number and variety of new tools was truly astounding. Rather than just thrusting spears, Archaic men now used spear throwers, which provided greater leverage and velocity. Along with special darts, these spear-throwers—atlatls anthropologists call them— could bring down deer and buffalo. Other hunting improvements included bolos for taking birds; flat, curved throwing sticks for killing rabbits; snares for mice, squirrels, raccoons, coyotes, and foxes; and an assortment of hooks, nets, and tackle for fishing. Archaic peoples used stone in many more ways, as well. In addition to projectile points, flint knappers made axes, knives, scrapers, wedges, manos and metates, spear-thrower weights, and drills. From bone, ivory, or shells they made awls, pressure flakers, needles, beads, and pendants. Women twisted sotol or olechuguilla fibers into ropes, twine, sandals, mats, nets, and above all, baskets, and they sewed animal hides into a variety of clothes and bags.22 Along with these technological innovations and the increased, surer supply of food came a population explosion. Archaic sites, much more numerous than those of Paleoindians, have been found throughout Texas, including the lower Pecos River and Rio Grande valleys, the Hill Country, the high plains of the Llano Estacado and Panhandle, and the forests of East Texas. Like Paleoindians, the Archaic peoples lived in small family bands, though now the size of bands were getting larger and larger.\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n11\n\nArchaic Indians still made their homes in caves and rock shelters, though some built small huts of brush and mud.23 Most of the year, bands remained isolated in their own territory. To move into another band’s territory without permission could bring violence. On the other hand, some bands were related to others or alliances might be formed. Periodically bands joined each other for a rabbit hunt, a prickly pear harvest, or a shellfish gathering. During these joint ventures, bands shared technology, news, and ideas, but more importantly, men and women from different bands courted and married. After the event was over, the bands returned to their own territory with their brides who brought new ideas and skills with them. And with more food, these women produced more children than Paleoindians ever had.24 Neither Paleoindian nor Archaic Indians suffered epidemic-type diseases such as measles, cholera, diphtheria, mumps, or smallpox. Bands were just too small and too isolated for epidemics to occur. This did not mean people had no aches and pains. Evidence indicates that tuberculosis stalked these early Americans, and they may have had an early form of syphilis, though debate on that continues to this day. They also may have been bedeviled by parasites, such as hookworms and flatworms, and by parasitic ailments, such as trichinosis and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever. Skin ailments such as ringworm may have been common. Besides illnesses, Archaic Indians, like all active people, suffered fractures, sprains, twists, cuts, scrapes, ruptures, and tears. Sometimes these became so severe that a person might lose the use of an arm, a leg, or an eye. Since forty years of age was considered old, cancer and heart disease, usually associated with old age, may not have been the scourge they are today.25 Probably one of the worst things for Archaic people in Texas was tooth decay. As plant foods became an increasing part of their diet, particularly such sticky, sweet foods as the prickly pear cactus, Indians began to get cavities and rotten teeth. Heavy wear inflamed teeth and brought on painful abscesses. While some teeth might rot out, it would not have been uncommon for many people of the Texas Archaic culture to live with constant toothache.26 Still, it was not a bad time to be alive. With a more diverse food supply, feeding the band became easier and surer. Archaic people did not need as much time to fulfill their needs, and they used their new leisure time to develop specialized talents and attributes. While all people in the band were involved in providing food, some now devoted themselves to making better points or beads or tools. Others became masters of basket weaving and hide work. And sometimes, when the work was done and friends and\n\n12\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nfamily gathered around the fire, pieces of carved, painted bones might be tossed, as games of chance began.27 Some bands found they could acquire more things through trade than from their own hands. While exchange, particularly as gift-giving between kinspeople, had long been part of the lives of these early Indians, the first stirrings of actual trade came about during the Archaic period. People realized that their area might be rich in some resources, say in bison, and poor in others, such as flint, and they began to go beyond just gift-giving. As folks from different bands met in the forests, prairies, and plains of Texas, they began to exchange goods. This was probably not large-scale trade at first, but it laid the foundation for extensive trade and information networks that eventually spanned Texas and incorporated all the peoples of the Southern Plains and its margins.28 Archaic people tried to learn all they could of the world about them. Savvy hunters studied the animals, and as their hunting successes grew, so did their status. This allowed the hunter to exert some measure of authority in the ever-enlarging band. He was not yet a “chief,” but he could be considered something of a headman or band leader. Other men and women turned their attention to learning about plants: which were harmful, which could be eaten, and which had medicinal properties, especially those, such as prickly ash, which could dull a toothache. At some point, healers who worked with plants began to believe there was a close relationship between their medicinal and spiritual properties.29 Even the earliest Paleoindians seemed to have a sense of spirits and deities, as demonstrated by the shrine at Lake Theo. Through prayer and ritual, these deities could be appealed to, maybe even manipulated. If no bison were to be found, then the building of a simple shrine and an appeal to the “master of animals” might bring them. If so, then, of course, the deity would be thanked for the help. Archaic peoples built upon these religious beliefs. It probably did not take long before an herbalist connected healing an injury with manipulating spirits and deities. Healing a person came to consist of using not only plants but also rituals, chants, and prayer. And if he or she could soothe a toothache then it might be possible to use similar powers to bring rain, attract animals for the hunt, or even foretell the future. In Texas, rituals might incorporate mescal beans, peyote, toasted yaupon leaves, and tobacco. A religious cult centering on the mescal bean seems to have developed in Archaic South Texas. If successful in both the medicinal and spiritual realm, a priest-healer might gain tremendous power and become a “shaman.”30 This belief in a world filled with both helpful and malevolent gods and spirits who could be prodded and manipulated by prayer, chants, and ritu-\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n13\n\nals, infused all aspects of their lives. Since these early Indians relied mainly on animals for food, religion and ritual went hand in hand with hunting. On the lower Pecos River at Seminole Canyon in Val Verde County, Archaic peoples hunted white-tailed deer. However, the best deer hunters in the area were not human beings but cougars, which silently stalked their prey, chased it down, then crushed it with powerful jaws. Hoping to acquire these same characteristics, Indians on the lower Pecos created Cougar Societies in which hunters received instructions from this animal spirit. On rock shelters in the area, they painted huge pictographs in brilliant reds, deep blacks, and bright yellows of shamans, cougars, and of hunters throwing spears at running deer. These rock shelter pictographs and petroglyphs—pictures carved into rock rather than just painted—located near the confluence of the Pecos River and the Rio Grande are found at such places as Parida Cave, Seminole Canyon, Slick Trail Shelter, and Lewis Canyon. These paintings distinguish this area from most other Archaic sites in North America. While rock art, particularly that made at a later date, has been found in a few other places in West Texas, W. W. Newcomb, who studied these Southwest Texas pictographs, believed that “nowhere was this art form cultivated more assiduously or did it develop further than in the Lower Pecos River country.”31 How heavy religion weighed on the minds of the average Archaic individual is not known. Probably no more than it does on ours today, but they certainly accepted a world in which spirits, animals, and humans lived side by side. However, for the most part, life was not much different for thousands of years. Men hunted, made tools, and defended the band. Women gathered food, made household utensils, bore and reared children. Families were probably close and loving and they spent time and energy caring for the sick and feeble. When a person grew too old to fend for herself, members of her family and band provided food and nursed her injuries. When toothaches became so bad as to make it too painful to chew, then a loved one would pulverize the food, maybe even chew it for her first.32 And this world and the spirit world intertwined when loved ones laid their kinspeople to rest. As with Paleoindians, not many Archaic burials have been found, but the arid climate of Southwest Texas has preserved a few. Peoples of the Late Archaic period buried their dead in various ways: in the ground; under the floors of rock shelters; in small, rather inaccessible caves; in small niches in the walls of caves; under a carefully arranged pile of stones. And in some instances they cremated them. Small cemeteries containing scores, even hundreds, of burials have been found.33 Common to virtually all these burials was the loving care bestowed upon the dead. Bodies of adults and children, male and female alike were tenderly cared for. Stone dart points, beads made of shell, bone, and stone,\n\n14\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\neven baskets and other utensils might be placed inside their graves. One common form of Archaic burial in Southwest Texas was a “bundle burial.” An excellent example of this is the “Skiles mummy” found in a small rock shelter near the confluence of the Pecos River and the Rio Grande. This man was about forty years old when he died sometime around a.d. 700, an old man for that time. He stood five feet, seven inches; he was slender with a broad face, broad nose, and a mouth filled with rotted, abscessed teeth. He wore a shaggy mane of dark hair over his ears and cropped it at about midneck. When he died, his kinspeople dressed him in a rabbit-fur cape and hung a string of stone and bone beads around his neck. His body was then tightly bound into the fetal position. This human “bundle” was then wrapped in a deer hide, hair inside against the body, wrapped again in a series of woven fiber mats, then tied together by a very long length of hair rope. They buried him in a sitting position in the floor of the rock shelter.34 The care given to the dead shows a belief in an afterlife. That they were often buried in the floor of the rock shelter or the wall of a cave still used and occupied by their band indicates that Archaic peoples did not fear their dead, but rather loved and missed them and seemed to consider them still a part of the family. It must have been a sad parting when the family of the Skiles mummy said their good-byes to him and trudged off on their seasonal rounds, leaving his body under the floor of the rock shelter, its home for the next thousand-plus years.35 The Archaic Period in Texas slowly came to an end during the first thousand years a.d., though some Indians would enjoy a lifestyle similar to the Archaic well into the eighteenth century. A new technological innovation, the bow and arrow, made its way into Texas around a.d. 600 and by 900 it had replaced the spear thrower. The bow and arrow made men more efficient hunters, ensuring greater supplies of game, which in turn brought about a larger population. For people living in the forests and prairies east of the ninety-fifth meridian, the end of the Archaic and a change to the Woodland Period came a little quicker than to those peoples on the lower Texas coast, the Rio Grande, and the central and high plains.36\n\nWoodland Indians (ca. 100 B.C.–ca. A.D. 800) Just as the shift from big game hunting to hunting and gathering denoted the end of the Paleoindian period and the advent of the Archaic, the domestication of plants and animals marked the end of the Archaic and the rise of the Woodland Period. Essentially, a village way of life began, which included the use of the bow and arrow, the appearance of pottery, more permanent houses, the creation of earthen burial mounds in some places,\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n15\n\nand participation in long-distance trade networks. Exchange and trade may well have brought these other characteristics, or at least news of them, to the peoples of Texas. Northeast Texas seemed to be the place where many of these innovations first appeared in the state. The Tchefuncte culture arose in South Louisiana about 500 b.c. and lasted until about a.d. 200. Tchefuncte was the first Louisiana culture to use pottery in any great quantity and the first to domesticate crops, in this case squash and bottle gourds. One of the oldest pieces of pottery uncovered in Texas is a small Tchefuncte clay pot found near Marshall. Whether a Louisiana Indian brought this with him on a visit to Texas and left it, a Texas Indian carried it back with him from a visit to Louisiana, or a Texas potter merely copied something he or she saw is not known. Not many Tchefuncte potsherds have been found in Northeast Texas, and that they seem to be limited mainly to this area indicates trade rather than reproductions. This is bolstered by Marksville pottery, the culture that succeeded Tchefuncte in Louisiana, which also showed up in East Texas about a.d. 1. Then, by a.d. 500, East Texas Indians were making their own pottery, a rather plain type, held together and tempered with crushed bone. Some of this pottery eventually found its way into other regions of Texas.37 That Northeast Texas formed a link in a vast Woodlands trade network seems evident. While the Tchefuncte and Marksville cultures were creating beautiful pottery in Louisiana, other Woodland cultures were forming throughout the eastern part of the United States. One of these, the Adena, arose in the Ohio River Valley, and from about 500 b.c. to a.d. 500 exerted a tremendous influence on all the peoples then living in eastern America. Like most groups of the Woodland Period, but probably more so than others, the Adena lived in small villages of round, thatch-roofed houses. They planted gardens of squash, sunflowers, goosefoot, and sumpweed; baked pottery; built small burial mounds over their dead; and participated in long-distance trade. Then, about 200 b.c., a religious movement took hold among the Adena and spread to virtually all Woodland peoples of the eastern United States. Archaeologists refer to this as the Hopewell Complex.38 The Hopewell Complex, which lasted until about a.d. 500, was characterized by the honoring of the dead. Burial mounds became larger, but more important was the variety, amount, and beauty of items now interred with the dead. These exquisite grave goods, actually objets d’art often made from such exotic materials as beaten copper, became integral to this Hopewell “honored dead” religion. While the Adena area of southern Ohio may have been the religious center of the eastern United States, lesser regional centers certainly existed and all these were connected in a well-\n\n16\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nestablished trade network. Mica from North Carolina, copper from the Great Lakes, galena from Missouri, obsidian from the upper Rockies, flint from the Dakotas, and seashells from the Gulf Coast all made their to Adena towns by way of the trade networks. There, craftsmen and artists shaped these raw materials into copper birds and fish, stone platform pipes, beads, gorgets, celts, jewelry, and other works of art, and then often sent then back along the trails to the regional centers, there to be buried among their own dead.39 That Indians in Northeast Texas participated in the Hopewell Complex can be seen in a scattering of small burial mounds along the Angelina, Neches, Sabine, and Red Rivers. The Coral Snake Mound, which now sits beneath the waters of Toledo Bend Reservoir on the Texas-Louisiana border, was representative of this regional Hopewell Complex. About a.d. 1, give or take a hundred years or so, these people along the Sabine River dug a pit four feet deep and twenty feet wide. In it they placed a body, cremated it, covered it with dirt, then filled in the pit. The bones of other cremations were placed in the fill, which eventually created a mound about three feet high and fifty feet in diameter. Over the years, additional cremated remains were interred in the mound. Accompanying these were copper beads and ear spools, spear-thrower weights, and stone projectile points, along with some Marksville pottery from Louisiana. Similar remains and grave goods have been found at the other mounds in the area. This Hopewell Complex in Northeast Texas did not last long and did not spread to any other areas of Texas. Nevertheless, for awhile, some early Texas Indians found themselves part of a very cosmopolitan eastern United States and an important link in a long trade chain.40 Though late Archaic and Woodland Indians participated in a far-flung trade network, not all of their interactions with other people were peaceful. Raids, possibly even full offensive warfare, took place. In southern Oklahoma, skeletons dated to between a.d. 400 and 600 have been found with arrow points still embedded in their bones. And the types of flint used to make the points indicate that their attackers traveled several hundred miles to make the raid. Several skeletons have been found in Texas that show death came through injuries inflicted by other humans. What sparked these conflicts remains unclear. Possibly, as these people settled into one area, they clashed with others living at their territorial margins. An increase in raids may have helped bring about the rise of a powerful chiefdom political system. Villages most successful in defending themselves from raiders soon attracted other villages willing to put themselves under that chief’s protection.41 While pottery and warfare are rather easy to pinpoint, when the Indi-\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n17\n\nans of Texas began cultivating plants poses a thornier problem. The domestication of plants probably began in Northeast Texas before any other place in the state, but even then the plants the Indians cultivated were some of the same ones they had long foraged. By a.d. 700, women in Northeast Texas were tending small gardens of sunflowers, goosefoot, sumpweed, squash, little barley, and such. These only supplemented their diets. Not until about a.d. 900 did they take more food from farming than from foraging and hunting.42 Northeast Texas was an anomaly, as the rest of Texas lingered in the Archaic Period until about a.d. 1100. Pottery slowly spread throughout Texas during this time, with a thick, cord-marked style spreading west out of East Texas and a plain brown style spreading east out of New Mexico. Near the coast, a sandy paste pottery predominated for hundreds of years. Horticulture and village life took equally as long to spread. However, vast changes were on the way as the Indians of Texas diverged between huntergatherers living on the coast, the plains, and in the south, and farmers in the east. The coming of corn horticulture would truly revolutionize many of the Indian cultures of Texas.43\n\nAn Agricultural Revolution Over the years, some of these early domesticated plants, such as sumpweed, goosefoot, and sunflowers fell out of use or became of only marginal significance. Others, such as bottle gourds and squash, steadily gained in importance. Indians turned bottle gourds into dippers and spoons, but also waterproof containers, which were lighter and sturdier than pottery. Summer squash added a prolific and delicious food to their larders. Then, two new foods—corn and beans—made their way into Texas. A tropical flint corn had been used by American Woodland peoples from about 200 b.c. to a.d. 400 but had disappeared as the weather cooled over the next few centuries. A new variety of corn, along with beans, made their appearance in Texas about a.d. 700, maybe even a bit earlier. However it would take several hundred more years before these would make a truly significant impact.44 Corn was first domesticated in Mexico almost six thousand years ago. Beans followed a couple millennia later. But not until about 2000 b.c. did Mesoamerican farmers make any significant use of either. Tropical flint corn made its way into the area north of Mexico but died out about a.d. 400. Around 300 b.c., its hardier successor, maiz de ocho, a small eightrowed flour corn, began to be grown by the early Puebloan peoples who would come to occupy northern Mexico, New Mexico, Arizona, and far\n\n18\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nWest Texas. It was maiz de ocho that crossed the plains and arrived in Northeast Texas around a.d. 700. Beans followed a few hundred years later. When corn first arrived in North America is still debated by scholars, but not until about a.d. 900 did it become an important food to the people living along the Sabine, Angelina, Neches, Trinity, and Red Rivers. However, by 1200, the “three sisters”—corn, beans, and squash, sometimes called the “American triad”—were the lifeblood of the peoples of Northeast Texas. By 1500 virtually all Indian communities in Texas either grew corn or wished they could.45 Texas Indians did not suddenly drop their bows and arrows, pick up digging sticks, and begin farming corn, beans, and squash. It was a long, slow process. They had been gradually cultivating plants over the last thousand years, and initially corn was just another one of these domesticated weeds. But as Indian women planted seeds from only the most robust and healthiest plants, maize got bigger and produced larger yields. Nevertheless, by the mid-1500s, even when a village might be surrounded by thousands of acres of corn, women still added a variety of roots, berries, nuts, and seeds to their family’s diet, while men continued tramping the forests hunting deer. That said, women began spending more and more time in their gardens, planting, tending, and harvesting. By the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, probably even earlier, horticulture was providing more food to the Indians of some parts of Texas, particularly in the northeast, than did hunting. As corn slowly improved, so did beans, and Indian women grew a wide variety of them, including pole beans, pintos, snaps, navys, and kidneys. They also developed an ingenious method of planting. A woman would pile up a small mound of dirt, just a few inches high. In it, she planted a few kernels of corn. Once the corn sprouted, she then planted beans and squash. As the corn grew tall, the beans used the cornstalk as a pole, while the spreading squash covered the mound, keeping down weeds and erosion. It was truly a fortuitous match. Corn, by itself, is hard to digest, but adding beans, which are high in lysine acid, allows for the efficient digestion of corn proteins. Also, where corn depletes the nutrients from the soil, beans, rich in nitrogen, replace them.46 At first, farming would have been done on any naturally clear and well-watered land, but as Northeast Texas Indians increased their production, men found they had to clear land using controlled burning to get rid of underbrush and open up the forest canopy. Men “girdled trees,” meaning they scraped off one or two feet of the bark all the way around the tree. This killed the trees and when they were dead the men piled logs against them and set them on fire. Women then planted their fields amid the black-\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n19\n\nened stumps. The resulting ash, rich in potash, was mixed in as fertilizer. The fields and new grass that sprouted also attracted deer, a boon to the hunter.47 Now agriculture brought an incredible influence to the village’s women. Foraging had always been part of the woman’s world, and so agriculture, originally an adjunct to foraging, also became part of their domain. While men might clear the land and turn the soil, women planted the seeds, watered the shoots, weeded the mounds, shooed away crows and deer, then gathered the harvest. Women controlled the fields, and as agriculture swelled in importance, so did women’s status. For those cultures, such as the Caddos in East Texas, that came to rely mainly on agriculture, their whole society began tilting toward women. People began to trace their descent through their mothers, rather than through their fathers as most hunter-gatherers did.48 This is not to say that women took control of agricultural societies. Though women might sometimes attend a council meeting, women were usually excluded from political power, as men controlled most leadership and political positions. But a few women did become chiefs. And when most of the men were out hunting or raiding, it fell to the women to take care of the daily affairs of the village. For the most part, women wielded influence rather than actual power and usually worked behind the scenes to get what they wanted. Among most Texas Indian societies, women manipulated political power by demanding war or insisting on peace. When enemy captives were taken, the women normally decided who would be tortured to death and who would be spared and enslaved or adopted. Women descended from leadership families or married to important men wielded a good deal of influence. And a wife’s pillow talk often swayed her husband’s mind in one direction or another.49 Women also played important roles in the religious life of most societies. They were essential to almost every ceremony, no matter whether they were hunter-gatherers or agriculturalists. In fact, some dances could only be initiated, even performed by women, such as the Turkey Dance, the Caddo’s national dance. Men readily acknowledged the spiritual power of women. In most societies, during their menstrual period, women physically separated themselves from the community, often living apart from their families and with other women also then having their period. They were forbidden to cook food or even bathe upstream from the community. This was done not because a menstruating woman was considered unclean but because during her menses a woman was most spiritually powerful. And her power was so strong it could overshadow the normal daily prayers, rituals, and ceremonies. While physical separation\n\n20\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nmight seem harsh, in reality it could be a nice weeklong break each month from the husband, the children, and the drudgery of camp life, with time to spend with other female friends. So while women may not have held the reins of political power, they certainly wielded tremendous influence.50 As farming grew in importance, the question arises as to why these peoples of Texas adopted horticulture in the first place? Hunting and gathering takes much less work. A hunter-gatherer works about two days a week, while a farmer works five or six. So why would anyone choose to farm if they did not have to? One reason may be that the flush times of the Late Archaic and Woodland periods brought an explosion in population and diversity. Surer food supplies brought more children, lower infant mortality, and a longer life for elders. Now there were more mouths to feed, and one or two farmers could provide much more food than twice that number of hunters and gatherers. The Archaic and Woodland periods also allowed bands to splinter, move, and over time develop their own cultural and political identity, often tying them to a certain area. Hunters and foragers from different bands and villages met each other in the forests or prairies and fought over resources. The land itself, such as on the plains or in the deserts, may have limited the availability of some resources. Finding their mobility and access to certain foods restricted at a time they needed more and more food, people turned to horticulture.51 This increasing reliance on agriculture meant more than just a larger population and new food sources. As Indian peoples, particularly those of Northeast Texas, turned to agriculture they found their economies, beliefs, and whole way of life diverging from those Texas Indians who continued to rely mainly on hunting and gathering.\n\nMississippian Cultural Tradition (ca. A.D. 700–ca. 1550) As corn, beans, and squash spread throughout the eastern United States, economics, religion, trade, and politics all contributed to bring about the rise of the Mississippian cultural tradition. After 700, with surer food supplies, large populations coalesced along the major river systems, particularly the Mississippi and its tributaries. By 1200 large cities holding thousands of people, complete with houses, markets, plazas, earthen mounds, workshops, temples, and cemeteries, had arisen at Spiro, Oklahoma; Cahokia, Illinois; Moundville, Alabama; and Etowah, Georgia. At the same time, from Texas to North Carolina, Florida to Wisconsin, medium-size towns of several hundred people also grew up along smaller rivers and streams. These towns might also have ceremonial mounds, plazas, and temples. Around these towns, just a short distance away, clustered vil-\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n21\n\nlages, with hamlets branching off the villages, and farmsteads, the most isolated of all and consisting of only a family or two, surrounding a hamlet. In East Texas, between 750 and 1300 several medium-size towns and their attendant villages, hamlets, and farmsteads appeared along the Angelina, Neches, Trinity, and Red Rivers. The people of these cities, towns, and villages intensely cultivated corn and other plants, while the people of hamlets and farmsteads may have relied on foraged foods to a greater extent.52 While successful hunting usually depended on the skill of the hunter, agriculture required extra special abilities and interactions. Theoretically, in hunting, if animals were scarce, then the band could move to where the animals were. Agriculturalists could not just pick up their fields and move them. And as any farmer quickly realizes, it is not so much their skill that brings bountiful harvests but the cooperation of the natural elements. Indian farmers of the thirteenth-century American South understood that no matter how tenderly they cared for their crops, drought, floods, frosts, insects, or animals could destroy it all and thereby leave their people starving. The sun, the moon, the rain, the river, the wind, the earth, even the corn itself, all essential to bountiful harvests, had to be propitiated, manipulated, and enlisted for the people’s survival. Those individuals who could control the elements through prayer, magic, ritual, and ceremony wielded tremendous power and so were people to be reckoned with.53 After a.d. 700 a theocratic form of government arose among the corngrowing societies of the American Southeast, including Northeast Texas. Priests, rather than shamans, now performed the necessary rituals to ensure good crops. As as their prestige, status, and power increased, they became priest-chiefs, wielding religious and political power, governing their people, deciding on peace or war. Over the generations, the mystery and awe around them grew, and some priest-chiefs claimed their family possessed a direct kinship with the Sun or the Moon or some other deity. In turn, this affected the people’s social organization by creating a ranked society. The priest-chief and his family now sat at the top of the social pyramid. Other families in his lineage and members of other lineages closely connected to his were seen as nobles. People from lineages more distant became the mass of commoners, and as in Europe, there were many more commoners than nobles. These divisions might be most apparent and strictest in the major cities and larger towns and almost nonexistent in the hamlets and farmsteads. Still, regardless of whether class lines were obvious, throughout agricultural societies, some families seem to be singled out as producing leaders. These priest-chiefs tended to be men, but every so often a remarkable woman of skill and ability might rise up to lead her people.54\n\n22\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nAs the relationship between the priest-chief and the sun, the moon, the stars, and the rain solidified, placing the priest-chief physically closer to his celestial kinfolk became desirable. So people throughout the eastern part of the United States began building huge, earthen, flat-topped, temple mounds. In the major cities, these mounds usually reached anywhere from forty to fifty feet in height. In the many towns throughout the Southeast, they might be a more moderate fifteen to thirty feet high; others might be only a foot or two high and barely discernible from the land around them. But some, such as Monks Mound at Cahokia, Illinois, topped out at almost a hundred feet and took scores of years to build. Agricultural Indians not only built large temple mounds but also continued constructing burial mounds over their dead priest-chief and his kin and retainers. In other instances, they might bury important people under the floor of a temple or house. They would then burn the structure, cover the charred remnants with fresh dirt, and build a new temple or house atop the grave. Over the years, a large burial mound might grow. And in the burials Indian people placed breathtakingly beautiful pieces of pottery, jewelry, and sculpture made of clay, stone, shells, bone, and copper. Many of these pieces of art might have originally been made by someone hundreds of miles away and delivered over the trade routes that linked virtually every city and town in the American South, including those in Texas.55 The Mississippian cultural tradition reached its peak of sophistication and opulence during the late thirteenth and early fourteenth centuries as the veneration of these agricultural priest-chiefs reached its height. Shells, pieces of copper, and a variety of pottery, etched with figures of spiders, rattlesnakes, cougars, or human figures, passed along the trade routes, and acted like gospel tracts, pulling all peoples of the South into a religious movement archaeologists call the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex. However, by about 1350—earlier in some places, later in others—the cities began to decline. By 1400 Cahokia, which held thirty-five thousand people at its peak, had been abandoned. The great ceremonial center at Spiro, Oklahoma, was gone by 1450. Mound building throughout the South tapered off. Why this came about is vigorously debated. A dramatic climate change, which brought long droughts, seems to be the most likely reason. Or was it an increase in warfare among the various chiefdoms of the South? An invasion of other groups? A breakdown of exchange and trade relations? Maybe it was one of these, maybe all, or maybe something entirely different.56 Not all vestiges of the Mississippian cultural tradition disappeared. While the opulence of the Southeastern Ceremonial Complex and the great cities may have declined, the mid-sixteenth and seventeenth centuries still\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n23\n\nsaw many places in the American South, including Northeast Texas, with priest-chiefs, agriculturally oriented ceremonies, a ranked society, their people living in towns, villages, hamlets, and farmsteads, being fed by corn agriculture and participating in trade. But we are getting ahead of ourselves.57\n\nPueblo Cultural Tradition While the Mississippian cultural tradition was reaching prominence on the eastern side of the Southern Plains, so too were sophisticated cornbased cultures rising on the western side. These were the Pueblo peoples of the Rio Grande and the Pecos River of present-day New Mexico, and they would exert significant influence on the Indians of Texas. The Archaic Period, from 7,000 to 1,000 b.c., saw the growth of a large population in the rather arid regions of New Mexico, Arizona, and far West Texas. Archaeologists call this the Cochise culture. Like all Archaic peoples, they hunted and foraged for a variety of foods, such as deer, rabbits, birds, prairie dogs, yucca, juniper, and piñon, and used a wide assortment of tools. At some point, maybe around 1000 b.c., the people of the Cochise culture acquired corn from Mesoamerica. Just as it did with the later Mississippians, corn brought a population explosion and a cultural complexity to the Southwest. Out of the Archaic Cochise culture came the corn-growing Mogollon people of southern New Mexico, which in turn influenced the later Anasazis of northern New Mexico.58 By a.d. 500, the Mogollons along the Rio Grande were growing corn, beans, squash, tobacco, and cotton. But the arid climate made horticulture precarious, and the Mogollons, with their newly acquired bow and arrow, still depended heavily on hunting and gathering. Nonetheless they turned more and more toward horticulture, and to escape the climate extremes, the Mogollons began building partially underground pit houses, which kept them cool in summer and warm in winter. Their search for reliable water led some to Hueco Tanks near El Paso, where they built a small village of pit houses that lasted from 1150 to about 1350. Eventually, the Mogollons acquired a reputation as fantastic potters, creating beautiful clay pots and jars painted with their distinctive black-on-white designs. These ceramics became valuable trade items and found their way among the Indians of Texas. Though the Mogollons were some of the first to acquire corn and pottery in the Southwest, by about 1200 they found their culture absorbed by the expanding Anasazi to the north.59 The Anasazis of the upper reaches of the Rio Grande of northern New Mexico blossomed late, about 100 b.c., but their culture grew with\n\n24\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\namazing speed and sophistication. Like the Mogollons, the Anasazi grew corn, beans, and squash; wove baskets and sandals out of yucca, leaves, and vines; and lived in partially underground pit houses. Then about a.d. 750, the Anasazi moved aboveground and began building elaborate stone houses. This characteristic would eventually earn them the name Pueblo, in Spanish meaning both “town” and “people.” The pit house, abandoned as a living area, now became the kiva, the center of the town’s religious ceremonies.60 Between a.d. 900 and 1300, when the Mississippian cultural tradition was hitting its stride on the eastern side of the Plains, the Anasazi Pueblo culture was achieving its own golden age in the west. At places such as Chaco Canyon and Mesa Verde, the Anasazis built towns of huge multileveled apartment buildings. At Pueblo Bonito in Chaco Canyon, they built a five-story apartment building with eight hundred rooms, the largest living area in North America until the advent of the skyscraper in the late nineteenth century. The Anasazis became renowned for their bread made of corn, their beautiful pottery, turquoise jewelry, and clothing made of cotton and feathers. Some of these goods made their way into Texas by way of exchange, and Anasazi pottery and turquoise have been found scattered across the Southern Plains and into East Texas.61 Then, during the fourteenth century, at the same time the Mississippian cultural tradition declined in the east, the Anasazis began abandoning their large towns and villages. The same questions about the Mississippian decline are asked about the Anasazis. Drought? Warfare? Religious change? Internal conflict? Whatever the reason, within the course of a century, the great towns were abandoned and the Anasazi had scattered. Along the Rio Grande and the Pecos River they built smaller towns complete with manyroomed adobe mud houses surrounded by irrigated fields of corn. They also continued making distinctive pottery and turquoise jewelry, a tradition that lasts to this day. Though all of the same culture, these small, densely populated towns—pueblos—in northern New Mexico and Arizona became virtual nations in themselves. Language dialects proliferated and each pueblo directed its own politics and diplomacy.62 The Southern Plains proved a barrier to extensive Anasazi and Pueblo eastward expansion. In the Texas Panhandle, some Indians lived in stone slab houses that were influenced by the Pueblos. Other Puebloans migrated down the Rio Grande and formed clusters of hamlets and villages stretching from the Paso del Norte, where El Paso sits today, to a group of several large Puebloan-style towns at the juncture of the Rio Grande and the Conchos River, a place the Spaniards called La Junta de los Rios. Some Pueblo hunters from the Rio Grande and Pecos River towns doubtless mi-\n\nTEXAS’ EARLIEST PEOPLES\n\n25\n\ngrated to the plains to hunt buffalo. These Puebloans at La Junta and their cousins hunting buffalo on the Southern Plains may have been the ancestors of the sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Jumanos. But what makes the Pueblo cultures along the Pecos and Rio Grande especially important in Texas history is that their corn, blankets, pottery, jewelry, and ideas acted as magnets, attracting a variety of people to them: some to trade, some to raid, and some to conquer.63 In modern society, where some new technology arrives almost daily, a mere ten or twenty years bring vast changes. So one of the hardest things to grasp are these extraordinarily long periods of time where change and innovation seemed to crawl across the landscape. For thousands of years, Paleoindians hunted big game with thrusting spears tipped with flint points. Then for an even longer period of time, Archaic peoples hunted, fished, and foraged with a larger assortment of tools. A truly revolutionary innovation came with the production of pottery about a.d. 500. And some Indians in Texas would become master potters, creating works of art that would find their way throughout the southern half of the United States. But when compared to the technology of Europe of a.d. 1500, or even a.d. 500, the Indians of Texas lagged far behind. They did not possess an alphabet, and whereas Europeans had already gone through their Bronze and Iron Ages, the Texas Indians of a.d. 1500 still relied upon the same stone and bone that their Paleoindian ancestors had. Technology, though, is not the whole measure of a people. And the Indians of Texas underwent tremendous cultural and social changes over the millennia. Men and women learned the land and all it contained. They often migrated to other areas in order to better their conditions. They studied the habits of animals and the properties of plants. Some developed reputations as healers, and some felt they had found ways, through prayer and ritual, to influence the spirits who gave meaning to the universe. Texas Indians also interacted with others both inside and outside the region until a web of worn trails connected them to all areas of the continent. Of even greater importance was the coming of agriculture. To those people who came to rely on it, this new economy brought about a new religion, new relations between men and women, and a golden age of sophistication and power. By 1500 the Indian peoples of Texas, though they had developed distinct cultural characteristics that set them apart from each other, still had many things in common, no matter whether they were huntergatherers or agriculturalists.\n\nChapter 2\n\nThe Blossoming of Texas Cultures hen did any group of Indian people become a recognizable culture? When did the Caddo Indians of Northeast Texas actually come into being? How did the Tonkawas of Central Texas appear? At what point did the coastal Karankawas become Karankawas and the Rio Grande Coahuiltecans Coahuiltecans? Anthropologists and archaeologists would say this happened when the people developed a language, religion, belief systems, and above all, a sense of themselves as a special, distinct people. It might also include the style of pottery they made, how they adorned themselves, how they married, how they went about hundreds of daily activities, from cooking breakfast to the lullabies they sing their children. While dates are rather nebulous, between a.d. 900 and 1500, most, but not all, the Indians living in Texas had developed the distinct cultures that Europeans and Americans encountered and would write about. With this comes a word of warning. Archaeological digs can provide lots of information, particularly about the physical culture of a people: the tools they used, what they ate, how they designed their pottery, how they built their homes and laid out their villages. But archaeology cannot tell what the Indians of Texas called themselves, how they conducted their religious ceremonies, how they arranged marriages, why they did certain things, and what they felt was important and what was not. Not until\n\nW\n\n26\n\nT H E B L O S S O M I N G O F T E X A S C U LT U R E S\n\n27\n\nEuropeans arrived in Texas during the sixteenth century and recorded their interactions did these blank spaces begin to be filled in. Even here we must be careful, or at least be aware of several things. First, these Europeans, when they described the Indians they met, were taking a snapshot of them frozen in time. It does not show the changes Indian culture underwent previously, nor how it was to change in the future. Indian cultures were not static. The people migrated, united with other groups, and adopted outsiders. Communities might split apart, and through it all they constantly changed the way they did things. In fact, the word “ethnogenesis”—the creation of a people—is applicable, as most Indian peoples of Texas made and remade themselves over and over again. Second, reading only European accounts gives the false impression that the Indians of Texas had no history until Europeans arrived. Archaeologists refer to these centuries prior to the coming of Europeans as “prehistoric” or “pre-Columbian”—before Columbus. These are unfortunate terms as they give the impression that only when Europeans arrived did the Indians of Texas spring to life. In reality, Texas Indians had a long history that shaped the way they reacted to Europeans. The third point leads us to the question of how accurate these European observations were. Europeans had wholly different ways of looking at the universe, and they interpreted what they saw through the lenses of their own culture. They may have stressed things the Indians did not and overlooked what the Indians felt was important. Fortunately, anthropological models can help and suppositions can be made by studying similar peoples. Fourth, we must realize that the moment Columbus set foot in the Bahamas, the Indian societies of the Western Hemisphere began to undergo tremendous, rapid change. In many instances, long before Texas Indians ever saw a European, their cultures were already being affected by them. Some of this was change the Indians actively accepted and adopted; other times it was change forced upon them. So with the help of archaeology, anthropology, and history, we will try to lay a cultural baseline for these Indians of Texas, but with the understanding that Texas Indian cultures had been changing for thousands of years, were still changing, and were often affected by forces outside their region.\n\nTexas in 1500 By 1500 a variety of distinct Indian cultures had developed in Texas. Some, such as those in East Texas and along the middle reaches of the Rio Grande, depended heavily on corn horticulture but supplemented it with hunting\n\n28\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nand gathering. Others along the Gulf Coast and in far South Texas were mainly hunters and gatherers. They used corn little, if at all, maybe growing small gardens when they could. Still, at the beginning of the sixteenth century, Indians lived in virtually every part of Texas. Exactly how many is not certain. There is no reliable way to calculate the past populations of people who did not write, took no censuses, and kept no written records; so counts given by scholars have varied widely. Some merely added up the numbers given by the earliest Spanish and French explorers. This method is inaccurate and probably gives low numbers as the Europeans did not take exhaustive or systematic censuses and often merely guessed at populations. Also, from the moment Europeans set foot in Texas, Indian populations rapidly dwindled. Other scholars use a method called “carrying capacity,” meaning they calculate how many people lived in a certain area by how many people the land could support. This might give rather high figures, as just because the land could support a large number of people does not mean it actually did. Another method is to take the lowest population figures for a given region, then multiply it by a fixed number. Again, this may give us high counts in some areas and low counts in others. Years ago, when scholars tried to calculate the number of Indians living in the whole of North American, that is, the United States and Canada, they gave a figure somewhere between 1 and 2 million people. Now scholars believe North America held maybe 7 million, some say 9 million people, others say as many as 18 million, and some may go even higher than that. So when it comes to Texas in 1500, there may have been anywhere from 50,000 to several hundred thousand to maybe a million living there. The more agricultural eastern part of Texas, the coasts, and the Rio Grande Valley held the highest populations, while the plains and the deserts certainly held fewer. But Texas was not empty and a person could not travel far before they encountered Indians and often a considerable number of them.1 Let us take a snapshot of Texas Indians in 1500, listing the peoples and where they lived. The names by which we call them are certainly not what they called themselves, but were usually European misnomers. In the forests and prairies of Northeast Texas, along the Neches, Angelina, upper Sabine and Red Rivers, lived the Caddos, who were the most agricultural of all the Indians of Texas. Strongly influenced by the Mississippian cultural tradition, the Caddos had been mound builders and by 1500 lived in numerous towns and villages scattered across Northeast Texas, Northwest Louisiana, Southwest Arkansas, and Southeast Oklahoma. They were governed by powerful priest-chiefs.2 South of them, in the dense forests of Southeast Texas and Southwest\n\nT H E B L O S S O M I N G O F T E X A S C U LT U R E S\n\n29\n\nLouisiana, along the slow-moving Sabine, San Jacinto, and Trinity Rivers and around the eastern part of Galveston Bay, lived the Atakapas. While the Atakapas may have planted a few small gardens, they relied mainly on hunting and gathering, stalking deer and other animals, but also taking advantage of what the rivers and the Gulf Coast offered.3 Southwest of the Atakapas, along the central Texas coast, stretching from the western part of Galveston Bay to Corpus Christi Bay, lived the Karankawas. Using their dugout canoes, the Karankawas fished the Gulf estuaries, bays, and the rivers emptying into it. They also hunted deer, bear, and other animals on the barrier islands and on the grassy coastal prairies. The women dug roots and harvested berries, nuts, and others plants among the coastal marshes and forests.4 North of the Karankawas, in Central Texas, between the Brazos and the San Antonio Rivers lived numerous small autonomous bands and villages. These groups, bearing such European recorded names, as Tohaha, Ebahamo, and Spichehat, to name just a few, would eventually merge with other Indian bands coming from the north and south to form the Tonkawas. While the Tonkawas planted some small gardens of corn, they relied to a much greater extent on hunting buffalo and deer.5 Southwest of the Tonkawas and Karankawas lived a huge scattering of Coahuiltecans. Stretching across South Texas and northern Mexico, inland from the coast and as far north as the Nueces River, the Coahuiltecans lived in numerous, small, autonomous bands. Because of the rough, arid landscape they depended heavily on hunting and gathering, but there were not enough animals to feed large populations. So while some Coahuiltecans might have planted a garden of corn along a sure water source, they relied much more on gathering cacti, mesquite beans, various nuts, plants, and roots for their sustenance.6 Up the Rio Grande, northwest of the Coahuiltecans, lived the Jumanos. Originally a Pueblo people who had migrated southeast, by 1500 they had divided between those who farmed and those who hunted and gathered. Farming Jumanos lived in large towns composed of flat-roofed adobe homes and tended enormous fields of corn, beans, and squash. These towns lay scattered along the Rio Grande from its confluence with the Conchos River all the way to where El Paso sits today. Other bands of Jumanos roamed between the Rio Grande and the Pecos River hunting buffalo.7 Far north of the Coahuiltecans and Karankawas and northwest of the Caddos, on the eastern margins of the Southern Plains, along the uppermost reaches of the Colorado, Brazos, Red, and Trinity Rivers and stretching as far north as the Arkansas River in Oklahoma and Kansas, were the\n\n30\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nMap 1. Indians of Texas, ca. 1500.\n\nWichitas. The Wichitas lived in large permanent villages where they grew enormous quantities of corn, but they also hunted buffalos on the plains. In 1500 the most southwesterly of the Wichitas were the Yscanis in the Texas Panhandle, who were early on known as the Teyas. Out on the streams and rivers of the Panhandle, these Plains Wichitas lived in much smaller villages than did their more northerly cousins. In the late 1600s the Kansas and Oklahoma Wichitas began a migration south into Texas. By the mid-eighteenth century they would have villages ranging from Waco north to the Wichita Mountains in Oklahoma. Many of the Yscani Wichitas would eventually join with their southward-migrating kinspeople, but some would be absorbed by other cultures also moving into Texas.8 By 1500 the Plains Wichitas and the Pueblos to their west were already facing pressure from Athapaskans streaming down the west side of the Great Plains from Canada. Some of these Athapaskans would move west and become the Navajos. Others would continue south to the rugged mountains of southern New Mexico and Arizona to become the Apaches of Geronimo fame. A third group remained on the Southern Plains of Texas and came to be called Lipans or Plains Apaches. A fourth, the Kiowa-\n\nT H E B L O S S O M I N G O F T E X A S C U LT U R E S\n\n31\n\nApaches, would arrive in Texas much later. These early Apaches hunted buffalo afoot and developed a complex set of relations with the Pueblos to their west. As the Apaches expanded onto the Texas plains, they began to absorb small communities of Plains Wichitas and Coahuiltecans.9 Three Indian peoples who have come to be most associated with Texas—Comanches, Kiowas, and Kiowa-Apaches—did not live in Texas in 1500. Another two to three hundred years would pass and several major developments occur before these powerful horse-mounted huntergatherers would make their way onto the Southern Plains that they would claim as their own. The influx of Indians into Texas did not stop there. The late seventeenth century saw the Pueblo Tiguas migrate south to their present-day homes at El Paso, and during the nineteenth century bands of wholly different Indians, mainly from the eastern part of the United States, made their way into Texas. Bands of Cherokees, Chickasaws, Choctaws, Creeks, Alabamas, Coushattas, Seminoles, Kickapoos, Delawares, and Shawnees all briefly called Texas home and some still do. All these peoples existed as separate cultures. They had their own identity, spoke their own language or dialect, had their own deities, rituals, clans, and families. Nevertheless, people are flexible, sometimes consciously adopting another group’s culture. Other times cultural change may come slowly and unconsciously. In the span of a single person’s life, certainly over one or two generations, a person, or even a whole band or village, might move from one type of existence and embrace something entirely new. Panhandle Wichitas often found themselves absorbed by Apaches. So while we can talk of cultural differences, it is also correct to talk of cultural similarities. Naturally, some groups may have had much in common. Wichitas, Caddos, and to a degree, the Atakapas, certainly possessed similar agricultural societies. Lipans, Coahuiltecans, and Tonkawas had comparable hunter-gatherer cultures. Coastal Karankawas and Atakapas were not all that different economically. Nevertheless, what really shaped Indian societies was how they made their living—through farming or through hunting and gathering.\n\nSocieties and Descent Systems Essentially all the Indians of Texas could be divided into those who lived primarily by farming and those who lived mainly by hunting and gathering. Farmers usually lived in grass or adobe houses in villages and stayed tied to one place for long periods of time. Hunter-gatherers migrated with their food sources, living in camps of hide-covered shelters. Some of these\n\n32\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\nmight be the classic conical-shaped tepees, others just a hide stretched over a few bent branches. Farmers tended to have more earth-based and crop deities, such as the Corn Mother, while hunter-gatherers had more animal deities, such as the Tonkawa’s Great Wolf. Farming tended to create larger populations and therefore, one would think, more powerful nations, while hunter-gatherers normally had smaller populations. However, diseases hit settled populations harder. And the coming of Spanish horses to Texas during the seventeenth century added a new dynamic to Indian cultures and helped create potent horse-mounted buffalo-hunting societies. Whether one was a hunter-gatherer or a farmer also shaped how one acted in society and even whom one considered as relatives. Huntergatherers tended to live in small bands, often migrating over a huge territory. Though women provided a large measure of food through foraging, hunter-gatherers depended heavily on meat, and since men did most of the hunting, it paid for fathers, sons, and brothers to hunt together. As they learned the terrain and the habits of the animals and as each hunter honed his own particular skills, these men formed an organized and efficient hunting team. Therefore, many hunter-gatherer societies were patrilocal, meaning that when it came time for a man to marry, he took a wife from outside his band and she moved in with his family. This way new blood came into the family while leaving the hunting team intact. Wives brought with them their own special skills in food, clothing, and tool preparation. Because of the importance placed on male hunters and since women married into a man’s family, most, but certainly not all, hunter-gatherer societies tended to be patrilineal, meaning that children traced their descent through their father and his family. They became members of their father’s clan, if their societies possessed clans, and might have only weak relations to their mother’s often-faraway family.10 Once agriculture eclipsed hunting among some Indian peoples and women provided more food than men, the rules of descent shifted toward women. Since women worked the fields, it profited mothers, daughters, and sisters to work together, forming a highly productive gang of farmers. The fields became part of the woman’s domain, and so did the household. With the fields providing most sustenance and the farm too productive to break up, agricultural societies tended to become matrilocal, meaning that when men married, they left their families and moved into the homes of their wives. Essentially “guests” in their wives’ homes, men had little say in the actual running of the household, which was dominated by a matriarch. Most, but not all, farming societies became matrilineal, meaning that children became members of their mother’s clan, were closely connected to the mother’s family, and had only tenuous connections with their father and his family.11\n\nT H E B L O S S O M I N G O F T E X A S C U LT U R E S\n\n33\n\nNo matter what type of descent system a child lived in, she was surrounded by loving, caring people, often with several generations living in the same tepee or house. She lived not only among her own brothers and sisters but also among a host of cousins, referring to all of them as “older brother” or “younger brother” and “older sister” or “younger sister.” In farming societies, her “aunts” might live in the same household, so she would refer to all her mother’s sisters as “mother.” Similarly, in a patrilineal household, her father was the most important male in her young life, but she would also call all her father’s brothers “father.” In matrilineal societies, the most important man in the child’s life would be “mother’s brother,” her maternal uncle, who would be of the same clan as her and her mother. Her father, who was from another clan and who often spent time with his own sister’s children, took on something of the role of an older brother or an uncle whose main job was to spoil, not discipline, the child. While this sounds complicated, children knew who their parents were and quickly learned the proper conduct among people older and younger than themselves.12\n\nSubsistence All Indian peoples of Texas, whether farmers or hunter-gatherers, divided labor various ways. At the most basic, a division existed between women and men. There were things women did and things men did and rarely did these lines cross. A second division was that between seniors and juniors. Older men and women held certain offices and had certain duties and privileges that were not available to younger men and women. A division also existed between people with more prestige and status and those with less. Some men and women, whether through their own abilities, their family’s reputation and connections, or the wealth they controlled, possessed a high degree of status, rank, and esteem. The more status one had, the more power one could wield. So all people thirsted for status, which usually only came through practicing the cardinal virtues of bravery, fortitude, generosity, and wisdom, though connections to a prestigious family might give one a leg up. Normally, though, acquiring prestige and power took a long time. So older men and women possessed it, while younger men and women strove to acquire it.13\n\nThe World of Women Regardless of whether a woman lived among agriculturalists or huntergatherers, her world revolved around hearth and home. In all early Texas Indian societies and on any given day, women spent much of their time\n\n34\n\nTHE TEXAS INDIANS\n\ngathering. They gathered firewood; clay for making pottery; cane, grass, or straw for weaving baskets and mats. They collected foods such as nuts, berries, roots, seeds, prickly pear tunas, grasses, whatever was in season. Much of this food was dried and stored. If her people were farmers, then during the warm growing season, she tilled the fields with digging sticks or hoes made of walnut or buffalo shoulder blades and then planted the seeds. Once the corn and beans were high enough, she watched over them, often building small platforms where she sat to scare off birds, deer, and other hungry pests. When the corn was ripe, she and her sisters and daughters harvested their household’s gardens and fields, often getting two crops of corn each season, and then stored it in baskets or on lines to dry. At home she scraped the dried corn off the cob, making it either into hominy for soups "
