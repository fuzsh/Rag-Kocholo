It is intended that this material shall appear from time to time in a series of papers which, when finally brought togetJier, shall constitute a monograph upon the Cherokee Indians. This paper may be considered the first of the series, all that has hitherto appeared being a short' paper upon the sacred formulas of the tribe, published in the Seventh Annual Report of the Bureau in 1891 and containing a synopsis of the Cherokee medico-religious theory, with twenty-eight specimens selected from a body of about six hundred ritual formulas written down in the Cherokee language and alphabet by former doctors of the tribe and constituting altogether the largest body of aboriginal American literature in existence. Although the Cherokee are probably the largest and most impor- tant tribe in the United States, having their own national government and numbering at any time in their history from 20,000 to 36,000 per- sons, almost nothing has yet been written of their history or general ethnology, as compared with the literature of such northern tribes as the Delawares, the Iroquois, or the Ojibwa. The difference is due to historical reasons ^hich need not be discussed here. It might seem at first thought that the Cherokee, with their civi- lized code of laws, their national press, their schools and seminaries, are so far advanced along the white man's road as to offer but little inducement for ethnologic study. This is largely true of those in the Indian Territory, with whom the enforced deportation, two generations ago, from accustomed scenes and surroundings did more at a single stroke to obliterate Indian ideas than could have been accomplished 11 12 MYTHS OF THE CHEKOKEE [eth.ann.19 by fifty years of slow development. There remained behind, however, in the heart of the Carolina mountains, a considerable body, outnum- bering today such well-known western tribes as the Omaha, Pawnee, Comanche, and Kiowa, and it is among these, the old conservative Kitu'hwa element, that the ancient things have been preserved. Moun- taineers guard well the past, and in the secluded forests of Nantahala and Oconaluf tee, far away from the main-traveled road of modern progress, the Cherokee priest still treasures the legends and repeats the mystic rituals handed down from his ancestors. There is change indeed in dress and outward seeming, but the heart of the Indian is still his own. For this and other reasons much the greater portion of the material herein contained has been procured among the East Cherokee living upon the Qualla reservation in western North Carolina and in various djgtached settlements between the reservation and the Tennessee line. This has been supplemented with information obtained in-the Cherokee Nation in Indian Territory, chiefly from old men and women who had emigrated from what is now Tennessee and Georgia, and who consequently had a better local knowledge of these sections, as well as of the history of the western Nation, than is possessed by their kindred in Carolina. The historical matter and the parallels are, of course, collated chiefly from printed sources, but the myths proper. With but few exceptions, are from original investigation. The historical sketch must be understood as distinctly a sketch, not a detailed narrative, for which there is not space in the present paper. The Cherokee have made deep impress upon the history of the southern states, and no more has been attempted here than to give the leading facts in connected sequence. As the history of the Nation after the removal to the West and the reorganization in Indian Territory pre- sents but few points of ethnologic interest, it has been but briefly treated. On the other hand the affairs of the eastern band have been discussed at some length, for the reason that so little concerning this remnant is to be found in print. One of the chief purposes of ethnologic study is to trace the, development of human thought under varying conditions of race and environment, the result showing always that primitive man is essen- tially the same in every part of the world. With this object in view a considerable space has been devoted to parallels drawn almost entirely from Indian tribes of the United States and British America. For the southern countries there is but little trustworthy material, and to extend the inquiry to the eastern continent and the islands of the sea would be to invite an endless task.

Their principal towns were upon the headwaters of the Savannah, Hiwassee, and Tuckasegee, and along the whole length of the Little Tennessee to its junction with the main stream. ItsSti, or Echota, on the south bank of the Little Tennessee, a few miles above the mouth of Tellico river, in Tennessee, was commonly considered the capital of the Nation. As the advancing whites pressed upon them from the east and northeast the more exposed towns were destroyed or abandoned and new settlements were formed lower down the Tennessee and on the upper branches of the Chattahoochee and the Coosa. As is always the case with tribal geography, there were no fixed boundaries, and on every side the Cherokee frontiers were contested by rival claimants. In Virginia, there is reason to believe, the tribe was held in check in early days by the Powhatan and the Monacan. On the east and southeast the Tuscarora and Catawba were their invet- erate enemies, with hardly even a momentary truce within the historic period; and evidence goes to show that the Sara or Cheraw were fully as hostile. On the south there was hereditary war with the Creeks,, who claimed nearly the whole of upper Georgia as theirs by original possession, but who were being gradually pressed down toward the Gulf until, through the mediation of the United States, a treaty was finally made fixing the boundary between the two tribes along a line running about due west from the mouth of Broad river on the Savan- nah. Toward the west, the Chickasaw on the lower Tennessee and the Shawano on the Cumberland repeatedly turned back the tide of Chero- kee invasion from the rich central valleys, while the powerful Iroquois in the far north set up an almost unchallenged claim of paramount lordship from the Ottawa river of Canada southward at least to the Kentucky river. 14 X BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY Scale 100 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT PL, II JULIUS 8 1 EN a CO, LITH N y MOONEY] TRIBAL NAMES 15 On the other hand, by their defeat of. the Creeks and expulsion of the Shawano, the Cherokee made good the claim which they asserted to all the lands from^ upper Greorgia, to the Ohio river, including the rich hunting grounds of Kentucky. Holding as they did the great mountain barrier between the English settlements on the coast and the French or Spanish garrisons along the Mississippi and the Ohio, their geographic position, no less than their superior number, would have given them the balance of power in the South but for a looseness of tribal organization in striking contrast to the compactness of the Iro- quois league, by which for more than a century the French power was held in check in the north. The English, indeed, found it con- venient to recognize certain chiefs as supreme in the tribe, but the only real attempt to weld the whole Cherokee Nation into a political unit was that made by the French agent, Priber, about 1736, which failed from its premature discovery by the English. We frequently find their kingdom divided against itself, their very number preventing unity of action, while still giving them an importance above that of neighboring tribes. The proper name by which the Cherokee call themselves (1)^ is Yun'wiya', or Ani'-Yun'wiya' in the third person, signifying \"real people,\" or \" principal people,\" a word closely related to Ofiwe-honwe, the name by which the cognate Iroquois know themselves. The word properly denotes \"Indians,\" as distinguished from people of other races, but in usage it is restricted to mean members of the Cherokee tribe, those of other tribes being designated as Creek, Catawba, etc., as the case may be. On ceremonial occasions they frequently speak of themselves as Ani'-Kitu'hwagi, or \"people of Kitu'hwa,\" an ancient settlement on Tuckasegee river and apparently the original nucleus of the tribe. Among the western Cherokee this name has been adopted by a secret society recruited from the full-blood element and pledged to resist the advances of the white man's civilization. Under the various forms of Cuttawa, Gattochwa, Kittuwa, etc. , as spelled by dif- ferent authors, it was also used by several northern Algonquian tribes as a synonym for Cherokee. Cherokee, the name by which they are commonly known, has no meaning in their own language, and iseems to be of foreign origin. As used among themselves the form is Tsa'lagi' or Tsa'ragi'. It first appears as Chalaque in the Portuguese narrative of De Soto's expedi- tion, published originally in 1557, while we find Cheraqui in a French document of 1699, and Cherokee as an English form as early, at least, as 1708. The name has thus an authentic history of 360 years. There is evidence that it is derived from the Choctaw word choluk or chiluk, signifying a pit or cave, and comes to us through the so-called Mobilian trade language, a corrupted Choctaw jargon formerly used as the 1 See the notes to the historical sketch. 16 MYTHS OF THE CHEROKEE [eth.ank.19 medium of communication among all the tribes of the Gulf states, as far north as the mouth of the Ohio (2). Within this area many of the tribes were commonly known uftder Choctaw names, even though of widely differing linguistic stocks, and if such a name existed for the Cherokee it must undoubtedly have been communicated to the first Spanish explorers by De Soto's interpreters. This theory is borne out by their Iroquois (Mohawk) name, Oyata'ge'ronon', as given by Hewitt, signifying \"inhabitants of the cave country,\" the Allegheny region being peculiarly a cave country, in which \"rock shelters,\" con- taining numerous traces of Indian occupancy, are of frequent occur- rence. Their Catawba name also, Manteran, as given by Gatschet, signifying \"coming out of the ground,\" seems to contain the same reference. Adair's attempt to connect the name Cherokee with their word for fire, atsila, is an error founded upon imperfect knowledge of the language. Among other synonyms for the tribe are Rickahockan, or Recna- hecrian, the ancient Powhatan name, and Tallige', or Tallige'wi, the ancient name used in the Walam Olum chronicle of the Lenape'. Con- cerning both the application and the etymology of this last name there has been much dispute, but there seems no reasonable doubt as to the identity of the people. Linguistically the Cherokee belong to the Iroquoian stock, the relationship having been suspected by Barton over a century ago, and by Gallatin and Hale at a later period, and definitely established by Hewitt in 1887.' While there can now be no question of the connec- tion, the marked lexical and grammatical differences indicate that the separation must have occurred at a very early period. As is usually the case with a large tribe occupying an extensive territory, the lan- guage is spoken in several dialects, the principal of which may, for want of other names, be conveniently designated as the Eastern, Middle, and Western. Adair's classification into \" Ayrate\" {i^laM), or low, and \"Ottare\" (d'taU), or mountainous, must be rejected as imperfect. The Eastern dialect, formerly often called the Lower Cherokee dialect, was originally spoken in all the towns upon the waters of the Keowee and Tugaloo, head-streams of Savannah river, in South Caro- lina and the adjacent portion of Georgia. Its chief peculiarity is a rolling r, which takes the place of the I of the other dialects. In this dialect the tribal name is Tsa'ragi', which the English settlers of Carolina corrupted to Cherokee, while the Spaniards, advancing from the south, became better familiar with the other form, which they wrote as Chalaque. Owing to their exposed frontier- position, adjoin- ing the white settlements of Carolina, the Cherokee of this division ' Barton, Benj. S., New Views on the Origin o£ the Tribes and Nations ol America, p. xlv, passim; Phila., 1797; Gallatin, Albert, Synopsis of Indian Tribes, Trans. American Antiquarian Society, ii, p. 91; Cambridge, 1836; Hewitt, J. N. B., The Cherokee an Iroquoian Language, Washington, 1887 (MS in the archives of the Bureau oX American Ethnology). MOONEYl DIALECTS BELATED TRIBES 17 were the first to feel the shock of war in the campaigns of 1760 and 1776, with the result that before the close of the Revolution they had been completely extirpated from their original territory and scattered as refugees among the more western towns of the tribe. The con- sequence was that they lost their distinctive dialect, which is now practically extinct. In 1888 it was spoken by but one man on the reservation in North Carolina. The Middle dialect, which might properly be designated the Kituhwa dialect, was originally spoken in the towns on the Tuckasegee and the headwaters of the Little Tennessee, in the very heart of the Cherokee country, and is still spoken by the great majority of those now living on the Qualla reservation. In some of its phonetic forms it agrees with the Eastern dialect, but resembles the Western in having the I sound. The Western dialect was spoken in most of the towns of east Ten- nessee and upper Georgia and upon Hiwassee and Cheowa rivers in North Carolina. It is the softest and most musical of all the dialects of this musical language, having a frequent liquid I and eliding many of the harsher consonants found in the other forms. It ia also the literarj'^ dialect, and is spoken by most of those now constituting the Cherokee Nation in the West. Scattered among the other Cherokee are individuals whose pronun- ciation and occasional peculiar terms for familiar objects give indica- tion of a fourth and perhaps a fifth dialect, which can not now be localized. It is possible that these differences may come from for- eign admixture, as of Natchez, Taskigi, or Shawano blood. There is some reason for believing that the people living on Nantahala river differed dialectically from their neighbors on either side (3). The Iroquoian stock, to which the Cherokee belong, had its chief home in the north, its tribes occupying a compact territory which comprised portions of Ontario, New York, Ohio, and Pennsylvania, and extended down the Susquehanna and Chesapeake bay almost to the latitude of Washington. Another body, including the Tuscarora, Nottoway, and perhaps also the Meherrin, occupied territory in north- eastern North Carolina and the adjacent portion of Virginia. The Cherokee themselves constituted the third and southernmost body. It is evident that tribes of common stock must at one time have occupied contiguous territories, and such we find to be the case in this instance. The Tuscarora and Meherrin, and presumably also the Nottoway, are known to have come from the north, while traditional and historical evidence concur in assigning to the Cherokee as their early home the region about the headwaters of the Ohio, immediately to the south- ward of their kinsmen, but bitter enemies, the Iroquois. The theory which brings the Cherokee from northern Iowa and the Iroquois from Manitoba is unworthy of serious consideration. (4) The most ancient tradition concerning the Cherokee appears to be 19 ETH— 01 2 18 MYTHS OF THE CHEROKEE [eth.ann.19 the Delaware tradition of the expulsion of the Talligewi from the north, as first noted by the missionary Heckewelder in 1819, and published more fully by Brinton in the Walam Olum in 1886. According to the first account, the Delawares, advancing from the west, found their further progress opposed by a powerful people called Alligewi or Tal- ligewi, occupying the country upon a river which Heckewelder thinks identical with the Mississippi, but which the sequel shows was more probably the upper Ohio. They were said to have regularly built earthen fortifications, in which they defended themselves so well that at last the Delawares were obliged to seek the assistance of the \"Mengwe,\" or Iroquois, with the result that after a warfare extending over many j^ears the Alligewi finallj\"^ received a crushing defeat, the survivor.s fleeing down the river and abandoning the country to the invaders, who thereupon parceled it out amongst themselves, the \"Mengwe\" choosing the portion about the Great lakes while the Dela- wares took possession of that to the south and east. The missionary adds that the Allegheny (and Ohio) river was still called by the Dela- wares the Alligewi Sipu, or river of the Alligewi. This would seem to indicate it as the true river of the tradition. He speaks also of remarkable earthworks seen by him in 1789 in the neighborhood of Lake Erie, which were said by the Indians to have been built by the extirpated tribe as defensive fortifications in the course of this war. Near two of these, in the vicinity of Sandusky, he was shown mounds under which it was said some hundreds of the slain Talligewi were buried.^ As is usual in such traditions, the Alligewi were said to have been of giant stature, far exceeding their conquerors in size. In the Walam Olum, which is, it is asserted, a metrical translation of an ancient hieroglyphic bark record discovered in 1820, the main tra- dition is given in practically the same way, with an appendix which follows the fortunes of the defeated tribe up to the beginning of the historic period, thus completing the chain of evidence. (5) In the Walam Olum also we find the Delawares advancing from the west or northwest until they come to \"Fish river\" — the same which Heckewelder makes the Mississippi (6). On the other side, we are told, \"The Talligewi possessed the East.\" The Delaware chief \"desired the eastern land,\" and some of his people go on, but are killed by the Talligewi. The Delawares decide upon war and call in the help of their northern friends, the \"Talamatan,\" i. e., the Wyan- dot and other allied Iroquoian tribes. A war ensues which continues through the terras of four successive chief s, when victory declares for the invaders, and \" all the Talega go south.\" The country is then divided, the Talamatan taking thq northern portion, while the Delawares \" stay south of the lakes.\" The chronicle proceeds to tell how, after eleven more chiefs have ruled, the Nanticoke and Shawano separate from the 1 Heckewelder, John, Indian Nations of Pennsylvania, pp. 47-49, ed. 1876. MOONEY] DELAWARE TRADITIONS — THE NAME TALLIGEWI 19 pai'ent tribe and remove to the south. Six other chiefs follow in suc- cession until we come to the seventh, who \" went to the Talega moun- \"tains.\" By this time the Dela wares have reached the ocean. Other chiefs succeed, after whom \"the Easterners and the Wolves\" — prob- ably the Mahican or Wappinger and the Munsee — move off to the northeast. At last, after six more chiefs, \"the whites came on the eastern sea,\" by which is probably meant the landing of the Dutch on Manhattan in 1609 (7). We may consider this a tally date, approxi- mating the beginning of the seventeenth century. Two more chiefs rule, and of the second we are told that \"He fought at the south; he fought in the land of the Talega and Koweta,\" and again the fourth chief after the coming of the whites \"went to the Talega.\" We have thus a traditional record of a war of conquest carried on against the Talligewi by four successive chiefs, and a succession of about twenty- five chiefs between the final expulsion of that tribe and the appearance of the whites, in which interval the Nanticoke, Shawano, Mahican, and Munsee branched off from the parent tribe of the Delawares. Without venturing to entangle ourselves in the devious maze of Indian chronology, it is sufficient to note that all this implies a very long period of time — so long, in fact, that during it several new tribes, each of which in time developed a distinct dialect, branch off from the main Lenape' stem. It is distinctly stated that all the Talega went south after their final defeat; and from later references we find that they took refuge in the mountain country in the neighborhood of the Koweta (the Creeks), and that Delaware war parties were still making raids upon both these tribes long after the first appearance of the whites. Although at first glance it might be thought that the name Tallige-wi is but a corruption of Tsalagi, a closer study leads to the opinion that it is a true Delaware word, in all probability connected with waloh or walok, signifying a cave or hole (Zeisberger), whence we find in the Walam Olum the word oligonunh rendered as \"at the place of caves.\" It would thus be an exact Delaware rendering of the same name, \"people of the cave countr}',\" by which, as we have seen, the Chero- kee were commonly known among the tribes. Whatever may be the origin of the name itself, there can be no reasonable doubt as to its application. \"Name, location, and legends combine to identify the Cherokees or Tsalaki with the Tallike; and this is as much evidence as we can expect to produce in such researches.\"\"^ The Wyandot confirm the Delaware story and fix the identification of the expelled tribe. According to their tradition, as narrated in 1802, the ancient fortifications in the Ohio valley had been erected in the course of a long war between themselves and the Cherokee, which resulted finally in the defeat of the latter.^ The traditions of the Cherokee, so far as they have been preserved, iBrinton, D.G., Walam Olum, p. 231; Phila., 1886. -Schoolcraft, H.

Owing to tte Cherokee predilection for new gods, contrasting strongly with the conservatism of the Iroquois, their ritual forms and national epics had fallen into decay even before the Revolution, as we learn from Adair. Some vestiges of their migration legend still existed in Hay- wood's time, but it is now completely forgotten both in the East and in the West. According to Haywood, who wrote in 1823 on information obtained directly from leading members of the tribe long before the Removal, the Cherokee formerly had a long migration legend, which was already lost, but which, within the memory of the mother of one informant — sa}\"^ about 1750 — was still recited by chosen orators on the occasion of the annual green-corn dance. This migration legend appears to have resembled that of the Delawares and the Creeks in beginning with genesis and the period of animal monsters, and thence following the shifting fortune of the chosen band to the historic period. The tradi- tion recited that they had originated in a land toward the rising sun, where they had been placed by the command of \"the four councils sent from above.\" In this pristine home were great snakes and water monsters, for which reason it was supposed to have been near the sea- coast, although the assumption is not a necessary corollary, as these are a feature of the mythology of all the eastern tribes. After this genesis period there began a slow migration, during which \"towns of people in many nights' encampment removed,\" but no details are given. From Heckewelder it appears that the expression, \"a night's encamp- ment,\" which occurs also in the Delaware migration legend, is an Indian figure of speech for a halt of one year at a place. ^ In another place Haywood says, although apparently confusing the chronologic order of events: \"One tradition which they have amongst them says they came from the west and exterminated the former inhabitants; and then says they came from the upper parts of the Ohio, where they erected the mounds on Grave creek, and that they removed thither from the country where Monticello (near Charlottes- ville, Virginia) is situated.\"^ The first reference is to the celebrated mounds on the Ohio near Moundsville, below Wheeling, West Virginia; the other is doubtless to a noted burial mound described by Jefferson in 1781 as then existing near his home, on the low grounds of Rivanna river opposite the site of an ancient Indian town. He himself had opened it and found it to contain perhaps a thousand disjointed skeletons of both adults and children, the bones piled in successive layers, those near the top being least decayed. They showed no signs 1 Heckewelder, Indian Nations, p. 47, ed. 1876. 2 Haywood, John, Natural and Aboriginal History of Tennessee, pp. 225-226; Nashville, 1823. MOONEY] EARLY DWELLING-PLACES 21 of violence, but were evidently the accumulation pt long years from the neighboring Indian town. The distinguished writer adds: \"But on whatever occasion they may have been made, they are of consider- able notoriety among the Indians: for a party passing, about thirty years ago [i. e., about 1750], through the part of the country where this barrow is, went through the woods directly to it without any instructions or enquiry, and having staid about it some time, with expressions which were construed to be those of sorrow, they returned to the high road, which they had left about half a dozen miles to pay this visit, and pursued their journey.'\" Although the tribe is not named, the Indians were probably Cherokee, as no other southern Indians were then accustomed to range in that section. As serving to corroborate this opinion we have the statement of a prominent Cher- okee chief, given to Schoolcraft in 1846, that acccording to their tradi- tion his people had formerly lived at the Peaks of Otter, in Virginia, a noted landmark of the Blue ridge, near the point where Staunton river breaks through the mountains.^ From a careful sifting of the evidence Haywood concludes that the authors of the most ancient remains in Tennessee had spread over that region from the south and southwest at a very early period, but that the later occupants, the Cherokee, had entered it from the north and northeast in comparatively recent times, overrunning and exterminat- ing the aborigines. He declares that the historical fact seems to be established that the Cherokee entered the country from Virginia, mak- ing temporary settlements upon New river and the upper Holston, until, under the continued hostile pressure from the north, they were again forced to remove farther to the south, fixing themselves upon the Little Tennessee, in what afterward became known as the middle towns. By a leading mixed blood of the tribe he was informed that they had made their first settlements within their modern home territory upon Nolichucky river, and that, hdving lived there for a long period, they could give no definite account of an earlier location. Echota, their capital and peace town, \" claimed to be the eldest brother in the nation,\" and the claim was generallj' acknowledged.^ In confirmation of the statement as to an earlj' occupancy of the upper Holston region, it may be noted that \"Watauga Old Fields,\" now Elizabethtown, were so called from the fact that when the first white settlement within the present state of Tennessee was begun there, so early as 1769, the bottom lands were found to contain graves and other numerous ancient remains of a former Indian town which tradition ascribed to the Cherokee, whose nearest settlements were then many miles to the southward. While the Cherokee claimed to have built the mounds on the upper 1 Jefferson, Thomas, Notes on Virginia, pp. 136-137; ed. Boston, 1802. 2 Schoolcraft, Notes on the Iroquois, p. 163, 1847. !

This accords with Bartram's statement that the Cherokee, although some- times utilizing the mounds as sites for their own town houses, were as ignorant as the whites of their origin or purpose, having only a gen- eral tradition that their forefathers had found them in much the same condition on first coming into the country.^ Although, as has been noted, Haywood expresses the opinion that the invading Cherokee had overrun and exterminated the earlier inhabitants, he says in another place, on halfbreed authority, that the newcomers found no Indians upon the waters of the Tennessee, with the exception of some Creeks living upon that river, near the mouth of the Hiwassee, the main body of that tribe being established upon and claiming all the streams to the southward.' There is considerable evidence that the Creeks preceded the Cherokee, and within the last century they still claimed the Tennessee, or at least the Tennessee watershed, for their northern boundary. There is a dim but persistent tradition of a strange white race pre- ceding the Cherokee, some of the stories even going so far as to locate their former settlements and to identify them as the authors of the ancient works found in the country. The earliest reference appears to be that of Barton in 1797, on the statement of a gentleman whom he quotes as a valuable authority upon the southern tribes. \"The Cheerake tell us, that when they first arrived in the country which they inhabit, they found it possessed by certain 'moon-eyed people,' who could not see in the day-time. These wretches they expelled.\" He seems to consider them an albino race.* Haywood, twentj'-six years later, says that the invading Cherokee found \"white people\" near the head of the Little Tennessee, with forts extending thence down the Tennessee as far as Chickamauga creek. He gives the location of three of these forts. The Cherokee made war against them and drove them to the mouth of Big Chickamauga creek, where they entered into a treaty and agreed to remove if permitted to depart in peace. Permission being granted, they abandoned the country. Else- where he speaks of this extirpated white race as having extended into Ilentucky and probably also into western Tennessee, according to the concurrent traditions of different tribes. He describes their houses, on what authority is not stated, as having been small circular structures 1 Haywood, Nat. and Aborig. Hist.

Harry Smith, a halfbreed born about 1815, father of the late chief of the East Cherokee, informed the author that when a boy he had been told by an old woman a tradition of a race of very small people, perfectly white, who once came and lived for some time on the site of the ancient mound on the northerji side of Hiwassee, at the mouth of Peachtree creek, a few miles above the present Murphy, North Caro- lina. They afterward removed to the West. Colonel Thomas, the white chief of the East Cherokee, born about the beginning of the century, had also heard a tradition of another race of people, who lived on Hiwassee, opposite the present Murphy, and warned the Cherokee that they must not attempt to cross over to the south side of the river or the great leech in the water would swallow theiu.^ They finally went west, \"long before the whites came.\" The two stories are plainly the same, although told independently and many miles apart. The Pebiod of Spanish Expi,oeation — 1640- ? The definite history of the Cherokee begins with the year 1540, at which date we find them already established, where they were always afterward known, in the mountains of Carolina and Georgia. The earliest Spanish adventurers failed to penetrate so far into the interior, and the first entry into their country was made by De Soto, advancing up the Savannah on his fruitless quest for gold, in May of that 3'ear. While at Cofitachiqui, an important Indian town on the lower Savannah governed by a \"queen,\" the Spaniards had found hatchets and other objects of copper, some of which was of finer color and appeared to be mixed with gold, although they had no means of testing it. ' On inquiry they were told that the metal had come from an interior mountain province called Chisca, but the country was represented as thinly peopled and the way as impassable for horses. Some time before, while advancing through eastern Georgia, they had heard also of a rich and plentiful province called Copa, toward the northwest, and by the people of Cofitachiqui they were now told that Chiaha, the nearest town of Coga province, was twelve days inland. As both men and animals were already nearly exhausted from hunger and hard travel, and the Indians either could not or would not furnish sufficient pro- vision for their needs, De Soto determined not to attempt the passage of the mountains then, but to push on at once to Copa, there to rest and recuperate before undertaking further exploration.

As the chief purpose of the expedition was the discovery of the mines, many of the officers regarded this change of plan as a mistake, and ifavored staying where they were until the new crop should be ripened, then to go directly into the mountains, but as the general was \"a stern man and of few words,\" none ventured to oppose his resolution/ The province of Copa was the territory of the Creek Indians, called Ani'-Kusa by the Cherokee, from Kusa, or Coosa, their ancient capital, while Chiaha was identical with Chehaw, one of the principal Creek towns on Chattahoochee river. Cofitachiqui may have been the capital of the Uchee Indians. The outrageous conduct of the Spaniards ,had so angered the Indian queen that she now refused to furnish guides and carriers, whereupon De Soto made her a prisoner, with the design of compelling her to act as guide herself, and at the same time to use her as a hostage to com- mand the obedience of her subjects. Instead, however, of conducting the Spaniards by the direct trail toward the west, she led them far out of their course until she, finally managed to make her escape, leaving them to find their way out of the mountains as best they could. Departing from Cofitachiqui, thej' turned first toward the north, passing through several towns subject to the queen, to whom, although a prisoner, the Indians everywhere showed great respect and obe- dience, furnishing whatever assistance the Spaniards compelled her to demand for their own purposes. In a few daj's they came to \"a province called Chalaque,\" the territory of the Cherokee Indians, probably upon the waters of Keowee river, the eastern head-stream of the Savannah. It is described as the poorest country for corn that they had yet seen, the inhabitants subsisting on wild roots and herbs and on game which they killed with bows and arrows. They were naked, lean, and unwarlike. The country abounded in wild turkeys (\"gallinas\"), which the people gave very freely to the strangers, one town presenting them with seven hundred. A chief also gave De Soto two deerskins as a great present.^ Garcilaso, writ- ing on the authority of an old soldier nearly fifty years afterward, says that the .\" Chalaques \" deserted their towns on the approach of the white men and fled to the mountains, leaving behind only old men and women and some who were nearly blind.' Although it was too early for the new crop, the poverty of the people may have been more apparent than real, due to their unwillingness to give any part of their stored-up provision to the unwelcome strangers. As the Spaniards were greatly in need of corn for themselves and their horses, they made no stay, but hurried on. In a few days they arrived ^ Gentleman of Elvas, Publicationa of the Hakluyt Society, ix, pp. 52, 58, 64; London, 1851. 2 Ibid., p. 60. \"Garcilaso, La Florida del Inca, p. 136, ed. 1723. MOONEY] THE DE SOTO EXPEDITION 1540 25 at Guaquili, which is mentioned onl}^ by Ranjel, who does not specify whether it was a town or a province^i. e., a tribal territory. It was probably a small town. Here they were welcomed in a friendly man- ner, the Indians giving them a little corn and many wild tui'keys, together with some dogs of a peculiar small species, which were bred for eating purposes and did not bark. ' They were also supplied with men to help carrj^ the baggage. The name Guaquili has a Cherokee sound and may be connected with wa'guU\\ \" whippoorwill,\" uwd'g'iU, \"foam,\"or^t7«, \"dog.\" Traveling still toward the north, they arrived a day or two later in the province of Xuala, in which we recognize the territory of the Suwali, Sara, or Cheraw Indians, in the piedmont region about the head of Broad river in North Carolina. Garcilaso, who did not see it, represents it as a rich countrj^ while the Elvas narrative and Biedma agree that it was a rough, broken country, thinly inhabited and poor in provision. According to Garcilaso, it was under the rule of the queen of Cofitachiqui, although a distinct province in itself.^ The principal town was beside a small rapid stream, close under a moun- tain. The chief received them in friendlj? fashion, giving them corn, dogs of the small breed already mentioned, carrying baskets, and bur- den bearers. The country roundabout showed greater indications of gold mines than anj^ they had yet seen.^ Here De Soto turned to the west, crossing a very high mountain range, which appears to have been the Blue ridge, and descending on the other side to a stream flowing in the opposite direction, which was probably one of the upper tributaries of the French Broad.' Although it was late in May, they found it very cold in the moun- tains.* After several days of suck travel they arrived, about the end of the, month, at the town of Guasili, or Guaxule. The chief and principal men came out some distance to welcome them, dressed in fine robes of skins, with feather head-dresses, after the fashion of the country. Before reaching this point the qiieen had managed to make her escape, together with three slaves of the Spaniards, and the last that was heard of her was that she was on her way back to her own country with one of the runaways as her husband. What grieved De Soto most in the matter was that she took with her a small box of pearls, which he had intended to take from her before releasing her, but had left with her for the present in order \"not to discontent her altogether. \" ^ Guaxule is described as a very large town surrounded by a number of small mountain streams which united to form the large river down which the Spaniards proceeded after leaving the place.\" Here, as 1 Ranjel, in Oyiedo, Historia General y Natural de las Indias, i, p. 562; Madrid, 1851. ^Garcilaso, La Florida del Inca,p.l37, 1723, •'Ranjel, op. cit., i, p. 562. ssee note 8, De Soto's route. * Elvas, Hakluyt Society, ix, p. 61, 1851. » Garcilaso, op. cit. , p. 139. 26 MYTHS OF THE CHEROKEE [eth.ann.19 elsewhere, the Indians received the white men with kindness and hos- pitality— so much so that the name of Guaxule became to the army a synonym for good fortune.^ Among other things they gave the Span- iards 300 dogs for food, although, according to the Elvas narrative, the Indians themselves did not eat them.' The principal officers of the expedition were lodged in the \"chief's house,\" by which we are to understand the townhouse, which was upon a high hill with a roadway to the top.^ From a close study of the narrative it appears that this \"hill\" was no other than the great Nacoochee mound, in White county, Georgia, a few miles northwest of the present Clarkesville.* It was within the Cherokee territory, and the town was pi'obably a settlement of that tribe. From here De Soto sent runners ahead to notify the chief of Chiaha of his approach, in order that sufficient corn might be ready on his arrival. Leaving Guaxule, they proceeded down the river, which we identify with the Chattahoochee, and in two days arrived at Canasoga, or Cana- sagua, a frontier town of the Cherokee. As they neared the town they were met by the Indians, bearing baskets of \" mulberries,'\" more probably the delicious service-berry of the southern mountains, which ripens in early summer, while the mulberry matures later. From here they continued down the river, which grew cpnstantly larger, through an uninhabited country which formed the disputed territory between the Cherokee and the Creeks. About five days after leaving Canasagua they were met by messengers, who escorted them to Chiaha, the first town of the province of Cofa. De Soto had crossed the state of Georgia, leaving the Cherokee country behind him, and was now among the Lower Creeks, in the neighborhood of the present Columbus, Georgia.\" With his subsequent wanderings after crossing the Chattahoochee into Alabama and beyond we need not concern ourselves (8). While resting at Chiaha De Soto met with a chief who confirmed what the Spaniards had heard before concerning mines in the province of Chisca, saying that there was there \"a melting of copper\" and of another metal of about the same color, but softer, and therefore not so much used.^ The province was northward from Chiaha, somewhere in upper Georgia or the adjacent part of Alabama or Tennessee, through all of which mountain region native copper is found. The other mineral, which the Spaniards understood to be gold, may have been iron pyrites, although there is some evidence that the Indians occa- sionally found and shaped gold nuggets.\" iRanjeljln Oviedo, Historia, i, p. 563, 1861. 2Elvas, Biedma, and Ranjel all make special reference to the dogs given them at this place; they seem to have been of the same .small breed (\"perrillos\") which Ranjel says the Indians used for food. sGarcllaso, La Florida dellnca, p. 139, 1723. * See note 8, De Soto's route. 6 See Elvas, Hakluyt Society, ix, p. 61, 1851; and Ranjel, op. cit., p. 563. \" See note 8, De Soto's route.

They rejoined the army some time after the march had been resumed, and reported , according to the Elvas chronicler, that their guides had taken them through a country so poor in corn, so rough, and over so high mountains that it would be impossible for the army to follow, wherefore, as the way grew long and lingering, they had turned back after reaching a little poor town where they saw nothing that was of any profit. They brought back with them a dressed buffalo skin which the Indians there bad given them, the first ever obtained by white men, and described in the quaint old chronicle as \"an ox hide as thin as a calf's skin, and the hair like a soft wool between the coarse and fine wool of sheep.\"' Garcilaso's glowing narrative gives a somewhat different impression. According to this author the scouts returned full of enthusiasm for the fertility of the country, and reported that the mines were of a fine species of copper, and had indications also of gold and silver, while their progress from one town to another had been a continual series of f eastings and Indian hospitalities.* However that may have been, De Soto made no further effort to reach the Cherokee mines, but con- tinued his course westward through the Creek country, having spent altogether a month in the mountain region. There is no record of any second attempt to penetrate the Cherokee country for twenty-six years (9). In 1561 the Spaniards took formal possession of the bay of Santa Elena, now Saint Helena, near Port Royal, on the coast of South Carolina. The next year the French made an unsuccessful attempt at settlement at the same place, and in 1566 Menendez made the Spanish occupancy sure by establishing there a fort which he called San Felipe.^ In November of that year Captain Juan Pardo was sent with a party from the fort to explore the interior. Accompanied by the chief of \" Juada\" (which from Vandera's narra- tive we find should be\"Joara,\" i.e., the Sara Indians already men- tioned in the De Soto chronicle), he proceeded as far as the territory of that tribe, where he built a fort, but on account of the snow in the mountains did not think it advisable to go farther, and returned, leaving a sergeant with thirty soldiers to garrison the post. Soon after his return he received a letter from the sergeant stating that the chief of Chisca — the rich mining country of which De Soto had heard — was very hostile to the Spaniards, and that in a recent battle the latter had killed a thousand of his Indians and burned fifty houses with almost no damage to themselves. Either the sergeant or his chronicler must have been an unconscionable liar, as it was asserted that all this was done with only fifteen men. Immediately afterward, according to the same story, the sergeant marched with twenty men about a day's 1 Elvas, Hakluyt Society, ix, p. 66, 1851. = Garcilaso, La Florida del Inca, p. 141, ed, 1723. 8 Shea, J.

Under instructions from his superior officer, the sergeant with his small party then proceeded to explore what lay beyond, and, taking a road which they were told led to the territory of a great chief, after four days of hard marching they came to his town, called Chiaha (Chicha, by mistake in the manuscript transla- tion), the same where De Soto had rested. It is described at this time as palisaded and strongly fortified, with a deep river on each side, and defended by over three thousand fighting men, there being no women or children among them. It is possible that in view of their former • experience with the Spaniards, the Indians had sent their families awaj' from the town, while at the same time they may have summoned warriors from the neighboring Creek towns in order to be prepared for anj' emergency. However, as before, they received the white men with the greatest kindness, and the Spaniards continued for twelve days through the territories of the same tribe until they arrived at the principal town (Kusa?), where, by the invitation of the chief, they built a small fort and awaited the coming of Pardo, who was expected to follow with a larger force from Santa Elena, as he did in the summer of 1567, being met on his arrival with every show of hospitality from the Creek chiefs. This second fort was said to be one hundred and forty leagues distant from that in the Sara country, which latter was called one hundred and twent}'^ leagues from Santa Elena. ^ In the summer of 1567, according to previous agreement. Captain Pardo left the fort at Santa Elena with a sma,ll detachment of troops, and after a week's travel, sleeping each night at a different Indian town, arrived at \" Canos, which the Indians call Canosi, and by another name, Cofetapque\" (the Cofitachiqui of the De Soto chronicle), which is described as situated in a favorable location for a large city, fifty leagues from Santa Elena, to which the easiest road was by a river (the Savannah) which flowed by the town, or by another which they had passed ten leagues farther back. Proceeding, they passed Jagaya, Gueza, and Arauchi, and arrived at Otariyatiqui, or Otari, in which we have perhaps the Cherokee d'Mri or d'tdli, '' mountain\". It may have been a frontier Cherokee settlement, and, according to the old chronicler, its chief and language ruled much good country. From here a trail went northward to Guatari, Sauxpa, and Usi, i. e., the Wateree, Waxhaw (or Sissipahaw ?), and Ushery or Catawba.- Leaving Otariyatiqui, they went on to Quinahaqui, and then, turn- ing to the left, to Issa, where they found mines of crystal (mica^). They came next to Aguaquiri (the Guaquili of the De Soto chronicle), and then to Joara, \"near to the mountain, where Juan Pardo arrived 1 Narrative of Pardo's expedition by Martinez, about 1568, Brooks manuscripts.

Vandera makes it one hundred leagues from Santa Elena, while Martinez, already quoted, makes the distance one hundred and twenty leagues. The difference is not impoVtant, as both state- ments were only estimates. From there they followed \"along the mountains\" to Tooax (Toxaway?), Cauchi (Nacoochee?), and Tanas- qui — apparently Cherokee towns, although the forms can not be iden- tified— and after resting three days at the last-named place went on \"to Solameco, otherwise called Chiaha,\" where the ^ergeant met them. The combined forces afterward went on, through Cossa (Kusa), Tas- quiqui (Taskigi), and other Creek towiiS, as' far as Tascaluza, in the Alabama country, and returned thence to Santa Elena, having appar- ently met with a friendly reception everywhere along the route. From Cofitachiqui to Tascaluza they went over about the same road traversed by De Soto in 1540.' We come now to a great gap of nearly a century. Shea has a notice of a Spanish mission founded among the Cherokee in 1643 and still flourishing when visited by an English ti-aveler ten years later, ^ but as his information is derived entirely from the fraudulent work of Davies, and as no such mission is mentioned by Barcia in any of these years, we may regard the story as spurious (10). The first mission work in the tribe appears to haVe been that of Priber, almost a hundred years later. Long before the end of the sixteenth century, however, the existence of mines of gold and other metals in the Cherokee country was a matter of common knowledge among the Spaniards at St. Augus- <tine and Santa Elena, and more than one expedition had been fitted out to explore the interior.^ Numerous traces of ancient mining opera- tions, with remains of old shafts and fortifications, evidently of Euro- pean origin, show that these discoveries were followed up, although the policy of Spain concealed the fact from the outside world. How much permanent impression this early Spanish intercourse made on the Cherokee it is impossible to^estimate, but it must have been considerable (11). The Colonial and Revolutionaey Period — 1654-1784 It was not until 1654 that the English first came into contact with the Cherokee, called in the records of the period Rechahecrians, a cor- ruption of Rickahockan, apparently the name by which they were known to the Powhataji tribes. In that year the Virginia colony, which had only recently concluded a long and exterminating war with the Powhatan, was thrown into alarm by the news that a great body of 1 Vandera narrative, 1669, in Frencii, B.

The assembly at once passed resolutions \"that these new come Indians be in no sort suffered to seat themselves there, or any place near us, it having cost so much blood to expel and extirpate those perfidious and treacherous Indians which were there formerly.\" It was therefore ordered that a force of at least 100 white men be at once sent against them, to be joined by the war- riors of all the neighboring subject tribes, according to treaty obliga-. tion. The Pamunkey chief, with a hundred of his men, responded to the summons, and the combined force marched against the invaders. The result was a bloody battle, with disastrous outcome to the Vir- ginians, the Pamunkey chief with most of his men being killed, while the whites were forced to make such terms of peace with the Recha- hecrians that the assembly cashiered the commander of the expedition and compelled him to pay the whole cost of the treaty from his own estate.' Owing to the imperfection of the Virginia records we have no means of knowing the causes of the sudden invasion or how long the invaders retained their position at the falls. In all probability it was only the last of a long series of otherwise unrecorded irruptions by the mountaineers on the more peaceful dwellers in the lowlands. From a remark in Lederer it is probable that the Cherokee were assisted also by some of the piedmont tribes hostile to the Powhatan. The Peaks of Otter, near which the Cherokee claim to have once lived, as has been already noted, are only about one hundred miles in a straight line from Richmond, while the burial mound and town site near Charlottesville, mentioned by Jefferson, are but half that distance. In 1655 a Virginia expedition sent out from the falls of James river (Richmond) crossed over the mountains to the large streams flowing into the Mississippi. No details are given and the route is uncertain, but whether or not they met Indians, they must have passed through Cherokee territory.^ In 1670 the German traveler, John Lederer, went from the falls of James river to the Catawba country in South Carolina, following for most of the distance the path used by the Virginia traders, who already had regular dealings with the southern tribes, including probably the Cherokee. He speaks in several places of the Rickahockan, which seems to be a more correct form than Rechahecrian, and his narrative and the accompanying map put them in the mountains of North Caro- lina, back of the Catawba and the Sara and southward from the head of Roanoke river. They were apparently on hostile terms with the tribes to the eastward, and while the traveler was stopping at an Indian 1 Burk, John, History oJ Virginia, ii, pp. 104-107; Petersburg, 1805. 2 Ramsey, J.

On reaching the Catawba country he heard of white men to the southward, and incidentally mentions that the neighboring mountains were called the Suala mountains by the Span- iards.' In the next year, 1671, a party from Virginia under Thomas Batts explored the northern branch of Roanoke river and crossed over the Blue ridge to the headwaters of New river, where they found traces of occupancy, but no Indians. By this time all the tribes of this section, east of the mountains, were in possession of firearms.^ The first permanent English settlement in South Carolina was estab- lished in 1670. In 1690 James Moore, secretary of the colony, made an exploring expedition into the mountains and reached a point at which, according to his Indian guides, he was within twenty miles of where the Spaniards were engaged in mining and smelting with bel- lows and furnaces, but on account of some misunderstanding he returned without visiting the place, although he procured specimens of ores, which he sent to England for assay.' It may have been in the neighborhood of the present Lincolnton, North Carolina, where a dam of cut stone and other remains of former civilized occupancy have recently been discovered (11). In this year, also, Cornelius Dougherty, an Irishman from Virginia, established himself as the first trader among the Cherokee, with whom he spent the rest of his life.* Some of his descendants still occupy honored positions in the tribe. Among the manuscript archives of South Carolina there was said to be, some fifty years ago, a treaty or agreement made with the govern- ment of that colony by the Cherokee in 1684, and signed with the hieroglyphics of eight chiefs of the lower towns, viz, Corani, the Raven (K^'lanu); Sinnawa, the Hawk (Tla'nuwa); Nellawgitehi, Gor- haleke, and Owasta, all of Toxawa; and Canacaught, the great Con- juror, Gohoma, and Caunasaita, of Keowa. If still in existence, this is probably the oldest Cherokee treaty on record.^ What seems to be the next mention of the Cherokee in the South Carolina records occurs in 1691, when we find an inquiry ordered in regard to a report that some of the colonists \"have, without any proc- lamation of war, fallen upon and murdered\" several of that tribe.\" In 1693 some Cherokee chiefs went to Charleston with presents for the governor and offers of friendship, to ask the protection of South Carolina against their enemies, theEsaw (Catawba), Savanna (Shawano), iLederer, John, Discoveries, pp. 15, 26, 27,- 29, 33, and map; reprint, Cliarleston, 1891; Mooney, Siouan Tribes of tlie East (bulletin of Bureau of Ethnology), pp. 63-54, 1894. 2 Mooney, op. cit., pp. 34^35. ^Document of 1699, quoted in South Carolina Hist.

They were told that their kinsmen could not now be recovered, but that the English desired friendship with their tribe, and that the Government would see that there would be no future ground for such complaint.^ The promise was apparently not kept, for in 1705 we find a bitter accusation brought against Governor Moore, of South Carolina, that he had granted com- missions to a number of persons \"to set upon, assault, kill, destroj', and take captive as many Indians as they possible [sic] could,\" the prisoners being sold into slavery for his and their private profit. By this course, it was asserted, he had \"already almost utterly ruined the trade for skins and furs, whereby we held our chief correspondence with England, and turned it into a trade of Indians or slave making, whereby the Indians to the south and west of us are already involved in blood and confusion.\" The arraignment concludes with a warning that such conditions would in all probability draw down upon the colony an Indian war with all its dreadful consequences.\" In view of what happened a few years later this reads like a prophecy. About the year 1700 the first guns were introduced among the Cher- okee, the event being fixed traditionally as having occurred in the girl- hood of an old woman of the tribe who died about 1775.' In 1708 we find them described as a numerous people, living in the mountains northwest from the Charleston settlements and having sixty towns, but of small importance in the Indian trade, being \"but ordinary hunters and less warriors.\"* In the war with the Tuscarora in 1711-1713, which resulted in the expulsion of that tribe from North Carolina, more than a thousand southern Indians reenforced the South Carolina volunteers, among them being over two hundred Cherokee, hereditary enemies of the Tuscarora. Although these Indian allies did their work well in the actual encounters, their assistance was of doubtful advantage, as they helped themselves freely to whatever they wanted along the way, so that the settlers had reason to fear them almost as much as the hostile Tuscarora. After torturing a large number of their prisoners in the usual savage fashion, they returned with the remainder, whom they afterward sold as slaves to South Carolina.' Having wiped out old scores with the Tuscarora, the late allies of the English proceeded to discuss their own grievances, which, as we have seen,' were sufficiently galling. The result was a combination 1 Hewat, South Carolina and Georgia, i, p. 127, 1778. 2 Documents of 1705, in North Carolina Colonial Records, ii, p. 904; Raleigh, 1886. 'Haywood, Nat. and Aborig.

MOONEY] MOORE's expedition 1715-16 33 against the whites, embracing all the tribes from Cape Fear to the Chattahoochee, including the Cherokee, who thus for the first time raised their hand against the English. The war opened with a terrible massacre by the Yamassee in April, 1715, followed by assaults along the whole frontier, until for a time it was seriously feared that the colony of South Carolina would be wiped out of existence. In a contest between savagery and civilization, however, the final result is inevitable. The settlers at last rallied their whole force under Gov- ernor Craven and administered such a crushing blow to the Yamassee that the remnant abandoned their country and took refuge with the Spaniards in Florida or among the Lower Creeks. The English then made short work with the smaller tribes along the coast, while those in the interior were soon glad to sue for peace. ^ A number of Cherokee chiefs having come down to Charleston in company with a trader to express their desire for peace, a force of several hundred white troops and a number of negroes under Colonel Maurice Moore went up the Savannah in the winter of 1715-16 and made headquarters among the Lower Cherokee, where they were met by the chiefs of the Lower and some of the western towns, who reaffirmed their desire for a lasting peace with the English, but refused to fight -against the Yamassee, although willing to proceed against some other tribes. They laid the blame for most of the trouble upon the traders, who \"had been very abuseful to them of late.\" A. detachment under Colonel George Chicken, sent to the Upper Cherokee, penetrated to \"Quoneashee\" (Tlanusi'yi, on Hiwassee, about the present Murphy) where they found the chiefs more defiant, resolved to continue the war against the Creeks, with whom the Eng- lish were then trying to make peace, and demanding large supplies of guns and ammunition, saying that if they made a peace with the other tribes they would have no means of getting slaves with which to buy ammunition for themselves. At this time they claimed 2,370 war- riors, of whom half were believed to have guns. As the strength of the whole Nation was much greater, this estimate may have been for the Upper and Middle Cherokee only. After \"abundance of per- suading\" by the officers, they finally \"told us they would trust us once again,\" and an arrangement was made to furnish them two hun- dred guns with a supply of ammunition, together with fifty white soldiers, to assist them against the tribes with which the English were still at war. In March, 1716, this force was increased by one hundred men. The detachment under Colonel Chicken returned by way of the towns on the upper part of the Little Tennessee, thus penetrating the heart of the Cherokee country.^ 1 Hewat, South Carolina and Georgia, i, p. 216 et passim, 1778. 2 See Journal of Colonel George Chicken, 1715-16, with notes, in Charleston Yearbook, pp. 313-354, 1894. 19 ETH— 01 3 34 MYTHS OF THE CHEROKEE [eth.ann.19 Steps were now taken to secure peace by inaugurating a satisfactory trade system, for which purpose a large quantity of suitable goods was purchased at the public expense of South Carolina, and a corre- spondingly large party was equipped for the initial trip.^ In 1721, in order still more to systematize Indian affairs. Governor Nicholson of South Carolina invited the chiefs of the Cherokee to a conference, at which thirtj^-seven towns were represented. A treaty was made by which trading methods were regulated, a boundary line between their territory and the English settlements was agreed upon, and an agent was appointed to superintend their affairs. At the governoi-'s suggestion, one chief, called Wrosetasatow ( ?) ^ was formally commis- sioned as supreme head of the Nation, with authority to punish all offenses, including murder, and to represent all Cherokee claims to the colonial government. Thus were the Cherokee reduced from their former condition of a free people, ranging where their pleasure led, to that of dependent vassals with bounds fixed by a colonial governor. The negotiations were accompanied by a cession of land, the first in the history of the tribe. In little more than a century thereafter they had signed away their whole original territory.' The document of 1716 already quoted puts the strength of the Chero- kee at that time at 2,370 warriors, but in this estimate the Lower Cherokee seem not to have been included. In 1715, according to a trade census compiled by Governor Johnson of South Carolina, the tribe had thirty towns, with 4,000 warriors and a total population of 11,210.* Another census in 1721 gives them fifty-three towns with 3,510 warriors and a total of 10,379^^ while the report of the board of trade for the same year gives them 3,800 warriors,\" equivalent, by the same proportion, to nearly 12,000 total. Adair, a good authority on such matters, estimates, about the year 1735, when the country was better known, that they had \"sixty -four towns and villages, populous and full of children,\" with more than 6,000 fighting men,' equivalent on the same basis of computation to between 16,000 and 17,000 souls. From what we know of them in later times, it is probable that this last estimate is very nearly correct. By this time the colonial government had become alarmed at the advance of the French, who had made their first permanent establish- ment in the- Gulf states at Biloxi bay, Mississippi, in 1699, and in 1714 had built Fort Toulouse, known to the English as \"the fort at ' Journal of South Carolina Assembly, in North Carolina Colonial Records, ir, pp. 225-227 1886 2 For notice, see the glossary. sHevvat, South Carolina and Georgia, i, pp. 297-298, 1778; Boyce, Cherokee Nation, in Fifth Ann.

From this central vantage point thej' had rapidly extended their influence among all the neighboring tribes until in 1721 it was estimated that 3,400 warriors who had formerly traded with Carolina had been \"entirely debauched to the French interest,\" while 2,000 more were wavering, and only the Cherokee could still be considered friendly to the English.' From this time until the final withdrawal of the French in 1763 the explanation of our Indian wars is to be found in the struggle between the two nations for territorial and commercial supremacy, the Indian being simply the cat's-paw of one or the other. For reasons of their own, the Chickasaw, whose territory lay within the recognized limits of Louisiana, soon beOame the uncompromising enemies of the French,, and as their position enabled them in a measure to control the approach from the Mississippi, the Carolina government saw to it that they were kept well supplied with guns and ammunition. British traders were in all their towns, and on one occasion a French force, advancing against a Chickasaw palisaded village, found it garrisoned by Englishmen fljdng the British flag.^ The Cherokee, although nominally allies of the English, were strongly disposed to favor the French, and it required every effort of the Carolina government to hold them to their allegiance. In 1730, to further fix the Cherokee in the English interest, Sir Alexander Cuming was dispatched on a secret mission to that tribe, which was again smarting under grievances and almost ready to join with the Creeks in an alliance with the French. Proceeding to the ancient town of Nequassee (Nikwasf, at the present Franklin, North Carolina), he so impressed the chiefs by his bold bearing that they conceded without question all his demands, submitting themselves and their people for t;he second time to the English dominion and designating Moytoy,' of Tellico, to act as their \"emperor\" and to represent the Nation in all transactions with the whites. Seven chiefs were selected to visit England, where, in the palace at Whitehall, they solemnly renewed the treaty, acknowledging the sovereignty of England and binding themselves to have no trade or alliance with any other nation, not to allow any other white people to settle among them, and to deliver up any fugitive slaves who might seek refuge with them. To confirm their words they delivered a \"crown\", five eagle-tails, and four scalps, which they had brought with them. In return they received the usual glittering promises of love and per- petual friendship, together with a substantial quantity of guns, ammu- nition, and red paint.

The awful mortality was due largely to the fact that as it was a new and strange disease to the Indians they had no proper remedies against it, and therefore resorted to the universal Indian panacea for \"strong\" sickness of almost any kind, viz, cold plunge baths in the running stream, the worst treatment that could possibly be devised. As the pestilence spread unchecked from town to town, despair fell upon the nation. The priests, believing the visitation a penalty for violation of the ancient ordinances, threw away their sacred paraphernalia as things which had lost their protecting power. Hundreds of the warriors committed suicide on beholding their frightful disfigurement. \"Some shot themselves, others cut their throats, some stabbed themselves with knives and others with sharp-pointed canes; many threw them- selves with sullen madness into the fire and there slowly expired, as if they had been utterly divested of the native power of feeling pain.'\" Another authority estimates their loss at a thousand warriors, partly from smallpox and partly from rum brought in by the traders.* About the year 1740 a trading path for horsemen was marked out by the Cherokee from the new settlement of Augusta, in Georgia, to their towns on the headwaters of Savannah river and thence on to the west. This road. Which went up the south side of the river, soon became much frequented.' Previous to this time most of the trading goods had been transported on the backs of Indians.

He drew up for their adoption a scheme of government modeled after the European plan, with the capital at Great Tellico, in Tennessee, the principal medicine man as emperor, and himself as the emperor's secretary. Under this title he corrbsponded with the South Carolina government until it began to be feared that he would ultimately win over the whole tribe to the French side. A commissioner was sent to arrest him, but the Cherokee refused to give him up, and the deputj'- was obliged to return under safe-conduct of an escort furnished by Priber. Five years after the inauguration of his work, however, he was seized by some English traders while on his way to Fort Toulouse, and brought as a prisoner to Frederica, in Georgia, where he soon afterward died while under confinement. Although his enemies had represented him as a monster, inciting the Indians to the grossest immoralities, he proved to be a gentleman of polished address, exten- sive learning, and rare courage, as was shown later on the occasion of an explosion in the barracks magazine. Besides Greek, Latin, French, German, Spanish, and fluent English, he spoke also the Cherokee, and among his papers which were seized was found a manuscript dictionary of the language, which he had prepared for publication — the first, and even yet, perhaps, the most important studj'^ of the lan- guage ever made. Says Adair: \"As he was learned and possesse.d of a very sagacious penetrating judgment, and had every qualification that was requisite for his bold and difficult enterprise, it was not to be doubted that, as he wrote a Cheerake dictionary, designed to be published at Paris, he likewise set down a great deal that would have been very acceptable to the curious and serviceable to the representa- tives of South Carolina and Georgia, which may be readity found in Frederica if the manuscripts have had the good fortune to escape the despoiling hands of military power.\" He claimed to be a Jesuit, acting under orders of his superior, to introduce habits of steady industry, civilized arts, and a regular form of government-among the southern ti-ibes, with a view to the ultimate founding of an independent Indian state. From all that can be gathered of him, even though it comes from his enemies, there can be little doubt that he was a worthy member of that illustrious order whose name has been a synonym for scholarship, devotion, and courage from the days of Jogues and Mar- quette down to De Smet and Mengarini.^ Up to this time no civilizing or mission work had been undertaken by either of the Carolina governments among any of the tribes within their borders. As one writer of the period quaintly puts it, \"The gospel spirit is not yet so gloriousl}'^ arisen as to seek them more than theirs,\" while another in stronger terms affirms, \"To the shame of 1 Adair, American Indians, pp. 240-243, 1775; Stevens, W.

Throughout the eighteenth century the Cherokee were engaged in chronic warfare with their Indian neighbors. As these quarrels con- cerned the whites but little, however momentous they may have been to the principals, we have but few details. The war with the Tusca- rora continued until the outbreak of the latter tribe against Carolina in 1711 gave opportunity to the Cherokee to cooperate in striking the blow which drove the Tuscarora from their ancient homes to seek refuge in the north. The Cherokee then turned their attention to the Shawano on the Cumberland, and with the aid of the Chickasaw finally expelled them from that region about the year 1715. Inroads upon the Catawba were probably kept up until the latter had become so far reduced by war and disease as to be mere dependent pensioners upon the whites. The former friendship with the Chickasaw was at last broken through the overbearing conduct of the Cherokee, and a war followed of which we find incidental notice in 1767,^ and which termi- nated in a decisive victory for the Chickasaw about 1768. The bitter war with the Iroquois of the far north continued, in spite of all the efl'orts of the colonial governments, until a formal treaty of peace was brought about by the efforts of Sir William Johnson (12) in the same year. The hereditary war with the Creeks for possession of upper Georgia continued, with brief intervals of peace, or even alliance, until the United States finally interfered as mediator between the rival claimants. In 1718 we find notice of a large Cherokee war party moving against the Creek town of Coweta, on the lower Chattahoochee, but dispersing on learning of the presence there of some French and Spanish officers, as well as some English traders, all bent on arranging an alliance with the Creeks. The Creeks themselves had declared their willingness to be at peace with the English, while still determined to keep the bloody hatchet uplifted against the Cherokee.\" The most important incident of the struggle between the two tribes was probably the battle of Tali'wa about the year 1755.* By this time the weaker coast tribes had become practically extinct, and the more powerful tribes of the interior were beginning to take the alarm, as they saw the restless borderers pushing every year farther into the Indian country.

Two years later he made a second exploration and penetrated to Ken- tucky river, but on account of the Indian troubles no permanent settlement was then attempted/ This invasion of their territory awakened a natural resentment of the native owners, and we find proof also in the Virginia records that the irresponsible borderers seldom let pass an opportunity to kill and plunder any stray Indian found in their neighborhood. In 1755 the Cherokee were officially reported to number 2,590 wai'- riors, as against probably twice that number previous to the great smallpox epidemic sixteen years before. Their neighbors and ancient enemies, the Catawba, had dwindled to 240 men.^ Although war was not formally declared by England until 1756, hostilities in the seven year's struggle between France and England, commonly known in America as the \" French and Indian war,\" began in April, 1754, when the French seized a small post which the English had begun at the present site of Pittsburg, and which was afterward finished by the French under the name of Fort Du Quesne. Strenuous efforts were made by the English to secure the Cherokee to their interest against the French and their Indian allies, and treaties were negotiated by which they promised assistance.' As these treaties, however, carried the usual cessions of territory, and stipulated for the building of several forts in the heart of the Cherokee countrj^ it is to be feared that the Indians were not duly impressed by thi„ disin- terested character of the proceeding. Their preference for the French was but thinly veiled, and only immediate policj' prevented them from throwing their whole force into the scale on that side. The reasons for this preference are given by Timberlake, the young Virginian officer who visited the tribe on an embassy of conciliation a few years later: I found the nation much attached to the French, who have the prudence, by famiUar politeness — which costs but little and often does a great deal — and conform- ing themselves to their ways and temper, to conciliate the ijaclinations of almost all the Indians they are acquainted with, while the pride of our officers often disgusts them. Nay, they did not scruple to own to me that it was the trade alone that^ induced them to make peace with us, and not any preference to the French, whom they loved a great deal better. . . . The English are now so nigh, and encroached daily so far upon them, that they not only felt the bad effects of it in their hunting grounds, which were spoiled, but had all the reason in the world to apprehend being swallowed up by so potent neighbors or driven from the country inhabited by their fathers, in which they were born and brought up, in fine, their native soil, for which all men have a particular tenderness and affection. 1 Walker, Thomas, Journal of an Exploration, etc., pp. 8, 35-37; Boston, 1888; Monette (Valley of the Miss, i, pi 317; New York, 1848) erroneously makes the second date 1758. 2 Lettei- of Governor Dobbs, 1755, in North Carolina Colonial Eecords, v. pp. 320, 321, 1887.

In accordance with the treatj^ stipulations Fort Prince George was built in 1756 adjoining the important Cherokee town of Keowee, on the headwaters of the Savannah, and Fort Loudon near the junction of Tellico river with the Little Tennessee, in the center of the Cherokee towns beyond the mountains.- By special arrangement with the influential chief, Ata-kuUakulla (Ata'-gul'^kalu'),^ Fort Dobbs was also built in the same year about 20 miles west of the present Salis- bury, North Carolina.* The Cherokee had agreed to furnish four hundred warriors to cooperate against the French in the north, but before Fort Loudon had been completed it was very evident that they had repented of their promise, as their great council at Echota ordered the work stopped and the garrison on the way to turn back, plainly telling the officer in charge that they did not want so many white people among them. Ata-kullakulla, hitherto supposed to be one of the stanchest friends of the English, was now one of the most determined in the oppo- sition. It was in evidence also that they were in constant communi- cation with the French. By much tact and argument their objec- tions were at last overcome for a time, and they very unwillingly set about raising the promised force of warriors. Major Andrew Lewis, who superintended the building of the fort, became convinced that the Cherokee were really friendly to the French, and that all their professions of friendship and assistance were ' ' only to put a gloss on their knavery. \" The fort was finalh' completed, and, on his suggestion, was garrisoned with a strong force of two hundred men under Captain Demer^.^ There was strong ground for believing that some depreda- tions committed about this time on the heads of Catawba and Broad rivers, in North Carolina, were the joint work of Cherokee and northern Indians.\" Notwithstanding all this, a considerable body of Cherokee joined the British forces on the Virginia frontier.' Fort Du Quesne was taken by the American provincials under Wash- ington, November 25, 1758. Quebec was taken September 13, 1759, and by the final treaty of peace in 1763 the war ended with the transfer of Canada and the Ohio valley to the crown of England. Louisiana had already been ceded by France to Spain. Although France was thus eliminated from the Indian problem, the 1 Timberlake, Henry, Memairs, pp. 78, 74; London, 1765. \" Kamsey, Tennessee, p. 51, 1853; Royce, Cherokee Nation, in Fif tli Ann.

In the north the confederated tribes under Pontiac continued to war on their own account until 1765. In the South the very Cherokee who had acted as allies of the British against Fort DuQuesne, and had \\'olun- tarily offered to guard the frontier south of the Potomac, returned to rouse their tribe to resistance. The immediate exciting cause of the trouble was an unfortunate expe- dition undertaken against the hostile Shawano in February , 1756, by Major Andrew Lewis (the same who had built Fort Loudon) with some two hundred Virginia troops assisted b\\' about one hundred Cherokee. After six weeks of fruitless tramping through the woods, with the ground covered with snow and the streams so swollen by rains that they lost their provisions and ammunition in crossing, they were obliged to return to the settlements in a starving condition, having killed their horses on the way. The Indian contingent had from the first- been disgusted at the contempt and neglect experienced from those whom they had come to assist. The Tuscarora and others had already gone home, and the Cherokee now started to return on foot to their own country. Finding some horses running loose on the range, they appropriated them, on the theory that as they had lost their own animals, to say nothing of having risked their lives, in the service of the colonists, it was only a fair exchange. The frontiersmen took another view of the question however, attacked the returning Cherokee, and killed a 'number of them, variously stated at from twelve to forty, including several of their prominent inen. Accord- ing to Adair they also scalped and mutilated the bodies in the savage fashion to which they had become accustomed in the border wars, and brought the scalps into the settlements, where they were represented as those of French Indians and sold at the regular price then estab- lished by law. The young warriors at once prepared to take revenge, but were restrained by the chiefs until satisfaction could be demanded in the ordinary way, according to the treaties arranged with the colonial governments. Application was made in turn to Virginia, North Carolina, and South Carolina, but without success. While the women were still wailing night and morning for their slain kindred, and the Creeks were taunting the warriors for their cowardice in thus quietly submitting to the injury, some lawless officers of Fort Prince George committed an unpardonable outrage at the neighboring Indian town while most of the men were away hunting.^ The warriors could no longer be restrained. Soon there was news of attacks upon the back settlements of Carolina, while on the other side of the mountains two soldiers of the Fort Loudon garrison were killed. War seemed at hand. 1 Adair, American Indians, 245-246, 1775; North Carolina Colonial Records, v, p. xlviii, 1887; Hewat, quoted in Ramsey, Tennessee, p. 54, 1853. 42 MYTHS OF THE CHEROKEE [eth.ann.19 At this juncture, in November, 1758, a party of influential chiefs, having first ordered back a war party just about to set out from the western towns against the Carolina settlements, came down to Charles- ton and succeeded in arranging the difficulty upon a friendlj' basis.
