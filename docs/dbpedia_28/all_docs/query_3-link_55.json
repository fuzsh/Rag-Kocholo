        "text": "How can I possibly get a copy of Pleasant and Mary Rhea's photos? They are my great-great-great-grandparents! I was so thrilled to see them. Is there some way to e-mail them to me or get permission to copy them? I would be so grateful. Hello Michelle,\n\nI was admiring your pictures when I saw the Layered Glass Tree. I am trying to find one and was hoping you could share some information with me about the item. Do you know who created this piece and when it was created? It would be a perfect gift.\n\nThank you so much for your time.\n\nJCHi ... you are so creative .I like your works so much....I am an artist from Udaipur , India.i paint on canvas, paper etc .. I hope we can be good friends ....\n\nwhat more can i say .. except keep-smiling ..\n\nwww.krishangallery.com Hi,\n\nMy name is Hannah Hudson and I am an artist working in Texas right now. Your album from Jefferson, TX is beautiful! I was wondering if you could give me any information about the location of the chimney in the pictures. I am working on a series of installations on chimneys, and that one is perfect.\n\nThank-youCan you tell me the model# or the name of the skating ice rink that that one lady trinket is from? i've been trying track one of these down. This was one of my greatest childhood memories before we moved and my parents went through a divorce when i was in the sixth grade. please get back to me ASAPI just came across your website while looking at Doak informtion related to the Texas Choctaws (Yowani Choctaws). I assume you are descended from Mary Elizabeth (Fannin) Rhea, but not sure how you are connected, if at all. Although, some of the tombstone pics, I recognize. Anyway, just wanted to compliment your site and work, very impressive.\n\nJ.C. Thompson, Chairman, Texas Cherokees and Associate BandsHey Michelle.\n\nI have been following the recent thread on The Atheist Mama and came across both your comments and your very nicely written poem. I liked your poem so much that I posted it on my on blog (with credit to you of course). Hope you don't mind!\n\nHello Michelle,\n\nI'm sorry that I didn't get to meet you at TAM4. Again, I enjoy your photos. You have a good eye for content and composition. For what it's worth, in your \"photo a day\" section you have a picture of Randi, Penn, Nadine Strossen and the person on the right of the photo is scientific editor and writer Leon Jaroff. I hope to meet you next January. Hello Steve,\n\nThank you for telling me about that debate on Pbase. I was not aware of it. However, I'm also not overly interested in taking part in that one here. The vast majority of the people arguing are anonymous. Why argue with people who are too afraid to reveal who they are?There's a religious debate raging under this gallery\n\nhttp://www.pbase.com/dan_muc/freedomofspeech\n\nand you aren't a part of it!!! What's wrong?\n\nDon't know about it? Or just don't want to stir that pot?\n\nps Great galleries, like the erotic flowers... maybe girls should by more of those for guys instead of the other way round!thanks for the visit and the nice comments Michelle. You have some lovely shots yourself\n\nI'll try and come visit to look more properly at them - at the moment I regretfully have too little time\n\nginaHi Michelle,\n\nEnjoyed meeting you again at MA's party. Had a great time with you trekkie chicks *s* don't seem to see that on your Match bio though, think of how that could broaden your appeal ....\n\nMy Match name is Jaydp -- I liked what you wrote on Match. Not too suprising that we turned out to match on everything, don't think I have ever got all matches on Dallas person. Hope your visit goes well and that you have a lot of fun. If you do find yourself at loose ends give me a call, I'd enjoy talking with you some more. Jay Purrington 214-793-6475\n\nI saw your gallery of flower erotica on the list for popular galleries here tonight and am I glad I stopped by. What a quirky sense of humor you have! I realized after looking through several of them I had a smile on my face. Just plain grinning into the monitor.The signs! The cemeteries! The SoCal Ice!!! Nice work, truly.\n\nVeronicaHi Susan,\n\nThank you for the compliment to my poems, but you need not feel sad for me. I am not \"hopeless\" even if some of these poems seem to be. These poems deal with subjects such as war, death, marriage to a mentally ill man, and divorce. Those subjects naturally lend themselves to \"sad\" poems.hi michelle,\n\ni don't quite know what to think of your poems.\n\nthey are very sad and hopeless\n\nbut you say it all in such a beautiful way!\n\nin other words, i like them very much\n\nbut feel sad for you at the same time.\n\neither way, you do have a talent for expressing yourself.\n\ni applaud you. michelle,\n\ni do like your pics but can't say the same for your beliefs.\n\nwhether God exists is not determined by subjective likes or dislikes, dissappointments,\n\nor lack of desire. and it doesn't depend on \"when\" someone was born and what current\n\nor past belief in \"the gods\" are. Thank you Michelle for your inspired words to my gallery. your poem is very beautiful, sensitive and touching; and I must say it fits very well to my gallery. :) I'm very glad you liked it. I find the thoughts and symbolism in your images and poems to be in my taste (though I'm not usually much of a poetry lover). I wish your images were smaller though - I they look better when they have been resized to web viewing (something like 800x on the wide side). I never use the PBase \"other sizes\" function, because it doesn't do images justice. Btw. Have you read Nietzsche's Antichrist? I recommend it - it is a classic among philosophical texts and you seem to have the same kind of taste for religion as I do. See the tag line on my profile page if you wish."
