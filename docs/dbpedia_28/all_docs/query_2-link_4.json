It is a true testament to our unwavering dedication to creating a safe work environment for our employees. While we did not win the award this time, being nominated is a tremendous honor in itself. It highlights the hard work and collective effort of our entire team in prioritizing safety at every level of our organization. We would like to extend a special acknowledgment to our Safety and Training Officer, Dean Lowery (pictured here with CNI Manufacturing's President, Jonna Kirschner), whose tireless efforts have been instrumental in fostering a strong safety culture at CNI Manufacturing. Dean's participation in the Oklahoma Department of Labor On-Site OSHA Consultation Program has been invaluable in ensuring that we adhere to the highest safety standards. At CNI Manufacturing, safety is not just a priority; it is ingrained in our DNA. We are proud to share that our safety record stands at an impressive 4 years, 9 months, 3 weeks, and six days (with no end in sight). This achievement reflects the commitment and vigilance of each and every team member who contributes to maintaining a safe workplace.

Our dedicated team spent a productive week mastering the ins and outs of our brand-new Mazak Optiplex 4420 NEO laser. The training covered everything from operation and diagnostics to advanced maintenance procedures. They've also gained valuable insights into optimizing our existing lasers for even better performance. The Optiplex 4420 NEO is a true game-changer for CNI Manufacturing.
