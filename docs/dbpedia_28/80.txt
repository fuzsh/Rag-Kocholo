We are

Native

But we are more than all of these things. We are Choctaw Proud.

Anyone can be Choctaw Proud. The Choctaw Proud are humble, appreciative people who value faith, family and culture. We honor the past, live in the present and look to the future. We are resilient people, overcoming adversity with grace and dignity. Those who are Choctaw Proud work hard to be successful and give back to their communities.
