        "text": "Results\n\nThe context of the collection\n\nHistory of the CCP\n\nThe expedition and the CCP were organised by the Spanish government in the last years of the reign of Isabel II, during a very boisterous political time. The CCP, composed of several naturalists, was included in a military expedition to visit some of the former Spanish colonial regions in South and Central America (Río de la Plata, Valdivia, Valparaíso, Copiapó, Cobija, El Callao, Guayaquil, Nueva Granada, Central America and Mexico) which had recently become independent. The Commission members were shipped in the frigate “Triunfo” under the commandant Croquer; other ships of the squad were the frigate “Resolución” and the schooners “Covadonga” and “Vencedora”, all under general Pinzón as chief of the Expedition.\n\nThe CCP was considered a national priority connected to the protection programme promoted by the (French) Société Impériale Zoologique d’Acclimatation and the framework of a pan-hispanist political and cultural movement, whose objectives agreed with those of Mariano de la Paz Graells, who was adviser of Queen Isabel II, Director of the Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales and Jardín Botánico, member of the Commission organisation and editor of the scientific instructions for the expedition. Nevertheless, military goals were probably the main objective in the organisation of the expedition (Puig-Samper, 1988). Although the CCP started out together, they split up frequently in to smaller groups once they reached South America and the itinerary of the expedition is thus rather complicated (Calatayud, 1994: 249–282). A brief description was published immediately after the return to Spain by Almagro (1866); further details may be found in Puig-Samper (1988), Calatayud (1994), and López-Ocón (2003).\n\nBefore the CCP left, rather detailed instructions had been made about what especially had to be collected (Puig-Samper, 1988), and among the zoologists, tasks were divided which is reflected in their biographies. As may be seen, all CCP members mentioned below had links to Spanish universities or academic centres at the time of their selection.\n\nPatricio Paz y Membiela (1808–1874; hereafter: Paz, Fig. 3) came from a marine and military background and travelled all over the world having visited South America three times in total (Barreiro, 1992: 438), but apart from the visit with the CCP no dates nor itineraries of his travels are known. He formed an excellent shell collection, which probably originated from his relationship with the Cuban naturalists Felipe Poey and Nicolás Gutiérrez in Matanzas and La Habana respectively. He was designated as President of the Commission in 1862, but his continuous confrontations with the commandant of the “Triunfo” lead to his resignation to Queen Isabel II in 1863; he left the CCP in Callao. Once the CCP had returned to Spain, he was entrusted along with Francisco de Paula Martínez in the preparation of the zoological material for a public exhibition in the Botanical Garden in Madrid in 1866 (López-Ocón & Badía, 2003). After his death, his mollusc collection comprising 12,000 species and 40,000 specimens was sold to the MNCN (Barreiro, 1992: 437).\n\nFernando Amor y Mayor (1822–1863; hereafter: Amor) finished his studies of pharmacy in 1845 in Madrid, and became full professor in the Institutes of Cuenca, Córdoba and Valladolid. He had good contacts with Mariano de la Paz Graells, who was MNCN director from 1851 and one of the scientific advisors of Queen Isabel II. Amor travelled in Morocco during 1859, probably associated to a military expedition to explore the future territory of the Spanish war in Morocco (Barras de Aragón, 1949; Puig-Samper, 1988). In 1862 he was designated as a member and vice-president of the CCP, and entrusted with geology and entomology. He died in San Francisco during the expedition possibly due to a disease contracted in the Atacama desert (Perejón, 2012). He wrote a diary, probably lost in the fire of the “Triunfo”, the ship on which the CCP travelled during the expedition. Part of this diary was saved by Barreiro (1926).\n\nFrancisco de Paula Martinez y Sáez (1835–1908; hereafter: Martinez, Fig. 4), finished his studies of natural sciences in 1857 in Madrid, and worked at the MNCN entrusted with the collections of vertebrates. He was professor of mineralogy and botany at the Central University in Madrid during 1861–1862, and full professor of natural history in the institute of Teruel. In 1862 Martinez was designated as member and secretary of the CCP (Gogorza, 1908). He was entrusted with aquatic mammals and reptiles, fishes, crustaceans, annelids, molluscs and zoophytes. He replaced Paz as president after his decomission and the death of Fernando Amor y Mayor in 1863, and planned and executed the last part of the Commission’s itinerary (“El gran viaje”) on the rivers Napo and Amazonas with Manuel Almagro, Marcos Jiménez de la Espada and Juan Isern. He wrote a diary of the expedition (Calatayud, 1994), and the books ‘Moluscos del Viaje al Pacífico, 2. Bivalvos marinos’ (Martínez, 1879?) and ‘Distribución metódica de los vertebrados’ (Martínez, 1879).\n\nManuel Almagro y Vega (1834–1895; hereafter: Almagro, Fig. 5) studied medicine in Cuba, Madrid and Paris, where he worked in the hospitals des Enfants, Dieu and la Pitié. In 1862 he was designated as member of the CCP for anthropologic and ethnographic studies. Almagro was one of the first professional anthropologists making field studies in the Americas (Puig-Samper, 1988). He wrote an analysis after the return of the Commission for the exhibition of the material at the Real Jardín Botánico in Madrid in 1866 (Almagro, 1866). This exhibition, an explicit wish of the CCP’s political and scientific sponsors, brought the results of the CCP to the general public and was considered a success (López-Ocón & Badía, 2003).\n\nJuan Isern Batlló y Carrera (1825–1866; hereafter: Isern, Fig. 6) studied botany and medicine in Barcelona, Girona and Madrid. He was in contact with foreign botanists like Willkomm and Webb, exchanging with them Catalonian and German plants. He worked at the MNCN and the Real Jardín Botánico in Madrid since 1851 where he was in direct contact with Graells and Miguel Colmeiro, directors of both scientific centres respectively. In 1862 Isern was designated as member of the CCP for botanical studies. He wrote an unpublished diary that is today in the archive of the Real Jardín Botánico (Blanco, Rodríguez & Rodríguez, 2006).\n\nMarcos Jiménez de la Espada (1831–1898) studied natural sciences in Madrid and in 1853 worked at the Central University. From 1857 he worked in the collections of the MNCN until his designation as member of the CCP for geological, zoological, anthropological, ethnographical, botanical and geographical studies. Although he was a disciple of Graells, Espada was rather critical about the organisation of the Commission (Puig-Samper, 1988). He published ‘Vertebrados del Viaje al Pacífico, Batracios’ (Jímenez de la Espada, 1875).\n\nWe will end this section with biographical data on persons who, although not members of the CCP, are important in the rest of this study. In Madrid two persons were related to the material collected by the CCP, Joaquin Hidalgo and Florentino Azpeitia. Abroad, only a few malacologists were entrusted with descriptions of part of the new species among this material, Hippolyte Crosse, Louis Pfeiffer and Rudolph Philippi.\n\nJoaquin G. Hidalgo (1839–1923; Fig. 7) studied medicine in Madrid at the San Carlos Hospital, and afterwards natural sciences at the Central University. He started with an interest in Mineralogy but decided to finalise his study in medicine on the advice of his professor Rafael Martinez y Molina; he graduated in 1861 and settled in Madrid as a medical doctor. Nevertheless, he began in these years with his collection of shells and his first naturalistic travels within Spain subsidised by Pedro González de Velasco (1815–1882), who worked at the San Carlos Hospital. In 1860 he came into contact with the military Patricio Paz y Membiela in Barcelona and together they worked on his extensive malacological collection. This was probably the reason why in 1862 Paz invited Hidalgo to become a member of the CCP as a naturalist; an offer which Hidalgo declined because of his medical practice. In his place Martínez became member of the Commission. During 1862 and 1875 Hidalgo gave classes at the Central University in zoology, mineralogy and botany. He travelled to Paris in 1865 and 1868, where he was in contact with Deshayes, Crosse and Fischer. Hidalgo had also relationships with Gassies, Souverbie, Guestier, Morelet, Morlet, Jousseaume, Fischer Jr., Dautzenberg, Dollfus, de Folin, Petit de la Saussaye, and Locard. We have found two documents compiled by Hidalgo that lead us to suggest he was sensitive to the opinions of others about his work. The first [Enumeración: MNCN Library F-II-5727] listed the comments of foreign colleagues as published in their own work (if not in French, translated into Spanish); the comments are mainly from Crosse, with additional ones from e.g., P. Fischer, Jeffreys, Dautzenberg, Kobelt, Pfeiffer, and Drouët. The second document (Hidalgo, 1918?) [Relación: MNCN Library F-II-5737] gives an overview of excerpts (translated in Spanish) of 47 correspondents who wrote favourable sentences about his work in letters addressed to Hidalgo. Although, unfortunately, the correspondence of Hidalgo has not been located, this document was used for a partial reconstruction of his network (Breure & Backhuys, 2017). Both documents had been printed and were apparently primarily aimed at Spanish readers. Hidalgo published his malacological manuscripts in the Journal de Conchyliologie, the Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales de Madrid, and the Sociedad Española de Historia Natural founded by Velasco, Martinez Molina and Zapater. Importantly, Crosse and Fischer helped Hidalgo in the drawing and publication of the plates of his manuscripts. In 1867 he published his first catalogue of Spanish marine molluscs. Afterwards, he published the books on the CCP molluscs with the plates made in Paris (see below). Thanks to Graells, in 1877, Hidalgo was admitted to the Real Academia de Ciencias Exactas, Físicas y Naturales and at the MNCN. He worked again at the University between 1888 and 1897 in botany, mineralogy and zoology, and in 1897 became full professor of mineralogy. He was also involved with the mineral collection at the MNCN. In 1900 he changed the professorship of mineralogy for one in molluscan zoogeography. Hidalgo was director of the MNCN from 3 July 1900 to 2 July 1901 (Barreiro, 1992: 301, 309). He donated his malacological library (c. 2,000 publications) and sold his shell collection to the MNCN in 1913 (Barreiro, 1992: 321, 455–457). In summary, he published 7,600 pages on malacology with 336 plates (made by Arnoul, Delahaye, Laporta and Arroyo) (Hidalgo, 1913?); a bibliography was published by Azpeitia (1923).\n\nFlorentino Azpeitia Moros (1859–1934; Fig. 8) was professor of geology and paleontology in the Escuela Especial de Ingenieros de Minas in Madrid. He was friendly with Hidalgo since 1883, when Azpeitia was treated by Hidalgo as a medical doctor because of gastric fever. From this point, the two men worked together on malacology, Hidalgo being the master and Azpeitia the disciple. He became member of the Sociedad Española de Historia Natural in 1897 for his studies in molluscs and diatoms. Azpeitia was the author of numerous scientific works on geology, botany and zoology; some of the most importance were his ‘Monografía de las Melanopsis vivientes de España’ (1929) and ‘Conchas bivalvas de agua dulce de España y Portugal’ (1933) (Álvarez Halcón, 1997; Álvarez Halcón, 1998). His molluscan collection, with 80,000 specimens of 8,171 species (6,594 gastropods and 1,577 bivalves) was donated to the MNCN in 1934 (Barreiro, 1992: 342).\n\nHippolyte Crosse (1826–1898; Fig. 9) studied law, but had an interest in natural history from a young age. After a trip to southern France, Corsica and Sicily in 1849, he devoted himself totally to malacology. The Journal de Conchyliologie had been established in 1850 by Petit de la Saussaye, but ceased to appear after a few years. In 1856 it was resurrected by P. Fischer and A.C. Bernardi, and in 1861 Crosse joined them, soon becoming managing director. Together with Fischer he made the journal one of the outstanding malacological journals of the late 19th century (Poyard in Poyard et al., 1898?: 3–6). As managing director he was in contact with all the major malacologists of the era, and received many type specimens of species published in the journal (Fischer-Piette, 1950). From his extensive correspondence with Hidalgo, we know that he also regularly received specimens of CCP material for his own collection, which was auctioned after his death (Breure & Backhuys, 2017; Tual & Fischer, 1899).\n\nLouis Pfeiffer (1804–1877; Fig. 10) studied medicine at the Universities of Göttingen and Marburg, after which he did postgraduate work in Paris and Berlin. In autumn 1826 he settled in his city of birth Kassel to practice medicine. After his first marriage in 1833 he gave up his medical practice and devoted himself to botany and malacology, making extensive excursions through Germany and the Low Countries. In 1838–1839 Pfeiffer made a trip to Cuba, together with Johannes Gundlach, which had a significant bearing on his future work. After his return to Germany he received further Cuban shells from Gundlach and Felipe Poey. Pfeiffer made frequent trips to Paris and London to consult literature not accessible in Kassel and to study the collections brought to Europe by the great French voyages, and especially those of Hugh Cuming in London. After the death of his youngest son during the Franco–Prussian war in 1870 his health was much impaired (Wheeler, 1949).\n\nRudolph Philippi (1808–1904; Fig. 11) was sent at a young age to Switzerland to have private education by the renowned Swiss philosopher Pestalozzi. He soon became interested in the flora and fauna, but graduated as a Doctor of Medicine in Berlin in 1830. During a visit to southern Italy in 1831–1833 he studied the molluscs and the geology of the region. In 1835 he got a position as professor at the Polytechnic Institute of Kassel. Soon afterwards he suffered from health problems and returned to Naples from 1837–1839. Due to the unstable political circumstances he decided to emigrate in 1850 and was appointed as professor of German in Valdivia, Chile. In 1853 he became director of the Museo Nacional de Historia natural in Santiago, as well as professor of botany and zoology at the University. In 1854 he was rejoined by his family, which also brought his library and scientific collections to Santiago. He made important contributions to the knowledge of the flora and fauna of Chile (Emig, 2015). On the 18th May 1863 the CCP members met with Philippi in the Santiago museum and they revised collections in the museum, made an excursion together with Philippi and their visit ended with a banquet on the1st June (Blanco, Rodríguez & Rodríguez, 2006: 112–114). Philippi named several species of plants and molluscs after CCP members (this study; Blanco, Rodríguez & Rodríguez, 2006: 264).\n\nThe ‘Comisión del Estudio de collecciones del Pacifico’\n\nWhen in 1868 in Spain a new, liberal government came to power that wanted to promote science (López-Ocón, 1997), attention for the CCP material was renewed after it had wained following the exhibition in 1866. A ‘Comisión de Estudio de las collecciones del Pacifico’ (CEcP) was established that aimed to study the materials collected by the CCP and publish the results. At its start on 14 January 1868, the CEcP consisted of Francisco Méndez Álvaro (president), Juan Villanova y Piera (vice-president), Francisco de Paula Martínez y Sáez (secretary), Manuel Almagro, Manuel de Galdo, Joaquin Hidalgo, Marcos Jiménez de la Espada, Sandalio Pereda, José Solano y Eulate, and Lucas de Tornos. In April 1868 the Ministry of Public Instruction asked for the completion of their task as soon as possible (Blanco, Rodríguez & Rodríguez, 2006: 260). The CEcP members complained about the short notice given and argued that they needed several years to produce good scientific results. They even recommended they should travel to several European countries for their studies. The minutes of the Committee, however, show that the study of the material did not progress very smoothly [Archive MNCN CN0042/755/001]. The members of the CEcP soon discovered that they lacked the literature to identify the material, and Hidalgo made a list of desired malacological publications. The list comprised 34 books and two journal series, covering all the important malacological works since the beginning of the 19th century [Archive MNCN CN0041/749/015]. Ten of these books, however, did not or only partially reached the CEcP [Archive MNCN CN0041/749/016]. Besides the new scientific books, these minutes of the Committee showed that the CCP material had generally been split into two collections, of which one was retained for the MNCN, and one was to be sent to other schools, institutes and Museums; we have found no information about the latter. During the Spanish revolution and the abdication of Isabel II in the Autumn of 1868, Méndez Álvaro and José Solano were ousted and the former replaced by the new President M. M. J. de Galdo. In November 1868 the new Committee decided to entrust to Martínez, Jímenez de la Espada and Hidalgo the elaboration of scientific papers on the CCP material to be published in 1869. The outlines for these scientific ‘Memorias’ were accorded by the CEcP members in June 1869. In November 1869 the Commission apparently had received some money from the Ministry, which they decided to spend partly for these publications (see also Breure & Backhuys, 2017). The minutes of the CEcP end with this meeting, suggesting less organisational activities in 1870 [Archive MNCN CN0042/755/001]. During that year, again as a result of political changes, President Galdo was replaced by Lucas Tornos. By order of the Ministry (Ministerio de Instrucción Pública) the CEcP was dissolved on the 1st August 1872 providing that the director of the MNCN would be dealing with all the zoological material from the CCP. Galdo protested against this dissolution and, after another political change, the members of the Committee were re-installed by the new Government in May 1873. However, work on the scientific publications stopped and the CEcP was again dissolved on the 30th June 1875. The zoological CCP material arrived to the MNCN in 1880 (Puig-Samper, 1988: 351–352).\n\nIt is likely that Hidalgo already started working on CCP material before this time, resulting in his 1867 paper. This may explain the ‘flux’ of the material: from Paz to Hidalgo to Azpeitia’s collections; we also found some specimens in the ‘Coll. Graells’ (i.e., historical collection of MNCN) which may have been used for exhibitions over time and which may have originated from the CCP material.\n\nThe Mollusca collected by the CCP\n\nFollowing Almagro (1866), who recorded the data for the exhibition of the CCP material in the Jardín Botánico, the collection of molluscs from the CCP comprised 816 different species, and 38,755 specimens, collected mainly by Paz and Martinez, and some by Jiménez de la Espada, Isern and Almagro. There were also 767 specimens belonging to 43 species of molluscs that had been be-gifted by Barreiros, Jameson, Philippi, Richardson, and Zameron. Grouped in another way, 741 specimens of marine bivalves, 300 of freshwater bivalves, 2,117 terrestrial gastropods, 1,277 freshwater gastropods and 2,557 marine gastropods were collected. There were also 975 specimens in 117 jars of alcohol preserved material, as was stipulated in the instructions for the expedition made by Graells (Puig-Samper, 1988). In 1868 and 1869 the collections of duplicate specimens were sent to several Spanish universities and institutes. In 1880 all the material collected by the CCP was moved to the MNCN (Puig-Samper, 1988). More detailed information on the localities and sources of the molluscs collected can be found in Puig-Samper (1988) and Calatayud (1994), and will be given below for the land molluscs.\n\nAll the Mollusca specimens of the CCP were studied by Martinez, who was responsible for molluscs during the expedition, and by Hidalgo (1893a, 1893b), with the exception of the freshwater bivalves that were studied by Lea (1866a, 1866b, 1867, 1869a, 1869b) and Haas; Haas, during his forced stay in Spain due to the unfavourable political climate in Germany (Haas, 1915), was invited to the MNCN where he studied the mussels collected by the CCP (Haas, 1916). Hidalgo and Martinez wrote the three volumes of the ‘Moluscos del viaje al Pacífico’, which included terrestrial gastropods (Hidalgo, 1872), marine bivalves (Martínez, 1879?), and marine gastropods (Hidalgo, 1879). There has been some confusion in the literature about the dates of publication, especially about the first part. Both the first and second parts have the date ‘1869’ printed on the title page, and this has generally been accepted by subsequent authors. The first part was published in Madrid by Cárlos Bailly-Baillière. The second and third parts bear the inscription on the title page ‘Imprenta de Miguel Ginesta’; the final volume appeared in 1879, and this date has been undisputed. As we know (Breure & Backhuys, 2017), the plates for the first and second part were executed in Paris and delivered in Madrid in November 1871. The text for the first part, however, still had to be finished by Hidalgo and this volume did not appear before December 1872. Hidalgo himself was aware of the potential problem of the discrepancy between the date on the title page (‘1869’) and the actual publication date. He inserted at the end of the text a ‘Note’ to draw attention to this discrepancy (Hidalgo, 1872: 152):\n\nNota. No concluida de imprimir la presente parte hasta 1872, esta es la verdadera fecha de publicación de nuestro libro y no la de 1869 que figura en la portada. Si el Gobierno de S. M. facilita medios necesarios para la impresión, ejecución de láminas, etc., del resto de la obra y si se nos indemniza del tiempo invertido en este trabajo, que hemos hecho sin sueldo ni gratificación alguna, daremos á conocer á nuestros lectores las demás especies de Moluscos recogidas por los naturalistas de la Comisión científica española.\n\n[Note. Not having finished the print of the present part until 1872, this is the true date of publication of our book and not 1869 as contained in the cover.\n\nIf the Government will provide the necessary means for printing, execution of plates, etc., [for] the rest of the work, and if we are indemnified [for] the time invested in this work, which we have done without any payment, we will disclose to our readers the rest of the species of molluscs collected by the members of the CCP]\n\nThis note means that the book of Martinez was not yet published in 1872 and, as Breure & Backhuys (2017) have shown, the actual date of publication was much later; it was published in 1879 or even later.\n\nFinally, it should be remarked that not only in the publications of Hidalgo, but also of others (notably Crosse), the suggestion was given that much of the CCP material was collected by Paz. This was only true in the cases where Paz actually visited the region; in other cases, after his premature return to Spain, Paz did not even visit some of the localities (e.g., Ecuador) but the material became nevertheless part of his collection or was misleadingly referred to as having been collected by him.\n\nLabels and handwriting\n\nThe material was found with labels that allowed its provenance to be ascertained, in most cases, unambiguously. The labels from the former Collection of Paz are characterised by a red frame; their locality data is usually more general than the data which has been published for the lot. The handwriting of these labels is in Hidalgo’s hand. One clear exception is a lot where the original label in the handwriting of Paz has very specific locality data, while only a very generalised locality has been published by Hidalgo. Compare Figs. 7A–7B for examples of handwriting of Paz and Hidalgo. In most cases, the labels bear the annotation “Cat. Am. mer. no. XYZ”; this refers to the catalogue published by Hidalgo (1870), which totalled 201 species (Hidalgo, 1870), increasing to 242 species (Hidalgo, 1893a; Hidalgo, 1893b). Labels from lots collected by Martínez bear his name and generally have a more precise locality; they all formed part of the former collection of Hidalgo. However, the handwriting is written in a hand unknown to us. In the former collection of Azpeitia the labels are small and Azpeitia’s handwriting (Figs. 8G–8H) was very fine and clear. Some labels had been glued to the shells, and generally this has been maintained with the addition of a modern label. In a few cases the original labels have been lost, and all the data is from modern labels. Generally, Azpeitia copied the localities from the data published by Hidalgo. Figure 8 gives an overview of all the styles of labels associated with the CCP material.\n\nSystematics\n\nRemarks. The numbers between square brackets following the taxon names refer to Supplementary file 1, column ‘nr.’ available on Figshare: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.4231904.v1.

In his 1853 publication he erroneously referred to “Proceed. Zool. Soc. 1851” [sic, 1852].

While this distinction may be gross and not apt for historical collections, where opercula may not have been preserved, it is here used by lack of better. It may be noted that only in a few lots of CCP material the opercula are present; in those cases they seem at least partially calcareous. The majority of the species is thus provisionally placed in Neocyclotus. Clearly, this group urgently needs a revision, preferably including molecular studies.\n\nGenus Buckleyia Higgins, 1872\n\nAperostoma (Buckleyia) Higgins, 1872: 686.\n\nType species. “Aperostoma montezumi Hidalgo” [Cyclophorus martinezi Hidalgo, 1866; see remarks], by monotypy.\n\nRemarks.

Helix unguis ‘Fer.’ was mentioned only by d’Orbigny (1835: 2), without description or reference; it is a nomen nudum. The figures in d’Orbigny (1834–1847) were published in the same year (1835), but the text only in 1837, allowing to make reference to Moricand (1836) who had recognized the species in material from Bahia; the CCP material originates from the same region and was probably collected during September 1862 (Calatayud, 1994: 249).\n\nGenus Succinea Draparnaud, 1801\n\nSuccinea Draparnaud, 1801: 32.\n\nType species.

However, since Paz did not visit Ecuador with the CCP, this material must have been collected by one of the other members. Since the publication of Breure & Araujo (2015) designating the lectotype, we have found now an additional specimen among the CCP material. This specimen has a damaged last whorl, which has slightly influenced the shape of the aperture; its is lighter in colour but otherwise matches the lectotype.\n\nPlekocheilus (Eurytus) cardinalis (Pfeiffer, 1853) [25]\n\n(Fig. 14B)\n\nBulimus cardinalis Pfeiffer, 1853: 316; Hidalgo, 1870: 55; Hidalgo, 1872: 92; Hidalgo, 1893a: 102; Hidalgo, 1893b: 219.\n\nType locality. “Quito”.\n\nType material.

Hidalgo ex Martínez y Saez leg., MNCN 15.05/36846 (2).\n\nRemarks. Hidalgo (1870) mentioned two localities “Environs de Quito (Paz); Napo, Equateur (Martínez)”; in his 1872 publication only the latter locality was mentioned. Compared to the syntype of this species (Borrero & Breure, 2011: figs. 15E–15F), the specimens from the CCP have a more thickened peristome and parietal callus.\n\nPlekocheilus (Eurytus) floccosus (Spix in Wagner, 1827) [26]\n\n(Fig. 14C)\n\nAchatina floccosa Spix in Wagner, 1827: 10, pl. 9 figs. 3–4.\n\nBulimus floccosus; Hidalgo, 1870: 61; Hidalgo, 1872: 127, pl. 7 figs. 1–4; Hidalgo, 1893a: 110; Hidalgo, 1893b: 215.\n\nType locality. “sylvis Provinciarum septemtrionalium Brasiliae”.\n\nType material.

Hidalgo said he had seen only three specimens, two not full-grown from his own collection and from the collection of Paz, and an adult specimen from the MNCN. However, we found two shells originating from the Coll. Paz. The shell from Hidalgo’s own collection is MNCN 15.05/76205, which corresponds to Hidalgo, 1872: pl. 7 figs. 3–4.\n\nPlekocheilus (Eurytus) jimenezi (Hidalgo, 1872) [27]\n\n(Figs. 14D–14E)\n\nBulimus gibbonius Hidalgo, 1870: 54; Hidalgo, 1875: 128.

Hidalgo has written on the label of MNCN 15.05/1066 “uno de los exemplars figurado”. Breure & Mogollón (2016: 18) have suggested that “San José” would be San José de Suno. The itinerary of Isern and Jimenez de Espada (Calatayud, 1994: 278) only mentions San José de Monti; this locality cannot be traced with modern gazetteers, but it is likely in the same general region.\n\nEtymology.

Of the three specimens the one figured herein seems to have been collected rather fresh and, although the peristome is unexpanded, seems to exhibit the features of this species the best. One specimen was found with locality data “Napo (Ecuador)”, Coll. Hidalgo ex Martínez, MNCN 15.05/7214, identified as this species, which appeared to be a specimen of Plekocheilus (Eudolichotis) distorta (Bruguière, 1792). This was likely not material collected by the CCP, as this species occurs in northern Venezuela; this region was not visited by the CCP.\n\nPlekocheilus (Eurytus) taylorianus (Reeve, 1849) [29]\n\n(Fig. 15B)\n\nBulimus taylorianus Reeve, 1849 [1848–1850]: pl. 81 fig. 602; Hidalgo, 1870: 54; Hidalgo, 1893a: 102.\n\nType locality.

Instead, the shell shape and colouration reminds us of Thaumastus (Thaumastiella) species and we tentatively identify this material as T. (T.) koepckei Zilch, 1953.\n\nSubgenus Thaumastus s. str.\n\nThaumastus (Thaumastus) achilles (Pfeiffer, 1853) [34]\n\n(Fig. 16C)\n\nBulimus achilles Pfeiffer, 1853: 378.\n\nBulimus thompsoni [sic] Pfeiffer; Hidalgo, 1870: 45; Hidalgo, 1893a: 91 [all partim].\n\nType locality.[Brazil] “in ripis fluvii Amazonum”.\n\nType material. NHMUK 1975286, lectotype (Breure, 1978: 32).\n\nMaterial examined. “Machahé”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 68)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13299 (2).\n\nRemarks. These species had been misidentified as “Bulimus thompsoni Pfr”, possibly because the locality was misinterpreted as Ecuadorian, while it is actually in Brazil.\n\nThaumastus (Thaumastus) cf. orcesi Weyrauch, 1967 [35]\n\n(Fig. 16D)\n\nThaumastus (Thaumastus) orcesi Weyrauch, 1967: 473, fig. 2.\n\nType locality. “Ecuador, cuenca del río Esmeraldas, 35 km al noroeste de Quito, region de Nanegal, 1,500 m”.\n\nType material. IFML-MOLL 3165, holotype (Breure, 2012: pl. 6 figs. 59–61).\n\nMaterial examined. “Loja, Equateur”, Coll. Hidalgo, MNCN 15.05/7567 (1).\n\nRemarks. This material was found undetermined in the Hidalgo collection, but has an original label in the handwriting of Paz; it is tentatively regarded as CCP material. The specimen is very similar to Weyrauch’s species, but was found at a disjunct locality.\n\nThaumastus (Thaumastus) foveolatus (Reeve, 1849) [36]\n\n(Fig. 16E)\n\nBulimus foveolatus Reeve, 1849 [1848–1850]: pl. 73 fig. 526; Hidalgo, 1870: 45; Hidalgo, 1872: 56, pl. 6 figs. 4–5; Hidalgo, 1893a: 92; Hidalgo, 1893b: 203.\n\nType locality. “Vitoe, near Sarma [sic, Tarma], Alto-Peru”.\n\nType material. NHMUK 1975275, lectotype (Breure, 1979: 44).\n\nMaterial examined.“Chanchamayo, Peru”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 71)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/3496 (2); “Chanchamayo, Peru”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13497 (1); “Chanchamayo (Perú)”, Coll. Hidalgo ex Isern leg., MNCN 15.05/36922 (4); “Pacifico 71”, Coll. Hidalgo, MNCN 15.05/36921 (2).\n\nRemarks. The lot with the single specimen corresponds to the one which Hidalgo mentioned to have spiral lines on the last whorl. This is caused by a shell repair at the beginning of the last whorl. All material was collected by Isern, who was the only CCP member to visit the Chanchamayo region in autumn 1863 (Calatayud, 1994: 257).\n\nThaumastus (Thaumastus) hartwegi (Pfeiffer in Philippi, 1846) [37]\n\n(Fig. 16F)\n\nBulimus hartwegi Pfeiffer in Philippi, 1846 [1845–1847]: 111, pl. 4 fig. 1; Hidalgo, 1870: 44; Hidalgo, 1872: 64, pl. 4 figs. 4–5; Hidalgo, 1893a: 91; Hidalgo, 1893b: 241.\n\nType locality.“respublica [sic] Aequatoris, ubi ad ‘El Catamaija’ prope Loxa”.\n\nType material.

Hidalgo ex Jameson, MNCN 15.05/36942 (1); “Cuenca (Ecuador)”, Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/14296 (1).\n\nRemarks. The material was mentioned as “Hab. Quito et Cuenca, Équateur (Paz)” by Hidalgo (1870); it agrees with the variation observed in this taxon. The specimen from lot MNCN 15.05/36945 was figured in Hidalgo, 1872: pl. 4 figs. 4–5.\n\nThaumastus (Thaumastus) largillierti (Philippi, 1845) [38]\n\n(Fig. 17A)\n\nBulimus largillierti Philippi, 1845 [1845–1847]: 11, pl. 3 fig. 6.\n\nBulimus taunaisii Férussac; Hidalgo, 1870: 45; Hidalgo, 1872: 66; Hidalgo, 1893a: 91; Hidalgo, 1893b: 204 [all partim].\n\nType locality. “Brasilien, Santa Catarina”.\n\nType material.

Hidalgo, MNCN 15.05/36934 (1); “Brasil”, Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/7327 (3).\n\nRemarks. This species, of which the lectotype was recently re-figured by Breure & Mogollón, 2016: figs. 27C–27E, is likely restricted to eastern Brazil.\n\nThaumastus (Thaumastus) taunaisii (Férussac, 1822) [40]\n\n(Fig. 17C)\n\nHelix (Cochlostyla) taunaisii Férussac, 1822 [ 1821–1822]: 48.\n\nBulimus taunaisii; Hidalgo, 1870: 45; Hidalgo, 1872: 66; Hidalgo, 1893a: 91; Hidalgo, 1893b: 204 [all partim].\n\nType locality.

From the labels and further information from the correspondence between Hidalgo and Crosse (Breure & Backhuys, 2017), it may be inferred Hidalgo had two specimens when he was making the Catalogue of the CCP material (Hidalgo, 1870). One specimen was sent to Crosse for description and returned to Hidalgo; both specimens are considered as belonging to the original series. The specimen from the Azpeitia collection undoubtedly originates from Hidalgo, but is not considered as type material since it cannot be ensured it was already in his possession during 1869.\n\nGenusCorona Albers, 1850\n\nAchatina (Corona) Albers, 1850: 193.\n\nType species. Helix (Cochlitoma) regina Férussac, 1821, by subsequent designation (Martens in Albers, 1860: 226).\n\nCorona pfeifferi (Hidalgo, 1869) [42]\n\n(Fig. 18B)\n\nOrthalicus pfeifferi Hidalgo, 1869c: 412; Hidalgo, 1870: 65, pl. 6 fig. 8; Hidalgo, 1872: 135, pl. 8 figs. 3–4; Hidalgo, 1893a: 56, 113; Hidalgo, 1893b: 292; Azpeitia, 1923: 80; Baratech et al., 1993: 217.\n\nCorona pfeifferi; Breure & Mogollón, 2016: 50, figs. 41A–41E, 43, 89A.\n\nType locality.[Ecuador] “Canelos, reipublicae Aequatoris”.\n\nType material.“Canelos, Ecuador”, Coll. Paz, MACN 15.05/3280 (1), syntype. Coll. Hidalgo, MNCN 15.05/18985 (2).\n\nRemarks. Although the material was said to have been collected by Martinez (Baratech et al., 1993), the actual collector was Almagro in June 1865 (Calatayud, 1994: 240 (note 173), 280).\n\nEtymology. Named after Louis Pfeiffer.\n\nCorona regalis (Hupé, 1857) [43]\n\n(Figs. 19A–19B)\n\nBulimus regalis Hupé, 1857: 34, pl. 10 fig. 3.\n\nOrthalicus bensoni Reeve; Hidalgo, 1870: 64; Hidalgo, 1872: 133, pl. 7 fig. 13; Hidalgo, 1893a: 113; Hidalgo, 1893b: 289.\n\nOrthalicus regina Férussac; Hidalgo, 1870: 64; Hidalgo, 1872: 134; Hidalgo, 1893a: 113; Hidalgo, 1893b: 293.\n\nType locality.“le Brésil”.\n\nType material.

Hidalgo ex Martínez leg. “Ejemplar figurado”, MNCN 15.05/61001 (1).\n\nRemarks. Lot MNCN 15.05/18964 comprises one adult shell and one juvenile; both are sinistral. The systematic position follows the provisional scheme of Breure & Mogollón (2016: 48), awaiting a thorough revision of the genus. The dextral specimen of lot MNCN 15.05/61001 shows superficial resemblance to Orthalicus bensoni (Reeve, 1849), but they lack the fine spiral striation which is present on the type (Breure & Mogollón, 2016: fig. 48C), are more slender, and have the aperture more elongate-ovate. The specimen is herin tentatively referred to Corona regalis (Hupé, 1857), of which the type material has not been located. The original figure (Breure & Mogollón, 2016: fig. 42A) shows a sinistral specimen, but it is known that eniantomorphy occurs within this species (cf. Breure & Mogollón, 2016: figs. 84A–84B). Compared to these figures, the specimen shows three, small spiral bands.\n\nGenusKara Strebel, 1910\n\nThaumastus (Kara) Strebel, 1910: 16.\n\nType species.

Hidalgo (1870) reported this species from “Machache et Cuenca, Equateur (Paz)”. In Hidalgo (1872) only the latter locality was mentioned, as ‘Machache’ was likely an error for the Brazilian locality Macahé. This material was not collected by the CCP members themselves as they did not visit Cuenca (Calatayud, 1994); according to Almagro (1866: 164) these shells were a gift from “Yameson” [Jameson] (cf. Calatayud, 1994: 203, 207).\n\nGenus Orthalicus Beck, 1837\n\nOrthalicus Beck, 1837: 59.\n\nType species.

Hidalgo (1870) mentioned both material from the Paz and Martínez collections, each with different and more precise localities (“La Mocha et Guaranda” respectively “île de Puna et Macas”). The material of the former two localities was collected by Jímenez de la Espada and Isern in November 1864 (Calatayud, 1994: 268).\n\nSubgenusPorphyrobaphe s.str.\n\nPorphyrobaphe (Porphyrobaphe) iostoma (Sowerby I, 1824) [48]\n\n(Fig. 20A)\n\nBulimus iostoma Sowerby I, 1824: 58, pl. 5 fig. 1; Hidalgo, 1870: 44; Hidalgo, 1872: 60, pl. 5 figs. 7–8; Hidalgo, 1893a: 90; Hidalgo, 1893b: 285.\n\nType locality.

Am. mer. no. 121)” was apparently misplaced. Possibly these shells were among the material listed by Isern (“28 Bulimus y 4 en alcohol”), collected near Acobamba on the 8th October 1863 (Blanco, Rodríguez & Rodríguez, 2006: 143).\n\nScholvienia bifasciata (Philippi, 1845) [50]\n\n(Fig. 20C)\n\nBulimus bifasciatus Philippi, 1845 [1845–1847]: 10, pl. 3 fig. 5; Hidalgo, 1870: 46; Hidalgo, 1872: 68; Hidalgo, 1893a: 92; Hidalgo, 1893b: 209.\n\nType locality.

Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/76216 (1).\n\nRemarks. Hidalgo (1870) wrote “Trouvé sur le chemin de Quito, à 30 ou 40 kilomètres de Chimborazo (Paz)”. Probably collected by Almagro or Isern during their trip from Guayaquil to Quito (Calatayud, 1994: 268).\n\nSultana (Metorthalicus) kellettii ( Reeve, 1850) [55]\n\n(Fig. 21C)\n\nBulimus kellettii Reeve, 1850 [1848–1850]: pl. 89 fig. 661.\n\nBulimus fungairinoi Hidalgo, 1867: 72, pl. 4 fig. 4, 478; Hidalgo, 1870: 44; Hidalgo, 1872: 58, pl. 3 figs. 8–9; Hidalgo, 1893a: 90; Hidalgo, 1893b: 285; Azpeitia, 1923: 58; Fischer-Piette, 1950: 68.\n\nBulimus jungairignoi [sic] Baratech et al., 1993: 215.\n\nSultana (Metorthalicus) kellettii; Breure & Mogollón, 2016: 75, figs. 73A, 79A–79B, 80.\n\nType locality. “Ecuador?”.\n\nType material. NHMUK 1975241, lectotype (Breure & Schouten, 1985: 28).\n\nAdditional type material. “Cuenca (Ecuador)”, Coll. Hidalgo ex Jamieson, MNCN 15.05/3159 (2); “Ecuador”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 65)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/6881 (1), syntypes of Bulimus fungairinoi Hidalgo.\n\nMaterial examined.“Quito, Ecuador”, Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/3162 (1); “Cuenca, Ecuador”, Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/3161 (1); “Cuenca, Ecuador”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/3160 (1).\n\nRemarks. This species was initially published as Bulimus jungairinoi, but Hidalgo made Crosse correct this in the index (p. 478); see also Breure & Backhuys, 2017. This correction has to be considered as a lapsus calami (Art. 32.5.1.1 ICZN Code). The material was not collected by the CCP members themselves, but was a gift of J. Jameson (cf. Calatayud, 1994: 203).\n\nEtymology. Hidalgo named his taxon after Eduardo Fungairiño, a befriended Madrid-based malacologist (Breure & Backhuys, 2017).\n\nSultana (Metorthalicus) yatesi yatesi (Pfeiffer, 1855) [56]\n\n(Fig. 21D)\n\nBulimus yatesi Pfeiffer, 1855: 93, pl. 31 fig. 5; Hidalgo, 1872: 59; Hidalgo, 1893a: 125.\n\nType locality. [Peru] “Meobamba”.\n\nType material. NHMUK 1975239, lectotype (Breure & Schouten, 1985: 28).\n\nMaterial examined. “Ecuador”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. […])”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13504 (1).\n\nRemarks. Hidalgo (1893) published this species with locality data “República del Peru (Almagro)”. The species is known to occur in northern Peru at the eastern side of the Andes, but the subspecies Sultana (Metorthalicus) yatesi galactostoma (Ancey, 1890) has been reported from Ecuador without specific locality (Breure & Mogollón, 2016). These authors also reported a record for the nominate taxon from the Chanchamayo valley. In any case, there is no evidence this material was collected by Almagro, who has not travelled in Peru in areas where this species does occur. If the label “Ecuador” has to be trusted, it is likely this specimen was collected on the eastern slopes of the Cordillera.\n\nFamily Odontostomidae Pilsbry & Vanatta, 1898\n\nGenus Anctus Martens in Albers, 1860\n\nAnctus Martens in Albers, 1860: 214.\n\nType species.

Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/8074 (2).\n\nRemarks. The material was listed in Hidalgo (1870) as “Huasco, Chili (Martínez); Paposo, Bolivia (Paz)”; both localities are in present-day Chile. Therefore, lot MNCN 15.05/13467 is likely also from Paposo; lot MNCN 15.05/8074 may have originated from Martínez, but reference to his name has been lost. See Calatayud, 1994: 258 for the itinerary in northern Chile.\n\nPlectostylus chilensis (Lesson in Lesson, Garnot & Guérin-Méneville, 1830) [71]\n\n(Fig. 23D)\n\nBulimus chilensis Lesson in Lesson et al., 1830 [1826–1831]: pl. 7 fig. 3; Hidalgo, 1870: 55; Hidalgo, 1872: 103; Hidalgo, 1893a: 103; Hidalgo, 1893b: 227.\n\nType locality.

The shape of the aperture and the colouration of the peristome makes us identify this specimen as Jay’s species (Simone, 2006: fig. 425). The sculpture on the ventral side of the last whorl is stronger than in his figure.\n\nAuris illheocola (Moricand, 1836) [79]\n\n(Fig. 24D)\n\nHelix (Cochlogena) rhodospira var. illheocola Moricand, 1836: 428.\n\nBulimus illheocola; Hidalgo, 1893a: 123.\n\nType locality. [Brazil] “Illheos”.\n\nType material. MHNG-INVE-60171 (6), syntypes; MHNG-INVE-60169 (2), probable syntypes.\n\nMaterial examined. “Brasil”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13277 (1); “Brasil”, “224”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/36926 (3).\n\nAuris melastoma (Swainson, 1820) [80]\n\n(Fig. 24C)\n\nBulimus melastomus Swainson, 1820 [1820–1821]: pl. 4; Hidalgo, 1870: 46; Hidalgo, 1893a: 93.\n\nType locality. “Brazil, in the province of Bahia”.\n\nType material. Not located.\n\nMaterial examined.“Brasil”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 79)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13477 (2); “Rio Janeiro, Brasil”, Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/8108 (2).\n\nRemarks. Hidalgo (1893a) reported the species from “Rio Janeiro, en el Brasil (Martinez)”.\n\nGenus Bostryx Troschel, 1847\n\nBulimus (Bostryx) Troschel, 1847: 49.\n\nType species. Bulimus (Bostryx) solutus Troschel, 1847, by monotypy.\n\nBostryx aequicostatus (Rehder, 1945) [81]\n\n(Fig. 25A)\n\nBulimus scalarioides Philippi in Pfeiffer, 1867: 77; Hidalgo, 1870: 53; Hidalgo, 1893a: 101; Hidalgo, 1875: 128, pl. 7 fig. 4; Hidalgo, 1893a: 101. Not Bulimus scalarioides Reeve, 1849.\n\nPeronaeus aequicostata Rehder, 1945: 106.\n\nType locality. [Peru] “provincia Conchucos”.\n\nType material. Not located.\n\nMaterial examined. “Peru”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 117)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/14546 (3).\n\nRemarks. Hidalgo (1870) gave as locality “Pataz, Pérou (Paz)”, which is in northern Peru, Dept. La Libertad. He compared the shells with Bostryx scalaricosta (Morelet, 1863), which is a species from southern Peru and clearly distinct (cf. Breure, 2016: fig. 98). Rehder (1945: 106) noticed the name Bulimus scalarioides Philippi in Pfeiffer, 1867 was preoccupied by Bulimus scalarioides Reeve, 1849, and introduced Peronaeus aequicostata Rehder, 1945 as a replacement name. Philippi described his taxon from “provincia Conchucos”, which is in Dept. Ancash ca. 60 km west of the locality mentioned by Hidalgo (1870). It may be noted that the itinerary of the CCP members does not mention this region (Calatayud, 1994), hence it is unclear who collected this material. The shells, however, correspond to Philippi’s description. Weyrauch (1964: fig. 13) has figured one of the shells from the original series collected by Raimondi, now IFML-MOLL 1223a.\n\nBostryx affinis (Broderip in Broderip & Sowerby I, 1832) [82]\n\n(Fig. 26A)\n\nBulinus affinis Broderip in Broderip & Sowerby I, 1832b: 106.\n\nBulimus affinis; Hidalgo, 1870: 60.\n\nType locality. “in Peruviâ (Mexillones, desert of Atacama)”.\n\nType material. NHMUK 20100610 (5), possible syntypes.\n\nMaterial examined. “Bolivia”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 162)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13170 (5), MNCN 15.05/13171 (5).\n\nRemarks. According to Hidalgo (1870) the material was collected at “Paposo, Bolivia (Paz)”; this is in present-day Chile. The specimens appear to be partly subadult and juvenile.\n\nBostryx albicans (Broderip in Broderip and Sowerby I, 1832) [83]\n\n(Fig. 26B)\n\nBulinus albicans Broderip in Broderip & Sowerby I, 1832b: 105.\n\nBulimus albicans; Hidalgo, 1870: 52; Hidalgo, 1872: 84; Hidalgo, 1875: 128; Hidalgo, 1893a: 100.\n\nType locality. “Copiapo, Chili”.\n\nType material. NHMUK 20100611 (5), possible syntypes.\n\nMaterial examined.“Chile”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 111)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13162 (6); “Huasco (Chile)”, Coll. Hidalgo ex Martínez, MNCN 15.05/19967 (21); “Huasco, Chile”, Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/8068 (5).\n\nRemarks. The locality mentioned in Hidalgo (1870) is “Huasco, Chili (Paz et Martínez)”. In his 1872 publication Hidalgo treated this taxon as a variety (“Testa minor”) of Bulimus albus (=Bostryx erythrostomus; see below).\n\nBostryx anachoreta (Pfeiffer, 1856) [84]\n\n(Fig. 26C)\n\nBulimus anachoreta Pfeiffer, 1856: 208; Hidalgo, 1870: 56.\n\nType locality. [Chile] “Paposo in desert Atacamensi reipublicae Chilensis”.\n\nType material. ZMB 112729 (2), syntypes.\n\nMaterial examined. “Bolivia”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 141)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13173 (7); “Paposo”, Coll. Hidalgo, MNCN 15.05/19981 (2); Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/8067 (5); “Paposo, Bolivia”, Coll. Azpeitia, MNCN 15.05/8445 (2).\n\nRemarks. The material from the Hidalgo and Azpeitia collections are supposed to have been originated from the CCP-material. Lot MNCN 15.05/8445 is only tentatively referred to this species.\n\nBostryx atacamensis (Pfeiffer, 1856) [85]\n\n(Fig. 26D)\n\nBulimus atacamensis Pfeiffer, 1856: 207; Hidalgo, 1870: 57; Hidalgo, 1872: 100; Hidalgo, 1875: 128, pl. 7 fig. 5; Hidalgo, 1893a: 105.\n\nType locality.

This material is unicoloured and corresponds in this respect with Naesiotus fontainii (d’Orbigny, 1838) (Breure & Ablett, 2014: 78, fig. 16H), but have a protoconch sculpture of excessive fine, spiral lines, which classifies them as Bostryx. In one specimen a very faint light peripheral girdle may be discerned, which corresponds to Sowerby’s taxon (Köhler, 2007: fig. 21). Both Sowerby’s and d’Orbigny’s taxa have about the same shell height and may thus be easily misinterpreted.\n\nBostryx conspersus (Sowerby I, 1833) [87]\n\n(Fig. 25C)\n\nBulinus conspersus Sowerby I, 1833: 67.\n\nBulimus conspersus; Hidalgo, 1870: 60; Hidalgo, 1872: 125\n\nType locality.

[Chile] “apud Huasco, Chilae”.\n\nType material. ZMB 10273 (2), ZMB 41572 (2), ZMB 114329 (1), probable syntypes.\n\nMaterial examined.“Chile”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 119)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/12996 (4); “Coquimbo”, “(Cat. Am. mer. no. 120)”, Coll. Paz, MNCN 15.05/13202 (5); “Coquimbo”, Coll. Hidalgo ex Martínez, MNCN 15.05/19964 (6); “Huasco”, Coll. Hidalgo ex Martínez, MNCN 15.05/19963 (11).\n\nRemarks. Hidalgo (1870) mentioned as localities “Chamarcillo (Paz), Huasco et Coquimbo (Paz et Martínez), Chili”. In his 1872 publication, he only mentioned the two latter localities. The specimens which had been identified as Bulimus albus by Hidalgo, are entirely white both inside and outside (cf. Araya, 2015: fig. 5).\n\nBostryx hamiltoni ( Reeve, 1849) [90]\n\n(Fig. 26E)\n\nBulimus hamiltoni Reeve, 1849 [1848–1850]: pl. 83 fig. 610.\n\nType locality. “Near the Lake of Titicaca, Bolivia”.\n\nType material.
