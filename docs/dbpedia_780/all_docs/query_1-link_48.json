        "text": "What is a web accessibility overlay?\n\nOverlays are a broad term for technologies that aim to improve the accessibility of a website. They apply third-party source code (typically JavaScript) to make improvements to the front-end code of the website.\n\nWebsite add-on products claiming to improve accessibility go back to the late 1990s with products like Readspeaker and Browsealoud. They added text-to-speech capabilities to the website(s) on which they were installed.\n\nThen similar products came to market that added more tools to their software. These allow user-based control of things like font-sizes and colors to improve readability.\n\nSome newer overlay products aim to fix any problems in the site’s code that are preventing assistive technology from being used easily. They apply a script to the page which scans the code and automatically attempts to repair the problem.\n\nSome examples of web accessibility overlays (by alphabetical order):\n\nAccessiBe\n\nAccessibility Adapter\n\nAccessiblelink\n\nAccessiplus\n\nAccessiway\n\nAdally\n\nAdapte Mon Web (Adapt my Web)\n\nAdaptifY\n\nAllyable\n\nAlchemy*\n\nAmaze\n\nAudioEye\n\nBakh Fix\n\nDIGIaccess\n\nEye-Able.com\n\nEqually.ai\n\nEqualWeb\n\nFACIL'iti\n\nMaxAccess\n\nPoloda AI\n\nPurple Lens\n\nReciteME\n\nRentCafe\n\nSentinel*\n\nTruAbilities\n\nTrue Accessibility\n\nUsableNet Assistive\n\nUserWay\n\nWebAbility\n\n*: denotes that these products are no longer developed or marketed.\n\nOverlay products are sometimes white labelled (sold under other names), or re-branded for certain markets, so this is not a complete list of the type of products discussed on this page.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of overlay “widgets”\n\nOverlay widgets are unnecessary and are poorly placed in the technology stack.\n\nAs stated above, some overlay products contain widgets which present a series of controls that modify the presentation of the page they’re on. Depending on the product, those changes may do things like change the page contrast, enlarge the size of the page’s text, or perform other changes to the page that are intended to improve the experience for users with disabilities.\n\nTo laypersons, these features may seem beneficial, but their practical value is largely overstated because the end users that these features claim to serve will already have the necessary features on their computer, either as a built-in feature or as an additional piece of software that the user needs to access not only the Web but all software.\n\nOn this latter point, it is a mistake to believe that the features provided by the overlay widget will be of much use by end users because if those features were necessary to use the website, they’d be needed for all websites that the user interacts with. Instead, the widget is —at best—redundant functionality with what the user already has.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of automated repair\n\nWhile some automated repair is possible, customers should be discouraged from using an overlay as a long-term solution.\n\nSome overlay products have capabilities aimed at providing accessibility repairs to the underlying page on which the overlay is added. These repairs are applied when the page loads in the user’s browser.\n\nWhile it is true that a non-trivial array of accessibility problems can be repaired in this manner, the nature, extent, and accuracy of such repair are limited by a number of important factors:\n\nAutomated application of text alternatives for images is not reliable\n\nAutomated repair of field labels, error management, error handling, and focus control on forms is not reliable\n\nAutomated repair of keyboard access is not reliable\n\nModern, component-based user interfaces, such as those using ReactJS, Angular, or Vue may change the state of all or some of the underlying page independently of the overlay, rendering it unable to fix those JavaScript-driven changes to content\n\nRepairs to the page can either slow down page load times or cause unexpected page changes for assistive technology users.\n\nIn addition to the above, overlays do not repair content in Flash, Java, Silverlight, PDF, HTML5 Canvas, SVG, or media files.\n\nFitness for achieving compliance with accessibility standards\n\nWhile the use of an overlay may improve compliance with a handful of provisions in major accessibility standards, full compliance cannot be achieved with an overlay.\n\nAmong the many claims made by overlay vendors is the claim that the use of their product will bring the site into compliance with accessibility standards such as WCAG 2.x, related and derivative standards, and laws that mandate compliance with those standards.\n\nConformance to a standard means that you meet or satisfy the ‘requirements’ of the standard. In WCAG 2.0 the ‘requirements’ are the Success Criteria. To conform to WCAG 2.0, you need to satisfy the Success Criteria, that is, there is no content which violates the Success Criteria. Understanding WCAG 2.1: Understanding Conformance\n\nGiven that conformance is defined as meeting all requirements of the standard, these products’ documented inability to repair all possible issues means that they cannot bring a website into compliance. Products marketed with such claims should be viewed with significant skepticism.\n\nPrivacy of personal data\n\nAdding an overlay to your site may run counter to end users’ preference for privacy and may create risk of noncompliance with GDPR, UK GDPR, CCPA, et al.\n\nOverlays that automatically enable certain settings, like those for screen reader or speech recognition users, do so by detecting when an assistive technology is running on the device. This exposes the fact that the person using the device at the time has a disability. In certain cases, like screen reader users where the majority are blind or have low vision, it exposes even more detail about the nature of their disability. Like age, ethnic background, or preferred gender, disability is sensitive personal information. It is not data that should be collected without the informed consent of the person it belongs to.\n\nSome overlays have been found to persist users’ settings across sites which use the same overlay. This is done by setting a cookie on the user’s computer. When the user enables a setting for an overlay feature on one site, the overlay will automatically turn on that feature on other sites. While the overlay company might think they’re doing good by the end user, the big privacy problem is that the user never opted in to be tracked and there’s also no ability to opt-out. Due to this lack of an opt-out (other than explicitly turning off that setting) this creates General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) risk for the overlay customer."
