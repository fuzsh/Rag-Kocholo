The two Smith girls and Miss Maas had been bathing for some little time, and suddenly stepped off into deep water and cried for help. Wachholz, who was eating his lunch with the others in his party near the shore was attracted by the girls' cries. Not waiting to remove any of his clothing he plunged into the water and swam to their aid. He was a good swimmer, but suddenly he was seen to disappear from sight together with the three girls. He had just reached the three struggling girl swimmers and horrified watchers on the shore, which included his wife, saw Wachholz carried under the water. Clothing a Handicap He was handicapped by his clothing, now weighted with water and was unable to free himself from the grasp of the girls. Rosemary Holtoman, 14, another member of the swimming party was pulled to safety by Stoffey Hugenroth of Sturgeon Bay. The Sturgeon Bay coast guard were notified and responded, recovering the bodies of Wachholz and the three girls after dragging for two hours.
