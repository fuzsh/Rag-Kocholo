I think he had picked a quiet morning to go up on the roof to find some lead. He didn't realise he was getting caught in one of the old street pics !\n\nA Sparks, thanks for your information I had already found it here. I hope there is more to tell / find about this company, because there is little that can be found on the internet\n\nIt's strange isn't it - very little at all!\n\nAnother member may be able to find some more info for you - I think members have access to our old Kelly's Directories to check dates they were at that address.\n\nThe company did not start in Great charles St, and , because the year in Kellys is the publication date, not the survey date, I believe the company may have started at least a year before 1878.\n\n1876 No mention\n\n1878-1882 Hills Menke & Co, iron, metal, tinplate , iron wire & and hardware merchants, 5 Carrs Lane\n\n1883-1892 Hills Menke & Co, iron, metal, tinplate , & and hardware merchants, 8 Great Charles St\n\n1895 Hills Menke & Co, iron, metal, tinplate ,hardware & and general merchants, 154 Great Charles St\n\n1897-1915 Hills Menke & Co, merchants, 154 Great Charles St\n\n1921 J Browne Wilson & sons,. export merchants, 154 Great Charles St\n\nThe change in address from 8 to 154 was real, and not due to renumbering.\n\nMenke was listed as German Consul in Kellys from 1908-1912, but not in 1904 edition"
