These guidelines, which are based on systematic methods to evaluate and classify evidence, provide a foundation for the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. The ACC and AHA sponsor the development and publication of clinical practice guidelines without commercial support, and members volunteer their time to the writing and review efforts.\n\nClinical practice guidelines provide recommendations applicable to patients with or at risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD). The focus is on medical practice in the United States, but these guidelines are relevant to patients throughout the world. Although guidelines may be used to inform regulatory or payer decisions, the intent is to improve quality of care and align with patients’ interests. Guidelines are intended to define practices meeting the needs of patients in most, but not all, circumstances, and should not replace clinical judgment.\n\nRecommendations for guideline-directed management and therapy, which encompasses clinical evaluation, diagnostic testing, and both pharmacological and procedural treatments, are effective only when followed by both practitioners and patients. Adherence to recommendations can be enhanced by shared decision-making between clinicians and patients, with patient engagement in selecting interventions on the basis of individual values, preferences, and associated conditions and comorbidities.\n\nThe ACC/AHA Task Force on Clinical Practice Guidelines strives to ensure that the guideline writing committee both contains requisite expertise and is representative of the broader medical community by selecting experts from a broad array of backgrounds, representing different geographic regions, sexes, races, ethnicities, intellectual perspectives/biases, and scopes of clinical practice, and by inviting organizations and professional societies with related interests and expertise to participate as partners or collaborators. The ACC and AHA have rigorous policies and methods to ensure that documents are developed without bias or improper influence. The complete policy on relationships with industry and other entities (RWI) can be found online.\n\nBeginning in 2017, numerous modifications to the guidelines have been and continue to be implemented to make guidelines shorter and enhance “user friendliness.” Guidelines are written and presented in a modular knowledge chunk format, in which each chunk includes a table of recommendations, a brief synopsis, recommendation-specific supportive text and, when appropriate, flow diagrams or additional tables. Hyperlinked references are provided for each modular knowledge chunk to facilitate quick access and review. More structured guidelines–including word limits (“targets”) and a web guideline supplement for useful but noncritical tables and figures–are 2 such changes. This Preamble is an abbreviated version, with the detailed version available online. The reader is encouraged to consult the full-text guidelineP-1 for additional guidance and details, since the executive summary contains mainly the recommendations.\n\nKeywords: AHA Scientific Statements, Guidelines, biomarkers, coronary artery calcium score, pharmacological; cardiovascular disease, cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, diabetes mellitus, drug therapy, hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibitors/statins, hypercholesterolemia, lipids, patient compliance, primary prevention, risk assessment, risk reduction discussion, risk treatment discussion, secondary prevention, ezetimibe, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitor (PCSK9) inhibitors\n\nTOP 10 TAKE-HOME MESSAGES TO REDUCE RISK OF ATHEROSCLEROTIC CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE THROUGH CHOLESTEROL MANAGEMENT\n\nIn all individuals, emphasize a heart-healthy lifestyle across the life course. A healthy lifestyle reduces atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk at all ages. In younger individuals, healthy lifestyle can reduce development of risk factors and is the foundation of ASCVD risk reduction. In young adults 20 to 39 years of age, an assessment of lifetime risk facilitates the clinician–patient risk discussion (see No. 6) and emphasizes intensive lifestyle efforts. In all age groups, lifestyle therapy is the primary intervention for metabolic syndrome.\n\nIn patients with clinical ASCVD, reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with high-intensity statin therapy or maximally tolerated statin therapy. The more LDL-C is reduced on statin therapy, the greater will be subsequent risk reduction. Use a maximally tolerated statin to lower LDL-C levels by ≥50%.\n\nIn very high-risk ASCVD, use a LDL-C threshold of 70 mg/dL (1.8 mmol/L) to consider addition of nonstatins to statin therapy. Very high-risk includes a history of multiple major ASCVD events or 1 major ASCVD event and multiple high-risk conditions. In very high-risk ASCVD patients, it is reasonable to add ezetimibe to maximally tolerated statin therapy when the LDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L). In patients at very high risk whose LDL-C level remains ≥70 mg/dL(≥1.8 mmol/L) on maximally tolerated statin and ezetimibe therapy, adding a PCSK9 inhibitor is reasonable, although the long-term safety (>3 years) is uncertain and cost effectiveness is low at mid-2018 list prices.\n\nIn patients with severe primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C level ≥190 mg/dL [=4.9 mmol/L]), without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk, begin high-intensity statin therapy. If the LDL-C level remains ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.6 mmol/L), adding ezetimibe is reasonable. If the LDL-C level on statin plus ezetimibe remains ≥100 mg/dL (≥2.6 mmol/L) and the patient has multiple factors that increase subsequent risk of ASCVD events, a PCSK9 inhibitor may be considered, although the long-term safety (>3 years) is uncertain and economic value is low at mid-2018 list prices.\n\nIn patients 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus and LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), start moderate-intensity statin therapy without calculating 10-year ASCVD risk. In patients with diabetes mellitus at higher risk, especially those with multiple risk factors or those 50 to 75 years of age, it is reasonable to use a high-intensity statin to reduce the LDL-C level by ≥50%.\n\nIn adults 40 to 75 years of age evaluated for primary ASCVD prevention, have a clinician–patient risk discussion before starting statin therapy. Risk discussion should include a review of major risk factors (eg, cigarette smoking, elevated blood pressure, LDL-C, hemoglobin A1C [if indicated], and calculated 10-year risk of ASCVD); the presence of risk-enhancing factors (see No. 8); the potential benefits of lifestyle and statin therapies; the potential for adverse effects and drug–drug interactions; consideration of costs of statin therapy; and patient preferences and values in shared decision-making.\n\nIn adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/ dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5%, start a moderate-intensity statin if a discussion of treatment options favors statin therapy. Risk-enhancing factors favor statin therapy (see No. 8). If risk status is uncertain, consider using coronary artery calcium (CAC) to improve specificity (see No. 9). If statins are indicated, reduce LDL-C levels by ≥30%, and if 10-year risk is ≥20%, reduce LDL-C levels by ≥50%.\n\nIn adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and 10-year risk of 7.5% to 19.9% (intermediate risk), risk-enhancing factors favor initiation of statin therapy (see No. 7). Risk-enhancing factors include family history of premature ASCVD; persistently elevated LDL-C levels ≥160 mg/dL (≥4.1 mmol/L); metabolic syndrome; chronic kidney disease; history of preeclampsia or premature menopause (age <40 years); chronic inflammatory disorders (eg, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, or chronic HIV); high-risk ethnic groups (eg, South Asian); persistent elevations of triglycerides ≥175 mg/dL (≥1.97 mmol/L); and, if measured in selected individuals, apolipoprotein B ≥130 mg/dL, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein ≥2.0 mg/L, ankle-brachial index (ABI) <0.9 and lipoprotein (a) ≥50 mg/dL or 125 nmol/L, especially at higher values of lipoprotein (a). Risk-enhancing factors may favor statin therapy in patients at 10-year risk of 5% to 7.5% (borderline risk).\n\nIn adults 40 to 75 years of age without diabetes mellitus and with LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL to 189 mg/dL (≥1.8–4.9 mmol/L), at a 10-year ASCVD risk of ≥7.5% to 19.9%, if a decision about statin therapy is uncertain, consider measuring CAC. If CAC is zero, treatment with statin therapy may be withheld or delayed, except in cigarette smokers, those with diabetes mellitus, and those with a strong family history of premature ASCVD. A CAC score of 1 to 99 favors statin therapy, especially in those =55 years of age. For any patient, if the CAC score is ≥100 Agatston units or ≥75th percentile, statin therapy is indicated unless otherwise deferred by the outcome of clinician–patient risk discussion.\n\nAssess adherence and percentage response to LDL-C–lowering medications and lifestyle changes with repeat lipid measurement 4 to 12 weeks after statin initiation or dose adjustment, repeated every 3 to 12 months as needed. Define responses to lifestyle and statin therapy by percentage reductions in LDL-C levels compared with baseline. In ASCVD patients at very high-risk, triggers for adding nonstatin drug therapy are defined by threshold LDL-C levels ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L) on maximal statin therapy (see No. 3).\n\n1. INTRODUCTION\n\n1.1. Methodology and Evidence Review\n\nThe recommendations listed in the present guideline are, whenever possible, evidence based. An initial extensive evidence review, which included literature derived from research involving human subjects, published in English, and indexed in MEDLINE (through PubMed), EMBASE, the Cochrane Library, the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, and other selected databases relevant to the present guideline, was conducted from May 1980 to July 2017. Key search words included but were not limited to the following: hyperlipidemia, cholesterol, LDL-C, HDL-C, ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, PCSK9 inhibitors, lifestyle, diet, exercise, medications, child, adolescent, screening, primary prevention, secondary prevention, cardiovascular disease, coronary artery calcium, familial hypercholesterolemia. ASCVD risk-enhancing factors, statin therapy, diabetes mellitus, women, adherence, Hispanic/Latino, South Asian, African American. Additional relevant studies published through August 2018 during the guideline writing process, were also considered by the writing committee and added to the evidence tables when appropriate. The final evidence tables are included in the Online Data Supplement and summarize the evidence used by the writing committee to formulate recommendations. References selected and published in the present document are representative and not all-inclusive.\n\nAs noted in the detailed version of the Preamble, an independent evidence review committee was commissioned to perform a formal systematic review of critical clinical questions related to cholesterol ( ), the results of which were considered by the writing committee for incorporation into the present guideline. Concurrent with this process, writing committee members evaluated study data relevant to the rest of the guideline. The findings of the evidence review committee and the writing committee members were formally presented and discussed, and then recommendations were developed. The systematic review for the 2018 Cholesterol Clinical Practice GuidelinesS1.1-1 is published in conjunction with the full-text guideline,S1.1-2 and includes its respective data supplements.\n\nTable 1.\n\nQuestionSection NumberIn adults ≥20 years of age with clinical atherosclerotic disease (eg, CHD, peripheral artery disease, or CVD) or at high-risk of ASCVD, what are the magnitude of benefit (absolute reduction; NNT) in individual endpoints and composite ischemic events (eg, fatal cardiovascular event, nonfatal MI, nonfatal stroke, unstable angina/revascularization) and magnitude of harm (absolute increase; NNH) in terms of adverse events (e.g, cancer, rhabdomyolysis, diabetes mellitus) derived from LDL-C lowering in large RCTs (>1 000 participants and originally designed to last >12 months) with statin therapy plus a second lipid-modifying agent compared with statin alone?4.1\n\nNumerical values for triglycerides, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein (HDL-C), and non–HDL-C are given in both mg/ dL and mmol/L. To convert to mmol/L, the values in mg/ dL for TC, LDL-C, HDL-C, and non–HDL-C were divided by 38.6 and for triglycerides, by 88.6. On May 10, 2018 a writing committee member discussed their participation in an industry-supported, multicenter study, which they had thought was not relevant to this prevention guideline. However, when this was reviewed using specific ACC/AHA criteria, it was considered to represent a relevant relationship with industry. Given the current policy that a prevention guideline writing committee member must be free of any relevant relationships with industry, this member was removed from the committee. The 2 sections authored by the writing committee member were removed and replaced by new material written by the guideline chairs, and the revised sections reviewed and approved by all remaining writing committee members. The writing committee member did not participate in any further guideline discussions or review of the manuscript or recommendations.\n\n1.2. Organization of the Writing Committee\n\nThe writing committee consisted of medical experts including cardiologists, internists, interventionalists, a nurse practitioner, pharmacists, a physician assistant, a pediatrician, a nephrologist, and a lay/patient representative. The writing committee included representatives from the American College of Cardiology (ACC), American Heart Association (AHA), American Association of Cardiovascular and Pulmonary Rehabilitation (AACVPR), American Association Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA), Association of Black Cardiologists (ABC), American College of Preventive Medicine (ACPM), American Diabetes Association (ADA), American Geriatrics Society (AGS), American Pharmacists Association (APhA), American Society for Preventive Cardiology (ASPC), National Lipid Association (NLA), and Preventive Cardiovascular Nurses Association (PCNA). of the present document lists writing committee members’ relevant RWI. For the purposes of full transparency, the writing committee members’ comprehensive disclosure information is available online.\n\n1.3. Document Review and Approval\n\nThis document was reviewed by 21 official reviewers each nominated by the ACC, AHA, AAPA, ABC, ACPM, ADA, AGS, APhA, ASPC, NLA, and PCNA, as well as 27 individual content reviewers. Reviewers’ RWI information was distributed to the writing committee and is published in this document ( ).\n\nThis document was approved for publication by the governing bodies of the ACC, the AHA, AAPA, ABC, ACPM, ADA, AGS, APhA, ASPC, NLA, and PCNA.\n\n1.4. Scope of the Guideline\n\nThe purpose of the present guideline is to address the practical management of patients with high blood cholesterol and related disorders. The writing committee reviewed previously published guidelines, evidence reviews, and related statements. Table S1 in the Web Supplement contains a list of publications and statements deemed pertinent. The primary sources of evidence are randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Most RCTs in this area have been performed with statins as the only cholesterol-lowering drug.S1.4-1–S1.4-3 Since the 2013 ACC/AHA cholesterol guideline,S1.4-4 newer cholesterol-lowering agents (nonstatin drugs) have been introduced and subjected to RCTs. They include ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors, and their use is limited mainly to secondary prevention in patients at very high-risk of new atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) events. Most other patients with ASCVD are treated with statins alone. In primary prevention, statins are recommended for patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and in adults 40 to 75 years of age either with diabetes mellitus or at higher ASCVD risk. Throughout these guidelines similar to the 2013 guidelines, consistent attention is given to a clinician–patient risk discussion for making shared decisions. Besides major risk factors of the pooled cohort equations (PCE), the clinician–patient risk discussion can include other risk-enhancing factors, and when risk status is uncertain, a coronary artery calcium (CAC) score is an option to facilitate decision-making in adults ≥40 years of age. In children, adolescents, and young adults, identifying those with familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a priority. However, most attention is given to reducing lifetime ASCVD risk through lifestyle therapies.\n\n1.5. Class of Recommendation and Level of Evidence\n\nRecommendations are designated with both a class of recommendation (COR) and a level of evidence (LOE). The class of recommendation indicates the strength of recommendation, encompassing the estimated magnitude and certainty of benefit in proportion to risk. The level of evidence rates the quality of scientific evidence supporting the intervention on the basis of the type, quantity, and consistency of data from clinical trials and other sources ( ).S1.5-1\n\n2. HIGH BLOOD CHOLESTEROL AND ASCVD\n\n2.1. Measurements of LDL-C and Non–HDL-C\n\n3. THERAPEUTIC MODALITIES\n\n3.1. Lipid-Lowering Drugs\n\nAmong lipid-lowering drugs, statins are the cornerstone of therapy, in addition to healthy lifestyle interventions. Other LDL-lowering drugs include ezetimibe, bile acid sequestrants, and PCSK9 inhibitors. Triglyceride-lowering drugs are fibrates and niacin; they have a mild LDL-lowering action, but RCTs do not support their use as add-on drugs to statin therapy.S3.1-1 Characteristics of LDL-lowering drugs are summarized in Table S3 in the Web Supplement.\n\n3.1.1. Statin Therapy\n\nThe intensity of statin therapy is divided into 3 categories: high-intensity, moderate-intensity, and low-intensity.S3.1.1-1 High-intensity statin therapy typically lowers LDL-C levels by ≥50%, moderate-intensity statin therapy by 30% to 49%, and low-intensity statin therapy by <30% ( ). Of course, the magnitude of LDL-C lowering will vary in clinical practice.S3.1.1-2 Certain Asian populations may have a greater response to certain statins.S3.1.1-3 Pharmacokinetic profiles among statins are heterogeneous (Table S4 in the Web Supplement). Statin safety has been extensively evaluated.S3.1.1-4 Statin-associated side effects are discussed in Section 5. Common medications that may potentially interact with statins are listed in Table S5 in the Web Supplement. More information on statin drug–drug interactions can be obtained from the ACC LDL-C Manager.S3.1.1-5\n\nTable 3.\n\nHigh IntensityModerate IntensityLow IntensityLDL-C lowering†≥50%30%–49%<30%StatinsAtorvastatin (40 mg‡) 80 mgAtorvastatin 10 mg (20 mg)Simvastatin 10 mgRosuvastatin 20 mg (40 mg)Rosuvastatin (5 mg) 10 mgSimvastatin 20–40 mg§...Pravastatin 40 mg (80 mg)Pravastatin 10–20 mgLovastatin 40 mg (80 mg)Lovastatin 20 mgFluvastatin XL 80 mgFluvastatin 20–40 mgFluvastatin 40 mg BIDPitavastatin 1–4 mg\n\n4.

Diabetes Mellitus in Adults\n\nSynopsis\n\nAdults 20 to 39 yearsofagearemostly atlow10-year risk, although moderate-intensity statin therapy in those with long-standing diabetes mellitus or a concomitant higher-risk condition may be reasonable ( ).S4.3-17,S4.3-20,S4.3-21 It may be reasonable to have a discussion about initiating moderate-intensity statin therapy with patients who have had type 2 diabetes mellitus for at least 10 years or type 1 diabetes mellitus for at least 20 years and with patients with ≥1 major CVD risk factors or complications, such as diabetic retinopathy,S4.3-19 neuropathy,S4.3-16 nephropathy (eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or albuminuria ≥30 mcg albumin/ mg creatinine),S4.3-25 or an ABI of <0.9S4.3-22,S4.3-24 ( ).\n\nTable 5.\n\nRisk Enhancers Long duration (≥ 10 years for type 2 diabetes mellituS4.3-20 or ≥20 years for type 1 diabetes mellitusS4.3-6 Albuminuria ≥30 meg of albumin/mg creatinineS4.3-25 eGFR <60 mL/min/1.73 m2S4.3-25 RetinopathyS4.3-9 NeuropathyS4.3-16 ABI <0.9S4.3-22,S4.3-24\n\n4.4. Primary Prevention\n\nPrimary prevention of ASCVD over the life span requires attention to prevention or management of ASCVD risk factors beginning early in life ( ). One major ASCVD risk factor is elevated serum cholesterol, usually identified clinically as measured LDL-C. Screening can be performed with fasting or nonfasting measurement of lipids. In children, adolescents (10 to 19 years of age), and young adults (20 to 39 years of age), priority should be given to estimation of lifetime risk and promotion of lifestyle risk reduction. Drug therapy is needed only in selected patients with moderately high LDL-C levels (≥160 mg/dL [≥4.1 mmol/L]) or patients with very high LDL-C levels (190 mg/dL [4.9 mmol/L]). Three major higher-risk categories are patients with severe hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C levels ≥190 mg/dL [≥4.9 mmol/L]), adults with diabetes, and adults 40 to 75 years of age. Patients with severe hypercholesterolemia and adults 40 to 75 years of age with diabetes mellitus are candidates for immediate statin therapy without further risk assessment. Adults with diabetes mellitus should start with a moderate-intensity statin, and as they accrue multiple risk factors, a high-intensity statin may be indicated. In other adults 40 to 75 years of age, 10-year ASCVD risk should guide therapeutic considerations. The higher the estimated ASCVD risk, the more likely the patient is to benefit from evidence-based statin treatment. The risk discussion should also consider several “risk enhancers” that can be used to favor initiation or intensification of statin therapy. When risk is uncertain or if statin therapy is problematic, it can be helpful to measure CAC to refine risk assessment. A CAC score predicts ASCVD events in a graded fashion and is independent of other risk factors, such as age, sex, and ethnicity.S4.4-1 A CAC score equal to zero is useful for reclassifying patients to a lower-risk group, often allowing statin therapy to be withheld or postponed unless higher risk conditions are present. For patients >75 years of age, RCT evidence for statin therapy is not strong, so clinical assessment of risk status in a clinician–patient risk discussion is needed for deciding whether to continue or initiate statin treatment.S4.4-2–S4.4-21\n\n4.4.1. . Evaluation and Risk Assessment\n\n4.4.1.1. Risk-Enhancing Factors\n\nModerate intensity generic statins allow for efficacious and cost-effective primary prevention in patients with a 10-year risk of ASCVD ≥7.5%.S4.4.1.1-1 Since 2013 ACC/ AHA guidelines,S4.4.1.1-2 the HOPE-3 RCTS4.4.1.1-3 provided additional support for this finding. The pooled cohort equation (PCE) is the single most robust tool for estimating 10-year risk in US adults 40 to 75 years of age. Its strength can be explained by inclusion of major, independent risk factors. One limitation on the PCE when applied to individuals is that age counts as a risk factor and dominates risk scoring with advancing age. Age is a powerful population risk factor but does not necessarily reflect individual risk. Another factor influencing risk are baseline characteristics of populations (baseline risk). These characteristics include both genetic and acquired risk factors other than established major risk factors. Variation in baseline risk accounts for difference in risk in different ethnic groups. Absolute risk predictions depend on the baseline risk of a population (eg, the US population). These considerations in patients at intermediate risk leave room in the clinician-patient risk discussion to withhold or delay initiation of statin therapy, depending on age, pattern of risk factors, and patient preferences and values.\n\nIn sum, the PCE is a powerful tool to predict population risk, but it has limitations when applied to individuals. One purpose of the clinician patient risk discussion is to individualize risk status based on PCE as well as other factors that may inform risk prediction. Among these other factors are the risk-enhancing factors discussed in this guideline. These risk-enhancing factors are listed in , and evidence base and strength of association with ASCVD are shown in Table S6 in the Web Supplement. In the general population, they may or may not predict risk independently of PCE. But in the clinician–patient risk discussion they can be useful for identifying specific factors that influence risk. Their presence helps to confirm a higher risk state and thereby supports a decision to initiate or intensify statin therapy. They are useful for clarifying which atherogenic factors are present in a particular patient. And in some patients, certain risk-enhancing factors carry greater lifetime risk than denoted by 10-year risk prediction in the PCE. Finally, several risk-enhancing factors may be specific targets therapy beyond those of the PCE.\n\nTable 6.\n\nRisk-Enhancing Factors Family history of premature ASCVD (males, age <55 y; females, age <65 y) Primary hypercholesterolemia (LDL-C, 160–189 mg/dL [4.1-4.8 mmol/L); non-HDL-C 190–219 mg/dL [4.9–5.6 mmol/L])* Metabolic syndrome (increased waist circumference, elevated triglycerides [>175 mg/dL], elevated blood pressure, elevated glucose, and low HDL-C [<40 mg/dL in men; <50 in women mg/dL] are factors; tally of 3 makes the diagnosis) Chronic kidney disease (eGFR 15–59 mL/min/1.73 m2 with or without albuminuria; not treated with dialysis or kidney transplantation) Chronic inflammatory conditions such as psoriasis, RA, or HIV/AIDS History of premature menopause (before age 40 y) and history of pregnancy-associated conditions that increase later ASCVD risk such as preeclampsia High-risk race/ethnicities (eg, South Asian ancestry) Lipid/biomarkers: Associated with increased ASCVD risk Persistently* elevated, primary hypertriglyceridemia (≥175 mg/dL); If measured: 1. Elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (≥2.0 mg/L) 2. Elevated Lp(a): A relative indication for its measurement is family history of premature ASCVD. An Lp(a) ≥50 mg/dL or ≥125 nmol/L constitutes a risk-enhancing factor especially at higher levels of Lp(a). 3. Elevated apoB ≥130 mg/dL: A relative indication for its measurement would be triglyceride ≥200 mg/dL. A level ≥130 mg/dL corresponds to an LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL and constitutes a risk¬ enhancing factor 4. ABI <0.9\n\nA few comments may illustrate the potential usefulness of risk-enhancing factors in the patient discussion. LDL-C ≥160 mg/dL (≥4.1 mmol/L), apoB ≥130 mg/dL (particularly when accompanied by persistently elevated triglycerides), and elevated Lp(a) denote high lifetime risk for ASCVD and favor initiation of statin therapy. The presence of family history of ASCVD, premature menopause, and patients of South Asian race appear to convey a higher baseline risk and are stronger candidates for statin therapy. See for a checklist of clinician-patient shared decision making for initiating therapy. Conditions associated with systemic inflammation (chronic inflammatory disorders, metabolic syndrome, chronic renal disease, and elevated hsCRP) appear to predispose to atherothrombotic events, which reasonably justifies statin therapy in intermediate-risk patients.\n\nTable 7.\n\nChecklist ItemRecommendationASCVD risk assessmentAssign to statin treatment group; use ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus.* In lower-risk primary-prevention adults 40–75 y of age with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L).

Other Populations at Risk\n\n4.5.1. Ethnicity\n\nSynopsis\n\nRace/ethnicity factors can influence estimations of ASCVD risk,S4.5.1-4 intensity of treatmentS4.5.1-1–S4.5.1-4 or even lipid drug use.S4.5.1-5,S4.5.1-6 Important examples include the heightened risk of ASCVD in those who identify as South Asians, the increased sensitivity to statins in those who identify as East Asians, and the increased prevalence of hypertension in blacks. An important issue in management of ASCVD risk in those who identify as Hispanics/Latinos in the United States is the lack of specificity of the term Hispanic/Latino. Race/ethnicity and country of origin, together with socioeconomic status and acculturation level, should be discussed and may explain ASCVD risk factor burden more precisely than the generic term Hispanic/Latino.S4.5.1-6–S4.5.1-11 In addition, those who identify as Native American/Alaskan natives have high rates of risk factors for ASCVD compared to non-Hispanic whites. In many ways, the increase in metabolic risk factors and propensity for diabetes mellitus resembles the risk profiles of those who identify as Mexican Americans.S4.5.1-12 reviews these and other racial/ethnic issues that may be useful in clinical management.\n\nTable 10.\n\nRacial/Ethnic GroupingsAsian AmericansS4.5.1-4,S4.5.1-13*Hispanic/Latino AmericansS4.5.1-7–S4.5.1-11†Blacks/African AmericansS4.5.1-14CommentsEvaluation ASCVD issues informed by race/ethnicityASCVD issues informed by race/ ethnicity ASCVD risk in people of South Asian and East Asian origin varies by country of origin; individuals from South Asia (see below) have increased ASCVD risk.Race/ethnicity and country of origin, together with socioeconomic status and acculturation level, may explain risk factor burden more precisely (eg, ASCVD risk is higher among individuals from Puerto Rico than those from Mexico).ASCVD risk assessment in black women shows increased ASCVD risk compared with their otherwise similar white counterpartsThere is heterogeneity in risk according to racial/ethnic group and within racial/ethnic groups. Native American/ Alaskan populations have high rates of risk factors for ASCVD compared with non-Hispanic whites.S4.5.1-12 Lipid issues informed by race//ethnicityS4.5.1-15,S4.5.1-16Asian Americans have lower levels of HDL-C than whites.Hispanic/Latino women have higher prevalence of low HDL-C compared to Hispanic/ Latino men.Blacks have higher levels of HDL-C and lower levels of triglycerides than non-Hispanic whites or Mexican Americans.All ethnic groups appear to be at greater risk for dyslipidemia, but important to identify those with more sedentary behavior and less favorable diet.There is higher prevalence of LDL-C among Asian Indians, Filipinos, Japanese, and Vietnamese than among whites. An increased prevalence of high TG was seen in all Asian American subgroups. Metabolic issues informed by race/ethnicity S4.5.1-3,S4.5.1-17, S4.5.1-1Increased MetS is seen with lower waist circumference than in whites.DM is disproportionately present compared with whites and blacks. There is increased prevalence of MetS and DM in Mexican Americans compared with whites and Puerto Ricans.There is increased DM and hypertension.There is increased prevalence of DM. Features of MetS vary by race/ethnicity. Waist circumference, not weight, should be used to determine abdominal adiposity when possible.DM develops at a lower lean body mass and at earlier ages.S4.5.1-19–S4.5.1-21 Majority of risk in South Asians is explained by known risk factors, especially those related to insulin resistance.S4.5.1-13Risk Decisions PCS4.5.1-22–S4.5.1-25No separate PCE is available; use PCE for whites. PCE may underestimate ASCVD risk in South Asians. PCE may overestimate risk in East Asians.S4.5.1-26No separate PCE is available; use PCE for non-Hispanic whites.

CAC scoreS4.5.1-27-S4.5.1-30In terms of CAC burden, South Asian men were similar to non- Hispanic white men, but higher CAC when than blacks, Latinos, and Chinese Americans. South Asian women had similar CAC scores to whites and other racial/ethnic women, although CAC burden higher in older age.S4.5.1-31CAC predicts similarly in whites and in those who identify as Hispanic/Latino.In MESA, CAC score was highest in white and Hispanic men, with blacks having significantly lower prevalence and severity of CAC.Risk factor differences in MESA between ethnicities did not fully explain variability in CAC. However, CAC predicted ASCVD events over and above traditional risk factors in all ethnicities.S4.5.1-32Treatment Lifestyle counseling (use principles of Mediterranean and DASH diets)Use lifestyle counseling to recommend a hearthealthy diet consistent with racial/ethnic preferences to avoid weight gain and address BP and lipids.Use lifestyle counseling to recommend a hearthealthy diet consistent with racial/ ethnic preferences to avoid weight gain and address BP and lipids.Use lifestyle counseling to recommend a hearthealthy diet consistent with racial/ ethnic preferences to avoid weight gain and address BP and lipids.Asian and Hispanic/ Latino groups need to be disaggregated because of regional differences in lifestyle preferences. Challenge is to avoid increased sodium, sugar, and calories as groups acculturate. Intensity of statin therapy and response to LDL-C loweringJapanese patients may be sensitive to statin dosing. In an open-label, randomized primaryprevention trial, Japanese participants had a reduction in CVD events with low- intensity doses of pravastatin as compared with placebo.S4.5.1-33 In a secondary-prevention trial, Japanese participants with CAD benefitted from a moderate-intensity dose of pitavastatin.S4.5.1-34No sensitivity to statin dosage is seen, as compared with non-Hispanic white or black individuals.No sensitivity to statin dosage is seen, as compared with non-Hispanic white individuals.Using a lower statin intensity in Japanese patients may give results similar to those seen with higher intensities in non-Japanese patients. SafetyHigher rosuvastatin plasma levels are seen in Japanese, Chinese, Malay, and Asian Indians as compared with whites.S4.5.1-35–S4.5.1-37 FDA recommends a lower starting dose (5 mg of rosuvastatin in Asians vs. 10 mg in whites). Caution is urged as dose is uptitratedThere are no specific safety issues with statins related to Hispanic/Latino ethnicity.S4.5.1-38Baseline serum CK values are higher in blacks than in whites.S4.5.1-39 The 95th percentile race/ethnicity-specific and sexspecific serum CK normal levels are available for assessing changes in serum CK.Clinicians should take Asian race into account when prescribing dose of rosuvastatin (See package insert).

STATIN SAFETY AND STATIN-ASSOCIATED SIDE EFFECTS\n\nSynopsis\n\nStatin therapy is usually well tolerated and safe.S5-1,S5-14,S5-22–S5-24 As with other classes of medications, associated side effects are seen. Instead of the label statin intolerance, the present guideline prefers statin-associated side effects because the large majority of patients are able to tolerate statin rechallenge with an alternative statin or alternative regimen, such as reduced dose or in combination with nonstatins. Although infrequent or rare in clinical trials, statin-associated side effects can be challenging to assess and manage.S5-25,S5-26 The most frequent are SAMS. SAMS usually are subjective myalgia, reported observationally in 5% to 20% of patients.S5-11–S5-14 SAMS often result in nonadherence and can adversely impact ASCVD outcomes.S5-27–S5-29 Statins modestly increase risk of incident diabetes mellitus in susceptible individuals,S5-8–S5-11 but this should not be cause for discontinuation ( ).\n\nTable 11.\n\nStatin-Associated Side EffectsFrequencyPredisposing FactorsQuality of EvidenceStatin-associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) Myalgias (CK normal)Infrequent (1 % to 5%) in RCTs; frequent (5% to 10%) in observational studies and clinical settingAge, female sex, low body mass index, high-risk medications (CYP3A4 inhibitors, OATP1B1 inhibitors), comorbidities (HIV, renal, liver, thyroid, preexisting myopathy), Asian ancestry, excess alcohol, high levels of physical activity, and traumaRCTs cohorts/ observational Myositis/myopathy (CK > ULN) with concerning symptoms or objective weaknessRareRCTs cohorts/ observational Rhabdomyolysis (CK >10× ULN + renal injury)RareRCTs cohorts/ observational Statin-associated autoimmune myopathy (HMGCR antibodies, incomplete resolution)RareCase reports New-onset diabetes mellitusDepends on population; more frequent if diabetes mellitus risk factors are present, such as body mass index ≥30, fasting blood glucose ≥100 mg/dL; metabolic syndrome, or A1c ≥6%.S5-8Diabetes mellitus risk factors/metabolic syndromeRCTs/meta-analysesHigh-intensity statin therapyLiver Transaminase elevation 3x ULNInfrequentRCTs/cohorts/observationalCase reports Hepatic failureRareCentral nervous system Memory/cognitionRareCase reports; no increase in memory/cognition problems in 3 large-scale RCTs CancerNo definite associationRCTs/meta-analysesOther Renal functionUnfounded CataractsUnfounded Tendon ruptureUnfounded Hemorrhagic strokeUnfounded Interstitial lung diseaseUnfounded Low testosteroneUnfounded\n\n7. COST AND VALUE CONSIDERATIONS\n\n7.1. Economic Value Considerations: PCSK9 Inhibitors\n\nACC/AHA clinical guidelines now recognize the importance of considering economic value in making recommendations, in accordance with the principles established by an expert group.S7.1-1 PCSK9 inhibitors further reduce LDL-C when combined with other LDL-lowering drugs, and they reduced composite cardiovascular events in 2 RCTs of high-risk, secondary-prevention patients with clinical ASCVD.S7.1-2 The cost-effectiveness and economic value of PCSK9 inhibitors have been assessed by using simulation models (Online Data Supplements 47 and 48); the published models are based on different sets of assumptions. Compared with statin therapy for secondary prevention, PCSK9 inhibitors have incremental cost-effectiveness ratiosS7.1-3 from $141700 to $450000 per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) added, at mid-2018 prices. None of the published models report “good value” (<$50000 per QALY added; ), and virtually all indicate “low value” (≥$150000 per QALY added). All models projected mortality benefit by assuming that mortality rate reductions either parallel LDL-C loweringS7.1-4 or parallel RRRs for nonfatal ASCVD events.\n\nTable 12.\n\nLevel of ValueHigh value: Better outcomes at lower cost or ICER <$50000 per QALY gainedIntermediate value: $50000 to <$150000 per QALY gainedLow value: ≥$150000 per QALY gainedUncertain value: Value examined, but data are insufficient to draw a conclusion because of absence of studies, low-quality studies, conflicting studies, or prior studies that are no longer relevantNot assessed: Value not assessed by the writing committeeProposed abbreviations for each value recommendation:Level of value:H to indicate high value; I, intermediate value; L, low value; U, uncertain value; and NA, value not assessed.\n\nAll models project higher lifetime cost from use of PCSK9 inhibitors because the cost will exceed any savings from prevention of cardiovascular events. To be cost-effective by conventional standards, the cost of PCSK9 inhibitors will have to be reduced on the order of 70% to 85% in the United States.S7.1-3 At any given price, the economic value of PCSK9 inhibitors will be improved by restricting their use to patients at very high-risk of ASCVD events, as recommended in the present guidelines. The inverse relationship between improved survival and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio ( ) indicates that the economic value of PCSK9 inhibitors will be improved by selecting higher-risk patients. One simulation model suggested that restricting the use of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy to patients with baseline LDL-C levels ≥119 mg/dL (≥3 mmol/L), instead of ≥70 mg/dL (≥1.8 mmol/L), would improve their cost-effectiveness to $150000 per QALY added, instead of $268000.S7.1-5 Another study projected a similar improvement in economic value.S7.1-6 Thus, raising the threshold for LDL-C on maximal statin therapy to initiate a PCSK9 inhibitor should improve its cost-effectiveness ( ).\n\nOnly 2 economic models have specifically examined the value provided by PCSK9 inhibitors for primary prevention in patients with heterozygous FH (Online Data Supplement 45). One modelS7.1-7 found low value when PCSK9 inhibitors were used for FH ($503000 per QALY added), whereas the second modelS7.1-8 reported intermediate value (incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $75900 per QALY added). Consequently, the value of PCSK9 inhibitor therapy in FH is uncertain.\n\n8. LIMITATIONS AND KNOWLEDGE GAPS\n\n8.1. Randomized Controlled Trials\n\nACC/AHA guidelines are based largely on the outcomes of RCTs. Cholesterol guidelines have fortunately benefited from a large number of RCTs of cholesterol-lowering therapies. They have established that greater reductions of LDL-C are accompanied by greater reductions in risk of ASCVD. Robust RCTs exist for both primary and secondary prevention. Most of the data from RCTs have been obtained with statin therapy. Important limited data have also been obtained with nonstatins as add-on drugs to statin therapy. Nevertheless, more data are needed to determine the full scope of the benefit of nonstatin drugs. Several important questions need to be addressed by additional RCTs.\n\nIn secondary prevention, does a lower limit for LDL-C attainment exist, beyond which the incremental benefit attained is worth neither the risks nor the cost of additional therapy?\n\nIn secondary prevention, what are the indications for adding PCSK9 inhibitors to maximal statin therapy?\n\nIn patients with ASCVD who have statin-associated side effects, are PCSK9 inhibitors an effective and safe substitute for high-intensity statins?\n\nIn primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C <90 mg/dL [<2.3 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by high-intensity statins as compared with moderate-intensity statins?\n\nIn primary prevention for adults 45 to 75 years of age (LDL-C <190 mg/dL [<4.9 mmol/L]) with or without diabetes mellitus, what is the incremental risk reduction imparted by moderate-intensity statins plus ezetimibe as compared with moderate-intensity statins alone?\n\nIs statin therapy efficacious and safe in older patients (>75 years of age)? If so, what is a net benefit of statin therapy in this age group?\n\nIn patients with severe hypercholesterolemia, what are the efficacy and net benefit of PCSK9 inhibitors as add-on treatment to maximal statin therapy?\n\nWhat is the efficacy of moderate-intensity and high-intensity statin therapy in patients with risk-enhancing factors (eg, chronic inflammatory disease, CKD, metabolic syndrome)?\n\n8.2. Risk Assessment\n\nIn primary prevention, the appropriate selection of patients for cholesterol-lowering drug therapy is highly dependent on risk assessment. Previous guidelines made use of risk-assessment algorithms (eg, Framingham risk scoring or PCE) to estimate risk. Although these equations are useful, they may overestimate or underestimate risk for individual patients. For this reason, the 2013 ACC/AHA guidelinesS8.2-1 introduced the clinician–patient risk discussion to facilitate clinical decisions about appropriate therapy. In the present guidelines, the clinician–patient risk discussion has been amplified and made an integral part of the clinical decision. In addition, in cases in which uncertainty exists, the measurement of CAC has been proposed as a third step in making a treatment decision. Each of these steps could be improved for future guidelines.\n\n8.2.1. . Continuing Refinement of PCE\n\nBecause the population baseline risk may be continually declining in the US population, ongoing epidemiological study is needed to assess and update population risk. An example is the development of QRISK in the U.K. population, which is continually expanding its scope.\n\n8.2.4. Monitoring and Adjustment of Treatment\n\nThe clinician–patient risk discussion will likely prove inadequate unless an ongoing interaction between the patient and clinician occurs. This involves monitoring the effectiveness of therapy and adherence to therapy. Thus, the clinician–patient risk discussion should include more than the initial treatment decision. Ongoing research on how to improve the entire process of initial decision-making and long-term follow-up is necessary.\n\n8.2.5. Prognostic Significance of CAC\n\nThe present guideline makes use of the available data to predict the risk associated with CAC. These data need to be amplified by new and ongoing studies to guide treatment decisions. Particular uncertainty exists about the predictive value of intermediate CAC scores. In addition, the predictive significance of a CAC score of zero must be further verified in follow-up studies. For patients with a CAC score of zero, it is currently uncertain when and if follow-up CAC measurements should be done to reassess risk status.\n\n​\n\nTable 4.\n\nMajor ASCVD Events Recent ACS (within the past 12 mo) History of MI (other than recent ACS event listed above) History of ischemic stroke Symptomatic peripheral arterial disease (history of claudication with ABI <0.85, or previous revascularization or amputationS4.1-39)High-Risk Conditions Age ≥65 y Heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia History of prior coronary artery bypass surgery or percutaneous coronary intervention outside of the major ASCVD event(s) Diabetes mellitus Flypertension CKD (eGFR 15–59 MI/min/1.73 m2)S4.1-15,S4.1-17 Current smoking Persistently elevated LDL-C (LDL-C ≥100 mg/dL [≥2.6 mmol/L]) despite maximally tolerated statin therapy and ezetimibe History of congestive HF\n\nTable 8.\n\nCAC Measurement Candidates Who Might Benefit From Knowing Their CAC Score Is Zero Patients reluctant to initiate statin therapy who wish to understand their risk and potential for benefit more precisely Patients concerned about need to reinstitute statin therapy after discontinuation for statin-associated symptoms Older patients (men, 55–80 y of age; women, 60–80 y of age) with low burden of risk factorsS4.4.2-25 who question whether they would benefit from statin therapy Middle-aged adults (40–55 y of age) with PCE-calculated 10-year risk of ASCVD 5% to <7.5% with factors that increase their ASCVD risk, although they are in a borderline risk group\n\nSupplementary Material\n\nauthor relationships\n\nClick here to view.(236K, pdf)\n\nweb supplement\n\nClick here to view.(448K, pdf)\n\ndata supplement\n\nClick here to view.(2.2M, pdf)\n\n1.6.
