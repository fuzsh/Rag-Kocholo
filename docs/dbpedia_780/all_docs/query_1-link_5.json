Lectotypes are designated for the following taxa: Orthalicus elegans Rolle, 1895; Bulimus maranhonensis Albers, 1854; Orthalicus nobilis Rolle, 1895; Orthalichus tricinctus Martens, 1893. Orthalicus sphinx tresmariae is introduced as new name for Zebra sphinx turrita Strebel, 1909, not Zebra quagga turrita Strebel, 1909. The following synonyms are established: Zebra crosseifischeri Strebel, 1909 = Orthalicus princeps fischeri Martens, 1893; Orthalicus isabellinus Martens, 1873 = Orthalicus bensoni (Reeve, 1849); Zebra zoniferus naesiotes Strebel, 1909 = Orthalicus undatus (Bruguière, 1789); Porphyrobaphe (Myiorthalicus) dennisoni pallida Strebel, 1909 = Hemibulimus dennisoni (Reeve, 1848); Zebra delphinus pumilio Strebel, 1909 = Orthalicus delphinus (Strebel, 1909); Orthalicus (Laeorthalicus) reginaeformis Strebel, 1909 = Corona perversa (Swainson, 1821); Bulimus (Eurytus) corticosus Sowerby III, 1895 = Plekocheilus (Eurytus) stuebeli Martens, 1885. The taxon Bulimus (Eudioptus) psidii Martens, 1877 is now placed within the family Sagdidae, tentatively in the genus Platysuccinea. Appendices are included with an index to all the types of Orthalicoidea extant (including those listed by Köhler 2007) and a partial list of letters present in the correspondence archives.\n\nKeywords: Bothriembryontidae, Bulimulidae, Megaspiridae, Odontostomidae, Orthalicidae, Simpulopsidae, type material, correspondence\n\nIntroduction\n\nA steady stream of papers on type material of the superfamily Orthalicoidea in major museums has been published during recent years (Neubert and Janssen 2004, Köhler 2007, Breure 2011, 2012, Breure and Ablett 2011, 2012, Breure and Whisson 2012). For the Berlin museum only part of the extant type material was treated by Köhler (2007) due to limitations at that time. A recent visit to the Berlin museum under the SYNTHESYS programme made it possible to compile a list of all type material in that collection related to the superfamily.\n\nThe Orthalicoidea is a large and diverse superfamily distributed mainly in the Neotropics, but with an important Gondwanan element (Herbert 2007, Neubert et al. 2009, Delsaerdt 2010, Breure and Whisson 2012). The classification of the group at the family level has recently been revised by Breure and Romero (2012), who recognized in total seven families based on phylogenetic results: the Neotropical families Amphibulimidae, Bulimulidae, Megaspiridae, Odontostomidae, Orthalicidae, and Simpulopsidae; the family Bothriembryontidae has a Gondwana distribution (southern South America, South Africa, Australia, Melanesia; see also Breure and Romero 2012).\n\nThe collection\n\nThe Berlin museum (ZMB) has a history of nearly 200 years, which has resulted in a malacological collection of ca. 118000 registered lots and many unregistered ones. Some of the malacological curators had an active role in describing new orthalicoid species, viz. E. von Martens, B. Rensch, and J. Thiele (see below). However, as may be seen from the catalogue herein, these curators have been able to acquire a substantial amount of type material described by other authors, sometimes through intermediates like the shell dealer Krantz, but more relevant through the acquisition of private collections (e.g. Dunker, Albers) and the exchange of material with other institutions.\n\nMaterial has been found which was collected or studied by the following persons: Johann C. Albers (1795–1857); Heinrich Dohrn (1838–1913), who exchanged material with Doering, Pfeiffer and Stelzner, cf. Dohrn (1875: 202–203); Adolfo Doering (1848–1926), who supplied type material to Dohrn and others with manuscript names before these were published, cf. Breure and Miquel 2012; Wilhelm Dunker (1809–1885); Ermst C.L. Gruner (1786–1857), cf. Tëmkin et al. (2009); Siegfried H.F. Jaeckel (1892–1970); Eduard von Martens (1831–1904), author of the Mollusca part in ‘Biologia Centrali-Americana’, including several brief biographies on collectors in the introduction of that work (Martens 1901 [1893–1901]: vi–xii); ? Moritz (no further data found); Friedrich Paetel (1812–1888), who donated his large shell collection to ZMB; Felipe Poey y Aloy (1799–1891); Bernhard Rensch (1900–1990) and his wife Ilse Rensch-Maier (1902–1992); G? Sievers; Hermann Strebel (1834–1915), see below; A. Stübel (no further data available); Johannes Thiele (1860–1935); and Franz H. Troschel (1816–1882). Brief information on the origin of the ZMB collection and the contributions of several persons mentioned above may also be found in Richling and Glaubrecht (2008), Tëmkin et al. (2009), Glaubrecht and Zorn (2012).\n\nThe material of H. Strebel is especially important in the context of this paper, since his own collection and the material in the Hamburg museum was destroyed during the 1940–45 war. Strebel made two major contributions to the orthalicoid literature. The first one was when he published, together with G. Pfeffer, his fifth and final volume on Mexican land shells (Strebel and Pfeffer 1882). Here he treated both (in our current understanding) Bulimulidae and Orthalicidae from that region and published ten new taxa. He also gave detailed anatomical data, something that only had started to be done recently at that time. His second contribution (Strebel 1909) was the revision of all the Orthalicidae known at that time. This work was following the treatment of this group by Pilsbry in the Manual of Conchology (Pilsbry 1899, 1900); only a decade later he described eight new (sub)genera and 19 new species-level taxa. His very detailed and precise studies led him to recognize both ‘Formen’ and ‘Heteromorphen’, of which he additionally recognized 37 taxa. According to the index of Strebel (1909), the names of ‘Hetromorphen’ were sometimes not indicated as new names, but the combination of main text and index always makes it clear when these names were newly introduced by Strebel. Under ICZN Art. 10.2 and 45.6.4 these taxa have to be treated as infrasubspecific names (ICZN 1999). On one hand, the ‘Formen’ and ‘Heteromorphen‘ point to Strebel as a ‘splitter’; on the other hand, his meticulous works made him stand out ahead of his time.\n\nHandwritings and labels\n\nThe importance of handwriting recognition for the deciphering and authorship of labels in collections has recently been illustrated by Breure and Ablett (2011: 5–12). In the Berlin collection I found that often information from the original label has (partly) been copied on a new label, but sometimes the first label has not been kept. E.g., shells originating from the Albers collection are labelled ‘Albers’ on the modern label; on Albers’ labels his source was always noted (e.g. Cuming), but in most cases he has not kept the original label ( ). Labels were found in the collection that can be atrtibuted to the following authors (with references to biographical data, see also above): J.C. Albers ( ), W.F. Clapp (Clench 1953; Fig. 1F), A. Doering ( ), W.B.R.H. Dunker (Tëmkin et al. 2009; Fig. 1C), H.C. Fulton ( ), H. von Heimburg ( ), S.H.F. Jaeckel ( ), E. von Martens (Glaubrecht and Zorn 2012; ), L. Pfeiffer ( ), B. Rensch ( ), S.A.A. Petit de la Saussaye (Crosse and Fischer 1871; Fig. 1B), H. Strebel ( ), J. Thiele ( ). Positive identification of authorship was facilitated by the large collection of correspondence in ZMB archives. However, some could only be solved with the help of other sources (e.g. Zilch 1967: 35–37). It may be noted that (slight) differences in handwriting may occur with age, e.g. letters of H. Strebel from the 1870s and his labels from the first decade of the 20th century ( ). See also the Appendix for a selection of persons, relevant to Neotropical malacology, for which handwritten correspondence is present in the archives. Examples are presented for K.Th. Menke ( ), R.A. Philippi ( ), and W. Dunker ( ).\n\nFinally, a special note may be made about the B. and I. Rensch material. They studied material obtained from E.M.M. Paravicini. He wrote to B. Rensch (letter d.d. 21.i.1931; Fig. 7) “Ich habe auf den südostlichen Salomonen (Malaita, San Christoval und Guadalcanar) eine grössere Sammlung von Land- und Süsswassermollusken angelegt. Ich hoffe in kommende Frühjahr mit der Bearbeitung derselben beginnen zu können. Ich werde mir dann erlauben, Sie anzufragen, ob Siue mir sicher bestimmter Vergleichsmaterial (Paratypen) leihweise überlassen könnten. Gerne sende ich Ihnen dann Doubletten. Auch habe ich etwas Alkoholmaterial für anatomische Untersuchung, falls Sie derselbe zubearbeiten wünschen, stelle ich es Ihnen gerne zur Verfügung”. Paravicini probably never worked on his material, but trusted this to B. and I. Rensch. It led to their publication (Rensch and Rensch 1934), in which they provided brief diagnoses of new species (two named after Paravicini); a more detailed account based on all material collected by Paravicini was published the next year (Rensch and Rensch 1935). In their first paper they indicated a locality and “Typus”, giving a range of dimensions, except when they had only one shell (“1 Schale = Typus”). In the latter case this is interpreted as a holotype designation, in all other cases their material is considered as syntypes or as paratypes. According to Delsaerdt (2010), who did not mention the ZMB material, the depository of the holotypes is the NMB collection.\n\nThe aim of this paper is to present a survey of the types of Orthalicoidea in the ZMB collection, supplementing the earlier paper of Köhler (2007). Therefore, the emphasis lies on the Bothriembryontidae (especially the Placostylinae), Odontostomidae and Orthalicidae, with additional notes on the type material of other families within the superfamily (sensu Breure and Romero 2012). It must be emphasized that the current systematic position under each taxon does not imply a revision, but generally follows the current understanding of recent authors (e.g. Miquel 1993, 1995; Richardson 1993, 1995; Simone 2006; Neubert et al. 2009; Delsaerdt 2010, Thompson 2011).\n\nMethods\n\nFor each taxon, the original publication—in which the taxon was proposed—is mentioned, as well as papers in which reference is made to the type material. The type locality is quoted from the original publication in the original wording and language, with clarifying notes between square brackets. As far as possible, localities have been traced with the NGA gazetteer (http://earth-info.nga.mil/gns/html/ ) or the Fuzzy gazetteer (http://isodp.hof-university.de/fuzzyg/query/ ). The name of the collector, if given in the original paper, is only mentioned (in italics) if it might give a clue about the type status of material present in the collection. The text of the original, or oldest, label is quoted, together with information from subsequent labels if containing information necessary for a correct interpretation. All labels have been photographed and are figured for future historic reference. The dimensions of the type are quoted, as given in the original paper. Dimensions of the type specimens have been taken with a digital caliper; measurements up to 10 mm have an accuracy of 0.1 mm, those above 10 mm are accurate to 0.5 mm. Due to improvements in accuracy of Vernier calipers, the measurements given herein are in several cases slightly different from those originally reported. In the case of syntypes, only the largest specimen has been measured. Under type material the ZMB-registration numbers are given; if specimens from different localities are present, the order of the lots corresponds with the information of the different labels. The number of specimens originally available, if quoted by the original author, is mentioned under remarks. Further remarks are given to describe any individual characteristics of the type specimens or any other details of the type lot. The current systematic position is given, following the generic scheme of Breure (1979) and the familial arrangement of Breure and Romero (2012).\n\nPublication dates of works which have been disputed in literature generally follow the collations of Coan et al. (2012a, 2012b). A special note may be made about the papers of Doering, who in the 1870s published a series on the land and freshwater shells of Argentina. The years in which his papers have been published are variously cited in literature (e.g., Zilch 1971, Neubert and Janssen 2004, Miquel and Aguirre 2011). Since a large number of taxa have been described in these papers, a separate paper has been prepared on the dates of publication of Doering’s work; see Breure and Miquel (2012).\n\nAbbreviations used for depositories of material are: FML, Fundación Miguel Lillo, Tucumán, Argentina; MCZ, Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, Mass., U.S.A.; MHNG, Musée d’Histoire Naturelle, Genève, Switzerland; MNHN, Muséum nationale d’Histoire naturelle, Paris, France; NMB, Naturhistorisches Museum, Basel, Switzerland; NHMUK, Natural History Museum, London, U.K.; RBINS, Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences, Brussels, Belgium; SMF, Senckenberg Natur-Museum, Frankfurt am Main, Germany; UF, Florida Museum of Natural History, Gainesville, U.S.A.; ZMB, Museum für Naturkunde der Humboldt-Universität, Berlin, Germany; ZMZ, Zoologisches Museum, Universität Zürich, Switzerland.

Moreover, the specimens were collected by Gundlach, who is known to have collected many shells for Poey; see also Richling and Glaubrecht (2008: 271). Analogous to their reasoning on the type status of taxa described by Pfeiffer (Richling and Glaubrecht 2008: 268, sub (i)), we here consider it plausible that ZMB 117781 is to be considered as probable syntypes since these are labelled as received from Poey. For details on the connection between Gundlach and Dunker (and Pfeiffer) see Glaubrecht in Tëmkin et al. (2009).\n\nTwo other lots are present: ZMB 9044, three specimens; labelled “Rangel, Cuba”, J.

Subsequently, this and other varieties were synonymized with Spixia striata (Spix, 1827) by Richardson (1993). The fact that Martens (1894) recognized four varieties—ranging from 26–50 mm shell height and 10 1/2–14 whorls—from the same locality, calls for an in-depth study of the variability of Spixia striata.

It was identified as Bulimulus gorrietiensis Pilsbry, 1896 by the collector, H. [de] S[ouza]. Lopes. The specimens were collected in March 1951. Weyrauch (1958) based himself on material from the same collector and the same locality to describe his Lopesianus crenulatus, but did not include the ZMB specimens in his type series; they are considered as topotypes (see also page 6).\n\nZebra crosseifischeri\n\nStrebel, 1909\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Zebra_crosseifischeri\n\nZebra crosseifischeri Strebel 1909: 27, pl. 1 fig. 4, pl. 2 fig. 17.\n\nType locality.\n\n“San Isidro, Guatemala”.\n\nLabel.\n\n“S[an] Isidro Guatemala”, with a second, taxon label in Strebel’s handwriting.\n\nDimensions.\n\n“51,5 × (25,9)31,3 [H × (Dmin)Dmax in mm]”; figured specimen herein H 50.2, D 29.3, W 6.0.\n\nType material.\n\nZMB 109951, holotype; Champion leg.\n\nRemarks.\n\nStrebel based himself on “Ein Stück des Berliner Museums”.

The top of the specimen is damaged. There is no original label in Rolle’s handwriting, but the measurements agree and Martens has marked the specimen as ‘type’ on the label. Neubert and Janssen (2004) correctly indicated that Rolle distributed more specimens under the same name, without it being clear if they were part of the original series. This being the case, I now designate the ZMB specimen as lectotype (design. n.) to define the taxon.

The latter taxon was introduced by Strebel (1909: 27) as a new species, but from his text it is clear that he based himself on the same specimen which Martens (1893 [1890–1901]) regarded as his Orthalichus fischeri. The name Zebra crosseifischeri Strebel, 1909 is thus an objective synonym of Orthalicus fischeri Martens, 1893 (syn. n.). See also under Zebra crosseifischeri Strebel, 1909, page 17.

The label gives three names, viz. “Bulimus liliaceus Fér.”, “Bul. flavidus Mke”, and “Bulimus roseoflavus m”; the latter name is an unpublished name, in different ink and probably later added. The “m” may possibly refer to “mihi” and would indicate that Martens added this name.

The specimen found corresponds to the figures given by Strebel, and is regarded the holotype.

No. 10, ex Cuming coll.\n\nRemarks.\n\nThe specimen has been received through Albers from the Cuming collection, and there is little doubt about its type status. For a clarification why type material described by G.B. Sowerby I found its way to the Cuming collection, see Breure and Ablett (2011: 3, 10, and 12). The type locality was restricted by Ramírez (2004: 41) to “Depto Lima, Las Salinas de Huacho, perto [sic, puerto] de Huacho”, which seems contradicting to the locality on the label found. The current systematic position has been taken from the same author.\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nBulimulidae, Bostryx modestus (Broderip in Broderip and Sowerby I, 1832).\n\nBulimus (Odontostomus) leptodon\n\nMartens, 1875\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Bulimus_leptodon\n\nBulimus (Odontostomus) leptodon Martens 1875: 276.\n\nType locality.\n\n“Cordova im Binnenland des argentinischen Staates”.\n\nLabel.\n\n“Cordova”, with a second, taxon label also in Martens’ handwriting.\n\nDimensions.\n\n“Long. 21 1/2, diam. 7 (...)

No. 528, Hegewisch leg.\n\nRemarks.\n\nPfeiffer (1842) mentioned “Hegewisch in litt.”, which points to Hegewisch as the collector of the material described by Pfeiffer. As Albers had the same source, and the dimensions closely match those given by Pfeiffer (given as “Long. 23, diam. 9 mill.” in Pfeiffer 1848), there is little doubt about the type status. The shell is not fully grown. The current systematic position is after Thompson (2011).\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nBulimulidae, Drymaeus (Mesembrinus) livescens (Pfeiffer, 1842).\n\nOrthalicus lividus\n\nMartens, 1864\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Orthalicus_lividus\n\nOrthalicus lividus Martens 1864: 542; Strebel and Pfeffer 1882: 30, pl. 11 fig. 18; Pilsbry 1899: 124, pl. 19 figs 18–19.\n\nOrthalichus [sic] lividus; Martens 1893 [1890–1901]: 186, pl. 11 figs 11–11a.\n\nType locality.\n\n“Am Vulkan Jorullo und in der Provinz Mechoacan [sic], Uhde”.\n\nLabel.\n\n“Jorullo Vulkan / Prov.

The specimen ZMB 4458 is broken in the last whorl due to the thiness of the shell; it corresponds to the figures of Strebel and Pfeffer (1882) and Martens 1893 [1890–1901]. The specimens ZMB 4461 are accompanied by labels referring to Strebel and Pfeffer’s (1882) “Form A” and “Form B”.

The top of the shell is slightly damaged, but it agrees otherwise well with Dunker’s figures. His figures shows the vertical sculpture too pronounced and may thus be misleading. The shell identified as Plekocheilus (Eurytus) lugubris by Borrero and Breure (2011: 49, figs 15K–M) does not correspond to this species, but is a hitherto unknown species. However, their reclassification of Dunker’s taxon with Plekocheilus (Eurytus)is supported.\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nAmphibulimidae, Plekocheilus (Eurytus) lugubris (Dunker, 1882).\n\nBulimus macgillivrayi\n\nPfeiffer, 1855\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Bulimus_macgillivrayi\\according_to_Breure_2013\n\nBulimus macgillivrayi Pfeiffer 1855b: 108, pl. 32 fig. 2.\n\nPlacostylus (Placocharis) macgillivrayi ; Breure and Schouten 1985: 63 (lectotype designation).\n\nPlacocharis macgillivrayi ; Delsaerdt 2010: 61, pl. 10 figs 9–11; Breure and Ablett 2012: 25, figs 14B, 14v.\n\nType locality.\n\n“Wanderer Bay, Guadalcanar, Salomon’s Islands (Macgillivray)”.\n\nLabel.\n\n“Solomons Inseln”, in Albers’ handwriting.\n\nDimensions.\n\n“Long. 59, diam. 22 mill.”; specimen figured herein H 51.3, D 21.3, W 6.2.\n\nType material.\n\nZMB 117763, one paralectotype; ex Albers coll.

Weyrauch leg.\n\nRemarks.\n\nAccording to the typewritten label this specimen was identified by Weyrauch as Scutalus latecolumellaris ortizpuentei and distributed as “Paratypoide”. The locality does not match the type locality and—since the taxon was based on a single specimen—no other localities were mentioned in the text. Moreover, the text stated that the holotype was collected by J. Ortiz de la Puente. Therefore, we must conclude that this specimen is not a paratype of this taxon. Presumably, Weyrauch collected this material during his Peruvian time in the 1940s or 1950s (Barbosa et al. 2008), identified it and distributed it as paratype well before he described the taxon in 1967 (see also Breure and Neubert 2008).

The material is accompanied by a label “Bulimus / moussoni / Gräffe”. The latter refers to a manuscript name in Museum Godeffroy (not Bulimus moussoni Pfeiffer, 1853); Crosse (1875: 13) has noted this homonymy and proposed the name Bulimus (Placostylus) graeffei. Kobelt, however, stated that his taxon was different.\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nBothriembryontidae, Callistocharis paeteli (Kobelt, 1890).\n\nPorphyrobaphe (Myiorthalicus) dennisoni pallida\n\nStrebel, 1909\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Porphyrobaphe_dennisoni_pallida\n\nPorphyrobaphe (Myiorthalicus) dennisoni pallida Strebel 1909: 115, pl. 21 fig. 328, pl. 24 figs 376–379.\n\nType locality.\n\n[Colombia] “Cauca-Tal, Columbien (...)

This sentence makes clear that lot 2 and 3 (seven specimens in total) in Strebel’s list refers to this material, of which he figured two and gave measurements of four specimens respectively. The shell height in his material (totally more than 15 specimens mentioned) varies between 34.5–83.3 mm. The taxon label in Strebel’s hand makes it very probable that this specimen belonged to the original series.

His classification of Laeorthalicus as a separate genus is herein considered as erroneous; left- and right handed specimens may occur in the same population of Orthalicid species (Breure, unpublished data; Simone 2006: fig. 543), and the description of a separate subgenus for the single, somewhat subadult, sinistral shell by Strebel may be interpreted as premature.\n\nThis taxon is now placed within the genus Corona, which species list badly needs a revision; the current systematic position is therefore a provisional one.\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nOrthalicidae, Corona perversa (Swainson, 1821) (comb. n., syn. n.).\n\nBulimus (Odontostomus) reticulatus\n\nDoering, 1877\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Bulimus_reticulatus\n\nBulimus (Odontostomus) reticulatus Doering 1877: 331; Doering 1878: 250; Neubert and Janssen 2004: 227, pl. 18 fig. 229.\n\nScalarinella (Spixia) aconjigastana ; Zilch 1971: 202, pl. 12 fig. 29 (lectotype designation).\n\nType locality.\n\n[Argentina, Prov.

Thompson (2011) expressed his doubts if this taxon may be included in the Central American malacofauna.\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nOrthalicidae, Orthalicus undatus (Bruguière, 1789).\n\nBulimus shuttleworthi\n\nAlbers, 1854\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Bulimus_shuttleworthi\n\nBulimus shuttleworthi Albers 1854: 216; Pfeiffer 1855 in Küster and Pfeiffer 1854–1860: 31, pl. 8 figs 14–15.\n\nOrthalicus shuttleworthi ; Pilsbry 1899: 201, pl. 41 figs 1–2.\n\nOrthalicus (Metorthalicus) shuttleworthi ; Strebel 1909: 157, pl. 30 fig. 437.\n\nType locality.\n\n“in Columbia ad fluvium Maranhon”.\n\nLabel.\n\n“Columbia ad fluvium Maranhon”, in Albers’ handwriting.\n\nDimensions.\n\n“Long. 71, diam. 29 mill.”; figured specimen herein H 70.5, D 34.4, W 5.5+.\n\nType material.\n\nZMB 101827, two syntypes; ex Albers coll. No. 544, Warzewicz leg.\n\nRemarks.\n\nAlbers did not state on how many specimens his description was based. The largest specimen found has the top damaged and a label ‘544’ glued on the last whorl behind the lip; moreover, the specimen has damage on the dorsal side of both (pen)ultimate whorls. The shells corresponds well to Pfeiffer’s figure, who stated “Aus der Albers’schen und meiner Sammlung”. One other lot (ZMB 210505, two specimens) is labelled “Oberes Maranhon”, from the same collector, but not originating from the Albers collection. Since there is no evidence that these specimens have been part of the original series and the locality does not match the published one, they are not considered as type material. This taxon is tentatively retained as a valid species.\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nOrthalicidae, Sultana (Metorthalicus) shuttleworthi (Albers, 1854).\n\nMacrodontes simplex\n\nThiele, 1906\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Macrodontes_simplex\n\nMacrodontes simplex Thiele 1906: 70, fig. 1–1a; Zilch 1960: 508, fig. 1781; Schileyko 1999: 334, fig. 412.\n\nType locality.\n\n[Brazil] “Serra dos Tapes (Rio grande do Sul)”.\n\nLabel.\n\n“Serra dos Tapes / Rio gr. do Sul”, in Thiele’s handwriting.\n\nDimensions.\n\n“Höhe 36 mm.

ZMB 55782, paratype; Schlüter leg.\n\nRemarks.\n\nThiele described this taxon from two specimens in the ZMB collection. The paratype specimen (ZMB 55782) bears the label “Rio Grande do Sul”. The current systematic position is modified after Simone (2006).\n\nCurrent systematic position.\n\nOdontostomidae, Odontostomus simplex (Thiele, 1906).\n\nZebra sphinx\n\nStrebel, 1909\n\nhttp://species-id.net/wiki/Zebra_sphinx\n\nZebra sphinx Strebel 1909: 66, pl. 12 figs 181, 185.\n\nType locality.\n\n“Tepic (...)
