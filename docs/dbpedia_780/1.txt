There is a bit about the company mentioned on this page of an old thread..

They Were Caught In Our Old Street Pics...

Re: #798 No Health & Safety then! I think he had picked a quiet morning to go up on the roof to find some lead. He didn't realise he was getting caught in one of the old street pics !

A Sparks, thanks for your information I had already found it here. I hope there is more to tell / find about this company, because there is little that can be found on the internet

It's strange isn't it - very little at all!

Another member may be able to find some more info for you - I think members have access to our old Kelly's Directories to check dates they were at that address.

The company did not start in Great charles St, and , because the year in Kellys is the publication date, not the survey date, I believe the company may have started at least a year before 1878.

1876 No mention

1878-1882 Hills Menke & Co, iron, metal, tinplate , iron wire & and hardware merchants, 5 Carrs Lane

1883-1892 Hills Menke & Co, iron, metal, tinplate , & and hardware merchants, 8 Great Charles St

1895 Hills Menke & Co, iron, metal, tinplate ,hardware & and general merchants, 154 Great Charles St

1897-1915 Hills Menke & Co, merchants, 154 Great Charles St

1921 J Browne Wilson & sons,. export merchants, 154 Great Charles St

The change in address from 8 to 154 was real, and not due to renumbering.

Menke was listed as German Consul in Kellys from 1908-1912, but not in 1904 edition
