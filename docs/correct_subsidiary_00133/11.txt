Oracle Corp. has agreed to acquire Netsure Telecom Ltd., a provider of network intelligence and network data integrity software.

The deal is expected to boost Oracle’s ability to help networking and telecommunications customers improve their network utilization, optimize capacity, financial modeling and streamline network life cycle management, the Redwood Shores, California company said in a statement dated Sunday.

Oracle plans to add Netsure’s products to its communications applications suite, it said.

Netsure, a private company based in Dublin, Ireland, makes software that helps ensure the smooth operation of existing and next-generation networks and services, Oracle said. The company counts Vodafone Group Plc and Cable & Wireless Plc as users of its software. Its main software is the Active Network Optimisation product suite.

Financial details of the transaction were not disclosed.

Oracle expects the deal to be finalized later this month.
