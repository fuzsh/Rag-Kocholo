Oracle Corporation is one of the largest software companies in the world (behind Microsoft).

The company, which is based in California, develops and markets computer hardware systems, software products, and database development tools.

Larry Ellison, Bob Miner, and Ed Oates founded the company in 1977 under the name Software Development Laboratories (SDL).

Two years later the three changed the name of the company to Relational Software, Inc and the first version of the Oracle database software ran on PDP-11 hardware.

With the success of its Oracle database software, RSI decided to change its name to something more closely related to its primary products. In 1982 it changed its name to Oracle Systems Corporation.

In 1986 Oracle went public and made an initial public stock offering of 2.1 million shares on the NASDAQ exchange – and reported annual revenue of $55 million USD.

In 1989 the company made a move to prepare for the internet boom, developing database support of online transaction processing. The same year Oracle moved its headquarters to its campus at Redwood Shores, California.

In 1995, the company changed its name to Oracle Corporation.

Larry Ellison, Founder and CEO of Oracle, said the following in 1998: “If the internet turns out not to be the future of computing, we’re toast. But if it is, we’re golden.”
