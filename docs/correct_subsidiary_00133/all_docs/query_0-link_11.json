        "text": "Oracle Corp. (ORCL) said Thursday after the closed that first quarter earnings rose from last year, boosted by demand for its core database software and acquisitions of former rivals like Siebel Systems and PeopleSoft as well as other small software firms over the last few years. The company's quarterly earnings per share, excluding items, beat analysts' estimate by a penny.\n\nThe world's largest enterprise software company reported GAAP net income for the first quarter of $840 million or $0.16 per share, compared to $670 million or $0.13 per share for the year-ago quarter and $1.6 billion or $0.31 per share for the previous sequential quarter.\n\nExcluding acquisition costs, employee stock options expense, amortization of intangible assets and other items, non-GAAP net income for the first quarter was $1.2 billion or $0.22 per share, compared to $931 million or $0.18 per share in the prior year quarter and $1.9 billion or $0.37 per share in the prior quarter.\n\nOn average, 26 analysts polled by First Call / Thomson Financial expected the company to earn $0.21 per share for the first quarter.\n\nThis marked the seventh consecutive quarter in which Oracle's earnings has surged by at least 20%, which is part of the company's strategy to deliver growth through acquisitions.\n\nGAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 27%, compared to 26% in the first quarter of last year and 39% in the fourth quarter.\n\nNon-GAAP operating margin for the first quarter was 37%, compared to 36% in the first quarter of last year and 46% in the fourth quarter.\n\nRedwood Shores, California-based Oracle said total GAAP revenues for the first quarter increased 26% to $4.53 billion from $3.59 billion a year ago, while non-GAAP revenue rose 25% to $4.59 billion from $3.66 billion last year. Sequentially, first quarter GAAP revenue declined 22.3%, while non-GAAP revenue fell 21.9%. Twenty-seven analysts had consensus revenue estimate of $4.34 billion for the company's first quarter.\n\n\"We reported new software license revenues up 35%, the strongest growth of any quarter in ten years,\" said Oracle President and CFO, Safra Catz.\n\nTotal GAAP software revenues for the first quarter surged 26% year over year to $3.5 billion. GAAP new software licenses revenue jumped 35% year over year to $1.1 billion, with GAAP database and middleware new license revenues up 23% and GAAP applications new license revenues up 65%. GAAP services revenue for the quarter rose 25% from last year to $1.1 billion.\n\nGAAP revenues from the Americas grew to $2.4 billion in the first quarter from $2.0 billion a year ago, while Europe, Middle East & Africa revenue increased to $1.5 billion from $1.1 billion last year and Asia Pacific revenue rose to $624 million from $495 million a year ago.\n\n\"We continue to take applications market share from SAP,\" said Oracle President, Charles Phillips. \"In Q1 Oracle's applications new license sales grew 65% compared to SAP's new license sales growth rate of 18% in their most recently completed quarter.\n\nOracle CEO Larry Ellison noted that the company has already taken the number one position in database software from IBM and that if it continues to grow its middleware software at the same rate as in this quarter, it will challenge IBM for the number one position in middleware by the end of this year.\n\nDuring a conference call with analysts, Oracle CFO Safra Catz said the company expects GAAP earnings of $0.20 to $0.21 per share and non-GAAP earnings of $0.26 to $0.27 per share for the second quarter. The company forecast second quarter revenue to grow 19% to 21% from a year ago, with new software license revenue increasing 15% to 25%. Analysts currently expect the company to earn $0.26 per share on revenue of $4.88 billion for the second quarter.\n\nOracle continues to be successful in its strategy of acquisition-led growth. Since the end of 2004, Oracle has spent more than $25 billion on more than 30 acquisitions. In January 2005, the company completed its $11.1 billion purchase of PeopleSoft after a prolonged takeover battle. Besides PeopleSoft, Oracle has also swallowed up Siebel Systems Inc. for $6.1 billion. Some other deals included MetaSolv Software Inc., Stellent Inc.\n\nIn April, the company completed its acquisition of business-intelligence software maker Hyperion Solutions Corp. for $3.3 billion.\n\nIn May, Oracle agreed to buy product lifecycle management software maker Agile Software Corp. for about $495 million. In July, Agile's shareholders approved the deal. Approval of the merger agreement by Agile's stockholders satisfies one of the conditions to the completion of the merger. All government regulatory approvals, both U.S. and foreign, required to consummate the merger have been obtained.\n\nIn July, Oracle agreed to buy identity theft and fraud prevention software maker Bharosa Inc. for an undisclosed sum.\n\nEarlier this month, Oracle signed a deal to buy Netsure Telecom Ltd., a provider of network intelligence, analytics and network data integrity software. The deal is expected to close in late September.\n\nAmong the company's rivals, SAP AG (SAP) in July reported an 8% growth in second quarter earnings, driven by a 16% upside in revenues from software and software related services division, together with a positive impact from effective tax rate.\n\nIn terms of stock performance, Oracle shares have gained 16.23% in the last one year, compared to a 15.38% gain by the S&P 500 index. Oracle shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 15.7 times 2009 estimates, compared to Microsoft's 14.57 times and IBM's 14.77 times.\n\nOracle shares, which are trading in the range of $15.97 to $21.13 over the last year, closed Thursday's regular trading session at $21.04, up 20 cents but lost 26 cents or 1.24% in after hours trading.\n\nFor comments and feedback contact: editorial@rttnews.com"
