        "text": "COLE HAAN, the footwear and accessory company, has always produced the kind of well-made leather shoe that Mother wore to the club: appropriate, but not exactly hip.\n\nThat classic approach began to change in 1999, when Cole Haan's owner, Nike, brought in new management, and the shoemaker began to update its product line for its traditional 35- to 50-year-old customer. But the company now covets younger, trendier consumers, and is incorporating Nike technology in a new shoe line called the G-series Cole Haan.\n\nThe line is as different from a traditional Cole Haan loafer as a Mustang is from a Volvo. One model even has a four-inch platform that uses Nike Air technology for better comfort. The footwear is also being sold at retailers that have previously shown little interest in carrying Cole Haan shoes, like Barney's Co-Op in New York and Fred Segal in Los Angeles.\n\nThe advertising, from Lloyd & Company in New York, is distinctive, too. There is no copy besides ''Introducing G-Series Cole Haan.'' And the media plan calls for plastering construction sites with posters and buying ads in magazines geared to a downtown crowd, like Flaunt and Paper. Advertisements for Cole Haan's classic line can be seen in magazines like The New Yorker.\n\n''We believe the G-series will transform the company and provide entirely new access to a new consumer base who is not just younger, but younger in spirit,'' said Matthew E. Rubel, Cole Haan's chairman and chief executive. ''People today are living in a more mobile way -- they are not as office bound, they are on the go. This represents the world of sport and fashion coming together, which is a trend that is here to stay.''\n\nBut Candace Corlett, a partner with WSL Strategic Retail, a New York consulting firm, said the G-series is directed at the wrong audience. She praised Cole Haan for updating its classic line, but said the company could have counted on its traditional audience to respond to the idea of cool styling and Nike technology.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
