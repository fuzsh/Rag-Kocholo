        "text": "My mom has dementia, and one of the things I did not anticipate was most of my ways of communicating with her have slowly disappeared. I've been working professionally in communication since 1984. It will be 40 years this summer that I got my first full time job in comms, serving a small graduate school in Toronto as their newsletter editor, writer of fundraising appeals and much more. In the four decades since, I have written more words than I could have ever imagined via home game sports programs, news releases, feature stories, video scripts, op-ed pieces and the list goes on. Along the way, I learned and adapted to numerous new technologies: email in the 1990s, the first website for which I provided content in 1995, my first cell phone and first texts in the early 2000s and then social media of various stripes in the 2010s and continuing to this day. And, along the way, my mom also adapted, in ways that sometimes surprised me. It started with me getting used computers for her from a local college during its annual sale. She took to the internet like a fish to water. She became a regular on email, then got on Facebook and participated there in a consistent fashion, soon had a smartphone and figured out its many messaging capacities, including texts and photos, and before I knew it, I had probably half a dozen ways to stay in touch with her (and through her also with my dad). But, as her dementia was first diagnosed and then progressed, those tools began to fall by the wayside. First, her laptop became too much for her, and she could no longer find her way through the cognitive challenges of email or Facebook. That was a big milestone, and when a quick email or a short Facebook message to her were no longer options, her world got a bit smaller, and mine did too. Next came the cell phone. It would get misplaced and then it wouldn't be charged. Text messages would stay unread for days. Calling her on it just led to ringing and eventually a message that her voicemail box was full. So, we reluctantly cancelled her cell phone provider. Which left just her landline. But when she moved into a memory care unit in London, we discovered she didn't really spend much time in her room (which overall is a good thing). So reaching her on the landline was well nigh impossible. And we let that connection go too. Now, my points of contact with her are in-person visits (which I try to do several times a year), Facetime calls via my sister, who lives just a few minutes away from her, and cards and letters. For my mom, it's probably fine. If we visit on a Saturday, she will be surprised to see us when we show up for coffee on Sunday. But for me, the slow but sure reduction in communication has been a revelation. We have so many ways to stay in touch in 2024, and perhaps we take many of them for granted. I'd like to encourage you not to take them for granted. There are no guarantees, and sometimes you don't realize what you had until it is gone."
