        "text": "So I just read I‚Äôm a Big Meat Eater by Adrian CDTPPW. While I appreciate Adrian‚Äôs tone towards vegans, I have some strong disagreements with the content.\n\nSince the post is getting quite some attention, I decided to write a reaction.\n\nObviously, it‚Äôs easier to follow this reaction if you read the original post first.\n\nI respect commitment and self-control, but there‚Äôs a cruel world out there. For every animal a vegan thinks they save by abstaining from eating meat and animal products, people like me devour at least three or five. Sorry! üò≥\n\nThings are so industrial nowadays that meat and produce will hit the shelves no matter what we do. Overproducing and wasting food is a modern habit that cannot be stopped easily.\n\nOnly if the vast majority turns vegan over night can we change things. But that‚Äôs wishful thinking. People are selfish creatures.\n\nFirst of all, this argument goes too far ‚Äî things will definitely change if 30% of the population becomes vegan, which is is far from a ‚Äúvast majority‚Äù. But yes, there‚Äôs a core truth here ‚Äî that what any individual does has only a small (or even a negligible) effect on the industry."
