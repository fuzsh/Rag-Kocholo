        "text": "Pat was a positive, encouraging presence in the world. She was a woman who befriended the friendless and shared her kindness with everyone, especially those who needed it most.\n\nJust as America entered the final days of World War II, Henry and Ella (Baker) Hendricks welcomed their third child in Artesia, California. Born November 8, 1943, Patricia would be the family’s first and only girl. She was situated as the middle child between her two older brothers, John and Benson, and her younger brothers, Russel and Steven. As she grew older, Pat began taking on much of the housework to help out her mother, who was busy managing the family and caring for the younger children.\n\nEarly on in Pat’s life, her father was drafted. The entire Hendricks family moved to Edgerton, Minnesota, where they would remain until Pat entered high school. After beginning her education at Edgerton Protestant Reformed School, Pat transferred to Grand Rapids Christian High School when her family moved to Michigan. Throughout her teenage years, Pat embraced music. She played the piano endlessly and loved any opportunity to sing, whether it was at high school or in church.\n\nWhen she was just 16 years old, Pat met a handsome young man named Richard Haan. He was a sophomore at Dordt College, she a high school student. Though there was certainly a mutual attraction, they did not begin dating until Richard moved to Grand Rapids to attend Calvin College. By the time he graduated, Pat was 18 and the couple was enthusiastic to marry. On August 8, 1962, they had a beautiful ceremony at the Christian Reformed Church in Edgerton, Minnesota. They then moved to Chicago, where Richard took up teaching job. It was not long, however, before Richard was drafted and asked to move to Philadelphia. He and Pat moved out East in 1963 and, even after Richard’s service concluded, they decided to remain in Philadelphia to raise their family.\n\nPat was a very caring, devoted mother, as well as an excellent cook. Her favorite recipe was aptly referred to as “The Recipe,” and it consisted of an amazing turkey stuffing dish she shared on special occasions with her family and friends.\n\nWhether at home or out in the community, Pat enjoyed being part of people’s lives. She was actively involved in teaching Sunday School, leading Calvinettes, and participating in women’s groups and couple’s clubs. She also too time to crochet blankets for new parents and make quilts to donate to local mission groups.\n\nPat was sure to make time for herself and Richard as well. At home, they shared a love of gardening which, for Pat, had been inspired by their visit to Kuchenhoef Gardens in the Netherlands. Closer to home, she enjoyed spending afternoons at Longwood Gardens in Philadelphia. It was, in fact, one of her favorite places on earth. Over the years, Pat and Richard traveled all over the world, to destinations in Europe and across the United States. Since they particularly liked road trips, auto tours became their favorite way to explore America’s national parks. They took many cruises as well, to all sorts of bright, tropical locals.\n\nDuring their travels Pat and Richard met many friends, especially when they went camping. They ended up establishing some interesting traditions, including one that involved passing around a friend's discarded old bathing suit. Pat successfully rescued it from the trash can, and for years afterward they all took turns hiding it in each other’s homes and cars.\n\nPat and Richard shared an unforgettable life together, full of friends, laughter, and love. “I was always the dreamer,” Richard says, “and she made my dreams come true.”\n\nTo everyone, Pat was known as an extraordinarily caring woman. She took genuine interest in people and their lives, expecting nothing in return. Pat’s friends and family were incredibly blessed to share their lives with her, and they will always cherish the memories they created together.\n\nPatricia R. (Hendricks) Haan died Tuesday, December 7, 2004 at her home in Flagstaff, AZ. after a lingering illness. Members of her family include: her husband, Richard, children, Richard K. (Nicole) Haan and their children Shakayla and Jalen of Tuscon, AZ., Brenda and Michael Ankrom and their children Jacob and John, of Halfway, MO., Cynthia and Kolby Garrison and their son Kaleb of Greenville, S.C., her mother Ella Hendricks of Jenison. Also surviving are her brothers, John and Arlene Hendricks of Grandville, Benson and Rosalind Hendricks of Wyoming Russel and Susan Hendricks of Grand Rapids, Steven and Lucia Hendricks of Jenison and many nieces and nephews.\n\nPat’s Life Story Service will be held Tuesday at 10 a.m. at the Heritage Lifestory Funeral Home - 851 Leonard St. N.W. with Dr. Robert Godfrey of Westminster Seminary officiating. Further services will take place Friday at 2 p.m. at the United Reformed Church in Hills, MN. with interment in the United Reformed Cemetery. Friends may meet the family for one hour prior to the service on Tuesday.
