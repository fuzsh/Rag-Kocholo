        "meta_description": "BET proteins, which influence gene expression and contribute to the development of cancer, are epigenetic interpreters. Thus, BET inhibitors represent a novel form of epigenetic anticancer treatment. Although preliminary clinical trials have shown the anticancer potential of BET inhibitors, it appears that these drugs have limited effectiveness when used alone. Therefore, given the limited monotherapeutic activity of BET inhibitors, their use in combination with other drugs warrants attention, including the meaningful variations in pharmacodynamic activity among chosen drug combinations. In this paper, we review the function of BET proteins, the preclinical justification for BET protein targeting in cancer, recent advances in small-molecule BET inhibitors, and preliminary clinical trial findings. We elucidate BET inhibitor resistance mechanisms, shed light on the associated adverse events, investigate the potential of combining these inhibitors with diverse therapeutic agents, present a comprehensive compilation of synergistic treatments involving BET inhibitors, and provide an outlook on their future prospects as potent antitumor agents. We conclude by suggesting that combining BET inhibitors with other anticancer drugs and innovative next-generation agents holds great potential for advancing the effective targeting of BET proteins as a promising anticancer strategy.",

        "text": "BRD recruits several additional proteins to active genes that induce transcription by recognizing acetylated lysine residues in histones and transcribed proteins.23,104 The main way that BET proteins regulate transcription is by interacting with acetylated chromatin.105 Because of their significant significance in the pathophysiology of several diseases, BET proteins, a unique category of BD proteins, have the potential to be effective therapeutic targets. Numerous small-molecule compounds were formulated with the specific purpose of targeting BET proteins, presenting potential treatments for cancer, inflammation, cardiovascular diseases, and autoimmune disorders. These compounds hold promise for diverse cancer types, especially when employed alongside other small-molecule inhibitors and epigenetic modulators, yielding promising outcomes in certain cases. Nonetheless, the obstacles of pharmaceutical resistance and side effects persist, impeding the progress of BET inhibitors in clinical applications.106,107,108,109,110,111 The pursuit of enhancing medication effectiveness and minimizing drug-related adverse effects has led to the development of novel selective molecules. This section presents a detailed examination of several classes of BET inhibitors, elucidating their prospective applications and potential for novel drug development.\n\nNon-selective BET inhibitors\n\nA 2008 patent (PCT/JP2008/073864) first detailed the antitumor activity of BET inhibitors, which involves reducing the interaction of BRD proteins with acetylated histones. Two landmark investigations carried out in 2010 demonstrated that BET inhibitors have anticancer and anti-inflammatory properties.1,20 Subsequently, more new BET inhibitors have been discovered, exhibiting significant preclinical anticancer efficacy in many types of solid and hematological tumors.23,112,113\n\nJQ1, regarded as a pan-BET inhibitor with similar inhibiting effects against BD1 as well as BD2, was among the earliest BET inhibitors to become available.1 Differential scanning fluorometry revealed that JQ1 had the highest binding affinity for BRD4 among 41 human BD-containing proteins.1 By interacting with BRD4’s acetylation lysine binding region and removing BRD4 from nuclear chromatin, it induces differentiation and suppresses tumor development in BRD4-dependent carcinomas.1 In animal models, JQ1 has also shown promising pharmacodynamic and antitumor.1,114 Considering that JQ-1 has a brief in vivo half-life and hence modest translational prospective,1 numerous BET inhibitors, including OTX015, i-BET762, and NHWD-870, were recently developed and clinically investigated to evaluate their safety and effectiveness among individuals with hematologic malignancies or solid tumors (Table 1).\n\nOTX015 is a small-molecule inhibitor of BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 with a structure comparable to that of JQ1, and an important advancement is its oral administration.97,115,116 In a 2016 clinical trial, the effects of OTX015 on AML and ALL were examined.117 Exposure to OTX015 caused a potent decrease in BRD2, BRD4, as well as c-MYC, along with an increase in HEXIM1 protein levels, whereas BRD3 expression remained unchanged.118 These changes suggest that OTX015 may lead to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, and growth suppression.119 Additionally, research conducted in vitro has shown that OTX015 has promising synergistic effects with several anticancer drugs, particularly mTOR and BTK inhibitors.97\n\nI-BET is a synthetic that “mimicks” acetylated histones to disrupt chromatin complexes that are essential to the transcription of important genes associated with inflammation in activated macrophages.20 Previous studies have demonstrated that it provides a safeguard against lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxic shock and bacterial-induced sepsis.20 I-BET762 is an orally bioavailable BET inhibitor with pan-affinity for BET proteins, primarily targeting BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4.20,120 Studies have demonstrated that I-BET762 acts mainly through the downregulation of MYC and IRF4, as well as the upregulation of HEXIM1.121\n\nNHWD-870, a recently developed BET inhibitor, demonstrates notable efficacy in suppressing the proliferation of multiple cancers by downregulating the expression of macrophage CSF1 in tumor cells. In comparison to three prominent BET inhibitors currently in clinical development, namely BMS-986158, OTX015, and GSK525762, NHWD-870 exhibits greater potency, as evidenced by a cytometric assay.94 Currently, NHWD-870 is undergoing Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of various kinds of cancer (CXHL200250). Through controlling SPINK6, NHWD-870 has been shown in recent studies to significantly diminish melanoma invasion and metastasis both in vivo and in vitro,122 and NHWD-870 in combination with cytarabine demonstrated synergistic effects against melanoma both in vivo and in vitro.123 NHWD-870 has also shown excellent therapeutic potential in the treatment of osteosarcoma.124 NHWD870 exhibited a favorable contraceptive effect in in vivo animal experiments, and upon discontinuation of the drug, fertility can be restored to its baseline. This suggests a potential future role for NHWD870 as a male contraceptive. Nonetheless, its safety and efficacy require further investigation in preclinical studies.125\n\nNotably, the overall remission rate (complete/partial remission or stable disease status) for pan-BET inhibitors is less than 30% in most clinical trials based on current data.117,126,127,128 This low response rate might have something to do with the intermittent dosing schedule, whose purpose was originally designed to reduce targeted side effects such as thrombocytopenia.117,126,127 The primary challenge encountered in the development of pan-BET inhibitors is balancing the enhancement of drug efficacy with the reduction of side effects. Consequently, an important direction of BET inhibitor research is advancing the development of more potent or selective BET inhibitors.\n\nSelective BD1 inhibitors\n\nWhile the sequence similarity of BD1 and BD2 exceeds 75%, the similarity of their structural domains is merely 38%.129 The lack of specificity of pan-BET inhibitors towards BRD proteins and BD1 as well as BD2 has resulted in the occurrence of several undesirable effects. Consequently, enhancing selectivity by inhibiting either BD1 or BD2 exclusively may offer a potential solution to boost specificity, avoid adverse effects, and improve the clinical efficacy of BET inhibitors.23\n\nMS436, the earliest identified small nanomolar BD1 inhibitor, has a selectivity that is ten times higher towards BRD4-BD1 compared to BRD4-BD2.130 The selectivity of MS436 towards BD1 is associated with the hydrogen bonding interactions between MS436 and certain amino acid residues, including Pro82, Gln85, Lys91, and Asn140.130 In mouse macrophages, MS436 effectively inhibited the transcriptional activity of BRD4 in the NF-κB-driven generation of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL6 and nitric oxide.130 The subsequent inhibitor of this series, MS402, is nine-times more specific for BD1 than BD2.131 It effectively inhibits and mitigates colitis generated by T-cell metastasis in mice by impeding the excessive proliferation of Th17 cells.131\n\nOlinone has a 100-fold higher BD1 selectivity than BD2, and Olinone promotes mouse oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation, whereas JQ1 inhibits oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation, suggesting that selective regulation of individual BDs enhances cellular regenerative activity in aging and neurodegeneration.132\n\nGSK789, being a highly selective BET-BD1 inhibitor, exhibits selectivity for BD1 that is approximately 1000 times better than that of BD2. Comparable to the antiproliferative activities of pan-BET inhibitors, it maintains robust anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory activity in vitro.133\n\nSelective BD2 inhibitors\n\nRVX-208 was the earliest known BD2-selective BET inhibitor to induce a more specific expression profile compared with the gene expression altered in response to JQ1.134 The limited range of genes impacted by RVX-208 diminishes its efficacy as an antitumor medication, but because of its anti-inflammatory effects, it is well tolerated as a treatment for cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes.135,136,137,138\n\nABBV-744 exhibits a remarkable degree of selectivity towards BD2 in BRD2, BRD3, and BRD4 and has an affinity for BD2 that is hundreds of times higher than that for BD1.139,140 In contrast to RVX-208, which has limited efficacy as an anticancer agent, treatment with ABBV-744 produces potent antiproliferative effects in AML and prostate cancer.139,140,141\n\nSJ432 is a novel tetrahydroquinoline-like BD2 selective inhibitor that exhibits higher effectiveness than JQ1 in neuroblastoma models in vivo through sustained inhibition of expression of the driver oncoprotein c-MYC.142 This suggests that BD2-selective molecules may retain efficacy while mitigating several kinds of undesirable toxicity linked to excessive dosages of BET inhibitors, providing a strong rationale for the development of BD2-selective BET inhibitors in cancer therapy.\n\nBY27 is a compound that selectively inhibits BD2 and demonstrates promising anticancer properties.143 It has been found to effectively inhibit cancer growth in mice while exhibiting lower toxicity compared to pan-BET inhibitors.143 The unique structural features of BY27 make it a promising candidate for the development and synthesizing of future BD2 selective inhibitors.143\n\nHowever, there is ongoing debate surrounding the notion of specifically focusing on BD2 as a target for cancer therapy. Some researchers propose that selectively inhibiting BD1, while excluding BD2, is adequate to elicit the desired antitumor effects of pan-BET inhibitors.141 This stands in contrast to various BD2-selective BET inhibitors demonstrating potent anticancer activity, necessitating further investigation to reconcile these disparities. Nonetheless, it remains a fact that BD1 and BD2 may play different functions in the proliferation of diverse tissue types. Nevertheless, all the BD2-selective inhibitors have the ability to mitigate some of the undesired toxicity associated with pan-BET inhibitors.138,139,141,142,144 This suggests that the development of BET inhibitors that selectively target either the BD1 or BD2 domains might be a viable approach to improving their safety profile.\n\nBET degraders: PROTACs\n\nBET inhibitors prevent E3 ligase-mediated identification of the degradation region between BD1 and BD2, resulting in attenuated ubiquitination-dependent degradation of BET proteins, which causes frequent feedback upregulation of BET proteins themselves and leads to back-skipping of c-MYC expression.97,145 BET degraders offer a promising strategy for targeting BET proteins to overcome drug resistance by promoting BET protein breakdown to ensure a sustainable block of their function. The strategy is called PROTAC (Fig. 3).146,147 Target protein binder, E3 ligase recruitment element, and chemical linker make up the bifunctional small molecule known as PROTAC.148,149,150,151 The ligands situated on the two termini of PROTAC exhibit recognition capabilities towards the E3 ubiquitin ligase and the target protein, respectively, forming a ternary complex.152,153 The formation of the ternary complex facilitates the spatial closeness between the two proteins, leading to the polyubiquitination of the target protein, which subsequently undergoes destruction inside the cell via the action of the proteasome.152,153 Currently, cell inhibitor of apoptosis protein, cereblon ligand, murine double minute 2 ligand, and VHL ligand are the major E3 ubiquitin ligases used in PROTAC.154\n\ndBET1, the first BET degrader reported in 2015, was developed utilizing a thalidomide derivative and JQ1 as an E3 ligase handle, efficiently and selectively degraded multiple BET family members expressed in leukemic cells, and significantly reduced MYC levels.147 dBET1 significantly reduces BRD4 within an hour and completely degrades it in two, whereas JQ1 or thalidomide, as a single treatment, had no effect.147 As PROTACs completely deplete BRD4 protein levels and subsequent downregulation of MYC, they exhibit higher in vitro action than BET inhibitors.155,156,157 Although JQ1 is also used as a BD recruitment scaffold, the BET degrader MZ1 exhibits selectivity towards BRD4, suggesting that target selectivity might be improved by the introduction of the E3 ubiquitin ligase VHL.158 This is due to MZ1’s ternary crystal structure, which is linked to the VHL ligand via polyethylene glycol chains, allowing the development of particular interactions between molecules within the ternary complex, causing BRD4 to degrade selectively.159 MYC, CDK4, cyclin D1, and BTK are all significantly downregulated in a mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) cell line when exposed to BET degraders ARV-825 and ARV-771.155 ARV-771 has also shown antitumor efficacy in AML and CRPC models.160,161\n\nAlthough PROTACs hold great promise for drug development, off-targeting, cell permeability, and stability are still significant challenges for clinical applications. One potential problem to overcome is the difficulty of synthesizing hybrid molecules, a process that involves optimizing the size and composition of linkers as well as E3 ligase ligands. Additionally, the complete loss of BET proteins may result in potential adverse effects due to their critical role in physiological states. Hence, once these challenges are overcome, PROTACs are expected to become an important antitumor treatment, ushering in a new era of biopharmaceutical innovation.\n\nAlthough resistance to BET inhibitors is a significant impediment when it comes to clinical use, preclinical studies have shown that resistance to a single-target drug can be overcome when used in combination with other drugs, providing a bright future for BET inhibitors. Based on preclinical data, combining a BET inhibitor with another drug can produce synergistic effects in a variety of ways. There are currently several clinical trials that are investigating the use of BET inhibitors in conjunction with other medications (Table 2). The concurrent administration of BET inhibitors and other pharmaceutical agents also contributes to the mitigation of potential drug toxicity, because of their higher efficacy at lower drug doses.\n\nCombination with chemotherapy agents\n\nMultiple studies have shown evidence of the synergistic effects of BET inhibitors in combination with cisplatin in ovarian malignancies as well as mouse xenograft models, including those that are resistant to platinum-based treatments and relapsing models.216,217,218,219 Aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells are recognized contributors to tumor progression and relapse following initial chemotherapy response.220 This may stem from the differential impact of BET inhibitors, which suppress ALDH activity and ALDH1A1 expression, in contrast to the typical effect of cisplatin.217 Furthermore, ovarian cancer cells have exhibited a synergistic response through ALDH1A1 downregulation when combined with platinum-based chemotherapeutic agents.221 In addition, it has been demonstrated that BET inhibitors downregulate the expression of Bcl-2 and Survivin, increasing the sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells to cisplatin.218,222 Furthermore, the predominant mechanism of action is thought to be DNA damage induction,223 and BET inhibitors can decrease the expression and functionality of BRCA1 and RAD51 via inhibiting BRD4 and impair the reporting activity of homologous recombination (HR), thus making HR-proficient ovarian tumor cells more sensitive to DNA damage.216,224 Taken together, these findings present a compelling justification for the administration of BET inhibitors when combined with cisplatin for the treatment of HR-proficient ovarian carcinoma.\n\nTNBC is distinguished by the lack of clearly defined molecular targets, and its genomic heterogeneity poses limitations on the available treatment choices for chemotherapy. The use of platinum-based drugs is increasingly being recognized as a viable approach for the development of effective therapeutics targeting TNBC.225,226,227,228 Studies have shown that BET inhibitors can downregulate BRCA1 and RAD51 expression and impair homologous recombination-mediated DNA damage repair, thereby inducing the functional creation of a BRCAness phenotype in TNBC cells.224,229 Findings conducted in vitro have shown that TNBC cells with BRCAness are more sensitive to platinum salts. Clinical trials have also shown enhanced efficacy of carboplatin in TNBC populations with BRCA1/2 mutations.224,229,230 Furthermore, it has been shown that BET inhibitors have cytotoxic effects in combination with chemotherapy in in vitro tests on TNBC cells. JQ1 has been shown to have a synergistic interaction with mitotic drugs, such as docetaxel and vinorelbine, as well as with DNA-damaging agents like cisplatin and carboplatin.230\n\nIn a study on colorectal cancer, the concurrent administration of BET inhibitors together with 5-fluorouracil or oxaliplatin demonstrated a noteworthy enhancement in the effectiveness of treatment in colorectal cancer cell.231,232 Recently, the mechanisms underlying these findings have also been explored. Death receptor 5 (DR5) is an essential constituent of the extrinsic apoptotic pathway in colorectal cancer cells.233 Studies have shown that depletion of BRD4 and treatment with BET inhibitors significantly induce DR5 expression.232 The induction of DR5 is regulated by endoplasmic reticulum stress and CHOP, which is critical for the chemical sensitization and apoptotic effects of BET inhibitors.232 Additionally, increased DR5 induction is also responsible for enhancing the sensitivity of colorectal malignancies containing SPOP mutations to BET inhibition.232 The BRD4 E3 ubiquitin ligase subunit SPOP is important for regulating this process.234 Combining BET inhibitors with chemotherapy effectively inhibited cancer development in a DR5-dependent manner in a colorectal cancer xenograft model; moreover, enhanced DR5 induction and apoptosis could effectively suppress the growth of patient-derived xenograft tumors.232\n\nIn summary, the use of BET inhibitors in conjunction with chemotherapy is a highly effective approach to cancer treatment that can improve outcomes, minimize toxicity, and prevent drug resistance (Fig. 4a). However, it is important to note that this combo treatment may potentially raise the possibility of treatment-related adverse events. Therefore, the selection of the optimal combination therapy regimen requires a comprehensive evaluation of the patient’s individual characteristics, disease status, and tumor type.\n\nCombination with PARP inhibitors\n\nIn preclinical animal models of ovarian carcinoma with HR proficiency, BET inhibitors have demonstrated an ability to heighten tumor sensitivity to PARP inhibitors.224 This outcome could potentially stem from BET inhibitors diminishing HR activity while intensifying the DNA damage response prompted by PARP inhibitors. BET inhibitors can impact the transcription of pivotal HR genes like RAD51 and BRCA1.224 Additional research has demonstrated that BET and PARP inhibitors exhibit synergistic activity against BRCA1/2 wild-type ovarian malignancies. This can be attributed to the downregulation of DNA topoisomerase II binding protein 1 (TOPBP1) and mitosis inhibitor protein kinase WEE1 by BET inhibitors.235 Prior to mitosis, at G2/M cell cycle checkpoints, WEE1 is essential in stopping DNA repair.236 Whereas TOPBP1 is crucial for DNA replication and damage signaling.237 Downregulation of TOPBP1 renders cells highly sensitive to PARP inhibitors.238,239 Hence, directing interventions toward WEE1 and TOPBP1 may make BRCA1/2 carcinoma cells sensitive to PARP inhibitors.\n\nBET inhibitors enhance DNA damage induced by PARP inhibitors.224 Investigations conducted in a breast carcinoma model found that the combined use of JQ1 and olaparib markedly inhibited cancer development, which was related to the inhibition of BRCA1 and RAD51 expression by BET inhibitors.224,229\n\nAs part of a study to better understand their underlying mechanisms, researchers assessed the antiproliferative activity of the PARP inhibitor olaparib and the BET inhibitor JQ1 on PDAC in vitro and in vivo.240 The findings indicated that the combined application of JQ1 and olaparib exerted synergistic effects in vitro and were more effective in the independently derived PDX model in vivo than either drug alone.240 This could be attributed to JQ1’s ability to decrease the association between BRD4 and BRD2 with Ku80 and RAD51 promoter sites, and data from short hairpin RNA (shRNA) suggested that the expression of Ku80 and RAD51 in PDAC cell lines was dependent on BRD4 and BRD2.240 These findings offer a novel strategy of combining BET inhibitors and PARP inhibitors as a promising approach for treating PDAC and may lead to more strong countermeasures against this kind of cancer (Fig. 4b).\n\nFurthermore, researchers evaluated the effects of combining BET inhibitors (JQ1 or I-BET762) with PARP inhibitors (olaparib or veliparib) on the cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) cell lines, as well as the effectiveness of JQ1 and olaparib in a CCA xenograft model.241 The results demonstrated that the efficacy of each combination therapy surpassed that of each medicine administered alone.241 Mechanistically, downregulation of the BET inhibitor molecular targets BRD2 or BRD4 using shRNA rendered CCA cells sensitive to BET inhibitors as a single drug and in combination with a PARP inhibitor.241 These results provide valuable information on the potential of combining BET inhibitors and PARP inhibitors as a novel approach to treating CCA. Moreover, a synergistic effect has been observed between BET inhibitors and PARP inhibitors.242\n\nAlthough the combination of BET inhibitors and PARP inhibitors has shown promising prospects in antitumor therapy, there are also potential risks and limitations. For example, combined use may increase the toxicity of the treatment, which could lead to immune system suppression and liver damage. Therefore, while the combination of BET inhibitors and PARP inhibitors is a promising antitumor treatment approach, further research is needed to validate and refine its effectiveness.\n\nCombination with immune checkpoint inhibitors\n\nIt has been identified that BET inhibitors are suppressors of CD274 (encoding PD-L1), acting at the transcriptional level via the inhibition of BRD4. As a result, there is a downregulation of PD-L1 expression on the surfaces of both tumor cells and immune cells.243,244,245 The combination of BET inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors has demonstrated more effective synergistic effects than monotherapy, both in vivo and in vitro.244 Furthermore, evidence supporting the effectiveness of combination treatment was provided by the development of a mathematical model to simulate the combined action of BET and immune checkpoint inhibitors in breast cancer.246\n\nBET inhibitors were shown to reduce BRD4 binding to the promoter of the encoded PD-L1 gene, hence downregulating PD-L1 expression levels in a mouse model of Eμ-myc transgenic lymphoma.244,247,248 This has led to the idea of combining BET inhibitors with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as anti-PD-1 antibodies, to target the PD-1/PD-L1 axis. Combining these two types of inhibitors produced a synergistic response in mice harboring MYC-driven lymphomas, indicating an interaction between BET inhibitors and PD-1/PD-L1 immune checkpoints.244\n\nCombining JQ1 with anti-PD-L1 antibodies to treat liver cancer in transgenic mice could strongly inhibit tumor progression.249 The effectiveness of this combination therapy is associated with BET inhibitor-induced upregulation of Rab8A expression, which can upregulate PD-L1 expression on the cell membrane and sensitize PD-L1 blockade (Fig. 4c).249 Overall, this combination therapy promotes the anticancer effect of anti-PD-L1 antibodies and enhances the liver’s anticancer immune response. In a mouse model of primary liver cancer bearing a heart xenograft, researchers explored a combination immunotherapy strategy employing JQ1 alongside the anti-PD-L1 antibody.250 The utilization of a combined immunotherapy strategy significantly inhibited the advancement of primary liver cancer without accelerating xenograft rejection.250 This presents an innovative and effective treatment strategy for solid organ transplant recipients.\n\nSignificant synergistic effects between BET inhibitors and PD-L1 inhibitors have been demonstrated in colorectal cancer,251 NSCLC,252 and prostate cancer.253 The combination of BET inhibitors and immune checkpoint inhibitors is a promising antitumor treatment approach, providing more treatment options for cancer patients. However, combination therapy also has potential risks and limitations. For example, it may increase the toxicity of treatment, leading to immunosuppression and liver damage. Further research is necessary to verify its safety and efficacy and to determine the optimal approach for combination therapy.\n\nCombination with PI3K inhibitors\n\nResearch has shown that BET inhibitors have the ability to enhance the susceptibility of ovarian cancer cells to phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors and inhibit the reactivation of the PI3K pathway subsequent to PI3K inhibitor therapy.254 Furthermore, it has been shown that BET inhibitors possess the ability to block receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and the subsequent signaling pathways they activate. However, ovarian cancer cell lines can acquire resistance to BET inhibitors through adaptive reprogramming.84 The development of such resistance mechanisms primarily depends on the reactivation of the signaling pathway. Therefore, combination therapy involving BET inhibitors and kinase inhibitors may be a potential strategy for mitigating BET inhibitor resistance and improving the efficacy of BET inhibitor therapy. The synergistic impact of combining ponatinib with BET inhibitors has proven effective in ovarian cancer treatment. The heightened anticancer potency achieved through the combination of ponatinib and BRD4-targeted agents is related to the reduction of MYC expression inside cancer cells.255 One compelling study has shown that BET/PI3K combination therapy has synergistic effects in tumor organoid models derived from patients with ovarian clear cell carcinoma, offering a potential treatment option for this rare subtype of chemoresistant ovarian cancer.256 Nevertheless, further preclinical research is necessary to verify the effectiveness and security of this approach.\n\nResearch has indicated that persistent mTORC1 activation diminishes sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors, while inhibiting mTORC1 enhances PI3K inhibitor efficacy and prolongs resistance delays.257,258 Resistance to PI3K inhibitors frequently occurs via the mechanism of feedback activation of RTKs, such as the AKT and mTOR pathways (Fig. 5a).259,260,261,262,263 RTKs belonging to the epidermal growth factor receptor and insulin receptor families have been identified as direct targets of BRD4 in multiple cancer models.254 In these models, the inhibition of BET proteins can effectively regulate the PI3K signaling pathway in breast cancer cells.254 This regulation is achieved by preventing the recruitment of BRD4 to the regulatory regions of these receptors, thereby blocking the feedback activation of the RTKs.254 The combination inhibition of PI3K/BET in breast cancer cells demonstrated an effectively curbed reactivation of AKT and mTORC1, re-sensitizing the cells to PI3K inhibitors.254 This combination therapy’s effectiveness was also substantiated through an in vivo mice model of breast cancer.254 Researchers studying breast cancer cells discovered that combining therapy with JQ1 and the dual PI3K/mTOR inhibitor BEZ235 could prevent chromatin structure alterations, prevent malignancy cells from developing resistance, and cause xenograft regression in vivo as well as in vitro cell death.264 Significantly, this combination also exhibited remarkable synergy in hepatocellular carcinoma265 and colorectal cancer,266 showcasing the effectiveness of BET inhibitors in countering tumor resistance to dual PI3K/mTOR inhibition. This discovery offers an innovative and effective treatment strategy for cancer therapy. Notably, this combination treatment can also inhibit the development of drug-tolerant persisters, making therapy more durable and effective.264\n\nActivation of PI3K performs an essential function in the pathogenesis of lymphomas driven by the MYC oncogene, making it a prospective target for therapeutic intervention.267,268,269 Several studies have investigated the effectiveness of combined treatment, including BET and PI3K inhibitors, in various lymphomas, such as DLBCL97,101,270 Burkitt’s lymphoma (BL),270,271 MCL,272,273 marginal zone lymphoma,273 chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL),273,274 peripheral T-cell lymphoma,273 and mouse MYC-stimulated lymphoma cells.275 Combination therapies involve multiple mechanisms of action. First, BET inhibitors can improve the antiproliferative effect of PI3K inhibitors by increasing GSK3β S9 phosphorylation levels and β-catenin abundance through the downregulation of the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBE2C and UBE2T.270 Second, PI3K inhibitors upregulate various constituents within the B-cell antigen receptor pathway, whereas BET inhibitors downregulate some of these components (e.g., SYK, BLK, CD79A, and CD79B), thereby counteracting the adaptive response induced by idelalisib.276,277 Additionally, NF-κB activity is critical for the viability of some malignant cells and is maintained by the constitutive activity of IKK in the cytoplasm.278 By suppressing the expression of BRD2 and BRD4, BET inhibitors reduce IKK activity and block the downstream NF-κB-driven transcriptional program, which may strengthen the combined effect.97,101\n\nCombination with mTOR signaling pathway inhibitors\n\nEverolimus is an effective and safe oral inhibitor of mTOR, utilized in the treatment of breast carcinoma patients.279 This occurrence of resistance to everolimus has been linked to MYC upregulation, which is associated with higher BRD4 recruitment to MYC in everolimus-resistant cell lines.280,281 BET inhibition has been found to restore sensitivity in cells that are resistant to mTOR inhibitors.281 in vitro and in vivo studies have revealed that the combined therapy of everolimus and JQ1 exhibits higher effectiveness compared to the use of either drug alone.281 in vitro and xenograft models exhibited that OTX015, an innovative BET inhibitor, had synergistic antiproliferative effects when combined with everolimus.282 Additionally, the mTOR inhibitors rapamycin and Torin were previously found to enhance the susceptibility of JQ1-resistant cells to BET inhibition.280\n\nmTOR has become a crucial therapeutic target in certain hematolymphoid tumors.283 BET inhibitors, when combined with mTOR inhibitors, have also shown strong synergistic effects against a variety of lymphomas and solid tumors.44,97,101,271,275,276,284,285 One possible mechanism is the inhibition of BET proteins, which leads to the restoration of sensitivity in drug-resistant cells towards mTOR inhibitors. However, since thrombocytopenia is a common toxicity of these two types of drugs, it is necessary to pay attention to drug side effects when using them in combination.44\n\nA study using various molecular subtypes of patient-derived SCLC xenograft models demonstrated that, without appreciably raising toxicity, mTOR inhibition enhances BET inhibition’s anticancer activity in vivo.286 Moreover, BET inhibition induces apoptosis in SCLC models both in vitro and in vivo; the anticancer effect is further enhanced by cotreatment with mTOR inhibition.286 Activation of the intrinsic apoptotic pathway is the mechanism through which BET inhibition induces apoptosis in SCLC cells.287 BET inhibition upregulates RSK3, which activates the TSC2/mTOR/p70S6K1/BAD cascade to promote cell survival; however, this protective signaling can be blocked by mTOR inhibition to enhance BET inhibition-induced apoptosis (Fig. 5b).286\n\nCombination with MEK inhibitors\n\nResearch has demonstrated evidence for synergistic benefits when treating ovarian cancer in vivo and in vitro with BET and MEK inhibitors, such as JQ1 and PD0325901 or trametinib, combined.288 BET inhibitors have been shown to induce cell cycle arrest rather than apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells, which may impose limitations on the potential therapeutic application for individuals with advanced ovarian cancer.288 However, the combined use of BET and MEK inhibitors can circumvent this constraint since co-administration of MEK inhibitors can nullify the BET inhibitor-induced feedback activation of the MAPK signaling pathway.288 Research has shown that the co-administration of BET and MEK inhibitors can coordinate the regulation of apoptotic molecules, such as BIM and BAD, and induce tumor cell apoptosis in ovarian cancer cells.288 Moreover, combining BET inhibitors with MEK inhibitors can also overcome resistance resulting from kinome reprogramming in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1)-deficient ovarian cancer cells, where MEK inhibitors transcriptionally induce the reactivation of RTK and its downstream pathways.289 Large-scale genomic studies have revealed that NF1, a RAS guanosine triphosphatase (GTPase)-activating protein that negatively regulates RAS family proteins, is lost in 12% of epithelial ovarian tumors.290,291 The loss of NF1 leads to the reactivation of RAS effector pathways, including PI3K/mTOR/AKT, RAF/MEK/ERK, and RALGDS signaling, which contributes to neoplastic proliferation and survival.290,292,293 MEK inhibitors trigger the transcriptional reactivation of RTK and its downstream pathways by destabilizing FOSL1, encompassing the RAF/MEK/ERK, JAK/STAT, and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways.289 However, in epithelial ovarian cancer cells lacking NF1, MEK inhibitor-induced RTK reprogramming renders them resistant to trametinib treatment, thereby reducing the growth inhibition of tumor cells by MEK inhibitors.289 BRD2 and BRD4 have been discovered to be pivotal players in the transcriptional regulation of RTKs in NF1-deficient cells, and functional inhibition of the BET protein has demonstrated the ability to counteract MEK inhibitor-triggered elevation of RTK RNA and protein expression.289 Therefore, BET and MEK inhibitors combined might serve as a beneficial therapeutic approach for NF1-deficient ovarian carcinomas; however, it is crucial to recognize that this combination therapy may not be effective for epithelial ovarian cancer cells that are NF1-sufficient.289 Overall, the combined use of BET and MEK inhibitors suggests a potentially advantageous strategy for addressing ovarian cancer therapeutically.\n\nIn TNBC, trametinib inhibits MEK to block the MEK/ERK pathway, resulting in a robust initial growth suppression. However, suppression of MEK/ERK triggers the activation of an alternate kinase pathway that inhibits growth. This upregulation allows the growth arrest to be overcome by an adaptive bypass response.294 BET inhibitors make trametinib-resistant cells more sensitive to the drug by inhibiting BRD4 and effectively reverse trametinib resistance by inhibiting the adaptive upregulation of RTKs.295 BET inhibitor and trametinib combined therapy produced synergistic growth inhibitory effects in different TNBC mouse models in vitro and in vivo.295 The concurrent administration of BET and MEK inhibitors has a synergistic effect on reducing the viability of TNBC cell lines and patient-derived xenograft models, suggesting that this treatment strategy may be a promising therapeutic option.296 Of particular note, this study found that cells exhibiting elevated expression levels of MYCN demonstrate heightened sensitivity towards BET inhibitors,296,297 providing a basis for extending the use of BET and MEK inhibitors in individuals who suffer from late-stage TNBC expressing MYCN.296 The finding has the potential to open up novel avenues for the development of more precise therapeutic interventions.\n\nLimited research supporting the synergistic antitumor effects of BET and MEK inhibition in melanoma exists.298,299 One possible mechanism is that the co-administration of BET and MEK inhibitors can alleviate the transcriptional characteristics of MAPK and checkpoint inhibitor resistance, downregulate the transcription factor TCF19, and induce cell apoptosis.298\n\nCombination with tyrosine kinase inhibitors\n\nLapatinib is a small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets HER2 as well as the epidermal growth factor receptor.300,301 It was approved by the FDA in 2007 for the treatment of advanced or metastatic breast cancer that overexpresses HER2 and was previously treated with anthracyclines, taxanes, and trastuzumab.300 However, resistance to lapatinib significantly limits its effectiveness against breast cancer.302 FOXOs are tumor suppressors that upregulate the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors and pro-apoptotic proteins.303,304 When the PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is activated, the protein kinase AKT directly phosphorylates FOXO at three conserved sites, leading to the translocation of FOXO from the nucleus and inhibition of transcriptional activity.305 Lapatinib treatment upregulates MYC by inhibiting AKT-mediated phosphorylation of FOXO, and FOXO-mediated overexpression of MYC reduces the susceptibility of breast carcinoma cells to lapatinib.306 The sensitivity of HER2-positive cell lines and HER2-positive xenograft models to lapatinib can be enhanced by BET inhibitors via the reduction of lapatinib-induced upregulation of MYC (Fig. 5c).306 Another adaptive response contributing to lapatinib resistance involves kinome reprogramming through the reactivation of ERBB2/ERBB3 signaling, transcriptional upregulation, and activation of multiple tyrosine kinases.307 BET inhibitors can re-sensitize breast cancer cells to lapatinib by dissociating BRD4 and RNA Pol II from lapatinib-induced kinase genes.307 In summary, the use of a combined therapeutic strategy with BET inhibitors and lapatinib has promise as a more effective therapy modality for individuals diagnosed with breast carcinoma.\n\nSunitinib serves as an innovative oral multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor that received approval from the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of individuals with clear cell renal cell carcinoma or gastrointestinal stromal tumors.308 Prior research has demonstrated the therapeutic effect of sunitinib on melanoma, which is further enhanced by propranolol.309 BET inhibitors can hinder the development of melanoma through the noncanonical NF-κB/SPP1 pathway.103 Research has shown that the co-administration of BET inhibitors with sunitinib elicits a synergistic inhibitory effect on melanoma in vitro and in vivo.310 The main mechanism is the sensitization of melanoma cells to sunitinib via the inhibition of BET proteins.310 This inhibition leads to the suppression of GDF15 expression, which is controlled either directly through BRD4 transcription or indirectly through the BRD4/IL-6/STAT3 axis (Fig. 6a).310 This provides a promising alternative treatment option for melanoma.\n\nCombination with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors\n\nHDACs are of paramount importance in the context of malignancy because they deacetylate histones and non-histone proteins that regulate the cell cycle, apoptosis, DNA damage response, metastasis, angiogenesis, and autophagy.311 HDAC inhibitors can counteract the abnormal acetylation state in cancer cells and activate tumor suppressors.311 In comparison to therapy with JQ1, mocetinostat, or valproic acid alone, the combined use of HDAC and BET inhibitors demonstrated synergistic benefits in breast cancer cell lines and significantly reduced cell viability.312 It was discovered that TNBC cells were more sensitive to mocetinostat-JQ1 and valproic acid-JQ1 combinations than to ER-positive cells.312 The main mechanism underlying this combination treatment is the attenuation of the RAS/MAPK signaling pathway and the upregulation of ubiquitin-specific peptidase 17, leading to decreased cell viability.312\n\nHDAC and BET inhibitors have been demonstrated to elicit growth arrest and apoptosis in DLBCL,97,285,313 MCL,272 and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma314 cell lines with good synergistic activity. One possible mechanism for this combination is the application of HDAC inhibitors in AML, which results in histone hyperacetylation.315 Simultaneous histone hyperacetylation increases cellular dependence on BET proteins, rendering them sensitive to BET inhibition.316 Additionally, BET and HDAC inhibitors combined significantly attenuated the expression of MYC and BCL2, thereby increasing apoptosis induction.314 Novel compounds that possess the ability to simultaneously target BRD4 and HDAC proteins have been synthesized, taking advantage of the synergistic effects seen when combining BET and HDAC inhibitors.317,318,319,320\n\nCombination with BCL2 inhibitors\n\nBET inhibitors and BCL2 inhibitors showed significant synergy in several cancer cell lines, including DLBCL,173,313,321 MCL,272 CLL,322 cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, acute leukemia,323 and multiple myeloma.173 Treatment with both drugs induces apoptosis more than treatment with either drug alone, and BET inhibitors increase cancer cell sensitivity to BCL2 inhibitors.173,313,314,321,323 These effects may occur because of BET inhibitors that enable the downregulation of different anti-apoptotic proteins, including BCL-XL, BCL2, and BCL2A1, and the upregulation of pro-apoptotic proteins like BIM and/or PUMA, in leukemia, lymphoma, and multiple myeloma cell lines (Fig. 4d).173,313,314,321,323 In a study of germinal center B-cell (GCB)-like DLBCL cell lines, researchers found an inverse relationship between sensitivity to the BET inhibitor ABBV-075 and sensitivity to the BCL2 inhibitor venetoclax.173 Further, the level of apoptosis induced by BET inhibitor treatment of GCB-DLBCL cells was negatively correlated with BCL2 expression.173 These findings suggest that BET and BCL2 inhibitors might exhibit complementary effects in the GCB-DLBCL individuals and that BCL2 expression levels or previous responses to BCL2 inhibitors can be used to identify GCB-DLBCL subpopulations that are more likely to undergo apoptosis when treated with BET inhibitors.173,324\n\nCombination with ATR inhibitors\n\nATR inhibitors lead to enhanced DNA damage and the initiation of apoptosis, whereas BET inhibitors induce DNA damage as well as the upregulation of genes involved in DNA repair.275,276 In studies on mouse MYC-induced lymphoma BL275 and MCL276 cell lines, it was found that the synergistic effects of BET and ATR inhibitors combined. The primary mechanism is that combined treatment of B-cell lymphomas with ATR and BET inhibitors results in gene expression profiles similar to those of the senescence-associated secretory pathway and endoplasmic reticulum stress.275 BET inhibitors enhance ATR inhibitor-induced cellular stress and cell death.275 Two main ATR inhibitors are currently being investigated in clinical trials,325,326 and although some toxicities (e.g., thrombocytopenia and anemia) may overlap, the combination of BET and ATR inhibitors holds immense potential.\n\nOne study on melanoma found that both human and mouse melanoma cells were sensitive to combination therapy with ATR and BET inhibitors in vitro and in vivo, possibly due to their synergistic induction of cell apoptosis and senescence-associated secretory pathway.327 This provides novel insights and directions for the treatment of melanoma and may serve as a reference for the treatment of many additional tumor forms.\n\nCombination with AKT inhibitors\n\nAKT inhibitors induce the expression of CDK6 by binding to the forkhead box class O 3a (FOXO3a)/BRD4 combination located at the CDK6 promoter.328 CDK6 is an oncogenic kinase that controls G1/S phase transition and cell cycle progression.329,330 Cell lines that express high levels of CDK6 exhibit increased RB phosphorylation and disruption of cell cycle arrest, rendering them resistant to AKT inhibitors.328 Resistance to PI3K/AKT inhibition can be promoted by the FOXO3a/BRD4/CDK6 axis. However, the combined inhibition of AKT and BET, which blocks the simultaneous PI3K/AKT and FOXO3a/BRD4/CDK6 pathways, proves to be more efficacious compared to monotherapy (Fig. 5c).328 in vivo experiments in mice have also confirmed that BET inhibitors sensitize luminal breast cancer cells to AKT inhibitors.328 In breast cancer cell lines, on the other hand, overexpression of AKT3 is a common characteristic of acquired resistance to AKT inhibitors, and BET inhibitors can reverse this effect by inhibiting AKT3 expression.331\n\nMutations in the gene encoding the substrate-binding adapter protein POZ of the E3 ubiquitin ligase SPOP are the most common in primary prostate cancer.332 Prostate cancer-specific SPOP mutations impair BET degradation, making cells more resistant to cell growth inhibition and apoptosis induced by BET inhibitors.145,234 Research has shown that BRD4 accumulation triggers an increase in the expression of GTPase RAC1 and genes involved in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, leading to the activation of the AKT/mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) signaling pathway and the development of resistance to BET inhibitors.333 However, resistance can be overcome by the synergistic use of BET inhibitors in conjunction with AKT inhibitors, and this strategy has been shown to be effective against SPOP-mutant prostate cancer.333\n\nCombination with BTK inhibitors\n\nInhibition of BTK is a well-established treatment for B-cell malignancies. BET inhibitors exhibit strong synergy with ibrutinib in B-cell lymphomas.276 Such effects have been noted across a range of lymphoma types, including DLBCL,101,284,334,335,336,337 MCL,272,276,336,337 BL,271 CLL, and anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma models.274 One plausible explanation for this synergy lies in the on-target side effects associated with BET inhibitors, which may restrict the obtainable clinical dosages. Combining BET inhibitors with ibrutinib could enable achieving comparable antitumor responses at lower doses, thereby mitigating overall toxicity. Another possible explanation is that although ibrutinib showed effectiveness in B-cell lymphoma, most patients didn’t observe a sustained response. Therefore, the efficacy of ibrutinib could be improved by a combination of BET inhibitors. In anaplastic large T-cell lymphoma, combining ibrutinib with a BET inhibitor yielded enhanced interleukin-2-inducible T-cell kinase (ITK) downregulation, leading to a more potent ITK inhibition.334\n\nCombination with endocrine therapy\n\nCompared with parental cells, BET inhibitors selectively inhibit the expression of ER alpha by inhibiting BRD3/4 and attenuate the growth of tamoxifen-resistant, ER-positive cells to an even larger extent.89 In addition, transcriptome array analysis of paired luminal breast cancer tumors showed that ENST00000456526, a luminal long non-coding RNA (lncRNA), is overexpressed in luminal breast cancer.338 ER-positive tamoxifen-resistant cells exhibit a higher level of lncRNA of luminal (LOL) expression compared with parental cells, and downregulation of LOL enhances the sensitivity to tamoxifen treatment in tamoxifen-resistant breast cancer cells and xenograft models (Fig. 6b).338 BET inhibition reverses tamoxifen resistance in ER-positive cells by reducing LOL expression.338 In conclusion, BET inhibitor-induced LOL knockdown may represent a potentially effective strategy for hindering the progression of luminal breast cancer and overcoming tamoxifen resistance in patients exhibiting a high level of LOL expression. Furthermore, JQ1 and fulvestrant combined hindered the proliferation of tumors in a tamoxifen-resistant murine xenograft model.89\n\nESE-15-ol is an antimitotic compound that interferes with microtubule dynamics in cells during active division and induces mitotic cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis.339 The combined use of BET inhibitors and ESE-15-ol exhibited considerable synergistic activity against TNBC cells.340\n\nCombination with Aurora kinase inhibitors\n\nHigh-throughput drug screening has revealed that the combination of BET and Aurora kinase inhibitors is potentially effective in the treatment of ovarian cancer.288 The combination of the BET inhibitor JQ1 and Aurora kinase inhibitors has shown promising synergistic effects in drug-resistant ovarian cancer cell lines.341 However, further investigation is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms, and clinical trials are warranted to assess the efficacy of this combined therapy for ovarian cancer treatment.\n\nCombination with EZH2 inhibitors\n\nA study on aggressive B-cell lymphomas identified a feed-forward loop involving MYC, miRNA, and EZH2; MYC overexpression facilitated the recruitment of EZH2 to the miR-26a promoter, resulting in a synergistic suppression of miR-26a.342,343 BET and EZH2 inhibitors were found to disrupt MYC activation, leading to synergistic inhibition of lymphoma proliferation and clonogenicity in aggressive lymphoma cells.342 Another study found that BET inhibitors downregulated EZH2 and H3K27me3, a marker of EZH2 activity, in DLBCL cells. Stronger downregulation was observed when BET and EZH2 inhibitors were combined.284 This combination therapy may be promising for addressing therapies aggressive B-cell lymphoma.\n\nAberrant activity of EZH2 and BRD4, two H3K27 modifiers, is a key driving factor in atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT), and targeted inhibition of these modifiers represents a potential therapy approach for AT/RT treatment.344,345,346,347,348,349 In AT/RT cells, H3K27me3 and H3K27ac levels are elevated and distributed at different chromatin regions to regulate specific gene expression and promote tumor growth.346,350 The proliferation of AT/RT cells is suppressed, their invasiveness is reduced, and the levels of H3K27me3 and H3K27ac are decreased by the specific suppression of EZH2 and BRD4 activity.351 The concurrent inhibition of EZH2 and BRD4 shows superior in vitro and in vivo therapeutic benefits, surpassing the therapeutic outcomes seen with individual agent treatments.351\n\nThe combination of BET and EZH2 inhibitors demonstrated superior tumor growth inhibition in diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma via blocking proliferation and promoting apoptosis in vitro as well as in vivo.352\n\nA recent study assessed the combination of EZH2 and BET inhibitors within metastatic prostate cancer cells and found superior reduced cell viability, proliferation, and clonogenicity compared with single-agent treatment, while c-MYC and NF-kB expression were reduced.353 While this finding provides a novel approach to treating metastatic prostate cancer, the efficacy and safety of this combination require further validation via in vivo experiments and preclinical studies.\n\nCombination with CREBBP/EP300 inhibitors\n\nBET and CREBBP/EP300 inhibitors combined also demonstrated significant synergistic activity and increased cell death rates.354 A recent study on multiple myeloma cell lines found that the novel dual BET and CREBBP/EP300 inhibitors, NEO2734 and NEO1132, exhibited stronger in vitro antitumor effects compared with individual inhibitors targeting either BET or CREBBP/EP300.355 In multiple myeloma cell lines, the dual inhibitors induce significant G1 cell cycle arrest and reduce c-MYC and IRF4 protein levels, indicating their potential as a therapeutic option for multiple myeloma.355 NEO2734, a novel antitumor compound, has demonstrated superior antitumor activity in lymphoma, leukemia, and prostate cancer.356,357\n\nThe newly developed inhibitor XP-524, which targets EP300/CBP of histone acetyltransferase and BRD4, demonstrated higher potency and superior antitumor activity compared with single-agent BET inhibition in PDAC.358 In addition to inhibiting KRAS/MAPK signaling, XP-524 enhances self-peptide presentation and tumor recruitment of cytotoxic T lymphocytes, despite their refractory nature, even after full activation.358 Notably, one study found that the combination of XP-524 with an anti-PD-1 antibody in vivo reactivated the cytotoxic immune program and significantly prolonged survival.358 This suggests that XP-524 has promise as a novel treatment alternative for PDAC, and its combination with immune checkpoint inhibitors warrants further investigation.\n\nCombination with PRMT5 inhibitors\n\nPRMT5 overexpression has been regularly documented in cell lines for lymphoma and leukemia, and its increased expression has been shown to induce the symmetrical methylation of H3R8 and H4R3. Furthermore, studies on MCL have found that PRMT5 overexpression correlates with decreased miR-92b and miR-96 expression.359 Research has shown that selective inhibition of PRMT5 expression produces anti-lymphoma activity.360 BRD4 binds to the 5’ regulatory region of PRMT5, and treatment with BET inhibitors mis localizes BRD4 from this region. This downregulates arginine methyltransferase expression and reduces PRMT5 occupancy at the cancer suppressor miR-96-5p promoter, leading to the inhibition of miR-96-5P.361 This suggests that combining BET and PRMT5 inhibitors could be a new strategy for lymphoma treatment.\n\nCombination with PLK inhibitors\n\nIn a study on BET inhibitor-acquired resistance in TNBC cell models, BET inhibitor-resistant cells were found to be particularly sensitive to PLK1 inhibition.362 Inhibition of PLK1 exhibited an antiproliferative effect in resistant cells, causing G2/M arrest and upregulation of the cell cycle proteins Bcl-2, pH3, and cyclin B, along with the induction of caspase-dependent apoptosis.362 This suggests that BET and PLK1 inhibitors combined may provide a new treatment option for BET inhibitor-resistant patients.\n\nBET proteins are central regulators of AR and MYC-mediated transcription in CRPC,88 whereas PLK1 inhibitors not only affect the cell cycle but can also downregulate AR and MYC.363,364 Hence, a novel dual inhibitor of BET and PLK1, WNY0824, was synthesized, exhibiting nanomolar-level and equipotent inhibition against both BRD4 and PLK1.365 WNY0824 has demonstrated superior antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo, providing an innovative therapeutic option for the treatment of CRPC.365"
