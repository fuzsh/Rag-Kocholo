        "text": "Carrier Free\n\nWhat does CF mean?\n\nCF stands for Carrier Free (CF). We typically add Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) as a carrier protein to our recombinant proteins. Adding a carrier protein enhances protein stability, increases shelf-life, and allows the recombinant protein to be stored at a more dilute concentration. The carrier free version does not contain BSA.\n\nWhat formulation is right for me?\n\nIn general, we advise purchasing the recombinant protein with BSA for use in cell or tissue culture, or as an ELISA standard. In contrast, the carrier free protein is recommended for applications, in which the presence of BSA could interfere.\n\n213-ILB\n\nFormulation Lyophilized from a 0.2 μm filtered solution in PBS with BSA as a carrier protein.

It is secreted by several helper T cell subsets, NK cells, mast cells, eosinophils, basophils, and visceral smooth muscle cells (1‑3). Mature human IL-13 shares approximately 58% amino acid sequence identity with mouse and rat IL-13. Despite the low homology, it exhibits cross‑species activity between human, mouse, and rat (4). IL-13 suppresses the production of proinflammatory cytokines and other cytotoxic substances by macrophages, fibroblasts, and endothelial cells. On B cells, it promotes cellular activation, immunoglobulin class switching to IgE, and the up‑regulation of CD23/Fc epsilon RII (1, 5). IL-13 binds with low affinity to the transmembrane IL-13 R alpha 1 which then forms a signaling complex with the transmembrane IL-4 R alpha (6‑8). This high affinity receptor complex also functions as the type 2 IL-4 receptor (6, 7). IL‑13 R alpha 2 inhibits responses to both IL-13 and IL-4. It binds IL-13 with high affinity (9, 10) and prevents IL-13 from signaling through the IL-13 R alpha 1/IL-4 R alpha complex (11, 12). It also blocks signaling through IL-4-occupied IL-13 R alpha 1/IL-4 R alpha receptor complexes (12, 13). In addition, IL-13-bound IL-13 R alpha 2 can directly promote tumor cell invasiveness and the development of tissue fibrosis (14‑16).\n\nSaggini, A. et al. (2011) Int. J. Immunopathol.
