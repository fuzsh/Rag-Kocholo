        "text": "Population structure of Han Chinese in Taiwan\n\nWe first performed a principal component analysis (PCA, implemented in EIGENSTRAT (15)) with a global (GLOBAL) set of samples (the 10,801 TWB samples and 2,504 samples from the 1000 Genomes Project (1000G) (16)). To overcome the possible influence from inter-marker linkage disequilibrium (LD) on the PCA (17) and to fulfil the limitation of number of SNPs for running later admixture analysis, 16,824 autosomal SNPs were selected to be evenly distributed across the human genome and virtually independent of the neighbouring SNPs. Here, we constrained the selection by inter-marker LD r2 < 0.3 within 5-Mb sliding windows, which is more stringent than in previous studies (8,9,18,19). The scatter plot of the first two principal components (PC1 and PC2), accounting for 66% and 22% of variation, respectively, showed that the TWB samples and 1000G samples clustered into three large groups, East Asians, Africans and a third group that included Europeans, admixed Americans and Southern Asians (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1A). As expected, all of the TWB samples and the 1000G East Asians (EAS) samples belong to the East Asian cluster. The 1000G EAS samples include Chinese Dai in Xishuangbanna, China (CDX), Han Chinese in Bejing, China (CHB), Southern Han Chinese, China (CHS), Japanese in Tokyo, Japan (JPT) and Kinh in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam (KHV). We then performed PCA with the ASIAN subset (the 10,801 TWB samples and the 504 1000G EAS samples). The first two PCs, accounting for 18.4% and 12.3% of variation, showed a triangle, in which the JPT samples clustered together at the top-left vertex, the CDX and KHV sampled located at the bottom left vertex and all of the Han Chinese samples sprayed across the central to the third vertex (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B). The Han Chinese samples themselves also formed an inner triangle in which most of the CHB samples were located close to the top angle, the CHS samples were dispersed in the centre of the triangle, and the majority of the TWB samples were located along the long side opposed to the top angle (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B). Comparison between the 7,792 Min-nan and 1,002 Hakka subjects of TWB (defined as subjects who self-reported that both parents were of Min-nan and Hakka origins respectively) showed a significant difference in PC1 (Wilcoxon rank-sum test P < 0.0001) but not in PC2. In particular, the Min-nan individuals showed a greater variance along PC1 axis than the Hakka individuals (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1C). However, as the two subgroups could not be clearly discriminated based on PC1 and PC2 (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1C), we grouped these two subgroups in further analyses.\n\nInterestingly, a north-to-south trend, starting with the JPT samples and sequentially followed by the Han Chinese samples (CHB, CHS and TWB), the KHV samples and the CDX samples, lay along PC1. In particular, the positions on PC1 for the TWB subjects were roughly analogous to the latitudes of their self-reported ethnic origins on the TWB questionnaire (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1D); this pattern is consistent with those reported in previous studies of Han Chinese population structure (8,9). On the other hand, a unique spread of TWB samples along PC2 was noted (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1B) that has not been noted in previous studies of Chinese populations (8,9). To explore this further, we performed the following analyses to dissect subpopulations in the TWB and reference populations.\n\nWe carried out admixture analysis (implemented in ADMIXTURE (20)), based on the same 16,824 SNPs, with a subset of the GLOBAL set that comprised all of the 2504 1000G samples and 450 TWB samples to avoid influence by a large sample size used from a single population. The minimum cross-validation error rate was obtained at K = 9 for our analysis. In the admixture plot (Supplementary Material, Fig. S1E), all East Asian groups shared higher proportions of the ancestry-assigning probabilities of K5 and K9. The six groups lay down along PC1 in the ASIAN PCA plot in an order that reflected decreasing K5 proportion, or the north-to-south trend (JPT, CHB, CHS, TWB, KHV and CDX).\n\nConsidering that within-population variations in TWB could be overshadowed and undetectable in the combined analysis with all of the 1000G multi-ethnic samples, we repeated the admixture analysis using only the ASIAN set. The minimum cross-validation error rates was obtained at K = 4, suggesting the existence of four components of ancestry. Further hierarchical clustering based on the four ancestry-assigned probabilities was also performed. Under the assumption of four ancestry populations (K1 – K4), all of the Japanese samples (denoted as J) showed a higher proportion of K2, which might present a norther origin ( ). On the other hand, the CDX and KHV samples (denoted as D and K, respectively) shared a higher proportion of K4, which might present a southern origin ( ). These three groups were firstly differentiated in the hierarchical cluster tree ( ).\n\nInterestingly, a novel pattern appeared among the Han Chinese samples ( ). In addition to the north-south two-way partition, the Han Chinese samples clustered into three large groups. By the self-reported parental origins of the TWB samples (Supplementary Material, Table S2), one group was classified as the northern (N) Han Chinese, which shared the northern origin (K2) with the Japanese group. The second group was classified as the southern (S) Han Chinese, which shared the southern origin (K4) with CDX and KHV. Both S and N shared a higher proportion of K1, which indicated a major origin of Han Chinese. In addition to the S and N subgroups with higher proportions of K1, K2 and K4, a third group (T) with a relatively high K3 was detected ( ). The emergence of this unique T group was further demonstrated by the hierarchical cluster tree; the S and N groups clustered together before the T group merged into this large branch ( ).\n\nOf particular note is that the newly identified T group is not a minority one. Of the TWB samples, 14.5% were classified into the T group, and 79.9 and 5% were classified into the S and N groups, respectively ( ). Equally interesting is that the T group is not unique in TWB, and is found in 10.7% of CHB individuals, 6.7% of CHS individuals, 2% of KHV individuals ( ). To better understand the nature of the T group, we then explored the self-reported ethnicity. Although the T group is more distant from S and N in the hierarchical cluster tree, 98.8% of the S group individuals and 97.1% of the T group individuals self-reported that both parents were of southern Han Chinese origin (i.e. Min-Nan, Hakka and individuals originally from other southern China provinces) compared with only 49.1% for the N group (Supplementary Material, Table S2).\n\nWe further annotated the groups in the PCA plot of the ASIAN set ( ). The PC1 values reflected the geographic latitudes of the ancestral origins of the J, N, S, K and D samples from north to south. PC2, on the other hand, distinguish the T group from the N and S groups ( ). This unique pattern substantially departs from the north–south division in Han Chinese that has been observed in previous studies (8,9) and is reminiscent of a distinct T group (T1, which differentiated very early from the rest of the sample in hierarchical clustering) forming a gradient of different proportion of admixture with the S group in this sample of Han Chinese from Taiwan.\n\nGiven these patterns, we then focused on the three-group division model of Taiwanese and further divided the three groups into nine subgroups (S1-S3, N1-N2 and T1-T4) by hierarchical clustering ( ). Notably, although the T group could be detected in CHB and CHS samples, none of the CHB or CHD individuals belonged to the T1 subgroup ( ). The fixation index (FST) (21) was also estimated among the nine subgroups of TWB (Supplementary Material, Table S3). The FST values were small (0–0.008) but reflected, in part, the inter-group correlations revealed by the admixture analysis.\n\nWe annotated the nine subgroups under the assumption of K = 4 ancestry populations in the PCA plot of the ASIAN set ( ). Three Han Chinese subgroups located at the vertices of the triangle (N2, S2 and T1) represent three distant populations, whereas the other Han Chinese subgroups, except for S1, may represent admixture populations of the three distant populations ( ). On the other hand, the S1 samples were sporadically distributed at the southern end of Han Chinese and close to the southern Asian groups K and D, suggesting an admixture of Han Chinese and more southern origins. This is consistent with the observation that the S1 subgroup is genetically distant from the other S subgroups, as suggested by the early split of S1 from the other S samples in the hierarchical cluster tree ( ). We note that the four subgroups (N2, S1, S2 and T1) are evenly distributed across the Taiwan Island with no obvious clustering pattern (Supplementary Material, Fig. S2), attesting to the internal homogenization with respect to geography of the island since the immigration event over the last few centuries."
