        "text": "Methods\n\nDuring February 1, 2022–May 31, 2023, adults aged ≥60 years with acute respiratory illness§ and laboratory-confirmed RSV, SARS-CoV-2, or influenza infection who were admitted to any of 25 hospitals in 20 U.S. states participating in the Investigating Respiratory Viruses in the Acutely Ill (IVY) Network¶ were eligible for inclusion in this analysis. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from patient or proxy interview and medical records, including in-hospital outcomes observed by day 28 of hospitalization. Upper respiratory specimens were collected from enrolled patients near the time of admission and tested at a central laboratory (Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, Tennessee) by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. Patients who received a positive RSV, SARS-CoV-2 or influenza result based on either hospital or central laboratory testing within 10 days of illness onset or within 3 days of hospital admission were included.\n\nSeverity of RSV disease was compared with COVID-19 and influenza severity using the following in-hospital outcomes: 1) standard flow oxygen therapy, defined as receipt of supplemental oxygen at <30 L/minute; 2) receipt of high-flow nasal cannula (HFNC) or noninvasive ventilation (NIV); 3) intensive care unit (ICU) admission; and 4) receipt of invasive mechanical ventilation (IMV) or death. For this analysis, enrolled patients were excluded if they had confirmed or inconclusive laboratory test results indicating coinfection with RSV, SARS-CoV-2, or influenza or if data for in-hospital outcomes were missing.\n\nIn-hospital outcomes were compared among patients hospitalized with RSV disease, COVID-19, and influenza using multivariable logistic regression. Models were adjusted for age, sex, self-reported race and Hispanic or Latino (Hispanic) ethnicity, number of organ systems associated with a chronic medical condition, and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services geographic region. Differences among respiratory viruses were assessed for each outcome; p-values <0.05 were considered statistically significant. All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version 9.4; SAS Institute). This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy.**\n\nResults\n\nDuring February 1, 2022–May 31, 2023, a total of 6,061 adults aged ≥60 years were enrolled in IVY Network with acute respiratory illness and laboratory-confirmed infection with RSV, SARS-CoV-2, or influenza. After exclusion of 277 patients,†† 5,784 were included in this analysis, among whom 304 (5.3%) were hospitalized with RSV, 4,734 (81.8%) with COVID-19, and 746 (12.9%) with influenza. Substantial seasonal variation in hospital admissions was observed for RSV and influenza, but SARS-CoV-2 admissions exhibited less seasonal variation (Figure).\n\nThe median age of adults hospitalized with RSV (72 years) was similar to the age of those hospitalized with COVID-19 (74 years) and influenza (71 years) (Table 1). Among patients hospitalized with RSV or COVID-19, percentages of non-Hispanic Black or African American (Black) patients were similar (18.1% and 16.8%, respectively); however, among patients hospitalized with influenza, the percentage of Black patients was higher (188; 25.2%). Patients hospitalized with RSV had chronic medical conditions associated with a median of two organ systems, a finding similar to that for patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or influenza. Among the 5,784 included patients, 4,713 (81.5%) had received ≥1 dose of original (ancestral) monovalent or bivalent (ancestral and BA.4/5) COVID-19 vaccine, and 2,795 (48.3%) had received seasonal influenza vaccination.§§\n\nIn adjusted analyses comparing RSV severity with COVID-19, patients hospitalized with RSV were more likely than hospitalized COVID-19 patients or hospitalized influenza patients were to receive standard flow oxygen (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.97 [COVID-19] and 2.07 [influenza]), HFNC or NIV (aOR = 2.25 [COVID-19] and 1.99 [influenza]), or to be admitted to an ICU (aOR = 1.49 [COVID-19] and 1.55 [influenza]) (Table 2). The odds of the composite outcome of IMV or death between patients hospitalized with RSV and patients hospitalized with COVID-19 was similar (aOR 1.39; 95% CI = 0.98–1.96); however, among hospitalized adults aged ≥60 years with RSV, the odds of IMV or death were significantly higher compared with hospitalized influenza patients (aOR 2.08; 95% CI = 1.33–3.26).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe findings from this study demonstrate that RSV is an important cause of respiratory virus–associated morbidity and mortality in older adults. In this prospective, multicenter analysis in which all enrolled older adults hospitalized in 20 U.S. states during 2022–2023 received testing for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza, RSV-associated hospitalizations were less frequent than were COVID-19–associated and influenza-associated hospitalizations; however, clinical outcomes in patients hospitalized with RSV were worse than those among patients hospitalized with COVID-19 or influenza. Because RSV disease is less common than COVID-19 or influenza disease among hospitalized patients, clinicians might be less aware of RSV as a serious respiratory pathogen in older adults.\n\nThe findings in this analysis are consistent with those from earlier studies that compared RSV disease severity among hospitalized adults with influenza disease (2–4). Although outcome definitions vary across studies, most demonstrate that patients hospitalized with RSV disease are more likely to be treated with supplemental oxygen, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission than are patients hospitalized with influenza disease (2–4).\n\nAn important finding in this analysis is that older adults hospitalized with RSV were also more likely to receive standard flow oxygen therapy, HFNC or NIV, or be admitted to an ICU, compared with patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Few studies have compared RSV severity with that associated with COVID-19, and those that have were completed in 2020, before emergence of the Omicron variant and introduction of COVID-19 vaccines (4,5). Those studies demonstrated that patients hospitalized with RSV were less likely to experience ICU admission, mechanical ventilation, and in-hospital death than were patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Higher RSV severity relative to that of COVID-19 observed in this analysis is likely due to a combination of factors, including 1) reduced severity of Omicron variant sublineages circulating during the period of this analysis, 2) substantial increases in vaccine- and infection-conferred immunity against SARS-CoV-2, and 3) increases in use of antiviral treatments (6,7).\n\nThe high RSV disease severity observed among older adults in this analysis is important to guide decision-making for RSV vaccination in this population. Although neither of the two clinical trials that led to Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of RSV vaccines for older adults was powered to assess protection of RSV vaccination against hospitalization in adults aged ≥60 years, both trials showed moderate to high efficacy of RSV vaccination against lower respiratory tract disease, which is in the causal pathway leading to severe disease (8,9). Although additional studies are needed to assess protection of these vaccines against severe respiratory disease in older adults, RSV vaccination has the potential to prevent severe respiratory disease and is currently the only approved prevention product available for older adults.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe findings in this report are subject to at least three limitations. First, it is possible that RSV was preferentially detected among more severely ill patients who were more likely to receive clinical testing for RSV at participating hospitals and be subsequently enrolled. However, all patients with acute respiratory illness who were enrolled in IVY Network also received central testing for RSV, SARS-CoV-2, and influenza. During the period of this analysis, IVY Network enrolled 5,955 patients aged ≥60 years with acute respiratory illness who did not have a clinical diagnosis of RSV, SARS-CoV-2, or influenza, and only 25 (0.4%) received a positive RSV test result, based on central testing. Thus, any potential selection bias related to increased detection of RSV among more severely ill patients is likely minimal. In addition, the consistency of RSV severity findings in this analysis compared with findings from other studies that have used different methods lessens these concerns (2,3). Second, although COVID-19 and influenza vaccination, as well as antiviral or immunomodulatory treatments, have been shown to reduce severity of in-hospital outcomes, results were presented as unstratified respiratory virus groups to represent the overall population hospitalized with RSV, COVID-19, or influenza during the analysis period. Finally, although sample size was sufficient for the results presented, a larger sample size would have allowed for evaluation of mortality as an independent outcome or adjustment for additional patient characteristics (e.g., immunocompromising conditions).\n\nImplications for Public Health Practice\n\nThese findings suggest that although RSV hospitalizations occur less frequently than COVID-19 or influenza hospitalizations, RSV disease among hospitalized adults aged ≥60 years in the United States during February 2022–May 2023 was more severe than that associated with COVID-19 and influenza. New FDA-approved RSV vaccines for adults aged ≥60 years are expected to prevent lower respiratory tract disease (1). Health care providers and older adults should consider RSV disease severity when making a shared clinical decision about RSV vaccination (1)."
