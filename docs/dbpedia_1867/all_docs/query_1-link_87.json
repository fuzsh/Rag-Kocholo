Maximum length of Macrobrachium nipponense was 117 mm, which is bigger than in other places, maximum weight was 13.8 g. The highest abundance was 12 individuals/m2. M. nipponense dispersed from the place of introduction on a distance of 210 km. The most probable pathways of dispersal are the natural spread in the rivers, and unintentional or intentional introduction by fishponds owners in isolated ponds. Since 1986 M. nipponense population on our territory became tolerant to low winter temperatures of water 0.2°С-2.5 С, this fact also contributed to extension of their area and in the neighboring countries water bodies."
