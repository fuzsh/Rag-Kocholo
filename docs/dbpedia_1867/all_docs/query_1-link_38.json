        "text": "What is a #startupvillage‚ùì It is a place (or a network of small places) that embraces #innovation and ambitious #entrepreneurship as a way to unlock development potential and support wellbeing in #rural areas. By combining #local place, people, and purpose with external #knowledge, resources, and markets, the #startup village strives to provide favourable conditions for entrepreneurial and innovative #ecosystems to flourish. You can visit the web pages of the üá™üá∫ European Commission Startup Village #Forum, download the conceptualisation paper and browse into the mapping tool üëá https://lnkd.in/dZDYznEM You will find 4Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£ examples of startup villages across the #EU. Other interested villages or networks of villages can join, fill the questionnaire and be featured on the map. The web pages will also include findings from our ongoing analytical effort on understanding the elements and framework conditions enabling innovation in rural areas, how to measure it (which metrics we should adopt) and how to assess which #policy articulation would best fit.

In the inaugural Insight Report from our data collaboration project with Systemic Innovation, we are diving into a transformative realm ‚Äì the convergence of data and collaboration. You are invited! We invite you to explore how public and private stakeholders, hand in hand, can harness the potential of data in #Kenya, #Rwanda and #Ethiopia. The insights report illuminates the indispensable value of unified efforts in cultivating thriving entrepreneurial ecosystems. What's at stake? - Eradicating data fatigue - Cultivating normalised data utilisation - Addressing information silos and asymmetries These are key stepping stones towards establishing a robust data infrastructure. Join us in laying the groundwork for a data-driven future! Read the Insight Report ‚û°Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/dj-cfd5X Stay tuned as we embark on this exciting journey in the weeks and months ahead! Let us know your thoughts in the comments section below as we work to shape a data-powered East Africa together. #DataCollaboration #EastAfricanEcosystems #Innovation ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶. This project is delivered in partnership between GrowthAfrica and Systemic Innovation with the support of the The RISA Fund (Research and Innovation Systems for Africa) programme, a multi-country Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) funded project supporting research and innovation systems strengthening in #Africa. RISA is currently working in 6 countries in Africa: #Kenya, #Rwanda, #Ethiopia, #Nigeria, #Ghana and #SouthAfrica to support projects that have catalytic effects on the research and innovation ecosystems. #Africa #innovation #research #growth #entrepreneurs #impact #scale #data #collaboration #Africanscalecraft Mark Lawler Edith Maloba Anziyah Jordan Kyongo MSc, MPH, PhD Dr. Emmy Chirchir (PhD) MBS Belinda Bowling Scott Walker Lydiah Zachary Mbadi Olila Alexandrine Royer George Windsor Geofrey Oduwo\n\nüì£ Breaking New Ground: Launching the First-Ever African Entrepreneurial Ecosystem at GEC+ Africa #GECPlusAfrica24 In the presence of African ministers, researchers, policymakers, investors and entrepreneurs, we unveiled the very first African Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Index (AEEI) at the Global Entrepreneurship Conference Africa in Cape Town. The launch of the AEEI marks a significant milestone in our efforts to better understand and support entrepreneurship on the continent. Developed using scientifically rigorous and societally relevant entrepreneurial ecosystem analytics, the AEEI consists of seven key challenge areas, each made up of multiple data points. Examples of key challenge areas include ‚Äògovernance‚Äô (quality of the rule of law but also, for example, how easy it is to register a business) and support (the extent to which people have networks, presence of support hubs, etc.). Other key challenge areas include human capital, finance, market access, culture and infrastructure. üåü Mauritius sets the pace, but the true value lies in digging a level deeper Mauritius leads the way at number one and South Africa with Tunisia as runners-up in second and third place respectively. A total of 27 African countries are included in this first edition of the index. Although we had hoped to include more countries, there was a considerable gap in data availability. We're dedicated to working with entrepreneurship ecosystem stakeholders to broaden our data sources to enable us to add more countries to the index and provide even more comprehensive insights in the years ahead as more and better data becomes available. Rankings aside, the real power of the AEEI is in the underlying disaggregation of the index in the seven key challenge areas. By compiling this Africa Entrepreneurial Ecosystem Index, we offer better insights into the strengths and weaknesses of entrepreneurship conditions in Africa, alongside helping to identify areas for improvement to better support entrepreneurship and contribute to economic development on the continent. üíñ A collaborative effort The AEEI was developed by a team of dedicated researchers, data analysts and policy experts from the Allan Gray Centre for Africa Entrepreneurship, Universiteit Utrecht and i4Policy. We very much enjoyed the deliberation and discussion on data quality, data availability and data sources and are proud to present the full index and its underlying sub-indicators with you at https://lnkd.in/dZ_kDd9G üëÄ Keep an eye out for future updates!

We're advancing actionable recommendations: 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enhanced Coordination: Improve coordination among public agencies, nationally and internationally, for efficient support to growth ventures. 2Ô∏è‚É£ Academic Insights: Invest in academic research, especially on high-growth firms, with longitudinal case studies for deeper understanding. 3Ô∏è‚É£ Scale Diagnostics: Greater use of tools to assess organisational dynamics and overcome growth barriers. 4Ô∏è‚É£ Impact Reporting: Integrate growth data with impact reporting for positive societal contributions. 5Ô∏è‚É£ Data & Knowledge Sharing: Disseminate ecosystem data and knowledge for nuanced growth evaluation.

All in all, these ideations and innovations end up in the hands of developed countries like China and US, because they know what to do and how to implement these. They commercialise them and they use them to take even the little remaining from the same countries, where ideators and innovators who sold them live. Surprisingly these developing countries like Uganda end up buying them at an astonishing cost. countries where alot of innovations are produced everyday and sold in developed countries at P-Nut, have only managed to register a volume not exceeding 400 Patents under its custody (URSB), but individuals selling none registered ideas and innovations to developed countries are in thousands and have sold millions of ideas to them. Countries that office handlers ignore ideators and take them for granted. They think innovators are beggers trying to seek a nut from them. I am surprised that when you get to other developing countries like üá∑üáº Rwanda, their ears are widely open..., they are willing to understand your intention, they make sure that they deep dive into your tabled solution, and they will make sure that they convince you to be part of them. look at their results?? they are developing at a terrified speed. Now Countries like UGANDA üá∫üá¨....., Where those responsible think they are small gods in these offices and believe that they were put there to think for the rest have ended up reversing back the initiatives and vision of the mission.. When will Africa wake up???... the answer is, Till PUBLIC SERVANTS CHANGE THE NARRATIVE OF THINKING THEY KNOW WHAT TO DO INDEPENDENTLY. Public officers in-charge, switch off their phones. They will never get back to you, they never reply!!! They are conco sure that they are God sent... It surprises me that people like the Deputy speaker of the ugandan Parliament the Rt. Hon. Thomas Tayebwa pick calls, reply massages and ask questions regarding a tabled matter. But public servants in public offices responsible for such, think that its a burden to listen to what citzens concerned table.. Innovators have ended up selling their patents to developed countries at the end. And these developed countries are developing at this cost.. I HAVE DEVELOPED A SYSTEM USING (AI) ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENT, THAT CAN HELP ANY GOVERNMENT COLLECT USD 1.5M MONTHLY WITHOUT TOUCHING ANY TAX SLOT. A SERVICE INNOVATION SHARED BY PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR.. But surprisingly, its another country already developed that has invited me for talks after fighting for a year to meet those responsible over the same in the Ugandan government and failed to catch one. The question is,.. When will Africa develop?"
