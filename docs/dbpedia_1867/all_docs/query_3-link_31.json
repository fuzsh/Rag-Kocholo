        "text": "Biography\n\nI grew up in Lansing, Illinois and studied mechanical engineering at Calvin. I believe I was made to combine engineering and teaching. I love aerodynamics, wind, rockets, aircraft, buildings, and machines. I also love measuring all of the above and figuring out the best ways to teach all of the above. In addition, I love theology, philosophy, history and literature and how studying these topics can prevent you from being a naïve engineer that underestimates the complexity of problems and thinks all the world’s problems could be solved if we just applied the right technology. Throughout my career, I have taught at various places, but I always wanted to get back to Calvin some day. Calvin University is the perfect place to combine engineering and teaching in this way. My colleagues and I are all pursuing the goal of glorifying God and training Christ’s agents of renewal for our broken world.\n\nWhen I’m not working, I’m probably reading a book, watching a Chicago Cubs game, hiking through the woods, practicing my Chinese, or wondering how long I have to wait for another episode of a Star Wars show to drop. When I’m driving, I’m probably driving my 1993 Toyota Previa. It has 244,000 miles on it, and I’m pretty sure I’m going to drive it into the New Jerusalem.\n\nCourses Taught at Calvin\n\nENGR-101 Introduction to Engineering Design\n\nENGR-204 Circuit Analysis and Electronics\n\nENGR-305 Mechanics of Materials\n\nENGR-314 Vibration Analysis\n\nENGR-324 Materials and Processes in Manufacturing\n\nENGR-334 Dynamics of Machinery\n\nENGR-W83 Sustainable Energy Systems\n\nOver my career, I have taught courses in measurement and instrumentation, vibration analysis, propulsion systems, aerodynamics, fluid mechanics, manufacturing, structural analysis, engineering design, stochastic processes, and aeroelasticity.\n\nRecent Activities"
