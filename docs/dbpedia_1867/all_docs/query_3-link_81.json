        "text": "Dakota\n\nConcert band, Fanfare, Brass band, accordion ensemble\n\nGrade: 3\n\nDuration: 8:10\n\nHall Leonard Europe\n\nSummary\n\nThis composition, centered on the Dakota (Sioux) Indians of North and South Dakota, is divided into five movements that explore their culture and history. The movements depict the Dakota’s spiritual beliefs, buffalo hunting traditions, the symbolism of pipe smoking, the sorrowful Ghost Dance, and the tragic events at Wounded Knee, a site of pilgrimage for the Dakota people. Jacob de Haan incorporates an old South Dakota Indian melody in some movements.\n\nAbout Dakota\n\nThe Dakota (or Sioux) Indians from the American states North and South Dakota are the central figures in this composition. The work consists of five movements in which the culture and history of these Indians have been portrayed. In a few movements, Jacob de Haan has used an old Indian melody from South Dakota.\n\nThe Great Spirit\n\nThe culture of the Dakota Indians was related to the earth and spirit world. They believed that the Great Spirit created the earth by casting a black ball onto the water, and that from a second ball, he created all living things.\n\nBuffalo Hunting\n\nTo gallop up to a powerful buffalo required skill and courage. Yet men looked forward to the chance to prove themselves in the hunt.\n\nSmoking the Pipe\n\nThe pipe was the symbol of peace and was used as such between men and nations. Smoking the pipe stood for a bond of good faith, and a holy man smoking the pipe would be in communion with the Great Spirit.\n\nThe Ghost Dance\n\nThis religious dance of lost hopes was based on prayer, dance, and song. In 1890, the soldiers engaged the Ghost Dancers at a place called Wounded Knee.\n\nPilgrims at Wounded Knee\n\nThe tragedy of Wounded Knee is very painful to the Indians. Many still make the pilgrimage to the sacred, windblown hilltop where so many innocent people were killed."
