For up-to-date details on the efforts to welcome people fleeing the war in Ukraine and to provide temporary protection, see the dedicated page Migration management: Welcoming refugees from Ukraine.\n\nOverall situation\n\nBased on data from UNHCR, all around the world there were:\n\n36.4 million refugees at mid-2023 and\n\n62.5 million internally displaced persons (due to conflict and violence) at the end of 2022.\n\nFact to consider: At the end of 2021, less than 10% of all the world’s refugees and only a fraction of internally displaced persons were living in the EU. By the end of 2022, as a result of the war in Ukraine, the share of refugees living in the EU increased to more than 20%.\n\nThe share of refugees in the EU was 1.5% compared to its total population.\n\nNumber of refugees compared to total population\n\nSeveral countries around the world host a large refugee population:\n\nSource: UNHCR\n\nNote: The graph shows the ten countries hosting the most refugees and the EU\n\nFact to consider: The majority of refugees from Africa and Asia do not come to Europe, but rather move to neighbouring countries.\n\nMigration to and from the EU\n\nBased on the latest annual figures (2022)\n\n6.98 million persons\n\nimmigrated to the EU\n\n2.73 million persons\n\nemigrated from the EU\n\n4.25 million persons\n\ntotal net immigration to the EU\n\nNote: data for 2022\n\nWhile irregular migration is often in the spotlight, the reality is that irregular entries account for a small fraction of migration in the EU.\n\nIn 2022, over 3.4 million first residence permits were issued in the EU, compared to 2.9 million in 2021, exceeding numbers seen before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic (3.0 million in 2019). The number of first permits issued by Germany (+190%) and Ireland (+146%) more than doubled when compared to 2021. In 2022, there was a particularly large increase of asylum-related (+60%) permits but the number of permits issued for education (+29%), family (+29%) and other reasons (+47%) also increased year-on-year. On the other hand, the number of permits issued for work-related reasons decreased compared to 2021 (-6%). In 2022, first permits were issued for the following reasons:\n\nSource: Eurostat; “other” includes permits issued for the reason of residence only, permits issued to victims of trafficking of human beings and unaccompanied minors, as well as permits issued for all other reasons for which residence permits may be issued and which are not covered by the other categories\n\nTop 10 nationalities of first residence permits issued in EU Member States in 2022\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nSeeking asylum in Europe\n\nFirst time asylum applicants by continent of origin (2023)\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nTop 15 nationalities of first time asylum applicants (2023)\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nIn 2023, asylum seekers came from close to 150 extra-EU27 countries.\n\n1,129,800 applications, including 1,049,000 first time applications, were lodged in the EU in 2023, an increase of 18% in comparison to 2022, and of 62% compared to 2019, before COVID.\n\nA significant share of applicants come from visa-free countries (21% of asylum applicants in 2022, down from 22% in 2021, with a high number of applicants from Latin America) who enter the EU legally, mostly from:\n\nVenezuela (6.0% of all applications)\n\nColombia (5.6%)\n\nGeorgia (2.2%)\n\nPeru (2.1%)\n\nUkraine (1.2%)\n\nMost first-time applications were lodged in:\n\nGermany (329,000)\n\nSpain (160,500)\n\nFrance (145,100)\n\nItaly (130,600)\n\nGreece (57,900)\n\nRelative to the population, in 2023, the highest number of first-time asylum applications was lodged in:\n\nCyprus (1,300 per 100,000 inhabitants)\n\nAustria (650)\n\nGreece (600)\n\nFirst time asylum applications per 100,000 inhabitants in 2023:\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nIn 2022, 271,500 people seeking asylum were under 18 years old – at least around one out of ten (31,0001) were unaccompanied minors. Most unaccompanied minors came from Afghanistan, Syria and Somalia.\n\nRecognition of refugees\n\nIn 2023, EU countries issued 673,000 first instance asylum decisions. 53% of these decisions were positive:\n\n152,000 persons received refugee status,\n\n129,700 were granted subsidiary protection status,\n\n75,400 received humanitarian status.\n\nIn 2023, at least a further 43,700 final decisions2 were issued following an appeal, including:\n\n5,800 decisions granting refugee status,\n\n1,700 granting subsidiary protection status,\n\n10,400 granting humanitarian status.\n\nOverall, EU countries granted protection to at least 375,100 people in 2023.\n\nEffectiveness of the asylum system\n\nFluctuating backlog\n\nAt the end of 2023, 883,000 asylum applications were pending - 39% more than the previous year, and double that of the period between 2017-2021.\n\nVarying processing times across Member States\n\nThe ratio of pending cases and applications varies widely across Member States, reflecting the differences in processing time. According to the EU Agency for Asylum (EUAA) data, at the end of 2023, 49% of the cases pending at first instance had been pending for more than six months.\n\n1Missing data for CZ, EL, ES, HR, CY, LT, NL\n\n2Missing data for CZ, DE, EL, ES, FR, HR, CY, LT, NL\n\nNumber of pending applications compared to total number of applications in a given month\n\nSource: Eurostat\n\nVarying recognition rates across EU countries\n\nThe EU’s asylum system is undermined due to significant differences in recognition rates across EU countries. For example, in 2023 the recognition rate of Afghan citizens at first instance (not including humanitarian status) ranged from 13% in Bulgaria to 99% in Ireland (from those Member States that issued at least 100 first instance decisions to Afghan citizens).\n\nDublin rules in practice\n\nIn 2022, Member States reported 174,500 outgoing requests under the Dublin rules sent to other Member States and other countries participating in the Dublin system to take responsibility for examining an application for international protection. Out of 158,200 decisions on such requests, 97,700 (62%) were accepted and 13,300 outgoing transfers were executed, corresponding to 14% of accepted requests.\n\nResettlement\n\nIn 2022, around 17,300 people in need of international protection were resettled from non-EU countries to EU Member States, 6% less than in 2021 but 97% more than in 2020.\n\nSyrian nationals accounted for 63% of the people resettled.\n\nUnder joint EU resettlement schemes, more than 117,000 persons found protection in the EU since 2015. In addition, since 2021, more than 46,000 persons, mostly Afghans at risk, arrived to the EU via humanitarian admission. Member States receive support from the EU budget for resettlement and humanitarian admission.\n\nIrregular border crossings\n\nOverall figures\n\nIrregular EU border crossings by nationality in 2023\n\nSource: Frontex\n\n2023:\n\n385,445 irregular border crossings were registered, representing a 18% increase compared to 2022.\n\nThis figure includes:\n\n270,366 sea crossings, an increase of 64% compared to 2022.\n\n115,079 land border crossings, a decrease of 29% compared to 2022.\n\nGeographical distribution\n\n2022\n\nIncrease in crossings on the Central Mediterranean (+56%, 105,600), the Eastern Mediterranean(+113%, 43,900) and the Western Balkan routes (+134%, 144,100) compared to 2021.\n\nDecrease in crossings on the Western Mediterranean (including the Atlantic route from Western Africa to the Canary Islands) (-25%, 30,600) and the Eastern borders routes (-22%, 6,300) compared to 2021.\n\n18% increase of deaths at sea: 2,411 persons were reported dead or missing in 2022 on the three Mediterranean routes, compared to 2,047 in 2021.\n\n2023\n\nIn 2023 there was an increase in crossings on the Central Mediterranean route (+54%, 162,700), the Atlantic and Western Mediterranean routes (+157%, 39,700 and +12%, 16,900, respectively) and the Eastern Mediterranean route (+57%, 60,800) compared to 2022.\n\nAt the same time, there was a decrease in crossings on the Western Balkan route (-31%, 99,000) and the Eastern borders route (-10%, 5,700) compared to 2022.\n\n29% increase of deaths at sea: 3,105 persons were reported dead or missing in 2023 on the three Mediterranean routes, compared to 2,411 in 2022.\n\nReturns\n\nOverall figures\n\n2023\n\n430,600 non-EU citizens were ordered to leave the EU, a 0.1% decrease compared to 2022.\n\n2022\n\n431,200 non-EU citizens were ordered to leave the EU, a 27% increase compared to 2021.\n\n2021\n\n340,500 non-EU citizens were ordered to leave the EU, a 14% decrease compared to 2020.\n\nThe main countries of nationality of those ordered to leave the EU in 2023 were:\n\nMorocco (8.1%)\n\nAlgeria (7.5%)\n\nAfghanistan (5.5%)\n\nSyria (5.0%)\n\nTürkiye (4.8%)\n\nEffectiveness of the return system\n\nIn 2023, 83,400 non-EU citizens were returned to a non-EU country.
