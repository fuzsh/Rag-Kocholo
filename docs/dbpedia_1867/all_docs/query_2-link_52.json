        "text": "The Tang, Yuan, and Ming dynasties all shared a similar factor when their civilization declined. Heavy taxation resulted in the peasants’ not being able to pay. In the Tang Dynasty, the increase in taxes resulted with the peasants’ uprising. The Ming Dynasty faced a monetary crisis with great deficits. The Yuan Dynasty had to face the difficulty of paying taxes. This was the main and biggest problem between all three dynasties. To have fixed this, I would have advised the Chinese emperor’s to create an organized system of government where money would flow without any disruptions. More jobs would have to be created to help the peasants’ pay off their debt better. Additionally, I think it would have been better if the rich were taxed more than\n\nBoth the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire became massive empires and dominated their region for a long time. In addition, both of these empires also had large impact on the world and extremely influenced the development of human civilization. Even in the modern times, the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire have been the major subjects of historians and scholars especially when dealing with the development of stable societies . Although both of these empires grew in massive size, their political, economic, social and religious developments are extremely different. The objective of this paper is to analyze and compare the Han Dynasty and the Roman Empire in terms of political, economic, social and religious developments. It also opts to evaluate their overall impact to their\n\nIn Rome Christianity was widely adopted, first by the people and then by the state. They believed that a Savior would come who was the Son of God, and he would save them from their sins. Alternatively, the Han Dynasty adopted Confucianism. This was not so much a religion as it was more a set of rules and guidelines for a person’s behavior, thoughts, and actions. They also fed their multiplying populations differently. Rome imported grain from Africa. Whereas, China built huge store houses, and filled them during years when there was plenty of food. Then when years of droughts and poor crops came, there was enough food to feed everyone. The economy was also kept stable during these years because they didn’t need to raise the price of grain, since they had stored away so much during the good years. These two countries differed in how they fed their populations because of their cities arrangements and as a result of their planning. Rome had very large cities with little room because there were so many people, which also meant there was no room to build store houses. Conversely, China built store houses early on and did not live in such close quarters with everyone else.\n\nClassical Chinese Empires and the Roman Empire were both a big political power in their times. Chinese governments had a centralized government, same with the Roman’s. Both empires were very scared of their dynasties spreading out. This happened to the Greek-City State Athens, they were very decentralized and Athens spread out to make new villages. This caused Athens to eventually fall because they couldn’t take the power of the Roman Empire. Both were very successful and they accomplished many great achievements with the many leaders they both had. Innovation similarities were very similar as well because both empires invented and carried\n\nBut, they were incapable of doing this so, they ended up getting murdered so that the eunuch power and influence could remain in the empire (Zhi). But, besides corruption and military issues, there was also the problem of high taxes. In the Roman empire “heavier and heavier taxes were required to support the vast government bureaucracy and huge military establishment” (Ellis and Ester, 151) while the Han empire was “burdened by heavy taxes and crushing debt” (Ellis and Ester, 96). This problem led to the downfall because high taxes increased the chances of rebellion, which actually occurred in the Han empire. The corruption, military issues and taxes were both major aspects which contributed to the downfalls of the empires and they did so, by causing uncertainty in power an unstable support system, and increasing chances of rebellion.\n\nEconomic troubles were a major contribution to the fall of these empires. The economic troubles included taxation which was out of control at the time. In the Roman Empire, the taxes going up led to the poor being charged more and becoming unstable and unable to pay the taxes the government demanded. Which then led to the lower-class people to flee when rumored that the tax man was in the village. In the Han Dynasty also had tax money missing then would go to the lower- class and try to get their money but like in the Roman Empire the lower-class would also flee the countryside when rumored that the tax man was a certain village. This led to these empires to be financially short. Trade was also a contribution to the economic troubles these empires were having at the time. The Roman empire was affected by trade more than\n\nTo begin with, one of the main problems of the Roman Empire was their economic problems and corruption. For example, in an excerpt of a historical text written by Priscus, which was a Roman ambassador to the Huns in 449 C.E, he reported a conversation he had with a former citizen whose land had been conquered by the Huns. In their conversation the former Roman citizen stated, “ The conditions of [Roman] subjects in time of peace [is worse than war]...taxes are very severe, and unprincipled men inflict injuries on others… A [wealthy lawbreaker] … is not punished for his injustice, while a poor man … undergoes the legal penalty… The climax of misery is to have to pay in order to obtain justice…” This supports that one main problem that ended the Roman empire was economic problems and corruption because it shows that if rich people in Rome committed a crime they would only have to bribe their way out of trouble while on the other hand poor people will have to face their consequences which is unfair so when they got invaded by the Huns they decided that it was best if they conquered than to join the military to help their empire. In addition another economic problem is that the the Roman Emperors had to pay their own soldiers to stay loyal which lead to emperors having to mint more coins which is further supported by BrainPop which states, “Roman emperors often bribed their soldiers with money to make sure they remained loyal. And when emperors didn’t have enough to pay their troops, they would mint cheaper coins. This caused the value of Roman money to plummet.” This also supports that one important cause that caused the Roman Empire to decline was the corruption and economic problems because in order for a empire or a civilization to function efficiently, they need to respect all people\n\nIn the Western Roman Empire the cornerstone of their economy was agriculture, taxation of agriculture and the imposed taxes by wars; this is what kept the Roman empire afloat. Both the Eastern and the Western Empire (they were divided into two sides) had acquired such a large amount of land that through these fiscal means they were able to stay a great power for so long. After time the taxes progressively became a very strong burden on the people of the roman republic and it hurt those that were poor the most. With the poor making up most of the population of the Western Roman Empire this led to the weakening of the economic status of the Empire. This taxation not only affected the poor but also the farmers that held up the agricultural framework"
