        "text": "Ethnic Groups\n\nChina is a comprising 56 state-recognized nationalities officially termed “ethnic minorities.” These ethnic minority groups do not necessarily self-identify as such, and are not equally represented in China. The largest ethnic group is the Han (91.6), and the largest non-Han minority groups are Tibetans, Mongols, and Uyghurs. These territories (Tibet, Inner Mongolia, and Xinjiang) are resource-rich and these ethnic groups often dispute the autonomous regions. Numerous human rights violations and independence movements have caused major instability in these regions and international criticism of the Chinese Communist Party’s ethnic minority policies. There are ethnic groups that are still seeking official recognition by the state.\n\nList of China’s Ethnic Minority Groups"
