        "text": "At eighty-five years old, Maya Angelou can still remember her first pair of shoes. “I lived in a little village in Arkansas, about the size of Pier 59,” Angelou says, waving her hand in reference to the studio space on the West Side Highway in New York where we’re both sitting. She smiles before turning serious, then continues: “And my grandmother sent away to Sears Roebuck—for shoes, for everything—because the town was divided between black and white. If a black person went to the white part of town, and went into the store, even if you came in there first, ten minutes later a white person would come in, and the butcher or the baker would serve the white person first. And so in order to avoid embarrassment, my grandmother would buy from a catalogue.”\n\nPier 59, with a video of scantily clad Beyoncé playing on a screen in the room next door, seems worlds away from the rural town of Stamps, Arkansas. Angelou has just finished having her portrait taken for Cole Haan, whose new advertising campaign plans to feature people born in 1928, the same year the company was founded in Chicago. Despite the decades between then and now, Angelou’s memory is sharp: “And if by chance,” she adds, “my feet grew larger than they were last year, then I wore terrible, ill-fitting shoes. Because that’s what I had!”\n\nOf course, Angelou’s story is well known to most. Raised in the segregated South, and coming of age during the civil rights era, Angelou is the author of seven autobiographies, including, most famously, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings. It’s one of the best-selling nonfiction books in publishing history—especially popular in middle-school and high-school classrooms tasked with educating its students about race in America. I first read Angelou when I was in the eighth grade. And like so many American schoolchildren, I found her writing made an indelible mark on my understanding of our nation’s complicated history. Angelou stood apart from Shakespeare and Hemingway; she was elegant, poetic, and subtle—even when dealing with some of the darkest moments of her life.\n\nWhen asked what life was like in 1928, Angelou grins. “I was born then, darling, I don’t remember.” These days, Angelou is more a fan of Cole Haan purses than their shoes. Gayle King apparently likes to give them to her. Which leads us to discussing her friendship with Oprah (who calls Angelou mentor-mother-sister-friend). “I’m grateful to intelligent people,” Angelou says discreetly of their relationship. “That doesn’t mean educated. That doesn’t mean intellectual. I mean really intelligent. What black old people used to call ‘mother wit’ means intelligence that you had in your mother’s womb. That’s what you rely on. You know what’s right to do.”\n\nDressed in a long black sheath, with a white necklace and matching earrings, Angelou is still beautiful, and wonderfully charismatic. She’s also winsome, playful, aware of how to break the ice. She sings a song she originally wrote for Roberta Flack. She admits to watching impersonations of herself. “Like Saturday Night Live, when the person goes”—her voice drops to a lower register—“‘So Doc-tor Ma-ya Angelou would . . . say . . . and . . . they. . . take . . . their . . . time. . . . ’” She laughs. “But in a way,” she continues sincerely, “They aren’t wrong. I work so hard to find the right word to describe what I’m feeling because as human beings we are more alike than we are unalike. If I can say to people your age, and of your cultural generation, what I mean at my age—if I can say it really accurately, you will understand me.”\n\nSpeaking of age, apparently she and Oprah were just discussing the business of turning sixty. “I told her it’s fabulous at sixty. I promise you. You want to be sixty. You want to be smart and clever and intelligent and witty and kind and generous and sure of yourself. You’re better at what you do. More brave. At sixty you are more able to do that than you were at fifty. There are certain things you don’t have to worry about.” Like what? “Well, you don’t have to worry about getting pregnant.” Angelou smiles mischievously. Then she turns serious again. “No, but it’s wonderful. Darling, it’s wonderful.” What about the rest? “Eighty is OK. But eighty-five is a knockout.”"
