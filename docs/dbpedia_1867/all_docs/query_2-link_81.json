        "text": "History\n\nThe city owes its origin to the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway through Manchuria (Northeast China) by the Russians at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Before 1896 it was a small fishing village named Alejin (“Honour”; Harbin is derived from it) by the Juchen, the ancestors of the Manchu. Thereafter it became the construction centre for the railway, which by 1904 linked the Trans-Siberian Railroad from a point east of Lake Baikal in Siberia with the Russian port of Vladivostok on the Sea of Japan (East Sea). Harbin was a base for Russian military operations in Manchuria during the Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), and after the war it was temporarily under joint Chinese-Japanese administration. It became a haven for refugees from Russia after the Revolution of 1917 and for a time had the largest Russian population of any city outside the Soviet Union.\n\nDuring the period of the Japanese-dominated state of Manchukuo (1932–45), Harbin was subordinated to Binjiang (Pinkiang) province. It was the site of a notorious Japanese biological warfare laboratory during World War II. Soviet troops occupied the city in 1945, and a year later Chinese communist forces took it over and from it directed their conquest of Northeast China. Harbin’s population subsequently grew rapidly, and the city became the region’s chief industrial base.\n\nThe contemporary city\n\nThe city layout is centred on the main railway station, which is located somewhat away from the river. The rail lines radiating from it roughly form three districts: Daoli (“Inner Way”; northwest), Daowai (“Outer Way”; southeast), and Nangang (“South Mound”; west). More recently, urban development has spread north of the river. Much of the foreign-developed city has disappeared since 1950, although the city has maintained a Russian air and its nickname “Eastern Moscow.” However, many of the Russian-built or Russian-influenced buildings have been replaced with contemporary ferroconcrete structures; a notable exception is the well-preserved St. Sophia Church in the Daoli district, the largest and most spectacular of several Russian Orthodox churches in the city.\n\nAmong Harbin’s traditional food-processing industries are soybean-processing plants, sugar refineries (for sugar beets), and flour mills. There are also factories producing tobacco products, leather goods, and soap. Industries developed after 1950 include the production of machine tools, mining and metallurgical equipment, agricultural equipment, plastics, and electric power turbines, boilers, and generators. The city is also the outfitting centre for the Daqing oil fields to the northwest. More recently, Harbin has established a high-technology development zone. The surrounding agricultural region supports the cultivation of wheat, soybeans, sugar beets, corn (maize), flax, and kaoliang (a grain sorghum). Harbin is a shipping centre for agricultural and forest products sent to the rest of China. A trade fair held annually in the city has greatly promoted Sino-Russian business relations, as well as trade between China and countries in eastern Europe.\n\nHarbin is the regional centre of land, water, and air transport. A dense network of highways connects Harbin to neighbouring cities, and expressways stretch northwest to the Daqing area and east to the Yaboli winter skiing centre. Major rail lines radiate from the city south to Dalian in Liaoning province, southeast to Vladivostok, and northwest to Chita in southern Siberia. Ships can navigate the Sungari to Khabarovsk, Russia, during the warmer, ice-free months. The Harbin Taiping Airport, southwest of the city, is one of the largest air facilities in the country.\n\nGet a Britannica Premium subscription and gain access to exclusive content.

An annual winter festival features an ice-carving competition and is a popular tourist draw. Harbin also hosts a music festival each summer."
