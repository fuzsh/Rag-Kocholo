He has extensive knowledge and experience in sophisticated economic and statistical analysis in support of expert testimony for litigation matters, development of analytic databases, critique of plaintiff's experts' analysis, rebuttal of opposing experts, preparation of expert reports, deposition testimony, arbitration testimony, and data analysis used in mediations and arbitrations. Chris has testified at trial, deposition, and arbitration, and has submitted expert reports in both state and federal courts.\n\nAt Seyfarth, Chris enjoys working with an industry-leading group of attorneys, analysts, and technologists who use powerful analytical approaches for workforce strategy, compliance, and litigation.
