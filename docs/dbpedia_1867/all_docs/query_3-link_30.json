        "text": "I am a UCCS Alumni, with a Bachelor of Innovation in Inclusive Early Childhood Education. I have several years of experience teaching and supporting students of all ages (from preschool to college) with diverse needs and backgrounds. My goal is to advocate for equity for students with disabilities, providing them a partner in their self-advocacy and positive guidance in using their gifts to discover their passions and achieve their dreams. I believe that all people can learn, grow, and thrive if they know they are safe, loved, and included.\n\nWhile attending UCCS, I loved being a campus tour guide, living on campus, playing intramural sports, attending theatre productions, hiking the Bluffs, and participating in any and every campus event I could find. I am really looking forward to supporting students to become parts of campus communities that bring them joy and challenge them to grow. I know that the right campus involvement can greatly enhance oneâ€™s college experience, so I promise to support our students to do this in a way that meshes with each of their unique interests, personsonalities, and goals."
