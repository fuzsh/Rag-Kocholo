Nevertheless, during aging blood cell production is impaired, resulting in either a deficit of blood cells (leading to anemia, thromocytopenia, or susceptibility to infections) or an excess of blood cells (myeloproliferative diseases or leukemias).\n\nThe identification of the molecular machinery that is associated with aberrant selfrenewal of aged HSCs should allow the development of interventions that improve or restore selfrenewal of normal aged stem cells, and that target exessive selfrenewal of leukemic stem cells."
