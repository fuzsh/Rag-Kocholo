        "text": "Abstract\n\nPIP: China is the nation which has the earliest record of its population. During its history of 4000 years, China's population remained between 10 million and 20 million for the 1st 2000 years. In the Han dynasty, the figure increased to 59 million. At the beginning of 17th century, the population decreased to between 10 million and 20 million because of war and social disorders. In the middle of the 18th century, the total population figure reached 100 million for the 1st time. At the end of the 18th century, it reached 300 million, and at the beginning of 20th century, it increased to 400 million. By 1980, the total population figure had increased to 1 billion. Before the Han dynasty, the Chinese population was mainly distributed in North China along the Yellow River. After the Period of Three Kingdoms (420-589 A.D.), more Chinese moved to South China along the Yangtze River. During the Five Dynasties (907-960 A.D.), the population ratio between the South and the North changed to 3 to 1, and this ratio has been maintained since then. A great majority of the Chinese population is engaged in agriculture and lives in the countryside. China is a nation with many ethnic groups. Of the total population, 94% are Han people, and 6% are minorities which belong to 55 ethnic groups. There are also 5 language families in China, with the Han language being the most popular. About 96.31% of the Chinese population is distributed in the eastern half of the country, and only 3.69% are distributed in the southwest, northwest, and northern frontiers. The highest population density is concentrated in the lower Yellow River and Yangtze River areas."
