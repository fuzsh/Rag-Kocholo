To make it easier and also reduce the use of plastic in your personal care routines, Refills are key to our philosophy.\n\nWith them, you’ll be able to use your products over and over again, saving not only up to 89% of plastic but also money. Refilling is a new approach to create a lasting change for the planet.\n\nTo ensure that all our products contain natural and clean ingredients, we work with local laboratories. When a formula is clean, it means it doesn’t use any chemical or synthetic ingredient that could pose a risk to human health or to the environment.\n\nOur cosmetics are not tested on animals nor include any animal ingredient on it, which means we’re also vegan."
