        "text": "Ralph L. Haan Jr., age 82, of Jenison, was translated to glory on Tuesday, March 17, 2020. He was preceded in death by his parents, Ralph L. and Jessie Haan; sister, Marilyn Rotman; brother, Russell Haan; and brother-in-law, Carl Hulst. He will be lovingly remembered by his wife of 62 years, Carol (Bouma); children, Stephen and Carol Haan, Joy and James Noe’, Ellen and Tim VanderPloeg, Laurie Haan; grandchildren, Ethan and Cassidy Haan, Elliott Haan, Ben and Stephanie Noe’, Sarah Noe’, Joshua Noe’, Nick, Katie, Jacob, and Lucas VanderPloeg; three great-granddaughters, Esther, Keira, and Ivy Noe’; siblings, Warren and Virginia Haan, Jan and Fred Billin, Cheryl and Donley DeGroot, Marcia and Fred Hulst; sister-in-law, Betty Haan; brother-in-law, Nelson and Kay Rotman; several loving nieces, nephews, and cousins. Due to the current environment of our world and country, private family services are being held. A celebration of life service is tentatively planned for Saturday, May 23, 2020. Details will be published at a later date. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorial contributions be given to Baldwin Street CRC Mission Fund or to Brookcrest Nursing Home."
