        "text": "THE RESTAURANT\n\nLocated in the heart of Harlem, Red Rooster Harlem serves comfort food that celebrates the roots of American cuisine and the neighborhood’s diverse culinary traditions. We seek to share the story of Harlem with our guests and offer a space that celebrates local artists, musicians and culinary talents alike. We embrace today’s Harlem with a spirit of inclusiveness and community by hiring our family of staff from within the community, inspiring better eating through neighborhood cooking classes and buying from local purveyors.\n\nNamed in honor of the legendary Harlem speakeasy that attracted neighborhood folk, jazz greats, and noteworthy figures of the 20th century; from Adam Clayton Powell Jr. to Nat King Cole and James Baldwin. We’re privileged to share our namesake with the original Red Rooster.\n\nCo-Creators Andrew Chapman and Marcus Samuelsson have long wanted to open a restaurant that would have a positive impact on the neighborhood’s culinary landscape and its community at-large.\n\nTHE NEIGHBORHOOD\n\nHarlem, located in the northern part of Manhattan in New York City, is a historically significant and culturally vibrant neighborhood known for its rich African American heritage, jazz and artistic renaissance during the early 20th century, and diverse culinary scene. It has been a hub of creativity, social change, and cultural expression, with iconic landmarks like the Apollo Theater and institutions like the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture. Harlem's streets are alive with a blend of historic brownstones, lively street vendors and a thriving arts scene, making it a dynamic and enduring symbol of African American culture and urban life in America.\n\nHarlem's food history can be traced back to the late 19th century when the neighborhood began to attract a diverse population, including African Americans migrating from the South, European immigrants, and Caribbean immigrants. Each group brought their own culinary traditions, contributing to the neighborhood's culinary diversity. In the early 20th century, Harlem was the epicenter of the Harlem Renaissance, a cultural and artistic movement that celebrated African American culture. This era saw the emergence of notable restaurants, clubs, and speakeasies, such as the Cotton Club and the Savoy Ballroom, where jazz music and innovative cuisine thrived. African American chefs and restaurateurs gained recognition for their culinary skills during this time. Harlem has also been a significant incubator for soul food, a cuisine that draws heavily from African, African American, and Southern culinary traditions. Dishes like fried chicken, collard greens, cornbread, and macaroni & cheese became staples of Harlem's food scene. The Caribbean community in Harlem has also had a profound impact on the neighborhood's food culture, various restaurants and eateries offer a variety of dishes like jerk chicken, roti, and rice and peas.\n\nHarlem's food history is a testament to the resilience and creativity of its diverse communities. It continues to evolve, blending tradition with innovation and celebrating the cultural richness that defines this iconic neighborhood in NYC.\n\nMARCUS SAMUELSSON is the renowned chef behind many restaurants worldwide, including Red Rooster in Harlem (NYC) and Overtown (Miami); Hav & Mar in Chelsea (NYC); several MARCUS locations, including Montreal, the Bahamas, Newark, and Atlanta; and his newest concept, Metropolis at the Perelman Performing Arts Center (World Trade Center, NYC), opening October 2023. Samuelsson was the youngest person to ever receive a three-star review from The New York Times and has won eight James Beard Foundation Awards. He is a longstanding judge on the hit Food Network show Chopped, head judge of Top Chef Family Style, and Iron Chef on Netflix’s rebooted Iron Chef: Quest for an Iron Legend. Samuelsson is the author of multiple books, including The New York Times bestselling memoir Yes, Chef and The Rise: Black Cooks and the Soul of American Food.\n\nFollow him on Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter at @MarcusCooks.\n\nTHERESE GRANLUND\n\nGENERAL MANAGER\n\nTherese started her restaurant career at Aquavit, a modern Scandinavian restaurant in the late 90s. She left in 2001 and worked at Union Pacific with celebrity chef, Rocco DiSpirito. After three years, Therese returned to Aquavit when the esteemed restaurant moved to its new location on 55th street.\n\nAlongside Marcus Samuelsson, she opened Merkato 55, in the Meatpacking District in 2008. Along with the illustrious Red Rooster Harlem & Ginny’s Supperclub in 2010.\n\nIn 2014, Therese branched out and collaborated with Chef Einat Admony, a pioneer chef of modern Israeli cuisine. Together the two opened Bar Bolonat in the West Village. This restauranteur became the Director of Operations for Chef Einat’s restaurants: Balaboosta, Combina, and Kish Kash.\n\nPresently, Therese found her way back to Red Rooster Harlem and Ginny’s Supper Club. Guiding and directing the most vibrant and energetic restaurant in New York.\n\nGERMAN URIBE CRUZ\n\nHEAD BARTENDER\n\nGerman is first and foremost a decorated retired Marine SGT. Combat communications specialist was his forte. During his tenure with the marines, traveling the world and learning different cultures, German became a foodie and cocktail enthusiast. With 16 years of restaurant experience and an International business management degree, German is the perfect connoisseur for leading the bar team at Red Rooster Harlem.
