        "text": "Geographical maps show us where the world's landmasses are; not where people are. That means they don't always give us an accurate picture of how global living standards are changing.\n\nOne way to understand the distribution of people worldwide is to redraw the world map – not based on the area but according to population.\n\nThis is shown here as a population cartogram: a geographical presentation of the world where the size of countries is not drawn according to the distribution of land but by the distribution of people. It’s shown for the year 2018.\n\nAs the population size rather than the territory is shown in this map, you can see some significant differences when you compare it to the standard geographical map we’re most familiar with.\n\nSmall countries with a high population density increase in size in this cartogram relative to the world maps we are used to – look at Bangladesh, Taiwan, or the Netherlands. Large countries with a small population shrink in size – look for Canada, Mongolia, Australia, or Russia.\n\nYou can find more details on this cartogram in our article about it:\n\nThe map we need if we want to think about how global living conditions are changing\n\nBy showing us where the people in the world are, cartograms help us understand global living conditions better.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nThis map is based on the United Nation’s 2017 World Population Prospects report. Our interactive charts show population data from the most recent UN revision. This means there may be minor differences between the figures shown on the map and the latest estimates in our other charts.\n\nThe speed of global population growth over the last few centuries has been staggering. For most of human history, the world population was well under one million.1\n\nAs recently as 12,000 years ago, there were only 4 million people worldwide.\n\nThe chart shows the rapid increase in the global population since 1700.\n\nThe one-billion mark wasn’t broken until the early 1800s. It was only a century ago that there were 2 billion people.\n\nSince then, the global population has quadrupled to eight billion.\n\nAround 108 billion people have ever lived on our planet. This means that today’s population size makes up 6.5% of the total number of people ever born.2\n\nThis increase has been the result of advances in living conditions and health that reduced death rates – especially in children – and increases in life expectancy.\n\nPopulation\n\nSee the data in our interactive visualization\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nThis data comes from a combination of sources, all detailed in our sources article for our long-term population dataset.\n\nThere’s a popular misconception that the global population is growing exponentially. But it’s not.\n\nWhile the global population is still increasing in absolute numbers, population growth peaked decades ago.\n\nIn the chart, we see the global population growth rate per year. This is based on historical UN estimates and its medium projection to 2100.\n\nGlobal population growth peaked in the 1960s at over 2% per year. Since then, rates have more than halved, falling to less than 1%.\n\nThe UN expects rates to continue to fall until the end of the century. In fact, towards the end of the century, it projects negative growth, meaning the global population will shrink instead of grow.\n\nGlobal population growth, in absolute terms – which is the number of births minus the number of deaths – has also peaked. You can see this in our interactive chart:\n\nAnnual population growth\n\nSee the data in our interactive visualization\n\nHans Rosling famously coined the term \"peak child\" for the moment in global demographic history when the number of children stopped increasing.\n\nAccording to the UN data, the world has passed \"peak child\", which is defined as the number of children under the age of five.\n\nThe chart shows the UN’s historical estimates and projections of the number of children under five.\n\nIt estimates that the number of children in the world peaked in 2017. For the coming decades, demographers expect a decades-long plateau before the number will decline more rapidly in the second half of the century.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nThese projections are sensitive to the assumptions made about future fertility rates worldwide. Find out more from the UN World Population Division.\n\nOther sources and scenarios in the UN’s projections suggest that the peak was reached slightly earlier or later. However, most indicate that the world is close to \"peak child\" and the number of children will not increase in the coming decades.\n\nThe 'ups and downs' in this chart reflect generational effects and 'baby booms' when there are large cohorts of women of reproductive age, and high fertility rates. The timing of these transitions varies across the world.\n\nWhen will population growth come to an end?\n\nThe UN’s historical estimates and latest projections for the global population are shown in the chart.\n\nThe UN projects that the global population will peak before the end of the century – in 2086, at just over 10.4 billion people.\n\nWhat you should know about this data\n\nThese projections are sensitive to the assumptions made about future fertility and mortality rates worldwide. Find out more from the UN World Population Division.\n\nOther sources and scenarios in the UN’s projections can produce a slightly earlier or later peak. Most demographers, however, expect that by the end of the century, the global population will have peaked or slowed so much that population growth will be small."
