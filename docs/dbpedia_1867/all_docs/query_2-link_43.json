One of the largest scientific collaborations in the world, the GBD measures what prevents us from achieving that goal, putting knowledge and tools into the hands of people and groups around the world to make people healthier.\n\nBy identifying the biggest health problems, it is helping governments, scientists, and partners advocate for resources and answer questions such as:\n\nWhat diseases, injuries, and risk factors cause the most early death and disability in a given country?\n\nHow does health performance differ across countries?\n\nWhen designing an intervention to improve the health of young women, which health problems should be targeted to make the greatest impact?\n\nLEARN MORE ABOUT GBD\n\nGet involved\n\nCollaboration across the scientific community is one of our core principles. From data analysis to policy use, the GBD Collaborator Network is instrumental to the GBD study and affiliated research projects.\n\nJOIN THE NETWORK"
