        "text": "During the sixth day of testimony in Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu’s Case 1000 trial on Sunday, businessman Arnon Milchan stated that Netanyahu never complained if he visited without bringing gifts. Milchan emphasized that when he did give presents to the Netanyahus, it was out of friendship rather than obligation. The testimony, broadcast from a U.K. courthouse to the Yerushalayim District Court, aimed to challenge the accusation that the gifts were a result of a breach of trust in exchange for personal and business assistance.\n\nMilchan dismissed the significance of the champagne, cigars and shirts he had given Netanyahu, considering them financially negligible. He also stated that he never kept the cost of the gifts in mind. Furthermore, Milchan affirmed that he had never concealed the gifts or his relationship with the Netanyahu family.\n\nThe prosecution alleges that Netanyahu provided assistance to Milchan in obtaining a U.S. visa and promoting a tax exemption law extension that would have benefited the businessman.\n\nMilchan had previously cited illness as the reason for being unable to travel to Israel for his testimony and was permitted by the court to testify from Brighton. Notably, during Sunday’s testimony, his coughing fits were more pronounced compared to the previous week of hearings."
