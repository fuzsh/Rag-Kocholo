        "text": "At any given point in the film, which follows Dr. Walker as he fumbles his way, as one-half blind, through a befuddling urban environment of New Wave (as in pop, not Godard) discotheques, cramped garrets, parking garages, and houseboats that serve as rehearsal spaces for funk quartets, the answer to this question would be a resounding “No.” Paris, as Polanski presents it, has largely been shorn of the hallmarks of Parisian-ness that might render it familiar from films and mass-market reproductions of impressionist canvases. The diegetic pop on the soundtrack—which includes Jamaican-born Grace Jones’s reggae-and-tango-infused “I’ve Seen That Face Before (Libertango)” as a leitmotif—has a distinctly Caribbean bent, and, outside of some snatches of Cole Porter’s “I Love Paris” sung by the couple, nary a chanson standard is heard in the film, with a bit of accordion in Ennio Morricone’s theme the most distinctly “Gallic” element of the score. (Frantic, incidentally, credits Tunis-born impresario and DJ Claude Challe as its “Nightlife Advisor.”)\n\nWe do get a few glimpses of the Eiffel Tower, visible from the Walkers’ hotel in the 9th arrondissement, but the movie, rather perversely, makes far more extensive use of a monument associated with a different metropolis on the other side of the Atlantic, the Statue of Liberty: the contraband krytron is hidden in a chintzy miniature Lady Liberty, and Frantic’s climax takes place on the Île aux Cygnes in the Seine, home, since 1889, of a quarter-scale version of the verdigris-coated giantess by sculptor Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi’s that overlooks New York Harbor. “I wanted to get rid of everything that was too obviously Parisian and tried to show the city of today,” Polanski, a Paris resident of 11 years when he made Frantic, would say of the film, and one cannot claim that he held back in stripping the city of its glamor; the Arc de Triomphe and Tuileries appear in Frantic not at all, while the Pizza Hut next to the Le Grand Hotel is practically a supporting character. The city the film shows is cold, vaguely malevolent, and very sleazy, and if you love Paris—not the package-tour version of it, but the gray, ill-smelling, oft-overcast city itself—you will recognize it immediately.\n\nDr. Walker’s vulnerability to faux pas after faux pas in clumsily coping with his unfamiliar surroundings persists throughout Polanski’s film, a thriller that at times verges on slapstick comedy. For example: when a dealer sidles up to Walker at a sleazy boîte de nuit asking if the doctor is looking for “the white lady,” our hapless hero takes the euphemism for cocaine to be a reference to his wife, winds up awkwardly doing a bump in the bathroom stall out of politesse, loses half of the proffered blow on his shirt and then, drying off his nose after flushing out his nostrils in the sink, trails half a roll of toilet paper behind him on his way out of the W.C.\n\nYou would be hard-pressed to find a more accident-prone lead in the annals of ’80s action cinema than Walker. He catches his necktie in the clasp of the contraband suitcase, almost leaves a crucial piece of evidence—that matchbook—behind in a cab, and can’t seem to remember when and if he has his hotel keys on his person. Waking on a hideaway houseboat after getting roundhouse kicked into unconsciousness by a Mossad agent, he proceeds to subject himself to further cranial trauma by bashing his skull on the vessel’s low ceilings and doorways—not once but twice. Moving to shake a woman’s hand later, in another disco, he’ll nearly upset a bucket of champagne onto her dress, and when Michelle drags Dr. Walker onto the club’s floor shortly thereafter, sensuously undulating against him in her skintight red dress, the flustered Walker quite evidently doesn’t know what to do with his sorely tempted hands—as with Hugh Grant’s mortifying frugging in Bitter Moon (1992), Polanski gets ample comic mileage out of the average buttoned-down Anglo-Saxon heterosexual male’s terror of dance. Twenty years married and to all evidence happily so—Polanski, in a 1988 interview, rather uncharitably stated that Walker “loves his wife, even if she is two years his senior and not particularly attractive”—the chaste, upright Walker runs a gauntlet of mild sexual mortifications that include being temporarily trapped in a dead man’s apartment by a couple enjoying an interlude of cunnilingus in the downstairs lobby, and a series of encounters with cops and colleagues who quite naturally conclude that the scrumptious gamine at his side is a Paris fling. The language barrier provides Dr. Walker with still another hurdle to trip over, his linguistic skills not going much further than an occasional, abashedly muttered, “Je parlais non français.” (Ford will be similarly overwrought playing another surgeon with unusual marital difficulties in Andrew Davis’s 1993 The Fugitive, but his “Dr. Richard Kimble” in that film is nowhere near as much of a stumblebum as Dr. Walker.)\n\nOne needs not have been caught up in cloak-and-dagger intrigues while overseas to understand something of Walker’s plight; to the North American newly arrived or freshly returned to Europe, the Old Country of narrow, coiled stairwells, phone booth-sized hotel elevators, and cramped Peugeots tends to feel pinched, constrictive, at once familiar and disconcertingly out-of-scale, a hazardous terrain offering an infinity of opportunities for the blundering, jet-lagged visitor to do damage to themselves: cobblestone streets ready to twist an ankle, tight passages lying in wait to catch a cavalierly swinging Yankee elbow.\n\nFrantic’s vivid, immersive depiction of the foreigner’s experience in an alien and unwelcoming environment has multiple precedents in Polanski’s work: Catherine Deneuve’s isolated Belgian émigré immured in a London flat in Repulsion (1965), for example, or the part played by Polanski himself in his Paris-set The Tenant (1976), that of the meek, nebbishy “Trelkovsky,” whose suspiciously un-French surname seems to earn him the suspicion and enmity of most everyone he meets. (Adding to the disconcertment, the film’s Paris is largely populated by aging American actors, including Melvyn Douglas, Jo Van Fleet, and Shelley Winters.)\n\nOne may extrapolate that this abiding interest in narratives of ambient hostility has something to do with the fact that Polanski is a Paris-born Polish Jew and Holocaust survivor, a member of a people often regarded as rootless cosmopolitans and consequently treated as “belonging” nowhere; in any case, Frantic is one of a few films that makes some sense of Ford’s statement about his own mixed ethnic ancestry: “As a man I’ve always felt Irish, as an actor I’ve always felt Jewish.” (After filming Frantic, Polanski would take the Paris stage to play Gregor Samsa in a theater adaptation of a celebrated work by another Mitteleuropean Jewish artist renowned for his ability to evoke smothering paranoia, Franz Kafka’s Metamorphosis.)\n\nWalker, an everyman dropped into a suspense-thriller plot by circumstance rather than inclination, is scarcely equipped to play the part of international secret agent, but he does bring a surgeon’s methodical scrupulousness to the high-pressure scenario he’s thrust into—qualities the character shares with the infamously detail-obsessive Polanski, who achieves the illusion of realism in Frantic via an enormous amount of precisely considered artifice. The film’s interiors were either manipulated to achieve specific effects—Polanski recounts having production designer Pierre Guffroy, with whom he’d worked since The Tenant, and his team paint the walls of Le Grand in a uniform, subdued gray—or recreated entirely to the production’s needs, as in the case of the Blue Parrot nightclub, a studio-built facsimile of Les Bains Douches, a legendary spot located in a former thermal bath in the 3rd from 1978 to 2010 and, at the time of Frantic’s shoot, co-owned by Challe.\n\nFrantic is a film where seemingly no particular detail has been left to chance: the repeated inclusion of low ceilings in cinematographer Witold Sobociński’s framings, cumulatively lending the film a sense of smothering enclosure; the exquisitely filigreed sound mix by Jean-Pierre Ruh, preeminent sonic genius of French cinema from the 1970s on; even the throwaway gag shot of two pigeon’s copulating, which anticipates the breathtaking “kicker” of Polanski’s late-style stunner The Palace (2023). In this environment, Ford has free rein to explore his too-often neglected capacity for performances of fine, finicky minutiae and mounting, sweaty apprehension; in the vise-grip of Polanski’s iron maiden filmmaking, Ford is liberated from the prerogatives of his Hollywood persona, playing an all-American Gregor Samsa who wakes up bleary-eyed one day from a nap to find his world irrevocably altered, thence to scuttle furtively through the grimy gutters of Paris.\n\nNick Pinkerton is a Cincinnati-born, Brooklyn-based writer focused on moving image-based art; his writing has appeared in Film Comment, Sight & Sound, Artforum, Frieze, Reverse Shot, The Guardian, 4Columns, The Baffler, Rhizome, Harper’s, and the Village Voice. He is the editor of Bombast magazine, editor-at-large of Metrograph Journal, and maintains a Substack, Employee Picks. Publications include monographs on Mondo movies (True/False) and the films of Ruth Beckermann (Austrian Film Museum), a book on Tsai Ming-liang’s Goodbye, Dragon Inn (Fireflies Press), and a forthcoming critical biography of Jean Eustache (The Film Desk). The Sweet East, a film from his original screenplay directed by Sean Price Williams, premiered in the Quinzaine des Cinéastes section of the 2023 Cannes Film Festival, is currently in wide release across US cinemas."
