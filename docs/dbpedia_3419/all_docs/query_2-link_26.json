        "text": "A Hollywood producer behind hit films such as Pretty Woman and Fight Club has said he spied for Israel in support of its nuclear programme.\n\nArnon Milchan, who was born in what is now Israel, gave an account to Israeli investigative programme Uvda.\n\nMr Milchan said he performed dozens of clandestine missions on behalf of Israel after he was recruited by Shimon Peres, now Israel's president.\n\n\"I did it for my country and I'm proud of it,\" he said.\n\nMr Milchan, 68, said he was recruited to Israel's Bureau of Scientific Relations, a secretive organisation founded to supply the nation's nuclear programme, in the 1960s by Mr Peres.\n\nThen the owner of a successful fertiliser company, Mr Milchan said he aided the bureau in obtaining scientific and technical information for confidential defence programmes.\n\nAt one point, Uvda alleges, Mr Milchan was operating 30 companies in 17 countries on behalf of Israel.\n\nHis activities continued after he became a high-profile Hollywood producer, rising to chairman of film company New Regency.\n\nHe produced such hits as Mr and Mrs Smith and LA Confidential, and worked with famed directors including Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski and Oliver Stone.\n\nDuring the interview, which aired on Monday, Mr Milchan also said Academy Award-winning director Sydney Pollack helped in covert acquisitions of sensitive military equipment.\n\nPollack died in 2008.\n\nMr Milchan told Uvda that rumours of his own involvement with Israel had swirled around Hollywood for years and he wished he had addressed them head on.\n\n\"In Hollywood, they don't like working with an arms dealer, ideologically... with someone who lives off selling machine guns and killing,\" he said. \"Instead of someone talking to me about a script, I had to spend half an hour explaining that I'm not an arms dealer.\n\n\"I'm not an arms dealer, I don't sell guns, I don't sell rockets,\" he added. \"If people knew how many times I risked my life, back and forth, again and again, for my country.\""
