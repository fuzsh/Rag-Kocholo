        "text": "What’s it like to work for a demanding entertainment executive? Film and television production company New Regency’s Arnon Milchan provides a telling example of his management style in an email sent recently to his entire staff.\n\nIn a late-night screed written in December–and cc’ed to top Fox brass including president and COO Chase Carey and entertainment co-chairmen Jim Gianopulos and Tom Rothman–Milchan exhorted his staff to justify their value to him and his company.\n\nPHOTOS: Hollywood’s Biggest Blunders\n\n“I’d like to know … the 3-5 best connections you have in the movie industry, that can move the needle and create added value beyond what Fox does,” he wrote in the memo, adding, “I’d like to be assured that if I don’t sleep, you don’t sleep.” Milchan noted that he was writing the email at 2 a.m., part of his “regular working hours.” And he warned that the email was “not pep talk–this is serious.”\n\nIn September, Milchan dismissed New Regency co-chairmen Bob Harper and Hutch Parker and installed former Paramount president of production Brad Weston in the top job. But Milchan did not give Weston the title of chairman, having decided to perform that function himself.\n\nSTORY: New Regency Closes Deal for $500 Million in New Financing\n\nMilchan expressed anxiety about a looming global financial crisis and said he did not want to see the “great company” that he’s built “evaporate.”\n\nHere’s the full email:\n\nFrom: Arnon Milchan\n\nSubject: New Regency"
