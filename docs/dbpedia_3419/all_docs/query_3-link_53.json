I then studied dance, acting for the stage and singing, appeared in some big musicals, on TV and in Italian Cinema. While living in the UK I worked at 'Handmade Films' the incredible production company run by Beatle George Harrison and developed a screenplay together with his partner Denis O'Brian.\n\nLeaving Europe, I ran a theater company in New Zealand and worked at TV ONE as screenwriter and actress.

Having now lived in Santa Fe, NM for many years, George RR Martin's Cinema gave 'Rent a Gent' a world premiere, red carpet treatment.
