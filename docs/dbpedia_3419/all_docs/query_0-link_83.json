        "text": "Two Israeli news channels reveal that PM’s wife allegedly lost her temper with investigators, claimed ‘gifts were given as friends,’ said she also gave gifts to Arnon Milchan; police say value of gifts given and taken cannot be compared.\n\nMore details were reported by Israeli media on Thursday night about the investigation questioning of Sara Netanyahu over alleged bribes taken by her and her husband, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook and Twitter\n\n“We received gifts from Milchan as friends,” she allegedly said in response to questions put to her about the cigars, champagne and other gifts that her husband is said to have received from the business magnate Arnon Milchan. Police suspect that for a period of seven or eight years, Milchan gave the prime minister cigars worth hundreds of thousands of shekels. There is also suspicion that during the same period, Milchan gave Mrs. Netanyahu exclusive bottles of Dom Perignon champagne. According to Channel 10 during searches that were conducted at Milchan’s offices in Ramat Gan, receipts were found recording the acquisition of cigars, bottles of champagne and other gifts amounting to more than NIS 400,000. On Wednesday, Mrs. Netanyahu secretly arrived at the Israel Police's Anti-Fraud Unit Lahav 433 in Lod where she answered a series of questions for three hours. Throughout, Mrs. Netanyahu attempted to convince her investigators that the entire episode had been blown out of proportion, according to the reports. Channel 2 News said that Mrs. Netanyahu lost her temper and even raised her voice at those questioning her. She did not, apparently, deny the majority of the claims regarding drinks she had received from Milchan. However she did say that the gifts which were accepted as friends and that her family had also given gifts to Milchan. For example, Channel 10 also reported that Mrs. Netanyahu told the investigators about a necklace that the Netanyahu family had given to Milchan’s wife. Channel 2 added that officials with knowledge of the investigation had claimed that the value of the gifts received by the Netanyahu family could not be compared to the value of those they had given. According to Channel 10, Sara Netanyahu told investigators that she was not aware of the matter of cigars related only to the prime minister, but all matters relating to the champagne bottles and jewelry that she received had been grossly overestimated. When the investigators presented her with receipts, she reportedly responded by saying that they seemed to be exaggerated.\n\nThe next stage of the investigation is expected to include the testimony of the the Netanyahu’s son, Yair Netanyahu, the Channel 10 report continued on Thursday night. Investigators had already made efforts in recent days to determine a date on which he is able to provide evidence.\n\nAlso on Thursday evening, Channel 2 exposed alleged details of an alcohol tab acquired by Arnon Milchan in the beverage store Hinnawi in Herzliya. According to the report, the police requested access to the tabs in order examine the quantity of champagne bought by Milchan and possibly given to the Netanyahu family. Police are currently looking into whether the purchases were indeed made for the prime minister and his wife and used to obtain favors. The tab shows that between 2010-2012, Milchan purchased alcohol in the shop in the amount of NIS 57,480. According to the workers of the shop, he bought bottles of exclusive Dom Perignon champagne which sells in the store for NIS 890 per bottle. Between March 26 and April 20, 2010, Milchan made five purchases in the store at the total cost of NIS 22,712. After this period, the purchases came to a halt for half a year after which they began once again. Every month, Milchan ensured that money was given to the shop to pay the tab. For instance, in June 2012 he transferred NIS 11,773 and in August of the same year he paid NIS 3,747."
