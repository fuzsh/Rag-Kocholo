        "text": "New biography outs Israeli producer Arnon Milchan as man who purchased components for Israel's nuclear arsenal\n\nCould one of Hollywood's greatest Israeli producers have been a Mossad agent? In a new biography called Confidential: The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan,‚Äù authors Meir Doron and Joseph Gelman claim that the producer took part in secret Mossad operations.\n\nAccording to the book, Milchan supervised accounts and financed \"the essential needs of Israel intelligence operations outside the country.\" Those \"essential needs\" include purchasing components for Israel's nuclear arsenal.\n\nReceive Ynetnews updates directly to your desktop\n\nGelman recalls a phone call with Milchan during which Gelman asked the producer: \"Should I be worried?\" The New York Times had written that Gelman told Melchan that there were fears that appearance-wise, people would think Melchan received major perks from Israel for his cooperation. Gelman claims that Melchan's response was: \"I did it for my country, the money didn't go into my pockets\". Melchan, 66, is considered one of Hollywood's greatest producers. His cinematic productions include Israeli movie \"Dizengoff 99\", \"Pretty Woman\" and \"The Devil's Advocate\" and his fortune is worth an estimated $4 billion.\n\nFollow Ynetnews on Facebook"
