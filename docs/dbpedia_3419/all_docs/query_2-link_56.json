        "text": "But for much of his life, Milchan has had a second clandestine career as an arms dealer assisting Israel's intelligence services, Yossi Melman reports today in the Israeli daily Haaretz: Milchan was a longtime weapons dealer and Israeli intelligence agent who purchased equipment for the alleged Israeli nuclear program, a new biography --[\"Confidential: The Life of Secret Agent Turned Hollywood Tycoon Arnon Milchan\"] -- claims. [...]\n\nThese claims have been made before, but this is the first time they've been confirmed. Apparently Milchan was recruited in the 1960s to setup secret bank accounts to fund the Dimona nuclear plant.\n\nHe was almost busted in th 1980s sending nuclear triggers from a California firm to Israel for use in their missiles, but after a two year investigation -- the Reagan administration dropped the charges."
