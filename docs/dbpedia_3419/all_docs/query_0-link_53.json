        "text": "The Hollywood producer behind Pretty Woman and LA Confidential has opened up about his double life as an Israeli spy.\n\nArnon Milchan, who also made Fight Club and Runner Runner, claimed that he bought arms on behalf of Israel as well as technology that has been used to boost its nuclear programme.\n\nHe made the claims during an interview with investigative Israeli TV show, Uvda, aired on Channel 2 on Monday night.\n\nThe 68-year-old said: \"I did it for my country and I'm proud of it.\n\n\"Do you know what it's like to be a 20-something-year-old kid [and] his country lets him be James Bond? That was exciting.\n\n“If people knew how many times I risked my life, back and forth, again and again, for my country…\n\n\"When I came to Hollywood I detached myself completely from my physical activities to dedicate myself to what I really wanted – filmmaking. [But] sometimes it gets mixed up.\"\n\nHis claim was backed by close friend and Oscar-winning actor Robert De Niro.\n\nMr De Niro, who featured on the documentary, said: \"I did ask him once and he told me that he was an Israeli and of course he would do these things for his country.\"\n\nRehovot-born Mr Milchan founded the New Regency film company, which has produced over 160 films since the 1970s. He has worked closely with Martin Scorsese, Roman Polanski, Oliver Stone, Russell Crowe and Ben Affleck, among others.\n\nAccording to an unauthorized biography, Mr Milchan worked for Israel's former Bureau of Scientific Relations, disbanded in 1987, which sourced information for defence. He was reportedly recruited by Shimon Peres in the 1960s.\n\nxnk9Yj9WOrrRtccZwmO8jvLsRNXcoDK8Y8VYz-SMFSo=.html"
