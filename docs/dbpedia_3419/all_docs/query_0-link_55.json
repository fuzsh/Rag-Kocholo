        "text": "Regency Enterprises (commonly referred to as Regency onscreen and credited as Monarchy Enterprises S.á.r.l.) is an American entertainment company formed by Arnon Milchan. It was founded in 1991 as the successor to Regency International Pictures formerly known as Embassy International Pictures N.V..\n\nOrigins (1982–91)[]\n\nArnon Milchan founded his company as Embassy International Pictures N.V. which held the name for 7 years until the named changed to Regency International Pictures. This company originally had no distribution deal producing films with various studios such as The Ladd Company, TriStar Pictures, Warner Bros., Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox. This company produced films such as Once Upon a Time in America and Q&A. This company was shut down in 1991.\n\nRegency Enterprises and New Regency Branding (1991–present)[]\n\nArnon Milchan rebranded Regency International Pictures and renamed it to Regency Enterprises. In addition to signing a distribution deal with Warner Bros., a subsidiary company New Regency Productions was also created. Formerly with offices on the Warner Bros. lot, New Regency is currently located on the 20th Century Fox lot. New Regency primarily produces movies, and has at least 100 movies to its credit. New Regency produced 2013's 12 Years a Slave, 2014's Birdman, and 2015's The Revenant, which earned the company two Academy Awards for Best Picture in a row, and three nominations.\n\nFounder Arnon Milchan's daughter Alexandra Milchan headed their offshoot \"Regency Vision,\" originally intended as a competitor to companies like New Line Cinema's Fine Line Features, a \"specialty features\" division.\n\nIn 1999, New Regency executive David Matalon joined the supervisory board of Puma AG, an international sports company. At the time, Regency was the largest single shareholder in Puma, with more than a 25% stake. Arnon Milchan also owned Puma stock, which he later sold for $676 million in May 2003.\n\nIn September 1997, Milchan signed a 15-year distribution pact with 20th Century Fox worldwide in all media outside of foreign TV rights, ending a previous association with Warner Bros. (1991–1999) Fox's parent company News Corporation (now 21st Century Fox) funneled $200 million in New Regency, in exchange for a 20 percent stake in the company. In 2011, Fox and New Regency extended the pact, to expire in 2022.\n\nRegency Television[]\n\nRegency Television is a joint venture between Regency Enterprises and Fox Television Studios founded in 1998. Regency's best-known television shows include The WB sci-fi drama Roswell, and the Fox sitcoms Malcolm in the Middle and The Bernie Mac Show.\n\nOn July 17, 2008, Regency Television shut down all production and closed its business after nearly ten years in operation. On January 17, 2011, New Regency announced a return to the television business after 20th Century Fox extended its distribution business with Regency until 2022.\n\nInvestments[]\n\nNew Regency Productions (80%) (a joint venture between Regency Enterprises and 20th Century Fox)\n\nRegency Television (50%) (a joint venture between Regency Enterprises and Fox 21 Television Studios)\n\nEx[]\n\nRestless Records: Rock recording company, sold to Rykodisc in 2001.\n\nBabyFirst (30%): cable channel in U.S. aimed at 0-3 year olds.\n\nFilmography[]\n\nAs Embassy International Pictures N.V.:\n\nThe King of Comedy (1982) (co-production with 20th Century Fox)\n\nOnce Upon a Time in America (1984) (co-production with The Ladd Company, PSO Enterprises, Rafran Cinematografia and Warner Bros.)\n\nBrazil (1985) (co-production with Brazil Productions, 20th Century Fox and Universal Pictures)\n\nLegend (1985) (co-production with Universal Pictures and 20th Century Fox)\n\nStripper (1986) (co-production with 20th Century Fox)\n\nMan on Fire (1987) (co-production with Acteurs Auteurs Associes (AAA) and TriStar Pictures) (Uncredited)\n\nAs Regency International Pictures:\n\nWho's Harry Crumb?
