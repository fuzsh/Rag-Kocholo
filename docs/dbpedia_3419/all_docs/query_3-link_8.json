        "text": "About the Filmmaker\n\nLuke Greenfield (Director)\n\nFrom his earliest memories growing up in Westport, Connecticut, Luke Greenfield wanted to make movies. With 25 short films to his credit before even entering the prestigious USC School of Cinema-Television, Greenfield stayed in Hollywood after completing the program to pursue his dream. The result of his unique mix of talent, discipline and passion for the medium is evident in his second film, THE GIRL NEXT DOOR.\n\nPreviously, Greenfield co-wrote and directed \"The Right Hook,\" a 10-minute short film he wrote with actor David Scotti. The edgy comedy attracted enormous attention and served as a calling card for Greenfield as he pursued feature film opportunities in Hollywood. At 28, before even completing \"The Right Hook,\" Greenfield was offered what would become his Hollywood directorial debut, \"The Animal.\" Starring Rob Schneider, the film was produced by Adam Sandler and Revolution Studios for Columbia Pictures in 2001.\n\nGreenfield strives to make films with emotional impact, executed in a way audiences haven't seen before. Most importantly, he seeks to make movies that people will never forget. He wants to move people in the same way he was affected by his favorite films, which include \"One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,\" \"Broadcast News,\" \"Cool Hand Luke\" and \"The Great Santini.\"\n\nCollaboration is an essential element of Greenfield's filmmaking aesthetic. He loves working closely with writers, actors, cinematographers and editors. Greenfield is hands-on in every aspect of a project, from development to the marketing and advertising.\n\nGreenfield has five projects and a one-hour television series pilot in development.\n\nCharles Gordon (Producer)\n\nCharles Gordon's films have grossed over $1 billion worldwide. Among his blockbuster titles are \"Die Hard,\" \"Die Hard 2: Die Harder,\" \"Field Of Dreams\" and \"Waterworld.\" In addition, Gordon produced \"October Sky,\" a coming-of-age film starring Jake Gyllenhaal that garnered several honors, including the Humanitas Award, Broadcast Film Critics Award, Christopher Award, and a Writer's Guild of America nomination.\n\nA native of Mississippi, Gordon began his career as an agent. He turned to writing and producing for television, and in one five-year period, created and produced five television pilots, with three shows being picked up for series. His television credits include the critically-acclaimed \"Our Family Honor,\" \"Renegades,\" \"Just Our Luck\" and \"When the Whistle Blows.\"\n\nA career highlight for Gordon was producing \"Field Of Dreams,\" starring Kevin Costner, which garnered three Academy Award¨ nominations, including Best Picture.

He then joined Charles Gordon at Daybreak Productions, serving as the company's President.\n\nArnon Milchan (Executive Producer)\n\nArnon Milchan (Executive Producer) is widely renowned as one of the most prolific and successful independent film producers of the past 25 years, with over 70 feature films to his credit. Born in Israel, Milchan was educated at the University of Geneva. His first business venture was to transform his father's modest business into one of his country's largest agro-chemical companies. This early achievement was a harbinger of Milchan's now-legendary reputation in the international marketplace as a keen businessman.\n\nSoon, Milchan began to underwrite projects in an area that had always held a special interest for him Ð film, television and theater. Early projects include Roman Polanski's theater production of \"Amadeus,\" \"Dizengoff 99,\" \"La Menace,\" \"The Medusa Touch\" and the mini-series \"Masada.\" By the end of the 1980s, Milchan had produced such films as Martin Scorsese's \"The King Of Comedy,\" Sergio Leone's \"Once Upon a Time in America\" and Terry Gilliam's \"Brazil.\"\n\nAfter the huge success of \"Pretty Woman\" and \"The War Of The Roses,\" Milchan founded New Regency Productions and went on to produce a string of successful films, including \"J.F.K.,\" \"Sommersby,\" \"A Time To Kill,\" \"Free Willy,\" \"The Client,\" \"Tin Cup,\" \"Under Siege,\" \"L.A.

The film stars Richard Gere and Juliette Binoche, and is directed by Dave Siegel and Scott McGehee.\n\nAlong the way, Milchan brought on board two powerful investors and partners who share his vision: Australian businessman Kerry Packer's Nine Network and Twentieth Century Fox.
