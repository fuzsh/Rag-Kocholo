        "text": "Wearing gray khakis, worn slippers and his signature wire-rim glasses, Hollywood producer Arnon Milchan slips easily into his role as the distracted scholar. \"You want to see my collection?\" he asks an evening visitor to his oceanfront house just outside Los Angeles. Sipping champagne from a wineglass, he points out various artwork, part of a collection spread through homes in Israel, Paris and L.A.: paintings by Picasso, Van Gogh, Basquiat, Bacon; a small sculpture by Rodin. The cry of an infant upstairs pierces the rolling crash of waves outside. Milchan disappears and reemerges with his 9-month-old son, Shimon Alexandre (the youngest of five children from two marriages), and his wife of two years, Amanda, a petite blonde from South Africa who once ranked third among the world's women tennis players. \"Two generations of Shimon,\" he laughs, nodding at a framed photo of Shimon Peres, Israel's president and a close friend, cradling Milchan's baby.\n\n\"Bringing peace to the Middle East is the most important thing to me,\" Milchan says, suddenly serious. \"I think I can do it.\" That sets off a disquisition on the challenges of getting past long-stalled negotiations--until another thought crosses him. Milchan gets on the speakerphone, calls an assistant at New Regency Enterprises, his production company, and asks to be connected to some people who earlier that day had discussed his investing in a national media company whose name Milchan would prefer not to see in print. \"I'm really very interested in this deal,\" he says in Israeli-accented English. \"I know maybe I didn't seem it, but I'm very interested.\" One of the men mentions that Miramax may be for sale, too, for $600 million or so. Milchan doesn't miss a beat: He'd like to look at that one, too.\n\nVideo: Hollywood Billionaire's Passion For Art\n\nDon't be fooled by the absentminded shtick. Milchan is a creative and ferociously focused entrepreneur, with a net worth we estimate at $3.6 billion, coming from movies, fertilizer, weapons systems and commodities. At age 65 he's far from through. (After the Mumbai bombings in late 2008, Milchan founded Blue Sky International, a security company, to help protect friends like Jamsetji Nusserwanji Tata, owner of the Taj Hotel, from terrorist acts.) Milchan is very well connected in Hollywood and Israel, and exploits those ties to further his social and political interests, as well as his business goals. Still he loves playing the genial bumbler. In front of audiences, he's known for sheepishly patting down his pockets, looking for imaginary notes. \"I don't have a prepared speech with me,\" he might say to investors or a Tinseltown crowd, \"so I'm going to speak from the heart.\"\n\nFor many who know Milchan, that means talking about one of the 120-plus films he's produced since launching the privately held New Regency in 1991. Today, he claims, it grosses in excess of $1 billion a year and has been responsible for such recent box-office hits as Bride Wars (2009), Marley & Me (2008), Alvin & the Chipmunks (2007) and Mr. and Mrs. Smith (2005). But there's a lot more to the guy.\n\nMilchan grew up in Rehovot, just outside Tel Aviv, in an upper-middle-class family. Sent to boarding school in the U.K., he got a degree in business from City of London College, then studied business administration in Geneva. But when his father got sick in 1962, Milchan returned to Israel and at 21 was left with the family's small fertilizer business, near bankruptcy, and $61,000. He took a novel approach to the business, working with the ministries of agriculture and health, offering up Israel as a testing ground for new pesticides being invented by companies like Hoechst and Rh√¥ne Poulenc. Within four years Milchan Bros. Ltd. had mushroomed into a $125-million-a-year company with interests in agriculture, animal health products, plastic, fiber optics and pharmaceuticals. It had also expanded to Iran, Turkey and Greece.\n\nBy then Milchan had done a tour of duty in the military. During the Six-Day War he served in a unit that hand-delivered messages between headquarters and Jerusalem. The experience prepared him for his next career--working with the Israeli Air Force. \"We made use of [Arnon's] talents, his connections, his capabilities, in many [areas]--including the domain of security,\" says Shimon Peres. Milchan acted as matchmaker between the Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. defense contractors like Raytheon and Hawker Beechcraft for weapons systems that included Hawk and Patriot missiles. He balks at the term \"arms dealer.\" \"It was consulting,\" Milchan says. \"You don't actually buy a missile or plane. You consult; you represent the interests of the buyer and the seller.\" By the late 1970s Israel was producing its own military technology and exporting to pariah clients like the apartheid government of South Africa (the U.S. eventually cut off its weapons sales there).\n\nThis chapter of his life returned to haunt him. Milchan insists his role in South Africa had nothing to do with arms consulting. He says he was involved in a public relations campaign to explain to Western audiences the importance of keeping South Africa--a country rich in minerals, uranium and gold--from falling into communist hands during the Cold War. He says that he had no idea the campaign diverted funds into suppressing political opposition and that when he found out, he cut ties with South Africa's government. In 2000 Milchan granted a rare interview to 60 Minutes and dismissed rumors that he'd worked as a spy. He had set up Heli Trading Ltd. to help Israel and the U.S. acquire aerospace and electronic equipment off the government books and collaborate on defense systems. This spilled into the open in 1985, when Richard K. Smyth, a California aerospace engineer, was indicted on charges that he'd illegally exported 800 krytrons, electronic switches used as detonators in nuclear weapons, to Israel in the early 1980s. Smyth had been president of Heli at the time. By that time, Milchan says, he had already moved on to Hollywood and was not involved in this business. Milchan was never accused of any wrongdoing; Smyth disappeared a week before his trial date.\n\nBefore his company settled in southern California Milchan produced small films and commercials while living in Paris and London. He'd made connections like Richard Burton and Tony Scott, too; that helped with critical introductions in the U.S. He produced Once Upon a Time in America (1984), the violent crime saga starring Robert De Niro. Milchan's breakout movie came six years later: Pretty Woman cost $17 million to make and grossed $180 million from domestic theaters, $300 million internationally. Yet, in what he calls his \"billion-dollar mistake,\" Milchan had cut a deal with Disney to receive 12.5% of the gross (later adjusted to 7.5%), or 20% of the profit, whichever was higher. After that he vowed to control more of the movies he produced.\n\nLucrative partnerships followed. Terry Semel, then chief executive of Warner Bros., suggested that Milchan use European contacts to raise money; Warner would match the amount, and together they could double their cinematic output. Warner got to keep 10% of the gross for distribution; New Regency owned the movie rights and the profits or losses. That alliance, which produced lucrative hits like JFK (1991) and L.A. Confidential (1997), lasted until 1997.\n\nVideo: Hollywood Billionaire's Passion For Art\n\nSpecial Offer: Free Trial Issue of Forbes\n\nThat was right around the time Peter Chernin, former president of Fox Film Entertainment, introduced Milchan to Rupert Murdoch. \"It was me chasing him,\" Chernin recalls. \"From a studio perspective, he's the single best financing partnership that exists out there.\" Murdoch bought a 20% stake in New Regency for $200 million and invested $60 million into a 50-50 venture to create a new television company whose hits include Malcolm in the Middle. Under 20th Century Fox's deal with Milchan, it can distribute pictures without having to produce them jointly or tie up lots of capital. Fox pulls in perhaps $40 million to $60 million a year in distribution fees from the partnership. This summer they will bring out Knight and Day, the action comedy starring Tom Cruise and Cameron Diaz. New Regency's agreement with 20th Century Fox expires in three years. Although Milchan says he's happy with the relationship, he has other potential partners--\"temptations,\" he calls them--knocking on his door. That's a stage whisper meant for Murdoch's ears. \"He's always been a very good and honest and open friend,\" says News Corp. 's chairman. \"The business partnership has worked very nicely, I think, for both sides, very fairly, and we've kept it that way.\"\n\nMilchan likes to win--even when it comes to friendly tennis games. Both Murdoch and Semel say they'll play Milchan only if they can grab his wife and former tennis pro Amanda as a partner in doubles. \"Then we'll whip him,\" Murdoch laughs. While Semel and Milchan sometimes compete in art auctions, one usually defers to the other. David Matalon, his former president at New Regency and at one time his right-hand man, says Milchan is \"relentless, like a pit bull.\" Matalon has known Milchan since the two played soccer against each other in the U.K. at age 16. Years later, when they were vacationing at a private island in Fiji and staying in rustic cabins with no telephones, Milchan managed to find a phone booth by the reception area where he spent half the day making calls. \"He couldn't wait to find out the numbers on a film that had just come out in the U.S.,\" says Matalon, \"even though it wasn't one of our films.\"\n\nMilchan can be at his most unyielding when it comes to some of his more far-fetched ideas. In 1996, for example, New Regency started investing in Puma , the German athletic footwear company, with the idea of cross-promoting the talent of such stars as Venus and Serena Williams on the court and on the silver screen. Milchan invited Semel to run it, but he opted to head up Yahoo , a decision he came to regret. Some marketing deals worked; others didn't. Paying $150 million for an eventual 42% stake in Puma, New Regency sold out six years later in 2002 for $800 million.\n\nNothing is as much of a long shot as Milchan's quest for peace between the Israelis and the Palestinians--and nothing seems to excite him more. He certainly knows all the players on one side. \"Israel has not had a single prime minister who I haven't consulted,\" he says. Milchan says he can bring a Palestinian and Israeli leader into the same room; the real problem is their persuading constituents. But he envisions the impossible--even if it all sounds a little bit too much like a happy Hollywood ending. Still, says Shimon Peres, one knotty and experienced negotiator, \"This man can penetrate every place. When he sees a wall, he thinks it's a window.\"\n\nVideo: Hollywood Billionaire's Passion For Art"
