        "text": "Richard Harding and Sam Feuer will produce spy movie “The Son of Hamas” for Sixth Sense Productions\n\nAfter winning an audience award at Sundance, the riveting Israeli documentary “The Green Prince” is being adapted as a feature film titled “The Son of Hamas” by Sixth Sense Productions, the company announced Tuesday.\n\nWritten and directed by Nadav Schirman, “The Green Prince” takes a raw and honest look at the story of Mosab Hassan Yousef, the son of Hamas co-founder Sheikh Hassan Yousef, who spent a decade as an Israeli informer and helped take down the terrorist organization that he was once groomed to inherit.\n\n“The Son of Hamas” will follow Mosab Hassan Yousef, the eldest son of one of the five founding members of the terrorist group Hamas. Born and raised as a Muslim extremist and bred to hate and kill all Jews, Mosab was groomed at an early age to one day take over Hamas. However, the world had different plans for him.\n\nWhile being held captive in an Israeli prison, Mosab saw first-hand the wayward idealism behind Hamas, torturing anyone without rhyme or reason, orchestrating suicide bombers and killing countless innocent victims. His sense of humanity and righteousness pushed him to do the impossible and go against everything he’s ever known by betraying his father and defying Hamas to spy for Israel.\n\nOver the span of 10 years, under the code name The Green Prince, Mosab worked tirelessly to take down Hamas. Along the way, he found solace in Christianity and learned to let go of the guilt he’s harbored for so long. He also embraced the teachings of Jesus Christ, which helped him come to terms with himself, the choices he’s made and find peace within.\n\nRichard Harding and Sam Feuer will produce “The Son of Hamas” for Sixth Sense Productions, which will adapt Yousef’s autobiography of the same name. The book purports to be a gripping account of terror, betrayal, political intrigue, and unthinkable choices.\n\nThe producers are currently seeking a writer to tackle the script before they hire a director and actors.\n\nHarding and Feuer are represented by attorney Greg Bernstein.\n\nComments"
