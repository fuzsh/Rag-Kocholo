        "text": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA.com) — One of Hollywood's biggest hitmakers has made a bombshell admission.\n\nProducer Arnon Milchan, whose credits include \"Pretty Woman,\" \"L.A. Confidential\" and \"Fight Club,\" claims he spent 20 years as a leading Israeli intelligence agent.\n\nIn a new interview broadcast on Israel's investigative program \"Uvda,\" a reporter asks Milchan about a 1983 instance in which he reportedly used actor Richard Dreyfuss to help set up a meeting between an American nuclear scientist and Israeli officials.\n\nMilchan reportedly says: \"Everybody wants to meet a star. And that's how the meeting happened.\"\n\nMilchan says he was recruited before he became a huge movie producer, and that he later used his stardom to help his native country.\n\nBut as KCAL9's Brittney Hopper reports, other industry heavyweights appear less than shocked about the admission.\n\nA-list actors Ben Affleck and Robert De Niro heard the rumors but say they didn't care.\n\n\"I remember I asked Arnon about that, being friends. I was curious — but not in an accusatory way — and he said, 'Yeah, I did. I'm Israeli and that's my country,'\" De Niro recalled.\n\n\"He's a very mysterious exotic figure in Hollywood. I don't know what the truth is,\" Affleck said in a previous interview.\n\nMilchan says it was patriotism that motivated his actions.\n\n\"I did it for my country. And I'm proud of it,\" he said."
