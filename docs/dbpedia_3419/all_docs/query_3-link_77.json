        "text": "Background\n\nRegency Enterprises is an American film production company formed in 1991 as a joint venture between film producer Arnon Milchan, Scriba & Deyle and Canal+ to finance 20 films in five years, with New Regency Productions acting as its production and sales arm. Its films were distributed by Warner Bros. until 1998, and by 20th Century Fox (later under their current parent company The Walt Disney Studios) from 1999 onward (with some released by Columbia Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Focus Features, A24, and Amazon MGM Studios, among others). With the distribution deal it initially signed in 1997 (and later extended twice), Fox bought a 20% stake in the company. This stake remained even after Fox's merger with Disney in 2019, with the deal extended again in late 2021 under Disney's watch.\n\nToday much of Regency's film library is held by Disney through 20th Century Studios; however, Warner Bros. has retained distribution rights to select titles released during the Warner partnership, including JFK, Heaven & Earth, Natural Born Killers, and Tin Cup.\n\n1st Logo (July 20, 1994-December 25, 2015)\n\nVisuals: On a black background, a glowing blue light draws a stylized \"R\". As the camera pans out, the glowing emitting from it slowly dims, and \"R E G E N C Y\" turns toward the camera under it as the logo shines.\n\nTrivia: On the audio commentary of Gone Girl (2014), director David Fincher comments at the beginning of the film that it became profoundly aware to him and others during editing that Regency needed to get a new logo (this being before the company did indeed debut a new logo).\n\nVariants:\n\nOn the 2000 TV movie Noriega: God's Favorite, the logo freezes just before it shines.\n\nStarting in 2013, the logo is in a lighter shade of blue, and the light is purple; also, the overall animation is smoother than in the original variant.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: A mystical orchestral tune in D minor with a flute, which is transposed to C# major when the logo is done forming. A faint whoosh as the \"R\" is drawn and some cymbal crashes as the logo shines are also heard. This was composed by Danny Elfman, and is a condensed sample of the main title theme from the 1993 film Sommersby, a production from the company.\n\nAudio Variants:\n\nOn most films released during the logo's early years (a example being Under Siege 2: Dark Territory), it is silent. The regular theme debuted on Bogus (1996).\n\nOn some films (e.g. Heat), the opening theme plays instead.\n\nOn Free Willy 3: The Rescue, the music starts a little earlier than the logo itself.\n\nOn The Negotiator, the whooshing sounds are louder, a rumbling sound is heard when the text rises up, and a cymbal for the shine.\n\nOn a couple 1999-2002 films, the very beginning of the music plays alongside the tail end of the 20th Century Fox logo's music as said logo fades to black.\n\nOn Fantastic Mr. Fox, the music fades in a second before the visuals appear.\n\nAvailability: Seen on any film produced by Regency from 1994 to 2015. It also appeared on licensed games, such as Fight Club.\n\nThis logo first appeared on The Client, and made its final appearance on The Revenant.\n\nIt makes an appearance as a de-facto home video logo on the PAL DVD release of Ridley Scott's Legend instead of the 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment logo.\n\nAnother early Regency title, The King of Comedy, has this plastered over the 20th Century Fox logo on the Warner Home Video release.\n\nIt also appears at the start of the 2000 Showtime TV movie Noriega: God's Favorite\n\nLegacy: This logo has been praised for its fanfare.\n\n2nd Logo (November 10, 2016-)\n\nVisuals: On a dark gray background with a light, the top of a redesigned version of the \"R\" from the previous logo forms. It zooms down, showing both the rest of the top and the bottom form, and the logo zooms out to show the full thing, similar to the last logo, but silver color fills in. Then the company name (set in Blair) appears from right to left in the same color.\n\nTechnique: CGI.\n\nAudio: The 1996 theme from the previous logo. Otherwise, none or the opening theme of the movie."
