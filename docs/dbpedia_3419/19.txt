Emerson College alumna Pamela Abdy ’95, president of production at New Regency, saw her company’s film, The Revenant, take home a Golden Globe award for Best Motion Picture – Drama on Sunday night.

Arnon Milchan, parent of an Emerson alumnus from the Class of 1994, is a producer of the film, which stars Leonardo DiCaprio, winner of the Golden Globe for Best Actor in a Motion Picture – Drama, and Tom Hardy.

Based on a true story, The Revenant tells the story of a hunter (DiCaprio) left for dead in the wilderness and his quest to take revenge on the man who betrayed him (Hardy). It was directed by Alejandro G. Iñárritu, who won this year for Best Director – Motion Picture.

Another Emerson parent, John Lasseter P ’19, was the executive producer of this year’s Best Motion Picture – Animated, Inside Out. He is chief creative officer of Pixar Animation Studios and Disney Animation Studios.

Inside Out tells the story of a young girl and her emotions—which are personified—as she moves to a new city.
