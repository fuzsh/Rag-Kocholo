        "text": "Life on the edges of Spanish territory was filled with perils, including disease, attack from hostile indigenous groups, and limited supplies. Support from established Spanish colonies would take a long time to arrive if any dangers were faced – if help ever arrived. Few Spanish settlers were willing to be the first to establish a foothold in this territory in which there was little potential for personal profit. Spain’s solution to this problem was to set up Catholic missions, which would convert the indigenous people to Catholicism and teach them the skills that Spain believed were important to being a Spanish citizen. The Spanish government believed this would only take ten years. According to their plans, the missions would then be disbanded, the indigenous people would be citizens of Spain, and their communities would be self-sustaining. In 1680-1690, Spain established missions in the far eastern and western reaches of Texas, near the present-day towns of El Paso, Presidio, and Nacogdoches.\n\nAfter Olivares visited the San Antonio area during an expedition in 1709, he asked that the mission be moved to what he felt was an ideal location. San Antonio could serve as a bridge to the missions Spain had established in east Texas. The area was perfectly situated on a river. The indigenous people seemed receptive to the benefits a mission could provide, including protection from attack by other indigenous groups and stable food sources during lean hunting and foraging times of the year. The new mission, which Olivares established in San Antonio in 1718, was Mission San Antonio de Valero, which would later become the Alamo."
