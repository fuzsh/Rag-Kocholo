        "text": "Famous Explorers of the World\n\nSince the dawn of human civilization, constant need of human expansion set the army of explorers to discover new lands and new routes to travel across the unfamiliar terrain. Those early periods of exploration proved to be instrumental in the future, and they paved the way for all the future explorers that imagined strange lands just beyond horizon.\n\nAs we look back into history, the most prominent era for the explorers was without a doubt a time between 15th and 17th century, when European countries began exploring the continents of Americas. However, those discoveries would never be made without the efforts of the ancient explorers from the almost 2000 years ago. Tales of the journeys of Skylax (who managed to circumvent Arabian Peninsula in 500 BC), Pytheas (who in 300 BC discovered England, Scandinavia and polar ice) and Alexander the Great (who explored the areas of Middle East and almost reached India) ignited the minds of medieval explorers, who set their sights on finding the water route to distant India.\n\nUnder the orders of the royal courts of Spain and Portugal, organized parties of naval explorers spread beyond the Mediterranean. While Portugal slowly and systematically mapped the western coast of Africa in search of the way to India, Spain took a gamble and accepted to fund the mission of Italian navigator Christopher Columbus, who postulated that India could be reached by sailing to the west. Discovery of the continents of Americas, and Ferdinand Magellan's successful circumvention of the Earth created the biggest wave of human exploration and colonization our world has ever seen. Hundreds of famous explorers scoured across the oceans, in search of undiscovered lands. During that period, entire North and South America were fully mapped, with only a few isolated areas remaining uncharted (most notably fabled Northwestern Passage between Canada and Polar Ice, and endless forest around river Amazon). Sadly, this exciting time of exploration also brought destruction of several Native American civilizations, especially in Central America (fall of Aztec and Inca empires).\n\nExplorers from 18th and 19th century focused their work on last remaining two continents - Australia and Africa. During that time, English navigator James Cook traveled several times across the Pacific discovering Australia, Hawaii and searching for the elusive Northwestern Passage, focus of many European explorers was in the central and South Africa. Driven by the increased hostilities before the start of World War I, the entire continent of Africa was conquered and put under European rule. During that time, several explorers found their fame discovering new African lands, most notably David Livingstone.\n\nWith every continent of the earth fully mapped, explorers of the 20th century set their sights on only two remaining unmapped parts of the world - North and South Pole. During the time today known as \"Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration\", several dozen expeditions went into harsh Pole environments in search for glory and scientific discovery. Most important explorers from that time were Norwegian Roald Amundsen (who first reached the South Pole) and Robert Peary (who first reached North Pole).\n\nThe last great area of exploration was created in the second part of the 20th century with the development of space travel. Driven by the increased hostilities between the United States and the Soviet Union, thousands of scientists gave the way for the new breed of explorers to go outside of the confines of the Earth and visits the worlds never before seen and touched by humankind. To this day, one of the most important moments in the history of the world is represented by the first space flight by Yuri Gagarin and famous moon landing by Neil Armstrong. Hopefully, advanced science will in the future enable the humankind furthermore to explore the distant planets of our solar system.\n\nList of Famous Explorers\n\nFrederick Cook\n\nArctic explorer Frederick Cook was one of the two people who claimed they were the first who reached the territory of North Pole in 1907.
