        "text": "On the Water Adventures at the Maritime Museum of San Diego\n\nLooking for on the water adventure? We have that covered. Enjoy one of our many exciting options to feed your adventurous side.\n\nGeneral Sail Day info – What to bring on a Day Sail\n\nSunscreen or sunblock\n\nClosed toed shoes with non-slip soles\n\nSunglasses\n\nHat for sun protection and or warmth (should stay on in a stiff breeze)\n\nJacket that will protect you from cold and wind (the wind chill factor can be 15 degrees cooler then the land temperature.)\n\nCamera and a smile.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nIs sea sickness an issue?\n\nWe recommend that if you have any doubt, you take preventive measures before hand. (Bonine, Dramamine, etc.)\n\nCan I bring my own drinks and food?\n\nGlass containers, coolers, strollers, folding chairs and alcohol are not permitted onboard. Californian has ice chests if you need refrigeration. Passengers are allowed to bring a bagged lunch and non-glass beverages.\n\nWhat happens in the case of bad weather?\n\nWind and weather are not under control and the trip may be rescheduled or cut short should conditions prohibit safe passage. If weather conditions are poor on the date of your sail, please call for updates.\n\nHow many guests are on board?\n\nAt max capacity: Californian – 45, San Salvador – 40, PCF-816 Swift Boat – 25, Pilot – 30.\n\nCan I participate in Sailing the ship?\n\nAboard Californian & San Salvador YES! We encourage participation. It’s up to you, your ambitions, abilities and attitude. The captain will have ultimate control of the ship and its crews movements. Pilot & Swift Boat is a sit back and enjoy the ride with narration, but you can get up and move around.\n\nWhat do you do when you have a baby on board (a 1-year-old)?\n\nFor safety reasons, we suggest you hold the child. This might create some problems in going below deck, as the stairs are steep. But crew members and docents are available to help, if needed.\n\nDoes everyone wear life jackets, including the baby?\n\nNo, they are up to you as an individual to determine whether you want to wear one. Just ask as you board, if you prefer to wear one. Life jackets are provided as required by the U.S. Coast Guard. Coast Guard regulations require us have life jackets available, but they are not required to be worn.\n\nCan you go below deck, or does everyone stay above the whole time?\n\nThis is completely up to you. Most persons enjoy the topside areas of the sailing experience, but the *restrooms are below deck (*Californian & San Salvador only).\n\nRestrooms aboard?\n\nCalifornian, & San Salvador have restrooms (heads in boat speak). Pilot and PCF-816 Swift Boat do not.\n\nOnce (sometimes twice) a year we do multi-day sailing adventures. If you would like to be notified about when one becomes avaiable, fill out the form below, and we will contact you.\n\nIf you would like to be added to the contact list for our next adventure\n\nClick Here\n\nClick here for pictures from our first tour!"
