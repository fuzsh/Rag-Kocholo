        "text": "On Thursday, Cole Brauer made history, becoming the first American woman to sail solo nonstop around the world. The 29-year-old from Long Island, New York, celebrated at the finish line in Spain by drinking champagne from her trophy.\n\nFriends, peers and sailing enthusiasts had been cheering Brauer on since last October, when she embarked on her more than four-month journey.\n\nRace organizer Marco Nannini told USA TODAY he started the Global Solo Challenge to \"create a platform for sailors like Cole to showcase her skills and move on to a pro sailor career.\"\n\nWhile at sea Brauer kept her more than 400,000 Instagram followers updated − and entertained − with videos from onboard First Light. The trip was extremely challenging and physically exhausting, Brauer said in one video from December.\n\nIn the post, she describes how frustrated she felt when she had to fix and replace different parts of the boat.\n\n\"I don't want you guys to think I'm like Superwoman or something,\" Brauer said. \"Right now I've been feeling just broken,\" she added, describing how she had to fix the boat's autopilot system after injuring her torso against the side of the boat's hull amid intense waves.\n\nCole Brauer coming to Newport to talk about solo experience\n\nSail Newport will be hosting Brauer on May 16 at 5:30 p.m. at the Jane Pickens Theater where guests will be able to meet Brauer and hear about her journey. Sail Newport Executive Director Brad Read will emcee the event. Tickets went on sale Friday and are already sold out, but those interested in attending may register to be on the waitlist.\n\nWho is Cole Brauer?\n\nBrauer is from Long Island and competed for the University of Hawaii sailing team. She went to high school in East Hampton, New York, her university team website says. She was the youngest of more than a dozen sailors, or skippers, in the Global Solo Challenge.\n\nThe professional sailor lives in Boothbay, Maine, and during the spring and summer, she can be also found in Newport, gearing up for races, the Newport Daily News reported last year.\n\nBrauer has sailed on First Light, a 40-foot yacht, for over five years, the outlet reported.\n\n\"I always said I wanted to race around the world in this boat,\" she told the Daily News.\n\nFrom above and below First Light's deck, Brauer shared aspects of her journey with followers and die-hard sailing fans.\n\nOn New Year's Eve, she donned a dress and danced at midnight, and in another post, she showed off how many pull-ups she can do.\n\nAs the only woman racing solo, nonstop around the world in the first Global Solo Challenge, Brauer said she was determined to prove there's nothing women and girls cannot accomplish.\n\n\"I push so much harder when someone's like, 'No, you can't do that,'\" Brauer told NBC Nightly News. \"And I'm like, 'OK, watch me.'\"\n\nBrauer is the first American woman to sail solo around the world. But Kay Cottee of Australia was the first woman in the world to accomplish the milestone, sailing off from Sydney Harbor in Australia in November 1987 and returning 189 days later.\n\nOn her profile page on the Global Solo Challenge website, Brauer said she wanted to send a message to the sailing community that it's time to leave its male-dominated culture in the past. In the profile, Brauer took aim at a lack of equal pay and what she describes as harassment in the sailing industry.\n\n\"Just as well as this community has built me up it has broken me and my fellow female teammates down. I am doing this race for them,\" Brauer said.\n\nBrauer and her spokesperson did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nHow long was Cole Brauer at sea?\n\nBrauer was sailing for over four months after departing on Oct. 29.\n\nShe finished second in the race, behind a sailor who departed about a month before she did.\n\nThe start times differed because that first place boat, Phillipe Delamare's Mowgli, is much slower, Nannini said, explaining the race's staggered start times.\n\n\"The format means that if you enter on a slow, small boat you can still win, which makes it much more inclusive than an event where a bigger budget is a definite advantage,\" he said.\n\nFrance's Delamare will win first-place prize money of 7,500 euros (about $8,140), Brauer will win 5,000 euros (about $5,430) and the third place finisher will win 2,500 euros (about $2,710), Nannini said.\n\nHow dangerous was Cole Brauer's sailing race?\n\nA medical team including a nurse and a physician trained Brauer and sent her on her journey with medicines and medical supplies, in case of any health issues, according to her Instagram account.\n\nEarly in the race, Brauer administered her own IV with a saline solution after she became dehydrated, according to one video posted to her social media.\n\nBrauer's most serious health scare happened in early December when she said gnarly ocean conditions caused the boat to jolt, throwing her across the inside of the boat and slamming her hard against a wall.\n\nHer ribs were badly bruised as a result, and her medical team told her to alternate between taking Advil and Tylenol, Brauer said on Instagram.\n\n\"Rigging up a sleeping seat belt has been added to my priority list,\" she said in the post's caption. \"I know I'm very lucky that this wasn't a lot worse.\"\n\nWhat is the Global Solo Challenge?\n\nThe inaugural Global Solo Challenge is a nonstop sailing race in which competitors departed last year from A Coruña, Spain.\n\nThe race encompasses nearly 30,000 miles and takes place mostly in the southern hemisphere.\n\nAfter leaving waters off the coast of Spain, sailors travel south and around Africa's Cape of Good Hope. The race then includes the two other capes that together make up the famous three great capes: Australia's Cape Leeuwin and South America's Cape Horn.\n\nAbout half of the other competitors dropped out of the race, according to racing data posted online by the Global Solo Challenge.\n\nDelamare finished the race late last month after embarking on his journey in late September 2023, according to race data.\n\nContributing: Newport Daily News and Associated Press"
