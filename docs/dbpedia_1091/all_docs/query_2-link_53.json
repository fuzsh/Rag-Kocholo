        "text": "This Spanish language course is offered online and is live and interactive.\n\nSpanish for Nautical with online teachers\n\nConversate with an engineer about a leaking salt water pump while translating the local Spanish weather forecast. Come in port with the ability to communicate with the person at the fuel dock or the marina employees who offer to take your lines. Ask a passing fishing boat for some sardines with confidence.\n\nThis is a six-session live online Spanish language course that focuses on the things that sailors visiting Spain could need. You'll brush up on any Spanish you already know. There will be a lot of interaction and talk, all in the privacy and safety of your own home, free from bugs.\n\nYou may see the online instructor, the slides she might provide, and a whiteboard function, and send her any questions on your PC, MAC, or mobile device.\n\nThe course targets a variety of pre-existing skills. You should be able to understand and use the present tense rather well. We advise you to contact Spanish teachers online from LiveXP to master the fundamentals. You can learn Spanish online quickly and be ready for the course. A \"test your level\" link will be provided after you join up. We will determine your skill level, and based on the number of participants and the range of skill levels, we may divide the group into two classes.\n\nSpanish Teachers from LiveXP\n\nSpanish lessons for adults can be taken online from competent native speakers (CLTA - Certificate in Language Teaching for Adults). They enjoy creating custom content to teach what they find valuable and customizing the classes to their students' needs and expectations. Online tutors use a conversational method to teach the language so that you will learn Spanish in an immersive setting with fun activities."
