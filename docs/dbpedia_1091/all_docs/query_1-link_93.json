Big surprise there.\n\nInteresting.\n\nWhere do you stand on swimming under your best in a heat or one event to save energy for another? Or having qualified, pulling out on an event entirely even though you're clearly not injured? Or just not bothering to race in events you've entered.\n\nFinn race 7 has ended, victory for Ben Ainsley, PJ Postma second.Jonas Hogh Christensen 8th!\n\nDifference between Jonas Hogh Christensen and Ben Ainsley is only four points now!\n\nWind was 16 to 14 knots Somewhat what it was all week. Guess wind doesn't have to do with it.\n\nDespite the 15 Kilograms difference in weight between Ben and Jonas.\n\nJonas Hogh Christensen is falling back further in the tournament.\n\nFirst Race 470 men just finished:\n\nHere is the top 10:\n\n1 Matthias Schmid, Florian Reichsteaedter, AUT\n\n2 Luke Patience, Stuart Bithell, GBR\n\n3 Mathew Belcher, Malcolm Page, AUS\n\n4 Anton Dahlberg, Sebastian Östling, SWE\n\n5 Lucas Calabrese, Juan de la Fuente, ARG\n\n6 Gabrio Zandonã, Pietro Zucchetti, ITA\n\n7 Onan Barreiros, Aaron Sarmiento, ESP\n\n8 Paul Snow-Hansen, Jason Saunders, NZL\n\n9 Sime Fantela, Igor Marenic, CRO\n\n10 Sven Coster, Kalle Coster, NED\n\nFinn race 7 has ended, victory for Ben Ainsley, PJ Postma second.Jonas Hogh Christensen 8th!\n\nDifference between Jonas Hogh Christensen and Ben Ainsley is only four points now!\n\nWind was 16 to 14 knots Somewhat what it was all week.

Last World Championship in Perth, Ben took gold from JP Postma at the last race.\n\nHe knows when to win. I think we can expect Gold for Ben, Silver for Jonas Hogh Christensen and Bronze for Gaspic from Croatia.\n\nRace 3 for 470 men\n\nLuke patience and Stuart Bithell from Gbr switched first place with Matthias Schmidt and Florian Reichstadter from Austria.\n\nRace 6 RSX men\n\nDorian Rijssselberghe rules! 1,1,1,3,1,2 racesequence\n\nFighting for Bronze are Silver Toni Wilhelm from Germany and Przemyslaw Miarczynski from Poland\n\ndo rag must be hiding in his basement with the performance of the us competitors, oi oi oi\n\nThe US is tied with China for the most medals - what Olympics are you watching?
