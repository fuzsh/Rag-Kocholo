Big surprise there.\n\nInteresting.\n\nWhere do you stand on swimming under your best in a heat or one event to save energy for another? Or having qualified, pulling out on an event entirely even though you're clearly not injured? Or just not bothering to race in events you've entered.\n\nFinn race 7 has ended, victory for Ben Ainsley, PJ Postma second.Jonas Hogh Christensen 8th!\n\nDifference between Jonas Hogh Christensen and Ben Ainsley is only four points now!\n\nWind was 16 to 14 knots Somewhat what it was all week. Guess wind doesn't have to do with it.\n\nDespite the 15 Kilograms difference in weight between Ben and Jonas.\n\nJonas Hogh Christensen is falling back further in the tournament.\n\nFirst Race 470 men just finished:\n\nHere is the top 10:\n\n1 Matthias Schmid, Florian Reichsteaedter, AUT\n\n2 Luke Patience, Stuart Bithell, GBR\n\n3 Mathew Belcher, Malcolm Page, AUS\n\n4 Anton Dahlberg, Sebastian Ã–stling, SWE\n\n5 Lucas Calabrese, Juan de la Fuente, ARG\n\n6 Gabrio ZandonÃ£, Pietro Zucchetti, ITA\n\n7 Onan Barreiros, Aaron Sarmiento, ESP\n\n8 Paul Snow-Hansen, Jason Saunders, NZL\n\n9 Sime Fantela, Igor Marenic, CRO\n\n10 Sven Coster, Kalle Coster, NED\n\nFinn race 7 has ended, victory for Ben Ainsley, PJ Postma second.Jonas Hogh Christensen 8th!\n\nDifference between Jonas Hogh Christensen and Ben Ainsley is only four points now!\n\nWind was 16 to 14 knots Somewhat what it was all week.

Last World Championship in Perth, Ben took gold from JP Postma at the last race.\n\nHe knows when to win.
