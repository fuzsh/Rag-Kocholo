Hay que morir o triunfar, que nos enseña la Historia, en Lepanto la victoria y la muerte en Trafalgar.\n\nSpanish ships will be refered by HCMS/F/C - His Catholic Majesty's Ship/Frigate/Corvette/... - before ship´s name (Buque/Navio de Su Majestad Catolica - in spanish).\n\nThese abbreviations will distinguish same ship´s name from different nations and government warships from pivateers or privately-owned merchantmen.\n\nSPANISH Navy Characters Shipyards Ships per Classes Bought Ships Captured Ships Navy Abstracts Uniforms\n\nShips per Rates guns decks Abbreviation 1st Rates +100 3-4\n\nShips HCMS\n\n2nd Rates 80-96 2-3 3rd Rates 66-78 2 4th Rates 50-64 2 5th Rates 20-44 1 Frigates HCMF 6th Rates 12-34 1 Corvettes, Xebecs & Brigs Unrated - 1 Urcas, Galleys Hired Vessels - 1-2 Corsairs & Hired Vessels Private Co.

Vessels\n\nSpanish double names\n\nBesides nicknames, spanish ships usually had two names, the original one, given when launched and a second one, only if the original was a profane name, not religious, saint's name (santo de advocación). So most of spanish ships can be refered by two names.\n\nSpanish Armadas\n\nFrom the XV until the begginnign of the XVIII century, spanish navy was divided into Armadas.\n\nThese Armadas (or fleets) had a specific role and naval base (more info).\n\nNote: Will use a double n (nn) instead of an ñ, and ships called Nuestra Señora will be abreviated as N S.\n\nManuel Blasco is the person in charge of the Spanish Navy data (e-mail)\n\nSpecial thanks to Antonio Luis forum for his help in this project and specially to Santiago Gomez for his great research job about the spanish navy.\n\nSources:\n\nhttp://armadasiglo18.free.fr/armada18/batallas.htm"
