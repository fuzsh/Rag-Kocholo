The lands claimed by New Spain extended from Panama to the Arctic, although the capital was located in Mexico City. Gradually, rumors of riches in the area of present-day New Mexico and Colorado spread south to Mexico City during the early 1500s. Several attempts to find the riches were made, including that of Francisco Vásquez de Coronado.\n\nCoronado Expedition\n\nIn 1540, Coronado began his exploration of the American Southwest. Marching northward with seventy-five men, he found mud pueblos inhabited by Native Americans. The Spanish subdued the natives, established bases, and sent out smaller exploration parties. Coronado’s expedition failed in its search for wealth, but it brought about the first contact between Europeans and the Native American population. Native Americans eventually gained two valuable commodities from subsequent contacts with Europeans – the horse and the gun. The Spaniards reported on Native Americans, the absence of cities of gold, and land they considered worthless.\n\nWhen the Spaniards first arrived in the American Southwest, Native American groups already possessed elaborate trade networks that included a vast communication system, as well as more traditional trading relationships. The Spaniards and their New Mexican descendants recognized the economic successes of these trading relationships and adopted many of the Native Americans’ trade patterns and customs. This resulted in the development of cultural and economic traditions adaptable to the environment of the Southwest. The arid semi-desert environment required creative innovation in terms of water usage, crops, and livestock-raising techniques.\n\nDevelopment of trade with Native Americans allowed the aboriginal inhabitants access to European material culture, such as iron and other metals, as early as the mid-eighteenth century. Another shared aspect of life was the Roman Catholic religion, which many friars and padres brought with material goods to the Native Americans of the Southwest.\n\nSummary of Other Expeditions\n\nAt least twelve recorded expeditions into present-day Colorado occurred between 1593 and 1780 (table 1). Several lack documentation; however, they are mentioned by later expeditions. The initial visit to the region of present-day Colorado was an unauthorized expedition led by Francisco Leyva de Bonilla and Antonio Gutierrez de Humana in 1593. During the expedition, Humana murdered Bonilla, and all but one of the remaining members of the group were killed somewhere in the vicinity of the Purgatoire River. In a 1952 publication, historian Herbert Bolton places the encounter in eastern Kansas. In 1601, Juan de Oñate explored the region in an effort to locate evidence of the earlier Humana and Bonilla expedition and discovered the Arkansas River, which he named El Rio de San Francisco. However, the most significant expedition, in terms of being the first to document eastern Colorado, was the one led by Juan de Ulibarri in 1706 – 100 years before the much-heralded Zebulon Pike expedition.\n\nTable 1: Spanish Expeditions into Southeastern Colorado (1590–1790)\n\nAdapted from Gray and Lewis (1999–2007); History Colorado 1999–2013; Public Lands Interpretive Association 2006–14; Sangres.com, n.d., and others.\n\nEl Cuartelejo in the Seventeenth Century\n\nIn the early seventeenth century, prior to the 1680 Pueblo Revolt in New Mexico, religious persecution inspired local pueblos to lead a series of mini-rebellions against the Spanish. Pueblo spiritual leaders were subjected to flogging, imprisonment, slavery, or death by hanging. In 1640, ongoing revolts in Taos and the death of the mission priest Fray Pedro de Miranda led a number of Taos residents to flee to the plains to live with the Apache. The Taos fugitives went to a place that came to be called El Cuartelejo, a site north of the Arkansas River where they lived with other Pueblo refugees and Apaches.\n\nIn 1642 (earlier accounts indicate the 1660s), Juan de Archuleta led an expedition to the high plains to pacify the rebellious Pueblos. Although Archuleta’s journal has not been found, accounts of his expeditions taken from other sources indicate that he journeyed onto the plains prior to 1642 with twenty soldiers and a group of allied Pueblos.\n\nThe location of this place remains in dispute because historical evidence seems to place it near the junction of the Purgatoire and Arkansas Rivers in present-day Colorado, near the famous Bent’s Old Fort. Archaeological evidence places it a considerable distance to the east, in what is now Scott State Park in Kansas. In 1939–40 and 1969–70, the archaeological remains of a masonry pueblo, initially discovered in the late nineteenth century, were examined by researchers from the Smithsonian Institution and the Kansas State Historical Society, respectively. This was considered the site of El Cuartelejo. According to several historians, both locations may be correct.\n\nThe disastrous Villasur expedition was the last of the expeditions that had started at the end of the sixteenth century with the intent of finding the fabled Cibola, or Seven Cities of Gold, and protecting New Spain’s northern boundary from French intrusions. The last expedition, in 1779, was a punitive sojourn to confront the Comanche who had been raiding New Mexico since the early eighteenth century. The subsequent treaty between the Spanish and the Comanche in 1787 opened up the plains of eastern Colorado to trade for nearly 100 years.\n\nThe Spanish effort to conquer and control the lands that would become southeastern Colorado tended to be slow and methodical.

These settlements were slow to form, as inhabitants lived in constant danger of attack. Raids by Comanche and Ute bands were a constant and disruptive threat to the newly formed outposts. In response, the Spanish were supposed to have established an outpost at the site of El Cuartelejo (the Far Quarter) in 1709. The plan was abandoned after the killing of Pedro de Villasur in 1720.
