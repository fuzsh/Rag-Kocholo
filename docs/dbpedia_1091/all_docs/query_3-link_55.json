        "text": "Its seas and coastlines\n\nThe Mediterranean Sea bathes the eastern and south-eastern coasts of Spain, including popular tourist regions like the Balearic Islands, the Costa Brava and the Costa Dorada (Catalonia), la Costa Blanca (region of Valencia), the Costa Cálida (Region of Murcia) or the Costa del Sol (Andalusia). Its waters, in general, are the warmest and calmest. The Atlantic Ocean bathes the Canary Islands, the Costa de la Luz (Andalusia) and part of Galicia, with the Costa da Morte. Its constant currents and waves are great for nautical sports. The Cantabrian Sea bathes the regions of the Basque Country, Cantabria, Asturias and north of Galicia. Its waters are the coldest, and it has well-renowned surfing areas.\n\nThe sun and weather conditions\n\nGood weather and an accompanying wind are two of the necessary conditions for enjoying many nautical sports. Andalusia and the Canary Islands have around 300 days of sunshine a year. In addition, the entire coastline has months of pleasant temperatures lasting from the beginning of spring until autumn. In mainland Spain, on the other hand, there are areas well known for their winds. The south in particular with the Strait of Gibraltar (Cadiz) area and its Levante and Poniente winds, the Canary Islands and its Alisios winds, and the more northern areas, in Cantabria and the Basque Country.\n\nSurf: where to catch good waves\n\nSurfing is one of the most fun sports in the world and in Spain you can surf all year round, although if you are just starting out or want to get started we recommend the spring and summer months. Cantabria, the Canary Islands, the Basque Country and Cadiz are the most popular areas, with famous beaches such as Los Locos (Suances, Cantabria), Somo (Ribamontán al Mar, Cantabria), El Confital (Gran Canaria), El Quemao (Lanzarote), El Socorro (Tenerife), Mundaka (Basque Country) and La Yerbabuena (Cadiz).In all these destinations, you will find companies to rent you the necessary material and schools for learning how to surf while on holiday. Many also offer package holidays so you can enjoy an unforgettable holiday: surfing classes, along with yoga classes, experience glamorous camping or “glamping”, meditation classes or an outing to the city with a party included.\n\nSailing: where to go on a sailing trip\n\nThe Mediterranean coast is the perfect destination for a sailing trip and, more specifically, the Balearic Islands between the months of May and October. You will be met with turquoise waters, small coves hidden along the coast, a generally calm sea, sunsets with spectacular views and all kinds of leisure and entertainment services. For example, on the island of Ibiza you can find some of the most famous nightclubs in the country.The Costa Brava and Costa Dorada (in Catalonia), the Mediterranean coast of Andalusia, along with the Canary Islands are also popular destinations for days spent sailing. There are large boats to accommodate groups of more than 12 people (if you are travelling with a group of friends, for example).\n\nScuba diving: recommended dives\n\nClean seabeds, abundant biodiversity and diving areas close to the coast. You can find all of this and much more on your holiday in Spain. The seabeds of the Canary Islands are the most colourful and varied. Catalonia has some particularly interesting points, including the Formigues Islands, Cap de Creus and the Medas Islands. The Balearic Islands are known for their Posidonia oceanica seagrass meadows, which are a habitat for many species. You’ll even be able to spot sea turtles. Other recognised dive sites in the Mediterranean include Cabo de Gata – Níjar (Almería, in Andalusia), Cabo de Palos (Region of Murcia) and Columbretes, and the island of Tabarca (Region of Valencia).\n\nWindsurfing: where the best winds blow\n\nSpain is considered the Mecca of windsurfing in Europe. It has earned this reputation due to the strong winds that blow in the south of Cadiz. These are the Levante and Poniente winds, which make the Tarifa beaches the European capital of windsurfing. If you are keen on this sport, you should definitely head to the beaches of Bolonia, Dos Mares, Chica or Valdevaqueros. The Canary Island beaches are also frequented by professional and amateur windsurfers. The most well-known are Pozo Izquierdo (Gran Canaria), Jandía and Sotavento (Fuerteventura), Las Cucharas (Lanzarote) and El Médano (Tenerife). The Gulf of Roses, on the Costa Brava, areas such as La Llana and Los Alcázares in the Region of Murcia and the beaches of Ejido (Almería) or La Lanzada beach in Pontevedra are just some options to complete this list of essential windsurfing spots in Spain."
