        "text": "GUEST BERTHS: 28 RIG: Brigantine\n\nYou’ll be on board the last active, originally built brigantine in the Mediterranean and one of the last wooden windjammers that are still actively sailing. She operated as a cargo ship for almost 50 years including a world war (!) before she was discovered by a family in 1978 who have loving run her as a charter vessel returning her to an original condition.\n\nHer Captain and family live-aboard but they have their own separate quarters. Guests can enjoy private cabins in combinations of 2-3 berth bunks. All cabins share a total of four toilets and three showers with another shower on deck for a rinse off after some sea swimming.\n\nFor Atlantic crossings and Caribbean voyages only, under 30’s have the chance for a true authentic pirate experience to stay in a hammock! Each hammock will be allocated a seamans chest for any belongings and will strung up in the saloon between 9pm and 8am.\n\nBelow decks you’ll find a gorgeous saloon, bar and eating area with a traditional wooden finish. Above decks there is a large cushioned area for relaxation, sun-bathing or sleeping beneath the stars (bring your own sleeping bag if this is something you fancy!). An alfresco dining area sits mid-ships, perfect for lunches in the sun or dinners at sunset.\n\nAll her sails are set by hand and her construction is twice as strong as compared to a normal ship of her size. She is constructed with double oaked frames and up to 13 meters long, 14 cm thick ironwood planks (azobe). Her topsides are built in the finest mahogany. She was originally launched in winter of 1921 in Italy as a pure wooden sailing ship with no engine to serve as a cargo ship. She still runs cargo trips across the Atlantic today.\n\nFlorette maintains a full ocean classification for historical sail training and charter vessel. She actively sails 6-7 months in the Mediterranean and spent last winter crossing the Atlantic and sailing in the Caribbean.\n\nThe Crew “Haynes family”\n\nCaptain Ron Haynes grew up on the ship, moving onboard at only six days old. He learned everything from traditional seamanship, diving and engineering from his father. Since 1999, he took over the role as sole Captain making him second-generation sailing the Florette. He has participated in high profile races such as the Rolex Middle sea race and St. Barth’s bucket race. In his 22 years of being Captain, Ron has been involved in sail training, kayaking, dive charters, marine biology seminars (to name a few) and has taken over 10,000 people safely to sea. He is half Bavarian, half English and speaks fluent Italian.\n\nNicole Haynes, Ron’s wife, has sailed onboard since 1999. She served 7 years in the Canadian Navy training as Officer of the Watch and as a rescue diver. Onboard Florette, she runs the “ship” as mate and is known to be a fantastic cook.\n\nTheir daughters Jaden and Amber live full time onboard. They are “ship” schooled with a tutor through an online school in the UK. They have the luxury of family, a simple ship’s life and travel all rolled into one.\n\nThe crew is made up of qualified and very experienced seaman. We also have a private tutor aboard and take volunteers.\n\nLast but not least is the ship’s dog Lucy – a loveable Spanish water dog."
