        "text": "When European explorers first began sailing across the Atlantic Ocean, they were searching for new routes to China and the East, but what they found was more than they imagined: the New World.\n\nSome of these explorers, like Christopher Columbus, are both celebrated and vilified today. Others, like Ferdinand Magellan and Francisco Pizarro, were met with violent and untimely deaths. And some, like Marco Polo, failed to received recognition in their lifetime, only to have their discoveries confirmed centuries later.\n\nLearn more about some of the history’s most famous explorers and what they are remembered for today.\n\nMarco Polo\n\nTime Period: Late 13th century\n\nDestination: Asia\n\nMarco Polo travelled through Asia along the Silk Road between 1271 and 1295.\n\nMarco Polo was a Venetian explorer known for the book The Travels of Marco Polo, which describes his voyage to and experiences in Asia. Polo traveled extensively with his family, journeying from Europe to Asia from 1271 to 1295, remaining in China for 17 of those years. As the years wore on, Polo rose through the ranks, serving as governor of a Chinese city. Later, Kublai Khan appointed him as an official of the Privy Council. At one point, he was the tax inspector in the city of Yanzhou.\n\nAround 1292, he left China, acting as consort along the way to a Mongol princess who was being sent to Persia. In the centuries since his death, Polo has received the recognition that failed to come his way during his lifetime. So much of what he claimed to have seen has been verified by researchers, academics, and other explorers. Even if his accounts came from other travelers he met along the way, Polo’s story has inspired countless other adventurers to set off and see the world.\n\nMore about Marco Polo\n\nChristopher Columbus\n\nTime Period: Turn of the 16th century\n\nDestination: Caribbean and South America\n\nChristopher Columbus has been both praised as a gifted navigator and criticized as a reckless adventurer.\n\nChristopher Columbus was an Italian explorer and navigator. Columbus first went to sea as a teenager, participating in several trading voyages in the Mediterranean and Aegean seas. One such voyage, to the island of Khios, in modern-day Greece, brought him the closest he would ever come to Asia.\n\nIn 1492, he sailed across the Atlantic Ocean from Spain in the Santa Maria, with the Pinta and the Niña ships alongside, hoping to find a new route to India. Between that year and 1504, he made a total of four voyages to the Caribbean and South America and has been credited—and blamed—for opening up the Americas to European colonization. Columbus died in May 1506, probably from severe arthritis following an infection, still believing he had discovered a shorter route to Asia.\n\nMore about Christopher Columbus\n\nAmerigo Vespucci\n\nTime Period: Turn of the 16th century\n\nDestination: South America\n\nFlorentine navigator and explorer Amerigo Vespucci inspired the name of America.\n\nAmerica was named after Amerigo Vespucci, a Florentine navigator and explorer who played a prominent role in exploring the New World.\n\nOn May 10, 1497, Vespucci embarked on his first voyage, departing from Cadiz with a fleet of Spanish ships. In May 1499, sailing under the Spanish flag, Vespucci embarked on his next expedition, as a navigator under the command of Alonzo de Ojeda. Crossing the equator, they traveled to the coast of what is now Guyana, where it’s believed that Vespucci left Ojeda and went on to explore the coast of Brazil. During this journey, Vespucci is said to have discovered the Amazon River and Cape St. Augustine.\n\nOn his third and most successful voyage, he discovered present-day Rio de Janeiro and Rio de la Plata. Believing he had discovered a new continent, he called South America the New World. In 1507, America was named after him. He died of malaria in Seville, Spain, in February 1512.\n\nMore about Amerigo Vespucci\n\nJohn Cabot\n\nTime Period: Late 15th century\n\nDestination: Canada\n\nJohn Cabot made a British claim to land in Canada, mistaking it for Asia, during his 1497 voyage on the ship Matthew.\n\nJohn Cabot was a Venetian explorer and navigator known for his 1497 voyage to North America, where he made a British claim to land in Canada, mistaking it for Asia. The precise location of Cabot’s landing is subject to controversy. Some historians believe that Cabot landed at Cape Breton Island or mainland Nova Scotia. Others believe he might have landed at Newfoundland, Labrador, or even Maine.\n\nIn February 1498, Cabot was given permission to make a new voyage to North America. The May, he departed from Bristol, England, with five ships and a crew of 300 men. En route, one ship became disabled and sailed to Ireland, while the other four ships continued on. On the journey, Cabot disappeared, and his final days remain a mystery. It’s believed Cabot died sometime in 1499 or 1500, but his fate remains a mystery.\n\nMore about John Cabot\n\nFerdinand Magellan\n\nTime Period: Early 16th century\n\nDestination: Global circumnavigation\n\nPortuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan saw many countries on his attempt to circumnavigate the globe.\n\nWhile in the service of Spain, Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan led the first European voyage of discovery to circumnavigate the globe. As a boy, Magellan studied mapmaking and navigation. In 1505, when Magellan was in his mid-20s, he joined a Portuguese fleet that was sailing to East Africa. By 1509, he found himself at the Battle of Diu, in which the Portuguese destroyed Egyptian ships in the Arabian Sea. Two years later, he explored Malacca, located in present-day Malaysia, and participated in the conquest of Malacca’s port.\n\nIn 1519, with the support of Holy Roman Emperor Charles V (also known as Spain’s King Charles I), Magellan set out to find a better route to the Spice Islands. In March 1521, Magellan’s fleet reached Homonhom Island on the edge of the Philippines with less than 150 of the 270 men who started the expedition. Magellan traded with the island’s king Rajah Humabon, and their bond quickly formed. The Spanish crew soon became involved in a war between Humabon and another rival leader, and Magellan was killed in battle in April 1521.\n\nMore about Ferdinand Magellan\n\nHernán Cortés\n\nTime Period: 16th century\n\nDestination: Central America\n\nHernán Cortés was a Spanish conquistador who explored Central America and won Mexico for the crown of Spain.\n\nHernán Cortés was a Spanish conquistador who explored Central America, overthrew Montezuma and his vast Aztec empire, and won Mexico for the crown of Spain. He first set sail to the New World at the age of 19. Cortés later joined an expedition to Cuba.\n\nIn 1518, he set off to explore Mexico. Cortés became allies with some of the Indigenous peoples he encountered there, but with others, he used deadly force to conquer Mexico. He fought Tlaxacan and Cholula warriors and then set his sights on taking over the Aztec empire. In their bloody battles for domination over the Aztecs, Cortés and his men are estimated to have killed as many as 100,000 Indigenous peoples. In his role as the Spanish king, Emperor Charles V appointed him the governor of New Spain in 1522.\n\nMore about Hernán Cortés\n\nSir Francis Drake\n\nTime Period: Late 16th century\n\nDestination: Global circumnavigation\n\nEnglish admiral Sir Francis Drake circumnavigated the globe from 1577 to 1580.\n\nEnglish admiral Sir Francis Drake was the second person to circumnavigated the globe and was the most renowned seaman of the Elizabethan era. In 1577, Drake was chosen as the leader of an expedition intended to pass around South America, through the Strait of Magellan, and explore the coast that lay beyond. Drake successfully completed the journey and was knighted by Queen Elizabeth I upon his triumphant return in 1580.\n\nIn 1588, Drake saw action in the English defeat of the Spanish Armada, though he died in 1596 from dysentery after undertaking an unsuccessful raiding mission.\n\nMore about Francis Drake\n\nSir Walter Raleigh\n\nTime Period: Late 16th century\n\nDestination: United States\n\nSir Walter Raleigh was an English adventurer and writer who established a colony near Roanoke Island, in present-day North Carolina.\n\nSir Walter Raleigh was an English explorer, soldier, and writer. At age 17, he fought with the French Huguenots and later studied at Oxford. He became a favorite of Queen Elizabeth I after serving in her army in Ireland. He was knighted in 1585 and, within two years, became captain of the Queen’s Guard.\n\nAn early supporter of colonizing North America, Raleigh sought to establish a colony, but the queen initially forbade him to leave her service. Between 1585 to 1588, he invested in a number of expeditions across the Atlantic, attempting to establish a colony near Roanoke, on the coast of what is now North Carolina, and name it “Virginia” in honor of the virgin queen, Elizabeth. Accused of treason by King James I, Raleigh was imprisoned and eventually put to death.\n\nMore about Walter Raleigh\n\nJames Cook\n\nTime Period: Late 18th century\n\nDestination: New Zealand and Australia\n\nBritish navigator James Cook charted New Zealand and Australia’s Great Barrier Reef and later disproved the existence of the fabled southern continent Terra Australis.\n\nJames Cook was a naval captain, navigator, and explorer. After serving as an apprentice, Cook eventually joined the British Navy and, at age 29, was promoted to ship’s master. During the Seven Years War that began in 1756, he commanded a captured ship for the Royal Navy. Then, in 1768, he took command of the first scientific expedition to the Pacific.\n\nIn 1770, on his ship the HMB Endeavour, Cook charted New Zealand and the Great Barrier Reef of Australia. This area has since been credited as one of the world’s most dangerous areas to navigate. He later disproved the existence of Terra Australis, a fabled southern continent. Cook’s voyages helped guide generations of explorers and provided the first accurate map of the Pacific.\n\nMore about James Cook\n\nFrancisco Pizarro\n\nTime Period: Early 16th century\n\nDestination: Central and South America\n\nFrancisco Pizarro helped Vasco Núñez de Balboa discover the Pacific Ocean and, after conquering Peru, founded its capital city, Lima.\n\nIn 1513, Spanish explorer and conquistador Francisco Pizarro joined Vasco Núñez de Balboa in his march to the “South Sea,” across the Isthmus of Panama. During their journey, Balboa and Pizarro discovered what is now known as the Pacific Ocean, though Balboa allegedly spied it first and was therefore credited with the ocean’s first European discovery.\n\nIn 1528, Pizarro went back to Spain and managed to procure a commission from Emperor Charles V. Pizarro was to conquer the southern territory and establish a new Spanish province there. In 1532, accompanied by his brothers, Pizarro overthrew the Inca leader Atahualpa and conquered Peru. Three years later, he founded the new capital city of Lima. Over time, tensions increasingly built up between the conquistadors who had originally conquered Peru and those who arrived later to stake some claim in the new Spanish province. This conflict eventually led to Pizarro’s assassination in 1541."
