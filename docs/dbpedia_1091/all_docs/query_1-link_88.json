        "text": "470 World Championships - Barcelona In Port Race\n\nby Icarus Sailing Media 13 May 2012 11:36 BST\n\nThe 20 best international sailing crews made 2 exhibition races in the port of Barcelona. The World championship starts tomorrow, Sunday 13th, with 43 countries and 258 yachtsmen.\n\nThe World championship started today with 2 races in the city harbor, the Port Vell, in Barcelona where the 20 best crews of this class, male and female categories, gave it their all.\n\nWith this race, the Catalan Sailing Federation (Federación Catalana de Vela), organizer of the World championship together with the yacht clubs Real Club Náutico de Barcelona and the Real Club Marítim de Barcelona, aimed to approach sailing to the people.\n\nA lot of onlookers had gathered to watch the advanced skills of the 40 most outstanding athletes of the Class 470 that performed fast and elegant thanks to the windy and sunny weather.\n\nIn the male category, the winning crew was Spanish, Onan Barreiros and Aaron Sarmiento; while the winning female team was from Israel, Gil Cohen and Vered Buskila.\n\nTomorrow, starting at 12:00, the qualifying races will start for the 258 participating athletes (196 men and 108 women), from 43 countries.\n\nNames like the reigning female world champions like Tara Pacheco and Berta Betanzos, from Spain, the Japanese Ai Kondo and Wakako Tabata, bronze in the World championship in 2011 and current leaders of the ISAF (International Sailing Federation) ranking or the team composed by Lisa Westerhof and Lobke Berkhout, world champions both in 2009 and 2010 will maybe dominate the classification in the next few days.\n\nIn the male category, Onan Barreiros and Aaron Sarmiento will fight to achieve 1 of the 3 first places in the World championship, though they will be challenged by others like the current favorites Mat Belcher and Malcolm Page, considered one of the most successful 470 pairings of all time, already winning 5 world championships (2004, 2005, 2007, 2010 and 2011). The World championship that starts tomorrow will be spectacular and offer a glimpse of what the Olympic Games in London might bring in this Class."
