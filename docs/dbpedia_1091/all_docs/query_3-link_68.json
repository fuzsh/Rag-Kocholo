Get out of your comfort zone and let their sailor quotes serve as your greatest encouragement.\n\n“Now and then we had a hope that if we lived and were good, God would permit us to be Pirates.” – Mark Twain\n\n“Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn’t do than by the ones you did do.

However, they have lost their original meaning, so most of the time we are not aware that we are using the same phrases that were once used by sailors. We made a list of the most popular sailor phrases used in everyday language, explaining their metaphorical and original meaning.\n\nThe first example is the term feeling under the weather that people nowadays use to describe the feeling of sadness. Sailors would use this phrase when the weather was rough to warn the passengers to retreat to the lower levels of the boat to keep them safe from the storm.\n\nWe have all, not only once, experienced the calm before the storm. For example, we know that a really bad argument is always preceded by an extremely peaceful period. Sailors, on the other side, would use this phrase in anticipation of bad weather.\n\nPeople often find themselves at a loose end, meaning they do not know what to do next. When on board, something that is often loose is the rope. A loose end means that the rope is not attached properly.\n\nHave you ever gone overboard and completely exaggerated in your actions? Similar to that, when you go overboard on a boat, it means that you literally fall out of it.\n\nThe phrase fair winds and following seas is one of the most known sailor sayings. It means that the wind direction will be probably the same as the sea direction. It indicates that the sailors will probably have a “perfect day on the sea”. Furthermore, the phrase smooth sailing has a pretty similar meaning to the phrase fair winds and following seas. Smooth sailing means that there’ll be no problems further on, everything is alright now.\n\nThe phrase Anchors Aweigh means that there are no anchors in the sea at the moment, they are all clear of the sea bottom and the boat is ready for departure.\n\nSailor Slang – A Unique Way of Communication\n\nAnother interesting linguistic feature that emerged from the nautical world is sailor slang. Over the years spent on the sea, sailors have developed their own way of communicating. And that language was unknown to the ones who were not part of the crew. The phrases and nautical terms that they used were short and sweet, some of the examples are:\n\n“Aye Aye Captain!” – a sign of approval\n\n“Ahoy!” – sailors would use this exclamation among themselves to call out to each other\n\n“Land Ho!” – an exclamation that a sailor would make when they spotted the land\n\n“Matey” – mate, friend\n\n“Me” – referring to “my”\n\n“Ye” – referring to the pronoun “you”\n\n“Yo-ho-ho…and a bottle of rum!” – the first part refers to sailors’ laughter and the second one, well, we could say that rum was their favorite beverage.\n\nSailor slang was highly popularized by the eccentric Captain Jack Sparrow from the movie “Pirates of the Caribbean”. Jack Sparrow is an example of a real cap’n (captain) who loved his sailing ship Black Pearl more than his life and a man who gave his life to the sea. What a great example for a modern sailor, huh? Aside from his rum obsession and occasional cowardness, he was quite successful in his job. We are sure that you already quote him on a daily basis, but we will mention a few of his epic sailor quotes:\n\n“Why is the rum always gone?”\n\n“Hide the rum!”\n\n“Wherever we want to go, we go… that’s what a ship is, you know.”\n\n“The seas may be rough, but I am the Captain! No matter how difficult, I will always prevail.”\n\nConclusion\n\nAt the end of the day, you do not have to use sailing sayings and sailor quotes to be a sailor. Carleton Mitchell once said: “To desire nothing beyond what you have is surely happiness. Aboard a boat, it is frequently possible to achieve just that. That is why sailing is a way of life, one of the finest of lives.” Therefore, to be a successful sailor, the most important thing is to live without the fear of the unknown, to gather up the courage and start living your life to the fullest – at the sea."
