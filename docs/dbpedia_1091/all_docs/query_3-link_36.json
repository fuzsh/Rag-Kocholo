        "text": "And we’re talking ultimate bucket list experiences. It's important to note, though, that many famous explorers in history aren’t without their controversies due to the imperialist notion of Europeans “discovering” long-settled places. In the piece that follows we've included a few lesser-known voyagers among the more famous explorer names, along with trailblazers making history today.\n\nThis article is inspired by our Rough Guides guidebooks — your essential guides for travelling the world.\n\n1. Marco Polo (1254 -1324)\n\nFamed for his travels along the Silk Road, thirteenth-century Venetian Marco Polo is unquestionably one of the world’s most famous historical explorers.\n\nOne of the first European explorers to visit China, he left Venice in 1271 and crossed the Middle East with his family. They traversed Jerusalem, Afghanistan and the Gobi Desert for three years on their way to China. There they visited Kublai Khan, the Mongol emperor. Polo stayed in China for 17 years, and only around 1292 - after escorting a Mongol princess to Iran - did he make the return journey to Venice via Istanbul.\n\nIf you fancy following in Marco Polo’s fearless footsteps, you could explore our customisable tailor-made trips. Among them an exploration of some of Uzbekistan’s unique cultural highlights and inspirational itineraries around China. But fear not if you’re looking for closer to home adventures. You could always discover more about the man on a Venetian land and water tour that includes a visit to his birthplace.\n\n2. Abubakari II (c.1280 - c.1337)\n\nAbubakari II might not be one of the most famous explorer names, but some scholars argue that he deserves a prominent place alongside them. Thought to have been the ninth mansa (sultan or emperor) of West Africa’s Mali Empire, Abubakari II abdicated to undertake an exploratory ocean voyage.\n\nAccording to an account recorded by the Arab historian Ibn Fadlallah al-Umari or al-Umari, Abubakari II “did not believe that it was impossible to reach the extremity of the ocean.” So, “he equipped two hundred boats full of men, like many others full of gold, water and victuals sufficient enough for several years.” It’s said that Abubakari II didn’t return from this voyage, and a few scholars have posited the view that he travelled to the New World.\n\nHaving said that, the jury’s still out, with other academics arguing that there’s simply not enough evidence - for the time being at least. One thing’s for sure, on-going research and debates around Abubakari II are important reminders of the need to keep an open mind when it comes to understanding the past. New discoveries about famous historical explorers are always possible, much like the possibilities envisaged by explorers themselves.\n\n3. Christopher Columbus - undoubtedly one of the most famous world explorers (1451 -1506)\n\nUndoubtedly one of the most famous explorers in history, Christopher Columbus was born in Genoa in 1451. From a young age his impulse to travel was strong - he went to sea as a teenager and made Portugal his base. Having failed to secure royal patronage for his planned “enterprise of the Indies” (to reach Asia by sailing west), he went to Spain.\n\nAfter a time, he secured backing from King Ferdinand and Queen Isabella and on 3rd August 1492 he set sail across the Atlantic. Ten weeks later, land was sighted. But he was far from Asia. This land was, in fact, what later become known as the Bahamas.\n\nAfter landing on other islands around the Caribbean (devastating indigenous populations), Christopher Columbus returned to Spain. Having been made admiral of the Seven Seas and viceroy of the Indies, he undertook three further transatlantic voyages, never reaching the Asian lands he’d originally planned to find.\n\nWhen visiting the Caribbean, be sure to check out museums that uncover Christopher Columbus from the perspective of those whose lives he impacted. The Seville Great House heritage site in St Ann’s, Jamaica, for example, is home to an excellently curated history of the region. The exhibition covers the area and its peoples from the indigenous Taíno (who Columbus and his men abused and murdered in their thousands).\n\nAlternatively, if you’re in Genoa, you could take a guided tour of the city to see where Christopher Columbus was born and learn more about its history back in his day.\n\n4. Amerigo Vespucci (1454 -1512)\n\nFlorence-born Amerigo Vespucci is another name that comes to mind when thinking of world famous explorers.\n\nA merchant and navigator with a well-connected family (they counted the Medici’s among their friends), Vespucci relocated to Seville in 1492. Here he worked for Florentine merchant Gianotto Berardi, who invested huge sums of money in Columbus's first voyage. Berardi also won a potentially profitable contract to provision Columbus’s second fleet.\n\nAs for Vespucci’s discoveries, considering that the Americas are named after him, the documentation is surprisingly scant. What is certain is that during the late 1490s he undertook two voyages to the New World. While another two trips have been alleged, the letter-based evidence is patchier, and the documents’ authorship is debated.\n\nDuring these voyages he did, however, observe that the continent he was exploring was not part of Asia, as was believed at the time. He also explored the coast of modern-day Brazil, including areas of the Amazon and Para Rivers. Strong currents put paid to any plans they may have had to explore deeper.\n\nIn 1502, during Vespucci’s second voyage, his fleet found a bay that they named Rio de Janeiro after the date - 1st January.\n\nIf you fancy following in Vespucci’s footsteps in South America, check-out our customisable Brazilian trip itineraries for inspiration. Chances are, you’ll see more of this vast country than Vespucci did during his voyage.\n\nNot one to be deterred, Magellan found favour with Charles V in Spain and secured the funds for a five-ship voyage that set off in 1519. His Spanish crew weren’t best pleased to be taking orders from a Portuguese captain, to say the least. In fact, they mutinied in present-day Argentina.\n\nWith one ship destroyed, and another making its way back to Spain, Portuguese explorer dealt with the mutineers (some were beheaded) and gained control of his reduced fleet. After navigating the treacherous channel connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans he and his sickly crew made landfall on the Micronesian island of Guam. There a missing small boat prompted them to kill some of the island’s indigenous people.\n\nA month later, Magellan reached the Philippines. Since an enslaved crew member he’d bought before the voyage could speak the indigenous language, it seems this chap had circumnavigated the globe before Magellan. And Magellan didn’t make it the full way around either. After demanding that local people convert to Christianity, he was killed, leaving his crew to complete the round-the-world voyage without him.\n\n6. Charles Darwin (1809 -1882)\n\nCharles Darwin is undoubtedly one of the world’s most influential European famous explorers. In 1831, aged 22 and fresh out of Cambridge University, Darwin joined the crew of the HMS Beagle to survey the coast of South America.\n\nRebellion in Río de la Plata, fossils in Bahía Blanca, observations in the Andes and, of course, finches in the Galápagos turned his mind into “a chaos of delight”. Later it paved the way for one of the greatest theories in history: evolution.\n\nTen years later he set out, on what would be his final trip, to locate the source of the Nile. Uncontactable for several months, he was found by Henry Stanley, explorer and journalist, near Lake Tanganyika in 1871. It was here the famous phrase was coined: “Dr Livingstone I presume?”\n\nIf you want an unforgettable solo travel experience, perhaps our list of the best places to travel solo can help you decide on the best destination for you.\n\n8. Isabella Bird (1831 - 1904)\n\nWhen it comes to famous world explorers' names, Isabella Bird probably doesn’t immediately spring to mind. Yet this fearless Yorkshire woman definitely deserves to be reckoned among the world’s famous historical explorers.\n\nAfter a sickly childhood, her adventures began when her doctor advised that she take an overseas trip to improve her health. As a result, Isabella accompanied her cousins to America, on instruction from her clergyman father that she could remain away for as long as her £100 allowance lasted.\n\nThe letters Bird wrote home during this trip become the basis of her first book, “An Englishwomen in America”. Following the deaths of her parents, she continued to travel and write to support herself. Her most notable exploration are Hawaii, as described in her second book, “Six Months in the Sandwich Islands”, as they were then known.\n\nBird later rode 800 miles through the Rocky Mountains (as desrcibed in “A Lady’s Life in the Rocky Mountains”) and explored Asia (as recounted in “Unbeaten tracks in Japan”). She also studied medicine so she could travel as a missionary, and studied photography so she could document her travels.\n\nEternally defying the conventions of her day, she travelled to India at the age of 60. She later explored China and Korea, with her last book, “The Yangtze Valley and Beyond”, published in 1900.\n\n9. Nellie Bly (1864 - 1922)\n\nIn 1888, at the age of 25, Nellie Bly set off to travel the world in 80 days, just like Jules Verne’s Phileas Fogg. Her trip took her from New York to London. Then onwards from Calais in France to Brindisi in Italy, Port Said in Egypt, Colombo in Sri Lanka, Penang in Malaysia, Hong Kong, San Francisco and finally back to New York City.\n\nBly actually completed the journey in 72 days, winning a bet struck with Verne himself. Of this achievement, she declared: “It's not so very much for a woman to do who has the pluck, energy and independence, which characterize many women in this day of push and get-there.\"\n\nNot only a trail-blazing, record-breaking traveller, Nellie Bly was also a pioneering investigative journalist. She reported on everything from the lives of impoverished working girls in Pittsburgh, to corruption and poor living conditions in Mexico. She also investigated the living conditions and treatment of patients in a New York insane asylum, even faking her own illness in order to be admitted to the asylum.\n\nAll that considered, Bly certainly merits a place at the table of famous explorers. And, while it goes without saying that she's a pretty impossible act to follow, if you fancy embarking on an epic solo voyage (or several) of your own, you might want to check out our list of tips for doing exactly that.\n\n10. Freya Stark (1893 - 1993)\n\nBorn in Paris to bohemian parents - a British father and Italian mother - Freya Stark studied Persian and Arabic at the University of London.\n\nAt the age of 30 she began her lifelong immersion in the Middle East some four years later when she caught a cargo ship to Beirut. This pivotal trip saw Stark travel widely through Syria in secret (at this time it was under French control). This trip paved the way for a future as one of the most esteemed, knowledgable and famous explorers of the Middle East.\n\nIn the coming years Stark trekked into western Iran’s wilderness, areas of which had never been visited by Westerners. In 1934 she voyaged down the Red Sea with the aim of reaching the ancient city of Shabwa, thought to have been the Queen of Sheba’s capital. Though illness curtailed this particular journey, Stark’s exploration of this region resulted in a clutch of seminal books. Later she was awarded with the Royal Geographical Society’s Founder's Gold Medal.\n\nDuring WWII Stark worked for the British Ministry of Information in Yemen and Cairo, and later travelled extensively through Turkey. She made her last expedition in 1968 (a trip to Afghanistan at the age of 75), though she continued to travel well into her eighties.\n\n11. Matthew Henson (1866 –1955)\n\nAs the first person to reach the top of the world, there’s no doubt that intrepid African-American Matthew Henson should be recognised as one of the world’s most famous historical explorers.\n\nBorn in Maryland, where his parents were subjected to attacks from the Ku Klux Klan, Henson was orphaned as a child and set sail as a cabin boy at the tender age of twelve. Under the tutelage of the ship’s Captain Childs, Henson was educated and became an accomplished sailor. He voyaged China, Japan, Africa, and the Russian Arctic seas.\n\nWhen Childs died, Henson though his seafaring days were over until he met Robert Peary, a US Naval officer and explorer.\n\nPeary took Henson on to assist his next assignment - mapping the jungles of Nicaragua. During this trip, the men formed a lifelong bond. Henson went on to play a pivotal role in Peary’s exploration of the Arctic. He mastered the Inuit language and learned skills that were essential for their survival during their expedition to the North Pole in 1908-09 (Peary’s eighth attempt).\n\nPeary was lauded as the first man to reach the North Pole. However, Henson’s account of the final push of this attempt, as recounted in his 1921 memoir “A Negro Explorer at the North Pole”, describes otherwise. Henson rode in the lead sledge, his footprints were first to make their mark at the North Pole, and it was Henson who planted the American flag.\n\nIn 1937 the inaccuracy of Peary being deemed the first man to make it to the North Pole was rectified when Henson was made an honorary member of the prestigious Explorers Club of New York. Then in 1946 the US Navy awarded him the same medal they’d issued to Peary. Henson was also later honoured by Presidents Truman and Eisenhower.\n\n12. Jacques Cousteau (1910 -1997)\n\nIn the field of underwater expeditions, famous historical explorers don’t come more well-known than Jacques Cousteau - the researcher, photographer, filmmaker and marine conservationist who co-invented the Aqua-Lung.\n\nCousteau’s early career in naval aviation was cut short by a car accident, and led to him following his love for the ocean. In the mid-to-late 1930s he worked for the French Navy’s information service, which saw him sent on missions to Shanghai and Japan.\n\nAs recounted in Traversa, Sandham’s boundlessly engaging account of his epic journey, he modelled his route on the Victorian-era \"traversas\" journeyed by the likes of Henry Morton Stanley and Dr David Livingstone.\n\nSandham's journey took almost a year. During the journey he was stricken with malaria, and the threat of lions and mines never left his mind. All this demonstrates the human impulse to set out and do things his own way. Traversa suffused in a spirit of joie de vivre, albeit brilliantly tempered by the author's endearing self-deprecating wit.\n\n15. Mario Rigby (1985 - present)\n\nModern-day adventurer Mario Rigby is surely set to become one of the world's most famous explorers. Born in Turks and Caicos, Rigby grew up in Germany and Canada, where a talent for athletics saw him pursuing a career as a personal trainer. It was an athletics competition in San Salvador that first inspired Rigby’s desire to explore more of the world, and ultimately led to his Crossing Africa expedition.\n\nIf you are inspired by Mario Rigbys adventures check our list of the world's best backpacking destinations.\n\nIn November 2015 Rigby left Toronto for Cape Town from where his incredible adventure began. An astounding 12,000 km trek north through eight African countries by foot and kayak that saw him reach Cairo in 2018. Contracting malaria, and dodging bullets and wild dogs along the way, Rigby was driven to learn from the people he met along the way. He also committed to share their stories with authentic, respectful realism.\n\nAlso a powerful, inspirational advocate for eco-conscious travel, Rigby’s continued adventures help support a number of charities. Among them are the Rainmaker Enterprise in Sudan and Toronto-based My Stand, a mentoring scheme for vulnerable young people.\n\nIf you prefer to plan and book your trips without any effort and hassle, use the expertise of our local travel experts to make sure your trip will be just like you dream it to be.\n\nTo find more inspiration for your future journeys check our Rough Guides guidebooks and find out all the information you need about your dream destination.\n\nWe may earn commission when you click on links in this article, but this doesn’t influence our editorial standards.
