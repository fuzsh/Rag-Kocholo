        "text": "Before trains, planes, or automobiles, boating was the way to get where you wanted to go. Sailing was the sole method for transporting goods and supplies around the world.Â\n\nDuring wartime, ships were also an integral part of strategy and tactics. As you can guess, that means there were quite a lot of ships on the water â but out of all those, some stand out as particularly significant.Â\n\nKeep reading to learn about ten of the most famous ships in history. We'll also mention how you canÂ stay safeÂ whether you're on a big, famous ship or your own personal vessel!\n\n1. The Santa Maria\n\n\"In fourteen hundred ninety-two, Columbus sailed the ocean blue...\"\n\nThe Santa Maria, a clumsy, complicated vessel, famously transported Christopher Columbus from Spain to the \"New World\" in 1492. That same year, the ship ran aground on Christmas Day â but not all was lost.Â\n\nAnother ship, the Navidad, was built with its salvaged wood.\n\n2. H.L. Hunley\n\nThe Confederate Army built theÂ H.L. Hunley submarineÂ during the American Civil War to sink Union Navy ships.Â\n\nIronically, it sank twice in the testing process, killing a dozen people (including its designer, Horace L. Hunley). Eventually, the submarine did manage to launch a torpedo, sinking the Housatonic and becoming the first combat submarine to sink a ship.Â\n\nAfterward, the submarine unfortunately sank itself for a third and final time.\n\n3. The Mayflower\n\nIn 1620,Â the Mayflower transportedÂ English Separatists and Puritans, known today as Pilgrims, to the \"New World.\"Â\n\nThe Pilgrims lived on the Mayflower for a few months, but eventually, the ship made its way back to England. The Pilgrims, of course, stayed behind, establishing the first British colonies in America.\n\n4. The USS Constitution\n\nThe USS ConstitutionÂ holds the title of the longest-serving warship in history, retiring from service at 85 years old in 1882.Â\n\nIn its time, the ship struck fear in the hearts of the British Royal Navy and gained quite the reputation as \"Old Ironsides.\" Even today, the ship is still intact and serves as a museum in Boston, where it takes museumgoers on a short annual cruise.\n\n5. The BattleshipÂ USS Arizona\n\nIn 1941, theÂ USS ArizonaÂ was destroyed by the Japanese in the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. The attack killed 1,177 crew members, including the captain, and engulfed the ship in flames that burned for days.Â\n\nThe ship could not be salvaged but remains in Pearl Harbor as a war memorial.\n\n6. The Battleship USS Missouri\n\nThe surrender documentsÂ that announced the end of World War II were signed on theÂ USS Missouri, aka \"Mighty Mo,\" in September 1945.Â\n\nIf that wasn't enough to warrant a spot on our list, the ship was also used again in 1991 duringÂ Operation Desert Storm.\n\n7. The HMS Victory\n\nThe HMS Victory, used by the British Royal Navy during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, is the world's oldest commissioned warship.Â\n\nCurrently, it serves as the Flagship of the First Sea Lord and is also a \"living\" museum in England.\n\n8. The Battleship USS Maine\n\nIn 1898, aÂ mysterious explosionÂ ripped the USS Maine in two while it was anchored in Havana, Cuba, killing most of its crew.Â\n\nTo this day, no one knows the cause of the explosion. However, at the time, it was suspected to be an act of sabotage, which sparked a short war between the U.S. and Spain.\n\n9. The German Battleship Bismarck\n\nThe massive Bismarck, known as the most hunted ship in history, took several hits from the British Navy in 1941 before itÂ finallyÂ sank.Â\n\nIt remained at the bottom of the sea until 1989 when Robert Ballard (the same man who had found the Titanic) located it.\n\n10. The British Luxury Liner RMS Titanic\n\nIn its time, theÂ TitanicÂ was known as the largest ship on the sea. Considered \"unsinkable,\" the large luxury ship went down two hours after sideswiping an iceberg.Â\n\nBecause of a lack of lifeboats, more than 1,500 people died in the tragedy. Robert Ballard discovered the ship's wreckage in 1985 and went on to inspire one of the highest-grossing films of all time.\n\nStay Safe on Any Ship In History\n\nWhat do you think of this list? While plenty of famous ships are out there, we feel this is a pretty good list of top contenders.Â\n\nNo matter what type of boat you prefer â big or small, famous or not â we hope you stay safe on the water this season. The best way to do that is to take a boater education course to get safety certified before hitting the water.Â\n\nBoat-Ed offers state-approved online courses toÂ prepare boaters for operating any boat.Â You'll learn how to navigate the waters, crucial safety equipment to have on board, why you should have a float plan, and what to do if something goes wrong.Â\n\nEnjoy more safe seasons on the water!Â Find the course for your stateÂ and start learning.Â\n\nÂ\n\nOriginally published May 22, 2015.
