        "text": "James Lind is remembered as the man who helped to conquer a killer disease. His reported experiment on board a naval ship in 1747 showed that oranges and lemons were a cure for scurvy. But why did the Royal Navy, which celebrates the tercentenary of Lind's birth on 4 October 2016, take nearly half a century to act on his findings?\n\nFor 18th Century sailors, disease during long sea voyages was often more dangerous than enemy action.\n\nOne British expedition to raid Spanish holdings in the Pacific Ocean in the 1740s lost 1,300 of an original complement of 2,000 men to illness.\n\nThe commander, George Anson, said \"almost the whole crew\" was afflicted by symptoms including a \"luxuriancy of funguous flesh... putrid gums and... the most dreadful terrors\".\n\nMany sailors suffered \"a strange dejection of the spirits\" and lay immobile, while others who \"resolved to get out of their hammocks, have died before they could well reach the deck\".\n\nFrequent outbreaks of disease tormented crews and various cures were championed.\n\nThe explorer Captain Cook recommended malt and sauerkraut, while others swore by \"elixir of vitriol\" (a dilute solution of sulphuric acid), blood-letting and applying a piece of turf to the patient's mouth to counter the \"bad qualities of the sea-air\".\n\nAmong the array of imaginative remedies were some that proved effective.\n\nSailors who ate the ship's rats were inadvertently protecting themselves - as the animal synthesizes its own vitamin C.\n\nCitrus fruit - another source of vitamin C - had already been suggested as a cure by some.\n\nThe explorer Sir Richard Hawkins recorded in 1622 that \"sower lemons and oranges\" were \"most fruitful... I wish that some learned man would write of it\".\n\nMore than a century later, a learned man fulfilled that wish, with a text which earned him a place in scientific history.\n\nJames Lind was the son of an Edinburgh merchant and became a medical apprentice in the city before joining the Royal Navy as a surgeon's mate in the late 1730s.\n\nHis service allowed him to observe the effects of scurvy at first hand.\n\nIn 1747, on board HMS Salisbury, he carried out one of the first controlled clinical trials recorded in medical science.\n\nHe took 12 men suffering from similar symptoms of scurvy, divided them into six pairs and treated them with remedies suggested by previous writers:\n\nDr Lind's \"Treatise of the Scurvy\", containing a celebrated review of literature on the disease, appeared in 1753, by which time he was a practising physician in Edinburgh.\n\nHe prided himself that he had conquered a condition which \"during the last war, proved a more destructive enemy, and cut off more valuable lives, than the united efforts of the French and Spanish arms\".\n\nBut it was not until 42 years later that the Admiralty first issued an order for the distribution of lemon juice to sailors. Historians still debate why it did not act upon Dr Lind's discovery earlier.\n\nYet, despite the Navy's efforts, outbreaks of scurvy continued to affect seafarers.\n\nMs Wickenden said: \"They didn't appreciate that the power of lemons to counteract scurvy deteriorated with storage and also with some of the preservation methods used, like boiling the juice, which destroys the vitamin C.\"\n\nDr Lind's suggestion that the power of lemons lay in their acidity led the Admiralty to try cheaper limes from a new British plantation in the Caribbean in the 1860s.\n\nThe fruit, containing about half the vitamin C content of lemons, was less effective in preventing scurvy among British sailors, or 'Limeys' as they became known.\n\nNot until vitamin C was identified in 1928 was the disease effectively conquered at source.\n\nHowever, in the Royal Navy, Dr Lind is remembered as a hero.\n\nMs Wickenden said: \"Lind conducted what is largely regarded as the first clinical trial and is seen as the father of naval medicine.\"\n\nA lemon tree now adorns the official crest of the Institute of Naval Medicine, which is based near the former Royal Hospital Haslar where he worked."
