        "text": "That desire to see more of what the world has to offer is at the core of what has motivated famous travelers from the past to the present. Many of these famous explorers faced formidable challenges and obstacles in their quest for discovery, demonstrating remarkable courage, resilience, and determination.\n\nHere are nine famous explorers who have changed the world of travel through their expeditions to South America, Central America, South Asia, the Middle East, and beyond.\n\nFamous travelers throughout history:\n\nXuanzang (Hsüan-tsang) (602 – 664)\n\nMarco Polo (1254 – 1324)\n\nIbn Battuta (1304 – 1369)\n\nFerdinand Magellan (1480 – 1521)\n\nSacagawea (1788 – 1812?)\n\nNellie Bly (1864 – 1922)\n\nMatthew Henson (1866 – 1955)\n\nJacques Cousteau (1910 – 1997)\n\nWasfia Nazreen (1982 – Present)\n\nThese famous explorers are just a few of the individuals who have helped bring the world closer together, teaching us valuable lessons about previously unseen worlds. Today, many modern explorers share their journeys online, inspiring countless individuals to embark on their own journeys of exploration and discovery.\n\nYou too can become a travel writer and document your experiences, following in the footsteps of these famous explorers. Explore our programs to get started on your own journey!\n\n1. Xuanzang (Hsüan-tsang) (602 – 664)\n\n2. Marco Polo (1254 – 1324)\n\nDuring his journeys, he endured many hardships traveling across unforgiving territory, but he also learned about an entirely different way of living from his own and mastered four languages. He brought back to Europe the idea of paper money and a postal system, among other concepts.\n\nHis book The Travels of Marco Polo would later inspire other explorers. Two centuries later Christopher Columbus carried a copy of Marco Polo’s book as he sailed across the Atlantic.\n\n3. Ibn Battuta (1304 – 1369)\n\n4. Ferdinand Magellan (1480 – 1521)\n\n5. Sacagawea (1788 – 1812?)\n\nShe was only about 17 years old and had given birth just a few months before she set out on the journey across thousands of wilderness miles. She helped during crucial moments on the expedition – finding edible plants, suggesting the best route to travel, and fostering conversation with some Shoshones, who happened to be led by Sacagawea’s brother Cameahwait. With their help, Lewis and Clark got horses and a guide to cross the Rocky Mountains. In return, Clark provided Sacagawea’s son an education.\n\nTo this day, it is still debated when she died. Most historians suggest Sacagawea died young – at age 24. However, some oral traditions say she left her husband to join another Indian tribe and lived to an old age.\n\n6. Nellie Bly (1864 – 1922)\n\n7. Matthew Henson (1866 – 1955)\n\nEventually he met Peary, who was a U.S. Naval officer who hired Henson. They spent 18 years on expeditions together, exploring places ranging from the jungles of Nicaragua to the frozen landscape of the Arctic. It wasn’t until Henson was 70 though that he received the acknowledgement he deserved for his accomplishments as an explorer. Towards the end of his life, both Presidents Truman and Eisenhower honored Henson before he died.\n\n8. Jacques Cousteau (1910 – 1997)\n\nFor years afterward he joined with partners to explore the seas for scientific research and diving expeditions. Cousteau explored the diverse marine environments in the Indian Ocean, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico in the Atlantic Ocean, and various parts of the Pacific Ocean, including Polynesia and the Great Barrier Reef.\n\nEventually he created a nonprofit called The Cousteau Society. The organization has played a major global role in creating awareness about the effects of pollution and coastal development, while also generating an interest in many forms of sea life. Today Costeau is now recognized as the father of underwater exploration.\n\n9. Wasfia Nazreen (1982 – Present)\n\nYou may have never heard of Nazreen, but she is well known to millions of Bangladeshi people. She is the first person from Bangladesh to climb the so-called “Seven Summits” – which are the seven highest mountains on the seven continents. She also has worked endlessly to raise awareness about animal rights, environmental issues, and women’s rights.\n\nNazreen launched her summit bid to mark 40 years of progress in women’s rights in the patriarchal society where she was raised. Her mountain climbs were particularly notable since girls have traditionally been discouraged from doing outdoor activities in Bangladesh. Plus, the country’s terrain is pretty flat and often is flooded during typhoons.\n\nNazreen has said these natural disasters taught her to have an extreme respect for nature since it’s the “real boss.” The floods also have fostered her ongoing desire to promote environmental responsibility.\n\nHer inspirational life led her to be named the National Geographic Adventurer of the Year in 2014. She also was featured in the 2016 short documentary Wasfia.\n\nThese travelers are just a few of the individuals who have helped bring the world closer together and taught us many lessons about unseen worlds. Each day more explorers are sharing their journeys online to promote the joy of travel. Joining in the adventure is easy. View our programs to get started!"
