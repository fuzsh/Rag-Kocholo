You’ll have the opportunity to discover hidden gems, from secluded beaches to charming coastal towns, all while enjoying the comfort and luxury of your chosen vessel. Spain’s Atlantic coast is not just about breathtaking scenery; it’s also a culinary delight. The seafood and shellfish in this region are among the finest in the world!\n\nSailing Spain’s Atlantic coast allows you to experience the region’s natural beauty, cultural richness, and culinary delights in a way that no other form of travel can match. From the historic streets of La Coruña to the pristine beaches of the Iles Cies, and the vibrant culture of the Rias Baixas region, a sailing holiday is the ultimate way to discover the best that Spain’s Atlantic coast has to offer.\n\nLa Coruña\n\nStart your adventure sailing Spain in La Coruña, a coastal city in Galicia boasting a rich history intertwined with its fishing and trading port. The historic part of town, situated on a peninsula, features a fascinating Romanesque road network filled with charming squares and medieval churches. A must-see landmark is the Hercules Tower, the oldest functioning lighthouse in the world. Art enthusiasts will appreciate the Museum of Fine Arts, which houses works by Goya and other notable artists.\n\nWhile in La Coruña, don’t miss the chance to visit the San Carlos Garden. Here you’ll find a serene retreat with beautiful views of the ocean and the city. La Coruña’s vibrant culinary scene is another highlight, with numerous seafood restaurants offering fresh catches of the day.\n\nRias Baixas\n\nAs you sail south from La Coruña you’ll head towards the enchanting Rias Baixas region of Spain, a hidden gem, home to stunning natural beauty and a vibrant culture. This area consists of four main inlets with small island clusters dotting the estuaries and bays. The white sandy beaches, fringed with granite boulders, are reminiscent of the Outer Hebrides but with warmer waters. The entire region is a designated National Park, making it a perfect spot for anchoring under star-lit skies. After a morning of sailing, explore the islands’ trails and discover hidden coves and picturesque landscapes.\n\nIn the Rias Baixas, the town of Cambados is known as the capital of Albariño wine, and visiting its wineries for tastings is a delightful experience. The picturesque village of Combarro is another highlight, famous for its traditional hórreos (granaries) and charming waterfront. For history buffs, the Castle of Soutomaior, nestled in the hills, offers stunning views and a glimpse into the region’s medieval past. Read more about the Rias Baixas region of Spain in our in-depth travel guide here.\n\nIles Cies\n\nWithin the Rias Baixas region lie the charming Iles Cies. The Iles Cies are often referred to as the “Galician Caribbean” due to their unspoiled beauty and pristine beaches, such as Playa de Rodas, which has been ranked among the best beaches in the world.\n\nThe islands are also a haven for nature lovers, with a rich diversity of flora and fauna. Additionally, the underwater ecosystem is equally impressive, making the area popular for snorkelling and diving. On land, the islands are crisscrossed with well-marked trails, including routes up to Mount Faro where you can explore ancient Roman ruins and take in sweeping ocean views.\n\nVigo\n\nVigo, the largest city in Galicia, is a vibrant blend of tradition and modernity. Its old town, Casco Vello, is a charming area with narrow, winding streets lined with historic buildings, traditional tapas bars, and local shops. The heart of this district is the Plaza de la Constitución, a lively square perfect for enjoying a coffee or a glass of wine while soaking up the local atmosphere. Vigo is also home to the bustling Mercado da Pedra, where visitors can sample fresh oysters and other seafood delicacies straight from the market stalls.\n\nFor a taste of Vigo’s maritime heritage, visit the Museo do Mar de Galicia, which explores the city’s long-standing connection with the sea. The city’s modern side is evident in the contemporary art museum, MARCO, which hosts rotating exhibitions of modern art. The waterfront promenade, with its beautiful views of the harbor and numerous seafood restaurants, is ideal for a leisurely stroll. With its dynamic blend of history, culture, and natural beauty, Vigo is certainly a must-visit destination on Spain’s Atlantic coast.\n\nSailing Spain’s Atlantic coastline\n\nFrom the historic streets and landmarks of La Coruña to the vibrant cultural life of Vigo and the pristine beaches of the Iles Cies, each stop along the way provides a unique glimpse into the region’s rich heritage and stunning landscapes. A sailing holiday not only allows you to discover hidden gems and enjoy the diverse scenery but also immerses you in the local culture and culinary delights.
