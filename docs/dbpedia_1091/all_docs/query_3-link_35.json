        "text": "Rías Baixas, Galicia (Pontevedra)\n\nIf you feel like sailing through calm waters, the Arousa, Pontevedra and Vigo estuaries may be what you are looking for. Its waters are protected by the Cíes Islands, part of the Islas Atlánticas de Galicia National Park and a must for people who love being surrounded by marine nature. Its island of Monteagudo houses the largest beach in the Cíes: Rodas beach, a truly beautiful landscape. But if you want to anchor on any of its three islands, you must first request an anchoring permit.\n\nCosta Brava, Girona\n\nThe Costa Brava invites you to enjoy the warmth of the Mediterranean Sea along more than 200 kilometers of coastline full of impressive coves: some are hiding their own natural caves (for example, Cala Pola) while others can only be reached from the sea (Pedrosa, La Foradada and Ferriol), which allow visitors to view Montgrí Natural Park, the Medes Islands and the Baix Ter from another perspective. You can also anchor in Culip Cove, a lonely place where it is said that old sunken ships lie.\n\nGarraf Coast, Barcelona\n\nTake in towns like Sitges, Cubelles, Vilanova i la Geltrú and Sant Pere de Ribes during your boat trip along this coast. You will also come across the Garraf massif, which descends into the sea.\n\nCosta Blanca, Alicante\n\nThe Alicante coast offers excellent conditions for sailing; what's more, most of its beaches come with the blue flag guarantee (the blue flag certificate is issued by the European Foundation for Environmental Education that guarantees the quality of the beaches and ports awarded this recognition). In its waters you can discover a large number of coves (in many of them you can anchor), natural corners such as the Serra Gelada Natural Park or such pleasant surprises as the natural pool on the island of Portixol.\n\nCosta Calida, Murcia\n\nIf you are travelling with children, the Costa Cálida boasts areas of calm waters and family beaches such as those in La Manga and Cala Cortina. What's more, you can enjoy fishing villages from your boat or head ashore to sample some of the region's typical dishes.\n\nCosta Tropical, Granada\n\nThe Costa Tropical spans the coast of Granada, including towns such as Motril, Salobreña, Almuñécar and La Herradura. One of the most famous navigation routes on this coast begins in the bay of La Herradura until reaching the cliffs of Maro-Cerro Gordo, in Malaga. On the way you will pass through virgin coves such as Cala de la Rijana (near Motril), a beach with dark sand and turquoise waters that has its own watchtower.\n\nCosta del Sol, Malaga\n\nPlaya de Cantarriján represents the natural border between the Malaga and Granada coasts. Your trip doesn't have to end here, as the wonders of the Costa del Sol still await you! Playa de Maro is a Spanish favourite. And do you know its neighbor Caleta de Maro?\n\nPitiusas Islands, Balearic Islands\n\nIbiza and Formentera are the well-known Pitiusas Islands, one of the most charming spots in Spain for any sailor, especially if you set sail between April and October. These islands' heavenly beaches boasting crystal-clear waters and golden sand include Platja s'Alga (on Espalmador, an islet to the north of Formentera), Ses Illetes (Formentera) and Cala Salada (Ibiza).\n\nTenerife, Canary Islands\n\nIf you are passionate about sailing, Tenerife is your ideal destination! One of the reasons that make sailing in the Canary Islands so popular are the prevailing trade winds and the wind channels between islands. In addition, it is possible to spot cetaceans such as pilot whales and dolphins in the Los Gigantes area, although it is extremely important not to approach the animals since there are national and international laws that protect them."
