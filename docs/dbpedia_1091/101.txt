OnÃ¡n BARREIROS / AarÃ³n SARMIENTO (ESP 9), 470

Our relationship with Onan Barreiros dates back to 2002 when, teaming with another helm, JosÃ© Antonio Medina, they were seeking support to meet the 2003 season in 420 Class. Our collaboration with them could not be more fruitful:

-420 Class Kiel Week winners 2003,

-420 Class Spanish Sub-Champions 2003.

In 2004, both helms looked for new crew facing 470 class. Since then, Onan, with Aaron Sarmiento at trapeze, has entrusted us the preparation of his 470.

Hand in hand with his coach Jorge Angulo, our work with Onan and Aaron is aimed at preparing and fine tuning their boat for the 2012 London Olympics with the Spanish Olympic 470 Team.
