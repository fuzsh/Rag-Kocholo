SA’s Olympic sailors Asenathi Jim and Roger Hudson claimed their first ever race win at a 470 World Championships to shoot to the top of the overall standings at the halfway mark in Argentina on Wednesday.

The pair, sailing in a new boat and up against many of the top international teams they’ll face at the Rio Olympics later this year, now share the lead with Spain’s Onán Barreiros and Juan Curbelo after some tactical brilliance saw the South Africans winning race five.

There are five races still to come this week before the top teams out of 42 crews head into the double- points medal race on Saturday.

‘It is a great feeling to actually have a race win at a World Championships, really amazing,’ Jim told World Sailing. ‘We seem to have a bit of pace but you know it was really tough to make any good moves in the fleet, because the wind was all over the show. It was interesting, as we bailed out of situations when we were deep.’

Hudson added: ‘It’s really complicated conditions, really tricky and very chaotic as well, so you have to keep looking for the next opportunity and stay alive.

‘As Asenathi said, a couple of times we were in trouble and we managed to find our way back into the race in both cases. We are very happy and quite frankly we would have been happy with second in that race, because we are just trying to get good scores on the board. In this place, a good score is most probably anything inside the top 15.

‘We have quite a bit to go before the weekend. We are just trying to keep going one race at a time and hope to be here on Saturday to contest the medal race. That would be a dream.’

Racing continues in San Isidro, Buenos Aires on Thursday.
