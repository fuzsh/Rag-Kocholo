As you sail south from La Coruña you’ll head towards the enchanting Rias Baixas region of Spain, a hidden gem, home to stunning natural beauty and a vibrant culture. This area consists of four main inlets with small island clusters dotting the estuaries and bays. The white sandy beaches, fringed with granite boulders, are reminiscent of the Outer Hebrides but with warmer waters. The entire region is a designated National Park, making it a perfect spot for anchoring under star-lit skies. After a morning of sailing, explore the islands’ trails and discover hidden coves and picturesque landscapes.

In the Rias Baixas, the town of Cambados is known as the capital of Albariño wine, and visiting its wineries for tastings is a delightful experience. The picturesque village of Combarro is another highlight, famous for its traditional hórreos (granaries) and charming waterfront. For history buffs, the Castle of Soutomaior, nestled in the hills, offers stunning views and a glimpse into the region’s medieval past.

The islands are also a haven for nature lovers, with a rich diversity of flora and fauna. Additionally, the underwater ecosystem is equally impressive, making the area popular for snorkelling and diving. On land, the islands are crisscrossed with well-marked trails, including routes up to Mount Faro where you can explore ancient Roman ruins and take in sweeping ocean views.

Vigo

Vigo, the largest city in Galicia, is a vibrant blend of tradition and modernity. Its old town, Casco Vello, is a charming area with narrow, winding streets lined with historic buildings, traditional tapas bars, and local shops. The heart of this district is the Plaza de la Constitución, a lively square perfect for enjoying a coffee or a glass of wine while soaking up the local atmosphere. Vigo is also home to the bustling Mercado da Pedra, where visitors can sample fresh oysters and other seafood delicacies straight from the market stalls.

For a taste of Vigo’s maritime heritage, visit the Museo do Mar de Galicia, which explores the city’s long-standing connection with the sea.
