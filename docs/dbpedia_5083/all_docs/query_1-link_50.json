        "text": "“All Dirt Roads Taste of Salt”\n\nDir: Raven Jackson, DoP: Jomo Fray\n\nFormat: 35mm\n\nCamera: ARRICAM LT\n\nLens: ARRI Master Primes\n\nFray: We wanted to create an image that was deeply tactile and elemental in its design. Before I even read the script the director, Raven Jackson, told me she was dreaming of this film in 35mm. In a way, shooting on film for us embodied a holistic approach to the work. It gave us the tactile feel and texture we were looking for but also forced us to have a certain level of intention with each image we created. We crafted an artistic manifesto for the film that we read at the start of each day together. We wanted the light and camera to feel naturalistic and paired down to its most elemental component parts — and we wanted our tools to reflect those values. Shooting on the Arricam LT with the Master Primes gave us the ability to be nimble and quickly adapt to changing conditions. I love the way the Master Primes render on film. They have a soft naturalism that immediately drew us both in.\n\n“Anatomy of a Fall”\n\nDir: Justine Triet, DoP: Simon Beaufils\n\nFormat: ARRIRAW Open Gate 4.5K\n\nCamera: ALEXA Mini LF\n\nLenses: Anamorphic Hawk V-Lite\n\nBeaufils: Justine had the feeling that it would be great to shoot this story on film. All her references, even in still photography, were from film footage. We made camera tests, 35mm in 2 Perfs, Red Monstro and Alexa LF with different types of old lenses. With the 35mm as a reference we built a LUT and finally felt good with Alexa LF + Hawk V-lite. We cropped a lot in the sensor, enhanced the anamorphic’s aberrations (even if the aspect ratio of the film is 1.85 we chose this anamorphic’s particular look) in order to feel “the material” more, to push the grain, distortions, out of focus in the edge of the frame and flares. All kinds of “accidents” were welcome!\n\nWe worked with the same philosophy on the lighting, using some rough big entries of light from outside and almost nothing inside, making it a space where actors could be free to move, and play with light. This my third film with Justine but each time we’ve taken a new approach to shooting, it was really exciting!\n\n“American Fiction”\n\nDir: Cord Jefferson, DoP: Cristina Dunlap\n\nFormat: 4.5K ARRIRAW\n\nCamera: ALEXA Mini LF\n\nLenses: Tribe 7 Blackwings\n\nDunlap: With our main character being named Thelonius “Monk”, I knew from the beginning that I wanted the camera to have a rhythmic flowing motion to it that is, like jazz, partly planned and partly spontaneous. Weaving its way through our characters, I wanted to orchestrate unique blocking and coverage, while leaving room for improvisation from the incredible ensemble cast. Shooting in 2:35 aspect ratio allowed us to do this without feeling too wide and distant from our characters. While the central visual motif was built around the isolation of Monk, we did not want the audience to feel disconnected from him; so even though we were shooting in the 2:35 aspect ratio we chose to shoot on spherical Blackwing lenses. The Blackwings render skin tone beautifully and have a much grounded look that I hope allowed the viewer to lose themselves in the story and at times fall into Monk’s subjective point of view.\n\nWhile the film does sometimes veer off into more surreal scenarios it was important to Cord and I that there was always something relatable in our visual storytelling.\n\n“Asteroid City”\n\nDir: Wes Anderson, DoP: Robert Yeoman\n\nFormat: 35mm film – Kodak Vision 200T 5213 for color, Kodak Double X black and white 5222 for the black and white\n\nCamera: ARRICAM ST and ARRICAM LT\n\nLenses: Cooke S4 lenses for the spherical scenes, ARRI Master Anamorphic lenses for the anamorphic scenes.\n\nYeoman: Wes and I have used the Cooke S4 lenses on a few of our previous movies and like the look, particularly how they render faces. I like the Arri Master Anamorphic lenses because they hold focus across the entire image, whereas many anamorphic lenses fall off along the edges. I know that Wes often places many actors in the frame, and I did not want those on the side of frame to be soft.\n\n“Barbie”\n\nDir: Greta Gerwig, DoP: Rodrigo Prieto\n\nFormat: ARRIRAW\n\nCamera: ALEXA 65 and ALEXA Mini LT\n\nLenses: System 65 from Panavision\n\nPrieto: The large sensor of the Alexa 65 gave us the feel of a big camera on a miniature set. During testing in prep, I compared many different sensors and lenses, and we found that the depth of field with the Alexa 65 felt more similar to test shots of an actual Barbie doll shot with a Super 35 size sensor. We wanted Barbie Land to feel “innocent” and “authentically artificial” and the combination of that camera with the System 65 lenses gave us what we felt was the most simple yet magical feel.\n\nThe lenses are clean but not hard and were flattering to the actors’ faces. We also created a special LUT for Barbie Land, based on films from the ’30s, ’40s and ’50s, shot on 3 Strip Technicolor. Greta loves many musicals from that era, which we reference for shooting style, sets, and color. We called our LUT “Techno Barbie,” which enhanced our pinks, cyans, greens and yellows but left skin tones natural.\n\nThe camera also behaves in a simple, mechanical “perfect” way, in contrast to the “real world” in California, where the camera moves feel more random, in a way that enhances Barbie’s realization that there is a beauty to imperfection. For that part, we used the Alexa Mini LT with a “normal” film LUT for natural colors and a more regular depth of field. The result is a visual contrast between an artificial world where the characters feel like perfection is totally normal, and a real world where serendipity and messiness are integral parts of life.\n\n“The Boys in the Boat”\n\nDir: George Clooney, DoP: Martin Ruhe\n\nFormat: Sony Venice 6K 3:2\n\nCamera: Sony Venice 1 and Z-Camera\n\nLenses: ARRI Alfa Anamorphic\n\nRuhe: “Boys” is a classic story about underdogs going for the impossible. A big part of the story takes place on the water, in all kinds of boats. We needed a small and very versatile camera set up. Yet it needed to be epic for this larger than life story. That is why we chose the Sony Venice and the Alfa anamorphic lenses. Sometimes we worked with the Rialto system. For special rig shots we mounted Z-Cameras on to the boat and used Leica M lenses for those shots.\n\nGeorge and I decided very early on the anamorphic format, it was ideal for the long boats and all the races. It was clear that we wanted lenses with a lot of character and the large format Alfas were just the right choice.\n\n“Cassandro”\n\nDir: Roger Ross Williams, DoP: Matias Penachino\n\nFormat: ARRIRAW 4.5k\n\nCamera: AlEXA Mini LF\n\nLenses: Panavision H Series\n\nPenachino: From the outset, it was evident that, given the script’s nature as a biopic, the film should take on the characteristics of a portrait. The majority of the film featured either the main character in the frame or focused on scenes where he was actively involved, not just as an athlete but also as a man deeply immersed in the emotional turmoil of his battles, both inside and outside the wrestling ring.\n\nTo achieve this vision, we utilized the flawless and stunning H series on FF (full-frame) to emulate the aesthetics of medium format still photography in a semi-square format. This choice also entailed setting specific parameters for camera angles and height, often maintaining a near-zero-degree angle when capturing Saúl (Cassandro) and aligning the camera’s height with that of a human observer. Additionally, our camera approach drew inspiration from Roger’s background in documentary filmmaking, emphasizing an observational style that allowed the audience to immerse themselves in the character’s life without excessive narrative intrusion. We strategically moved the camera only when necessary, preferring to maintain a sense of stillness that reinforced our decision to portray him from an outsider’s perspective.\n\nWhen it came to depicting the wrestling matches, along with Alberto Ojeda the camera and steadycam operator, we devised camera movements and angles rehearsing and learning from the wrestlers, but particularly Gael, who did a tremendous job, ensuring that we remained as close as possible to the action. This approach aimed to maintain focus on the main character while respecting the unique visual language of lucha libre itself.\n\n“The Color Purple”\n\nDir: Blitz Bazawule, DoP: Dan Laustsen\n\nFormat: ARRIRAW\n\nCamera: ALEXA mini LF\n\nLenses: ARRI Signature Primes\n\nLaustsen: Large Format is fantastic. Since the depth of field is so precise and the background is softened very organically, the actor’s eyes and expression come forward in a very powerful way. The opposite happens when you shoot large landscapes, where you instead can enhance the smallest detail. My first idea was to shoot “The Color Purple” on Alexa 65 as A camera (like I did on “Nightmare Alley” with Guillermo del Toro). However, on “The Color Purple,” I was concerned that the Alexa 65 would be too big on the small sets, so I decided to go for Alexa LF MINI. My preferred lenses for Alexa LF MINI are Signature Primes, fantastic lenses that never give me problems and have a great close focus.\n\nThe only problem with the large format camera and these lenses is that it becomes too sharp for my taste. Therefore I always shoot with a diffusion filter that makes close-ups more organic. I don’t want to have a diffusion filter in front of the lenses, as I don’t like filter flare but do like lens flare. On Signature Primes, it’s possible to set the diffusion filter behind the lens, attaining a diffused highlight while still keeping the black black, so this is what I regularly do.\n\nWhen Blitz and I discussed the look of the film, it was very important to us to capture the warmth of the South, the warmth of the actors and the warmth in Paul Austerberry’s sets. That’s why I decided to go with incandescent lighting, using 24 K Dinos, 20 K Fresnells, 10 K Fresnells and as little as possible of modern LED lights.\n\n“Foe”\n\nDir: Garth Davis, DoP: Mátyás Erdely\n\nFormat: ARRIRAW\n\nCamera: ALEXA 65\n\nLenses: ARRI Rental Prime DNA\n\nErdely: Our original idea was to shoot on 35mm film, but there is no film lab in Australia, and our budget did not allow us to send negatives to L.A. With the huge help of Russell Allen from Arri Rental, we managed to get an Alexa 65. We did extensive tests to compare the Alexa LF with the Alexa 65, and when we watched our tests on the big screen, it was obvious that the Alexa 65 was the right camera to tell this story. We knew that we would explore the nuanced performances from our actors in close-ups and we also knew we would be shooting the amazing landscapes of Australia. For both of these purposes the large format of the Alexa 65 was perfect.\n\n“Godland”\n\nDir: Hlynur Palmason, DoP: Maria von Hausswolff\n\nFormat: 35mm, Kodak (50D,250D,500T)\n\nCamera: ARRICAM LT, Arriflex 435, 4 perf, 1.33:1 aspect ratio\n\nLens: Zeiss Super Speed\n\nVon Hausswolff: I feel a very close connection to the camera when I shoot on film. When Hlynur and I started our collaboration, it turned out he loved film as well, so since then, we have worked with different types of film. When he sent me the script, he knew it was a 35mm movie. “Godland” is shot close to where he lives in Iceland, and he had the opportunity to test and try out different formats for some years before we started the shoot. When reading the script, looking and discussing footage he had shot of the decaying horse and Lucas in the landscape, we both agreed on the aspect ratio 1.33.1. It resonates on many levels with the film; the time period, how we frame, the way we look at the landscape, the way we portrait people, the way Lucas sees the world through his old wet plate camera. The advantage of shooting with the Arricam LT was its light weight. Like Lucas our protagonist, we had to do a lot of hiking in very rough and extreme terrain with limited access for transport and crew. The Arriflex 435 was mostly used for the long sequences with the decaying horse and Lucas, but we also used it a few places in the film when we needed to split up and shoot with two cameras, like places where the horses could only walk by once because of its difficult path or when Lucas and the translator had to be in the cold waterfall for a limited time period. The Zeiss super speed lenses were a great match with how we had to grasp the way of filming both visually and practically. They are small and fast, with a look I like. The film is almost entirely shot outdoors daytime, evening and nights. It was interesting to work with such a precious high quality like 4 perf, and at the same time mainly be working with natural light, in this harsh environment with very unpredictable weather shifts. It gave the lens and celluloid a great boost of imperfections, underexposures, dust, rain and moisture.\n\n“The Holdovers”\n\nDir: Alexander Payne, DoP: Eigil Bryld\n\nFormat: ARRIRAW\n\nCamera: ALEXA Mini\n\nLenses: Zeiss Superspeeds\n\nBryld: “The Holdovers” is set in 1970, and we wanted it to look like it was actually made back then, not treat the period aspect as window dressing. The Super speeds are of the period but not overly funky or showy. We were not looking for a period application, but those are the lenses I would have picked if we were indeed shooting the movie back then. We did test 35mm and 16mm and digital and ultimately settled for Alexa Mini as we would have had to give the image the curve and structure of period filmstock-neg and print anyways, even if we originated on film. We built extensive LUTs with Joe Gawler at Harbor Lab, simulating curve, color, density plus aging. Furthermore, in post, we applied halation, dirt (neg and pos), gate weave, and selective grain, more so when we would have pushed the film stock, less so in bright circumstances. More than anything, we tried to embrace and live the spirit of filmmaking in the era rather than merely replicating technical specs. That is ultimately what sets it in its time.\n\n“The Iron Claw”\n\nDir: Sean Durkin, DoP: Mátyás Erdély\n\nFormat: 35mm film, 5219 and 5222 Kodak\n\nCamera: Panavison XL, ARRI 235 — fight scenes\n\nLenses: Panavision Primo Primes and Zoom\n\nErdély: With Sean we always chose film for our projects. We just love the way it looks and feels.\n\nFor “The Iron Claw,” we wanted something timeless, elegant, and something that is quintessentially American. We felt that using film with the Primos gave us the texture and feel we were looking for. We did not use any filtration besides the 85 and NDs, to differentiate between different time periods in the ring we used different light levels and exposures to create different contrast and saturation levels that were emphasized later in the grade. We used 5222 double X to separate the prologue (1950s) from the rest of the film.\n\n“John Wick 4”\n\nDir: Chad Stahelski, DoP: Dan Laustsen\n\nFormat: ARRIRAW\n\nCamera: ALEXA Mini LF\n\nLenses: ALFA Anamorphic\n\nLaustsen: When we were about to make “John Wick 4,” we knew that we had to and wanted to bring everything up to a new level: action, colors, camera movement, and set design. On 2 & 3, we used Alexa Mini and Master Anamorphic lenses, with fishing lines behind the lens to create lens flare, which worked really well for them. Now we wanted to lift the visuals up to a new level, so I wanted to use the Alexa LF mini with ALFA Anamorphic lenses. I love large format. The color palette needed to be bolder and more dynamic, so I chose to use 90% LED light, a mix between Vortex 8 (which we used most) and Sky Panels 60 and Sky Panels 360.\n\nWe wanted to shoot the film in a classical manner, bringing forth Keanu Reeves’ amazing stunt performance. As Keanu does most of his stunts himself, it was very important to us to follow him and his action with a moving and precise camera, in long takes with Steadicam and crane shots, less handheld. The long action takes are like a ballet, with Chad’s vision, Keanu’s performance, and the camera movement in total sync.\n\n“The Killer”\n\nDir: David Fincher, DoP: Erik Messerschmidt\n\nFormat: Red Code Raw 6k\n\nCamera: Red V-Raptor and Red Komodo\n\nLenses: Leica Summilux-C\n\nMesserschmidt: The bulk of the conversations David and I had regarding the photography of “The Killer” surrounded the structure of the scenes and the resulting camera direction. We didn’t discuss how the film would look per se — we discussed how he wanted the audience to experience the film, the dramatic structure of the scenes, and the pacing. This all leads to lens choice and format. We had had great experiences with the Leica Summilux on both “Mindhunter” and “Mank” and I knew the lenses well. I love the simplicity and elegance of the Super 35 format and we both agreed it was right for the film. We thought it would be interesting to explore the idea of putting the camera close to a person who lives amongst us but never has anyone truly close.\n\n“Killers of the Flower Moon”\n\nDir: Martin Scorsese DoP: Rodrigo Prieto\n\nFormat: 35mm Film and Sony Venice OCN-XT 4K Anamorphic mode 4K\n\nCamera: ARRICAM ST and LT, 1917 Bell and Howell camera, Sony Venice, Phantom camera\n\nLenses: T Series Anamorphic, Petzval Anamorphics\n\nPrieto: We wanted to capture the natural colors of nature and the Oklahoma landscape for the scenes where the Osage characters are not around descendants of European immigrants. Film negative has the deepest color depth, and we knew this would be the best way to photograph these moments.\n\nTo contrast with this natural color, we created a LUT for the scenes involving white people, based on color photography of the time (the 1920s), emulating Autochrome (invented by the Lumière Brothers around 1907). Two-thirds into the film, we switched the LUTs to an emulation of ENR, with its high contrast and reduced color saturation. This helped evolve the look of the story to a harsher, more contrasty look that mirrors the deepening conflict the characters are experiencing. For the epilogue of the film, which happens in the 1930s, we created a LUT that emulated Three Strip Technicolor since that was the way audiences would see movies in color at that time.\n\nThe Sony Venice camera was used for dusk and night exterior scenes. This allowed me to shoot in low light conditions and extend the hours of dusk. The T Series Anamorphic lenses were adapted by Dan Sasaki at Panavision to give us a more “period” look, with warm flares and slightly softer rendition. We also used anamorphic Petzval lenses for certain shots where we wanted the edges of frame to present distortion and slight vignetting. These were used for a number of shots of murdered Osage. The hand-cranked 1917 Bell and Howell camera, owned by Scorsese, was used to shoot the “newsreel” shots in the film with Black and White Double X negative.\n\n“Maestro”\n\nDir: Bradley Cooper, DoP: Matthew Libatique\n\nFormat: Three primary Kodak film stocks were used: Eastman Double-X 5222 for our black and white scenes portraying LB and Felicia’s early years, and for scenes in color, Vision3 500T Color Negative Film 5219 was selected for interiors while Vision3 200T Color Negative Film 5213 was favored for exteriors. There were also specific instances where we employed the VISION3 250D Color Negative Film 5207, a medium-speed daylight-balanced film.\n\nCameras: “Maestro” was primarily captured using two Panaflex Millennium XL cameras, with an additional Panaflex Millennium XL camera dedicated for Steadicam shots.\n\nLenses: Our lens choices leaned heavily on Panavision Vintage Prime lenses: The 29MM T1.2 PVINTAGE Ultra SPEED lens was a favorite, followed closely by the 35MM T1.6 PVINTAGE Ultra SPEED. Other frequently used lenses included the 24MM T1.2 PVINTAGE Ultra SPEED, 50MM T1.0 PVINTAGE Ultra SPEED, and 21MM T1.9 PRIMO. Occasionally, for specific visual requirements, we also employed the 75MM T1.6 PVINTAGE Ultra SPEED, 100MM T1.6 PVINTAGE Ultra SPEED, and both the 40MM T1.9 PRIMO SPECIAL OPTICS and 40MM T2 NORMAL SPEED. The 27MM T1.9 PRIMO and 65MM T1.8 PRIMO SPECIAL OPTICS were used more sparingly, as were the 135MM T2 ZEISS SUPER SPEED (PV). There were also moments where we opted for lenses that were Angenieux, with variable focal lengths, such as “15-40” and “28-76,” but these were rare.\n\n“May December”\n\nDir: Todd Haynes, DoP: Christopher Blauvelt\n\nFormat: ALEXA 35 open gate 4.6k 1.85 aspect ratio\n\nCamera: ALEXA 35\n\nLenses: Kowa Cine Prominar\n\nBlauvelt: With Todd’s reference material and image book, we pulled together a lot of different lenses, cameras and filters to see what would work for our aesthetic. We shot in the camera house to get a broad idea and later into our locations to really see how these different recipes might work in our environments. So with as many details as we could give it to have the feel of the film (costumes, art department, hair and makeup), we would screen these tests in the theater to really scrutinize the looks and eventually found what we liked. This ended up being the Alexa 35 with the Kowa spherical glass and some filtration.\n\n“Nyad”\n\nDirs: Jimmy Chin & Elizabeth Chai Vasarhelyi, DoP: Claudio Miranda\n\nFormat: 8.6K 17:9 X-OCN, 5.8K 17:9 X-OCN, 4K ProRezRaw\n\nCameras: Sony Venice 2 and FX3 to Atomos Recorder for Prorez Raw\n\nLenses: ARRI Master Primes and Fuji Zooms\n\nMiranda: The FX3 with the Atomos Ninja recorder was used for all the underwater photography. The camera size was perfect for underwater photography. We could be much nimbler and get shots that a normal movie camera in a large housing could not.\n\nThe Sony Vence 2 works really well with low light. I wanted the red strip to light the characters. The Venice 2 saved me here because water really absorbs the red channel much more than expected. I also wanted the boat to be the primary source for lighting at night. I spent a ton of time working on the lighting practicals for the boat to light the actors.\n\nFor me, the look is to feel natural. I wanted the audience to feel we shot this in the middle of the ocean with Annette swimming the course.\n\n“Perfect Days”\n\nDir: Wim Wenders, DoP: Franz Lustig\n\nFormat: 4K OCN ST\n\nCamera: Sony Venice 2, Rialto 6K sensor, Aspect 1:1.33\n\nLenses: Canon K35 TLS rehoused\n\nLustig: “Perfect Days” is a film about humility and simplicity, therefore, I wanted to keep everything super light and easy. We prepped this 2-hour film for five days and shot it in 17 days, so it had quite a documentary approach sometimes.\n\nWe had two camera bodies on standby, but it was a one-camera show. We had the normal camera body for handheld/Easyrig shots and one Rialto body for mounts and when we had a lack of space. We didn’t even carry a dolly, just some sliders occasionally. I had the most lovely local crew and we also kept the lighting to a minimum, all on house power and no big light sources. It was a beautiful, unique experience. Yoshi Yakusho’s acting was just so touching and special.\n\nIn the grade we tried to emphasise the 4:3 aspect ratio and the filmic look with some grain and quite saturated colours. I think it looks real but also somehow from a different time. I’m quite proud of this “little” film we did together.\n\n“Priscilla”\n\nDir: Sofia Coppola, DoP: Philippe Le Sourd\n\nFormat: 4.6 K ARRIRAW-1/85\n\nCamera: ALEXA 35\n\nLenses: Ultra Speed Panavision\n\nLe Sourd: “Priscilla” is a story that covers multiple decades and our first instinct was to shoot it on film, but we quickly opted for the Alexa 35 paired with vintage Ultra Speed Panavision lenses to bring a softer look. This lens can be used to evoke certain emotions creating a sense of intimacy.\n\nThis was my first film in digital! I shot all my previous films in film. Shooting in digital allowed us more flexibility in production. When I started researching the project, I began watching a lot of Super 8mm footage of Elvis and Priscilla and, of course, the colors stood out so much in this period. Eggleston’s Kodachromes were also a big inspiration for Sofia and me. The question was: Are we obliged to shoot the ’50s, ’60s and ’70s as they were translated by the film stock at that time? For sure this is part of our collective memory, and it’s true the colors were pastels and later on, they shifted towards brighter, more vibrant colors.\n\nOur goal was to maintain a consistent look throughout the various periods, spanning from 1950s Germany to 1970s Memphis. We wanted the audience to experience each moment with Priscilla in a genuine, real and unfiltered manner rather than through a nostalgic vision. Digital definitely opened doors for us since it gave us this direct interpretation on set of our creative vision. We allowed ourselves to experiment and be more spontaneous. The harmony of the talent, lighting, production design, locations, and costumes is really what makes the final image. In the end, it was this harmonious blend that truly brought “Priscilla” to life on screen.\n\n“Rustin”\n\nDir: George C. Wolfe, DoP: Tobias Schliessler\n\nFormat: 4.4K ARRIRAW\n\nCamera: ALEXA Mini LF\n\nLenses: ARRI Rental DNA LF\n\nSchliessler: Because of the important subject matter, it was crucial for director George C. Wolfe and I that the audience feel completely immersed in the film without being distracted by an aesthetic that felt too “period” or overly stylized. We shot “Rustin” with the Alexa Mini LF, as the large format allowed us to use wider lenses (29mm, 35mm) for intimate close-ups of the actors without distorting their faces. I chose the DNA LF Prime lenses, which are made out of vintage glass, as they have a naturally softer look with beautiful contrast. These gave us the closest look to film while still shooting on a digital camera. Shot wide open, they have a pleasing focus fall off, especially around the outer edges, which draws the audience’s attention to the character’s faces and performance.\n\nI also love the amount of color information in ARRIRAW, which helped us to create true and accurate skin tones with our DI colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld. Additionally, the 2.40 aspect ratio was incredibly helpful for framing large groups of actors in the majority of scenes that played out in relatively small spaces. Beyond the technical details and creative choices, my hope is that by finally telling this important historical story, “Rustin” inspires us to all be committed, peaceful advocates for racial and sexual equality.\n\n“Saltburn”\n\nDir: Emerald Fennell, DoP: Linus Sandgren\n\nFormat: 35mm film\n\nCamera: Panaflex XL2\n\nLenses: Panavision Primo primes\n\nSandgren: We had a voyeuristic theme, and we liked it to feel as if we were observing the characters like in a doll house. We composed and blocked many scenes like the family at Saltburn Estate had been portrayed for centuries in the oil paintings on their walls, and other times we shot close-ups of skin, eyes, sweat, as well as of events in the film where we did not want the audience to look away. All these reasons combined made us decide on the 1.33:1 aspect ratio.\n\nThe quality the 35mm negative delivers in color rendition, the contrast abilities, in combination with the undercorrected spherical aberration and the colors and contrast in the beautiful Primo primes, helped us take the visual themes for the lighting, all the way from hot summers to foggy scenes inspired by Gainsborough, to dramatic lighting inspired by Hitchcock, silent horror movies, and by baroque painters like Gentileschi and Caravaggio.\n\n“The Zone of Interest”\n\nDir: Jonathan Glazer, DoP: Łukasz Żal\n\nFormat: 6k 3:2 X-ocn st\n\nCamera: Sony Venice with Rialto extension\n\nLens: Leitz M 0.8\n\nŻal: Sony Venice with Rialto extension is the smallest camera available in the market, and our priority was to have the smallest. There were 10 cameras shooting at the same time, hidden in furniture or in walls; however, they could see each other, which required removing them in post. To make it as easy as possible, we chose cameras that, with the entire equipment (Rialto extension and lenses), were the smallest. When it comes to lenses, we used Leitz M 0.8, firstly because we wanted to look at Germans through German lenses, and secondly because they are modern, sharp in look but still cinematic. We didn’t want to use any vintage lenses not to aesthetize Auschwitz. Sony Venice also has very low noise, even at ISO 3200, this was crucial for the shoot as we didn’t use any additional lighting, only practicals and natural light."
