Inspired the closet scene in Wood Side Apartments in Silent Hill 2.[17]\n\nLost Highway (1997): A psychological horror film involving VHS tapes.[17]\n\nOther works[15]\n\nJacob's Ladder (1990), directed by Adrian Lyne: Inspired themes in the Silent Hill franchise. A favorite of Akihiro Imamura's.[15][10] The film has many settings in common with Silent Hill, such as the hospital and subway. In the first game, Harry Mason dies and everything was just a hallucination in the \"bad ending\". Additionally, the same anti-drug poster from Jacob's Ladder can be found in the first game's texture files. In the second game, James Sunderland shares the initials of Jacob Singer and his jacket is very similar to Jacob's U.S. Army jacket. There is also a \"Lyne House Key\" which refers to Adrian Lyne, director of Jacob's Ladder. In the third game, Heather Mason must find the Bergen Street platform. There is a scene of Jacob, strapped to a gurney, going down a nightmarish hospital hall that is reminiscent of the scene in which James is wheeled through a hall on a gurney in Brookhaven Hospital. Among other things, the \"twitch\" that many monsters do with their heads, one example being Valtiel, was inspired by the film. The hospital scene in the movie depicts a bicycle's wheel turning by itself, similar to a wheelchair seen in Brookhaven's basement by Heather or the wheelchair Harry sees in the alley in the first game. A few moments later, a humanoid is seen in a sort of frame/box, which has also been seen in the series, such as the corpses in Pyramid Head's lair in the Labyrinth, and around bosses such as Mary and Abstract Daddy.\n\nStanley Kubrick: Full Metal Jacket, Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, The Shining — In Lolita, the car driving through the fog in the beginning is reminiscent of the opening from the first game. When development first began on Silent Hill, Harry Mason was given the name \"Humbert Mason\" because of his role as the doting, dutiful father, which was referenced from Lolita. There are many nods in the Silent Hill games to The Shining, such as \"Redrum\" in Silent Hill and posters in Silent Hill 2.\n\nAlejandro Jodorowsky: El Topo, The Holy Mountain and Santa Sangre — In Santa Sangre, the protagonist's mother, who is a devotee of a cult religion following a female saint, was also a model for Claudia Wolf. There is a church with paintings detailing the saint's life[1], much like the chapel paintings in Silent Hill 3. The end area with the bodies in Silent Hill 4: The Room is very similar to the scene with people from various planets in The Holy Mountain.\n\nTerry Gilliam: 12 Monkeys — A sign reads \"floor 1\" in the lobby of the Otherworld Midwich Elementary School in the first game. Also FAA sign on Simmons street in Central Silent Hill.\n\nAlice — The scene where Alice descends in an elevator is similar to Heather descending in an elevator to the Otherworld. The scene where Alice tries to open the drawer is also similar to when Heather uses the screwdriver to open the drawer in the Hilltop Center. Among other things, the canned lightbulbs from Silent Hill 2 were influenced by this film.\n\nBetty Blue — Likely inspired the scene in Silent Hill 2 where James smothers Mary with a pillow.\n\nThe Exorcist III — Various aspects of this movie such as imagery and direction have been referenced since the first game. \"What a wonderfull world\" can also be seen in the third game, just before Heather passes by Valtiel in the hospital on a wall.\n\nEvent Horizon — Members of a rescue team board the ship and have hallucinations based on emotional wounds from their pasts. Also likely inspired the Death Machine.\n\nThe Cell — The Cell depicts the realm of the mind of a macabre killer with surreal and abstract surroundings. This bears a strong similarity to how Henry Townshend travels through Walter Sullivan's Otherworlds in Silent Hill 4: The Room[18].\n\nSolaris[citation needed] — A man is forced to deal with the memory of his deceased wife when a mysterious presence on a newly-discovered planet begins to generate hallucinations and imagery based on his deepest thoughts.\n\nFantasma d'amore[citation needed] — A man is convinced his old lover is still alive and continuously chases after her spectre through the dark foggy streets. She appears to him in two versions; a sexy and gorgeous woman and a haggard sickly wretch. In the end, he learns her ghost came back for retribution and closure. In a couple of scenes, Romy Schneider wears a hairstyle similar to Mary's and towards the end of the film, the main character rows a boat in a large fog-covered lake.\n\nGokumon-to\n\nKindergarten Cop — Midwich Elementary School appears to have been modeled after the Astoria school in the film. In addition to the exterior, many posters on the walls are taken directly from the film, such as the white dog poster. The reception area, along with the calendar and blue and white poster, is the same, as well as the cabinet in the infirmary.\n\nThe Walking Dead — Cited as an inspiration for Downpour.\n\nChris Cunningham: Rubber Johnny — Cited as an inspiration for Downpour.\n\nThe Shawshank Redemption — Cited as an inspiration for Downpour.\n\nThe Fugitive — Cited as an inspiration for Downpour.\n\nAngel Heart — Imagery of fans is used in the Otherworld.[2]\n\nTelevision[]\n\nAlfred Hitchcock Presents (aka \"The Alfred Hitchcock Hour\") (1955-1965), hosted by Alfred Hitchcock: Director Christophe Gans lists this as an influence in the opening sequences of the Silent Hill film. He likens the story of Rose Da Silva leaving home and being isolated to themes seen in the show, as well as pointing out themes involving small towns and protagonists who must flee from police officers. In particular, Gans had Alfred Hitchcock Presents in mind when he filmed scenes of Rose arguing with her husband at Smitty's.[19]\n\nIt (1990), directed by Tommy Lee Wallace: Adaptation of Stephen King's novel by the same name.
