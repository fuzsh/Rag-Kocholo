        "text": "*** Silent Hill 2 [PC] FMV Widescreen Enhancement Pack v1.0 ***\n\nby NeoGAF's angular graphics\n\nUsers have figured out how to have Silent Hill 2 run at a 16:9 widescreen ratio by patching the game's executable with a new resolution and FoV, but unfortunately this makes the prerendered FMVs look stretched.\n\nIn my quest to re-encode them to an aspect ratio that will look right on widescreen monitors, I've discovered the PC version's FMVs suffer significantly in quality compared to the other versions:\n\nPS2: PSS (MPEG2), 512x384 (wrong aspect ratio, it gets corrected during playback), 29.9x fps, interlaced\n\nXbox: SFD (MPEG1), 640x384, 29.9x fps, progressive. As far as I can tell these are the PS2 version's FMVs, deinterlaced and resized to the correct aspect ratio and thus they include additional compression artifacts. Furthermore the deinterlacing is not exactly the best it could be since there are ghosting artifacts.\n\nPC: BINK, 640x384, 29.9x fps, progressive. These are the Xbox version's FMVs, re-encoded. Ewww. Even more compression artifacts!\n\nXbox 360 HD Collection: BINK, 1280x720 (wrong aspect ratio, the game displays them incorrectly stretched), 29.9x fps, progressive. These have more ghosting artifacts than the Xbox/PC version, so they likely are PS2 encodes, resized. In any case they are of worse quality compared to the PS2 assets carefully upscaled.\n\nLikewise, regarding the audio quality, the FMVs that sound best are the PS2 ones. Basically every other version seems to be a re-encode (or re-re-encode) of PS2's assets.\n\nSince I've gone to all this trouble to compare all versions, of course I decided to change my main source from the PC's terrible FMVs to the PS2 ones.\n\nUsing a bunch of avisynth plugins I've deinterlaced them and upscaled them to a resolution of 1280x to the best possible quality. Most of them have been touched up with mild de-haloing, noise reduction, antialiasing and sharpening filters before the upscaling process, mostly so that any unwanted artifacts don't get enhanced as well. In no way have I tampered with their colors, contrast and their overall look. In fact for a couple of clips that I thought the filters would do more harm than good, I disabled them. This has made them a bit softer, but it has improved their quality in other ways. Also this made them easier compressible by BINK, which was the process' final step.\n\nIn detail, there are four types of FMVs and all of them have been remastered, albeit in various ways: 1) Opening FMV, 2) Story FMVs, 3) Credit FMVs, 4) Trailer FMVs\n\nFor the Opening FMV, I decided to use \"The Art of Silent Hill\" DVD as the source for the video and one of the audio tracks, because it seems to be the best quality source available. For the other audio track, I used the one from the PS2. Some very minor denoising has been applied to the video (it is supposed to have a film grain effect).\n\nFor the Story FMVs, I used the PS2 version as the video and audio source, except for one FMV (\"water\"), where due to issues I had to use the second best quality source, the Xbox version. The FMVs of this category had the aforementioned filter enhancements applied to, some, of them.\n\nFor the Credit FMVs, I used the PS2 version for the video, but I didn't upscale them to 1280x in order to keep their size down. For about half of them, I've used the Silent Hill 2 Soundtrack CD as the audio source, so they sound as good as they possibly could. For those FMVs that I couldn't easily use the Soundtrack CD, I used the PS2 audio, which isn't bad at all.\n\nFor the two Silent Hill 3 and one Silent Hill 2 Trailer FMVs accessible through the menu, I used the \"Lost Memories - The Art & Music of Silent Hill\" and \"The Art of Silent Hill\" DVDs as a source. I didn't upscale those either. My encodes look significantly better than the ones shipped with the PC version, as those were full of interlacing artifacts.\n\nOverall, I feel that the FMVs now look and sound as best as they could.. arguably better than they ever did.\n\nDedicated to: Team Silent\n\n*** NOTE: In this package angular graphic's videos have been re-rendered to fill a 16:9 aspect ratio, done by another party. Please read below. ***\n\nangular graphic's Story FMVs (which play during gameplay) were saved at 1360 x 768 (which is ~16:10 aspect ratio) which results in black pillar boxes when played on a 16:9 (standard widescreen) resolution. angular made the videos this way so as not to a) distort the videos or b) crop the videos.\n\nThe 16:9 conversion process aims to remove the pillar boxes and re-save them at a universal widescreen resolution (16:9) of 1280 x 720.\n\nRemoving the pillar boxes from angular's videos already puts the videos at 1280 width. But to fit the videos to 720 height the videos would either need to be \"squashed\" by 6.2% (48 pixels) or cropped off 48 pixels vertically.\n\nSo as not to lose any image information from cropping, the videos were slightly squashed instead. While the difference in stretching is minor, the stretching is ever-so-slightly noticeable. This 16:9 edit of angular's work is for people who prefer not to see the black pillar boxes and are okay with slight vertical squashing of the videos.\n\nFor this 16:9 project angular's videos, which are easily the best versions of the game's FMVs, were converted to a loseless .bmp image sequence and re-sized to fill a 16:9 aspect ratio. The videos were then saved out as loseless .avi files then converted back to Bink (.bik) format for the game to read/play. The quality settings for the Bink conversion were set high to ensure that there was no noticeable image degradation from the re-render. This is also why the videos are larger in file size than angular's original files.\n\nLastly, the Opening and Credit FMVs, which were smaller in resolution than angular's Story FMVs, were also enlarged/re-sized to fill the 1280 x 720 resolution which is why they're significantly larger in file size in this package.\n\nThe SH2/SH3 bonus trailers remain fully untouched from angular's original edits."
