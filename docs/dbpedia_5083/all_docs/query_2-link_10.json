        "text": "Video game adaptations. You either love them, or you hate them. I’ve found myself on both sides, though I usually find myself siding with the latter. The reason for this is while there have been a few that have genuinely tried to be faithful to their source material, they’re lost in a sea of lazily crafted cash-grabs from people who aren’t willing to invest more than a modicum of effort into them.\n\nThese half-assed movies ignore the fact that gamers are an incredibly passionate bunch. Like some sort of geeky hive mind, we’ve spent years amassing our knowledge, holding week-long celebrations, and building insanely detailed wikis that serve as virtual shrines to the things we love. We could use this hive mind mentality for evil, but we don’t.\n\nBecause there’s a good chance we know considerably more about these worlds than the folks adapting them, we can tell when the filmmakers haven’t even played the game they’re trying to turn into a movie. We can also tell when they have played them.\n\nIt’s alarming how rare that is. Turning a game into a movie without playing the game is like deciding to adapt The Lord of the Rings when your knowledge is limited to the six minutes you spent watching the 1978 animated flick. Don’t do that. Seriously, don’t. As fervent as gamers can sometimes get, the communities that surround Tolkien’s works are exponentially more intense.\n\nThey won’t hesitate to cut you, and they’ll do it with a genuine replica of a Greenleaf knife, probably while yelling in Elvish.\n\nThere’s really only a handful of video game franchises that have communities like that, and one of them is Silent Hill. This series has had 15 years to make us love it. For people like me, who have been playing these games since the first released in 1999, that love is unconditional. The first three games guaranteed its status as one of gaming’s greats early on.\n\nChristophe Gans is a fan of Silent Hill, and it shows. Before he was able to direct the adaptation, Gans hounded Konami for five years before he was given the film rights, even going so far as to send them an audition tape to explain his love for the series.\n\nThere’s a number of reasons why I consider this film to be the most successful of Hollywood’s many attempts at bringing a video game to the silver screen, but among them, keeping Konami Japan and Team Silent — the team behind the first four games — involved with its production the whole way through is what kept it from becoming just another video game movie.\n\nWith a fan in the director’s chair and consistent input from the developer, Silent Hill was able to retain much of what made the games so memorable. Akira Yamaoka’s work on the games’ soundtracks is iconic, so pulling a selection of tracks from the early games was smart. That move went a long way in making the film feel like it was an extension of the games.\n\nYou don’t need to spend any significant amount of time with the games to be familiar with their very distinct atmosphere. Silent Hill has a very unique aesthetic. The world is opaque and dreamlike, it feels like a living thing. It shifts and changes based on your darkest fears, secrets and sins. It’s a very personal nightmare.\n\nIt’s not surprising that some of this was lost in translation. It makes sense that Gans and Co. would want to use familiar creatures from the series, like Pyramid Head and the Nurses — originally manifestations of James Sunderland’s psyche — rather than try and come up with something new. Revelations would later take a stab at being original, and we all saw how that turned out.\n\nClive Barker called. He wanted me to tell you you’re bad at this.\n\nThe film’s cast of monsters serve as a sort of highlight reel. Fan favorites like the Grey Children, Bobble Head Nurses, Lying Figure and Pyramid Head make their necessary appearances, and while I would’ve liked to see them tied to Rose, seeing them realized outside of the games with such an impressive attention to detail made up for that unrealized narrative potential.\n\nThat’s not to say the movie didn’t try anything new. That old-timey flashback bit near the end was beautiful and did a fantastic job of cleaning up the near-incoherent mess that was the film’s story.\n\nWe may have reached a point where there’s a dozen awful video game movies for every successful — relatively speaking — attempt, but it’s films like Silent Hill that keep me from developing an entirely pessimistic view of the popular trend. It’s far from perfect, but I believe Gans and Friends have come the closest to bringing us a decent adaptation.\n\nHow about you? Feel free to share your thoughts on this movie, or even video game adaptations in general, in the comments!\n\nHurricanes are frightening all on on their own without having to involve a predatory animal. Yet Carlos Brooks’ Burning Bright not only features a Category 3 hurricane, a ferocious tiger is thrown in for added effect. Back when this film was first announced, its plot was met with laughter and doubt; the idea was as intriguing as it was ridiculous. Over time though, this suspenseful story of a girl, a boy, and a tiger has become a shining example of how to follow through on a high concept.\n\nTwo distinct yet equally uncontrollable forces are on display at the beginning of Burning Bright. As Hurricane Isabel builds a sense of foreboding in the background, a young woman finally confronts her family situation. The collegebound Kelly (Briana Evigan, Sorority Row) is making the difficult decision of leaving behind her autistic brother Tom (Charlie Tahan, Super Dark Times) when life catches her off guard again. Kelly’s plans are dashed after her late mother’s husband Johnny (Garret Dillahunt, Last House on the Left) steals the money intended for Tom’s new care. And for what? A wildlife ranch with the centerpiece being, of course, a former circus tiger deemed more evil than scary by Meat Loaf. The musician’s fulsome cameo feels nearly out of place in this film, but the character is a forceful reminder not to take the tiger lightly, even when the plot comes across as absurd.\n\nThere is no organic way to have a tiger present in this story, seeing as these creatures are exotic to most people. They don’t belong in, much less originate in a place like Florida. So there needs to be a bridge of some kind that brings these disparate elements together. And after assuming Johnny’s latest purchase would simply escape his enclosure and enter Kelly’s house, Burning Bright thinks outside the box even further by revealing the tiger was released. This plot development is both so nutty and so fiendish it sounds like something drummed up by EC Comics.\n\nThe film neither has nor needs time to ponder the whys and whats of the characters’ sudden predicament; like Kelly and Tom, Burning Bright is in survival mode. The director is instead too busy finding efficient ways to keep the momentum up and the audience engaged. Those forty-something minutes of a (big) cat and mouse game could have quickly gone south in less capable hands, but Brooks manages to avoid the worst possible outcome in these kinds of conceptual stories. That is, boring the audience by either desensitizing them to the threat or animal, or just being too repetitive.\n\nUnlike Alexandre Aja’s somewhat similar natural-horror film Crawl — the ’80s snake thriller Fair Game is an even closer match — Burning Bright doesn’t have the luxury of a dynamic venue (among other things). Kelly and Tom are very much sentenced to their home after it was sealed up with them inside. So there is a fair deal of the characters going around in circles here and revisiting the same parts of the house. In turn though, that story tightness becomes more and more intense as well as detectable on screen. The camera gets almost uncomfortably close and fixed on the actors’ faces, in particular when their rawest emotions are coming out in some form or another.\n\nEscaping the tiger would be easier than this film’s symbolism. Perhaps taking a page out of The Descent and other films like it, Burning Bright uses a deadly creature — albeit a non-fantastical one — to contextualize a personal dilemma. What’s missing is nuance, on account of the straightforward approach. There is no mistaking what is being communicated here as Kelly fights for hers and Tom’s life. That level of simple storytelling could maybe minimize the film’s impact, however, the uncomplicated route works well in this case. An allegory being precise is preferable to a poor one.\n\nBurning Bright would not be anywhere as effective without its leads. Charlie Tahan tends to be overlooked due to Tom being nonverbal, yet for his age, he turned in an impressive performance that is never ostentatious. Then there is Briana Evigan, a familiar face of 2000s horror, who is owed some credit for her character’s lasting impression. She requested the filmmakers give Kelly a personality touch-up so she would be more likable: “If you didn’t care about [her], why would you care if she survived?” And the work put into the protagonist pays off well. Yes, there is little delay before Burning Bright throws the brother and sister into the tiger pit that is now their home. However, it’s important to remember that Christine Coyle Johnson and Julie Prendiville Roux’s script doesn’t sacrifice character for action once the tiger shows up; the sibling relationship is always being explored. Every scene — especially ones with the tiger — deepens the personal story at the heart of the film, and paves the way for a rewarding and cathartic ending.\n\nThis isn’t a subtle film. Far from it. No, Burning Bright lays it on rather thick with traps both literal and metaphorical, which, by virtue of solid direction and performances, culminate into a worthwhile story of resilience. Apropos of thematic complexity, the film is still a far ways off from its namesake — William Blake’s poem The Tyger — but there are poetic moments here and there.\n\nHorror contemplates in great detail how young people handle inordinate situations and all of life’s unexpected challenges. While the genre forces characters of every age to face their fears, it is especially interested in how youths might fare in life-or-death scenarios.\n\nThe column Young Blood is dedicated to horror stories for and about teenagers, as well as other young folks on the brink of terror."
