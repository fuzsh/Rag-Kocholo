        "text": "Last Updated on July 14, 2024 by FANGORIA Staff\n\nYesterday, Entertainment Weekly revealed our first look at Jamie Clayton’s Pinhead, the lead Cenobite in David Bruckner’s forthcoming Hellraiser. In the the process of speaking with Bruckner about the film, its star, its new monsters, and the elaborate FX that broughtf the director’s new vision of Hell to life, Bruckner mentioned that he’d be totally open to making another one … should there be demand for it.\n\nSays Bruckner:\n\nShould the fans and the movie gods allow, I would love that idea. Hellraiser is a unique challenge, I think, for a group of filmmakers because, you know, it could be a guy in a mask, but it’s not, it’s inter-dimensional demons that shoot chains at you from an endless labyrinth. It’s complicated and not just conceptually but also logistically. I feel like I speak for our whole team, the SFX, the VFX, the production design, we learned a lot on this. It is tempting to think we’d have an amazing grip on it going forward, should there be an energy and an appetite for it.\n\nListen, we have not seen the new Hellraiser yet, so we can’t weigh in on its quality. What we do know is that there is always room for more Hellraiser, especially when it’s being tackled by a talented filmmaker with a solid budget (two very important elements which, uh, may have been missing on some of the other entries in this long-running franchise).\n\nHere’s hoping Bruckner, Clayton and the rest of his crew have nailed this as completely as we suspect they have, and that the new Hellraiser delivers us unto a brave new world where Pinhead and company are making more frequent appearances on our screens."
