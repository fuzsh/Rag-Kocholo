News\n\nAs you may recall, Christophe Gans expressed an interest in making a new Silent Hill film in 2020 and stated that he was working on a script. https://www.allocine.fr/article/fichearticle_gen_carticle=18687475.html Well, per French magazine Jeuxvideo, Christophe Gans just gave an update and...\n\nChristophe Gans (director of the first Silent Hill movie) confirms that Konami is working on several Silent Hill games and projects\n\nI debated if I should be the one to make this thread or not, but it is new news. Christophe Gans, the director of the 2006 Silent Hill movie (had no involvement with the 2012 Silent Hill Revelations 3D) sat down for a 50 minute video interview with JEUXACTU (French website) because his movie...\n\nHe recently dropped an update while talking to French magazine. The film (which Gans has described as a reboot and a standalone story) is nearly fully storyboarded and will take inspiration from Hideo Kojima's Silent Hills: Playable Teaser.\n\nThe filmmaker has not thrown in the towel. His next project? A new Silent Hill, still in collaboration with the Japanese executives, who intend to regain control of their franchise after the Revelation 3D sacking :\n\n\"There, I have practically finished the storyboards for this new Silent Hill and there are indeed a few nods to PT [legendary Silent Hills demo canceled, ndlr] because, obviously, it made us all dream .\"\n\nLe Pacte des loups, Silent Hill... Christophe Gans, pionnier du blockbuster à la française\n\nSur le point de revenir sur les plateaux de tournage pour un nouveau Silent Hill, Christophe Gans a donné la folie des grandeurs au cinéma français, et pas seulement avec ses réalisations.

Much of my core issue with the movie is that it's wrapped up in a huge exposition dump in the end (and the ending was terrible, too). But the look of the movie was spot on.\n\nOh...yeah there was a second Slent Hill movie. I remember now.\n\nThat one we don't talk about.\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#11\n\nMORE SEAN BEAN WANDERING AIMLESSLY\n\nSeriously though, the first movie was a solid 90 minute Silent Hill film inside of a 2 hour movie.\n\nMivey\n\nOct 25, 2017\n\n18,543\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#12\n\nI'm putting all my chips down on \"this movie will not be made\"\n\nThat's the safest bet, with the lowest reward when you win.\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#13\n\nHe'll base it on something that doesn't exist?\n\n...I mean, ok.

But for the saga fans actually is really a good movie because it followed (with some minor deviations sure) the game so well. Even the OST is all from the games.\n\nNow the second movie is pure trash.

It was unique in games when it was new but it's a pretty standard psychological horror narrative on the movie side of things.\n\nhes done that dance before and we all know how the movies turned out\n\nYup.

It doesn't hold a candle to the games obviously but I don't know, I have a real soft spot for it. I love that scene where Rose runs past her husband in the other \"dimension\" in the school yard.\n\nThat being said, I'm not into his weird thing about \"Horror isn't the same as in 2006\".

Horror in, say, 1984 wasn't the same as horror was 16 years before that. In 1968 people were getting their heebiejeebies scared out of them by something as relatively slow and boring as Rosemary's Baby, while 16 years later we had The Exorcist, Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm Street and The Thing who had all taken the genre further on. I don't think saying horror isn't the same today as it was in 2006 necessarily translates to chasing trends.\n\nTransEuropaExpress\n\nDec 6, 2017\n\n11,206\n\nUS\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#36\n\n2006 was, however much it pains me to admit it, 16 years ago.

Personally I don't think SH '06 has aged poorly, but then again I'm an old fart who insists movies from the 80s have aged just fine besides SFX and such.\n\nAnd good lord if they made a found footage Silent Hill I would throw my dentures and reading glasses at them!\n\nTheJollyCorner\n\nAVALANCHE\n\nNov 7, 2017\n\n9,744\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#43\n\nAm I missing something here?\n\nGans just mentions 'a few nods', not that he's 'basing the movie off of P.T.', yeah?\n\nLast edited: Sep 7, 2022\n\nBrandoBoySP\n\nOct 27, 2017\n\n1,209\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#44\n\nHow original...

The title of the thread isn't exactly wrong, but it's a little misleading.\n\nHonestly, I'm just interested to see what they do with the movie in general. Even when things don't work out, I like seeing what translates to the screen and what doesn't. So much stuff happens in Hollywood, whether it's things that work better in movies than in games or investors deciding \"this wouldn't make as much money,\" so it's kind of fun for me to go in with no expectations just to see what they do.

But for the saga fans actually is really a good movie because it followed (with some minor deviations sure) the game so well. Even the OST is all from the games.\n\nI always thought it was the opposite. That fans of the SH series were more critical of the movie (Pyramid Head appearing in an SH1 story) and people not familiar with SH liked it for what it was, being their entry-level ticket into the franchise.\n\nHzsn724\n\nNov 10, 2017\n\n1,767\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#46\n\nI mean, in this case, it's because P.T. was going to be part of Silent Hill and we're talking about a Silent Hill movie lol.\n\nYeah, he just says a few nods.

Like The Room would be an incredible adaptation. It's way more interesting than the looping hell hallway of P.T.\n\nTransEuropaExpress\n\nDec 6, 2017\n\n11,206\n\nUS\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#47\n\nAnd good lord if they made a found footage Silent Hill I would throw my dentures and reading glasses at them!\n\nSee!

That fans of the SH series were more critical of the movie (Pyramid Head appearing in an SH1 story) and people not familiar with SH liked it for what it was, being their entry-level ticket into the franchise.\n\nLike I said the movie has some deviations from the original game. The Pyramid Head, the protagonist, some deviations from the story like Dahlia being a good mother but overall the atmosphere of the game was very present on the movie.\n\nThe OST of the movie is kinda like the greatest hits of the saga. The otherworld representation. The monsters. The Lisa scene. There is a lot of fan appealing and as fan of the game I was very happy with the movie at the time (I was teenager when it was released).\n\nThe second one forget that exists. It is bad. Really really bad. That final scene is so stupid.\n\nmisho8723\n\nJan 7, 2018\n\n3,772\n\nSlovakia\n\nSep 7, 2022\n\n#49\n\nI still remember that one moment in theater when I was with my friend to see the first SH movie and when the movie ended, I looked to my right at him and knew just from his expressions that he liked the movie as much as I did and right at that moment, some guy in front of us said :\"Well, that was fucking bullshit\""
