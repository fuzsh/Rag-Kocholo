        "text": "Everything looks so fake here\n\nThe Angela scene looks so lifeless, from her face to the background. In the original, the entire scene was filled with fog, then the music hits, Angela emerges. The whole cut scene was a dream-like scenario, something out of a David lynch movie.\n\nIt seemed to me they had enough money only for Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito ; but they couldn’t afford to hire Takayoshi Sato to make the facial expressions mysterious and uncanny. Somebody who actually cared about the characters.\n\nIt is amazing, every time the western developer got their hands on a silent hill franchise, they just recreated the silent hill 2 with the story that basically rhymes Let’s go to the famous trauma town . All of them stunk, but now finally Konami lets them recreate the 2nd—which these western devs love so much— and they messed it up. Even with the blueprint, you can't even bring the magic.\n\nThank you Konami, for adding advanced editions and in-game items. Thank you for not trashing it, I can’t wait to see people wearing a rabbit or a dog hat and talking to Angela on the stairs. This tells me how much you care about the franchise and the characters.\n\nI hate remakes with passion, as they tarnish the old ones. Thank god silent hill 2 is not on steam, or it would have gotten the Resident Evil 4 treatment, where they named the original Resident Evil 4 (2005) and renamed the remake to simple Resident Evil 4 instead of the other way around. Indirectly, removing the OG to replace it with the new one.\n\nTo quote James after the replace ending -- You'd better do something about the cough.\n\nF*** this industry, silent hill was a game, but now it is a product."
