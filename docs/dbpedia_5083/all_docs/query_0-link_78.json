        "text": "It started with a Holga 120N, given as a birthday present in 2012, and, in retrospect, a life changing camera.\n\nNot only my first film camera, the Holga was my first medium format camera, and the first that only shot square images.\n\nBefore this, my only association with 1:1 aspect ratio photography was vague recollections of Polaroids from my childhood, perhaps not even of my own family.\n\nAll the images I’d made myself in the previous six or seven years had been in 4:3 format, the standard for the camera phones and Nikon digital compact I’d been using up to then.\n\nIn fact, even more than being the first square format camera I’d used, the Holga was the one that brought to my conscious mind that photographs could be made with different aspect ratios.\n\nSince then I’ve tried 3:2 (the standard with 35mm film, and an option with many digital cameras I’ve used), 16:9 (commonly called widescreen, and influenced by cinematic films) as well as the 4:3 I already knew.\n\nBut let’s get back to 1:1 square photography.\n\nWhat was most strange initially with the Holga is, previously I’d seen every potential scene quite clearly as either a landscape or portrait orientated photo.\n\nI rarely stood there with my camera flicking back and forth through 90 degrees to figure out which look best.\n\nI just kind of knew.\n\nWith square images though of course, portrait and landscape are exactly the same.\n\nWhich means that taking pictures of, well, landscapes, you can’t rely on a rectangular aspect ratio to crop out any unnecessary foreground or sky. You get more of one or the other, or both, with 1:1.\n\nSimilarly, with photographs of more vertical subjects, where a rectangular crop in portrait orientation elegantly mirrors the subject, again with 1:1 you have to be aware of possibly extraneous clutter each side of it.\n\nWhen I first started out, the compositions that felt easiest and most natural where ones of square or circular subjects, which neatly fitted the square format better than a rectangle.\n\nBut seeking out only subjects that were roughly square was going to be rather limiting longer term, and would likely soon become formulaic.\n\nSo I started looking for different opportunities to make the most of the square format.\n\nFor example, with the beach flag photograph below, previously I would have likely shot this as landscape in 4:3 without a second thought.\n\nBut the square format allows us to reveal more of the sky and, I feel, add more drama to the scene.\n\nA landscape rectangle would have not shown as much sky vertically to give the same effect, and a portrait shot wouldn’t have shown enough of the sea horizontally to appreciate its suggested drama and tumultuousness.\n\nI haven’t used my Holga in years, and even longer for square format – my later pictures most being experiments with loading it with 35mm film.\n\nBut I haven’t forgotten about the challenges and pleasures of square photography.\n\nWith my iPhone (5C) I shot a fairly high proportion of square images (perhaps one in three).\n\nUsing the Hipstamatic app, it was a great deal of fun, and became as close to I’d got to a digital equivalent of my Holga.\n\nMy Ricoh GRD III has 1:1 as an option, though I’ve used it less than I did the iPhone.\n\nIt’s an excellent option for when I want to explore square format again.\n\nBut the camera now most likely to help me make some new square photographs is my current favourite, the Pentax Q.\n\nThere’s virtually nothing the Q doesn’t offer, for my needs, include having the option for 4:3, 3:2, 16:9 and 1:1 images.\n\nIn the next few weeks I plan to explore some more square format photography with the Pentax Q, and see what comes of it. I’ll likely publish a follow up post too.\n\nJust as an aside, I know some people shoot 3:2 or 4:3 with the intention of making square images, then crop afterwards. I’ve never been comfortable with this – or indeed cropping at all.\n\nI just feel that, for me, the edges of the frame are there for a reason, and I should be striving to fill them the best way I can, by the choices I make about where I stand and where I point the camera, before pressing the shutter button.\n\nNot just making sure everything I want is in the frame and relying on cropping later to neaten up the edges.\n\nCall me pedantic or controlling, I just don’t like messing with photographs afterwards by cropping.\n\nPlus it’s another decision I can make in-camera, so I know once that shutter is released, the image that’s made is the way it’s going to stay – no cropping, processing, tweaking or enhancing afterwards, I either keep it, or delete it.
