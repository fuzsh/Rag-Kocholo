        "text": "For someone who spent from the age of about 14 to 27 working towards, and then having, a career as a professional musician and composer, music is one of the subjects I’ve written the least about on this blog. It’s also an area that I’ve probably spent the least amount of time training my teams on over the years.\n\nThe simplest explanation for this is that it’s just often been easier for me to personally do all the music composition, music supervision & editing, and music producing when I’ve worked with other composers, instead of teaching other people what I know and allowing them to do it themselves. Admittedly, I’d have probably been a better team lead over the years had I imparted more of this information, but my goal with the next series of posts on the “How to Create” Blog is to remedy this oversight.\n\nI’ll lay out some of the most important aspects of composing or selecting music for film and how to edit that music to fit perfectly into your project.\n\nWe’ll get into the technical details and I’ll offer a lot of practical advice on both of those subjects over the next few posts, but first let’s start at the beginning and talk about the incredibly powerful role music plays in cinema and why it works (or doesn’t work) to enhance a story.\n\nA Brief History of Film Music\n\nThere are a number of fantastic books and documentaries that cover this subject in far more detail than I need to get into here, but even before the advent of synchronized sound and magnetic strips embedded into film prints, music was always a part of cinema.\n\nTo an extent, the use of music in the earliest movies was just an outgrowth of the way music had been used to accentuate the drama of live theater — especially operas, light opera & operettas, music dramas, and so on — for a couple centuries. In fact, most of the music used during the Silent Era from around 1895 to 1928 (ie. The General, Nosferatu, Metropolis) was repurposed from existing compositions.\n\nBooks like Erno Rapee’s “Motion Picture Moods” (1924) featured sheet music for pianists or organists to use as accompaniment to various types of silent film scenes — mostly selected compositions from composers such as Beethoven, Grieg, Schumann, Wagner, Chopin, etc. That book also contains a number of children’s songs, folk songs, and national anthems, to account for other kinds of dramatic situations likely to pop up in movies.\n\n“Motion Picture Moods” is incredible because Rapee carefully indexed the sheet music by the type of action or mood he thought it would be most useful for, and each page of the book replicates that index in the margins so finding appropriate music for an upcoming scene would be easy for the house musician working at a movie theater.\n\nFor example, if you were a pianist who needed to accompany a scene involving a railroad, you might turn to page 612 and find Wagner’s “Spinning Song” from Der Fliegende Holländer.\n\nOf course, this approach gave a ton of autonomy to the individual pianists and organists working at silent theaters, which meant that the viewing experience for audiences could vary massively — not only from theater to theater, but even from day to day, depending on which musician was performing with the film at a given screening.\n\nSo in order to combat this problem, filmmakers started sending out recommended music cues to accompany their films and eventually commissioned composers to write music explicitly for their films — such as Gottfried Huppertz’ Wagnerian score for Fritz Lang’s 1927 masterpiece, Metropolis.\n\nBut that score was only performed in sync with the film publicly one time, at its premiere.\n\nFor the most part, people who saw Metropolis when it was first released saw it with whatever music their local movie-house pianist wanted to play, and because it’s officially considered a “silent movie”, there are a number of other quasi-official scores people have created to be displayed with the film since it was released nearly a century ago.\n\nFortunately, once Warner Brothers released the first official “talkie” — The Jazz Singer (1927), starring Al Jolson — they ushered in the era of sound film, which created new possibilities for filmmakers to take more control over the music associated with their films.\n\nFor the next few decades, a small number of composers created the scores to some of the most important and popular films of the 1930s-1950s — Alfred Newman (Wuthering Heights, Tin Pan Alley, The Mark of Zorro), Erich Korngold (The Adventures of Robin Hood, Captain Blood), Franz Waxman (Sunset Blvd., The Bride of Frankenstein), Max Steiner (Gone with the Wind, King Kong, Casablanca), Miklós Rózsa (Ben Hur, Double Indemity, Madam Bovary), and so on.\n\nA lot of the music from this “Golden Age of Hollywood” sounds about like what you’d expect from composers who were usually classically trained and heavily influenced by late Romantic-era orchestral music and opera.\n\nWhile it’s frequently melodic and very well orchestrated, it’s also (in many cases) extremely reminiscent of the overtures and dramatic music written by the composers I mentioned above, whose work dominated the silent era.\n\nListening back on a lot of the scores by early Hollywood composers (eg. Max Steiner) with modern ears can, in my opinion, be challenging for a lot of people because of how “in your face” the music tends to be. Much of it would have made more sense in the context of a concert hall or live theatrical performance, and — like a lot of the on-screen acting from the same time period — it can feel a little bit melodramatic.\n\nBut it all set the stage for what we think of as “movie music”, today. And as we get into the 1950s and 60s, film music starts to loosen up in the same way that the films themselves did — drawing on more diverse influences and innovating new techniques.\n\nTake, for example, Leonard Bernstein’s percussive and jazz-influenced score to On the Waterfront (1954):\n\nOver time, filmmakers, actors, and composers alike all started to realize that cinema could afford to be more nuanced and subtle than the stage-performances and vaudevillian shows the first generation of movies were modeled on, and by the later part of mid-20th century the cinematic arts really started to mature.\n\nActors could convey emotion with a look or a gesture; writers started to think about movies very differently from plays; and composers moved away from their European operatic roots, now incorporating elements from modernist and minimalist aesthetics, jazz and pop music, ethnic and folk music, and generally started to take a looser approach to form.\n\nFilm composers’ focus shifted away from classical, formal rules of composition towards adopting techniques that were more effective at supporting the characters’ emotions and the plot beats in the stories they were helping to tell.\n\nSince this isn’t meant to be an essay on the history of film music, I’m not going to continue going through the decades in any particularly detailed way, but I will say that from the 1960s through the 1990s, film music evolved into a completely unique art — in part due to shifts in the ways composers thought about how they should be writing for film (chalk up a rare victory for postmodernism here), but also due to substantial developments in technology.\n\nGlobal trade and international travel played a role, as it not only opened the door to more affordable and available orchestras around the world, broadened composers’ knowledge of musical styles from around the world, and improved their access to unique performers specializing in rare instruments… It also made the equipment composers often use — computers, synthesizers & sequencers, non-linear / digital editing software, microphones, instruments, etc. — a lot cheaper and better.\n\nBut most of all, the competition among composers and the dramatic increase in opportunities coming from an explosion in film production no longer limited to a small number of “Major studios” (now including Universal Pictures, Paramount Pictures, Warner Bros. Pictures, Walt Disney Pictures / Fox, and Sony / Columbia Pictures) created a wealth of new ideas and techniques that got copied and adapted by composers throughout the industry.\n\nIf you are interested in listening to some of my favorite film composers, roughly organized chronologically, I’d encourage you to check out:\n\nErich Korngold\n\nBernard Hermann\n\nHenry Mancini\n\nJohn Barry\n\nEnnio Morricone\n\nJerry Goldsmith\n\nJohn Williams\n\nIra Newborn\n\nRandy Newman\n\nJames Horner\n\nDanny Elfman\n\nRandy Edelman\n\nJoe Hisaishi\n\nYoko Kanno\n\nHans Zimmer\n\nHoward Shore\n\nAlan Silvestri\n\nAlexandre Desplat\n\nMarco Beltrami\n\nBear McCreary\n\nMichael Giacchino\n\nLudwig Göransson\n\nAustin Wintory\n\nAnd with that… Let’s talk about how and why music is important to cinematic storytelling.\n\nThe music is effectively playing the role of the “straight man” in this scene. It reinforces the obvious gravitas of the overall scenario while Frank is busy wrecking it with silliness. It works both because of its nature (military march) and because of its cultural significance (most everyone knows the piece and knows its standard association with the US presidency).\n\nGiven the nature of the setting, the music selection is important to creating a more “serious” environment, thus deepening the contrast between the set up (a very important situation involving one of the most impressive political institutions) and the punchline (Frank’s utter ridiculousness).\n\nAlmost any other musical choice would have been less effective.\n\nIf the music chosen or written for the scene was as silly as Frank’s actions — say, if it used the Benny Hill Theme instead of “Hail to the Chief” — the goofy music would undercut that contrast, weakening the joke. It would also be the musical equivalent of a laugh track, clumsily prodding the audience to react instead of allowing them to decide for themselves how funny the scene is.\n\nSimilarly, if the rest of the scene didn’t live up to “Hail to the Chief”… If, for example, the White House set didn’t look real, the costumes weren’t accurate, and the actors weren’t believable as White House staff and guests… The music would only draw attention to how fake the setting was.\n\nThat might still get a laugh, but not the one the filmmaker intends.\n\nThe same thing can easily happen with dramatic scenes, so the lesson here is to be very careful about the music you select. It should match and reinforce, or deliberately offset, the intended emotion of a scene such that it helps the audience feel the right emotion at the right time. This is a lot of power, and if used incorrectly, it can really ruin a movie.\n\nStructure\n\nThe last practical application of music in cinema I want to highlight here is its ability to help with macro-level editing, providing clearly demarcated points at which a scene begins and ends. This is not only a benefit to the audience, as it helps them understand the sequence of events and their relative importance better — reinforcing and strengthening the transitions from one plot beat to another — it’s also often a good way to help improve the rhythmic pacing of a film.\n\nWithout music, it’s easy for scenes to bleed together and for audiences to get lost without an easy way to break up the information in the story.\n\nOne way to think about music cues in a film is like invisible chapter markings in a book.\n\nEach cue marks the beginning and end of a single “chapter” of the film. This usually means an individual scene, but not always. Sometimes there are multiple cues in a single scene depending on shifts in perspective or the emotional content, and the music is there (in part, obviously) to help the audience keep track of the action. Moments of silence that contrast with the parts of a film that have an underscore can serve the same structural function.\n\nNote that there are a few films out there, such as the Coen Brothers’ intense thriller No Country for Old Men, that have no (or almost no) score at all, but they’re rare and very hard to pull off.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nAs someone who’s done a lot of work not just as a film maker, but also as a “content creator” for platforms like YouTube, my observation is that many people fail to think about the practical effect of music in a very intelligent way.\n\nIt’s easy to find videos on social media that use one track, looped endlessly, for 20-30 minutes at a time, or — alternatively — videos that change music rapidly with no thought or attention paid to whether or not the change is necessary or what it’s conveying in terms of structure or emotion.\n\nIn general, I think this is a result of people not only failing to understand the power music has in the context of cinema, but also people lacking technical knowledge of music editing. They grab some free (or inexpensive) stock music from a website like Premium Beat, slap it on a video they’re editing and just let the track play until it’s over, at which point they just restart it or grab another track and run out the clock again.\n\nThis is tragic, and it’s a big factor in why so many videos you’ll find on the internet are so bad.\n\nThe key here is to think carefully about the music going into your film or video project. Ask yourself the following questions, and takes some time to come up with good, intentional answers:\n\nWhat do you want the overall aesthetic of your film to be? Where (and when) is it set? Who are its core characters? What themes and emotions are most important to the story? How do you want your audience to feel in general about your film?\n\nLooking at the film as a whole, could you draw a diagram showing the level of emotional “intensity” that an audience should feel throughout its runtime? Where are the peaks? Where are the (intended) lulls? When is it at its most intense?\n\nFor any specific scene, what is the core emotion that you want an audience to feel? Who are the characters and what are they feeling? Does that emotion change and shift over the course of the scene? If so, how and at what moment?\n\nWhen does the scene truly start? When does it end? Be specific, and provide timecodes.\n\nWhere are the quiet, silent moments?\n\nDo you intend to use source music (ie. pre-existing tracks)? If so, where in the film will those be and how are they being used?\n\nHow should the various cues all written for the score fit together to reinforce the overall narrative flow leading to a climactic point in the film itself?\n\nComposers working for most motion pictures will go through what’s called a “spotting session”, where they sit with the director and / or producers of a film and take notes with the intent of discussing these kinds of questions in detail. This is a crucial part of the process, as it dedicates time to thinking about the needs of the film. A good spotting session should result in producers and composers agreeing on a vision for the musical language that will eventually become integral to the finished motion picture.\n\nDone right, music can be a huge benefit to filmmakers — providing them with the sonic tools they need to shape a story, pace it well, and subtly let the audience know where the characters and story are headed without needing to hit them over the head with clunky exposition and intrusive title cards.\n\nMost filmmakers — including most editors — don’t really understand cinematic music very well, and unless you’ve trained as a composer or have developed a wealth of experience in that world, my guess is that you probably don’t either.\n\nThat’s ok.\n\nAs with anything else in life, it’s no crime not to know that much about a specialized skillset as long as you have the humility to recognize your limitations and seek out help from people who do know what they’re doing. Music can make a massive difference to the quality of your film, so if you’re already a filmmaker or you just aspire to create more content, I hope you’ll take it every bit as seriously as you take the writing, design, production, and post-production."
