        "text": "CHAPTER 3\n\nDesigners' Cinematic Depiction of a Game World\n\nPlay has a tendency to be beautiful. It may be that this aesthetic factor is identical with the impulse to create orderly form, which animates play in all its aspects. The words we use to denote the elements of play belong for the most part to aesthetics, terms with which we try to describe the effects of beauty: tension, poise, balance, contrasts variation, solution, resolution, etc. Play casts a spell over us: it is “enchanting,” “captivating.”\n\n—Johan Huizinga, Homo Ludens\n\nArtifact Emotions\n\nWhen asked about what he was hoping to achieve with the release of SH2, Akihiro Imamura answered: “You know, in our daily lives we don't really feel much fear. It's not a common emotional state in day-to-day life. Our aim is to stimulate that emotion with Silent Hill 2, so we hope you enjoy that!” (Keeling 2001). This response brings to light an important paradox regarding horror fiction. You actually do not feel much fear in your daily life, nor fright, dread, disgust, or repulsion, because these are all negative emotions you wish to avoid. Fear, John Morreal observes, “is perhaps the most basic negative emotion, and at first glance one of the least likely to be enjoyed. To feel fear, many have claimed, we have to judge that we are in danger, and danger is disturbing” (1985, 96). As the reference to Carroll's art-horror emphasized in the previous chapter, fear has an important physical dimension. What might make fear potentially enjoyable rests on the excitement, the “rush” or the thrill that it can bring, and many put themselves in danger just for the pleasure of it. Adventure, thus says Morreal, is precisely the name used to define this situation. Yet, as he also notes (catching up with Tan's thought about the guided fantasy and closed episode quoted in the beginning of the third part of the introduction), enjoyable fear needs to stay within certain limits. As a more general principle, the overall control of the situation must be retained and conserved; when something has consequences, negative emotions can get too strong and you unpleasantly lose control;1 or, when a fear is objectless, as an anxiety, you are unable to control it.\n\nControl is usually easiest to maintain when we are merely attending to something which has no practical consequence for us, as when we watch from a distance some event unrelated to us. Here our control requires our ability to pay attention when we want, to stop paying attention when we want, and to direct our attention to those features of the event that interest us. When we have the ability to start, stop, and direct the experience, we can enjoy a wide range of experiences, even “unpleasant” ones. (Morreal 1985, 97)\n\nIf you get too scared in Silent Hill, you can always turn off your PlayStation (and wait before going to bed). But what makes a big difference in fiction, such as in the survival horror genre, is that you know that someone has created the situation you are responding to. In Carroll's view, this knowledge mutes the disturbing aspect of the object of art-horror and allows opportunity for fascination (1990, 189). Marcia Eaton asserts that “control permits us to attend to properties which provide us with aesthetic delight …, features [of a situation] which we would be unable to attend or to which it would be inappropriate to attend if we (or others) were genuinely endangered” (1982, 61).2 For example, you can be surprised by the attack of a Nurse upon your entrance into a room of Silent Hill's hospitals and still notice how good the camera position is in that room.\n\nThe focus on the aesthetic experience bears relation to what Tan has, in this instance, called “artefact emotions or A emotions.”\n\nAs soon as they [viewers and gamers] are aware, no matter how fleetingly, of the operation of that intelligence [the editorial intelligence at work behind the film or game] they are in that instant aware of the film [and the game] as artefact. In a general sense, it may be that the more intense the emotion, the greater the likelihood the viewer [and gamer] will realize that this is a special experience and be aware of what he or she is seeing is indeed an artefact. It is interesting that, in that case, the emotion evoked by the situation in the fictional world is one element of the situational meaning, which results in an emotion that has the artefact as its object. (Tan 1996, 65)\n\nThe pleasure of Tan's “Emotion Machine” not only derives from the fictional world depicted, the characters' fate and the fiction emotions this is eliciting, but also from the formal characteristics of the medium. This second source of primary satisfaction derives from the construction and twists of the plot (in fact, as I have underlined, that's what I just did in part by making parallels with the plots of Jacob's Ladder and The Sixth Sense), the stylistic features, technical manipulations, and formal order provided by the artifact organization. Although the appreciation might depend on a certain competence, since film and video game buffs are more inclined to do so, various tours de force can make the awareness of the form more effective. Spectacular special effects and impressive photography or graphics and staging represent such an instance. At times, spectacle takes precedence over the dramatic and psychological developments. Furthermore, Tan says there are “traditional genres in which watching fictional events is the prime attraction, almost divorced from their significance for the characters.” The major scenes of horror films, and survival horror games, “are more than anything else a feast for the eyes, although perhaps not to everyone's taste” (1996, 175).\n\nArtifact emotions result from an awareness of the artistry of creation. The surface structure is grasped and appreciated in its own right without direct relation to what's happening in the fictional world. You enjoy not as much fear itself, as the way fear has been designed. The pleasure thus lies less in the intratextual links than in the intertextual connections between the Silent Hill series and different works of art. The games are without a doubt precisely or diffusely “inhabited” by other artifacts with which they “interact” through references, similitudes, and various influences.3\n\nFull of Details\n\nReviews do not often compare Silent Hill with other games.4 For the most part, Resident Evil and Alone in the Dark are the survival horror points of reference. In the marking out of the parallel worlds and the transition to an Other one, few references are made to the Dark World of Darkseed (Cyberdreams / Cyberdreams, 1992) and the Spirit Realm of Legacy of Kain: Soul Reaver (Eidos Interactive / Crystal Dynamics, 1999). Instead, reviewers, and the creators themselves tend to draw more attention to horror literature and cinema when discussing the series outside its own parts. Readers of H. P. Lovecraft, Clive Barker, Dean Koontz, and, more often than not, Stephen King are said to find themselves right at home in the resort town. Moreover, one King story is effectively cited and is easy to guess: the short story The Mist (1980).5 If Team Silent recognizes the influence of film directors such as David Cronenberg, David Fincher, Alfred Hitchcock, David Lynch, Stanley Kubrick, and even Andreï Tarkovski, reviewers refer more to specific films. In addition to The Exorcist, Jacob's Ladder, and Twin Peaks, which was already mentioned, The Blair Witch Project (Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez, 1999), Eraserhead (Lynch, 1977), The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1980), House on the Haunted Hill (William Castle, 1969), In the Mouth of Madness (John Carpenter, 1995), Lost Highway (Lynch, 1997), Rosemary's Baby (Roman Polanski, 1968), Se7en (David Fincher, 1995), and The Shining (Stanley Kubrick, 1980) are among others that are often mentioned.\n\nIf these allusions express the mood, style, and the terrified excitement of Silent Hill, one parallel drawn in 2001 by a Gamezone.com review of SH2 sets out an interesting point of comparison that cannot be overlooked: “It amazes me how close the game is [to] Toy Story and A Bug's Life in terms of computer generated imagery. Words can't even begin to describe SH2's graphical prowess. For the first time in my life, I actually felt like I was controlling a movie” (Bedigian 2001). Contemporary cinema and the video game do share the same insatiable thirst for spectacular tours de force to blow away spectators and gamers. Toy Story (John Lasseter, 1995), the first feature film made entirely by computer, astonished people at the time of its release by its stupefying realistic animation. The visuals and sound of the early games of Silent Hill have amazed the gamer in a similar manner. But one wouldn't expect less to come from artifacts created in an industry based on fast-changing computer technology. Undeniably, video game history is peppered with technological innovations and continual groundbreaking computer-generated imagery that create artifact emotions. It is an argument defended by Andrew Mactavish in “Technological Pleasure”:\n\nI contend that a significant and relatively unexplored component of the pleasure of computer gameplay is our astonishment at visual and auditory technology, at our participation in technological spectacle, and in the story of its development. In doing so, I describe the ways in which game designers use visual and auditory display to immerse players into a frenetic virtual world but also to draw attention to the game's virtual world as virtual. (2002, 34)\n\nTo make such claim, Mactavish points to Tom Gunning's notion of early “cinema of attractions,” a cinema where the spectacle is based on direct confrontation and stimulation of the spectator's curiosity rather than on the creation of an utterly captivating, totally seamless narrative.6 Mactavish also states that the pleasure of the video game is “a pleasure of accessing, witnessing and performing technologically mediated environments” (2002, 46), environments which are indeed increasingly realistic. As Ruth Amossy underlines, this pleasure is rather crucial for the industrialization of fear:\n\nIn a word, all techniques of presentation which are capable of provoking a surprise, a sudden chill that ably paralyzes critical abilities on the moment, confer to the stereotype of fear its effectiveness. From this comes the relatively brief existence of terror narratives and their rapid aging. The topicality of techniques of fear is extremely limited: effects are valid only for their novelty and their immediacy. This is why the industry of terror, where cinema occupies a preponderant place, works essentially to invent and to perfect its effects. It is not a question of renewing the resource of stereotypes of fear but rather of nursing the modes of their mise-en-scène. (Amossy 1991, 135–36; my translation)\n\nIn the same way, the adventure and survival horror game formula remains the same while the environment gets better and bigger. There are only seven years between Alone in the Dark and SH1, only nine between SH1 and SH: Homecoming, but the improvement in the effects is stunning.\n\nIn light of the wonder expressed about the series through the years, the delight of Silent Hill has obviously something to do with this “aesthetic of astonishment.” No different from other companies' marketing strategy, Konami has advertised SH1 on that basis: “Stunning visuals and true-to-life CG movies coupled with horrifying 3-D images will leave you breathless” (box set). This quote has been reused with slight changes for SH2: “Riveting storyline, stunning graphics and true-to-life CG movies leave you on the edge of your seat” (box set). SH3 is described in those terms: “Featuring shocking realistic graphics.... Series' trademark graphics possess even more disturbing detail” (box set). According to the story of its technological development, the shift from the PlayStation to the PlayStation 2 then to the PlayStation 3 has enabled the artists to improve the quality of the graphics, the atmospheric sounds, and the physics simulation. It also implies the use and creation of new tools. While SH2 borrowed Sony's S-Force 3D Sound Library that emulates surround sound from two speakers, SH3 uses Konami's new 5.1 sound engine.7 If SH2 takes advantage of the power of the emotion engine processor, a new 3-D graphics engine was created for SH3. Such technological progress enhances the fog and the shadow. In SH1, Harry is walking toward the fog, a wall never to be reached (fig. 3a). Due, as we know, to hardware limitations, this flaw is corrected in SH2 where James is walking through a realistic volumetric fog that goes from the back to the foreground (fig. 3b). Just as the image of the silhouette of The Exorcist's Father Merrin standing under a streetlamp on a foggy night in front of the possessed Reagan's house is one of the most evocative and memorable moments of contemporary horror film, the first time James is walking into the foggy Silent Hill is among the most striking events in survival horror and terror video games. This mist gets thicker from SH3 (fig. 3c) to SH: Homecoming, hiding the monsters until the last minute.8\n\nThe water effects are few but also quite impressive in SH2, SH3, and SH: Homecoming, splashing and undulating in effective ways—hiding monsters so they can spring out all of a sudden. Praised from the outset, the real-time lighting is sophisticated. The flashlight of SH1 scans the game world, revealing by its movement lurking monsters. Although it does the same thing in subsequent titles (except for SH4: The Room, in which Henry Townshend doesn't carry a flashlight), this light beam furthermore casts realistic and real-time shadows. The appearances of the monsters are greatly increased by their big, distorted bodies silhouetted on the floors and walls. Sometimes, as in the case of the Nurses in SH3 and SH: 0rigins, it is their shadows that become the source of eeriness and fright, opening the door to a dual world of appearances. The dynamic flashlight dramatizes the game space. It creates its own shade and, in doing so, traces new areas of danger out of every single and simple corner of the corridor. Particularly, the flashlight animates the scene of the action. For instance, in SH3, the moving shadows of the subway's pillars give the disturbing impression that a monster will loom out from behind, and the silhouetted arm of a Mannequin that runs across the wall of the storeroom just might make you more distrustful (fig. 4). Carrying the fascination to the extreme, you might end up walking around only to see the shadows following your move, as around Heather's school desk in SH3, or casting nice shadows while you follow Michelle Valdez and Lisa Garland home in SH: Shattered Memories.\n\nSince the light is coming from diegetic sources, there are a few noteworthy moments in Silent Hill, for example, the corridor in SH3's nightmarish Central Square Shopping Center with the large vent fan and the veil of black moths that Heather has to cross. The Hospital and Hell Descent levels in SH: Homecoming with the light coming through many vent fans are also worth mentioning. But insofar as the most virtuoso performance of the technological expertise is always the one that is the most impressive, SH3 flaunts a real tour de force: that is, the storeroom of the nightmarish Brookhaven Hospital that comes alive (fig. 5). Instead of attempting to describe it again, I'll refer to Dan Birlew's great description:\n\nInside, Heather [scanning the room with her flashlight] can see her mirror reflection. However, small lines of blood begin seeping out of the reflected sink, and soon cover the floor and walls. As you watch, blood engulfs Heather's reflection and soon her mirror image stops moving [at one point in the course of your movement]. Before she can catch a breath, lines of blood begin seeping out of the real sink standing next to her! When she tries the door, she cannot get out! The door will not open until the lines of blood have touched the door and are closing in on Heather. (2004, 115)\n\nThis scene, which occurs in real time, leaves you—to use Konami's term—breathless!\n\nSilent Hill would not be what it is without Silent Hill. The resort town playfully points out its links to literature via its street names: for instance, you walk along (Richard) Bachman Road and (Ray) Bradbury Street in Old Silent Hill, (Dean) Koontz Street and (Michael) Crichton Street in Central Silent Hill (SH1), and (Jonathan) Carroll Street and (John) Saul Street in the West South Vale (SH2 and SH3).9 It is also quite amusing, on Bloch Street, to come across the word “redrum”—a reference to Stanley Kubrick's The Shining (1980)—written in blood on a metallic door in SH1 (fig. 6) or the film poster of Carrie on the building in front of the Antique Shop.10\n\nThose specific references, however, do not make the virtual Silent Hill unique. Rather, the exploration is thrilling because its meticulous design brings its virtuality precisely to the fore. Apart from the quantity of details and the quality of the textures that have increased from SH1 to SH: Homecoming (and even in SH: Shattered Memories for the Wii—this is another story for the PS2 version), the groundwork stays the same: the buildings and their frontage are singular, some have balconies or stairs you can climb up, shop windows display their merchandise, trees and grass line the sidewalk, there are road signs, traffic lights, parked and abandoned cars, brake marks on the roadway, manholes, fire hydrants, garbage cans, public benches, phone booths, posters on the walls, bloody footprints left by the player characters when they walk in pools of blood, and so on. Each indoor location is filled with suitable props, such as the child drawings and geographical maps in classrooms, soda machines in the corridors of public places, various memos, posters, and advertisements on the walls, furniture and forms in business offices, implements and materials in construction sites, and so on.\n\nAlmost down to the smallest details,11 the resort town is well and truly organized to welcome tourists, but one knows it is not that simple. The sign at the beginning of SH2 is ample evidence: with two letters missing, it doesn't say “Welcome!” but “We com !” (fig. 7).\n\nWhen Heather is exploring the Heaven's Night Club and the Brookhaven Hospital that James had previously visited, it is interesting to set foot in those places again and experience a kind of déjà vu that increases the feeling of strangeness; there is now a computer in the reception office of the hospital, and the first-aid box has been moved. The wheelchair of Alessa—associated with the one seen in the haunted house movie The Changeling (Peter Medak, 2000)—is discovered in weird locations. In the Hazel Street station of SH3 leading to the Bergen Street one (as indicated on direction signs), Heather finds herself in the same subway station as Jacob at the beginning of Jacob's Ladder, and in similar situations, such as the twisted ride leading Jacob to the X-ray room of the hospital, which also shows familiar features. During this ride, Jacob sees at one point the crushed and mangled bicycle of his son Gabe, who had been run over, with a wheel still spinning. Then, crossed corridors slowly deteriorate. The atmosphere becomes completely insane. The ceiling changes to a grate. Jacob glances at mournful patients rocking weirdly. An eerie room tone of groans and muffled screams comes from behind closed doors, while the sound of the gurney wheels seen in closed shots is heard. Blood, pieces of flesh, and limbs lie strewn on the ground. In a room, a muscular black man with no legs vibrates endlessly, his head covered with a black hood (one of the movements opening SH3). Silent Hill completely stretches out the nightmarish journey of Adrian Lyne's movie. It is not for nothing that Jacob's Ladder is regarded as one of the game's main inspirations. The beginning of SH: Homecoming and the bonus clip titled “USAGI” of Lost Memories: The Art & Music of Silent Hill (2003) remain direct homage to the movie's gurney ride, as is the similarity of the army jackets that both Jacob and James Sutherland (SH2) wear.\n\nAs for fiction emotions, a good video game character is one that you can empathize with. But when it comes to discussing artifact emotions, it should not be forgotten, as Poole points out (2000, 163), that he or she should also be aesthetically pleasing. The prerendered opening and the short clips at the beginning of SH1's in-game cut-scenes give a face to the characters. Cheryl, for instance, looks angelic (much like Jacob's son), Lisa is pretty, and Dahlia has a strong, markedly superior jaw that gives her a peculiar look. The last two, as well as the police officer Cybil Bennett, have different looks in SH: Shattered Memories. Dahlia is younger, a rebel in her clothing, and shows an unexpected sexual drive (during the car drive with Harry, it is quite a surprise when she talks about “Sid and Nancy,” i.e., her “tits”). Again, the technological progress has been an asset as well. The transitions to prerendered CG movies are really smooth in SH2. SH3 and its followers have all the in-game cut-scenes that enable great characterization. Heather is not Lara Croft, but the character designers (Shingo Yuri, Minako Asano, and Sachiko Sugawara) based her on Sophie Marceau and Charlotte Gainsbourg. They gave her some sex appeal in a fairly discreet way (Beuglet 2003). One has to view the makings of SH2 and SH3 to realize that the designers paid great attention to the NPCs and tried to give them and the protagonists as much emotional expression as possible. SH2's character designer and CGI creator Takayoshi Sato explains how the main heroine Maria, whose face has the same polygon structure as Mary's, possesses much more appeal and looks more real than scientist Aki Ross of Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (Hironobu Sakaguchi and Moto Sakakibara, 2001). For him, there is a reason: she is not perfect, she has wrinkles, and (the narrator of Beuglet 2003 adds) flaunts her tummy with a little roll of flab and does not try to conceal the brown spots on her skin. Sato has also designed the characters of Angela and Eddie in order to reveal specific aspects of their personalities. He makes Angela look older with a facial emotion that seems a little bit uncomfortable, and gives Eddie wider pupils, his eyes looking in two directions, one moving a little fast compared to the other. In SH3, Yuri, Asano, and Sugawara give Claudia no eyebrows, managing to provoke subtle and uneasy feelings without revealing her malevolent side too obviously. They dress Vincent in nice clothes and give him a neat appearance, but make him laugh as if he is hiding something nasty. Since his eyes are squinted, one of his eyes does not look at the observer while he speaks. Detective Cartland, inspired by the priest in The Fifth Element (Luc Besson, 1997), is old and losing his hair. Yuri confesses that he's going bald and doesn't want anyone to notice; that's why he combs his hair back so that nobody will see his bald spot.\n\nThe monsters are not to be outdone. Masahiro Ito explains that his hideous and grotesque visions come from the works of painters such as Francis Bacon (SH2) and Hieronymus Bosch (SH3), among others. Sato adds elsewhere the names of Andrew Wyeth and Rembrandt to the visual influences on SH2 (Perry 2001b). It is also difficult not to think about Hans Bellmer's dolls. With their scenes lit by a halo of light, their use of chiaroscuro, and their figures emerging from the dark, Caravaggio and Georges de La Tour are, among others, probably part of Silent Hill's artistic background too.\n\nA Cinematic Experience\n\nMovies have been mentioned a great deal so far, and not without reason. If there is one expression from Konami's own advertising that has been repeated throughout all of the games, it's probably the notion that Silent Hill delivers a “cinematic horror experience” (box set of SH1 and SH2). In “Discursively Constructing the Art of Silent Hill” (2010), Ewan Kirkland also shows how the series is defined as art and is linked to art cinema in the Making of SH2. The two DVDs distributed by Konami as extra or promotional materials, The Art of Silent Hill (2001) and Lost Memories: The Art & Music of Silent Hill (2003)—released for the PlayStation Portable as The Silent Hill Experience (2006)—could be added here too.\n\nMost certainly, the cut-scenes, or cinematics as it would be relevant to call them here, take on the language of film. If they create fiction emotions, it is also because they benefit from what cinema already knows. It is difficult not to be aware of their formal characteristics, particularly for someone like me coming from film studies. The cut-scenes' shots are directed and cut together in a way that makes their viewing compelling. It's a camera movement pulling away from Harry that, interestingly, reveals the presence of Cybil in the Cafe 5to2 at the beginning of SH1. The camera moves slowly during their talk to get away from simple talking heads and to compose a more dynamic scene. Dahlia Gillespie makes her appearance in the Balkan Church through a CG movie's crane shot down on a crucifix and away from her. While she talks about the Flauros, a low-angle shot shows her under the crucifix. When Harry goes to the waterworks, the scene ends with Lisa isolated in a shot that expresses her loneliness. Her death is intensified by the sad music (a guitar theme quite different from the synthesized themes of other cut-scenes) and by the camera moving toward Harry as the dying Lisa is heard knocking behind the closed door. In SH2, the camera is just as mobile during the first and second encounters between James and Angela. In many cut-scenes, it often moves rather subtly. Other movements, like the crane shot before James jumps into the third abyss of the Toluca Prison, are also quite impressive. Maria's deaths are deeply touching because of how they are made. At the time of Maria's first death, after he runs away from Pyramid Head, James's panic in front of the closed elevator doors is sharpened by the shaky camera and the closed framing over his shoulder. When an ear-splitting noise shifts to a tearful piano melody after Maria has been stabbed and killed behind the doors, it is hard to struggle against the sadness. The gamer aware that the scene is a construction will be touched by the making of it. This strange kind of sadness, as Marcia Eaton would say, is even more intense when James suddenly realized his murderous gesture in Room 312 of the Lake View Hotel. It is framed in a long shot in front of the television, and the camera slowly turns around behind him on a variation of the main piano theme until Laura gets in. Then, leaving time and space for the emotion, a long shot shows the two far away after James has made his confession. From this time on, closer to a Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within than a Toy Story, the cut-scenes of SH3 are true cinematic pieces. They now perfectly play with the lens's focus, as demonstrated by the first time Heather has a throbbing headache after her first talk with Claudia. A limited depth of field, an optical phenomenon common to all cinema camera lenses, is used in the dramatic moment at the Lakeside Amusement Park, where Heather walks away while Douglas is seen out of focus behind her pointing his gun at her back.\n\nTo assume that the relationship between Silent Hill and cinema is limited solely to the cut-scenes would result in the pure and simple refutation of the definition of video games—not movies—as a cinematic experience. Evidently, this asks for further considerations. At the image level, the likeness to film is marked in SH2 with the noise effect, a grainy filter that gives the illusion it was shot on film stock. An extra setting option that has enthused Imamura: “We're really proud of the analog film kind of style. We wanted to create a non-polygonal-looking image, and that's why the game has the noisy look” (Davison 2001, 126). The additional layer is renewed in SH3 and “used [again] to create a scarier atmosphere” (instruction manual). This time, “The development team wished to give Silent Hill 3 a distorted look, closer to watching an old horror movie on VHS tape” (Birlew 2004, 35). SH: 0rigins adds dirt and scratches on the already grainy celluloid image during fights with monsters; they are also added in SH4: The Room when ghosts appear—during short dying cut-scenes and during the passages through the hole connecting the different worlds. But even with a lower-resolution image, SH1 has a filmlike appearance. Michael Riser reminds us of this in his review of SH3: “The original Silent Hill still looks quite attractive for a PS title, but there's something far more important about it: it gave the series' art style its roots” (2003). Consequently, a more obvious visible (and to become very popular) element gives the series its visual style: the lens flare effect simulating the glow-over part of the image caused by a source of light hitting the lens of a camera. While there is no sun in Silent Hill (as compared to Liberty and Vice cities of the Grand Theft Auto series) to create such an aesthetic impression, each time you stare into the lens with your flashlight, it creates such flares (fig. 8).\n\nThe use of cinematic camera angles and different camera positions is not a new stylistic trait unique to Silent Hill. Such a vertical angle is used to show Edward in a corridor of Derceto in Alone in the Dark, and also at the beginning of Resident Evil 2, showing Leon running in the back street behind the gun shop. A similar shot in SH1 follows Harry in the alley where Cheryl has entered. However, the directors of the first three games of the series (SH1's Keiichiro Toyama, SH2's Masahi Tsuboyama, and SH3's Kazuhide Nakazawa) have done a really great job making the montage of their action more expressive and dynamic. They do not divert the attention away from information. On the contrary, the camera cuts to a new shot in order to point out the entrance of the next location or to draw attention to the presence of items. The player characters are always turning their heads to look at those important elements. If Gordon's house is not marked on the map, there is a notable cut to the alley that indicates to Harry the back access to this teacher's house. Of course, as in any survival horror game, Tsuboyama and his fellows play with the field of action in order to hide monsters off-screen once in a while. The Nurse's sudden appearance when James enters Room M3 of the Brookhaven Hospital is a good example of these scary moments. Indoors, where montage is most often displayed, the directors keep the over-the-shoulder/head view when you get back in a corridor to set off the player character's movement. But their preset camera positions and angles upon the entrance to a room vary superbly. They reposition the camera from the back to the front of the room, from a low to a high angle, from lighting the enemies frontally or leaving them in back light, and so on. With the power of SH3's graphics engine, Nakazawa is able to compose exceptional frames leaving us in awe, as in the low-angle shot through the wheel of a wheelchair, spinning when Heather moves forward in the basement of the Brookhaven Hospital, or the breathtaking image in the room of the church that Heather explores to find the cassette tape (fig. 9).\n\nOne is still astonished at how beautiful this may be upon viewing James in SH2 through the big ceiling fan in the room where he gets the Great Knife of Pyramid Head, or seeing a Flying Reptile moving around Harry in SH2 and passing just in front the airborne camera in the rear foreground. The vertical angle in the women's restroom of SH: 0rigins' Cedar Groove Sanitarium with the blood inscription “Bring me my son” is quite impressive as well.\n\nThe movements of the virtual camera are what sets SH1 apart from the first Alone in the Dark and Resident Evil games. Along with the vertical angle, the camera follows Harry in the alley at the beginning of the game. Actually, from the moment Harry crosses the fence and arrives in the alley, only two high-angle shots are fixed. Otherwise, the camera does not stop moving. It moves in a peculiar manner to show the distressed father through several pipes (fig. 10), rises up, and looks down vertically as he reaches a corner.\n\nThen the camera drops low to follow his footpath. There is a similar shot when Harry comes across a wheelchair after the night has strangely fallen. But this time, the virtual camera stays in the air, following and making circular movements with Harry as he bumps into a gurney with a bloody corpse under a white sheet. While the player character moves on, the camera suddenly gets closer, as if something was about to happen (a move often repeated at the beginning of SH2 too). Yet nothing happens until Harry is attacked by little monsters at the end of the alley, starts to flee, and realizes that he seems to be trapped. The camera then moves and whirls round as restlessly as Harry himself does. This dynamic beginning is representative of the moving camera aesthetic of Silent Hill. It is not only during the cut-scenes that the camera is almost constantly moving. It follows the player character in action from the front, the side, or behind. What's more, with the exception of a few locations (the alley being one example), the camera can be controlled with a “search view” (L2 button in SH1 to SH: 0rigins), which fixes the camera at a certain distance behind the player character (like the camera in Tomb Raider, which swirls around a lot too, but not with the same effect). So even if you cannot switch to a subjective point of view, as it is possible to do with the camera obscura in the Fatal Frame series (there is a first-person point of view in SH: Homecoming; however, it is only useful for looking around, as it is not possible to make the player character move once you have engaged the R3 button), this over-the-shoulder view allows you to see what's coming up around the next turn. Nevertheless, the search view does not always toe the line.12 As has often been underlined regarding the survival horror genre, the controls remain unwieldy, introducing chilling—or, for some gamers, frustrating—moments. For example, while James explores porches on Lindsey Street, whether holding the L2 button or not, the camera remains behind trees, blocking the view. This makes you worried about what could happen out of your sight. Consequently, standing too close to a monster keeps you from framing it effectively, making closed fights difficult. And even more significantly, every time you hit the L2 button, the camera quickly twirls around to get into position behind the player character, a movement that may make you feel dizzy and bewildered.\n\nAlthough reviewers were not specific, it is on this basis that a comparison with The Shining becomes relevant, and Cynthia Freeland's comments about Kubrick's film are enlightening. Freeland observes:\n\nThe camera in The Shining is a particularly eerie and disorienting force. One reviewer [Steven Shiff of the Boston Phoenix] commented, “Most of the film feels like an endless subjective shot: we appear to be watching the hotel and its occupants through the eyes of an unearthly prowler, someone who sees very differently from the way we see.” Even the more straightforward passages that represent dialogue or lay out the hotel's rooms and corridors become uncanny through unusual camera motions or perspectives. (Freeland 2000, 217)\n\nWith the moving camera during the dialogue cut-scenes and the outdoor explorations representing long takes, Silent Hill gives the same impression. At first glance, since you are controlling the player character and the third-person point of view as well, one could easily think you remain this unearthly prowler. As for the camera's dislocation from its normal vantage point in many scenes of Kubrick's film, the fact that you cannot continuously and completely command the roving virtual camera provides it with some supernatural powers. “It almost acts as if it has a will of its own, conjuring up the independent evil forces that reside in the Overlook Hotel [for The Shining and in the entire town for Silent Hill]” (Freeland 2000, 219). To watch the scene from a distance also conveys “the feeling that [you] cannot see exactly what is going on and must creep forward to find out” (218). Insofar as you are to discover disturbing sights, the progress is always punishing. That's what Danny is experiencing in the Overlook Hotel.\n\nMounted just below [above in actual fact] the level of a Big Wheels tricycle, the camera tracks Jack's son Danny (Danny Lloyd) as he races around corners and down the hotel's long corridors. We come close to occupying Danny's point of view in terms of both position and motion, but our perspective is not quite identified with his in these scenes. Instead, we follow behind him like a force that keeps him in view for unknown, perhaps nefarious, ends. (Freeland 2000, 218)\n\nSeeing the games in the light of cinema, one can only point out the similarity between the muted swaying of the Steadicam tracking shots preceding or following Danny, Jack (Jack Nicholson), or his wife Wendy (Shelley Duvall) in The Shining's corridors of the hotel and the camera movements physically linked to Silent Hill's player characters' movements in the various indoor locations.\n\nExtending the parallel further to include even earlier occurrences, the roving camera in Silent Hill may even be related to the “unchained camera” of the German expressionism, a device that aimed to articulate the character's inner feelings. In fact, the mental state of the protagonists, the role played by the town, the blur effect of the fog, the lighting style, the high- or low-angle shots, all the prominent visual features of Silent Hill enable a comparison with this school's aesthetic (an aesthetic borrowed later by the American film noir of the 1940s and 1950s). As a key movement in the development of the horror film, the German movement displays a “haunted screen,” and “what matters is to create states of anxiety and terror” (Eisner 1973, 21). From the pictorial and theatrical Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (Robert Weine, 1919) to expressionist films such as Nosferatu, a Symphony of Horror (Friedrich W. Murnau, 1922) and The Golem (Paul Wegner, 1920), and even to a Kammerspiel (chamber drama) like The Last Laugh (Murnau, 1924), which makes particular use of an “unchained camera,” the German movement's principal objective is the portrayal of psychological states through external forms, those of the world's spaces and the objects within them. To carry off this effect, the image is distorted by various means such as diagonal compositions, depth of field integrating characters in settings and landscapes (which become “dramatic” or “dramaturgic” factors), camera angles, light and shadows. To refer to the last aspect, as with Silent Hill's use of the flashlight for the main source of illumination, the expressionists' lighting shapes the space of the drama, generates a new area of high contrast and black shadows, traces the contour and the contours of things, casts a world of shadows, and creates effects of chiaroscuro. This renders architecture expressive, dissolves bodies in dusk or obscurity, and gives a symbolic dimension to the pictorial representation. The main goal of the expressionist movement is to depict a stimmung, that is, to suggest the “vibrations of the soul.” In the context of German film, this “mood,” “atmosphere,” or “attunement” of the image “hovers around objects as well as people: it is a ‘metaphysical' accord, a mystical and singular harmony amid the chaos of things, a kind of sorrowful nostalgia which … is mixed with well-being, an imprecise nuance of nostalgia, languor colored with desire, lust of body and soul” (Eisner 1973, 199). Dennis Giles in “The Conditions of Pleasure in Horror Cinema” comments,\n\nThe stimmung … is bent by fear, desire and anticipation so that it “speaks” something more than it shows. The figure of the delayed, partial or empty vision ambiguates the image; it overlays the explicit significance of the scene with a monstrous presence which belongs to an other scene—a scene off-screen, and not fully conscious. (1984, 42)\n\nIn one of the figural categories Giles distinguishes, the on-scene threat represented by the presence of the monster is obscured by the shadows of a chiaroscuro lighting pattern as well as by the mist, an element highly relevant with regard to Silent Hill. Giles talks about the masking “spectral light” of Poltergeist (Tobe Hooper, 1982) and the way the light glares into the camera. The artifact emotions thus come to the surface from images that can “evoke an ambiguous stimmung of combined threat and wonder” (Giles 1984, 43). And then, in an afterword, Giles makes a point of noting that sound “works to reinforce or intensify the threat of the visual figure” and “communicates an other scene while yet withholding it from full presence” (48). This way of bending the stimmung is most certainly one of the distinctive, stylistic features of Silent Hill.\n\nAudio-Video Games\n\nTo begin a short essay on the importance of sound in the video game, Jonathan Hoffberg (1997) recalls an earlier MIT study in which participants had to choose the best-looking picture between a high-definition television with a low-fidelity sound system and the same content shown on a regular television outfitted with a CD-quality sound system. The participants chose the normal NTSC screen with the high-fidelity sound. If sound generally makes a picture look better, it can also be said that it makes a terrifying one even more frightening by its force of suggestion, by getting deeper in the unconscious. From this auditory perspective, Silent Hill is undoubtedly without equal within the genre. Here it is relevant to quote a comment from French sound theoretician Michel Chion about David Lynch's work in a section on Eraserhead:\n\nLynch can be said to have renewed the cinema by way of sound. If his visual continuity is classic and transparent (though with a kind of warp which once again reveals the force of cinema, as a slight change in the conventional rules yields a wealth of new effects), his sound continuity is idiosyncratic from the outset. Sound has a precise function, propelling us through the film, giving us the sense of being inside it, wrapped within its timespan. The sound is animated from the inside by a perpetual pulsation. (Chion 1995, 44)\n\nTo start with, if the pulsation places you in a secure inner space in Eraser-head according to Chion, it is quite the opposite in Silent Hill. Be that as it may, it can also be said that Silent Hill (re)vamps the survival horror genre from the beginning by the way the game uses sound. Sound director (for SH1, SH2, SH3, and SH4: The Room) and series music composer Akira Yamaoka has left his mark on the genre.\n\nTo bring into play the title of another Chion book, Audio-Vision: Sound on Screen (1994), the games of Silent Hill are really “audio-video” games, and, it is important to note, the audio precedes the video in the expression. This is the primary point of Guillaume Roux-Girard's essay, “Listening to Fear: A Study of Sound in Horror Computer Games” (2010): sound is at the core of the scary experience of the survival horror genre. As SH1 was a team creation from the beginning, the game, and incidentally the series, was designed with sound in mind (which is not always the case in video games). With the key visual device of the series—the flashlight with its limited halo and range of illumination—comes an important audio device: the pocket radio; it transmits only white noise when there are enemies nearby (both devices are absent in SH4: The Room). Along with the fog and the darkness, this audiovisual combination works very well to fulfill a precept of sound design put forward by Randy Thom in “Designing a Movie for Sound”: “Starving the eye will inevitably bring the ear, and therefore the imagination, more into play” (1999). As I also state in “Sign of a Threat: The Effects of Warning Systems in Survival Horror Games,” the impact of this forewarning in eliciting fear is enormous (but here I'm referring to a type of emotion elicited by the gameplay, a type I'll be talking in the next chapter). When the presence of an enemy is signified through static, you are suddenly more afraid of the dark, taking each step forward with more watchful eye and ear. The first sounds you hear in SH1 of the approaching of a monster through the radio are among the most striking events in survival horror and terror. Moreover, when made aware of this presence, either on the left or behind you, you become much more conscious of the use of (surround) sound—emulated in SH2 and effective in SH3 and latter games.\n\nYou are also kept on your toes in Silent Hill, and more specifically in SH1, by haunting horror noises without visible or identifiable sources that randomly startle you, or that help build the fearsome atmosphere, like hearing a sobbing child in the Men's Rest Room on the second floor of the Midwich Elementary School, and the plaintive cry in the sewers leading to the amusement park (SH1), or the single, short baby's cry near Room 203 of the Wood Side Apartments, and the little, high-pitched groaning beast in the basement of Brookhaven Hospital (SH2). While the cat hiding in one of the boxes of the school's locker room makes you jump when it springs out, it is equally scary to hear a monster bolt when the cat escapes out of the room (SH1). You hear the neighbors' story from above in the storage room of the Central Square Shopping Center of SH3 and in the restroom of the fifth floor of the construction site before the Hilltop Center. Sometimes things suddenly burst out when you are leaving rooms in both hospitals (in a restroom, the storeroom, the director's office after you take the Plate of Queen for SH1, or Room C2 for SH2). Harmless Little Phantoms in SH1, which are almost transparent and can easily get near you, produce a screeching sound that sets your teeth on edge. The creatures of SH: Shattered Memories also have a high-pitched scream. In SH2, a never-to-be-seen roaring monster follows James along the hiking path at the beginning, and small, unseen beasts rustle in the leaves as well.\n\nTo demonstrate the use of sound in storytelling, Randy Thom gives an example of particular relevance to the narratives in Silent Hill. He talks about a man returning to his hometown in an attempt to find the source of his bad dreams. More specifically, the man goes back to the steel mill where his father worked.\n\nFirst, it will be natural to tell the story more-or-less through the pov [point of view] of our central character. But that's not all. A steel mill gives us a huge palette for sound. Most importantly, it is a place which we can manipulate to produce a set of sounds which range from banal to exciting to frightening to weird to comforting to ugly to beautiful. The place can therefore become a character, and have its own voice, with a range of “emotions” and “moods.” And the sounds of the mill can resonate with a wide variety of elements elsewhere in the story. None of this good stuff is likely to happen unless we write, shoot, and edit the story in a way that allows it to happen. (Thom 1999)\n\nTeam Silent allows itself all the possibilities. There is no steel mill in Silent Hill, but there may as well be. Thus, if the prominent string orchestration of Resident Evil and its sound effects brings it closer to the classic use of sound in horror films, Akira Yamaoka seems to be, and I'm borrowing the expression from a review of SH1 Original Soundtrack (1999),13 conducting in a giant factory that manufactures evil. Because Yamaoka's musical themes, often compared to Angelo Badalamenti's Twin Peaks pieces, are mostly kept for the cut-scenes. The themes range from simple synthesized musical scores in SH1 to the more trip-hop songs of SH3, of which the song “Letter—From the Lost Days” that accompanies the long cut-scene in the car journey to Silent Hill gives a very emotional scope to Heather's account of her past. Consequently, Yamaoka has composed marvelously dark ambient and industrial soundscapes for the gameplay. In his “orchestra,” the strings, percussion, and wind instruments also have their dark counterparts, which means they give up their places to all kinds of industrial and metal noises: bang, clang, drone, grinding, hammer, rattle, scrape, screech, slam, throb, and so on. Heavy tracks such as “Until Death,” “Devil's Cry,” and “Half Day” or more quiet ones such as “Hear Nothing” and “Killed by Death” of the SH1 Original Soundtrack give a really good indication of the range of Yamaoka's work. The more you progress in Silent Hill, the deeper you go in its nightmarish depths, the more the sounds relentlessly hum and pound. If they rush you to act in many places, every so often the repetitive industrial beats eventually become almost unbearable and alienating, raising terror to another level. As Carr says, “Silent Hill wants its players to be frightened, and the sounds of the gameworld move into our own space” (2006, 60). The sounds go even further because Yamaoka takes a different approach than do other survival horror sound designers. As he explains:\n\nI think that the sounds in Resident Evil are pretty formal. I would say we are used to hearing them. Whereas for Silent Hill 2, I really tried to create something that would surprise you, something that would challenge your imagination as if the sounds were going under your skin. What I mean by that is to create a physical reaction for the game player such as a feeling of apprehension and unease. (Beuglet 2001)\n\nIn addition to the industrial orchestration, the roars and shrieks of all sorts of monsters are also disturbing for their peculiarities, while the Doctors of SH1 walk around groaning like zombies. As for their bodily nature, the sound expressions of the monsters evolve. The Nurses become sexier through the series and leave their low-pitched “voice” of SH1 and penetrating, sped-up respiration in SH3 for much more noiseless behaviors in SH: 0rigins and SH: Homecoming. The Little Monsters at Midwich Elementary School have mournful cries and insane screams when they jump on Harry. The numerous Patient Demons of SH2 walk with an unsteady gait and sound like rusting, rolling mechanical toys when they are on the floor. As Yamaoka explains in the Making of SH3, he mixes digital effects with real animal noises, a mix that puts you off balance between recognition, uncertainty, and fear. For example, the Double Heads Dogs roar like lions, the Closers breathe and charge like rhinoceroses, and the Numb Bodies bray like donkeys and screech like monkeys before they die.\n\nAlthough the ear-splitting industrial noises are important features of Silent Hill sound design, Yamaoka does not resort solely on them. He uses a huge palette of sounds. The moment Harry sets foot in Silent Hill, you can hear the “evil steel mill” in the distance. A hollow rumbling drone arouses the feeling that the ghost town is groaning, answering to important events with its notorious siren (although I have no recollection of hearing it in SH3 though). In SH2, the addition of faint water drippings during the day adds a tenebrous dimension to the atmosphere. The eerie atmospheric rumbling is only broken by your footsteps on the foggy roadway, the static of the pocket radio, the encounters with the monsters, and the blasts of the handgun or the blows of the wood plank. This rumbling changes through the games, from a drone to a screech on the way to the Antique Shop (SH1) for example, or with the addition of squirming and swarming sounds at night in SH2. But perhaps more distressing, indoor locations, or many parts of them, are totally noiseless. In the sewers and the Hazel Street Subway Station, the pocket radio does not function; you can only hear the sounds of your footsteps14 and of the locked/opened doors breaking into the dark. “The job of a sound designer,” says Yamaoka, “is not just to create sounds, so to speak. We also have to know how to use silence. I think that selecting moments of silence is another way of producing sound” (Beuglet 2001). Obviously, what would Silent Hill be without its dead silence? Its uncomfortable quietness makes you feel the solitude of the night, makes you become aware, in a combination of threat and wonder as it was described earlier, of the solitary experience of the game. This feeling is colored by other room tones. For instance, the normal Alchemilla Hospital of SH1 gives you the impression that you are undersea in a submarine, an effect the sewers intensify with the water dripping and the muffled echo of footsteps on metal grates. But if the confrontation with the monsters rambling in the corridors reminds you that you still have to survive the resort town, the dark and industrial ambiences also make it clear that you have to carry on with your journey, that there is an evil intelligence that exhorts you to do so. The continuation of Chion's early talk about Lynch offers another great insight:\n\nGiven its fundamentally temporal nature, sound (far more than the image) is ordinarily likened to a continuum, a flow, and used in this way. However, in Lynch's work, the pulsation of sound environments does not give rise to a flow which overrides the cuts. The pulsation is perpetually stopped and started by scissors which at once separate and join, often in synch with the visual cuts. The author controls the pulsation like a flow, which he interrupts to distribute and regulate it in spurts. (1995, 44)\n\nOnce more, this comment about the sound environments applies to Silent Hill. As there are breathing tempos with voodoo incantations in some rare moments, the heartbeat of Silent Hill, and by the way of the gamer, is greatly variable. At any time pounding sounds may break out, alarming sounds may fade in and out, and an ambience may overlap across different spaces. However, the pulsation separating and joining the visual “cuts” is also salient. The end of cut-scenes recurrently brings about the end of the musical theme or a change in ambience. Contrary to the music of Resident Evil, which is used for sound bridges over the doorways to the rooms, the short black transitions through the doors of Silent Hill draw more upon the notion of a “cut.” At first, the pocket radio's static constantly breaks the silence and punctuates the comings and goings in the different rooms. On the one hand, as in the Wood Side Apartments of SH2, it is the corridors that are filled with silence and the rooms that are inhabited by dark or odd ambiences. On the other hand, most often in the nightmarish world, it is the opposite; the corridors are searched on industrial noises, while the entrance to the rooms leads to more quiet audio spaces. If rooms are normally filled with monsters lying in wait for you, a few others are empty of their presence, but not of the noises. This is especially the case in the room with the huge fan near the storage in the nightmarish Midwich Elementary School, the one in Nowhere in which the sound of lightbulbs bursting is heard (SH1), and the other in the nightmarish Hilltop Center with the Slurper in a cage (SH3). Since you cannot hear the ambience of a room through the door, and the radio does not pick up their presence through them either, the sounds often arrive in bursts.\n\nPlayful Design\n\nThe audiovisual qualities of Silent Hill have earned it much praise, as this eulogistic statement by Lorenzo Bassanelli demonstrates: “Silent Hill 2 is a fascinating, beautiful game. Through a series of courageous stylistic choices, the developers have created a game that is pure art” (2001). Many emotions based on the artifact are elicited along the journey. There is no doubt that the cinematographic comparison is in great part responsible for such enthusiasm. However, it is necessary to tell the seventh (cinema) and the tenth (video game) arts apart.\n\nAs Ewan Kirkland argues pertinently, Silent Hill “constitutes an extremely self-reflexive series, frequently acknowledging its videogame status and interrogating the medium as experience and text” (2007, 403), whose “aspects heighten rather than undermine the games' horror effect. The games encourage critical reflection upon aspects of videogaming, while maintaining a visceral hold on the player” (414). From the moment the terrifying dream starts, SH: Homecoming is seen as a recurrence of the other beginnings of the series. The pink bunny links SH: Homecoming's nightmare to the one in SH3 and SH4: The Room. The final revelation about Alex's journey to save his young brother seems to replay or copy James's to meet Mary. When you are aware of these parallels, Silent Hill is seen as a series, as a videoludic artifact. Is it necessary to say that, as a “re-imagining of the original Silent Hill that turns everything you thought you knew on its head” (Konami website),15 SH: Shattered Memories remains a true self-reflexive game (not like the play novel adaptation of SH1 on the Game Boy Advance in 2001)? You meet characters you got to know before and go to places you have already been, yet everything is changed from your memories. While the end credits are rolling, there is another self-reflexive twist in the story. Dr. Kaufman's Initial Assessment, which is typed, is not about Cheryl, but about the gamer. The final statement says: “Patient in a word: a ‘do-er'. So … summing up. Am sure patient will be back—lots of uncovered ground. Don't believe we've seen everything yet. Might be worth going back to the start and re-examining with benefit of what we know now. Think patient will agree!” This other statement is aimed at the replay value of SH: Shattered Memories: “The game watches you and adapts to your actions to create a unique experience to each player and intensify their fears” (Konami website). If your actions and answers to Dr. Kaufman's little therapy games change the way the characters appear, so will the locations the player character can access and the scenes you'll see. This design is also reminiscent of the ultimate goal of interactive fiction, which wanted to make the reader a writer of the story. Dr. Kaufman's sessions are referring me to the one conducted by Dr. Turner at the exit polls of each chapter of the interactive movie Tender Loving Care (Rob Landeros and David Wheeler, 1999). There too, the action is changed according to the ways you answer the questions, revolving in great part about sex (see Perron 2003).\n\nThe artifact emotions felt during a game are not only based on the awareness of its plot construction or the tours de force of its audio-vision, they also come from the consciousness of the operation of that intelligence behind the game design. The experience of SH: Shattered Memories can be pleasurable because it focuses “on escape and evasion rather than direct confrontation” (Konami website) as it is found in the classical formula of survival horror genre. In the same way, you can be delighted by the way the Wiimote enables you to move the flashlight. Another example of striking game design can be seen at the beginning of SH2, when James comes across a well and it turns out to be a save point. Knowing the convention of the survival horror genre where save points precede a new area or a difficult fight, you move on with some hesitation. However, you only end up encountering the harmless Angela in a cut-scene located in the graveyard. The apprehension is therefore developed through the gamer's horizon of expectations. It is the game that is thus seen as the artifact. Another assertion about SH2 from a review raises a significant issue:\n\nIt is possible that a game such as Silent Hill 2 puts forward another hypothesis, that of a mutation: rather than come to a standstill, cinema has been going on to find other spectators.... That a game rests, at this point, on its atmosphere, in other words on its aesthetic force, leaves no surprise, no obligation of result, performance, but a real experience of spectator, who will also be a bit director, free to go where he wants, see what he wants. SH is a slow game, frightening but also very beautiful, which makes of time a space where move our anguishes, a strange condensable or stretchable ribbon on demand.
