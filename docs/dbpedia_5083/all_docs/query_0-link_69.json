        "text": "CHAPTER 2\n\nCharacters' Nightmarish Delusions in a Resort Town\n\nSo what exactly happened to Silent Hill? That resides inside your imagination, and that is the truth about what fell on Silent Hill.\n\n—SH1 FAQ, Konami Tokyo official website, 1999\n\nFiction Emotions\n\nSH1 has been praised, not only for its new formal and gameplay features, but also for its story. As Pascal Luban points out in his article “Designing and Integrating Puzzles in Action-Adventure Games”:\n\n[A] story is at the heart of any adventure game, but the kind of story we look for in a [mixed] game like Silent Hill stands out in a unique way: in classical adventure games and in action-oriented games, the player controls the world; in mixed games, the world controls the player; he becomes the object of the game. The dramatic intensity of the narration is much stronger. (2002)\n\nThere is a secret plot behind Silent Hill: to target you, the intriguee, and control the order and pace of your discoveries and encounters. In order to accomplish this, Team Silent sticks to a fairly linear adventure, as compared to a RPG like Planescape Torment (Black Isle Studios / Interplay, 1999) as demonstrated by Diane Carr (2006, 59–71). The map of the city is marked and literally shows you where to go next. Apart from scattered, succinct in-game information, the storytelling takes place primarily out-of-game in cut-scenes that introduce the principal characters and unfold the narrative. On the one hand, the cut-scenes take control of your player character away from you and are “user-unfriendly,” as Richard Rouse characterized them (2001, 222).1 On the other hand, they allow you to see the action without the stress of gaming. They (re)introduce what Tanya Krzywinska relevantly underlines as a fundamental pleasure of the horror film: losing control (2002, 215–16).2\n\nThird-person story-driven games such as Silent Hill obviously create what Ed S. Tan calls “fiction emotions or F emotions.” At the plot level (this is different at the gameplay level, which is the subject of chapter 4), gamers get as much pleasure as spectators, by being allowed to freely observe other people.\n\nThe pleasure of observation and the pleasure of losing oneself in the fictional world may be considered two sides of the same coin. Viewers [and gamers] sojourn, in the imagination, in a fictional world where they run absolutely no risk; their fantasy is both encouraged and directed. The cognitive basis for this experience is the realization that one is in a fictional space. (Tan 1996, 33)\n\nIf the emotional experience originates from the fictional world and the concerns addressed by that world, it is also based on this safe involvement (no risk). Through the diegetic effect, that is, the illusion of being present in a fictional and virtual world, the gamer feels as if he were physically present in a real self-contained world that already exists before he gains access to it and as if he were witnessing the action taking place around him. But the gamer is in fact a “controlled witness” since the plot determines both the action taken by the characters and how this will be depicted. The notion of “interest” being the central emotional mechanism in such viewing, it keeps the gamer captivated through the plot.\n\nThe narrative provides the clues for the future structure of the story. The better the clues are utilized, the more valuable the anticipated final situation. The more I do my best to follow the structure of the story, to anticipate new information, to link various facts, and to watch for irony or hidden meanings, the greater will be my long-term reward in terms of structural order. The same is true for the affective investment: the more I sympathize with the protagonist in all her trials, try to imagine what she is feeling, and give her my unconditional support, the greater my enjoyment will be of the ultimate triumph, as well as of each little step that brings that triumph closer. (Tan 1996, 111)\n\nIf emotions can be characterized by an urge to act in a particular way until the episode is closed due to a change of situation (Tan 1996, 74–75), this action tendency—or tendency to establish, maintain, or disrupt a relationship with the environment—is only virtual at the plot level. You cannot grab a gun to defend the characters. You're forced to have an observational attitude in the noninteractive cut-scenes and in the various documents or notes you read. Fiction emotions emanate from the comparison of concentrated and magnified fictive events with the affective potential of comparable events in daily life. As Tan remarks:\n\nMost F emotions are empathetic because the action in the traditional feature film [and traditional action-adventure game] narration is realized by protagonists who display human traits and whose goals and fate are of interest to the film viewer [and gamer]. These include such emotions as hope and fear, anxiety, sympathy, pity, relief, gratitude, admiration, shame, anger, terror, joy, and sorrow. (1996, 82)\n\nThey are empathetic “to the extent that the significance that an event has for the character is part of the situational meaning structure” (1996, 174) for the gamer. There are also nonempathetic emotions, such as disgust and repulsion, for an action and all of the visual details that might accompany it.\n\nBefore paying special attention to the important empathetic emotions, I want to focus on the fictional world and then on the gamer's fictional emotions that are felt throughout the main story and especially when faced with monsters.\n\nThe Dark Side of a Resort Town\n\nThe town of Silent Hill is a main character in the series. As demonstrated in The Making of Silent Hill 2 (Beuglet 2001), the designers were able to re-create the look of a small American town3 using stills of real locations modeled into the game. Indeed, as the series composer Akira Yamaoka confesses, “The original Silent Hill was our attempt at making classic American horror through a Japanese filter” (Bettenhausen 2007a, 73; Yamaoka goes on to say, “And now with SH5 [Homecoming, developed by Double Helix Games], it's an American take on a Japanese-filtered American horror”).4 The town is described this way in a tourist pamphlet found by James (SH2) in apartment 104 of the Wood Side Apartments and also by Heather (SH3) in the Heaven's Night club (did James leave it there when he passed through the club with Maria?):\n\nWelcome to Silent Hill!\n\nSilent Hill, a quiet little lakeside resort town. We're happy to have you here. Row after row of quaint old houses, gorgeous mountain landscape, and a lake which shows different sides of its beauty with the passing of the day, from sunrise to late afternoons to sunset. Silent Hill will move you and fill you with a feeling of deep peace. I hope your time here will be pleasant and your memories will last forever. Editor: Roger Widmark.\n\nThe history of the town is recounted in a few documents found here and there. For instance, in the book entitled Lost Memories (found in a newspaper stand outside the Texxon Gas Station in SH2) you discover that previously “this town went by another name. But that name is now hopelessly lost in the veils of time. All we know is that there was another name, and that for some reason the town was once abandoned by its residents.”5 Later on, in 1880, the Brookhaven Hospital “was built in response to a great plague that followed a wave of immigration to this area” (memo at the hospital, SH2). Yet various pieces of information shade this factual history and the idealistic vision that James and Mary have of their “special place.” For example, a locally published magazine that James comes across in an office of the Toluca Prison indicates:\n\nToluca Lake, the town's main tourist attraction. This clear, beautiful lake has another side as well. It may seem like just a typical ghost story that you might find in any number of old towns across the country. But in this case, the legend is true. On a fog-bound November day in 1918, the Little Baroness, a ship filled with tourists, failed to return to port. A newspaper article from back then simply says “It most likely sunk for some reason.” Despite an extensive police search, not a single fragment of the ship nor any of the 14 bodies of passengers or crew has ever been recovered to this day. In 1939, an even stranger incident occurred.\n\n(There are many pages torn out)\n\nMany corpses rest at the bottom of this lake. Their bony hands reach up towards the boats that pass overhead. Perhaps they reach for their comrades. (SH2)\n\nLisa Garland, the nurse, also explains to Harry in a cut-scene:\n\nBefore this place was turned into a resort, the townspeople here were on the quiet side. Everyone followed some kind of queer religion; weird occult stuff, black magic, that kind of thing. As young people moved away, the people figured that they'd been summoned by the Gods....\n\nWhen several people connected with developing the town died in accidents, people said it was a curse. (SH1)\n\nThere is obviously something wrong with Silent Hill. When Harry comes to town, his initial remark is, “It's strange. It's quiet. Too quiet. This place is like a ghost town” (SH1). The first person he meets, police officer Cybil Benet, reaffirms that “something bizarre is going on.... The phones are all dead, and the radio, too.” The first person James meets before getting into Silent Hill, Angela Orosco, warns him: “I think you'd better stay away. This uh … this town … there's something … ‘wrong' with it. It's kind of hard to explain, but … And it's not just the fog either … It's …” (SH2). On their way to find Claudia, Douglas the detective, not knowing that Heather was born and raised there, says, “That's one screwed up town” (SH3). Crossing Toluca Lake on a boat in order to get to Silent Hill and to the last part of the journey, Deputy Wheeler tells the player character Alex Shepherd and his childhood friend Elle Holloway that “this place has bad history. Always has” (SH: Homecoming).6\n\nMasashi Tsuboyama's notion of “strangeness,” as employed in his discussion regarding the general atmosphere of the games, is evoked upon the discovery of a town that has been completely deserted by its inhabitants (the normal ones in any case) and plunged into mist and darkness and where it's snowing out of season.7 As opposed to the nightmarish side, you can feel frightened and stifled in the normal side of Silent Hill because you can compare the game situation with typical everyday experiences and then imagine what it might be like. Anyone who has woken up early and wandered through empty streets might remember the strange feeling. They might recall the sudden distress felt at an evening power failure that causes the house to fall into complete darkness. Anyone who has walked or driven into a thick fog may have felt alone and anxious about what could appear in his or her field of vision. We might all have made slow progress in badly lit corridors or space, or have navigated damp and gloomy concrete underpasses, either with or without dripping water. One may have visited or seen dilapidated abandoned buildings with torn wallpaper and broken ceramic tiles, and so on. Additionally, the fictional and virtual environment of the Silent Hill series exploits all the experiential potential of claustrophobic spaces. You always move downward and deeper underground or are flung into an abyss. You ride elevators down, use many tight, steep staircases, climb down many ladders, and jump into a few black holes. These descents lead to murky basements, creepy sewers, disorienting labyrinths and catacombs, an old prison built during the Civil War, or a deserted subway station; but most important of all: they lead to an Otherworld.\n\nMany everyday places of Silent Hill are turned into a nightmarish world: the Midwich Elementary School (SH1), the Alchemilla (SH1 and SH: Origins) and Brookhaven (SH2 and SH3) hospitals, the shopping district area (SH1), the Lake View Hotel (SH2), the Riverside Motel (SH: Origins), the Central Square Shopping Center and the Hilltop Center (SH3, not in Silent Hill though), the Lakeside Amusement Park (SH1 and SH3), the Artaud Theater (SH: Origins), and the church (SH3). During these sequences of delusion, art director Masahiro Ito and sound director Akira Yamaoka take advantage of all the traditional horror images and ambiences to create Tan's primary nonempathetic emotions, namely disgust and repulsion. You hear all kinds of industrial and creepy sounds. Streets or floors are replaced by rusty grates over a bottomless abyss and are full of holes (into which Heather can fall). Walls and floors are spattered with blood or covered with streaks of blood. They even bleed, swarm, and burn like glowing embers in real-time in SH3, for the first time in the video game industry, as Yukinori Ojina the program director asserts (in Beuglet 2003). Walls turn into rusty plates and fences or are padded as in a madhouse, while paint falls from them (as in SH: Homecoming, an effect inspired by the film). The rooms are wrecks. Chains are hanging from the ceiling in the elementary school. Classrooms are furnished with a few metal chairs and large tables. Sinks and toilets overflow with blood. Dolls and dead bodies are crucified on the walls. Objects are located in strange places, for instance, the broken wheelchair (seen throughout the series) that Harry finds for the first time in the lobby of the elementary school and the gurneys containing bloodstained corpses that Heather sees in the shopping mall. The most repulsive images are to be found in SH3: a particularly striking representation is the figure of a mother holding her baby with her womb cut open who is situated in the ECHO Interiors & Floor Fashions of the Hilltop Center (fig. 2).\n\nOne of the main features of gameplay is the navigation through space; therefore the attraction of a labyrinthine town is without doubt enormous.\n\nHowever, the role of Silent Hill is even more important in the series. In interviews, Akihiro Imamura usually gives the same answer to this question:\n\nIGN: Have any films or filmmakers inspired the creepy atmosphere you're hoping to achieve with Silent Hill 2?\n\nIMAMURA: Certainly David Lynch. His style has influenced the series, especially Silent Hill 2. Twin Peaks is one of my personal favourites. (Keeling 2001)\n\nAlthough he has moderated his preference for David Lynch by saying in an interview: “With Silent Hill, I usually mention his name since he is a popular director and is easy to relate to for the non-Japanese audience. But I am not particularly limiting myself to just his films” (Sato 2001). It is difficult to avoid a comparison with Lynch's work and his TV series Twin Peaks (1990–91). Twin Peaks is the name of a picturesque American town in the rural Northwest. Its peace and order are disrupted when the high-school homecoming queen, Laura Palmer, is murdered. The investigation FBI agent Dale Cooper conducts brings to light the fact that the inhabitants are not what they appear to be. The town is not as typical as it seems. Legends draw attention to other worlds where the spirits inhabit (the White and the Black Lodges). The inquiry finally reveals a supernatural evil spirit in the town, Bob, a parasite requiring a human host and feeding itself on fear and pleasures.8 This quick summary outlines some of the similarities between the plots of Silent Hill and Twin Peaks. Lorenzo Bassanelli, the editor in chief of Ps2Fantasy.com, emphasizes the connection.\n\nI see Twin Peaks as the most important source of inspiration for Silent Hill—the setting, the fact that the city becomes a “metamorphic creature” mirroring the soul of the population of the town and … the fact that the whole story is after all a voyage of the “detective” towards insanity, self-destruction, “death.” (Personal correspondence, 2003)\n\nAs the “Lost Memories” appendix of the Japanese version of Silent Hill 3 Strategy Guide states: “The town has indeed become a great catalyst for the manifestation of people's unconscious minds. It appears to have become a place that beckons to those who hold darkness in their hearts.” Silent Hill is really a fictional environment, not only for the gamer but also for the characters themselves, characters that call into question the existence of the Otherworld and are not sure to grasp the status of the terrorizing worlds (real and unreal) surrounding them. As Imamura explains: “The town of Silent Hill has a mysterious force. It exerts influence on people, and the town shows a world which you cannot distinguish from nightmare or reality. Why does the town exert such force? No one has yet discovered the cause” (Davison 2001, 126). The ambiguity about what's happening in Silent Hill results in an opened space of understanding and interpretation.\n\nA Play of Ratiocination\n\nIt is always amazing to think that some gamers (those who do not have to engage in “play research” as scholars) are reducing their free time of play in order to write walkthroughs for the benefit of others. But it is even more fascinating to realize that others are so passionate about games (Resident Evil at the front for survival horror) that they analyze and theorize about the plots. In regards to Silent Hill, I share the astonishment of Daragh Sankey in “Fear, Art and Silent Hill”:\n\nThe vagueness and ambiguity unsettles the player and adds to the tension, but it also means that a great deal of possible “readings” are possible with this game. While poring through long-forgotten Silent Hill fan sites, I came across some of the most outlandish interpretations of the game's meaning. I think it's incredible that console gamers could somehow be motivated to take flights of hermeneutical fancy normally reserved for scholars' analyses of Finnegans Wake or Guernica. (Sankey 2001)\n\nExamples of such works are found at the Silent Hill Wiki9 and in the lengthy and deep plot analyses of Dan Birlew, Duncan Bunce, and others.10 And this is not to mention the numerous discussions in Silent Hill forums, with topics entitled “I think we've been going about this all wrong (SH's plot),” “About Alessa's father,” “Is James real or is it all imagination?” “The town's metaphysics,” “God is not Samael,” “The theory to end all theories,” and so on.11 According to the quotation from the Konami website, which is used as an epigraph to this chapter, the games are definitely open to numerous theories and interpretations. Following Marc C. Santos and Sarah E. White in “Playing with Ourselves: A Psychoanalytic Investigation of Resident Evil and Silent Hill,” such openness leads to a hermeneutic pleasure “based on our need to perceive things in terms of ‘ordered' narration. As we experience a narrative's linear progression, we anticipate the unity of its conclusion—the tying together of its disparate lines. We experience hermeneutic pleasure as mysteries are solved and ambiguities clear up” (2005, 70). However, as soon as gamers recognize the complexity and depth of Silent Hill's plots and start to reflect on them, like the aforementioned exegetes, their pleasures are not rooted as much in the stories themselves and the fate of characters who are struggling to understand both their past and what is happening to them, but in the narrative construction itself. Their emotions are not fictional but instead are based on the artifact (I'll address these type of emotions in the next chapter). Therefore, instead of exploring these interpretative avenues in detail again (the various theories can be researched easily on the Web), I would rather look at Silent Hill in light of Noël Carroll's thoughts about the horror genre in his seminal book The Philosophy of Horror or Paradoxes of the Heart. These ideas are strikingly useful in explaining the ins and outs of the genre while linking to the analysis I wish to make.\n\nAs the philosopher Mark Vorobej underlines in “Monsters and the Paradox of Horror,” Carroll's curiosity theory has often been criticized for good reasons, particularly because it does not conceptualize fear as the core of horror. However, in his discussion of the fact that Carroll only takes into account cognitive engagement, Vorobej has foreshadowed an important developmental consideration in his emphasis on the imaginative dimension of horror fiction: “The curiosity theory yet may survive … in some mutated form by locating the central source of pleasure in our imaginative speculations about what monsters might be like.... Horror monsters exist, in large measure, in order to be destroyed” (1997, 238). Survival horror and terror games such as Silent Hill represent, precisely, this mutated form.\n\nCarroll's account of horror involves essential reference to an entity: the monster. The art-horror he describes is a reaction to monsters. Monsters are defined “as abnormal, as a disturbance of the natural order” (1990, 15), “as unclean and disgusting” (21), as “any being not believed to exist now according to contemporary science” (27). Essentially, horrific monsters have two characteristics (42–43).\n\nFirst, they are threatening. They are dangerous in two ways: (1) physically by being lethal or by their power to maim, and (2) psychologically by destroying one's identity, morally by seeking to destroy moral order, or socially by trying to advance an alternative society—this way is the icing on the cake, says Carroll. The monsters of Silent Hill (like all survival horror monsters) are meant to be frightening. They execute many lethal and maiming actions. Alone or in groups, they jump on you, lunge at you, make you fall on the ground, hit you, bite you, grab you, hang you, eat you, stab you, sting you, choke you, shoot you, spit at you, fire at you, shoot lightning strikes at you, and so on. As noted in chapter 1, witnessing these attacks is enhanced by the third-person perspective. With the exception of the accidental moves in SH3, which can periodically cause Heather to fall off an edge or drop into a hole, it's the monsters' attack that ends the game. While inhabiting Silent Hill and seeking out player characters (this is not a Mystlike world), the challenge is to survive these monsters. Although you can run away from many of them, you cannot escape the boss monsters—you cannot if you wish to carry on your quest and continue to fall into the abyss of the player characters' tortured souls. Unlike fiction where the question is “whether the creature can be destroyed” (Carroll 1990, 182), the player characters absolutely must destroy them or, for the Pyramid Head(s) of SH2, hold out long enough to make them kill themselves.\n\nSecond, the monsters are “impure,” thus disgusting. Generated by an interstitiality, that is, a conflict between two or more standing cultural categories, the creatures transgress distinctions such as inside/outside, living/dead, insect/human, flesh/machine, and animate/inanimate. Beings that are already potentially disturbing, they can also be further exaggerated, as is the case of the giants roaches in SH2 or the swarms of SH: Homecoming. The monsters of Silent Hill display a high degree of impurity. In SH1 they transgress, in a way that is still classical, the living/dead and beast/human categories. Many bosses are magnified and impure insects; this is the case of Amnion, the final one of SH: Homecoming. But to our delight, we must admit that they have evolved away from the typical monsters. Imamura remarks:\n\nThe reason why the designs of the monsters are different between Silent Hill 1 and 2 is that in the first version they were made to reflect the psyche of a sick little girl, so I made the monsters as symbolic butterflies and destructive bugs. For the second game, they are a reflection of one man's insane, twisted mentality. (Mackman 2001)\n\nMasahiro Ito, the designer of the monsters in SH1, SH2, and SH3, has found a perfect way to disgust you: “Ito's secret is that he refuses to use elements that are too far removed from the human being. His monsters don't have horns or tentacles; their weapons consist only of deformed human appendages. Here, a head that attacks. There, swollen heavy arms” (Beuglet 2003).12 The mutations of SH2 and SH3 do not lead to biotech monstrosities or call upon old demons. They bring out grotesque horrible humanoid creatures, yet not quite the classical zombies. In keeping with the medical origins of the delusions,13 the majority of the foes look like they are disabled beings. They transgress categorical distinctions, but if they have some originality, it's because their main interstitiality is between the unborn and the dead. As much as they might look like they are already dead (for example, the Insane Cancers of SH3 with their soured flesh and the Smogs of SH: Homecoming with tumors sprouting all over their body), they simultaneously appear to have been born at a very early embryonic stage. They do not have faces yet (not even the Nurses); parts of their bodies like arms and hands are not formed (the Patient Demons in flesh straitjackets of SH2 and SH: Origins, the Numb Bodies of SH3); they have various malformations and deformities (the Underhangers of SH2, the Closers and Slurpers of SH3); their walk is dubious; and so on.\n\nThese two monsters' characteristics enable the horror genre to elicit the proper emotions. In a subsequent essay about film where he compares the emotional response to suspense, horror, and melodrama, Carroll comes to this conclusion:\n\nThe horror analyst will attend to the way in which the monster is structured to bring properties in accordance with the criteria of harm and impurity to the fore, and to the way the plot affords opportunities both to allow the monster to display these properties and to permit human characters an occasion to talk about and to describe them. (1999, 46)\n\nAt one point, the characters of Silent Hill effectively end up questioning both the nature and presence of the monsters. Upon Harry's arrival at the examination room of the Alchemilla Hospital in SH1, Dr. Michael Kaufman wonders about the Flying Reptile that had made its way inside and that he has just killed. He says: “Something's gone seriously wrong. Did you see those monsters? Have you ever seen such aberrations? Ever even heard of such things? You and I both know, creatures like that don't exist!” In SH2, James often makes quick references to the monsters and even asks Eddie, during their first encounter, if he was a “friend with that red, pyramid thing.” Sick on the floor, Eddie answers that he doesn't know what James is talking about, but says, “I did see some weird-lookin' monsters. They scared the hell outta me.” The monsters are repulsive and generate nonempathetic emotions. Because their abnormality is linked to our human nature, they are in a good position to kindle our imaginative speculations. As Vorobej observes, “The true object of fascination in horror is ourselves, and the human condition in general. Battling monsters is a highly veiled odyssey of self-exploration. A monster's description must be significantly inchoate if each of us is to imprint his or her personal psychic concerns on the fiction” (1997, 239). The imprint has a particular overtone in SH3 during a chat between Heather and Vincent, a priest of the Order, in the church's library:\n\nVINCENT: You're the worst person in this room. You come here and enjoy spilling their blood and listening to them cry out. You feel excited when you step on them, snuffing out their lives.\n\nHEATHER: Are you talking about the monsters?\n\nVINCENT: Monsters…? They look like monsters to you? (Heather grumbles.) Don't worry, it's just a joke.\n\nThe characters in Silent Hill certainly see the monsters from their own emotional and moral viewpoints.14 The scenario writer Hiroyuki Owaku has commented, “Some philosophies explain that what you see is not necessarily reality. What you are seeing may not be what I'm seeing. The same is true of the monsters that you encounter in the game.... Maybe they are human beings just like you, maybe even your neighbors. What you see might be true or false” (in Beuglet 2003). This duality always introduces a certain amount of doubt about what is being seen, as well as some bewilderment regarding the “undeniable ‘kill to survive' motivation” at the core of horror games (as noted by Rouse [2009], quoted in the previous chapter).\n\nAs important as it may seem, the monster does not exist for its own sake. The paradox of horror, is for Carroll, sorted out this way: “In order to account for the interest we take in and the pleasure we take from horror, we may hypothesize that, in the main, the locus of our gratification is not the monster as such but the whole narrative structure in which the presentation of the monster is staged” (1990, 181). Although curiosity drives most narratives, the horror story is explicitly driven by it “because it has at the center of it something which is in principle unknowable” (182). Knowledge and discovery are important themes, and suspense a key narrative element. “Most horror stories, including the most distinguished ones, tend to be elaborated in such way that the discovery of the unknown (voluntarily or otherwise), the play of ratiocination, and the drama of proof are sustaining sources of narrative pleasure in the horror genre” (126). Therefore, Carroll states, “The disgust that [the horrific monsters] evince might be seen as part of the price to be paid for the pleasure of their disclosure” (184). To reiterate, his curiosity theory has been discussed comprehensively; but in regard to survival horror and Silent Hill, his comments may be viewed in a new light.\n\nTo begin with, and it is the most obvious change that needs to be underlined at once, the video game literally involves a cognitive engagement, a play of ratiocination. At the gameplay level, the incursion of the monsters into the world of the characters serves, again referring to Vorobej (1997, 225), as a catalyst for challenging exercises in decision making, reasoning, and problem solving. While they get your adrenaline pumping, and place the lives of the player characters you control in the game world in peril, the monsters make the experiential route of fear more difficult since the exploratory narrative structure of games requires you to walk through the terrifying world and to search and locate hints in order to reach different places where the story will be progressing. Carroll talks about the “drama of corridors” (1990, 38), and this expression applies quite well to the maze structure of adventure video games and, referring to Henry Jenkins's “Game Design as Narrative Architecture,” to the “pre-structured but embedded within the mise-en-scene awaiting discovery” (Jenkins 2004, 126). As Ewan Kirkland demonstrates in “Storytelling in Survival Horror Video Games” using as an example the SH: Origins's level at the Cedar Grove Sanitarium (2009, 68), the stories of Silent Hill and of horror games really have to be reconstructed from scattered narrative information and brief encounters or events. However, inasmuch as we may agree with Vorobej when he asserts that “the play of ratiocination within horror rarely becomes that innovative, complex, or abstract” (1997, 235), we must also recognize that the Silent Hill series is an exception; SH: Origins, SH1, and SH3 form a whole consisting of interconnected parts.\n\nThe Tortured Soul(s)\n\nSH: Origins begins on a road at night when the trucker Travis Grady—the player character—takes a shortcut past Silent Hill in order to get to Brahms in time. When he sees a figure suddenly emerge on the road, he brakes and immobilizes his truck to look for it. He doesn't find it, but he does see the reflection of young girl in his truck mirror. Subsequently the girl, Alessa Gillespie, appears before him for the sole purpose of dragging him out to her burning house just in time to rescue her. Travis collapses after his heroic action, only to awaken later on a street bench in the foggy town. From this point onward, the play of ratiocination of SH: Origins is about the destiny of those two characters, currently linked to one another.\n\nBy going off in search of the burned child, Travis uncovers his tragic past. During his lengthy exploration of the Cedar Grove Sanitarium, he discovers that his mother, Helen Grady, has been incarcerated in the sanitarium. She had tried to kill him when he was young because, as she says in an audiotape reel, the “people in the mirrors … saw the devil inside of him.”15 It is further revealed, in an incident report found in the Storage Room, that the young Travis had attempted to enter the sanitarium to see his mom, but was taken by his dad. When he reaches the Riverside Motel, the place is somewhat familiar to him because when he was young he had sojourned there with his father (while visiting his mother, we can infer). As a matter of fact, Richard Grady committed suicide (a result of depression) in Room 503 of the motel and was found by Travis. Similar to the earlier moment when Travis is going to see his “momma” (one of the bosses like his father), the discovery of the suicide is shown in a flashback—or a delusion. It elicits fiction emotions related to a boy's heartbreaking childhood. This is obviously also true for Alessa, as her childhood elicits similar fiction emotions.\n\nAs a prequel, SH: Origins presents the first stage of the subsequent events and introduces supporting characters like Dr. Kaufman and nurse Lisa Garland. If Travis rescues Alessa from the fire, he doesn't necessarily save her from the Order, which is the religious cult that her mother Dahlia Gillespie belongs to. Dahlia attempted to burn her child to give birth to a new God (the mother is seen at the beginning while the house is in fire). Alessa's tortured soul uses Travis as a “pawn”—as Dr. Kaufman phrases it at the end—to find the five different pieces (Future, Past, Falsehood, Truth, and Present) of the Flauros. The Flauros is a pyramidal device that provides the “ability to control and amplify thought” and is considered to be “a weapon left by angels as a force of good” (according to a yellowed page found at the Green Lion Antique Shop). In order to accomplish this goal, Alessa allows Travis to cross to the Otherworld through mirrors, lets him fight his demons to get the first four pieces of the Flauros in the Halo of the Sun (the cult's official seal), appears to him as an innocent little girl, and then brings him back to the misty world by wailing the now famous siren call that makes him fall unconscious (as Harry will also do in SH1). In fact, as Dahlia tells Travis in the Cedar Grove Sanitarium, he should not have trusted Alessa, who is supposedly dead according to the nurse, Lisa Garland. Because she brings into play the Flauros to liberate her power over the town, Silent Hill is transformed into the Otherworld. Alessa finally guides Travis to the location where the Order is conducting a ritual over her burned body, which is being kept alive. Travis at last faces, not a god, but the Demon contained in the Flauros. He enables Alessa to give birth to a newborn. In the Good Ending, after Travis gets back into his truck and leaves Silent Hill, we hear Harry Mason and his wife find the baby girl and say “Cheryl. We'll call her Cheryl.”\n\nSH1 starts like SH: Origins. Harry Manson is on his way to Silent Hill for a vacation, with his daughter Cheryl (his wife died of a disease that “has left a shadow over his shoulder”—manual). Harry sees a figure on the road. To avoid it, he swerves, consequently running his vehicle off the road. When he wakes up behind the wheel, his daughter is missing. Reaching town, he starts to follow a figure, which looks like Cheryl. SH1's plot takes an important twist upon Dahlia Gillespie's entrance into the Silent Hill's Balkan Church. Harry is to follow the guidance of Dahlia that tells him he has to stay on a straight and narrow path. What looked like a simple quest to find his daughter in a ghost town turns out to be much more complicated. It becomes a drama of proof. Not only does Harry have to fight the monsters—and the town of Silent Hill can be seen as one of those—it's now necessary for him to identify where the horror comes from, and to demonstrate that there are more things on earth than the acknowledged ones. The terror will be long lasting due to the true evil spirit, who is not only physically threatening via her monstrous creations, but also (icing on the cake!) psychologically dangerous. For Harry (you), the play of ratiocination is quite complex. Four main lines of approach have to be taken into account:\n\n1. The identity of the young woman whom Harry saw and avoided on the road in the opening cut-scene at the start of the game. This encounter initiates the following events. He sees the figure again in the boiler room when he encounters trouble and then again when the Midwich Elementary School resumes normalcy. Going where Dahlia says to go, Harry also glimpses the figure entering the Antique Shop and then again leaving the roof of the Lighthouse. He also finds a picture of the young woman, Alessa, in a room in the hospital's secret basement.\n\n2. The status of Harry's “living nightmare” (as Lisa Garland names it on their first encounter). Harry often asks if he's dreaming. He tries to make sense of it, but the world turns upside down when he has mysterious headaches and passes out (compared to SH: Origins, he does not control the moments when he goes to the Otherworld). It's like “some kind of hallucination,” he says after the police officer Cybil Bennett reveals information about the drug trafficking (is he drugged after all?).\n\n3. The evil presence in the town. On their first encounter, Dahlia Gillespie talks about a cage of peace, the Flauros, which can break through the walls of darkness, and counteract the wrath of the underworld. On their second meeting, she talks about the town being devoured by darkness, childish sleep talk, and the crest of Samael, which is evident all over town (the one Harry found the first time in the school's courtyard). Later on, Lisa Garland reveals the existence of the cult in Silent Hill.\n\n4. The drug market. In the Antique Shop, Cybil explains the “darkness devouring the town” by a reference to a drug trafficking. According to a note found in the police station, the drug is made of a plant peculiar to the region called “White Claudia.” The investigation is stalled and the dealers are still at large (according to the newspaper in The Jack's Inn office).\n\nOne important key to the mystery is given to Harry on the bridge of Sandford Street in the resort area. The real world turns into the Otherworld, but “this time it feels different. Rather than shifting from reality to a nightmare, this is more like reality becoming a nightmare.” Harry realizes that the whole town is invaded “by a world of someone's nightmarish delusions com[ing] to life,” as he says to Cybil at the boathouse just before Dahlia Gillespie meets up with them. After Dahlia's speech about the end of the world, Harry still follows her instructions and finally gets a handle on the demon he was running after. The figure of the young woman is Alessa, Dahlia's own daughter who was burned in the house fire seven years ago. Yet it is also Cheryl, the second half of Alessa's soul. Dahlia untangles the enigma in the final scene:\n\nFor the seven years following that terrible day, Alessa has been kept alive, suffering a fate worse than death. Alessa has been trapped in an endless nightmare from which she never wakens. He [our God] has been nurtured by that nightmare. Waiting for the day to be born. That day has finally come. The time is nigh. Everyone will be released from pain and suffering. Our salvation is at hand. This is the day of reckoning When all our sorrows will be washed away. When we return to the true paradise. My daughter will be the mother of God!\n\nBut everything doesn't go as planned. A god is born, but he kills Dahlia before Harry kills him (the final boss). In the Good Ending,16 Alessa comes back to give yet another newborn to Harry, who then runs down the road into the night with the baby in his arms.\n\nUltimately, Dahlia Gillespie is in fact the real monster of SH: Origins and SH1, one who is both socially and morally dangerous. Her queer religion, it could be construed, has completely displaced the path to deliverance and salvation. To understand this, it is relevant to turn to Rockett:\n\nThe threats to survival, the things to be feared lurking just beyond the rim of firelight in the cave, are the first to be assigned First Causes—demonic ones. Only thereafter, when deliverance or survival is achieved, does one cast about for something to thank. One gives a name to this unseen First Cause of one's joy: that of the Deity. Later, this name is extended beyond the source of deliverance to the source of all goodness. (1988, 10)\n\nWhat's more, there is a symbiosis between the demonic and the divine: “Without evil to be dreaded, then overcome, goodness would remain unrecognizable. In turn, the demonic requires the divine to explain why the triumph of the demonic in the affairs of men is not complete” (Rockett 1988, 10). Accordingly, Dahlia and the cult have completely mixed up this mutuality by trying to return to the true paradise through fear, hate, and an endless nightmare, by releasing everyone's pain and suffering by worshiping Samael, the Prince of the demons, the angel of death.17 As for the ambiguity about the monsters (“They look like monsters to you?”), there also remains an ambivalence about this Supreme Being that is clearly introduced in SH3 during the exchange, quoted earlier, between Heather and Vincent in the church's library:\n\nHEATHER: Yeah, you're on Claudia's side.\n\nVINCENT: I told you not to put me in the same category as that mad woman.\n\nHEATHER: Well you're pretty loony yourself.\n\nVINCENT: It's true that we believe in the same god, but I'm quite sane.\n\nHEATHER: So why did you help me out then? Was that also part of trying to resurrect god?\n\nVINCENT: It's not uncommon for people to worship the same god and still disagree.\n\nHEATHER: “God”? Are you sure you don't mean “Devil”?\n\nVINCENT: Whichever you like.\n\nFor that matter, the plot of SH3 is based even more strongly on a wicked and contradictory fusion. The Good Ending of SH1 is definitely the logical link between the two (I'll deal with SH2 in a separate section).\n\nMuch more quickly, but exactly like the entrance of Dahlia Gillespie in SH1, the encounter of Heather Manson—the player character—with Claudia Wolf (wasn't the hallucinogenic plant called “White Claudia”?) triggers the play of ratiocination in SH3. Claudia, speaking about the monsters, states that “they've come to witness the Beginning,” “the rebirth of Paradise, despoiled by mankind.” And about the heroine: “Don't you know? Your power is needed.... I am Claudia.... Remember me, and your true self as well. Also, that which you must become. The one who will lead us to Paradise with blood stained hands.” Consequently, she puts five questions18 to Heather (the gamer). Those questions revolve around Heather's identity and her perceptions: (1) What's going on with all those monsters around? (2) Are the sinister transformations of places and the occurrence of nightmarish events real or only a dream? (3) Who is Claudia, whom Heather should recall? (4) What “true self” does she have to remember? and (5) What does she have to become?\n\nHeather discovers the first clue about who she is when, in the nightmarish Green Ridge Mental Health Clinic, she comes across a picture of herself with a note written on the back: “Find the Holy One. Kill her?” When she arrives home Heather discovers that it is not her who will be murdered but her father. This is portrayed through a very emotional cut-scene. Claudia had Heather's father killed for two reasons; first, for revenge because he took Heather away from them (the cult) 17 years ago and, second, to fill Heather's heart with hatred because she will give birth to a god and build an eternal Paradise. At this important turning point in the plot, you learn that her father is Harry Mason, the one who killed the god Dahlia Gillespie tried to summon. Heather is revealed to be the baby that Harry received from Alessa and subsequently fled town with. A return to Silent Hill then becomes inevitable. The drama of proof ends at a church. Heather finds the answers to her queries. She learns who Claudia is: a close friend of hers in the cult, with whom she played cards in her room and to whom she gave a sixth-birthday card, writing in it that she loved her as if she was her real sister. She truly confronts the reality that she was Alessa (and Cheryl), upon finding her dad's diary and her school desk. Being Alessa/Cheryl, she still has a god to give birth to. But as for SH1, everything doesn't go as planned. Following the Good Ending of SH1, the Normal Ending of SH3 shows the death of Claudia and the killing of the god that has been nurtured with hate.\n\nScenario writers Hiroyuki Owaku (SH1 and SH3) and Sam Barlow (SH: Origins) have crafted an intricate plot, a prime driving force for the game-play. Even though many details of the play of ratiocination have here been left out, my intention was to demonstrate how the main story of the series keeps the gamer interested and intrigued until the end, and how it creates fiction emotions. This is, to a large part, accomplished via the relationships between the characters.\n\nInvolved in the Drama\n\nThe main protagonists of Silent Hill have drawn attention from reviewers and gamers on account of the fact that they are not the expected hero types found in many other games such as Alone in the Dark, Resident Evil, Parasite Eve, or Onimusha: Warlords (Flagship / Capcom 2001). In SH: Origins, Travis Grady is an ordinary trucker with a troubled past (manual). In SH1, Harry Mason is a thirty-two-year-old writer (manual) and “only a tourist,” he says as he introduces himself to the police officer, Cybil.\n\nPerhaps what really makes the game [SH1] so believable is how incredibly ordinary the main character is and how realistic the town is. Harry is just an average guy. He can't aim a gun very well, he can't run that fast, and he reacts to situations in ways that you might react to them yourself. He pants heavily after running for a while, he occasionally trips, and during the remarkable Full Motion Animation sequences, his face displays some very distinct facial expressions. When Harry is wounded, the dual shock controller vibrates to simulate Harry's heartbeat. With this little trick at work, you'll feel like you ARE Harry. With all his little shortcomings and his humanitarian attitude, Harry is probably the easiest game character for people to identify with of all time. (Broas 1999)\n\nIn SH3, Heather is just an ordinary girl, with a bit of a sharp tongue and quick temper (manual) which set her apart from the more frail or innocent heroines of Fatal Frame, Clock Tower 3, or Rule of Rose (Punchline / SCEI 2006).\n\nShe's not a cop or a special agent, not some oversexed cartoon, and certainly not much of a badass. Truth is, she looks pretty awkward and uncomfortable, especially the first time she holds a gun. The fact that a computer-generated character can actually look “awkward and uncomfortable” at all is some kind of tribute to the game's designers, whom from the beginning have made a point of giving us ever more human and believable heroes. It makes the ensuing darkness and horror all the more threatening by contrast … and creators Akira Yamaoka and Masahiro Ito damn well know it. (Hudak 2003)\n\nThe protagonists of Silent Hill's main story are unquestionably not “super-powered avatars, spring loaded by uncanny fallout and armed to expiate” (Carr 2006, 71). As Broas's review maintains, this distinction certainly allows for a better identification with the protagonist. However, having followed Tan's and Carroll's theories, it is impossible not to put this notion into perspective, as succinct as it may be (since this is also the object of a large debate).19 For both of them, one cannot talk about identification since the emotional state of the character and the viewer, or the gamer, is not identical. For Carroll, one “can assimilate the internal evaluation of the [horrific] situation without becoming, so to speak, possessed by [the protagonist]” (1990, 95). In Tan's terms, “The situational meaning for the viewer [and the gamer] always contains, in addition to the situational meaning for the protagonist, an element of spectacle” (1996, 190). You can actively explore what it is like to be the protagonist in a particular situation, but you'll never be the protagonist. The exploration always depends upon your own experience. A gamer that has a young daughter may be more inclined to have a more comprehensive understanding of Harry's search for Cheryl and experience more intense fiction emotions. The notion of empathy refers to this activity. As Tan states, “Empathy calls up expectations about what a particular character is going to do and how he or she will react to events. These expectations are cognitive investments. Affective investments consist mainly of feelings of sympathy for the protagonist” (1996, 192). The action has to generate an increase in empathetic emotions, such as feeling fear with Travis, Harry, Heather, and James, rather than sympathetic emotional responses you may also feel fear for the protagonists.20 To elicit the fiction emotions, Silent Hill confines its narration to only what the main protagonists know, that is, to the restricted narration so characteristic of investigation stories. With the exception of Cybil being attacked on her way to the amusement park, which is shown quickly, you follow Harry step by step in SH1. You do the same with Travis in SH: Origins. The only moment in SH2 where James is not present is during the short conversation between Laura and Eddie at Pete's Bowl-O-Rama, which is not of great importance. SH3 infringes upon this restriction by showing two important scenes Heather doesn't witness: (1) the conversation between Claudia and Vincent in the room at Jack's Inn (the conversation took place on Heather's arrival, which reveals that Vincent is lying to her); (2) the encounter between Claudia and Detective Cartland at the Lakeside Amusement Park where you learn that Claudia lied to the detective. Also, the final confrontation between Claudia and Vincent begins just prior to Heather's entrance. In this instance, you have more information than Heather and therefore may feel differently than she may be expected to feel.\n\nWhile, Tan states, empathetic emotions may be complex, you are often made to empathize with a character by simply seeing what he or she is seeing. You do not always have to delve into the innermost feelings of the characters (1996, 198). Nevertheless, Silent Hill prompts the gamer to do this. Because both the perceptions and the sanity of the protagonist you control are uncertain, the psychological dimension runs much deeper than the empathetic fears created by the frightening atmosphere. When Travis regains consciousness in the lobby of the Alchemilla Hospital and meets the nurse, Lisa, who finds him to be a bit shaken up, Travis says the fire might have boiled his brain a little. As for Harry, he wakes up twice in the beginning of SH1, first in his car after the crash where he finds out Cheryl has disappeared, then in the Cafe 5to2 after he is killed by monsters in the narrow alley where, strangely, it gets dark. These awakenings blur the limits between what's real and what's not, and they have to be explained by a detour that cannot be ignored. As Takayoshi Sato, character designer and CGI creator for SH1 and SH2, observes:\n\nMost people working for game companies are game freaks, but the Silent Hill team are artists and programmers first—mainly artists. Silent Hill 2 is not a typical game because most of our staff didn't grow up playing games. Because of this, we hope to provide the gamer with a different sort of game. (Perry 2001b)\n\nIn interviews, Team Silent made more references to movies than to games. Of those references, one film is fundamental: Jacob's Ladder.\n\nAdrian Lyne's movie (1990) tells the story of Jacob (Tim Robbins), an American soldier who is returning from Vietnam after a shocking battle experience. His life becomes a nightmare when the subway, and later a car, almost runs over him, when faceless humanoid creatures (resembling those found in Silent Hill) pursue him, and when his doctor and a brother in arms are killed. After various delirious states and dreams within dreams, he suspects that he has been used as a military guinea pig, a human subject in an army experiment. Upon this assumption, he attempts to discover the truth. He finds out about a drug called “the Ladder” that increases aggressive tendencies, which was tested on his battalion. Eventually, the viewer learns in a final sudden twist that the whole film was a hallucination. Jacob had actually died on an operating table in Vietnam and had never returned home. Depending upon how the viewer reacts to this odd ending, Jacob's Ladder is either a great or a terrible film. Among the many reviews of the movie, Roger Ebert's is very enlightening:\n\nMaking a chart of the real and the imagined is not the point of “Jacob's Ladder,” anyway. This movie is the portrait of a mental state.... Most films tell stories. “Jacob's Ladder” undoubtedly contains a story, which can be extracted with a certain amount of thought. (Since the ending can be read in two different ways, however, the extraction process could result in two different stories). That isn't the point. What “Jacob's Ladder” really wants to do is to evoke the feeling of a psychological state in the audience. We are intended to feel what the hero feels. (Ebert 1990)\n\nAllusions—and I'm aware that I'm one foot in the artifact territory dealt with in the next chapter, but it is important to understand the story—to Jacob's Ladder are inevitable when one talks about SH1. At one point, Harry asks himself in the hospital: “I don't want to think so, but maybe this is all just going on in my head. I could have had a car accident, and now I'm lying unconscious in a hospital bed. I don't know what's real anymore.” What's more, this assertion becomes a premonition if you did not (1) obtain the red liquid that dispels evil spirits (the Aglaophotis) at the Alchemilla Hospital in order to save Cybil later, and (2) see Dr. Kaufmann at the motel in the resort area, while running by it too fast and going too far out on the bridge at Sandford Street, which results in the real world shifting to the Otherworld with no turning back. By missing the item and failing to engage in the action, you actually get an image of Harry unconscious or downright dead behind the wheel of his truck (the Bad Ending). As opposed to the basic narrative convention of the video game, the hero does not ultimately prevail.21 If the various endings do matter, it is certainly because they allow different interpretations and give different shades and nuances to the game. But still, you empathize with Harry's disorientation throughout the game. With him, you come to question the reality of both the Otherworld and the real one. Given that there are monsters in the fog of Silent Hill, it is hard to trace a frontier between the known and the unknown. This is also true for SH3 (I'll talk about SH2 in the next section). Like SH1, the game begins with a longer nightmare, from which Heather supposedly wakes up. But again, given that the huge monster in her dream is found in “reality,” there appears to be a breach there too. When Heather exits the elevator of the Central Square Shopping Center, which brings her to the Otherworld for the first time, she catches a glimpse of gory horror and asks herself: “Is this a dream? It's got to be. Not even a kid could believe in this. But when am I gonna wake up?” And yet, she has already woken up in the restaurant. During the next shift in reality (in the bathtub in one of the rooms in the ECHO Interiors & Floor Fashions), you hear a line from SH1 spoken by her father, Harry Manson, who is explaining: “It's being invaded by the Otherworld. By a world of someone's delusions come to life.” Does Heather hear this voice while she is fainting after succumbing to the pain of her throbbing head? If so, this is a hint about her being Alessa, or like Alessa. Consequently, she is the origin of the Otherworld, a situation that the Possessed Ending brings out better since it reveals that Heather has killed the detective, Cartland. But at the same time, she is also responsible for the vision of the real world. In this perspective, it is not possible to neglect the reference to David Lynch. As Bassanelli from Ps2Fantasy.com summarizes:\n\nLike Lynch, the authors of Silent Hill see external reality as a mirror of our souls, an extension of the character/individual's inner life. Imagination is reality (also to quote the recent Bellocchio movie Good Morning, Night, 2003), and flows of time and space are variable according to our inner feelings, thoughts, rhythm; truth is always relative, the boundaries between life and death, between sanity and insanity are difficult, if not impossible, to define. (Personal correspondence, 2003)\n\nH. P. Lovecraft has made Jervas Dudley, the narrator of The Tomb (1917), profess the same opinion while extending the scope:\n\nIt is an unfortunate fact that the bulk of humanity is too limited in its mental vision to weigh with patience and intelligence those isolated phenomena, seen and felt only by a psychologically sensitive few, which lie outside its common experience. Men of broader intellect know that there is no sharp distinction betwixt the real and the unreal; that all things appear as they do only by virtue of the delicate individual physical and mental media through which we are made conscious of them; but the prosaic materialism of the majority condemns as madness the flashes of supersight which penetrate the common veil of obvious empiricism. (Lovecraft 1970, 7)\n\nEven a doctor's journal, found by James in the document room of the Brookhaven Hospital of SH2, acknowledges the interconnection:\n\nThe potential for this illness exists in all people and under the right circumstances, any man or woman would be driven like him, to “the other side.” The “other side” perhaps may not be the best way to phrase it. After all, there is no wall between here and there. It lies on the borders where reality and unreality intersect. It's a place both close and distinct. Some say it isn't even an illness, I cannot agree with them. I'm a doctor, not a philosopher or even a psychiatrist.\n\nAs much as Silent Hill isn't just a game series but an emotional experience, Lynch's work suggests that Lost Highway (1997) and Mulholland Dr. (2001) aren't just movies but surrealistic experiences, and most viewers would concur. In both cases, it is a portrait of a mental state. It is a play of the mind, a play with the mind.\n\nIf the experience of Silent Hill is lived through ordinary but endearing player characters, the NPCs are not to be cast aside. Team Silent has complied with a precept of game design that Richard Rouse in Game Design: Theory & Practice and Pascal Luban in “Turning a Linear Story into a Game” put forward:\n\nInstead of trying to imbue the main character with a lot of personality, make the NPCs the player encounters in the game memorable and interesting. If the player finds these characters annoying that is totally acceptable; it means that they have enough personality for the player to feel strongly about them. (Rouse 2001, 230)22\n\nPay great attention to secondary characters. They have a critical function in a story. They supply motivation to the hero, bring personality and life to the world created by the author and are often the best way to introduce new developments. In terms of gameplay, these characters also lend themselves to multiple uses: they may help the player by guiding him across a maze or fighting by his side … or may die for the player so that our hero can stay alive and well. (Luban 2001)\n\nThe NPCs of Silent Hill are simultaneously intriguing and disturbing. As is exemplified by Alessa Gillespie, who was the most important NPC, they reveal their true personalities during the course of the various encounters with the main protagonists.\n\nIn the enemy camp, the blind beliefs of Dahlia Gillespie (SH: Origins and SH1) and Claudia Wolf (SH3) in the Order really make them wicked characters. Mysterious, yet elusive and manipulative, they respectively advise Travis, Harry, and Heather, both for their own benefit and for the good of their religious cult. Consequently, they follow the path that becomes their fate, which according to Dahlia has been foretold by Gyromancy. If Dr. Kaufmann remains the typical unpleasant bad guy (SH: Origins and SH1), Vincent (SH3) is difficult to figure out. As demonstrated by the chat previously transcribed, you never know where you stand with this priest of the Order. He is funny, yet mischievous. It is difficult not to have misgivings about the advice he gives to Heather.\n\nIn the collaborator camp, the female police officer Cybil Bennett (SH1) from Brahms (Deputy Wheeler talks about her disappearance to Alex and Elle in SH: Homecoming) is the archetypal strong woman and ally for Harry. Therefore, she can only be expected to turn against him once she is possessed at the Lakeside Amusement Park. The nurse Lisa Garland (SH: Origins and SH1), who took care of Alessa, makes a much more moving appearance. When she introduces herself as a trainee to Travis, she shows both an innocent side and an alluring one. If she demonstrates her come-hither side at the Artaud Theater and only flirts with the trucker in order to show how she can act and “could be a star,” she seems to have been more serious with Dr. Kaufmann in the motel room where Travis finds them. It is in the Otherworld that Lisa is more vulnerable. She is crying as Travis meets her in the Cedar Grove Sanitarium. In SH1, she takes refuge in Harry's arms immediately upon their first encounter (short prerendered cut-scene) when he finds her in the examination room of the nightmarish Alchemilla Hospital. She's confused and doesn't know what's happening. She provides in subsequent encounters important information about Dahlia Gillespie and Silent Hill's history, as well as finding a way to get to the lake. She is cold, does not want to be alone, but feels she cannot leave the place. In their last encounter in the “Nowhere” basement, Lisa has realized that if she is still alive, it's because she's one of them. At this moment, blood pours down her forehead and she starts to totter toward Harry. You sympathize for Lisa, but Harry must leave both the room and the nurse behind. SH3 stages an even more sad moment. This time, it deeply touches the player character. It has been mentioned previously that she has only journeyed home in order to find her father, Harry Mason, who was murdered by Claudia's missionary. The loss is grievous, especially since Heather is not able to give her father a decent burial. With the help of Detective Cartland, she abandons her father under a white bedsheet in his room. Cartland is in some ways replacing Harry from now on. He is a nice guy and he listens to Heather with compassion on their way to Silent Hill. Wounded at the Lakeside Amusement Park, he confesses that Heather reminds him of his son, who was shot in a bank robbery. Although he points his gun at her because her death might be a way to end the nightmare, he doesn't shoot. The loving relationship that unites Heather and Cartland gives more scope to the Normal Ending, where she jokes with him and, above all, to the Possessed Ending. It is striking to find out that Cartland has been bloodily stabbed by Heather.\n\nWhile the gameplay in Silent Hill is almost entirely based upon fear and terror, the encounters and relationships with NPCs, which are developed in cut-scenes, have to be credited for creating fiction emotions such as resentment, anger, pity, sadness, and sorrow.\n\nUnreliable Psychological Journey\n\nDespite the fact that it supplies additional information about the town of Silent Hill, the first reason to talk about SH2 independently is that its plot is autonomous with respect to SH: Origins, SH1, and SH3. But the real motive is that SH2 is a masterpiece that needs to stand out. It is psychological horror at its highest level, and psychological drama at its best.\n\nTalking about the original aspects of SH1, Daragh Sankey notes that Harry Mason becomes an unreliable character since, as we saw earlier, he wakes up after death and blacks out periodically. “Thus the game's ‘point of view'—in this case that of the third-person camera, which we generally trust to be impartial and objective—is rendered untrustworthy” (Sankey 2001). SH2 plays upon this unreliability to an even greater extent. Unless you have finished the game once and got the “In Water” Ending, in which James gets into a car to kill himself in order to be with Mary, there is no hint (as there was in SH: Origins, SH1, or SH3) about the ambiguity of the reality you see; nor is there any indication of James Sunderland's insanity. He remains a protagonist whose age and occupation are unknown (manual). SH2 starts with James pensive, but wide awake in front of a restroom mirror. From the outset the game is a drama of proof. James wonders whether it's possible that his wife Mary, who died three years ago from a damnable disease, wrote the letter he just received, a letter that leaves him unbalanced. He goes to Silent Hill hoping to establish that she's really alive and waiting for him. The first living being he encounters when he gets to town (after a talk with Angela at the cemetery) is a monster he has to kill. The first human he comes across is a dead man. On a memo page discovered near the corpse, James reads:\n\nI saw those demons. They were there, I'm certain. But my friend says he didn't see anything. If that's true, does that mean that what I saw was an illusion? But whether that demon that hates human beings was real, or whether it was just some kind of hallucination that my mind dreamed up … one thing, I know for sure is that I'm beyond all hope.\n\nWhile this memo talks about perception and hallucination, it nevertheless states a terrifying reality independent of James, therefore presenting his point of view as impartial and objective, to repeat Sankey's terms. Nothing yet allows you to tell that Silent Hill has called him on, that the experiential route is his own nightmarish delusions and that the monsters are a projection of his psychological state.\n\nOnce again, what looks like another quest to meet a loved one in a menacing city crawling with monsters turns out to be much more complicated. Although the play of ratiocination is theoretically meant to revolve around the search for the supposedly dead but possibly still alive Mary, it slowly strays toward another question.\n\nScarier than any horror movie released in the last five years, Silent Hill 2 works because you are the protagonist … and yet, you aren't. Gamers can fully identify with the protagonist to the point where, like James, they're fearful of what new rooms and buildings hold—and simultaneously at enough of a remove to where it's clear to them that not everything is right with James' mind. (Maragos 2001)\n\nSH2 expands on the distinction between identification and empathy. Whereas you empathize with James, you cannot identify with him, as you are missing an important piece of information. The secret of SH2's plot (taken here both as the story line of the game and the conspiracy of the game designers) is doubly astonishing: (1) You reach the “special place” only to discover that James has killed Mary by smothering her with a pillow. As a result, the impulses of the soul are completely reversed. James did not enter Silent Hill to reach Mary, but rather to run away from his own act. It was not as much a matter of getting in as of getting out (Travis's stop is similar because his motivation is to leave a troubled past behind). The scene where James realizes his act is certainly one of the saddest moments of the survival horror genre. (2) As Krzywinska has noticed, SH2 “attempt[s] to disrupt the conventional good/evil paradigm. This is achieved by building questions about the ‘good' status of the avatar” (2002, 222 n. 3). Indeed, while a great majority of survival horror games present their heroes in roles of force and as maintaining the social order, in this case you've been empathizing and sympathizing with someone whose sickness pushed him to commit the murder of his beloved.\n\nThe devious plot of SH2 undoubtedly has something to do with Agatha Christie's famous novel The Murder of Roger Ackroyd (1927). The character who narrates the story and assists Hercule Poirot in his investigation, Dr. Sheppard, is in the end the murderer the inspector is looking for. On the other hand, keeping within contemporary film references, the analogy made with The Sixth Sense (Night Shyamalan, 1999) sheds a great deal of light on the game. In this ghost story, Dr. Malcolm Crowe (Bruce Willis) is shot at the beginning of the film by a former patient he didn't help sufficiently. The story picks up next fall when Crowe is treating a young boy named Cole (Haley Joel Osment). Cole sees dead people and is assaulted by them. In order to survive his “sixth sense,” Crowe makes clear to Cole that he must not fear the dead ones but rather help them out. This arrangement enables Cole to live peacefully but also to reveal to Crowe his true nature: Crowe himself is a dead person, a ghost, since he never recovered from the initial shooting. To maintain the surprise until the end, the stratagem of The Sixth Sense is simple. It focuses the action on Cole's parapsychological faculties rather than on Crowe's condition and consciousness of it.23\n\nSH2's plot plays the same narrative game, but without the prologue. It focuses you on the search for Mary rather than on the real nature of James and on his true quest for redemption. Before the viewing of Mary's murder, all the clues are there, more or less obvious, noticeable, and easy to find or see. Depending of your play of ratiocination, you'll experience different fiction emotions if you suspect that Silent Hill is mirroring James's tormented soul. For instance, the dress on the tailor's dummy, which is holding the flashlight in Room 205 of the Wood Side Apartments, is Mary's dress. Likewise, as the director Masashi Tsuboyama explains, the corpse you find in front of the television set in Room 208 “is James himself! Same face, same polygonal model structure. In fact, this is an image straight out of James' imagination” (Beuglet 2001). There is a message written on the map of Silent Hill that James takes before leaving the Brookhaven Hospital: “He who is not bold enough to be stared at from across the abyss is not bold enough to stare into himself. The truth can only be learned by marching forward.” If James (re)visits Neely's Bar on his second way to Rosewater Park, there is a graffiti on the wall: “If you really want to see Mary, you should just die. But you might be heading to a different place than Mary, James.” On the tombstones of three opened graves in the catacombs' graveyard, there are the names of Eddie Dombrowski, Angela Orosco, and James Sunderland. To go on, James has to jump in his own grave. And during the game, the letter he received from Mary will fade away.\n\nNeedless to say, it's through memorable encounters with NPCs that the hidden nature of the journey begins to be more explicitly uncovered. As for SH: Origins, SH1, and SH3, the NPCs elicit a wider range of emotions. Angela and Eddie, the two characters who have their opened graves with James, are quite confused. They are strange and very moody. Their behaviors indirectly reveal the true nature of James's own behavior. Both Angela and Eddie will die. When James comes across Angela with a knife in her hand in the Blue Creek Apartments, he tells her that there's always another way. She replies with a line that James contradicts: she insists that he is the same as her and that “it's easier just to run. Besides, it's what we deserve.” From a newspaper article, which was found before a cut-scene in the Labyrinth where Angela is assaulted by a monster (a Doorman), we learn that she killed her violent, alcoholic father, who had abused her. Her reaction to James is fearful, and when he wants to touch her, Angela pulls herself together and shouts at him that she knows he is a liar. Mary was not ill; he just didn't want her around anymore. That line leaves James without a voice. But the sympathy you may have felt for Angela lasts until the end considering that she'll commit suicide in the hotel fire. As for Eddie, he is fat, ugly, disgusting, and arouses nonempathetic emotions. The first time James meets him at the Wood Side Apartments, he is vomiting into the toilet of a room where someone was killed. Indeed, a person's death isn't a big deal for Eddie, as he kills people, not monsters in Silent Hill. He actually turns into a boss before James reaches the Lake Side Hotel. By the time of the fight, when James preaches about not killing people, Eddie replies: “Don't get all holy on me, James. This town called you, too. You and me are the same. We're not like other people. Don't you know that?!” Having defeated his opponent, James grasps that he has just killed a human being and asks himself if Mary actually died three years ago. This question arises more directly during his encounter with Laura. This little girl, strangely enough, wanders alone safely in Silent Hill. Initially she is a real brat to James, dragging him into the hands of monsters (the Boss Hangers). Even so, she knew Mary and declares to him that he didn't love her anyway. Laura's words evoke explicit doubts about what's actually going on. When James meets her at the Brookhaven Hospital, she says that she was a friend of Mary's who she had met at the hospital last year (not three years ago). At the Lake View Hotel, Laura makes James read the letter that she received from Mary, a letter in which Mary declares that she loved her like her very own daughter, that she would have liked to adopt her and wishes her a happy eighth birthday. The thing is, Laura turned eight last week. Just before the final discovery, and in order to better prepare the twist in the action, this revelation prompts James to believe Mary could still be alive. As with James, Laura also arouses sympathy upon the cruel loss. However, in the same way she crossed Silent Hill without harm, she brings about a rather happy ending (the “Leave” one), walking through a graveyard followed by James.\n\nWhatever happens, the character of Maria is the most important NPC, especially since she accompanies James for a part of the game. It is she, and not Mary, that James finds at the Rosewater Park. Maria looks exactly like Mary and “could be her twin.” She's seductive and takes advantage of it. She pushes James far too often, for instance, wondering presumptuously if he loved Mary or hated her. He leaves her alone in a room of the Brookhaven Hospital, because she's coughing and wants rest, and she later moans that he should never leave her alone because he is supposed to take care of her. James won't be able to do so, and she'll be killed in a cut-scene before they leave the hospital. This moment brings fiction sadness since you cannot do anything to save Maria from Pyramid Head's great knife. But not everything is right with Maria (being the projection of James's mind). James runs into her again in a prison cell of the Labyrinth. She initially pretends to be Mary. Given the fact that she knows about a VHS tape James and Mary recorded back at the hotel, she could be Mary. Suddenly changing attitude, she finally admits that she is not, yet argues that she is real by touching him. To his great despair, James finds her dead and mutilated in another sorrowful cut-scene when he reaches the other side of the room. Maria will be killed one last time, by the hand of a Pyramid Head, during the course of the journey.\n\nThe main monster of SH2 is indeed James's Nemesis; but compared to the Nemesis of Resident Evil 3, Pyramid Head is not as brutal and remains indestructible. James sees him for the first time in Room 307 of the Wood Side Apartments in what looks like a weird sex scene.24 It is also Pyramid Head who kills Maria at the hospital. James has to survive until a final confrontation with two Pyramid Heads, who are executioners from the past, which he discovers in the Historical Society Museum (in the Bogeyman Ending of SH: Homecoming, Alex Shepherd becomes one of those Pyramid Heads). They make him realize his error. Falling on his knees upon Maria's execution, James observes: “I was weak. That's why I needed you … Needed someone to punish me for my sins … But that's all over now … I know the truth … Now it's time to end this.”\n\nThe story finally reveals that it is due to sickness, grief, and despair that the real evil resides inside Mary and James. In the conversation heard in the last long corridor James crosses, Mary cries out: “I'm disgusting! I don't deserve flowers. Between the disease and the drugs, I look like a monster. Well what are you looking at? Get the hell out of here.” And in the letter to James, she wrote:\n\nWhen I first learned that I was going to die, I just didn't want to accept it. I was so angry all the time and I struck out at everyone I loved most. Especially you, James. That's why I understand if you do hate me. But I want you to know this, James. I'll always love you. Even though our life together had to end like this, I still wouldn't trade it for the world. We had some wonderful years together.\n\nJames responded to Mary's desire to die, to end the pain. In turn, he confesses to her: “That's why I did it, honey. I just couldn't watch you suffer. No! That's not true … You also said that you didn't want to die. The truth is I hated you. I wanted you out of the way. I wanted my life back.”"
