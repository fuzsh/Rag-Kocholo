If you want to check out our previous vacations, they’re listed below:\n\n007: The Worst Vacation or That Time SoraRabbit Played Silent Hill 2 Yet Again\n\n029: Silent Hill Shattered Memories, or Harry Runs Away Repeatedly\n\n047: Harry's Bad Trip, or SoraRabbit Plays More Silent Hill\n\nThis year, as I mentioned last time, I’ll be discussing Silent Hill 3, the direct sequel to Part 1. To those unversed, Silent Hill is a long-running horror franchise and its following has been steadily growing over the years. This has been aided in part by two movies, various comic books, and the notorious trailer titled P.T. for the scrapped game Silent Hills. Although it’s been ten years since the last installments in the video game franchise, it is a very good time to be a Silent Hill fan, as we recently got some very good news about the future of the series. (More on that later.)\n\nThis year I really wanted to do a whole month’s worth of Halloween-themed posts, but for those of you who don’t follow me on Twitter, I had a little setback. I recently had sinus surgery and it knocked me out of commission for the end of September and the better part of October. I finally managed to drag myself off my recovery couch and get back to work on content, the most vital item on my To-Do list being this year’s Silent Hill post. So, hopefully, with more planning and organization I can finally do my Halloween marathon next year. We’ll see. I got to this game way later than I’d hoped to, and many times it seemed I wouldn’t meet my deadline, but I managed it.\n\nSo with all that out of the way, let’s get to the topic at hand!\n\nSilent Hill 3 was released in 2003 for the PlayStation 2 by Team Silent and Konami. For this play-through I played the Silent Hill HD Collection version on PlayStation 3. Also note that I played the Extra New Game, which is a mode you unlock after playing through the game once. I did play the HD version years ago when I first got it, but it had been so long I’d forgotten much of it.\n\nI played this game for the first time shortly after it came out, having become a big fan of the first two games in the months leading up to the release. I had already played through the first two games multiple times and had been following every scrap of news I could find for SH3 online and in video game magazines. (Remember those?) When it did come out, I didn’t have the money for it, but I was able to rent it. (And played it through twice before I had to return it.)\n\nThe game mechanics in Silent Hill 3 are much the same as the previous games with a few notable exceptions. The inventory screen is divided between key items, weapons, and supplies. (The latter of which is where the ammo and the traditional health drinks and first aid kits are stored.) The gameplay is much more focused on combat this time around, with a wider variety of weaponry being available. You have your usual melee weapons— the knife, steel pipe, katana— but you also have a huge-ass mace and a stun gun, and on later playthroughs, the beam saber. Ranged weapons are in greater number with the traditional handgun and shotgun being in attendance. This time they’re joined by a submachine gun, and in the Extra New Game, the unlimited submachine gun, the flamethrower, and the unlockable Heather Beam/Sexy Beam. (I’ll explain those later, don’t worry.) There doesn’t appear to be a quick turn option like there was in Silent Hill 2, and that was greatly missed. The default controls, as with the previous two games are tank controls (press left to go right, right to go left, up to go forward and down to go backwards) but this can be changed to 2D controls in the options menu. (I did this immediately. I’m awful with tank controls.)\n\nThere are a couple of interesting additions to the usual items: the silencer, which can be equipped to the handgun or submachine gun, and the beef jerky, which you can throw on the ground to distract some monsters. There are also slabs of meat placed in some areas that act as a sort of permanent beef jerky. As long as you walk slowly by, the monsters generally won’t notice while they’re eating. I haven’t used any of the beef jerky, since my play style is typically to run around fighting things.\n\nThe classic mechanics and elements are all here— the map that gets edited as you explore, locked or jammed doors, mysterious barriers preventing access to unimportant areas, stomping on enemies to finish them off, and the multiple endings (although there are fewer this time around— again, more on that later.) The ending you get is dependent on actions you take during the game. Heather turns her head to look at items as you pass, which really helps. She gets winded after running or fighting, but does seem to have more stamina than the previous protagonists, likely due to her youth.\n\nThe game also continues the franchise’s tradition of amazing music with two tracks that I love. The ending credits are a version of the first game’s theme song (with lyrics!) entitled Hometown. And the opening credit song “You’re Not Here” (which I have been known to listen to on repeat) is especially good. Look them both up, they’re great.\n\nContent-wise, some of the areas in Silent Hill 2 are present here, and the plot revolves around the cult established in the first game. Interestingly enough, the game doesn’t start in Silent Hill, but rather its horrors have infected Heather’s unnamed town. (Although the prologue is a nightmare that takes place in Lakeside Amusement Park, which was featured in the first game and in Shattered Memories.) Where she lives is not stated in the game, but it’s within driving distance of Silent Hill.\n\nSilent Hill 3 ties directly into the events of the first game with few ties to the second installment. It was also the basis for the loose adaptation movie Silent Hill: Revelations 3-D. (A film which, I’ll admit, was not as good as the first one, but I feel it got more hate than it deserved. I enjoyed it.) As a brief refresher, in the first game Harry Mason took his adoptive daughter Cheryl to Silent Hill and promptly lost her. He encountered a few normal people but mostly monsters and a crazy woman named Dahlia who worshiped in the town’s weird cult. Their goal was to have her daughter Alessa, who was burned in a fire, give birth to their cult’s God. Harry prevented this and put Alessa to rest. Alessa handed him a baby and he fled the town.\n\nThe next section is a lengthy crawl through the subway system and a sewer. There is a little subplot where someone apparently died recently by falling onto the tracks and Heather locates a newspaper article about the supposed suicide. Also there is a text book talking about ghosts being chained to the areas where they died. (This is foreshadowing, but it also may be a bit of a nod to the Born From a Wish sub-scenario in Silent Hill 2, where one of the characters is speculated to be a ghost.) In one area of the subway you can get pushed by the ghost of the victim onto the tracks. I didn’t get back on the platform soon enough, got hit by the train and had to replay a long segment of the subway. Ugh. Also of interest is that when I did replay, I ignored the newspaper and the text book and the ghost left me alone. I’m pretty sure reading those items are the trigger for that event.\n\nEventually Heather works her way onto the subway heading for her apartment. She also finds another Silent Hill staple, the handy-dandy shotgun.\n\nQuick side note here, Silent Hill has always been creative with their save spots. For Harry they were notepads where he wrote down his adventures. For James they were glowing red squares that made his head hurt to look at them. And here they’re a glowing red occult symbol that Heather often comments on. The first one you encounter in the game is drawn on the bathroom mirror at the mall. Throughout the game they appear in interesting places— on an oil drum, a stain on a bedsheet, graffiti or blood, an image on a staticky TV, a carving in a church. When observing them, Heather often comments about her missing memories and ponders why the symbol looks so familiar and why it makes her head hurt. I just think it’s creative to take a necessary game mechanic and elevate it to a new level, even bringing it into the plot.\n\nFrom here it’s another Silent Hill tradition— a long jaunt in the sewers! As she travels to the sewers there is a really cool effect where the walls and the stairs gradually become red and corroded. In the sewer are a few more puzzles and more monsters to fight or dodge. You also have to drop a hair drier into the water to get by an unseen crocodile monster that’s been eating sewer workers..\n\nLeaving the sewer, Heather finds herself in a construction site and then a building that really should be condemned. She jumps down a hole onto a mattress, climbs out a window and crosses a scaffolding to a monster-filled office building. I’m assuming this isn’t her usual route home. This place is filled with monsters called Slurpers, which are the most annoying monsters in the game. They crawl along the floor, making them hard to hit with melee weapons and the semiautomatic. They also take a lot of hits to take down, even with the shotgun. I almost died to them several times, especially when multiple of them swarmed me.\n\nThe office building also has a lots of dismembered mannequins, which is par for the course in a Silent Hill game. Also of no surprise is the moment you hear a scream and turn around to find that the only mannequin with a head has been decapitated and blood is coming from the wound. Classic.\n\nIn the course of exploring the office buildings, Heather finds one of the best weapons in the game— the katana! It’s fast, it’s deadly, it’s cool-looking. Of course this game doesn’t favor melee, so sadly I didn’t use it as much as I wanted to. It helped me out of a few scrapes when I was able to hit three monsters at the same time with its long reach.\n\nAs you explore, there’s a blank painting with a caption “Flame purifies all” and Heather comments that she’s afraid of fire. File that info away for later.\n\nAs Heather continues to explore the building and solve puzzles, it shifts to the Otherworld. We hear a familiar male voice talking about how the Otherworld is someone’s delusions brought to life, tainting our world. (Harry said this in the first game.) In the dark and twisted version of the building she finds a photo of herself with the words “Find the holy one. Kill her.” Soon after she meets a creepy dude named Vincent who promptly begins to mansplain the events of the game to her. He claims to be on Heather’s side and not working with Claudia. He also is shocked that Heather knows nothing about her past and we get the first of the big plot reveals. The thing Vincent is most shocked about is that Harry didn’t tell his daughter anything.\n\nYes, Heather’s full name is Heather Mason, and the father she’s been spending the game trying to get back to is Harry, the hero from the first game. (You may have already been fully aware of this, but I kept it hidden until now because this is the moment the game reveals it.) Vincent refuses to tell her the truth and makes some off-hand references to her mother. He also mentions that Otherworld fascinates him, which is a red flag if I’ve ever heard one.\n\nHeather continues to explore the darker version of the building, running from monsters, burning a painting, reading a fairy tale, and solving more puzzles. One of the puzzles involves picking up a silver coin and using it on a vending machine to buy a soda in the same room. Inside the soda is a key to an earlier room. I used up most of my shotgun shells in this area. It was the easiest way to get rid of those damned Slurpers. An enormous unfightable monster blocks the exit to the building and that’s taken care of by reciting a magical spell written in the final page of the fairy tale. Finally Heather is able to leave the building and Otherworld. (For now.) From there it’s a straight shot as most of the city is blocked off by police tape and the usual mysterious tarp walls. Either Heather lives in a really run-down neighborhood or it’s more of Silent Hill’s influence.\n\nAnd then, as Heather finally enters her apartment and announces to her dad that she’s home, we get what I feel is the biggest shock of the game.\n\nOn the roof is Claudia, who readily admits she had Harry killed as revenge for what he did 17 years ago, in the first game. Also she wanted to fill Heather’s heart with hate and reiterates that Heather needs to remember her true self. She will go on to birth a god and create Paradise. She reveals the monster who killed Harry on her order and it’s boss fight time!\n\nThis dude is fast and has long swords on his arms. He can use the swords to block shotgun blasts! I had to keep dodging his swings, shooting him when he was unaware, and then doing most of the damage when he was on the ground. I nearly died here (probably would have if not for the monster-proof vest) and used up the rest of my shotgun shells. (Usually I’m a supply hoarder in survival games but I really had trouble conserving resources in this playthrough.) I did get stuck here for a bit— even after the monster was dead I couldn’t go anywhere. Turned out I had to stomp on his head to trigger the cutscene where I left the roof. (Haha, weird.)\n\nWhen they get to their destination and check in to Jack’s Inn, Douglas says he’s going to meet with Leonard He suggests Heather should check out the hospital. And if you’ve ever experienced a Silent Hill game before, you know only happy, cheerful things happen in the hospital!\n\nAnd now finally, a couple of hours into the game, we’re in Silent Hill, specifically the western portion James visited during the events of Part 2. Ah, Silent Hill, wandering the ghostly quiet and foggy streets, evading monsters and filling in the map. So many memories. Incidentally, Jack’s Inn was a location James visited in Part 2, at the edge of Toluca Lake and right across the street from Rosewater Park, where he encountered Maria for the first time. In this game you can’t visit Pete’s Bowl-O-Rama, Blue Creek Apartment, or the Silent Hill Historical Society, but still, good continuity keeping the same layout. (You don’t go near this area in Part 1.) Although much of the town was barred from me, I still took a stroll for old time’s sake, killing bad doggies and seeing the sights. They didn’t give me items for the trouble, which was lame. The only other location I was able to enter was the bar Heaven’s Night and I could be wrong about this, but I think it’s only accessible with a save file from Part 2, just like the toilet gag. The bar didn’t have much except for some much-needed shotgun shells and a flier showing a black haired woman. The flier declared the “Return of Lady Maria!” which indicates that Maria must still be around in some form after Part 2. (And she’s a stripper now?) Could be a coincidence, but it’s a interesting tidbit.\n\nOnce Heather enters the park, she doubles over in pain from her stomach. We can also see some blood staining her previously white vest. She seems to recognize the place from her nightmare at the start of the game. I love this area— it’s creepy and ghostly. The bloody Robbie the Rabbit mascot costumes are the perfect touch. When I think of Silent Hill 3, I think of the Amusement Park.\n\nUnfortunately this area was a little glitchy for me in the HD version, making it difficult to make contact with the monsters with my katana at times. I hate using first aid kits outside of boss battles. There were a lot of monsters in the park, so I ran away a lot. At one point I ran onto the roller coaster track to get away from them. You know, like a rational person. You may be shocked to learn that the coaster came along and it was game over. This happens in the nightmare at the start but I fell into a hole right away if you recall. Exploring the park more I was able to find the key to turn off the coaster so I could safely wander the tracks. (Again, like a rational person.) The train comes anyway but Heather jumps off in time, landing on a ticket booth.\n\nWhile she’s temporarily knocked out, a cut scene plays of Douglas confronting Claudia. She’d told him Heather was kidnapped, which is why he took the case in the first place. From Claudia’s point of view, Harry did kidnap her, from the cult. She has God inside her and Alessa the mother will awaken to bring about Paradise. Douglas says Paradise sounds pretty boring and points his gun at her.\n\nThere’s a bit of lore to be found looking at the paintings. The Order seemed to have taken biblical imagery and symbolism and twisted it to fit their concept of a feminine God and a multitude of lesser gods and angels serving Her. Their lore also factors in the death and rebirth of God.\n\nIn the church confessional you can hear an agonized woman’s plea to see her child after death and to be sent to purgatory, not hell. She asks for forgiveness for the sin of revenge for her poor, murdered daughter. You can choose to forgive her or say nothing, and this also impacts the ending quite a bit. (Forgiving the woman adds 1000 points to the needed 4000 for one of the secret endings, so this is no small matter.) This is an interesting part because there is really no good answer, even factoring in the morality of murder and revenge. Essentially, by forgiving the woman, Heather is taking on the role of God and passing judgement that she’s not fit to give. Alternatively, by saying nothing she is refusing to offer solace to a tortured soul. Tough choice.\n\nNote that no one is really sure who this woman is, and even if she’s a character we’ve seen reference to elsewhere in the series. Some suspect that the woman is Dahlia Gillespie (with a different voice actor) and she is asking for forgiveness for killing Cheryl Mason. This theory seems pretty sound to me, and it provides interesting insight into the series. If true, it shows that after 17 years of thinking it over, Dahlia has seen the error of her ways and just wants to see Alessa again despite using her for her own nefarious plans. It shows a more human side to the villain, showing remorse over the killing of an innocent child and the torture of her own daughter.\n\nHe quickly backtracks, claiming it was a joke. Ass. He reveals the Talisman from Leonard was the Seal of Metatron and that it’s very important and gives her a book called Otherworld Laws. (Note that the seal was also shown in the first game, but it was called the Mark of Samael there.) The book doesn’t really do anything, and when you examine it, it just talks about how the Seal of Metatron channels the power of God to defeat evil, taking a toll on its user. Nothing here really applies as the story unfolds, so it’s odd.\n\nAs Heather continues in the church, she collects Tarot cards for another puzzle and visits various rooms. One is a copy of Harry’s room, complete with his bookshelf and a diary. The writings we’ve seen of Harry in the Amusement Park and the church paint the picture of a troubled man and the love he had for his adopted daughter despite her problematic origins.\n\nThe bloody footprints come back to lead to a copy of Alessa’s room in the hospital basement. (We visited it in Part 1.) In this room is a book about Aglaophotis. This was the red liquid in Part 1 that was instrumental in acquiring the “Good+” ending. It’s described as a sort of “demon repellant”, which explains why Dahlia was so intent of getting rid of it all and reacted with shock at the sight of it.\n\nNext is a room that looks just like Alessa’s childhood room. There is a memo in here apparently written by Harry just before the final boss battle. Looking around at the drawings gives Heather memories of growing up with Claudia and how much fun they had playing together. (It appears that Dahlia either adopted Claudia or took care of her.) This is where Heather finally finds the key to a room early on in the church.\n\nBehind that locked door is Alessa’s classroom at Midwich Elementary. In here you can listen to a cassette tape that was picked up much earlier. This has a conversation between Vincent and an unnamed woman about what happened 17 years earlier. She refers to it as unbelievers preventing God from being born properly. God is now slumbering in the holy mother. We also learn that Vincent is one of the leaders of the Order and runs the church. There is also a notebook containing the thoughts of the teacher, K. Gordon. We visited this teacher’s house in SH1. She talks about how concerned she is about Alessa and worries her mother is abusing her. (Weird, I always assumed K. Gordon was a guy for some reason but the wikis all says the character is female.)\n\nThe final room belongs to Claudia. In her diary she talks about her need to make the world a better place and her worry that the means to birthing God may be too cruel. Also there is a 6th birthday card from Alessa to Claudia that says she feels Claudia is her true sister. This indicates that Claudia kept it all these years, clinging onto her happy memories of childhood with Alessa. Also in this room is the final Tarot card, so it’s back to Alessa’s room to solve one last puzzle to unlock the door to the final boss battle.\n\nIn this room Vincent is arguing with Claudia again about their differing faith in their God. We also learn that Vincent is apparently wealthy and funded the church. Heather arrives and Vincent orders her to kill Claudia. Claudia stabs him in the back, literally. Claudia has another villain monologue explaining that Heather had to learn to hate through her experiences. God was nurtured by Heather/Alessa’s hatred. Sympathy is born out of pain and suffering. Claudia goes on to say that she’s sinned in rushing God’s birth and has caused a lot of pain in the process. She doesn’t believe she’s worthy of forgiveness but it’s all worth it for Paradise.\n\nHeather whips out the Seal of Metatron and Claudia dismisses it as junk, stating that it can’t kill God. She stabs Vincent again— who continued talking even after being stabbed— finishing him off. Heather doubles over in pain again and blood streaks her skin. Claudia gushes about how happy she is to witness Judgement Day and the birth of God. But Heather manages to stand up and tells her to shut up. She pulls out the pendant that’s been in her inventory the entire game. Whenever examined it’s stated that Harry gave it to her on her birthday and called it a lucky charm, telling her to never take it off. Inside is a small red jewel that turns out to be Aglaophotis. Heather swallows the red tablet to abort the demon/God.\n\nIn comparison to the second game, which had six endings, this game only has three endings. Normal, Possessed, and UFO. The latter two are more difficult to get and it’s only possible to get the Normal ending on the first playthrough. In the Possessed ending Heather succumbs to darkness and kills Douglas. In the UFO, well, alien-related things happen. To get that one you have to kill at least 30 enemies with the Heather Beam or Sexy Beam before you reach the apartment. Yeah, there I go mentioning the beams again. I should explain. You unlock the Heather Beam by killing a whopping 333 monsters in total throughout all your playthroughs. (Which is far more than are present in the entire game, so it takes several run throughs.) Then you have it at the start of your next playthrough. You unequip your weapon and Heather can fire a beam through her eyes. Wearing the Transform costume changes this to the Sexy Beam. I haven’t met the requirements yet, but if I do I will make sure to put a screenshot on my Year-End Video Game post.\n\nThe fact that there are only three endings was a little disappointing, especially after the wealth of endings in Part 2. Even Part 1 had four endings, although they were all slight variations of the same ending. But I can’t really count the lack of endings as a negative… Heather’s story couldn’t really end too many different ways. The limited number of endings keeps the story more focused, making it clear what the real outcome was while still giving you something to shoot for in unlocking the other two.\n\nI am currently replaying the game killing every monster I find in an attempt to get the Possessed ending. That one is achieved by killing a certain number of monsters, taking a huge amount of damage without dying, not checking on Douglas, and forgiving the woman in the confessional. So far I’m well on course to attain it. Hopefully I will, and then I will try for the UFO ending. Since the game is so short, it’s not really much of a drag on my time to try it. (Plus I know if I don’t do it now, I won’t get around to it.)\n\nAs mentioned there are unlockable items, as with all Silent Hill games. The unlimited submachine gun is obtained by beating the final boss and delivering the final blow with a melee weapon. There is a beam saber (which very much looks like a lightsaber) that is received for defeating most of the enemies with melee attacks. (Note that stomping an enemy while it’s down always counts as a melee kill.) It wasn’t very strong, so I didn’t use it much. There is also a flamethrower which is unlocked by defeating more enemies with firearms. (Or after beating the game after already having earned the beam saber, which is how I got it.)\n\nThis game includes a code system for unlockables. In my playthrough I received two codes for different costumes that Heather could wear. Some codes are located in the game or given on completion, and others were given out in magazines and online. There is even a code that puts Douglas in his underwear for the entire game. I don’t have that code, but I have seen screenshots. It’s pretty funny to see the gruff old guy with an open coat and boxers. Although it would put an extra creepy slant to his scenes with Heather. (That scene where he’s got a gun pulled on Claudia, though, that would be hilarious.)\n\nSpeaking of costumes…\n\nA few side notes in this section before I continue to my review and concluding notes. I chose to play this game using my copy of the PS3 HD Collection, just as I did with Part 2. Although I have a copy of Silent Hill 3 on PS2 and that was the original format I played in, I mainly played this version for ease of completing it in time. I cannot hook my PS2 up to my television upstairs and I haven’t taken the time to learn how to attach my capture device to the PS2.\n\nThe reason I bring this up is because I’ve become increasingly aware that the HD Collection has developed a very bad reputation over the years. I honestly didn’t see much wrong with the port of SH2, but then I wasn’t looking at it critically. The new voice acting really jarred me and I did start over to turn on the original voices when I heard someone else’s voice coming out of James, but that was about it. (Maybe it crashed once or twice? I can’t recall.) Anyway, I haven’t played Silent Hill 3 as often as the previous two titles, and it’s been so long ago that I really don’t remember the PS2 version clearly. But I did see a lot of issues with this version.\n\nSee, the company tasked with developing the HD Collection were not given much support by Konami and had to work with incomplete source code which had a lot of issues that had already been corrected in the development of the original games. They had trouble with some of the game controls and visuals— most notably the fog effects used in both games. (See above for eerily glowing fog. Man was that distracting.) The games also had problems with crashing. (I only experienced that once in this playthrough of SH3.) I didn’t know any of this when I did my post for SH2, which is why I’m including it here.\n\nPersonally, I like the updated graphics (except the fog) and only had some minor annoyance problems with this version of SH3. I don’t recall the original voice acting, but I do like the voices they chose for this and the delivery of the lines. (Oh, by the way the guy who voices Vincent in this version also portrayed Peter Parker on the modern Spider-Man games.) My biggest issues with this version is that sometimes Heather’s walk cycle gets glitchy, causing her legs to stutter and not move smoothly. At times she appeared to glide along the floor. (Cocoashade saw one of these glitches and likened it to how the South Park characters move.) The most annoying problem is that often the X button would double-click, making me miss dialogue and have to backspace when entering the costume codes. However I’m unsure if this is a glitch inherent in the HD Collection or a problem with my recently-purchased third-party controller. (I didn’t have time to hook up my original controller and test things.)\n\nAlso in this section I’ll talk about the driving force behind me getting off my butt and getting this post done in time. I can’t give all the credit to that nagging voice in the back of my mind that won’t let me rest until I get my posts done and the looming deadline of October 31st that stresses me out. No, a lot of it was the Silent Hill Transmission. This was a livestream that launched on Konami’s YouTube channel on October 19th, 2022. I was still off work at the time recovering, and so I had the opportunity to tune in for it live. Almost 83,000 people watched it live, and that’s pretty impressive to me. As I mentioned earlier, it’s been ten years since the last two games released and it was clear from the viewership and the social commentary after the livestream that I’m far from the only one who has been waiting impatiently for a continuation of the series.\n\nAlthough the broadcast included merchandise reveals and the announcement of a third movie (based on Silent Hill 2), for me, the highlights of the livestream were the announcements and trailers for some new games. (All of which I’m excited to see released.) The first one was the Silent Hill 2 Remake for PS5. This game will keep the story and spirit of the original SH2 release but update it for modern players. (And add a few more endings, I hope?) If this game is good, it may be time for me to finally earn all the endings! (Hopefully if this remake does well we will also get remakes for Parts 1 and 3. Maybe? Please?)\n\nA big section of the broadcast was taken up by discussion of a project called Silent Hill: Ascension. This was not labeled as a game so much as a “media experience”. I’m still a little unclear on what that means, but from the details given I am speculating that it’s actually a livestream/social event in the spirit of Twitch Plays Pokémon but where the viewers vote on the actions to be taken in the game rather than directly play. (Of course, I could be wrong. Time will tell.) One of the games mentioned is called Silent Hill: Townfall, and seems to be in the more traditional vein of the series. The trailer gave me undeniable P.T. vibes. Judging by the sparse trailer it’s probably very early in development. The game I’m most excited for (tied with the SH2 remake) is Silent Hill f, which had a visually stunning trailer depicting Silent Hill in a more Japanese style. Like the earlier games, it will be written and designed by Japanese creators, and reportedly takes place not in the American Silent Hill, but in rural Japan in the 1960s. The trailer caught my attention and the possibilities for this game are intriguing. It seems to be very psychological and there was recurring imagery of flowers shown. It looks stunning and creepy.\n\nSo, yes, I am hyped through the roof about the future of Silent Hill and following news and updates much like I did almost 20 years ago leading up to the release of Silent Hill 3. This series has touched a lot of people and brought us hours of entertainment and chills, and much like one of the twisted lumbering monstrosities lurching along the streets of the titular town, the Silent Hill franchise has risen from its assumed death to stalk us once again. And I am here for it.\n\nBut past and future games aside, what did I think of Silent Hill 3? Well, clearly I loved it. Silent Hill 2 has long been my favorite entry in the series, although I have enjoyed each one so far. Prior to my playthrough of Shattered Memories, I would have counted Silent Hill 3 as a close second, mostly due to the visuals, themes, and the female protagonist. Still, SH3 hasn’t been fully dethroned. This game does have a certain charm to it, and I’ll always have fond memories of it being the first Silent Hill installment that I actively waited for as a newly-minted fan.\n\nThis can be considered the end of the original story of Silent Hill, although later games do fill in more backstory and explore the town and its lore further. When compared to the psychological horror of Part 2, this one takes a more direct approach, facing much of the grotesque head on. There’s a heightened level of gore and violence. The wounded monsters screech and writhe in pain until you finish them off. Heather is a strong lead, thrust as all of the heroes are, into impossible and terrifying situations, but not shrinking from them or shutting down. She gets stronger and more determined as the game goes on, but never loses her cynical, wry attitude.\n\nWe learn more about Harry through his daughter’s eyes, which was very welcome. Harry has long been considered to be a bit of a non-character due to his lack of characterization and emotion in Part 1. But here we are able to see him as a more fully fleshed out character. (Even though he only appears as a corpse. What, too soon?) According to Heather, Harry loved detective novels and he often wrote, becoming very wordy in his letters. He was conflicted, concerned about Heather’s origins and the potential she could have due to where she came from, but ultimately he was able to push that aside and love her unconditionally, raising a happy and strong young woman. Harry certainly needed some depth, and Heather gave that to him.\n\nUpsides: Silent Hill 3 took the usual dark and corrupted aesthetic of Silent Hill and cranked it up. The ambient noises, the monster and character design, the music… all top notch. As always they use their ambiance and lighting to great effect in building tension. I appreciate that it took a different approach from Part 2 while adding Easter Eggs referencing it. Although the game takes on some very heavy themes and is steeped in dark imagery, it doesn’t take itself too seriously. There are tongue-in-cheek references to the previous games, Heather is somewhat snarky when examining items, and some of the costumes and the UFO ending are very silly. This quirkiness and some of the visuals (like Robbie the Rabbit obviously) serve as a counterpoint to the darkness, not taking away from it but shining a light on it and making the dark parts stand out that much more.\n\nDownsides: The play mechanics that I mentioned did get in the way a bit. (Especially when trying to zoom in on the map and solve the book puzzle.) The game was much shorter than the previous entries, making the extended subway and sewer sections feel less like natural parts of the game and more like padding. The controls were wonky like with the other games, but once I switched to 2-D mode I did find the controls much smoother and more responsive than what was found in Parts 1 and 2. The town was disappointingly empty, but there were still plenty of locations to explore.\n\nThe downsides aside, I very much enjoyed the experience of the game and what it added to the lore of Silent Hill. The nods to previous games were very well-handled… especially the jarring revelation that Heather was the baby from the end of the first game and her murdered father was the guy you spent the whole game playing as. The nods to Silent Hill 2 were well-done and appreciated, and exploring the same areas as someone new was great. (The clearest callback is in the UFO ending, but I won’t spoil that for you.) There was even foreshadowing to the 4th game in the article by Joseph Schreiber and references to the orphanage. My favorite element of connective tissue are the notebooks that Heather encounters in the Amusement Park that appear to have been written by her father 17 years prior. Although the game doesn’t come right out and say it, to me these are the notepads that Harry saved his game on. At the first of these, he mentions writing down his experiences in case they’re of help to someone in the future. This is a subtle but expertly executed callback to one of the first moments of the first game. Someone finally read his notes, and it turned out to be his daughter.\n\nHeather is an interesting character to me. There is an intriguing duality to her. She shows a morbid curiosity at times like when she notices a human-shaped form under a sheet or a trail of blood leading to a bullet-ridden elevator door or a horrible smell coming from a locker. But she always decides against feeding that curiosity. Is it the normal human slant towards the macabre, or her dark Alessa side? As with many video game heroes, her thoughts were mostly kept to herself, only revealed through her interactions with the other characters and the objects she examines. She went through the game showing a clear detachment and disinterest in a lot of the exploration, being very dismissive towards much of what the player has her look at, but she still pushed on, first to get home, then to get to Silent Hill and enact her revenge. A revenge she ultimately chose not to take, instead focusing on preventing the demon from despoiling the world. Heather seemed much lighter after her final confrontation with God. She was smiling, joking, acting like a normal teenager. She knew who she was now, and more importantly, who she wanted to be. She threw off the weight of her past and was left with just her present and what she chooses to make of it.\n\nWhile many of the characters Harry and James met in their games were women (with one exception each) all the characters aside from Claudia that Heather interacts with are male. And they all seem to serve as typical male archetypes that women deal with in their day-to-day lives. Vincent is arrogant and belittling, insisting on holding his intelligence over Heather’s head, mansplaining whenever he finds something she doesn’t know. (He also gaslights her about the monsters being real people.) The obsessive, self-entitled, and dangerous Stanley who trickles threats when his affections are not returned. And the manipulative, self-absorbed user in the character of Leonard.\n\nNote that an exception to this is the character of Douglas, whose initial impressions are reversed as the game goes on. In his first few appearances Douglas gives off total creepy older dude vibes, walking up to a teenager in the mall and demanding her attention. He just oozes creepiness in the beginning and it’s used to great effect. He turns out to be an okay guy later on, but still, I wouldn’t let any daughter of mine take a road trip across state lines and hang out in a motel with him. Just sayin’.\n\nThis game made clear statements on women’s right to choose and oppression against women. The whole game is about Heather’s identity— who she is, who she used to be (her reputation?), who everyone else wants her to be. The father who kept the truth from her as a way of protecting her, but then left that truth in writing so she could have access to it when she needed it. The echoes of her past that pursued her to her peaceful new life. Throughout the game are instances of the other characters ignoring Heather’s words and disregarding what she wants in favor of their own goals and wants. They take her choice away in demanding that she be the mother of their God, or telling her what to do, where to go, who to kill, how to think and act.\n\nThey even take her body from her and she ultimately takes her agency back in swallowing the red pill and aborting God. This effectively circumvents her dictated destiny and gives her back her power and her choice. At the end (at least the normal and likely canon ending) she even chooses to discard both her chosen name of Heather and her birth name of Alessa in favor of the name her father gave her—Cheryl. And her next choice— keep dying her hair blonde or go back to her natural black. It may seem simple and possibly the game’s way of lightening the tension, but hair color is yet another way a woman takes control of her life and how she’s viewed. Even the costume system—which at first glance may seem sexist (the male characters wore what they wanted but we get to play dress-up with the girl character?) is another reflection of the theme of choice— a person’s choice of clothing reflects not only who they are, but who they want to be. Clothing can be self-expression or rebellion, depending on how you use it. (Which is why I choose to go through my future adventures cosplaying as Princess Heart.)\n\nMy favorite thing about this game is that in Heather we have a strong female character who is not depicted as a damsel in distress or as an infallible super-woman, but as a regular human with fears and shortcomings and self-doubt. She’s not a perfect killing machine. She’s not saddled with Daddy issues. She’s not weepy and crippled by emotion, but is allowed to cry and have emotions without those qualities being her entire character. She’s realistic and that makes her a better character than she otherwise would have been. Heather is a well-rounded and nuanced character and I give kudos to Team Silent for crafting her.\n\nSilent Hill 3 effectively concluded the story begun in Part 1, expanding on the lore of the town and its cult and gods. It ran in the spirit of both the games that preceded it, but forged its own path, choosing to focus more on action and taking a crack at social commentary in depicting darkly familiar experiences women and the young experience in a male-driven society that disregards their thoughts, feelings, and desires. Through Heather we’re put in the place of someone who just wants to live their life without having their future dictated by the uncaring adults in charge who refuse to listen to their input and fresh ideas. The act of aborting God was Heather’s ultimate act of rebellion and courage and it was this act that let her take agency back in her own life. Although she was set along a specific path by her previous self (ie parents and family, her past choices, society’s dictates) the sad truth is that she never asked for that path. And even when regaining her previous memories as Alessa, she still no longer wanted what she used to want. We all have the option to change and grow. Using her own strength that she developed in her experiences as Heather and the values and courage instilled in her by her father, she was able to ultimately make a reasoned choice regardless of what those controlling and manipulating her wanted. Heather chose to forge her own path, and take back her true name and identity.\n\nIt’s heavy subject matter and it’s up to you all to decide if it was executed properly, but it made an impact on me… especially replaying it now as an adult with a lot more life experience and the gift of many different viewpoints and experiences I’ve been granted by others. When I first played this game I saw it at the surface level and didn’t really dig deeper to the themes and symbolism of the game’s story. This time I was able to do that and I’m very grateful to have the opportunity to see the other layers this game has to offer.\n\nAlthough the version I played had its faults, this was quite an enjoyable time. I got to revisit a game I hadn’t played in years, analyze it much further than I was capable of in my youth, and experience more of the dark and quirky spirit of a solid installment of a fantastic series. I enjoyed Heather’s journey to Alessa and finally to Cheryl and I hope you all did as well.\n\nAnd so that’s my take on Silent Hill 3. So far I’ve played six of the Silent Hill games, have seen both of the movies, and have read I think three of the IDW comic series. I have loved each installment of the franchise for different reasons. Silent Hill continually draws me in and intrigues me, stimulating the part of me that has an undying love for and fascination with horror and everything dark. Sharing these games and experiences and memories with you all has been a lot of fun and it’s nice to have this tradition to come back to every year. I still have two more games to replay for this blog and three to play for the first time. And that’s not counting all the upcoming games. It looks like this annual tradition will be continuing for years to come!\n\nThank you all for joining me in my latest jaunt to our favorite town. It’s been rough getting back into my routines after my surgery, but finishing this post (and in time for my self-imposed deadline) was a satisfying accomplishment for me. I’ll be back soon with more content and I hope you all join me this time next year for our next visit to Silent Hill!"
