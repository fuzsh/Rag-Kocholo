        "text": "Well, I hadn’t planned to write an extra “Horror Videogames Series” article and I also often tend to avoid internet arguments too. Not to mention that, because of things like the likely system requirements for it on PC, the likely cost of it and my almost decade-long policy of not buying or playing games with online DRM (yes, even Steam), I’m probably not going to be playing the upcoming remake of “Silent Hill 2” (2001) any time soon….\n\nThis article may contain SPOILERS and DARK SUBJECT MATTER.\n\nStill, I was surprised to see that there was a bit of an online fuss about the redesigned version of Angela in the trailers. Leaving aside how the new version of the character is apparently based on the original early 2000s concept artist’s sketches or how she is canonically meant to be an older teenager, a lot of the criticism seemed to focus on her visual design.\n\nSome of the more crass video thumbnails I’ve seen seem to criticise the fact that she doesn’t look “glamourous” or “beautiful” or anything like that. And I have to wonder if the people criticising her appearance have actually paid attention to the story of the original game.\n\nWithout going into too many horrific details – most of which are mercifully only implied – she’s a deeply depressed character who has suffered some extremely terrible things and then acted in self-defence. And her new character design accurately reflects this. She’s someone who doesn’t have a huge amount of energy, probably doesn’t have much money and is plagued with bad memories and – arguably unfair – guilt.\n\nSo, yes, she probably isn’t going to have the energy or resources to wear lots of make-up, shape her eyebrows or have lots of fashionable outfits. Also, given that the game is set in a rural area over two decades ago (unless they’ve updated the setting) then, although the people who hurt her are solely responsible for their actions, it isn’t impossible that Angela also believes outdated ideas about “not attracting attention” as well.\n\nThis isn’t the designers being “woke”, it’s just good visual storytelling. It’s using visual design as one of many forms of subtle characterisation. It also means that Bloober Team have actually studied the original game as well. And, make no mistake, virtually every element of the original “Silent Hill 2” (2001) was a carefully-chosen creative decision.\n\nFor example, whilst the original game does include a glamourous and beautiful character – Maria – she’s a paranormal apparition who reflects the person that the main character – James – wanted his wife, Mary, to be. And, in some editions of the original game, there’s also a brilliantly eerie side-game called “Born From A Wish” where Maria grapples with the fact that she’s literally just a ghost designed to reflect someone else’s desires.\n\n(On a side-note: As for Maria’s redesigned costume in the trailers, whilst I can understand some of the criticisms, I think that the designers were just going for the same idea but in a more subtle and/or timeless way. Maria’s new outfit still looks more glamourous than Mary’s, but in more of an “expensive designer clothes” way.\n\nPlus, as iconic as Maria’s original outfit is, it is unmistakably “late 1990s/early 2000s”. And her new outfit looks like it could have come from any time period between about the mid-late 1960s to the present day. So, this could be a way to make the game more timeless whilst getting the same general idea across.)\n\nThe original “Silent Hill 2” (2001) was a genuinely mature game, an intelligent work of art with lots of psychological depth. And, as a side-effect, the characters in it are a lot more realistic than the stylised characters found in some other games of the time. This was also a “mature” game which – unusually for the time – was aimed at a more general older audience as well.\n\nYes, unless you grew up in the 2000s and were a fan of survival horror games back then, it can be difficult to – legally – play the original game these days. Greedy collectors and/or re-sellers have driven up second-hand prices and the 2012 attempt at a remaster didn’t go well. So, I can understand some of the critics just not understanding the original game (although there are no shortage of websites and videos explaining it).\n\nAnd, whilst there probably are valid criticisms to be made of the trailers – such as the generic modern “over the shoulder” camera, the unfinished-looking UI design etc… – the more realistic visual storytelling in the new version of Angela probably isn’t one of them. And, if they released a DRM-free edition of the remake, optimised for really low-spec PCs and costing about £15-20, then I’d probably still buy and play it in a heartbeat.\n\n——————-\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, it has been absolutely ages since I last wrote a stand-alone “Horror Videogames Series” article, and I thought that I’d look at the interesting connections between the original “Silent Hill 2” (2001) and some types of “New Thought” spirituality today. I think that I alluded to this topic in at least one older article from the series, but I thought it was worth taking a closer look.\n\nOther people have possibly mentioned this before but – given that the overlap between “edgy horror videogame fans” and “cheerful new age manifestors” is probably relatively small – perhaps not.\n\nThis article will contain MAJOR PLOT SPOILERS for “Silent Hill 2” (2001). And, because of this, it will also contain DISTURBING SUBJECT MATTER too.\n\nIf you haven’t heard of “New Thought” spirituality, it covers a range of beliefs but I’ll be focusing on the most popular element of it these days – namely the concept that your experience of reality is a reflection of your beliefs/state of being/emotions/thoughts etc….\n\nOf course, this concept has much older roots than 19th/20th century mysticism. Elements of it can be found in everything from the Buddhist and/or Hindu concept of “karma” to some passages from the Christian Bible (such as Galatians 6:7: “Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap”).\n\nStill, the idea is popular today because of the concept of “manifestation”. There are two main popular interpretations of this. The most common one – taught by people like Rhonda Byrne and Abraham-Hicks – is the “Law Of Attraction”. This is idea that everything – especially emotion and thought – has a “vibration” and that an external god or “source” will give you what you desire if your “vibration” matches with it for long enough. If you feel like you already have it.\n\nA slightly less popular – but I’d argue much more interesting – interpretation is the “Law Of Assumption” taught by the 20th century mystic Neville Goddard (1905-1972). Goddard taught that consciousness itself – or awareness of being – is divine and that “manifestation” happens because reality itself is a reflection of consciousness.\n\nIn this belief system – which also has some similarities with pantheism and/or solipsism (depending on how you look at it) – your first-person perspective experience of reality is a reflection of your beliefs about it and your “state”. This is a term referring to everything from how you see yourself to the person you are being in any given moment. If you change who you are being or what you realistically believe, then – according to Goddard – your reality will alter itself correspondingly.\n\nBut what does any of this have to do with “Silent Hill 2” (2001)?\n\nIn short, I’d argue that “Silent Hill 2” (2001) is an exploration of the “dark side” of this concept. It tells the story of a mourning widower called James Sunderland who – seemingly out of nowhere – receives a letter from his former wife, Mary, asking him to visit her in the resort town of “Silent Hill”. Even though he is uncertain, he goes there anyway. The town is shrouded with ominous fog and filled with hideous monsters.\n\nJames also meets an assortment of troubled characters, including a woman called Maria who is a “similar, but different” version of Mary, before he is eventually pushed to acknowledge the truth behind Mary’s death and his own feelings of guilt about it. Whilst he deliberately caused it, the game leaves his motivations for this slightly ambiguous – with it either being a merciful form of euthanasia or a murder motivated by his despair about her illness.\n\nThis psychological horror/survival horror game from over two decades ago is widely regarded as one of the best horror games ever made, thanks to its well-written characters, memorable atmosphere, excellent story and the sheer level of attention to detail throughout the game. The original game can be a bit difficult to find these days (with second-hand PS2/Xbox/PC copies sometimes being rather pricey) but there is apparently a modern remake of it being prepared by another studio called Bloober Team at the moment.\n\nAnyway, one of the main themes of the game is that the town of Silent Hill reflects James’ psyche. There are a ton of small details in the game which play into this – whether it is how Maria’s more free-spirited and seductive character design hints that she is the person James wanted Mary to be. Whether it is how the monster designs reflect various themes in James’ psyche (eg: judgement/execution, repressed lust, medical settings etc...).\n\nWhether it is how the levels reflect James’ life story, with the game going from an apartment block to a hospital to a history museum/prison to the hotel he remembers visiting with Mary. Whether this is how mirrors are a recurring motif in the game – with the story beginning with James staring at himself in a mirror, and a disturbing scene where another character called Angela reclines despondently beside a giant mirror whilst holding a knife. Whether it is how the game’s muted colour palette reflects James’ feelings of depression. Even the game’s other characters – except Maria and possibly a child called Laura – are also shown to experience worlds which reflect their horrible pasts.\n\nThe most chilling and tragic example of this is probably Angela, a young woman who is implied to have suffered horrible abuse at the hands of her family and then murdered them in retaliation. In her final scene in the game, we see the town from her perspective. Everything is on fire, hinting that this is how she got revenge. Before she walks away from James, she also points out that “For me it’s always like this“, implying that her world is a reflection of her worst memories.\n\nThe theme of a reflective world runs throughout the entire game and, although it may have been influenced by other belief systems than “New Thought” spirituality (given the time and context the game was made in, I’d argue that Buddhist/Hindu “karma”, Western psychology and/or possibly elements of Christianity might have been a larger influence on a game made in early 2000s Japan), it’s impossible not to notice the similarities if you’ve studied anything “New Thought”-related.\n\n“Silent Hill 2” (2001) is a really interesting game because it – perhaps inadvertently – shows the “dark side” of a philosophy that often has a very cheerful public image, one filled with pastel-coloured social media posts and “inspirational” quotes about manifesting money or romantic relationships. Yet, if you read into the topic, then any serious texts about it (eg: Goddard, Hicks etc...) will often point out that it is a completely neutral principle. That it reflects bad things as well as good things. And “Silent Hill 2” is, on a symbolic/thematic level, perhaps a cautionary tale about what can go wrong…\n\n————–\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, I hadn’t planned to write another stand-alone “Horror Videogames Series” article this month, but I had to. And, yes, this one will be something of a short and enthusiastic sleep-deprived ramble too. I seem to be writing articles whilst tired a lot recently…\n\nStill, I had to write this article because, back in mid-late January, I happened to see an “Ink Ribbon” video where Kai Morgan looks at an old copy of Electronic Games Monthly from October 2001 (more likely September 2001 in reality, since magazines usually printed the date a month in advance. Still don’t know why...).\n\nSPOILERS ahoy for anything “Silent Hill” or Dario Argento related!\n\nOne thing in the video seriously caught my attention. If you pause the video at 18:30, you can see a close-up of part of the preview article about the original version of “Silent Hill 2” (2001), where the journalists point out that the game was inspired by classic 1960s/70s Italian Giallo horror/crime films.\n\nThey then point out that Akihiro Imamura, the game’s producer, considers Dario Argento’s legendary 1977 art-horror masterpiece “Suspiria” to be the scariest horror film he has ever seen (And I believe him! The very first time I tried to watch “Suspiria”, I could only make it half an hour into the film before I fled in fright…). And, yes, the date in the magazine article was an error – Suspiria was released in 1977, not 1976.\n\nAnyway, as someone who has literally written an entire article about how “Suspiria” has influenced horror games, I’m genuinely surprised that I didn’t spot this. I mean, I got that the random red lighting in one of the hospital rooms in “Silent Hill 3” (2003) was possibly influenced by the film – and that the plot/characters/themes in “Silent Hill 3”, in turn, probably influenced Luca Guadagnino’s 2018 remake of “Suspiria” – but I never thought about “Silent Hill 2” (2001) in this way until now. It actually sort of makes sense.\n\nYes, the muted grey aesthetic of the game – its almost in black & white – is about as far as you can get from the vivid psychedelic nightmare that is “Suspiria” (1977), but the almost dream-like style of the game is actually very close to classic Dario Argento films. Seriously, one of the defining features of classic Dario Argento horror films is that they can often include all sorts of bizarre and surreal elements that are purely there for the sake of scariness. Likewise, quite a few of Argento’s horror films – such as “Phenomena” (1985) and “Opera” (1987) – include bizarre and random plot twists designed to shock the audience.\n\nOk, in some ways, “Silent Hill 2” is the exact opposite of this too. The game’s plot is meticulously constructed, with all sorts of clever foreshadowing and stuff. Even if the premise of “A haunted town that shapes itself around your worst memories” is a little bizarre. Yet, there is still a lot of random side-stuff that is there to add an ominous atmosphere to the game. Whether it is the disturbing stories of the other lost souls who are trapped in the town (eg: Angela and Eddie) or even stuff like the “There was a hole here...” graffiti on the shop window or the random mannequin wearing Mary’s clothes etc… Seriously, it’s more subtle than a Dario Argento film, but it’s a similar technique.\n\nOf course, as the magazine article points out, classic Italian horror movies were only one of several influences on “Silent Hill 2” (2001) but I’m still astonished that I didn’t spot it. But, yes, some of the weirder elements of the game – and perhaps some subtle elements of its atmosphere – could well have been influenced by old Dario Argento, Lucio Fulci etc.. films. Possibly. I mean, I originally tried to draw comparisons between the game and Argento’s 1996 film “The Stendhal Syndrome”, but it seemed like a bit of a stretch (eg: a female character who exists in two versions, someone not realising that they are a killer etc..).\n\nWeirdly though, one way that “Silent Hill 2” (2001) is different from “Suspiria” (1977) is its dialogue and voice-acting. Because “Suspiria” (1977) was originally filmed in several languages, each actor spoke their own language and then the film was dubbed afterwards, the dialogue often sounds a bit like the sort of “corny voice-acting” you’d expect from an old survival horror game. Yet, “Silent Hill 2” (2001) was perhaps the first game in the genre to actually put a bit more effort and nuance into its voice-acting…\n\nI don’t know what the point of this article is, I just find it astonishing that one of the best horror films ever made could have had an influence – albeit a slightly subtle and difficult to see one – on what is widely regarded as one of the best horror videogames ever made. Seriously, the original “Silent Hill 2” (2001) is over twenty years old and you can still learn new stuff about it…\n\n—————————-\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, for this article in my series about horror videogames, I thought that I’d talk briefly about how horror games can use location design to set an emotional tone. To give you examples of this, I’ll be taking a look at two of the most well-designed survival horror games ever made – I am, of course, talking about “Silent Hill 2” (2001) and the 2002 remake of “Resident Evil”.\n\nThe main emotional tone that “Silent Hill 2” tries to set is one of bleak loneliness and melancholy sorrow. Although a host of different things like music, writing/dialogue, character design etc… go into creating this emotional tone, a lot of it also comes from the way that the game’s locations are designed.\n\nIn short, there’s relatively little detail and lots of open space. You’ll be spending a lot of time just walking or running through “empty” locations. Even the game’s “claustrophobic” indoor levels often feature bare walls and extended corridors – and most of the doors you see cannot be opened. The colour palette of all of these locations is deliberately muted too, often just being a desaturated palette of grey, green and brown. It is deliberately designed to be – dare I say it – boring.\n\nSeriously, this entire article was inspired by the fact that I spent about an hour re-playing part of “Silent Hill 2” and at least half of that time was just spent running along lengthy corridors, wide roads and almost-endless staircases. Yet, far from being a flaw, this “boredom” is essential to the game. Not only does it give the player time to soak in the coldly bleak minimalism of many locations, but it helps to hammer home just how alone the main character is. The locations are huge, and the main character is tiny by comparison.\n\nThese long empty corridors and large wide-open outdoor areas also deliberately slow down the pacing of the gameplay, making the relatively few encounters with weak monsters feel genuinely dramatic and scary too. And, even if you hold down the “run” button, then the vast emptiness of many areas still comes across surprisingly well… given that they are large enough to still take a while to traverse when running as fast as possible. It feels lonely and empty… which is exactly the mood that the game is trying to evoke in the player.\n\nOne of the defining things about the “Silent Hill” series is minimalism and/or understatement. These are games that will often imply things or leave stuff to the player’s imagination. These are games that can make something as basic as radio static sound genuinely frightening just from the context it is used in. These are games where the settings often look like they have been abandoned or stripped of all human life. And the large empty spaces and long corridors in “Silent Hill 2” play into this philosophy absolutely perfectly and use it to evoke a depressing feeling of emptiness and loss.\n\nIn contrast, the 2002 remake of “Resident Evil” tries to set a tense and suspenseful emotional tone. Although it also does this using numerous other methods like placing strict limitations on the player, using delayed jump scares, including monsters with different movement speeds etc… the location designs in this game play a large role in setting this mood too.\n\nMost of the game takes place in contained, claustrophobic locations. These locations have a density to them that is literally the polar opposite of “Silent Hill 2”. Most of the corridors in this game are relatively short and filled with doors that not only can be opened but often must be opened at some point. Even the game’s outdoor areas are relatively small, tightly-contained locations with little in the way of free-roaming exploration on offer to the player. Its a cramped and confining game world… with less room to run away from monsters!\n\nInstead of evoking a bleak mood through cold soulless minimalism, the 2002 remake of “Resident Evil” takes the opposite approach. Many of the locations in this game are designed to overwhelm the player with ornate complex detail. Even the more “utilitarian” areas later in the game are often lavishly lit and filled with all sorts of dramatic background details. Virtually every frame of this game is a beautiful painting. And all of this visual splendour is designed to be subtly overwhelming – further adding to the game’s “out of your depth” feeling of tense suspense.\n\nEven the game’s colour palette is designed to be slightly dramatic – with many locations using almost subliminal complementary colour pairs. Blue/orange (or muted brown and bluish light) and red/green (eg: deep red/brown and pale green) seem to be the most common. Some areas even subtly play against the player’s expectations in order to keep them on their guard, such as a red-walled room you can find… which is perfectly safe and free from monsters.\n\nThe lighting in this game is also bold and dramatic, filled with ominous contrasts between light and darkness. The claustrophobic mansion that most of the game takes place in really does look like a creepy old haunted mansion (albeit with zombies instead of ghosts). And this classic horror movie setting really helps to create a feeling of tension and suspense because of all of the memories of actual horror movies that it evokes.\n\nSo, yes, something as basic as location design can have a huge effect on the emotional tone of a horror game. Whether it is the lonely corridors and eerie emptiness of “Silent Hill 2” or the dense, tense and claustrophobic mansion in the “Resident Evil” remake, these places have been specifically designed to set a particular mood in numerous subtle ways.\n\n———————–\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, for this article in my series about horror videogames, I thought that I’d take another look at both “Silent Hill 2” (2001) and “Silent Hill 4” (2004). This is mostly because the four classic “Silent Hill” games can be divided into two mini-series. The odd-numbered games tell a continuous story (albeit with a time gap between each game), and the even-numbered games tell separate – but connected – stories.\n\nBefore I go any further, I should warn you that this article will contain SPOILERS.\n\nAlthough I personally prefer the general style and atmosphere of the odd-numbered games (especially “Silent Hill 3” (2003)), there’s no denying that the even-numbered games are the scariest classic games in the series. But, why?\n\nWell, I think a lot of it is to do with their themes and visual style. Unlike the more overtly paranormal and occult events of the first and third games, the second and fourth games in the series are much more heavily grounded in real-life horrors. They do include paranormal elements, but the main focus is on more realistic horrors. Not only do these two games include some seriously heavy themes (eg: loneliness, murder, terminal illness, bereavement etc...), but there is also an even stronger emphasis on psychological horror in these two games too. These are games about self-loathing, claustrophobia, emotional trauma etc…\n\nA lot of this also has to do with the scale of the stories being told. Both the first and third games tell a larger-scale story with strong cosmic horror elements. On the other hand, the stories of the second and fourth games in the series are a lot more small-scale. Not only are they separate stories, with only vague connections to each other, but they are also heavily focused on a small number of characters too. Not only does this small-scale focus add a lot more intensity to the stories of these games, but their self-contained nature also means that they player won’t know what to expect when they play one of these games for the first time either.\n\nYes, “Silent Hill 4” does include some occult horror elements – but even these seem to be much smaller in scale than those found in the first and third games. Instead of grand magical plots involving ancient gods and nightmarish apocalypses, the villain of the fourth game just wants to… haunt the main character’s flat. The evil things he does just to achieve this “small” goal are one of the things that makes this game surprisingly creepy.\n\nNot only that, the visual style of the even-numbered games in the series is slightly more mundane and muted than the one found in the odd-numbered games. Everything in these two games just seems a bit more grey, cold and desaturated when compared to the vivid orange rust-covered nightmares found in the first and third games. This difference is reasonably subtle most of the time, with all four games having a strong emphasis on gloomy visual bleakness, but the overall palette and visual mood of the first and third games just seems a tiny bit… warmer… than the second or fourth games.\n\nThere is also more emotional warmth in the first and third games in the series too. The protagonists of these two games are father and daughter and, although their lives are tragic, we still get to directly see some very brief hints of the happier times that they spend together (such as the alternate intro to the first game showing Harry and Cybil holding baby Heather, or Heather’s phone call to Harry at the beginning of the third game).\n\nLikewise, in the first game, Harry meets at least one or two friendly characters (such as Cybil). In the third game, Heather will sometimes make amusingly sarcastic observations when you look at things. When Heather has to do introspection about her past, it is scary but ultimately beneficial to her. Not only that, the third game also offers something of a – relatively – happy resolution to the horrific events that a character called Alyssa went through during the first game too.\n\nOn the other hand, the second game begins with the happier parts of main character James Sunderland’s life being nothing more than fading memories. He has also deliberately repressed other memories of his past too. He revisits a place that he once had good times in, but finds it to be cold and empty. Virtually everyone he meets there is creepy, suspicious and/or tragic in some way or another. The one friendly character he meets – Maria – later turns out to actually be there to torment him. Even James himself is someone who you will probably end up liking a lot less as the game progresses and you learn more about him. It’s a bleak, cynical game with little to no emotional warmth or likeable characters.\n\nThe main character of the fourth game is… boring. We learn virtually nothing about his backstory and he barely even has a personality. Although he meets a likeable character, his neighbour Eileen, horrible stuff happens to her during at least one or two parts of the game. Tragic ghosts haunt many levels of the game. Not only that, the bulk of this game’s characterisation is actually focused on the creepy serial killer villain rather than the main characters too. Again, there’s relatively little in the way of emotional warmth in this game.\n\nSo, yes, the second and fourth “Silent Hill” games are the scariest games in the series because they tell small-scale mostly self-contained stories with a slightly more “realistic” type of horror and little to nothing in the way of emotional warmth to reassure the player. Again, I personally prefer the atmosphere and style of the first and third “Silent Hill” games – but the other two classic games in the series are the scariest.\n\n——————\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, for this article in my series about horror videogames, I thought that I’d compare the accompanying characters in “Silent Hill 2” (2001) and “Silent Hill 4” (2004).\n\nBoth games feature segments where the main character (James in “Silent Hill 2” and Henry in “Silent Hill 4”) is accompanied by another character (Maria in “Silent Hill 2” and Eileen in “Silent Hill 4”) for part of the game.\n\nYet, despite these superficial similarities, the two games handle this in completely opposite ways. But I should give a SPOILER warning for both games before I go any further.\n\nIn fact, I had almost forgotten that Maria accompanies James for parts of “Silent Hill 2” because it happens for narrative reasons and has little effect on the minute-to-minute gameplay. Yes, Maria will occasionally lag behind James and get out of breath if you run for too long. Maria can also appear to take damage from monsters too – although only if she accidentally happens to be standing in between James and the monster, since the monsters are more interested in James. Plus, if you run on ahead and enter a room, Maria will also teleport there pretty much instantly.\n\nAlthough Maria originally makes a comment about not wanting to be left alone, the gameplay is structured in a way that James doesn’t really have to protect her. He might feel like he does – and she can also get angry at him if he doesn’t visit her during one part of the game – but, if you know the game’s story, then the fact that she isn’t really in any serious danger makes perfect sense. Yes, she appears to die at one point in the game but she then shows up completely unharmed later because she – probably – isn’t an ordinary person. She is a supernatural/psychological manifestation of the haunted town of Silent Hill, a distorted reflection of James’ late wife Mary – who is implied to be the type of person James secretly wanted Mary to be.\n\nYet, if you play the “Born From A Wish” bonus game included with some editions of “Silent Hill 2”, it is strongly implied that Maria both didn’t exist before James arrived in town yet also exists independently of him too. She meets a ghost in an old house, and there is some ambiguity over whether she is similar to this ghost. This bonus game also begins with a creepy scene where she expresses some fairly bleak emotions when she is alone. Still, the ambiguity about Maria’s humanity and her motivations certainly adds an extra note of unsettling horror to the game.\n\nShe accompanies James for part of the game purely for narrative reasons. As such, there are few to none of the traditional gameplay mechanics that you’d expect from this sort of segment, since Maria doesn’t need protecting. Yet, most players will probably be tricked into acting in a protective way thanks to prior experience with protecting accompanying characters in other games. It’s one of the many subtle ways that “Silent Hill 2” messes with the player’s mind.\n\nOn the other hand, the accompanied segment of “Silent Hill 4” (2004) is not only considerably longer – taking up almost half of the game – but it is very much there for gameplay reasons. Although Eileen plays a role in the game’s story, she isn’t really a major part of it because the story is much more heavily focused on a serial killer called Walter Sullivan.\n\nInstead, Eileen is primarily there for gameplay reasons. The entire style and pacing of the gameplay changes when Eileen shows up. Due to injuries sustained earlier in the game, she cannot climb ladders – forcing the player to find alternate routes around familiar areas, whilst also adding suspenseful vulnerability to her character too.\n\nShe can also take long-lasting damage from monsters – which not only results in some really creepy dialogue from her but also drastically increases the chance of a bad ending by reducing the amount of time the player has to save her during the final boss battle. The player can heal her with candles that can also be used for exorcisms in another segment of the game – but these are a limited resource, so there is an emphasis on protecting Eileen.\n\nHowever, unlike the passive side-characters in other games, she can actually help Henry out in combat. Weirdly, the game has “Eileen-specific” weapons that only she can use. Several of these have either stylised feminine symbolism (eg: a handbag) or suggestive symbolism (eg: a riding crop) – which could either be a slightly dated “of its time” element or, more likely, one of the many subtle ways that the game evokes a deliberately creepy sleazy mood. She’s also subtly presented as being an “opposite” version of another character called Cynthia, who tries to seduce Henry at one point. This is also evocative of the duality between Mary and Maria in “Silent Hill 2” too.\n\nThe game’s “Eileen-specific” weapons add tension to the game by creating a dilemma for the player. On the one hand, it is useful to have another armed character by your side. On the other hand, Eileen’s weapons are not only weaker than the ones Henry can use – but giving weapons to Eileen can also put her in additional danger too. This is because she is programmed to almost always stay behind and fight monsters if Henry tries to run away from them. And leaving her behind is a really bad idea. So, as “useful” as this feature may seem at first glance, it is often better not to give Eileen any weapons – so that she’ll focus on fleeing with Henry, rather than fighting monsters.\n\nIn “Silent Hill 4”, Eileen is mostly there for gameplay reasons. There is a strong emphasis on protecting her, and her presence not only makes the player think more strategically about combat but also forces the player to find new routes through familiar areas that they have visited earlier. She’s there to add extra suspense to the moment-to-moment gameplay of the second half of “Silent Hill 4”.\n\nSo, yes, whilst both games include ostensibly similar segments where the main character is accompanied by another character, these segments are designed in radically different ways for different reasons. In “Silent Hill 2”, the segments with Maria are designed to emphasise the narrative elements. In “Silent Hill 4”, the segments with Eileen are mostly there for gameplay reasons.\n\n———————\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, for this article in my series about horror videogames, I thought that I’d look at why “Silent Hill 2” (2001) is such a famous survival horror game. If you read or watch things about horror videogames, you’ll see almost nothing but praise for this game. It is widely considered to be a classic amongst almost everyone who has played it. But, why?\n\nFirst of all, there is the game’s story. Even though “point and click” horror games have been focusing on storytelling since at least the early-mid 1990s, “Silent Hill 2” was the first horror game on both a popular games console (the Playstation 2 and, later, the Xbox too) and in a well-known horror franchise to focus much more heavily on story. Although console-based horror games before this did usually include a creepy story, the main emphasis was usually on the gameplay rather than the story.\n\nAnd, whilst “Silent Hill 2” also thankfully includes lots of well-designed horror gameplay too, it is a game that has a much heavier focus on story. Whilst I won’t spoil it for anyone who hasn’t played the game, it tells a much more complex and well-written horror story than you might expect from an early 2000s horror game. The ending of this game is not something you are likely to ever forget after you’ve experienced it!\n\nBut, whilst the game has a timelessly creepy main plot that wouldn’t seem out of place in a prestigious horror movie or possibly even a horror novel, the writing in other areas also cemented the game’s reputation too. It is a game that includes at least two or three creepy sub-plots involving side-characters that the player can meet. These sub-plots handle some seriously heavy subject matter (eg: bullying, serial killing, depression, sex crimes etc...) in a surprisingly understated and non-sensationalist way. They use ambiguity, implication and mystery to make the player think more about the horrifying things that they are hearing about or seeing. The writing here displays a level of genuine maturity not previously found in so-called “mature” console games.\n\nBut, most of all, the game’s characters are seriously well-written. Virtually every character in this game has a distinctive personality, a creepy backstory and/or lots of complex moral ambiguity. This is helped by a number of subtle things, like how the dialogue often includes moments of hesitation and how – unlike many previous survival horror games – the voice-acting in this game is actually reasonably decent too. There’s no corny unintentional comedy or anything like that here. It’s a seriously well-written game that tells a serious story. And this was surprisingly rare in console games of the time.\n\nThere is also the general atmosphere and design of the game. As brilliantly disturbing as the story is, the most disturbing part of “Silent Hill 2” is just its general atmosphere. This is a game that creates an oppressively bleak, depressing, tragic, lonely and grim mood via numerous subtle game design decisions. It was one of the relatively few horror games of the time that… lingered… after you’d played it for a while. Unlike the Hollywood bombast of many games in the rival “Resident Evil” series, this game went for a much more insidious and subtle type of atmosphere-based psychological horror.\n\nWhether it was the desolate locations (in what was once a cheerful resort town), the muted colour palette, the bittersweet music, the slow pacing, the gloomy lighting, numerous subtly creepy background details, the way that the (somewhat repetitive) monsters were more there to give the impression of danger than to seriously threaten the player, the frequent use of psychological symbolism in the monster designs, the emotions expressed by the characters, the general themes of the game etc… this was a game that often eschewed immediate shocks and melodrama for much more of a slow-building atmosphere. And what an atmosphere it is!\n\nThe exact mood of this game is completely unique. Yes, earlier and later games in the series tried to evoke a similar mood – and “Silent Hill 4” (2004) probably got the closest to it – but this game stands alone in terms of its intensely melancholy and bleak mood. It’s subtle, yet overwhelming. Disturbing, yet not outright frightening. I could go on for a while….\n\nFinally, there is also the game’s relative rarity these days. Unlike literary and film “classics”, its hit-and-miss whether classic games get preserved. And, like the buildings in the game, “Silent Hill 2” has been horribly neglected. Unless you were lucky enough to buy a copy of the game during the 2000s, then getting hold of it these days can be a little bit more costly than you may expect for an old game. Yes, Konami tried to release a HD edition of the game in 2012… but they famously botched this and released a downgraded version of the game filled with lots of well-documented glitches, alterations etc…. Nothing has been heard from the game since.\n\nIn contrast, the other major “This is a classic!” survival horror game from the early-mid 2000s – the astonishingly good 2002 remake of “Resident Evil” – has received modern HD re-releases on multiple platforms. The company behind the game – Capcom – made active efforts towards keeping the game current, especially considering how it could very easily have fallen into obscurity and rarity. It was originally only released on the Nintendo Gamecube as part of an ill-advised exclusivity deal and, given the different direction the series went in from the mid-2000s onwards, it would have been easy for Capcom to dismiss the game as “old” and abandon it. But they didn’t! They recognised the quality of what they had made and took active steps to keep this classic easily available to modern players.\n\nAlas, this didn’t happen with “Silent Hill 2”. So, it has been left up to fans of this regrettably neglected game to keep its memory alive. This is probably why the game has such a fervent fanbase and why fans of it talk about it at almost every opportunity. Given that the internet gave these fans more of a voice, not to mention that some of these fans included traditional games journalists too, the memory of this game has thankfully been kept alive in print and online for the two decades after it first appeared.\n\nAnd, yes, this game is actually two decades old these days. How’s that for something scary?\n\n—————————————–\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, for this article in my series about horror videogames, I thought that I’d take another look at the second and third “Silent Hill” games. In particular, how both of them handle the theme of memory in some interestingly creepy and incredibly clever ways.\n\nNeedless to say, this article will contain MAJOR SPOILERS for both games (plus, “Silent Hill” (1999) – and both the 2018 and 1977 versions of “Suspiria” too) and, since these are psychological horror games, DISTURBING CONTENT too.\n\nLet’s start with “Silent Hill 2” (2001), which begins with one of the best introductory sequences you will ever see in a horror videogame. After a moody scene showing a weary-looking man – James – staring at himself in a dirty mirror in a dilapidated roadside bathroom, he walks outside and looks out over a grey, fog-shrouded forest at a mysterious town in the distance.\n\nThen, in a voice-over, we hear his wife Mary talking fondly about her memories of going on holiday to the resort town of Silent Hill with him. She says that she is waiting for him in their “special place”. Then James takes over the voice-over to explain that was remembering a letter that he got from Mary recently. However, Mary died three years earlier from an unspecified disease. Yet, even though he’s sure that the letter can’t be real, he still has to visit the town in case she is somehow there.\n\nOne of the most interesting parts of this introduction is the excellent use of visual contrast to show the passing of time and the difference between memory and reality. When James remembers Mary’s letter, the emotional tone is a lot warmer and more nostalgic – yet the first thing that the player sees of this rose-tinted resort town is a cold, bleak and harsh landscape.\n\nThis is further emphasised when the peacefully bittersweet guitar music suddenly gives way to eerie, echoing ambient noise as soon as the voice-over ends. The game is set in the same place that both James and Mary remember, but the passage of time has changed it from something warm and joyous to something cold and empty. If you’ve ever revisited somewhere that you felt nostalgic about, only to find that it is different to what you remember – then you’ll probably understand how expertly the game captures THIS feeling.\n\nThis theme is further emphasised when James meets another character called Maria. She is similar to his late wife, Mary, but she is also different in both visual and character terms. Whilst Mary dressed conservatively, Maria wears more of a “party” outfit. Whilst Mary had slightly faded light brown hair, Maria has bleached blonde hair. Their personalities are also subtly different too – with Maria being more care-free, expressive and seductive. There’s a very strong implication that Maria is the kind of person James wanted Mary to be. As well as being a brilliant example of Freud’s concept of “The Uncanny“, Maria is a literal manifestation of James’ rose-tinted memories… whilst the manifestation of his real memories of Mary literally turn into a vengeful monster at the end of the game. Why “vengeful”? Well, read on…\n\nOf course, the theme of memory in this game goes a lot deeper than this. As fans of the game will already know, Mary was ill but didn’t die of a disease. She was murdered…by James. However, James has repressed his guilty memories so much that he genuinely believes that she has succumbed to the disease until – in a shocking plot twist, foreshadowed in all sorts of clever subtle ways – he finally remembers everything. It is a game about extreme guilt and self-loathing, about the gulf between rose-tinted memory and bleak reality. And this is probably one of the main reasons why it’s such a deeply unsettling and memorable horror game.\n\n“Silent Hill 3” (2003) is also very much a game about memories too, but it handles them in a slightly different – and arguably more clever – way. The main character, Heather Mason, is an ordinary teenager who begins the game by having a nightmare about a rusty, dilapidated monster-filled fairground before waking up at a café table in an ordinary shopping centre. She calls her father and is about to return home, when a creepy private detective tries to talk to her. She hides in a bathroom – but notices a strange occult symbol painted on the mirror that seems oddly familiar to her. She makes a comment about how much she hates mirrors. Then, after climbing out of the window, the world around her slowly begins to turn into a distorted nightmare-world, not unlike the one in her dream….\n\nAlthough the plot of this game only fully makes sense if you’ve played “Silent Hill” (1999) first – the general point of it is that Heather is a reincarnation of a character from that game. A young girl called Alyssa who was raised by a mysterious cult and who slowly died in agony after suffering horrendous injuries in a fire. Heather has completely repressed her memories of being in a cult or her painful death, yet – as the game progresses – more and more of these memories begin to emerge. At one point, she looks in a mirror and sees a bloodstained/burned Alyssa-like reflection of herself surrounded by tendrils of blood… before the blood gradually begins to appear on the other side of the mirror, symbolising her repressed past seeping into her present. Later, she actually has to fight that reflection in a challenging boss battle.\n\nThis game is one of the best expressions of introspection and how bad memories can linger. Heather is also literally infected with her past – eg: a creepy parasite that has taken up residence inside her body – and the scene where she gets rid of it is kind of a metaphor for dealing with bad memories. She also suddenly has “strange” reactions (eg: when using save points, looking at mirrors etc…) that she cannot initially explain and has to learn about via a journey of self-discovery.\n\nBecause of the game’s focus on introspection and on processing and conquering bad memories, it is a very scary – yet also weirdly “feel-good”- kind of horror game at the same time. One of the only other things I’ve found that uses this exact style of horror is Luca Guadagnino’s 2018 remake of Dario Argento’s 1977 art-horror masterpiece “Suspiria“.\n\nGuadagnino’s remake makes some major changes to the plot of Argento’s original and one of the best ones is that a powerful ancient witch – Mater Suspiriorum – isn’t just a random horror villain that the main character fights shortly before the end credits, but is instead… the main character herself. Like Heather Mason, the main character in this film (Susie Bannion, played by Dakota Johnson) comes from a stifling cult-like religious background and has repressed the fact that she is a reincarnation of this character.\n\nSeriously, in a weird way, the 2018 “Suspiria” remake is perhaps the very best adaptation of “Silent Hill 3” that I’ve ever seen. It even stars Tilda Swinton, who was the main inspiration for the original voice-acting/visual design of one of the villains (Claudia) in “Silent Hill 3” too – and she plays a vaguely similar type of character in “Suspiria” (2018). Yes, the film is different in a lot of ways – but, thematically speaking, it is a much better adaptation than “Silent Hill: Revelation” (2012) was. But, I’m getting side-tracked….\n\nAnyway, “Silent Hill 2” (2001) and “Silent Hill 3” (2003) are perhaps the absolute highlights of the series because of the really intelligent, nuanced and complex way that they use the theme of memory as both a central source of horror and drama. They are extremely well-written games.\n\n—————–\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂\n\nWell, for this article in my series about horror videogames, I thought that I’d look at what was possibly one of the greatest years in the genre’s history. Yes, a large number of classic-style survival horror games were released between 1996-2004, but 2001 stands out amongst them due to the sheer number of horror games that got a major release that year. And yes, it’s more than a little bit strange to think that this was twenty years ago….\n\nFirst of all, it’s impossible to talk about horror games from 2001 without beginning with “Silent Hill 2“. A stand-alone sequel to “Silent Hill” (1999), this game remains well-known and beloved by horror fans two decades later because of the high quality of its story, characterisation, atmosphere and writing.\n\nIn the vast majority of horror games preceding this one, story often seemed to be a little bit of an afterthought – with most of the scares coming from monsters, sound design, gameplay design etc… instead. On the other hand, “Silent Hill 2” used both its story and characters to deeply unsettling effect. This is a game filled with clever moments of foreshadowing, lots of moral ambiguity and a wide variety of serious themes. It is a “mature” game in the most traditional sense of the word, telling a complex and disturbing story in a way that respects the audience’s intelligence. It is literally like playing a horror novel at times.\n\nNot only that, this game focused even more heavily on atmosphere than the first “Silent Hill” game did. Virtually everything in “Silent Hill 2” is there in order to add to the tragic, desolate and bleak atmosphere that will linger long after you have finished playing it. It is a masterclass in good horror game design, using things as subtle as background graffiti, pauses in the dialogue etc… to create an understated – yet deeply unsettling – atmosphere.\n\nPlus, although second-hand physical copies of “Silent Hill 2” are expensive these days (and the 2012 HD re-release of it is generally considered a downgraded version too), this game had a major influence on many other more easily-available horror games, with the best example probably being “Amnesia: The Dark Descent” (2010). Although this game differs a lot from “Silent Hill 2”, it still keeps the focus on atmospheric character-based psychological horror that made “Silent Hill 2” so great (and, arguably, even improves on it a bit too).\n\nAnother important game from 2001 – albeit one that didn’t get a European/US release until 2002 – is “Project Zero” (titled “Fatal Frame” in the US). In addition to influencing some later indie horror games like “DreadOut” (2014) – and to a much lesser extent, “Outlast” (2013) – the original “Project Zero” was a surprisingly innovative survival horror game when it was first released.\n\nFirst of all, although most of the gameplay is similar to a typical classic survival horror game, the game uses an innovative combat system – where you have to find and exorcise dangerous ghosts using the narrow viewfinder of an old camera. These heavily restricted first-person perspective elements really help to ramp up the suspense during every ghost encounter – especially given that the player has limited film and has to aim and time their shots carefully for maximum damage too.\n\nBut, in addition to this, it was one of the first major Japanese horror games to not only actually be set in Japan but also to draw on the style of psychological and/or paranormal horror common in Japanese films from around the time – such as Hideo Nakata’s 1998 film “Ring” – too.\n\nThe later international release of this game in 2002 was also perfectly timed too, appearing mere months before Gore Verbinski’s 2002 Hollywood remake of “Ring” (titled “The Ring”) made Japanese-style horror movies popular in the west for several years. This game’s challenge to the idea that “popular” horror games had to have a US setting has also been an inspiration for more modern indie studios and may possibly be responsible for the improved variety of settings in modern horror games too 🙂\n\nThirdly, there was “Resident Evil: Code Veronica X”. Yes, it was an enhanced re-release of a Dreamcast game from 2000 and it isn’t even the best classic “Resident Evil” game (that title probably goes to the timelessly brilliant 2002 Gamecube remake of “Resident Evil”, and possibly later HD re-releases of it too), but “Resident Evil: Code Veronica X” is notable because it was the first mainline “Resident Evil” game to use fully 3D graphics.\n\nWith the one exception of a spin-off first-person shooter/light gun game called “Resident Evil: Survivor” (2000), all previous games in the franchise had used pre-rendered 2D backgrounds and static camera angles. This was initally to allow for good looking graphics on limited older hardware, and the decision to keep it in the 2002 remake of “Resident Evil” is also the main reason why that game still holds up visually to this very day.\n\nHowever, “Resident Evil: Code Veronica X” traded a slight graphical downgrade for a much more fluid semi-fixed camera system that was much more similar to the classic “Silent Hill” games… where the camera could actually track the player as they moved, whilst still also being placed in various dramatic positions too.\n\nNot to mention that, whilst it wasn’t quite the very best classic “Resident Evil” game, it is far from being the very worst either (I’m looking at YOU “Resident Evil Zero” (2002) and “Resident Evil Gaiden” (2001)!). It has an isolated setting, a creepy villain and the kind of classic-style gameplay that made the older “Resident Evil” games so brilliant. Yes, a few brief moments and/or plot elements haven’t aged well, but it’s still a surprisingly solid game (and one I really must re-play properly sometime!).\n\nFinally, there was “Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare” (2001). An attempt at reviving the venerable “Alone In The Dark” series – the first game of which pretty much set the template for all subsequent 3D survival horror games back in 1992 – this game has to be praised for at least trying. Yes, I’ve attempted to play it three times – and got completely stuck (at least once by a game-breaking bug) each time – but I have to praise not only the effort but also the wonderful gothic atmosphere and visual style of this game too.\n\nTaking the premise of the series a bit more literally, the monsters in “Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare” can only be harmed and/or weakened by light. Not only was this a potential influence on the later game “Alan Wake” (2010) – which I tried to play a year or two ago, but stopped because of annoying mouse sensitivity issues – but it also added something new to the genre too.\n\nPlus, whilst “Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare” kept the classic style of gameplay that old-school survival horror games are known for, things like regenerating monsters, drastic gameplay differences between selectable characters (eg: Aline has more puzzles, Edward has more combat), more forgiving save limitations and even the ability to dodge at least one monster by just turning on the lights when you enter a specific room helped to make it stand out as it’s own thing.\n\nPlus, although “Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare” is my least favourite of these four games, it is probably the easiest and cheapest one to find and play these days, given that it has received a PC re-release on sites like GOG and Steam. But, although the DRM-free GOG edition seems to work better on modern PCs (it runs on my second-hand Windows 10 PC from 2013 at least), the reviews on the game’s Steam page seem to suggest that the Steam edition needs additional unofficial patches/fixes to run on modern PCs.\n\nSo, yes, 2001 was perhaps the pinnacle of classic survival horror games. Yes, several of the very best games in the genre were released in other years, but this was a year where four mainstream games in major horror franchises were released. Yes, “Project Zero”/”Fatal Frame” didn’t reach Europe and the US until 2002, but it’s original release (in Japan) was in 2001 though.\n\nAnother contributing factor to this was probably the fact that most of these games were the first games in their respective series to be released on the then-new Playstation 2, a console that allowed for drastically improved graphics than the original Playstation – yet still seems to have just about been inexpensive enough to develop for that mid-budget games (sort of the sweet spot for horror games in budgetary terms) could thrive on the console too. This allowed for a bit more creativity and also allowed very slightly more “niche” genres like horror to really flourish on the platform too 🙂\n\nLikewise, although 2001 was perhaps the pinnacle of mainstream horror games, everything from about 2010 to the present day onwards is the pinnacle of indie horror games. Seriously, the sheer number of awesome low-mid budget horror games released by smaller studios within the past decade or so has been absolutely astonishing. They may not be as well-known as the classics, and the style of gameplay may be a bit different, but a good number of them can often be even scarier in some ways. So, yes, the genre certainly hasn’t disappeared these days, even if it is ignored by almost all major “AAA” games companies (except maybe Capcom).\n\n—————\n\nAnyway, I hope that this was interesting 🙂"
