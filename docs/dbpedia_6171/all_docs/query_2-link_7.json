        "text": "​\n\nThe message of truth, hope, and beauty is our boast. It is the proclamation of a crucified Savior, a risen King, and a returning Redeemer. Chapel Hill Bible Church desires to see the powerful gospel of Jesus Christ bring glory to God as it forever transforms us, our city, and the world. Please join us as the grace of Jesus Christ makes us deeply joyful, deeply grateful, and deeply changed.\n\nEvery Sunday morning, we have folks available for conversation and assistance in the Guest Welcome area just off the foyer where the hospitable team is always ready to answer any questions you may have. Drop by after a service to meet some folks!\n\nwww.biblechurch.org\n\n919.408.0310\n\n​\n\nChrist Central Church is a Christ centered, cross cultural community that exists for the glory of God and the good of Durham. As a Church, we want to call our members to have a Kingdom worldview, using all vocations to the glory of God. This involves more than just being a “good Christian:” we want to promote fairness, justice, and equality in working spaces and educational systems, through the spread of the Gospel. As a Church we want to be highly relational — calling our members to love their neighbor and their city. We want to see this done by being intentional with people — to talk, listen, eat, and play with the purpose of loving our neighbor; to be intentional to shop, spend, eat, and work for justice in downtown with a purpose of loving our city. We want to be a church that is faithfully present downtown, having its faithful presence shown not just on Sunday, but Monday through Saturday as well, by its members living near and loving people in the city. Christ Central is a Church in the City for the City.\n\nwww.christcentraldurham.com\n\n919.259.3145\n\n​\n\n​\n\nWe are an evangelical congregation associated with the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). The mission of CGS is to make disciples of Jesus Christ on the northwest side of the Research Triangle, calling them into a devoted community of worshiping and maturing brothers and sisters, and sending them out into this culture and across cultures to be salt of the earth and light to the world to the glory of God. CGS’s vision is to become a thousand-member regional resource church that will be a center for the worship of God, a saltshaker affecting economic, cultural, and political life, and a catalyst for the evangelization of the diverse people groups in the Triangle and beyond.\n\nwww.cgsonline.org\n\n​\n\nAt the Summit, we believe the way to restore our hearts and our families is found in experiencing the radical, life-changing love of God in the Gospel of Jesus Christ and becoming the followers of God we were created to be. Jesus does some of His best work through relationships, so we are committed to developing local communities of believers. Through local small groups, children’s and student ministries, family ministries, and regional campuses, we want to be in your community. We also believe that real “ministry” happens outside the church, not inside our auditorium on the weekend. We’ll equip you to impact your community. The Summit Church participates with over a dozen of the most effective city-transforming agencies in the RDU area, and is also committed to planting churches in strategic cities all over the world. Lastly, we believe the greatest asset of the follower of Jesus is prayer. We meet all throughout the city weekly to pray–for each other, for our families, and for what God is doing in our city and around the world.\n\nwww.summitrdu.com\n\nWaypoint Church exists for two main reasons, first to be a preview of the coming Kingdom, and second, to advance that Kingdom on Earth.\n\nWaypoint wants the world to be able to look at the church and, through the beauty of our diversity, service, worship, forgiveness, and joy, get a taste of Christ's future Kingdom and want to be a part of it.\n\nJesus, our champion, has already inaugurated His rule by His life, death, resurrection, and ascension, but our mission is to advance His kingdom on earth as it is in heaven by sharing the gospel, making disciples, proclaiming the word of God, pursuing justice in the streets, and living mercifully in community.\n\n​\n\nwww.waypointrdu.com\n\nThe Congregation at Duke University Chapel serves as the church home for those who worship at Duke Chapel.\n\nAn interdenominational community of students, faculty, families, and community members, we come from across campus and around the Triangle. Through education, mission, and fellowship, we strive to deepen our relationship with God, with each other, and with our neighbors.\n\nJoin us for University Worship each Sunday at 11\n\nhttp://congregation.chapel.duke.edu/"
