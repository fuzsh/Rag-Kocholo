        "text": "The Duke Accelerated Pastoral Formation Program offers select juniors and seniors at United Methodist Church-affiliated partner colleges and universities the option to begin coursework toward Dukeâ€™s Hybrid Master of Divinity program while completing their baccalaureate degree. This enables students to begin ministry sooner and incur less educational debt.\n\nLaunched in 2021, the Hybrid Master of Divinity program at Duke Divinity School allows students to remain connected to the communities where they are already engaged in ministry while pursuing their degree program. Students serving in the ministry field are able to complete their program of study through a combination of weeklong intensives in Durham and synchronous online coursework."
