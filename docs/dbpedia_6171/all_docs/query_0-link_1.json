        "text": "Buy from: Duke Kit / Duke University Cycling Kit — Long Sleeve Jersey\n\nDuke University, despite being nondenominational, maintains a close connection with the Methodist Church. This relationship has shaped the university’s identity in numerous ways.\n\nA Religious Legacy:\n\nDuke’s association with Methodism dates back to its founding in 1837. The university’s founders were devout Methodists, and their faith influenced the early development of the institution. This legacy is evident in the university’s motto, chosen in 1859: “Eruditio et Religio” (Erudition and Religion).\n\nReligious Influences:\n\nThe Methodist affiliation has influenced Duke’s academic and social life. For example:\n\nDuke’s Divinity School is one of the leading theological schools in the nation.\n\nMany faculty and students are active in local Methodist churches.\n\nThe university has hosted numerous conferences and events related to religion and faith.\n\nBeyond Religion:\n\nIt’s important to note that Duke’s affiliation with Methodism does not mean that the university is exclusively or primarily focused on religion. Duke is a secular institution that embraces diverse perspectives and encourages open dialogue. The university’s religious heritage simply forms part of its rich and multifaceted identity.\n\nImpact on the Community:\n\nDuke’s connection to Methodism has also had a significant impact on the surrounding community. The university has collaborated with local Methodist organizations on various initiatives, including:\n\nHealthcare outreach programs\n\nSocial service initiatives\n\nEducational programs for children and adolescents\n\nConclusion:\n\nDuke University’s Methodist affiliation is an integral part of its identity, influencing both its academic and social landscape. While the university is nondenominational, its religious heritage continues to shape its mission and values, fostering a diverse and inclusive community that values both intellectual pursuits and spiritual exploration."
