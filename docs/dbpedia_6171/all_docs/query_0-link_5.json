There no longer is an official affiliation, at least that’s what they tell tour guides.</p>\n\n<p>The Divinity School of Duke University is closely affiliated with The United Methodist Church, but anyone may enroll there. The University as a whole maintains a cordial relationship with the Church, with a couple of United Methodist bishops usually serving on the Board of Trustees. The University Chapel is ecumenical in style, with Methodist hymnals in the pews (unmarked as such). The new Dean of the Chapel is coming from the Church of England, though several predecessors have been United Methodist. Many campus ministry groups from a variety of denominations are active. Duke Chapel is one of the most active campus worship centers of its kind in the U.S.</p>\n\n<p>“While the university is proud of its historical affiliation with the Methodist church, Duke is an independent and non-sectarian institution.”</p>\n\n<p>Northwestern, Syracuse, USC and Vanderbilt are also of Methodist heritage. (I just learned)</p>\n\n<p>Brown is baptist. (just threw that in cause it made me laugh for some reason)</p>\n\n<p>hahah…of all the places in the world…brown…baptist. Too funny.</p>\n\n<p>I don’t usually post here…but that brown baptist thing is killin’ me. lmao!!!</p>"
