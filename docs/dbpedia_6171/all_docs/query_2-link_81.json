        "text": "This is a short set of introductory remarks I supplied to set the stage for a panel discussion I moderated at a conference concerning the logic of sanctuary at Duke University, Feb 8–9 2018.\n\nWelcome, and thank you for joining us. We have come together — activists, academics, journalists and interested members of the public — to address the logic of sanctuary, or the ways in which we think, speak and legislate about spaces for peace.\n\nIn our particular moment, it’s revolutionary enough to observe that there was a time when Christian societies felt that the practice of sanctuary made sense, that it was necessary for the maintenance of the life of the Church. We are in the midst of an extraordinary reaction against the very idea of sanctuary — primarily, in our era, for immigrants — and it didn’t begin with the election of President Donald Trump. Understanding the story of how we, as a putatively Christian society, moved from accepting sanctuary as an obvious and logical aspect of our religious and legal codes to viewing it as, if not irrational and antiquated, then unjust by nature, is key, I think, to beginning to revive a role for mercy in public policy. So I’ll begin with a little historical context.\n\nBoth ancient Greeks and Romans provided legally for designated areas where criminals or their persons with reason to fear for their safety could take refuge; these included particular temples, sacred groves, and in the Roman case, certain sites dedicated to the worship of the emperor. So, too, did Mosaic law, which expanded the area of sanctuary in some cases to entire cities. And yet, from its earliest origins, the inviolability of sanctuary has been circumscribed by social realities. In his (perhaps ill-fated) treatise On Clemency, addressed to the Emperor Nero, the stoic philosopher Seneca the Younger observes in passing that “Slaves are allowed to run and take sanctuary at the statue of a god, though the laws allows a slave to be ill-treated to any extent, there are nevertheless some things which the common laws of life forbid us to do to a human being.” Yet sanctuary didn’t mean, for Roman slaves, manumission: at most, masters could be compelled, in cases of extreme cruelty, to sell the slave seeking refuge to another owner.\n\nMedieval Christian canonists relied heavily on the Roman notion of sanctuary when defining and refining their own theory of the same. But they did not consider themselves bound by it. Where Seneca had emphasized sanctuary’s function as a social expression of self-restraint, Christians came to view it as a realization of mercy itself. It was, in the words of the legal scholar R.H. Helmholz, “respected as a manifestation of a ‘law of mercy’ that was not then regarded as contrary to ordinary principles of justice…God himself was both just and merciful; so should human law be.” Parameters for sanctuary were contested and did change over time; canonists debated what sorts of crimes should be exempted from sanctuary, and what sort of compulsion — though never force — could be rightly used by civil authorities attempting to extract a criminal from sanctuary. Church authorities sometimes negotiated reduced or explicitly non-violent sentences for criminals who sought sanctuary and then chose to surrender themselves to the law.\n\nHelmholz has pointed out, and it’s worth, I think, noting, that, during the middle ages, sanctuary wasn’t so much a gap carved out of secular law for religious purposes as a continuing legal dialogue between ecclesial and civil authorities. The liberty imagined for the Church was not the secular, blank liberty of modernity; the refusal of civil authorities to encumber the Church in its mission of mercy was in the service of a premodern view of freedom as the capacity to achieve one’s own excellence, that is, to follow the will of God. This was a much more collaborative affair between church and state than the kind of liberty we imagine now. Thus, civil authorities played a very active role in defining and enforcing the concept of sanctuary when it stood, and were responsible for ending it as the late middle ages gave way to the early modern period.\n\nThe reasons for the conclusion of sanctuary as a common and legally protected practice are too many and too complicated to list here, but it will suffice to say that the extinction of sanctuary accompanied a general shift in thought about laws and their enforcement, and broader shifts in society and the economy.\n\nThere were particular economic pressures that posed a material contradiction to the logic of sanctuary, namely the rise of finance capital. Throughout the fifteenth century, English monarchs had gradually chipped away not only at the specific crimes for which one could seek sanctuary, but at the very idea of sanctuary itself. In England in the year 1697, for instance, a Whiggish parliament passed a law banning sanctuary for debtors, a semi-informal practice that had begun during the late middle ages, as the feudal economy had begun to change. And yet while sanctuary for debtors ended three years shy of the eighteenth century, imprisonment for debtors would continue until the nineteenth century.\n\nPart of the reason for the mismatch were emergent political aspirations related to the rise of liberalism. Ancient and medieval views of sanctuary were premised on the idea of mercy (or clementia, in Seneca’s case), and as the stoic’s lines suggest, the demand for mercy arises from a recognition of the power differential between prosecutor and prosecuted. There are simply limits, if not particularly clearly defined or expressly promulgated ones, to what the powerful can inflict on the weak. Medieval Christians went further than the Romans in terms of enshrining those limits in law, including sanctuary law. But the principle of mercy was still invoked often in the process of sanctuary, as in negotiating reduced or non-violent penalties for criminals in exchange for their confession and release from sacred grounds.\n\nYet as a new political ideal of egalitarianism arose — claiming not strictly that people ought to be equal, but that they simply are—these extensions of mercy began to seem like a denial of accountability, or an unjust exercise of power. A rationalized, uniform system of apprehension, trial, and punishment began to be seen as the obvious antidote to the (newly deemed) arbitrary and inconsistent practice of the medievals. As John Locke wrote: “all private judgement of every particular Member being excluded, the Community comes to be Umpire, by settled standing rules, indifferent, and the same to all parties.” For Locke and other foundational liberal thinkers, ancient practices like sanctuary now principally represented unfairness.\n\nParadoxically, as thinkers like Locke criticized the arbitrary exercise of power on behalf of medieval clergy and civil authorities, European states continued to centralize and expand their own powers. In the whig Thomas Shadwell’s 1688 play The Squire of Alastia, for instance, the author’s surrogate character declares: “Methinks ’tis strange, that places so near the King’s Palace should be no part of his Dominions: ’Tis a shame to the Societies of the Law to countenance such Practices: Should any place be shut against the Kings Writ or Posse Comitatus?”\n\nPut simply, it no longer seemed rational or just that church authorities could interfere with the business of civil authorities; nor did it seem appropriate for the state to provide in its own legal codes for the liberty of the Church. As with many historical institutions overturned by a change in mindset, there was no single, dramatic battle over whether or not to do away with the concept of Sanctuary; once the Enlightenment had suggested it no longer made sense, people seem to have begun to think it must never have. This is mostly where we find ourselves today: looking back on sanctuary as a curious, insensible little relic of our superstitious past, an artifact from a time of torchlight and confusion.\n\nAnd yet, sanctuary has reappeared now and then in unexpected places, even in the United States, even in the darkest of times. This is perhaps partially because the whole business of equality of all persons before the law never really came to pass, which means that while mercy declined in public policy, the necessity for it never did. Accordingly, sanctuary appeared in Abolitionist literature during America’s protracted conflict over human bondage, and again in the 1980s, in the context of Latin American refugees fleeing violence in their home countries. Now again, sanctuary has arisen as a focal point for organizing around protecting immigrants and refugees whose presence in this country is threatened by the current administration. Tonight, we will hear from faith-based organizers and activists who are currently engaged in protecting sanctuary-seekers in just those circumstances on their own sacred grounds.\n\nChristians interested in reviving the tradition of sanctuary have their work cut out for them: States have changed, and so has the Church. The legal status of sanctuary has been drastically reduced, as has its moral status. Liberal societies make liberal subjects. It is hard to pose sanctuary as something that makes intuitive moral sense in our context. Yet as much as we aspire to egalitarianism and indifferent, consistent justice, we know for a fact that our society features neither. We did not trade mercy for justice; we find ourselves both unjust and merciless. The resurrection of sanctuary will therefore have to be a part of a larger process, I think, of reviving a public space for mercy, a common language through which we can proclaim the kindness of Christ, of whom God said: “a bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not snuff out.”"
