        "text": "Navigating the Complexities of Institutional Closure on Christian College Campuses The potential closure of a Christian college is a deeply sensitive and multifaceted issue, one that can evoke a range of emotions and ethical considerations. As colleges face the possibility of shutting its doors, it is crucial to engage in thoughtful and compassionate discussions about the future of the institution, respecting both theological beliefs and the needs of the community. Ethical and Theological Perspective: Christian theology places a profound value on life and community, shaping the ethical considerations regarding institutional closure. It is essential to understand and discuss these teachings as a college navigates this complex decision with integrity. Educational Approach: As an educational institution, colleges have a unique opportunity to integrate discussions about the future of curriculum and community dialogues. Providing a balanced perspective that honors the college mission and legacy while considering practical realities is key to fostering a well-rounded understanding among all stakeholders. Support Systems and Resources: Robust support systems are vital for students, faculty, and staff as they face the possibility of closure. Counseling services, alumni networks, and community workshops can offer the necessary guidance and support during these challenging times. Creating a Compassionate Community: Building an environment of empathy and open dialogue is crucial. By encouraging community engagement, leaders and colleges can ensure that all voices are heard and that individuals grappling with the potential closure feel supported and understood. Legal and Practical Considerations: Understanding the legal and financial landscape surrounding institutional closure is essential. Providing practical advice to navigate these challenges while respecting the values of a Christian community can help in making informed decisions. In conclusion, compassionate conversation and thoughtful consideration of the future are paramount. As colleges navigate this potential transition, a campus community should lead with empathy and understanding, ensuring that its legacy continues in meaningful ways. Call to Action: I invite feedback and experiences from others who have faced similar challenges. Let’s continue the dialogue and collaborate to support our students, faculty, and staff in making informed and compassionate decisions about the future of institutions facing closure. #InstitutionalClosure #ChristianColleges #EthicalDiscussion #CompassionateCommunity #TheologicalPerspectives #HigherEducation #SupportSystems #Leadership Dr. Ron Kraft has been president of two colleges and a university, a successful entrepreneur, and a lay pastor servant leader.

This includes preschools, grammar schools, and other institutions of higher learning. Each abandoned the values prescribed to them through their charters. By definition, charter agreements are non-separable. With each passing generation, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale's Provosts and administrators wore away at their charter agreements. Today, each is little more than a shell of what they one were. The abandonment of Letters Requirements was a first step, the abandonment of letters requirements a second step, the abandonment of ethical codes of conduct a third, the abandonment of athletic requirements a fourth, the abandonment of vocational requirements a fifth, the abandonment of social requirements a sixth, the abandonment of faculty off-campus restrictions a seventh, and allowing for coeducation an eighth. Much the same can be said about the world's four other elite universities. Like Harvard, Princeton, and Yale Oxford, Cambridge, The University of Vienna, and The University of Tokyo have forsaken their ecumenical roots. ---Ezekiel 16:36-39 #faith #freedom #colleges #universities #IvyLeague #Harvard #Princeton #Yale #endtimes #Armageddon #apocalypse https://lnkd.in/gJMkhNSX\n\nGrateful for the opportunity to contribute a small two-part piece online through Christian Scholar's Review about “How Christ Can Animate the First-Year Experience Classroom.” Thanks also to my colleague Kara Alves for her collaboration on this! “If a ‘Christian higher education’ is meant to imply that the academic enterprise is not merely the same thing happening at any other public university, but instead that it is built with a different foundation and embodies a set-apart telos, then students should be introduced to such distinctives early in their course work. What better way to do this than through an FYE course? Teaching students about using a Christian worldview to approach learning, pushing against the two lies they often believe about their identity, helping them see group work as an opportunity to love their neighbor, praying with and for them, and modeling Christian virtues are just a few ideological and practical ways to keep FYE classes distinct.\" Part I – https://lnkd.in/ebx98KY9 Part II – https://lnkd.in/emYnU79j (Also, some colleagues in the ACSD - Association for Christians in Student Development FYE Collaborative may find this helpful, too!)\n\nUniversities seem to be in the news all the time now, but rarely for a positive reason. It seems that many people were unaware of the decisions being made by some of the country's most prestigious schools. Each decision they make or avoid reflects the institution's core values and beliefs. Historically, many universities were founded as faith-based institutions, primarily by Christians aiming to educate future Christian ministry leaders. Examples include prestigious schools like Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Rutgers University. However, the modern landscape of these institutions has significantly changed. While some argue that these universities have evolved into entities with broader, more impactful missions, others believe the straying from their original Christian values comes at a loss. Either way, maintaining an organization's mission and values is extremely hard. If you don't fight daily to keep your values, you won't keep them.\n\n✨Classical education frees the individual to think through their own views, cultivate their own taste, develop their own life plans, and become a unique person!✨ When talking about the function of Classical Christian Education, it is important to note: form follows function. The form of education follows the function of education in the same way it does in architecture. A building’s form naturally follows its function. A hospital looks quite different from a fast-food restaurant. And (until only recently) a church looked very different from a department store and a school looked very different from a prison. Scripture teaches fathers to bring up their children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord (Ephesians 6:4). There is a lot to unpack from this verse, but the two words translated nurture and admonition are words that would be familiar to any Greco-Roman of the 1st century. Nurture is the Greek word, Paideia, which means guidance for responsible living as a free citizen of Rome (previously Athens). The second word, Admonition, is Nouthesia and means counsel about avoiding improper actions. So fathers are to teach their children what they need to know to live as virtuous free citizens and warn them about vices to avoid that will prevent them from flourishing. Additionally, the prepositional phrase “of the Lord” means the instruction and counsel are directed not toward Rome but toward the Lord’s kingdom. So the function of education is to cultivate free human beings who flourish in the kingdom of Christ. It is not to create automatons of the industrialized state. It is not to put more laborers in the marketplace. We are not interested in discipling loyal statists who idolize progress or who are mere consumers of the marketplace. So the function of classical Christian education is to cultivate human beings and therefore prioritizes: •Conversation over performance •Ability to conceptualize an idea and interact wisely over empirical data points meant to reflect performance •Teaching students over teaching a curriculum •Cultivating human beings who live virtuous and noble lives Comment “MORE” to dive even deeper into this subject!🌟"
