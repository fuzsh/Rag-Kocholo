        "text": "Hello,\n\nI am a senior in high school and deciding what colleges I want to apply to. I am considering Duke, but have heard mixed replies about whether Duke is religious or not. What are your opinions on that? Does it dominate the school? As someone not catholic, would I feel uncomfortable going to the school?\n\nI have a family member who went there. Arrived as an 18 year old from a conservative, Christian home and came out a liberal who still attends a Protestant church. No affiliation to religion like Notre Dame if that is what you are thinking.\n\nDuke does not have any religious affiliation. It is a fully secular university.\n\nThere will be a mix of students from many different religions as well as atheists there, so you will be able to find others who share your beliefs as well as to interact with those who do not.\n\nOriginally had religious affiliation (Methodist) as did many of the private colleges but is now not affiliated. It does have a chapel and a highly respected Divinity school. None of this will impact you unless you choose to get involved in religious life."
