In many contexts, such as the ancient Israelites under subjugation in Egypt or under Roman rule in the near East, the two could not be separated. Without faith-based activism, the right to vote, the abolition of slavery, and other rights would not exist in the United States.\n\nThe speakers will be: the Rev. Bruce Puckett, assistant dean of the Chapel, who has been working in Durham and at the Chapel for the last eleven years; Alicia Crosby, a Duke Divinity student as well as a justice educator, activist, and minister whose work addresses the spiritual, systemic, and interpersonal harm people experience; and Ricardo Guillen, the organizing director at Living United for Change in Arizona and a longtime community organizer, activist, and youth empowerment leader in Phoenix, Arizona, working on the front lines of immigrant rights, economic justice, and racial justice.\n\nThe discussion was be moderated by the Chapel's community minister, the Rev. Breana van Velzen.\n\nWatch here a recording of this online conversation.\n\nOnline Study of 'The Christian Imagination'\n\nBeginning August 18, 2020, a group of ministers, community members, and students are gathering online twice a month to discuss the book The Christian Imagination: Theology and the Origins of Race by the Rev.

Anyone may join the group at any point in the semester. To receive a Zoom link to participate in the discussion, register for free. For more information, email the Chapel’s community minister, the Rev. Breana van Velzen.\n\nCalled “a ground-breaking, magisterial account of the potential and failures of Christianity since the colonialist period,” the award-winning book takes up the question, Why has Christianity, a religion premised upon neighborly love, failed in its attempts to heal social divisions? Rev. Dr. Jennings, previously a professor at Duke Divinity School, is a theologian and ordained Baptist minister.\n\nThe online group will use The Christian Imagination as a prompt for discussion about challenging times in our faith and how to learn from one another’s experiences. The group is co-organized by Duke Chapel and DurhamCares, a nonprofit that seeks to foster collaboration, develop leaders, and educate the people of our Durham to care for their neighbors in holistic ways.\n\nWatch a recording of Rev. Dr. Jennings leading a recent racial justice roundtable on Racism: The History of the Problem, which was organized by DurhamCares and Mount Level Missionary Baptist Church in Durham.\n\nA Call for Religious Leaders to Promote Change\n\nWriting in The News & Observer, Chapel Minister Rev. Joshua Lazard says messages from religious leaders must relate to protests against police brutality, anti-blackness, and the evils of capitalism.\n\n“As this nation navigates the next moment, it is abundantly clear that in order to form a more perfect union, we, the people, need our religious institutions to be intact and report for duty,” Rev. Lazard writes. “Religious institutions have the power to do what policy cannot: change the hearts and minds of its citizens.”\n\nRead the op-ed.\n\nStanding for Justice and Against Racism\n\nThe Chapel’s assistant dean, the Rev. Bruce Puckett, offers this message:\n\n\"As a people committed to the all-inclusive love of God, Duke Chapel stands for justice, community, hope, creativity, and compassion, by which we love our neighbors. We lament alongside our black and brown siblings who are beset by racial oppression and violence at this time. We mourn with you, and we mourn our complicity in systemic racism. As those who stand for justice, we stand with all those who seek justice for George Floyd and the many others who have lost their lives as a result of racial injustice.\n\n\"We join our voice with the many who condemn his killing and the injustices regularly faced by communities of color in the United States. As those who stand for justice, we stand with all who are seeking racial justice in cities across the United States. In standing for justice, we stand against all forms of racism and inequity, both in personal and systemic forms. In standing for justice, we stand with the oppressed and marginalized of our society and world. And in standing for justice, we stand for peace, committed to the work of transformation required in our individual and communal lives.\n\n\"As people of faith, we are committed to using our resources for promoting justice, community, hope, creativity, and compassion at Duke, in Durham, and throughout the world. We lament the history of racial injustice, oppression, and violence that persists among and in us. Ultimately, our lament is an act of hope because in lament we pray to the God of justice and truth, who is at work to make all things new.\n\n\"We lament with the families of every victim of violence. Our hearts cry out to God.\n\n\"We call our communities to join in our lament, in word and deed, and to allow the work of transformation to propel us more fully into a world filled with God’s all-inclusive love.\"\n\nRead more about the Chapel Lamenting Injustice and Those Who Have Died.\n\nCommissioning of the 2021–22 PathWays Fellows\n\nIn the Sunday morning worship service on August 15, we will commission four new PathWays Fellows as these recent graduates begin a year of service and living in Christian community in Durham's West End neighborhood.

To promote that kind of learning, Chapel Scholar Lizzy Kramer will teach a half-credit house course in the Fall 2021 semester titled \"A Just Faith\" (HOUSECS 59.28), with support from Chapel Community Minister Rev. Breana van Velzen. In the course, students read academic work, engage with guest speakers, write analytical and reflective essays, and discuss topics such as human sexuality and activism across faith traditions. This class engages with thinkers and practitioners from multiple faith traditions, such as Thich Naht Hahn, Alice Walker, Howard Thurman, Lama Rod Owens, and Shadaab Rahemtulla, who connect their traditions’ theologies with social practice—or in many cases, selfless service and communal liberation. Students will have opportunities to explore and examine their own traditions and cultures around justice topics and movements, learn from one another, and learn from the greater Durham community through local practitioners.\n\nTo learn more contact Rev. Breana van Velzen\n\nHousing Justice Event\n\nThe Chapel and community partners are hosting an online event Saturday, July 31, from 10:00 a.m. to 2:00 p.m. on “Imagining Real Housing Justice Solutions: A Biblical Framework.” The affordable housing crisis in Durham is not unique to the United States. Other cities are addressing their own crsises in a myriad of creative ways, including Pasadena, California, where grassroots organizing from faith communities is key to creative housing solutions that have reduced homelessness by fifty percent.

In a new online series \"Coming Full Circle: Leaning into Justice Together,\" the Chapel is exploring how various faith communities and organizations in Durham are responding to justice issues around mass incarceration, housing inequality, and racism with restorative practices, transformational relationships, and truth telling in love. Each of the events in the series, organized by the Chapel's Community Minister Rev.

We have created a webpage with links, resources, and suggestions which is meant to begin to respond to these questions.\n\nSee the list of resources.\n\nUneven Ground Exhibit Highlights Injustice, Hope in Durham Housing\n\nAn exhibition sponsored by the Chapel and First Presbyterian Church supported efforts for affordable housing and economic justice in Durham.
