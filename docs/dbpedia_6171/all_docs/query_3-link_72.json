        "text": "FFOP, in partnership with the Duke Divinity School and with support from the Muslim World League, has produced a report highlighting the transformational role faith-based philanthropy can play to support the global climate action movement, particularly within Islam, Judaism and Christianity.\n\nThe multi-authored report, titled “Accelerating Climate Finance Through Religious Philanthropy”, includes contributions from several faith leaders and environmental experts who aim to unearth the guiding principles that inspire environmental stewardship and beckon us to forge a path towards a sustainable future for all.\n\nThe anthology, co-edited by Norman Wirzba and Abdullah Antepli from Duke Divinity School, features contributions from experts in the fields of religious studies and faith-based investments, including Dr. Martin Palmer, Founding President of FaithInvest, Bishop Graham Usher, Church of England’s Lead Bishop for the Environment, Dr. Jemilah Mahmood, Former Under Secretary for Partnerships at the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, Peter Harris, Co-founder of A Rocha International, and Reverend Charlotte Bannister Parker, Associate Priest of the University Church of St. Mary the Virgin."
