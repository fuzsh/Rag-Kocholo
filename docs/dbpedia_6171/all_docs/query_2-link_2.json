Religious Life groups, and the students participating in them, may apply for grants from the Chapel to support specific programming or advance the group’s mission and goals.\n\nIn addition to the Religious Life groups listed below, the Chapel sponsors three affiliate groups: the Congregation at Duke Chapel, Center for Christianity and Scholarship, and the Royal School of Church Music in America.\n\nAlongside the Religious Life and affiliate groups, the Chapel's Student Ministries programs provide opportunities for students to hear and respond to God's call for their lives on campus, in Durham, and beyond through study, artistic expression, counsel, service, and community.\n\nReligious Life Groups\n\nActs2 at Duke\n\nAgapé Campus Ministry\n\nBuddhist Meditation Community at Duke\n\nCooperative Baptist Student Fellowship of North Carolina\n\nCru & Bridges International\n\nDuke Asian InterVarsity Christian Fellowship\n\nDuke Baha'i Community\n\nDuke Catholic Center\n\nDuke Lutherans\n\nDuke Orthodox Christian Fellowship (Duke OCF)\n\nEpiscopal Student Fellowship\n\nEvery Nation Campus @ Duke (ENC @ Duke)\n\nHindu Life at Duke\n\nInternational Students, Inc.
