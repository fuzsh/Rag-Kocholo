        "text": "Christian professors at secular universities are called to glorify God through the life of the mind in a unique way. The Faculty Theological Collaborative exists to support you in this calling through advanced theological training, living examples of the integration of faith and scholarship, and rich fellowship with Christian faculty across institutions and disciplines. This three-day workshop is built around a series of dialogues between academic theologians and scholars in the natural sciences, social sciences , and arts and humanities. Between presentations showcasing exemplary theological integration across the disciplines, break-out sessions will invite you to share, brainstorm, or refine practical applications in your own research and teaching.\n\nThis year’s special theme is the doctrine of creation. Knowing God as Creator illuminates all of our work, whether it’s discerning God’s design in the created order, stewarding the creatures he has entrusted to our care, understanding the institutions and technologies humans have created as expressions of our potential as imago dei, or participating in God’s ongoing work in our own creativity.\n\nThe Faculty Theological Collaborative is a joint project of Regent College, a graduate school of theology focused on the education of the laity; the Consortium of Christian Study Centers; and three member study centers, namely, Anselm House at the University of Minnesota, the Center for Christianity and Scholarship at Duke University, and Octet Collaborative at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Faculty associated with any Christian study center or center for Catholic thought are welcome to participate.\n\nMeaning and the Cosmos: Is God in the Story of Everything?\n\nIs the story of everything a story of evolutionary and technological progress toward complexity unguided by any plan? Or is it a story of deliberate creation, catastrophic fall, and divine rescue? Or does it have some other structure, or none at all? Does the cosmos have something to say to us, or do we project meaning onto it with narratives of our own? Join us as Dan Scolnic (Associate Professor of Physics at Duke University) and Kavin Rowe (Professor of New Testament at Duke Divinity School) discuss questions about the cosmos and the Bible from differing perspectives. After their conversation, guests will have an opportunity to discuss these questions with one another over dinner.\n\nSponsor a table (8 seats): $2,000 // Individual Ticket: $250 ($175 is tax deductible)\n\nHosted by the Center for Christianity and Scholarship\n\nMeaning and the Cosmos: Is God in the Story of Everything?\n\nFaith and Physics: Science and Religion in Dialogue\n\nProfessor Daniel Scolnic (Duke University, Physics) studies the expansion of the universe, all the way back to the infinitesimal fraction of a second when it began. Professor Kavin Rowe (Duke Divinity School) claims to know what there was before, and why the cosmos came into existence. At this semester's et Religio Symposium, we'll join them for a conversation about the origin and meaning of the universe.\n\nAre there answers to the questions science simply can't answer? Are scientific and religious accounts in conflict? And what does what we believe about beginnings have to do with how we live here and now? In this evening of dinner and conversation, you'll listen to two professors' answers, then discuss your own with friends and fellow-students. No matter what you believe, you're welcome at the table.\n\nDinner is provided at no cost.\n\nPlease contact Jeff at richard.j.bennett@duke.edu for any questions."
