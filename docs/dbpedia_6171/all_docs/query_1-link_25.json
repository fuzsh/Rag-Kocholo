        "text": "Since being named the head coach of the Duke women’s soccer program on July 9, 2001, Robbie Church has built the Blue Devils into a national powerhouse, making three NCAA College Cup appearances and capturing a pair of ACC regular season championships over his 23 seasons at the helm.\n\nOver his 38-year career, which covers both the men’s and women’s game, Church has amassed a 476-261-80 (.632) record, while going 380-196-77 (.641) in 30 years as a women’s head coach.\n\nOn July 22, 2024, Church announced the 2024 season will be his final year as the head coach for Duke and will retire at the conclusion of the season. Blue Devil associate head coach Kieran Hall will take over as the head coach, while Carla Overbeck will be the associate head coach.\n\nThe Church File Name: Robbie Church Hometown: Greensboro, N.C.

The quartet of Hannah Bebar, Farrah Walters, Mia Oliaro and Ella Hase arrive in Durham after having combined to play in 141 matches with 132 starts, scored 48 goals, added 42 assists and notched 138 points over their careers.\n\nReturning in 2024 for the Blue Devils include leading scorer Kat Rader, goalkeeper Leah Freeman and tri-captains Maggie Graham, Katie Groff and Nicky Chico.\n\nThe 2011 and 2017 ACC Coach of the Year concluded his 23rd season in Durham in 2023 with a 293-147-66 (.644) record and has won 126 matches over the last nine seasons, guiding the Blue Devils to NCAA College Cup appearances in two of those years. Church's unparalleled success at Duke over the last 23 years has included 20 NCAA Championship appearances, advancing 13 times to the Round of 16 and 11 times to the Quarterfinals, while reaching the College Cup on three occasions -- 2011, 2015 and 2017.\n\nIn 2022, Church guided Duke to a 15-5-3 ledger and yet another trip to the NCAA Quarterfinals, while facing the toughest schedule in the nation. The Blue Devils collected a 6-2-2 ACC mark and advanced to the semifinals of the ACC Championship.With the appearance in the NCAA Tournament quarterfinals, it marked the ninth trip since 2011, which is the second-most appearances nationally. Sophomore Michelle Cooper rewrote the Duke record book with her school-record 49 points and 19 goals. She went on to become the first Blue Devil to win the MAC Hermann Trophy, before turning professional and becoming the No. 2 overall selection by the Kansas City Current. Rookie Kat Rader came in and made an immediate impact being named the ACC Freshman of the Year and was one of the top freshmen nationally with 12 goals and 29 points. Overall, three Blue Devils were drafted in the NWSL with Delaney Graham and Sophie Jones going in the fourth round.\n\nChurch led the Blue Devils to their third No. 1 seed in the NCAA Championship in 2021, which resulted in the program's eighth quarterfinal appearance since 2011. Only Florida State (nine) has appeared in the final eight more times in that span. Duke concluded the season with a 16-4-1 record, tied for the fifth-most wins in program history, while accumulating seven victories over ranked opponents. The Blue Devils battled a nationally competitive schedule, with non-conference wins over No. 13 Arkansas, No. 19 Washington and No. 10 Stanford. In ACC play, Duke earned its first win over rival North Carolina since 2015, defeating the No. 2-ranked Tar Heels 1-0 on the road, before later topping No. 1 Florida State at Koskinen Stadium by the same score. Duke finished third in the ACC with a 7-2-1 mark, signifying the 10th time under Church that the Blue Devils finished in the top five of the conference standings.\n\nDuring the 2021 campaign, he helped Michelle Cooper become the fourth ACC Freshman of the Year in program history and the first since 2012. Graduate student Tess Boade and junior Ruthie Jones were each tapped to the All-ACC First Team, alongside Cooper, for the first time in their career.\n\nIn an unprecedented 2020-21 season that will be remembered for teams navigating the COVID-19 pandemic, Church guided Duke to a 12-5-3 record that featured competitive spring matches for the first time in program history. The Blue Devils went 4-2-2 in conference play in the fall, with two wins over a top-five Clemson team. Duke advanced to the semifinals of the conference tournament in November, and three student-athletes -- Sophie Jones (First Team), Delaney Graham (Third) and Taylor Mitchell (Third) -- earned All-ACC honors. After an elongated winter break, the Blue Devils returned to action in early March, and went on to win five of eight games in the spring campaign, including two one-goal victories in the NCAA Championship for yet another spot in the quarterfinal round.\n\nSophie Jones ended the 2020-21 season with a number of individual accolades, including United Soccer Coaches All-America Third Team, TopDrawerSoccer.com Best XI Second Team and All-Atlantic Region First Team honors. After the opening game of the season at Wake Forest in September, Church tapped Ruthie Jones as the starting goalkeeper, and the sophomore from Charlotte, N.C., went on to record 12 clean sheets and a .800 save percentage.\n\nThe 2019 season saw the team post a 9-4-7 record, earning a spot in the NCAA Championship for the fifth straight year. Duke tallied a program record-tying seven ties across the season, including four scoreless draws, which tied for seventh-most in NCAA single-season history.\n\nIn 2018, the Blue Devils accumulated 16 wins, with eight coming in ACC play to finish second in the league, giving Duke a top-three finish for the third consecutive season. The 25 wins Church accumulated in ACC play from 2016-18 mark the best three-year stretch in conference play in program history.\n\nAfter a solid showing in one of the toughest leagues in the nation, the Blue Devils advanced to the NCAA Round of 16 for the eighth-straight time. Individually, Kayla McCoy capped her career with a United Soccer Coaches First Team All-America accolade to go along with a United Soccer Coaches First Team Scholar All-America spot. The Lincolnwood, Ill., native also was named a CoSIDA third-team Academic All-American and landed on TopDrawerSoccer Best XI Third Team. Church’s squad also reeled in five All-ACC honors, with McCoy leading the way with first team laurels for the second-straight season, becoming the 11th player in DWS history to receive the honor multiple times in her career. Fellow senior Taylor Racioppi, who was tabbed a United Soccer Coaches Third Team Scholar All-American, and junior Ella Stevens were named All-ACC Second Team, while Delaney Graham and Sydney Simmons were tabbed to the ACC All-Freshman Team. Graham was also added to TopDrawerSoccer’s Freshman Best XI Second Team.\n\nHeadlining Church’s 18th season was the senior class of McCoy, Racioppi, Chelsea Burns and Kat McDonald. Under Church’s guidance, the group of four finished their careers with 68 victories, establishing them as the winningest class in program history. During that four-year stretch, the squad reached a pair of NCAA College Cups, including a national runner-up finish in 2015, while also making an appearance in the NCAA Round of 16 (2018) and Quarterfinals (2016).\n\nChurch orchestrated one of the greatest seasons in school history a year prior in 2017, highlighted by 13 broken school records and the program’s fourth NCAA College Cup appearance<.>\n\nThe Blue Devils amassed a program-record 23 victories in 2017 and went 10-0-0 in conference play en route to claiming the ACC regular season championship for the third time in history.\n\nDuke’s rewriting of the record book did not stop there, as it also set the school record for shutouts (18), home wins (15), ACC wins (10), ranked victories (9) ACC shutouts (8), and ACC goal differential (+20). Church led Duke to its 23rd NCAA Championship appearance and 14th in the last 15 seasons, while also being awarded the second No. 1 seed in school history, with the other coming in 2011.\n\nIndividually, the Blue Devils produced a school record three United Soccer Coaches All-Americans, as well as a school-best and league-high nine All-ACC stars. Those included ACC Offensive Player of the Year/First Team All-American (Imani Dorsey), Midfielder of the Year/First Team All-American (Rebecca Quinn), and Defender of the Year/Third Team All-American (Schuyler DeBree).\n\nThe standout season also brought a number of honors for Church, who reeled in the second ACC Coach of the Year honor of his career, making him the sixth coach in conference history to earn the award multiple times. Church and his assistants Erwin van Bennekom, Carla Overbeck, and Lane Davis earned United Soccer Coaches National Staff of the Year honors for the first time in program history as well.\n\nDomination for the Blue Devils extended beyond the pitch as well, as they recorded a nation-leading four United Soccer Coaches Scholar All-Americans, led by Dorsey, who was named Duke women’s soccer’s first National Scholar-Athlete of the Year. The season was capped with a school record six selections in the 2018 NWSL College Draft, which ties the NWSL record. Quinn, selected third by Washington, became the highest Blue Devil selected in program history. Quinn and Dorsey, who was taken with the fifth overall pick by Sky Blue FC, gave the Blue Devils a pair of top-five picks for the first time in DWS history.\n\nEven though Church dealt with key injuries to three starters during the 2016 campaign, the Blue Devils advanced to the NCAA Quarterfinals before falling to top-seeded West Virginia on the road, 1-0.\n\nReturning nine starters in 2015 and welcoming in one of the top recruiting classes in the nation, Church could sense it could be a special season. After knocking off fifth-ranked North Carolina in ACC action, Duke went on a run winning six out of the final 10 matches before dropping a 1-0 decision to Penn State in the national championship. Duke totaled a 14-6-5 overall and 4-3-3 league mark and lead the ACC in shutouts with 14.\n\nAfter dealing with the loss of a key senior class and many newcomers on the roster, the Blue Devils struggled in 2014 posting an 8-9-1 overall record and missing the NCAA Championship for the first time since the 2002 campaign. But many of those student-athletes return after gaining great experiences and are motivated to excel in 2015.\n\nDealing with season-ending knee injuries to starters Gilda Doria and Cassie Pecht, the Blue Devils posted a 9-9-6 overall record in 2013 but played their best soccer at the end. Duke advanced to the Elite Eight for a school-record third straight year, before falling to top-seeded Virginia Tech.\n\nIn 2012, Duke notched a 15-6-2 overall record and advanced to the NCAA Elite Eight. The Blue Devils registered a school-record 207 points, school-record 77 assists and were only two goals away from matching the single-season mark of 67.\n\nThe Blue Devils totaled one of the best seasons in Duke history in 2011 with a then-school-record 22 victories along with an ACC regular season title (8-1 record), a then-school-record 16 shutouts, and a trip to the NCAA College Cup. Duke registered a 4-1 win over Wake Forest in the semifinals of the NCAA College Cup before falling 1-0 to Stanford in the national championship match. For his efforts, Church was named the Soccer America National Coach of the Year and ACC Coach of the Year.\n\nIn 2010, Duke advanced to the NCAA Championship Round of 16, following upset victories against California and fifth-ranked Florida. The Blue Devils featured a very young lineup that included its top three scorers being freshmen -- Mollie Pathman, Laura Weinberg, and Kaitlyn Kerr. Duke turned in an 11-8-4 overall mark.\n\nDuke registered an 8-9-4 record during the 2009 campaign and advanced to the NCAA Championship First Round while dealing with numerous injuries all season long. Duke started five freshmen to go along with senior standouts Elisabeth Redmond and KayAnne Gummersall. The two All-ACC selections combined for 14 goals and 16 assists on the year to lead the Blue Devils.\n\nIn 2008, Duke advanced to the NCAA Championship Quarterfinals for the second straight year, while totaling a 15-6-3 overall ledger. Duke scored 54 goals and registered a school record-tying 13 shutouts on the season. In the ACC, Duke finished fifth with a 4-3-3 record.\n\nDuke’s tandem of Elisabeth Redmond and KayAnne Gummersall teamed together to notch 27 goals, which was the most in school history for two players in a single season.\n\nIn 2007, Duke garnered a 10-6-7 overall and 3-3-4 ACC records. The Blue Devils knocked off 21st-ranked South Carolina, 13th-ranked Georgia, and Indiana on the road to advance to the NCAA Championship quarterfinals before falling to 12th-ranked Notre Dame, 3-2, in South Bend, Ind.\n\nFor the second straight season in 2007, Duke registered eight one-goal contests and a total of seven ties but put it all together when it counted in the NCAA Championship. The Blue Devils were ranked as high as 10th nationally during the season. Junior Lorraine Quinn garnered All-America accolades and then went on to help the United States U-23 National Team claim the Nordic Cup title over the summer.\n\nThe 2006 season was one of close matches as well with the Blue Devils registering eight one-goal games and four ties. One of the major highlights was knocking off third-ranked Florida State on senior day with a 3-1 victory and senior Rebecca Moros earning All-America accolades.\n\nIn 2005, the Blue Devils were ranked as high as sixth in the nation and knocked off top-ranked North Carolina on its home field with a 2-1 victory in Chapel Hill. The win was only the second in school history over the Tar Heels. Senior defender Carolyn Ford went on to be selected as the ACC Defensive Player of the Year as Duke registered 11 shutouts.\n\nIn 2004, the Blue Devils collected a 15-8 overall and 5-4 ACC mark. Church led Duke to an NCAA Championship Round of 16 appearance and the five league victories was the most since 1997. For his efforts, Church was named NSCAA/adidas South Region Coach of the Year.\n\nChurch, who replaced former head coach Bill Hempen in 2001, is only the second coach in Duke’s 35-year history. Over the past numerous years, Church has brought in 15 top-10 recruiting classes by Soccerbuzz.com and TopDrawerSoccer.com - second in 2014, fourth in 2016 and 2020, fifth in 2017, 2019 and 2022, sixth in 2015, 2023 and 2024, seventh in 2012, ninth in 2018 and 10th in 2013.\n\nChurch earned his 100th career victory as a women’s head coach against Florida International on Sept. 20, 2002, and collected his 200th career victory (men and women) on Sept. 26, 2003, against Davidson. With a 2-1 win over California in the 2010 NCAA Championship, Church posted his 200th win as a women’s head coach.\n\nIn 2003, he guided the Blue Devils to 14 victories, which equaled the most wins for Duke since 1994, and to the second round of the NCAA Championship. Church did all of this with only three seniors, as 16 of 22 letterwinners were underclassmen. The Blue Devils finished with a 4-3 record in the ACC, which tied for third place, and were ranked as high as sixth nationally.\n\nBefore arriving at Duke, Church compiled a 21-19-1 record in two seasons as head coach at Vanderbilt. He led the Commodores to the Southeastern Conference (SEC) Tournament semifinals in each of his two seasons.\n\nIn 1994, Church became the first head coach at UNC Charlotte, a position he held until 1998. While at Charlotte, he guided the 49ers to a 66-30-10 mark in five seasons, including the school’s first NCAA Championship bid in 1998 and three Conference USA titles.\n\nChurch coached men’s college teams at Lynn University (1990), East Carolina (1982-84), and Belmont Abbey (1985-89), where he also served as associate athletic director. He totaled a 96-65-3 record in eight seasons on the men's side.\n\nChurch began his career as a head coach at East Carolina from 1982-84. In 1984, he was a men’s assistant coach at Duke under John Rennie. After a one-year stint with the Blue Devils, Church accepted the head coach and associate athletic director position at Belmont Abbey.\n\nOver the next five years, he led the Crusaders to a 69-35-1 record, while graduating 90 percent of his players. Included in that stretch were two Carolinas Conference Championships and an NAIA National Tournament appearance in 1989.\n\nChurch moved on to the College of Boca Raton, now Lynn University, in 1990, leading the men’s team to a 17-4-2 mark. In one season, he guided Boca Raton to the District 25 Championship and the NAIA national finals.\n\nThroughout his 38 years as a college head coach, Church has amassed a record of 476-261-80. He was recognized as the Carolinas Conference and NAIA Coach of the Year in 1989, the NSCAA/adidas South Region Coach of the Year in 2004, the Conference USA Coach of the Year in 1997, the Soccer America National Coach of the Year in 2011, the Southeast Region Coach of the Year in 2011 and the ACC Coach of the Year in 2011. Following the 2019 season, Church was inducted into the North Carolina Soccer Hall of Fame.\n\nIn addition, Church was the NAIA South Region Coach of the Year in 1988 and 1989. He was also tabbed the NAIA District 26 Coach of the Year in 1988 and NAIA District 25 Coach of the Year in 1990.\n\nIn 1991, Church left the college ranks to become the head men’s and women’s soccer coach at Charlotte Country Day School. In three seasons at the helm of the men’s program, Church compiled a 40-22-9 record, including a state finals appearance in 1993. The women’s program was equally successful during his two seasons as head coach, tallying a 24-7-3 mark and winning the 1992 state championship.\n\nA four-year starter at Pfeiffer College, Church was his team’s leading scorer and MVP as a senior. He was selected NAIA All-South Region, was an All-Conference performer, and was inducted into the school’s Sports Hall of Fame in 1998. He graduated from Pfeiffer with a bachelor of arts degree in health and physical education in 1981. Church went on to earn his master’s degree in health and physical education from the University of South Carolina in 1985.\n\nChurch and his wife, the former Linda Atkins, have two children, Ashley and Kyle. Ashley is a 2008 graduate of UNC Wilmington and was a four-year letterwinner on the women’s soccer team, Kyle is a 2010 graduate of Charlotte and was a four-year letterwinner on the men’s basketball squad.
