        "text": "January 15, 2009 - Does the First Amendment protect public advocacy from the pulpit? What about prayer at a public, secular event? Is the religious rhetoric often used by political leaders inherently divisive, or can it serve a unifying purpose? Professors Guy-Uriel Charles and H. Jefferson Powell explore the role of religion in public life and the role of religious leaders in politics, from Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Reverends Rick Warren and Jeremiah Wright. Event was part of Duke University's celebration of Martin Luther King Jr. Day."
