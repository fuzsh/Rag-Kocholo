        "text": "Overview\n\nDid you know that Duke University is home to the largest lemur sanctuary in the world? What's more, Tim Cook, Mike Posner, and Ken Jeong all graduated from the school. Long known as one of the country's finest schools, Duke is located in Durham, NC.\n\nThere are currently 6,570 undergraduates at Duke and the schoolâ€™s acceptance rate is 6%. The tuition at Duke is $62,688.\n\nDuke is a United Methodist school. That means that the administration is affiliated with the United Methodist faith. Classes may be designed with religious principles in mind, or some schools may even incorporate prayer into their schedule. Other schools with a religious affiliation may not be as active in their incorporation of the faith. It's a good idea to ask an admissions officer or current student what role faith has at Duke to help you make an educated decision."
