        "text": "<p>Hi! I have some question about Duke in general. I’ve noticed that Duke is affiliated with the United Methodist Church. How important is religion at Duke?? Also, according to PR, the “Town-Gown Relations Are Strained” at Duke… So does it mean that the campus is not very safe? And another question… are most of the students at Duke party/sports people? Sorry… just wondering. =) Thanks in advance for your inputs.</p>\n\n<p>It’s a pretty weak affiliation. The campus is relatively safe though if you go off campus, it gets worse. Use common sense and walk in groups. There are a lot of sports/party people but I wouldn’t say it was the majority.</p>\n\n<p>It is very weak. The capel doesn’t even give Methodist services if I recall correctly. They simply give Christian non-denominational every Sunday. Also they have had same-sex unions and that is against Methodist dogma, which I am familiar with as I am a Methodist.</p>\n\n<p>About the town… Durham is not the greatets place. Go to Chapel Hill. hat is the ideal college town and it is only about 5miles south of Duke.</p>\n\n<p>It is no longer affiliated? Hmm… I thought it was, albeit loosely. </p>\n\n<p>Either way they have a really nice Chapel. It is one of the three biggest in the country. I do believe the other two are West Point and Princeton. In which order I do not know.</p>\n\n<p>I believe the only part of the university that is still affiliated is the Divinity School, where if you go to become a minister you will graduate a Methodist minister. The chapel services are indeed non-denominational. There are lots of student groups representing various religious groups.</p>"
