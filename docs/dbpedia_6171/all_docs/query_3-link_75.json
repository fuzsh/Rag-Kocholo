The MSA plans religious, social, political, and cultural activities to strengthen connections between faith and daily life. Through regular events and programming, the MSA provides outlets for members and nonmembers alike to build valuable relationships and collectively explore and deepen their love for Islam.\n\nThis student-run, SOFC-chartered group includes undergraduate and graduate, local and international Muslims and works to value and empower their varying perspectives, backgrounds, and goals. For these students, the MSA arranges the appropriate facilities, networks, and accomodations to support their spiritual, social, and professional needs.\n\nThe MSA seeks to build community united by a common belief or interest in Islam. Regardless of belief or practice, all are welcome to join and learn more about the faith and the Muslim world!"
