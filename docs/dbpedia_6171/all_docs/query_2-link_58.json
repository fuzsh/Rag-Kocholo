        "text": "Duke Youth Academy\n\nThe Duke Youth Academy is a year-long program for Christian youth that combines a week-long residency at Duke University and a full year of mentorship, practice and engagement with a supportive online community.\n\nA bright color palette, large photos of students, and a modern, flat website design layout went a long way toward reaching their audience. Kompleks Creative also utilized mobile-responsive functionality (kids and their phones, right?) and focused on a three-click, intuitive user flow, to make each user’s time on the website more meaningful.\n\nDuke Divinity: A Foundation for Theological Education\n\nIn an effort to revitalize theological education, Duke Divinity’s AFTE, provides the church with scholarly faculty members trained in the classical Wesleyan tradition.\n\nAlready a well-established foundation, AFTE’s former website undermined the quality of its initiatives and of its prized John Wesley fellows. Thus, the new website needed to both mirror these qualities and position the foundation for the future. Furthermore, it was important to maintain the integrity of the web design even with content updates.\n\nAFTE wanted a website that was both “ignited” and serious in tone, but that did not need to reflect the Duke University brand. Kompleks Creative incorporated clean lines and the use of traditional serifs to reference both the assertive and classical nature of the foundation. The inclusion of photos representing John Wesley fellows and AFTE’s programs not only give a face to the organization, but allows website visitors to feel warmly welcomed.\n\nCatalyst\n\nCatalyst is an online newsletter for United Methodist seminarians, pastors, and other Christian leaders. It is broadly focused on the classical Christian tradition as a context for thinking, serving and living as Wesleyan-Methodist leaders. The main challenge Kompleks Creative faced when redesigning the Catalyst website was information architecture—there was just so much information, and encouraging engagement on the website would largely come down to restructuring that information in a way that made it easier for users to find what they were interested in.\n\nDuke Divinity Leadership Education\n\nThe existing website lacked mobile responsiveness, appeared visually dated and had plenty of outdated content. Kompleks Creative was able to create a more modern, responsive website design that visually connected the program with the Duke Divinity School and Duke University. We also reorganized the information architecture to make it more efficient and intuitive. Since launch, the program had evolved and new user experience (UX) challenges arised. Four years later, they asked us to resolve these challenges by improving the structure and refreshing the design of specific pages.\n\nThriving Congregations\n\nThriving Congregations needed a space that provides a visual representation of their work and connects grantees and with program resources. To do this, we produced a web design featuring clear navigation and appropriate call-to-actions encouraging website visitors to explore the site. The homepage highlights their three main commitments, encouraging visitors to join the broader conversation about the future of American Christianity. Our design allows visitors to enjoy stories, connect with the community and share their own resources related to congregational life and leadership."
