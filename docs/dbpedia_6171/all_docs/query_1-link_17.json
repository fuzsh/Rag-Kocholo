        "text": "Duke Chapel is a vibrant center of ecumenical Christian worship with a long—and living—tradition of faithful preaching and inspiring sacred music.\n\nThis tradition has come to include an active congregation for care and service and a vocational discernment program. In acts of worship beyond the walls of the Chapel, the Chapel community is sent out to pray with its hands and feet by seeking the welfare of Durham in partnership with nonprofits, churches, and neighborhoods, as well as by nurturing relationships across social, cultural, and political division.\n\nLiving Tradition Preaching Resource\n\nDuke University Chapel is home to a long history of faithful preaching. Through the generosity of the Lilly Endowment, sermons preached at Duke Chapel between 1946 and 2002 have been digitized and transcribed. The Duke University Chapel Recordings Digital Collection makes these manuscripts and recordings available to the public. The Living Tradition online preaching resource curates this historical collection in service of the present moment.\n\nLearn more\n\nCongregation at Duke Chapel\n\nThe Congregation at Duke University Chapel is the interdenominational church home for people who consider the Chapel to be their primary place of worship. The Sunday morning service at 11:00 a.m. draws worshipers from all areas of campus as well as from many of our neighboring communities. Recognizing that the Christian life is more than a Sunday morning experience, members of the Congregation long to deepen their relationships with God, with each other, and with their neighbors. Through education, mission, and fellowship the Congregation helps us to strengthen these precious relationships.\n\nLearn more\n\nWeddings and Funerals\n\nThe Chapel provides a pastoral presence on campus and beyond by hosting significant university ceremonies and community gatherings, as well as weddings, funerals, and baptisms. People connected to the Duke community may reserve the Chapel for weddings, funerals, and baptisms; campus groups may request use of the Chapel for other events. Learn more about:\n\nWeddings\n\nFunerals and Memorials\n\nBaptisms\n\nOther Reservation Requests\n\nArchives and Recordings\n\nThrough various media, the Chapel’s worship services and other events are extended to those unable to visit the Chapel in person."
