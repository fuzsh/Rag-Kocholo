        "text": "General\n\nAs a research-oriented, interdisciplinary liberal arts and sciences university located in China, our primary mission is to provide the highest quality undergraduate and graduate education and enable our students to lead purposeful and productive lives. The core of our educational offering is a four-year undergraduate degree program featuring an integrated and multi-disciplinary curriculum, with a strong Chinese, American, and global focus. In a culture of academic excellence and freedom, we prepare students for professional and academic leadership roles across the globe. As a highly selective Sino-U.S. joint-venture university, we promote innovative scholarship in service to society. We embrace the integration of global, national, and local traditions of thought, promoting cross-cultural understanding and cross-border collaborations.\n\nDuke Kunshan is different in several ways. First, we offer an innovative liberal arts curriculum that is at the cutting-edge of knowledge and practice. The curriculum was developed after careful consideration of the key strengths and weaknesses of higher education in China and the U.S. The curriculum is derived from the academic excellence associated with Duke University, which is consistently ranked among the top 10 universities in the U.S., according to U.S. News & World Report.\n\nSecond, Duke Kunshan is a research-oriented university. We take great pride in the fact that our faculty are known for excellence in teaching and research, with special relevance to China, including global health, environment, innovation, and research and development management.\n\nThird, our state-of-the-art campus offers a total student experience second to none. We go the extra mile to ensure that each student has exciting extracurricular “outside the classroom” experiences that complement the innovative learning environment inside the classroom.\n\nFurthermore, we are a tight-knit community of students and faculty who have come from all over the globe to live, study and research together. Close student-faculty relationships are a hallmark of the Duke Kunshan experience.\n\nDuke Kunshan offers students the opportunity to immerse themselves in a highly diverse, internationally oriented learning environment. The advantage of this environment is that our students have ample opportunities to learn from one another and to share and exchange ideas based on their unique backgrounds and cultures. Duke Kunshan students become more deeply grounded in their own history and culture as well as more globally aware – an important prerequisite for career success in the globalized world of the 21st century.\n\nStudents who are in good standing with Duke Kunshan University will have the opportunity to attend Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in either the fall or spring semester of junior year. In addition to spending a semester at Duke in their junior year, students may also choose to study there for one six-week summer term.\n\nWhile at Duke, in addition to a wider range of courses, Duke Kunshan students will also have access to Duke student activities and clubs and to other student services on the Durham campus. Please see the Duke Kunshan University Office of Study Abroad website and the Duke University website for more details. While students will pay the same tuition at Duke that they would have paid at Duke Kunshan, students should keep in mind that housing and other costs are more expensive in Durham. Duke Kunshan students will be responsible for the normal costs of housing, meals, health insurance and other customary fees at Duke during their stay. The Office of Study Abroad will provide students with a detailed cost breakdown for the Duke summer and semester programs.\n\nStudents also have the opportunity to study abroad at locations other than Duke for a regular semester and/or during the summer. Students should consult with their academic advisers and with the Office of Study Abroad. Students are required to have all courses pre-approved through the Office of Study Abroad.\n\nThe city of Kunshan lies in the heart of the Yangtze River Delta region, one of the most developed areas in China. Bordering Shanghai, a large international metropolis, to the east and Suzhou, one of the country’s most renowned cultural and historical cities, to the west, Kunshan is an emerging industrial and commercial city with a history dating back more than 2,000 years. As an important county-level city in the southeastern part of Jiangsu province, Kunshan occupies an area of 359 square miles (931 square kilometers), one-quarter of which is covered by lakes and rivers. Kunshan’s superior natural and urban living environment has attracted people from all over the world to live and work. Widely considered a successful model for China’s social and economic development, Kunshan has won many titles, including the top ranking in Forbes China’s list of best county-level cities in the Chinese mainland for six consecutive years, and the 2010 UN-Habitat Scroll of Honor Award. A number of Fortune 500 companies and other leading enterprises have established operations in Kunshan’s three national-level development zones, two provincial-level development zones, and within its eight townships. Kunshan is located about 60 kilometers west of Shanghai, a 90-minute drive from Shanghai’s downtown and about 50 minutes from Shanghai Hongqiao International Airport. There are more than 100 high-speed trains running between Kunshan and Shanghai every day, with each trip lasting under 20 minutes. A new subway system will be completed in 2021, adding another convenient option for transportation between Kunshan, Shanghai and Suzhou.\n\nInternational students will need to apply for a temporary residence permit within 30 days of entering China. This process takes about one month and costs RMB 800. This permit will allow international students to travel in and out of China freely without further visa requirements. However, some destination countries may require their own visa, and students will need to apply for such visas through the embassies or consulates of the destination country.\n\nInternational students will need to apply for the X2 visa to study in China. Before entering China, international students must apply for a Chinese visa through the Chinese embassy or consulate in their home country. Duke Kunshan has a specific office that can provide personalized services for international students applying for Chinese temporary residence permits and can assist domestic Chinese students in transferring their hukou to Kunshan. Detailed information including procedures and materials for applying for a visa and transferring hukou can be found on the Duke Kunshan website.\n\nYes, you are very welcome to visit the campus.

However, all students at Duke Kunshan are encouraged to attain a high level of Chinese, not only because the university is located in China but also because Chinese is one of the world’s most important global languages. For this reason, students who do not have a strong academic and professional command of Chinese will be assigned to a course appropriate to their Chinese level based on the results of a placement examination process.\n\nDuke Kunshan is a Sino-U.S. partnership established by Duke University, Wuhan University and Kunshan city to create a world-class liberal arts and research university offering a range of academic programs for students from China and throughout the world.

As one of the most prestigious universities in the U.S. and the world, a Duke degree is well recognized all over the world by governments and employers. Duke University is accredited by Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) and is certified by the Chinese Service Center for Scholarly Exchange, the degree certification organization of China’s Ministry of Education. Duke Kunshan University is not accredited by SACSCOC and the accreditation of Duke University does not extend to or include Duke Kunshan University or its students. Further, although Duke University agrees to accept certain course work from Duke Kunshan University to be applied toward an award from Duke University, that course work may not be accepted by other colleges or universities in transfer, even if it appears on a transcript from Duke University. The decision to accept course work in transfer from any institution is made by the institution considering the acceptance of credits or course work.\n\nOur innovative, integrated and interdisciplinary liberal arts curriculum in a residential, personable, all-English, and interactive learning and teaching environment with great research opportunities will prepare our students extremely well for advanced studies in graduate schools. Graduates of our undergraduate degree program are expected to be highly competitive for some of the best graduate programs in the world.\n\nCurriculum\n\nA liberal arts and sciences education relies not on a formula for choosing and combining courses but on a culture of pedagogy that is immersive and dynamic, in which teachers and students work closely together to approach open questions, articulate hypotheses, test out ideas and challenge one another. This approach to education builds critical and problem-solving skills, simultaneously conferring a broad base of knowledge, and fostering the ability to question that knowledge and apply it flexibly.\n\nA liberal arts and sciences education provides students with knowledge and skills that shape their lives, enhance their roles as citizens and increase their competitiveness for jobs. It develops their creativity and leadership and is deeply cross-cultural in its orientation, giving all participants the ongoing experience of learning to see from multiple points of view and to work together across cultural boundaries — a crucial skill for the future.\n\nTo learn more about the curriculum, visit: http://undergrad.dukekunshan.edu.cn/what-to-study/\n\nThe undergraduate degree program features a 21st century curriculum built around liberal arts principles and imbued with the hallmarks of a Duke education blended with Chinese tradition. The program incorporates interdisciplinary approaches, engagement with research questions, problem-based and team-based learning, and opportunities for students to craft individual pathways and deepen their intellectual engagement over time.\n\nAt Duke Kunshan, our liberal arts and sciences education fosters the freedom to explore academic interests while developing a breadth of knowledge and key skills including creativity, independent thinking, teamwork, written and oral communication, and evidence-based reasoning. Our approach combines theoretical and practical knowledge, delivered in small classes and taught in an open, participatory style that offers significant co-curricular and applied learning opportunities, including civic engagement and leadership opportunities.\n\nDuke Kunshan also has a unique focus on producing a significant signature product and an emphasis on character development and rooted globalism. We foster an especially close connection between faculty and students, promote the intermixing of students with different interests, and provide direct access to research opportunities for undergraduates.\n\nOther unique features of the Duke Kunshan undergraduate program include:\n\n• Majors that have interdisciplinary and disciplinary components, with the former serving as the entry point and primary definition of a students’ academic focus, and the latter providing specialized training as well as divisional foundation courses that prepare students for advanced study and signature work that addresses a specific question, problem or issue. The disciplinary component includes independent research, a senior thesis or creative production.\n\n• Common Core courses that focus on big questions and critical challenges.\n\n• Electives that broaden students’ educational experience via distributional requirements and enable them either to develop greater specialized knowledge or to further broaden the scope of their study.\n\n• Experiential opportunities that align the formal curriculum with practical experience, internships and other hands-on offerings.\n\n• Intensive seven-week terms enable students to take two in-depth courses with the flexibility to take some courses in 14-week blocks.\n\n• Fridays are designed for practical work, field trips, internships, co-curricular activities and civic engagement.\n\n• Mini-term courses provide a focused exposure to a single topic while enabling students to move outside of their comfort zone. There are no pre-requisites or grades for these non-credit courses.\n\n• Seminars of fewer than 20 students make for an intensive, mind-on-mind education.\n\nNo. However, each major consists of two important major related studies – an interdisciplinary area of study and a disciplinary area of study. The disciplinary area of study can be understood as a traditional major, while interdisciplinary work allows a student to tie that to other areas of knowledge. Students may also use their signature work to probe more deeply into another area and tie it to their major.\n\nOne of the advantages of a liberal arts education is that it encourages students to explore and discover his or her passion. Therefore, students are not required to declare a major until the second semester of their sophomore year, although students can also declare in the first semester of their sophomore year. Students will receive more information related to major declaration from the Office of Undergraduate Advising in their sophomore year.\n\nStudents can switch majors. However, they are not encouraged to switch too late, as this may make it difficult to meet the degree requirements in four years. Students need to complete their degree requirements within six years.\n\nThe faculty to student ratio is roughly 1:7. Most of Duke Kunshan’s faculty are globally recruited resident faculty members who have been selected by a Duke Faculty search committee. Other faculty members come to teach at Duke Kunshan from Duke University, Wuhan University and other top universities around the world.\n\nCourse instruction will be delivered primarily in small classes taught in an open, participatory style. Although there are some larger classes, the majority of courses will be seminar-style with 20 or fewer students. These seminars are the primary means by which excellence in writing, speaking and listening are nurtured.\n\nTwo of the core courses, China in the World and Critical Global Challenges, will be taught in large classes, appropriate to their function in developing a shared community of learning among students and teachers. Hybrid class designs utilizing flipped classrooms and team-based learning will provide opportunities for students to gain exposure to course content prior to class and provide in-class activities that focus on higher-level cognitive learning.\n\nUndergraduate students have the opportunity to get involved in research with faculty members for credit through independent study research courses. The university’s research centers and institutes, including the Global Health Research Center, the Humanities Research Center and the Data Science Research Center, also sponsor research projects open to undergraduate students. In addition, the signature work project provides students the opportunity to seek creative alignments between curricular pathways and to engage in experiential learning that leads to the creation of knowledge and products for scholarly, private sector and public audiences.Undergraduate students have the opportunity to get involved in research with faculty members for credit through independent study research courses.\n\nThe university’s research centers and institutes, including the Global Health Research Center, the Humanities Research Center and the Data Science Research Center, also sponsor research projects open to undergraduate students.

Students can further develop their academic English skills by taking additional elective EAP courses and/or written and oral communication (WOC) courses. We have a Writing and Language Studio for students who want to learn more about how to build their foreign language skills.\n\nThe general academic calendar is similar to that of Duke University. The fall semester starts in late August and ends in the middle of December. The spring semester starts in early January and ends around May 15.

Advisers aid in the selection of courses, majors, signature work and experiential activities, as well as exploration of career goals. In addition, advisers cultivate learning outside of the classroom by helping students explore their interests and goals while advising on how to navigate academic and social life. Through the advising community, students are connected to a network of faculty and staff who can help them adjust to college and make decisions related to major selection and enhanced academic experiences (e.g. internships, study abroad, research and civic engagement).\n\nDKU offers courses in English and Chinese. Students who have a strong enough command of both English and Chinese that they can readily do academic work in both languages may take independent study courses in a third language through the Writing and Language Studio.\n\nEach year, Duke University accepts a very small number of transfer students. Duke Kunshan students interested in transferring to Duke University should apply in the same way as all others. They receive no special consideration for admission to Duke University. Duke Kunshan does not accept transfer students.\n\nRegardless of background or experience with a particular subject, all students at DKU can succeed. To ensure your success, we provide a variety of student support services that we hope you take advantage of when you arrive. These services, such as the Academic Resource Center, DKU Library and Writing and Language Studio, can help you with a particular course or with your overall academic experience.\n\nAlthough Duke University agrees to accept certain course work from Duke Kunshan to be applied toward a degree from Duke University, that course work might not be accepted by other colleges or universities in transfer, even if it appears on a transcript from Duke University. The decision to accept course work in transfer from any institution is made by the institution considering the acceptance of credits or course work.\n\nThe Duke Kunshan-Duke-NUS Medicine Pathway is an unique opportunity that allows students to pursue their undergraduate studies at Duke Kunshan University before going to embark on their medical training at Duke-NUS Medical School’s Doctor of Medicine (MD) degree program in Singapore. Open only to students who are committed to pursue the Data Science and/or Global Health Biology tracks, this conditional admissions pathway builds on DKU’s existing resources as a hub for high-tech research while preparing students for professional, intellectual, and societal leadership roles.

Since there are staggered dates to sign up for housing based on citizenship grouping, and in an effort to provide equal access to all students, single rooms are assigned to those who complete the Housing Application in the shortest amount of time relative to their sign-up dates.\n\nAll undergraduate students are required to reside on campus.\n\nOn-campus dining is available three meal times a day, seven days a week, but they are periodically closed for major holidays and/or when the university campus is closed.
