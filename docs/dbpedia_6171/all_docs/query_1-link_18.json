        "text": "All across the nation, high school seniors are getting ready to start the grueling college admission process and the U.S. News & World Report college rankings have been released today. And for students looking for a Christian university, here is a list of the best Christian-affiliated schools from the list.\n\n1. Duke University\n\nThe top-rated Christian university and a solid 10th overall in the nation, Duke University has been affiliated with the Methodist Church for over 150 years. Duke’s mission is to provide a “unique and compelling combination of academic achievement, engagement with society, and athletic accomplishment at the highest levels.”\n\nGet Our Latest News for FREE\n\nSubscribe to get daily/weekly email with the top stories (plus special offers!) from The Christian Post. Be the first to know.\n\nIt also has a very strong focus on religion, with many Christian denominations having a presence on campus, including Evangelicals, Baptists, Seventh-Day Adventists, and more. Christian intellectualism is also alive at Duke, with “Religio” magazine, an undergraduate journal of Christian thought.\n\n2. Fordham University\n\nA Roman Catholic-affiliated institution in New York City, Fordham has solid academic credentials as well as the advantage of being located in one of the world’s liveliest and culture-rich cities in the world. Ranked 53rd overall in the national college rankings, Fordham adheres to the Jesuit tradition, which promotes intellectualism with societal ethics in its education foundation. And according to its website, Fordham “fosters the intellectual, moral and religious development of its students and prepares them for leadership in a global society.”\n\n3. Pepperdine University\n\nSun, surf, and God, Pepperdine University is located in beautiful Malibu, California and “expresses its Christian principles through all aspects of academic life and administrative policy,” according to its website. Drawing no separation between the “sacred and the secular,” Pepperdine’s Christian professors are encouraged to pray with students and help them develop spiritually.\n\nAffiliated with The Church of Christ, Pepperdine upholds the New Testament-based traditions and students must attend 14 spiritual events per semester and take at least three Bible courses during their time at the school. And with a 55th overall ranking, Pepperdine also offers a rigorous education to complement its adherence to Christian values.\n\nAn extra benefit of Pepperdine is its international presence. When students tire of the sun and beaches of southern California, Pepperdine has several international campus options, including locations in Switzerland, Germany, Argentina, and more.\n\n4. Baylor University\n\nBaylor University, a Baptist university located in Waco, Texas, is one of the most active Christian universities in the nation. The school offers students missionary and Christian outreach opportunities both locally as well as internationally. Freshmen are also required to take a semester of Chapel, attending worship services every Monday and Wednesday.\n\nPrayer is an important part of the daily life at Baylor, with students and faculty gathering daily for prayer sessions at noon.\n\nBaylor has an excellent academic reputation with a 75th overall ranking and one of the best medical research universities in the nation. It also has an excellent athletic program and is the only private college in the NCAA Division 1 Big 12 Conference.\n\n5. Texas Christian University\n\nEverything is bigger in Texas and Texas Christian University, located in Fort Worth, is the biggest religious university associated with the Disciples of Christ Christian Church, according to the U.S. News rankings.\n\nAside from offering a Christian-inspired education, TCU offers a wide range of academic opportunities, an active fraternity and sorority life, NCAA Division 1 sports teams, and excellent volunteer opportunities with the school’s Center for Community Involvement & Service-Learning.\n\nTCU’s mission is \"to educate individuals to think and act as ethical leaders and responsible citizens in the global community.\"\n\nThe school also has boasts of the most notable alumni of any school: Legendary “The Price is Right” announcer, Rod Roddy."
