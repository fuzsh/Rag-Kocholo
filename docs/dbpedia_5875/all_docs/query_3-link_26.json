        "text": "Michael Connelly, one of the book world’s leading mysterycrime writers, shared the secrets of his success and the evolution of his fictional lead detective, Harry Bosch, at the 2018 Agoura Hills One City One Book program on Nov. 29.\n\nConnelly’s background as a crime reporter for the Los Angeles Times played a pivotal role in his subsequent career as a novelist, which has produced more than 30 books and sold 80 million copies worldwide.\n\nMost of his books involve the crime-solving heroics of Detective Harry Bosch, but his 2005 novel, “The Lincoln Lawyer”—centered on a street lawyer who worked out of his car—was later made into a movie featuring Matthew McConaughey.\n\nConnelly received a Pulitzer Prize nomination for his work in newspaper journalism.\n\nHe told an audience of some 500 people last week at the Agoura High School performing arts education center that a brush with crime—not his crime, but somebody else’s—at the age of 16 influenced his career choice.\n\n“It was a carjacking gone wrong,” said Connelly, who had left his job as a dishwasher in South Florida and was driving in his car when he saw a man running and throwing something into a bush.\n\n“I was curious,” Connelly said, explaining that he turned his car around, went to where the man had been running and “pulled out a gun.”\n\nConnelly worked with cops in an attempt to identify the man, who was believed to be the suspect in a capital murder case. And a crime novelist-in-the-making was born.\n\nJohn Loesing, managing editor of the Acorn Newspapers, moderated the event.\n\nBoots on the ground\n\nAs a journalist for the Ft. Lauderdale Sun Sentinel newspaper covering the south Florida crime scene in the 1980s—and later as a Hollywood crime reporter for the L.A. Times—Connelly used his police connections to hone his craft and establish skills as a future novelist.\n\nThe Harry Bosch books are more than just nitty-gritty details about the dark underbelly of L.A. crime. They are often commentaries about the meaning of life and death itself.\n\n“I hope they say something about our world,” Connelly said. “If you do it right you connect in a bigger way.”\n\nConnelly is famous for his attention to detail: the way a cop handles his eyeglasses or the color of a woman’s lipstick.\n\nThe real life stories of crime on the streets became the foundation for his myriad novels.\n\n“Nothing was lost,” he said. “The story about the man in the trunk (of a car) became a novel.”\n\nHarry Bosch was introduced to the reading public in Connelly’s 1992 Edgar Award-winning book, “The Black Echo,” considered by many to be the gold-standard for modern police crime novels.\n\nThe ins and outs\n\nAs a reporter on deadline, Connelly came face to face with the fact that there can be no such thing as writer’s block—and that the road to successful writing takes discipline.\n\n“I write something every day,” said Connelly, who has written an average of one book a year for the past three decades.\n\nConnelly’s transition from knocking out crime stories for the newspaper to fleshing out plots for his Harry Bosch books didn’t happen overnight. For four years he kept his job as a reporter until his fourth book, “The Last Coyote,” was published in 1995.\n\nMany of his stories are based on real-life cops, crimes and killers. “I want to tell the truth,” he said, while adding, “There’s freedom with fiction.”\n\nThe Kanan connection\n\nIn 1990, Connelly wrote a newspaper account about the unsolved murder of Judy Kanan in 1985. A descendent of the Waring family that helped establish Agoura in the 1860s, the Kanan name was memorialized when the city’s main drag, Kanan Road, was named after the family.\n\nKanan, a strong- willed 68-year-old businesswoman, was shot to death while feeding her Arabian horses at her Woodland Hills ranch. A masked gunman shot her four times and she died in front of her corral.\n\nThe crime remains unsolved, although there has been plenty of speculation about who might have killed Kanan, including one major suspect, her nephew.\n\nConnelly wrote that Kanan was a tough, litigious businesswoman who made her share of enemies.\n\n“‘ After she was killed,’ one Agoura businessman said, ‘You’re going to have half the population of Agoura as suspects,’” Connelly’s article said.\n\nNew character\n\nMitzi Roberts, a longtime Los Angeles Police Department detective, joined Connelly and Loesing on stage to discuss her role in the evolving Bosch saga, which became a television series five years ago on Amazon Prime with actor Titus Welliver in the lead detective role.\n\nRoberts serves as an advisor on the show.\n\nIn 2017 Connelly released “The Late Show,” which introduced fans to a driven young female detective, Renee Ballard, whose character is based on Roberts and the cases she covers for the LAPD Robbery-Homicide Division.\n\nConnelly, who has a practice of consulting working detectives to crosscheck facts in his books, said Roberts impressed him because she spent time working the LAPD’s midnight shift, or “late show.”\n\nDescribing her as “a woman who works in the dark and is not afraid of the dark,” Connelly morphed Roberts into the Ballard character. His latest 2018 release, “Dark Sacred Night,” teams Ballard with the aging and retired, but still effective Harry Bosch.\n\nRoberts was instrumental in the capture of Samuel Little, a notorious serial killer who was charged with the murder of three California women in 2014 and was recently linked to the death of some 90 other victims nationwide."
