        "text": "(* 1956)\n\nBiographical Sketch\n\nMichael Connelly (born Philadelphia, PA, USA, July 21, 1956) is an American author of detective novels and other crime fiction, notably those featuring LAPD Detective Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch and criminal defense attorney Mickey Haller. All of Michael Connelly’s novels occur in the same fictional universe and character crossovers are common; particularly among his novels’ principal characters, Detective Harry Bosch, defense attorney Mickey Haller, crime reporter Jack McEvoy and FBI agents Terry McCaleb and Rachel Walling.\n\nConnelly initially worked as a newspaper crime writer in Southern Florida and in Los Angeles, CA. While working for the Fort Lauderdale News and Sun-Sentinel, in 1986, he and two other reporters spent several months interviewing survivors of the 1985 Delta Flight 191 plane crash, a story which earned Connelly a place as a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize. His experience as a journalist would come to inform his novels featuring crime writer Jack McEvoy, as well as the Los Angeles Times reporters appearing in his novels.\n\nConnelly himself was employed with the Los Angeles Times, too, when he published his first novel, The Black Echo, which won the Mystery Writers of America’s Edgar Award for best first novel. The book is partly based on a true crime and is the first one featuring Connelly’s primary recurring character, Los Angeles Police Department Detective Hieronymus “Harry” Bosch, named after the Dutch painter Hieronymus Bosch, who is known for his paintings full of sin and redemption. Connelly describes his own work as a big canvas with all the characters of his books floating across it as currents on a painting. Sometime they are bound to collide, creating cross currents. Frequently, this is an effect that Connelly himself also creates by bringing back characters from previous books and letting them play a part in books written five or six years after first being introduced. After The Black Echo, Connelly went on to write three more novels about Detective Bosch – The Black Ice (1993), The Concrete Blonde (1994), and The Last Coyote (1995) – before quitting his job as a reporter to write full-time.\n\nIn 1996, Connelly wrote The Poet, his first book not to feature Bosch; the protagonist was reporter Jack McEvoy. In 1997, Connelly returned to Bosch in Trunk Music before writing another book, Blood Work (1998) about a different character, FBI agent Terry McCaleb, an agent with a transplanted heart, in pursuit of his donor’s murderer. The book was made into a film in 2002, directed by Clint Eastwood, who also played McCaleb. (When later asked if he had anything against the changes made to fit the big screen, Connelly said in a 2007 interview, “If you take their money, it’s their turn to tell the story.”) In 2001’s A Darkness More Than Night, Connelly united Bosch and McCaleb to solve a crime together. According to the author, his purpose in bringing McCaleb and Bosch together was to use McCaleb as a tool to look at Bosch from another perspective and keep the character interesting. – McCaleb also features prominently in The Narrows (2004), which operates as a sequel to The Poet, albeit with Bosch and FBI agent Rachel Walling as principal characters instead of Jack McEvoy.\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer (2005) was Connelly’s first legal novel. It featured defense attorney Mickey Haller, who is eventually revealed to be Bosch’s half-brother. The book, which has since been followed by several sequels of its own, was made into a film in 2011 directed by Brad Furman; Matthew McConaughey played Mickey Haller.\n\nConnelly has said that when starting a book, the story is not always clear but he has a hunch where it is going. The books often reference world events, such as the events of September 11, 2001 or the 1991 beating of Rodney King. Events that are of personal interest to Connelly are likewise directly or indiretly included in some of the books, such as a friend’s heart transplant experience, which inspired the writing of Blood Work. Detective Bosch’s life, in particular, usually changes in harmony with Connelly’s own life. While Connelly moved 3,000 miles across the country to Florida in 2001, Bosch, in turn, had some life changing experiences that sent him in a new direction in the book written at this time, City of Bones.\n\nConnelly’s books, which have been translated into 36 languages, have won virtually every major award given to mystery writers, including the Edgar Award, Anthony Award, Macavity Award, Los Angeles Times Best Mystery/Thriller Award, Shamus Award, Nero Wolfe Award, Audies Award, and various international awards. Connelly was the President of the Mystery Writers of America from 2003 to 2004.\n\nRead more about Michael Connelly on Wikipedia.\n\nMajor Awards and Honors\n\nEdgar (Allan Poe) Awards\n\n(Mystery Writers of America)\n\n1993: Best First Novel by an American Author – “The Black Echo”\n\nLos Angeles Times Book Prizes\n\n2006: Best Mystery/Thriller – “Echo Park”\n\nShamus Awards\n\n(PWA – Private Eye Writers of America)\n\n2006: Best P.I.

It was beautiful deception, Bosch thought, as he drove north on the Hollywood Freeway to home. Sunsets did that here. Made you forget it was the smog that made their colors so brilliant, that behind every pretty picture there could be an ugly story.”\n\n“You can’t patch a wounded soul with a Band-Aid.”\n\nThe Last Coyote\n\n“What is jealousy but a reflection of your own failures?”\n\nTrunk Music\n\n“The Strip was still lit by a million neon lights, though the crowds on the sidewalk had greatly decreased by this hour. Still, Bosch was awed by the spectacle of light. In every imaginable color and configuration, it was a megawatt funnel of enticement to greed that burned twenty-four hours a day. Bosch felt the same attraction that all the other grinders felt tug at them. Las Vegas was like one of the hookers on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood. Even happily married men at least glanced their way, if only for a second, just to get an idea what was out there, maybe give them something to think about. Las Vegas was like that. There was a visceral attraction here. The bold promise of money and sex. But the first was a broken promise, a mirage, and the second was fraught with danger, expense, physical and mental risk. It was where the real gambling took place in this town.”\n\n“Bosch had never liked Las Vegas, though he came often on cases. It shared a kinship with Los Angeles; both were places desperate people ran to. Often, when they ran from Los Angeles, they came here. It was the only place left.”\n\n“Hidden Highlands was maybe a little richer but not that different from many of the other small, wealthy and scared enclaves nestled in the hills and valleys around Los Angeles. Walls and gates, guardhouses and private security forces were the secret ingredients of the so-called melting pot of southern California.”\n\nA Darkness More Than Night\n\n“There was polite laughter in the courtroom. Bosch noticed that the attorneys – prosecution and defense – dutifully joined in, a couple of them overdoing it. It had been his experience that while in open court a judge could not possibly tell a joke that the lawyers did not laugh at.”\n\nThe Narrows\n\n“The gravel road widened into a large turnaround where three similar looking and designed brothels sat waiting for customers. They were called Sheila’s Front Porch, Tawny’s High Five Ranch and Miss Delilah’s House of Holies.\n\n“Nice,” Rachel said as we surveyed the scene. “why are these places always named after women – as if women actually own them?”\n\n“You got me. I guess Mister Dave’s House of Holies wouldn’t go over so well with the guys.”\n\nRachel smiled.\n\n“You’re right. I guess it’s a shrewd move. Name a place of female degradation and slavery after a female and it doesn’t sound so bad, does it? It’s packaging.”\n\nThe Lincoln Lawyer\n\n“Well, did he do it?”\n\nShe always asked the irrelevant question. It didn’t matter in terms of the strategy of the case whether the defendant “did it” or not. What mattered was the evidence against him – the proof – and if and how it could be neutralized. My job was to bury the proof, to color the proof a shade of gray. Gray was the color of reasonable doubt.”\n\n“You know what my father said about innocent clients? … He said the scariest client a lawyer will ever have is an innocent client. Because if you fuck up and he goes to prison, it’ll scar you for life … He said there is no in-between with an innocent client. No negotiation, no plea bargain, no middle ground. There’s only one verdict. You have to put an NG up on the scoreboard. There’s no other verdict but not guilty.”\n\nLevin nodded thoughtfully.\n\n“The bottom line was my old man was a damn good lawyer and he didn’t like having innocent clients,” I said. “I’m not sure I do, either.”\n\nThe Brass Verdict\n\n“Los Angeles was the kind of place where everybody was from somewhere else and nobody really droppped anchor. It was a transient place. People drawn by the dream, people running from the nightmare. Twelve million people and all of them ready to make a break for it if necessary. Figuratively, literally, metaphorically – any way you want to look at it – everbody in L.A. keeps a bag packed. Just in case.”\n\n“The bag was a hybrid I had picked up at a store called Suitcase City while I was plotting my comeback. […] It had a logo on it – a mountain ridgeline with the words “Suitcase City” printed across it like the Hollywood sign. Above it, skylights swept the horizon, completing the dream image of desire and hope. I think that logo was the real reason I liked the bag. Because I knew Suitcase City wasn’t a store. It was a place. It was Los Angeles.”\n\nThe Fifth Witness\n\n“Don’t go growing a conscience on me,” I said. “I’ve been down that road. It doesn’t lead you to anything good.”\n\n“You know you’re going to get burned from time to time. It’s just part of the game. So when it happens you have to pick yourself up, dust yourself off and forget about it because they’re about to snap the ball again.”\n\nChasing the Dime\n\n“Money. The ultimate motivation. The ultimate way of keeping score.”\n\nThe Castle\n\n“You know what I did after I wrote my first novel? I shut up and wrote twenty-three more.”\n\nFind more quotes by Michael Connelly on Goodreads.\n\nLinks"
