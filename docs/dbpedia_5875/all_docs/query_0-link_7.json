        "text": "When Ross Macdonald, whose real name was Kenneth Millar, died from Alzheimer’s disease at the far-too-young age of 67, the New York Times credited his Lew Archer series with “lift[ing] the modern detective novel to the level of literature.” Macdonald, a notoriously reserved man whose early books were inspired by his wife Margaret Millar’s success as a mystery writer and his own reverence for Dashiell Hammett and Raymond Chandler, might have demurred, but to anyone who’s followed Archer on a case, the Times’s declaration rings as true as a deathbed confession.\n\nMacdonald’s twin innovations to the hardboiled detective novel—electrifying poetic imagery and deep psychological depth—are the byproducts of a lifetime marked by stunning reversals of fortune. Born in the San Francisco Bay Area, he was raised in Canada after his father abandoned the family when Macdonald was just three years old. By his own estimation, he and his mother moved 50 times before his 16th birthday, cycling between relatives’ homes and rooming houses. But an insurance policy that paid out when his long-lost father died provided a lifeline out of poverty: Macdonald used that money to attend college, where he studied under poet W. H. Auden during a summer course. He later called Auden the “most important single influence” on his life.\n\nAfter serving in WWII, Macdonald earned his PhD in English literature and made his long-awaited return to California, settling in Santa Barbara with his wife and young daughter.\n\nIt was the need to provide for his family—and a friendly rivalry with his wife—that led Macdonald to try his hand at writing a spy thriller, The Dark Tunnel (1944). Long Beach detective turned private investigator Lew Archer (the character was partly named for Sam Spade’s murdered partner, Miles Archer) first appeared in 1949’s The Moving Target, later made into the Paul Newman film Harper. But no sooner had the husband-and-wife mystery team achieved success, than tragedy struck.\n\nRelated: Daughter of Time: A Mystery Lover's Guide to Josephine Tey\n\nIn 1956, Macdonald’s teenage daughter Linda killed a 13-year-old boy and seriously injured two other people in a drunken hit-and-run accident. She survived a suicide attempt and was committed to a mental hospital before she was found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to probation. But her troubles continued. Three years later, she disappeared from her college dorm room and went missing for eight days. Macdonald hired private detectives and appealed through the media for Linda to come home. She was eventually located in Reno, Nevada with an older, married man and brought back safely to Southern California, but the rest of her short life was marred by poor health—she died in her sleep at the age of 31.\n\nLinda’s difficulties devastated her father. In search of relief, he entered psychotherapy—a decision that would have a profound impact on his life as well as the modern detective novel. Beginning with The Doomsters in 1958 and The Galton Case in 1959, Lew Archer evolved to become equal parts therapist and investigator, a personification of his creator’s attempts to understand how family traumas, unless dealt with honestly and compassionately, are passed down from generation to generation in a never-ending cycle of pain and recrimination. Frequently, Archer is called in to investigate the illicit behavior of rebellious young people only to find that far more serious misdeeds lie buried in their parents’ and grandparents’ past. His willingness to look beyond appearances in search of the truth was well-suited to the times—the decade from the late 1950s to late 60s when the Beatnik generation evolved into the counterculture movement—and set him apart from the jaded tough guys who populated most noir mysteries.\n\nMacdonald’s willingness to take the genre into more emotionally complex territory earned him many famous admirers, including Eudora Welty, William Goldman, Warren Zevon, and Michael Connelly, and a place alongside his heroes Chandler and Hammett as one of the handful of noir novelists whose work has been collected by the prestigious Library of America. Whether you’re looking for your first taste of Macdonald’s genius or ready to take a deeper dive into his oeuvre, these 9 essential books are a great place to start."
