        "text": "In Praise of Raymond Chandler\n\nThis is the second in a series of blog posts that discuss novelists I admire and who have influenced my own writing.\n\nThe Legacy of Raymond Chandler\n\nChandler began his writing career at the age of 44 by publishing short stories in the pulp fiction magazine Black Mask. Although not nearly as prolific a writer as Georges Simenon, Chandler left us works such as The Big Sleep, Farewell, My Lovely, and The Long Goodbye that have become classics. He was also a noteworthy screenwriter: he co-authored the screenplay for Double Indemnity, based on the eponymous novel by his fellow pulp fiction writer, James M. Cain, and wrote the original screenplay for The Blue Dahlia. Both screenplays were nominated for Academy Awards.\n\nDashiell Hammett's Sam Spade and Chandler's Philip Marlowe are considered to be the original hard-boiled detectives. They paved the way for Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer, John D. MacDonald's Travis McGee, Robert B. Parker's Spenser, and Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch, among others.\n\nChandler's ability to depict the California setting so that it became a metaphor for both the opulence and decay of modern American society also had a major influence on the works of both Ross Macdonald and Michael Connolly. Macdonald said of Chandler that he wrote \"like a slumming angel and invested the sun-blinded streets of Los Angeles with a romantic presence.\"\n\nInfluence on My Own Writing\n\nChandler once said that a good mystery is one that you would read even if the end was missing. In moving the emphasis away from the denouement and the concern with \"whodunit\", Chandler taught subsequent generations of writers the importance of setting, dialogue, and individual scenes in story-telling. These are also central elements in my own crime fiction novels.\n\nInternet Resources\n\nIf you'd like to [re}discover Chandler--his life and works--the Raymond Chandler website at http://home.comcast.net/~mossrobert/ is a good starting point.\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nPublished on •\n\nIn Praise of Dashiell Hammett\n\nThis is the third in a series of blog posts that discuss novelists I admire and who have influenced my own writing.\n\nThe Legacy of Dashiell Hammett\n\nSamuel Dashiell Hammett is often referred to as the originator of the hard-boiled detective novel. In his early life, Hammett was a prolific writer with more than 80 short stories, many of them serialized in the Black Mask pulp magazine, and five novels. He also wrote a comic strip and radio plays, as well as collaborating on screenplays.\n\nHammett is probably best known for his private eye Sam Spade, portrayed by Humphrey Bogart in the film adaptation of The Maltese Falcon. He also created the Continental Op, who appeared in the novels Red Harvest and The Dain Curse and, like Spade, was a character drawn from Hammett's own experience as an operative with the Pinkerton National Detective Agency. In addition, Hammett wrote The Thin Man with the husband and wife team of Nick and Nora Charles, who were popularized in films of the day by William Powell and Myrna Loy.\n\nHammett is noted for his realism, his crisp, colorful language, and his “lean” story-telling style. He was a major influence on Raymond Chandler, who said of Hammett in The Simple Art of Murder: “He was spare, frugal, hard-boiled, but he did over and over again what only the best writers can ever do at all. He wrote scenes that seemed never to have been written before.\" Subsequent writers of hard-boiled detective series owe a huge debt to Hammett: Chandler's Philip Marlowe and Ross Macdonald's Lew Archer (named after Miles Archer, Spade's deceased partner in The Maltese Falcon) were worthy successors to Sam Spade and the Continental Op. Hammett also influenced such diverse writers as Erle Stanley Gardner in his Bertha Cool and Donald Lam detective series under the pen name A.A. Fair, and Mickey Spillane in his Mike Hammer series.\n\nInfluence on My Own Writing\n\nWhat impresses me most in Hammett's writing, aside from his masterful story-telling, is his central theme: the elusiveness of truth. Think of Sam Spade in The Maltese Falcon, who is lied to and misled, even by his lover, at every turn in his pursuit of the truth. Compare Donaghue and Stainer in The Fregoli Delusion, who must unravel lies to determine if the testimony of an unreliable witness can be believed.\n\n.\n\nInternet Resources\n\nIf you'd like to [re}acquaint yourself with Dashiell Hammett--his life and works--a good starting point is his website at http://www.mikehumbert.com/Dashiell_H....\n\nHappy Reading!\n\nPublished on •"
