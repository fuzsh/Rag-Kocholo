        "text": "(1888-1959)\n\n“Chandler wrote as if pain hurt and life mattered.”\n\n— The New Yorker on The Long Goodbye\n\n“I have romantic notions of drinking gimlets with Raymond Chandler, waiting out the Santa Ana winds together in some dim bar.”\n\n— Megan Abbott, July 24, 2016, The New York Times Book Review\n\nRaymond Chandler was one of the foremost authors (not merely one of the foremost mystery authors) of the 20th century.\n\nWithout him, what we know today as the hard-boiled crime tale might be quite different–probably less literary in aim, if not always in execution. Chandler took the raw, realistic intrigue style that Dashiell Hammett, James M. Cain, and others had begun cooking up in post-World War I America, and gave it an artistic bent, filling his fiction with evocative metaphors and sentences that refuse to shed their cleverness with age (“It was a blonde. A blonde to make a bishop kick a hole in a stained glass window”; “She sat in front of her princess dresser trying to paint the suitcases out from under her eyes.”).\n\nLike Ernest Hemingway, Chandler had an idiosyncratic prose “voice” that is often imitated but rarely duplicated. “He wrote like a slumming angel and invested the sun-blinded streets of Los Angeles with a wonderful gusto and imaginative flair,” opined Ross Macdonald, who was among those influenced by Chandler’s work, and who would go on–in novels such as The Chill (1964) and The Underground Man (1971)–to further elevate crime fiction’s reputation.\n\nAlthough he was born in Chicago on July 23, 1888, Raymond Thornton Chandler moved with his divorced mother, Florence, to England in 1895. After attending preparatory school in London, he studied international law in France and Germany before returning to Britain and embarking on a literary career that produced, early on, mostly book reviews and bad poetry. However, he did manage to publish 27 of his poems, as well as a short story called “The Rose-Leaf Romance,” before returning to the States in 1912.\n\nHe then labored at a variety of jobs (including as a tennis-racket stringer and as a bookkeeper for a creamery in Los Angeles) until 1917, when he enlisted as a private in the Canadian Army and was sent to the French front lines during World War I.\n\nDischarged at Vancouver, Canada, in 1919, he moved back to L.A., and in 1924, wed Pearl Eugenie “Cissy” Pascal. Already twice married and divorced, she was also 18 years older than the future novelist, yet “was a lively, original, intelligent, mature, youthful-looking woman who seemed precisely right for a man of Chandler’s age and experience …,” according to biographer Jerry Speir. By this time, Chandler was on the payroll of a Southern California oil syndicate, just as the oil industry around L.A. was starting to, well, gush. He originally signed on with that syndicate as a bookkeeper, but–despite his distaste for an industry he believed was dominated by corrupt opportunists–eventually rose to the position of vice president.\n\nHowever, as business pressures intensified during the Depression, and Cissy’s health began to fail with age, Chandler commenced drinking heavily and engaging in affairs with office secretaries. In 1932, he was fired from his job with the oil syndicate. To ease the consequent drain on his savings, he turned back to writing, and in 1933 saw his first short story published in Black Mask, the most noteworthy of America’s cheap, mass-market “pulp magazines.” Speir explains:\n\nIt was an 18,000-word story called “Blackmailers Don’t Shoot” and caused the editorial staff to wonder if this unknown man were a genius or crazy. The story was so well polished that not a phrase could be cut, thus the praise for his “genius.” But in his compulsive drive for perfection, [Chandler] had also tried to “justify” the right margin, as printers say. He had tried to make the typed page appear with even margins on both the left and right, like a printed page–thus the concern for his possible “craziness.”\n\nChandler relished mystery writing because it seemed to lack pretension, and the pulps’ restrictions on word length and subject matter compelled him to master the art of storytelling. Never a past master of plotting, Chandler found his own strengths instead in creating emotion through description and dialogue, and in presenting a prose idiom that melded the precision of his prep-school English with the vigor of American vernacular speech.\n\nHis first novel, The Big Sleep (which he wrote in three months), hit bookstores in 1939 and introduced the character who would come to be synonymous with, and long outlive, his creator: wisecracking, chess-playing, late-30s L.A. private eye Philip Marlowe. Marlowe embodied the author’s conception (spelled out in his classic 1944 essay, “The Simple Art of Murder”) of the gumshoe as “a complete man and a common man and yet an unusual man. He must be, to use a rather weathered phrase, a man of honor–by instinct, by inevitability, without thought of it and certainly without saying it. He must be the best man in his world and good enough for any world. I do not care much about his private life; he is neither a eunuch nor a satyr; I think he might seduce a duchess and I am quite sure he would not spoil a virgin; if he is a man of honor in one thing, he is that in all things.”\n\nChandler hadn’t intended to write mysteries for the rest of his life, but that’s exactly what he did. Thank goodness. After The Big Sleep, he penned six more Marlowe adventures, including what are arguably two undeniable classics: Farewell, My Lovely (1940) and The Long Goodbye (1953). He also took a turn in the early ’40s as a Hollywood scriptwriter, adapting James M. Cain’s Double Indemnity (1943) and writing the original screenplay for The Blue Dahlia (1946). Both garnered Oscar nominations for Chandler, and both (and Double Indemnity in particular) are well worth watching.\n\nIn 1954, just a year after The Long Goodbye was published, Cissy died from fibrosis of the lungs, sending her then 66-year-old husband into a “long nightmare” of mourning that left him with severe depression and resulted in at least one suicide attempt. Biographers like Frank McShane (The Life of Raymond Chandler, 1976) have remarked on the mixture in Chandler’s stories of toughness and sentimentality, and how “the emotional sensitivity that made [Chandler’s] literary achievement possible also made him miserable as a human being.”\n\nThat miserableness was much in evidence during the last five years of Chandler’s life. He survived it, in part, through the ministrations of Helga Greene, his London literary agent and friend (and, in the months prior to his death, his fiancée), and went on to compose Playback, which was based on a screenplay he’d written in 1947. That novel reached bookstore shelves just 16 months before he passed away, on March 26, 1959.\n\nWhen Raymond Chandler died, he left behind an unfinished manuscript titled The Poodle Springs Story, which Robert B. Parker (a novelist who shows distinctive Chandlerian influences in his own novels, featuring a Boston P.I. named Spenser) would complete and see published, as simply Poodle Springs, in 1989.\n\nThe author left in his wake, too, a stylistic legacy that has inspired successive generations of detective novelists; without Chandler (along with Hammett and Macdonald) having shown them the way, people such as Parker, Michael Connelly, Timothy Harris, Arthur Lyons, Max Allan Collins, Robert Crais, Walter Mosley, Sara Paretsky, Paco Ignacio Taibo II and Loren D. Estleman might never have found their way into writing crime fiction. The success of movies made from Chandler’s stories (especially Humphrey Bogart’s 1946 The Big Sleep and James Garner’s Marlowe, a 1969 flick based on The Little Sister), as well as radio shows, TV series, and even comic books based on his work makes us forget that he only ever published seven novels and 24 short stories during his lifetime.\n\nThe impact of his legacy has far exceeded the limits of his artistic fabrication. He gave the world an indelible image of mid-20th-century Los Angeles as a city where lawlessness and luxury were old drinking buddies, and trust was a rare commodity–a rather different place from what Chandler himself had encountered during his first, pre-World War I foray to Southern California. (In The Little Sister, he has Marlowe say, “I used to like this town. A long time ago. … [It] was just a big dry sunny place with ugly homes and no style, but goodhearted and peaceful.”) This author also bequeathed us an archetype of the fictional private eye as a tired latter-day knight who, though he has traded his helmet for a fedora, still knows how to rescue a damsel in distress. That archetype has been altered in the decades since Chandler’s demise, but its shadow can still be seen behind many of the crime-novel protagonists working today.\n\nAs McShane put it in his introduction to the wonderful 1988 anthology, Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe: A Centennial Celebration, “Chandler was a real artist. He created a character who has become a part of American folk mythology, and in writing about Los Angeles, he depicted a world of great beauty and seamy corruption–the American reality. He made words dance, and readers continue to respond to his magic.”\n\nSo, let us raise a glass to Raymond Chandler: an unusual man, but one of the best writers in his own world and good enough for any world.\n\nRespectfully submitted by J. Kingston Pierce. An earlier version of this piece appeared on his blog, Limbo.\n\nTHE EVIDENCE\n\n“There was a desert wind blowing that night. It was one of those hot dry Santa Anas that come down through the mountain passes and curl your hair and make your nerves jump and your skin itch. On nights like that every booze party ends in a fight. Meek little wives feel the edge of the carving knife and study their husbands’ necks. Anything can happen. You can even get a full glass of beer at a cocktail lounge.”\n\n— the opening to “Red Wind”\n\nUNDER OATH\n\n“Chandler did not write “funny” in a Donald Westlake-goofy humorous way. But, for me, (his work) consists of one drawing-room comedy scene after another. In The Long Goodbye, not his larkiest book by a long shot, Marlowe comes upon a thug who has just been worked over by a sadistic cop by the name of (I think but am too lazy to look up) McGoon. The thug says, “That McGoon thinks he’s tough.” Marlowe looks at the guy’s bloody and mangled body and says, “You mean he’s not sure?” In The Little Sister, Marlowe finds himself sharing a patio with the head of a movie studio whose only joy in life is watching his dogs urinate in order of their age. Marlowe’s first novel finds him engaged in fast-paced patter with a wealthy and spoiled young woman that ends with the detective telling the family butler, “You ought to wean her. She looks old enough.” In his last, Playback, there are numerous little sequences that yield witty and nasty and, yes, bitter quips. In effect Chandler’s novels seem to me to be the hard-boiled equivalent to Noel Coward’s theater comedies.”\n\n— Dick Lochte\n\n“Because it all starts with Hammett, Hemingway, and this guy.”\n\n— Peter Blauner, on naming The Big Sleep one of his Top Ten Books\n\n“In the old days, I could read anything. But now I cannot read detective stories any more unless they are written by Raymond Chandler.”\n\n— Ernest Hemingway, The New York Herald Tribune Book Review (1950)\n\n“My favourite Chandler quote, or one of them, was about how he didn’t write whodunnits, he wrote ‘who care whodunnits” — meaning it was about the characters and the journey, to him.”\n\n— Ed Brubaker, The Secret Ingredient is Crime\n\n“… some excellent craftsmen — painters, poets, writers, photographers, filmmakers — never find a truly singular voice or show much evidence of a distinctive style. Raymond Chandler had both, and it’s not necessary to read more than a paragraph in one of his novels to recognize it.”\n\n— Richard Russo, The Destiny Thief (2018)\n\n“As a teenager I’d read all of Raymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe stories… and they knocked my socks off. He wrote about Los Angeles and its neon-lit boulevards, its sour, gritty downtown and gun-toting cops (a novelty to this young European) and made them exotic. But what really got under my skin was Marlowe’s voice guiding me around the next street corner, and beyond it into a stale apartment block or a down and low bar. He invited me to look over his shoulder, let me see the highs and the lows, talked me through it and then put me in the seat beside him to drive me home. It was heady stuff, up to the point where the story began to seem incidental to the city, its moods and characters and speech patterns. What really mattered was a time, a place and the people you might run into there. I’d discovered a new kind of mystery writing and got hooked. I wasn’t the only one. Pretty soon it just wasn’t possible to take the Chandler out of anyone’s idea of LA. By now you might have the same thought about Leon and Venice, Lehane and Boston, or Block and New York. And when that happens, you know they’re getting under your skin too.”\n\n— Janet Roger, author of Shamus Dust\n\n“Dashiell Hammett may have shown how mean those streets could be, but Raymond Chandler imagined a man who could go down those streets who was not himself mean.”\n\n— Kevin Burton Smith\n\nNOVELS\n\nThe Big Sleep (1939; Philip Marlowe) | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nFarewell, My Lovely (1940; Philip Marlowe) | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nThe High Window (1942; Philip Marlowe) | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nThe Lady in the Lake (1943; Philip Marlowe) | Buy this book |Kindle it!\n\nThe Little Sister (1949; Philip Marlowe) | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nThe Long Goodbye (1953; Philip Marlowe) | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nPlayback (1958; Philip Marlowe) | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nPoodle Springs (1959/1989; completed by Robert B.

They all became Marlowe stories (or, in a few cases, John Dalmas stories) when they were reprinted, notably in The Simple Art of Murder (1950) collection. In all cases, the original detective is shown in this list.\n\nThe first Marlowe novel, The Big Sleep, uses “The Curtain” and “Killer in the Rain.” Farewell, My Lovely uses “The Man Who Liked Dogs,” “Try the Girl,” and “Mandarin’s Jade.” The Lady in the Lake uses “Bay City Blues,” “The Lady in the Lake” and “No Crime in the Mountains.” Chandler didn’t allow these stories to be collected and printed in his lifetime, but they were posthumously collected in Killer in the Rain (1964).\n\n“Blackmailers Don’t Shoot” (December 1933, Black Mask;

She’s also dead, and he’s the prime suspect. A pretty good flick, despite numerous production snafus, studio squabbles, Chandler being crocked to the gills during most of the writing and a studio-mandated ending that makes little sense. It was a rush job; an effort to get one more film out of Ladd before he went off to war.\n\nTHE BIG SLEEP | Buy this video | Buy this DVD\n\n(1946, Warner Brothers)\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by William Faulkner, Jules Furthman and Leigh Brackett\n\nDirected by Howard Hawks\n\nStarring Humphrey Bogart as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nA great and much beloved film. But it ain’t Chandler’s Marlowe.\n\nTHE LADY IN THE LAKE | Buy the video | Buy the DVD\n\n(1947, MGM)\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nWritten by Steve Fisher\n\nDirected by Robert Montgomery\n\nStarring Robert Montgomery as PHILLIP MARLOWE\n\nDirector and star couldn’t even spell “Philip” correctly, but his idea of filming the entire thing using the subjective camera was what really sank this turkey. Not that the acting was any help. Kiss my lens, baby!\n\nTHE BRASHER DOUBLOON | Buy the DVD\n\n(UK title: The High Window)\n\n(1947, 20th Century Fox)\n\nBased on The High Window by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Dorothy Hannah\n\nAdaptation by Leonard Praskins\n\nDirected by John Brahm\n\nStarring George Montgomery as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nLong considered the redheaded stepchild of Marlowe films, it’s usually dismissed as inconsequential, and certainly stills from the film, depicting George Montgomery as a Marlowe who sports a chessy mustache don’t hold much promise. But the film, only recently made widely available on DVD, while slight, is a pleasant surprise. Some very effective camera work and some great character bits go a long way to making this quickie B-flick an enjoyably satisfying piece of film.\n\nSTRANGERS ON A TRAIN | Buy this video | Buy the DVD\n\n(1951, Warner Brothers)\n\n100 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Patricia Highsmith\n\nAdapted by Whitfield Cook\n\nScreenplay by Raymond Chandler and Czenzi Ormonde\n\nDirected by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nProduced by Alfred Hitchcock\n\nStarring Farley Granger, Ruth Roman, Robert Walker, Leo G. Carroll\n\nBy most accounts, Chandler’s final screenplay for this psychological thriller was completely trashed by director/producer Hitchcock, and never used. Ormonde, though, was forced to share the credit with Chandler, due to studio politics.\n\nMARLOWE | Buy this video | Buy the DVD\n\n(1969, Metrocolor/MGM)\n\nBased on The Little Sister by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Stirling Silliphant\n\nDirected by Paul Bogart\n\nStarring James Garner as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nThis 1969 adaptation is well worth a look, even if Garner is a little stiff, caught somewhere between the hard-boiled dicks of 40s detective films and his future incarnation as easy-going Jim Rockford. Not essential, maybe, and way too groovy for its own good, but fun nonetheless.\n\nTHE LONG GOODBYE | Buy the video | Buy the DVD (1973, United Artists)\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Leigh Brackett\n\nDirected by Robert Altman\n\nStarring Elliot Gould as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nRobert Altman’s quirky, rabble-rousing 1973 revisionist ode to Chandler and Marlowe is either a grievous insult, or a perfect update, depending on where you stand. You hate it, or you love it — that’s all there is to it. Elliot Gould stars, though Leigh (The Big Sleep) Brackett’s script is the real draw here.\n\nAnd the funny thing is that, despite the howls of the alleged “purists,” the film is probably truer to Chandler’s Marlowe than Hawks’ much more celebrated version, which swaps the essential loneliness of the character and the tragedy of crushed ideals of Chandler’s character for a Marlowe who’s more horny fratboy than doomed knight. In Altman’s vision, Marlowe is truly and undeniably part of the nastiness by the finale. No romantic clinches with the babe as the credits roll in this one.\n\nFAREWELL, MY LOVELY | Buy this video | Buy this DVD (1975, EK Corporation/ITC)\n\n95 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by David Zelag Goodman\n\nDirected by Dick Richards\n\nStarring Robert Mitchum as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nA solid flick, except that Mitchum showed up on the set about 30 or so years late. Still, there’s something quite engaging in seeing Marlowe as a tired, aging bruiser plowing his way through a faithfully reproduced 1940s Los Angeles of mean streets and “shine bars.”\n\nTHE BIG SLEEP | Buy this video | Buy this DVD | Watch it now!\n\n(1978, Winkast)\n\n99 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nScreenplay by Michael Winner\n\nDirected by Michael Winner\n\nStarring Robert Mitchum as PHILIP MARLOWE\n\nMitchum again, but even older and more tired, and for some reason transported to London. There’s a solid cast, and in some ways it’s more faithful to the source material than Hawks’ classic (they restore the soliloquy, for example, and Candy Clark reclaims much of the disturbing, off-kilter sexuality of Carmen’s character) but in other ways it’s completely bonkers — Marlowe is an aging ex-pat working in London? Why? it’s at best a curiosity, for die-hard fans only. It also underscores the fact they should have cast Mitchum as Marlowe thirty or so years earlier.\n\nTHE LITTLE SISTER | Watch it on You Tube (2015, Brooklyn Multimedia)\n\nAnimated\n\n103 minutes\n\nBased on the novel by Raymond Chandler\n\nGrafted over the PC game Private Eye (1996, Simon & Schuster Interactive and Byron Preiss Multimedia)\n\nDirected and scripted by Josh Buckland\n\nAn animated gem of a bootleg, using elements of the old PC game Private Eye (which itself borrowed heavily from Chandler’s The Little Sister). Definitely worth investigating.

Phillips zigs and zags all over the place here, throwing in an anecdote here, a little gossip there, and another Cliff’s Notes synopsis over there, but he has some interesting ideas worth checking out. And some of those bits and pieces are just great stuff. Phillips tosses in a preface by Billy Wilder, a prologue, an introduction, and a brief biography of Chandler, but he’s at his best when he relates how Chandler’s screenplays, including Double Indemnity (directed by Billy Wilder) and Strangers on a Train (directed by Alfred Hitchcock), slammed him right up against the Hollywood elite, with whom he had a serious love/hate thing going on. And there’s some truly great behind-the-scenes stuff any movie buff would enjoy, plus a fascinating look at the unpublished Lady of the Lake screenplay, the never actually produced Playback script and an intriguing comparison of the original version of Howard Hawks’ The Big Sleep and the version most of us got to see.\n\nChandler, Raymond,\n\nThe Raymond Chandler Papers: Selected Letters & Non-fiction, 1909-1959 | Buy this book\n\nNew York: Atlantic Monthly Press, 2001.\n\nSelected tidbits by the master, edited by Chandler biographers Frank MacShane and Tom Hiney, expanding on MacShane’s previous Selected Letters of Raymond Chandler.\n\nMoss, Robert F., Raymond Chandler: A Documentary Volume | Buy this book\n\nVolume #253 of the Gale Group’s Dictionary of Literary Biography series, this high-priced chunk of a book will have Chandler freaks and scholars licking their lips: almost 500 pages of hard-to-find letters, reviews, articles, think pieces, essays and excerpts from Cap Shaw, Frank Gruber, Philip Durham, John Houseman, James Sandoe, Paul Bishop and Chandler himself, among others.\n\nOlson, Brian and Bonnie,\n\nTailing Philip Marlowe | Buy this book\n\nBurlwrite LLC, 2003.\n\nA handy-dandy guidebook features three single-day ours of Los Angeles, visiting over forty locations referred to by Raymond Chandler in his novels: Marlowe’s Hollywood, Marlowe’s Downtown, and Marlowe’s Drive. Includes b&w photo illustrations, color maps, local colour and more historical trivia than you can shake a gimlet at. For a new Los Angeleno like myself, or just someone contemplating killing a few days in the City of Angels, this is one righteous read.\n\nMoss, Robert F., editor,\n\nRaymond Chandler: A Literary Reference | Buy this book Carroll & Graf, 2003.\n\nPrivate correspondence, previously uncollected essays (both by and about Chandler) and associated material shed greater light on his triumphs and troubles. Well illustrated, with classic book jackets and photographs.\n\nChandler, Raymond (edited by Marty Asher)\n\nPhilip Marlowe’s Guide to Life | Buy this book New York: Knopf, 2005.\n\nWhat took ’em so long? This is a no-brainer — a pocket-sized collection of the wit and wisdom culled from the greatest series of private eye novels ever, offering the “rude wit,” two-fisted wisecracks and bruised romanticism Marlowe was known for. A tip of the fedora to Marty Asher for finally doing what needed to be done.\n\nFreeman, Judith,\n\nThe Long Embrace | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nPantheon, 2007.\n\nIt’s a shame about Ray, or at least that’s what the author of this alternately trashy and insightful biograghy struggles to imply. Freeman sniffs through the flotsam and jetsam of Chandler’s personal life and particularly his marriage to Cissy, a much older woman. Freeman pawed through his papers and letters, interviewed some of the people who actually knew them, and tracked down over thirty of the California homes and apartments the Chandlers lived in, all in an effort to figure out what made Chandler tick, but the result is inconclusive, alternately intriguing and more than a little annoying. Plus, it doesn’t change one iota of the work Chandler left behind. Or how I feel about it.\n\nAthanasourelis, John Paul,\n\nRaymond Chandler’s Philip Marlowe: The Hard-Boiled Detective Transformed | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nMcFarland, 2011.\n\nBronx English prof holds Marlowe up to the light, and suggests that his “feeling for community and willingness to compromise radically changed the genre’s vigilantism and violence,” and compares Chandler’s work to his contemporaries, and considers his impact on the genre as a whole.\n\nWilliams, Tom,\n\nA Mysterious Something in the Light: The Life of Raymond Chandler | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nChicago, IL: Chicago Review Press, 2013.\n\nAfter The Long Embrace, you’ve got to wonder at this point what’s left to find out or to insinuate — but this compelling study by rookie author Williams digs up all sorts of dirt, from child abuse to alcoholism, and tries to back it up with footnotes, interviews, quotes, letters and articles, that will have Chandler disciples fascinated — and non-fans wondering what the fuss is about. For those unfortunates, just give them a drink and hand them a copy of The Big Sleep.\n\nCooper, Kim,\n\nThe Raymond Chandler Map of Los Angeles | Buy the map\n\nHerb Lester Associates; 2014.\n\nYep, an actual map, spotlighting actual locations taken from Chandler’s works (including the films) and his life, by one of the founders of the Raymond Chandler bus tour. But mostly, it’s just beautifully designed and illustrated.\n\nDay, Barry, editor, and Raymond Chandler,\n\nThe World of Raymond Chandler: In His Own Words | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nNew York, NY: Knopf, 2014.\n\nDay cobbles together the autobiography Chandler never wrote, using excerpts from the man’s letters, essays, interviews and fiction to tell the story. A compelling fascinating look at Chandler, his life and times, and how he saw them. It’s all speculation, in a way, but it’\\’s fascinating nonetheless.\n\nFrederic, James,\n\nRaymond Chandler: The Detections of Totality | Buy this book | Kindle it!\n\nVerso, 2016.\n\nIn this brief volume, culled from numerous essays over the years, one of America’s leading Marxist literary critics takes on Chandler yet again, arguing that his work “reconstructs both the context in which it was written and the social world or totality it projects.” No, seriously. A sharp incisive look that — whether you agree with Frederic’s conclusions or not — is worth reading for its punchy prose style and the author’s big balls thinking.\n\nFuller, Ken,\n\nRaymond Chandler: The Man Behind the Mask | Buy this book| Kindle it!\n\n2020, independently published.\n\nFuller, the author of Dashiell Hammett: Hardboiled Activist, goes for a deep dive into Chandler’s life–his needs, his desires, his politics and yes, his sexuality.
