        "text": "Dorothy B. Hughes (August 10, 1904—May 6, 1993) was an American mystery writer, who also had a career as a critic. Hughes wrote fourteen crime and mystery novels. Hughes was born Dorothy Belle Flanagan in Kansas City, Missouri and attended university in Missouri, New Mexico and New York. She married Levi Allan Hughes in 1932.\n\nIn 1940, she published her first mystery novel, The So Blue Marble. She published eight more mystery novels in the 1940s. She also wrote a history of the University of New Mexico and a critical study of writer Erle Stanley Gardner. In 1951 she received an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America in the category of Outstanding Mystery Criticism, and in 1978 she was given the MWA’s Grand Master award.\n\nHughes acknowledged the influence of such writers as Eric Ambler, Graham Greene, and William Faulkner. Her writing style and suspenseful plots exemplified the hardboiled genre of crime and detective novels, and her literary career associates her with other female crime writers of the 1940s and 1950s, such as Margaret Millar, Vera Caspary, Elisabeth Sanxay Holding, and Olive Higgins Prouty.\n\nHughes was a successful writer and popular during her day. Three of her novels were made into feature films: The Fallen Sparrow (1943), starring John Garfield; In a Lonely Place (1950), directed by Nicholas Ray and starring Humphrey Bogart; and Ride the Pink Horse (1947), directed by and starring Robert Montgomery, which was remade for television in 1964 as The Hanged Man. Hughes made her home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, which she used as the setting of several novels.\n\nAt the peak of her career Hughes stopped writing novels, explaining that her domestic responsibilities made writing difficult: her mother was ill, she was taking care of her grandchildren, and she simply hadn’t the tranquillity required to write. From 1940 to 1979 she reviewed mysteries for the Albuquerque Tribune, Los Angeles Times, New York Herald-Tribune and other newspapers. In 1978 Hughes was named a Grand Master by the Mystery Writers of America. She won her second Edgar Allan Poe award for her critical biography, Erle Stanley Gardner: The Case of the Real Perry Mason. Hughes died on May 6, 1993 in Ashland, Oregon, from complications following a stroke. (Several sources: Wikipedia, Gadetection)\n\nBibliography: The So Blue Marble (1940); The Cross-Eyed Bear (1940); The Bamboo Blonde (1941); The Fallen Sparrow (1942); The Blackbirder (1943); The Delicate Ape (1944); Johnnie (1944); Dread Journey (1945); Ride the Pink Horse (1946); The Scarlet Imperial aka Kiss For A Killer (1946); In A Lonely Place (1947); The Candy Kid (1950); The Davidian Report (1952) aka The Body on the Bench; and The Expendable Man (1963).\n\nThe Origins of American Noir by Megan Abbott\n\nMike Grost on Dorothy B Hughes\n\nForgotten Book – In a Lonely Place by Martin Edwards\n\nAnd Curtis Evans wrote around her figure:\n\n“American Women Mystery Writers” (2004)–Breen challenges the view–taken as Gospel in much feminist mystery criticism–that earlier American women mystery writers “have been ignored or marginalized by mostly masculine historians and scholars.” Counters Breen: “Time and forgetfulness are equal-opportunity erasers.” As someone who has written about “erased” male detective novelists, I would tend to agree with Breen. I also agree with him that there are many “unjustly neglected” writers of both sexes deserving reprinting.\n\nIncidentally, Breen has a good discussion here of Dorothy B. Hughes, about whom, he asserts, there is a modern-day misconception in academia: that she is a pulp writer.\n\nAcademics make the mistake of assuming “pulp” is “a synonym for mass-market paperback,” notes Breen. But “pulp writer simply will not do as a description of Dorothy B. Hughes,” he insists:\n\nHer first book was a volume of poetry from Yale University Press, her novels were written for the hardcover book market from the beginning, she was inspired to fiction-writing by the very un-pulpish Eric Ambler, and she received respectful reviews from distinguished publications throughout her career.\n\n(Facsimile Dust Jacket, Duell, Sloan & Pearce, Inc.
