        "text": "Yes, I discovered Harry Bosch a while ago when I bought Angels Flight and read it in one sitting. I've not been disappointed with the writing, Connelly doesn't appear to have settled into sticking with a winning formula. I'm always amazed by the complexity of the world he has created and the interweaving of his characters.\n\nI read several Tami Hoag books but I felt that the formula was much the same from book to book, the lead character would be female, would sleep with a male character she was antagonistic with who would rescue her from the murderer in the final chapter.\n\nI tried to start with Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta series but I felt the first was too feminist and the solution too trite - it was as if she'd been told to hand it in tomorrow so she quickly came up with the murderer, an incidental character who hadn't featured at all.\n\nI can really recommend the Patrick O'Brian series of books featuring Jack Aubrey and Stephen Maturin. Aubrey is an officer of the Royal Navy whose proudest boast is that Nelson asked him to pass the salt at dinner. Maturin is by turns a ship's surgeon, intelligence agent, spy, jilted lover, contented husband and all these roles are well written. The series follows Aubrey from his first command to his appointment as Admiral and Maturin sails with him. The books are well written, the accounts of naval battles are well researched and O'Brian writes intelligently with an expectation of intelligence on the part of the reader. To be fair his writing isn't perfect; his writing of domestic scenes is weaker than his description of life aboard a man o'war and the women tend to be, as it were, stock parts from central casting; the flighty lover, the proud and silly mother in law, the placid wife are all somewhat unsatisfying compared to the male characters. However as the majority of the books are set onboard these \"deficiencies\" don't really detract from the story.\n\nI am, as you may have gathered, quite enthusiastic about the Aubrey books!\n\nThese are great suggestions. I am a big Michael Connelly fan and a big Harry Bosch fan. For one thing, I think Connelly's prose is superb.\n\nI would try to read the Harry Bosch books in the order they were written, though!\n\nI thought Patricia Cornwell's first books were excellent, but that was a lot of books ago!\n\nI love Rebus as a character and Ian Rankin does a great job of \"laying him\" out in all of his complexity and stays very consistent, etc. The setting of Edinburgh is great and Rankin does well with it. And the stories are nicely original and well-plotted. At least some of Rankin's books seem really slow reading though, and I have had trouble keeping certain characters straight. Sometimes that comes from my skimming over parts of books that just seem too lengthy and drawn out.\n\nAn utterly guilty pleasure of mine for some reason is the Jack Reacher series by Lee Child. I can think of every criticism that can be made of these books but they suck me right in every time and satisfy me anyway. I think a couple of the books around say the 2d, 3d, and 4th ones really did badly when they got into more romantic intimate scenes, but thankful Child has stuck to action for the most part since then! Another series to read in order though!\n\nI need to check out these other authors for sure. Robert Crais has had some good and some not so good books, methinks.\n\nAlso, I thought the first Andrew Vachss Burke series was great and got better and better up to say the 6th one. Then it came back to good form in the last couple of Burke books. Burke is a character, like Harry Bosche, etched into my mine. And when Vachss is really on his game, his prose is wonderful. So sparse and rippling with meaning.\n\nI enjoy the Harry Bosch novels quite a bit. I usually pick one up before a trip and read it while hanging out in airports.\n\nI have to admit, however, that I am often disappointed in the endings. I don't want to post any spoilers here, so I'll just say that, although the endings tend to be excitingly paced, I also often find them contrived, cliched, implausible, or just plain silly. I really enjoy the LA insider perspective, though, and I like Connelly's style. In spite of feeling somewhat sucker-punched at the end of too many of Connelly's books, I keep going back. . . .\n\njbird\n\nInteresting. Could you name some of the Connelly books that you felt that way about. I do not think that gives away any spoilers and would help me think about the issues you raise. I'm not saying you are not correct. I just want to think about it harder! I think this is a problem with lots of mystery books. The story, characters, pacing, etc. is great, until one gets to the end. How many times have you finished a book and thought--\"the author really could not figure out an ending all along! Happens all the time in movies and TV series, too. See The Sopranos, Lost.\n\nI've been reading Lush Life by Richard Price while trying to find the next Bosch book. It's sort of a contradiction--his writing may be some of the best I've read, but at the same time the grit and realism translate into it being somewhat cold. I don't know if I'm attached to any of the characters, and that's what usually what hooks me.\n\nAs far as guilty pleasures, sign me up. Monster movies, old fight tapes and cookies with coffee for breakfast: all bad for me, but every now and then, just what you needed.\n\nI have not read that much Richard Price--I suppose Clockers--but I would say I know what you mean, except I do not know that the writing it all that great so much as it is clear. I think part of the problem may be that he is really a screenwriter not a novelist. He writes in a way that would play out nicely in a film or on TV, but does not have the character development and intensity of good fiction writing. It is sort of visual and as you say \"cold.\"\n\nI think part of the problem may be that he is really a screenwriter not a novelist. He writes in a way that would play out nicely in a film or on TV, but does not have the character development and intensity of good fiction writing. It is sort of visual and as you say \"cold.\"\n\nThat's a good point. I'm wondering if part of it is even more juvenile though--even when a protagonist makes 100 choices I wouldn't make, even if I can't relate to their life, as a reader I still want to identify with them, and that's a lot easier if I like them.\n\nRight now, I think Price is incredibly talented, but I don't know of one character I really like or \"am rooting for,\" so I'm still kind of detached and not always sure if I'm having a good time.\n\nI guess describing reading as a blind date isn't the most intellectual comment I've ever made...but sometimes it's just nice to escape for a while.\n\n(he says, looking up Lee Childs...)\n\nI guess describing reading as a blind date isn't the most intellectual comment I've ever made...but sometimes it's just nice to escape for a while.\n\n(he says, looking up Lee Childs...)\n\nMaybe I'll sound off with a different viewpoint on Lee Childs. I read the first novel in the Reacher series and I found the set-up for the character so preposterous and unbelievable that I had to struggle to finish the novel (Childs' prose doesn't help either). I think that there's a genre of mystery writing that features guys like Reacher, but usually they grew up in the mountains of Japan and were trained by Ninjas or they had a career in Black Ops before becoming whatever it is that they are in the novel (sometimes both). If you buy off on that premise, then you aren't surprised when the hero kills three attackers with a drinking straw or can slow his heartbeat and respiration to survive thirty minutes trapped in the trunk of a car at the bottom of a lake. It's like that Steven Seagal movie \"Under Seige.\" Everybody wonders how one cook could cause so much damage until they find out that he used to be a SEAL. With Reacher, I didn't buy that a guy with his background could be so good at everything (this was also why I find JAG and NCIS unwatchable--sorry Navy lawyers). My point isn't that it's too unrealistic, but that it violates the rules of unrealistic fiction.\n\nBut, Chris, are you going to tell us how you liked the Reacher book or not??\n\nI said that Lee Childs' books were a guilty pleasure of mine, and I could not have put it any better than you why they are a \"guilty\" pleasure. Although I will add another point to your criticism, which I really noticed in the latest book, which is that the level of violence is stunning, and Reacher seems to kill massive numbers of people without the slightest bit of remorse or reflection. I guess contra to your criticism and I do not think there is a spoiler alert needed here, Reacher does show more vulnerability to getting injured in the last few books of the series.\n\nIt is pretty much escapist, Superman to the rescue, stuff, that I am embarassed to read in a big way and I have no idea why I like reading the books, because I do not even like Reacher very much.\n\nI suppose Reacher has one major redeeming characteristic. I think I mentioned that Childs seemed terrible in writing sexual scenes. But Reacher actually is quite respectful of woman and quite human in the relationships with women that he gets into. Very non-exploitive. The way he is written about he would have woman all over him, and for good reason, if the things he did were plausible, but he does not go around James Bond like screwing every woman in sight, and he really is quite thoughtful when it comes to women.\n\nAlso, I suppose the discussion of technical of military/weapons/tactics, mechanical things, etc. is pretty interesting, although and I very far, for instance, from a gun fan.\n\nAlso, even though the stories arguably have become even more formulistic over time, I think Childs' prose has gotten better. He has a nice compact, easy to read style. And there are not plot holes or contradictons or anything like that. He is far from Connelly in quality of prose and surely does not match Vachss when Vachss is really hitting on all cylinders, which is not always doing!\n\nSo you are absolutely correct, but I still am kind of hooked on the books. Maybe with this last one not as hooked!\n\nMaybe I'll sound off with a different viewpoint on Lee Childs. I read the first novel in the Reacher series and I found the set-up for the character so preposterous and unbelievable that I had to struggle to finish the novel (Childs' prose doesn't help either).
