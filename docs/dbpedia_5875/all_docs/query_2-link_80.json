        "text": "Fictional Biography is a genre wherein an author writes an account of a person's life where that person is actually a fictional character (or leastways, is generally thought to be). An example would be the satirical Augustus Carp, Esq., By Himself: Being the Autobiography of a Really Good Man, published anonymously in 1924 (later confirmed to have been written by Sir Henry Howarth Bashford). In Wold Newton circles, however, the general assumption is that the book will have been written about a pre-existing figure.\n\nThe genre is rather a wide one. At one end there will be books that are essentially critical studies of a character, or perhaps examples of \"The Game\", the scholarly-yet-creative research into the life and career of Sherlock Holmes. While such books are biographical, it would be difficult to actually describe them as fully-fledged biographies. At the other end of the scale can be found novels that have simply been presented in an unusual way, where the style of the biography largely gives way to narrative. Somewhere in the middle are straight biographies, where the authors have used the source texts as though they were historical documents, and in many of these cases the authors have taken the explicit position that they are writing about real people.\n\nWold Newton scholarship directly derives from two fictional biographies by Philip José Farmer, Tarzan Alive and Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life. There have, however, been many others, both before and after Farmer, at various points in the scale. The list below is based upon the information supplied on Win Scott Eckert's The Wold Newton Universe website, which listing he expanded in his book Crossovers. Further examples have been added directly to this article.\n\n'Sir John Falstaff a Notorious Highwayman' in A Complete History of the Lives and Robberies of the Most Notorious Highwaymen by Alexander Smith (1719)\n\nThe pseudonymous Alexander Smith presents the lives and robberies of those notorious highwaymen for supposed 'moral' purpose, and in the expanded 1719 edition includes amongst them a villainous Robin Hood (and a Falstaff whose criminal career is shown to extent past the incident portrayed by William Shakespeare in Henry IV Part One.\n\n'The Life of Sir John Falstaff in A General and True History of the Lives and Actions of the Most Famous Highwaymen, Murderers, Street-Robbers, etc. to which is added A Genuine Account of the Voyages and Plunders of the most noted Pirates by Captain Charles Johnson (1742)\n\nAn expansion of Captain Johnson's 1724 A General History of the Robberies and Murders of the most notorious Pyrates using material from Smith's volume on highwaymen. \"Captain Johnson\" is likewise believed to be an alias, and the theory that the true author of the original book was Daniel Defoe persists. To add verisimilitude, Falstaff is mentioned in other sections of the book as well; indeed, it is clearly from the reference to him in the introduction that his inclusion was a selling-point.\n\nThe Life of Sir John Falstaff by Robert Barnabas Brough (1858)\n\nThis volume is, to date, the earliest identified full-length fictional biography published (further evidence for the popularity of this figure from Shakespeare may be found in the volume of his letters published by James White in 1796, and A.M.F. Randolph's 1893 account of his trial before Justice Shallow).\n\n\"Biographical Note\" by Paul Austin Delagardie, in Unnatural Death by Dorothy L. Sayers (1927)\n\nA brief, and amusingly self-serving, biography of Lord Peter Wimsey, written by his uncle at the request of Dorothy L. Sayers.\n\nSleuths: 23 Great Detectives of Fiction & Their Best Stories ed. Kenneth MacGowan (1931)\n\nSleuths was a collection of short stories about fictional detectives by various hands, but with the gimmick that each piece came with a Who's Who-style mini-biography of each detective by either the author or editor.\n\nC. Auguste Dupin (Unattributed)\n\nSherlock Holmes (Kenneth Macgowan; a longer version of this piece appeared later as the frontispiece to Ellery Queen's notorious anthology The Misadventures of Sherlock Holmes).\n\nMartin Hewitt (Arthur Morrison)\n\nEugene Valmont (Kenneth Macgowan)\n\nProfessor Augustus S.F.X. Van Dusen (Kenneth Macgowan)\n\nCraig Kennedy (Arthur B Reeve)\n\nDr. John Thorndyke (R. Austin Freeman)\n\nAstrogon Kerby (Gelett Burgess)\n\nPhilip Trent (E.C. Bentley)\n\nMax Carrodos (Ernest Bramah)\n\nWilliam Dawson (Kenneth Macgowan)\n\nReggie Fortune (H.C. Bailey)\n\nHercule Poirot and Capt. Arthur Hastings (both Kenneth Macgowan)\n\nJim Hanvey (Octavus Roy Cohen)\n\nSupt. Henry Wilson (G.D.H. & M. Cole)\n\nLord Peter Wimsey (Dorothy L. Sayers)\n\nDr. Eustace Hailey (Kenneth Macgowan)\n\nMr. J.G. Reeder (Kenneth Macgowan)\n\nDetective John Duff (Kenneth Macgowan)\n\nHenry Poggiloli (T.S. Stribling)\n\nInstead of biographies, for The Old Man in the Corner, Uncle Abner and Father Brown. there are unattributed apologia for the scarcity of information.\n\nThe Gay Adventurer aka The Life and Exploits of the Scarlet Pimpernel by John Blakeney (1935)\n\nPublished while the Baroness Orczy was still writing stories about Sir Percy Blakeney and his descendents, and not always consistent with them. It is generally assumed that “John Blakeney” was actually her son John Orczy Barstow. The book is available online here.\n\n\"A Probable Outline of Conan's Career\" by P. Schuyler Miller and John D. Clark (1938), variously revised under other titles by L. Sprague de Camp (1952 onwards)\n\nThe original article is online here.\n\nYankee Lawyer: The Autobiography of Ephraim Tutt, ed. Arthur Train (1943)\n\nA popular entry in Train's long-running series of stories, in which he passes the baton to Tutt himself in order to tell the story of his life (and, in doing so, point out where Train has misrepresented him in print in the past). Readers were left somewhat confused as to whether Tutt was a fictional character, or whether he had been real all along....\n\nFour-&-Twenty Bloodhounds by Anthony Boucher (1950)\n\nVerne Chute's Shadrack Arnold\n\nJoseph Commings's Senator Brooks U. Banner\n\nW.T Brannon's Jim Burgess\n\nJohn Dickson Carr's Dr. Gideon Fell\n\nKen Crssen's Mortimer Death\n\nMatthew Head's Dr. Mary Finney\n\nDr. Sam: Johnson, as chronicled by Lillian de la Torre\n\nHarold Q. Masur's Scott Jordan\n\nFrank Kane's Johnny Liddell\n\nJerome & Harold Prince's Inspector Magruder\n\nJames M. Fox's John and Suzy Marshall\n\nMerlini, as chronicled by \"Clayton Rawson\" (pen-name for The Great Merlini and Ross Harte)\n\nD.B. Olsen's Miss Rachel Murdock\n\nThe Mysterious Traveller, as chronicled by Robert Arthur\n\nAnthony Boucher's Nick Noble\n\nLawrence G. Blochman's O'Reilly Sahib\n\nStewart Sterling's Ben Pedley\n\nAugust Derleth's Solar Pons\n\nEllery Queen\n\nBrett Halliday's Michael Shayne\n\nFrederick Brown's Henry Smith\n\nGeorge Harmon Coxe's Dr. Paul Standish\n\nQ. Patrick's Lt. Timothy Trant\n\nKelley Roos's Jeff and Haila Troy\n\nStuart Palmer's Hildegarde Withers\n\nExplicitly-modelled on Sleuths, Boucher composed (allegedly drawing his information from question sheets completed by the detectives themselves) similar Who's Who-style entries for each work in his anthology of detective fiction - with three exceptions. Ellery Queen refused to supply any information, sending Boucher a facetious letter instead, which is reprinted complete with signature; The Mysterious Traveller is said to have supplied biographical information so disturbing that it could not be published, with Boucher announcing that he had had to send a copy to Miskatonic University instead (one wonders how many readers in 1950 recognised the joke here); Brett Halliday supplied no further information beyond his Michael Shayne story which recounts how the two men got to know each other.\n\nMaigret’s Memoirs, ed. Georges Simenon (1950)\n\nMuch like Train before him, Maigret has a go at his chronicler and insists on writing the story of his life himself. Simenon later allowed Julian Symons to write an associated pastiche, “About Maigret and the Stolen Papers”, in his Great Detectives (see below).\n\nColonel Chinstrap, ed. Ted Kavanagh (1952)\n\nThe autobiography of Colonel Humphrey Chinstrap, the dipsomaniac army officer from I.T.M.A., the BBC radio series that got the British through World War Two.\n\nSherlock Holmes of Baker Street by William S. Baring-Gould (1962)\n\nArguably the culmination of all Sherlockian speculation - although by no means the last - Baring-Gould draws together much work by himself and other hands to tell the story of the Great Detective's family, career, and retirement. The book is notable for popularising the idea that Nero Wolfe was Sherlock Holmes's son. Elements from the Professor Challenger stories, and from three notable pastiches, are also included.\n\nI, Flook: An autobiography with drawings by Trog, ed. George Melly and Wally Fawkes (1962)\n\n\"Flook\" was a comic strip that ran in British newspapers from 1949 till at least the mid-1980s, drawn by Trog (Wally Fawkes) and written by a succession of well-known names. Originally for children, it quickly developed in surreal and satirical ways for an older audience. In his slim illustrated prose autobiography, Flook - some sort of magical prehistoric-creature-about-town - gives an account of his life as ostensible pet to a young boy whom he notices hasn't aged since the strip started...\n\nNero Wolfe of West Thirty-Fifth Street by William S. Baring-Gould (1969)\n\nWhereas Sherlock Holmes of Baker Street was a straight biography of the late Sherlock Holmes, Nero Wolfe of West 35th Street is more a collection of essays about the still-living New York detective, each one dealing with a different aspect of Wolfe's career, life, and circle.\n\nThe Life and Times of Horatio Hornblower by C. Northcote Parkinson (1970)\n\nAlthough books in a similar vein had been written before, the idea behind The Life and Times of Horatio Hornblower seems to have been a new one to its readers. Parkinson took the character of Horatio Hornblower, the protagonist of the historical novels by C.S. Forester, and wrote such a straight biography that some reviewers missed the point and thought Hornblower had actually existed. Rumours exist of a similar tome by one \"C. Windgate\".\n\nAn Informal Biography of Scrooge McDuck by Jack L. Chalker, with a Bibliography by Kim Weston (1971, 1974)\n\nThis essay was originally published in Markings magazine in 1971, then in an expanded standalone pamphlet in 1974. It is placed firmly in the tradition of the Sherlockian 'Game', noting that the book's 'form is an established literary genre in and of itself'. McDuck's life is taken from the comics by Carl Barks, who is elsewhere recorded as having said that he considered Disney's anthropomorphic animal cartoon characters as being, essentially, portraits of human beings in caricature.\n\nTarzan Alive by Philip José Farmer (1972)\n\nSee main article Tarzan Alive.\n\n\"The Obscure Life and Hard Times of Kilgore Trout\" by Philip José Farmer (1973)\n\nDoc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life by Philip José Farmer (1973)\n\nSee main article Doc Savage: His Apocalyptic Life.\n\nJames Bond: The Authorised Biography of 007 by John Pearson (1973)\n\nJohn Pearson was a colleague of Ian Fleming and wrote his biography. James Bond: The Authorised Biography reveals that Pearson started to get peculiar correspondence once his Fleming book was out, which lead him to discover that James Bond is not fictional at all. It is interesting to note that before Fleming's literary estate took an interest, Pearson anticipated that the book would have to be a parody in order to reach print. It is interesting to note that Pearson's book was published around the same time as Farmer's, as the latter also includes - consistent - information about James Bond's ancestry.\n\nAmerica's Secret Service Ace by Nick Carr (1974)\n\nAbout Operator #5.\n\n\"Edgar Rice Burroughs: A Brief Biographical Sketch\" in A Guide to Barsoom by John Flint Roy (1976)\n\nWold Newton scholars have also considered the differences between the real-life Burroughs and the narrator of his books in their article Burroughing Beneath the Page.\n\nI, Sherlock Holmes, ed. Michael Harrison (1977)\n\nIn essentials, this is a novelisation of Harrison's earlier work of Sherlockian speculation The World of Sherlock Holmes, with conclusions that he had reached found to be confirmed by the Great Detective's own memoir, preserved in the British Library.\n\nThe Wimsey Family by C.W. Scott-Giles (1977)\n\nPenned by the Fitzalan Pursuivant of Arms Extraordinary, based on his longstanding correspondence with Dorothy L. Sayers about the ancestry of Lord Peter Wimsey.\n\nJohn Steed: An Authorized Biography, Volume 1 - Jealous In Honour by Tim Heald (1977)\n\nThis was the first biography written by Tim Heald - with input from both Patrick Macnee (who features as a character, as does his father) and Brian Clemens. Only the first volume of the life of John Steed, central character of the television programme The Avengers, was ever produced, and only one edition was printed; nevertheless, Mr. Heald is probably nowadays known best as a biographer, although few of his other subjects can have had the same pre-existing acquaintance that he had with John Steed.\n\nThe book, which lacks any of the fantastic elements the television show is now best known for, is notable for its cameo appearance by James Bond and, somewhat bizarrely, a crossover with Evelyn Waugh's first novel, Decline and Fall. A rarity, it is described in hushed tones on various websites, such as here.\n\nThe Private Lives of Private Eyes, Spies, Crime Fighters, and Other Good Guys\" by Otto Penzler (1977)\n\nA large-format illustrated book, covering 'The lives and times of the world's 25 best-known fictional crime fighters'. Each section offers an overview of a character or characters, as well as a brief in-universe biography:\n\nLew Archer\n\nModesty Blaise\n\nJames Bond\n\nFather Brown\n\nNick Carter\n\nCharlie Chan\n\nNick and Nora Charles\n\nBulldog Drummond\n\nC. Auguste Dupin\n\nMike Hammer\n\nSherlock Holmes\n\nJules Maigret (excerpt available online here)\n\nPhilip Marlowe\n\nMiss Marple\n\nPerry Mason\n\nMr Moto\n\nHercule Poirot\n\nEllery Queen\n\nThe Shadow\n\nJohn Shaft\n\nSam Spade\n\nDr. Thorndyke\n\nPhilo Vance\n\nLord Peter Wimsey\n\nNero Wolfe\n\n\"Jonathan Swift Somers III: Cosmic Traveller in a Wheelchair\" by Philip José Farmer (1977)\n\nAvailable online here.\n\nThe Flying Spy: A History of G-8 by Nick Carr (1978)\n\nThe Great Detectives - A Host of the World's Most Celebrated Sleuths Are Unmasked by Their Authors, ed. Otto Penzer (1978)\n\nThis book consists of a series of essays about famous fictional detectives (or similar), written by their chroniclers. Predominantly the characters are treated as fictional, but some contributions are 'in-universe', with one or two somewhere in between!\n\nRoderick Alleyn by Ngaio Marsh\n\nJohn Appleby by Michael Innes\n\nLew Archer by Ross MacDonald\n\nFather Bredder by Leonard Holton\n\nFlash Casey by George Harmon Coxe\n\nPierre Chambrun by Hugh Pentecost\n\nInspector Cockrill by Christianna Brand\n\nCaptain Jose Da Silva by Robert L. Fish\n\nNancy Drew by Carolyn Keene\n\nThe 87th Precinct by Ed McBain\n\nFred Fellows by Hillary Waugh\n\nInspector Ghote by H. R. F. Keating (something of a self-satire)\n\nMatt Helm by Donald Hamilton\n\nDuncan Maclain by Baynard H. Kendrick\n\nMark McPherson by Vera Caspary\n\nLieutenant Luid Mendoza by Dell Shannon\n\nMr and Mrs North by Richard Lockridge\n\nPatrick Petrella by Michael Gilbert\n\nSuperintendent Pibble by Peter Dickinson\n\nQuiller by Adam Hall\n\nInspector Schmidt by George Bagby\n\nThe Shadow by Maxwell Grant\n\nMichael Shayne by Brett Halliday (this entry essentially a real-world version of Halliday's contribution to Four-and-Twenty Bloodhounds)\n\nVirgil Tibbs by John Ball (some of this entry is quoted in the TV Tropes website's article on the \"Literary Agent Hypothesis\")\n\nDick Tracy by Chester Gould\n\nInspector Van der Valk by Nicolas Freeling\n\nBiggles: The Authorized Biography by John Pearson (1978)\n\nThe conceit of this book is that Captain James Bigglesworth, the World War One flying ace whose adventures were described by W.E. Johns, lived near Pearson following his retirement. The book is not much liked by Biggles fans, as it takes considerable liberties with Johns's works.\n\nJeeves: A Gentleman's Personal Gentleman by C. Northcote Parkinson (1979)\n\nIn this book Parkinson assembles episodes from P.G. Wodehouse's Bertie Wooster stories into a continuous narrative, as well as adding incidents of his own. Not perhaps a successful imitation of Wodehouse's style, although the all-star cast audiobook adaptation in particular occasionally raises a smile. Notably, Lord Peter Wimsey, Bunter, Hercule Poirot and Father Brown all appear. Northcote Parkinson cites his inspiration as Geoffrey Jaggard's concordance-cum-book of quotations, Wooster's World (1967). He also cites a number of fictional sources, including a spurious biography of Lord Peter Wimsey, Whimsical Sleuth by Wallace Edgar.\n\nThe Memories of Dame Hilda Bracket: One Little Maid, with a Foreword by Dr Evadne Hinge PTH LRAM, ed. Patrick Fyffe (1980)\n\nAutobiography of one half of the light opera-singing duo, Hinge & Bracket, edited by one of the two gentlemen who (so-to-speak) knew them best.\n\nThe Great Detectives: Seven Original Investigations by Julian Symons, illustrated by Tom Adams (1981)\n\nA coffee-table book of original critical, speculative and creative material, written with the permission of the daughters of Agatha Christie, Rex Stout and Raymond Chandler, and the co-operation of Georges Simenon and Frederic Dannay, comprising:\n\n\"How a Hermit was Disturbed in His Retirement\" (short story in which a very young Miss Marple meets the elderly Sherlock Holmes, also anthologised elsewhere under the title \"The Adventure of Hillerman Hall\")\n\n\"About Miss Marple and St. Mary Mead\" (a reminiscence written at Symons's request by the Reverend Leonard Clement, narrator of the first Miss Marple novel The Murder at the Vicarage\n\n\"In Which Archie Goodwin Remembers\" (Symons interviews Archie Goodwin while visiting the United States, and learns the fate of Nero Wolfe)\n\n\"Which Expounds the Ellery Queen Mystery\" (still in America, Symons researches the life of Ellery Queen, and finds evidence to support his theory that the detective was actually two different men, Ellery and Dan. Frederic Dannay's opinion is also sought)\n\n\"About Maigret and the Stolen Papers\" (a short story crossing-over Maigret and Hercule Poirot)\n\n\"The Life of Hercule Poirot, based on the notes of Captain Arthur Hastings\" (Symons meets the elderly Captain Hastings, and takes over his project to put together a full biography of the Belgian sleuth)\n\n\"About the Birth of Philip Marlowe\" (Symons meets the man on whom Raymond Chandler based Philip Marlowe)\n\nStar Trek II Biographies by William Rotsler (1982)\n\nThe author of tie-in fiction to the movies Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek III: The Search for Spock was encouraged by his editor to take a closer look at the lives of the crew of the USS Enterprise. Although much of his book has since been contradicted, Rotsler is famously credited with coining Lt. Uhura's first name.\n\n==\"The\" is My Middle Name by Gonzo the Great, ed. Chris Langham (1982, unpublished) Advertised in 1982, this volume purportedly was unable to find a publisher. It is unlikely to see print now.\n\nThe Brownstone House of Nero Wolfe, as told by Archie Goodwin, ed. Ken Darby (1983)\n\nA fictional biography of Nero Wolfe's house, also revealing much about both Wolfe and Archie's lives. Flatly contradicts both Symons's book and Robert Goldsborough's continuation novels regarding the fate of Wolfe and Archie.\n\nThe Private Life of Dr. Watson, ed. Michael Hardwick (1983)\n\nThis novel has the doctor recall his somewhat racy adventures in youth, before he encountered Holmes. The title is a riff on The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes - the novelisation of the film of that name had been written by Michael and Mollie Hardwick.\n\nSuspects by David Thomson (1985)\n\nNot, unfortunately, consistent with the Wold Newton Universe. The narrator of this novel writes biographies of different movie characters, expanding on what is known from the films, and gradually the articles begin to bleed into each other. The follow-up, Silverlight, took a more conventional style, and mainly covered figures from the Wild West, both historical and fictional.\n\nSherlock Holmes: My Life and Crimes', ed. Michael Hardwick (1986)\n\nAlthough the book opens as an autobiography, discussing - for example - Sherlock Holmes's early work with the Pinkertons, it rapidly turns into a novel as Holmes reveals to the reader the true events of the Great Hiatus.\n\nThe Life and Times of Miss Jane Marple by Anne Hart (1989)\n\nThe Life and Times of Hercule Poirot by Anne Hart (1990)\n\nEssentially an analysis of the stories and characters as fiction.\n\nMy Gorgeous Life by Dame Edna Everage (1989)\n\nPerhaps not as classy as Hinge & Bracket (she's Australian) but certainly better-known and much more influential.\n\nArthur Daley Straight Up: The Autobiography, ed. Paul Ableman and Leon Griffiths (1991)\n\nThis book begins as a narrative of the youth of Arthur Daley, the car dealer from Minder, but ultimately turns into a selection of his adventures, probably derived from television episodes. Interestingly, the cover bears a recommendation from Derek Trotter (q.v.). Other television shows have produced books in a similar vein to Straight Up - finding a way of adapting what is on the screen into a book without just producing flat novelisations or script books - but this is perhaps the closest to actual autobiography.\n\nLeopold Bloom: A Biography aka The Life of Leopold Bloom: A Novel by Peter Costello (1992)\n\nA straight biographical study of the protagonist of James Joyce's Ulysses.\n\nThe Reminisences of the Hon. Galahad Threepwood, ed. N.T.P. Murphy (1993)\n\nOstensibly a later edition of the book consumed by the pig Empress of Blandings in Wodehouse's Heavy Weather, and finally revealing the truth about Parslowe and the prawns, and what happened to Lord Ickenham and Pongo at the dog races, this book is actually about the real-life characters who haunted the Pelican Club at the end of the nineteenth century.\n\nThe Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck by Don Rosa (1994, 1997)\n\nRosa carefully constructed stories for the Uncle Scrooge comic based on references to Scrooge McDuck's early life as revealed in the early Carl Barks comics, much as other fictional biographers drew non-fiction styled histories from their original sources.\n\nHolmes and Watson by June Thomson (1995)\n\nThe Eyes Of The Fleet: A Popular History Of Frigates And Frigate Captains, 1793-1815 by Anthony Price (1996)\n\nA study of a selection of naval heroes of the Napoleonic Wars - men such as Pigot, Cochrane, Hoste, Pellew, and... um... Hornblower.\n\nRadio's Captain Midnight: The Wartime Biography by Stephen Kallis (1999)\n\nBasil Brush: My Story, ed. Andrew Crofts (2001)\n\nEven puppets have turned to the written word to tell their life-story.\n\nThe World of Austin Powers by Andy Lane (2002)\n\nLife Beyond the Box (2003)\n\nA pair of BBC television programmes, rather than books:\n\n\"Norman Stanley Fletcher\" told the life story of the central character of the prison sitcom Porridge, revealing details of his early life, and the fates of the main recurring characters of the series. It starred the surviving members of the original cast.\n\n\"Margo\", conversely, featured none of the surviving cast of the sitcom The Good Life, and was a deconstruction of the snobbish Margo Leadbetter, revealing the skeletons in her cupboard.\n\n'Fawlty Towers': A Worshipper's Guide by Lars Holger Holm (2004)\n\nThis is the book that, notoriously, presents the script of the alleged thirteenth episode of John Cleese and Connie Booth's sitcom, supposedly filmed but never broadcast. Amongst the other material in the book are potted biographies of each of the residents of the Torquay hotel.\n\nNancy Drew, Confessions of a Teen Sleuth: A Parody, ed. Chelsea Cain (2005)\n\nLes Nombreuses vies d’Arsène Lupin by André-François Ruaud (2005)\n\nVolume 1 of a series of fictional biographies published by the French imprint la bibliothèque rouge. Many volumes address not only the title character but other characters on a similar nature, and feature French translations of pastiches familiar to a Wold Newton audience.\n\nLes Nombreuses vies de Sherlock Holmes by André-François Ruaud & Xavier Mauméjean (2005)\n\nLa bibliothèque rouge, Volume 2.\n\nLes Nombreuses vies d’Hercule Poirot by André-François Ruaud & Xavier Mauméjean (2006)\n\nLa bibliothèque rouge, Volume 3.\n\nLes Nombreuses vies de Fantômas by Étienne Barillier (2006)\n\nLa bibliothèque rouge, Volume 4.\n\n'Indiana Jones: Biografía' by Marcus Brody, ed.
