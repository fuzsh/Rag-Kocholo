        "text": "Crime fiction novels are arguably one of the most popular literary genres, and people who love this type of literature have a lot of different authors to choose from. Some of the most famous authors include Lee Child, Dennis Lehane, and Raymond Chandler\n\nAnd while we’re discussing good crime fiction and detective authors, one writer who manages to create wonder thrill, suspense, and anticipation with his books is Michael Connelly.\n\nWho is Michael Connelly?\n\nMichael Connelly is an award-winning American author from Philadelphia who is known for crime fiction and detective novels. His love of writing grew when he was working as a journalist, first in Florida and later in LA for The Los Angeles Times.\n\nOver the years, he has written over 30 books that span five different series, each of which has a fascinating protagonist and interesting storylines.\n\nConnelly has been awarded the Edgar Award, the Anthony Award, and the Macavity Award for his writing. Additionally, his books are popular all over the world and have been translated into more than 40 different languages.\n\nMichael Connelly’s book series\n\nUnlike most authors in this genre who only write series revolving around one character, Connelly has written five different series of novels.\n\nHarry Bosch series\n\nHieronymus “Harry” Bosch is a Vietnam War veteran turned LAPD detective who is passionate, relentless, and determined while solving crimes. His main goal is to bring justice to the victims whose cases he takes on even if it causes him to run afoul of the law here and there.\n\nThis is Michael Connelly’s most popular book series and was even adapted into a TV show in 2014 named Bosch with Titus Welliver playing the titular character.\n\nJack McEvoy series\n\nJack McEvoy is a dedicated crime journalist who will stop at nothing to get the story he wants and solve the case he’s reporting on.\n\nThere are only three books in the series so far, but in all of them, our hero is determined to bring the killer to justice and untangle the web that was woven into the high-profile crimes he’s writing about. Rachel Walling, an FBI special agent, is also a major character in the series.\n\nMickey Haller series\n\nMickey Haller is a criminal defense attorney living in Los Angeles, California and operating out of his Lincoln Town Car (hence the alternative name to this series, the Lincoln Lawyer books). He’s incredibly street-smart and knows better than anyone how to work the judicial system to his advantage and help his clients like no other attorney ever could.\n\nRenée Ballard series\n\nRenée Ballard is a detective working night shifts at the Los Angeles Police Department’s Hollywood Division. She is tenacious and determined and will stop at nothing to bring justice to the victims of the gruesome crimes she works on. Her supervisors often see her as a troublemaker but she still takes her job seriously, even when others don’t.\n\nTerry McCaleb series\n\nTerry McCaleb is a retired FBI agent who can’t let go of his love of crime-solving so he becomes a private investigator. There are three books in the series, and in all of them, McCaleb investigates murders he takes a personal interest in and that take him down a road of crime, thrill, and suspense.\n\nOverview of Michael Connelly books in publication order\n\nEven though Michael Connelly is best known for his Harry Bosch book series, he has written many books over the years, both fiction and non-fiction.
