        "text": "When best-selling author Michael Connelly introduced LAPD Detective Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch in his first novel \"Black Echo\" in 1992, nobody expected that Harry would still be investigating crimes almost 30 years later. On Wednesday, Oct. 23 at The Music Hall, Connelly will introduce his latest book, \"The Night Fire,\" with Bosch as the leading character teaming up with the popular LAPD Detective Renee Ballard. Harry has appeared in 23 of Connelly’s 33 novels. He also stars in the Amazon Studios drama \"Bosch,\" going into its sixth season with Michael Connelly as the executive producer.\n\nOne of the most successful writers on the scene today, Michael Connelly’s books have sold more than 74 million copies worldwide and have been translated into 40 languages. As the New York Times No. 1 best-selling author, his books have received critical acclaim, numerous awards and rave reviews from around the globe.\n\nWe recently talked with Connelly about his latest book and his career as a writer. Our conversation began by asking about the name Hieronymus Bosch – a Dutch painter in the 14th and 15th Centuries whose paintings are filled with phantasmagoric characters and surreal images.\n\n“I was studying humanities when I was in college and discovered Hieronymus Bosch,” Connelly said. “In those pre-Internet days, not a lot was known about the painter. His most famous work is ‘The Garden of Earthly Delights’ – a mysterious, dark allegory about good and evil and the wages of sin. His paintings depict a metaphoric world of chaos. Ten years later, I wrote my first novel and named my character Hieronymus Bosch. As a detective, he is crawling through a crime scene and traveling through a similar terrain of good and evil.”\n\nReaders of the Harry Bosch novels know that the protagonist was a \"tunnel rat\" during the Vietnam War. These infantry men would dig into the maze of Vietcong tunnels and blow them up. Connelly explains that during his formative years, the Vietnam War left a vivid impression. “When I was working on a construction crew in high school, the lead guy had been a tunnel rat in Vietnam. What could be scarier than that. It is also a metaphor for the book – traveling through a dark and dangerous tunnel.”\n\nAs we follow Harry over the years, he ages as the series progresses. “Both the character and the city evolve,” Connelly said. “Writing about him for almost 30 years, it is also a commentary on how the city and the world has changed.”\n\nIn \"The Night Fire.\" Bosch is now retired, “but he keeps a hand in and still has that zeal and fire,” Connelly said. He joins forces with Ballard who has appeared in two previous novels. They come together again on the murder case that obsessed Bosch’s mentor Jack Thompson who taught him to take every case personally and to be relentless in solving each crime. Thompson is now dead and at the funeral, his widow hands Bosch the murder book on the case that was hidden for 20 years. The investigative team of Bosch and Ballard dig in to the unsolved killing and why Thompson hid the murder book. The fast-paced page-turner takes readers through a \"dark and dangerous tunnel\" of crime and suspicion.\n\nWhat led Michael Connelly to follow his own path as a writer of crime fiction? He explains that he grew up in Philadelphia and the family moved to Florida when he was 12.\n\n“My dad wanted to be a painter and attended the Institute of Art. But he put away his own dreams in order to make a living and raise a family. He used his design skills as a property developer. When I told him I wanted to be a crime novelist, he advised me to go into journalism to get all the experience I would need. My late mother was a reader who loved crime novels. I always picture her hands holding a book.”\n\nAfter graduating from the University of Florida, he worked as crime beat reporter at newspapers in South Florida. Named a finalist for a Pulitzer Prize on a series about survivors of a 1985 Delta plane crash, the honor earned him a position on the crime beat at the Los Angeles Times.\n\nA prolific writer, Connelly generally writes a book every year. He credits his experience in journalism for his ability to sit down and write on a deadline. Asked about his writing routine, he said: “I write at my own pace. I get up at 4:00 or 5:00 every morning and write from 5 to 10 a.m. Then I ask myself if I want to keep going or do I want to do something else for the day.”\n\nHe noted that he never outlines a book. “I let it evolve, but I have a good idea of how it will end.” His lengthy cast of characters “are inspired from all over. They come to life as I go along. I ask a lot from these characters. Some last for only a couple of books. Harry has stuck around.”\n\nGo & Do\n\nWhat: Writers on a New England Stage presents author Michael Connelly\n\nWhen: 7 p.m., Wednesday, Oct. 23\n\nWhere: The Music Hall, 28 Chestnut St., Portsmouth\n\nTickets: $13.75; for each 1-2 tickets sold, the purchase of a book voucher (The Night Fire, $29 hardcover) is required.
