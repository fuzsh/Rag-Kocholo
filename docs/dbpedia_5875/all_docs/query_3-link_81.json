Matthew McConaughey starred as Mick Haller in the movie, but it didn’t turn into a series of films.\n\nHowever, in 2022, a TV show based on “The Lincoln Lawyer” was released, starring Manuel Garcia-Rulfo as Mickey Haller.\n\nStreaming platforms are the best fit for Connelly’s stories. Amazon Studios has already produced “Bosch,” a series that ran for seven seasons with Titus Welliver in the lead role.
