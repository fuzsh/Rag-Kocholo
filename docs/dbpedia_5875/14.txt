And while the Big Apple’s streets may be uncharacteristically quiet these days, the customary hustle and bustle of the city has served Belsky—who counts Raymond Chandler, Ross Macdonald, Agatha Christie, Robert B. Parker, and Michael Connelly among his influences— well in the past. He has written 14 crime novels—including May’s The Last Scoop—and thrived in a business equally volatile to publishing: the news industry.

In his decades-long career, Belsky served as metropolitan editor of the New York Post, managing editor of the New York Daily News, news editor at Star magazine, and, most recently, a managing editor at NBC News. Despite the necessary fidelity to facts, this background has notably benefited his fiction.

“I think my journalism background helps me in many ways as a novelist. The two most important are: 1) writing clearly and straightforwardly for the reader and 2) meeting deadlines for my books,” Belsky says. “Both of these things are critical for a journalist, and they’ve helped me enormously in my career as a fiction author, too, I believe.”
