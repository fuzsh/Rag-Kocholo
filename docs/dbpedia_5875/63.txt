I love Los Angeles-based crime fiction, particularly the work of authors like Raymond Chandler, Ross MacDonald, Joseph Wambaugh and Michael Connelly. The work below is an attempt to tie together Connelly’s dark, iconic Detective Harry Bosch - especially as embodied by the great Titus Welliver - with the smoky, noir-infused jazz that Harry loves so much. Most of these pieces were influenced or inspired by the work of Reid Miles, the designer who created somewhere around 500 covers for Blue Note Records in the mid-twentieth century. I’m not breaking new ground here; Miles’ work has been the launching point for a thousand other designers and artists. Still, there’s something about the way these mid-century colors & typefaces just seem to fit Harry’s L.A., a place where shadows and sadness are as common as sunshine.
