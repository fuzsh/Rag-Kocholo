        "text": "Kynurenine pathway metabolism and the microbiota-gut-brain axis.\n\nPubMed\n\nKennedy, P J; Cryan, J F; Dinan, T G; Clarke, G\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIt has become increasingly clear that the gut microbiota influences not only gastrointestinal physiology but also central nervous system (CNS) function by modulating signalling pathways of the microbiota-gut-brain axis. Understanding the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning the influence exerted by the gut microbiota on brain function and behaviour has become a key research priority. Microbial regulation of tryptophan metabolism has become a focal point in this regard, with dual emphasis on the regulation of serotonin synthesis and the control of kynurenine pathway metabolism. Here, we focus in detail on the latter pathway and begin by outlining the structural and functional dynamics of the gut microbiota and the signalling pathways of the brain-gut axis. We summarise preclinical and clinical investigations demonstrating that the gut microbiota influences CNS physiology, anxiety, depression, social behaviour, cognition and visceral pain. Pertinent studies are drawn from neurogastroenterology demonstrating the importance of tryptophan and its metabolites in CNS and gastrointestinal function. We outline how kynurenine pathway metabolism may be regulated by microbial control of neuroendocrine function and components of the immune system. Finally, preclinical evidence demonstrating direct and indirect mechanisms by which the gut microbiota can regulate tryptophan availability for kynurenine pathway metabolism, with downstream effects on CNS function, is reviewed. Targeting the gut microbiota represents a tractable target to modulate kynurenine pathway metabolism. Efforts to develop this approach will markedly increase our understanding of how the gut microbiota shapes brain and behaviour and provide new insights towards successful translation of microbiota-gut-brain axis research from bench to bedside.

Microglia regulate KP balance by preferentially producing oxidative metabolites, including quinolinic acid. Research has focused on the interplay between cytokines and HPA axis-derived corticosteroids in regulating microglial activity and effects of KP metabolites directly on neurons; however, the potential role that KP metabolites have directly on microglial activity is unknown. Here, murine microglia were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide(LPS). After 6â¯h, mRNA expression of interleukin(IL)-1Î², IL-6, tumor necrosis factor(TNF)-Î± and inducible nitric oxide synthase(iNOS) was dose-dependently increased along with the rate-limiting enzymes for oxidative KP metabolism, indoleamine-2,3-dioxygenase(IDO)-1 and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase(KMO). By 24â¯h post-LPS, kynurenine and quinolinic acid in the media was elevated. Inhibiting KMO with Ro 61-8048 during LPS challenge attenuated extracellular nitrite accumulation and expression of KMO and TNF-Î± in response to LPS. Similarly, primary microglia isolated from KMO -/- mice exhibited a significantly reduced pro-inflammatory response to LPS compared to WT controls. To determine whether the substrate (kynurenine) or end product (quinolinic acid) of KMO-dependent metabolism modulates the LPS response, microglia were treated with increasing concentrations of L-kynurenine or quinolinic acid in combination with LPS or saline. Interestingly, quinolinic acid did not impact the microglial LPS response. However, L-kynurenine had dose-dependent inhibitory effect on the LPS response. These data are the first to show an anti-inflammatory effect of KMO inhibition on microglia during immune challenge and suggest that KP metabolic balance may play a direct role in regulating microglia activity.

Several novel genetic and pharmacological tools have recently been developed to modulate key regulatory steps in the KP such as the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). This insight has offered new options for exploring the mechanistic link between this metabolic pathway and HD, and provided novel opportunities for the development of candidate drug-like compounds. Here, we present an overview of the field, focusing on some novel approaches for interrogating the pathway experimentally.\n\nMetabolic shift of the kynurenine pathway impairs alcohol and cocaine seeking and relapse.\n\nPubMed\n\nVengeliene, Valentina; Cannella, Nazzareno; Takahashi, Tatiane; Spanagel, Rainer\n\n2016-09-01\n\nThe glutamatergic system plays a key role in the maintenance of drug use and development of drug-related conditioned behaviours. In particular, hyper-glutamatergic activity and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) activation may drive drug craving and relapse. Inhibition of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) shifts the metabolic kynurenine pathway towards production of kynurenic acid, which leads to a reduction of glutamatergic/NMDAR activity via different mechanisms. In this study, we investigated whether drug-seeking and relapse behaviour could be modified by the metabolic shift of endogenous kynurenine pathway. An inhibitor of kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) Ro61-8048 (4 and 40Â mg/kg) and its prodrug JM6 (100 and 200Â mg/kg) were tested in two behavioural rat models for drug seeking and relapse-the alcohol deprivation effect (ADE) model in long-term alcohol-drinking rats and the model of cue-induced reinstatement of alcohol- and cocaine-seeking behaviour. Our results show that relapse-like alcohol drinking during the ADE was abolished by repeated intraperitoneal administration of Ro61-8048 and significantly reduced by its oral prodrug JM6. Cue-induced reinstatement of both alcohol- and cocaine-seeking behaviour was also abolished by administration of Ro61-8048. Pharmacological enhancement of endogenous kynurenic acid levels provides a novel treatment strategy to interfere with glutamatergic/NMDAR activity as well as with craving and relapse in alcohol-dependent patients and drug addicts.\n\nModulation of the Kynurenine Pathway for the Potential Treatment of Neurodegenerative Diseases\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nCourtney, Stephen; Scheel, Andreas\n\nModulation of tryptophan metabolism and in particular the kynurenine pathway is of considerable interest in the discovery of potential new treatments for neurodegenerative diseases. A number of small molecule inhibitors of the kynurenine metabolic pathway enzymes have been identified over recent years; a summary of these and their utility has been reviewed in this chapter. In particular, inhibitors of kynurenine monooxygenase represent an opportunity to develop a therapy for Huntington's disease; progress in the optimization of small molecule inhibitors of this enzyme is also described.\n\nKynurenine pathway metabolites and enzymes involved in redox reactions.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzÃ¡lez Esquivel, D; RamÃ­rez-Ortega, D; Pineda, B; Castro, N; RÃ­os, C; PÃ©rez de la Cruz, V\n\n2017-01-01\n\nOxido-reduction reactions are a fundamental part of the life due to support many vital biological processes as cellular respiration and glucose oxidation. In the redox reactions, one substance transfers one or more electrons to another substance. An important electron carrier is the coenzyme NAD + , which is involved in many metabolic pathways. De novo biosynthesis of NAD + is through the kynurenine pathway, the major route of tryptophan catabolism, which is sensitive to redox environment and produces metabolites with redox capacity, able to alter biological functions that are controlled by redox-responsive signaling pathways. Kynurenine pathway metabolites have been implicated in the physiology process and in the physiopathology of many diseases; processes that also share others factors as dysregulation of calcium homeostasis, mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation and cell death, which impact the redox environment. This review examines in detail the available evidence in which kynurenine pathway metabolites participate in redox reactions and their effect on cellular redox homeostasis, since the knowledge of the main factors and mechanisms that lead to cell death in many neurodegenative disorders and other pathologies, such as mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress and kynurenines imbalance, will allow to develop therapies using them as targets.

Because endogenous KYNA modulates extracellular glutamate and acetylcholine levels in the PFC, these increases may be pathophysiologically significant. Using brain tissue from SZ patients and matched controls, we now measured the activity of several KP enzymes (kynurenine 3-monooxygenase [KMO], kynureninase, 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid dioxygenase [3-HAO], quinolinic acid phosphoribosyltransferase [QPRT], and kynurenine aminotransferase II [KAT II]) in the PFC, ie, Brodmann areas (BA) 9 and 10. Compared with controls, the activities of KMO (in BA 9 and 10) and 3-HAO (in BA 9) were significantly reduced in SZ, though there were no significant differences between patients and controls in kynureninase, QPRT, and KAT II. In the same samples, we also confirmed the increase in the tissue levels of KYNA in SZ. As examined in rats treated chronically with the antipsychotic drug risperidone, the observed biochemical changes were not secondary to medication. A persistent reduction in KMO activity may have a particular bearing on pathology because it may signify a shift of KP metabolism toward enhanced KYNA synthesis. The present results further support the hypothesis that the normalization of cortical KP metabolism may constitute an effective new treatment strategy in SZ.

Modulation of enzyme activity along this pathway may therefore offer potential new therapeutic strategies for these conditions. Considering their prominent positions in the KP, the enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase and kynurenine aminotransferase, appear the most attractive targets. Already, increasing interest in this pathway has led to the identification of a number of potent and selective enzyme inhibitors with promising pre-clinical data and the elucidation of several enzyme crystal structures provides scope to rationalize the molecular mechanisms of inhibitor activity. The field seems poised to yield one or more inhibitors that should find clinical utility.

Mounting focus has been dedicated to investigating the role of these metabolites during neurodevelopment and elucidating their involvement in the pathophysiology of psychiatric disorders with a developmental component, such as schizophrenia. In this review, we describe the changes in KP metabolism in the brain from gestation until adulthood and illustrate how environmental and genetic factors affect the KP during development. With a particular focus on kynurenic acid, the antagonist of Î±7 nicotinic acetylcholine (Î±7nACh) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, both implicated in modulating brain development, we review animal models designed to ascertain the role of perinatal KP elevation on long-lasting biochemical, neuropathological, and behavioral deficits later in life. We present new data demonstrating that combining perinatal choline-supplementation, to potentially increase activation of Î±7nACh receptors during development, with embryonic kynurenine manipulation is effective in attenuating cognitive impairments in adult rat offspring. With these findings in mind, we conclude the review by discussing the advancement of therapeutic interventions that would target not only symptoms, but potentially the root cause of central nervous system diseases that manifest from a perinatal KP insult.

It is known that these cytokines stimulate indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), which increase tryptophan metabolism through the kynurenine pathway, and that this can cause increased production of neurotoxic compounds. Brain tissues from Alzheimer's disease patients and agematched controls were investigated using label-free fluorescence spectroscopy. Tryptophan (exc. 280/ em. 340 nm) and its metabolites (N-formyl-L-kynurenine (exc. 325/em. 434 nm), kynurenine (exc. 365/em. 480 nm) and kynurenic acid (exc. 330/em. 390 nm)) have distinct spectral profiles. Preliminary results show a difference in the optical signatures in three important areas of the brain (hippocampus, BA 9, BA 17) between patients with Alzheimer's disease and agedmatched controls (normal), and a marked relative increase in tryptophan in the Alzheimer's patients. Thus determinations of tryptophan to tryptophan metabolite ratios could potentially be used to measure IDO and TDO activity and the degree of inflammation in the brain. This label-free optical technique may be useful in the study of Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nThe kynurenine pathway in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.\n\nPubMed\n\nErhardt, Sophie; Schwieler, Lilly; Imbeault, Sophie; Engberg, GÃ¶ran\n\n2017-01-01\n\nThe kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation generates several neuroactive compounds. Of those, kynurenic acid is an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and alpha7 nicotinic receptor antagonist. The kynurenic acid hypothesis of schizophrenia is built upon the fact that kynurenic acid blocks glutamate receptors and is elevated in schizophrenia. Kynurenic acid tightly controls glutamatergic and dopaminergic neurotransmission and elevated brain levels appear related to psychotic symptoms and cognitive impairments. Contributing to enhanced production of kynurenic acid, the expression and enzyme activity of kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) are reduced in schizophrenia and in bipolar patients with a history of psychosis. The kynurenine pathway is also critically regulated by cytokines, and, indeed, the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1Î² and IL-6 are elevated in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and stimulate the production of kynurenic acid. One physiological mechanism controlling the activity of the kynurenine pathway originates from the protein sorting nexin 7 (SNX7). This glial signaling pathway initiates a caspase-8-driven activation of IL-1Î² that induces tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase 2 (TDO2), an enzyme in the kynurenine pathway. A recent study shows that a genetic variation resulting in decreased expression of SNX7 is linked to increased central levels of kynurenic acid and ultimately to psychosis and cognitive dysfunction in bipolar disorder. Experimental studies highlight the detrimental effects of increased synthesis of kynurenic acid during sensitive periods of early brain development. Furthermore, experimental studies strongly support inhibition of kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) II as a novel target and a valuable pharmacological strategy in the treatment of psychosis and for improving cognitive performance relevant for schizophrenia.

Copyright Ã\n\nA link between central kynurenine metabolism and bone strength in rats with chronic kidney disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPawlak, Krystyna; Oksztulska-Kolanek, Ewa; Domaniewski, Tomasz; Znorko, Beata; Karbowska, Malgorzata; Citkowska, Aleksandra; Rogalska, Joanna; Roszczenko, Alicja; Brzoska, Malgorzata M.; Pawlak, Dariusz\n\n2017-01-01\n\nBackground Disturbances in mineral and bone metabolism represent one of the most complex complications of chronic kidney disease (CKD). Serotonin, a monoamine synthesized from tryptophan, may play a potential role in bone metabolism. Brain-derived serotonin exerts a positive effect on the bone structure by limiting bone resorption and enhancing bone formation. Tryptophan is the precursor not only to the serotonin but also and primarily to kynurenine metabolites. The ultimate aim of the present study was to determine the association between central kynurenine metabolism and biomechanical as well as geometrical properties of bone in the experimental model of the early stage of CKD. Methods Thirty-three Wistar rats were randomly divided into two groups (sham-operated and subtotal nephrectomized animals). Three months after surgery, serum samples were obtained for the determination of biochemical parameters, bone turnover biomarkers, and kynurenine pathway metabolites; tibias were collected for bone biomechanical, bone geometrical, and bone mass density analysis; brains were removed and divided into five regions for the determination of kynurenine pathway metabolites. Results Subtotal nephrectomized rats presented higher serum concentrations of creatinine, urea nitrogen, and parathyroid hormone, and developed hypocalcemia. Several biomechanical and geometrical parameters were significantly elevated in rats with experimentally induced CKD. Subtotal nephrectomized rats presented significantly higher kynurenine concentrations and kynurenine/tryptophan ratio and significantly lower tryptophan levels in all studied parts of the brain. Kynurenine in the frontal cortex and tryptophan in the hypothalamus and striatum correlated positively with the main parameters of bone biomechanics and bone geometry. Discussion In addition to the complex mineral, hormone, and metabolite changes, intensified central kynurenine turnover may play an important role in the development of bone\n\nDYSFUNCTIONAL KYNURENINE PATHWAY METABOLISM IN THE R6/2 MOUSE MODEL OF HUNTINGTONâS DISEASE\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSathyasaikumar, Korrapati V.; Stachowski, Erin K.; Amori, Laura; Guidetti, Paolo; Muchowski, Paul J.; Schwarcz, Robert\n\n2013-01-01\n\nElevated concentrations of neurotoxic metabolites of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation may play a causative role in Huntingtonâs disease (HD). The brain levels of one of these compounds, 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), are increased in both HD and several mouse models of the disease. In the present study, we examined this impairment in greater detail using the R6/2 mouse, a well-established animal model of HD. Initially, mutant and age-matched wild-type mice received an intrastriatal injection of 3H-tryptophan to assess the acute, local de novo production of kynurenine, the immediate bioprecursor of 3-HK, in vivo. No effect of genotype was observed between 4 and 12 weeks of age. In contrast, intrastriatally applied 3H-kynurenine resulted in significantly increased neosynthesis of 3H-3-HK, but not other tritiated KP metabolites, in the R6/2 striatum. Subsequent ex vivo studies in striatal, cortical and cerebellar tissue revealed substantial increases in the activity of the biosynthetic enzyme of 3-HK, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) and significant reductions in the activity of its degradative enzyme, kynureninase, in HD mice starting at 4 weeks of age. Decreased kynureninase activity was most evident in the cortex and preceded the increase in KMO activity. The activity of other KP enzymes showed no consistent brain abnormalities in the mutant mice. These findings suggest that impairments in its immediate metabolic enzymes jointly account for the abnormally high brain levels of 3-HK in the R6/2 model of HD.

Although several investigations have been conducted on MDD, these have seldom shed light on KP changes in late-life depression (LLD). We aimed to investigate whether tryptophan (TRP) metabolism and kynurenine (KYN) metabolism are imbalanced in LLD patients and to explore the differences in KP characteristics between early onset depression (EOD) and late onset depression (LOD) patients. We investigated 170 LLD patients (EOD 90, LOD 80) and 135 normal controls. Serum concentrations of TRP, KYN and kynurenic acid (KYNA) were detected by the liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Depressive symptoms were assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD-17). LLD patients exhibited lower levels of TRP, KYN, KYNA and KYNA/KYN ratio and a higher level of KYN/TRY ratio than normal controls. The decrease in TRP and the increase in KYN/TRP ratio were found in LOD patients. A low TRP level without increased KYN/TRP ratio was found in EOD patients. The \"Depression\" factor, which was extracted from HAMD-17 by the principal component factor analysis, was correlated with the TRP level and KYNA/KYN ratio in the EOD group, but no such correlation was found in the LOD group. KP changes were observed in LLD patients; LOD patients showed profound shifts in TRP metabolism, while EOD patients showed low TRP level and a shift in KYN metabolism. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Recent studies have focused on three enzymes in this pathway: indoleamine dioxygenase (IDO1), kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO), and kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II). IDO1 inhibitors are currently in clinical trials for the treatment of cancer, and these agents may also have therapeutic utility in neurological disorders, including multiple sclerosis. KMO inhibitors are being investigated as potential treatments for neurodegenerative diseases, such as Huntington's and Alzheimer's diseases. KAT II inhibitors have been proposed in new therapeutic approaches toward psychiatric and cognitive disorders, including cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia. Numerous medicinal chemistry studies are currently aimed at the design of novel, potent, and selective inhibitors for each of these enzymes. The emerging opportunities and significant challenges associated with pharmacological modulation of these enzymes will be explored in this review.\n\nIndoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism mediates inflammation-induced deficit in recognition memory\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHeisler, Jillian M.; OâConnor, Jason C.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nCognitive dysfunction in depression is a prevalent and debilitating symptom that is poorly treated by the currently available pharmacotherapies. Research over the past decade has provided evidence for proinflammatory involvement in the neurobiology of depressive disorders and symptoms associated with these disorders, including aspects of memory dysfunction. Recent clinical studies implicate inflammation-related changes in kynurenine metabolism as a potential pathogenic factor in the development of a range of depressive symptoms, including deficits in cognition and memory. Additionally, preclinical work has demonstrated a number of mood-related depressive-like behaviors to be dependent on indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO1), the inflammation-induced rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway. Here, we demonstrate in a mouse model, that peripheral administration of endotoxin induced a deficit in recognition memory. Mice deficient in IDO were protected from cognitive impairment. Furthermore, endotoxin-induced inflammation increased kynurenine metabolism within the perirhinal/entorhinal cortices, brain regions which have been implicated in recognition memory. A single peripheral injection of kynurenine, the metabolic product of IDO1, was sufficient to induce a deficit in recognition memory in both control and IDO null mice. Finally, kynurenine monooxygenase (KMO) deficient mice were also protected from inflammation-induced deficits on novel object recognition. These data implicate IDO-dependent neurotoxic kynurenine metabolism as a pathogenic factor for cognitive dysfunction in inflammation-induced depressive disorders and a potential novel target for the treatment of these disorders.

Here, we show for the first time how IL-1Î², a pro-inflammatory cytokine shown to be increased in depressed patients, decreases neurogenesis in human hippocampal progenitor cells. IL-1Î² was detrimental to neurogenesis, as shown by a decrease in the number of doublecortin-positive neuroblasts (â28%), and mature, microtubule-associated protein-2-positive neurons (â36%). Analysis of the enzymes that regulate the kynurenine pathway showed that IL-1Î² induced an upregulation of transcripts for indolamine-2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), and kynureninase (42-, 12- and 30-fold increase, respectively, under differentiating conditions), the enzymes involved in the neurotoxic arm of the kynurenine pathway. Moreover, treatment with IL-1Î² resulted in an increase in kynurenine, the catabolic product of IDO-induced tryptophan metabolism. Interestingly, co-treatment with the KMO inhibitor Ro 61-8048 reversed the detrimental effects of IL-1Î² on neurogenesis. These observations indicate that IL-1Î² has a critical role in regulating neurogenesis whereas affecting the availability of tryptophan and the production of enzymes conducive to toxic metabolites. Our results suggest that inhibition of the kynurenine pathway may provide a new therapy to revert inflammatory-induced reduction in neurogenesis.

The present review of genetic and hormonal factors regulating kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism suggests that this pathway mediates both genetic and environmental mechanisms of depression. Rate-limiting enzymes of kynurenine formation, tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) are activated by stress hormones (TDO) and/or by pro-inflammatory cytokines (IDO). Simultaneous presence of high producers alleles of proinflammatory cytokines genes (e.g., interferon-gamma and tumor necrosis factor-alpha) determines the genetic predisposition to depression via up-regulation of IDO while impact of environmental stresses is mediated via hormonal activation of TDO. Tryptophan-kynurenine pathway represents a major meeting point of gene-environment interaction in depression and a new target for pharmacological intervention.

L-DOPA treatment may affect tryptophan metabolism via the kynurenine pathway. Altered levels of kynurenine metabolites can affect glutamatergic transmission and may play a role in the development of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. In this study, we assessed kynurenine metabolites in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of Parkinson's disease patients and controls. Parkinson patients (nÂ =Â 26) were clinically assessed for severity of motor symptoms (UPDRS) and L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (UDysRS). Plasma and cerebrospinal fluid samples were collected after overnight fasting and 1-2Â h after intake of L-DOPA or other anti-Parkinson medication. Metabolites were analyzed in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of controls (nÂ =Â 14), Parkinson patients receiving no L-DOPA (nÂ =Â 8), patients treated with L-DOPA without dyskinesia (nÂ =Â 8), and patients with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia (nÂ =Â 10) using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. We observed approximately fourfold increase in the 3-hydroxykynurenine/kynurenic acid ratio in plasma of Parkinson's patients with L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Anthranilic acid levels were decreased in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of this patient group. 5-Hydroxytryptophan levels were twofold increased in all L-DOPA-treated Parkinson's patients. We conclude that a higher 3-hydroxykynurenine/kynurenic acid ratio in plasma may serve as a biomarker for L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia. Longitudinal studies including larger patients cohorts are needed to verify whether the changes observed here may serve as a prognostic marker for L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia.

Low dose ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, shows potential for a more rapid antidepressant effect, with efficacy also evident in previously treatment-resistant populations. However, a greater understanding of the physiological mechanisms underlying such effects is required. We assessed the potential impact of ketamine infusion on neurobiological drivers of kynurenine pathway metabolism in major depression (HPA axis hyperactivity, inflammation) in patients with treatment-resistant depression compared to gender-matched healthy controls. Furthermore, we assessed these biomarkers before and after electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is currently the gold standard for management of treatment-resistant depression. As previously demonstrated, treatment with ketamine and ECT was associated with improved depressive symptoms in patients. At baseline, waking cortisol output was greater in the ECT cohort, kynurenine was greater in the ketamine cohort, and kynurenic acid was lower in patients compared to healthy controls, although inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 or IFN-Î³) were similar in patients and controls. Furthermore, in patients who responded to ECT, the cortisol awakening response was decreased following treatment. Despite a trend towards reduced kynurenine concentrations in those who responded to ketamine, ketamine was not associated with significant alterations in any of the biomarkers assessed.

Segregated into at least two distinct branches, often termed the âneurotoxicâ and âneuroprotectiveâ arms of the KP, they are regulated by the two enzymes kynurenine 3-monooxygenase and kynurenine aminotransferase, respectively. Interestingly, several enzymes in the pathway are under tight control of inflammatory mediators. Recent years have seen a tremendous increase in our understanding of neuroinflammation in CNS disease. This review will focus on the regulation of the KP by inflammatory mediators as it pertains to neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders.

Our previous work has shown that prenatal inhibition of the pathway produces abnormalities of brain development. In the present study kynurenine and probenecid (both 100Â mg/kg, doses known to increase kynurenic acid levels in the brain) were administered to female Wistar rats on embryonic days E14, E16 and E18 of gestation and the litter was allowed to develop to post-natal day P60. Western blotting revealed no changes in hippocampal expression of several proteins previously found to be altered by inhibition of the kynurenine pathway including the NMDA receptor subunits GluN1, GluN2A and GluN2B, as well as doublecortin, Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA), sonic hedgehog and unco-ordinated (unc)-5H1 and 5H3. Mice lacking the enzyme kynurenine-3-monoxygenase (KMO) also showed no changes in hippocampal expression of several of these proteins or the 70-kDa and 100-kDa variants of Disrupted in Schizophrenia-1 (DISC1). Electrical excitability of pyramidal neurons in the CA1 region of hippocampal slices was unchanged, as was paired-pulse facilitation and inhibition. Long-term potentiation was decreased in the kynurenine-treated rats and in the KMO(â/â) mice, but galantamine reversed this effect in the presence of nicotinic receptor antagonists, consistent with evidence that it can potentiate glutamate at NMDA receptors. It is concluded that interference with the kynurenine pathway in utero can have lasting effects on brain function of the offspring, implying that the kynurenine pathway is involved in the regulation of early brain development.

The serotonergic pathway highlights the primary (endogenous) psychiatric disorders. The up-regulation of the kynurenine pathway by physical illnesses can cause neuropathic and immunological disorders1 associated with secondary neuropsychiatric symptoms. Tryptophan and nicotinamide deficiencies fall within the protein energy malnutrition (PEM) spectrum. They can arise if the kynurenine pathway is stressed by primary or secondary inflammatory conditions and the consequent imbalance of available catabolic/anabolic substrates may adversely influence convalescent phase efficiency. The replacement of depleted or reduced NAD+ levels and other cofactors can perhaps improve the clinical management of these disorders. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and fibromyalgia (FM) appear to meet the criteria of a tryptophan-kynurenine pathway disorder with potential neuroimmunological sequelae. Aspects of some of the putative precipitating factors have been previously outlined.2,3 An analysis of the areas of metabolic dysfunction will focus on future directions for research and management.

It is increasingly recognized as playing a major role in the pathogenesis of a wide variety of inflammatory, neurodegenerative and malignant disorders. However, the temporal dynamics of kynurenine pathway activation and metabolite production in human immune cells is currently unknown. Here we report the novel use of flow cytometry, combined with ultra high-performance liquid chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, to sensitively quantify the intracellular expression of three key kynurenine pathway enzymes and the main kynurenine pathway metabolites in a time-course study. This is the first study to show that up-regulation of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO-1), kynurenine 3-monoxygenase (KMO) and quinolinate phosphoribosyltransferase (QPRT) is lacking in lymphocytes treated with interferon gamma. In contrast, peripheral monocytes showed a significant elevation of kynurenine pathway enzymes and metabolites when treated with interferon gamma. Expression of IDO-1, KMO and QPRT correlated significantly with activation of the kynurenine pathway (kynurenine:tryptophan ratio), quinolinic acid concentration and production of the monocyte derived, pro-inflammatory immune response marker: neopterin. Our results also describe an original and sensitive methodological approach to quantify kynurenine pathway enzyme expression in cells. This has revealed further insights into the potential role of these enzymes in disease processes.\n\nKynurenine Pathway Metabolism is Involved in the Maintenance of the Intracellular NAD+ Concentration in Human Primary Astrocytes\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGrant, Ross; Nguyen, Susan; Guillemin, Gilles\n\n2010-01-01\n\nEfficient synthesis of NAD+ is critical to maintaining cell viability in all organs of the body. However, little is known of the pathway(s) by which cells of the central nervous system produce NAD+. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship, between tryptophan degradation via the kynurenine pathway (KP) and de novo NAD+ synthesis in human astrocytes, a major cell type within the brain. In this study we observed that inhibition of single enzymes of the KP resulted in significant decreases in NAD+ levels in astroglial cells after a 24 hr period. We also observed that astrocytes cultured in media deficient in tryptophan, nicotinic acid and nicotinamide resulted in a 50% decrease in NAD+ levels after 24 hrs. This decrease in NAD+ was partially restored by supplementation of the culture media with either tryptophan or kynurenine, or nicotinic acid or with supply of the salvage pathway precursor nicotinamide.

There were significant increases in the levels of kynurenine, kynurenic acid, anthranilic acid and 3-hydroxy-kynurenine (3-HK) in the maternal brain after 5Â h but not 24Â h, while the embryos exhibited high levels of kynurenine, kynurenic acid and anthranilic acid after 5Â h which were maintained at 24Â h post-treatment. At 24Â h there was also a strong trend to an increase in quinolinic acid levels (PÂ =Â 0.055). No significant changes were observed in any of the other kynurenine metabolites. The results confirm the marked increase in the accumulation of some neuroactive kynurenines when KMO is inhibited, and re-emphasise the potential importance of changes in anthranilic acid. The prolonged duration of metabolite accumulation in the embryo brains indicates a trapping of compounds within the embryonic CNS independently of maternal levels. When brains were examined from young mice heterozygous for the meCP2 gene - a potential model for Rett syndrome - no differences were noted from control mice, suggesting that the proposed roles for kynurenines in autism spectrum disorder are not relevant to Rett syndrome, supporting its recognition as a distinct, independent, condition.

Although physically segregated, both enzymes use the pivotal kynurenine pathway metabolite L-kynurenine as a substrate. We studied the functional consequences of this cellular compartmentalization in vivo using two specific tools, the KAT II inhibitor BFF 122 and the KMO inhibitor UPF 648. The acute effects of selective KAT II or KMO inhibition were studied using a radiotracing method in which the de novo synthesis of KYNA, and of 3-HK and its downstream metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN), is monitored following an intrastriatal injection of 3H-kynurenine. In naÃ¯ve rats, intrastriatal BFF 122 decreased newly formed KYNA by 66%, without influencing 3-HK or QUIN production. Conversely, UPF 648 reduced 3-HK synthesis (by 64%) without affecting KYNA formation. Similar, selective effects of KAT II and KMO inhibition were observed when the inhibitors were applied acutely together with the excitotoxin QUIN, which impairs local KP metabolism. Somewhat different effects of KMO (but not KAT II) inhibition were obtained in rats that had received an intrastriatal QUIN injection 7 days earlier. In these neuron-depleted striata, UPF 648 not only decreased both 3-HK and QUIN production (by 77% and 66%, respectively) but also moderately raised KYNA synthesis (by 27%). These results indicate a remarkable functional segregation of the two pathway branches in the brain, boding well for the development of selective KAT II or KMO inhibitors for cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection, respectively.

It prevents the accumulation of quinolinic acid (QA) and helps in the maintenance of basal Trp-niacin ratio. To assess the structure based inhibitory action of PAEs such as DMP, DEP, DBP, DIBP, DEHP and their metabolites, these were docked into the active site cavity of hACMSD. Docking results show that the binding affinities of PAEs lie in the comparable range (-4.9 kca/mol-7.48kcal/mol) with Dipicolinic acid (-6.21kcal/mol), a substrate analogue of hACMSD. PAEs interact with the key residues such as Arg47 and Trp191 and lie within the 4Ã vicinity of zinc metal at the active site of hACMSD. Dynamics and stability of the PAEs-hACMSD complexes were determined by performing molecular dynamics simulations using GROMACS 5.14. Binding free energy calculations of the PAEs-hACMSD complexes were estimated by using MMPBSA method. The results emphasize that PAEs can structurally mimic the binding pattern of tryptophan metabolites to hACMSD, which further leads to inhibition of its activity and accumulation of the quinolate in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism.

Despite the research efforts, its exact pathomechanism is not fully revealed, but evidence points to the role of glutamate and its receptors. Kynurenic acid is an endogenous glutamate receptor antagonist produced by the kynurenine pathway (KP). Tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) and indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) convert l-tryptophan to N-formyl-l-kynurenine, to be further transformed to l-kynurenine. Kynurenine aminotransferase-II (KAT-II), l-kynurenine hydrolase (KYNU), and l-kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO) are key enzymes in the later steps of the KP. Nitroglycerin (NTG) administration serves as both human and animal model of migraine, causing the activation and sensitization in the trigeminal system. A previous study demonstrated a reduction of KAT-II expression following NTG administration in animals. The goal of current tests was to identify the potential modulatory effect of NTG on other metabolizing enzymes of the KP in the caudal trigeminal nucleus (TNC) of rats. Four hours following the intraperitoneal injection of NTG (10âmg/kg), the rats were perfused transcardially and the TNC was extracted for Western blotting. Western blot studies revealed that the expression of TDO2, IDO1, KYNU, and KMO decreased in the TNC. The results demonstrated that NTG is able to downregulate the KP, with a potential influence on the glutamatergic system as well, contributing to the development of trigeminal activation and sensitization in animals.

The results demonstrated that NTG is able to downregulate the KP, with a potential influence on the glutamatergic system as well, contributing to the development of trigeminal activation and sensitization in animals.\n\nThe kynurenine pathway is activated in human obesity and shifted toward kynurenine monooxygenase activation.\n\nPubMed\n\nFavennec, Marie; Hennart, Benjamin; Caiazzo, Robert; Leloire, Audrey; Yengo, LoÃ¯c; Verbanck, Marie; Arredouani, Abdelilah; Marre, Michel; Pigeyre, Marie; Bessede, Alban; Guillemin, Gilles J; Chinetti, Giulia; Staels, Bart; Pattou, FranÃ§ois; Balkau, Beverley; Allorge, Delphine; Froguel, Philippe; Poulain-Godefroy, Odile\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThis study characterized the kynurenine pathway (KP) in human obesity by evaluating circulating levels of kynurenines and the expression of KP enzymes in adipose tissue. Tryptophan and KP metabolite levels were measured in serum of individuals from the D.E.S.I.R. cohort (case-cohort study: 212 diabetic, 836 randomly sampled) and in women with obesity, diabetic or normoglycemic, from the ABOS cohort (n = 100). KP enzyme gene expressions were analyzed in omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue of women from the ABOS cohort, in human primary adipocytes and in monocyte-derived macrophages. In the D.E.S.I.R. cohort, kynurenine levels were positively associated with body mass index (BMI) (P = 4.68 Ã 10(-19) ) and with a higher HOMA2-IR insulin resistance index (P = 6.23 Ã 10(-4) ). The levels of kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and quinolinic acid were associated with higher BMI (P < 0.05). The expression of several KP enzyme genes (indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 [IDO1], kynureninase [KYNU], kynurenine 3-monooxygenase [KMO], and kynurenine aminotransferase III [CCBL2]) was increased in the omental adipose tissue of women with obesity compared to lean (P < 0.05), and their expression was induced by proinflammatory cytokines in human primary adipocytes (P < 0.05), except for KMO that is not expressed in these cells. The expressions of IDO1, KYNU, KMO, and CCBL2 were higher in proinflammatory than in anti-inflammatory macrophages (P < 0.05). In the context of obesity, the presence of macrophages in adipose tissue may contribute to diverting KP toward KMO activation.

To explore this role in greater detail, we generated mice with a targeted genetic disruption of Kmo and present here the first biochemical and neurochemical characterization of these mutant animals. Kmo(-/-) mice lacked KMO activity but showed no obvious abnormalities in the activity of four additional KP enzymes tested. As expected, Kmo(-/-) mice showed substantial reductions in the levels of its enzymatic product, 3-hydroxykynurenine, in liver, brain, and plasma. Compared with wild-type animals, the levels of the downstream metabolite quinolinic acid were also greatly decreased in liver and plasma of the mutant mice but surprisingly were only slightly reduced (by â¼20%) in the brain. The levels of three other KP metabolites: kynurenine, kynurenic acid, and anthranilic acid, were substantially, but differentially, elevated in the liver, brain, and plasma of Kmo(-/-) mice, whereas the liver and brain content of the major end product of the enzymatic cascade, NAD(+), did not differ between Kmo(-/-) and wild-type animals. When assessed by in vivo microdialysis, extracellular kynurenic acid levels were found to be significantly elevated in the brains of Kmo(-/-) mice. Taken together, these results provide further evidence that KMO plays a key regulatory role in the KP and indicate that Kmo(-/-) mice will be useful for studying tissue-specific functions of individual KP metabolites in health and disease.\n\nKynurenine 3-Monooxygenase: An Influential Mediator of Neuropathology.\n\nPubMed\n\nParrott, Jennifer M; O'Connor, Jason C\n\n2015-01-01\n\nMounting evidence demonstrates that kynurenine metabolism may play an important pathogenic role in the development of multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders.

The goal of this study was to examine the production of kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK) and the expression of kynurenine pathway enzymes involved in their synthesis and metabolism in cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from patients with bipolar disorder, schizophrenia or from healthy control individuals. The assessment was performed under basal conditions or following treatment with interferon (IFN)-Î³, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-Î±, interleukin (IL)-1Î², IL-6, or their combinations, in cells exposed to exogenous kynurenine. In both groups of patients, the baseline production of KYNA and 3-HK was increased, as compared to control subjects. Case-treatment analyses revealed significant interactions between bipolar case status and IL-1Î², IL-6, IFN-Î³ + TNF-Î±, or IFN-Î³ + IL-1Î², as well as between schizophrenia case status and IL-1Î², IFN-Î³ + TNF-Î±, or IFN-Î³ + IL-1Î², in terms of higher 3-HK. Noteworthy, no case-treatment interactions in terms of KYNA production were found. Observed changes did not appear to correlate with the expression of genes encoding kynurenine aminotransferases (KATs), kynureninase (KYNU) or kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO). The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs1053230 and rs2275163, in KMO influenced KYNA levels yet did not explain the case-treatment discrepancies. In conclusion, our present findings indicate the utility of skin-derived fibroblasts for kynurenines research and support the concept of kynurenine pathway alterations in bipolar disorder and schizophrenia. The increase in ratio between neurotoxic 3-HK and neuroinhibitory/neuroprotective KYNA following exposure to cytokines may account for altered neurogenesis and structural abnormalities characteristic for both diseases.

It is the primary route for tryptophan catabolism in the liver and the starting point for the synthesis of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide in mammals. Dysregulation or overactivation of this pathway can lead to immune system activation and accumulation of potentially neurotoxic compounds. These aspects make the kynurenine pathway a promising target for therapeutic development to treat inflammation and some diseases with neurological aspects, especially in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy. PMID:26004930\n\nOn the relationship between the two branches of the kynurenine pathway in the rat brain in vivo.\n\nPubMed\n\nAmori, Laura; Guidetti, Paolo; Pellicciari, Roberto; Kajii, Yasushi; Schwarcz, Robert\n\n2009-04-01\n\nIn the mammalian brain, kynurenine aminotransferase II (KAT II) and kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO), key enzymes of the kynurenine pathway (KP) of tryptophan degradation, form the neuroactive metabolites kynurenic acid (KYNA) and 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), respectively. Although physically segregated, both enzymes use the pivotal KP metabolite l-kynurenine as a substrate. We studied the functional consequences of this cellular compartmentalization in vivo using two specific tools, the KAT II inhibitor BFF 122 and the KMO inhibitor UPF 648. The acute effects of selective KAT II or KMO inhibition were studied using a radiotracing method in which the de novo synthesis of KYNA, and of 3-HK and its downstream metabolite quinolinic acid (QUIN), is monitored following an intrastriatal injection of (3)H-kynurenine. In naÃ¯ve rats, intrastriatal BFF 122 decreased newly formed KYNA by 66%, without influencing 3-HK or QUIN production. Conversely, UPF 648 reduced 3-HK synthesis (by 64%) without affecting KYNA formation. Similar, selective effects of KAT II and KMO inhibition were observed when the inhibitors were applied acutely together with the excitotoxin QUIN, which impairs local KP metabolism. Somewhat different effects of KMO (but not KAT II) inhibition were obtained in rats that had received an intrastriatal QUIN injection 7 days earlier. In these neuron-depleted striata, UPF 648 not only decreased both 3-HK and QUIN production (by 77% and 66%, respectively) but also moderately raised KYNA synthesis (by 27%). These results indicate a remarkable functional segregation of the two pathway branches in the brain, boding well for the development of selective KAT II or KMO inhibitors for cognitive enhancement and neuroprotection, respectively.\n\nA single-run liquid chromatography mass spectrometry method to quantify neuroactive kynurenine pathway metabolites in rat plasma.\n\nPubMed\n\nOrsatti, Laura; Speziale, Roberto; Orsale, Maria Vittoria; Caretti, Fulvia; Veneziano, Maria; Zini, Matteo; Monteagudo, Edith; Lyons, Kathryn; Beconi, Maria; Chan, Kelvin; Herbst, Todd; Toledo-Sherman, Leticia; Munoz-Sanjuan, Ignacio; Bonelli, Fabio; Dominguez, Celia\n\n2015-03-25\n\nNeuroactive metabolites in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan catabolism are associated with neurodegenerative disorders. Tryptophan is transported across the blood-brain barrier and converted via the kynurenine pathway to N-formyl-L-kynurenine, which is further degraded to L-kynurenine. This metabolite can then generate a group of metabolites called kynurenines, most of which have neuroactive properties. The association of tryptophan catabolic pathway alterations with various central nervous system (CNS) pathologies has raised interest in analytical methods to accurately quantify kynurenines in body fluids. We here describe a rapid and sensitive reverse-phase HPLC-MS/MS method to quantify L-kynurenine (KYN), kynurenic acid (KYNA), 3-hydroxy-L-kynurenine (3HK) and anthranilic acid (AA) in rat plasma. Our goal was to quantify these metabolites in a single run; given their different physico-chemical properties, major efforts were devoted to develop a chromatography suitable for all metabolites that involves plasma protein precipitation with acetonitrile followed by chromatographic separation by C18 RP chromatography, detected by electrospray mass spectrometry. Quantitation range was 0.098-100 ng/ml for 3HK, 9.8-20,000 ng/ml for KYN, 0.49-1000 ng/ml for KYNA and AA. The method was linear (r>0.9963) and validation parameters were within acceptance range (calibration standards and QC accuracy within Â±30%). Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

This stimulation induces indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme that reduces the tryptophan bioavailability to synthesize serotonin. IDO products, kynurenine metabolites, exert neurotoxic/neuroprotective actions through glutamate receptors. Thus, we study elements of these pathways linked to kynurenine metabolite activity examining whether antidepressants (ADs) can modulate them. Male Wistar rats were exposed to chronic mild stress (CMS), and some of them were treated with ADs. The expression of elements of the IDO pathway, including kynurenine metabolites, and their possible modulation by ADs was studied in the frontal cortex (FC). CMS increased IDO expression in FC compared to control group, and ADs restored the IDO expression levels to control values. CMS-induced IDO expression led to increased levels of the excitotoxic quinolinic acid (QUINA) compared to control, and ADs prevented the rise in such levels. Neither CMS nor ADs changed significantly the antiexcitotoxic kynurenic acid (KYNA) levels. The QUINA/KYNA ratio, calculated as excitotoxicity risk indicator, increased after CMS and ADs prevented this increase. CMS lowered excitatory amino acid transporter (EAAT)-1 and EAAT-4 expression, and some ADs restored their expression levels. Furthermore, CMS decreased N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)-2A and 2B protein expression, and ADs mitigated this decrease. Our research examines the link between CMS-induced pro-inflammatory cytokines and the kynurenine pathway; it shows that CMS alters the kynurenine pathway in rat FC. Importantly, it also reveals the ability of classic ADs to prevent potentially harmful situations related to the brain scenario caused by CMS.\n\nEmbryo yolk sac membrane kynurenine formamidase of l-tryptophan to NAD+ pathway as a primary target for organophosphorus insecticides (OPI) in OPI-induced NAD-associated avian teratogenesis.\n\nPubMed\n\nSeifert, Josef\n\n2017-10-01\n\nThe objective of this study was to provide in ovo evidence for the proposed role of kynurenine formamidase of l-tryptophan to NAD + pathway in embryo yolk sac membranes as a primary target for organophosphorus insecticide (OPI) teratogens in OPI-induced NAD-associated avian teratogenesis. Slices prepared from yolk sac membranes or embryo livers of chicken eggs treated with the OPI dicrotophos and/or methyl parathion were incubated with l-tryptophan. Yolk sac membrane slices metabolized l-tryptophan in the pathway to NAD + before that function was established in livers. OPI interfered in ovo with the second step of l-tryptophan to NAD + biosynthesis by inhibiting kynurenine formamidase. Its inhibition due to the teratogen dicrotophos occurred in yolk sac membranes during the period of embryo highest susceptibility to OPI teratogens in contrast to delayed and lower inhibition caused by the nonteratogen methyl parathion. Both OPI affected liver kynurenine formamidase in a similar manner. The onsets of liver enzyme inhibition, however, were delayed by about two days and occurred at the time of the reduced embryo susceptibility to teratogens. The early disruption of l-tryptophan metabolism and higher inhibition of kynurenine formamidase in yolk sac membranes may be the factors that determine action of OPI as teratogens in chicken embryos.

We hypothesized that concussed football players would have elevated plasma levels of neurotoxic kynurenine metabolites and reduced levels of neuroprotective metabolites relative to healthy football players and that altered kynurenine levels would correlate with post-concussion mood symptoms. Mood scales and plasma concentrations of kynurenine metabolites were assessed in concussed (N=18; 1.61 days post-injury) and healthy football players (N=18). A subset of football players returned at 1-week (N=14; 9.29 days) and 1-month post-concussion (N=14, 30.93 days). Concussed athletes had significantly elevated levels of quinolinic acid (QUIN) and significantly lower ratios of kynurenic acid (KYNA) to QUIN at all time points compared with healthy athletes (p's<0.05), with no longitudinal evidence of normalization of KYNA or KYNA/QUIN. At 1-day post-injury, concussed athletes with lower levels of the putatively neuroprotective KYNA/QUIN ratio reported significantly worse depressive symptoms (p=0.04), and a trend toward worse anxiety symptoms (p=0.06), while at 1-month higher QUIN levels were associated with worse mood symptoms (p's<0.01). Finally, concussed athletes with worse concussion outcome, defined as number of days until return-to-play, had higher QUIN and lower KYNA/QUIN at 1-month post-injury (p's<0.05). These results converge with existing kynurenine literature on psychiatric patients and provide the first evidence of altered peripheral levels of kynurenine metabolites following sports-related concussion.

The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism includes the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid and the antagonist kynurenic acid. We now report that prenatal inhibition of the pathway in rats with 3,4-dimethoxy-N-[4-(3-nitrophenyl)thiazol-2-yl]benzenesulphonamide (Ro61-8048) produces marked changes in hippocampal neuron morphology, spine density and the immunocytochemical localisation of developmental proteins in the offspring at postnatal day 60. GolgiâCox silver staining revealed decreased overall numbers and lengths of CA1 basal dendrites and secondary basal dendrites, together with fewer basal dendritic spines and less overall dendritic complexity in the basal arbour. Fewer dendrites and less complexity were also noted in the dentate gyrus granule cells. More neurons containing the nuclear marker NeuN and the developmental protein sonic hedgehog were detected in the CA1 region and dentate gyrus. Staining for doublecortin revealed fewer newly generated granule cells bearing extended dendritic processes. The number of neuron terminals staining for vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)-1 and VGLUT-2 was increased by Ro61-8048, with no change in expression of vesicular GABA transporter or its co-localisation with vesicle-associated membrane protein-1. These data support the view that constitutive kynurenine metabolism normally plays a role in early embryonic brain development, and that interfering with it has profound consequences for neuronal structure and morphology, lasting into adulthood.

There is substantial evidence that the kynurenine pathway (KP) plays a role in the normal physiology of the brain and is involved in the pathology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington's disease and Parkinson's disease (PD). Objective. We set out to investigate the potential roles in PD of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from one of the key enzymes of the KP, kynurenine 3-monooxygenase (KMO). Methods. 105 unrelated, clinically definitive PD patients and 131 healthy controls were enrolled to investigate the possible effects of the different alleles of KMO. Fluorescently labeled TaqMan probes were used for allele discrimination. Results. None of the four investigated SNPs proved to be associated with PD or influenced the age at onset of the disease. Conclusions. The genetic link between the KP and PD is still missing. The investigated SNPs presumably do not appear to influence the function of KMO and probably do not contain binding sites for regulatory proteins of relevance in PD.

Age-related changes of metabolites and activities of associated enzymes in this pathway are suggestable and would be potential intervention targets. Blood levels of serum tryptophan metabolites in C57BL/6 mice of different ages, ranging from 6 weeks to 10 months, were assessed using high-performance liquid chromatography, and the enzyme activities for each metabolic step were estimated using the ratio of appropriate metabolite levels. Mice were subjected to voluntary chronic aerobic exercise or high-fat diet to assess their ability to rescue age-related alterations in the kynurenine pathway. The ratio of serum kynurenic acid (KYNA) to 3-hydroxylkynurenine (3-HK) decreased with advancing age. Voluntary chronic aerobic exercise and high-fat diet rescued the decreased KYNA/3-HK ratio in the 6-month-old and 8-month-old mice groups. Tryptophan metabolites and their associated enzyme activities were significantly altered during aging, and the KYNA/3-HK ratio was a meaningful indicator of aging. Exercise and high-fat diet could potentially recover the reduction of the KYNA/3-HK ratio in the elderly.

The enzymes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-1 (IDO-1), indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase-2 (IDO-2) and tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO-2) initiate the first step of the KP. IDO-1 and TDO-2 induction in tumors are crucial mechanisms implicated to play pivotal roles in suppressing anti-tumor immunity. Here, we report the first comprehensive characterisation of the KP in 1) cultured human glioma cells and 2) plasma from patients with glioblastoma (GBM). Our data revealed that interferon-gamma (IFN-Î³) stimulation significantly potentiated the expression of the KP enzymes, IDO-1 IDO-2, kynureninase (KYNU), kynurenine hydroxylase (KMO) and significantly down-regulated 2-amino-3-carboxymuconate semialdehyde decarboxylase (ACMSD) and kynurenine aminotransferase-I (KAT-I) expression in cultured human glioma cells. This significantly increased KP activity but significantly lowered the KYNA/KYN neuroprotective ratio in human cultured glioma cells. KP activation (KYN/TRP) was significantly higher, whereas the concentrations of the neuroreactive KP metabolites TRP, KYNA, QUIN and PIC and the KYNA/KYN ratio were significantly lower in GBM patient plasma (nâ=â18) compared to controls. These results provide further evidence for the involvement of the KP in glioma pathophysiology and highlight a potential role of KP products as novel and highly attractive therapeutic targets to evaluate for the treatment of brain tumors, aimed at restoring anti-tumor immunity and reducing the capacity for malignant cells to produce NAD+, which is necessary for energy production and DNA repair.

It has been shown that kynurenine-3-monooxygenase (KMO) is indirectly involved in these products' formation. KMO polymorphic loci rs2275163 (C/T) and rs1053230 (A/G) were examined in 187 schizophrenia patients and 229 healthy subjects. A genetic combination of allele T and genotype GG was observed more often in a patient group compared with healthy controls (p = 0.003, OR 2.0 (95% CI 1.2-2.9). In the latter group, this combination was associated with schizophrenia endophenotype (p = 0.04), which manifested in a higher expression of schizotypal personality traits assessed using the MMPI test.\n\nTryptophan Metabolism in Rat Liver After Administration of Tryptophan, Kynurenine Metabolites, and Kynureninase Inhibitors.\n\nPubMed\n\nBadawy, Abdulla A-B; Bano, Samina\n\n2016-01-01\n\nRat liver tryptophan (Trp), kynurenine pathway metabolites, and enzymes deduced from product/substrate ratios were assessed following acute and/or chronic administration of kynurenic acid (KA), 3-hydroxykynurenine (3-HK), 3-hydroxyanthranilic acid (3-HAA), Trp, and the kynureni-nase inhibitors benserazide (BSZ) and carbidopa (CBD). KA activated Trp 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO), possibly by increasing liver 3-HAA, but inhibited kynurenine aminotransferase (KAT) and kynureninase activities with 3-HK as substrate. 3-HK inhibited kynureninase activity from 3-HK. 3-HAA stimulated TDO, but inhibited kynureninase activity from K and 3-HK. Trp (50 mg/kg) increased kynurenine metabolite concentrations and KAT from K, and exerted a temporary stimulation of TDO. The kynureninase inhibitors BSZ and CBD also inhibited KAT, but stimulated TDO. BSZ abolished or strongly inhibited the Trp-induced increases in liver Trp and kynurenine metabolites. The potential effects of these changes in conditions of immune activation, schizophrenia, and other disease states are discussed.\n\nTryptophan 2,3-Dioxygenfase and Indoleamine 2,3-Dioxygenase 1 Make Separate, Tissue-Specific Contributions to Basal and Inflammation-Induced Kynurenine Pathway Metabolism in Mice\n\nPubMed Central\n\nLarkin, Paul B.; Sathyasaikumar, Korrapati V.; Notarangelo, Francesca M.; Funakoshi, Hiroshi; Nakamura, Toshikazu; Schwarcz, Robert; Muchowski, Paul J.\n\n2018-01-01\n\nIn mammals, the majority of the essential amino acid tryptophan is degraded via the kynurenine pathway (KP). Several KP metabolites play distinct physiological roles, often linked to immune system functions, and may also be causally involved in human diseases including neurodegenerative disorders, schizophrenia and cancer. Pharmacological manipulation of the KP has therefore become an active area of drug development. To target the pathway effectively, it is important to understand how specific KP enzymes control levels of the bioactive metabolites in vivo. Here, we conducted a comprehensive biochemical characterization of mice with a targeted deletion of either tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase (TDO) or indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), the two initial rate-limiting enzymes of the KP. These enzymes catalyze the same reaction, but differ in biochemical characteristics and expression patterns. We measured KP metabolite levels and enzyme activities and expression in several tissues in basal and immune-stimulated conditions. Although our study revealed several unexpected downstream effects on KP metabolism in both knockout mice, the results were essentially consistent with TDO-mediated control of basal KP metabolism and a role of IDO in phenomena involving stimulation of the immune system.

The kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism includes the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid and the antagonist kynurenic acid. We now report that prenatal inhibition of the pathway in rats with 3,4-dimethoxy-N-[4-(3-nitrophenyl)thiazol-2-yl]benzenesulphonamide (Ro61-8048) produces marked changes in hippocampal neuron morphology, spine density and the immunocytochemical localisation of developmental proteins in the offspring at postnatal day 60. Golgi-Cox silver staining revealed decreased overall numbers and lengths of CA1 basal dendrites and secondary basal dendrites, together with fewer basal dendritic spines and less overall dendritic complexity in the basal arbour. Fewer dendrites and less complexity were also noted in the dentate gyrus granule cells. More neurons containing the nuclear marker NeuN and the developmental protein sonic hedgehog were detected in the CA1 region and dentate gyrus. Staining for doublecortin revealed fewer newly generated granule cells bearing extended dendritic processes. The number of neuron terminals staining for vesicular glutamate transporter (VGLUT)-1 and VGLUT-2 was increased by Ro61-8048, with no change in expression of vesicular GABA transporter or its co-localisation with vesicle-associated membrane protein-1. These data support the view that constitutive kynurenine metabolism normally plays a role in early embryonic brain development, and that interfering with it has profound consequences for neuronal structure and morphology, lasting into adulthood.

The preferred KMO substrate, kynurenine, is converted to 3-hydroxykynurenine (3HK), and this product exhibits cytotoxicity through mechanisms that culminate in apoptosis. Here, we report that overexpression of human KMO with orthotopic localisation to mitochondria creates a metabolic environment during which the cell exhibits increased tolerance for exogenous 3HK-mediated cellular injury. Using the selective KMO inhibitor Ro61-8048, we show that KMO enzyme function is essential for cellular protection"
