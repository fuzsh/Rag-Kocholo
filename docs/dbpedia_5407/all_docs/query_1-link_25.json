        "text": "Five years ago, UNCSA began its first major fundraising campaign in decades. With a lead gift from beloved Chancellor Emeritus Alex Ewing, Powering Creativity began quietly in 2016.\n\nLaunched publicly in September 2019, the campaign was the most ambitious fundraising initiative in UNCSA history. With a goal of $65 million, it was poised to make a transformative impact on students, faculty, staff, and the wider community.\n\nThanks to the generosity of thousands of supporters, Powering Creativity soared past its goal, and the funds received are already hard at work, helping our emerging artists reach new creative heights.\n\nVIEW THE CAMPAIGN IMPACT REPORT (PDF)\n\nPowering Creativity Donor List\n\nAlphabetical by last name"
