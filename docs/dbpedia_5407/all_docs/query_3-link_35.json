        "text": "3.1 Case 1–selective crystallization of lysozyme in a ternary protein solution\n\nAs a proof of concept, the PARAFAC model construction was first applied to UV/Vis spectral data of a phase transition process of a chemically defined system. In a system of three model proteins, the target molecule (Lys) was selectively crystallized in a HT screening with 96 different conditions. The other two species (CytC and RibA) are arbitrarily treated as contaminants and were preferred to stay in the supernatant to achieve a high Lys purity in the crystals. The supernatants of the screened conditions holding different protein-specific concentrations were UV/Vis-analyzed. The generated data was used for the model construction. The selected model required two PARAFAC components–one for the target molecule Lys, and the second one for clustering the contaminants.\n\nshows the PARAFAC-predicted single species time profiles compared to the measured absorbance of the initial material at the wavelength λ = 280 nm over time. The dashed and solid lines visualize the model-predicted data (right axis) and the measured data (left axis), respectively. This remains consistent throughout this research work. The predicted spectra of the two components are illustrated in in different colors for each species. As a reference, the pure Lys spectrum is included with solid lines for identification of the target molecule component. The predicted and measured Lys concentration of the supernatants of the screened conditions are depicted in . This plot illustrates the phase behavior of Lys in a phase diagram depending on the AMS and initial Lys concentration of the screened condition, and distinguishes between the supersaturation and stable area. The loading vectors in all three modes are unitless, and one component represents one species in each mode. The concentration of the contaminant species did not change (data not shown). The phase behavior of this HT screening is described and explained in detail by Wegner et al. (2022).\n\nThe time courses of the predicted two species match the position of the overall absorbance at λ = 280 nm of the analyzed initial material. Both predicted species demonstrate a similar flow behavior through the HPLC system during the no-column runs and resemble the Gaussian shape due to axial diffusion in the analysis system. The spectral prediction of the Lys component fits the measured spectrum of pure Lys, only the shoulder at λ = 290 nm is slightly less pronounced than in the measured spectrum. The predicted concentration loadings and measured concentrations overlay and indicate the saturation curve of the phase diagram clearly. This curve distinguishes the screened condition into the stable area showing no Lys concentration decline in the supernatant and the supersaturation area, in which the Lys concentration drops to the saturation curve, possibly due to crystallization.\n\nTo compare the predicted PARAFAC loadings and the measured reference data, depicts the model and measurement data sets in two ways. First, the data sets in show the predicted spectral loadings and measured species, similarly to , but with the spectra of all three model proteins (Lys, CytC, and RibA) present in the screening solutions. Second, the spectral data of the Lys species were mean-normalized to overcome the difference in axis scale. Finally, the data sets were plotted against each other and used for the coefficient of determination (R 2) and root mean squared error of prediction (RMSEP) calculation (see for the Lys spectrum and for the concentration comparison). is derived from the mean-normalized concentration data of . The RMSEP in this work is given without a unit as the variable is calculated from normalized values.\n\nThe RibA UV/Vis spectrum shows a noisy spectrum above 300 nm, which is a normalization artefact as the overall absorption of the pure RibA spectrum was low due to its low extinction coefficient and the measured concentration of 0.2 mg ml−1. It is visible that the predicted contaminant spectrum is similar to the pure CytC spectrum between 300–450 nm. According to the model, below 300 nm, the two contaminant species (CytC and RibA) do not contribute to the measured UV/Vis absorbance which differs from the measured pure species spectra. PARAFAC models with three components did not lead to reasonable models, so that the species RibA was not modeled as an own species due to its low contribution to the overall UV/Vis absorbance. However, RibA and CytC together can be clustered as impurities and can be described by one contaminant component as they demonstrate similar phase behavior.\n\nThe mean-normalized model prediction and the measured mean-normalized spectrum of pure Lys overlay as indicated by the high R 2 value. The Lys concentration loadings of the PARAFAC model are slightly underestimated at higher protein concentrations, which is quantified with a lower R 2.\n\n3.2 Case 2–selective precipitation of monoclonal antibodies in a complex solution\n\nAs the second case study, a mAb was selectively precipitated out of a clarified, complex solution (CCS) consisting of several different species. In total, 12 different precipitant concentrations were investigated, and the supernatants of the precipitation (S1), wash (S2), and redissolution (S3) process steps were UV/Vis-analyzed to finally construct a valid PARAFAC model.\n\nThe results of the constructed model with three different components are shown in . The three components could be identified as the mAb, contaminants, and AMS. The predicted time profiles of each component and the measured absorbance at λ = 280 nm are shown in . The predicted spectral profiles and the measured spectrum of purified mAb are depicted in . The predicted, specific concentration in the supernatant of precipitation ( ), wash (D), and redissolution process step (E) are colored according to the species. As a reference, the measured peak area of the mAbs and the contaminant are included in and represent the concentration profile throughout the investigated screening conditions.\n\nThe predicted time profiles in show a Gaussian curve for the contaminant species, two Gaussian curves for the AMS species, and an irregular profile for the mAb component resembling multiple overlaying species. The predicted AMS time profile overlaps with the measured time profiles of pure AMS solution measurements (see Supplementary Figure S1).\n\nThe predicted spectrum of the target molecule mAb fits the measured spectrum of protein A purified mAb (see ). The predicted concentration profile of the AMS during the precipitation and wash step agrees with the experimental AMS concentration as the precipitant concentration was linearly increased over the investigated conditions from 0 mol to 2 mol during the precipitation and wash process step (see Supplementary Figure S2). The predicted and the measured mAb concentrations in the precipitation supernatants decrease strongly above 1.2 mol AMS in and match the increase in mAb concentration in the redissolution solutions above the same AMS concentration in . The predicted and the measured contaminant concentrations behave likewise with a different threshold at 1.6 mol AMS. A slight increase in the mAb concentration at 1.6 mol AMS during the washing step is visible in the predicted and the measured data sets. A slight increase in the contaminant concentration with rising AMS concentration was only seen in the reference analytics and indicates contaminant removal during the wash step. The predicted mAb concentration in is overestimated at AMS concentration between 0 and 0.4 mol AMS whereas the contaminant concentration is underestimated. Similarly, the behavior of overestimated mAb and underestimated contaminant concentrations is visible in the redissolution samples at higher AMS screening conditions in .\n\nTo further validate the constructed PARAFAC model, comparisons of the predicted loadings, and measured data of the mAb spectrum and concentration are illustrated in . The predicted spectral loadings of the mAb and the predicted contaminant are shown in , as well as the spectrum of the initial contaminants, present in the precipitation supernatant, and of the co-precipitated contaminants, which are still present after redissolution. The initial contaminants, which are present in large excess and remain in solution despite the presence of the precipitant AMS, are well described by the blue contaminant component of the PARAFAC model. The co-precipitated contaminants could not be described by the model as these contaminants underwent phase transition at similar precipitant concentration as the target molecule. The mean-normalized, predicted spectral loadings and the measured spectrum of the mAb species are depicted in and agreed as indicated by the R 2 value of 97.38% and a low RMSEP of 0.009.\n\nTo further visualize the model agreement, the predicted, mean-normalized concentration loadings and measured peak area of the mAb are shown during the different process steps in with their process-specific R 2 and RMSEP values. The concentration loadings show moderate agreement with the measured data for the precipitation and wash step samples. In the precipitation supernatant analysis, the presence of the different contaminants at high mAb concentration (especially at lower AMS concentration) might be the cause. The wash step analysis samples showed very low mAb concentration except for one outlier. The lowest R 2 and the highest RMSEP values among the investigated process steps might be caused by a mathematical artefact and the outlier. The high R 2 and low RMSEP values for the precipitation and redissolution supernatant indicate that the model could produce valid mAb concentrations.\n\n3.3 Case 3–selective precipitation of virus-like particles in a complex solution\n\nThe third case study dealt with the selective precipitation of VLPs in E.coli lysate. In line with the second case study, a screening was performed over different precipitant concentrations, and the UV/Vis-analyzed precipitation (S1), wash (S2), and redissolution step (S3) supernatants were used to construct a PARAFAC model.\n\nThe results of the constructed model with three different components are shown in . The three components are identified as the VLPs and two contaminant clusters.\n\nThe time profiles in show a flat, broad peak for the VLP species. The calculation of the second derivative of the spectra along the wavelength dimension improved the model validity (data not shown). The second spectral derivative of a reference spectrum of purified VLPs validated the spectral PARAFAC loadings (see ). The reference data illustrate how well the peak position is found by the PARAFAC model estimation of the spectra. The concentration loadings of the different species during the precipitation, wash, and redissolution process step are depicted in , respectively. The VLP species concentration decreases with rising AMS concentration above 1 mol concentration and approaches a limit (see ). The VLP concentration loadings of the redissolution step show the inverse behavior above the same threshold (see ). The first contaminant cluster shows a similar behavior above 1.5 mol AMS with a higher limit in the precipitation solutions and a lower limit during the redissolution step. Presumably, this contaminant cluster precipitates to the solubility line above the threshold. During redissolution, the precipitate of screened conditions with high AMS concentration is redissolved. The AMS concentration does not strongly affect the concentration loadings of the second contaminant cluster in the precipitation solutions, but the concentration loadings of this component increase slightly to a limit in the redissolution solutions. The second contaminant cluster represents species that are stable at higher AMS concentration. Similar results were achieved by Hillebrandt et al. (2020) for a chimeric VLP construct. The concentration loadings during the wash step show no significant increase in the VLPs and the first contaminant cluster. The second contaminant cluster shows a slight concentration loadings increase and is probably washed out of the precipitate with the rising AMS concentration.\n\nScanned SDS-PAGE gels of the precipitation and redissolution step are included in the Supplementary Material (see Supplementary Figure S3) analyzing the conditions between 0 mol and 1.27 mol and 2 mol AMS concentration. The findings on the concentration profile of the predicted species match the scanned gel of the reference SDS-PAGE analysis (see Supplementary Figure S3).\n\nThe similarity between the predicted and measured second derivative of the VLP spectrum is visible in The estimated wavelength position of the peak maxima and minima fits the measured data in the wavelength range below 265 nm and above 275 nm, but the absolute values at the peak maxima and minima do not overlay. Between the mentioned wavelengths, the curve characteristics of the predicted spectral loadings show a flattened curve and differ from the measured data. The absolute values at the peak maxima and minima do not overlay.\n\nThis may be the result of the applied preprocessing techniques as smoothing can eliminate or broaden peaks, whereas the spectral derivative calculation is sensitive to subtle differences in spectra.\n\nTo visualize the fit of the predicted to the measured data, the mean-normalized predicted VLP loadings and the second derivative data of a measured VLP spectrum are plotted against each other in and used for the calculation of R 2 and RMSEP values. Closer to the center, the predicted data overlay strongly with the measured data. At the boundaries of the spectral loadings, the predicted and the measured data differ more. Still, the spectral loadings showed a high R 2, but the highest RMSEP for the spectral regression among the three investigated case studies.\n\n4.1 PARAFAC model choice\n\nA PARAFAC model can decompose a data set into the signal contribution of each species if the experimental data set has a truly trilinear structure (Bro, 1997; Anzardi et al., 2021). In the case of spectral data sets, this means that an experimental data set can estimate e.g., the spectrum and concentration profile of each species present. Considering the physical logic that the spectra and concentration profiles are positive, the non-negativity constraints can be included in the calculation of chemometric models. This is a common practice to find stable, correct multi-way chemometric models during model calculation (Bro, 1997; Ebrahimi et al., 2008; Murphy et al., 2013; Steiner-Browne et al., 2019; Van Benthem et al., 2020).\n\nStill, valid PARAFAC models can only be constructed if the appropriate number of components (Andersen and Bro, 2003; Bro and Kiers, 2003; Ortiz et al., 2015), preprocessing techniques, and suitable model calculation parameters are used.\n\nIn the case of biological, complex solutions containing several different species, the requirement of an appropriate number of PARAFAC components imposes a problem for the model calculation. As not every single UV/Vis-absorbing species can be described by one model component, the different species need to be categorized in clusters. These clusters are formed on the basis of their similar phase behaviors among the species and shall be described by one PARAFAC component accepting inaccuracies in the spectral prediction. This simplification of the variety of species to several clusters introduces an error into the model. However, if the target molecule undergoes a phase transition and contributes strongly to the measured spectral data set, the focus of the PARAFAC models is to find the target molecule in any phase behavior screening study. Further strategies (Smilde et al., 2004) to determine the correct number of PARAFAC components are e.g., half-splitting and comparing the experiments (Bro, 1997), evaluating residuals (Smilde and Doornbos, 1992; Bro, 1997), and the CORCONDIA value (Bro and Kiers, 2003). More information on finding suitable preprocessing (Bro, 1998; Bro and Smilde, 2003) and model calculation parameters (Bro, 1997; Murphy et al., 2013) can be found elsewhere.\n\nIn crystallization or precipitation screenings, it can be expected that the protein concentration decreases to the solubility line with increasing precipitant or protein concentration due to the decreased protein solubility, which results in protein crystallization (Asherie, 2004; Baumgartner et al., 2015) or precipitation (Wingfield, 1998; Burgess, 2009; Watanabe et al., 2009). In the case of selective crystallization or precipitation processes, the phase behavior is protein-specific and can be used for protein purification. This theoretical process knowledge can be included in the choice of the PARAFAC model.\n\nThe spectral data set for the first case study was recorded for a HT-selective crystallization screening of Lys in a ternary protein system. In total, 96 conditions were screened varying the initial Lys concentration and precipitant concentration. The initial concentrations of the two other proteins (RibA, CytC) were maintained constant in all screened conditions. As the calculation of PARAFAC models with three components did not lead to a robust model, a model with two components was calculated (see ). Evaluating , one component can be identified as the target molecule Lys; the other one as a contaminant cluster resembling mainly CytC. It is assumed that the absorbance contribution of the third species RibA is built into a contaminant cluster (Yang et al., 2015), and that this third species is not described as a single model component. It contributes to a smaller extent to the UV/Vis spectra due to the lower extinction coefficient in the investigated wavelength range (3.8 and 2.8 times lower at 280 nm than for Lys and CytC) and lower concentration (up to 7.5 times lower than the Lys concentration). Furthermore, the protein concentrations of CytC and RibA do not change during the screening, contrary to the target protein Lys (see Wegner et al. (2022) for further explanation). As a consequence, the model cannot distinguish species demonstrating similar phase behavior. This shows that low-absorbing species are difficult to describe with an own model component, and that species with similar phase behavior can be clustered justifying species clustering in screenings with complex solutions.\n\nThe selective precipitation study of mAbs leads to a spectral data set, which can be described by a PARAFAC model with three model components (see ). One component represents the target molecule mAb, the other two the AMS concentration and a contaminant cluster. The time profile of the mAb component in may be caused by the changing light refraction when a solution with a high AMS passes the detector (see Subchapter 4.2). Another possible source could be different product-related impurities, e.g., aggregates, fragments, as they would show a mAb resembling spectrum, but different retention times in the analysis system due to diffusion. Below the AMS concentration of 0.5 mol the mAb species is overestimated and the contaminant cluster is underestimated by the PARAFAC model in . In , the two model components show the same effects above 1.4 mol AMS. A possible explanation of these contrasting model discrepancies of the measured to the predicted data is that the predicted mAb UV/Vis spectrum is overestimated below 270 nm leading to inverse effects on the concentration loadings of the mAb and contaminant component. As a result, the spectral loadings of the contaminants may be incorporated in the predicted mAb spectrum and distort the concentration loadings of both species–the target molecule and the contaminant cluster. This effect is more pronounced at higher absorbance values and thus higher protein concentrations.\n\nThe protein A chromatography gave further information on the composition of the contaminants during the precipitation, wash, and redissolution step. provides information on the main contaminant cluster during the precipitation and during the redissolution step. This means that the co-precipitated contaminant cluster during redissolution cannot be distinguished from the target molecule.\n\nThe PARAFAC model of the selective VLP precipitation HT screening could be calculated with three model components (see ). One component describes the VLP species while the other two describe two contaminant clusters. Assessing the concentration loadings of all three PARAFAC components in , the predicted species show different phase behaviors with increasing precipitant concentration. This enables the use of a selective VLP precipitation step for purification. Regarding the screened redissolution samples in , the predicted concentration loadings of the VLPs and first contaminant cluster increase above the same precipitation threshold in . The second contaminant cluster shows a slight concentration increase at higher precipitant concentration meaning that this cluster was redissolved and thus precipitated at a higher precipitant concentration. This does not comply with the phase behavior during the precipitation step, and it is expected that this discrepancy is caused by model inaccuracies. This assumption is supported by the highest residuals of this model to the measured summed up spectra for the investigated redissolution samples above the stated threshold (data not shown). Overall, the predicted VLP spectral loadings match the measured VLP spectrum (see ). Discrepancies are visible in the regression plot (see ) only at the higher or lower values of the spectral loadings. Compared to the first and second case studies, the R 2 value of the third case study for the spectral loadings is lower indicating a greater deviation of the predicted spectra to the measured spectrum. The highest RMSEP is partially caused by the different scale and the model mismatch which can be seen in . Additionally, the required preprocessing of the VLP screening data included the second derivative to enhance subtle spectral differences between the screened solutions. The spectral preprocessing may lead to higher discrepancies in and lower accuracy compared to the first and second case studies, but led to a robust model.\n\nIn summary, the choice of the correct model component and preprocessing techniques is crucial for the model outcome. These need to be selected with care when the investigated screening solutions involve complex solutions. Theoretical knowledge of selective precipitation and crystallization processes helps finding valid PARAFAC models. Nonetheless, the species in complex solutions demonstrating similar phase behavior can be clustered and described by one model component. In the case of co-precipitation of contaminants with the target molecule, the model may merge the spectra of these species in the predicted spectral loadings.\n\n4.3 Experimental and preprocessing differences between the case studies\n\nThe experimental setup and the spectral data preprocessing of each case study required adjustments to the specific protein system. This subchapter focuses on the preprocessing differences between the investigated case study, the experimental screening variations between selective crystallization and selective precipitation studies, and their possible effect on the calculated PARAFAC models.\n\nThe time smoothing range for the final models of the crystallization case study was lower than for the precipitation case studies (see ). The four times higher flow rate of the UV/Vis spectral analysis in the first case study is the reason, as the sample passed by the detector in a shorter time (compare , , and ) as the time-resolved, spectral information of the sample is comparable between the case studies after preprocessing. Longer time-wise smoothing may lead to the removal of important information for the model calculation. The selected wavelength range for the first case study was broader than for the other two (see Subchapter 2.4.1) since CytC was present in the first case study and has a second absorption maximum at 410 nm.\n\nThe third case study required the calculation of the second derivative (see ). Possible reasons could be that the target molecule VLP did not present distinct spectral differences to the contaminants (Mach et al., 1989) or contributed less to the measured spectra compared to target molecules of the first and second case studies. The target protein absorption shares of the initial material was high with 89.24% and 42.82% for the first and second case study, respectively. The VLP absorption share could not be determined as quantitative UV/Vis absorption data as a reference were missing. The large amount of UV/Vis-absorbing contaminants in the VLP lysate may interfere with the identification of the component representing VLPs. The differences in the time profile peak maxima of the target molecules compared to the contaminants support this assumption (see , , and ).\n\nFor each case study, the buffer system was adapted to the requirements of the target molecule. The buffer substances were not UV/Vis-active in the used concentration and did not affect the model calculation.\n\nOn the contrary, the precipitant AMS showed UV/Vis-absorbing behavior in the second case study and had an impact on the constructed models. A possible reason could be that the light refraction occurs when solutions of different density (mobile phase and sample solvent) pass the detector (Raval and Patel, 2020). This strongly depends on the screening AMS concentration and the sample dilution prior to the UV/Vis analysis. In the first case study dealing with the selective crystallization of Lys, the maximal screening AMS concentration was four times lower than in the second and third case studies.\n\nThe dilution factors for the first, second, and third case studies varied (see Subchapter 2.2) and were adjusted according to the total absorbance of the initial material at wavelength 280 nm. Taking all these factors into account, the analyzed samples of the second case study (mAb) contained the highest AMS concentration and thus the AMS concentration contributed to a greater extent to the recorded UV/Vis spectra. The constructed model compensated this by describing the precipitant concentration with its own model component (see ). UV/Vis data recorded of buffer solutions containing different amounts of AMS is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 and support this explanation.\n\nThe screening volume, screening size, and the analyzed process step solutions differed. The first case study (Lys crystallization) investigated 96 different conditions in 24 µl batches with eight different Lys starting concentrations and twelve precipitant concentrations. Only the supernatant samples of the crystallization step were analyzed. The spectral data set size was varied in this case study. Screening conditions that did not show concentration changes of the target molecule were excluded for model calculation. It was found that a large screening size with little variety in species composition and concentration ratios does not improve the model robustness but decreases the CORCONDIA value and increases the model error (data not shown). Preferably, the model error is low and the CORCONDIA high indicating an appropriate component number (Bro and Kiers, 2003) and, hence, a valid model. The second and third case studies screened twelve different precipitant concentrations in 500 µl batches for the selective precipitation of mAbs and VLPs. Samples were analyzed during the precipitation, the wash, and the redissolution step leading to a variety of 36 analyzed samples per screening differing in species compositions and concentration ratios. This sample variety improved the model calculation as the CORCONDIA of the final models was higher and the model error lower for the second and the third case studies.\n\nThe screening volume did not affect the spectral data set or the model calculation as long as there is enough supernatant for sampling.\n\nWhen selective crystallization or precipitation processes are characterized with the PARAFAC approach, the models cannot detect if the proteins crystallized or precipitated, as the generated models rely solely on the UV/Vis spectroscopic data set and specific protein concentration reductions. Regarding the experimental differences between the two processes, an additional centrifugation step is required to separate precipitate from the supernatant. Furthermore, the crystallization process requires more time than precipitation processes due to the time-intensive crystal nucleation and crystal growth of macromolecules (Durbin and Feher, 1996; McPherson, 2004).\n\nIn summary, these three case studies illustrate how the chemometric multi-way approach of PARAFAC can be applied to different phase behavior screenings with varying process conditions. The differences in spectral data preprocessing could be explained leading to a general preprocessing approach for future crystallization and precipitation screenings. Experimental differences in scale, sample dilution, screening size, and changes of the used chemicals did not interfere with the model calculation as long as the spectra of the target molecule and contaminant species contribute to the UV/Vis spectral measurement and differ in their spectral profiles. A broad variation of the different species concentrations and ratios in the data set was found to be preferred and can be achieved by analyzing different process solutions during selective precipitation or crystallization, washing, and redissolution process steps."
