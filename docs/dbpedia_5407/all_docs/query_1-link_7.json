        "text": "Simone is a given name that may be used as a masculine or feminine name, depending on the language.\n\nOriginating from the Greek translation of the Hebrew name Shimon, it became popular due to the Christianization of Europe and Biblical figures such as Simeon (son of Jacob) and Simeon (Gospel of Luke).[1] In Italian, Simone is a masculine name or patronymic surname, pronounced with three syllables, whilst the feminine form Simona is widespread throughout Europe.[2][3] In French and English Simone is a feminine name, pronounced with two syllables, whilst its masculine form in both languages is Simon/Simeon. Additionally, Simone, as a feminine name, may be spelled Simonne.[4][5]"
