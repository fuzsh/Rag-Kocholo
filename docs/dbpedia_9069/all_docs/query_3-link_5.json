A few of us made cantankerous elderly pop stars based on older celebs (mine was LIZ DAWN) and we would just go from topic to topic slagging off everybody’s work.

But people could create an alias of their artist, maybe who could only post in a Uramoopstar sub-forum if that's possible...Have a bit of time to come up with a single/album cover and tracklist, then a launch after which we have a week to 'promote', and then there's a vote at the end of the week for a one-off chart, with a reveal with who was which artist.\n\nThe trouble with it always was that it was a bit of WORK though and we're not teenagers with lots of free time any more (except @Soldi)\n\nThat sounds like a good idea. Obviously the race for the Xmas number one would be the natural choice but it's a BIT FAR OFF.\n\nGod it's like early Moopy!\n\nI remember Edna Albaquerque. She must have been around for YEARS.\n\nIguana\n\nLike beautiful robots dancing alone\n\nJoined\n\nJan 17, 2008\n\nMessages\n\n35,818\n\nLocation\n\nBetween war and denial"
