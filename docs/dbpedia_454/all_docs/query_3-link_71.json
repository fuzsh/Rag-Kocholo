        "text": "Since b4 the onset of the #EndBadGovernanceInNigeria uprising last week, the govt sought to delegitimise the #RightToProtest. At the forefront of this effort has been Nyesom Wike, Minister of the Federal Capital Territory, who is himself a senior lawyer. Wike's claim to fame is that as Governor of the #oilrich Rivers State in the #NigerDelta, he procured the violent re-writing of results in the state in #NigeriaDecides2023. Since then, he appears to believe that he has become an emperor in #Nigeria. It is time to tell Nyesom Wike that none of us escorted him into Nigeria. Impunity for #ElectionRigging does not make those who do it anything less than they are - persons who belong in jail. It is time to call out this #HubrisSyndrome. https://lnkd.in/e5MZDC94\n\n#Nigeria, #Africa's most populous country, is in the middle of a second generational #Uprising in less than 4 yrs. In October 2020, the #EndSARS uprising focused attention on lawless policing. Today, the #EndBadGovernance uprising calls attention to #BanditPolitics & irresponsible government. The response of the politicians has been to seek to delegimise the #RightToProtest. Instead of addressing the issues, they have told citizens whose lives have been blighted while politicians live large, that this is a bad time to protest: They claim that it is premature to protest against the policies of a govt that has spent over one year of a four-year-long mandate. They claim that \"hunger did not begin today.\" 2 days before the scheduled beginning of the protests, the government spent a lot of money to buy hungry citizens to #ProtestAgainstProtest. It looked awfully disreputable & it was. As an opposition leader, incumbent President, Bola Tinubu, sponsored protests & threatened #FireAndBrimstone while doing so. The citizens collected the money, dutifully showed up for the manufactured protests but, when interviewed, complained bitterly that they were truly very hungry. Not done, govt interests spent a lot of money to buy the rights to #BigBrotherAfrica to begin airing in the middle of the protests in the hope that young ppl wld rather watch that than protest. Unsuccessful in delegitimising the protests or dissuading the people from showing up, security agencies were let loose on unarmed protesters. Scores have been killed. Many more have been injured in 3 days of protests. In Kano, in NW #Nigeria, suspected State-sponsored provocateurs unfurled #RussianFlags to encourage a narrative of foreign sponsorship of the protests. All this is very redolent of what happened under #colonial Nigeria. Then, a regime that lacked legitimacy with the people defaulted to violence whenever the people sought dialogue, killing lots of people. Long after the end of #ColonialRule in Nigeria, a govt that claims democratic legitimacy is busy re-enacting the lethal script of colonial response to the right to protest in a manner that painfully advertises its gross #LegitimacyDeficits. One morale of this story? Illegitimacy has a steep price & it is very lethal. For a brief historical context, pls follow the link....\n\nAround #Africa - as in the rest of the world - #WaterIsLife. The relationship with water has been pivotal in #Africa's relationship with the world. However, the relationship of Africa’s peoples to the continent’s waters has not always been harmonious. Three examples will suffice to illustrate this. One, the #Africans traded to the rest of the world in the #SlaveTrade were cargoed through waterways & oceans. Two, European contests over the control of Africa’s waters subsequently framed the #ScrambleForAfrica in the late 19th century. The General Act of Berlin, adopted on 26 Feb 1885 at the end of the #BerlinConference which partitioned the continent, acknowledged that its goal was “to assure to all nations the advantages of free navigation on the two chief rivers of Africa flowing into the #AtlanticOcean.” Three, the erasure of #AfricanHistory has, incredibly, also been indexed on water. In schools across the continent, children are taught how Europeans (like Mungo Park or David Livingstone) “discovered” different bodies of water in Africa, from West Africa’s River Niger to Southern Africa’s Victoria Falls, which Africans had been using long before their ancestors knew themselves. This is part of the history that inspired African Union in 2015 to institute 25 July as the #AfricanDayOfSeasAndOceans. The continent includes over 1.5 million km2 of Exclusive Economic Zones (EEZs); 30,000 km of coastline; 32 coastal states; 7 major rivers; as well as 6 Island States & archipelagos. The implications are far reaching for evolving a bountiful #BlueEconomy for Africa are far reaching. In this article for African Arguments, my colleague from Cameroon, Agnes Ebo'o & I explore these.... https://lnkd.in/eWXA25xh\n\nIn July 2017, the UNODC & #Nigeria's Bureau of Statistics issued a report on how #Nigerians experienced bribery, which ranked public institutions in terms of their proclivity for bribery. The Nigeria Police Force topped the league with a score of 46.4%. The report also noted that “at 33 per cent the prevalence of bribery in relation to prosecutors is the second highest, closely followed by #JudgesAndMagistrates, at 31.5 per cent.” Nigeria's judicial hierarchy decided that this was not bad enough. Seven years later, the 3rd edition of the report which came out at the beginning of this month contains the significant finding that the #NigerianJudiciary has vaulted from 3rd position to 1st. According to the report: \"among all types of public official for which there was sufficient data, with an average of NGN 31,000, the largest cash bribes were paid to judges and magistrates, followed by customs or immigration service officers (NGN 17,800) and members of the armed forces (NGN 16,600).” This is a fitting coda to the tenure of outgoing Chief Justice of Nigeria, Olukayode Ariwoola, who has rendered the judiciary spectacularly supine while exploring the nether-most regions of nepotism & clannishness. This is no is mean feat.... https://lnkd.in/eesBisjM\n\nLast week, #Nigeria's outgoing Chief Justice, Olukayode Ariwoola, swore in 22 new Justices of Appeal & 12 new judges of the High Court of the Federal Capital Territory (FCT High Court). The new judges of the FCT High Court include 8 family members (mostly children or in-laws) of living senior judges, including 3 from families of senior judicial figures who were responsible for the appointments: 1. a daughter-in-law of the CJN; 2. a daughter of the President of the Court of Appeal; 3. a daughter of the Chief Judge of the Federal Capital Territory. In barely two & a half years as #CJN, Olukayode Ariwoola has created a pipeline of nepotism in the judiciary that will take generations to address. Last week, when he swore in the new judges, the place was taken over by a procession of politicians & insider influence peddlers who were there to requite political favours or acquaint themselves with the new judicial figures. This has become an important ritual in the incest between politicians & judges in #Nigeria reflecting the fact that the judges have toppled the people & installed themselves as the only ppl who have a vote to confer the mandate to rule on the politicians. In turn the politicians license the judges to topple the #RuleOfLaw in order to create & sustain a #RuleByJudges. The victim is the #PublicGood & the consequences are grave.... https://lnkd.in/eGVgaBKu\n\nLast week, #EnuguRangersInternational, a football club founded in the ashes of the #NigerianCivilWar, returned to the top of #Nigeria's professional soccer league, #PSL. Segun Odegbami, perhaps the greatest winger ever to have worn Nigeria's colours & himself one of the greatest rivals of the original Rangers team writes here a highly readable story of the origins of #RangersInternational & a prayer for the development of sports as an industry in the country. As Chief Odegbami tells it: \"In ‘fighting’ their way back to the mainstream life in Nigeria, and in shedding the toga of a defeated people after the #CivilWar, some #Igbo leaders set up the football club to fast track their re-integration and chose the name ‘Rangers’ to reflect strength, power and an indomitable fighting and winning spirit.\" The rest of the story - as they say - is history.... https://lnkd.in/ea-wfHap"
