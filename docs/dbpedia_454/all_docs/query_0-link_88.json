        "text": "Popular Nigerian actor, Yul Edochie has taken to social media to eulogize colleague, Mercy Johnson Okojie, who celebrates her birthday today.\n\nMercy Johnson turned 37 today and Yul Edochie posted a stunning photo of her on his Instagram page and showered encomium on her appreciating her for playing role in what she has become today.\n\nYul Edochie described Mercy Johnson as one of the greatest actresses the Nigerian movie industry is blessed with.\n\nHe wrote:\n\nHappy birthday to one of the greatest actresses in Nollywood history. I had to study her acting style many years ago and it helped me get to where I am today. But that’s a story for another day.\n\nHappy birthday, @mercyjohnsonokojie Wish you many more great years. May God be with you always.\n\nYul Edochie (born Yul Chibuike Daniel Edochie 7 January, 1982) is a Nigerian actor, named after popular Russian actor Yul Brynner. He is from Anambra State Nigeria, the son of Nigerian actor Pete Edochie. He was raised both in Lagos and Enugu. He is the last of 6 children. He got married at the age of 22. He attended the University of Port Harcourt, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in Dramatic Arts.\n\nYul Edochie attended Lillians’ Day Nursery School and Robinson Street Primary School, Enugu between 1984 and 1992. His secondary education started from 1992 to 1998. In those 6 years he went to Marist Brothers’ Juniorate, Uturu , University Secondary School Enugu, Ecumenical Community Secondary School Enugu and New Haven Boys Secondary School Enugu Respectively.\n\nEdochie is married to May Aligwe and has 3 sons and a daughter.\n\nEdochie Joined Nollywood in 2005 in his first film titled “The Exquires” alongside the Late Justus Esiri and Enebeli Elebuwa. He got his break in 2007 after featuring alongside Genevieve Nnaji and Desmond Elliot in the movie “Wind Of Glory”.\n\nIn 2015, Edochie opened a film academy in Lagos. He launched the academy as a result of the decline in quality and professionalism of upcoming Nigerian actors and actresses. The academy as stated by him is supposed to train the next generation of Nollywood actors and actresses. A duty which he intends to do personally. The academy gives talented people the opportunity to be introduced to the Nigerian Film Industry.\n\nOn the 14 July 2017, Edochie declared his intention run for Governor of Anambra State. This declaration was made in anticipation of a Not Too Young To Run Bill passed by the senate of the federal government of Nigeria. The declaration was however made official on the 22nd of August 2017, when he picked up the nomination form of the political party “Democratic Peoples Congress” and was eventually the flag bearer and gubernatorial candidate of the party to run for governor of Anambra State."
