        "text": "When the word Edochie is mentioned, your thoughts immediately turn to the legendary actor from Nollywood, Pete Edochie, who captivated the hearts of numerous moviegoers with his outstanding performances. But as they say, the apple doesn’t fall too far from the tree. Yul Edochie, as he was more commonly known, was the successor apparent to Pete Edochie’s film career.\n\nWhat may be referred to as a modern Nollywood actor is Yul Edochie. He entered the film industry with polished, genuine performances and a seriousness of acting after making his acting debut in 2005. It is no surprise that he is living up to his namesake, the late Russian actor Yul Brynner, given that he was the inspiration for his name. He has received tremendous appreciation in Nollywood for being a versatile performer. Many aspiring actors who looked up to him as their idol were encouraged to pursue acting professions as a result of his appealing and spectacular theatrical accomplishments.\n\nBiography\n\nPete and Josephine Edochie welcomed Yul Chibuike Daniel into the world on January 7, 1982 in Anambra State. He is the sixth child that his parents have ever had. His mother was a broadcaster, while his father is a well-known cinema veteran. In his early years, he went to Robinson Street Primary School and Lillian’s Day Nursery School. When he was finished, he continued his education through high school, attending the Junioriate of the Marist Brothers as well as a few other institutions until he graduated. He then continued on to pursue a university education, earning a Theatre Arts degree from the University of Port Harcourt (UNIPORT).\n\nNet Worth\n\nYul Edochie has an estimated net worth of $1.8 million (N694,170,000) as a result of his lucrative acting, business, and political careers.\n\nFamily life\n\nYul Edochie wed May Aligwe in 2004. They are fortunate to have four kids. But Edochie only recently revealed via Instagram on April 27, 2022, that he had wed a second woman and the couple welcomed a son. These admissions created a commotion among his family as well as on social media. Many responses came out, calling him “an unfaithful lover” and other derogatory terms. Online debates between men and women also broke out often, both supporting and disputing Yul Edochie’s behavior.\n\nYul Edochie’s Professional Accomplishments\n\nActing Career\n\nYul Edochie’s father undoubtedly serves as his inspiration. He credits him with his triumphs for giving him unwavering support throughout his development, particularly in his academic career. When Edochie was growing up, he recalled that his father was “strict to a fault.” Along with many others who went unmentioned, Jim Iyke and Emeka Ike had an impact on his acting.\n\nHe moved to Lagos in search of a more fulfilling life, and at the age of 23, he began an acting career there. He then appeared in his first film, “The Exquires,” alongside actors like as Enebeli Elebuwa and the late Justice Esiri. Later, he became well-known for his role in the 2007 movie “Wind of Glory,” which also starred Genevieve Nnaji and Desmond Elliot. After then, Edochie gained momentum in the movie industry and developed a solid reputation. Yul Edochie has acted in over 100 movies, playing a variety of roles such as ritualists, loverboys, etc.\n\nAgain, the main factor contributing to certain people’s enjoyment of his films is his portrayals as villains. He makes an appeal to realism, which makes it simple for people to recognize his contribution to the Nollywood business.\n\nRead Also: Tony Elumelu: Biography, Net worth, family life and achievements\n\nBelow are some of the movies he featured in:\n\nThe Exquires (2005)\n\nWind of Glory (2007)\n\nSleek Ladies (2007)\n\nGive It Up (2008)\n\nKiss my Pain (2008)\n\nTears of Hope (2009)\n\nMy Loving Heart (2009)\n\nSarafina (2011)\n\nZone 9 (2012)\n\nBridge of Contract (2012)\n\nThe End is Near (2012)\n\nDeath Certificate (2013)\n\nThe Jezebels (2013)\n\nRestless Soul (2013)\n\nApostles of Lucifer (2014)\n\nOjuju Calabar (2015)\n\nCompound Fools (2015)\n\nThe Affectionate Wife (2017)\n\nATM Machine (2017)\n\nThe Billionaires (2018)\n\nAbout Time Larry (2021)\n\nDevil Has Fallen (2021)\n\n7 Days to Die (2021)\n\nAgents of Darkness (2021)\n\nThe Dark Knight (2021)\n\nGolden Staff of Wealth (2021)\n\nSoul of a Wife (2022)\n\nTheatrical Academy\n\nFor a while, Yul Edochie started to worry about the types of movies that Nollywood was producing. Not only that, but he was also concerned about the industry’s growing influx of inexperienced rising actors. So, on his own, he founded the “Yul Edochie Academy” in 2015, a film school with the express purpose of evaluating the skills and degrees of experience of aspiring Nollywood actors and actresses. He created this academy to personally prepare the upcoming Nollywood actors and actresses for success in the film industry.\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nHe did not only become well-known through film. He is a kind-hearted individual as well. His philanthropic spirit inspired him to start the “Yul Edochie Charity” foundation in 2011. Its goal is to assist those who are in great need.\n\nHope you enjoy this article?\n\nShare your thoughts in the comment session.\n\nContact us today for your business consultancy and business advisory services.
