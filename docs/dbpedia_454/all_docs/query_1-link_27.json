        "text": "Nigerian Actor Yul Edochie has sparked reactions online after revealing his view on money and life.\n\nThe Social media influencer and cleric took to his Instagram handle and wondered why people tend to take life seriously when we are all meant to die and will die anyway.\n\nHe detailed his view on people who are overzealous about life to the extent that they find it challenging to spend their hard-earned money and urged them to resist such habit.\n\nHe further cautioned that people should spend their money and not stock it to avoid foreseeing another person squandering it when they are gone.\n\nHis words:\n\n“We’re all going to die. It’s only a matter of time. e go reach everybody.”\n\n“Life is really not that serious. Na we just dey take am too serious.”\n\n“That money wey you dey hide, bring am out, chop am well well.”\n\n“Share some to other people. If not, you go still leave am die.”\n\nNigerians couldn’t hold their nerves and reacted massively via all the social media platforms.\n\nSee his post below;"
