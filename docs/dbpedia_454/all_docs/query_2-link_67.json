        "text": "May Yul Edochie, the estranged wife of actor, Yul Edochie, reflecting on the past year ‚Äì 2023, said it stole her flesh and blood leaving her in the most devastating, miserable, and confused state.\n\nThe PUNCH reported the passing of 16-year-old Kambiichukwu, first son of May and actor Yul Edochie, who passed after he slumped while playing football in school.\n\nSharing a worship video on her Instagram account on Monday, May expressed the grief and devastation that the year brought, describing it as a period that snatched away her ‚Äúflesh and blood‚Äù and left her in a state of misery and confusion.\n\nShe said, ‚ÄúDear 2023, you were pregnant on the very first day of Jan unknown to anyone what you would deliver. You dealt with me in the most catastrophic ways‚Ä¶. Too many adversities/misfortunes and the worst of it, you stole my own flesh and blood, leaving me in the most devastating, miserable, and confused state that I could never have imagined.\n\n‚ÄúI lost all hope and nearly gave up, I had too many questions eating me all up but I kept hearing that voice echoing, ‚ÄòWho am I to question God?‚Äô\n\n‚ÄúI struggled so hard and stood on God‚Äôs words commanding us to give Him praise in every situation despite how difficult it is. Truly, I appreciate all the good people you made me cross paths with (my family, friends, strangers turned friends and my online family).\n\n‚ÄúI cannot begin to list names because it is endless but I want y‚Äôall to know that I will forever remain thankful for the incredible level of love and support showered upon me and my family in our most difficult times.\n\n‚ÄúI‚Äôm grateful to God Almighty for being God in my life, in other words, I‚Äôm so glad that man is not God.\n\n‚Äú2023, it is with all that is within me, I say goodbye to you forever as I embrace the new year 2024 singing my song with a life of thanksgiving, a life of forgiveness, and a life of commitment to God.\n\n‚ÄúI pray that God in His infinite mercy and goodness will bless us all and shield us under His constant love.üôè Afflictions shall never rise in our homes in Jesus‚Äô nameüôè, I wish you all a happy and prosperous new year! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù"
