        "text": "Nigerian heartthrob Yul Edochie was incredibly secretive about his personal life at the beginning of his career. However, in the recent years, the actor has been opening up and sharing some sneak peeks of his wife and kids. We’ve decided to compile all the available information about Yul Edochie wife and daughter (as well as her younger brothers), so that you can get to know your favourite actor a little better through his family.\n\nWho is Yul Edochie?\n\nLet us remind you a little bit about who Yul Edochie is. This well-known Nigerian actor was born on January 7, 1982 in Lagos, Nigeria. Yul is the sixth child of Josephine and Pete Edochie, another famous Nollywood actor.\n\nDespite the fact that his father has always been very famous and respected, Yul wanted to achieve everything on his own. He left his parents’ home to receive higher education at the University of Port Harcourt, where he studied Dramatic Arts. After that, he set out to become a Nollywood star.\n\nThese days, we can certainly say that Yul has achieved what he wanted and more. He is a successful actor, head of an acting academy named after him and even a gubernatorial candidate for Anambra State. However, we are also quite sure that he would not have been able to reach these heights without his family. Let’s talk about Yul Edochie family and how they all make each other better.\n\nYul Edochie wife\n\nTo all those asking ‘Is Yul Edochie married?’, let us inform you, that he is in fact married. You might not believe it, but Yul met his wife a very long time ago. And by ‘long time’ we mean almost twenty years ago! The two met in 1998, when Yul was attending the university, and they have not separated since. In 2004, they got married, which only made their relationship stronger.\n\nYou are probably wondering:\n\nWho is this woman who has kept one of the most desired men in Nollywood by her side all these years? Well, her name is May, although she also goes by Mary. Before she met Yul, she used to be May Aligwe. Today, she uses the name May Yul-Edochie, which shows how totally devoted she is to her husband.\n\nFrom her page on Facebook (http://ift.tt/2hgvykR) and her Instagram (@mayyuledochie), we have been able to gather that she was born on September 28 (year of birth unknown). She attended the Airforce secondary school in Ikeja and the Enugu State University of Science and Technology.\n\nFrom her husband’s interviews, we know that she works in the sphere of computer engineering and even has her own business. If her Facebook page is anything to go by, then the name of her company is DKK Investments, where she is the CEO.\n\nBut what about her marriage?\n\nWhen it comes to her relationship with Yul, it seems like May is the definition of a perfect wife. When the two met for the first time, Yul had virtually nothing. However, May did not care about his wealth, which was why she has stayed with him through thick and thin and helped him to get his life back on track.\n\nMay has always supported him with words and actions and she continues to do so now that her husband is running for governor. On her Instagram, May posts photos and videos of his campaign, and it is obvious that she does all she can to stand by her husband.\n\nThis love and support are not one-sided. Even though Yul does not like to talk much about his personal life, he always says that marrying his wife at 22 is the best decision he has ever made.\n\nHere is a cute little fact for you:\n\nIn 2012, on February 14, the most romantic holiday of all, Yul went all out with the gift for his wife. Instead of just getting her a bunch of red roses, he bought her a brand new red Toyota!\n\nYul often praises May for being very understanding when it comes to his sometimes crazed fans or other perils of being a famous actor. He swears that he has never looked at another person the same way he does at his wife, and that nobody could ever tempt him to cheat on May.\n\nYul and May have been together for quite a while, and as a result of that they now have three beautiful children, one of whom we will pay special attention to.\n\nYul Edochie daughter\n\nREAD ALSO: Uche Jombo husband and son\n\nThe eldest child of Yul and May is their daughter Dani. She was born on April 14, 2005, merely a year after her parents got married. From what we have seen on her parents’ Instagram pages, she has a regular childhood, albeit just a little fancier than that of any other child.\n\nBut here is the thing:\n\nWhen she was born, her parents were barely able to afford the hospital bills. Right at that time, Yul hit a rough patch in his life, but, thanks to his loving family, he was able to get back on his feet and give his loved ones what they deserved. When it was Dani’s first day of secondary school, Yul got very emotional in one of his posts, and it was very touching to see how much she meant to him.\n\nSo far, Dani has not yet publicly expressed her thoughts on who she wants to be when she grows up. However, she already has an endorsement deal, even though she is only twelve years old. She and her father are promoting a line of electronics (smart watches and tablets) for kids from the brand called Ninos that allow parents to know about their children’s location.\n\nHere is another fact for you:\n\nIn case you did not know, Dani is not the only child in the family. She has two younger brothers, Karl and Kambi. The boys look like they are about 9-10 years old, but neither Yul nor May have ever said anything about their ages.\n\nNow you know a little bit more about Yul Edochie and family. It is not much, but that is all he is comfortable sharing with the public, so we should respect his boundaries. Nevertheless, we sure are glad to see that Yul is happy, as he is surrounded by such wonderful and loving people. God bless him and his family.\n\nREAD ALSO: Nigerian actress Ruth Kadiri biography"
