        "text": "This article is about the capital of Enugu State in Nigeria. For the state, see Enugu State. For all other uses, see Enugu (disambiguation).\n\nEnugu ( ay-NOO-goo;[8] Igbo: Énugwú)[9][10] is the capital city of Enugu State in Nigeria. It is located inland in the Southeastern part of Nigeria. According to the 2006 census, the city had a population of 820,000.\n\nQuick Facts Énugwú, Country ...\n\nClose\n\nThe name Enugu is derived from the two Igbo words Énú úgwú, meaning \"hill top\", denoting the city's hilly geography. Enugu acquired township status in 1917 and was called Enugwu-Ngwo. Because of its rapid expansion towards areas owned by other indigenous communities, the city was renamed Enugu in 1928. Since the 17th century the location of present-day Enugu has been inhabited by the Ngwo and Nike ( nee-KAY) subgroups of the Igbo people.\n\nIn 1900, the colonial administration of the British Empire established the Southern Nigeria Protectorate. After the discovery of coal in 1909 by colonists, they founded what was then known as the Enugu Coal Camp. It was named after the nearby village of Enugu Ngwo, where coal was first found.\n\nThe nearby city of Port Harcourt was created in order to ship this coal abroad. It was located 243 kilometres (151 mi) south of the camp.[11]\n\nCoal mining opportunities in Enugu attracted people from throughout the region; this marked the core of the first urban settlement of what is today known as simply Enugu. Enugu developed as one of the few cities in West Africa created entirely from European contact. By 1958 Enugu had more than 8,000 coal miners, many managing individual plots. As of 2005 there are no significant coal mining activities left in the city.\n\nEnugu became the capital of the Eastern Region after Nigeria's independence in 1960; a succession of territorial adjustments in 1967, 1976 and 1991 resulted in Enugu becoming the capital of what is now Enugu State. On 30 May 1967 Enugu was declared the capital of the short-lived Republic of Biafra; for this Enugu is known as the \"capital of Igboland.\" After Enugu was captured by Nigerian armed forces, the Biafran capital was moved to Umuahia.\n\nIndustries in the city include the urban market and bottling industries. Enugu is also a primary filming location for producers of the Nigerian movie industry. Enugu's main airport is the Akanu Ibiam International Airport.\n\nThe 2006 national census in Nigeria estimated the population of Enugu state at 3,267,837.[12] While males constitute 48.84% of the population, the female population constitute 51.16%[13] (1,596,042 males and 1,671,795 females). But, demographers have indicated that the actual population of Enugu state is around six million.[14]"
