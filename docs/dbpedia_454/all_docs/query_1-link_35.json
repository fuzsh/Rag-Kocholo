        "text": "Advertisement\n\nNigerian actor and self-styled pastor, Yul Edochie has sparked a stir on social media by telling his followers to spend their savings rather than put them aside for the future.\n\nEdochie urged his Instagram followers to “chop their money” and give part to those in need, pointing out that death is inevitable and they will leave behind their savings if they don’t spend it.\n\nResponses to Edochie’s remarks have been divided; some have called on him to live in the moment and share with others, while others have criticized his advise as careless and reckless.\n\nYul expanded on his views, stating that life is not as serious as people make it out to be and that everyone will eventually die.\n\nHe emphasised the importance of enjoying one’s life and sharing with others, rather than hoarding wealth.\n\n“We’re all going to die. It’s only a matter of time. e go reach everybody. Life is not that serious. Na we just dey take am too serious. That money wey you dey hide, bring am out, chop am well well. Share some with other people. If not, you go still leave am die,” he said."
