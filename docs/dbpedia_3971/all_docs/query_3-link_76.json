        "text": "The Church of Saint Andrew is a magnificent Catholic church located in Toledo. Built in medieval times, the church is a perfect example of the city's rich cultural heritage and the influence of different architectural styles over the centuries. The church is considered a cultural heritage site in Spain and is protected by the heritage listing Bien de Interés Cultural.\n\nThe Iglesia de San Andrés is a blend of different architectural styles, including Mudéjar, Gothic, and Baroque, with the latter being the result of a renovation in the 17th century. The church underwent its latest restoration, and as a result, traceries appeared in the facade, which evokes the eclecticism of the crossing. Additionally, a Visigothic relief and two Visigothic pilasters were discovered during the restoration.\n\nOne of the unique features of this church is its main entrance, which is in the Almohad style and is the only one of its kind in Toledo. The entrance bears uncommon small green ceramic columns on the door and Visigothic capitals. The church also contains a funeral pilaster that represents its mosque past.\n\nThe crypt of the church is home to around 60 mummies of infants, dukes, nuns, and people of popular classes, which are in good condition and available for the public to view. The church is believed to have been built on the site of a mosque that pre-dated Alfonso VI's conquest of the city in 1085. The church stands only a few meters from the city's seminary.\n\nThe Church of Saint Andrew is open only during services, and its mass timings vary depending on the season. During the Spring and Summer, the church holds mass at 7:30 PM from Monday to Saturday and at 9 AM and 12:30 PM on Sunday. In Autumn and Winter, the mass timings are 7 PM from Monday to Saturday and 9:30 AM and 12:30 PM on Sunday. Despite its limited hours, the Iglesia de San Andrés remains an important destination for those interested in the rich cultural heritage of Toledo."
