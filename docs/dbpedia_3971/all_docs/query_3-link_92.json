        "text": "The church of San Andrés is situated in the old town of Segovia, very close to the cathedral, which gives it a special charm. This is a beautiful 12th Century Romanesque church featuring an impressive facade. Its exterior is made of brick. The Mudejar tower features a slate roof and two apses that are next to it. The largest was built in the twelfth century with the rest of the church, but later was made smaller and has less relevance. Another element that stand outside the church of San Andrés is the cross that is on the front. It is a cross made from the same stone, that brings elegance to the building and makes it different from the rest."
