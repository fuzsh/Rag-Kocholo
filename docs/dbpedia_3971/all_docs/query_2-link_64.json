        "text": "Historical Notes\n\nThe San Fernando Valley was first discovered by the Portola expedition in 1769, but it wasn't until 1797 that San Fernando Mission was established. In the late 1790s, Father Lasuen, successor to Father Serra, wanted to close the gaps in the El Camino Real, and he established four missions in four months, including San Fernando Mission.\n\nThe best spot in the area was claimed by Francisco Reyes, mayor of the Los Angeles pueblo. He had acquired rights to the land shortly after Los Angeles was founded, and he raised cattle there. Some say Reyes got his land from the king and had to be forcibly evicted, while others say he had simply been using the land and gave it up gracefully.\n\nThe San Fernando Mission was founded on September 8, 1797, and named for Saint Ferdinand III, King of Spain in the 1200s. Five Indian boys and five Indian girls were baptized at the San Fernando Mission that day. Reyes was a patron of the formal dedication and the godfather of the first child baptized.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nFather Padre FermÃ­n de Francisco LasuÃ©n de Arasqueta (June 7, 1736 â June 26, 1803) founded Mission San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±aon September 8, 1797.\n\nSometimes called the \"forgotten friar,\" Padre FermÃ­n LasuÃ©n actually governed the California Mission system three years longer than his more famous predecessor, Padre Junipero Serra. LasuÃ©n was born at Vitoria in Ãlava, Spain on July 7, 1736 and joined the Franciscan Order as a teenager, entering the Friary of San Francisco shortly before his fifteenth birthday on March 19, 1751. On March 19, 1751, LasuÃ©n was ceremoniously invested with his Franciscan habit. In 1759, he left CÃ¡diz with seventeen other friars while still a deacon to volunteer for ministry in the Americas. He arrived in Mexico in 1761 and was sent to Baja California in 1768. Following the establishment of Mission San Diego de AlcalÃ¡ in 1769, he went to Alta California in 1773. He based himself in San Diego and remained there until 1775.\n\nFather FermÃ­n LasuÃ©n also helped establish Mission San Juan Capistrano before the murder of Father LuÃ­s Jayme. Kumeyaay Indian unrest caused his return to San Diego and the general withdrawal of Spanish operations. In late 1776 he went to San Luis Obispo before again returning to San Diego in 1777 when he was made minister there. He was appointed the second Presidente of the missions in California in 1785, replacing JunÃ­pero Serra, and transferred to the Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo. On his death he was succeeded by Padre Pedro EstÃ©van TÃ¡pis.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nMission San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a (originally La MisiÃ³n del SeÃ±or Fernando, Rey de EspaÃ±a) is located on the former settlement of Encino Rancho. It was the seventeenth mission built in Alto California. It was built in a quadrangle, similar to other missions, in which the church makes up one corner. The original church was built in 1797, but was soon outgrown; a larger chapel was built, but that one, too, soon proved to be too small for the growing population. A third, larger chapel was built and blessed in December 1806, but was completely damaged by the destructive earthquake of 1812 - once again, a new church was built and completed in 1818.\n\nBy 1804, nearly 1,000 Indians lived at San Fernando Mission. By 1806, they were raising cattle and producing hides, leather good, tallow and cloth.\n\nIts closeness to Los Angeles and location along a popular traveling route made this place unique. Travelers stopped often, and the fathers kept adding onto the convento wing to accommodate them, until the hospice (hotel) became known as the \"long building\" of the El Camino Real.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nAfter 1811, the San Fernando Mission native population began to decline, and productivity was threatened. By 1812, there were too few workers to farm the produce required for the military in Los Angeles. When the buildings were damaged by an earthquake in 1812, there were not enough workers to make the repairs.\n\nMexico gained its independence from Spain in 1822. In the California province, there were struggles to control the land. A few Indians in the valley received land grants, but most of the surviving Indians remained depended on the San Fernando Mission.\n\nWhen Mexican Governor Echeandia arrived in 1827, Spanish Father Ibarra was in charge. Father Ibarra refused to renounce his allegiance to Spain, but the Mexican government let him stay there because they couldn't find anyone else to run the operations.*\n\nThe struggle between northern and southern Californians over the land intensified, and in February, 1845, two armed groups met at the Cahuenga Pass. They shot at each other for half a day, but the only casualties were two horses and a wounded mule. The northerners then left, and Pio Pico became the new governor of California. In 1845, Governor Pio Pico leased the land to his brother AndrÃ©s for $1,200 a year. AndrÃ©s used it as a summer home.^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nThe Convento Building is a large two-story building measuring approximately 243 feet long and 50 feet wide, and was built in stages between 1808 and 1822. It has a broad portico extending the whole length of the building, four-foot-thick adobe walls, visible rafters, and a roof of burnt tile.\n\nThe long portico, sometimes referred to as the colonnade, has 21 Roman arches along the front of the building and is the most recognized image of the Mission. The Convento Building was, and still is, the largest adobe structure in California and is also the largest original building in California's missions. The road that would eventually become \"El Camino Real\" is visible to the left of the building.*\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nIn 1845, Governor PÃ­o Pico declared the Mission buildings for sale and, in 1846, made Mission San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a his headquarters as Rancho Ex-Mission San Fernando. The Mission was utilized in a number of ways during the late 19th century: north of the mission was the site of Lopez Station for the Butterfield Stage Lines; it served as a warehouse for the Porter Land and Water Company; and in 1896, the quadrangle was used as a hog farm. San Fernando's church became a working church again in 1923 when the Oblate priests arrived.*^\n\nHistorical Notes\n\nBrand Park, also called Memory Garden, was given to the city November 4, 1920. It is a part of the original land grant of Mission San Fernando de Rey de Espana and is located at 15174 San Fernando Mission Boulevard, across the street from the Mission. The entrance gate is located at 15121 South Brand Boulevard. It features a soap works, the original mission fountain, a reservoir and a life-sized statue sculpted by Sally James Farnham of Father Junipero Serra with his arm around an Indian boy.*\n\nThe park was designated California Historic-Cultural Monument No. 150 in 1935.

In 1971, a large earthquake damaged the church, which had to be completely rebuilt. The repairs were completed in 1974. It continues to be very well cared for and is still used as a chapel-of-ease. In 2003 comedian Bob Hope was interred in the Bob Hope Memorial Gardens.*^\n\nMission San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a continues to serve as a parish church.*"
