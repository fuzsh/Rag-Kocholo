NOCHE\n\nThe history and culture of the Philippines are reflected in its architectural heritage, in the dwellings of its various peoples, in churches and mosques, and in the buildings that have risen in response to the demands of progress and the aspirations of the people.\n\nArchitecture in the Philippines today is the result of a natural growth enriched with the absorption of varied influences. It developed from the pre-colonial influences of our neighboring Malay brothers, continuing on to the Spanish colonial period, the American Commonwealth period, and the modern contemporary times. As a result, the Philippines has become an architectural melting pot– uniquely Filipino with a tinge of the occidental.\n\nThe late national hero for architecture, Leandro Locsin once said, that Philippine Architecture is an elusive thing, because while it makes full use of modern technology, it is a residue of the different overlays of foreign influences left in the Philippines over the centuries: the early Malay culture and vestiges of earlier Hindu influences, the more than 300 years of Spanish domination, the almost 50 years of American rule, the Arab and Chinese influences through commerce and trade over the centuries. What resulted may have been a hybrid, a totally new configuration which may include a remembrance of the past, but transformed or framed in terms of its significance today.\n\nThe Philippine’s architectural landscape is a contrast among small traditional huts built of wood, bamboo, nipa, grass, and other native materials; the massive Spanish colonial churches, convents and fortifications, with their heavy “earthquake baroque” style; the American mission style architecture as\n\nwell as the buildings of commerce with their modern 20th century styles; and today’s contemporary, albeit “modern mundane” concrete structures of the cities.\n\nConstruction of rural native huts has changed little in the centuries. Design vary by region, but common features include steep roof over a one-or-two room living area raised on posts or stilts one to two meters above the ground or over shallow water. Some huts have balconies. Floors may be of split bamboo to allow dirt and food scraps to fall through to pigs and poultry. The space beneath the hut may be used for storage or as a workshop; it also allows air to circulate andsafeguards against flooding, snakes, and insects. As families become more affluent, they frequently replace the thatch roof with galvanized iron which lasts longer but makes the house hotter and aesthetically more mundane. The bahay-kubo (nipa hut) is a typical traditional house found in most lowlands all over the Philippines. Originally built as a one-room dwelling, the nipa hut changed as family needs become more diverse.Modern urban dwellings, on the other hand, are typically two-story structures with a concrete ground floor, sides of brick, concrete blocks, or wooden slats, and an iron roof. During the 19th century, wealthy Filipinos built some fine houses, usually with solid stone foundations or brick lower walls, and overhanging, wooden upper story with balustrades and kapis shell sliding windows, and a tiled roof.\n\nThe Rizal house in Calamba, Laguna and the Luna house in Badoc, Ilocos Norte are good examples. Vigan, Ilocos Sur as well as Taal in Batangas have the best surviving Spanish quarters. The city of Manila, Ilo-ilo and Cebu also have some notable old houses. Other areas of the country present different forms of tribal architecture as compared to the low-land bahay kubo which is influenced greatly by culture, and in some cases, climate and the environment. In the upland regions of the Cordillera Mountains, the houses, though still using native materials, is a bit more secured. Where the low-land bahay kubo is ventilated on all sides, the mountain huts, Bontoc, fayu; Ifugao, bale; Kalinga, binayon; Kankanay, binangiyan, and others typify a more insulated dwelling. The Maranao torogan, on the other hand, is designed for royalty and thus built with much ornamentation and elaborate details. Being an isolated and wind-frequented area, the Batanes Islands, exhibit the most different of all traditional architecture in the Philippines. The Ivatan`s rakuh is built solidly on all sides, made of a meter thick rubble work covered by thick thatch roofing to withstand gales which frequent the area.\n\nThe arrival of the Spaniards in 1571 brought in Antillian architecture. Though not specifically suited for the hot tropics, European architecture was transposed via Acapulco, Mexico into a uniquely Filipino style. The style traces its roots from the Antilles, in Central America rather than from mother Spain. The Christianization of the islands created the need to establish religious structures to support the growing number of religious organizations. Though they don’t compare with those seen in Europe or in Latin America, Philippine colonial churches are unique in their own sense. Some of the best preserved colonial churches in the country are found in the Ilocos Regions, as well as those in the provinces of Laguna and Batangas, as well as the Visayan islands of Panay, Cebu and Bohol. These colonial churches were\n\ntypically designed by anonymous friar-architects and built between 1600 and 1750. Most were initially constructed with bamboo and nipa, but the friars realized that to instill a sense of awe, as well as to caution against the terrible menace of fire and earthquake, more grandiose buildings had to be erected. In spite of technical and material limitations, they managed to erect massive structures that often took years, even decades to complete, that have survived to the present.\n\nIn time, the friars’ task was taken over by Filipino and Chinese master-builders. These craftsmen have sometimes left their native stamp in the decorative motifs: tropical vegetation by Filipinos, lions and dragons by Chinese. The churches were built with an adjacent convento (priest house and office: also served as school, tribunal, prison and evacuation house during calamities), attached or detached belfry (as seen in the Ilocos Region where the belfry was built a couple of meters away from the church structure, this to anticipate a collapse of the belfry in times of earthquake) and walled forecourt. The large three-story belfry, affording a good view of the surrounding land and sea, were used as watchtowers for approaching enemies. Individual churches vary in the amount and style of their interior and exterior decoration. Many have an ornately carved facade and reredos, backdrop of the altar). Today, some churches are in their original form, while others have been spoiled by tasteless renovation. Many churches are the result of successive restoration and renovation projects which superimposes on earlier foundations. The Spanish colonial period also brought with it military architecture as seen in the fortifications they built all over the archipelago. Foremost of which isIntramuros in Manila. Intramuros which literally means within the walls, is a defensive network composed of raveling and bulwarks to protect the Spanish city from attack. It also contains the foremost military outpost during the Spanish reign, Fort Santiago named after Spain’s patron saint.\n\nCommercial structures which developed only during the latter part of the Spanish period evolved primarily from the typical Filipino noble house or the Bahay na Bato. The Bahay na Bato is a derivation of the traditionalBahay Kubo with more sturdier materials as the main form of construction. Using the same spatial arrangements of the Bahay kubo, the Bahay na Bato continued the principle of open ventilation and elevated apartments as that of its predecessor. The only difference being that the Bahay na Bato, which translates as Stone House, is made in most cases of stone instead of the more traditional bamboo. Other versions of the Bahay na Bato would be constructed of a stone- or brick-supported lower level and a hard wooden upper level covered by tiles or in later cases galvanized iron. The window of the house is unique in architecture for it opens not just from mid-level but from floor to ceiling. This enables tropical wind to circulate freely into the structure enabling the house to be ventilated tropically. The upper level, or the piano noble of the house contains the most luxuriously furnished apartments, this level overhangs the ground level which contains mostly storage and carriage depots.\n\nOther structures developed during the Spanish Period were schools and hospitals (Ateneo Municipal, University of Santo Tomas, Colegio de Letran, Hospital de San Juan de Dios). Though most\n\noften attached to the church, these structures eventually developed into their own following the tropical baroque style of architecture popular at the time.\n\nThe Philippine Revolution of 1887 led to the declaration of independence from Spain. This, on the other hand, was superceded by the transfer of power from Spain to the United States as part of the settlement entered by the Kingdom of Spain with the United States after the Spanish-American war. The Americans came to the islands in 1898. With the arrival of the Americans came a new breed of architectural structures. Foremost of the American contributions to the country was the establishment of civil government. This led to the erection of government buildings from the city all the way to the municipal level. Government houses dotted every community. Designed in the most respectable manner, these government houses resembled Greek or roman temples complete with porticoes and pediments.\n\nThe revival period, popular at the turn of the century, became the foremost architectural parlance of the era as seen in such buildings as the Government Post Office Building as well as the Legislative House. Education of the masses also became the thrust of the American regime, as such, public education was established, foremost of which is the University of the Philippines. With American rule firmly established in the islands, the military government at the time invited the noted Chicago architect and town planner Daniel Burnham to develop the city of Manila and found a summer capital in the area of Baguio. Burnham’s arrival led to the formation of the Burnham Plan which identifies the city of Manila as a uniquely European city in the tropics and as such opposed to develop its architecture in line with the existing style. The style of architecture, as suggested, varies little from existing architecture at the time as typified by The Manila Hotel. New structures continued the use of conventional motifs but were made of more durable materials such as concrete. This style of architecture prevailed even after the turn of the century.\n\nThe eclectic style, a mixture of historic styles, also found its way in some of the commercial establishments rising in the business district such as the Regina Building along historic Escolta. The emergence of Art Nouveaualso gave some samples in the central business districts (Uy-Chaco Building along Calle Rosario and Plaza Cervantes) as well as in stately homes of the well to do (Casa de Ariston Bautista in Calle Barbosa, Quiapo). By the mid 20`s to the eve of the second world war, Art Deco became the bi-word for Philippine Architecture with works such as the Metropolitan Theatre along Plaza Aroceros, Perez-Samanillo Building, Crystal Arcade and Capitol theatre along Escolta, State and Avenue Theatre along Avenida Rizal, Lide and Times Theatre along Quezon Boulevard and others.\n\nThe aftermath of the second world war left nothing but destruction in its wake, and a time of rebuilding ensued. The modern era dawned on Philippine architecture using the simple straight lines of the International Modern Style as a chief mode of expression. By the 70`s a new form of Philippine architecture emerged with the filipinization of architecture. The Filipino style found its way in the reemergence of traditional motifs,the bahay-kubo and the bahay na bato became popular forms to be copied and modernized (Batasan Pambansa, BLISS Housing projects). By the 80`s the country’s architectural idiom was swept by the tide of Post Modernism, a hearkening back of some sort to the romance of classical architecture. Today, architecture in the Philippines continue to be vibrant and with the country opening up to the world, more first rate architecture is pouring in.\n\nArchitecture of the Philippines From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nPaoay Church, an example of Philippine earthquake baroque architecture.\n\nThe architecture of the Philippines (Filipino: Arkitekturang Pilipino, Spanish: Arquitectura Filipina) is a reflection of the country's historical and cultural heritage. Most prominent historic structures in the archipelago are based on a mix of indigenous Austronesian, Chinese, Malay, American, and Spanishinfluences. During three hundred years of Spanish colonialization, the Philippine architecture was dominated by the Spanish influences. The Augustinian friars, along with other religious orders, built a large number of grand churches and cathedrals all over the Philippine Islands. During this period the traditional Filipino Bahay na bató (Filipino for \"stone house\") style for the large houses emerged. These were large houses built of stone and wood combining Filipino, Spanish and Chinese style elements. After the Philippines was ceded to the United States of America as a consequence of the Spanish– American War in 1898, the architecture of the Philippines was dominated by American aesthetics. In this period, the plan for the modern City of Manila was designed, with a large number of neoclassical architecture and art deco buildings by famous American and Filipino architects. During World War II, large portions of Intramuros and Manila were destroyed. Many heritage districts in the provinces were burned down by the Japanese before the end of the war. In the reconstruction period after the Second World War, many of the destroyed buildings were rebuilt, however, a majority of heritage structures, especially in the provinces, were lost and never rebuilt. Most of the structures that were lost are considered a focal properties of former heritage towns. In the late 20th century, modern architecture with straight lines and functional aspects was introduced, particularly in the Brutalist architecture that characterized government-built structures\n\ndone in the Marcos period. During this period many of the older structures fell into decay. Early in the 21st century, a revival of the respect for the traditional Filipino elements in the architecture returned. There have been proposals to establish a policy where each municipality and city will have an ordinance mandating all constructions within each territory to be inclined with the municipality or city's architecture and landscaping styles to preserve and conserve the country's dying heritage sites which have been demolished one at a time in a fast pace due to urbanization and culturallyunresponsible development. Such policies are used by countries which have preserved their architectural marvels for hundreds of years, such as Italy, France, Romania, Germany, and Spain. The proposal advocates both indigenous, colonial, and modern architectural and landscaping styles that are prevalent or used to be prevalent in a given city or municipality. The proposal, however, has yet to be manifested into an actual policy due to the lack of a Department of Culture. Only the city of Vigan has passed such an ordinance, which led to its declaration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and awarding of various recognition for the conservation and preservation of its unique architectural and landscaping styles. In 2016, senator Loren Legarda filed a bill establishing the Department of Culture. The bill was introduced in the Senate in January 2017.

These rice terraces illustrate the ability of human culture to adapt to new social and climate pressures as well as to implement and develop new ideas and technologies. They also epitomize a harmonic, sustainable relationship between humans and their environment. The structures' original builders used stone and mud walls to carefully carve and construct terraces that could hold flooded pond fields for the cultivation of rice. They also established a system to water these plots by harvesting water from mountaintop forests. These engineering feats were done by hand as was the farming itself. [1]\n\n[1]\n\nMaintenance of the rice terraces reflects a primarily cooperative approach of the whole community which is based on detailed knowledge of the rich diversity of biological resources existing in the Ifugao agro-ecosystem, a finely tuned annual system respecting lunar cycles, zoning and planning, extensive soil conservation, and mastery of a complex pest control regime based on the processing of a variety of herbs, accompanied by religious rituals and tribal culture. [2]\n\nClassical period[edit]\n\nBahay Kubo was the one of the common houses of Filipinos from the classical period up to pre-modern era.\n\nA replica of a traditional Ifugaohouse.\n\nLater on the invention of various tools allowed for the fabrication of tent-like shelters and tree houses. Early Classical houses were characterized by rectangular structures elevated on stilt foundations and covered by voluminous thatched roofs ornamented with gable-finials and its structure could be lifted as a whole and carried to a new site. Examples include the Ifugao House, Bahay kubo and the Royal Nobilities' Torogan.\n\nHouse structures[edit] See also: Nipa hut Houses were built in a more or less similar manner, in the same way that the settlements were built beside rivers and streams. The houses were built near rice fields and coconut groves and orchards.\n\nThe houses et on posts raised above the ground. The rooms were small, and generally,with a single multipurpose room, having only the cooking space differentiated among the areas in the houses. There is a particular architectural piece called ‘batalan’ that is often situated in the rear part of the house, and is utilized for domestic work like washing, bathing, water storage, etc. The houses were made of raw material like wood and bamboo. Tree houses or houses built on trunk of trees rooted to the grounds were seen as an advantageous position. The doors of the houses were usually oriented to the direction where the sun rises and never faced towards the west, an architectural tradition which can be explained by the values and belief systems that early inhabitants of the land have.\n\nThe Bahay Kubo[edit] The bahay kubo is the term for huts built out of nipa. These types of edifices were characteristic of the way that indigenous people of the Philippines built homes prior to the arrival of the Spanish colonizers. They are still in use today, especially in rural areas. Different architectural designs are present among the different ethnolinguistic groups in the country, although most homes built along the shorelines conform to being stilt houses, similar to those found in neighboring countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia, and other countries of Southeast Asia.\n\nSkills in fortification[edit] The architecture of the early Filipinos reflects the skills that were used at the time of war and on the battlefield. Due to the creation of various thalassocratic states within the archipelago, trade began to flourish. Neighboring states would often wage war for territory and trade rights in certain areas, which ultimately led to the fortification of villages and towns. Another reason for the development of these fortification skills was the necessity of projecting prestige and intimidation; leaders, mainly Datus, Rajahs, and Lakans, as they were called, often built forts and fortifications to intimidate other leaders in their area. The kota[edit]\n\nWith the arrival of Indianized and Muslim scholars from nearby Indonesia, the native Filipinos were introduced to the concept of the kota or the fort. The Muslim Filipinos of the south built strong fortresses called kota or moong to protect their communities. Usually, entire families occupies the kotas, rather than just warriors. The kota served not only as a military installation, but also as a palace for the local lord, who often had their own kotas to assert their right to rule.. It is said that at the height of the Maguindanao Sultanate's power, they blanketed the areas around Western Mindanao with kotas and other types of fortifications to block the Spanish advance into the region. The kota were usually made of stone and bamboo, or other light materials, and surrounded by trench networks. As a result, some of these kotas were burned easily or destroyed. With further Spanish campaigns in the region, the Sultanate was subdued and majority of kota were dismantled or destroyed. Kota were used by the Muslims as defense against Spaniards and other foreigners, and also saw use by renegades and rebels who built fortifications in defiance of other chiefs in the area. During the American occupation, rebels built strongholds and the datus, rajahs or sultans often built and reinforced their kotas in a desperate bid to maintain rule over their subjects and their land. Many of these forts were destroyed by American expeditions, and as a result, very few kota still stand to this day. [3]\n\n[4]\n\nNotable Kotas: \n\nKota Selurong: an outpost of the Bruneian Empire in Luzon, later will become the city of Intramuros at the arrival of the Spaniards and then became the City of Manila, The capital city of the Philippines.\n\n\n\nKuta Wato/Kota Bato: Literally translating to \"stone fort,\" and is the first known stone fortification in the country, Cotabato's ruins exist as the \"Kutawato Cave Complex\" Kota Sug/Jolo: The capital and seat of the Sultanate of Sulu. When it was occupied by the Spaniards in the 1870s they converted the kota into the world's smallest walled city. [5]\n\n\n\nLimestone Tomb complex of Kamhantik[edit] The Limestone tombs of Kamhantik is the site of the excavated remains of a thousand-year-old village, found in the jungles of Mount Maclayao in Sitio Kamhantik within the Buenavista Protected Landscape of Mulanay, Quezon, Philippines. The complex is composed of fifteen limestone coffins that can be dated back from the period of 10th to 14th century, with one of the National Museum's top archaeologists naming it \"a complex archaeological site with both habitation and burial remains from the period of approximately 10th to the 14th century ... the first of its kind in the Philippines having carved limestone tombs.\" [6]\n\nIdjang Citadel \"Batanes castles\"[edit]\n\nMain articles: Ivatan people and Idjang The Ivatan people of the northern islands of Batanes often built fortifications to protect themselves during times of war. They built their so-called idjangs A type of Citadels on hills and elevated areas. These fortifications were likened to European castles because of their purpose. Usually, the only entrance to the castles could only be accessed by a rope ladder that would only be lowered for the villagers, and could be hidden away when invaders arrived. [7]\n\nIgorot forts[edit]\n\nThe Igorots built forts made of stone walls that averaged several meters in width and about two to three times the width in height around 2000 BC. [8]\n\nTorogan[edit] Main article: Torogan\n\nA painting of a mother and child belonging to the Maharlika or Maginoo an Ancient Filipino class.\n\nModel of Torogan at Cockington Green Gardens.\n\nThis classical Filipino house has three different variants: the \"lawig,\" or the small houses; the mala-awalai, or the large houses; and the torogan, which were the largest. The torogans were built by the\n\ncommunity and the slaves for the king in seventeenth century. This house of the king has no partitions, and is a multifamily dwelling where all the wives and the children of the hari (king) lived. The windows of torogan are slits, richly framed in wood panels with okir designs located in front of the house. The communal kitchen is half a meter lower than the main house, and is serves a double purpose in being a cooking and eating space. The distinct high gable roof of the torogan, thin at the apex and gracefully flaring out to the eaves, sits on huge structures enclosed by slabs of timber and lifted more than two meters above the ground by a huge trunk of a tree that was set on a rock. The end floor beams lengthen as panolongs the seemed to lift up the whole house. The torogan is suffused with decorations. There were diagonal at the apex of the roof, and also intricately carved tinai a walai, okir designs in the floor, on windows and on panolongs. Additional decorations also included brightly colored woven cloths or malongs hanging from the rafters, hung up using ropes around a particular territory for privacy. These types of houses house was built to intentionally sway during earthquakes, thus allowing the buildings to withstand the earthquakes. Sometimes, if deemed necessary, wooden pegs were used to secure the wood foundations. These were all used to prevent the house from collapsing. [9]\n\nMosques[edit] With the arrival of Islam in Mindanao, Mosques, masjids were extensively built, an example being the Sheik Karimol Makdum Mosque in Simunul, Tawi-Tawi which was built in 1380. During the establishment of the Sultanate of Sulu , a wooden palace was built for the Sultans which was named Astana Darul Jambangan; unfortunately, this palace was destroyed by a typhoon in 1912. A replica of the royal palace was rebuilt as an attraction in Mt. Bayug Eco-Cultural Park in the town of Talipao, Sulu. . [10]\n\nThe yakan or ranggar in Maranao, were also popular, especially when Islam arrived in Mindanao in the 15th century. [11]\n\nSpanish colonial era[edit]\n\nSpanish colonial houses in Vigan.\n\nThe arrival of the Spaniards in 1571 brought in European colonial architecture to the Philippines. Though not specifically suited for the hot tropics, European architecture was transposed via Acapulco, Mexico into a uniquely Filipino style. Since the Spaniards brought Christianity to the islands, they created the need to establish religious structures to support the growing number of religious organizations. Some of the best preserved colonial churches in the country are found in the Ilocos Region, as well as those in the provinces of Laguna, Batangas, Cebu and Bohol. These colonial churches were typically designed by anonymous friar-architects and built between 1600 and 1750. Most were initially constructed with bamboo and nipa, but the friars realized that to instill a sense of awe, as well as to caution against the terrible menace of fire and earthquake, more grandiose buildings had to be erected. In spite of\n\ntechnical and material limitations, they managed to build massive structures that often took years, even decades to complete, that have survived to the present.\n\nBahay na bato[edit] See also: Bahay na Bato\n\nBahay na Bato is a Filipino colonial house during the Spanish period.\n\nIn this era, the nipa hut or bahay kubo gave way to the Bahay na bato (stone house) and became the typical house of noble Filipinos. The Bahay na bato, the colonial Filipino house, followed the nipa hut's arrangements such as open ventilation and elevated apartments. The most obvious difference between the two houses would be the materials that was used to build them. The bahay na bato was constructed out of brick and stone rather than the traditional bamboo materials. It is a mixture of native Filipino, Spanish and Chinese influences. During the 19th century, wealthy Filipinos built some fine houses, usually with solid stone foundations or brick lower walls, and overhanging, wooden upper story with balustrades and capiz shell sliding windows, and a tiled roof. Excellent preserved examples of these houses of the illustrious Filipinos can be admired in Vigan, Ilocos Sur. Preserved examples of \"bahay na bato\" are also found in Taal, Batangas and Boac, Marinduque in southern Luzon, Iloilo, Iloilo and Carcar, Cebu in the Visayas, and Dapitan, Zamboanga del Norte. [12]\n\n[13]\n\nDuring World War II, many heritage districts and towns outside Metro Manila were heavily destroyed and damaged by American and Japanese bombs. Reports of deliberate burning of colonial structures by Japanese soldiers were also rampant. Most destroyed or damaged heritage structures have never been restored and now lay in ruins or have been replaced with shanty houses or concrete structures with no significant architectural aesthetics. Many scholars have championed for Japan and America's accountability for the destruction of many Filipino architectural landscapes and towns, but to no avail.\n\nIntramuros[edit]\n\nDefensive walls of Intramuros.\n\nIntramuros is the old walled city of Manila along the south bank of the Pasig River. Intramuros was established from the remains of Kota Seludong which is previously the seat of the power of Kingdom of Maynila, as a settlement with a fortress of rammed earth with stockades and in between battlements there are cannons. The historic city was home to centuries-old churches, schools, convents, government buildings and residences, the best collection of Spanish colonial architecture before much of it was destroyed by the bombs of World War II. Of all the buildings within the 67-acre city, only one building, the San Agustin Church, survived the war. [14]\n\n[15]\n\nFort Santiago[edit] Fort Santiago (Fuerza de Santiago) is a defense fortress established by Spanish conquistador, Miguel López de Legazpi. The fort is the citadel of the walled city of Intramuros, in Manila. The location of Fort Santiago was also once the site of the palace and kingdom of Rajah Suliman, king of Maynila of pre-Spanish era. It was destroyed by the conquistadors upon arriving in 1570, encountering several bloody battles with the Muslims and native Tagalogs. The Spaniards destroyed the native settlements and erected Fuerza de Santiago in 1571. [16]\n\nChurches[edit] See also: Earthquake Baroque See also: Baroque Churches of the Philippines\n\nInterior of the San Agustín Churchwith magnificent trompe l'oeil mural on its ceiling and walls\n\nSan Agustín Church and Monastery, built between 1587 and 1606, is one of the oldest churches in the Philippines, and the only building left intact after the destruction of Intramuros during the Battle of Manila (1945). The order of the Augustinians, Augustinian Province of the Most Holy Name of Jesus of the Philippines, built many churches all over the Philippines. These magnificent structures can still be found throughout the Philippine Islands.The Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte is one of the most prominent types of these churches. This unique specimen of Filipino architecture from the Spanish era has been included in the World Heritage Sites List of the UNESCO. The church was built by the Augustinian friars from 1694 until 1710. It shows the earthquake-proof baroque style architecture. The bell tower served as an observation post in 1896 for the Katipuneros during the Philippine revolution against the Spaniards, and again by the Filipino guerillas during the Japanese occupation in World War II. [17]\n\nThe present structure is the third to stand on the site and has survived seven major earthquakes, and the wars in Manila. The church remains under the care of the Augustinians who founded it. The church also houses the legacies of the Spanish conquistadors, Miguel López de Legazpi, Juan de Salcedo and Martín de Goiti who are buried and laid to rest in a tomb, underneath the church. The church has 14 side chapels and a trompe-l'oeil ceiling. Up in the choir loft are the hand-carved 17th-century seats of molave, a beautiful tropical hardwood. Adjacent to the church is a small museum run by the Augustinian order, featuring antique vestments, colonial furniture, and religious paintings and icons. It was named a National Historical Landmark by the Philippine government in\n\n1976. Together with three other ancient churches in the country, it was designated as part of the World Heritage Site \"Baroque Churches of the Philippines\" in 1993. [18]\n\nAmerican period[edit]\n\nThe National Museum of Anthropology is a neoclassical buildingbuilt during the American period.\n\nWith the arrival of the Americans in 1898 came a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. Foremost of the American contributions to the country was the establishment of civil government. This led to the erection of government buildings from the city all the way to the municipal level. Designed in the most respectable manner, these government houses resembled Greek or Roman architecture. [19]\n\nThe revival period, popular at the turn of the century, became the foremost architectural parlance of the era as seen in such buildings particularly in Manila. Education of the masses also became the thrust of the American occupation, as such, public education was established, foremost of which is the University of the Philippines. With American rule firmly established in the Philippines, the military government at the time invited the well-known architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham to develop Manila. Burnham’s arrival led to the formation of the Burnham Plan which identifies the city of Manila as a uniquely European city in the tropics and as such opposed to develop its architecture in line with the existing style. The style of architecture, as suggested, varies little from existing architecture at the time as typified by the Manila Hotel. New structures continued the use of conventional motifs but were made of more durable materials such as concrete. This style of architecture prevailed even after the turn of the century. [citation needed]\n\n[20]\n\n[21]\n\nThe Silliman Hall in Dumaguete, an example of a Stick style American architecture\n\nThe Luneta Hotel, located in Kalaw Avenue, is one of the remaining structures that survived the liberation of Manila in 1945. The hotel was completed in 1918. According to Dean Joseph Fernandez of the University of Santo Tomas, the hotel was designed by the Spanish architect-engineer Salvador Farre. The structure is the only remaining example of the French Renaissance architecture with Filipino stylized Beaux-Arts architecture in the Philippines to date.\n\nAt the Far Eastern University (FEU) in Quiapo, Manila, five Art Deco structures on the campus were designed by National Artist Pablo Antonio. Three were built before World War II and two, after. Although FEU buildings were totally damaged during the war, the university was restored to its original Art Deco design immediately after. The university was given a UNESCO Asia PacificHeritage Award for Cultural Heritage in 2005 for the outstanding preservation of its Art Deco structures. [22]\n\nArt Deco buildings[edit] See also: Art Deco theaters of Manila The Manila Metropolitan Theater.\n\nDuring the rise of cinema in the Philippines as a form of recreation, several theaters were constructed in the 1930s to 1950s in the Art Deco style designed by prominent architects now recognized as National Artists. The Manila Metropolitan Theater is an Art Deco building designed by the Filipino architect Juan M. Arellano, and built in 1935. Another fine example of Art Deco is the old Jaro Municipal Hall in Iloilo built in 1934 by Filipino architect Juan M. Arellano. It later became the Jaro District Police Station and after the full restoration is now the regional branch office of the National Museum. During the liberation of Manila by the combined American and Flipino troops in 1945, the theatre was totally destroyed. After reconstruction by the Americans it gradually fell into disuse in the 1960s. In the following decade it was meticulously restored but again fell into decay. The sculptures upon the façade of the theater are by Italian sculptor Francesco Riccardo Monti, who lived in Manila from 1930 until his death in 1958, and worked closely with Juan M. Arellano. Highly stylized relief carving of Philippine plants executed by the artist Isabelo Tampingco decorate the lobby walls and interior surfaces of the building. The following are the Philippine architects who contributed and lead to the design of the classic Philippine theaters:   \n\nJuan Nakpil, a Philippine national artist for Architecture Pablo Antonio Juan M. Arellano\n\nEl fraile island \"The concrete battleship\"[edit]\n\nFort Drum built by the Americans to guard the Islands nearby against invaders.\n\nThe El Fraile Island or Fort Drum, also known as \"the concrete battleship,\" is a heavily fortified island situated at the mouth of Manila Bay in the Philippines, due south of Corregidor Island. The reinforced concrete fortress shaped like a battleship was built by the United States in 1909 as one of the harbor defenses at the wider South Channel entrance to the bay during the American colonial period. It was captured and occupied by the Japanese during World War II, and was recaptured by the U.S. after igniting petroleum and gasoline in the fort, leaving it permanently out of commission.\n\nIglesia ni Cristo churches[edit] Main article: Iglesia ni Cristo\n\nDuring American colonial rule over the Philippines, there were a variety of rural anticolonial movements, often with religious undertones, and American Protestant missionaries introduced several alternatives to the Roman Catholic Church, the established church during Spanish colonial period. [23]\n\n[24]\n\nThe Iglesia ni Cristo is an international Christian religion that originated in 1914. Their church buildings primarily serve as places of worship and are used for other religious functions. These churches were described as structures \"which employ exterior neo-Gothic vertical support columns with tall narrow windows between, interlocking trapezoids, and rosette motifs, as well as tower and spires.\" There are multiple entrances leading to the main sanctuary, where males and females sit on either side of the aisle facing a dais where sermons are made. The choir loft is located behind the dais, and in larger churches, baptistry pools for immersion baptism are located at the back of the church. [25]\n\nMeanwhile, Fernando Nakpil-Zialcita, an anthropologist from Ateneo de Manila University, said that INC churches can be uniquely identified for \"its exuberant use of fanciful forms and ornaments [and a] brilliant white facade whose silhouette is a cusped Gothic arch or a flattened Saracenic arch. The distinctive spires represent \"the reaching out of the faithful to God.\" Churches were started to be built in this style during the late 1940s and early 1950s with the first concrete chapel built in Sampaloc, Manila in 1948. [26]\n\nThe INC Central Temple which opened in July 27, 1984, can accommodate up to 7,000 persons, and cost about US$2 million. The Central Temple features octagonal spires, \"fine latticework\" and ribbed windows. Recent buildings are variations of Carlos A. Santos-Viola's designs on the Central Temple. These are designed to accommodate 250 to 1,000 persons while larger churches in Metro Manila and provincial capitals can accommodate up to 3,000 persons. Prominent architects, such as Juan Nakpil (a National Artist of the Philippines for architecture) and Carlos Raúl Villanueva, had been involved in designing INC churches while the Engineering and Construction Department of INC oversees the uniformity in design of church buildings. [27]\n\n[25]\n\nModern period[edit] The aftermath of World War II brought major destruction especially in the capital city of Manila and a time of rebuilding ensued. The modern era dawned on Philippine architecture using the simple straight lines of the International Modern Style as a chief mode of expression. By the 1970s, a new form of Philippine architecture emerged with the filipinization of architecture. The Filipino style found its way in the re-emergence of traditional motifs, the Bahay Kubo and the Bahay na bato became popular forms to be copied and modernized such as the Batasang Pambansa and the National Theater. By the 1980s the country’s architectural idiom was swept by the tide of Post Modernism, a hearkening back of some sort to classical architecture. Today, architecture in the Philippines continue to be vibrant and with the country opening up to the world, more first rate architecture is pouring in. [12]\n\n[28]\n\n[28]\n\nCultural Center of the Philippines Complex[edit]\n\nCultural Center of the Philippines.\n\nThe Cultural Center of the Philippines Complex is home to the National Theater (Tanghalang Pambansa). The theater is the centerpiece of the 77 hectare (190 acres) arts and culture complex located along Roxas Boulevard in Manila. Designed by Leandro V. Locsin, the construction of the National Theater began in 1966 and was completed in 1969. The theater is a primary example of the architect's signature style known as the floating volume, a trait can be seen in structures indigenous to the Philippines such as the nipa hut. It houses three performing arts venues, one theater for film screenings, galleries, a museum and the center's library and archives. [29]\n\nThe façade of the National Theater is an example of Brutalist architecture, it is dominated by a twostorey travertine block suspended 12 meters (39 ft) high by deep concave cantilevers on three sides. The building is built on a massive podium, and entry is through a vehicular ramp in front of the raised lobby and a pedestrian side entry on its northwest side. In front of the National Theater and below the ramp, there is an octagonal reflecting pool with fountains and underwater lights. Aside from the National Theater, other structures located inside the CCP Complex is the Tanghalang Nicanor Abelardo or the Main Theater, Tanghalang Aurelio Tolentino or the Little Theater, Folks Art Theater and the Manila Film Center. The Parish of the Holy Sacrifice is the landmark Catholic chapel in the University of the Philippines Diliman. Known for its architectural design, the church is recognized as a National Historical Landmark and a Cultural Treasure by the National Historical Institute and the National Museum respectively. Five National artists collaborated on the project. The building was designed by the late National Artist for Architecture, Leandro Locsin. Alfredo Juinio served as the structural engineer for the project. Around the chapel are fifteen large murals painted by Vicente Manansala depicting the Stations of the Cross. The marble altar and the large wooden cross above it were sculpted by Napoleon Abueva. The mosaic floor mural called the “River of Life” was designed by Arturo Luz.\n\nAntipolo Church[edit] The image of \"Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage\" has been venerated in the church of Antipolo for centuries. The old church that housed the virgin was destroyed in February 1945 when the Americans bombed Antipolo as part of the liberation campaign of Manila. In 1954, a new church was built designed by the renowned Filipino architect Jose de Ocampo. The Antipolo Church is of a cupolaed design centered around the image of the Virgin. It functions as the center point of the pilgrimages to Antipolo.\n\nIloilo Convention Center[edit]\n\nThe Iloilo Convention Center.\n\nThe Iloilo Convention Center (also known as ICC or I-Con) is a state-of-the-art convention center in the Iloilo Business Park in Mandurriao, Iloilo City, Philippines. Its construction was completed in September 2015 in time for the APEC 2015 hosting. It is built on a 1.7-hectare of lot in the district of Mandurriao donated by the Megaworld Corp. The Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority allocated P200 million for the construction of the convention center, while another P250 million was sourced from the Priority Development Assistance Fund of Senator Franklin Drilon. [30]\n\n[31]\n\nThe state-of-the-art convention center designed by Ilonggo architect, William Coscolluela. The design was inspired by Iloilo’s Dinagyang and Paraw Regatta festivals. The paraw is a native double outrigger sailboat in the Visayas region, used in the annual Paraw Regatta Festival sailboat race. Abstract designs of the famous Dinagyang Festival are featured on the glass walls of the center. It is a two-storey structure with a total floor area of 11,832 square meters. The main hall on the ground floor has a 3,700-seat capacity and 500-seat function rooms on the second floor. A rooftop of 1,500 sqm is available for outdoor functions. [32]\n\n[31]\n\nUnited Architects of the Philippines[edit]\n\nSkyscrapers such as the One McKinley Place are seen in places like Makati and Bonifacio Global City\n\nThe United Architects of the Philippines or UAP is the Official Voice for Architects throughout the country. The UAP was formed through the “unification” of three architectural organizations: the Philippine Institute of Architects, The League of Philippine Architects and the Association of Philippine Government Architects. It became the Bonafide Professional Organization of Architects upon receiving Accreditation Number 001 from the Professional Regulation Commission. Thus, UAP was the first professional organization recognized by the Republic. With the passing of the new architecture law or Republic Act No. 9266, UAP becomes the IAPOA or the Integrated Accredited Professional Organization of Architects. In 2014 they gave their highest award, the Likha Gold Medal Award, to Yolanda Reyes, who was the first woman to receive this award. [33]\n\nNotable Filipino architects[edit] \n\nLeandro V. Locsin (1928–1994) was one of the modern architects who shaped the modern Filipino Architecture. During his career, he built five churches, over 30 different buildings, over 70 residences, and major landmarks in the Philippines including the Cultural Center of the Philippines. Carlos A. Santos-Viola was an architect who built churches all over the Philippines. Juan Carlos Eugene Soler is the only Filipino to win the prestigious Glass Architectural Design Competition in Tokyo, Japan (2009). Jaime Anthony N. Cruz a landscape architect who is currently based in China and the only one Filipino to design for the World Garden Expo 3013 in Liaoning. He designed the Mabuhay Islands in the said expo. [34]\n\n \n\n[35]\n\n[36]\n\n\n\nPHILIPPINE ARCHITECTURE The history and culture of the Philippines are reflected in its architectural heritage, in the dwellings of its various peoples, in mosques and churches, and in buildings that have risen in response to the demands of progress and the aspirations of a people. Houses and monuments from Batanes to Tawi-Tawi do not only represent different cultures and periods in Philippine history; they also constitute the Filipino’s creative response to the problems posed by the geography and climate of the archipelago. The 7,100 islands of the Philippines appear to be a mountain range that is half submerged. More than half of the land is mountainous and hilly. With their headwaters in the mountains, rivers flow down to the plains and out to the sea. For its relatively small area of 300,000 square kilometers, the country has an extensive coastline of 17,500 kilometers. On this fragmented territory and rugged terrain, on mountain, plain, riverbank, and seacoast, the people have made their home. With its southernmost islands about four degrees from the equator, and its northern and central islands in the path of typhoons, the Philippines is subject to the worst of tropical heat, humidity, and rain. A long dry season can bring drought, rains can cause floods, and high winds can ruin houses. Several times a year the land is rocked by earthquakes. As the climate dictates the need for shelter, the land provides the materials for it: wood from the forests, bamboo from groves, leaves from the fields, stone from rivers and quarries, and clay from the earth itself. Setting, climate, and available materials are among the factors that give shelter its form and character.\n\nThe Ethnic Tradition The earliest shelters of human beings were probably not built by them. They simply found these shelters or found themselves in them. It was nature which fashioned hollows on cliffs and mountainsides that offered protection from heat, rain, and wind. In Angono, Rizal, evidence of ancient cave dwellers exists in carved figures on cave walls, the earliest known Philippine mural. The Tabon Cave in Palawan yielded the earliest-known remains of human beings in the Philippines. Meanwhile, the food gatherers, the fishers, or the hunters, who moved from one place to another in their search for food and game, needed a portable shelter. Thus they fashioned the lean-to from a frame made of tree branches\n\nand twigs, using leaves and fronds for sidings. A screen resting on the ground and held up at an angle by one or several poles, the lean-to is both roof and wall, protecting dwellers from rain and the heat of the sun. The floor can be the ground itself or a bed of leaves or a platform slightly above the ground. The lean-to is light enough to be carried to another site. However, the dweller can simply abandon it and build another. A pair of lean-tos can be joined together to form a tentlike shelter or a double-slope roof, which, in effect, is the beginning of a house. Kaingin or swidden farming led to a relatively settled life. After making a clearing in the forest, the swidden farmer could cultivate it for two years, let it lie fallow, then return to it a few years later. Although dwellings became larger and were better built, they were neither permanent nor durable because sometimes the swidden farmer had to move on. With the development of wet-rice culture, farmers became rooted to the land. Although braces of the kaingin lifestyle persisted in the makeshift character of various dwellings, houses were built to last. The Mangyan of Mindoro, who are swidden farmers, have two types of houses—the single-family dwelling and the communal house. Although the communal house is occupied by several families, its interior is not divided by partitions. The area for each family is defined by a mat on the floor. When a Mangyan house is built on a slope, the entrance faces the rise. The steep roof is of cogon grass, the sidings, of tree bark, and the floor, of logs and saplings. The house appears to have no windows. However, it has a narrow strip of opening between roof and wall. For added protection from floods, wild animals, and enemies, houses were built on trees, anywhere from 2 to 20 meters above the ground. Such houses have been found among the Ilongot, Tinguian, and Gaddang in northern Luzon, and among the Mandaya, Manobo, Tiruray, and Bukidnon in Mindanao. One type of tree house nestles on the branches of a tree. Another type rests partly on a tall tree stump and partly on a cluster of tall stilts. The people of the Cordilleras in northern Luzon are swidden farmers. But some, particularly the Ifugao, Bontoc, and Kalinga, are known for their rice terraces. With massive, towering walls and a skillfully devised irrigation system, the rice terraces are a wonder of primitive engineering. The terrace builders constructed sturdy dwellings remarkable for both simplicity and ingenuity. The one-room Ifugao house, known as fale, is a little marvel of construction. Outside, the Ifugao house seems to be nothing more than a pyramid resting on four posts. The interior space—enclosed by slanting walls, sloping roof, and ceiling formed by the loft—appears nearly spherical. The dark, windowless chamber suggests a womb. Four wooden posts rest on a pavement and support two wooden girders which, in turn, support three wooden transverse joists. On the posts are wooden discs that prevent rats from entering the house. The ladder is drawn up at night or is hung across the front when the occupants are away. The floor joists, floor sills, vertical studs, and horizontal beams at about head level form a cage that rests on the posts and girders. Floor boards are fitted between the joists. Wooden sidings slant outward and rise to waist height to form the lower half of the wall. The upper half of the wall is formed by the inner side of the roof. Boards flanking the front and rear doors rise to the beams. The rafters of the roof rest on the beams and extend downward close to floor level. The roof frame is sheathed with reedlike runo, then covered with thatch. At an inner corner of the house is the fireplace. At the level of the beam is a storage loft with a floor of runo stalks. The wooden parts of this house are joined by rabbeting and by mortise and tenon. Other parts are fastened by lashing. Since nails are not used, the house can easily be dismantled, carried to a new site, and reassembled. The solitary room is the sleeping room, kitchen, dining room, storeroom, and shrine for rituals. Only the husband and wife and youngest child or children in infancy live in this house. Upon reaching the age of reason, sons and daughters sleep in separate communal dormitories.\n\nNext to this house stands its twin, a granary with the same design as the house. In Mayaoyao the Ifugao house is distinguished by its classic simplicity. Its roof is high and steep. Low stone walls and a pavement form the setting of this house. With the smooth, fine-grained hardwood posts, rat guards are not necessary. The elevated living space in the fale becomes a granary in the Bontoc house, as the living quarters move down to ground level. A low wall encloses the ground floor. The fourposttwo-girderthree-joist structure of the Ifugao is also used in the Bontoc house. The Sagada house resembles the Bontoc house but is fully covered. It is a wooden box with a steep thatch roof as a lid. With the granary within, the Sagada house is a “house within a house.” The Kankanay house is still another variation of the Ifugao prototype. The roof is higher and wider, thereby providing a spacious loft above the living space. On the ground level wooden planks are laid to provide additional livable space. The Ibaloy house has a larger room, a flaring roof, and a small porch. Some of the Kalinga live in octagonal houses. The central portion of the octagonal house rests on a four-post-two-girder-and-three-joist structure. Beyond this frame eight posts are added to form the eight sides of the house. Wooden laths resting on joists support the runo floor, which can be rolled up like a mat and taken to the river for washing. Boat forms appear to have inspired the Isneg house. The bamboo roof suggests an inverted boat, and wooden floor joists have the profile of a boat. The Isneg house has two sets of posts: the inner set supporting the floor and the outer set supporting the roof. As in the Kalinga house, the floor can be rolled up. The walls are vertical boards set into grooves that are cut into beams at floor and roof-eaves level. A window is created by simply taking out a few boards. All the wall boards can be removed to make the house a roofed platform for village celebrations. The Isneg house is the largest among the Cordillera houses, since the entire family, and even married offspring, could live in it. It is not known when and how Cordillera houses developed into their present forms. However, these house forms developed in isolation and were untouched by Western influence, for the Spanish colonizers did not succeed in bringing the region and its people under their rule. On hilltops and rolling land, the Tboli of southern Cotabato in Mindanao build large one-room houses on stilts. The roof is of dried grass, the walls, of woven bamboo, and the posts, of whole bamboo and, occasionally, tree stumps. The central portion of the floor is slightly lower than the areas around it. The side sections are for working or resting. At one end is the entrance and the fireplace, and at the other is the place of honor for the head of the house. The interior of the Tboli house is one example of a characteristic feature of Philippine houses-space surrounded by space. Islam was established in Sulu in the 14th century and in Mindanao in the 15th century. The combination of a strong, organized religion and a high degree of political organization enabled the Muslim people of Mindanao to resist Spain’s attempts to bring them under her dominion. The Tausug of Sulu, one of the Muslim peoples of the Philippines, are known as seafarers, but they build their houses on land, away from the shore. A site is considered lucky if it is flat and dry or if it gently slopes westward—towards Mecca. The traditional Tausug house rests on nine posts, each signifying a part of the body—the neck, navel, groin, left and right sides of the shoulders, ribs, and hips. Basically a one-room house, the Tausug dwelling includes a porch and a separate kitchen. A distinguishing feature of the house is an elaborately carved wooden finial, called tajuk pasung, placed at one or both ends of the roof ridge. The Sama and the Badjao are people of the sea. The sea is their source of livelihood, the link to other people, and the place for celebration. It is also home. The Sama build their houses on stilts over the water, along the shore or farther out, grouped together in villages, and connected by bridges and catwalks. Unlike the Sama house, the Badjao landhouse stands alone on an expanse of water and is\n\nreached only by boat. It is not joined by bridges or catwalks to the shore or to other houses. It is an island made by humans. Among the Muslim Filipinos, there arose two institutions which did not develop among the other ethnic peoples, namely, a specific place for worship and the lordly residence of the ruler. The earliest mosque in the Philippines is said to have been built in 1380 in Simunul Island, TawiTawi. Mosques in the Philippines follow the traditional Middle East design which includes an onionshaped dome and minarets. However, some mosques are closer to indigenous architecture, with a multitiered roof resembling that of a pagoda. The Muslim chief resides in the torogan, a huge, stately, towering house, with a single large room. Although “torogan” simply means a place for sleeping, the house is more than a residence. It is also used for official meetings, social gatherings, and religious rituals. Only the chief—the sultan or datu—is entitled to own and live in a torogan. The soaring, flaring roof, like a ceremonial umbrella, is a proclamation of exalted status. The massive posts serve as solid supports and signify established power. To protect the house from earthquakes, the oversized posts rest on stones. With this device, the house sways with the tremor, playfully surviving it. Posts may be plain and bulky or may be carved to look like clay pots or outsized chess pieces. The most arresting feature of the torogan is the set of protruding beam-ends, called panolong. Flaring out from the facade, intricately carved, and stunningly colored, the panolong resemble the boat prows and make the splendid torogan appear to float like a royal barge. For all the variety of design and construction, Cordillera, Mindanao, and Sulu houses are basically one-room dwellings covered by steep roofs and raised on stilts. They are all related to the bahay kubo (nipa hut) which in its simplicity is regarded as a prototype. Largely of bamboo and thatch, and with parts woven, fitted or tied together, the bahay kubo might be described as less of a building and more of a basket. While posts, beams, and joists are assembled, the roof is put together separately and later fitted on top like the lid of a basket. The bamboo floor, with its slats set slightly apart, is like the bottom of a basket and makes for incomparable ventilation. With air coming in through windows and floor and the crevices in thatch and bamboo walls, the bahay kubo is a house that breathes. Houses take an entirely different form in the Batanes, the northernmost islands of the archipelago. With the frequency of high winds and strong rain, the Batanes house is built to hug the ground. Thick stone walls and a thick grass roof withstand the severest storm. The roof is supported by posts encased in the stone walls. Stone and mortar construction was introduced in the Batanes islands during the Spanish regime The Spanish Colonial Tradition With cross and sword, Spain extended her empire to the Philippines in the 16th century. The Spanish colonizers settled in Cebu in 1565. Since Miguel Lopez de Legazpi had been instructed to establish more settlements and since sources of food in Cebu were inadequate, the Spaniards moved northward to Luzon, which was more extensive in area and more fertile. In 1571 the Spaniards conquered Manila. Strategically located on the shore of a bay and at the mouth of a river, Manila was eminently suitable for defense, administration, and trade. The Spaniards occupied the fort that had been abandoned by Raja Soliman, ruler of Manila. In time, the wooden palisades gave way to fortifications of stone and a Spanish city took shape, following the prescriptions issued by King Philip II in 1573. The city was provided with a principal plaza and secondary plazas. Streets were laid out in a gridiron pattern. Around the main plaza rose the cathedral, government buildings, and the houses of ranking persons. Manila became the capital of the colony and the model for town development. It was the geographic center of the colony, for the cross on the dome of the cathedral was the point from\n\nwhich distances were measured. With the influx of colonial officials, friars, missionaries, and traders, Manila became the center of political, religious, and economic power. In the early years of their settlement in Manila, the Spaniards built churches and houses of wood and bamboo, but these were destroyed by fire. It became necessary to scout around for fireproof material. With the discovery of volcanic tuff quarries in San Pedro, Makati, in the 1580s, the Spaniards began to construct dwellings, churches, and fortifications in stone. Antonio Sedeño, a Jesuit priest and engineer, trained local workmen in the art of building with stone. Probably the oldest existing stone building in the Philippines is the San Agustin Church which has survived all earthquakes from the 17th century to the present. It is said to rest on an inverted vault foundation that makes it float, so to speak, during earthquakes. In general, Spanish construction in the Philippines—fortresses, churches, and civic buildings— faithfully followed European models, especially when projects were closely supervised by Spaniards. To facilitate the work of Church and State, specifically the preaching of the gospel and the administration of the colony, towns were established and the scattered population was brought together in compact communities or reducciones. Missions and parishes were founded and churches were built. The church was built at the center of the town by the town plaza. It had its own plaza surrounded by a catenated or swayback wall. Shrines called capillas posas stood at each corner of the churchyard or around the church site. Adjacent to the church was the convento, the residence of the parish priest. The church of the colonial era is generally rectangular or cruciform in plan. Its walls are high and thick and are supported by buttresses. Windows are usually small. Its large size and massive construction made the church a suitable place of refuge for the townspeople during pirate raids or natural calamities. Bell towers served as watchtowers. Churches were made of adobe (volcanic tuff ) stone, coral stone, or brick. In some churches brick and adobe were combined. A wall could consist of alternate courses of brick and adobe, or blocks of brick and adobe in a checkerboard pattern. In the Tumauini Church, bricks were molded with ornaments on them and were numbered to guide the bricklayers in assembling them. Cementing bricks and/or stone together was a mortar prepared from various recipes, and using different combinations of ingredients, like lime, crushed coral, crushed shells, molasses, sugar cane juice, goat’s blood, carabao milk, egg shells, and egg white. The Philippine colonial church may be described as a plain stone box with a decorated front. The rear and side walls are plain. However, a side portal, which repeats decorative motifs of the facade, breaks the monotony. The facade often has a monopoly of exterior ornament. Columns and cornices traverse the front wall vertically and horizontally. Niches, blind arches, blind balustrades, and low relief carvings give depth, texture, and a certain cheerfulness to vast, solid expanses of wall. The ornaments may be in the classic tradition—Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, baroque, or rococo. There are occasionally gothic, romanesque, or moorish trefoil arches. The native touch is evident in the unorthodox use of classical ornaments or in the introduction of local motifs. Facades outstanding for their ornamentation are those of the Miag-ao Church in Iloilo, which depicts St. Christopher carrying the Infant Jesus amid lush tropical vegetation, and of the San Joaquin Church, which shows the surrender of Tetuan in low relief. Early churches were of wood and bamboo, so they easily caught fire. Then stone churches were built, but with earthquakes, they caved in. Later, stone churches were provided with buttresses that came in various shapes: flat and thin, massive and rectangular, sloping, stepped, saw-toothed, barrel-shaped or curved. Bell towers vary in design as well as in location. In plan, the bell tower may be square, octagonal, hexagonal or, in rare instances, circular. In height, it may rise from three to five stories. It may be at some distance from the church, adjacent to\n\nit, or integrated in the facade. Some churches have two towers, a few have three. When the bell tower is attached to the church, its ground floor houses the baptistry. In the past, these churches were called Spanish, probably because they were designed by Spanish friars who were missionaries or parish priests, and the designs could have been based on pictures of European churches or on one’s recollection of a European church. But more and more the Filipino character of these churches has become apparent; for local artisans—native or Chinese—did not always execute the classical ornaments or the baroque or neoclassic designs according to the rules, but interpreted them according to their own skill, imagination, and taste. Thus whether instructed or so inspired, the artisans often incorporated local motifs—flowers and fruits or even a crocodile’s head into church ornaments. In these designs, local artisans expressed something of their spirit—their simplicity and lightheartedness, and their love for abundance. The 19thcentury townhouse, called bahay na bato (stone house), was a product of economic and social developments, as well as of architectural evolution. With the opening of Manila to international trade in 1834 and the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869, trade and agricultural production rose to exhilarating heights and increased the fortunes of the native aristocracy, particularly in the provinces. Wealth became the passport to higher education not only in Manila but also in Europe. The elite or principalia included landowners and traders, as well as professionals—physicians and accountants—and the highly educated, cosmopolitan ilustrado. The lifestyle, aspirations, and even pretensions, of the upper class demanded a new type of dwelling that was spacious, durable, comfortable, impressive, noble, and elegant—the bahay na bato. Several house forms contributed to the emergence of the bahay na bato. One of its ancestors is the bahay kubo, which in itself might not have been a worthy dwelling for the ilustrado, but whose principles of design were too practical to be ignored. The steep hip roof, elevated quarters, post-and-lintel construction, and maximized ventilation are features of the bahay kubo that appear in grand style in the bahay na bato. A second ancestor may have been the native chieftain’s house described by Antonio de Morga in the 17th century, which was elevated, sturdily built of timber, well-furnished, and spacious, having many rooms. A third influence may have been the houses of the Spanish residents of Intramuros, who combined the native and the foreign styles of building in their two-story houses with wooden posts and beams, stone walls around the ground floor, and timber construction above. Finally, another model for the bahay na bato may have been the convento, rectory, or monastery built adjacent to the mission church, an authoritative presence in the center of the town which must have antedated the bahay na bato. Extravagantly spacious and solidly built, it could have become the local standard for grandeur. In general, the bahay na bato may be described as a house with wooden legs and a stone skirt, a style of construction which makes the house a sure survivor of earthquakes. The wooden frame gives it both flexibility and stability, while the onestory high stone wall is less likely to collapse. Large wooden posts are sunk into the ground but stand high enough to carry the roof. The posts are independent of both the stone wall below and the wooden walls above. Because they are of exceptionally precious hardwood, they are worth displaying. The living quarters are elevated and are reached through an interior stairway located in the zaguan on the ground floor. The zaguan, with its naked stonework, is a grim entrance hall but, with its abundant space, is the perfect storeroom for just about everything. The stairs are not only a means of access but also the setting for a stately arrival. A surrounding balustrade detached from the wall provides room all around for welcoming committees and prolonged farewells. The stairs lead up to the caida (upper entrance hall). Opening to the caida is the sala (living room). Bedrooms flank the sala and nearby is the dining room. At the rear of\n\nthe house are the kitchen and, next to it, the open-air azotea. Running along the front and sides of the house and flanking the major rooms is the volada, a gallery which protects the rooms from the heat of the sun. Along the volada is an elaborate system of windows. The broad, massive window sill is grooved and holds two sets of sliding shutters: a set of capiz or oyster shell shutters, or a set of glass-paned shutters, and a set of shutters with louvers or jalousies. Between the window sill and the floor runs the ventanilla, with sliding wooden shutters and iron grills or wooden balusters. Wide double doors are flung open to join each room to adjacent rooms. With all doors open, the house becomes one big hall. The interior of the bahay na bato is a striking example of space surrounded by space. Running above the partitions are panels of wooden fretwork, which allow the air within the house to circulate. The bahay na bato represents the apex in the development of indigenous Filipino architecture, because it expands the prototypal structure of the ethnic house from a one-room dwelling to a multiroomed house of grand scale while preserving the basic features, and because it adapts Western architectural influences to form a synthesis of native and immigrant art. The bahay na bato is a product of economic progress and cultural adaptation, and as such is a symbol of the affluent westernized Filipino. It stands as a reminder of the social situation in which it evolved, a situation which has not significantly changed even with the introduction of democracy, public education, and free enterprise. The Spanish colonial era witnessed not only the construction of churches and civic buildings and the evolution of the bahay na bato, but also the rise of the first important architects in Philippine history. While most of the churches in the provinces were planned and designed by the friars, the bahay na bato were probably the result of architectural collaboration between the homeowner, the master carpenter, and the chief mason. There were, however, professional architects who were active in the 19th century, particularly in Manila. Luciano Oliver, a Spaniard, designed the Taal Church, the Malabon Church, and the 1872 Manila Cathedral. Felix Roxas Sr., considered the first Filipino architect, trained abroad and was renowned for his revivalist designs. His works included the neogothic Santo Domingo Church and the neoclassic San Ignacio Church, both in Intramuros, and a number of elegant houses for the upper class of Manila. Juan Hervas, a Spaniard, active from the late 1880s to the early 1890s, designed the Tutuban Railroad Station, the Monte de Piedad Building, the old Assumption Convent on Herran Street and a number of houses. Arcadio Arellano, a trained maestro de obras (master builder), was appointed architectural adviser to Governor William Howard Taft in 1901 and is known for the gothic-revival house of the Hidalgo family and the art nouveau Bautista-Nakpil house. Genaro Palacios designed the prefabricated all-steel San Sebastian Church in the 1880s. In the middle of the 19th century, Bartolome Palatino, a noted citizen of the wood-carving town of Paete, designed and built the splendid facade of the church in Morong, Rizal, one of the finest examples of what can be called Filipino baroque.\n\nThe American Colonial and Contemporary Traditions With the occupation of the Philipines by the United States in 1898, a new phase of Philippine architectural history began. In accordance with America’s thrust towards establishing an American-style government, urban planning and architecture served the needs of secular education and public services. In 1904 American architect Daniel H. Burnham came to the Philippines to conduct a survey of Manila and Baguio to prepare development plans for both cities. Burnham was one of the architects of the 1893 Chicago Exposition which, under\n\nthe influence of the Beaux Arts School of Paris, revived the neoclassic style of architecture. Burnham admired the bahay na bato and the colonial churches for their practicality and charm, and suggested that they be models for future development. Burnham’s recommendations for the development of Manila included the establishment of a government center with streets radiating from it; the retention, cleaning, and improvement of the esteros or canals; the construction of a bayshore boulevard from Manila to Cavite; the development of parks and waterfronts, and the provision of sites for major public facilities, such as schools and hospitals. Among those assigned to implement the Burnham plan was American architect William E. Parsons. Parsons followed Burnham’s recommendation that a style of architecture be developed to suit the tropical climate. Parson’s major works include the Normal School (now Philippine Normal University), the Philippine General Hospital, the Manila Hotel, and theArmyNavy Club. These buildings and others of the early 20th century represented the thrust of American colonial policy in the Philippines—health, public education, free enterprise, and training in selfgovernment. In contrast to the romantic air of colonial architecture, early 20th century architecture in the Philippines was rational, functional, and seemingly plain.Young Filipinos who went or were sent to the United States for training in various fields included aspiring architects. They studied in American universities and institutes which were then under the influence of the Beaux Arts School of Paris. Among the US-trained Filipino architects of the early 20th century were Carlos Barreto, Antonio Toledo, Tomas Mapua, and Juan Arellano. They became exponents of the neoclassic style and designed buildings characterized by monumental scale and fidelity to tradition. Since they were employed in the government which was engaged in a nationwide building program, their influence on the architecture of the time was extensive. True to his classical training, Arellano designed the Manila Post Office Building and the Legislative Building following the canons of Graeco-Roman architecture. Although a disciplined classicist, Arellano experimented with romanticism and brilliantly succeeded in producing the Metropolitan Theater in 1931. With art deco motifs, stylized interpretation of native plants, and a variety of color and texture, the Metropolitan, even decades after its design, is a refreshing piece of architecture. In the early 20th century, new house forms developed. But the basic design was still the house on stilts. Following the tone set by Parsons and turning away from the ornaments of the bahay na bato, the suburban house called tsalet (chalet) was comfortably functional and, in many cases, plain. A prominent feature of the house was the front porch or the surrounding porch. Some houses were entered through an exterior L-shaped or T-shaped concrete or wooden stairway. The chalet was a simple, respectable house for those moving up to the middle class. Architecture for the technological age was anticipated by the prefabricated, all-steel structure of San Sebastian Church built in 1891, and by the University of Santo Tomas (UST) Main Building built in 1927, which is impressive not only for its monumental proportions but for its earthquake-proof construction. The latter consists of 24 separate sections with soft material, like tar, serving as cushions at the joints. During an earthquake, the walls do not crack, having been precracked, as it were. The all-steel church and the earthquake-proof building foreshadowed further technological developments in construction, specifically, more extensive use of steel, daring structural design, and more imaginative use of reinforced concrete. While the first generation of 20th-century Filipino architects firmly held on to tradition, the succeeding generation broke away from it and introduced a new style. The 1930s were a time for looking forward more confidently to national independence. The period marked the emergence of the Filipino business magnate, who rose from rags to riches in the heady atmosphere of free enterprise. The developing\n\neconomy demanded new types of buildings like commercial office buildings, hotels, apartments, movie houses, and homes for the upper class. Into this environment of progress and experiment the young architects Andres Luna de San Pedro, Fernando Ocampo, Pablo Antonio, and Juan Nakpil made an auspicious entrance. Luna, son of painter and national hero Juan Luna, was an exponent of the art deco style. Among his existing works are the Perez-Samanillo Building on the Escolta. Ocampo likewise was notable for his art deco buildings, among them the Central Seminary of the UST. Nakpil’s early works in the art deco style include the Avenue Theater and Hotel Building and the Quezon Institute Buildings. Antonio’s works were marked by a certain boldness, the play of planes and volumes, and strong, dynamic movement. His works include the Far Eastern University Main Building, the Bel-Air Apartments on Roxas Boulevard, and the Ramon Roces Publications Building. Modern architecture in the Philippines was a departure from the neoclassic beaux arts tradition, but like the local neoclassic, it was still a product of foreign influence, a transplant from the west. While it was hailed as innovation, it was basically a new conformism to western trends. At the end of the World War II Manila was in ruins. The irreplaceable treasure that was Intramuros was reduced to rubble. The once magnificent government buildings were bombed-out shells. Hasty reconstruction resulted in makeshift structures with false fronts. The atrocities of war were followed by the atrocities of reconstruction. While the established architects resumed their practice, new graduates emerged in time for the building boom that followed the war. The neoclassic government buildings that lay in ruins were rebuilt following their original plans. New government and commercial buildings departed from the neoclassic and art deco of the previous decades and sought fresh inspiration in the work of contemporary Western architects. The sunbreak, made popular by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer, became the object of extensive and even irrational imitation. With the increased volume of construction, real estate development grew in scale and began to be planned more rationally. Upper-class and middle-class villages and state housing projects signified recognition of the need for planned communities. While early 20th-century Filipino houses had developed from indigenous architecture, postwar houses marked a departure from the native tradition. The break had been indicated earlier in the emergence of the two-story house in which living quarters occupied both first and second floors. In the bahay na bato, the living quarters were on the upper floor. The lower floor was a storage area. The tsalet of the early American regime followed the same scheme. The so-called Spanish-style house—with tile roofs, arches, and the indispensable three-story tower—began to appear in the 1930s and became the badge of the bourgeoisie for the next three decades. After the war came the one-story California bungalow, with picture windows, lanai (borrowed from Hawaii), and a two-to-three-car garage. This new status symbol represented the Americanization of the Filipino house. With the appreciation of things Philippine ushered in by the folk dance revival, the interest in various folk arts, and the rage for santos, antique furniture, and other colonial artifacts, many houses of contemporary style have looked back to native tradition, incorporating such features as steep-hip roofs, wooden lattices, capiz screens, and decorative woodwork, probably out of nostalgia or, hopefully, nationalism. In earlier years, low-cost urban housing was provided by the accesoria or woodenrowhouse, which survives in many old sections of Manila. Twostory units, each 3 to 4 meters wide, stood crowded together, with openings in front and at the back and, if fortunate, a small backyard. Government housing projects built after the war provided one-story, cement-block dwellings, either detached from or joined with others and set on small individual lots. With the Filipino penchant for remodelling, many of these pitifully plain units have metamorphosed into\n\ncharming examples of personalized architecture. Multistory tenements, an alternative response to the need for mass housing, were nothing more than rowhouses extended horizontally and vertically. The Bagong Lipunan Sites and Services (BLISS) houses, a legacy of the Marcos regime, are multiple-unit, multi-story buildings that take into account the decreasing availability of land. Even with the housing projects of the government, there are still not enough dwellings for the low-income group and the urban poor. The growth of the urban population, resulting from a high birth rate and uncontrolled migration from the rural areas, has exceeded the government’s capacity to provide adequate housing. Occupying whatever space is available—along railroad tracks, along or right over esteros, around garbage dumps, under bridges, along the seawall, inside abandoned buildings, on any unguarded vacant lot—the urban poor have built their rickety oneroom shanties using discarded materials, cardboard boxes, rusty roofing sheets, and rotten wood. Philamlife Homes in Quezon City, a fine example of middle-class housing built in the 1950s, was noteworthy for its simple yet attractive houses, many of which have been remodelled beyond recognition. Its well-planned site is distinguished by an organic layout; i.e., its streets follow the contour of the land. Upper-class residential architecture is represented by both sprawling houses on spacious gardens in the plush villages and the deluxe air-conditioned apartments in high-rise condominiums. Lower in the scale of luxury, the townhouses of the rising bourgeoisie are sophisticated versions of the urban rowhouse. Grandeur, or just plain bigness in architecture is a function of autocratic government or corporate omnipotence. The splendid architecture of Rome, for instance, was the work of the emperors, the popes, and Benito Mussolini. The skyscrapers of New York are glittering monuments to big business and imperialism. Martial law and the rule of the Marcoses was the setting of massive and monumental construction in Metro Manila never witnessed before in the country. The North Diversion Road, the South Superhighway, the Cultural Center of the Philippines (CCP) Main Building, the Manila Film Center, the Folk Arts Theater, the Philippine International Convention Center (PICC), the five-star hotels, the Batasang Pambansa, the Philippine Heart Center, the Lung Center, the Central Bank Buildings, the Philippine National Bank and Government Service Insurance System Buildings at the reclamation area, and the restoration of the walls and gates of Intramuros were all possible only under a monopoly of power maintained by extravagant spending for the sake of political impact. The rivalry for supremacy in business is evident in the ubiquitous malls, superbuildings that accommodate under one roof supermarkets, department stores, bookstores, boutiques, restaurants, movie houses, amusement centers, and drugstores. With land rising in value, the use of urban space is maximized through vertical expansion—upwards, with taller buildings, and downwards, with deeper multilevel basements. Until the 1950s the height of buildings was restricted by ordinance to 30 meters or about 10 stories. But since the development of Makati, high-rise buildings have exceeded that limit, going up to 20 floors and now going beyond 40. The coming of age in contemporary Philippine architecture is evident in such buildings as the National Press Club, Philamlife Home Office, Magsaysay Memorial, San Miguel Corporation Head Office, Twin Towers, Ritz Towers, Pacific Plaza, CCP Main Building, Philippine Plaza Hotel, PICC, Pacific Star, Meralco, Tahanang Pilipino, and many others constructed in the last 30 years. All these testify to the genius and maturity of their architects. It is no longer enough for architects to design efficiently organized and aesthetically satisfying space. They also have to take into account the complex technology that will go into it: elevator and escalator systems, air-conditioning, fire-protection systems, and computers. While adapting architecture\n\nto the demands of technology, architects realize that architecture must also be a reflection of culture and an embodiment of art.\n\nProspects for Filipino Architecture With Filipino architects becoming more at ease in the modern idiom and more aware of the Filipino’s search for cultural identity, they became more concerned with questions like: Is there such a thing as Filipino architecture? Were the works of Filipino architects mere imitationsof Western models? Would a modern Filipino architecture eventually develop? And the questions are valid. For the art and science of architecture is not only a response to human needs—the need for shelter, the need for order, the need for beauty, and the need for a sense of transcendence; it is also fundamentally a search for identity. The variety of houses and buildings that emerged through centuries of Philippine history, from one end of the archipelago to the other, yield common characteristics that should be considered by young architects concerned with a Philippine style of architecture. One feature of the Filipino house, and hence, of Filipino architecture, is the concept of space and the interrelation of different spaces like outdoor and indoor space, and the various areas of indoor space. An interior space is a space surrounded by space. Rooms open to adjacent rooms, or within a room, different spaces are created by means of levels or visual dividers. Space becomes a place for gathering or for solitude while remaining integrated. It is a function of personal relations. Also, in a tropical climate, a house must breathe. Thus transparency has become a feature of the Filipino house. It allows for cross ventilation or better circulation of air. Transparency also arises from the relation of spaces. Even when interior space is well covered and protected, the character of transparency is somehow expressed. Then there is the lightheartedness of the Filipino, which is reflected in the visual lightness of architecture. A structure appears to be a floating volume. Massive structures are treated in such a way that they look light. In addition, the Filipino—who lives in a lush, baroque landscape—seems not to be comfortable with empty space or plain, unadorned surfaces. Space has to be filled, or broken up, or at least, be the setting for texture. Lastly, the play of space, visual lightness, transparency of structure, and texture all contribute to a spirit of festivity, or better still, of tropical festivity. Filipinos love their fiestas, and architecture becomes one of their forms of celebration. But the search for form and the search for identity must also consider new conditions and directions. The vastly increased population demands that today’s architecture be concerned not only with the design of individual buildings, but with the design of communities. This means more than mass housing. It means creating communities that are economically self-sufficient, environmentally safe and healthy, and adequately provided with services, such as schools and hospitals. As the city dominates contemporary life and devours land for its infrastructure and megaprojects, will there still be space for every needy person to have a decent dwelling? Or shall one have to accept, as inevitable, living in one small compartment of an urban honeycomb? The single dwelling anchored to the ground signifies respect for the individuality of the occupant, while the multidwelling complex stresses the need for community. Architects are challenged to create the kind of dwelling that fosters one’s solidarity with the land and with neighbors. The larger task for architecture today is to create new communities for the poor and, in so doing, raise them from the inhumanity of poverty to a way of life worthy of their human dignity. Architecture for the poor will help to answer the long urgent need to redesign and transform the social order. • R.D. Perez III\n\nHistory of Philippine Architecture By Fudge Tajar January 24, 2015 16864\n\nUnderstanding the roots of Philippine architecture is an interesting adventure as you revisit your heritage and discover how the lives of Filipinos from different periods of our history were reflected through structures of houses, churches, mosques, temples, government buildings, cultural centers and many others. Just by reviewing our history as a nation, the Philippines is a melting pot\n\nof various cultures not just from its Western colonizers but even from its neighbors in Asia even before the Spaniards came. Our country’s history produced a conglomeration of architectural design which still exists at present.\n\nLet us trace our nation’s architectural history and characteristics through its five periods. Pre-Hispanic Era The earliest records of pre-colonial architecture in the Philippines are rock shelters and caves in Palawan. Early Filipinos are nomadic since they are constantly in search for food through hunting or fishing so they mainly rely on nature when creating shelter and do not need to build permanent structures. With the development of tools, tent-like shelters and tree houses were also created to serve as their abode. As farming became a stable source of food, the locals were accustomed to creating permanent structures to serve as their home. The houses of the natives before the Spanish colonization were predominantly rectangular in shape and built on stilts so it may be lifted and be transported to a new site. Several factors also affect the type of materials and configuration of houses such as the difference of climate and topography of numerous Filipino groups in different parts of the country. For instance, there are variations when it comes to pre-Hispanic houses of those from Ifugao, the bahay kubo (nipa hut) from the lowlands and the Maranao’s very intricate torogan house. Beautifully designed mosques were also widespread in the Mindanao region as early as 14th and 15th century due to the emergence of the Islamic religion even before the arrival of the conquistadores.\n\nThe Filipino bayanihan spirit is best exemplified in this painting by Carlos “Botong” Francisco where neighbors would help one another to carry a nipa hut and move to another place.

This type of architecture is European (but originated from Central America and not Spain) which was tweaked to suit the tropical climate of the Philippines and thereafter,\n\nhad its own Filipino and unique character. Aside from houses, Mother Spain also bestowed its influence on the architecture of churches, the symbolism of its major endowment in the Philippines, Catholicism.\n\nAntillean style of houses influenced by the Spanish colonizers in the Philippines. Source: archiandesigns.wordpress.com The most glorious colonial churches are still standing firm and most of them are found in the Visayan islands of Panay, Cebu and Bohol, Ilocos Regions, Southern Luzon particularly in Laguna and Batangas. According to architectural experts, most of the\n\ncolonial churches are Spanish or Mexican baroque based on the evident elements. It is also notable that the construction of these churches was mainly influenced by the environmental conditions of the country which would constantly experience natural disasters (typhoon and earthquake) and human destruction as well (fire and attacks) during that time.\n\nThe Miag-ao Church is a Roman catholic church located in Miag-ao, Iloilo, Philippines. The church’s over-all architectural style falls under the Baroque Romanesque architectural style. Its ochre color is due to the materials used in constructing the church, adobe, egg, coral and limestone. Source: commons.wikimedia.org\n\nOne thing that we must appreciate from these churches is how they were crafted with Asian Moorish style and elements. It is not well-known that during the Spanish period, Chinese and Muslim elements in architectural style became part of the Catholic Church structures. This is due to the fact that mostly Filipinos are inexperienced with the construction of stone buildings. Master builders and artisans who participated in the creation of the churches were Chinese and Muslims from the South. Chinese influence are shown through red air-dried bricks which were produced from a mixture of coral lime and/or loam and sugar cane juice and lion figures made of granite apparent in front of San Agustin Church. On the other hand, Moorish and Islamic style is\n\napparent in deeply incised relief carvings of church facades and its interior. We learned from Philippine History that there was obligatory construction work imposed on natives in non-Muslim areas during that period but most of them involved cutting, transporting and processing the materials to build the churches.\n\nMoorish carvings are very evident on this marvelous San Agustin Church door in Intramuros.

However, it became a short-lived liberty when the Americans became the country’s new invaders. There was a drastic change on the architectural design which was introduced by the Americans as they establish the civil government. A lot of structures were built to serve as government buildings from cities to municipalities. The design and style of the establishments were akin to Greek or Roman constructions.\n\nFamous American architects such as William Parsons and Edgar Bourne started the proto-modernist way of designing constructions and they were commonly unadorned facades together with large windows. Another prestigious master designer during that time was American architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham. He was the one responsible for creating the master plans for Manila and Baguio. His contributions to the local architecture together with Parsons were the Kahn system of concrete reinforcements and the introduction of hollow blocks, the use of anti-termite hardwood and the mass fabrication of building types.\n\nAmerican architecture influence in the Philippines can be classified in two types; the so-called first generation Filipino architects who studied architecture and engineering in the United States who were sponsored by the colonial masters and the Second generation architects who emerged in the late 1920s and 1930s.\n\nThe first generation exemplifies combined Beaux Arts elements with a touch of modernism promoting the ideas of utility in architecture.\n\nEl Hogar Filipino is a beaux-arts building, designed by architect Senior Ramon and buikt by the Pasig River on Muelle dela Industria street in Binondo.

Source: viscounts.megashot.net\n\nThe Japanese invasion during World War II lasted only for three years and did not bring any significant architectural change in the Philippines.\n\nThe Late Twentieth Century During this period in Philippine history starting in the 60’s architects started to merge modernist style with the use of traditional and local materials. And in the 70’s Former first Lady Imelda Marcos popularized a national architectural style through the regime’s ostentatious building projects using indigenous materials and icons.\n\nDesigned by Francisco Manosa, former First Lady Imelda Marcos spent 37 million pesos to build Coconut Palace as a government guest house and offered to Pope John Paul II during the Papal visit to the Philippines in 1981 but the Pope refused to stay there because it was too opulent given the level of poverty in the Philippines.

More micro-cities such as Rockwell Center and Fort Bonifacio Global City are developing. The Filipino architects nowadays are considered to be “late modernists” and eventually “neo-modernists” or “super modernists”.\n\nThe Gramercy Residences was planned and designed by California-based architectural group Jerde Partnership International, in collaboration with Philippine architectural firm Roger Villarosa Architects & Associates.
