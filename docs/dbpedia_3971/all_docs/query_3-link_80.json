The hotel's location is magnificent, set on a hillside overlooking the old city of Toledo but with easy access from the Autovia. Check in was a pleasant experience and later when we needed help printing our barding passes the guys on the desk certainly went out of their way to help. Breakfast was excellent with a wide choice of cheeses, meats and fish. Cooked options were available but we were more than happy with the buffet. The view from the breakfast room is outstanding. Finally I come to the room. We had treated ourselves to a Junior Suite which consisted of a bedroom, a sitting room and a large bathroom with both a walk in shower and a sunken bath. Each window gave the wonderful view of the city both by day and at night when the main buildings are floodlit. As well as coffee there were complementary soft drinks and water in the fridge together with a couple of tins of nuts. Check-out was not until 12 and we would have lingered until then had we not had a flight to catch.\n\nShow More\n\n4.4/5\n\nExcellent\n\nSSHUN1. The apartment is located in the ancient city, close to the Bisagra Gate. In the afternoon, I drove to the front of the apartment. The Spanish lady next door was very helpful and informed that the car could be parked for a period of time (resident parking spaces can be parked before 5 pm), and also informed that the front desk is in the building opposite to the apartment, which is a hotel front desk of the same name. deposit luggage). The front desk service is very enthusiastic. 2. For overnight parking, you need to go to a large parking lot three to four hundred meters ahead. The stamped parking fee of the hotel can be discounted about 13.5 euros a day. 3. The ancient city basically walks to visit various scenic spots. There are many restaurants nearby, and it’s even more lively when you walk up to the center of the ancient city. There is also a Carrefour supermarket three to four hundred meters away. 4. On the second day of the tour, I was stolen by similar immigrants with gifts, 30 Euro worth of children’s T-shirts and refrigerator stickers. I would have known that I would reveal my wealth earlier so that I would not let others go from the cathedral to the old bridge in regret. We are not happy anymore, well, it's worthwhile to train children to analyze the memories afterwards. 5. The room seems to have a little retro romance. It is not old and clean. We only need to go up three steps on the first floor and take the spiral staircase upstairs. The kitchen facilities are fairly complete, including a washing machine and refrigerator. The living room and dining room are also quite big. In the bedroom, the quilt on the bed is covered with blankets out of the bedspread. I don’t feel comfortable with the quilt. Let’s go for one night. The toilet is very large, and the electric water heater is like a large 100-liter tank, which is enough to take a shower.\n\nShow More\n\n4.2/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserWe had booked two nights at the hotel but really considered checking out after the first nigh as a car is required to visit the city and the restaurant was closed. I showed the receptionist their web page and it said that the restaurant was open. A few hours later we were told that a meal would be coked for us and could we choose what we wanted. It appeared that one chef was ill and the other chef came in and cooked just for us, this was a piece of great customer service which we appreciated. I believe that due to covid the hotel was not getting many guests and therefore revenue was down, this also showed in the garden not been kept tidy, although the pool was in good repair. The room required a little tender loving but had a fridge and AC but no safe. The public areas in the hotel were clean and tidy. The panoramic view of the city was spectacular. I feel for the hotel owners as with reduced revenue they did not have enough money to spend on the outside areas, but I think that as the number of guest increase the hotel will shine once again.\n\nShow More\n\n4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserStayed for 3 nights in July 2022 with two children. The hotel is old, but mostly very good, clean and comfortable for the reasonable price of around 100 euros a night. Quite big pool area with a small pool for children. A lot of sunbeds and a bar that is open until afternoon. In the hotel there is a free-of-charge kids club (miniclub) with an employee playing with the kids, and 3+ year-olds can stay without parents. Open almost all day. Our children loved it, and often rather wanted to go there than play in the pool. The teacher is lovely and does all kinds of fun things with the kids. They were even given a diploma and a t-shirt after participation. The breakfast was very poor though and needs an immediate improvement. We had it one day, and can't recommend it for any price. Not many options , and food didnt seem fresh and was not tasty. Pastries didnt seem to be from the same day. Long queue to the coffee machine because 2 out of 3 machines were out of use.\n\nShow More\n\n4.1/5\n\nVery Good\n\nGGuest UserThe hotel is not in the ancient city of Toledo, but is suitable for people travelling by car. The hotel has a large open space for parking and no charge. The hotel has an open environment. The floor where we live opens the balcony door, which is the green space. The view is wide and unobstructed, overlooking the ancient city. The hotel has a good breakfast and a la carte dinner at the restaurant in the evening. The quality of the food is also high, although the consumption is not low. It takes about 30 minutes to walk to and from the ancient city. Although it is not close, it is not very far.\n\nShow More"
