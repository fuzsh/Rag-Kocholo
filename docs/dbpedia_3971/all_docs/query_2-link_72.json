        "text": "Mission San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a is a Spanish mission in the Mission Hills community of Los Angeles, California. The mission was founded on 8 September 1797 at the site of Achooykomenga, and was the seventeenth of the twenty-one Spanish missions established in Alta California. Named for Saint Ferdinand, the mission is the namesake of the nearby city of San Fernando and the San Fernando Valley.The mission was secularized in 1834 and returned to the Catholic Church in 1861; it became a working church in 1920. Today the mission grounds function as a museum; the church is a chapel of ease of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles.In 1769, the Spanish PortolÃ expedition â the first Europeans to see inland areas of California â traveled north through the San Fernando Valley. On August 7 they camped at a watering place near where the mission would later be established. Fray Juan CrespÃ­, a Franciscan missionary travelling with the expedition, noted in his diary that the camp was \"at the foot of the mountains\".It is the 17th mission. The Rancho of Francisco Reyes (then the Alcalde of the Pueblo de Los Ãngeles), which included the agricultural settlement of Achooykomenga worked by VentureÃ±o Chumash, FernandeÃ±o (Tongva), and Tataviam laborers, was approved by the padres as a suitable site for the Mission. After brief negotiations with the Alcalde, the land was acquired (Mission records list Reyes as godfather to the first infant baptized at San Fernando).The mission was founded on 8 September 1797 by Father FermÃ­n LasuÃ©n who, with the assistance of Fray Francisco Dumetz and in the presence of troops and natives, performed the ceremonies and dedicated the mission to San Fernando Rey de EspaÃ±a, making it the fourth mission site he had established; ten children were baptized on the first day. Fray Francisco Dumetz and his associate Fray Francisco Javier UrÃ­a labored in the mission until after 1800.Early in October 1797, 13 adults were baptised and the first marriage took place on 8 October. At the end of the year, there were 55 neophytes. By 1800, there were 310 neophytes, 352 baptisms, and 70 deaths.Fray Dumetz left the mission in April 1802, then returned in 1804 and finally left the following year at the same time as Fray Francisco Javier UrÃ­a, who left the country. In 1805, Fray NicolÃ¡s LÃ¡zaro and Fray JosÃ© MarÃ­a Zalvidea arrived at the mission; the latter was transferred to San Gabriel in 1806 and the former died at San Diego in August 1807. An adobe church with a tile roof was blessed in December 1806. Padres JosÃ© Antonio UrÃ­a and Pedro MuÃ±os arrived in 1807; the former retired in November 1808 and was succeeded by Fray MartÃ­n de Landaeta while Fray JosÃ© Antonio Urresti arrived in 1809 and became the associate of Fray MuÃ±oz. Fray Landaeta died in 1816.During the first decade of the century, the neophyte population increased from 310 to 955, there had been 797 deaths, and 1468 baptisms. The largest number of baptisms in any one year was 361 in 1803.In 1804 there was a land controversy where the padres successfully protested against the granting of the Rancho Camulos to Francisco Ãvila.Fray Urresti died in 1812 and was succeeded by Fray JoaquÃ­n Pascual Nuez in 1812 to 1814, Fray Vincente Pascual Oliva was stationed in the mission from 1814 to 1815. Fray Pedro MuÃ±oz left California in 1817, and his place was taken by Fray Marcos Antonio de Vitoria from 1818 to 1820. Fray RamÃ³n Ulibarri arrived in January and Fray Francisco GonzÃ¡lez de Ibarra in October 1820. On 21 December 1812, an earthquake hit the area which caused enough damage to necessitate the introduction of 20 new beams to support the church wall. Before 1818, a new chapel was completed. During the period of 1810 to 1820 the population increased slightly, reaching its highest figure, 1,080, in 1819, after which its decline began.After Fray Ulibarri died in 1821, Fray Francisco GonzÃ¡lez de Ibarra was stationed alone in the mission.After the Mexican Empire gained independence from Spain on 27 September 1821, the Province of Alta California became the Mexican Territory of Alta California. The missions continued under the rule of Mexico.Fray Ibarra began to complain that the soldiers of his guard were causing problems by selling liquor and lending horses to the natives and in 1825, he declared that \"the presidio was a curse rather than a help to the mission, that the soldiers should go to work and raise grain, and not live on the toil of the Indians, whom they robbed and deceived with talk of liberty while in reality they treated them as slaves.\" This led to a sharp reply from Captain Guerra, who advised the Padre to modify his tone. The amount of supplies furnished by the mission to the presidio from 1822 to April 1827 amounted to $21,203.\n\nHere is a local Business that supports the communityÂ Â\n\nGoogle Map-Â Â https://goo.gl/maps/X3ytkcSCbtFp4heHA\n\n10727 White Oak Ave #205C, Granada Hills, CA 91344\n\nBe sure to check out this attraction too!"
