        "meta_description": "Iglesia de San Andrés was constructed between the years 1505 and 1510 post the invasion of Canary Islands. It remains one of the earliest churches of the scenic islands and a major historical attraction. The modern day structure was erected on the site of an erstwhile edifice. Inside the church, one can see a medieval wooden cast portraying St. Andrew the Apostle. A Christ sculpture dating back to the 19th Century is also seen inside the church. The church's altar depicting departed souls in a state of purgatory is also a vivid feature.",
