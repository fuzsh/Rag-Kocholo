        "text": "On May 25, 2024, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, in partnership with the Provincial Health Office of La Union, organized a Child Nutrition Program Screening Event in Barangay Lingsat. The initiative, targeting newborns and children up to 60 months, saw 65 young children participate and offered comprehensive health screenings and nutrition support.\n\nThe comprehensive screening included measurements of weight and height, medical consultations, and nutrition counseling conducted by the provincial health team. The team was led by Dr. Dan William Y. Dacanay, Provincial Health Officer I, alongside Dr. Gretchen Carbonell and Nutrition Officers Kristine Antonette Pinon and Charmie Casuga.\n\nVolunteers from the Barangay Nutrition Scholars (BNS) of Brgy. Lingsat assisted with the screening process. Additionally, Police Captain Jhanice V. Dalaodao, Provincial Chief of the Women and Children Protection Desk (WCPD) for the Province of La Union, gave a lecture on child protection to the parents and adults who accompanied their children to the event.\n\nThe provincial health office, through the provincial pharmacist, Ms. Jennifer Ragpala, provided vitamins and medicines to the children in addition to the screenings.\n\nDr. William Dacanay expressed his gratitude to The Church of Jesus Christ for organizing the event and sharing its mission with friends of other faiths, emphasizing the significance of such collaborations in enhancing the province's health programs. \"The provincial government is happy and thankful for the Church's support in health initiatives,\" Dr. Dacanay remarked.\n\nPresident Josue Jundos, Stake President of the San Fernando La Union Stake (diocese), also conveyed his appreciation for Governor Raffy Ortega-David's and all other officials' support for the event. He highlighted the importance of the medical staff’s efforts and the donated vitamins and medicines provided by the provincial government, acknowledging their crucial role in the event's success.\n\nCaring for God’s Children through Improved Nutrition\n\nAs members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, we covenant to care for all of God’s children around the world. As part of this effort, we aim to serve and care for children so they can reach their full potential.\n\nThe Church has focused efforts on helping more children have access to comprehensive nutrition care, including nutritious foods, safe drinking water, supported access to local clinical services, and other factors that help children meet their growth potential."
