        "text": "The Holy Rosary Parish, formerly known as Santo Rosario Church, today fondly called by locals as “Pisambang Maragul” (“Big Church”) stands in the epicenter of the old Culiat town, now Angeles, Pampanga, Philippines. The church has recently been recognized by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as a national historical site.[1]\n\nHistory\n\nThe foundations of the church were first laid out on October 18, 1877 by the founding families of Angeles City lead by of Don Mariano V. Henson, It was as laid out by city planners in the Spanish colonial era and now is one of the most distinctive landmark of the city today because of its historical significance related on how it was built. The church was constructed from 1877 to 1896 by the “Polo y Servicio” labor system, defined as the forced and unpaid labor of the Filipino native people for 40 days per year to all males from 16–65 years old by the Spanish colonial government. The first mass was held in the half of the church that was finished by April 14, 1886. The second half of the church which includes the building’s distinctive dome, was finished on September 17, 1891. The twin bells were rung for the first time on February 12, 1896. The church was finally finished as it still stands today on October 1909. It’s engineering and architectural skills where provided by Don Antonio de la Camara from Manila.[2]\n\nThe backyard of the church became the execution grounds from 1896-1898 in shooting down Filipino rebels and suspects by the Spanish forces.[2] And it was also used by the U.S. Army as a military hospital from 1899 to 1900. The church’s bellfry was destroyed in the 1940s as a result of the World War II. It was immediately restored by the government with the help of American troops and was finished by early 1944. Today, the Holy Rosary Parish Church serves as the city’s main religious center, being located at the front of the former city hall, now known as the Museo ning Angeles. Local devotees flock the church and faithfully attend activities especially during the Holy Week. Two of the awaited activities are the Good Friday Procession, where bare-footed followers of the Apung Mamacalulu, or the Holy Sepulchre join the procession in the city complex; and the Salubong, held at the Nepo Parking Lot, that ends with the traditional meeting of the Risen Christ and Virgin Mary amidst the fireworks.

As Mater Dolorosa, it is also a key subject for Marian art in the Catholic Church.\n\nThe Seven Sorrows of Mary are a popular Roman Catholic devotion. In common religious Catholic imagery, the Blessed Virgin Mary is portrayed in a sorrowful and lacrimating affect, with seven daggers piercing her heart, often bleeding. Devotional prayers that consist of meditation began to elaborate on her Seven Sorrows based on the prophecy of Simeon. Common examples of piety under this title are Servite rosary, or the Chaplet of the Seven Sorrows of Our Lady and the Seven Joys of Mary and more recently, “Sorrowful and Immaculate Heart of Mary“.\n\nThe feast of Our Lady of Sorrows is liturgically celebrated each 15 of September, while a feast of Friday of Sorrows is observed in some Catholic countries.\n\nSeven Sorrows of Mary\n\nThe Seven Sorrows (or Dolors) are events in the life of the Blessed Virgin Mary that are a popular devotion and are frequently depicted in art.[1]\n\nIt is a common devotion for Catholics to say daily one Our Father and seven Hail Marys for each.\n\nThese Seven Sorrows should not be confused with the five Sorrowful Mysteries of the Rosary.\n\nThe Prophecy of Saint Simeon. (Luke 2:34–35)\n\nThe escape and Flight into Egypt. (Matthew 2:13)\n\nThe Loss of the Child Jesus in the Temple of Jerusalem. (Luke 2:43–45)\n\nThe Meeting of Mary and Jesus on the Via Dolorosa.\n\nThe Crucifixion of Jesus on Mount Calvary. (John 19:25)\n\nThe Piercing of the Side of Jesus, and His Descent from the Cross. (Matthew 27:57–59)\n\nThe Burial of Jesus by Joseph of Arimathea. (John 19:40–42)\n\nThe feast of the Our Lady of Sorrows was originated by a provincial synod of Cologne in 1423 as a response to the iconoclast Hussites. It was designated for the Friday after the third Sunday after Easter. It had the title: Commemoratio angustiae et doloris B. Mariae V.. Before the 16th century, the feast was celebrated only in parts of northern Europe.\n\nEarlier, in 1233, seven youths in Tuscany founded the Servite Order (also known as the “Servite Friars”, or the “Order of the Servants of Mary”). Five years later, they took up the sorrows of Mary, standing under the Cross, as the principal devotion of their order.[2]\n\nOver the centuries several devotions, and even orders, arose around meditation on Mary’s Sorrows in particular. The Servites developed the two most common devotions to Our Lady’s Sorrows, namely the Rosary of the Seven Sorrows and the Black Scapular of the Seven Dolours of Mary. The Black Scapular is a symbol of the Confraternity of Our Lady of Sorrows, which is associated with the Servite Order.[3] Most devotional scapulars have requirements regarding ornamentation or design. The devotion of the Black Scapular requires only that it be made of black woollen cloth.[4]\n\nReferences\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Our_Lady_of_Sorrows\n\nSan Guillermo Parish Church is named after San Guillermo, the patron saint of Bacolor, Pampanga, Philippines, where the church is erected. The church was originally constructed by the Augustinian Friars in 1576 – also the town’s founding – with Fr. Diego De Ochoa, OSA, as the town’s first parish priest. Having been installed as such two years after.\n\nIn 1880, the church was destroyed by an earthquake only to be rebuilt by Fr. Eugenio Alvarez in 1886. On September 3, 1995, lahar flow from the slopes of Mount Pinatubo which erupted into world notice on June 15, 1991, buried the church at half its 12-m height prompting its more than 50,000 town residents to evacuate to safer grounds in resettlement areas. Near the façade of the parish church is a museum which contains the history of the church. It also contains paintings of the Pinatubo eruption in 1991.\n\nBacolor is one of the oldest towns in the Philippines. The first church was built by the Augustinian friars in 1576 on the lot of Don Guillermo Manabat, a rich landlord believed to be the founder of Bacolor. An earthquake destroyed the church and a new church was built by Fr. Manuel Diaz in 1897. It has a central nave and well-lighted transept with windows. The main retablo, side retablos and pulpit are gilded with gold leaf. The richness of the decoration of Bacolor church depicts the advanced stage of baroque and rococo. In spite of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, which half-buried the church on October 1, 1995, the structure is still being used as place of worship. It was already a world-renowned tourist destination before the lahar tragedies; now more tourists flock to the church whose remaining features are being preserved and maintained\n\nThe church boasts of having main retablo, side retablos and pulpit that are heavily gilded with gold leaves. The rich decorations of the church depict the Baroque style of architecture. Only half of the original facade of the church can be seen today due to the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991 which half-buried the church. After the volcanic eruption, the town’s people painstakingly excavated the altar and the retablo and relocated it under the dome in order for the tall wooden retablo to fit. The retablos niches are filled with centuries- old statues which were saved from destruction of the lahar. The citizens of Bacolor take pride in their rich heritage which is why they carefully excavated the ornately carved main and side altars and restored in its immaculate condition. The church is already a world famous tourist destination prior to the lahar tragedies and present has remained being so. The choir area used to be located above the sanctuary but since the lahar occurred, the citizens of Bacolor decided the area be moved\n\nReferences\n\nhttp://www.visitclark.com/LERT/bacolor_church.asp\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Guillermo_Parish_Church\n\nn 1755 the first structure of wood and thatch was built on this site by the Augustinian friars under the patronage of San Fernando III, King of Castile. Fray Sebastian Moreno, O.S.A. was its first cura parroco. On October 17, 1757, townsfolk petitioned the governor-general for exemptions from tribute to enable them to build the church and convent.\n\nIt was transferred to the care of secular priests in 1788. The construction of the present style church started during the same year under the supervision Fr. Manuel Canlas, its first secular cura parroco, and a committee composed of the principales of the town. They were led by gobernadorcillo Bernabe Pamintuan. Construction was completed in 1808. The church was rededicated to the Assumption of Our Lady.\n\nThe church measures 70m. long, 13m. wide and 11m. high. The round majestic dome rising from the rotanda of the transept is reminiscent of the Baroque style with some Renaissance elements.\n\nPresident Emilio F. Aguinaldo and his cabinet viewed the Philippine Revolutionary Army from the windows of the convento on October 9, 1898. On orders of Gen. Antonio Luna, the Philippine Revolutionary Army burned the church and convento on May 4, 1899.\n\n20th century\n\nThe church was destroyed by fire again in 1939, and restored by Pampango Architect Fernando H. Ocampo in 1948.\n\nIn 1948 the church was elevated to Cathedral when it became the seat of the Diocese of San Fernando, canonically created by Pope Pius XII.\n\nIn 1975, the diocese was elevated by Pope Paul VI, to Archdiocese of San Fernando. Its first bishop was Monsignor Cesar Ma. Guerrero, D.D. He was followed by the Most Reverend Emilio A. Cinense, D.D., who became its first archbishop. He was succeeded by the Most Reverend Oscar V. Cruz, D.D. in 1978. The third archbishop of San Fernando is the Most Reverend Paciano B. Aniceto, D.D. Pamp, and the current is Most Rev. Francisco Llavaras, D.D.[1]\n\nIn 2014, the Cathedral underwent a major renovation and restoration under the leadership of Msgr. Eugenio G. Reyes.\n\nSt. Jude, known as Thaddaeus, was a brother of St. James the Less, and a relative of Our Saviour. He was one of the 12 Apostles of Jesus and his attribute is a club. Images of St. Jude often include a flame around his head, which represent his presence at Pentecost, when he accepted the Holy Spirit alongside the other apostles. Another attribute is St. Jude holding an image of Christ, in the Image of Edessa.\n\nSometimes he can also be seen holding a carpenter’s ruler or is depicted with a scroll or book, the Epistle of Jude.\n\nBiblical scholars agree St. Jude was a son of Clopas and his mother Mary was the Virgin Mary’s cousin. Ancient writers tell us that he preached the Gospel in Judea, Samaria, Idumaea, Syria, Mesopotamia, and Lybia. According to Eusebius, he returned to Jerusalem in the year 62, and assisted at the election of his brother, St. Simeon, as Bishop of Jerusalem.\n\nSaint Jude is not the same person as Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Our Lord and despaired because of his great sin and lack of trust in God’s mercy.\n\nJude was the one who asked Jesus at the Last Supper why He would not manifest Himself to the whole world after His resurrection. Little else is known of his life. Legend claims that he visited Beirut and Edessa and could have been martyred with St. Simon in Persia.\n\nHe is an author of an epistle (letter) to the Churches of the East, particularly the Jewish converts, directed against the heresies of the Simonians, Nicolaites, and Gnostics. Though Saint Gregory the Illuminator has been credited as the “Apostle to the Armenians,” the Apostles Jude and Bartholomew are believed to have brought Christianity to Armenia, where Jude was rumored to have later been martyred.\n\nThere is some debate about where Jude died, though most Biblical scholars agree he was martyred. He is believed to have been martyred either in Armenia or Beirut.\n\nFollowing his death, St. Jude’s body was brought to Rome and left in a crypt in St. Peter’s Basilica. Today his bones can be found in the left transept of St. Peter’s Basilica under the main altar of St. Joseph in a tomb he shares with the remains of the apostle Simon the Zealot.\n\nPilgrims came to St. Jude’s grave to pray and many reported a powerful intercession, leading to the title, “The Saint for the Hopeless and the Despaired.” Two Saints, St. Bridget of Sweden and St. Bernard, had visions from God asking them to accept St. Jude as “The Patron Saint of the Impossible.”\n\nRoman Catholics invoke St. Jude when in desperate situations because his New Testament letter stresses that the faithful should persevere in the environment of harsh, difficult circumstances -just as their forefathers had done before them; therefore, he is the patron saint of desperate cases.\n\nThe Chicago Police Department and Clube de Regatas do Flamengo – the Rio de Janeiro soccer team – have made Saint Jude their patron saint and there are several hospitals who have also accepted him as their patron saint, including the well-known children’s hospital St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee.\n\nThere have also been several sites across the world dedicated to the Apostle Jude, including shrines and churches. The National Shrine of Saint Jude was founded in 1955 and can be found in England.\n\nThere are two mentions of Jude in the New Testament: Luke 6:16 and Acts 1:13.\n\nWhen Jude was mentioned in the Bible, it was often in relation to James (Jude of James) which is traditionally interpreted to mean “Jude, brother of James” as in the King James version of Luke 6:16; however, “Jude, son of James” appears in Protestant translations such as the NIV, NIRV, and the New King James Version. The same discrepancy occurs in Acts 1:13.\n\nIn John 14:22, a disciple called “Judas not Iscariot” is assumed to be the apostle Jude, though critics believe it is too ambiguous to believe it is a certainty.\n\nWhen the apostles are listed in Matthew 10:3 and Mark 3:18, Jude’s name does not appear but “Thaddeus” does. This occurrence led early Christians to believe Jude was known as both “Jude” and “Thaddeus,” the latter of which could have been a sort of nickname.\n\n“Thaddeus” may have become a popular nickname for Jude following Judas Iscariot’s betrayal. To add further confusion to Jude’s second name, the name Thaddeus is often indistinguishable from Thaddeus of Edessa, one of the Seventy Disciples.\n\nA popular Roman Catholic prayer to Saint Jude is:\n\n“O most holy apostle, Saint Jude, faithful servant and friend of Jesus, the Church honoureth and invoketh thee universally, as the patron of hopeless cases, and of things almost despaired of. Pray for me, who am so miserable.\n\n“Make use, I implore thee, of that particular privilege accorded to thee, to bring visible and speedy help where help was almost despaired of. Come to mine assistance in this great need, that I may receive the consolation and succor of Heaven in all my necessities, tribulations, and sufferings, particularly (here make your request) and that I may praise God with thee and all the elect throughout eternity.\n\n“I promise thee, O blessed Jude, to be ever mindful of this great favour, to always honour thee as my special and powerful patron, and to gratefully encourage devotion to thee. Amen.”\n\nThe Novena – a prayer said nine days in a row – to Saint Jude is:\n\n“Apostle and Martyr, great in virtue and rich in miracles, near kinsman of Jesus Christ, faithful intercessor for all who invoke thee, special patron in time of need; to thee I have recourse from the depth of my heart, and humbly beg thee, to whom God hath given such great power, to come to my assistance; help me now in my urgent need and grant my earnest petition. I will never forget thy graces and the favors thou dost obtain for me and I will do my utmost to spread devotion to thee. Amen.”\n\nReference\n\nhttp://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=127"
