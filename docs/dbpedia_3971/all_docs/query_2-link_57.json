        "text": "Welcome and thank you for visiting Saint Augustine Catholic Church. I hope that this online site will provide the information you need to become more fully engaged in the life of our parish.\n\nSaint Augustine Catholic Church, founded in 1970, celebrates over 50 years of parish life. Having become one of the largest parishes in the Archdiocese of San Francisco, Saint Augustine Church has maintained its commitment to be good stewards of all God’s many blessings.\n\nOur parish has become a place for many families who grew in faith as disciples of Christ through meaningful Liturgies, the Small Christian Communities, Bible Studies, the Rite of Christian Initiation for Adults, Adult and Family Faith Formation, Children’s Faith Formation from 1st grade through high-school youth group, our Young Adult Group, St. Vincent De Paul Conference, and the Knights of Columbus.\n\nSaint Augustine Church has been blessed to remain open despite the ongoing modifications of in-person services during the Covid19 Pandemic. We never wavered in our desire to safely meet the sacramental needs of our parishioners, guests, and viewers from all walks of life, even if only through virtual means.\n\nImmediately after the lock down, a small group of volunteers swiftly formed a new ministry, for parishioners to participate in the Holy Eucharist without losing the sense of belonging and community. Our daily masses have since been livestreamed through Facebook Live, and in-person attendees of our outdoor masses are able to tune in to FM 88.1 from the safety of their cars.\n\nSaint Augustine Church believes that growing in faith by imitating Christ, as well as engaging in fellowship with others, especially the least among us; brings us closer to meeting the mission of the Church.\n\nI hope our website draws you more deeply to Christ through our parish community.\n\nFr. Ray Reyes\n\nFather Ray hails from Minalin, Pampanga, Philippines. He finished his secondary education at Don Bosco Juniorate, a minor seminary run by the Salesians in Pampanga. After graduation from the juniorate, he entered the Mother of Good Counsel Seminary, a diocesan seminary of the province, to complete his philosophical and theological studies.\n\nFather Ray was ordained on December 8, 1988 and served for the next 10 years as a parish priest at three different parishes in the Archdiocese of San Fernando including the Cathedral Church of Our Lady of the Assumption. In 1998, Father Ray was asked to assist at Saint Patrick’s Church in San Francisco, California, where many of\n\nthe faithful from his home province came to worship. He was assigned there as its parochial vicar until 2003.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2006, Father Ray served as the parochial vicar of Saint Isabella Church in San Rafael in Marin County. During his ministry across the Golden Gate Bridge, he was incardinated into the Presbyterate of the Archdiocese of San Francisco in 2005.\n\nIn 2006, he was assigned as Parochial Administrator of Saint Anne of the Sunset Church in San Francisco and was installed as its pastor the following year. For eight years, Father Ray served as pastor to over 1,000 families and to its double school with 586 students."
