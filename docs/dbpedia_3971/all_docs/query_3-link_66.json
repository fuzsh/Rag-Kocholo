        "text": "Jesus said to them: “I have given you a model to follow, so that as I have done for you, you should also do.” — John 13:15\n\nJesus sends us forth to live as he did. All family members are invited to participate in the life of the parish. It is through parish life that we can bring to life the command Jesus gave us. An open invitation is extended to all newcomers to become registered parishioners of St. Andrew the Apostle Church. Parish Registration Forms are available in the church’s Gathering Space, at the Parish House or through the Religious Education Office.\n\nThere are many ministries and volunteer opportunities where everyone can give of their time and talents to continue and share in the work of Jesus.\n\nJunior Lectors proclaim God’s Word at Children’s Liturgies of the Word and prayer services throughout the year. All children are invited to be Junior Lectors.\n\nAltar Servers help set the Lord’s table during Eucharist. If you have received First Holy Communion and attend 4th grade or higher, you are invited to become Altar Servers.\n\nMinistries for Adults: There are many opportunities open to all adults to minister to the spiritual and material needs of the people. For a listing of the various ministries and committees at St. Andrew’s, click here.\n\nChildren’s Giving Program: Offering envelopes for children are available to those who request them. Please encourage your child to contribute to the life of our parish regularly when they attend Sunday Mass. Children can do this in two ways: offer a gift of money (this should be some small amount from their personal spending money), or offer a gift of service (write on a slip of paper a good deed they performed during the week). These offerings can be placed in the offering envelopes and placed in the baskets when the children come to Mass each week. The money offering is donated for mission work at our sister parish, San Andres in Guatemala.\n\nFinancial Support of the Parish: Registered parishioners share in the financial support of the parish, which is essential to allow St. Andrew’s to meet the spiritual and material needs of the parish community. Offering envelopes are mailed monthly to each family. Each envelope is marked to show how your offering will be used. Weekly and Monthly offerings are used to support the many ministries of the parish. In addition, they are used to pay for day-to-day expenses, including salaries, taxes, utility bills and general maintenance needs."
