        "text": "by Elanor Mae Gardoce\n\nIn the Church calendar year, Holy Week is considered to be the most important week. It is a time of celebrating the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ, especially in remembrance of His actions and sacrifices. For Filipino Catholics, Visita Iglesia is one of the most famous Holy Week panatas. It has been a tradition to visit at least seven different churches during the Holy Week, specifically on Maundy Thursday and Good Friday. Now that the Holy Week is approaching, have you ever think of where you want your Visita Iglesia would be?\n\nThe Province of Zambales is commonly known for its beaches and coves. It has become a go-to destination for travelers. It is known for various beach and mountain activities such as surfing and camping. However, what others may not know is that there are also ancient and historical sites in the province.\n\nZambales also has many centuries-old churches for everybody. There is something for students of history, lovers of the past’s great architecture, and those devotees, especially during this Lenten season with the Iglesia tradition. To name a few, here are some of the heritage churches in Zambales that you may consider visiting this Holy Week, primarily if you are residing within the province:\n\nCathedral of St. Augustine of Hippo (Iba, Zambales)\n\nBuilt during the 1700s by the Augustinian Recollects, this coral and limestone church is a historical spot in Zambales. This was where the 2nd Philippines Commission convened in 1901 to declare the establishment of Zambales Province.\n\nIt is located at Lipay-Dingin Road, Iba, Zambales, in front of the Zambales Provincial Capitol; beside PhilPost Office of Iba; 1 block North of San Agustin Elementary School; 1 block east of Banco De Oro Iba branch, and two blocks east of Bank of the Philippine Islands Iba branch. The Cathedral of St. Augustine of Hippo is an hour and a half drive from Subic Town.\n\nSan Andres Apostol Parish Church of Masinloc\n\nThe San Andres Apostol Parish Church, famously known as Masinloc Church, is an 18th-century Baroque masterpiece in Brgy. South Poblacion, Masinloc, Zambales. The parish is dedicated to Saint Andrew the Apostle under the Roman Catholic Diocese of Iba. Its magnificent structure stands out among its Spanish-era contemporaries for its unique coral stone material.\n\nThe church’s white-washed blocks facade is made grander by its pyramid shape at the top. To add to the effect are three crosses in the second tier, with the middle cond cross depicting the Holy Spirit’s descent. This unique structure was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippines’ National Museum of the Philippines 25 other Spanish-era churches in 2001.\n\nThe San Andres Church is a magnificent reminder of our rich history. Visiting the church at seasons like this will surely give us surreal feels.\n\nSt. Vincent Ferrer Parish Church\n\nThe St. Vincent Ferrer Parish Church is located at Candelaria Town Proper, Candelaria, Zambales. Historically, it was ravaged by fire and was recently reconstructed and built in the contemporary style. Its only antique monument is the stone arch outside the church that contains three broken bells dating back to the 1890s.\n\nIna Poon Bato Church\n\nPoon Bato or better known as the Apo Apang, is the patroness of Botolan, Zambales. Apo Apang is said to appear in the town centuries ago. This dates back way before the arrival of the Spaniards and during the inhabitation of Aetas in the Philippines.\n\nThe Ina Poon Bato church is one of the most exciting highlights for your Visita Iglesia because this is the church where Zambales’ patroness is enshrined. Inside the church, you will see the main altar with three niches: the images of Apo Apang, Saint Augustine, and Saint Monica (mother of Saint Augustine). You may also see there a wooden door with carvings depicting the apparition of Apo Apang. There is also a small cave of the patroness – Apo Apang, near a steel bridge for the devotees to visit. The accurate apparition site can be found along a gnarly path that can be difficult for those who are not physically fit. This church is indeed a must-visit church in Zambales for your Visita Iglesia this Holy Week.\n\nIn addition to the heritage-churches listed above, there are also other churches around Subic Town. One of which is the Garden of Prayer Church.\n\nGarden of Prayer Church – Subic\n\nThe Garden of Prayer Church in Subic is considered to be one of the top-rated place listed as Catholic Church in Olongapo City. It has a massive grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes, which made the Garden of Prayer Church known in Zambales. The church is located along National Rd. Brgy. Aningway, Subic, Zambales. It is only beside the most trusted house and lot developer in the country and the first township community in Zambales – Camella Subic.\n\nAt present, welcoming the Lenten Season remains challenging. While the country remains under various sorts of community quarantine, our Holy Week traditions also have to adjust. However, we may still do practices like the Visita Iglesia with proper precaution and vigilance. Let us do our part in complying and following strict safety measures and observe a sacred, solemn, and safe Lenten season.\n\nFind your home where you can feel safe and bloom.
