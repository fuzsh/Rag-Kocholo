        "text": "New church (left) - Old church (right)\n\nThe San Andrés church of Torre del Mar is the religious heart of the town. It is located in the main Plaza.\n\nDuring Christmas 1884, an earthquake that is estimated to have reached six on the Richter scale, with its epicenter in Arenas del Rey, Granada, shook the regions of the Axarquía and western Granada causing some seven hundred dead and numerous wounded and material damage, so much so that the then King of Spain, Alfonso XII, moved to the area and visited Torre del Mar. The royal visit made it possible for the devout Torreños (people of Torre del Mar) of that time to express to the monarchy the needs they had and, among them, that of building a new church. Less than a year after that visit, the monarch died of tuberculosis.\n\nIn November 1888 the new parish was built, it was designed by Eduardo Adaro, architect of buildings like the Bank of Spain, in the Plaza de Cibeles in Madrid. It located on the same site as the current one. In the seventies of the last century that church was replaced by the current one of a modern design. In the spacious interior of this modern church, can be seen to the left of the large central crucifix, the image of the Patron Saint of Fishermen, the Virgen del Carmen. Every July 26, in the afternoon, the Virgen del Carmen leaves her temple, after touring her town, going to sea in a small boat, in what is one of the maritime and seafaring processions dedicated to the Patron Saint of Fishermen. It is more beautiful and emotional than those celebrated in the entire province.\n\nQuite often you will hear the bells ringing usually on the hour. A large underground car park sits to the side."
