The Kyushu Railway Company (Japanese: 九州旅客鉄道株式会社 Kyūshū Ryokaku Tetsudō Kabushiki Kaisha), officially abbreviated as JR Kyushu (Japanese: JR九州 JR Kyūshū), is the main subsidiary of the Japan Railways Group based on the island of Kyushu.

History[]

Main article: Japan Railways Group

By the 1980s, the Japanese National Railways had become practically insolvent due to the decline of rail transport and fare increases failing to compensate for high labor costs. The Japanese National Railways was privatized and split into seven different companies on 1 April 1987, with the Japanese National Railway Settlement Corporation later formed to distribute the funds among the companies. JR Kyushu was formed from the previous JNR lines that ran in Kyushu. The company is owned by a public float as of 2016, having executed its initial public offering in October that year.

Yoji Furumiya is JR Kyushu's current president, having served in this role since 2022.
