        "text": "View the President's Schedule\n\nA staff meeting—spent most of our time talking about the Sen. vote on my veto. We dont know whether we’ve got the votes to sustain or not. But when 1 Dem. Terry Sanford broke ranks & voted with us—the winning vote—Bob Byrd switched his vote to us so he could demand reconsideration. You have to be a vote on winning side to call for reconsideration. All day on A.F.1 & in Phil. we’ve been back & forth on the phones trying to line up votes but then Byrd has been busy too. Terry Sanford stood up and announced he was changing his vote It looks like we’re behind.\n\nIt was a busy day—left at noon for Phil. First stop was College of Physicians of Phil. a group that started with 24 dr’s. 200 yrs. ago. This was a small group & a Forum session in which I joined. Then it was on to the Franklin Plaza Hotel where I addressed a couple of thousand corporate & social leaders & mainly the College of Phil. fellows (Dr’s.). They made me an honorary member of the College of Physicians. Then on to Congress Hall—where the 1st Cong. met—a brief talk & then handshakes with about 50 major donors. Dr. Otis Bowen—Sec. of H.H.S. was with me on this—he’s only the 7th dr. to ever be in the Cab. in our whole history.\n\nRide home in A.F.1 was again a series of phone calls to the Sen. I’m afraid we’re going to lose."
