        "text": "By Gil Yun-hyung, Tokyo correspondent\n\nWhile the government has repeatedly claimed that the plan to split off the Suseo KTX Line is not privatization, the Korean Railway Workers’ Union doesn’t believe it. This has resulted in the longest strike in the history of the union. There are also many members of the public who believe the plan constitutes privatization.\n\nWhat about Japan, South Korea’s next-door neighbor? By 1987, the accumulated deficit at the Japanese National Railways was so high that the government split the state-owned company into six passenger companies and one freight company. The Hankyoreh examined what the railroads are like in Japan, 26 years after they were privatized. Severe polarization can be seen between the companies that have railroad lines in major cities and those running older lines in more sparsely populated areas. There are also frequent accidents because of a sharp reduction in the workforce and aging facilities.\n\n“When the lines were privatized, the number of employees with JR Hokkaido was cut from 14,000 to 6,800. Despite this, the company doubled its operation of special trains. . .] Repair work on the lines is being outsourced and subcontracted to companies that rely on unskilled and inexperienced workers.” (New Socialist Weekly, the official publication of Japan’s New Socialist Party)\n\nOn Sept. 19, a freight train derailed at Onuma Station on the Hakodate Line in Hokkaido, Japan. At first, this was viewed as an ordinary railroad accident since nobody was hurt. But before long it turned into a scandal that will long be remembered in the history of railroads in Japan.\n\nA subsequent investigation into all the lines managed by JR Hokkaido (which runs the railroads in the Hokkaido region) showed that the company had continued to run trains even though it knew that there were problems at hundreds of points on the line.\n\nSince then, Japan’s Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism has been conducting a special safety audit of JR Hokkaido, and Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga denounced the company’s behavior as “malicious.” This was the same company that had an accident just two years earlier in May 2011 involving a derailment and fire on the Sekisho Line in which 78 people were injured.\n\nIn addition, reports on Dec. 12 confirmed that company inspectors had fudged their field research results right after the accident in September. The company was trying to conceal the fact that it had continued to run trains while neglecting problems with the tracks. The report has dragged down passenger trust in the company. This showed that the accident was not an isolated mistake but rather that “insensitivity to safety” was pervasive in the company.\n\nWhy did this happen? The answer offered by progressives in Japan is the privatization of the railroads, which took place in April 1987.\n\nIn a story about the accident that ran in October of this year, the New Socialist Weekly wrote, “We are hearing from people working on the lines that a lack of budget and manpower means lines are not repaired for a year or more even when they are nearly 4cm out of place. As a result of strict caps on employment and a reduction of workers since privatization, the number of workers in their 40s who serve as middle managers does not even reach 10% of the total.”\n\nMainstream newspapers have offered similar analysis. In its Oct. 5 edition, the Asahi Shimbun argued that there has been a problem with communication between workers on the site and the headquarters as a result of bitterness caused by privatization.\n\n“After 2005, the budget for facility investment was around 10 billion yen (US$95 million), but this was cut to 5.8 billion yen in 2010. There is no money to repair the lines even if the company wanted to, and people working in the field cannot bring up the need for repairs for fear of being branded as a troublemaker,” the paper wrote, explaining the mood inside the company. The implication is that the aftermath of the privatization of the railroads had a fatally negative effect on railroad safety in Japan.\n\nThe Japanese National Railways (the Japanese equivalent of Korail) was created as a public company in 1949. But as a result of the increasing use of cars, the company started running a deficit in 1964.\n\nIn April 1987, the administration of Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone privatized the company, dividing it into six passenger companies (JR Hokkaido, JR East, JR Tokai, JR West, JR Sikoku, and JR Kyushu) and one freight company. The reason Nakasone gave at the time for privatization was accumulated deficit at the company, which reached 37.1 trillion yen (US$352.86 billion).\n\nDuring the 26 years that have passed since then, the polarization of Japan’s railroads has been getting worse. The gap is growing between the three companies in Honshu (Japan’s largest island) that have the best lines, including the shinkansen (bullet train) lines linking metropolises such as Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, and the three companies running older local lines, such as JR Hokkaido.\n\nIn 2012, JR East, which is centered on Tokyo, recorded 322.8 billion yen in operating profits, with 399.1 billion yen at JR Central, which runs the lines around Nagoya. But JR Hokkaido, which has to cover more area where fewer people live, recorded a deficit of 30.9 billion yen. At JR Hokkaido, a lack of money has prevented the company from hiring new employees for some time. This means that 37.7% of the total employees are 50 years old or above, while employees in their 40s who have to work as on-site supervisors only account for 9.5% of the workforce.\n\nJR Hokkaido has 2.72 employees per 1km of track, while JR Central has more than triple that at 9.18. The Asahi Shimbun concludes that the privatization of the railroads resulted in a gap between the three highly profitable Honshu companies and the three companies in the countryside.\n\nPrivatization of the railroads has also had a major impact on other areas of Japanese society. In 1986 - just before privatization - 277,000 people had been working for the Japanese National Railways, but only 210,000 of them were hired by the private companies that emerged from the state-run company. After privatization, 48,000 chose voluntary retirement, and 20,000 others got jobs at companies in the private sector.\n\nThe downfall of the trade union of the Japanese National Railways - which had been the center of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, the prime support base for the Japan Socialist Party, led to the downfall of the Japan Socialist Party, which had been half of the “1955 system” since the Second World War along with the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan. Its successor is today’s Social Democratic Party.\n\nIn 2005, Nakasone - who pushed through the privatization of the state railroad company - appeared on NHK, Japan’s public TV channel. During his appearance, he said that the railroad trade union had been the crux of the Japanese Trade Union Confederation, which had been the main support base for the Japan Socialist Party, and that the purpose of privatizing the railroads had been to smash the national railway labor union.\n\nBut the sharp hike in fees that has taken place in nearly all cases after privatization of public services in countries around the world has not been observed after privatization of the railways in Japan. As described in a document about reforming the railways that was posted on the website of the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism, ticket prices had been climbing each year before privatization. A price of 100 yen in 1980, would have climbed to 138 in 1986. But in 1997 there had been no major increase in prices if one takes into account the increases in the consumption tax. This can be explained by the deflation that has taken place in Japan during the “lost twenty years” since the end of the 1980s, when the Japanese economic bubble burst. Compared with the same distance in Korea, the railroad ticket prices in Japan are 3 to 4 times more expensive than Korea.\n\n“Since the weather is so cold in Hokkaido, the railroad ties rot very quickly, so they have to be replaced every 20 years. It’s impossible for a private-sector company to maintain profitability here,” said Lee Young-chae, professor of international sociology at Keisen University. “The government privatized public services it should never have privatized and is holding the workers responsible.”\n\n“In Korea, the weather in Gangwon Province and the area around Seoul is similar to, if not colder than, Hokkaido. If we rashly privatize the railroads, something similar could happen in Korea as well. Korean society needs to learn a lesson from the experience of Hokkaido,” Lee said.\n\nPlease direct questions or comments to [english@hani.co.kr]"
