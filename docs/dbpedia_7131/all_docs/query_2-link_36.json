Nothing much happened, (P. S. I wrote this early. It seems to be turning cold as it usually does right after Christmas.)\n\nI am wondering if I will be writing the record of this day a year from now.\n\nJanuary 3, 1987\n\nIt didn’t turn cold after all, but it was dark and cloudy. Nothing much happened, but I had a pleasant day. I have such good care – Selma comes in the morning to get me up and dressed and to cook my breakfast; Dovie comes at noon with a good warm dinner (of which I put away half to warm up for supper, and people telephone or come to visit or write lovely letters.\n\nJanuary 4, 1987\n\nSunday. It was communion Sunday at the church, so the minister brought the service to me (and to Annie Seefeldt and Hattie I think). Raymond came with him, looking fine, all dressed up, ready for church. It was wonderful to see him so fully recovered. There was a very thick frost fog this morning and it was a cold day though the sun shown in the afternoon.\n\nJanuary 5, 1987\n\nAnother sunny day – a little too cool but nice. I enjoy looking out the windows. And I have been reading lovely letters from friends this Christmas season. I can’t answer them, for writing is too hard, but perhaps I can if I take a year for it. Nothing special happened today but I enjoyed it. I am as thankful I can read.\n\nJanuary 6, 1987\n\nAnother sunny day. But I did not feel well all day and became really ill for a time this evening. Raymond came to tell me that Ollie is not doing well and he and Mabel are going to help her get somebody to take care of her. She will have to quit her half turns teaching. I think she is doomed. The cancer is not responding to treatment.\n\nJanuary 7, 1987\n\nIt was a dark day – not terribly cold but I am afraid it is going to be. I was well today. I think the Brysons are not at Ollie’s but their telephone is off the hook. It gives the busy signal. I need to ask them Raymond about date for income tax. The man set a date today and I agreed but I need to consult Raymond.\n\nJanuary 8, 1987\n\nToday we are having our first winter weather. It was dark and cloudy all day, rained some, and I think a few flakes of snow fell but it wasn’t very cold. I felt well and but nothing much happened.\n\nJanuary 9, 1987\n\nIt rained, then turned to snow all night. The ground was white this morning. I judge the snow was 8 or 9 inches deep all over the ground (no wind, so no drifts). It quite about sunrise – was never very cold. Sun shone all day. Of course the ground was above freezing and all the snow melted even in the shade before evening. Penny Williams called from Tulsa for a good telephone visit.\n\nJanuary 10, 1987\n\nOur bad weather was supposed to be over but today was dark and cold. I am dreading a trip I am supposed to make to Enid Monday to see Dr. Miller who will be my eye doctor from now on. Today a man has been calling at the homes of older people claiming to represent the telephone company and collecting payments.\n\nJanuary 11, 1987\n\nSunday. Beautiful day – gold, blue, clear. I missed Raymond. He and Mabel are at Ollie’s. They are at Ollie’s arranging for someone to care for her. I hope the snow and sleet storm didn’t catch them on the way.\n\nJanuary 12, 1987\n\nLovely day, so Selma took me to Enid to see Dr. Miller. My appointment was at 10:30 but I had to wait in the office. Started home at about noon. But I liked my new eye doctor, Miller. I was surprised snow still lying on the ground at Enid – not just in the shade, on level fields. It snowed much more at Enid than here. I am pretty tired tonight. Got to bed at about 2:00 P.M. – usually I get home by noon.\n\nJanuary 13, 1987\n\nA beautiful warm day. (at 9:00 P.M. I still have the furnace off. I had some time recovering from yesterday but but I am O.K. this evening.\n\nJanuary 14, 1987\n\nStill warm, but cold weather is on the way. I felt rested today. Worked on some mixed up tax and medicare business.\n\nJanuary 15, 1987\n\nStill warm this morning but then started getting cold. I am well but not enjoying this first cold spell of the winter. I found medicare [sic] reply to my report is on the way and that the tax business is O.K.\n\nJanuary 16, 1987\n\nToday the ground is white with a thin coating of ice and snow, no drifting but the roads are slick and very dangerous.\n\nJanuary 17, 1987\n\nIt snowed some during the night and off and on during the day. The ground is covered – two or three inches I suppose. I don’t think it drifted. I am uneasy about the Brysons. They planned to go to Ollie’s home tomorrow to help her. Her home is in Delaware north northeast of Tulsa Now the trip is very dangerous. It’s getting pretty cold tonight.\n\nJanuary 18, 1987\n\nSnowed off and on Sunday all last night and all day. It must be 5 or 6 inches deep. I don’t think it has drifted much. It is pretty cold tonight. Joe Vculek, good man, good neighbor, shoveled it off my front porch. The Brysons did not go to see about Ollie. She is in the hospital, safe. The paper says it will start clearing off tomorrow.\n\nJanuary 19, 1987\n\nBright, beautiful day. But cold. No snow melting. I am working on a last final revision of my Creek history. Slow work, slow mind in this 97th year. But I have much for which to be thankful – the beauty of sky and sunshine, the goodness of people, the sight (in one eye) to read.\n\nJanuary 20, 1987\n\nThe sun shone all day – blue sky and all the trimmings. But it was too cold for the snow to melt much. The roads and streets are still almost impassible. A baby here burned its hand badly and Enid helped highwaymen to clear the roads to get it to the hospital in Enid. Later – that happened Sunday but traffic is still blocked.\n\nJanuary 21, 1987\n\nAnother sunny day. The snow is not melting very fast. Too cold. I felt fine. Not much happened.\n\nJanuary 22, 1987\n\nI had an appointment with Dr. Hinson in Enid with Dr. Hinson in Enid tomorrow but this morning I called it off and he was just getting ready to tell me not to come. The weather people at Okla. City say Okla has had the biggest snow in recorded history. It was 42 inches while the big snow before Xmas in 1918 was 41 inches. But I remember the 1918 blizzard was much worse because the wind was so high. It caught the passenger trains (one a freight with a passenger coach) in Ada southeast Enid and kept them there several days until a snow plow could dig them out. Today was sunny but the snow is still deep.\n\nJanuary 23, 1987\n\nIt was a clear day until it became a little cloudy in the P.M. But the snow hasn’t melted much and the whole state is locked up. The main highways have been cleared but not much traffic.\n\nJanuary 24, 198[7]\n\nEvadean Huffer came to plan a celebration for my birthday next week. (Don was especially busy.) We decided to have it at our church Sat. morning – the day after my birthday. We did it that way last year and it turned out fine. turned out fine. Another storm struck our state today. It clouded up and became very cold, but I don’t think it snowed. It is not supposed to last very long.\n\nJanuary 25, 1987\n\nSunny day but some clouds. Sunday. Probably not many at church. Main highways are open but country roads are still closed. (Also some Marshall streets are still closed. The snow has melted very slowly. Selma attends church in Crescent. The road was all clear. One Marshall block of the street by her house was closed but she managed to break through.\n\nJanuary 26, 1987\n\nIt was not so cold and I think the snow melted some but the ground is still covered deep. Raymond came this morning. Ollie still in the hospital but they have a good person to stay with her when she gets home. I doubt that she can be cured. Selma went to the funeral of a relative in the south part of the state. Returned about 8:00 P.M. long after dark. I worried about her but she made it safely. The main highways are cleared.\n\nJanuary 27, 1987\n\nBeautiful, bright day, and not so cold I know. Much snow melted though the ground is still deeply covered. My beloved cousin, Dorine Halsted, called me for a long, lovely telephone visit in honor of my birthday, which will be Friday.\n\nJanuary 28, 1987\n\nA lovely day and the warmest we have had. The snow melted fast. As I look out the window I think half the ground was bare by sunset. I worked hard today trying to make sense of the medicare [sic] reports decisions I have received from my last year’s reports. It turned out that I paid Dr. Hinson and Dr. Shields a total of $262 and medicare [sic] reimbursed me only $74.60 so I paid 187.40. It was never this way before.\n\nJanuary 29, 1987\n\nThe snow continued to melt all through the night. In the morning it was all gone. Oh, I saw one place where a great pile had been formed in clearing the streets, and some of that was left.\n\nRuth Rowes called me this evening from Canyon for a lovely visit. And she didn’t even know tomorrow was my birthday.\n\nJanuary 30, 1987\n\nMy birthday. It was a beautiful blue and gold day and not cold. I had the furnace on for a short time when the sun went down but turned it off and it is still off at 9:30. I am now 97 years old. My good friends are planning a party tomorrow.\n\nJanuary 31, 1987\n\nAnother warmish day but cloudy. They had a beautiful birthday party for me in the basement of my church. Dear friends came from Stillwater, Enid, and other towns and many Marshall people it was lovely. But I am tired this evening. And good, generous Jim Horton called from Indianapolis. I am very grateful for the warm friendliness of people. And how hard the good Marshall people worked to make everything perfect.\n\nFebruary 1, 1987\n\nSunday. It rained last night and some this forenoon I think – probably not much water fell. I got two long distance calls from greatly loved people – Ramona Nelson from Jay and my dear cousins Ray and Shirley Worsley from the Chicago area. My house is stacked with flowers.\n\nFebruary 2, 1987\n\nA beautiful blue and gold day, and warm. Not even a fire in my furnace except for a time in the morning and it is now 9:00 P.M. But I will turn it on before I go to bed. I wrote letters today thanking people for all those lovely birthday flowers.\n\nFebruary 3, 1987\n\nAnother lovely warmish day. And I am surrounded by lovely floral arrangements given me by dear friends and receiving lovely cards and letters through the mail. People are so good.\n\nFebruary 4, 1987\n\nBeautiful day outside and inside my house. I am surrounded by beautiful flowers, and piled close at hand are lovely letters, cards with long written messages. And my cousin whom I called my “little sister” – she lived in our home several years after her mother died – called me from California (Her father paid her expenses but he wanted a home environment for her.)\n\nFebruary 5, 1987\n\nIt rained all day (also last night) but probably not much water fell. Selma let me sleep till 8:30 this morning. She came at 7:30 as usual, but let me sleep a while. She washed out a string of my stockings and did other things around the house. I always tell her to give herself credit for the whole time but I am afraid she doesn’t. She is so good to me.\n\nFebruary 6, 1987\n\nIt rained all day and was cold. Seems warmer this evening and has stopped raining. Nothing much happened. People still sending me birthday cards. Bless them.\n\nFebruary 7, 1987\n\nA beautiful day. A white frost this morning but it turned warmer. So warm I still have no heat in the house at 9:00 P.M. A Man named Carl Sadler came to have me autograph some books and I liked him so well he stayed and visited. He works for Gov. Bellmon. My other friends Violet Poindexter and her sister Sylvia Jarvis called me from the New Orleans area for a birthday visit. Bob and Gloria Weber sent me a lovely chrysanthemum.\n\nFebruary 8, 198[7]\n\nSunday. A lovely day. Raymond called as usual. Nothing in particular happened.\n\nFebruary 9, 1987\n\nA beautiful day but colder than usual. I had been getting ready for an interview tomorrow for educational TV channel tomorrow but this morning Mike Hightower of Council Oak Books who is bringing her called and said the reporter had flu so we put it off a week.\n\nFebruary 10, 1987\n\nAnother beautiful blue and gold day. I am still enjoying the beautiful flowers friends sent for my birthday. I have finished reading a very scholarly 601 page publication on the current “Sanctuary Movement” to protect refugees from Central America published by Harvard, written by Gloria Weber and three other law students\n\nFebruary 11, 1987\n\nAnother beautiful day. And so warm I have no heat in my house at 9:00 P.M. But I will turn the furnace on “low” before go to bed. I got a letter from the daughter of the Brandts today. Sally who was so well and active when Joseph Brandt died two years ago soon discovered she had colon cancer and it killed her on Jan. 10. Her daughter sent me a letter which came today.\n\nFebruary 12, 1987\n\nSome kind of day yesterday. Furnace still off at 9:00 P.M. I have been thinking all day about the Brandt’s. Except for Joseph Brandt as founder of the Uni of Okla Press. my writing career would have ended by a doctoral dissertation on a Univ. of Okla. library shelf in 1933. And the success of Choc. Rep. started it all. Then the problem of Waters Run and his constant help, publication at Princeton, etc. I wrote and told him all this 2 years ago and he died suddenly before the letter reached him. I still grieve about that.\n\nFebruary 13, 1987\n\nWent to Enid to see Dr. Hinson. He found me O.K. There were showers all around us, quite a shower in Enid but it quit before we got there. I am pretty tired tonight – plan to go to bed early.\n\nFebruary 14, 1987\n\nThis was a cloudy day and colder than the weather we have been having. Selma’s boy, Steve, came over from Tulsa and took his mother to a Valentine’s Day dinner at Oklahoma City this evening. Her four children are so good to her – the two small step children she brought up and her own two born later. They are all fine young adults. Steve has finished his medical course at Tulsa and is taking his year of supervised experience. Is now in a hospital in a Texas town.\n\nFebruary 15, 1987\n\nIt was already raining when I started to get ready for bed at 9:00. Just then there came quite a clap of thunder. Then quite a thunder storm. It rained all night. This is Sunday and Raymond as usual came to see me before church. His rain gauge showed an inch of water, he said. And it rained all day today and is pretty cold this evening. The Brysons are starting tomorrow for a polled Hereford show in Alabama or Missippi [sic].\n\nFebruary 16, 1987\n\nIt turned cloudy and cold and in the P.M. it started snowing. When I got up from doing some work on my income tax and looked out the window the ground was covered. But apparently the Brysons got off to their Polled Hereford meeting. They are not at home. I don’t know about my interview for the interview people phoned from Feb. 9.\n\nFebruary 17, 1987\n\nThe interview was called off. Mike Hightower sounded discouraged when he called at 7:30 from Tulsa. It snowed all night and off and on all forenoon. But at about noon the clouds moved east and the sun came out. It is surprising how much melted but much is left. I heard a scraping. It was Joe Vculek shoveling my porch clear a path. Good Joe. Fortunately the snow did not drift. It’s pretty cold tonight.\n\nFebruary 18, 198[7]\n\nThe sun shown and most of the snow melted. Nothing in particular happened.\n\nFebruary 19, 1987\n\nIt was a miserable dark cloudy day but it didn’t snow. The Brysons returned today from their trip to the Polled Hereford show. They had no trouble with snow or any kind of bad weather. Missed it all. I had been uneasy about them.\n\nFebruary 20, 1987\n\nIt was a cold day. We had been told a new snow is coming but it seems we missed it. I do not watch TV any more. I find it too hard to manipulate the controls and my hearing is not good enough to hear all the speakers, so I am always behind on news and weather predictions Have to depend on newspaper.\n\nFebruary 21, 1987\n\nWarm day and it was hot this evening at supper time. Now at 9:00 it has suddenly become cold. I turned on the furnace and I think I will turn it higher. I am afraid we are in for another storm.\n\nFebruary 22, 1987\n\nSunday. If a storm was on the way we missed it. It was a warmish day but it seems cold tonight. Raymond came this morning as usual on Sunday. He brings Mabel who works with the children in the united Sunday School and stops and talks with me a few minutes before his class starts at our church with our minister teaching.\n\nFebruary 23, 1987\n\nWarm, sunny day. I had exciting company – the Staton family. Alice and I were nine when I came to Okla. and entered school. She married late (age about 30 and died in East St. Louis of an epidemic that came up the river when her little girl was two years old and her son about 2 weeks. The son Heob Dick Heob of Tucson was here and her little sisters, now old women, June Caston and Nell Thomas. I loved Alice and her little sisters and was very glad to meet her son.\n\nFebruary 24, 1987\n\nSelma is ill and I am terribly worried about her. Violent vomiting in the morning (I don’t know when it started – she was O.K. yesterday evening) which finally quit, but her stomach remained sore. (She sent Elsie Seefeldt to take care of me.) Elsie has been to see her twice and she is better but I am still worried. This was a miserable rainy day.\n\nFebruary 25, 1987\n\nYesterday Elsie wanted to take Selma to the doctor – her doctor lives in Hennesey – but Selma thought it unnecessary. Today she consented and they took her to the hospital in Enid – also the hospital called her boy, Stephen. It is her gall bladder. I am terribly worried about her, but Elsie is greatly relieved to know that she is now getting proper medical care. She was in excellent health Monday. The attack was very sudden Tuesday morning\n\nFebruary 26, 1987\n\nElsie drove to Enid to see Selma. It is her gall bladder. They are running tests. She is in much pain but drowsy (probably from the medicine, entirely conscious but sleepy. They will probably operate on Monday. Her boy, Stephen is is no doubt there now. He was in a town near Fort Worth taking his year of training after graduating from his medical course (osteopath). Of course I am worried. Dark rainy day\n\nFebruary 27, 1987\n\nIt rained off and on all day but was warm. Nothing in particular happened. Ramona called me to ask about Selma and she told me her mother had the operation Selma is awaiting and that removing the gall bladder is fairly simple is fairly simple and that recovery is not complicated. I feel much better after that\n\nFebruary 28, 1987\n\nThey will not operate on Selma after all. I am very happy about it. I hope she will soon be home. Ramona O’Reilly brought brought me a book to autograph and stayed for a visit. I love Ramona. It rained all night last night and all day today. I wish I knew how much water fell. It is getting cold this evening. I have a beautiful amaryllis. It has 4 huge red blooms and a big bud that will be opened tomorrow. Gerry gave it to me. I wish she could see it, but she may not get to church tomorrow, because of the muddy roads, or she could stop by.\n\nMarch 1, 1987\n\nSunday March came in like a lamb – beautiful sunny day. Sunday. I have been trying to tell Gerry about the beautiful amaryllis but she was not at home. But she was at church and Elsie told her and she came after church to see it – brought Clara Schaefer also. All of the huge red flowers were blooming just right. I am so glad she saw it. She is leaving on a trip tomorrow. Gerry can’t drive on the terrible muddy roads with her car. She came to church in her truck.\n\nMarch 2, 1987\n\nAnother warmish blue and gold day. Lovely. I called Gerry. She did not go on a trip. I failed to understand her. I do not hear very well and we were all looking at the amaryllis and talking. I asked her today if she would like to have the bulb when it quits blooming and she said she would. She has been successful with amaryllis bulbs.\n\nMarch 3, 1987\n\nA beautiful blue and gold day, and so warm. I made an appointment with Mr. Jacobs to check my air conditioners Thursday morning. Raymond came to see me this forenoon. He and Mabel have spent four days with Ollie. They got a very good person to take care of her. She takes treatments for her cancer and needs someone to stay with her. This woman takes 4 days off every 4 weeks.\n\nMarch 4, 1987\n\nAnother beautiful day. Nothing in particular happened. Selma is getting along fine in the hospital.\n\nMarch 5, 1987\n\nAnother lovely day. Mr. Jacobs came and checked both my air conditioners and put them in shape. I have been watching the disclosures of the present “Iran gate” scandal. I’ve known for six years that I’ve had no president – only a very convincing liar who can use his actor skills to deceive the public. Now it is coming out.\n\nMarch 6, 1987\n\nAnother perfect blue and gold day. Selma’s sister who lives at Duncan, is coming Monday to take home and will stay with her and take care of her as long as she needs help. But they are still planning to remove her gallbladder, probably in a month or so. Otherwise, she could have another attack like the present one. Vera Long came to see me today. Lovely visit.\n\nMarch 7, 1987\n\nAnother beautiful day. I am working on a final revision of my Creek history. The Road to Disappearance. In my present feeble state it is very difficult. I am trying to rewrite one page. This means counting spaces to make it fit. I get very tired. This afternoon it was so warm I even turned on one air conditioner while I was working. It is 74° in my living room now at 9:00 P.M.\n\nMarch 8, 1987\n\nSunday. Ray Raymond came as usual before church this morning. Good Raymond. I did more work on my Creek history. It is very hard for me. I am rewriting one page and I have to count spaces, which is very hard at age 87 [sic].\n\nMarch 9, 1987\n\nIt turned cold last night. Today was cloudy and miserable and in the P.M. it rained. I don’t know how much rain, but quite a bit. Selma’s sister, who lives at Duncan brought her home from the hospital today and is staying to take care of her.\n\nMarch 10, 1987\n\nIt even snowed a little early this morning. I didn’t see it but Elsie said it did. Dark all day. Raned Rained this P.M. Selma is very active I hear. They plan surgery to remove her gall bladder March 31.\n\nMarch 11, 1987\n\nA beautiful sunny day – cold, but not so cold as yesterday. It is good to think of Selma back home. She is well but rather weak. I am working hard on revising my Creek history – am rewriting one page. I hope I have counted spaces correctly so the new page will fit. My beautiful amaryllis has finaly [sic] folded its blooms.\n\nMarch 12, 1987\n\nLovely warm day. Raymond came this morning and we planned some business Good Raymond. He and Mabel have tomorrow to be with Ollie while the woman who stays with her takes a long week end off. She comes to her mothers home in Marshall. She lives in my block. Selma’s sister went home today. Selma is getting along fine.\n\nMarch 13, 1987\n\nElsie took me to Enid to see Dr. Miller about my eyes. We had a fortunate trip but he doctor made a serious mistake. Told me to continue the drops for my left eye and then gave me a new prescription for my left eye. Two left eyes no right. I am continuing my former schedule until I can straighten it out. I hope he is in his office on Saturdays. Tomorrow is Saturday.\n\nMarch 14, 1987\n\nLovely warm sunny weather continues. Dr. Miller’s office was closed today so I had no chance to ask him about the prescription mix up. After much soul searching we decided that Selma will take over the care of me beginning tomorrow. I hope it will not be too hard for her but she insisted – said she felt entirely well, better than before her illness. And Else was finding it too hard, was glad to quit.\n\nMarch 15, 1987\n\nSunday. Raymond and Mabel are at Ollie’s this week end, so I missed seeing Raymond this morning. But lovely Gerry Schaefer came before church and stayed for a visit which I enjoyed very much. I had asked her to pick up the bulb of the beautiful amaryllis she gave me now that it has quit blooming for I wanted her to have it. She can have them bloom again. It seemed wonderful to have my beloved Selma back. She seems entirely well.\n\nMarch 16, 1987\n\nRainy day. Warm most of the day. Just now (9:00 P.M.) we are having a thunder storm and it’s getting cold. Selma is back well and fine, caring for me. I hope Raymond and Mabel get home from Ollie’s before the storm. Joseph Branen is in the hospital. I am greatly worried about him. It’s also hard on Winnie.\n\nMarch 17, 1987\n\nDark, gloomy day. I don’t remember whether it rained. I failed to record yesterday that I finally managed to talk with Dr. Miller and found he made no mistake. He meant for all the drops were to go in the left eye – none for the right.\n\nMarch 18, 1987\n\nCloudy day and sort of cold, but I don’t think it rained. Nothing much happened.\n\nMarch 19, 1987\n\nWarm day. I even used the air conditioner in the P.M. It turned cloudy in the evening but didn’t rain. Raymond came to check with me. They got home last night at 11:00. Ollie has got cancer in the bone of her shoulder and lower leg. They decided to operate. Raymond is uncertain about the decision but decided to trust the doctors. They say they will have her walking again\n\nMarch 20, 1987\n\nAnother warm day – used one air conditioner in the P.M. I was really ill today. I think it may be the new eye drops my new eye doctor gave me. Selma and I called Dr. Hinson and Dr. Miller’s partner (Dr. Miller not available). We decided to continue with the drops till Monday.\n\nMarch 21, 1987\n\nWarm day. I felt well today. I am working as hard as I can (at my age) to do some necessary revision of my my Creek history, especially rewriting p. 39 which involves much counting of spaces, etc.\n\nMarch 22, 1987\n\nI am writing March 23. I was very ill Sunday, March 22. Don’t know the reason. Dr. Miller changed my eye prescription. Started the new one March 22. Dropped tablets I have been taking 7 or 8 years. Had I developed a mild addiction and suffered withdrawal effects?\n\nMarch 23, 1987\n\nFelt better today. Still weak but O.K. Very hard wind last night, then rain and prolonged thunder storm. But it cleared off and we had a lovely sunny afternoon. My daffodils are glorious – the most beautiful they have ever been. I can see them from my 4 north windows.\n\nMarch 24, 1987\n\nA miserable, dark, cold day. Ramona came came this forenoon with some questions about some revisions she had type typed for me for the new edition of Okla. : Foot-loose. Very complicated but we finished and immediately the lights began to flicker and died. So fortunate we had finished. They stayed off some hours. Back on now. They went off all over town.\n\nMarch 25, 1987\n\nNothing much happened. I was really ill this forenoon, but perked up after I went back to bed in the afternoon.\n\nMarch 26, 1987\n\nDark, miserable day but no rain. Nothing in particular happened. I am enjoying the daffodils in my flower garden below my north windows.\n\nMarch 27, 1987\n\nWarm day, but it is expected to turn very cold tonight. (It will kill my lovely hyacinths. Also the peach and apricots [sic] trees have been blooming and it will kill all the fruit. Raymond and Mabel went to take care of Ollie over the week end and will return Sunday evening. I worked very hard (for me) on sending some some final corrections for Geronimo.\n\nMarch 28, 1987\n\nIt was warm this morning but is really cold tonight – the winter we missed in Jan-March is upon us. My good cousin, Wesley Tilden called me from California for a pleasant visit.\n\nMarch 29, 1987\n\nIt was very cold today. (This is Sunday.) Opal Vculek is in the St. Anthony’s hospital. She has not been well recently and they have found the by-pass surgery that saved her life some years ago has clogged and they will operate tomorrow to make a new artery to her heart. Got notice of a baby girl from Kenneth and Tina Dehn, -- name Sarah Marie.\n\nMarch 30, 1987\n\nNothing much happened today. It was not so cold as yesterday. I haven’t been able to learn about Opal Vculek.\n\nMarch 31, 1987\n\nI was very ill all day. Am making this entry later.\n\nApril 1, 1987\n\nI was well today. Opal got through her three-hour operation O.K. The McCools under Raymond’s direction examined my house for termites. Raymond cale [sic] Dr. Hinson to arrange a nursing home where I shall stay during Sema’s [sic] surgery and recovery but later Dovie Cardin said she would take care of me at home. I am very happy about it.\n\nApril 2, 1987\n\nRaymond Bryson took over the removal of dead grass and weeds around the vacant house next door, which has been a fore hazard to my house. I’ve been working on it since before Xmas to get the town to do something Raymond got it done today and I paid for it. Cost me five dollars. I am very happy about it.\n\nApril 3, 1987\n\n9:00 and my furnace is off. Sunny day. Nothing much happened. I am working on a final revision of my Creek history.\n\nApril 4, 1987\n\nAlice Pipla called this evening and said Joe Vculek had had a severe heart attack. Fortunately he is at the hospital in O.C. where Alice Opal is recovering from her surgery. If he had been at home it might have been days before he had been discovered. They have him in intensive care.\n\nApril 5, 1987\n\nSunday. Daylight saving time started (I’m sleepy tonight). Ray and Shirley Worsley called for a pleasant telephone visit.\n\nApril 6, 1987\n\nAnother lovely day. I have worked on final revisions for my history of the Creeks. Got quit [sic] a bit accomplished – for me.\n\nApril 7, 1987\n\nA lovely day. In the evening it got so warm I turned on an air conditioner and it is on now at 8:30. I worked on correcting errors in my Creek history.\n\nApril 8, 1987\n\nWarm sunny day. Dovie Cardin spent the morning with Selma learning the routine and the locations necessary for taking over. And I called Ramona and suggested they come and remove china and other things I had promised them when I leave this house. I don’t know why I didn’t think of it before. They are things I can’t use any more and they can.\n\nApril 9, 1987\n\nLovely day. I still have the air cond. on at 8:00 P.M. Had a permnant permanent this morning. Ladonna Haken came and gave it to me. But it was too hard. I may not have any more. Clara Schaefer called this P.M. I gave her some dishes I had promised her. She has been troubled with her back. I am afraid she will have it the rest of her life. Her vertebrae are O.K. It is muscular.\n\nApril 10, 1987\n\nSelma took me to Enid to see Dr. Hinson. He said my heart sometimes sends too small an amount of blood to my brain. Causes me some of my bad days. Gave me medicine to correct it. And come back in a month if it doesn’t help – two months if it does. This P.M. Mr. Don Streck came to see me about Prairie City Days – ask if I could ride in the parade. But I can’t and I am sorry. They started that parade celebration for me. Bless them.\n\nApril 11, 1987\n\nLovely weather. Had busy forenoon. My beloved Janet Murphy, head of Prairie City Days celebration needed material for the tours we take to places of community beginnings. I wrote it but George Beeby had a copy – and he is in the hospital. I had to organize my rough copy for her. Her mother, Esther Shelby of Woodward came and got it and I had a fine visit with her. I love Esther. Then Ramona came to get my china I had promised day to give her and it dawned on me to give it to her now so she could be using it instead of waiting for me to die, and I had a good visit with her.\n\nApril 12, 1987\n\nSunday. Cloudy but it didn’t rain. Nothing in particular happened. This is Palm Sunday but since I can’t attend church it is hard for me to realize it. And Raymond and Mabel are with poor little Ollie, so I didn’t see Raymond.\n\nApril 13, 1987\n\nDarky cloudy day. I think it rained some but not much. I worked hard on organizing all my medicine calendar as it can be handled by Dovie if something should happen to me while Selma is in the hospital. Janet Shelby sent me quite a bunch of books autograph for judges, etc… serving during Prairie City Days.\n\nApril 14, 1987\n\nA cold miserable day. And I was ill nearly all day – feel O.K. this evening. Nothing in particular happened.\n\nApril 15, 1987\n\nLovely warmish day. Marshall is celebrating Prairie City Days but I am not able to attend any of the activities. I am glad I have been able to help a little. Today I autographed 8 books the committee in charge is giving to judges etc. This evening Selma was taken to the hospital for her surgery tomorrow.\n\nApril 16, 1987\n\nToday was really hot. In the evening I used both air conditioners. Nothing in particular happened to me. Today was Selma’s surgery. I haven’t heard from her. Alit Alice Pipla called to say Joe Vculek is coming along fine after his bypass surgery. But I am afraid his extremely active days are over. Opal is out of the hospital and is staying with friends in the City as she can be with Joe every day. Claire Pedigo called me from Calif. I had not heard from her for years. Some friend had sent her a newspaper clipping of Prairie City Days\n\nApril 17, 1987\n\nRaymond came to tell me they are leaving for Tulsa to be with Ollie in the hospital. Will return Apr. 25. She is taking cancer treatments. I spent considerable time on a letter to our telephone co-op urging them to change (or muffle the use of) the Conestoga Wagon as symbol instead of our pioneer covered wagon. Hot day – used both air conditioners.\n\nApril 18, 1987\n\nLast day of Prairie City Days. Parade and everything. I was not able to ride in it and spent a very quiet day. Penny Williams sent me a lovely Easter lily. She also told me she was in New York to see the TV documentary. It will be shown (priemeir) [sic] the last week in June – exact date not yet fixed. It was a very hot day. Used both air conditioners. Will use one all night.\n\nApril 19, 1987\n\nSunday. Easter Sunday. Warm lovely day. My lilac has been blooming several days. Rev. Alpers and Rodney Huffer came this morning with the communion service. It was good to see Rodney, who has been a favorite of mine since he was a small boy. His wife, Mary, has returned from a visit to her native Uganda, reports quiet in most of that troubled land. She had been briefly in Tororo but did not meet my friend, Betty Mubiru.\n\nApril 20, 1987\n\nIt turned cooler. Rain perhaps. Learned the TV documentary about my uneventful life will have premiere last week in June. Worked on final revision of my Creek history. Raymond is back home. I suppose one of Ollie’s children is staying in Tulsa while she is at the hospital.\n\nApril 21, 1987\n\nCool day. No rain. Wagon trains (covered wagons) have formed in northern Okla. (and perhaps southern Kansas) have formed to meet at Guthrie for the eightyniner celebration. They stop at the towns. One reached Marshall today. Greeted by Lions Club members who then arranged to have them pass my house with me on the porch to wave. So good of the Lions to do that. Two good people supported me as I stood. I came to Marshall in a covered wagon in 1899.\n\nApril 22, 1987\n\nSelma is home! She called me and talked to me this evening. I am so happy about her. She says she feels fine. Of course Elsie Seefeldt will look after her until she entirely recovers.\n\nApril 23, 1987\n\nAnother warm, bright day. Raymond came to say he and Mabel are going back to be with Ollie. I think they have given up and apparently she has too. She wants to go home for a few days and they are taking her in an ambulance. Janie is coming to see her. (Her sister from St. Louis\n\nApril 24, 1987\n\nAnother beautiful day. Somebody mowed my lawn a couple of days ago and I found out today it was Ernest Vculik [sic]. I never knew him as well as I know Joe but he must be as good a man as Joe. He I called to thank him and he told me Joe is out of the hospital and is staying with friends in O.C. but will soon be home. Of course Ernest and Vesta will watch out for him.\n\nApril 25, 1987\n\nI have so many lovely flowers I can glimpse through the windows. Various kinds of iris, my lilac, spirea, and my beautiful old fashioned yellow rose. I can’t see my bridal wreath or my hedge of white lilacs but no doubt they are blooming too. But I love the yellow rose most of all. Louis Cromer gave it to me. I suppose his parents brought it here in a covered wagon in 1889.\n\nApril 26, 1987\n\nSunday! Another beautiful day. I used both air conditioners in late P.M. I talked with my beloved cousins Ray and Shirly Worsley to tell them they had not missed the premiere of our TV documentary. They were at the annual Easter reunion of their children at their son’s home in Connecticut and stayed to keep his house while they went on a wedding (50th I think) celebration to Bermuda. Ray and Shirley were afraid they would miss the premiere.\n\nApril 27, 1987\n\nAnother lovely blue and gold day. I still have the one air conditioner on. Worked on final corrections and changes in my Creek history. I feel surprisingly well today.\n\nApril 28, 1987\n\nAnother lovely day. Raymond is back home. Ollie is in her home with the nurses and one of her children. Raymond will take me to see Mr. Tagge tomorrow. I told him I hate to see him take this responsibility – would have somebody else take me. He said he liked to get other things off his mind. I really think he came home to help me do this.\n\nApril 29, 1987\n\nLovely day. Raymond took me to Enid to see Mr. Tagge to make my income tax. Good luck – got it all done very easily and quickly. Raymond doesn’t follow state highways – follows hard surfaced roads I always used but Selma always follows main highways. It was a great pleasure to see places I used to know so well. Even the Ivy house where I boarded when I taught a rural school in 1907-8 and 1908. I feel so grieved for the Brysons about Ollie, but I think Raymond forgot a few minutes and enjoyed the trip as we talked about the people.\n\nApril 30, 1987\n\nThis evening Joe Vculek called me. He and Opal have been at home since Saturday. A Close friends from the city – husband-wife team – came and stayed two days (I didn’t know it); then Joe’s brother, Ernest Ernest, has been looking after. Both are doing fine. It was a joy to hear Joe’s voice.\n\nMay 1, 1987\n\nAnother lovely day. Selma saw the doctor today and he told her it is O.K. for her to take over the job of taking care of me, so she will come next Thursday. I had intended to insist on her not taking over for a month at least but she suggested in a nice way, that the doctor knows more about it than I do. I am happy to have her back.\n\nMay 2, 1987\n\nAnother lovely day. But they tell me the wheat needs rain badly and Selma says the soil in her garden is getting very hard and dry. Nellie Moorman called me today and we had a wonderful visit. She and my moth. Her mother and mine were first cousins and after her mother died she lived in our home several years. I used to call her my little sister.\n\nMay 3, 1987\n\nSunday. Lovely day but we really need rain. The Brysons are at Ollies. They have taken her home in an ambulance. Have two two nurses taking care of her. It makes me very sad.\n\nMay 4, 1987\n\nIt was cloudy part of the day but didn’t rain. Very cloudy tonight. I finished final revision of my Creek history – in fact finished a few days ago, but have been going over it and checking it (found one very serious slip of the pen) and completed the checking today.\n\nMay 5, 1987\n\nIt was cloudy this morning but cleared up and didn’t rain. We need rain very badly. I had to stop work on books to check my bank statement today. My working time is very short. I have finished my Creek history and want to start on Tulsa.\n\nMay 6, 1987\n\nCloudy but no rain, so cool this evening I have the air conditioner off and the furnace on. Raymond was here this morning to brin brin bring my completed income tax report. Then he and Mabel are going back to be with Ollie. They have two nurses for her, and a very capable woman to keep up the house. There is no hope for Ollie. It breaks my heart, and most of all I grieve for Raymond and Mabel and her children.\n\nMay 7, 1987\n\nSelma greeted me this morning at 7:30. I have been fortunate to have Dovie during her absence but it w is good to have her back. She called me on the phone while I was writing this last sentence and as always to check with me before bedtime, and it was so good to hear her voice.\n\nMay 8, 1987\n\nAll our days are lovely but we need rain desperately. This was a happy day. Ramona’s mother was in the hospital at the City expecting bypass surgery for her heart. It is not necessary. She is getting along fine – will be going home in a few days. It is 9:00 P.M. Selma just called to check with me. So wonderful to have her back. Only poor Ollie and my grief for the Brysons. And my good Navatril came to mow my lawn this P.M.\n\nMay 9, 1987\n\nDon Huffer came this morning to tell me of Ollie’s death last night. (Learned later it was yesterday P.M.) I grieve for her death but I am glad she did not linger and suffer so long as we expected. After she knew the therapy was hopeless she wanted to live till her youngest child graduated from college and she graduated 2 or 3 days ago. The funeral will be at Delaware Monday.\n\nMay 10, 1987\n\nSunday. Raymond and Mabel are at Ollie’s home. I have been thinking all day of the family and of Ollie’s beautiful life from her babyhood on.\n\nShirley Worsley called me this afternoon for a visit. Ray was at a church meeting so I didn’t hear his voice. I love those two.\n\nMay 11, 1987\n\nOllie’s funeral was at 2:00 P.M. said the Enid paper (on Tuesday) This is Monday but I am writing late. I know many from Marshall drove over there. It is about 100 miles beyond Tulsa. I know it helped Raymond and Mabel to have them there.\n\nMay 12, 1987\n\nAnother lovely day. Raymond and Mabel will stay in the Delaware area for a few days to help Ollie’s children straighten everything out. I have thought of them all day.\n\nMay 13, 1987\n\nReally warm day. All my flowers are blooming. Lovely. I cannot see the mock orange in my back yard but have often thought of it. Today Selma Alic [sic] described it and told how lovely it was. Brought in a branch and put it in a vase. Beautiful. Alice cleans my house Wednesdays.\n\nMay 14, 1987\n\nAnother warm day. And we need rain badly. Selma saw Raymond in town yesterday but he and Mabel may have dashed back briefly to attend to something before they may return to Ollie’s family business. Nobody seems to know anything about their presence here.\n\nMay 15, 1987\n\nRaymond came to see me this P.M. He and Mabel came back sooner than I expected. He looked very tired but he did not shed a tear, even laughed once at something he or I said. Mabel’s nephed [sic] they brought up after his mother died came from Calif, another close relative from Florida were at the funeral he said. And I know many several from Marshall.\n\nMay 16, 1987\n\nAnother warm day. Nothing in particular happened. Raymond left an expression of her personal religious experience Ollie wrote. I don’t know when but it was after the death of Frank. (He died two years ago.) Probably her vic victory over the despair over losing him. It is beautiful. Such a beautiful life. And I have known her from babyhood up.\n\nMay 17, 1987\n\nSunday. Raymond didn’t stop by to see me before church. He looked so tired when I saw him Friday that probably he and Mabel were too tired to attend church. They must be completely worn out.\n\nMay 18, 1987\n\nHot day. I worked on corrections in my Tulsa, which I hope Council Oak Books will publish. Worked hard but didn’t accomplish much.\n\nMay 19, 1987\n\nRaymond put two fans in windows of my back porch to take out the hot air from the air conditioner. He does it every year but it was delayed this year because of Ollie’s illness. It has rained a little tonight.\n\nMay 20, 1987\n\nIt rained ½ inch during last night – rain gauges showed this morning. It didn’t rain today. But I am wondering if we shall have a wet harvest – an ironical ending of the drought that damaged our wheat. I worked a little on Tulsa.\n\nMay 21, 1987\n\nNothing in particular happened. It didn’t rain. Steven De Witt graduates from the osteopath medical school Saturday. He will be Dr. De Witt. I have been busy thinking of something that that will really express my feelings for the inscription in the copy of Prairie City. I will give him.\n\nMay 22, 1987\n\nIt threatened rain all day but didn’t quite do it here. Violet and Sylvia Poindexter called. They will be in Oklahoma Monday and will be coming to see me. I am very happy about it.\n\nMay 23, 1987\n\nSelma came and got me up and started out my day as usual. Then she left to be present at the graduation of Steven at the osteopathic college at Tulsa. By this time he is Dr. Steven De Witt.\n\nMay 24, 1987\n\nSunday. I knew better than to write of Steven’s graduation yesterday. I must have been sleepy when I wrote it. Yesterday evening was the banquet and awarding of honors. This morning was the graduation. It rained much of the day here. I hope it didn’t rain in Tulsa. [Later – it did, though.]\n\nMay 25, 1987\n\nIt was clear today. And this is what we used to call “Decoration” Day. I just learned it this morning. They put it up almost a week because May 30 came on Sat and destroyed a week end. Raymond – bless him – took my flowers out to the cemetery. I have 10 family graves there. I had a beautiful visit this morning with the Poindexter sisters, Violet and Sylvia.\n\nMay 26, 1987\n\nIt didn’t rain today but tonight the sky is covered with clouds. I am afraid it is getting ready to storm. Joe Vculek came to see me this morning. He and Opal are recovering well from their separate operations. Both were near death with their hearts. I am very happy about them.\n\nMay 27, 1987\n\nIt rained two inches last night. There was much lightning about midnight. I had a hectic night.\n\nMay 28, 1987\n\nRaymond Bryson came this morn morning and told me Mabel had a lump in her breast which had been examined and It proved to be a cancer, but it has not spread. He will take her to Enid, he said, in the afternoon and operate tomorrow. I am worried but I think since it is purely local it will not spread and the removal will be final. It rained all afternoon.\n\nMay 29, 1987\n\nIt is now May 31 and I come to these two blank pages. Did I forget to make entries for two days? Yes, that is what happened. I remember now that Mabel was operated on May 29. I guess I was too concerned to make entry.\n\nMay 30, 1987\n\nWritten May 31 Raymond called me from home here in Marshall. They are doing some more exploring before they will be sure of the extent of the surgery needed. Nothing ominous. Just careful planning.\n\nMay 31, 1987\n\nSunday. It was clear today and is clear this evening. I finished some corrections I needed to to make in Tulsa, hoping that Council Oak Books will publish it. I had already mentioned it to them and the Univ. of Okla Press.\n\nJune 1, 1987\n\n[No entry]\n\nJune 2, 1987\n\nWriting a day late. Raining all evening. Nothing much happened.\n\nJune 3, 1987\n\nMabel Bryson is at home – says she feels fine but I do not know the technical facts about her condition. Vera Long came to see me – a wonderful visit. The sun shone all day no rain. Mr. Drayton was going to read Tulsa and tell me what the OK Press would do, but he hasn’t done it yet.\n\nJune 4, 1987\n\nRaymond came and told me all about Mabel’s condition. Very hopeful. Jane [sic] is coming this P.M. to help. Lovely day no rain.\n\nJune 5, 1987\n\nLovely day no rain. Nothing in particular happened – Raymond called by telephone this morning. Everything O.K. Lovely sunny day. No rain.\n\nJune 6, 1987\n\nA very happy day. Raymond brought Tibbie and Virginia to visit me this forenoon. It was a wonderful experience seeing them. I had not seen them for several years. Then in the late P.M. (after my sleep) he brought lovely Janie, who is here to help in the home while Mabel is recovering from the removal of her breast cancer. Another lovely visit. And the sun shone all day.\n\nJune 7, 1987\n\nAnother pleasant sunny day. They have even started cutting harvesting wheat. The fields are wet in spots but if this weather continues the harvest will soon be going strong. This is Sunday.\n\nJune 8, 1987\n\nSelma took me to Crescent to get a permanent. It was hard on me (and (and on poor Selma) but I got through O.K. It was a clear bright day – no rain – but when we drove back home just before noon the combines were still standing in the fields because the dew had not dried yet.\n\nJune 9, 1987\n\nA year ago we heard Ollie’s death knell. And now it has killed her. I grieve about it. It rained this P.M. I am afraid there was no wheat harvested. But I hope a little before the rain started.\n\nJune 10, 1987\n\nNot much rain fell but it was a rainy day – enough to prevent all combining. I had a very pleasant telephone visit from Doris Wilkins. She was in my class in Indian history at the NLEA institute at the University of Oklahoma. I think it was the summer of 1969, and I have had pleasant contact with her ever since.\n\nJune 11, 1987\n\nIt didn’t rain today and I hope the wheat fields dried enough for combining this P.M. and evening, possibly till dark. I hope it will not rain tonight.\n\nJune 12, 1987\n\nSelma took me to Enid to see Dr. Hinson. He found me O.K. Got home early. So early I called Dovie Cardin and she brought me a warm meal at noon. Tomorrow I shall have company. Beloved cousins Doni Sue and my namesake Kramer and Kalamazoo namesake Heather Debo Kramer from Kalamazoo, Don and Martha Dehn from Independence, Mo. And their daughter Deanna.\n\nJune 13, 1987\n\nThey all came in the forenoon. Wonderful visit. Heather is the sweetest and most intelligent child I have ever seen. Just past her second birthday. They took many photographs of her and me. They went on to Oklahoma City to see my portrait in the capitol. She will not be able to remember but they thought they should get us together since I cannot live until she is old enough to remember.\n\nJune 14, 1987\n\nSunday. Raymond came by this morning as usual while Mabel stopped briefly at her Sunday School class. She is getting along fine but was not equal to staying for church service. No rain. I am not sure there was much harvesting done in the afternoon.\n\nJune 15, 1987\n\nAnother day without rain. I had a pleasant surprise. My cousins left me some books to autograph. Among them I found The Cowman’s Southwest. New printing by Uni of Nebraska Press. It has been out of print for many years I didn’t even know about this new printing. Am very happy about it. Of course the copyright has expired and it is in the open field.\n\nJune 16, 1987\n\nAnother good harvest day. They can’t start till about noon on account of the dew, but they can work late. I am autographing a big box of books my cousins left me Saturday. I think so much of these cousins I want to write something special in each book.\n\nJune 17, 1987\n\nThere was a brief thunderstorm this evening but only a sprinkle of rain. But of course it stopped the harvest. Winnie Branen came this morning and we had a very pleasant visit. I love Winnie but I don’t see her very often. Joseph has become very forgetful and requires much care and her days are full.\n\nJune 18, 1987\n\nWe had quite a bit of rain last night – about ½ inch I think. Today was very warm. I spent some time autographing books my relatives left with me Saturday.\n\nJune 19, 1987\n\nIt rained all day. Nothing else happened. I autographed books.\n\nJune 20, 1987\n\nBlank space forgot to make entry. I don’t remember that anything happened. Sunday. Good Raymond Bryson called in the morning as usual. Mabel doing fine. June 22 –\n\nJune 21, 1987\n\nJune 22 June 22 Jack and Della Thomas came this P.M. Brought books for me to autograph. Also gave me a book I was glad to have. When my cousins came with the baby they brought book for me to autograph – new printing of Cowman’s Southwest by Uni of Nebraska Press – had been out of print many years and I did not know of this new one. Very happy about it. I told Jack and Della and they ordered some copies for their store and brought one for me. It is very attractive. Paperback.\n\nJune 22, 1987\n\nJune 22 is on June 21 page. Turn back.\n\nJune 23, 1987\n\nIt was sunny all day – didn’t rain. I suppose most of the wheat is harvested now. Nothing in particular happened. I have every one of my books brought up to their final form. I am not sure of the future of Tulsa. It went through only one printing. I have everything ready for a final one. I am hoping the OK Press will give it to Council Oak Books and Council Oak will do a new printing as they did with Prairie City.\n\nJune 24, 1987\n\nGot a letter from Univ. of Okla. Press for giving me patent to Tulsa. Very generous of them. I tried to call Council Oak books but they were not available. Will try tomorrow. I don’t know why they were not there in office. Sunny day. No rain.\n\nJune 25, 1987\n\nFailed to make entry. No rain\n\nJune 26, 1987\n\nHad very interesting visit from Mr. and Mrs. Bob Davis of Bristow. Mrs. Davis wrote me me a letter saying she wasn’t in the habit of writing fan letters but her husband regarded Prairie City as his favorite book – even drove to Okla. City for unveiling of my portrait in the capitol. She said they had sent copies to their children, had started buying my other books, etc. I liked the letter so much I answered. Said I’d like to meet them. They are fine. Brought books for me to autograph.\n\nJune 27, 1987\n\nBright sunny day. No rain. I was pretty tired today. Too much visit yesterday I guess. Feel rested tonight\n\nJune 28, 1987\n\nJune 29 Sunday. Raymond came as usual before church. Mabel is getting along fine. I think think she will not meet Ollie’s fate. Ollie’s cancer was too far gone before it was discovered – had already spread. Lovely, bright day. Harvest must be about over.\n\nJune 29, 1987\n\nJune 30 I was ill today. I hardly know why. When Dovie Cardin brought my dinner I ate a little and had her stay and take care of cleaning up the kitchen and help me to bed. I slept three hours and feel O.K. this evening.\n\nJune 30, 1987\n\nI was ill again this morning. Alice Pipla comes on Wednesdays to clean the house so she was there. She said her mother-in-law suffered from water being taken from her body to supply the liquid required by the “water pills” which I take also. Selma called the doctor and he agreed so I drank water in the P.M. O.K. this evening.\n\nJuly 1, 1987\n\nSo I drank water and in the P.M. I felt better. O.K. this evening\n\nJuly 2, 1987\n\nApparently I forgot to make entry. Perhaps this was the day I had a fine telephone visit with one of the three pro owners of Council Oak Books. I am hoping they will print a new edition of my book, Tulsa.\n\nJuly 3, 1987\n\nLovely day – not too hot. Nothing in particular happened. Perhaps this was the"
