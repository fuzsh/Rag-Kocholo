As a part of this initiative and based on the concept of “creating a brighter future together,” Nishi-Nippon City Bank, Ltd. and LINE Fukuoka have joined this new project with the goal of granting wishes across Kyushu and all of Japan, as well as inspiring everyone to hope for a better future.\n\nAs the Official Communication partner, LINE Fukuoka will collect the wishes of people living in Fukuoka and all over the country through LINE and project them on the Shooting Star Shinkansen, which only runs for one night in the hopes of being a bridge to the future.\n\nâ Send your Wishes to the JR Kyushu LINE Official Account!\n\nApplications will be accepted from today (Wednesday, January 27). 777 wishes will be selected to be the wrapping (exterior) design of the Shooting Star Shinkansen and posted within the train as well. Those whose wishes are not selected as a decoration will all be posted on the event website and made viewable as posters in stations where the Kyushu Shinkansen stops.\n\nThe wrapping for the Shooting Star Shinkansen (which is scheduled to run on the night of Sunday, March 14) will continue to run until Friday, May 28 as the “Kyushu Shinkansen for All.”\n\nThere is no limit to the number of wishes an applicant can submit. People are also welcome to submit wishes from their children or friends. We hope that you will apply to make your wish heard!\n\nâ¢ Event details (such as the finalized train design and time the train will run) will be announced on the event website at the end of February.\n\nâ¢ The Shooting Star Shinkansen is not a passenger train.\n\nâ¢ Changes may be made to the event based on the spread of COVID-19.\n\nâ¢ Results will be sent out by the JR Kyushu LINE official account at the end of February. The same announcement will also inform people where their wishes are posted on the train.\n\nâ Submitting wishes\n\nAdd the JR Kyushu LINE official account as a friend\n\nIn October 2020, the Fukuoka Smart City Community (FSC below) joint venture was established with nine companies in different fields with LINE Fukuoka as its representative and Fukuoka City as an observer in order to solve important issues for restaurants during the pandemic and co-create events. The group has built a strong foundation for collaboration.\n\nAs LINE’s second location in Japan, LINE Fukuoka will continue to work together with the help of our partner companies, organizations, and local government to bring WOW to users and grow LINE’s business with even more innovative ideas.\n\nâ Related Articles\n\nâ¢ Event website: https://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/train/kagayake_pj/\n\n[LINE Fukuoka Corporation]\n\nCompany name: LINE Fukuoka Corporation\n\nLocation: JRJP Hakata Bldg. 12F, 8-1 Hakataekichuogai, Hakata Ward, Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture\n\nRepresentative: Noritaka Ochiai, Representative Director, President, and CEO\n\nCapital: JPY 490 million (As of January 2018)\n\nEstablished: November 18, 2013\n\nBusiness activities: All development, creation, operational, planning, and sales activities for LINE and related services.\n\nhttps://linefukuoka.co.jp/en/"
