The company name is officially abbreviated as JR-EAST or JR East in English, and as JR Higashi-Nihon (JR東日本, Jeiāru Higashi-Nihon) in Japanese. The company's headquarters are in Yoyogi, Shibuya, Tokyo, and next to Shinjuku Station. It is listed in the Tokyo Stock Exchange (it formerly had secondary listings in the Nagoya and Osaka stock exchanges), is a constituent of the TOPIX Large70 index, and is also one of the three only Japan Railways Group constituents of the Nikkei 225 index, the other being JR Central and JR West.\n\nEast Japan Railway Company History\n\nJR East was incorporated on 1 April 1987 after being spun off from the government-run Japanese National Railways (JNR). The spin-off was nominally \"privatization\", as the company was actually a wholly owned subsidiary of the government-owned JNR Settlement Corporation for several years, and was not completely sold to the public until 2002.\n\nFollowing the breakup, JR East ran the operations on former JNR lines in the Greater Tokyo Area, the Tōhoku region, and surrounding areas.\n\nEast Japan Railway Company Lines\n\nRailway lines of JR East primarily serve the Kanto and Tohoku regions, along with adjacent areas in Kōshin'etsu region (Niigata, Nagano, Yamanashi) and Shizuoka prefectures.\n\nEast Japan Railway Company Shinkansen\n\nJR East operates all of the Shinkansen, high-speed rail lines, north of Tokyo, except the Hokkaido Shinkansen, which is operated by JR Hokkaido.\n\nTōhoku Shinkansen (Tokyo - Shin-Aomori)\n\nJōetsu Shinkansen (Tokyo - Niigata, Echigo-Yuzawa - Gala Yuzawa)\n\nHokuriku Shinkansen (jointly operated with JR West) (Tokyo - Kanazawa)\n\nYamagata Shinkansen (Tokyo - Shinjo)\n\nAkita Shinkansen (Tokyo - Akita)\n\nThe Tokyo–Osaka Tōkaidō Shinkansen is owned and operated by the Central Japan Railway Company (JR Central), although it stops at several JR East stations\n\nEast Japan Railway Company Kanto Region\n\nThese lines have sections inside the Tokyo suburban area (Japanese: 東京近郊区間) designated by JR East. This does not necessarily mean that the lines are fully inside the Greater Tokyo Area.\n\n■ Agatsuma Line (Shibukawa - Omae)\n\nCO Chūō Main Line (Tokyo - Shiojiri)\n\nJC Chūō Rapid Line (Tokyo - Otsuki)\n\nJB Chūō-Sōbu Line (Mitaka -
