        "text": "Demand for luxury train travel has surged in the wake of the pandemic. The leisurely pace and atmosphere of Old-World glamour that define these voyages appeal to travelers seeking time for reflection and deeper connections to the people and places encountered along the way. While Europe boasts the Orient Express, Japan’s Seven Stars in Kyushu represents the pinnacle of luxury rail travel in Asia. Newly renovated last year—and a reader favorite—the Seven Stars celebrates its 10th anniversary this year. With only 10 cabins and a maximum of 20 guests, the deluxe liner elevates the art of omotenashi (Japanese hospitality) to new heights.\n\nIn late August, I climbed aboard the Seven Stars—known as the Nanatsuboshi in Japanese—to find out what it’s like to ride the country’s most elite train. The three-night, four-day Kirishima route runs east from Fukuoka to Oita Prefecture, south to Kagoshima Prefecture and then back up through Oita, returning to Fukuoka. Reservations for tickets are accepted via a lottery system, and slots are already booked solid through 2024. On the morning of our departure from Hakata station, the passengers convened at an exclusive lounge, where crew member Satoko Yamamoto, impeccably dressed in a white conductor’s uniform adorned with gold buttons, briefed me on my itinerary. After a toast to the journey ahead, we were whisked through a priority gate onto the platform.\n\nIn true Japanese fashion, the Nanatsuboshi pulled into the station at exactly 10:37 a.m. Inside, the magnificent interior, designed by Eiji Mitooka, looks like the stage of an Agatha Christie novel set in a fantasy of Meiji-era Japan: a different type of wood was used for the paneling of each car, and the corridors are decorated with intricately crafted kumiko woodwork lattices and gold fixtures. Craftsmen from the region’s most venerated ateliers have designed every detail, from the shoji paper window screens and Aritayaki porcelain lamps in the guest rooms, to the cutlery that punctuates the tables.\n\nGeneral manager Yoshihiro Shiojima escorted me to room 702, one of the train’s two deluxe suites. The 183-square-foot room, sprawling for a train, and so stunning with rosewood touches, a coffered ceiling, and kumiko screens that separates the bedroom from the living area; the ensuite bathroom is furnished with a cypress-paneled shower, Aveda amenities (the compact but powerful Refa hairdryer is also a nice touch), and a bespoke porcelain basin made by the late master artisan Sakaida Kakiemon XIV. The largest suite, 701, is at the rear of the train and has a fabulous picture window, while each of the 108-square-foot main guest rooms come with seats that convert into bunks.\n\nAs we departed Hakata station, groups of children holding burgundy Seven Stars flags and clusters of smartphone-clutching trainspotters waved us off.\n\nMeals aboard the train were elegant affairs. The front dining carriage with its picture window and classic booths was the backdrop to countless impressive and tasty dishes that crossed my table over the next few days. My first lunch on the train set the standards high: kegani crab with grated eggplant and caviar, Chateubriand steak with Japanese peppers, and sea bass with sweet onion puree. Over the course of the trip there were creative French and Japanese-inflected Italian (think horse mackerel carpaccio with Kunisaki olive tapenade and homemade pasta tossed with local bottarga) but the meal that I will never forget was a lavish lunch that included soy-simmered gluten with wood ear mushrooms and strands of pressed tofu tossed with shiso pesto and grilled eel dotted with sansho (Japanese pepper) miso. To drink, there was always a selection of champagnes, wines, sake and Kyushu’s famous shochu.\n\nThe optional excursions were as memorable as the train itself. Day one took me to the secluded pottery village of Onta, where the artisans eschew electricity in favor of water-powered stamp mills for crushing soil into fine powder, kick wheels, and woodfired collective kilns. Day two concluded with a stay at the spectacular hot-spring resort Tenku no Mori, a Relais & Chateau establishment. With just three villas, the property is spread across a lush expanse in Kagoshima Prefecture encompassing 60 hectares of natural beauty, three duck-filled ponds, and a garden that provides the property’s restaurant with 65 varieties of produce. My villa consisted of two spacious sleeping and living areas, with breathtaking views of the Kirishima Mountains, along with indoor and outdoor onsen (hot spring baths). The following morning, I was taken on a tour through the mountainous landscape on the border between Kagoshima and Miyazaki Prefectures, up to the Yatake plain for an open-air lunch overlooking the green valley of Ebino. On the last day, we ventured deep into the forest along a mossy riverbed for a meditation session inside a cave adjacent to the Kumano Magaibutsu, a 26-foot ancient Buddhist relief dating back to the 8th century.\n\nThere was also plenty to do on the train. Activities included a tea ceremony, conducted in the cupboard-sized traditional tearoom decorated with tatami mats, where tea sommelier Naohiro Tsuruta whisked emerald-green matcha in exquisite ceramic cups. For expertly mixed aperitifs, I visited the swanky Kazu Bar, a glittering jewel box in car three with a handful of seats and a midnight-blue ceiling studded with golden stars. Evening entertainment featured live piano and violin music, as well as table-side magic (cooler than you think). But I spent most of the time mesmerized by the view, which moved between thickly forested mountains to verdant rice paddies and charming small towns. On the third day, as we headed back north from Kagoshima along the seaside, I watched smoke curl from the rim of Sakurajima, one of Kyushu’s nine active volcanoes, while sipping a glass of Ruinart to a piano rendition of “The Girl from Ipanema.”"
