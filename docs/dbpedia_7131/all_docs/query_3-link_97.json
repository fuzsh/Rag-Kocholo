        "text": "The Kyushu Railway Company, which is a part of Japan’s biggest rail network, has announced a partnership with multi-chain smart contract platform Astar Network, in order to distribute NFTs in July by working with P.R.O. Co., Ltd.\n\nAlso known as JR Kyushu, the company is part of the Japan Railway Group and is focused on providing interrail services on the Kyushu island, with their other services also including restaurants, hotels and drug stores.\n\nThe upcoming NFTs are geared towards rail users and, according to the announcement, are set to “provide riders with new ways to enjoy Kyushu while maintaining a holistic track record of their travel experience.” These assets will be available on the Astar Network in July this year, not only because of its “low fees [and] high scalability,” but also because of the “team's deep understanding of the Japanese market.”\n\nThe founder of Astar Network, Sota Watanabe, said the following:\n\n“At Astar Network, we’re excited to see more real-life use cases of enterprises exploring and leveraging NFTs to build closer relationships with their customers and provide new value. We look forward to supporting PRO Japan and JR Kyushu in their endeavor.”\n\nThe goal of this project is to offer its owners with the opportunity of having “proof of visiting” as well as a way to memorialize the visit and ride. According to the post, there will be NFTs that you can buy, but also ones that you can earn by using the system, with the kind of NFT you have affecting potential future benefits, such as access to exclusive NFTs.\n\nTogether with P.R.O. Co., a free NFT was given away at this year’s Blockchain Expo in Tokyo earlier this month.\n\nFor additional details, you can find the official article linked in the tweet down below."
