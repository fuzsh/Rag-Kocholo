Kazanjian and Robert Drazin\n\nApril 1, 2010\n\nMuch of the existing research on innovation has concentrated on the study of individuals in small group settings. However, projects marked by multiple teams, high task interdependence, long duration, and large scale have become increasingly common in practice. Very little is known about how extant research findings related to innovation may generalize to such complex settings. Taking a multilevel theoretical approach, individuals' propensity to innovate is hypothesized as the product of individuals' relationship with their work team (team member identification) and their team's relationship to other teams within the organizational system (interteam interdependence). A large, diversified manufacturing firm engaged in a multibillion dollar project that involved the development of a technologically intense, highly innovative, new product served as the research site.\n\nThe Search for Organic Growth\n\nCambridge University Press\n\nEdward Hess and Robert K. Kazanjian\n\nJanuary 1, 2006\n\nAn edited volume of research by leading scholars on a range of topics central to organic growth\n\nMulti-Level Theorizing about Creativity in Organizations: A Sensemaking Perspective\n\nAcademy of Management Review\n\nRobert Drazin, Mary Ann Glynn and Robert K.

Kazanjian and Robert Drazin\n\nDecember 1, 1989\n\nThis paper presents a stage of growth model for technology based new ventures that are postulated to evolve through four discrete stages of growth. Based on a longitudinal sample of 71 ventures, the hypothesis that new ventures progress according to this model is tested and is supported, although not all firms progressed as expected. These results suggest that some variation in interstage transition patterns are due to a progression imperative.\n\nThe Relation of Dominant Problems to Stage of Growth in Technology Based New Ventures: An Empirical Assessment\n\nAcademy of Management Journal\n\nRobert K.
