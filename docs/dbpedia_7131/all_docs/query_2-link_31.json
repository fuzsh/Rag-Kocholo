Hearn, McBride, T. Rogers and J. Brown: A CONCURRENT RESOLUTION TO DESIGNATE WEDNESDAY APRIL 1, 1987, AS \"HANDICAPPED CHILDREN'S DAY\", TO ENDORSE THE \"B.A.C.-COFFEE DAY FOR HANDICAPPED CHILDREN\" PROJECT AND OTHER OUTSTANDING PROGRAMS OF THE EASTER SEAL SOCIETY OF SOUTH CAROLINA, AND TO PROVIDE FOR A JOINT SESSION OF THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY AT 12:00 NOON ON WEDNESDAY, APRIL 1, 1987, AT WHICH TIME THE STATE EASTER SEAL REPRESENTATIVES AND THEIR PARENTS WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY.\n\nThe Easter Seal Society Honored Guests and distinguished party were escorted to the rostrum by Senators Doar, Fielding, Patterson, Martin and Thomas and Reps. HEARN, M.O. ALEXANDER and WASHINGTON.\n\nThe PRESIDENT of the Senate recognized Rep. HEARN who introduced the honored guest as follows:\n\nRep. HEARN: \"Mr. President, Mr. Speaker, South Carolina Law Enforcement, Lieutenant James K. Wilson, who is our Buck-A-Cup Chairman for law enforcement, Roger Whaley, who is the State Easter Seal President, Susan Aude Fisher, our State Campaign Chairman, John Rittick, Executive Director for South Carolina Restaurant Association, Herman Shealy, Executive Director for the Easter Seal Society, and other honored guests who are here with us today. We are honored indeed as members of the Legislature to have an opportunity to join with Easter Seal in kicking off this most important activity, which is Buck-A-Cup Day to raise funds to take care of the handicapped people in our state. To date this organization has raised 3.5 million dollars. They have literally helped hundreds of South Carolinians above and beyond what our state agencies do, without a single cent of state dollars. This is volunteerism at its very finest. Let me say to you that this Buck-A-Cup Day is important not only to the handicapped, but to the parents and all of us who feel empathy with those that need help. I hope before the day is over, everybody in this room will be wearing this Buck-A-Cup seal that is being sold in the lobby by law enforcement officers. The goal this year is $310,000 in this month. Last year they raised some $293,000, and I'm sure they are going to reach it. Today it's my honor to introduce our Easter Seal children. The first child will be introduced by Representative SNOW and Senator Doar.\"\n\nSenator Doar: \"Ladies and gentlemen, it is a pleasure for us in the Georgetown Delegation to participate in this event this afternoon. It is regrettable, however, that the individual, Gerald Avant, who we were to introduce to you is going into the hospital today in Georgetown. He will not be with us as he is undergoing some medical procedures today. I would like for Bubber, if he would hold that up, that's a picture of Gerald Avant. To give you a little bit of background about Gerald, he's four years old and he's from the Andrews area of Georgetown County. His parents are James and Linda Avant, who I'm sure are with Gerald this morning. He has a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. Gerald has received physical and occupational therapy from Easter Seals for the past three years. He has made significant progress in sitting with assistance, grasping objects, and is now working on his feeding skills. Additionally, he attends an infant stimulation program at the Georgetown Developmental Center. Gerald's cheerful, sunny disposition made him the perfect candidate for the Georgetown United Way's campaign promotion. He was featured in their video presentation as well as campaign brochures. Gerald has never met a stranger. So, it gives me a great deal of pleasure, although he is not with us today, to present Gerald Avant from Georgetown County.\"\n\nRep. HEARN: \"Our next child will be presented by Senator Fielding and Representative WHIPPER.\"\n\nRep. WHIPPER: \"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. I am very pleased to be able to present to you from Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina, Jessica Ashley Kent, the three-year-old daughter of Jeffrey and Carolyn Kent. Her diagnosis of cerebral palsy gives her limited muscle control and requires her use of a wheelchair. She receives physical therapy from the Charles Webb Easter Seal Center as well as participating in their developmentally-based preschool program. She has made tremendous improvement since receiving Easter Seal services. Jessica is a very self-assured and personable child and she loves to color and sing. Isn't she pretty?\"\n\nRep. HEARN: \"Our next child will be presented by Senator Kay Patterson and Representative FRANK McBRIDE.\"\n\nRep. McBRIDE: \"Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. It gives me great honor, along with Senator Patterson, to present to you today Monica Nelson. She is the six-year-old daughter of Varnelle Nelson of Columbia, South Carolina. Monica has cerebral palsy and has received physical therapy, speech therapy and clinical follow-up at the Rose M. Lowe Easter Seal Center since 1983. She has made great strides toward independence, progressing from using a walker to now walking with the aid of crutches. Monica loves to learn and is currently enrolled in the Brockman School. At every Easter Seal therapy session, she proudly relates to the therapists what she learned at school that day. She also enjoys reading, television and is a member of her church's children's choir.\"\n\nRep. HEARN: \"Our next child will be introduced by Senator John Martin and Representative CROSBY LEWIS and is from Fairfield County.\"\n\nSenator Martin: \"It is our pleasure to present to you William Nixon, the son of Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Nixon of Ridgeway, South Carolina in Fairfield County. William is eight years old and also has a diagnosis of cerebral palsy. He has been receiving therapy and clinical follow-up at the Rose M. Lowe Easter Seal Center since the age of two. When William first came to Easter Seals, he was completely dependent in his mobility and self-care skills. He now propels his own wheelchair, walks with a walker in therapy, is making progress with his dressing skills and has progressed from single words to more complete sentences. William enjoys baseball and football - especially when the Gamecocks are playing. An avid fan, even his foot splints, shoes and wheelchair proudly display Gamecock stickers. Today, he even has one on his left wrist. So the delegation and our guests are all unanimous in supporting the Gamecocks. At this time, CROSBY LEWIS will present a gift to our guest.\"\n\nRep. HEARN: \"Ladies and gentlemen, our last guest will be presented by Representative M. O. ALEXANDER and Senator David Thomas. This young man is from Greenville County.\"\n\nRep. M. O. AlEXANDER: \"Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of Senator Thomas and myself, it's a pleasure to welcome Kenny Wilson back to Columbia today. This is the second year in a row that Kenny has been selected as a state representative for Easter Seals. This bright four-year-old is the son of Jack and Joy Wilson of Fountain Inn, South Carolina. Kenny has cerebral palsy and was aided in the purchase of a wheelchair by Easter Seals. Kenny enjoys swimming, is enrolled in school at the Hollis Center in Greenville and attends Sunday School and Children's Church at Wood Memorial Pentecostal Holiness Church. His favorite television program is Wheel of Fortune, and his favorite star on that show is Vanna White. I think that brought out a smile from him. He also enjoys listening to Jefferson Starship. So, join me in welcoming Kenny back to Columbia today.\"\n\nRep. HEARN: \"Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, this concludes our presentation of our Easter Seal children. Would all of you please join in a standing ovation for these people who are so precious to us.\"\n\nLt. Gov. Theodore: \"I know Jessica, Monica, William and Kenny all understand the heartfelt greetings that were just relayed through the members of the General Assembly of South Carolina. We commend each one of you for being excellent citizens of this state and welcome you and compliment you and your families for your accomplishments. We also want to thank, of course, law enforcement and all the other officials who have been so valuable in promoting these particular programs in the past and this particular month for a most important and sensitive program. We thank all of you very much.\"\n\nUpon the conclusion of the presentation, the honored guests and escort party retired from the Chamber.\n\nJOINT ASSEMBLY RECEDES\n\nThe purposes of the Joint Assembly having been accomplished, the PRESIDENT announced that under the terms of the Concurrent Resolution the Joint Assembly would recede from business.\n\nThe Senate accordingly retired to its Chamber.\n\nTHE HOUSE RESUMES\n\nAt 12:25 P.M. the House resumed, the SPEAKER in the Chair.\n\nRep.
