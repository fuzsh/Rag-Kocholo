Vacancies on April 1, 1987, shall be filled as follows: One term shall be until April 1, 1990, and one term shall be until April 1, 1992. Confirmation of such gubernatorial appointees shall be by a majority of the members of the Senate. If other vacancies occur between the effective date of this amendatory act and April 1, 1987, the term shall be the balance of the term to which the predecessor had been appointed. Vacancies after April 1, 1987, shall be filled for the balance of the term to which a predecessor had been appointed. Thereafter, the commission shall consist of five members appointed by the Governor, by and with the advice and consent of a majority of the members of the Senate, for a term of five years. The Governor may submit the nomination to the Senate within 60 days prior to the expiration of the term or the effective date of the resignation of the member whom the nominee would replace and shall submit that nomination no later than 90 days after the expiration of the term or the effective date of the resignation.

No person shall be appointed a member of the commission or hold any place, position or office under it, who occupies any official relation to any public utility or who holds any other appointive or elected office of the Commonwealth or any political subdivision thereof. Commencing July 1, 1977, commissioners shall devote full time to their official duties. No commissioner shall hold any office or position, the duties of which are incompatible with the duties of his office as commissioner, or be engaged in any business, employment or vocation, for which he shall receive any remuneration, except as provided in this chapter.

Such disclosure statement shall be filed with the secretary of the commission and shall be open to inspection by the public during the normal business hours of the commission during the tenure of the commissioner. Every commissioner, and every individual or official, employed or appointed to office under, in the service of, or in connection with, the work of the commission, is forbidden, directly or indirectly, to solicit or request from, or to suggest or recommend to any public utility, or to any officer, attorney, agent or employee thereof, the appointment of any individual to any office, place or position in, or the employment of any individual in any capacity by, such public utility. Every commissioner, every bureau or office director and every administrative law judge employed or appointed to office under, in the service of or in connection with the work of the commission, is prohibited from accepting employment with any public utility subject to the rules and regulations of the commission for a period of one year, and every commissioner is prohibited from appearing before the commission on behalf of any public utility subject to the rules and regulations of the commission for a period of three years, after terminating employment or service with the commission.

When present, the chairman shall preside at all meetings, but in his absence the vice chairman or, in his absence, a member, designated by the chairman, shall preside and shall exercise, for the time being, all the powers of the chairman. The chairman shall have such powers and duties as authorized by the commission as provided in section 331(b) (relating to powers of commission and administrative law judges).\n\n(d) Quorum.--A majority of the members of the commission serving in accordance with law shall constitute a quorum and such majority, acting unanimously, shall be required for any action, including the making of any order or the ratification of any act done or order made by one or more of the commissioners. No vacancy in the commission shall impair the right of a quorum of the commissioners to exercise all the rights and perform all the duties of the commission.\n\n(e) Compensation.--Each of the commissioners shall receive an annual salary of $55,000, except the chairman, who shall receive an annual salary of $57,500.\n\n(f) Open proceedings.--The proceedings of the commission shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of the act of July 19, 1974 (P.L.486, No.175), referred to as the Public Agency Open Meeting Law.\n\n(g) Monitoring cases.--Each commissioner shall be responsible for monitoring specified cases as shall be assigned to him in a manner determined by the commission.
