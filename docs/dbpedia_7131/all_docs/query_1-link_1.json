        "text": "Former railway company encompassing Kyushu\n\nThis article is about the railway company discontinued in 1907. For the company now in business, see Kyushu Railway Company.\n\nKyushu RailwayOverviewHeadquartersMoji, FukuokaLocaleKyushu, JapanDates of operation1889–1907SuccessorJapanese Government RailwaysTechnicalTrack gauge1,067 mm (3 ft 6 in)Length442.8 miles (1907)\n\nKyushu Railway (九州鉄道, Kyūshū Tetsudō) was a company that built and operated railways in Kyushu, one of four main islands of Japan. Most of its lines came under the control of Japanese Government Railways following nationalization in 1907, and many are now operated by Kyushu Railway Company.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nThe company was incorporated on August 15, 1888 in Fukuoka, Fukuoka. The first 22 miles (35 km) of the railway, between Hakata Station in Fukuoka and Chitosegawa temporary station in Asahi, Saga (near Kurume, Fukuoka), opened on December 11, 1889 as the first railway in Kyushu.[1]\n\nThe company expanded the railway by means of both construction and acquisition of other companies. As of 1907, it operated 442.8 miles (712.6 km) of railways in Fukuoka, Kumamoto, Nagasaki, Ōita and Saga prefectures in northern Kyushu.\n\nOn July 1, 1907, the entire operation of the company was purchased by the government of Japan under the Railway Nationalization Act. Consequently, the company was dissolved.\n\nList of lines\n\n[edit]\n\nOperation of Kyushu Railway as of June 30, 1907 Endpoints\n\n(Present station names in parentheses) Length\n\n(miles) Line names\n\n(designated after nationalization) Notes Moji (Mojikō) – Yatsushiro 143.4 Kagoshima Main Line via Ōkura Kokura – Usa (Yanagigaura) 42.6 Nippō Main Line Kokura – Kurosaki 8.8 Kagoshima Main Line via Tobata Wakamatsu – Kami-Yamada 33.3 Chikuhō Main Line, Kami-Yamada Line Hakata – Sasaguri 7.4 Sasaguri Line Tosu – Nagasaki 98.6 Nagasaki Main Line, Sasebo Line, Ōmura Line Kubota – Nishi-Karatsu 26.8 Karatsu Line Arita – Imari 8.1 Matsuura Line Haiki – Sasebo 5.5 Sasebo Line Uto – Misumi 15.9 Misumi Line Yukuhashi – Soeda (Nishi-Soeda) 23.1 Tagawa Line, Hitahikosan Line Nōgata – Ita (Tagawa-Ita) 9.9 Ita Line Kotake – Kōbukuro 3.0 Kōbukuro Line Iizuka – Nagao (Keisen) 3.6 Chikuhō Main Line Gotōji (Tagawa-Gotōji) – Miyatoko (Itoda) 1.9 Itoda Line Katsuno – Kirino (Chikuzen-Miyada) 3.2 Miyada Line Katsuno – Sugamuta 2.7 Tagawa Line Freight Soeda (Nishi-Soeda) – Shō 0.6 Tagawa Line Freight Kawara (Magarikane) – Natsuyoshi 1.5 Tagawa Line Freight Gotōji (Tagawa Gotōji) – Kigyō 0.6 Gotōji Line Freight Kawasaki (Buzen-Kawasaki) – Daini-Ōtō 1.2 Hitahikosan Line Freight Azamibaru (Taku) – Yunokibaru 0.8 Karatsu Line Freight Ōchi junction – Ōchi 0.5 Karatsu Line Freight Ōshima – Nishi-Karatsu 0.8 Karatsu Line Freight (Overlap of Hakata – Yoshizuka) (1.0) Total 442.8\n\nRolling stock\n\n[edit]\n\nA special coach made by German car manufacturer van der Zypen & Charlier was imported by Kyushu Railway for VIP use in 1891. The coach was improved and designated as the imperial coach in 1902 for use by Emperor Meiji when he visited an army drill in Kumamoto Prefecture. After the nationalization, the coach was called the imperial coach No. 2 but was not used again by the emperor. It was designated a railway heritage (鉄道記念物, tetsudō kinenbutsu) in 1963 and is now exhibited at the Railway Museum in Saitama.[2]\n\nFleet of Kyushu Railway[3] Year Steam\n\nlocomotives Passenger\n\ncars Freight cars etc. Wagons Trucks 1890 3 38 107 1900 159 302 649 3,173 1906 244 392 1,048 5,300\n\nKyushu Railway History Museum\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Kyushu Railway History Museum was established near Mojikō Station in Kitakyūshū in 2003.
