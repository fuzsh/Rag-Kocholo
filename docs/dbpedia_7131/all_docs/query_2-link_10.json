        "text": "In 1970's Iredell County Emergency Communications (ECOM) dispatched EMS, Rescue, Troutman Fire and North-end Fire agencies.\n\nJim Barnes was the very First ECOM Director and John Fleming of Mooresville dispatched the South-end agencies.\n\nStatesville dispatched via using call boxes and they called Statesville a Fire District.\n\nLate 1978, ECOM was put in the same building with the Fire Marshal's Office (FMO) under the Director Chuck Gallyon.\n\nIn the early 1980's (1982/1983), ECOM started dispatching South-end and Mooresville EMS and Mooresville Rescue agencies.\n\nFirst 9-1-1 Call was made on April 1, 1987 in Iredell County, NC.\n\nFirst 911 Caller – Was Iredell County Board of Commissioners; Chairman Larry Hedrick\n\nCircumstance – This was a coordinated event to occur on this date at 10 AM in a Ceremonial display at the Agricultural Center on Water Street, but Larry Hedrick had to dial 9-1-1 earlier than expected, for an actual emergency that was a result of a Traffic Accident on Interstate 77 involving a vehicle that hit a tree head on.\n\nDispatchers – The first call received by ECOM Dispatchers was Marty Byers and Paul Webster.\n\nIn June 1987, Larry Dickerson from the Iredell County Sheriff's Office became the Director of ECOM. In June 1987 ECOM started dispatching for ICSO. Larry Dickerson was the Director for 15 years.\n\nIn 1989, ECOM started dispatching for Statesville Fire Department.\n\nIn 1990's, ECOM took over dispatching Troutman Police Department.\n\nIn 1992 or 1993, ECOM started dispatching for Mooresville Fire Department. (Note: It was speculated that this decision was due to an incident involving a fire and loss of life that prompted this decision, which has never been verified).\n\nAugust of 2002, David Martin became the Director of ECOM and was the 2nd longest running Director, 14 years of service. David Martin retired in 2016.\n\nAround 2013, ECOM started dispatching for Animal Control.\n\nOn February 2016, Candy Strezinski (Miller) was hired as ECOM Director after the retirement of David Martin.\n\nUnder the Direction of Candy Miller, ECOM has implemented the following for ECOM."
