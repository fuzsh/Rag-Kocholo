The report breaks most this information down by Center. Beginning in 1995 NASA has made the workforce report available only via the Web. Another good source is the Federal Workforce Data provided by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management where one can get information about the entire federal workforce (including NASA or any other Agency)."
