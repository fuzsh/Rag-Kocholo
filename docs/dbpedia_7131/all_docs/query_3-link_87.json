Please show consideration for your fellow passengers when storing your baggage.\n\nUsing a seat with an oversized baggage compartment\n\nThese are seats where the passenger utilizes a baggage compartment located on the nearest deck to their seat.\n\nOversized baggage compartments have an upper and lower rack.\n\nThe upper rack can be used for baggage with max. dimensions of 80 x 60 x 50 cm\n\nThe lower rack can be used for baggage with max. dimensions of 80 x 60 x 40 cm.\n\nPlease reserve an aisle seat with an oversized baggage compartment if you wish to use the upper rack. Please reserve a window seat with an oversized baggage compartment if you wish to use the lower rack.\n\nYou will need to use your own contactless IC card such as a transportation IC card to lock your baggage in. * Kindly be aware that some IC cards and mobile terminals cannot be used to do this.\n\nPlease use a seat with an oversized baggage area if your baggage is too big for the compartment racks."
