        "text": "The Kyushu Railway Company presents the Kyushu Shinkansen, a Japanese high-speed train often referred to as a bullet train. Launched in 2004, rail the line connects the district of Hakata in Fukuoka Prefecture with the city of Kagoshima, located on the western tip of Kyushu Island (Japan’s southernmost and 3rd-biggest island).\n\nThere are two kinds of Kyushu Shinkansen trains presently serving the Hakata to Kagoshima route: the 800 Series and N700 Series. Both trains boast a maximum operating speed of 260kms per hour. Most Kyushu trains provide two seating class options: “Ordinary Car” (basically standard class) and “Green Car” (much like first or business class).\n\nThe Kyushu route spans approximately 257 kilometres, with an average travel time of 1 hour, 20 minutes. En route, the train makes a brief stop in several cities which include Kurume, Shin-Omuta, Kumamoto and Izumi (Kagoshima).\n\nSimply purchase a Kyushu Rail Pass to board the Kyushu Shinkansen. This convenient, flexible pass lets you explore the entire island of Kyushu by train or just a specific area of Northern Kyushu. Available as 3, 5 or 7 consecutive travel day passes.\n\nGet your pass to exceptional value and flexibility as you plan an exciting journey through the captivating Kyushu region of Japan!"
