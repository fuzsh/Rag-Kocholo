        "text": "Candidates, Graduates and Parents\n\nTo qualify for a New Jersey state-issued high-school diploma, the minimum GED test score requirements must be met. Passing test scores are kept as part of a candidate's permanent GED testing record and all scores are confidential.\n\nThere were two requirements for passing the GED Tests: (1) earn the minimum passing score on each of the tests; and (2) earn a total score of 2250.\n\nEarning the required minimum scores on each of the tests does not total 2250 points. You must have exceeded the minimum scores on one or more tests to achieve 2250 points or better. A diploma is awarded only to the candidate who met both requirements. If, for example, a candidate earns 2880 points but scores only 400 points on the Writing Skills Test, the diploma was not awarded.\n\nEnglish\n\nTesting in New Jersey started in June 1959. The total passing score needed from that time until December 31, 2001 was 225. From January 2002 until December 2013 the total passing score was 2250.\n\nNon-English\n\nTo pass the GED taken in another language an English Proficiency Test was required. From June 1959 until October 31, 1988 the GED Test 6 was used and a score of 40 was needed on top of the 225. When the Maculaitis replaced the GED Test 6 on November 1, 1988 until December 31, 2001 a passing score on each section of the GED and a score of 133 on the Maculaitis was required. From January 1, 2002 until December 31, 2013 a total passing score of 2250 and a score of 40 on the GED Test 6 was required."
