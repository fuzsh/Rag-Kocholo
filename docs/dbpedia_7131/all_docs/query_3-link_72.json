Simply insert the ticket and collect it as you pass the gate.\n\nThis pass, except for the Fukuoka-wide pass, also entitles you to free seat reservations. All Kyushu pass holders can make as many seat reservations as they wish, while Northern and Southern Kyushu pass holders can make up to six free seat reservations. Those who exceed this limit will be required to purchase a separate express ticket. You can do this at any JR ticket office (Midori-no-madoguchi) or at a JR Kyushu reserved-seat ticket vending machine.\n\nYou can also reserve seats through the JR Kyushu Rail Pass Online Booking website.
