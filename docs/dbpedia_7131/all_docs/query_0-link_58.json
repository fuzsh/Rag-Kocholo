For Ctrip, the co-operation marks the company’s second with JR Railways, having signed an agreement with JR East in April 2018.\n\nJR Kyushu Railway Company Senior Managing Executive Officer Mr. Yohji Furumiya and Ctrip Chief Marketing Officer Mr. Bo Sun signed the agreement at a ceremony held on at Ctrip Headquarters.\n\nKyushu is a popular destination for Chinese tourists and has played a key role in Ctrip’s efforts to boost inbound tourism in Japan. Innovative products that improve accessibility for inbound tourists have driven tourism to the region. The JR Kyushu Rail Pass, a pass that allows free travel on almost all JR lines in Kyushu, has been available on Ctrip’s platform since last April. Furthermore, JR Kyushu has agreed to support Ctrip’s future promotion efforts with Kyushu municipalities by providing advice on popular model routes in the region, as well as resources such as its scenic D&S (Design and Story) trains. The campaign will kick off with a Kyushu experience for Chinese Key Opinion Leaders (KOLs), and will be followed with a series of promotional activities.\n\nJR Kyushu’s Mr. Yohji Furumiya said he is looking forward to the co-operation with Ctrip and elaborated, “We hope that in sharing Kyushu with more Chinese tourists, we will make valuable contributions to the region and build stronger ties between China and Kyushu.”\n\n“Ctrip signed a partnership agreement with Oita prefecture just last month,” said Ctrip’s Mr. Bo Sun, “Kyushu is very popular among Chinese tourists, providing almost everything a tourist could hope for in a destination, from shopping opportunities to hot springs, beautiful cities and towns, and cultural experiences. Through this agreement, Ctrip will share the charm of Kyushu’s seven prefectures with more travelers, and help to increase the accessibility and convenience travel in the region. We hope that Kyushu might become one of Japan’s most desirable travel destinations for Chinese tourists.”\n\nAbout Ctrip.com International, Ltd.\n\nCtrip.com International, Ltd. is a leading travel service provider of accommodation reservation, transportation ticketing, packaged tours and corporate travel management in China.
