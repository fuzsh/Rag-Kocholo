        "text": "On April 1, 1987, Howard Hawks, Tom Hendricks and a team of like-minded business partners – with a vision to build a power plant or two – established Tenaska with the hope and confidence that our team could deliver value to customers and partners with expertise and dedication to meeting their needs. Tenaska quickly became a new company to develop cogeneration power plants in partnership with other companies. Tenaska’s founders placed a premium on fairness and honesty, knowing that strong relationships and a reputation for trustworthiness would serve us well – for decades to come. Tenaska is no longer the newcomer seeking to innovate the way generating facilities are financed and built. Today, Tenaska – a 700-person-strong organization – is among the largest privately held companies in the United States that is adept in natural gas marketing, energy management, development and acquisition of generation assets, operation of power plants and much more. Tenaska continues to be recognized for our financing strength, business acumen and broad skill sets."
