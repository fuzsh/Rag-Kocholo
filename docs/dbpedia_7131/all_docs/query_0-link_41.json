        "text": "Marriott International announced the signing of an agreement with Kyushu Railway Company to debut the company’s signature brand – Marriott Hotels – in Nagasaki, Japan.\n\nOnce opened, Nagasaki Marriott will mark the first Marriott International hotel in the major port city of Nagasaki. The new 200 room hotel will be part of a 13-storey mixed-use development adjacent to the AMU shopping complex and is expected to open in 2023.\n\nNagasaki is an established tourism destination, known for its historic Atomic Bomb Museum and various UNESCO World Heritage-listed sites including Oura Cathedral, Glover Garden and Hashima Island (Battleship Island). Located along National Route 202 at Onouemachi, Nagasaki Marriott Hotel will be directly connected to the new Nagasaki Station making it convenient for guests to access all areas of the city and beyond.\n\n“We are delighted to be working with Kyushu Railway Company to open the first Marriott International hotel in Nagasaki,” said Karl Hudson, Area Vice President, Japan, and Guam, Marriott International. “This signing further underscores Marriott International’s commitment to expand its presence in Japan and we look forward to providing travelers with more opportunities to create inspiring connections and moments of self-discovery while traveling in Japan.”\n\nEach Marriott Hotel is thoughtfully-designed with aesthetically pleasing spaces that will allow guests the space to work, relax, and be inspired. The Greatroom, Marriott Hotels’ signature modern and comfortable lobby space, will welcome guests with everything they need from day to night. Each of the 200 guest rooms and suites is expected to be spacious and sophisticated with premium in-room amenities. The hotel will also feature several distinct culinary dining outlets, including an all-day dining restaurant, a specialty Japanese restaurant, and a lobby bar. Also available is the brand’s signature M Club executive lounge – an exclusive area reserved for Marriott Bonvoy Elite members to relax, work and dine. Additional facilities include a fitness center and a customizable function room for business or social gatherings.\n\n“We are very pleased to be working with Marriott International to open the first Marriott International hotel in Nagasaki,” said Toshihiko Aoyagi, President of Kyushu Railway Company. “Nagasaki is fast growing as an important business and leisure destination for both domestic and international travelers. We are looking forward to welcoming our guests, and offering them unparalleled international standards of hospitality and service with the opening of the new Nagasaki Marriott Hotel in 2023.”\n\nNagasaki Marriott Hotel is expected to mark the first Marriott International property in Nagasaki, and the ninth hotel under the Marriott Hotels brand to enter Japan, adding to the company’s rapidly-expanding portfolio of more than 70 hotels in Japan.\n\nAbout Kyushu Railway Company\n\nKyushu Railway Co. engages in the provision of transportation services with its commuter railway systems.
