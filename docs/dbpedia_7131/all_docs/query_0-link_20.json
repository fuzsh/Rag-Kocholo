        "text": "> Rail Transportation\n\nJapan has one of the most advanced and modern rail systems around the world. When you travel to Japan, you should take advantage of this rail system.\n\nJapan Rail Pass ジャパンレールパス\n\nhttp://www.japanrailpass.net/en/\n\nThe Japan Rail Pass (ジャパンレールパス), also called the JR Pass, is a rail pass for only overseas visitors sold by the Japan Railways Group, and is valid for travel on all major forms of transportation provided by the JR Group in Japan, with a few exceptions.\n\nThe Rail Pass is designed to stimulate travel and tourism throughout the country. It is only cost effective for long-distance travel, particularly by bullet trains. While the savings from extensive travel can be considerable, those who travel too little may in fact lose money on a rail pass.\n\nThe Japan Rail Pass is of limited use within the big cities. For Tokyo for example, it does cover the Yamanote Line which goes to several popular tourist areas as well as in Osaka on the Loop Line, plus in Kyoto on the Nara and Arashiyama Lines.\n\nThe Japan Rail Pass is also available through some international travel agents.\n\nShinkansen, the Bullet Train, 新幹線\n\nThe Shinkansen, meaning new trunkline, but colloquially known in English as the bullet train, is a network of high-speed railway lines in Japan. Initially, it was built to connect distant Japanese regions with Tokyo, the capital, in order to aid economic growth and development.\n\nThe shinkansen high-speed trains are the fastest way to discover all of Japan, reaching a speed of 320 km/h (199 mph). The Japan Railways (JR) network, which can be accessed by the Japan Rail Pass, practically covers all the country, with the addition of the new Hokkaido Shinkansen, and the popular Tokaido Shinkansen. The nine Shinkansen lines take you in different directions around Japan. Two of them, the Kyushu and the Tokaido Shinkansen lines, go south from Tokyo. The Sanyo Shinkansen line also runs south but departs from Shin-Osaka. The other six lines either take you north or inland from Tokyo. These are the Akita, Hokuriku, Joetsu, Tohoku, Yamagata Shinkansen lines. Finally, the Hokkaido line takes you the furthest north, all the way to Hokkaido island.\n\nHokkaido Railway Company\n\nOperates Hokkaidō Shinkansen in Hokkaido\n\nhttps://www.jrhokkaido.co.jp/global/index.html\n\nEast Japan Railway Company\n\nOperates Tōhoku Shinkansen, Yamagata Shinkansen, Akita Shinkansen, Jōetsu Shinkansen and Hokuriku Shinkansen (with JR West)\n\nhttps://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/\n\nCentral Japan Railway Company\n\nOperates Tōkaidō Shinkansen in Kantō and Kansai\n\nhttps://global.jr-central.co.jp/en/\n\nWest Japan Railway Company\n\nOperates Sanyō Shinkansen in Kansai, Chūgoku and Kyushu and Hokuriku Shinkansen (with JR East) in Hokuriku\n\nhttps://www.westjr.co.jp/global/en/\n\nKyushu Railway Company\n\nOperates Kyūshū Shinkansen in Kyūshū\n\nhttp://www.jrkyushu.co.jp/english/\n\nThere are different types of trains and services which run on each of the Shinkansen lines. There are express trains which are the fastest, semi express trains, and local trains.\n\nFor instance, on the Tokaido Shinkansen line, which links Tokyo to Osaka, the express train makes six stops, the semi express makes between seven and 12, and local trains stop at all 17.\n\nNozomi のぞみ\n\nNozomi is the fastest train service running on the Tokaido/Sanyo Shinkansen lines in Japan. The service stops at only the largest stations, and along the stretch between Shin-Osaka and Hakata, Nozomi services using N700 series equipment reach speeds of 300 km/h.\n\nHikari ひかり\n\nHikari is the name of a high-speed train service running on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen “bullet train” lines in Japan. Slower than the premier Nozomi but faster than the all-stations Kodama, the Hikari is the fastest train service on the Tokaido and Sanyo Shinkansen that is covered in the Japan Rail Pass.\n\nKodama こだま\n\nKodama is one of the three train services running on the Tōkaidō/San’yō Shinkansen. Kodama trains stop at all stations, making Kodama the slowest Shinkansen service for trips between major cities such as Tokyo and Osaka. The Kodama trains are used primarily for travel to and from smaller cities such as Atami.\n\nJapan Railways Group, JR\n\nThe Japan Railways Group, more commonly known as JR Group, consists of seven for-profit companies (6 passenger lines) that took over most of the assets and operations of the government-owned Japanese National Railways on April 1, 1987.\n\nHokkaido Railway Company\n\nJR Hokkaido\n\nEast Japan Railway Company\n\n(JR East)\n\nCentral Japan Railway Company\n\n(JR Central)\n\nCentral Japan Railway Company\n\n(JR West)\n\nShikoku Railway Company\n\n(JR Shikoku)\n\nKyushu Railway Company\n\n(JR Kyushu)\n\nTokyo Metro and Toei Subways 東京メトロ & 都営地下鉄\n\nThe Tokyo subway is a part of the extensive rapid transit system that consists of Tokyo Metro and Toei Subway in the Greater Tokyo area of Japan. While the subway system itself is largely within the city center, the lines extend far out via extensive through services onto suburban railway lines.\n\nToei Asakusa Line 都営浅草線\n\nTokyo Metro Hibiya Line メトロ日比谷線\n\nTokyo Metro Ginza Line メトロ銀座線\n\nTokyo Metro Marunouchi Line メトロ丸ノ内線\n\nTokyo Metro Tōzai Line メトロ東西線\n\nToei Mita Line 都営三田線\n\nTokyo Metro Namboku Line メトロ南北線\n\nTokyo Metro Yūrakuchō Line メトロ有楽町線\n\nTokyo Metro Chiyoda Line メトロ千代田線\n\nToei Shinjuku Line 都営新宿線\n\nTokyo Metro Hanzōmon Line メトロ半蔵門線\n\nToei Ōedo Line 都営大江戸線\n\nTokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line メトロ副都心線\n\nTokyo Yamanote Line 東京山手線\n\nThe Yamanote Line (山手線 Yamanote-sen) is a railway loop line in Tokyo, operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East). It is one of Tokyo’s busiest and most important lines, connecting most of Tokyo’s major stations and urban centers, including Marunouchi, the Yūrakuchō/Ginza area, Shinagawa, Shibuya, Shinjuku, Ikebukuro and Ueno, with all but two of its 29 stations connecting to other railway or underground (subway) lines.\n\nShinagawa 品川\n\nŌsaki 大崎\n\nGotanda 五反田\n\nMeguro 目黒\n\nEbisu 恵比寿\n\nShibuya 渋谷\n\nHarajuku 原宿\n\nYoyogi 代々木\n\nShinjuku 新宿\n\nShin-Ōkubo 新大久保\n\nTakadanobaba 高田馬場\n\nMejiro 目白\n\nIkebukuro 池袋\n\nŌtsuka 大塚\n\nSugamo 巣鴨\n\nKomagome 駒込\n\nTabata 田端\n\nNishi-Nippori 西日暮里\n\nNippori 日暮里\n\nUguisudani 鶯谷\n\nUeno 上野\n\nOkachimachi 御徒町\n\nAkihabara 秋葉原\n\nKanda 神田\n\nTokyo 東京\n\nYūrakuchō 有楽町\n\nShimbashi 新橋\n\nHamamatsuchō 浜松町\n\nTamachi 田町\n\nTakanawa Gateway 高輪ゲートウェイ\n\nTokyo Chūō Main Line 中央本線\n\nBetween Tokyo and Shinjuku 東京駅ー新宿駅\n\nThe Chūō Main Line (中央本線), commonly called the Chūō Line, is one of the major trunk railway lines in Japan. It connects Tokyo and Nagoya, although it is the slowest direct railway connection between the two cities; the coastal Tōkaidō Main Line is slightly faster, and the Tōkaidō Shinkansen is the fastest rail link between the cities.\n\nThe Chūō Main Line connects Tokyo to Shinjuku by direct route instead of having to go around the loop, Yamanote Line."
