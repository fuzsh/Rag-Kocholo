        "text": "Explore Kyushu easily using the Kyushu Shinkansen\n\nTravel swiftly and comfortably across Kyushu, Japan’s third-largest island, with the Kyushu Shinkansen. We will take you through the essential details — from selecting the right train service to exploring key destinations along the route. Whether you’re planning a trip or just curious about this high-speed rail service, discover what the Kyushu Shinkansen has in store for you!\n\nWhat is the Kyushu Shinkansen Line?\n\nOperated by JR Kyushu, the Kyushu Shinkansen seamlessly connects the urban pulse of Fukuoka with the balmy southern charm of Kagoshima. This high-speed railway will bring you across Kyushu Island in under 90 minutes. Since its full line opening in 2011, the Kyushu Shinkansen has revolutionized travel around Kyushu, offering a travel experience that is as swift as it is smooth.\n\nKyushu Shinkansen Route and Stations\n\nThe Kyushu Shinkansen’s journey across Kyushu has a total of 12 stations. Starting from the bustling energy of Hakata Station to the tropical embrace of Kagoshima Chuo, each stop is a unique chapter in the island’s story. The 12 stops along the Kyushu Shinkansen are Hakata, Shin-Tosu, Kurume, Chikugo-Funagoya, Shin-Omuta, Shin-Tamana, Kumamoto, Shin-Yatsushiro, Shin-Minamata, Izumi, Sendai, and Kagoshima-Chuo.\n\nHakata Station itself is a microcosm of Fukuoka, the largest city in Kyushu, and also home to Kyushu's main Fukuoka International Airport. It also serves as a vital link to the Sanyo Shinkansen line, enabling travelers to continue their journey to major cities such as Osaka and Tokyo. From Hakata Station, travelers can also explore the region further by connecting to various local train lines, such as the Kagoshima Main Line and the famous Yufuin No Mori train, which offer access to the broader Fukuoka area and beyond.\n\nMeanwhile, Kumamoto Station is a gateway to the heartland of Kyushu and the region's rich history and natural beauty. Highlights at Kumamoto include the majestic Kumamoto Castle, one of Japan's largest and most complete castles, and the tranquil Suizen-ji Joju-en Garden, a meticulously landscaped garden that emulates the 53 stations of the Tokaido.\n\nBeyond the station, travelers can access the Aso region via the Hohi Main Line to experience one of the world's largest calderas and its active volcano, Mount Aso. For beach enthusiasts, the Kagoshima Main Line offers a scenic route to the Amakusa area, where the Amakusa Islands beckon with their pristine beaches and crystal-clear waters.\n\nKagoshima-Chuo Station marks the southern terminus of the Kyushu Shinkansen. Upon arrival, visitors can immerse themselves in the vibrant atmosphere of Kagoshima, a city that harmoniously blends its rich samurai heritage with modern-day allure. The station also provides seamless connections to local lines, such as the Ibusuki Makurazaki Line, which transports visitors to the famous Ibusuki hot sand baths, or the Nippo Main Line for coastal journeys towards the historic city of Oita.\n\nTrain Services on Kyushu Shinkansen\n\nThe Kyushu Shinkansen line offers three main services tailored to diverse needs and destinations. Whether it’s a business trip or a leisurely tour, you can choose between the swift Mizuho, the intermediate Sakura, and the all-stops Tsubame.\n\nMizuho Service\n\nThe Mizuho is the fastest service on the Kyushu Shinkansen, cutting through the island with only three stops: Hakata, Kumamoto, and Kagoshima-Chuo. This cross-island journey will take around 1 hour 15 minutes.\n\nBeyond Kyushu, the Mizuho starts from Shin-Osaka Station in Osaka as part of the Sanyo Shinkansen line, whisking travelers through Okayama, Hiroshima, Hakata, to Kagoshima-Chūō in less than four hours.\n\nSakura Service\n\nUnlike Mizuho which prioritizes speed, the Sakura service emphasizes connections. Serving a greater number of stations, Sakura trains ensure that more of Kyushu is within easy reach, stopping approximately twice an hour at certain stations. The journey from Hakata Station to Kagoshima-Chuo Station will take 1 hour 36 minutes, about 20 minutes longer than the Mizuho trains.\n\nThese Sakura trains also offer the convenience of through services to Shin-Osaka Station via the Sanyo Shinkansen for those heading to or coming from the Kansai region, making the journey from Shin-Osaka to Kagoshima-Chuo in about 4 hours 15 minutes.\n\nTsubame Service\n\nThe Tsubame service, ideal for those who prefer to explore smaller towns along the way, serves as the local train of the Shinkansen line making stops at all 12 stations. The journey from Hakata Station to Kagoshima-Chuo Station will take 1 hour 48 minutes instead.\n\nGreen Car vs Ordinary Car on Kyushu Shinkansen\n\nWhen taking the Shinkansen, you'll be presented with the options of the business-class Green Car or the standard comfort of the Ordinary Car. Each option offers a different level of service and amenities.\n\nShinkansen Green Car\n\nThe Green Car on board Japan's bullet trains is the epitome of tranquility and comfort, offering you a comfortable and luxurious ride. It features 2x2 seating that allows for a 40-degree recline and includes a multi-angle footrest, ensuring extra relaxation during the journey. The larger windows provide scenic views of the picturesque Japanese countryside, enhancing the travel experience. A mobile plug is also available at each seat for you to keep your devices charged.\n\nOn the Kyushu Shinkansen, the Green Car is available on most Mizuho and Sakura trains, but only selected Tsubame trains.\n\nShinkansen Ordinary Car\n\nBy contrast, the Ordinary Car is a popular choice for most passengers on the Kyushu Shinkansen. These cars provide all the essential amenities, such as overhead storage. The 2+3 seat configuration allows for a comfortable arrangement, ensuring a pleasant journey even in standard class. You will also have the flexibility to choose between reserved and non-reserved seating, with the latter being a more economical option, especially when the Shinkansen isn’t crowded.\n\nReserved Seats: You will be assigned a dedicated seat on board one of the Reserved cars. The seat and car assignment will be on your Shinkansen ticket\n\nNon-Reserved Seats: You will only be allowed to board any of the Non-Reserved cars and take any available seat\n\nSeat reservation for oversized luggage\n\nFor those traveling with oversized luggage, the Kyushu Shinkansen has provisions for your extra-large bags. Reservations for seats next to designated luggage areas are a must for those carrying items that exceed 160 cm in total dimensions. This ensures a hassle-free journey for you and your belongings, with the added benefit of having your luggage close by.\n\nIt’s a simple process that can be done at ticket machines, or online via Klook, and it costs no more than a standard reserved seat – a small price for peace of mind!\n\nHow to ride the Kyushu Shinkansen\n\nYou can buy your Kyushu Shinkansen tickets easily. First, you can buy them directly at the ticketing machines at JR Stations. If you're planning ahead, you can opt for the convenience of booking your tickets on the JR Kyushu Website or Klook, which is a reliable platform for purchasing Shinkansen tickets!\n\n#KlookTip: Booking ahead will give you peace of mind as you travel through Kyushu, especially during peak travel season when trains tend to be crowded.\n\nHow to book Shinkansen tickets on Klook\n\nBook your Shinkansen tickets with a few taps and you'll receive a confirmation email and your QR code to redeem your tickets. On the day of travel, easily scan the unique QR code at the ticketing machines at JR Stations, and you're all set for an exciting ride!\n\nUsing the Japan Rail Pass\n\nWith the Whole Japan JR Pass, you can unlock the full potential of the Kyushu Shinkansen. With it, you can enjoy seamless travel across the line, including on the Sakura and Tsubame trains. Reservations for seats can be made at no extra charge, ensuring you have a place set aside for your high-speed adventure. Do note that you'll have to pay an additional fee to take the Mizuho trains.\n\nAlternatively, if you're planning to explore more of Kyushu, you can also consider getting a JR Kyushu Rail Pass instead. With 3, 5, and 7-day options, these passes will give you unlimited travel to JR trains in the area you have selected, including all three types of Shinkansen trains.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\nCan I use the Japan Rail Pass on all Kyushu Shinkansen services?\n\nYes, the Whole Japan JR Pass covers the Sakura and Tsubame services entirely, but for Mizuho service, an additional fee will be required.\n\nWhat are the differences between the Green Car and Ordinary Car on the Kyushu Shinkansen?\n\nThe Green Car on the Kyushu Shinkansen offers more spacious seats and a quieter environment, while the Ordinary Car provides standard seating options.\n\nIs there WiFi available on the Kyushu Shinkansen?\n\nYes, there is complimentary WiFi access on some Kyushu Shinkansen trains, but it's limited to open areas and not accessible in tunnels.
