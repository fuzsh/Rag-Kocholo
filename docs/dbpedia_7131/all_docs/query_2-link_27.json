        "text": "A prolonged and very heavy late season snowstorm caused extensive problems over southeast Kentucky and much of the central and southern Appalachians from late on April 2nd through April 5th. The storm system buried most of southeast Kentucky under 1 to 3 feet of snow, with drifts up to 10 feet reported in Letcher County.\n\nThe snow began falling across eastern Kentucky during the mid-morning Thursday, April 2. The snow remained light through Thursday evening with 1 to 2 inches of accumulation reported mainly along the Virginia-Kentucky border. By dawn Friday April 3, four inches of snow had fallen over the mountains of far southeast Kentucky. The heavy snow continued and spread northward over eastern Kentucky, and by Friday evening accumulation ranged from 7 inches at the Jackson weather office to over 18 inches in the Kentucky counties along the Virginia border. A second surge of heavy snow fell Saturday afternoon, April 4th, through Sunday morning April 5. By noon April 5th, the storm system had buried most of southeast Kentucky under 1 to 3 feet of snow, with the highest totals in Letcher and Pike Counties. The Jackson weather office reported a storm total of 17.8 inches. Gusty northwest winds produced considerable blowing and drifting, with reports of drifts more than 10 feet deep in parts of Letcher County.\n\nThe storm had virtually paralyzed southeast Kentucky by the evening of April 3, 1987. The heavy snow had broken many power lines, resulting in more than 18,000 residents without electricity, some until Monday April 6. Emergency shelters were set up at several locations for those without heat. Roads were very hazardous, and even impassable in some areas due to downed trees. Some pictures of the snow taken from area newspapers are included below."
