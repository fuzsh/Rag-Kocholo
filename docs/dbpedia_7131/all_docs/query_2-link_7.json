        "text": "International A3-12 Rebels damaged a key army base in El Salvador, killing at least 43 Salvadoran soldiers and a U.S. military adviser. It appeared to be the most important and successful rebel operation in recent years. Page A1 The Pope labeled Chile a dictatorship and insisted that the Roman Catholic Church must struggle to bring democracy to the nation. John Paul II spoke to reporters aboard a plane carrying him to South America. A1 William Webster will be questioned about Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d's handling of the Iran-contra affair at hearings next month on Mr. Webster's nomination to be Director of Central Intelligence. A6 A third embassy guard was arrested Sunday on suspicion that he violated regulations against social contacts with Soviet women, the Pentagon said. The enlisted man has not been charged with espionage. A1 All nations must support ''glasnost,'' Andrei D. Sakharov told Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher over lunch. ''A more democratic, more open country is safer for the world as a whole,'' he said. A1 Moscow has asked for help from several Western nations in fighting terrorism and has suggested that treaties be negotiated to provide for the return of terrorist suspects, according to diplomats. A3 Israeli officials were divided in their assessment of reports that Moscow would soon permit large-scale Soviet Jewish emigration directly to Israel and more freedom of religion for Soviet Jews. A9 A3 A Socialist Party convention in Italy opened yesterday, paving the way for the possible formation of a new government. Five parties of the governing coalition are struggling to rearrange their alliance. A5 Chirac assured in Reagan talks A7 Peace reigns along Artic border A11 Senators urge diplomacy in Latin America A12 National A14-22 The House easily overrode the veto by President Reagan of the $87.9 billion highway bill, leaving the Senate as the battleground for a major test of Mr. Reagan's power in his final 22 months in office. A1 A $38.3 billion housing bill was approved by the Senate. The bill, which rejects the efforts of the President to cut housing programs, would break a seven-year deadlock in Congress over housing policy. A14 Credit for discovering the AIDS virus will be shared by researchers from the U.S. and France, President Reagan and Prime Minister Chirac announced. The unusual agreement ends a festering scientific dispute. A1 Japan may deny visas to foreigners who are known to carry the AIDS virus and are considered ''likely to spread the virus to many people.'' A spokesman said the country does not plan to screen all foreigners. A18 A hospital faces loss of funds from Medicare and Medicaid because of the transfer of uninsured poor patients to other hospitals. The Government has begun an investigation into five such cases at the hospital in San Pablo, Calif. A17 Public employers may search employees' offices, desks and files without warrants or probable cause, the Supreme Court ruled. But it rejected the idea that there are no limits on such searches. A15 The Justice Department renewed its attack on a local affirmative action plan in the District of Columbia in spite of last week's Supreme Court decision upholding the legality of such programs. A14 Students at black colleges are bearing the brunt of Federal grant cutbacks and are falling deeply into debt to finance their education, according to a new study. A19 The cowboy and his spirit survives. He may drive to work in a truck and sometimes round up the cows with a helicopter, but his basic tools are the same and his sixth sense about livestock remains intact. C1 500 pounds of irradiated papayas were unobtrusively delivered to Los Angeles supermarkets last week. While it is legal to treat some food with radiation to kill pests, it is also controversial. C1 Teamwork urged in cockpit A14 Cold grips South and Midwest A16 Blood-clotting substance tested A18 Washington Talk A20 On the road with Senator Dole The Smithsonian's stock Regional B1-6, B24 Baby M will live with her father. Judge Harvey Sorkow awarded custody of the baby born under a surrogate-parenting agreement to William Stern and stripped Mary Beth Whitehead of all parental rights. A1 Excerpts from the ruling B2 News analysis: The Baby M ruling settled the specific question of who is granted custody of the child, but it does not resolve the question of whether surrogate-motherhood agreements are legal. A1 Questions about surrogate parenting that go far beyond the Baby M case are being raised by experts in philosophy, law and psychiatry. The mood appears to be one of caution rather than quick action. B2 Segregated housing patterns that seemed to be breaking up in the 1960's and early 1970's are reasserting themselves in New York City and its suburbs, according to a wide range of experts and studies. B1 Detectives searching for a motive in the slaying of a Parking Violations Bureau hearing officer are focusing on about 900 cases handled by the officer in recent years, police officials said. B6 The Wollman Memorial Rink earned a profit of about $400,000 to $500,000 in its first season after being renovated by Donald J. Trump. The ice-skating rink was expected to break even. The money will be donated to charity and public works. B3 Rain and wind in New York City turn everyday activities into Olympian events. ''In weather like this, you don't just leave for work,'' said one woman. ''You have to psyche yourself up.''

The M.T.A. announced it would begin spending money by the end of the night. B1 Cuomo seeks tougher penalties for racial violence B5 Jersey plan on auto premiums B24"
