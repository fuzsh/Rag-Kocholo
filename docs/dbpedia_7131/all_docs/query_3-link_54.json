        "text": "Kyushu Railway's (TSE:9142) stock is up by a considerable 9.5% over the past month. As most would know, fundamentals are what usually guide market price movements over the long-term, so we decided to look at the company's key financial indicators today to determine if they have any role to play in the recent price movement. Particularly, we will be paying attention to ROE today.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is a key measure used to assess how efficiently a company's management is utilizing the company's capital. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nHow Is ROE Calculated?\n\nThe formula for return on equity is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Kyushu Railway is:\n\n8.7% = JP¥38b ÷ JP¥442b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' refers to a company's earnings over the last year. So, this means that for every ¥1 of its shareholder's investments, the company generates a profit of ¥0.09.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Kyushu Railway's Earnings Growth And 8.7% ROE\n\nTo start with, Kyushu Railway's ROE looks acceptable. Especially when compared to the industry average of 7.2% the company's ROE looks pretty impressive. However, for some reason, the higher returns aren't reflected in Kyushu Railway's meagre five year net income growth average of 4.7%. This is interesting as the high returns should mean that the company has the ability to generate high growth but for some reason, it hasn't been able to do so. Such a scenario is likely to take place when a company pays out a huge portion of its earnings as dividends, or is faced with competitive pressures.\n\nWe then compared Kyushu Railway's net income growth with the industry and found that the company's growth figure is lower than the average industry growth rate of 9.8% in the same 5-year period, which is a bit concerning.\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous.

Therefore, there might be some other reasons to explain the lack in that respect. For example, the business could be in decline.\n\nMoreover, Kyushu Railway has been paying dividends for eight years, which is a considerable amount of time, suggesting that management must have perceived that the shareholders prefer dividends over earnings growth.\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we do feel that Kyushu Railway has some positive attributes. However, given the high ROE and high profit retention, we would expect the company to be delivering strong earnings growth, but that isn't the case here. This suggests that there might be some external threat to the business, that's hampering its growth. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.
