        "text": "The Kyushu Railway Company (Japanese: 九州旅客鉄道株式会社 Kyūshū Ryokaku Tetsudō Kabushiki Kaisha), officially abbreviated as JR Kyushu (Japanese: JR九州 JR Kyūshū), is the main subsidiary of the Japan Railways Group based on the island of Kyushu.\n\nHistory[]\n\nMain article: Japan Railways Group\n\nBy the 1980s, the Japanese National Railways had become practically insolvent due to the decline of rail transport and fare increases failing to compensate for high labor costs. The Japanese National Railways was privatized and split into seven different companies on 1 April 1987, with the Japanese National Railway Settlement Corporation later formed to distribute the funds among the companies. JR Kyushu was formed from the previous JNR lines that ran in Kyushu. The company is owned by a public float as of 2016, having executed its initial public offering in October that year.\n\nYoji Furumiya is JR Kyushu's current president, having served in this role since 2022.\n\nNetwork[]\n\nJR Kyushu owns 2,342.6 km (1,455.6 mi) of rail lines, including two Shinkansen lines and a number of commuter lines. Their main base of operations is at Hakata Station, with their headquarters located near the station.\n\nPresidents[]\n\nName Term start Term end Yoshitaka Ishii 1987 1997 Kōji Tanaka 1997 2002 Susumu Ishihara 2002 2009 Kōji Karaike 2009 2014 Toshihiko Aoyagi 2014 2022 Yoji Furumiya 2022 Active\n\nTrivia[]\n\nJR Kyushu's image song is titled Romantic Railroad, released in 1989 and performed by Hi-Fi Set. The lyrics were chosen as part of an internal competition of sorts. JR Kyushu published an official music video for the song on their YouTube channel in 2021.\n\nJR Kyushu rolling stock Active AC EMUs Shinkansen: N700 • N700S • 800\n\nCommuter: 713 • 811 • 813 • 815 • 817 • 821\n\nLimited Express: 783 • 787 • 883 • 885 DC EMUs Commuter: 103 • 303 • 305 Dual-current EMUs Commuter: 415 DMUs Commuter: KiHa 40 • KiHa 125 • KiHa 200\n\nLimited Express: KiHa 71 • KiHa 72 • KiHa 183-1000 • KiHa 185\n\nCharter: KiHa 125-400\n\nNon-revenue: BE220 AC BEMUs Commuter: BEC819 Hybrid MUs Commuter: YC1 Withdrawn AC EMUs Commuter: 715 • 717 Dual-current EMUs Commuter: 457 • 475\n\nLimited Express: 485 DMUs Commuter: KiHa 20 • KiHa 31 • KiHa 35 • KiHa 45\n\nExpress: KiHa 58 • KiHa 65 • KiHa 66"
