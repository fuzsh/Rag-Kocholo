        "text": "RAILWAY STRUGGLE AGAINST PRIVATIZATION\n\nHistory of Doro-Chiba and Japanese Labor Movement\n\nby NAKANO Hiroshi\n\nEx-President of Doro-Chiba,\n\nNational Railways Motive Power Union of Chiba\n\nChapter 4:\n\nStruggle Against Division and Privatization of the JNR\n\nI. Nakasone’s “Final Settlement of the Post-War Politics” and the Division and Privatization of the National Railways\n\n1. Impasse of the economic growth and catastrophic national finance\n\nWhy the JNR was to be divided and privatized? The reason was the stalemate of the growth of the Japanese economy. The high-growth period had already passed away around 1970 with saturation of the domestic market. The Japanese economy, severely hit by the “Nixon Shock” of August 1971, received a further blow - the first Oil Shock of 1973. Facing this tremendous crisis of the Japanese economy, the capitalist class resorted to an extensive public funding and massive restructuring of employment of workers. Finally by rushing into the U.S. market, the Japanese economy survived 1970s.\n\nThis caused economic friction between Japan and the United States - “Japan-US imperialist rivalry” - in the last half of 1970s. Crash between the Japanese and the US economies broke out in all industries - beginning with the textile and then automobile, electronics, steel and so on. Japanese enterprises flooded the U.S. market with their low-priced goods, causing operating crisis in all of their U.S counterparts.\n\nAt the same time, enormous public funding put the Japanese national treasury in jeopardy. In this period, the amount of the outstanding national bonds reached 96 billion yen. To look back from now, we may say “only” 96 billion. At that time, however, it was often said, “If left uncontrolled, the outstanding national debt will cause a catastrophe”\n\n2. The crisis of the security policy under the Japan U.S. Rivalry\n\nIt was not enough for Japan as a capitalist, imperialist country, only to go on exporting its own goods in the world market. Military force proportionate to her economic power was indispensable. Japan was driven to make a significant review of the existing Japan-U.S. Security policy under the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty. The Japanese ruling class felt to be confronted with “crisis of the security policy”. The government leaders made a decision to convert Japan into a military power; and the Fukuda administration concluded with the United States “Guideline of Japan-U.S. Security Cooperation of 1978”, so-called the “old Guideline” (in comparison with the “new Guideline” set up later in 1997).\n\nThe Iranian Revolution broke out in 1978. The United States had already suffered a severe defeat in Vietnam. The defeat in Vietnam ruined the status of US imperialism, self designated “top cop”. Meanwhile, the US economy fell into crisis, dollar being steeply depreciated. “The US is nothing to be afraid of”, thought people of the whole world and so began the Iranian Revolution. Before the revolution, the Shahdom of Iran was exceptionally pro-US state in the Middle East and the nucleus of US domination of this area. After the fall of Vietnam, the United States lost Iran. Ayatollah Khomeini, a Muslim leader, seized power. The concept of the “Islamic fundamentalism” began to spread around this period. The revolution in a major oil producing country, Iran, inevitably brought about the Second Oil Shock.\n\nMargaret Thatcher, the “Iron Lady”, took office of the British prime minister in that year. The year after, Ronald Reagan took office. In the same year in the South Korea a people’s uprising took place in Kwangju.\n\nIn Japan, the administrative and fiscal reform was initiated in face of enormous problems - total stalemate of the high-growth, crisis of national finance and revision of security policy. All of these problems were regarded as decisive for the country’s future. The administrative and fiscal reforms began as an urgent measure to overcome the previous way of politics.\n\n3. “Final Settlement of the Post-War Politics”\n\nNAKASONE Yasuhiro, who took office of the prime minister in January 1982, declared in his first news conference: “My mission as prime minister is a final settlement of the post-war politics.” From that time on, “final settlement of the post-war politics” has become his catchword. The intention of the Nakasone administration was a fundamental overthrowing of the “post-war politics” under the constitution with the “peace clause” and a overall transformation of Japan into a state capable of waging a war.\n\nOn the security issue, he proclaimed soon after his inauguration that “the three straits” should be “blockaded” and Japanese archipelago would be made an “unsinkable aircraft carriers”. Breaking the so-called “1 percent of GNP ceiling” on military spending, he urged military buildup.\n\nNakasone, a notorious far right emperor-worshiper and ingrained advocate of a constitutional revision, insisted, “First, we clean up a chamber with the administrative reform, and then enshrine there a dignified constitution; that is our political course”. He went to worship at the Yasukuni Shrine in his official capacity of prime minister. In order to restore patriotic education, he gave priority to the educational reform and established the Provisional Council on Educational Reform, publicizing a “change of the public mind-set” and “establishing of identity as Japanese national.”\n\nThe Nakasone administration dashed for the start of the second phase construction of the Narita Airport, which had been blocked by the struggle of the farmers of Sanrizuka and their supporters since the interim opening of the airport in 1978.\n\nFinally, Nakasone’s top priority of “final settlement of the post-war politics” was the administrative reform, which was promoted by the “Ad Hoc Commission for Administrative Reform”. He proclaimed, “The Division and Privatization of the National Railways is the major task of the Administrative Reform of the Nakasone Administration, a decisive battle of the administrative reform”.\n\n4. The demolition of the JNR - another Japan within Japan\n\nWhen the Administrative Reform set off, the major target was the JNR. Why the JNR? Because the fiscal crisis of the national treasury and the financial crisis of the JNR were simultaneously exploding. Thus the JNR triggered a catastrophe. At that moment, the debts of the JNR had already amounted to nearly 20 trillion yen. The JNR fell into red in 1964, the year of inauguration of the New Tokaido Line, a Shinkansen bullet line, and fell into red before the depreciation basis in 1972. In less than a decade, the deficit of the JNR ballooned to such a huge sum. In the meantime, policies like the “Plan to Remodel the Japanese Archipelago” of TANAKA Kakuei [1972-1974 prime minister] were enforced. The construction of the Shinkansen network was the center of these policies. As a matter of course, the finance of the national treasury and that of the JNR declined at the same time. The debts, accumulated through the endless construction of the Shinkansens and express-highways, were shifted onto the JNR.\n\nThe debts of the JNR were by and large from the money of the Treasuries Fiscal Investment and Loan Program (FILP). Money from the post office savings or the employees’ pension was deposited to the Ministry of Finance (MoF). The MoF in turn lend it to the public sectors. In short, the JNR obtained a loan from the state. The JNR kept, however, its assets under different forms - Shinkansens, station buildings, bridges, tunnels and so on. Therefore, despite of its standing loan of 10 or 15 trillion yen, no JNR bureaucrats thought, “the JNR is in debt”.\n\nIn fact, however, an amount of 10 trillion yen is enormous. At that time, the interest rate was 6 to 8 %. Annual interest of 10 trillion yen was 600 - 800 billion. It is indeed a huge debt. After several years, the JNR’s debt became so tremendous that it paid back 1 to 2 trillion annually. In spite of that the principal of the debt could not be reduced at all.\n\nIn these circumstances, the administrative reform targeted primarily the JNR from the very beginning. The JNR was, however, a formidable entity. It claimed to be “another state within the state”. It operated itself at its own discretion, disregarding government’s decision. Formally it was an organization under the supervision of the Railways Administrative Bureau of the Ministry of Transport (MoT). In this sense, the formal position of the JNR was similar to that of private railway companies. Its dimension was only colossal.\n\nHowever, no JNR personnel, whether management or labor, considered the MoT as the supervising authority. Particularly the JNR bureaucrats were looking down the MoT. For the construction of station buildings, crossings, tunnels, bridges, trains, etc. the MoT has its official standards. But the JNR went on construction, ignoring the policy of the MoT. As a matter of course, 800 tunnels were found not meeting the MoT’s standards\n\nEvery locomotive engineer or train driver of the JNR was also independently qualified; he sat for entrance exam for one of the schools owned by the JNR, graduated from it and, after apprenticeship, received a notification of appointment for engineer or driver. In the private railway companies, qualifications of engineers and drivers are state exams. The JNR called its own exams “state exams” and the “qualified” drove trains with passengers.\n\nThe JNR had everything in its possession. It had its own hydraulic power plants, thermal power plants; the JR companies still retain them. In the past, it had even coalmines. Also the biggest on-line system in Japan was the JNR’s development. Its “Green Ticket Offices” - computerized booking offices for long distance passengers - constituted the first on-line system in Japan. The JNR took a substantial lead in its railway telephone system; when the Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Public Corporation used operator-assisted long-distance call, the railway telephone built a national automated call system with automatic switchboard. There were all kinds of jobs in the JNR - from first class authorized architects to mat maker. There were its own clothing factories producing uniforms of the employees. The JNR had everything indeed.\n\nTherefore, in the past, the JNR officials used to get good positions after their retirement. For example, SATO Eisaku’s last carrier in the JNR was a chief director of the Osaka Railway Administrative Bureau. He launched out then into politics and finally became a prime minister.\n\nIn fact, the JNR was a particular entity within the state of Japan; it used to behave uninhibited, disrespecting the supervising authority. Without a transformation of the JNR, the Administrative Reform would have been impossible. Moreover, totally ignoring consultation with the MoT, the JNR promoted, with the recognition of the Liberal Democratic Party, construction of the railways and electrification program in full swing. Its enormous debts - 10 or 20 trillion yen - increased further. At the year-end of 1985, the long-term debt of the JNR amounted to 24 trillion yen. The Nakasone administration insisted, “No Administrative Reform without the JNR reform “.\n\n5. The attempt of destruction of National Railway workers’ movement\n\n- the core force of the post war labor movement of Japan\n\nThe major aim of the JNR division and privatization scheme was to destroy the national railway workers’ movement, which was core force of the post-war labor movement of Japan. Especially, the Kokuro, the JNR’s dominant union was the main target. Extinction of the name “Kokuro” from the Japanese society was its goal.\n\nAt the same time, it was a scheme inextricably linked with the “right wing unification of labor movement”, which was later materialized in the establishment of the Rengo. In those days there were four national labor federations. The scheme encompassed all of the four federations. Until then, the industrial unions in private sectors had been incorporated into the labor-capital collaborationist movement. Even the Zenkin (Metal Workers’ Federation) , which had exceptionally resisted against this trend, finally joined this movement in this period. Since they were all organizations led by the labor-capital collaborationists, their unification required screening of member unions. Although the Sohyo demanded “comprehensive unification”, many unions were screened out. The put forward several requirements for affiliation: “Unions influenced by the Communist Party are unacceptable”, “Unions with too many radical elements must be excluded”, “Affiliation to the International Confederation of the Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) is the precondition”.\n\nThe movement for a labor movement unification emerged in 1960s. In 1967, President Takaragi of the Postal Workers’ Union published in the Gekkan Rodo Mondai (Monthly Labor Journal) an article proposing an anti-communist unification of the labor organizations. This movement pulled back once the class struggle intensified and gained its ground as the labor movement declined. During the period of explosive struggles, such as the struggle against the Japan-US Security Treaty and the struggle for the regaining of Okinawa, the struggle of the JNR workers against the Productivity Movement, the struggles of the post workers stopping enormous postal matters and so on, the right wing movement for labor unification stepped back.\n\nIn September 1980, the Organization to Promote Labor Unification was established. At this time the unification movement that had been carried on until then mainly by right wing unions outside the Sohyo, expanded, for the first time, to the Sohyo-affiliated unions, with Zen-Nittsu (All Japan Transport Workers’ Union) being their core. In December 1981, the Preparatory Organization for Unifying the Labor movement was set up. Several Sohyo unions participated in it. In 1982, the All Japan Council of Trade Unions in the Private Industries was established by the private sector unions. In this process the Division and Privatization of the JNR was prepared.\n\nLater in February 1988, the Sohyo decided to advocate “comprehensive unification” in its extraordinary convention. From the very beginning of the unification movement, the Sohyo reacted very vaguely to it, without actively opposing it; the Sohyo only demanded “comprehensive unification”, that is unification of all unions “without screening”. Finally in 1988, the Sohyo decide to “launch a new united federation in 1989 if the “unification without screening” is accepted”, and put out a five-point demand during this period, Sohyo unions joined the unification movement by and large.\n\nThe unification of labor movement ostensibly claimed that united labor strengthens workers’ influence and enhances their social conditions. It has been revealed now to be a lie; after the foundation of the Rengo, social conditions of workers have continuously been deteriorated. The presence of the Rengo is hardly visible now. Decades ago, on the occasion of the spring labor offensive, General Secretary of Sohyo, OTA Kaoru, and its Chair, IWAI Akira, used to be interviewed by press along with the then Chief Cabinet Secretary or the Labor Minister. Today, Rengo’s leaders are totally ignored. Now they visit the headquarters of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) or the office of Prime Minister. Recently the President of Rengo, SASAMORI went to the LDP to make a petition; LDP Secretary-General Yamazaki reportedly said, “You vote in favor of the Democratic Party in the election and now ask us LDP to make you favor “. Sasamori replied to it, “Give us a little time. We in Rengo are now critically reviewing our policy of supporting the Democrats”. No worker can expect such a national labor center like the Rengo to answer his or her demand.\n\nThe attempt of converting the whole Japanese labor movement to right and the drive for the Division and Privatization of the JNR have been inseparably combined attacks. We must clearly understand it.\n\nII. Second Ad Hoc Commission for Administrative Reform\n\n1. What was the Administrative (and Fiscal) Reform?\n\nThe leading promoter of the Division and Privatization of the JNR was the Second Ad Hoc Commission for Administrative Reform (Dai-ni Rincho) founded on March 16, 1981. Its head, DOKO Toshio, the then chair emeritus of the Japan Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), was ex-chair of the Keidanren and ex-president of the Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries. He pretended to lead a quite simple life, never drinking in Ginza, Akasaka or Roppongi and eating only cheap and tiny fishes for breakfast. The media misinformed the public on his “incorruptible and austere” personality.\n\nThe First Ad Hoc Commission for Administrative Reform (Dai-ichi Rincho) of the Ikeda administration in 1960s was dissolved without doing any job. In contrast, the Dai-ni Rincho was very active and set up four working groups. The fourth working group was to tackle with problem of the three public corporations: the Japan National Railways, the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation and the Japan Tobacco and Salt Corporation. The chair of the Fourth Working Group was KATO Hiroshi, then a professor at the Faculty of Economics of Keio University. He is now the president of the Chiba University of Commerce.\n\nWhat was the aim of the Dai-ni Rincho? The 1982 platform of the LDP clearly stated, “ the Administrative Reform is a major surgery of the state structure for survival of Japan into 21st century.” KATO Hiroshi said, “if the Administrative Reform is not accomplished, Japan will face again depression and is obliged to remilitarize to launch a new war” and “Without the Administrative Reform, a revolution will break out.” There was a growing sense of crisis within the ruling class, including commentators, intellectuals, ideologues and all those on the side of the establishment.\n\nAmong others, NAKASOKE preached, “the Administrative Reform is a revolution of spirit and a project of remodeling the state”, and insisted on carrying out “ spiritual revolution “, in other words, “ every one must lead a life with a “spirit of self-sacrifice for the country” “devotion of ‘self’ to the ‘public’ “. He concluded: “Mere cost reduction isn’t enough.”\n\n2. The result of the Dai-ni Rincho\n\nStarting in March 1981, Dai-ni Rincho submitted its final report two year later, in March 1983. The final report recommended privatization of the Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Public Corporation and the Japan Tobacco and Salt Corporation with full transfer of their personnel and material assets into new privatized companies. The recommendation on the JNR was quite different. The Fourth Working Group’s recommendation, which determined the framework of the Division and Privatization scheme of the JNR, specified even the numerical strength of the privatized companies: “the JNR must be divided and privatized and personnel of the new private companies should be 215,000 in total.” It meant firing of about 200,000 workers; The JNR had 413,000 employees at the end of the fiscal 1980, when the Second Ad Hoc Commission for Administrative Reform made a start.\n\n3. “Eleven Urgent Requirements”\n\nPrior to this procedure, the Second Ad Hoc Commission for the Administrative Reform submitted a basic report, which proposed “Eleven Urgent Requirements”. In workplaces, these “requirements” were implemented before official recognition. What were the Eleven Urgent Requirements?\n\nRequired are: “Establishment of discipline in workplaces”, “productivity comparable to the private railways companies”, “freeze of new employment”, “outsourcing, reduction of every benefit, deprivation of acquired rights of the employees” - and even such a trifle change is required: “Abolition of free or discount passes for long-time employees, assiduous workers, or their families” for example. These benefits were quite modest ones. Number of passengers on board doesn’t change the operation cost of a train. When you look at “family discount passes”, wives of low salary railmen rarely have opportunity to use it, and still that was going to be abolished. The passes that had been entitled to retirees after their 30 or 40 years work were also to be abolished. From that time onward into 1987 “the full implementation of the Eleven Urgent Requirements” stormed in every JNR workplaces more and more violently.\n\nIn February 1982, the LDP established the Subcommittee for Reconstruction of the JNR, so-called Mitsuzuka Committee as a party organ. Chair of the Committee MITSUZUKA was a chief of one of the main factions, successor of FUKUDA and ABE. MITSUZUKA had been in a friendly term with MATSUZAKI Akira of the JR-Soren/Kakumaru but after a while broke up relation with him. The Mitsuzuka Committee was composed of Members of Parliament who were proponents of “the reconstruction of the JNR.” They visited workplaces of the JNR. We in Chiba didn’t admit their visit. But in Kofu, for example, workplaces were utterly trampled by them. In the period of the Productivity Movement and struggle against it, the opposition parties visited workplaces to investigate into unfair labor practices. This time the ruling LDP visited “problematic” workplaces throughout the country and cried out loudly: “ workplaces are filled with union’s posters and stickers.” and so on. Though the workplaces of the Doro-Chiba were then really full of posters and stickers, they dared not come to us.\n\nThe showy activities of Mitsuzuka Committee succeeded to a certain degree in arousing a public opinion to the need of the JNR reform. Labor unions were totally incapable to confront management’s practice of the Eleven Urgent Requirements that raged over the workplace for five years till the Division and Privatization of the JNR.\n\nIII. Process until the Division and Privatization of the JNR\n\nWe see here two points. One is the response of the unions concerned and another is the response of the JNR, “another state within the state ”, that was to be divided and privatized.\n\n1. “JNR Reformers” and “System Defenders”\n\nAlmost all of the core members of the JNR bureaucracy were “Defenders of the JNR”. “JNR Reformers” were only a minority. The officials having little hope for their success within the JNR became the “Reformers” and after the success of the Division and Privatization many of them obtained good posts. MATSUDA and KASAI, who became later the Presidents of the JR East Company and the JR Tokai Company respectively, had been marginal officials who, under the former JNR system, might be obliged early retirement. This sort of officials became the “Reformer”, while the mainstream officials of the Tokyo Headquarters were almost all the “System Defenders”.\n\nIn June 1983, the Supervisory Committee for the JNR Restructuring was established under the chair of KAMEI Masao, a person deeply committed in the business of the JNR. He was then the president of the Sumitomo Electric Industries, Ltd, which was and is the sole supplier of electric wires and cables to the JNR as well as the JR. Among the committee members was also SUMIYA Mikio, who later became the central figure of the “Round Table Talk of Sanrizuka”*.\n\n*Round Table Talk of Sanrizuka was a scheme to tempt farmers of Sanrizuka Anti-Airport League into capitulation.\n\nThe resistance of the Headquarters of the JNR and its mainstream officials went so far as to refuse the demand of the Supervisory Committee for the JNR Restructuring to provide documents concerning the JNR’s assets and so on.\n\nIn these circumstances, June 1985, the JNR President NISUGI was replaced with SUGIURA Takaya, ex-Administrative Vice-Minister of Transport (MoT). This gave impetus to the drive for the division and privatization scheme. Bureaucrats of the Ministry of Transport harbored intense resentment against the JNR. Although the JNR had been the largest organization under the MoT, Sugiura was the first MoT official to become the JNR President. In the past, no Administrative Vice-Minister of Transport became either the president or even a permanent member of the board of directors. The JNR had never accepted in its office officials of MoT, its supervising Ministry. Moreover, the JNR had not follow MoT’s instructions at all. Therefore, the MoT officials had long developed their hatred to the JNR so violently as to wish JNR’s demolition. It was against this background that Sugiura finally assumed the dominant post of the JNR.\n\nIn fact, it was the marginal groups, not the mainstreams, of respective institutions that took charge of the Division and Privatization of the JNR. Nakasone as a leader of a minor faction of the Liberal Democratic Party had been excluded from any vested interest in regard to the JNR. In contrast the major factions such as Tanaka’s and Fukuda’s were in a position to get enormous interest from the JNR. The Nakasone faction had never been regarded as a client of the JNR.\n\nLet’s take example in the case on the local level. It would be quite natural that a MoT official, temporary transferred to the department chief of Chiba Railway Control Bureau, be welcome by the JNR officials there. It is, however, not the case. On the contrary, when it is the case with the officials of the JNR head office, they are heartily welcome. Thus, the MoT officials who experienced the life in the JNR offices became “ant-JNR.” These sorts of persons were designated to carry out the Division and Privatization of the JNR.\n\nAs for the labor unions, the Doro played a role of shock troops of the Division and Privatization. As you know the Doro is after all a minority union with only drivers. The dominant union in the JNR was the Kokuro comprising national railway workers of various fields of workshops. Nevertheless the Doro became the most active capital’s agent of the capital.\n\nIn the Japanese business society, the JNR was, so to say, a “monster.” Therefore, in order to smash down the JNR, it was quite necessary to mobilize marginal groups, bureaucrats and unions, for this task. These groups had enjoyed little benefits from the JNR, had few vested interests in it, had been displeased with it, in a word, they had possessed nothing to loose in the JNR.\n\nTherefore, the Kokuro had underestimated the attack; and figured that the Division and Privatization of the JNR could not be accomplished until the last minute. By the way, Mr. IWAI Akira once told me “I never thought at that time the Division and Privatization of the JNR would be possible “. That was certainly a common view among the Kokuro leadership.\n\nHowever, in July 1985, immediately after the displacement of the President NISUGI of the JNR by SUGIURA, all of the permanent members of the board of directors who belonged to the Defenders of the JNR were expelled and “Reformers” took over their place. An onslaught started. The state power made it clear whoever the president of the JNR is, it will carry out its policy against every obstacle once it is determined.\n\nThe executive of the Kokuro, however, counted on Defenders until the last moment. They even thought of talking with the Tanaka faction of the LDP. The executive of the Kokuro completely failed to realize how desperately Japanese imperialism needed the capital’s Division and Privatization of the JNR and with what aim it was enforcing it.\n\n2. Cut off of freight service and “Three Pillars of Dismissal”\n\nBefore the Division and Privatization of the JNR finally took place in 1987, the “Eleven Urgent Requirements” had been put into practice as drastic restructuring and rationalization in the workshop. The workforce reduction each year amounted to 20 or 30,000. In 1983, the JNR suspended new hiring and for almost a decade it employed actually no worker. The rationalization measures took off more and more jobs and thus “surplus workers” were forcibly created. These “surplus workers” were sent to newly made “Human Resources Usage Centers.” In this way, the JNR management stirred up workers’ anxiety.\n\nAt that time, the rationalization focused upon reduction of the freight transport. Today, the Japan Freight Railway Company transports its cargo straight to the destination. But the former JNR’s freight system was operated in a yard style. The JNR lines had many yards partway, and freight trains were brought into a yard in order to be switched and realigned according to the destination of each car. The Musashino Line and the Keiyo Line, now being used mainly by passenger trains, were originally constructed for the freight transport. The Musashino yard, a huge modern facility, constructed for them, was demolished and superseded by the straight direct run system almost immediately after it started operations.\n\nThe freight section was the top grosser of the JNR until 1960s. The JNR earned more from the freight than from the passenger. The JNR used to carry more than 30 percent of the total cargo transportation in Japan. In Chiba, in 1960s, the Shinkoiwa Yard was filled with freight trains day and night, and one could not see passenger trains on the Sobu Line from the Shinkoiwa Locomotive Depot. Today, there is rarely a freight train in Shinkoiwa.\n\nThe freight section was drastically cut back during the course of the Division and Privatization. The Shinkoiwa, Omiya, Sintsurumi and Musashino Yards, which had fully been operated around the clock, were demolished all together.\n\nA large number of local lines in the rural areas were abolished. Before the Division and Privatization of the JNR, the local lines, especially in Hokkaido, Kyushu and the areas along the Sea of Japan were transformed into the so-called “third sector” companies - joint public-private ventures. During the process of the fully Division and Privatization, all of the 100 km long railroad of the Tenboku Line was brutally peeled off.\n\nThe labor unions within the JNR were divided into two camps on their stand to the Division and Privatization of the JNR: the Doro. Tetsuro and Zenshiro were for it; the Kokuro, Zendoro and the Doro-Chiba were all opposed to it. Attacks were focused on those opponent unions. It was the Kakumaru of Doro that worked as an active promoter of this attack.\n\nIn June 1984, the JNR management proposed a “Surplus Personnel Adjustment Measures”, comprising a revision of the retirement system, layoff and external assignment. We called this “Tree Pillars of Dismissal.” In October, the management broke off the negotiation with the unions and forced implementation of the proposed measures. “Retirement Recommendation” meant in practice to put pressures on the workers around 55 years old to quit “voluntarily” in return for an extra retirement pay. Also it came to happen very often that workers were “temporarily” transferred to other companies or “temporarily” released from job.\n\nAt the same time, the management notified each union that it would not extend the Employment Stabilization Contract unless the union consented to the “Surplus Personnel Adjustment Measures”. The management extended the contract with the Doro, Tetsuro and Zenshiro, but refused to do so with the Kokuro, Zendoro and the Doro-Chiba. Meanwhile, the Kokuro conducted “Three No’s Movement” (“Don’t retire! Don’t be laid off! Don’t accept external transfer!”). The JNR management attacked the Kokuro as “obstructers of the Surplus Personnel Adjustment Measures”\n\nWhat did the Employment Stabilization Contract imply? The JNR employees had, like the civil service employees today, no employment insurance, because it was taken for granted that they would not be fired. However, Article 29 (4) of the Japan National Railways Act provided for that the employee could be dismissed “in unavoidable operational circumstances such as decline of business quantity.” In order to cancel out this provision, the management used to conclude with each union the Employment Stabilization Contract and extend it automatically each year. Now, this contract was brought on to intimidate the unions: “unless you consent to the Surplus Personnel Adjustment Measures, we don’t extend the Employment Stabilization Contract.”\n\nWhat a perverted argument! By nature, the extension of the Employment Stabilization Contract and the consent to the Surplus Personnel Adjustment Measures are quite other problems. The attack using irrelevant issue for pretext of non-extension of the Employment Stabilization Contract was an extremely unfair union busting.\n\nMoreover, the “Surplus Personnel Adjustment Measures” stated “unions shall not be coerced into external assignment and layoff.” In case of external assignment and layoff, the will of employees should naturally be respected.\n\nTherefore, the Doro-Chiba made its policy clear in this concern: “Our union doesn’t intervene in management’s recommendation; however, the Doro-Chiba fights against the management if they coerce the employees saying ‘unless you comply with the management’s effort, you may not accepted by the new privatized company.’ “ We have no policy of “Three No’s Movement” or do not say to its members, “don’t accept”, because our members would not accept the transfer etc. We do not need union’s direction for that.\n\nNevertheless, the refusal of extension of the Employment Stabilization Contract could not automatically enable the JNR to fire the workers. In Chiba, for example, a lot of personnel were needed for busy everyday operation as there are great demands for transport. Therefore, cut off of workforce doesn’t come into the problem. Canceling of the Employment Stabilization Contract was apparently a means to stir up unrest and anxiety among workers, to break up unity of the labor unions and to bend their will. Therefore, it could produce no material result if the unions and workers stood firm. If one closely considers the matter, it would be evident that the refusal of extension of the contract had not in itself effective force. But because the Kokuro executive presented no definite policy, anxiety and confusion spread among the rank and file Kokuro members in workplaces who were confronted Doro’s intimidation: “Without Employment Stabilization Contract, you shall not be employed by the new privatized company.” Kokuro members began to leave their union.\n\n3. Union busting against the Kokuro with the Doro as its tool\n\nIn March 1983, the JNR management recruited employees for the “wide area transfer” in Hokkaido and Kyushu. There many local lines were to be abolished; a massive “surplus” of workforce was expected. The management then proposed transfer of workers of Kyushu and Hokkaido areas to the areas in and around Osaka and Tokyo where a lot of jobs were supposed to be waiting them. It was apparently a plot worked out by the management and the Kakumaru. The Doro members in Hokkaido and Kyushu areas, especially the drivers, accepted the transfer. As a result a large number of drivers moved from Hokkaido to Tokyo, from Kyushu to Osaka. When they were assigned to the train depots, it produced “surplus workforce” there. Consequently, the workers belonging to the Kokuro were crowded out. Thereby numerous Kakumaru activists have come from Hokkaido, Niigata, Morioka and Moji of Kyushu. The Kokuro activists were thus expelled from the drivers’ workplaces. In this way the plot of the management and the Kakumaru was carried out. In an instant, the Kakumaru became the mainstream in the workshops.\n\nFrom that time on the JNR management opened many in-house stalls, noodle shops, milk stands etc. one after another in the JNR station buildings. Also many Doro-Chiba members were transferred to such stalls.\n\nFor example, let’s have a look at the “vending” workplaces in Tokyo. The job of the workers transferred to this workplace is only to provide the vending machines with canned drinks. Regular employees in their fifties with corresponding wages do this “after-school job.” Why should the transferred employees of a parent company be occupied with the job of its affiliated company - adverse relation! All of the workers transferred to the vending workplaces were the union activists of the Kokuro. In order to control the active and militant Kokuro activists, a large number of assistant stationmasters are posted to oversee them. The personnel costs for that “job” mounted very high. These vending workplaces were made immediately after the inauguration of the JR companies in 1987.\n\nThe drive for the Division and Privatization of the JNR has brought about disruption of the unions in the JNR into two hostile groups. The group of the unions that refused to accept the division and privatization was heavily attacked. The Kakumaru in the Doro played the most active role in this assault. Nakasone commented at a meeting of the LDP in this time, “some labor unions have begun reviewing their previous position”. Thereby he evidently meant the Doro’s conversion.\n\nMATSUZAKI spoke out his conversion in a decisive and noticeable way at this moment. He gave an interview to the Jiyu Shinpo, a paper of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, and another to the Sekai Nippo, a paper of the Federation for the Victory over Communism (a political organization established by Moon Sun Myung of the Unification Church). “We don’t launch any strike”,“I have broken with socialism, Marxism”, “I have left Kakumaru”.\n\nThe management attacked against the acquired rights of the workers. One of the major points was the “Blue Trains” issue. The “Blue Trains” were night trains running from Tokyo to the southern region of Kyushu. The Tokyo Locomotive Depot was in charge of the operation of the Blue Trains. The inspection workers accompanying the drivers on board used to be paid the travel benefits. In order to adjust the difference of the incomes owing to the different amount of the travel benefits among the inspection workers, the unions and the management had agreed that each inspection worker should be paid the same amount of the travel benefits irrespective of his travel frequency. The unions and the management as well had long recognized this practice. Nevertheless, this was used as a pretext of attack. A violent campaign of slanders against the “illegal benefits” was opened up. For example, a phone call was made to the home of the inspection worker of the Tokyo Locomotive Depot: “Is your husband on the train today?” “No, he is now sleeping here”, answered the wife who was not aware of the situation. Her word was circulated to the media. The management of the JNR filed a suit demanding the reimbursement of the alleged “illegal benefits.” Upon the suit, the Doro was the first union to give in to the reimbursement.\n\nIn these circumstances, the major problem lay in the Kokuro: it did not present any policy to fight back till the end. Shortly before our strike of November 1985, I went to the Headquarters of the Kokuro and explained our position: “The Doro-Chiba is determined to launch a strike. In such a situation, we have no other choice.” The leading members of the Kokuro’s executive behaved then quite arrogantly and pompously: The President Yamazaki, lounging comfortably on a sofa with a cigar in his mouth, answered to me, “ So? Well, don’t worry about us. The Kokuro will do when necessary.” “Do you?” so saying, I, a president of a small union, left the Kokuro’s office. On my way back I said to myself, “My dear fellow, you talk big. OK, you'll see some day” In spite of the President Yamazaki’s words, however, the Kokuro won’t take any action on this issue, as we anticipated.\n\n4. The Shuzenji National Convention of the Kokuro\n\nEventually in July 1986, the Kokuro decided a policy to make an “audacious compromise” at the National Convention in Chiba. “Audacious compromise” meant the Kokuro’s official consent to the Division and Privatization of the JNR. However, some delegates demanded that “The Kokuro shall have another convention to discuss upon the detailed policy of the compromise that would be worked out by the National Executive Committee”. It was incorporated into the resolutions of the National Convention in Chiba. According to this resolution, an Extraordinary Convention was held in Shuzenji in October 1986.\n\nIn the period just before the Shuzenji convention, the demand of the management was far more than the acceptance of their “Three Pillars of Dismissal”. In January 1986, the Tetsuro, Doro and Zenshiro issued the “First Labor Management Joint Statement” with the JNR management. It stated that they promote the rationalization and give up strikes and that they cooperate in the JNR reform. And in July, the above-mentioned three unions and Shinkokuro (a split union of the Kokuro) established the Labor Union Conference for the JNR Reform (Kaikaku Rokyo). Then, in August the Kaikaku Rokyo announced the “Second Labor Management Joint Statement”. It referred to the right to strike in the new companies to be born as a result of the planned Division and Privatization of the JNR and openly pledged the renunciation of the strike though in the private companies the right to strike is legalized. Under these circumstances, the Kokuro was urged to make a concession following the other unions. The management, the capital steps up its offensive further once the labor accepts its unreasonable demand. That is how the class relations develop between the union and the capital, or between the union and the state power.\n\nIn the meantime, the bills on the JNR Reform were submitted to the Diet. In July, the LDP won overwhelming 300 seats in the Lower House in the General Election held simultaneously with the Upper House election. At the same time, the JNR management set up more than thousand “Human Resources Usage Centers” throughout Japan. The union activists of the Kokuro and the Doro-Chiba were selectively and forcibly sent into the these installations as a practice of the segregation policy.\n\nThe JNR management threatened the Kokuro that it would cancel the Employment Stabilization Contract on the last day of November 1985, as long as the Kokuro continued “the Three No Movement”. The Kokuro then decided to stop “the Three No Movement” in November 1985 just before the Doro-Chiba went into the strike.\n\nThe management, however, did not made the Employment Stabilization Contract with Kokuro, insisting that district organizations continued the “Three No Movement” despite the executive’ directive to stop it. In 1986, the JNR management put forward a much more difficult requirement: the conclusion of the “Labor Management Joint Statement”. After all, the Kokuro failed to get the Employment Stabilization Contract concluded.\n\nThe Shuzenji Convention was held in those circumstances. Since the delegates of the regular convention remained as they were, the resolution of the National Executive was naturally expected to be adopted unchanged. However, the shop floor workers, especially the activists sent to the Human Resources Usage Centers, angrily stormed at the delegates of the Kyokai faction and the Kakudo faction who supported the “audacious compromise” policy. Those activists gathered in the Shuzenji en masse. The Shuzenji Convention voted down the executive resolution; the officers resigned en bloc; and the new leadership under the president ROPPONGI Satoshi was established. The resigned ex-officers later broke away from the Kokuro, and set up the Tessanro in February 1987. In the district conventions held after the Shuzenji Convention, the district organizations of the Kokuro split one after another.\n\nIn the remained Kokuro, a new leadership of the coalition of the Kyokai faction and the Communist party (Kakudo) was formed. This coalition is still continuing. The Kyokai faction members who had then refused the compromise later built so-called “Challenge Group” and now are promoting the “Four Party Agreement.” We'd like to remind them of what they did sixteen years ago.\n\nThe Refusal of the “audacious compromise” policy in the Shuzenji Extraordinary Convention has made the Kokuro survive. If the Kokuro had joined the “Labor Management Joint Statement” at that time, the Kokuro would surely have been disappeared when the JNR was transformed into the JR companies. The Doro, Tetsuro and Zenshiro decided in their respective union conventions that they disband themselves in order to create the “one union in one company system” at the time when the JNR would transform into JR companies. They established the Tetsudo-Roren (predecessor of today’s Japan Confederation of Railway Workers' Unions). Therefore, if the Kokuro had accepted the “Labor Management Joint Statement”, the Kokuro would inevitably be disbanded and the entire JNR labor movement would have been completely destroyed as intended by the enemy.\n\nWe figured that if the Kokuro should accept the “Labor Management Joint Statement” the Doro-Chiba would be the only opponent of the Division and Privatization. It would be very hard for the Doro-Chiba to stand on our ground all alone. Sensing the critical situation, we went to Shuzenji to encourage the Kokuro.\n\nMeanwhile, the management did everything to shake up and split the Kokuro. For example, they filed a suit against the Kokuro and the Doro for 20.2 billion yen damages allegedly caused by the strike for the right to strike in November 1975. In September 1986, the suit against the Doro was selectively dropped, leaving the Kokuro alone in the trial. The Kokuro was tremendously shocked by these measures.\n\nOn February 15, 1987, shortly before the inauguration of the JR companies (April 1), the notifications of the appointment to the JR jobs were issued. In Hokkaido and Kyushu, a large number of the JNR workers were rejected in employment. It is nothing but the “discrimination in hiring”. The discrimination against the Kokuro members who continued to oppose the Division and Privatization until the last moment raged especially in Hokkaido and Kyushu. On the other hand, in Honshu, the fixed personnel strength was not filled, because many workers had left job, being disgusted with the JNR.\n\n5. The Doro Kakumaru alone profited from the Division and Privatization.\n\nYou should not figure that the rank and file of the Doro or Tetsuro came off well, while the Kokuro workers were severely attacked. Also the union members of the Doro and Kokuro, especially the elderly workers were forced to leave the JNR. For example, in the Tabata Locomotive Depot, Matsuzaki’s home local, the Doro Kakumaru threatened their unionists in their 50s: “How dare you stay in your job in the JNR? Open a path for the young!” Thus, many Doro members were forced to leave the JNR. The members who refused to leave were harassed; water was poured into their lockers and so alike. In those days, the Doro-Chiba members who drove the train into Tabata found a lot of graffiti on walls of the rest room there: “Kill MATSUZAKI!” Most of those who accepted the transfer to the workplaces of the other public sector were the members of the Doro. For example, recently a NTT employee was arrested on the ground that he handed over the confidential data of the company to the Kakumaru. He was an ex-member of the Doro. Some went to the post offices. Actually a lot of members of Doro left the railways in the course of the development.\n\nIn fact, it was not that the Doro unionists were exempt of dismissal. Whether the Doro or Tetsuro, the elderly members among others were screened out in employment. The Kokuro workers have been consistently fighting against the discriminative employment. Regardless of which union they belong to, almost all JNR workers had to meet difficulty in the employment. The Kakumaru members alone, who had control of the Doro, profited from the Division and Privatization. It is evident that only the union bureaucracy took advantage of it.\n\nFinally on April 1, 1987, 7,628 workers were transferred to the Japan National Railways Settlement Corporation. Among them, there were also the workers over 55 years old and not all of them were the Kokuro members. Including them, the Kokuro had, at that time, 44,000 members, the Tessanro 28,000 and the Tetsudo-Roren around 90,000. Until April 1, 1987, the official date of the inauguration of the Division and Privatization, 200,000 workers had left the workplaces in five years. The Dismissed workers in this process were as follows: 28 of the Doro-Chiba who were dismissed under the Public Corporations and National Enterprises Labor Relations Law after the Doro-Chiba’s strike, and 1047 workers who were dismissed “for the purposes of the reorganization”. All of the rest of some 200,000 workers “voluntarily” retired. Because the Japanese employment system is the lifelong employment, the dismissal for no good reason is very difficult. In other words, if the workers were united, there were many ways to fight back.\n\nThe government enacted eight laws concerning the JNR Reform. The core of them, the Japan National Railways Reform Law, provides for in Article 23, “the employees of the new companies shall be appointed from among the employees of the Japan National Railways.” That is, the appointment of other workers who were not the employees of the JNR is prohibited. Therefore, if the JNR workers had been united and the Kokuro and the Doro had persistently resisted in a body, the Division and Privatization would not be possible. No worker coming from outside of the JNR can take over the job of the driver. And the law prohibits this. Moreover, the JNR’s employment system was the life long employment, and therefore, every worker is supposed “to stay in job until retirement” as is prescribed by the labor contract that he concludes at the entrance to the JNR. It contradicts the intention of the Division and Privatization.\n\nThe core of the point is here: there is a provision of the law that JR employees come from the JNR. While other two public corporations, namely the Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Public Corporation and the Japan Tobacco and Salt Corporation turned into private companies with their entire employees and facilities, the JNR alone screened out workers according to the decision of the Supervisory Committee for the JNR Reconstruction that determined the number of the employees of the new companies. No doubt the enemy forces intended to eradicate the union activists. Contrary to their expectation, however, a certain number of the activists remained in the JR companies in Honshu, because the fixed personnel strength was not filled there. In contrast, in Hokkaido and Kyushu, where redundancy of workforce occurred, a large scale firing took place.\n\nAll workers who were appointed by the JR companies filed once the notice of the resignation to the JNR on March 31, 1987, and then hired by the JR companies next day. The wages remained unchanged. The JR management could not go so far as to introduce the wage system equivalent to that of the private company. They cannot do everything. After all, every JNR worker filed the notice of the resignation excepting those who had been sent to the JNR Settlement Corporation that was the successor of the JNR.\n\nThe JNR thus started business. But, if the labor unions had fought with a definite policy in unity, the things would have apparently developed quite differently. However violent and extensive the enemy” attack may be, it can never be free from the weakness and the contradictions. When you hit the weakness and the contradictions, you'll have a lot of opportunities for counter-offensive.\n\nI found, on my tour throughout Japan that I made after the Division and Privatization had been forced, that the prefectural councils of labor unions in many prefectures, especially in Hokkaido and Kyushu, were prepared to fight an all-out battle against the Division and Privatization. The prefectural councils of labor unions, comprising both the Kokuro and the Doro as their members, still kept militant potential. I often heard that the Doro’s betrayal had hampered the united action in the prefectural level. Especially in Kyushu and Hokkaido, the prefectural councils were ready to fight against the Division and Privatization of the JNR.\n\n6. The Sohyo did nothing but the 50 Million Signature Campaign\n\nHow labor unions behaved toward the division and privatization?\n\nThe Sohyo eventually proposed no policy against the Division and Privatization than the 50 million signature-collecting campaign. The Secretary General of the Sohyo Magara, from the Jichiro (All Japan Prefectural and Municipal Workers’ Union), talked big, “we launch the greatest struggle since the Miike Struggle.” That was all. Though the signature campaign succeeded in collecting the largest number of signatures ever in the history of the Sohyo, no action was organized. The President of the Kokuro had promised me to do something “when the 50 million signature campaign has completed”, as I had met him in autumn 1985. At the close of the signature campaign in Mach 1986, the number of the signatures amounted to some 35 million. It was really a great success. Also the Doro-Chiba toured throughout Chiba Prefecture in order to collect signatures.\n\nAt that time, the Sohyo was already in a great confusion because of the conflict between the promoters and the opponents of the unification of the labor movement. Also in regard to the struggle against the Division and Privatization, the Japan Telecommunications Workers' Union, for example, raised an objection: “The Telephone and Telegraph was privatized. Why do the JNR workers alone oppose the Division and Privatization? We cannot collect such signature. If you oppose the division only, we will cooperate with you.”\n\nMeanwhile, the Doro went on betraying: it accepted the rationalization drive; it worked as tools of the Division and Privatization scheme. Then, some began to say within the Sohyo, “The Kokuro must follow the example of the Doro in some degree.” Thus divided in the policy, the Sohyo could do nothing. In face of a tremendous attack, the Division and Privatization of the JNR, which not only shook the backbone of the Sohyo, but also threatened the very existence of the Sohyo itself, it completely abandoned to fight back except the 50 million-signature campaign.\n\n7. The Kokuro on the total defensive\n\nThe Kokuro represented the labor movement under the leadership of the Mindo (social-democratic labor caucus) in “the 1955 System” in its every aspect. When the all-out repression of the state power fell on the Kokuro and its movement, its leadership consisted of the Mindo and the Kakudo (JCP-led faction) had no definite stand to confront the state power. The problem of the leadership is the core of the matter that has determined the whole development till today. As you know the Kokuro leadership of today has accepted the “Four Party Agreement”; it provably fancies that there would be some reliable and unlighted persons in the LDP and the government. The fact is far from it. Once determined to carry out a decisive battle, regardless of all circumstances, the state power by nature plunges into an unreserved attack, gathering all its powers.\n\nIt was really a serious situation. The Kokuro executive at that time pleaded in an open way: “It is not reasonable to fight when a storm is raging. We'd better hide ourselves in a trench till the storm is over”.\n\nIn the Kokuro all sort of left wing parties and organizations were represented: All of factions of the Socialist Party (the Mindo) including the Kyokai faction, the Japan Communist Party (the Kakudo), new left organizations, the Maoist, and so on. Each of them, with their influence over the districts, locals, sections, branches or the youth sections of the unions, had been fighting in their own ways and the Kokuro as a whole had thus possessed substantial fighting potentials. The drive for the Division and Privatization, however, smashed almost all of them, for those political groups shared the stand of “avoiding the storm in a trench”. They were scared of the all-out attack of the state power.\n\n8. Doro exploited “opportunity” to demolish the Kokuro\n\nWhat did the Doro? In 1981, the Doro adopted a policy to form a united front with the labor unions under the control of the Japan Communist Party (JCP) and held a self-proclaimed “anti-Fascist Rally”. The Doro once invited the then Secretary General of JCP, KANEKO Mitsuhiro who had been from the Kokuro Takasaki Locomotive Section, as guest speaker to the Doro’s meeting. This honeymoon of the Kakumaru of Doro and the JCP lasted only a half-year. After this attempt, MATSUZAKI has come to the determination that the Doro should survive through engaging itself in disrupting the Kokuro.\n\nHe began by starting the campaign in January 1982 according to the Doro’s statement, “The Doro’s Opinion on the JNR Issue” that proposed: “Let’s work hard to improve our working efficiency because the low efficiency is said to cause the deficit.” At that time we criticized this policy calling it “Let’s-Work-Hard Campaign.” In the workshops of the JNR, the job demarcation used to be very strict and distinct. For example, there were clear differences in the work assignment between the driving, the inspecting and repairing, and the train marshalling and so on. The Doro was the first union to start a campaign of promoting the multi-assignment; the drivers must take on also the inspection and repair job. The Doro’s paper praised this practice “wonderful”.\n\nIn March 1982, four unions - the Kokuro, Doro, Tetsuro and Zenshiro - established the “Joint Struggle Conference on the JNR Reconstruction Issue.” This conference, however, soon went bankrupt in several months because the Doro very often maneuvered behind the scene together with the JNR management.\n\nIn February 1983, the Doro issued a document entitled “Our Organizational Tasks in 1983,” which maliciously and systematically attacked the Kokuro. Backed by this argument, the Doro set forth from that time on an organizational campaign to destroy the Kokuro, claiming that it was the necessary measure for the Doro to survive.\n\nTo justify this policy, the Kakumaru put forward the theory of the “era of winter” and that of the “death of the Sohyo’s labor movement.” The former meant: “As we are now in the midst of the winter of the Japanese labor movement, we should not fight. It is not proper for the professionals of the labor movement to fight now. Our work isn’t a business of the amateurs”. According to their theory, spring will never come; it will be winter forever. The latter, the theory of “death of the Sohyo’s labor movement” implied: “because the Sohyo’s historical task was over, its survival is meaningless.”\n\nThe Kakumaru of the Doro sensed that an excellent opportunity had come to destroy the Kokuro and thus to seize a position of the mainstream of the national railway workers’ movement.\n\nTo counter the enemy’s attack, the labor unions have no other way than to trust the fighting potentials of the workers and to rely on the solidarity of the workers. The Kakumaru of the Doro scornfully look down upon the workers. They don’t think the solidarity of the workers has a significant power. They regard the workers as the “ignorant masses”. So they never dreamt of mobilizing the Doro’s unionists to fight back the offensive of the Division and Privatization of the JNR. The Kakumaru of the Doro and the Mindo of the Kokuro share the view that they would be after all beaten down when the state power delivers an all-out attack on them.\n\nIn 1957, on the occasion of the Niigata struggle of the national railway workers, the President Aida of the Kokuro District Niigata made a moving speech for support in the national convention of the Sohyo response the Chair Ota of the Sohyo delivered a notorious speech: “The best policy is to run away.” Aida walked out in anger. This has long been a prevailing mind-set of the labor movement of Japan. The Kakumaru makes no exception.\n\nIV. Two Strikes of the Doro-Chiba\n\nAfter the replacement of the President of the JNR Nisugi by Sugiura in June 1985, each office of the Railway Administrative Bureau was occupied by the new chief director that was the advocate of the Division and Privatization. The chief of the Chiba Railway Administrative Bureau was taken over by KUSAKI, later executive board member of JR West.\n\nOn July 26, the Supervisory Committee for the JNR Restructuring announced its final report, the “Opinions on the JNR Reform,” recommending the division of the JNR into seven companies. The government decided to “respect the opinions to the fullest extent” at the Cabinet meeting.\n\nSince 1982 a drive for the Division and Privatization of the JNR had been feverishly carried out. Anti-labor campaign had been organized against the governmental and public workers for their allowances and benefits that were obtained in an allegedly illegal way. It was reputed in those days: “No news paper appeared without carrying articles on the JNR”.\n\nDuring three years from 1982 to 1985, the work force of the JNR was downsized: some 120,000 personnel were dismissed. 400,000 JNR employees at the beginning of 1982 were reduced to 280,000 at the end of 1985. From 1983 onward, the JNR froze the recruitment to fill the vacant positions, pushed ahead with the rationalization in full swing, brought forth considerable number of “surplus personnel” and forced the drivers to take upon other duties, for example, to take care of the passengers in stations and so on. Under those circumstances, even the Doro-Chiba dared not adopt a policy to oppose the Division and Privatization of the JNR with strike.\n\n1. The background of the decision to launch strikes\n\nAs a union leader, I fully realized that the Division and Privatization of the JNR was an all-out attack through the general mobilization of the enemy forces headed by the government, including whole capitalists, the mass media and so on. Therefore, I had no illusion that the storm might pass over while we kept low profile. I keenly sensed that the attack was aiming at smashing the national railway workers’ movement to the ground.\n\nWhen we look upon ourselves, the Doro-Chiba at that time with only 1100 members was a very tiny force in the national railway workers' movement. I thought over and over again how we could win a battle against the state power and survive. Further, I wondered what would happen to us even if we fought out the struggle: how we could sustain ourselves organizationally as well as financially in face of the violent political repression. There seemed to be nothing favorable to the unions. Among others, the most terrible event for the labor unions was that the Doro, which for a certain period had an awe-inspiring appellation “Doro the Demon” for its militancy, has converted into a tool of the enemy. In those developments, the Sohyo as a whole began losing its militant potentials.\n\nTo tell the truth, for three years after the beginning of the drive for the Division and Privatization the same ideas went back and forth in my mind.\n\nNo one in the leadership of the Doro-Chiba was ready to discuss over the issue with me. Our officials and members all entrusted me to think over the issue. After examining the situation and considering over the problem for a long time, I finally arrived at a conclusion in the first half of the year 1985 that “there is no way for the Doro-Chiba but to trust the union members and to strengthen our solidarity through fighting.” “Now that we launch a war, we must fight through and through”. In searching for the conclusion I followed a proverb that “You should return to the principle when you are in difficulty”. I felt like fighting desperately our way in the midst of a death struggle.\n\nMeanwhile, chatting with our members, I got gradually a feeling that our members were after all reliable. I found that they were not quite intimidated; they were rather furious. Certainly the Doro-Chiba’s experience of the struggles had made what they were. In 1979, we fought against the Doro executive and broke away from it. In March 1981, we struck throughout the whole area of Chiba. Soon after that, the offensive of the Division and Privatization started. It made them angry instead of intimidated. I was strongly encouraged by them. I firmly made up my mind to share their fate. They convinced me: “My fellow unionists will no doubt follow me when I lead the struggle at its forefront at the risk of my life”. It led me to the determination to rise up for a decisive battle.\n\nThen a proverb came across my mind: “The Fish rots from the head down.” A leadership is in the best position to get much information and to grasp the general situation, including the moves of the government and the management. Owing to this, the leadership is apt to yield to the pressure. From the previous experience, the leader can figure out more accurately than the rank and file workers what sort of retaliation is waiting after a certain struggle. Thus, the leadership is often the first to be intimidated. Frankly speaking, I had experienced it myself many times; I was often tempted to be pessimistic and to complain. I resisted the temptation and concluded that we could not maintain our unity without fighting a battle.\n\nWhy do we fight? What is the labor unity? It is not only the problem of the workplace but also that of the family life. Many families of the Doro-Chiba’s unionists know each other. When the union leadership allows the dismissal of the union members, it would inevitably give the damage to their families and their companionship and bring disunity to the whole union organization. Therefore I made up my mind to avoid such situation. The unity of the labor union implies to me the unity of the whole family members.\n\nThere is another important problem: it concerns the drivers. The overwhelming majority of our members are drivers. Day and night they drive the trains, taking charge of the passengers’ lives. For five years from the setting-up of the Second Ad Hoc Commission for Administrative Reform, the drivers were put into an uneasy situation. As the Division and Privatization approached, their anxiety increased. I was afraid that it would become a grave situation if a railway accident should happen. The management was totally engaged in stirring up unrest in the floor to disrupt workers’ unity. Under those circumstances, I thought it necessary to make a condition that would guarantee the drivers to accomplish their duty. I resolved to establish a definite policy to fight it out.\n\nIn July, when I first met the new Chief Director KUSAKI of the JNR Chiba Bureau and explained our policy, he said to me “then, you are like a moth flying into the flame.” I rebuked: “Don’t talk like that. Don’t you know the sentiment of 7000 or 8000 workers under the Chiba Railway Administrative Bureau? They are driving the trains all day long in charge of the human lives and they are all the time faced with anxiety. Your essential job as a chief director should not be carrying out the Division and Privatization of the JNR but thinking through how to prevent grave railway accidents. But you have not taken a least measure for rail safety, while calling me “a moth flying into the flame”. As long as you keep your position like that, we have no choice but to fight our own battle till the end.”\n\nThe severe offensive of the enemy forced us to choose between giving up and fighting back: an alternative between the way of surrendering to the enemy and becoming its tool like the Kakumaru of Doro for survival and the way to fight for the defense of the union’s unity. The executive of the Kokuro, however, did not realize the severe nature of the enemy’s offensive at all. They cherished an illusion that there could be a third way, that is, neither the way of the total surrender nor the way of the resolute struggle. Therefore, the Kokuro remained inactive and powerless till the end, inevitably falling into misery. .\n\n2. The Annual Convention of May 1985\n\nOn May 9-10, 1985, we held the 10th annual convention of the Doro-Chiba. The executive committee declared for the first time the policy to fight against the Division and Privatization scheme with the strikes. Our slogans were: (1) we oppose the Division and Privatization of the JNR; (2) we oppose the rationalization that would make the JNR another Japan Airlines (a Jumbo Jet of Japan Airlines had crashed shortly before the convention); and (4) we smash the unprecedented union basting in the JNR. We decided to launch a strike at the end of November under these slogans.\n\nExpiration of the Employment Stabilization Contract\n\nWhy at the end of November? First, the Employment Stabilization Contract was to expire on November 30. By the summer of 1985, it became almost certain that the management would not extend the Employment Stabilization Contract with the three unions - the Doro-Chiba, Kokuro and Zendoro - on November 30. For the first time in the history of the JNR, the management would not enter into the labor contract with the dominant union, the Kokuro, while entering into it with only minority unions. Considering those developments, we planned the strike, demanding the entering into the Employment Stabilization Contract.\n\nSecond, in July, the final report of the Supervisory Committee for the JNR Restructuring announced an outline of the Division and Privatization of the JNR in which the total workforce of the new companies, the issue of the greatest concern, was estimated to be around 200,000. In October, the management of the JNR said in its report, the Views on the Personnel in the Years to Come , that workforce on the day of the inauguration of the new companies, April 1, 1987, would be 195,300. It meant that around 100,000 workers would not be able to go to the new companies - firing of one out of three workers.\n\nIn the preparation for the annual convention, I thoroughly analyzed the report of the Supervisory Committee for the JNR Restructuring in detail and considered the consequences of the Division and Privatization. Life, livelihood of each and every one of our members was at stake.\n\n“Only struggle defends unity”\n\nIn the opening address of the president, I spoke for more than one hour. “Some members might remain in the new companies, some might be screened out. But, it would be “a hell for the fired and another hell for the remaining” Even when you are employed in the privatized companies, you will certainly face a fierce rationalization and an intense speed-up. I can’t tell you what will happen to the wages.” I described the implications of the Division and Privatization on our lives and working conditions in real terms with various concrete examples.\n\nI passionately called for a struggle: “If we do not fight against the mass dismissal of “one out of three workers”, our union’s unity will surely be destroyed. If some of you give in to the management and stay in the job in sacrifice of your fellow workers, the workplace will be divided and suspicion will spread among you. The workshop solidarity will be disrupted. We don’t accept this. Without fighting, we can not defend our solidarity.”\n\nFurther I argued with anger against the anti labor campaign on the governmental and public workers (for their allowances and benefits that were allegedly obtained in an illegal way) and the demagogy labeling the JNR’s employees as the “national traitor”. At that time, it was repeatedly propagandized that the enormous deficit of the JNR was the result of the laziness of its workers. I bitterly rebuked it.\n\nAt that time, the final deficit of the JNR amounted to 37 trillion yen. The construction expenditures of the Seikan Tunnel, which was planned to be completed by 1987, and the Honshi Bridges were added to the JNR deficit. The huge sum of the deficit had been accumulated since the start of unfettered investment drive of the JNR under the “Plan to Remodel the Japanese Archipelago” of TANAKA Kakuei (in 1973). Thus, the main cause of the deficit was evidently the politics of the LDP. It was widely rumored that the construction of a new Shinkansen Line would secure the politician concerned his seat in the parliament.\n\nFor all that, Japan was flooded with the propaganda that the workers and labor unions were responsible for the deficit. The union members, especially those of the Doro-Chiba that are mostly drivers, were furious at it. As you know, the drivers, once in the driver’s seat, are put under the lasting tension. Their shifts are irregular; they operate the trains while other people sleep, or are on public holidays, on New Year’s Day, etc. “Are we really ruining the JNR? Are we lazy on duty? Stop kidding! It’s enough. We can no longer remain silent”, were their voices. So, I strongly insisted on fighting back the propaganda that the labor unions of the national railway and their members were responsible for all of evil”. I further demanded to bring it to the public discussion in order to clarify the real intention and nature of the Division and Privatization of the JNR and to verify who was really responsible for the deficit of the JNR.\n\nI urged then the union members to rise up for the struggle to smash the scheme of the Division and Privatization, “When we, the Doro-Chiba, stand up for fight, the Kokuro will never fail to launch the struggle. Then there will be a huge general strike of the whole national railway workers”. Certainly no one believed that the Doro-Chiba, 1000-strong union, alone could stop this attack by the strike only in Chiba. But I was convinced and insisted that we could no doubt motivate a nation-wide rising of the national railway workers.\n\nAfterwards, however, some members said to me: “President, in spite of your expectation, the Kokuro hasn’t rise up after all.” I responded: “Look at the Shuzenji Convention! The Kokuro defended their banner opposing the Division and Privatization. If the Doro-Chiba had not fought our battle, the Kokuro would have given in to the Labor Management Joint Statement”\n\n“They call us villains. They fire us - one out of three. How could we remain inactive? Strike, strike, and strike! Let’s rise up for a determined struggle. Let’s ask the whole society by means of the workers’ strike who is right.” This address exactly fitted the anger and state of the consciousness of the union members.\n\nUnanimous resolution of strike policy\n\nThe Convention was carried out in an extraordinary enthusiasm. The opening address of the president brought the whole participants rapidly into an unprecedented excitement. The delegates spoke one after another overwhelmingly for strike. “I'm moved by the executive’s resolute decision.” “It’s high time to fight it out!” and so on. The resolution of strike was unanimously passed the convention.\n\nAt that moment, I sensed that union members had long been waiting for a call to the battle at the bottom of their heart. While worrying over various problems, they had been expecting the union to propose a policy to fight back. They realized that the union would be finished when it did not fight in such an ultimate situation.\n\nNo one spoke against the strike in the convention and in the following local general meetings as well. Since all members knew that scores of members would be fired for the strike, they were seriously concerned about how they support and feed the dismissed fellow members and were anxious if the union could be financially sustainable. I answered: “We don’t have a definite answer now. We shall find a solution through fighting. Our all-out struggle would never fail to get the support of all working people round the country. They will supply us with various ways of livelihood.\n\nBecause our members had experienced various struggles until then, they were keenly aware of the serious character of the present all-out attack of the state power. They had a full understanding of the gravity of the decision of the policy in that convention. This made the convention all the more enthusiastic.\n\nThe unionists who chaired or spoke in the union convention were later subjected to the disciplinary measures; the state power found their names in the “Daily Doro-Chiba” that reported the union convention. The chair of the convention, the president of the Local Choshi, was dismissed under the Public Corporations and National Enterprises Labor Relations Law. The delegates who spoke in the convention were suspended in job longer than others.\n\nMeanwhile, many JNR workers committed suicide throughout Japan. There was no suicide in the Doro-Chiba. Workers do not kill themselves in a fighting union. The JNR workers who committed suicide had been torn between the management and the fellow workers. The enemy forces warned them that they would not be allowed in the new companies when they don’t disaffiliate from the Kokuro. On the other hand, they were afraid of disrupting the solidarity with their fellow unionists. I think that the essential problem was the leadership’s inability to set up a policy to fight back.\n\nAll local president declared to fight in the local meetings\n\nAfter the convention had decided to launch the strike in late November, we convened local general meetings throughout Chiba within two month. Because the local presidents had to anticipate the dismissal in the case of the strike, it was only natural for any of them to offer his resignation. None of the local presidents, however, stepped down. All except one remained in their post. The exception was the local Narita, which according to the previous plan only replaced the president. All local presidents, remaining in their post, showed their resolution to fight. I once again confirmed my conviction: “We can surely go into the battle and we shall win.”\n\nThe rank and file workers found their union leaders standing in the forefront of the decisive battle, united and without drop-offs. It encouraged them all to fight out the strike, for they knew very well that all of the union leaders risked their jobs in the intense situation.\n\nCommunity meetings together with the family members\n\nA unanimous resolution in the general convention doesn’t automatically lead to a struggle. The members had their families full of anxiety. We decided to have community meetings with the participation of family members. I asked the union locals to gather their members together with their families. The workers of the local labor councils were also invited. I went to all of the community meetings and spoke to the participants. Many families came up to the meetings - in Chiba, Sakura, Narita, Choshi, Kisarazu, Tateyama, Katsuura, Tsudanuma and Shinkoiwa. About 300 workers and their families took part in the meeting of the smallest locals, Tateyama and Katsuura. When the wives were not able to come, the mothers represented the meetings. An old mother expressed her anxiety about the job of her son-in-law who she had thought to be in “a soundest business, the JNR.” “My daughter is at work today; I'm here instead. I'm looking for your best effort, Mr. President” she greeted me.\n\nI made there the most impressive speech in my life from the bottom of my heart. I went further than the opening address of the union’s convention and demanded all union officers, especially the chiefs of the locals to be prepared to the dismissal. I plainly stated that it was a struggle that would bring about a severe political repression and a considerable number of dismissal. I emphasized that we couldn’t win the battle without such a determination. A certain chief of a local remarked, “You needn’t tell us such a severe story in the presence of our wives. Don’t worry. I've already made up my mind.”\n\nI assured them that we could find a way if we only maintain our unity. “The core of the Division and Privatization scheme is the disruption of the unity of the union. Let’s fight for the defense of our unity! Workers should never betray their fellow workers. When the union stops to fight, it will end in a betrayal”.\n\nWhile I was speaking, our fellow unionists and their families intensely concentrated their attention on my speech in a complete silence. While the workers who came to support us enthusiastically applauded now and then, the union members as well as their families would not utter a word, and were staring my face without stirring an inch. It was because everyone was risking life, livelihood of his or her entire family. The meetings were all in the utmost seriousness and tension.\n\nAfter meetings, it happened very often old mothers thanked me at the exit, “Mr. President, you have given me an excellent speech today. I well understand what you mean”. As you know, in the deeper countryside, there were many communities where every neighboring family had a JNR employee. They were naturally associated with each other as family, went out on a pleasure trip together and so on. So, when I told them that workers should not betray fellow workers, I was surely understood by them.\n\nIn launching the strike, almost all of our members had been prepared to face dismissal. Without such determination, the struggle would be impossible. Against the background of the mounting anti-labor campaign, especially criminalization propaganda of the national railway workers, it might have seemed almost unimaginable to wage a strike against the Division and Privatization of the JNR. The situation was really terrible. For the national railway workers, however, it was unbearable to be made responsible for the deficit of the JNR, while they were working on the railway day and night. They were totally furious and ready to rise up at any moment. The problem was how to ignite their fighting potentials.\n\nIn those circumstances we promptly set up organizational preparations for the battle and dashed into the strike in November.\n\n3.The first strike\n\nThe 24-hours’ strike on Nov. 28, 1985\n\nOn November 27, the National Workers’ Rally took place sponsored by the Doro-Chiba. I announced in this rally: “We launch a 24 hours' strike from the first train on November 29.” The strike posts were the Tsudanuma and Chiba Driver’s Depot; the slow trains and the rapid trains of the Sobu line were to be stopped.\n\nOn Nov. 27, immediately before the planed date of the strike, however, in the executive committee meeting in the afternoon, we decided to launch the strike at noon on Nov. 28, 12 hours earlier than the schedule. It was to protest the management’s measures to crush the strike. The police deployed 10,000-strong riot squad along the Sobu Line and fenced around the Tsudanuma Train Depot under the pretext of taking a counter-guerrilla measure. The Doro-Kakumaru and the Kokuro executive cooperated with the management’s scab mobilization.\n\nAt this day, 3000 strong riot police surrounded the large ground of Tsudanuma Train Depot that operated hundred of trains. It was closely besieged. The Chiba Driver’s Depot, which was not so large as the Tsudanuma because it was the train crews’ workplace, was also surrounded by the riot police. We launched the strike in the tumultuous atmosphere.\n\nThe ordinary workers might be intimidated. But the Doro-Chiba workers with their experiences of the Sanrizuka struggle and many other struggles did not shrink away before the police in the heavy riot gears. Our union could carry out the battle because each member was prepared to fight at the risk of his job. Only through such fight we could all survive and maintain our unity.\n\nThe riot police blocked the Tsudanuma Train Depot and shut out the unionists from the premises. In the premises, the supervisors and the foremen from all over Japan were mobilized by the management. Those personnel outnumbered our union members. The striking workers, less than 200 in number, were besieged for 24 hours. They stayed there without going back home. In the cold open air of November, they continued their vigil huddling around the fire in the metal barrels. They formed ranks with helmet, demonstrated in the premises zigzagging, repeatedly rushed to the riot police and kicked the shields of the police in protest. The management warned them not to provoke the police. But they fought without any hesitation. The majority of the local Tsudanuma were young unionists in their 20s; they were full of power.\n\nI received incessant telephone calls from the union officers dispatched to the spot of the battle for giving direction to the union members: “Their anger is flaming up. Their fighting spirit is soaring. They are dashing into bitter confrontation with the state power. They are beyond my control. If things develop in this way, the riot police would rush into the depot at any time. Only you, the president, can stop it”. I answered: “Don’t mind. In a severe situation like this, it would be only natural to be scared. On the contrary, they have high spirit and are fighting a serious battle. They are great. They are all risking their jobs. Police can’t easily attack them. You need not worry. We have already won the battle”. The telephone call did not end. It continued till midnight: “I am still at a loss what to do. Tell me how to persuade them”\n\nIn such a tense situation, usually quiet person very often turns to clash with the management resolutely. Everybody soon realizes that the situation drives him (or her) to a brave action. It inspires the fellow workers and gathers their respect. The upsurge of the mass struggle brings about many touching scenes like this. This was what happened with us.\n\nThe Chiba Driver’s Depot was in the office complex of the JNR Chiba Branch. In and out side of the office complex, the striking workers held rallies and made demonstrations. The riot police surrounded the whole site. Within the Depot there were also the drivers belonging to the Kokuro, whom our members demanded to clarify their stand on our strike: “Surely you won’t be scabs? I guess you are also against the Division and Privatization” Eventually, the president and other officials of Kokuro Chiba Driver’s Depot’s Local resigned under the pressure of the circumstances.\n\nThe Kokuro Tsudanuma Branch rose up with us\n\nThe unionists of the Doro-Chiba were deeply interested in what the Kokuro would do since the half of the drivers of the Sobu Line was the Kokuro members.\n\nThe Doro took on the role of the scab without hesitation according to their union’s position as the advocate for the scheme of the Division and Privatization of the JNR. The Kokuro executive too decided to join in scabbing with the following justification: “We are obliged to obey the instruction on duty in these hard times” They were eager to conclude the Employment Stabilization Contract. The Kokuro Executive issued an order to its members to run the train following the revised operation schedule of scab. Formerly the Kokuro used to stop the train when the Doro-Chiba waged strike and the Doro-Chiba used to do the same in case of the Kokuro’s strike.\n\nThe unionists of the Kokuro of the Tsudanuma Branch revolted against this decision. The drivers of the Kokuro who had been forced to run the scab train on November 28, the first day of the strike, protested the Kokuro branch officers in anger after the duty: “Why do you force us to scab? The Kokuro should fight together with the striking Doro-Chiba”. Two of the drivers tore off their union badge and walked out of the Kokuro’s branch office and came into the Doro-Chiba’s office to join us on that day. In the Tsudanuma Train Depot, the Kokuro’s office lay next-door to ours.\n\nThereupon, the Kokuro executive sent an executive committee member into Chiba to settle the matter. But the union members of District Chiba of the Kokuro argued with him over the union’s policy of scabbing and finally at one o'clock at night made him pledge: “We don’t follow the instruction on duty of the management to scab”. The Kokuro executive committee member, pale with fear, went to the management office to announce this. This news made us shout: “We've got it. The whole SOBU line will stop!” The best part of the Kokuro’s unionists responded to the struggle of the Doro-Chiba.\n\nThe retaliation to the strike: disciplinary measures and transfer of jobs\n\nThe first wave of the strikes gave a tremendous shock on the whole society. Especially many national railway workers were undoubtedly impressed. Immediately after the strike, a member of the Doro wrote to us: “The Doro-Chiba’s strike is amazing. We'd like to fight with you.” As the strike was the first manifestation of the national railway workers’ opposition against the Division and Privatization of the JNR, it got a lot of the press coverage.\n\nOn the other hand, the same day of the Doro-Chiba’s strike saw a guerrilla attack against the Asakusabashi Station in Tokyo, which aroused a heated argument in the whole society. The President Sugita of the JNR issued a statement: “We impose severe disciplinary measures on the strike which incited the guerrilla attack.” Surprisingly, the President Yamazaki of the Kokuro and the President Matsuzaki of the Doro issued a joint statement condemning the strike. At the beginning of December, the Mainichi Newspaper made the front page that read “All Strikers of the Doro-Chiba to be dismissed, leaders and rank and files as well”\n\nAll these illustrated how serious was the blow the strike gave to the enemy forces. Until then the management apparently anticipated no difficulty in pushing forward the Division and Privatization plan: The Doro had already become the management’s tool. The Kokuro had suffered many dropouts without fighting. All of a sudden, an unexpected blow was delivered by the Doro-Chiba’s strike. We can easily imagine how they hated us. I thought to myself that we had won.\n\nOn January 28, 1986, the JNR management announced unprecedented massive disciplinary measures in retaliation for the strike. The strike hit only the Sobu Line and stopped 243 trains in the first wave. For this, 20 workers were dismissed, 28 suspended in job, 65 got pay cut, 6 warning - in all 120 workers were punished. For comparison, after the eight-day strike for the right to strike in 1975, which stopped 1,500,000 trains, 15 workers of the Kokuro and the Doro were dismissed. You can see how brutal the measures against the Doro-Chiba were.\n\nMany of the executives of the Doro-Chiba had already been dismissed for the struggle against the transportation of the jet fuel. At that time, all of the rest of the executives were dismissed. In the Chiba Driver’s Depot and the Tsudanuma Trains Depot, which were struck in the first wave of the struggle, all presidents, vice-presidents and secretary generals of the locals and almost all of the executives were dismissed. The local Narita did not struck in its home workplace, but its drivers struck when they drove into Tokyo; its chief was dismissed.\n\nAnother retaliation was the transfer of the jobs. In January, the management noticed that the jobs for 7000 km drive of the Sobu Line, the slow trains and the rapid trains, and the Abiko Line would be transferred to the three Railway Administrative Bureaus in Tokyo. This plan was going to be materialized by the annual timetable revision of March. The management tried to abolish the jobs in Chiba and bring about “surplus workforce” to be transferred or dismissed. Its aim was to disrupt the union organization of the Doro-Chiba. Our members got angry at this attack.\n\nWe immediately launched a counterattack against the job transfer. We stood up to stop the rail track trainings that the management began from February 5 to prepare for the job transfer. For the rail track training, the drivers were sent from Tokyo to Chiba, to the electric train depots of Makuhari and Tsudanuma. We showed them our opposition to the job transfer, placards in our hands in the station building. The platform was filled with dozens of our union members and the management staffs. The management made desperate efforts to defend their drivers from our protest. Some of the drivers sent from Tokyo began to speak out openly that they were disgusted with forced rail track training. Eventually the Kokuro Tamachi Train Depot Local delivered a statement to the Kokuro Tokyo District and the Shinbashi Branch: “The Tamachi Train Depot Local does not accept the job transfer for the destruction of the struggle of the Chiba workers”\n\n4.The second strike\n\nThe second wave of the strike and the renewed retaliation\n\nThe year 1986 saw the strengthened reactionary offensives of the state power and the JNR management. They launched an all-out attack on the national railway workers’ struggle to destroy it completely. A full-scale measure of rationalization was taken to reduce the JNR workers to 200,000 until the deadline of April 1, 1987, the date of the planned start of the new JR companies. We had sensed beforehand a fresh confrontation with the management and the state power in the year 1986 and dared to launch the first wave of the strike of 1985 and the second wave of the strike of 1986.\n\nOn February 15, we started 24 hours’ strike - the second wave of our strikes. At that time, we added two new slogans to the previous four slogans of the first wave of the strike: “Withdraw the Unjust Mass Dismissals!” and “No Job Transfer!” We fought strikes in the Chiba Driver’s Depot, Tsudanuma Train Depot and Narita Driver’s Depot. From the tactical point of view, we called on the strike in the “Chiba Station area”. In practice, all the drivers, driving the train to the Chiba station from Tateyama, Katsuura, Choshi etc., which were not included in the striking area, got off the train there to join the strike instead of driving the train back to Tateyama, Katsuura, Choshi etc., because the “Chiba Station area” was included in the striking zone. Thus every train that drove into the Chiba station stopped one after another.\n\nAs a result, the Chiba Railways Administration Bureau had to cancel all the train operation under its jurisdiction..\n\nOn March 14, disciplinary measures on the second wave of the strike were announced: eight members were dismissed, 31 suspended, 233 pay cuts, 272 in total. All chiefs of the locals that had struck were dismissed.\n\nFurther, on March 14, the JNR management filed a suit for 36 million yen damages over the first wave of the strike. They claimed the whole amount of money paid for their countermeasures against the Doro-Chiba’s strike: the travel bills and the night work premiums of the foremen who had been mobilized from Hokkaido and West Japan area, the refunds of the express trains for the passengers, the rental fees of the buses for the substitute transport and so on. The JNR has filed during its lifetime only two damages suits against the unions: 20.2 billion yen damages over the strike for the right to strike in 1975 and 36 million damages over the Doro-Chiba’s first wave of the strike in 1986.\n\nIn March 1986, the management put forward the first wide area transfer. It planned to transfer workers of the Doro from Hokkaido and Kyushu to Honshu, and to make the Kokuro and the Doro-Chiba members in Honshu “surplus workforce”. It was called “to fill in new blood in place of old”. Actually there was no transfer of the Doro members to Chiba. Certainly the Doro members were too afraid to come to Chiba, because the executive of the Doro had demonized the Doro-Chiba. When ordered to transfer, all Doro members refused to go to Chiba and preferred Tokyo.\n\nAfter the two waves of the strike, we repeatedly developed the work-to-rule struggles and the non-cooperation struggles. We focused the problem on the issue of the abolishment of the Narita Driver’s Depot. On the occasion of the timetable revision of March 1986, the Narita Driver’s Depot was transformed into the Narita Branch of the Chiba Driver’s Depot and was finally abolished in November the same year as a result of the timetable revision. From the viewpoint of the transport efficiency, however, this abolition was very ineffective because Narita was the key location of the railway. The true aim of the abolition was to crush the bastion of the Doro-Chiba: all workers of the Narita Driver’s Depot belonged to the Doro-Chiba and they played a central role in the struggle against jet fuel transportation to the Narita Airport. By the abolition of the Narita Driver’s Depot, all those union members were scattered to various workplaces. Against this assault, we strenuously launched the work-to-rule struggles, the non-cooperation struggles and the railway safely struggles.\n\nStruggle to defend livelihood of 28 dismissed members\n\nThe dismissal of 28 workers was certainly an unprecedented full-scale assault on a union in the post-war Japanese labor movement. Thus the Doro-Chiba, 1,100 strong union at that time, came to embrace 34 dismissed members altogether, including the prior dismissal.\n\nIn face of the fierce attack, it was an urgent task for the unity of the union to rally the dismissed workers around the union and go on fighting together with them at the forefront of our union. We did everything for this purpose.\n\nThe dismissed workers had various levels of experience in the union activities; some were not leading activists and some had never undergone any disciplinary measure before the dismissal under the Public Corporations and National Enterprises Labor Relations Law.\n\nTherefore, there was a great difference in the state of mind among the dismissed workers. Some officials and activists were firmly determined for the dismissal with the support of the family; some members got serious difficulties with their families. Any way, each member suffered much. We organized many meetings to talk with the families of the dismissed workers: “We promise you to support your livings. Please believe us and let’s fight it out together with us.” Some families bitterly told me off: “Give me back my husbands’ job! You are to blame for the reckless strike, Mr. President!\n\nMany union members resolutely and patiently persuaded their families: “I have done right things according to my belief as a national railway worker. I've full confidence in my deed. Don’t worry!” And they have since been continuing their union activities more vigorously as ever. In another case, the wife of a dismissed worker reproached her husband: “You obeyed the president of your union and you are fired!” Then the husband answered: “Just listen! You know, I'm well over 40 years old and I have decided myself to fight. As a result I was sacked in my own. Am I wrong? If you don’t understand my cause, you can divorce me” She was persuaded. Then, he and she have been fighting hand in hand. Each of the dismissed workers has undergone the similar experiences and kept on fighting.\n\nAfter all it was imperative to maintain the livelihood of the 28 dismissed unionists. We started various projects: sales of union goods, foundation of business companies, taking part-time jobs and so on.\n\nFour of the 28 members were the executives of the headquarters of the Doro-Chiba, and all the rest were the executive of the locals. Since the locals could not afford the full-time officials, we gave all of them the posts of Doro-Chiba officials. This brought out a contrast to the Kokuro’s attitude toward its dismissed members (“Tosodan”). The problem was the enormous personnel expenditures. We barely overcame our difficulties, using our entire union assets for the personnel expenditures. The union as an employer of the union officers has had to pay half of the premiums for the health insurance, the employment insurance and the pensions. We paid tens of million yen annually for the social insurances. Our personnel expenditures far exceeded 100 million yen. You can see for example 28 times 5 million yen makes 140 million yen.\n\nI met and talked with each dismissed member individually and asked them to choose their way: to become a full-time official of the Doro-Chiba headquarters and to engage in the sales of union goods, or to work outside the Doro-Chiba. Many chose to work outside and a very few chose the job of the "
