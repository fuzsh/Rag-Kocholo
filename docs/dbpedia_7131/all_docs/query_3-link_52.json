        "text": "The Kyushu Rail Pass by JR Kyushu is a rail pass for exclusive use by foreign visitors to Japan, providing unlimited travel on JR trains on the island of Kyushu (except the Sanyo Shinkansen) for two, three, five or seven consecutive days.\n\nPurchase the Kyushu Rail Pass\n\nKyushu Rail Pass All Kyushu 3 days 20,000 yen 5 days 22,500 yen 7 days 25,000 yen Northern Kyushu 3 days 12,000 yen 5 days 15,000 yen Southern Kyushu 3 days 10,000 yen Reduced rates (50% off) apply to children aged 6-11.\n\nBelow are maps of the train lines, which can be used with the JR Kyushu Rail Pass:\n\nValidity\n\nUnlimited use of JR Kyushu trains on Kyushu, including all trains along the Kyushu Shinkansen (Fukuoka-Kagoshima), Nishikyushu Shinkansen and limited express trains, but excluding the Sanyo Shinkansen (Fukuoka-Osaka, operated by JR West). The Northern Kyushu version of the pass is not valid south of Oita and Misumi, while the Southern Kyushu version is not valid north of Kumamoto and Oita.\n\nSeat reservations can be made for free. There is an upper limit of six free seat reservations for the Northern and Southern Kyushu passes, but there is no limit for the All Kyushu Pass. Seat reservations can also be made via an online reservation for 1000-1500 yen.\n\nThe pass is valid on consecutive days. The validity is based on calendar days (midnight to midnight) as opposed to 24-hour periods.\n\nOnly foreign temporary visitors to Japan can use the Kyushu Rail Pass. It cannot be used by residents of Japan.\n\nThe pass can be used only by a single person. It cannot be transferred between multiple persons. The pass holder has to carry his/her passport at all times.\n\nPoints of sale\n\nThe Kyushu Rail Pass can be purchased through various websites on the internet, through travel agencies outside of Japan and at a few major JR railway stations and travel agencies in Kyushu (note that the northern and southern versions are only sold in their respective coverage areas). If purchasing the pass outside of Japan or via the internet, the actual pass has to be picked up at a major station in the area covered before use.\n\nPurchase the Kyushu Rail Pass\n\nAssessment\n\nThis pass can be of good value, as a roundtrip between Fukuoka and Kagoshima alone costs around 20,000 yen by regular tickets, which is the same as the cost of a 3-day pass.\n\nAlternative tickets\n\nThe Sun Q Pass is a similar offer to the Kyushu Rail Pass except that it is valid on local buses and highway buses instead of trains. Depending on the itinerary, either pass could be more suitable. Unlike the Kyushu Rail Pass, the Sun Q Pass is also available to residents of Japan."
