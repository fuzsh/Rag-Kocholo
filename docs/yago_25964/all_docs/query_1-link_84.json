        "text": "There's nothing more delicious than witnessing internet trolls getting trolled right back.\n\nWhat happened this time? Let's jump into it.\n\nPierce Brosnan and wife Keely Shaye Smith are one of Hollywood's most enduring love stories. When the couple aren't delighting crowds on the red carpet, they're sharing adorable tributes to each other on social media.\n\nBut apparently, Pierce and Keely's marriage is one to avoid. Well, according to some anonymous troll on X.\n\nThe account described itself as “campaigning against misandrist educational institutions who failed men,” which is an excellent start.\n\n“Your daily reminder to avoid marriage,” the post by @RxRedPill was captioned with two photos of the couple taken side-by-side.\n\nThe first photo from 1996 sat beside a photo taken years later, although the more 'recent' photo was actually from 2008.\n\nThe obvious meaning of the tweet was to suggest that Smith had gained weight over time, reinforcing that old chestnut that women 'let themselves go' when they get married.\n\nThe tweet has since gone viral, being viewed over 55 million times, but not for the reasons the user probably wanted.\n\nThe overwhelming response is people mocking the ignorant post, with one user saying \"She literally got hotter,\" to another commenting \"Our daily reminder that you're a shallow chauvinist.\"\n\nThe caption “Your daily reminder to avoid marriage,” has since been repurposed on X to showcase marriages that actually are contentious. One user shared Donald and Melania Trump looking miserable together while another posted vintage photos of Bill and Hillary Clinton before their cheating scandal.\n\nIn short, the tweet backfired... big time.\n\nSadly for this random troll, everyone knows that Pierce and Keely are the ultimate couple goals — and the James Bond actor agrees.\n\n\"Wherever I went in the world I missed her, and I’d send her tickets to come so we could be together. We just seemed to fit,\" he told People in 2017.\n\n“I found a great woman in Keely Shaye. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.”\n\nThe action star met journalist Keely at a party in Cabo San Lucas in 1994 and were married in 2001. They've since been married for over 20 years and together for nearly 30 years.\n\nPierce and Keely have raised five children, including two sons the couple welcomed together, Paris and Dylan.\n\nIn another interview with Closer in 2018, Brosnan spoke about being “lucky enough to find love again,” with Smith after losing his first wife Cassandra Harris, who passed away from cancer in 1991.\n\n“We were meant to find each other. I thank God for her every day,” he said. “When Keely looks at me, I go weak. I love her vitality, her passion. She has this strength that I wouldn’t be able to live without.”\n\nBrosnan doesn't think marriage holds him back — it's his biggest strength.\n\n“I’ve been a married man most of my life — that’s the way I like it. I’m one of those guys who believes you need a strong woman in your life,\" he said.\n\nIn a rare response to internet trolls critiquing Keely's body, Brosnan posted a since-deleted comment on Facebook in 2022. \"Friends offered her surgery to reduce her weight. But I strongly love every curve of her body,\" he wrote.\n\n\"She is the most beautiful woman in my eyes. And also because she had our five children. In the past, I truly loved her for her person, not only for her beauty, and now I’m loving her even more that she is my children’s mother. And I am very proud of her, and I always seek to be worthy of her love.\"\n\nThe Mrs. Doubtfire actor also referenced some of the body-shaming comments in a 2023 interview. \"We like each other a lot. We love each other a lot,” Brosnan told Fox News earlier this year.\n\n“Watching someone grow up with you and grow old with you is a very spiritual journey. To watch each other change … whatever it may be, the hair [or] the waist … it’s [about] the love in the heart.”\n\nSmith also shared the same sentiments about her husband in a rare interview. “Pierce is intelligent, captivating and his real beauty emanates from the soul,” she told Closer in 2018.\n\n“And, like a fine wine, he’s aging beautifully.”\n\nFeature image: Getty."
