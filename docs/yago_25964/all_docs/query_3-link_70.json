        "text": "Pierce Brosnan and his wife Keely were photographed arriving at an awards event together in Los Angeles, on Wednesday (7 March).\n\nThe husband and wife were hand-in-hand as they posed for photographers at the 18th Annual Oscar Wilde Awards, which were held by the US-Ireland Alliance in Santa Monica, California, this week.\n\nPierce and Keely wore co-ordinated looks for the evening, both in monochrome black tailoring. Pierce opted for a velvet suit jacket and trousers, with a black shirt and silky cravat. Keely was also in a suit, with a tuxedo style jacket over straight-leg trousers which she paired with a black silky blouse featuring statement frills down the centre. Keeping her accessories simple, Keely wore droplet pearl earrings, with warm, neutral makeup and a sweep of glossy pink lipstick.\n\nPierce was honoured with an award during the ceremony, presented in honour of his extensive career. The legendary Irish actor was also pictured at the event enjoying a pint of another of Ireland's most famous exports; Guinness. Other guests in attendance on the evening included Peaky Blinders and Oppenheimer star, Cillian Murphy.\n\nSpeaking of his fellow actor when interviewed at the event, Pierce Brosnan told the BBC, \"Cillian would do a magnificent job as James Bond on His Majesty's Secret Service.\"\n\nPierce Brosnan and Keely have been together for over two decades, marrying in 2001. The pair have two children together, Paris Brosnan (now 23) Dylan Brosnan (now 27), while Pierce also has three other children from his previous marriage, and two grandchildren."
