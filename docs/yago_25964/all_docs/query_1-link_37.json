        "text": "Pierce Brosnan and his wife Keely Shaye Smith are ultimate Hollywood couple goals and even after three decades together, they appear just as loved-up as when they first met.\n\nThe Irish actor, 70, is set to be honoured at the US-Ireland Alliance's annual Oscar Wilde Awards on Thursday, which is held to celebrate the achievements of Irish actors and filmmakers.\n\nToday's top videos\n\nThe James Bond actor has always been very open about his adoration for his wife and the couple are known for their loved-up displays of affection towards one another. And it's no wonder as Pierce and Keely's love story sounds like the plot straight out of a movie.\n\nFirst encounter in Mexico\n\nBefore they met, Pierce was married to actress and former Bond girl Cassandra Harris for 11 years, from 1980 until she tragically died in 1991 after a battle with ovarian cancer.\n\nHe got a second chance at love when he met 30-year-old journalist Keely in Mexico in April 1994. Keely had flown out to interview American actor Ted Danson and ended up at a party in Cabo San Lucas where she met her future husband.\n\nThe pair had an instant spark, with Keely telling People that he was 'captivating' and had a 'mischievous sparkle in his eyes' - and they went on their first date days later.\n\nBlended family\n\nThe couple have two grown-up sons together who they welcomed before they got married. Their first child Dylan, 27, was born in 1997, and Paris, 23, was born six months before their wedding in 2001.\n\nPierce also has three children from his first marriage, his adopted daughter Charlotte - who sadly died of ovarian cancer in 2013 at the age of 41 - and sons Christopher, 51, and Sean, 40.\n\nIrish castle wedding\n\nThe Hollywood couple got married in 2001 and chose Ireland as their location, exchanging their vows in Ballintubber Abbey.\n\nTheir wedding reception was straight out of a fairytale and the newlyweds hosted their guests at Ashford Castle on the banks of Lough Corrib in County Mayo. The wedding featured on the cover of Hello! Magazine and showed many romantic shots of them kissing and smiling widely at the camera.\n\nThirty years and still in love\n\nThirty years later, the Brosnans are known for their sweet and genuine displays of affection. On Keely's 60th birthday last year, Pierce showered her with sixty red roses to celebrate.\n\nPierce and Keely have also seen each other through bereavement, a wildfire that claimed most of their possessions in 2015, and their son Christopher's struggle with addiction issues. The couple have taken the 'for better, for worse' part of their marriage vows seriously and have proven themselves to be one of Hollywood's few steadfast couples."
