        "text": "What is Keely Shaye Smith's Net Worth?\n\nKeely Shaye Smith is an American journalist, author, television host, model, and actress who has a net worth of $100 million. That is a combined net worth with her husband Pierce Brosnan. Keely Shaye Smith was born in Vallejo, California in September 1963. She has been married to Pierce Brosnan since 2001. They have two children together.\n\nAs an actress she appeared in an episode of the soap opera General Hospital as well as in the film The Opponent and in the TV movie Norman's Corner. Keely Shaye Smith wrote and directed the documentary Poisoning Paradise in 2018. From 1995 to 1997 she was a correspondent for the television series Unsolved Mysteries. In 2001 Keely Shaye Smith won a Women in Film Crystal Award shared with her husband Pierce Brosnan. In 2017 she won the Brosnan Award at the Hawaii European Cinema Film Festival with Brosnan for Poisoning Paradise. She appeared with Huey Lewis in his music video for \"Stuck on You\". Keely Shaye Smith also served as an environmental correspondent for ABC's the Home Show and a gardening expert for ABC's Good Morning America.\n\nReal Estate: Pierce and Keely own a number of impressive properties around the globe. In 1996 Pierce on his own bought a home in Malibu out of foreclosure for $600,000. He sold his house in 2012 for $2.6 million. In 2000 the Brosnans bought a one-are beachfront property in Malibu for an undisclosed price. They torn down the existing home and built a 13,000 square-foot Tahitian style mansion that sits on 120 feet of ocean frontage. Over various summers, Pierce and Keely have rented the house during summer months for $250,000 PER MONTH. A fire in 2015 destroyed part of the home including the garage which housed several extremely valuable cars including the 2002 Aston Martin V12 Vanquish made famous by the 2002 Bond movie Die Another Day. The home was damaged again in November 2019 during the Woolsey Fire that destroyed large portions of Malibu. Today Pierce's Malibu house is estimated to be worth $20-25 million. In September 2019 the Brosnans spent $2.4 million on a relatively-modest home in Santa Monica, California."
