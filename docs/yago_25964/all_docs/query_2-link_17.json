This was three years after the passing of Pierce's first wife, Cassandra Harris, after a tragic battle with ovarian cancer.\n\n\"He was captivating. Tall, dark and handsome â€“ everything that everybody would immediately be attracted to. He had this mischievous sparkle in his eyes. I thought, 'Wow! Wow!'\" she told People.\n\nLATEST: Pierce Brosnan's wife Keely Shaye dotes on sons Dylan and Paris in radiant throwback photos\n\nThey had their first date just days later, during which they \"sat down under the stars and he held my hand. There were fireworks going off over our heads, and Kenny Loggins was singing. We talked until 3 in the morning.\"\n\n\"I understand why women find him sexy, because he is an appealing man,\" she said. \"He really likes and appreciates women.\"\n\nMORE: Pierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye's son Paris looks identical to his James Bond dad in striking new photo\n\nOn the 30th anniversary of the day they met, Keely took to Instagram with a post looking back on their love story with several photos spanning the length of their relationship.\n\n\"4-8-94 was my lucky day. How could I have known as I walked around the corner and into your life that my destiny was about to change forever?\" she lovingly penned.\n\nSEE: Pierce Brosnan and wife Keely's sweetest PDA couple moments\n\n\"Thanking my lucky stars that I had the courage to introduce myself to you and forever grateful for the connection and family we share 3 decades later.
