        "text": "The internet has fallen head over heals in love with the County Meath star Pierce Brosnan and his public displays of affection for his wife of 25 years… It’d make your heart swell!\n\nThe former James Bond actor and native of Navan, County Meath, Pierce Brosnan and his wife Keely Shaye Smith’s loving relationship would bring a smile to the face of even the most hardened. The couple’s 25th wedding anniversary social media post seems to have pushed the public over the edge – they’ve gone viral.\n\nA post on the popular site Bored Panda relaying the tale of Brosnan and his wife’s marriage has gone viral with over 135,000 shares on Facebook. It’s plain to see why, the photos and Brosnan’s heart-felt messages on social media would bring a tear to your eye.\n\nFor the couple’s 25th anniversary on July 19 Brosnan posted a gorgeous photo of the pair staring lovingly into each other’s eyes with the text “Thank you for the love my love of these past 25 years, onwards.” Wow!\n\nBrosan’s public displays of affection for his wife is nothing news. Back in 2010 Brosnan told the German magazine, Frau im Spiegel “I’m in love like it was the first day. We complement one another. Keely is very good at what she does - as a mother, friend and partner. I know exactly when I have to say, “Yes, darling!”\n\nHe added “We go together through thick and thin and - God willing - we will do that until the end of our lives.”\n\nBrosnan, who is known for playing an on screen ladies man, including James Bond, was dealt a hard hand before he was married to Shaye Smith.\n\nTragically in 1991 Brosnan lost his first wife, Cassandra Harris, to ovarian cancer at the young age of just 43. He then lost his step-daughter Charlotte to the same disease. She was just 42.\n\nHappily in 1994 Brosnan met the former TV journalist, Shaye Smith, in Cabo, San Lucas. She was working as a correspondent at the time and met the County Meath star at a party after an interview with Ted Danson had fallen through.\n\nSeven years later, in 2001, they were married at the 785-year-old Ballintubber Abbey, in County Mayo, Ireland.\n\nIn a 2014 interview with the German magazine Meins Brosnan said “I love her vitality, her passion,\" he said. \"She has this strength that I wouldn't be able to live without. When Keely looks at me, I go weak.\"\n\nNeed we say anything more but… swoon!\n\nAre you a big Pierce Brosnan fan? What’s been your favorite film of his? Let us know in the comments section below."
