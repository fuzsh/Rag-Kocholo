        "text": "Pierce Brosnan and his beloved wife Keely have now been married for over 20 years. In fact, this sweet duo have been together for nearly 30 years and have raised 5 children, including 2 sons that Keely and Pierce welcomed together. The James Bond star composes the sweetest messages for his adorable wife and seems to be deeply in love with her, just like the day they met. Today, we’d love for you to find out more about the woman who’s captivated one of the most desired men of the epoch.\n\nThe big love came after the big loss.\n\nPierce Brosnan went through ups and downs in his love life, and it finally led him to a marriage with Keely Shaye Smith that has lasted for over 20 years.\n\nThe actor was married to Cassandra Harris from 1980 until her death in 1991. The couple welcomed son Sean and Brosnan also adopted Harris’ daughter Charlotte and son Chris from a previous marriage after their dad passed.\n\nAfter his first wife’s death, Brosnan was struggling to cope with his loss. He said in an interview, “When your partner gets cancer, then life changes. Your timetable and reference for your normal routines and the way you view life, all this changes.”\n\nSitting at a beach party in Mexico, the actor was still grieving the loss of his first wife. He was almost sure he’d never have that love again. And here was when he met Keely Shaye, who actually “saved” him at a time when a dark depression and uncertainty in life seemed to be taking hold.\n\nKeely gave Pierce a strong second chance in love and breathed life into his body again.\n\nNow Pierce Brosnan is deeply grateful to his wife for being in his life and always supporting him. He says, “I found a great woman in Keely Shaye. Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.”\n\nAnd the actor has reasons for thinking and saying so, as Keely has a vitality, passion, and strength that Pierce just couldn’t live without.\n\nShe came into his life when he was not only mourning his loss but when he was also a single father, with a 19-year-old son entering a troublesome period of bad habits and 2 other children struggling to survive without their mother.\n\nShortly after their meeting, Brosnan could not live without Keely Shaye. He had to travel widely for his famous roles, but he felt complete only if Keely was near and would do anything to see her.\n\n“Wherever I went in the world, I missed her, and I’d send her tickets to come, so we could be together. We just seemed to fit,” he said.\n\nKeely has become the main person in Brosnan’s life and nothing seems to be able to change it.\n\nOur bodies and appearances change over the years due to all sorts of factors and lifestyles, but for Pierce, his wife is still the most beautiful woman on Earth. He once shared how “friends offered Keely surgery to reduce her weight,” and this comment left the actor furious.\n\n“I strongly love every curve of her body. She is the most beautiful woman in my eyes. And also because she had our 5 children,” Brosnan wrote after a Facebook post went viral fat shaming Keely.\n\nDefending his wife from nasty trolls, he added: “In the past, I truly loved her for her person, not only for her beauty, and now I’m loving her even more that she is my children’s mother. And I am very proud of her, and I always seek to be worthy of her love.”\n\nAnd Keely returns her husband’s love by being the most devoted wife and the most doting mother. “Still celebrating the day we met, on a beach in Mexico,” she wrote in one of her posts. And it truly seems to be a love that will last forever."
