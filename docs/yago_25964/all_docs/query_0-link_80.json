To many more years with your brown eyed girl.’\n\nAnother commented: ‘Love you Keely and Pierce! Congratulations!’\n\nA third added: ‘Happy anniversary you most magnificent love birds.’\n\nIt comes not long after Keely paid tribute to the Bond star on his birthday, with the journalist sharing a throwback picture to mark his 71st birthday back in May.\n\n‘Happy Birthday to the love of my life @piercebrosnanofficial. You are my rock, my anchor, my everything… and I love you endlessly.’\n\nIt comes following a hectic year to date for the actor, who is set to star in Four Letters of Love alongside Helena Bonham Carter as well as drama Places, Please with Kathy Bates.\n\nElsewhere, the Louth native was confirmed in the movie adaptation of The Thursday Murders Club, which was written by Pointless co-host Richard Osman.\n\nHelen Mirren and Ben Kingsley have also been named on the star-studded cast list.\n\nThe story follows a group of geriatric friends in a retirement home who gather to solve murders for fun, but find themselves caught in a real case involving a property developer.\n\nThe best-selling books have become a global phenomenon in the genre dubbed ‘cosy crime’, garnering a staggering fan base worldwide.\n\nThe first novel in the series was released in 2020 to critical acclaim and was the fastest-selling adult crime debut in recorded history.\n\nSince then there have been three more novels published, which have sold over 10 million copies combined. A fifth novel is on the way in 2025 also."
