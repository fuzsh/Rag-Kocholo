        "text": "Pierce Brosnan’s wife Keely Shaye Smith was recently the subject of cruel trolling – but she’s getting the last laugh.\n\nThe couple have been happily married for 22 years, and the James Bond star is forever publically praising her.\n\nNow aged 70 and 60 respectively, the pair are still very much in love and regularly share updates on their lives together on social media.\n\nBut one troll on X, formerly Twitter, thought they would take aim at Keely for, well, marrying, and staying married to Pierce.\n\n‘Your daily reminder to avoid marriage,’ wrote the vile Tweet from an account which describes itself as ‘campaigning against misandrist educational institutions who failed men’.\n\nAlongside this statement, the user posted a side-by-side picture of Pierce and Keely decades ago, and them now.\n\nClearly attempting to make a dig at the American journalist for how her body changed after 20 years and two children, the troll’s post, thankfully, backfired massively.\n\nThousands of users leapt to Keely and Pierce’s defence, with many pointing out that Keely still looks gorgeous, with user Cera Gibson writing ‘If I ever get married, I hope my spouse still loves me when … I don’t age over the course of 20 years.’\n\nUser DiobolicalSpuds said what everyone was thinking with the tweet: ‘THESE PICS DO NOT HAVE THE DESIRED RHETORICAL IMPACT YOU IMAGINED’ – to the tune of 200,000 likes, compared to the original post’s 3,000 likes.\n\nNatalie wrote sarcastically: ‘Marriage is SO dangerous. You could end up spending every day with the love of your life and in 20 years, she’ll look the same … to me, this is bad…’\n\nAnd Slatizm wrote: ‘bro really said “noooo a beautiful loving wife of 22 years get awayyy”.’\n\nAs user Gabrielle A Perry put it: ‘Pierce Brosnan lost his first wife, daughter, and mother in law all to ovarian cancer.\n\n‘He remarried to Keely almost a decade later and be 10 toes DOWN on protecting and honoring her. He loves that woman’s dirty drawers\n\n‘He’s not a ghoul like you incels.’\n\nPierce and Keely married in 2001 after meeting in 1994; they are parents to two sons: Dylan Thomas, 26 and Paris, 22.\n\nKeely is Pierce’s second wife, as he was first married to Australian actress Cassandra Harris from 1980 until 1991, with the pair welcoming three children.\n\nTragically, Harris died aged 43 from ovarian cancer, the same disease her mother died from – and the couple’s daughter Charlotte also died from ovarian cancer in 2013 at the age of 41.\n\nLast year, Pierce shared a sweet post in honour of his and Keely’s wedding anniversary, declaring he would ‘do it all again.’\n\nTaking to Instagram where he shared a snap from their wedding day, he reminisced: ‘Happy Anniversary my love Keely, we danced that night and still dance the dance today.\n\n‘I could do it all again.’\n\nGot a story?\n\nIf you’ve got a celebrity story, video or pictures get in touch with the Metro.co.uk entertainment team by emailing us celebtips@metro.co.uk, calling 020 3615 2145 or by visiting our Submit Stuff page – we’d love to hear from you.\n\nMORE : Pierce Brosnan ‘taking legal action’ over ‘false’ meet and greet claims"
