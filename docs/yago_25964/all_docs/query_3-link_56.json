        "text": "Pierce Brosnan’s stardom and appeal have endured for more than three decades. It’s not hard to see why: although he’s no longer a young man, his timeless good looks have only gotten better with age, and he has numerous memorable film and TV franchises on his resume. He is best known as Remington Steele in the 80s, James Bond in the 90s, and most recently Sam Carmichael from Mamma Mia and its sequel.\n\nWe’re sure many women across the world have fantasized about being the dashing actor’s beloved wife. One lucky woman has been carrying the coveted title for 25 years: American TV personality and glamour model Keely Shaye Smith!\n\nWho is Keely Shaye Smith?\n\nEven before being known as Mrs. Brosnan, Keely has already had her share of the spotlight! She first entered showbiz as a model, and she appeared in Huey Lewis’s music video for “Stuck With You” in 1986. In 1990 she appeared in TV show General Hospital as a minor character.\n\nShe is probably best known for being a correspondent in various news shows like Good Morning America, The Today Show, Entertainment Tonight, Unsolved Mysteries, and most notably in ABC’s The Home Show. Her work as an environmental correspondent on The Home Show has garnered her several awards (including two Genesis Awards).\n\nShe is a gardening and horticulture enthusiast, and is still frequently invited to appear on lifestyle television shows to share her expertise. She is currently writing a book on horticulture.\n\nHow Did The Couple Meet, And How Old Were They When They Fell In Love\n\nPierce and Keely met in 1994 at a beach party in Mexico, which Keely attended to interview actor Ted Danson. He was 41, and she was 31. When they first met, Pierce had already been a widower for 3 years.\n\nHe was previously married to Australian Bond girl Cassandra Harris from 1980 until 1991, when she died from a battle with ovarian cancer. She was 43. Pierce has always been vocal about his gratitude for Keely’s support during his period of grief after Cassandra’s passing.\n\nWhen Did They Marry?\n\nAfter 7 years together, the couple got married in 2001. They tied the knot in Ballintubber Abbey in Pierce’s native Ireland.\n\nBy this point, the couple already had 4 kids: Charlotte and Christopher (whom Pierce had adopted from Cassandra’s previous marriage), Sean (Pierce and Cassandra’s biological son), and Dylan Thomas, born in 1997 before their wedding. Soon after they exchanged vows, they welcomed another son of their own, Paris Beckett, in 2001.\n\nUnfortunately, in 2013, the family lost Charlotte to ovarian cancer: the same illness that took her mother Cassandra.\n\nWhat Are Pierce And Keely Up To Now?\n\nPierce is still working hard as an actor to this day: his most recent hit at the box office was Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again, the 2018 sequel to the wildly successful Mamma Mia.\n\nThe couple has always been proactive with their philanthropy and activism, which often benefits environmental causes. Aside from their work as entertainers, they are famous for being incredibly close and loyal to each other. Pierce is known to fly her out to set whenever he misses her, wherever in the world that might be.\n\nPierce is very vocal about his affection for Keely on social media, who he always refers to as “my girl” in his posts. Whenever the two are out on a date, or whenever they’re celebrating a milestone in their relationship, or whenever he feels like it, Pierce is sure to post a sweet picture of them together!\n\nOn their 25th anniversary, Pierce wrote a loving letter to Keely which he posted on Instagram.\n\nWhat were Keely’s struggles with her weight?\n\nBeing a public figure herself, Keely’s looks are always under scrutiny. When she gained over 70 pounds soon after her marriage to Pierce, media outlets were quick to notice and question the sudden change. She ascribes her rapid weight gain to her two pregnancies and her ongoing issues with her thyroid gland.\n\nThe changes in her body have not stopped her from enjoying a day at the beach: she and her husband were snapped in 2008 in revealing swimwear. The photos were met with ridicule, but the happy couple couldn’t care any less. Pierce even went on record to say that he has encouraged her to embrace her new curves.\n\nThere were rumours abound that Keely was undergoing an extreme weight loss diet and exercise routine in order to keep her health in check."
