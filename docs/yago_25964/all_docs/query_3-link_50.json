        "text": "Sitting at a beach party in Mexico, Pierce Brosnan was still grieving the loss of his first wife and almost certain he'd never have that love again.\n\nAnd yet, somehow, the bubbly, brown-eyed American journalist Keely Shaye Smith waltzed into his life.\n\nThe year was 1994. It had been three years since Brosnan's movie-star wife Cassandra Harris had lost her battle with ovarian cancer, and he was at his wit's end.\n\nBrosnan was a single father, with a 19-year-old son spiralling into a troublesome period of heavy drinking and drug addiction, and two other children struggling to get by without their mother.\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: The 'scandalous' film set where Penélope Cruz and Javier Bardem met\n\nREAD MORE: Love Stories: Barbra Streisand charmed her future husband James Brolin with one brazen move\n\nHe was also at a comfortable peak in his career, enjoying success from some of his earliest movies (before James Bond, of course), including the Robin Williams hit Mrs Doubtfire and Love Affair, co-starring A-listers Katharine Hepburn and Warren Beatty.\n\nAnd yet, Brosnan found himself at the beach at Cabo San Lucas, stumbling across an eager TV correspondent who was not there to interview him.\n\nA very surprise meeting\n\nSmith, a model-turned-journalist, was actually at the party to interview Cheers actor Ted Danson, but when he was called away, she and Bronson got to talking.\n\n\"He was captivating,\" Smith told People in 2001.\n\n\"Tall, dark and handsome – everything that everybody would immediately be attracted to. He had this mischievous sparkle in his eyes. I thought, 'Wow! Wow!'\"\n\nIn other interviews, Brosnan has admitted meeting Smith \"saved\" him at a time when depression and a static-ness in life seemed to be taking hold.\n\nJust a few days later, the couple had their first date and ended up talking until three in the morning.\n\nREAD MORE: Salma Hayek's love story with billionaire François-Henri Pinault began with a 'silly' conversation\n\n\"We sat down under the stars and [Brosnan] held my hand. There were fireworks going off over our heads, and Kenny Loggins was singing,\" Smith recalled in the interview.\n\nNow he's Bond, James Bond\n\nA year later, Brosnan, now 69, was cast as the next James Bond – a life dream of his since he was 10, and also a dream of his late wife's.\n\nCassandra Harris had been a famous talent on the screen and, at a time, was even more famous than Brosnan. One of her most notable roles was as Countess Lisl von Schlaf in the 1981 Bond movie For Your Eyes Only with former Bond Roger Moore.\n\nSince her casting, Brosnan felt stirred to do the role, and Harris had always hoped her husband would get the chance.\n\nUltimately, Brosnan's role in the famous GoldenEye was momentous in every way and came about just as his new relationship with Smith, who is now 58, was taking off.\n\nThough Brosnan was forced to travel widely for the groundbreaking role, he told People in 2001 he was completed besotted by Smith, and would do anything to see her.\n\n\"Wherever I went in the world I missed her, and I'd send her tickets to come so we could be together. We just seemed to fit,\" he said.\n\n\"I found a great woman in Keely Shaye,\" he said. \"Not if I searched a million times over would I find one as good.\"\n\nFor a daily dose of 9Honey, subscribe to our newsletter here\n\nREAD MORE: Rupert Murdoch and Jerry Hall to divorce\n\nIn 1997, the couple welcomed their first son, Dylan, and in 2001 they welcomed their second son, Paris.\n\nWith two young sons, as well as Brosnan's three older children, Christopher, Charlotte and Sean, from his relationship with Harris, the pair thought it the perfect time to tie the knot.\n\nSo, on August 4, 2001, they married in Brosnan's native home of Ireland. They enjoyed a small ceremony in front of 100 guests at Ballintubber Abbey in County Mayo.\n\nBrosnan's late daughter Charlotte served as a bridesmaid at the wedding, and at the time made some incredibly sweet comments about her father's happy new match.\n\n\"Just seeing the ultimate love that these two people have for each other was unbelievable,\" Charlotte told People at her father's 2001 wedding.\n\n\"My dad found it again, and that makes me happy.\"\n\nThis year, Brosnan and Shaye are 21 years happily married.\n\n'I always seek to be worthy of her love'\n\nA born romantic, Brosnan never misses a chance to celebrate his wife, especially not on their anniversary.\n\nThis year, he shared a particularly heart-melting post, commemorating the original day they met in 1994 and sharing a gallery of photos from their wedding day. See the photos above.\n\n\"Twenty-eight years ago this day, April 8th, 1994, we met in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.\n\n\"We married at Ballintubber Abbey, Ireland then celebrated for three days at Ashford Castle. 8th of the 4th…4884 …my love always, you have made my life one of joy and happiness, light of my life, love…\" he wrote.\n\nFans will notice Brosnan often refers to Smith as his \"brown-eyed girl\", given he often claims it was her eyes that \"caught his heart\".\n\n\"My darling angel heart Keely, thank you for bringing such love and beauty into my life,\" he wrote to Shaye on their anniversary in 2020.\n\n\"For making these past twenty-six years the greatest joy of my life...Happy anniversary my brown-eyed girl.\"\n\nThe pair have been through thick and thin together, and yet they still seem to be as in love as they were on that beach in Cabo.\n\nAnd as much as Smith has supported Brosnan in his career, he is just as loving and adoring.\n\nIn fact, just this year, Brosnan made headlines for lashing back at online trolls who made some uninteresting comments about his wife.\n\nResponding to a now-deleted photo of the couple, Brosnan put the anonymous users in their place.\n\n\"I strongly love every curve of her body. She is the most beautiful woman in my eyes. And also because she had our five children,\" he wrote.\n\nREAD MORE: Woman rescued from hostage situation after sending note through food delivery service\n\n\"In the past, I truly loved her for her person, not only for her beauty, and now I'm loving her even more, now that she is my children's mother. I am very proud of her, and I always seek to be worthy of her love.\"\n\nThe comments are just a few among many the actor often makes. Brosnan has admitted he still gets weak-kneed when his wife looks at him.\n\n\"I love her vitality, her passion,\" he told The Independent in 2014.\n\n\"She has this strength that I wouldn't be able to live without. When Keely looks at me, I go weak.\"\n\nHow do we find a love like that?"
