        "text": "Pierce Brosnan may have played a renowned ladies’ man via his 007 James Bond role, but the man behind the fictional spy character is very much a one-woman guy.\n\nWith Keely For 28 Years\n\nPierce has now been married to his wife Keely Shaye Smith for over two decades. The actor was formerly married to Cassandra Harris, but he hasn’t looked back since hitting it off with Keely.\n\nMet In 1994\n\nPierce first met Keely back in 1994 while the two were in Mexico – they began dating shortly after. By 1997, the couple had welcomed their first son Dylan Thomas and by February 2001, another baby had arrived – Paris Beckett.\n\nMarried In 2001\n\nPierce, 69, married his wife at Ballintubber Abbey in Ireland in 2001. Every red carpet appearance since has seen fans gushing over the couple that’s proving that Hollywood marriages can last.\n\nLoves Her ‘Vitality’ And ‘Passion’\n\nPierce has opened up on both losing his first wife and finding love again with his second.\n\n“I had a great marriage which sadly had its own ending, and I was lucky enough to find love again. We were meant to find each other. I thank God for her every day,” he told Closer back in 2018. “When Keely looks at me, I go weak. I love her vitality, her passion. She has this strength that I wouldn’t be able to live without.”\n\nShe Gushes Right Back\n\nKeely, a journalist, has also sent love to Pierce via a social media post.\n\n“@piercebrosnanofficial thank you for joining me on this wild, joyous ride into parenthood, for your love, support and encouragement. Your heart is so big, so generous, so tender and compassionate. You inspire me everyday and you continue to make me laugh. God bless you! My heart is filled with gratitude,” she wrote for Father’s Day last year.\n\nJoining Celebs With Long-Lasting Marriages\n\nPierce and Keely join the list of celebrities known for long-lasting marriages. Doing similar are Victoria and David Beckham, plus Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos.\n\nThat Wedding Pic\n\nIn August 2022, Pierce marked the couple’s wedding anniversary, sharing a wedding snap of himself and Keely.\n\n“Happy Anniversary my love @keelyshayebrosnan . We danced that night and still dance the dance today. I could do it all again,” he wrote.\n\nShe’s Ten Years Younger\n\nKeely is 59 and was born in 1963. She has never been married before.\n\nFans Love Them!\n\nFans, meanwhile continue to gush over the couple and have also supported Keely through her battle with ovarian cancer."
