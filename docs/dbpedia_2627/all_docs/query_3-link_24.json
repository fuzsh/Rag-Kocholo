        "text": "The LebensArt Fair in Grossharthau is a regional exhibition focusing on the finer things in life, with an emphasis on gardening, living, and lifestyle. It takes place in the picturesque Grossharthau Castle Park within the municipality of Grossharthau. The LebensArt is characterized by its impressive venues, which create unique meeting places and excellently showcase the exhibited products. The Grossharthau Castle Park is known for its beautiful scenery and the historic architecture of the castle.\n\nGrossharthau Castle is a protected baroque castle nestled within an expansive park. The estate provides an attractive setting for various events, including fairs, concerts, and weddings. The event is held annually, having been first inaugurated in 2011. The organizer, Das AgenturHaus GmbH, specializes in arranging lifestyle and pleasure fairs, possessing extensive experience in this field. Das AgenturHaus GmbH organizes both LebensArt and LebensArt Herbstzauber Fairs at various locations in Germany. Exhibitors showcase their diverse and exceptional product range in white pagodas, manicured green spaces, and historic buildings. The high-quality offerings range from seasonal garden and plant arrangements to creative home decor ideas, and from exquisite jewelry to fashion collections. Culinary delights and regional specialties are also offered to visitors. For children, daily childcare is provided, and the organizer offers a collection and delivery service for purchased products to all visitors. Demonstrations by various artisans such as wood carvers, fine artists, and ceramists, as well as musical performances, round off the extensive accompanying program. Grossharthau is located approximately 25 kilometers east of Dresden and is therefore easily accessible by car via the B6 federal highway and the A4 motorway. The place is also reachable by public transport, with a bus connection from Dresden and Bautzen.\n\nThe LebensArt takes place annually, and therefore for the thirteenth time previsibly in June 2025 in Grossharthau."
