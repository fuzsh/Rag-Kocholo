Thanks to the entire Olainfarm team and the company’s Supervisory Council for constructive cooperation. I leave my position with a feeling of job well-done and the company in an excellent financial condition. Given Olainfarm's ambitious plans and planned development, there will be increasingly important role of pharmaceutical industry professionals, who are currently strongly represented on the Management Board of the company.
