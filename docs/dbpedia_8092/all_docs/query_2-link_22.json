        "text": "“Health. Security. Pharmacy”, the first major conference in Latvia devoted to the importance of healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry to the national economy, took place on 9 March with the participation of leading decision-makers and experts. At this conference marking AS Olainfarm's 50th anniversary, it was concluded that healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry can contribute to the national economy and security through investments in human capital and health, and that the readiness of the healthcare and the pharmaceutical industry at X hour is a prerequisite for economic stability.\n\n“Compared with the situation globally, the advantages of the Latvian pharmaceutical industry lie in its outstanding scientific base, strong traditions and priceless innovations. Right now, in Latvia, we already provide a full developmental and supply chain for medicines, incorporating high level education, research and innovations, industrial production and exports, local and regional supply and pharmaceutical care. We have the capability to develop original medicines. However, this requires much more synergy between the medical community and the public, education, science, producers and decision-makers. The availability of medicines has become an issue not only of public health, but also of national security. Therefore, we have invited all the relevant parties to convene at this conference, and I am gratified that we succeeded in initiating such a comprehensive discussion on matters of vital importance to the industry and the national economy,” said AS Olainfarm Chairman of the Board Juris Bundulis.\n\nPharmacy proved itself to be a fundamental industry during Covid-19, when one virus was able to paralyse the whole world, freeze the economy, and bring trade and to a standstill.
