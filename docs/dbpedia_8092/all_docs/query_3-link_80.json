        "text": "Info from her lawyer here on why she was taking the drug...\n\nhttp://www.si.com/tennis/2016/03/07/maria-sharapova-failed-drug-test-john-haggerty-attorney\n\nThanks for that Dan.\n\nWhat I as a lay person won't be able to determine, is whether that was a logical treatment for the condition (or not), nor indeed whether the condition was fabricated as cover for such a prescription. It may be legitimate, it may not be legitimate. Personally I hope it does all stack up, as drugs cheats in any sport will rob a little bit of it's soul (and appeal). I'm sure there will be a range of medical opinions, but the ones that count will be the ones involved in the hearing.\n\nI can't believe the lenient approach some of you are taking. 25 years ago I played hockey at a decent standard for a club with both men's and women's teams in the top tier of the national league. I was friendly with a number of players who were in or around national squads. Bear in mind that hockey then, as now, was an Olympic sport and decidedly amateur. All of those players got regular correspondence (not e-mail back then) with lists of substances to avoid. Most of them carried those lists with them. If one of them had a headache and was offered a pill they didn't recognise and know they would check it against the list and refuse to take it if it wasn't clear.\n\nAnd yet some of us here have sympathy with the world's wealthiest sportswoman, with a large support team, because, apparently, she and they failed to open the link they were sent with a list of newly banned substances? Really? Would you have felt the same way if this was Serena Williams? If this was innocent then it exhibits extraordinary negligence and complacency and, fundamentally, a lack of professionalism.\n\nThe whole thing hangs on why she was prescribed it. The facts are that the drug can enhance endurance. It was legal, but was not medically permitted in the West but was used widely in Russia.\n\nSome athletes will see a legal drug, that enhances performance and so use it.\n\nRussia has been using drugs for decades, legally and illegally to enhance performace.\n\nThis may just have been made illegal - but it does still enhance performance and is now illegal.\n\nIn cases such as this where a legal change is made I believe that Athletes who have taken it and are caught with it within a certain time frame should be able to go to a neutral WADA doctor, get tests etc to show why they were taking it. If a test showed Sharapova has a condition that this drug is used to treat then leniency is the way forward. BUT if it looks like she was exploiting a loophole to gain advantage - ie no medical reason to take the drug then she should be done over..\n\nSadly though my immediate thoughts are - Russian Fed dopes, we know this. They find an advantage in a legal drug - so everyone takes it. Some carry one with it after it's banned because they were taking it for performance enhancing reasons not medical ones.\n\nThe drug she has been taking is not legal in the US or here but she is prescribed it by her \"family doctor\".Just a tad suspicious to me.\n\nMy understanding based on the minimal but varied information provided so far is that the drug is not approved by the FDA rather being not legal - it apparently originates from Latvia.\n\nAs for 'the normal course of treatment' being 4-6 weeks [if accurate] may not be inconsistent with it being used for 10 years on an as needed basis.\n\nApparently there are others [8? from a range of sports] that have been caught out with this same drug.\n\nI have no idea about the actual reason for its use [Sharapova has claimed it was used to treat a personal medical problem] but it only became 'banned' [1 Jan 2016] at the beginning of the month of the competition during which she was tested.\n\nNevertheless it seems very odd that she would deliberately keep taking a drug if she knew it had just been banned since the chances were high [perhaps definite] of a test for her bearing in mind she was expected to go well into the tournament. OTOH it is also very odd that her team had not picked it up since they would surely pay particular attention to any and every newly banned substance.\n\nNo doubt more will be revealed.\n\nAnother Russian cheat in my opinion. I was an oarsman and follow rowing all the time so watch out for the Russian crews at the Olympics..bet they are involved in something shady too!\n\nI thought she left Russia when she was a young child and had lived in the US ever since with all her coaches and team being American? Not sure she's in any way connected to the Russian sports infrastructure and all its supposed drug taking.\n\nOf course, being more American than Russian is actually worse given the appalling US sports record on doping.\n\nDan\n\nI can't believe the lenient approach some of you are taking. 25 years ago I played hockey at a decent standard for a club with both men's and women's teams in the top tier of the national league.

Really? Would you have felt the same way if this was Serena Williams? If this was innocent then it exhibits extraordinary negligence and complacency and, fundamentally, a lack of professionalism.\n\nMark,\n\nI might worry more about serena because she has such a stupendously muscular physique and US sport has such an appalling record for steroids.\n\nDan\n\nThere is a difference between ‘illegal’ and ‘not approved’. Drugs are licensed in the US by the FDA (MHRA in the UK). To gain approval the drug must be submitted along with all supporting evidence for the specific indication for which it wishes to be licensed. There is nothing to prevent you taking a medicine not approved by the FDA, or indeed to prevent a doctor from prescribing an unlicensed drug or a drug off-label, if that is their clinical judgment (in practice most health care institutions have a Formulary) .\n\nFor info only the details below are from the Meldonium PIL\n\n‘Always take Meldonium Olainfarm exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you are not sure. The doctor determines the dose and duration of treatment.\n\nIn view of a possible development of exciting effect it is recommended to take the drug in the first half of the day.\n\n- complex therapy of stable angina pectoris and miocardium infarction: i/v 500-1000 mg once daily. Treatment is proceeded using the medicine Meldonium Olainfarm 250 mgcapsules 500-1000 mg daily. Treatment course is 4-6 weeks.\n\n- complex therapy of acute and chronic ischemic cerebrovascular disorders: i/v 500 mg once daily during 2-3 weeks. Treatment is proceeded using the medicine Meldonium Olainfarm 250 mg capsules 500 mg daily. The average treatment course is 6 weeks.’\n\nRef: http://olainfarm.lv/en/prescription-drugs/meldonium-olainfarm-3\n\nI think there are really only two solutions to drug use in sports.\n\nOne, ban nothing and allow a free for all (adults only).\n\nTwo, ban everything that isn't in real food with exceptions for approved medicines prescribed by an independent doctor and to be advised to the governing body before commencement.\n\nOtherwise the cat and mouse game will never end.\n\nTotally agree with the second. They shouldn't be allowed to supplement their ability by popping pills - good diet and hard work and natural talent should be the only thing that enables an athlete from any sport to gain an advantage over their opponents. There is no excuse for medical conditions, requiring the athlete to take medication, to not be openly declared and verified independently to the appropriate sporting bodies.\n\nI think her story is legit. ie it's a genuine screw up that didn't lead to her gaining any advantage. I'd be interested to know why the drug suddenly became banned though ie what it's supposed to enhance.\n\nThat was my take on it. If there is some enhancement, she was getting the same effect legitimately during the previous decade on the drug.\n\nDon't WADA usually rely on the fact that many seemingly innocuous products are banned as they can act as a mask to those drugs which do enhance performance?\n\nFor me Dick Pound hit the nail on the head in his response \"Running a $30m business depends on you staying eligible to play tennis\""
