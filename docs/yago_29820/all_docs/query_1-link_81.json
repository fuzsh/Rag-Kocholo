        "text": "Jug said on 5/Jun/23\n\nI would have bought 6'1 for Harvey. He would have been an interesting choice for Bond, I think, having seen A Dandy in Aspic recently. He almost has Daniel's Craig's demeanor, not to mention a similar monotone voice. He looks a bit like Hoagy Carmichael, on whom Fleming based Bond's looks.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 5/Feb/22\n\nI see a lot of Jason Isaac in the above photo...crazy to think Laurence was actually dying of cancer when that photo was taken\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 13/Jun/19\n\nAverage guess is too low\n\nJames said on 12/Nov/17\n\nHarvey was exactly six feet tall.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 11/Oct/17\n\nIn some photos he actually looks similar to Caine, less than 1in\n\nRory said on 5/Aug/17\n\nI think 6'0.75. He only looked 2-3 inches shorter than John Wayne in The Alamo and about an inch shorter than Michael Caine. Can't see him below 184 range.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 8/Jan/17\n\nI think 6ft0Â½ is a better fit (from there you could argue either 6ft0Â¼ and 6ft0Â¾). Could look across that 6ft-6ft1 range\n\nArch Stanton said on 8/Jun/16\n\nRob can you squeeze in I am a Camera and Romeo and Juliet? Not really caterfran, though in Room at the Top, yes quite similar, though hairstyle was largely the reason for that.\n\ncaterfran@gmail.om said on 6/Jun/16\n\nokay I see an amazing resemblance to Clint Eastwood\n\nTom said on 5/Apr/16\n\nI don't think audiences in 1962 would have accepted a Jewish James Bond.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 16/Feb/16\n\nI was watching Married To The Mob last night (very underrated movie). I swear to God, a young 30-year old Alec Baldwin looked impeccably like Laurence Harvey. Same hairstyle, dimpled chin and that signature icy stare.\n\nLarry said on 20/Sep/15\n\nLaurence Harvey was six foot.\n\nI can see there being an openly gay Hollywood star one day, but not a gay actor playing James Bond.\n\nSam said on 19/Aug/15\n\nHaha, ok tough guy.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 29/Jun/15\n\nSam says on 25/Nov/14\n\nFrom what I've read, Harvey swung both ways but preferred the men's team. People have talked about a black Bond & a female Bond, maybe a gay Bond isn't so out of left field\n\nYou take that rubbish elsewhere.\n\nSam said on 25/Nov/14\n\nFrom what I've read, Harvey swung both ways but preferred the men's team. People have talked about a black Bond & a female Bond, maybe a gay Bond isn't so out of left field.\n\nJohn said on 19/Nov/14\n\nEven today a gay actor would never be cast as James Bond.\n\nArch Stanton said on 4/Nov/14\n\nSam says on 15/Oct/14\n\nI would argue that he was not that slight. Though certainly slender, he wasn't rail thin (like, say, a young Jimmy Stewart). Not broad-built like Connery and Craig but not that much skinnier than Brosnan or Dalton when they were younger. In fact I could see a Harvey Bond, chilly, detached, a bit androgynous, as a fascinating contrast to Connery's.\n\nI didn't say he was rail thin. I said slender/athletic. exactly like Bond should be.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 18/Oct/14\n\nConnery was described by Fleming as an \"overgrown stuntman\". Technically, this guy was physically closer to the books description\n\nJames said on 17/Oct/14\n\nI doubt Harvey was ever considered for the Bond role because his homosexuality was well known by 1961.\n\nJames said on 17/Oct/14\n\nIronically his co-star from \"The Good Die Young\" Stanley Baker was considered for the Bond role, but was felt to be too tough-looking.\n\nSam said on 15/Oct/14\n\nI would argue that he was not that slight. Though certainly slender, he wasn't rail thin (like, say, a young Jimmy Stewart). Not broad-built like Connery and Craig but not that much skinnier than Brosnan or Dalton when they were younger. In fact I could see a Harvey Bond, chilly, detached, a bit androgynous, as a fascinating contrast to Connery's.\n\nArch Stanton said on 14/Oct/14\n\nNot really James, James Bond was supposed to be tall, dark and slender build, Connery if anything was more muscular than described. Harvey looks closer to the drawing and description of James Bond physically than any of the actual actors who played James Bond.\n\nJames said on 12/Oct/14\n\nHarvey was too slight to play Bond. His religion was Jewish although he would be considered South African.\n\nSam said on 10/Oct/14\n\nYeah, I agree, he could look closer to the Fleming version of Bond than Connery. I think he was viewed in Hollywood as a chilly Brit but was really a Lithuanian Jew.\n\nSam said on 8/Oct/14\n\nRob, is there a chance of a full 6'1\" listing for Harvey? He looks near 6 inches taller I think than Sinatra in Arch's photo and here looks only a couple inches shorter than John Wayne. If not, I think at least 6'0.5\"-6'0.75\" is fair.\n\nClick Here\n\nEditor Rob\n\nhe's been described both 6ft and 6ft 1, I thought a strong 6ft was possible, I'm not as sure about a full 6ft 1 although it isn't impossible.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 7/Oct/14\n\nMr. V, Perkins is further away from the camera and is legs are further apart.\n\nArch Stanton said on 7/Oct/14\n\nThe remake has nothing on the original which is one of the greatest films ever made! Yeah in a fair few of his roles like Darling for instance he wasn't anything to shout about but his performances in Room, Butterfield and Manchurian especially were quite brilliant. I think a flat 6' is undercutting him a bit, he could pass for 6'1\".\n\nMr.V said on 6/Oct/14\n\nSorry, I meant great addition.\n\nIn 'The Outrage' he and Paul Newman are seen standing back to back for a gun duel and he looks about 3 inches taller, which would indeed put him at 184 cm.\n\nIn this photo he may look similar to Anthony Perkins:\n\nClick Here\n\nSeeing this photo and comparing him to 6'3\" Gary Cooper in 'Friendly Persuasion', I wonder if Perkins was no more than 6'1\".\n\nHarvey's one of my favourite actors and a great comedic talent as well, see 'Expressp Bongo'. Can you add that, Rob? It was a personal favourite of his.\n\nSam said on 6/Oct/14\n\nYes, Schreiber inhabited the Raymond Shaw role and was quite good. The original Manchurian is one of my all-time favorites & I thought I'd hate a remake but it was pretty good, if not as great as the first. Schreiber might be my favorite modern actor (especially on stage) but he's not quite equal to Harvey in the part. Denzel and Jeffrey Wright are a bit better I think their equivalents in the original IMO.\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 6/Oct/14\n\nI haven't actually seen the original Manchurian Candidate. I did see the remake with Denzel Washington and Liev Schrieber. Did Harvey play the same character as Liev, by any chance? I see a small resemblance there aswell in the eyes.\n\nSam said on 6/Oct/14\n\nYeah, I see 184-185 cm range for Harvey. Besides his roles, he could pull off near 6'1\" with the all-star line-up in those John Wayne birthday party pictures.\n\nHis work in Manchurian is one of my favorite screen performances ever...it called on his best strengths as an actor, coldness (while in brainwashed state) and intensity. I also liked him in Room at the Top but wasn't won over by many of his other performances.\n\nArch Stanton said on 5/Oct/14\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover says on 4/Oct/14\n\nFacially, he reminds me a lot of a young Alec Baldwin.\n\nReally?? I thought if anything he looked more like a younger Clint Eastwood in Room at the Top! Click Here but it was haircut really. Yeah, he was one of the best actors I've ever seen, very underrated really. His performance in Manchurian Candidate was quite brilliant in particular.\n\nArch Stanton said on 5/Oct/14\n\nJames, no offense but your posts \"he was exactly\" end of come across as a bit arrogant. You didn't measure these people, don't be so certain!!\n\nRampage(-_-_-)Clover said on 4/Oct/14\n\nFacially, he reminds me a lot of a young Alec Baldwin. I'd have guessed 6ft2, watching Room At Top and The Alamo but I think that was only because he was so thin.\n\nBut he was an awesome actor and he left us far too early\n\nMr.V said on 4/Oct/14\n\nGreat addiction! His biography 'Reach for the Top' (by his former sister-in-law) says he was six feet; I agree he may have been a fraction over it, though. He's pretty much eye to eye with Richard Harris in 'The Long and the Short and the Tall'.\n\nJames said on 4/Oct/14\n\nHarvey was exactly six foot. He could appear taller because he was quite thin.\n\nArch Stanton said on 4/Oct/14\n\nAt times actually he could give the illusion of near 6'2\", but I think somewhere in 184-85 range would be more accurate than 6' flat. Underrated actor in many respects, I thought his performance in Manchurian Candidate in particular was Oscar worthy but 1962 was a tough year, O'Toole, Lemmon and numerous others were deserving that year.\n\nJeffC said on 4/Oct/14\n\n@Arch that's a great picture, you can tell sinatra was not wearing any lifts there. Big height difference. Throughout his career Harvey was accused of being very mechanical in his performances without showing any emotion. However, his approach was perfect in \"The Manchurian Candidate\".\n\nArch Stanton said on 4/Oct/14\n\nClick Here Looking all of 6'1 here with a liftless Sinatra, even imagining Sinatra stood his best."
