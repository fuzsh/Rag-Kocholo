        "text": "Tall, reedy, thin-browed, light-haired British award-winning theatre actress Margaret Leighton was born in Worchestershire, England, on February 26, 1922, the daughter of a businessman. Expressing an early desire to act, she quit school at age 15 and auditioned and joined Sir Barry Jackson's Birmingham Repertory Theatre. Becoming one of his star students, he hired her as a stage manager and offered her the small role of Dorothy in the stage play Laugh with Me (1938). The play marked her professional stage debut. The play was immediately taken to the BBC-TV (Laugh with Me (1938). During these productive repertory years, she involved herself in the classical plays Chekov, Shakespeare, and Shaw, among others..\n\nIn 1944, Margaret made her London debut at the Old Vic, playing the daughter of the troll king in 'Peer Gynt. Joining the company under the auspices of Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, she earned distinction as a classical stage actress. In 1946, she made her Broadway debut in repertory with productions of Henry IV, Parts I and II (as Lady Percy), Uncle Vanya (as Yelena), and others.\n\nThe opulent actress with strikingly odd, yet fascinating facial features stole more than a few plays and films away from the stars with her stunning portrayals of neurotic, brittle matrons. Her unique brand of sophisticated eccentricity went on to captivate both Broadway and London audiences with her many theatre offerings, particularly her portrayals of Celia Coplestone in The Cocktail Party (1950) and Orinthia in a revival of The Apple Cart (1953). Her New York performance as Mrs. Shankland in Terence Rattigan's drama Separate Tables (1956) earned her a Tony Award. She returned to Broadway in 1959, to play Beatrice in Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing, before returning in 1962 as Hannah in The Night of the Iguana, and earning her second Best Actress Tony. She'd continue to return to Broadway throughout the 1960's with such plays as, The Chinese Prime Minister, Slapstick Tragedy, and the 1967 heralded production of The Little Foxes,first playing Birdie before taking over the role of Regina.\n\nDuring the 1950's and 1960's, Margaret would alternate between working on British and U.S. films. She made her British debut as Catherine Winslow in Rattigan's Der Fall Winslow (1948) starring Robert Donat, then co-starred opposite David Niven in the period biopic Bonnie Prince Charlie (1948). Hitchcock used her next in one of his lesser known romantic crime films Sklavin des Herzens (1949) before entangling herself in a romantic triangle with Celia Johnson and Noël Coward in The Astonished Heart (1950), which was both written and directed by Coward. In the crimer Calling Bulldog Drummond (1951), Margaret plays a Scotland Yard sergeant who pulls the master sleuth (Walter Pidgeon) out of retirement to infiltrate a vicious gang together, while in the mystery crime drama, Ein Montag wie jeder andere (1952), the touching drama The Holly and the Ivy (1952) and the saucy comedy The Passionate Stranger (1957), she reunited with her Old Vic theatre mentor, Ralph Richardson.\n\nMargaret married (1947) and divorced (1955) noted publisher Max Reinhardt (of Reinhardt & Evans), known for his collection of letters and photographs from playwright and novelist George Bernard Shaw. Her second husband would be actor Laurence Harvey who starred in the British crime thriller Vier bleiben auf der Strecke (1954) in which Margaret made a co-starring appearance as his abused wife. They would marry later in 1957.\n\nMargaret earned her first top cinematic billing as Helen Teckman in Der Fall Teckmann (1954) and reunited with David Niven in the military film Major Carrington (1954). Playing a Southern aristocrat in the U.S. filming of William Faulkner's Fluch des Südens (1959) starring Yul Brynner, she followed that in the 1960's with a co-star part opposite Peter Sellers in the comedy Walzer der Toreros (1962) and an all-star American cast headed by Henry Fonda in the potent political drama Der Kandidat (1964). The black comedy Tod in Hollywood (1965) and the dramatic Sieben Frauen (1965), playing one of several ladies in peril at a Chinese mission, followed.\n\nAppearing in TV-movie versions of literary classics including Arms and the Man,As You LIke It. Margaret began to make guest appearances on TV programs, including; Alfred Hitchcock präsentiert (1955),Playhouse 90 (1956), in addition to a recurring role on Stationsarzt Dr. Kildare (1961)\n\nDivorced from Harvey in 1961, Margaret's third and final marriage to actor Michael Wilding in 1964 was an enduring match-up. The couple went on to co-star in the period piece Die große Liebe der Lady Caroline (1972). Other notable screen credits include So etwas lieben die Frauen (1955), Walzer der Toreros (1962), Die Irre von Chaillot (1969) and the made-for-TV, Die großen Erwartungen (1974) as Miss Havisham. Margaret would receive her only Oscar nomination for her support role in Der Mittler (1971), as Julie Christie's manipulative, class-conscious mother.\n\nIn 1971, Margaret was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, but didn't let it slow her down for quite some time. She continued to perform in such films as X, Y und Zee (1972), Die Nelson-Affäre (1973) and the TV horror offering Frankenstein, wie er wirklich war (1973). By 1975, when she was no longer capable of walking, she continued to act giving an over-the-top comic performance in Selbstjustiz (1976). Margaret passed away on 13 January, 1976. Margaret had no children by any of her marriages."
