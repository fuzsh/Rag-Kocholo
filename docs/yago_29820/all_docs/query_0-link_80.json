        "text": "The first of Lugosi's famed \"Monogram Nine\" pictures, and one of the more interesting films he'd ever make in his career. Which isn't too say that it's GOOD you understand; it sure is fascinating, though, mostly for all the wrong reasons but then, it does boast director Joseph H. Lewis, who went on to make Gun Crazy and The Big Combo, and not for nothin', but when you've got The Invisible Ghost on your resume, having Gun Crazy on there too sure doesn't hurt your place in cinema history.\n\nBela is disturbed by the disappearance years ago of his wife, who ran off with some other guy who no doubt wasn't Hungarian. When I say \"disturbed\", I don't mean \"annoyed\" or \"vexed\", I mean, oh, \"unhinged\" and \"demented\". He sets a place for her at the table, has his faithful servant Clarence Muse serve her soup, compliments her on how particularly beautiful she looks on any given occasion, and is quite convinced that some day she'll return. Boy, is HE right, because she's actually living under the garage in a secret room; she'd been in an auto accident that gave her brain damage and she's cared for and fed by gardener Ernie Adams, and why he does that we'll never know, but \"abject stupidity\" is part of the norm with Monogram scripts, so please hush. The plot of the film, such as it is, is that Mrs. Lugosi (played by, of all people, Betty Compson, and if you just said to yourself, \"Surely not the Betty Compson from Docks of New York and the 1930 version of The Spoilers? Not the Betty Compson who was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress? SHE didn't end up on Poverty Row, did she? Please, tell me this is some OTHER Betty Compson! PLEASE TELL ME THAT!\" To which I can only say, \"Life ain't easy, pal, life ain't easy.\" To say that she's the best actor in this film is like getting a blow job in the bathroom of a McDonald's and then announcing you finally had something there you liked.\n\nWell, on THAT possibly inappropriate note, we return to our film and find Betty wandering around the grounds of Manor Lugosi, where her husband occasionally finds her peering in the window, which sets him off into a homicidal rage and he strangles one of the servants. Apparently, this has been going on for YEARS and (a) the police can't figure out who is behind this, and (b) they don't have any trouble whatsoever hiring new servants. Bela also has a daughter, Loretta Young's lookalike sister but not the one that's Sally Blane, no, this lookalike sister is Polly Ann Young, and she's engaged to a nice young man who used to sleep with the household's new maid, and so when she's murdered he's accused, despite the fact that nearly a hundred other servants have been strangled in the same house, and he's executed but his twin brother shows up to woo Polly Ann and figure out who REALLY killed the girl and I TOLD you Monogram pictures were stupid and by the way, both brothers are played by John McGuire and neither of them can act. Neither can Polly Ann or maid Terry Walker or police detective George Pembroke, who apparently was instructed to \"dress like a police detective\" and so wears a trench coat and fedora and chomps on an unlit cigar in every scene he's in, no matter where or what he's doing. Seriously, this is one of the worst-acted films I've ever seen. Clearly, director Lewis was concentrating on other things, because it's terrific to look at, with a lot of unusual shots and camera angles and long takes and weird POVs and stuff like that, way above the Monogram Pictures norm.\n\nAnd then there's that Lugosi fellow.\n\nSee, here's the thing... When that ol' debbil takes him over, he acts like a somnambulist, staggering around the house in a daze, arms outstretched, fingers flexing for a warm throat to crush. Lewis lights him from below, so his face is filled with the shadows of eerie madness. In 1941, in the gloom of a darkened theatre, I'm certain it was most horrifying, and worthy of the good name of Bela Lugosi, Master of Screen Terror. Seriously, it's scary. Um, well, that is to say in 1941 it was. Now? If you don't laugh out loud and think it's one of the stupidest things you've ever seen, it's because you fell asleep during the film, always a possibility with these things. It's a rip-snorter. And only Lugosi can say \"Apple Pie? My! That WILL be a treat!\" and make it sound terrifying. But fret not, there's a lot of million-dollar stupid Monogram dialog in the film for EVERYONE to say.\n\nMillion-dollar stupid Monogram dialog:\n\nCop in trench coat and fedora, chomping on unlit cigar: \"All we want to know is if the fellow's crazy.\"\n\nAged, wise psychiatrist guy: \"That's very easy to determine.\"\n\nRotten actor twin brother man: \"Is it possible, doctor, for a man to be normal, say, for two or three months at a time and then go completely insane for an hour or two?\"\n\nPsychiatrist: \"Yes.

There's also something to be said for letting Bela be Bela; none of this \"bill him prominently but have him play the red-herring butler or groundskeeper who's only in a few scenes\" when Lugosi was at Monogram or PRC, peoples. How many of YOU have got to spend the better part of an hour wandering through a big, dark house with a flashlight under your chin? I mean, in a movie, not in real life.\n\nI always wanted to give a shout out to Clarence Muse, who plays the Negro manservant with dignity and poise and is also one of the best things in the picture. Nice to see a character like this as something other than comic relief.\n\nThe Invisible Ghost is in the public domain, meaning it's on a thousand or so DVDs, but the Roan Group also offers it and they have a nice print of it, not great but nice enough until the Criterion folks finally do something with this film.\n\nThe first of Lugosi's famed \"Monogram Nine\" pictures, and one of the more interesting films he'd ever make in his career.

Gordon, a score by Jack Nietzsche, dancing colossal teenagers, and huge ducks. Donât ask, just snap it up. A Balcony favorite.\n\nVoices (Indicator BD $34.99) 1973 film that sounds a lot like Donât Look Now: strange things occur to a young married couple after their child is drowned.\n\nThis release was a surprise; nobody seemed to be clamoring for a one-off release of a strange hybrid American noir/British social drama, yet here we are.\n\nFate brings together four unlikely heist partners: Laurence Harvey is a war hero who sponges off his wife, a rich artist getting tired of his unfaithfulness; John Ireland is a Yank married to floozy actress Gloria Grahame (that is, a floozy actress portrayed by Miss Grahame, I donât wish to cast aspersions on her personal character); Stanley Baker is a pug whoâs fought his last fight, and when he loses is hand in an accident has no employment or dreams to fall back on; and Richard Basehart is an American businessman who married lovely Joan Collins but canât take her home to the states because of her nasty, domineering mother. Four desperate men and one extremely flimsy Post Office that is getting a $100,000 shipment in small, unmarked bills.\n\nThe film has a lot going for it; we get to know the men and the women in their lives, but basic appreciation for the film is going to rely in great part on the viewerâs tolerance level, since well over an hour of a 101 min. film concerns itself with the setup. Thankfully, the payoff is well worth waiting for: the actual heist is filmed as a masterpiece of action, cinematography, and mood. (And a funny story: the original novel and script called for a bank heist, but the bankers financing the film kiboshed that and so they swapped out a Post Office instead.)\n\nThe four subplots, from most to least interesting: we genuinely like the boxer (British he-man Baker is best remembered, probably, for Zulu) and his wife (Rene Ray) and the sequences with them keep the film moving. Basehart and Collins have little chemistry (and her part is thankless to say the least) but Freda Jackson (Brides of Dracula) practically steals the film as the domineering old monster-in-law. I liked the Ireland-Grahame vignettes because who doesnât want to see Gloria Grahame, and reportedly the scene where she gets âdumpedâ in the film (thatâs all Iâm going to say, no spoilers here) was as big a surprise to her as it is to us. That leaves Laurence Harvey â mastermind of the robbery â and his wife Margaret Leighton, and while they appear to be groomed as the âstarsâ of the film, they're the weak link and the story seems to stop dead whenever itâs their turn to take the screen. This would be a better picture if they could be edited out.\n\nItâs interesting to note that for the U.K. release, about three minutes was removed, not for violence or sex but because the censor thought it went too far in criticizing British post-war life (the quote at the top of this page was excised, for example). Thankfully, this is the full international version without cuts.\n\nMillion-dollar Dialog:\n\nThe boxer, after losing a hand in an accident: âSeems there are plenty of jobs you can do with one hand, but they want two-handed men to do them.â\n\nThe MGM Blu-ray is a rather pedestrian release of the film with some artifacting early on and a 1.33:1 aspect ratio that clears a lot of space over the actorsâ heads. The British Blu-ray of the title contains both cuts of the film and is in 1.66:1 ratio, which looks much better. 1954 was a year when films were frequently offered in both formats to suit theatres that hadnât made the switch to widescreen yet.\n\nThe film is recommended for the cast, for the terrific and superbly atmospheric last three reels, and for an interesting slice of British crime drama history. There are no extras.\n\nDirector Lewis Gilbert would go on to direct three James Bond films, including You Only Live Twice, so thereâs that."
