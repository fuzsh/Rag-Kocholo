        "text": "“He likes women to be a mess…that’s why he’s still with me” Zee Blakeley\n\nAlso known as Zee and Co in America, X, Y & Zee sees Caine star alongside Elizabeth Taylor and Susannah York in a tale of a destructive love triangle.\n\nCaine plays Robert Blakeley, a wealthy architect who is married to Taylor’s Zee. Their marriage is not a happy one as they spend most of their time fighting and abusing each other either physically or mentally and yet still seem to have some sense of affection for each other. Their relationship is complicated further when Robert meets Stella, played by York, and after taking her as his mistress falls in love with her. The film focuses on Zee’s attempts to disrupt her husbands relationship with Stella and his inability to cut his ties with his wife despite the toxic nature of their marriage.\n\nX, Y & Zee is an odd film. At times attempting to be dramatic and at others aiming for a camp humour. It has periods of being highly engaging and then other periods where little seems to happen and the whole thing feels far too long. There are moments of subtlety, but then particularly in the last twenty minutes some plot developments that seem to come absolutely out of nowhere and mean it doesn’t really fit in with the rest of the film. In other words it’s a bit of a mess, but it’s not without its strengths and there are plenty of elements to enjoy.\n\nFirst of all it’s hard not to have some fondness for a film that begins with a long slow-motion sequence of Elizabeth Taylor and Michael Caine playing table tennis. From there they head to the party where they will meet Stella and the next few scenes are typical of the film in that they contain a mixture of the sublime and the ridiculous. The party is hosted by the couples friend Gladys played with delightful eccentricity by Margaret Leighton. She successfully steals every scene she is and the script is at its most dry and witty when giving Leighton her voice. Unfortunately her time on screen is limited with just an all too brief reappearance at another party late in the film. Aside from Gladys we are also introduced to the far less successful character of Gordon, Zee’s gay hairdresser, played by John Standing camping him up to ludicrous proportions. Such is the stereotypical nature of the gay, hairdresser character that it makes John Inman’s Mr Humphries in Are You Being Served look like a subtle, realistic and nuanced take on the life of a gay man in comparison.\n\nThe other great issue with the party scenes is the overly stylised dialogue. That’s not necessarily a problem in itself. Wes Anderson is one of my favourite filmmakers and his dialogue could never be described as gritty or realistic, but it works within the world he creates. It’s a difficult balance to strike though and sometimes in X, Y & Zee it works well, for example when being delivered by Leighton in witty asides, but there are more times during the party where they sit around speaking to each other in a way that nobody ever would in real life that feels like an attempt to be clever just for the sake of being clever. The second major issue with the script in these early stages is the idea that Stella would actually fall for Robert. Caine is such a charming, charismatic actor, but Robert’s delivers some of the cheesiest lines possible as he attempts to seduce Stella and then caps it all with a particularly remarkable moment as she confides in him that her husband has died and he responds “haha that makes you a widow” as if he’s just answered a particularly difficult question on Round Britain Quiz rather than the more normal response of offering some sympathy.\n\nFrom the point that Stella and Robert begin their affair there is relatively little in serious plot development and instead we focus deeper on the relationships of the three characters. Fortunately all three actors deliver performances that just about manage to keep things engaging. Zee is an absolutely bonkers character and Taylor clearly has an absolute ball playing all her eccentricities. It’s a brash, deliberately over-the-top performance, but with enough subtle touches to hint at a vulnerability to the character that just about prevents her becoming a totally one-dimensional monster.\n\nWith Taylor giving such a loud performance it’s a challenge for Caine and York to keep up with her, but both achieve that with quieter, yet interesting takes. Caine has a lovely line in sardonic delivery as he listens wearily to Zee’s stories, particularly her bizarre ramble to Stella about Robert’s love of fish and questions about breastfeeding twins (Taylor says tits a lot more than you would imagine she might). He also comes alive brilliantly in their heated rows as he delivers some genuinely funny put-downs faced with the whirlwind Taylor shouting him down and even doing her own impersonation of Caine’s own vocal stylings. His ability to flip between moments of losing control to quieter moments of reflection has been a strength evident in a number of his previous films and its on show again here, particularly in a later scene with York as he shows a quiet and subtle emotion as they sit together in their new flat. York herself also gives a subtly effective performance that often manages to have a grounding effect of the over-the-top nature of events around her. An example of how the quality of the performances raises the standard of the film significantly comes as Zee visits Stella in her dress-making shop. Both actors are superb in their delivery of little moments that help to give much more depth to their characters. Firstly as Zee looks around the shop, slightly turning her nose up at the surroundings before immediately delivering the line “what a lovely shop.” That’s quickly followed by Stella standing outside the fitting room as Zee changes and waffles on, Stella walks away with her in mid-ramble and turns the music on the radio up to drown her out. Both little moments that are played to perfection by Taylor and York and make-up for some of the less impressive elements of the film.\n\nAll these elements come together to make a rather strange end product. There are moments when the film is genuinely laugh out loud funny, sometimes intentionally and sometimes not (I laughed quite a lot at the ridiculous poshness of Stella’s two children) and there are some interesting elements to the relationship between the characters. Ultimately though there probably isn’t enough there to sustain a whole film and it’s ending is a little unsatisfactory as a crucial element of Stella’s character feeling somewhat tacked on for effect. Fortunately the main cast are all very watchable and just about manage to drag things along. Far from a classic, but a little oddity with enough to enjoy along the way."
