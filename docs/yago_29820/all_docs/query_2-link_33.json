        "text": "(1896–1987). U.S. author Margaret Leighton wrote many books for children, both fiction and nonfiction. Although she wrote on a wide range of topics, many of her books were histories or biographies of famous historical figures.\n\nMargaret Carver, the daughter of a college professor, was born on Dec. 20, 1896, in Oberlin, Ohio. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1918. In 1921 she married James Herbert Leighton; they eventually had four children. After her husband’s death in 1935, Margaret Leighton moved to California and began writing children’s books. Among her many titles are The Secret of the Old House (1941), The Singing Cave (1945), The Story of Florence Nightingale (1952), Comanche of the Seventh (1957), and The Other Island (1971). She received the Dorothy Canfield Fisher Memorial Children’s Book Award in 1958 for Comanche of the Seventh. Leighton died on June 19, 1987, in Santa Monica, Calif."
