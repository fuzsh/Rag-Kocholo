        "text": "The vision, mission, purpose behind presenting this photo Journal, is to acknowledge and honor my dearly departed Mother, Nora Harvey also known affectionatly to those who knew her as GOLDIE.\n\nAs one of my favourite authors profoundly stated ...\n\n“If woman are allowed the freedom to grow to their full potential, there will be many, many women enlightened; many, many women mystics, poets, painters, healers, And they will enhance not only the woman’s part of the world – because the world is one – they will enhance the whole world. They will give man also new dimensions because their ways of seeing things are different. Man looks at things in one way; the woman looks from a different perspective. Life will become richer.\"\n\nOSHO\n\nMy greatest blessing in this life has undoubtably having been born to the most devoted, nurturing, compassionate loving parents a human could possibly wish for. My Mother was a beautiful soul, and hand in hand with my dear Father they created a beautiful home for my younger brother and I to grow up in, from where we would learn how to love by their example. I will forever consider them to be my guardian angels. My Mother was a quiet soft spoken woman, but in truth she was a “Silent Warrior”. The oldest of five siblings my Mother embodied the matriarchal figure of the family. Her nickname to all those that knew her was “Goldie” which her father gave her as a child because of her golden locks, in truth it was a more a description of her loving heart. Everyone who knew my Mother loved and deeply respected her. When my Mother transitioned, I felt a calling to honor her memory. Although I never had a sister, I have always been surrounded by incredible Women throughout my life, many of whom became my soul sisters over the years. This photo Journal, “Women of Wonder”, is a salute to all the amazing women I have crossed paths with and dedicated as a tribute to my Mother “Goldie\" ... to whom along with her sisters I give all the credit for teaching me how to respect and value Women.\n\nI love you Mum, may you soar the heavens, your forever grateful, loving son…Stephen\n\nMy Mother was an artist ...\n\nnot a painter, not a musician, not a poet, not an actor, not a sculptor, in fact, notwhat people would term an artist in the conventional sense\n\nNonetheless My Mother was an artist ...\n\nMy Mothers Artistry was in another dimension, an arena that has throughout the ages been so overlooked, more often under appreciated, without the adulation, praise and glory typically bestowed upon the exceptionally gifted artists in our midst.\n\nNevertheless My Mother was an exceptional artist …\n\nMy Mothers canvas was our home, My Mothers palette was her creativity, My mothers melodies, her song, were to be found in her cooking, her style, her grace.\n\nMy Mother sculptured a beautiful life with her energy, her tenderness, her teachings, the way she cared for her children, the way she loved, and partnered my Father, The way she sprinkled her magic around the house, her presence, her essence, her divinity, her unconditional love.\n\nMy Mother taught me the greatest lessons in life. Along with my Father, she taught me how to love, how to be kind, how to be gentle, how to have faith and compassion.\n\nMy Mother was a Woman of Wonder.\n\nUpon My Mothers passing I felt a deep calling to create some form of art to honor her memory. As I paused to reflect my life, I realized I had always been surrounded by the most amazing Women ...my romances, the surrogate sisters, and even mother figures in my life, have all played a major part in my evolution. So began a journey to create a photo journal and documentary dedicated to my Mother and all the amazing Women that have touched my life.\n\nFrom the first interviews I filmed, I felt my heart blown open, and I knew I was in divine alignment with my souls purpose.\n\nIt has been a great honor and privilege, and it is with great reverence that I humbly present these stories to honor of all the great archetypal Mothers and unsung Women heroes of the world, and in loving memory and deep gratitude for my own personal Woman of Wonder, Nora Harvey.\n\nSharron Rose, M.A. Ed., is a true renaissance woman.

She began acting at age 14 with a Golden Globe–nominated breakout role in Lipstick (1976), and received Academy and BAFTA Award nominations for her performance in Woody Allen's Manhattan (1979).\n\nShe is also known for her leading roles in Personal Best (1982) and Star 80 (1983), as well as in the TV series Civil Wars, for which she received a Golden Globe nomination. Amid mental health struggles, Hemingway's career dwindled in the 1990s. She has starred in and co-produced videos about yoga and holistic living. She published a yoga memoir, Finding My Balance, in 2002, and another more general one, Out Came the Sun, in 2015.\n\nHemingway's first role was with her real-life sister Margaux (also in her debut role) in the film Lipstick (1976), in which they played sisters. She received notice for her acting and was nominated as \"Best Newcomer\" for the Golden Globe Award that year. Her highest-profile role came with her role in Woody Allen's Manhattan(1979), a romantic comedy in which she plays Tracy, a high school student and Allen's lover. Just 16 during filming (in the film she is said to be 17), she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress.\n\nIn her memoir, Out Came The Sun (2015), Hemingway alleged that Allen attempted to begin a sexual relationship with her shortly after filming was completed, when she had turned 18. Hemingway declined his advances.\n\nIn Personal Best (1982), she played a bisexual track-and-field athlete in a film noted for its lesbian love scenes. In connection with Personal Best, she appeared in a nude pictorial in the April 1982 issue of Playboy and was on the cover.\n\nShe starred as Dorothy Stratten in Star 80 (1983), a film about the Playboy model's life and murder.

She quit the series, which only lasted eight more episodes before being canceled. In 1996, she had a leading role in the British TV movie September, playing the wife of Michael York.\n\nShe has played a lesbian or bisexual woman in several films and television shows, including Personal Best, The Sex Monster, In Her Line of Fire, and episodes of the TV series Roseanne (\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\" and \"December Bride\") and Crossing Jordan.
