        "text": "THE RACHEL MADDOW SHOW\n\nJanuary 3, 2013\n\nGuests: Adam Eisgrau, Jeh Johnson\n\nRACHEL MADDOW, HOST: Good evening, Ed. Thank you, my friend.\n\nAppreciate it.\n\nThanks to you at home for joining us tonight as well.\n\nWhen John Boehner first became speaker after the 2010 elections, the\n\nRepublicans stormed up to Capitol Hill and announced - remember this -- a\n\nwhole new set of rules for the House.\n\nCongress was not just changing the party in charge. They weren`t just\n\nchanging leadership. They said they were going to change Congress entirely\n\nas an institution. They were just not going to do things the same way\n\nanymore.\n\nTheir most substantive new rule was that no longer would it be\n\npossible to pass legislation that cost money without also passing something\n\nto pay for the cost of that other thing. That was their first big\n\nsubstantive new rule. You can`t cost the country money without coming up\n\nwith some way to pay for it. You can`t just lard stuff onto the deficit --\n\nfirst new rule.\n\nAnd for the first bill that they themselves introduced, they had to\n\nsuspend that new rule. Their first bill was to repeal Obamacare. Look,\n\nthe actual name of the act was \"To Repeal the Job-Killing Health Care Law.\"\n\nBut Republicans knew that doing that would actually make the deficit worse,\n\n$145 billion worse, according to the non-partisan Congressional Budget\n\nOffice, who had written a letter to John Boehner explaining just that to\n\nhim.\n\nSo they knew that this thing was going to cost money, but for\n\npolitical reasons, they did not like to admit that repealing Obama care\n\nwould cost money, and so right after they made a big show of instituting\n\ntheir new rule, they then immediately had to say they were not going to\n\napply their new rule to their very first bill.\n\nThat should have been a sign for how things were going to go.\n\nNow, today in the final act of that session of Congress, John Boehner\n\nand his Republicans had to do it again. Another one of their rules that\n\nthey put on themselves said they had to put legislation online for three\n\ndays before it got passed. They did not do that with their last bill, with\n\nthe fiscal cliff thing. So for their first act and for their last act they\n\nhad to suspend their own rules that they made for themselves to govern\n\ntheir own behavior.\n\nAnd that is why there is a John Boehner is bad at his job hypothesis.\n\nI mean, in the House there are no minority rights, right? Unlike the\n\nSenate, if you`re in the majority in the House, you rule. You get to run\n\nthings exactly the way you want to.\n\nAnd it is fine to write yourself a whole bunch of new high-profile,\n\nhigh-minded rules about how you`re going to conduct yourself in the House.\n\nBut if you do that, you then kind of have to conduct yourself by those\n\nrules, right? They`re your own rules. Don`t write them for yourself if\n\nyou have to break them immediately and then constantly the whole time\n\nyou`re ruling.\n\nBut that`s what John Boehner did when he took over as speaker. And\n\ntoday, John Boehner proclaimed a whole new set of rules that might govern\n\nhis behavior this time around -- or might not. Who knows?\n\nAnd the reason he got to do that again is because the Republicans\n\npicked him again to be their speaker. To be fair, they also picked Eric\n\nCantor. They also picked Allen West, who isn`t even a member of Congress\n\nanymore. They also picked Raul Labrador. They also picked a congressman\n\nnamed Justin Amash. They also picked a man named Jim Jordan. They also\n\npicked the former comptroller general, David Walker.\n\nAnd even beyond that, a few Republicans on Capitol Hill today just sat\n\nthere stonily and refused to pick anyone.\n\nBut in the end, John Boehner did need 214 votes from Republicans to\n\nkeep him in place as speaker and he did get 220 votes. So by that squeaker\n\nof a six-vote margin, the \"John Boehner is bad at his job\" hypothesis earns\n\nanother two-year Congress worth of rigorous in the field testing.\n\nWhen the new John Boehner Congress took over today and the old John\n\nBoehner Congress ended, that was our last chance to say good-bye to a\n\nCongress that got less done than any other Congress in American history,\n\none that saw public support for Congress drop to the lowest level ever\n\nrecorded in the history of modern polling.\n\nAnd it meant the end of the congressional line for a lot of very well-\n\nknown, famous and sometimes infamous members of Congress.\n\nEither because they were defeated or because they left on their own\n\nterms, we can now say goodbye to Congressman Ron Paul. And Senator Jim\n\nDeMint. And the aforementioned Allen West.\n\nAnd another high-profile Tea Party guy, Joe Walsh. And Senator \"not\n\nintended to be a factual statement\" Jon Kyl. And Joementum himself, Joe\n\nLieberman. And Todd \"legitimate rape\" Akin. And Roscoe \"legitimate rape\"\n\nBartlett.\n\nAnd Jean Schmidt, seen in this cell phone video screaming and weeping\n\nwith joy at her own misunderstanding that the Supreme Court had overturned\n\nObamacare when in fact the court had done the opposite. Still she was very\n\nexcited.\n\nWe say goodbye also today to Ben Quayle, son of Vice President Dan\n\nQuayle, who came to Washington for his one term in office saying he was\n\ngoing to kick the hell out of the place.\n\nGoodbye also to Dan Burton, who once shot a pumpkin or possibly a\n\ncantaloupe to try to prove that Hillary Clinton murdered Vince Foster.\n\nGoodbye to the husband and wife team of Mary Bono Mack and Connie\n\nMack. They are the first husband and wife team to ever be turfed out of\n\nCongress at the same time. Mazel tov.\n\nGoodbye to Democrat Kathy Hochul who you may remember she won that\n\nbizarre, forever Republican district in Upstate New York after a chaotic\n\nTea Party challenge made the Republicans lose that safe seat for one term,\n\nfor her term, after nobody could come up with a politically satisfactory\n\nexplanation for the hunky, shirtless photos of Republican Congressman\n\nChristopher Lee that turned up on Craigslist and then on Gawker.\n\nGoodbye also to Dennis Kucinich. Every liberal in the country,\n\nincluding this one here personally, will miss you.\n\nGoodbye to Rick Berg and to Shelley Berkley and to Denny Rehberg, all\n\nof whom gave up their House seats to try to win Senate seats that they did\n\nnot end up winning.\n\nGoodbye to Barney Frank, the great Barney Frank.\n\nGood-bye to blue dog Heath Shuler.\n\nGoodbye to Congress`s only self-proclaimed atheist, Pete Stark.\n\nGoodbye to Dick Lugar. Mr. Lugar, I would be please like to do an\n\ninterview with you and I would be grateful if you would consider it,\n\nanywhere, anytime.\n\nGoodbye to Olympia Snowe. Goodbye to Ben Nelson. Goodbye to Jim\n\nWebb.\n\nGoodbye to Scott Brown -- and don`t let the door hit you on the way\n\nout.\n\nThe entire congressional delegation from New Hampshire in the House\n\nand in the Senate, in the new Congress is going to be female. There are\n\nmore female members in the House and Senate than at any time in history in\n\nthe new Congress.\n\nThere is precisely one African-American member of the Senate in the\n\nnew Congress. And he was appointed, not elected to replace Jim DeMint, who\n\nquit his seat unexpectedly without giving anybody any notice.\n\nToday was a day for all change in Washington, the departure of the old\n\nguard and the arrival of the new guard today, including the dramatic and\n\ndifficult and ultimately triumphant return of Illinois Senator Mark Kirk,\n\nwho climbed the steps of the Capitol today to show that he could, after he\n\nsuffered a debilitating stroke a year ago.\n\nThe arrival of new stars like Tammy Duckworth, who beat Joe Walsh.\n\nTammy Duckworth, the Iraq war veteran and Black Hawk pilot who lost both\n\nher legs when she was shot down in the war, and then went on to serve in\n\nthe V.A.\n\nThe departure of the old guard and the arrival of the new guard today.\n\nAnd the inevitably teary convocation of the new Congress by the frequently\n\nteary Speaker John Boehner gave today the air of sort of the first day of\n\nschool up on Capitol Hill.\n\nBut, of course, it`s not really school. And these guys are not kids.\n\nThey are well-paid, sometimes famous adults, and they are there to do a\n\njob.\n\nToday where the first day of school thing was not a metaphor, where it\n\nreally was a school, and a new school at that, and it really was kids on\n\ntheir first day back was in Connecticut, where the kids from Sandy Hook\n\nElementary School went back to school today for the first time since the\n\nmass shooting in Newtown killed 20 first-graders and the principal of the\n\nschool and the school psychologist and a teacher and a special needs\n\nteacher and a substitute teacher and a teacher`s aide and the killer`s\n\nmother, who was the unwitting supplier of the guns that her son used to\n\nkill all those people before he killed them -- before he killed himself.\n\nThe kids of Sandy Hook went back to class today at a neighboring\n\nschool that has been rehabbed to be as much as possible like their old\n\nschool, while their old school stays closed indefinitely because indeed it\n\nis a massive crime scene.\n\nWhen the president released his New Year`s message today, reflecting\n\non having gone over the fiscal cliff with the last Congress and then\n\nclimbing back up onto the cliff again after the fact, when the president\n\nreleased this message yesterday he listed five things that he says are on\n\nhis agenda to get done for the country now that the fiscal fight is at\n\nleast partially over. He listed ending the war in Afghanistan and\n\nimmigration and education reform and climate change and addressing gun\n\nviolence.\n\nAs of yesterday, that is the president`s five-item stated list of\n\npriorities for what he wants to do now in his second term.\n\nThere`s one more thing I want to show you. This is a warehouse filled\n\nwith boxes and boxes of toys and DVDs and other stuff for kids, stuffed\n\nanimals, books, cars, board games. Without context, this is kind of a\n\nlittle kid`s dream, right? More toys than anyone would know what to do\n\nwith.\n\nBut this is in Newtown. This is what has been sent to Newtown from\n\naround the country. Newtown officials say these boxes and boxes and boxes\n\nof gifts have been pouring in from every state in the country.\n\nThey say they are now overwhelmed by the sheer amount. They are\n\ntrying to sort it and trying to figure out what to do with it. They`re\n\nasking people to stop sending things even though it`s understandable why\n\nthey might want to keep sending them.\n\nThey`re looking to redistribute these things to kids somewhere else\n\nwho might be able to use them.\n\nThese piles of things in Newtown are the physical manifestation of\n\nAmericans all across the country and our feelings about what happened in\n\nNewtown, how much we not only hurt for what happened in this latest mass\n\nshooting, but how much we want to do something about it, how much we want\n\nto try to do something in the name of those kids, how much we want to\n\ninflect the future in some way to change it from what it would be if we did\n\nnot react to Newtown.\n\nThese piles and piles and piles of things, these piles of stuff make\n\nmanifest Americans` excruciating need to help try to make this situation\n\nbetter somehow, to respond somehow. Is this the only practical thing we\n\nwill do? Sending this well-meaning, heartbreaking stuff that piles up,\n\nthat we have to hope some other kids somewhere, some other family, some\n\nother town might be able to make use of if we can figure out a way to get\n\nit to them. Will this be the only thing we do? Or will these guys\n\nstarting work today with the nation`s fate in their hands, on the most\n\noptimistic day they will ever have in public service, on the first day of\n\nmetaphorical school for these guys, will these guys be able to do something\n\npractical as well?\n\nThe president says he wants national action to stop gun violence. Can\n\nthis Congress do it? Today is day one.\n\nStay with us. Lots ahead.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: As big deals go, the interview on tonight`s show ranks as a\n\nbig deal for us. He is the man at the center of many of the most vexing\n\ncontroversies in government. And even as the man at the central of that\n\nstorm, he is being hailed as a hero by some as he leaves office. This is\n\nhis first interview since doing so.\n\nHold on. That`s coming up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES: Winding down the war in\n\nAfghanistan in a responsible way, reforming our immigration system and\n\nprotecting our children from gun violence, freeing ourselves from foreign\n\noil and the harmful effects of climate change, reforming our schools and\n\nopening the doors of higher education to more Americans.\n\nIt is not enough for us to say this is too hard, so we`re not going to\n\ntry. So what I intend to do is I will call all the stakeholders together.\n\nI will meet with the Republicans. I will meet with Democrats. I will talk\n\nto anybody.\n\nI think there are a vast majority of responsible gun owners out there\n\nwho recognize that we can`t have a situation in which somebody with, you\n\nknow, severe psychological problems is able to get the kind of high-\n\ncapacity weapons that this individual in Newtown obtained and gunned down\n\nour kids. And yes, it`s going to be hard.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: President Obama talking about ways to respond to gun violence\n\nin this country on \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nJoining us now is Adam Eisgrau, who is the principal staffer who\n\nworked on the assault weapons ban that passed Congress and was signed into\n\nlaw in 1994 and that the George W. Bush administration allowed to expire 10\n\nyears later. Had it still been law, arguably it would have banned the sale\n\nof the weapon used in the murders in Newtown, Connecticut, last month.\n\nMr. Eisgrau, thank you very much for your time tonight. It`s nice to\n\nhave you here.\n\nADAM EISGRAU, HELPED WROTE 1994 ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN: Delighted to be\n\nhere, Rachel.\n\nMADDOW: President Obama has said to reforming gun policy, trying to\n\ndo something to stop gun violence is one of his top goals in his second\n\nterm. He`s tasked Vice President Biden with coming up with some policy\n\nproposals.\n\nFrom where you have been and what you have done in practical terms,\n\nwhere do you think they should start?\n\nEISGRAU: I think they should start exactly where they did, Rachel.\n\nThe president and the vice president have articulated the need to be\n\ncomprehensive in their approach. I think that gun advocates, or gun\n\ncontrol advocates -- a term we ought to take out of circulation, by the way\n\n-- have in the past some time ago overemphasized the importance of dealing\n\njust with firearms. And to the extent the president is talking about this\n\nholistically and Vice President Biden intends to deal with it that way\n\nthrough the task force, that`s the right initial approach.\n\nMADDOW: You feel like approaching this with the sort of commission on\n\nmass violence or some sort of approach toward studying mass violence in the\n\nUnited States rather than talking about guns in isolation is the way to\n\nmove forward? Is that what you`re saying?\n\nEISGRAU: Well, I`m not a social scientist and a scholar of the\n\nliterature, but I am aware that there is already a lot of research out\n\nthere that can be drawn upon to draw up sound legislative proposals. And,\n\nobviously, access to weapons and certain kinds of weapons that I imagine\n\nwe`ll talk about is part of the picture. Certainly, it`s just part.\n\nThe other significant part where guns do come into play is not making\n\nit about the weapons themselves. We really need to involve people who use\n\nfirearms recreationally in the conversation to mobilize their sense of\n\noutrage, along with non-gun owners at what happened in Newtown. I think\n\nthat`s the key to going forward.\n\nMADDOW: Do you have any practical ideas for what that might look\n\nlike? I mean, I feel like the gun owners that I know, and I know a lot of\n\ngun owners, particularly since I moved to rural western Massachusetts about\n\n13 years ago, I know a lot of people for whom guns are part of their daily\n\nlife. It`s part of rural America, no matter where you live in a red state\n\nor a blue state.\n\nI feel like all the gun owners I know have pretty much the same\n\nfeelings about Newtown and about the gun violence in our country than the\n\nnon-gun owners that I know have.\n\nHow do you end up channeling respect for gun ownership into policy\n\nthat meaningfully responds to what people do with guns when they misuse\n\nthem?\n\nEISGRAU: Well, I think you put your policy money where your mouth is.\n\nYou know, it`s great to have, I can imagine, skeptical folks on the other\n\nside of this issue saying it`s great to make these grand pronouncements.\n\nBut what are you going to do about it?\n\nWell, when Senator Feinstein authored the 1994 assault weapons ban, it\n\nwas called the Public Safety and Recreational Firearms Use Protection Act.\n\nAnd that wasn`t baloney or an inside joke. The law not only banned the\n\nkinds of guns that you might imagine it would and that it may well again if\n\nher new legislation can be brought before the president, but it also\n\nexpressly protected hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of popular\n\nrecreational and hunting weapons by name and by law right in the statute.\n\nSenator Feinstein I know intends to include a similar provision in\n\nlegislation that she`s going to introduce sometime in January is her\n\nprojection publicly. Information about that bill, by the way, is available\n\npublicly on her Web site as well. I no longer work for the senator, but I\n\nthink that`s exactly the right idea.\n\nAnd I think it needs to go further. As I`ve indicated in an op-ed\n\nthat I was privileged to have published today, we need other kinds of\n\nproposals that deal with frustrations of gun owners that could conceivably\n\nkeep them away from the public policy debate or put them on the wrong side\n\n-- frustrations with unnecessarily long registration paperwork,\n\nfrustrations with trying to take a lawfully owned gun across state lines\n\nsafely, locked in the trunk of a car, for example, in a kid-proof case.\n\nThese are the good faith, meaningful proposals that can be made that\n\ncan demonstrate to people who own firearms that we are all on the same side\n\nof the issue. We all love children and we all hate and abhor what happened\n\nin Newtown.\n\nMADDOW: The introduction of that legislation by Senator Feinstein,\n\nshe`s promised it right at the beginning of the session. There was also\n\nsome legislation introduced today on the House side, the publication in\n\n\"The New York Times\" today of your op-ed, and that conversation about what\n\nto practically do rather than just remarking on the outrage and remarking\n\nthe difficulty of the politics I think is a sign that we are going to get\n\nsomething done. It feels to me like -- it feels to me like if something\n\ncan happen in 1994 something could happen now.\n\nAdam Eisgrau, former counsel for Senator Feinstein`s Senate Judiciary\n\nCommittee when that happened -- Mr. Eisgrau, thank you for joining us\n\ntonight. I appreciate it.\n\nEISGRAU: Thank you for having me.\n\nMADDOW: All right. As a person who in the past has been fooled\n\npublicly by really good political satire, tonight I am empathetically\n\nfeeling the pain of an NPR station in the Pacific Northwest.\n\nMany of us have been there. They have been there this week, for a\n\nvery good reason. They got taken by fantastic satire for a reason that\n\ntotally makes sense. That`s coming up.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: There are certain interviews that I get to do on this show\n\nthat I look forward to for weeks. I call them my blue moon interviews.\n\nTonight, we have one of those.\n\nThis time the guest has firsthand knowledge and understanding of\n\ncritical and current American policies, including policies that a lot of\n\nliberals like me really like and policies that liberals like me really do\n\nnot like. He knows and understands these policies because in many cases he\n\nhas participated in their justification and in their implementation. He\n\nhas been right at the center of all of it.\n\nOur guest tonight is Jeh Johnson, who`s just completed his service as\n\ngeneral counsel to the Department of Defense, the Pentagon`s top lawyer in\n\nhis first TV interview since leaving office.\n\nThat`s the interview tonight, and that is next.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: In 1942 and 1943 in World War II, one of the places the Axis\n\nand the Allies really fought it out was in Tunisia, North Africa. The Axis\n\npowers, the Germans and Italians there, they started off looking like they\n\nwere probably going to win in Tunisia, but they ended up losing badly.\n\nIt took about six months. It took hundreds of thousands of men being\n\nkilled. But the ending was decisive. The Germans and the Italians got\n\nrouted in Tunisia. And hundreds of thousands of German and Italian\n\nsoldiers surrendered and were taken prisoner. And that`s how it works,\n\nright?\n\nSo, either if you did not get killed in battle, losing often meant\n\nthat you got taken prisoner. It was the Germans and the Italians who lost\n\nthat giant battle in North Africa in 1943. The side that won, the Allied\n\nforces in that battle, were from a bunch of different countries, including\n\nus, the United States.\n\nAnd when it came time to take those hundreds of thousands of German\n\nand Italian prisoners after that battle was won, it was the United States\n\nwho took many of them. The U.S. took as prisoners hundreds of thousands of\n\nGerman soldiers during the course of World War II. Also Italians and\n\nJapanese soldiers but mostly Germans.\n\nWe took them prisoner in the United States. Something like 45 or 46\n\nU.S. states had POW camps during World War II. More than 500 camps here in\n\nthe United States, where we kept Germans. Not because these were Germans\n\nwho were accused of any specific crime but just because they were soldiers\n\nfor the other side in a war and we did not want them to go back to rejoin\n\nthe fight against us.\n\nWe held them inside the United States in POW camps until the war was\n\nover. And then for a little bit longer.\n\nOne of the prisoner of war camps that we maintained during World War\n\nii was here in Deming, New Mexico, down by Las Cruces, pretty close to the\n\nMexican border. Nowadays, the main drag through Deming, New Mexico, where\n\nI-10 cuts through town, is also called Railroad Boulevard.\n\nAnd on 22nd, 1945, that railroad and its proximity to everything in\n\nDeming, New Mexico became very, very important to one German prisoner being\n\nheld in the POW camp in that town. He had calculated the times at which\n\nfreight trains passed by the camp where he was being held. Knowing the\n\ntrain would come, he waited until just the right time.\n\nHe crawled under two gates, and right when he knew that freight train\n\nwas going to come rolling down what is now Railroad Boulevard in Deming,\n\nNew Mexico he jumped on the freight train. He escaped.\n\nHe escaped the German prisoner of war camp in New Mexico September of\n\n1945. And he then poofed. He disappeared in America for 40 years.\n\nHe finally, in 1985, 40 years later, he finally decided it was safe to\n\ncome out and turn himself in -- to Bryant Gumbel on \"The Today Show.\"\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBRYANT GUMBEL, THE TODAY SHOW: On Wednesday, nearly 40 years to the\n\nday since his escape from Camp Deming in New Mexico, Georg Gaertner, the\n\nlast-known German prisoner of war in the United States, gave himself up to\n\nAmerican authorities, ending four decades of life on the run.\n\nAnd he`s joined us here this morning along with his wife, Jean Whiles,\n\nthe lady who`s been married to Dennis Whiles for the last 21 years. That\n\nwas Georg`s name that he adopted.\n\nGood morning. Thank you for being with us.\n\nGEORG GAERTNER, POW: Good morning, Bryant.\n\nGUMBEL: Why after so long did you decide, OK, I`m coming in?\n\nGAERTNER: That -- I have to give Jean credit for that, because she\n\nfinally got tired of asking me questions about my past without getting any\n\nconcrete answers.\n\nGUMBEL: Yes, you didn`t let her in on it. I mean, you got married in\n\n1964, but you didn`t let her in on it until when?\n\nGAERTNER: Until just a couple years ago.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: And so on and so on. A lot about their marriage.\n\nA couple of interesting things about this. First is that what he did\n\nwith his 40 years as an escaped German World War II POW secretly living as\n\nan American in America is that he became a very accomplished ski bum and\n\nalso a tennis instructor in Hawaii and California and Colorado.\n\nHe even claimed in his book that he is the inventor of the aluminum\n\ntennis racket. So he says. So he says. He invented the aluminum tennis\n\nracket.\n\nHe surrendered to Bryant Gumbel, right? He also earned his way out of\n\nhis accent. But here`s the other interesting thing about him. He escaped\n\nafter World War II was over. His country, Germany, of course, surrendered\n\nin May 1945, but Georg did not escape from his prison camp in New Mexico\n\nuntil September. Not May but September.\n\nWhat was going on at that time is that the U.S. was in the middle of\n\nclosing down its POW camps and sending all these guys back to wherever it\n\nis they came from now that the war was over. They were not going to be\n\ncharged with anything. They weren`t seen as criminals. They were just the\n\nother side in a war. And with the war over, it was time to send them home.\n\nGeorg Gaertner decided to escape then instead of being sent home\n\nbecause he didn`t want to get sent home. Where he was going to be sent\n\nhome to previously had been Germany, but now, it was going to be controlled\n\nby the Soviet Union, he wanted nothing to do with that, so he got himself\n\nout, he got himself on that freight train, and he reinvented himself as an\n\nAmerican for 40 years because he did not want to be sent back at the end of\n\nthe war.\n\nWhen do the people being held prisoner in this war get sent back?\n\nSince he left for vacation in Hawaii, President Obama signed two last\n\nbills from the last Congress. He signed the fiscal cliff bill, of course,\n\nand he signed the defense bill.\n\nAnd when he signed the defense bill, he also issued a signing\n\nstatement complaining about some new restrictions that Congress put in the\n\ndefense bill concerning people who are being held prisoner. He said people\n\nbeing held prisoner in the war in Afghanistan, being held at the mane\n\nprison there called Parwan, the 50 or so people being held there who are\n\nnot Afghan nationals, Congress says they cannot be sent back to whatever\n\ncountry they came from.\n\nThe bill also says that Guantanamo, where there are still dozens of\n\nlow-level prisoners that the military says are cleared for release to their\n\nhome countries, the defense bill passed by Congress says Guantanamo\n\neffectively cannot transfer most of them back home. It also says the\n\nmilitary cannot move anybody at Guantanamo to the United States to face\n\ntrial here or for any other reason.\n\nThe president had threatened to veto the defense bill over that, but\n\nhe did not. He did issue a signing same disagreeing with it, which may\n\ngive him leeway to try to act contrary to what Congress just said in that\n\nbill, but that would probably be a hell of a fight.\n\nWe have always held prisoners in wartime, even ones who have escaped\n\nto fulfill their dream of inventing the aluminum tennis racket.\n\nThe United States has always held prisoners in war time. And\n\nobviously, we have always killed people in war time. That`s not what is\n\nweird now.\n\nWhat is weird now is that we are doing those things right now, this\n\nyear, for 12 years now, as part of a war that we say is a worldwide war in\n\nwhich the only declared combatant country is us.\n\nWe have been at war before as a country. The reason we agonize now,\n\nthe reason we agonize over how we are at war now is because the generally\n\naccepted precepts of war that make us relatively OK with holding prisoners\n\nwithout trial and with killing people without trial, those are precepts\n\nthat also presume that war is a thing that has an end, after which the\n\nprisoners go home and after which we have to arrest people and try them\n\ninstead of just targeting them and shooting them from afar.\n\nWhen does this thing we`re in now end? And if it does not have an\n\nend, and I`m not speaking as a lawyer here, I`m just speaking as a I a\n\ncitizen who feels morally accountable for my country`s actions, if it does\n\nnot have an end, this thing we`re doing now, then morally speaking it does\n\nnot seem like it is a war.\n\nAnd then our country is killing people and locking them up outside the\n\ntraditional judicial system in a way that I think we maybe cannot be\n\nforgiven for.\n\nThe most senior member of the Obama administration who is making the\n\ncase that legally and ethically the war we are in right now must have an\n\nend someday is Jeh Johnson, who until this past week was the top lawyer at\n\nthe Pentagon.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJEH JOHNSON, FORMER PENTAGON GENERAL COUNSEL: Now that efforts by the\n\nU.S. military against al Qaeda are in their 12th year, we must also ask\n\nourselves, how will this conflict end?\n\nI do believe that on the present course there will come a tipping\n\npoint, a tipping point at which so many of the leaders and operatives of al\n\nQaeda and its affiliates have been killed or captured, and the group is no\n\nlonger able to attempt or launch a strategic attack against the United\n\nStates, such that al Qaeda as we know it, the organization that our\n\nCongress authorized the military to pursue in 2001, has been effectively\n\ndestroyed.\n\nAt that point, we must be able to say to ourselves that our efforts\n\nshould no longer be considered a, quote, \"armed conflict\" against al Qaeda\n\nand its associated forces.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: Jeh Johnson has just left the Pentagon after serving there as\n\ngeneral counsel for the president`s first term. He is being discussed now\n\nas a possible second-term attorney general after Eric Holder leaves. He is\n\neven being possibly discussed as a Supreme Court appointment should there\n\nbe a vacancy this term.\n\nHe`s being hailed by civil rights advocates as he leaves office for\n\nhis instrumental role in shepherding through the repeal of \"don`t ask,\n\ndon`t tell.\"\n\nHere tonight for his first interview since leaving the Pentagon is Jeh\n\nJohnson.\n\nMr. Johnson, thank you for being here.\n\nJOHNSON: Happy New Year.\n\nMADDOW: Happy New Year. I warned you that I give long, weird\n\nwindups. I also know that you know that I`m not a lawyer.\n\nJOHNSON: That was creative. Very creative.\n\nMADDOW: That is very diplomatic.\n\nDoes it strike you that I am approaching these questions historically\n\nor ethically from the wrong direction? Is that the right part of history,\n\nthe right type of previous American behavior to consider when asking these\n\nkinds of questions?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, one of the points that I made in the speech that you\n\nreferred to at Oxford was that because we are in an unconventional armed\n\nconflict against an unconventional enemy, a non-state actor, it`s important\n\nto apply conventional legal principles, traditional legal principles, like\n\nsome of the legal principles you referred to earlier.\n\nAnd so, we look to examples set in World War II, for example. And I\n\nreferred to them in my Oxford address. It is the case that after the\n\nconflict against Germany was over, we retained a certain number of POWs\n\npast May 1945, either for trial at Nuremberg or other reasons.\n\nAnd so, at some point, we are going to have to face the question when\n\nthe, quote-unquote, \"armed conflict\" is over, what we are going to do with\n\nGuantanamo detainees who are not being prosecuted in one form or another.\n\nWe have to face that question.\n\nMADDOW: What do you think we are doing as a country now in national\n\nsecurity terms that we will not be doing in a few years or whenever it is\n\nthat we have reached that tipping point that you described in your speech,\n\nthat the war as such, as it is, will have ended, the post-9/11\n\nauthorization for the use of military force will no longer apply? What are\n\nwe doing now that we won`t still be able to do once that authorization\n\ndoesn`t apply anymore?\n\nJOHNSON: Well, the authorization that was passed in 2001 was\n\nbasically authorization for the military to engage in armed conflict.\n\nArmed conflict means that a privileged belligerent, as we refer to a\n\nsoldier or an airman or a sailor or a marine, is authorized to use lethal\n\nforce to capture or kill the enemy.\n\nThe enemy does not necessarily legally need to be an eminent threat to\n\nthe country or be someone in the act of planning a terrorist attack or\n\nsomething. If you see a senior member of al Qaeda in a remote location,\n\nfor example, the military is authorized by that AUMF to take action against\n\nthat person because we consider ourselves in an armed conflict with that\n\nparticular enemy.\n\nOnce that authorization at some point is no longer in effect, we have\n\nto, in my view, revert to the more traditional approaches to\n\ncounterterrorism and law enforcement. And so, it can`t be -- it shouldn`t\n\nbe regarded as a perpetual war without any sort of end. In my view war,\n\narmed conflict must be regarded as finite and an extraordinary state of\n\naffairs.\n\nMADDOW: You -- when you talked about the prospect of reaching that\n\ntipping point, the thing that I think was so notable about it and the\n\nreason it got as much attention as it did is because I don`t think anybody\n\nelse at the echelons of government that you are in has ever tried to warn\n\nus to look for that tipping point. To be on the lookout that it might be\n\neven on the horizon.\n\nHow do you think we will know when we get there? And who has to\n\ncertify that we`re there?\n\nJOHNSON: That`s a good question. And I was first asked this question\n\nin a congressional hearing in 2009. I`d been in office for about six\n\nmonths. And the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Ike\n\nSkelton, asked me in his very courtly Missouri way, \"Mr. Johnson, you`re a\n\nsmart lawyer. When is this war going to end?\"\n\nAnd I have to admit, I didn`t have a good answer for him at that\n\npoint. So it`s a question I`ve been thinking about for a couple of years,\n\nand I received that invitation, and I knew I was getting toward the end of\n\nmy time at the Pentagon, and I said, I want to try to take this on.\n\nAnd I talked to a number of colleagues in the administration who were\n\nfully supportive of thinking about, talking about this issue. And so, it\n\nwas something that I did try to take on. And as you know, it caught a lot\n\nof attention because we hadn`t really talked about this before.\n\nOne of the things that I thought was notable from your lead-in were\n\nthese detainee restrictions that we face every year are things themselves\n\nthat have to be an end at some point. For example, one of the provisions\n\nin this year`s defense authorization bill , which has been there for the\n\nlast year or two, is a requirement the secretary of defense certify that a\n\ndetainee meets certain criteria before we can transfer that person back,\n\neven to his own country, even with the consent of that country, with our\n\nconsent. The secretary of defense has to personally certify things about\n\nthe detainee and about the receiving country that are very, very hard to\n\nmeet.\n\nAnd I think we`ve probably had zero certifications since that has\n\noccurred because the provisions are so onerous. And these are things that\n\nwe just simply cannot continue to have in place. At some point, for\n\nexample, we ought to consider transfers of detainees for strategic reasons,\n\nfor reconciliation, for example, purposes.\n\nAnd so, it will be in our national security interest to transfer\n\nselect members of, say, the Taliban because everyone agrees it should be\n\ndone. And so, these restrictions have to have an end at some point.\n\nMADDOW: Jeh Johnson, can you stay here for just one more moment?\n\nJOHNSON: Yes.\n\nMADDOW: I promise I won`t be quite as weird in the lead-up in the\n\nnext segment. We`ll be right back with Jeh Johnson, former Pentagon\n\ngeneral counsel.\n\nStay with us.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nOBAMA: This is done.\n\n(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: That was the scene when on December 22nd, 2010, President\n\nObama signed into law the repeal of the military`s \"don`t ask, don`t tell\"\n\npolicy.\n\nJeh Johnson, who`s the former general counsel at the Pentagon who was\n\ninstrumental in shepherding through the Pentagon side of the repeal of\n\n\"don`t ask, don`t tell\", is still here. Thanks for staying with us.\n\nYou are a Democrat, I`m guessing.\n\nJOHNSON: Yes.\n\nMADDOW: You have been involved in Democratic politics. You advised\n\nthe presidential campaign of President Obama in 2008, John Kerry in 2004.\n\nJOHNSON: Yes.\n\nMADDOW: When you were asked by the president to serve as general\n\ncounsel at the Pentagon, did you know that would entail the intensive work\n\nyou did on \"don`t ask, don`t tell\"?\n\nJOHNSON: No. This was something I knew the president in the campaign\n\nhad pledged to seek repeal of in collaboration with the military and with\n\nCongress, with careful consideration. Basically, we didn`t want to get too\n\ninvolved in the issue too early in 2009. And in the beginning of 2010,\n\nSecretary Gates asked me if I would co-chair the working group that would\n\nstudy the risk of repeal of \"don`t ask, don`t tell\" over a period of ten\n\nmonths, which would then happen to land in the middle of the lame duck\n\nsession of Congress two years ago.\n\nAnd so, we undertook that study in February 2010. General Carter Ham,\n\nwho was then general commander of U.S. Army Europe, who happened to have\n\nbeen a great co-chair, a great selection for this assignment. And we had\n\nthis remarkable basically U.S. military-wide conversation about whether\n\nthis law could be repealed in 2010, 2011.\n\nWe had a survey of 400,000 servicemembers, 150,000 spouses. Carter\n\nHam and I basically went to something like 95 different military\n\ninstallations. We had these large group sessions. Many of them we did\n\nourselves.\n\nAnd we basically had a conversation with the entire U.S. military\n\nabout this issue and about this law. We learned some very interesting\n\nthings.\n\nMADDOW: When you surveyed members of the military on this, I know\n\nthat in the Marine Corps, survey respondents from the Marine Corps, the\n\nmajority of them said, actually, it is going to be a problem to repeal\n\ndon`t ask don`t tell, we anticipate that this is not going to go --\n\nJOHNSON: Well. That`s interesting.\n\nWar fighting units, the Marine Corps, they all predicted horrible\n\nthings if the law were repealed. However, we found that when they asked\n\npeople about the actual experience of serving in the unit with somebody\n\nthey believe to be gay, in year 2010, most servicemembers recognize, even\n\nwith \"don`t ask, don`t tell\" in place, that they were in a unit with\n\nsomeone who was gay. They recognized that. And when we asked them how is\n\nthe experience, even in war-fighting units, they rated the unit`s ability\n\nto perform to get its job done very high in like the 85 to 90 percent\n\nrange.\n\nSo, when you focused people on the reality rather than the perception\n\nor the stereotype of what it would be like to serve with someone who was\n\nopenly gay, and experience was almost always positive, even in those Marine\n\nCorps where they have the experience. It was always very positive.\n\nMADDOW: Do you feel that the repeal has gone as smoothly as it seems\n\nto have gone? I mean, you have direct experience in terms of what the\n\nPentagon knows as of a couple of weeks ago. The -- I know that there was\n\nsome consternation that people who served before \"don`t ask, don`t tell\"\n\nwas repealed and who were kicked out have not necessarily gotten back in,\n\nin large numbers. That`s the only thing that I know that people are\n\ncomplaining about in terms of the implementation of it.\n\nHow do you see the implementations have been going?\n\nJOHNSON: I think it`s actually gone smoother than even General Ham\n\nand I predicted. And I think is a testament to the strength of the U.S.\n\nmilitary, the leadership of the U.S. military that got behind this change\n\nand let the force know that they were behind this change, and it`s a\n\ntestament to what we heard a lot in the study face which is that\n\npredictions of change, predictions of what human behavior will be like if\n\nyou bring about change are always better than what people think. In other\n\nwords, people predict these negative horrible things and when it actually\n\nhappens, it goes way better.\n\nMADDOW: They outperform the expectations.\n\nJOHNSON: They outperform the expectations and in the U.S. military in\n\nparticular.\n\nMADDOW: Do you see yourself returning to public service anytime soon?\n\nYour name is being floated for a lot of high profile positions, including\n\npotential if Eric Holders in the second term potentially as attorney\n\ngeneral. You`ve also been discussed even as a Supreme Court nominee. How\n\ndoes any of that strike you?\n\nJOHNSON: This has been -- this last go-around was my third in public\n\nservice. And I intend to rededicate myself to my private law practice here\n\nin New York, and I have two kids in college age, approaching tuition age,\n\nand so I intend to rededicate myself to my private corporate law practice.\n\nMADDOW: Diplomatically put, as always.\n\nJOHNSON: But I`ve had a remarkable run, I must admit.\n\nMADDOW: Yes.\n\nFormer Pentagon general counsel, Jeh Johnson, I should note that upon\n\nthe announcement of your resignation, the group OutServe, which represents\n\ncurrently serving LGBT members of the military put out a statement saying\n\nthat you have earned not only their respect but also a place in history as\n\na warrior for fairness and equality for all Americans.\n\nNot very many people leaving the general counsel job at Pentagon get\n\nthat kind of public attention, let alone the kind of public respect. So,\n\ncongratulations for that.\n\nJOHNSON: Thank you.\n\nMADDOW: It`s good to see you, sir.\n\nJOHNSON: Thank you.\n\nMADDOW: We`ll be right back.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\nMADDOW: OK. Take a listen to this audio recording already in\n\nprogress.\n\n(BEGIN AUDIO CLIP)\n\nCAPT. PAUL MEHLER: As we flew along the shoreline we did see four\n\nlifeboats that we believe to be from the Kulluk. All right? In addition,\n\nthere was some debris in the area but it`s not known if those items were\n\nfrom the Kulluk.\n\n(END AUDIO CLIP)\n\nMADDOW: Have you ever convened a conference call at work to talk\n\nabout some very important thing and then you decided, because it was so\n\nimportant, maybe you should rehearse what you are going to say before the\n\ncall really started. That`s what you were listening to. A conference call\n\nrehearsal or so the participants thought.\n\nLast night, as officials from Shell Oil and the U.S. Coast were\n\npreparing to brief reporters on the Shell Oil rig that ran aground in\n\nAlaska this week, quote, \"a microphone to the room was briefly opened and\n\nany reporter on the line could hear those rehearsal remarks.\"\n\nOne of the reporters on the line was Rich Mauer at \"The Anchorage\n\nDaily News\". When he followed up with Shell about what the heck happened\n\nthere, what was all that about? A Shell official blamed the error on the\n\nteleconference operator, who is person in Australia, which is a nice.\n\nWhat shell revealed in that conference call is that they were finally\n\nable to land a team of experts on their beleaguered drilling rig in order\n\nto assess what kind of damage it has sustained. Shell lost control of this\n\nrig earlier this week. They were forced to evacuate their entire crew off\n\nof it. Ultimately, it slammed into an island off the Alaskan coast, which\n\nis where it is now sitting, along with the 150,000 gallons of fuel and oil.\n\nShell officials say the rig does not appear to be badly damaged. In\n\nterms of those fuel tanks, quote, \"The tanks they looked at were mainly in\n\ntact but they did see one that was sucking and blowing a little bit.\"\n\nSucking and blowing it turns out in this case is not a good thing. It\n\nmeans that there may be a breach of those fuel tanks, somewhere.\n\nThe situation is far from settled tonight. We still don`t know how\n\nthis thing is going to end. It is still very much in process. But this\n\nlatest oil industry accident is, of course, re-igniting a debate in this\n\ncountry over whether or not oil companies have any idea what they are doing\n\nin this kind of a harsh environment. And whether they can therefore be\n\ncounted on to do this sort of drilling safely.\n\nBecause of the history of safety issues here, Shell has been kind of\n\nan easy target for environmental groups. There is in fact an entire spoof\n\nWeb site designed to look like the official Web site that does nothing but\n\nmock the oil company`s poor safety record and its perceived contempt for\n\nMother Nature.\n\nThe true sign of great satire is that it is so close to reality that\n\nit ends up fooling people and score one for the Shell Oil spoof site.\n\nYesterday morning, a local NPR station in Seattle reported something\n\nof that Web site as if it were real. It was a purported Shell spokesman\n\nsaying, quote, \"No one has yet fully determined how to clean up and oil\n\nspill in pack up or broken ice, but that`s exactly a sort of challenge we\n\nlove.\" Not a real spokesman, not a real comment.\n\nNPR, I feel your pain. I have totally fallen for stuff like this,\n\ntoo. It is a credit to how good the satire is that occasionally we all\n\nfall for it. And it is a reflection of how bad things are for Shell right\n\nnow.\n\nA spokesman for the spoof Web site offered this reaction to the\n\n\"Houston Chronicle\" today, \"Shell`s ongoing incompetence has made our\n\nsatire seems plausible.\"\n\nIf you do satire for a living, that sort of result is in some ways a\n\ndream come true. It`s a Holy Grail. It`s also in this case the worst\n\nthing in the world, which is still unfolding before our eyes. We will keep\n\nyou posted on this stranded rig.\n\nNow, it`s time for \"THE LAST WORD WITH LAWRENCE O`DONNELL\".\n\nThanks for being with us tonight. Have a good night.\n\nTHIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT.
