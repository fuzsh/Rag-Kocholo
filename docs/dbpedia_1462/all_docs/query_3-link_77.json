        "text": "She's an idiot! Should have included the PUBLIC OPTION if she was soo worried about rising costs.\n\nHere is what she said:\n\n\"When history calls, history calls,\" she said in announcing her plans after a long recitation of the problems confronting the American healthcare system, including rising costs and the swelling ranks of the uninsured.\n\nSnowe cautioned that she reserves the right to vote against a healthcare bill when it reaches the Senate floor, likely later this month. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) is working to combine the Finance Committee bill with a more liberal bill developed by the Senate Health Committee.\n\n\"My vote today is my vote today,\" Snowe said. \"It doesn't foretell what my vote will be tomorrow.\"\n\nBottomline, she's a waffler. Baucas kissed her and the other republicans fat butts in an attempt to get a bi-partisan bill. In the end, it's a watered down hunk of nothing that will only give Carte Blanche to the insurance companies to charge what they want.\n\nQuite to the contrary, Camp. That's exactly why the Republicans lost. They cut their ties with their conservative base, by acting and spending like drunken Democrats on shore leave. Bush was diaster, McCain was long past his prime. The Republicans lost their way.\n\nBut thanks to the Obama Insanity of going too far Left and spending beyond belief, the American people are beginning to see the diaster looming for the nation. And the truly tragic thing is the Democrats can't see it any more than the Republicans did.\n\nIt has long since ceased being a partisan matter. It is simply a matter of rescuing our republic.\n\nIt has to be the Republicans because a third party wont be able to win."
