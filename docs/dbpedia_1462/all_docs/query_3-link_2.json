        "text": "Our Mission:\n\nThe mission of the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute is to elevate the confidence and aspirations of high school girls by helping them build the leadership, collaboration and problem solving skills needed to become successful in their lives, families, careers and communities.\n\nOur Vision:\n\nThe vision of the Olympia Snowe Women’s Leadership Institute is to be a national model for enabling high school girls to recognize their own gifts and potential to achieve success and become leaders in their chosen endeavors.\n\nOur Program:\n\nThe Olympia Snowe Women's Leadership Institute focuses on high school girls in the 10th, 11th and 12th grades for whom exposure to the range of opportunities and possibilities available to them is intended to build their confidence, raise their aspirations, and enable them to become more successful in their lives and careers. A girl selected to participate in 10th grade, remains in the program for three years.\n\nEach year of the Institute's program is designed to help participants explore their capabilities as well as build the important skills that are essential to sound leadership. The program is delivered through an annual one-day intensive workshop, ongoing monthly, in-school sessions, an online community exclusive to program participants, and one-on-one interaction with women in the Institute’ s networks who have chosen various paths to success.\n\nThe Institute's programming focuses on developing a student’s values, voice, and vision.\n\n10th grade – “My Values:” Exploring what is important to each student and why her values, personal responsibility and integrity are the foundation for how she makes decisions and constructs her life. Students answer the question, “What do I stand for?”\n\n11th grade – ‘My Voice:” Becoming aware of the student’s voice, how to express herself and listen to other’s voices to create meaningful outcomes in any aspect of life. Students answer the question, “How do I get heard?”\n\n12th grade – “My Vision:” With the benefit of examining and using their Values and Voice, students take a look ahead to what is important in their own lives and how they relate to others in every other context - family, workplace and community. Students answer the question, “Where do I want to go?”\n\nAbout Olympia Snowe:\n\nElected to the United States Senate in 1994, Senator Olympia J.

Senator Snowe built a reputation as one of the Congress’ leading centrists, co-chairing the Senate Centrist Coalition from 1999-2006. In 2005, she was named the 54th most powerful woman in the world by Forbes magazine. In 2006 Time Magazine named her one of the top ten U.S. Senators.\n\nSenator Snowe is currently a Senior Fellow at the Bipartisan Policy Center in Washington, D.C., a 501(C)(3) organization, where she is a member of the board and Co-chairs its Commission on Political Reform; and Chairman and CEO of Olympia Snowe, LLC, through which she provides communications and policy advice. Snowe is a member of the Board of Directors of T. Rowe Price Group, Inc. and of Aetna, Inc., as well as a non-voting observer of the Board of Directors of Synchrony Financial. She also serves on a number of other boards including that of the Commission on Presidential Debates, Harvard University’s Institute of Politics, and the National Institute for Civil Discourse.\n\nBorn on February 21, 1947, and orphaned at 9 years old, Senator Snowe attended St. Basil Academy, a Greek Orthodox school in Garrison, New York, and graduated from Edward Little High School in Auburn, Maine. She earned a degree in political science from the University of Maine in 1969 and has received honorary doctorate degrees from Bowdoin College, Bates College, Colby College, University of Maine, University of Delaware, Northeastern University, University of Pennsylvania, and the University of New Hampshire School of Law.
