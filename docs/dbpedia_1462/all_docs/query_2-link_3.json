        "text": "In spite of the Congress being in session through the first day of 2013, all of the major issues facing America have remained unresolved. From overhauling the tax code to health care and entitlement reforms, to spending cuts and the debt reduction, to immigration and gun control, the new Congress will be grappling with monumental and wide-ranging policy challenges in 2013. Meanwhile, American families and businesses continue to confront uncertainty resulting from Washingtons unwillingness to work together to solve major problems. With more than three decades of policy experience and knowing how Washington does and doesn't work, Senator Olympia Snowe has keen and contemporary insights on what Congressional initiatives to look for in the coming year.\n\nSenator Snowe is prepared to discuss the impending debt ceiling debate and lack of permanency and predictability on key issues. She can describe how the Congress is likely to continue lurching from deadline to deadline unless the Senate decides in the next nine months that it will change course from the hyper-partisan lame duck session and return to fulfilling its promise as the institution best positioned to rise to meet our greatest challenges to creating an economic revival.\n\nHow do I book Olympia Snowe to speak at my event?\n\nOur experienced booking agents have successfully helped clients around the world secure speakers like Olympia Snowe for speaking engagements, personal appearances, product endorsements, or corporate entertainment since 2002.
