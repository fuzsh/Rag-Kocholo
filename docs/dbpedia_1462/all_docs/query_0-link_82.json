        "text": "As quoted in \"Can Olympia Snowe Change Washington?\", interview by Kathleen Fleury and Virginia M. Wright, in Downeast magazine (October 2014).\n\nKontext: I understand that the hyper-partisanship in Washington makes people feel alienated. They're frustrated and they're angry, and they should be, but they can do something about it. We've got to turn it around. I'm concerned it's going to become institutionalized. … Make candidates accountable for making government work. That should be a debate question: What are you going to do to make government work? You can't sit on your hands and say, \"No, I want it 100% my way.\" I don't know how this evolved, but I find it irrational — you don't demand that in any other sphere of life. The country is now in a virtual standstill. We can't begin to measure the reverberation of all this legislative neglect five, six, or whatever years into the future.\n\nAs quoted in \"Can Olympia Snowe Change Washington?\", interview by Kathleen Fleury and Virginia M.

We can't begin to measure the reverberation of all this legislative neglect five, six, or whatever years into the future.\n\nAs quoted in \"Andrea Mitchell's exclusive interview with Sen. Olympia Snowe\" by Weesie Vieira (29 February 2012) http://info.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/02/29/10541107-transcript-andrea-mitchells-exclusive-interview-with-sen-olympia-snowe.\n\nKontext: What are our obligations to the country and to the people we represent? It's the coming up with effective solutions, sitting down and working with the issues. Sitting around table and sorting through the differences.\n\nYou can never solve a problem without talking to people with whom you disagree. The United States Senate is predicated and based on consensus building. That was certainly the vision of the founding fathers. And if we abandon that approach, then we do it at the expense of the country and the issues that we need to address to put us back on track.\n\nOfficial statement (28 February 2012) http://www.olympiasnowe.com/, also quoted in \"Snowe to Retire\" at \"The Page\" at TIME.com (28 February 2012) http://thepage.time.com/2012/02/28/snowe-to-retire/.\n\nKontext: I do find it frustrating … that an atmosphere of polarization and \"my way or the highway\" ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions.\n\nWith my Spartan ancestry I am a fighter at heart; and I am well prepared for the electoral battle, so that is not the issue. However, what I have had to consider is how productive an additional term would be. Unfortunately, I do not realistically expect the partisanship of recent years in the Senate to change over the short term. So at this stage of my tenure in public service, I have concluded that I am not prepared to commit myself to an additional six years in the Senate, which is what a fourth term would entail.\n\nAs I enter a new chapter, I see a vital need for the political center in order for our democracy to flourish and to find solutions that unite rather than divide us. It is time for change in the way we govern, and I believe there are unique opportunities to build support for that change from outside the United States Senate. I intend to help give voice to my fellow citizens who believe, as I do, that we must return to an era of civility in government driven by a common purpose to fulfill the promise that is unique to America.\n\nOfficial statement (28 February 2012) http://www.olympiasnowe.com/, also quoted in \"Snowe to Retire\" at \"The Page\" at TIME.com (28 February 2012) http://thepage.time.com/2012/02/28/snowe-to-retire/.\n\nKontext: I do find it frustrating … that an atmosphere of polarization and \"my way or the highway\" ideologies has become pervasive in campaigns and in our governing institutions.\n\nWith my Spartan ancestry I am a fighter at heart; and I am well prepared for the electoral battle, so that is not the issue.
