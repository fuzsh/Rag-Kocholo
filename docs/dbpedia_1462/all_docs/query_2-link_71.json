        "text": "Government funding of the social sciences is a crucial component to the knowledge development and research endeavors of scholars. Often times the critical value of these funds is misunderstood or cheapened as politicians look for ways to cut federal spending without looking like a “bad guy” to their constituents. While we have in our minds the recent congressional attack on the political science department of the National Science Foundation (NSF), other battles for funding have already been lost. In May of 2012, Canada announced an end to a critical source of funding for academics in other countries, the Understanding Canada program. During the last 40 years, this program has been promoting knowledge and interest in Canada around the world.\n\nIt is often difficult to highlight the direct value of academic grants, but easy to point fingers at seemingly expensive programs when cutting discretionary spending is a potentially important political move. During the short debate over the second Flake Amendment, which effectively ended political science spending by the NSF, an opponent to the amendment noted, “You could probably bring a list of studies in front of the Congress from the National Science Foundation and get a laugh on any day. But these studies are important” (Representative Fattah (PA) Reference Fattah2012). The same holds true for the academic grants under the Understanding Canada program, and that is why we must tell their story and explain their value to political science."
