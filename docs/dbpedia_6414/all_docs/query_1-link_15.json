        "text": "The Cinema of the Other Germany\n\nSilke von der Emde, Vassar College, vonderem@vassar.edu\n\nNearly a decade after the fall of the Berlin Wall, films from and about the former GDR are finally becoming available to audiences, students, and researchers in the U.S. DEFA produced over 850 feature films and countless documentaries between 1946-1990, yet East German film culture had remained terra incognita for the Western public during the existence of the GDR. This course examines the successes and failures of some DEFA films as they aspired to be a national cinema in their own right. We will analyze this significant segment of German film history in relation to the development of New (West) German Cinema and think about the exact \"placing\" of GDR cinema within German film history and international debates around national cinema.\n\nThe course is divided into six parts: we will begin with a Wendefilm (films that talk about events leading to the fall of the Wall) and we will discuss the idea of history as melodrama. We will then explore a body of anti-fascist films produced in the GDR. The analysis of these films will help us grasp important motivations and political convictions of many East German directors, such as Wolfgang Staudte, Frank Beyer, and Konrad Wolf. The \"forbidden films\" from 1965/66, which until 1990 have never been seen before, show how advanced\n\nEast German film was already in the early sixties. The analysis of GDR Westerns, the immensely popular series of Indianerfilme, will help us understand the way popular culture worked in East Germany. A number of documentary films will give students a glimpse at everyday life in the GDR while encouraging discussions about the self-representation of artists in the GDR. The last film of the semester will be a comedy by Frank Beyer, one of the last GDR films before the Wall came down in 1989.\n\nThe course aims to examine the films within the larger socio-historical context in Germany. Since this is a culture studies course, we will analyze 20th century German history, politics, and culture by looking at German films. In this course we will talk about the fundamentals of film analysis and contemporary film criticism, so that the formal structures of the films can be understood. By the end of the course, students should be able both to do a \"close reading\" of a film and to place it within the larger historical context defined by the aesthetic and political debates in German society to which the films respond.\n\nRequirements\n\n1. Short film responses to be handed in every Monday.\n\n2. Opening class discussion of film with one or more other students - at least once. You are asked to prepare background information on the film/the filmmaker, talk about important issues the film raises, and prepare questions for the discussion.\n\n3.
