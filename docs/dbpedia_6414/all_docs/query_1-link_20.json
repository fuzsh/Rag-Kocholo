        "text": "Re-Imagining DEFA represents a significant contribution to contemporary DEFA scholarship—the best of which looks beyond the well-worn study of ideology and censorship, discarding assumptions about monolithic, totalitarian structures and instead embracing this cinema as complex cultural production—with an emphasis on breaking open temporal and spatial boundaries. The superb introduction offers an incisive overview of the rapid evolution of DEFA scholarship over the past 25 years, and invites readers to re-imagine DEFA within a much broader framework of both German and global filmmaking histories and traditions. The volume is guided by a set of interrelated research questions, central among them 1) the extent to which GDR film culture is a transnational phenomenon, bound up not only with West German but also other cinemas, and 2) the role of the popular in GDR film culture, including the complex relationship in DEFA to high/low culture debates that have accompanied cinema since its beginnings. In order to illuminate these questions, the fifteen chapters in this well-edited volume are sorted into four sections: institutions and ideology, national and transnational contexts, genre and popular cinema, and DEFA’s legacy. (The volume concludes with a useful and substantial 20-page bibliography.) Like a collage, the pieces often intersect and inform each other in unintended ways, revealing additional potential categories, most notably questions about prestige and audience. In this larger context, the most compelling chapters are those which eschew historical overview in favor of deep dives via case studies.\n\nPart I (Institutions and Ideology) opens with an excellent overview by Rosemary Stott of structural relations in East German cinema production. Stott illuminates unique aspects of technical and financial structures in socialism: thus, film’s categorization as art more than commerce led to the formation of internal “Künstlerische Arbeitsgruppen,” each with a strong artistic director-leader (e.g., Dudow, Maetzig, [End Page 278] Wolf). With a case study of Die Legende von Paul und Paula, she traces the steps in the production process around both budget and message, noting how test screenings revealed diversity of audience responses, raising questions about the limits of state control over aesthetic reception and highlighting the importance of film as communication. Two other chapters—Larson Powell’s periodization of DEFA film music and Annette Dorgerloh’s exploration of set design in early DEFA films—focus less on institutional structures and more on ideological aspects of aesthetics. Both scholars tell a story of belated or interrupted modernism, analyzing the ideological constraints disallowing DEFA artists’ participation in broader (European) developments. Dorgerloh offers an interesting sidebar about the success of modernism in GDR industrial design, i.e., where it is removed from the ideologically charged arena of the fine arts.\n\nPart II (National and Transnational Contexts) moves into the heart of the volume’s concern with the complex interrelations between DEFA and other cinemas, in both the process of filmmaking and the construction of diverse audiences. Several chapters continue the conversation about broad institutional frameworks for filmmaking practices, focusing more sharply on the Cold War dynamics in entertainment cinema. Mariana Ivanova proposes reframing DEFA cinema as a successor institution to UFA, and to Weimar cinema more broadly, pointing to a common drive to create domestic product that articulates a cultural identity distinct from American competition. A path toward this nationalistic goal is found in (European) co-productions, where DEFA shared talent pools with its partners, and traded technical expertise for exotic landscapes. Stefan Soldovieri’s close reading of the East-West German coproduction Spielbank-Affäre (1957) notes the ideological limits of creative collaboration, while Seán Allan dives into the archives to assess the star phenomenon of Dean Reed, his defection from the United States and (willing) instrumentalization by the East German industry. In each case, cultural prestige exists in tension with audience popularity. Studies by Dennis Hanlon and Qinna Shen, on..."
