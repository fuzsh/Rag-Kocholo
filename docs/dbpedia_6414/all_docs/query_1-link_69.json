        "meta_description": "This chapter explores the East German film Fünf Patronenhülsen/Five Cartridges, looking at the way it corresponded with the then-ruling Socialist Unity Party's desire to construct an anti-fascist national heritage, one which valorised the International Brigades as part of the attempt to legitimise the existence of the East German state and its communist leadership, many of whom had fought for the Republic. Although superficially, Five Cartridges appears to be an uncritical homage to the International Brigades, the chapter argues that a tension arises from the complex characterisation of the International Brigade members.",
