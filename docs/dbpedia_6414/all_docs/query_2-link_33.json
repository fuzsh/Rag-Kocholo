        "text": "I find \"Mephisto\" gripping within its context and more gripping without. The story essentially focuses on what anybody could understand: a \"yes\" man dominated by greater powers, political here, while almost willfully deluding himself that he is not.\n\nToday in class for example we ended \"Huck Finn\" -- bear with me -- where after Huck feels pity for the King and the Duke, the cruel scammers who lorded it over him and his slave friend Jim. He sees a crowd tar-and-feather these frauds and he remarks about how cruel humans can be. And then, not long after, he finds himself in the presence of his more powerful friend, Tom Sawyer. The two proceed to be totally cruel to Jim, Huck's good friend.\n\nHow in the world? Well, this movie asks how in the world artists could've worked under a Nazi regime that was clearly exiling and killing their fellow artists. In the movie, the main character finds himself the head of the German National Theatre. Great for him, except his friends start disappearing.\n\nThe performance by Klaus Maria Brandauer is arguably one of the best of the decade. He's playing an actor who play-acts for a living, and yet his social role is one grand play-act. It's an twisted American-dream tale: mediocre middling actor rises up and gets all that he wants, the glory and esteem of others.\n\nOnly those others are the Nazis. All the well-known historical events take place outside the frame, as if we are watching a bit player's experience of the rise of the Nazis. That's a dig at our main character, who aspires to be a star.\n\nThe movie watches rather awesomely to me on the desire for attention, a near-universal one, the desire to be recognized and praised. What would anybody do for that? We know: just go check any social media platform. Only in Hendrik Höfgen's case, he's getting praise from the State.\n\nThe movie is rarely moralistic about his obsequiousness and delusions, which I appreciated. Only in key moments is he called out in the dialogue. Instead -- and this one thing I really love -- the movie contains a dozen or more subtle digs at him *in the editing*. Repeatedly, scenes transition into the following scenes, and those transitions contain dry ridiculous jokes about him, which you wouldn't get if you aren't thinking while watching. I really love movies that reward thinking about them. (I'll have to do a video on this element, it's so striking.)\n\nMost movies have one or two moments where the main character has a key ethical choice. This one must set a record. There have to be forty of those here. As Höfgen chooses to stay in German and assauge the ascendent Nazi powers, he forsakes core relationships, his family, and the key principles of his art. And yet we see him, again and again, rationalize these choices while occasionally announcing his beliefs that the Nazis nurture art. I am not sure I've seen a character depicted like this who is so wonderfully, awfully deluded. In certain moments, he's aware of his delusions, which is even tastier.\n\nThe ending of this movie is just awesome. There could be no better ending for this, leaving everything so that we can not only condemn a Nazi but place quite a lot of the proceedings on our own contexts. You could draw many lessons potentially, and two main ones even are contradictory: that actors should be politically engaged to stop hideous ideologues, or that actors shouldn't be politically engaged because they are often complete fools about political causes. \"Mephisto\" might argue that art and politics shouldn't mix much; it certainly argues, in my view, that the aesthetic sphere and the political spheres are different. In this movie, the latter dominates the other, which is completely out of balance. (Pauline Kael is completely nuts to say that the movie is condemning acting. What a miswatch!)\n\nIn that way, the movie complexly registers in a number of important directions. It works as historical critique, as a challenge to anybody to perceive reality as correctly as one can, and then to act accordingly. Höfgen plays Mephisto and then Hamlet. It's a hoot to here him, in a media address, claim that Hamlet can be interpreted as a vindication of Nazi ideology. He says that it's about \"action vs. inaction.\" Höfgen when he acts is wrong, and when he doesn't act is wrong. There's a tremendous pun there, since he wants to be a good \"actor\" (schauspieler).\n\nNote -- the only way you should watch this is on \"Kino Now\" where they have an awesome looking 4k restoration. I hope they release a 4k version."
