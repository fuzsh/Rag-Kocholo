        "text": "Over the decades, much has been written and revealed about the continuity of economic and political elites in the transition from German fascism to post-war West Germany. To a large degree, common knowledge about this issue has been restricted to the spheres of politics, the judicial system, secret services, the military, and higher education. With regard to cinema, by contrast, such continuity has gone largely unnoticed. The paper analyzes empirically the remarkable post-war continuity of Nazi era film directors. It points to the fact that it was only in exceptional cases that leading Nazi directors did not continue their careers in West Germany. Based on a comprehensive survey, the paper then pursues a comparison between the Federal Republic of Germany's post-war era and post-communist transition after 1989/1990. It shows that the continuity of the Nazi directors in the young Federal Republic of Germany stands in blatant contrast to the handling of the filmmakers of the German Democratic Republic. Just as in reference to the transition of the film industry from the Nazi era to the Federal Republic it is impossible to speak of a break with the past, so also is it impossible to apply the term “re-unification” to the transition of the film industry from the GDR to the “Berlin Republic.” Post-fascist continuity after 1945 is matched by post-communist discontinuity after 1989.\n\nAs German reunification has increased attention to German history and culture, scholarly output devoted to all phases of the history of German film has escalated rapidly. In this, the first of the PERSPECTIVES volumes to treat national cinema, the editors have collected classic and newly commissioned essays and articles that address a wide range of historical issues, including the politics of gender and sexuality; the Holocaust; feminism; and Nazi propaganda films. These discusssions of dramas and documentaries, filmmakers, and aesthetic ideologies cover all aspects of German cinema, from its silent beginnings to the present day. \"Among the recent anthologies on German film, Ginsberg/Thompson's project is by far the most ambitious one, both in size and in scope. In addition to an introduction by the editors, this weighty tome contains forty-three articles/essays, thirty-six of which are reprints. Seven are original contributions. An index has been added: given the size of the anthology, this is an invaluable bonus for the reader...[T]he introduction conveys many valid insights into the present state of German film studies and manages to launch the book on a very promising note...Within these parameters, the individual contributions live up to the editors' promise and offer fresh, often quite original insights...All in all, this is a remarkable anthology: surprisingly cohesive in the face of its diversity of topics/methodologies/strategies and extremely persuasive in arguing the editors' case for a more socially aware, politically 'engaged' re-orientation in German film studies. As a first-class reference work and a showcase of film criticism at its finest, the book deserves a wide readership.\" -- Gerhard P. Knapp (University of Utah), special issue of SEMINAR on \"Recent German Film\"\n\n\"[T]he carefully constructed essays in [this volume] contribute to elevating this reference book so much more than its component parts could have achieved - much like German cinema itself. It is a volume that contributes significantly to reference works on German cinema, European cinema, and cinematic history. Any academic library that has students that might get the merest whiff of cinema as part of their curriculum should ensure this work is available to them.\" -- Matt Borg, Sheffield Hallam University, REFERENCE REVIEWS “A Companion to German Cinema represents the cutting edge of German cinema studies that will force scholars to rethink their approach to the subject. Conceptually innovative and theoretically rigorous, the collection convincingly claims that the renewal of the field must occur from its margins.” -- Roy Grundmann, Boston University “This book is meant to re-envision what has been little seen, unsettle your thinking about German cinema and visual culture, and examine German cinema’s socially transformative potential.” -- Dora Apel, Wayne State University “Combining a path-breaking exploration of German cinema beyond the canon with a serious contribution to theories of nation and transnationalism, this collection is a much-needed addition to European film scholarship.” -- Rosalind Galt, University of Sussex A COMPANION TO GERMAN CINEMA offers a wide-ranging collection of essays demonstrating state-of-play scholarship on German cinema at a time during which cinema studies as well as German cinema have once again begun to flourish. * Offers a careful combination of theoretical rigor, conceptual accessibility, and intellectual inclusiveness * Includes essays by well-known writers as well as up-and-coming scholars who take innovative critical approaches to both time-honored and emergent areas in the field, especially regarding race, gender, sexuality, and (trans)nationalism * Distinctive for its contemporary relevance, reorienting the field to the global twenty-first century * Fills critical gaps in the extant scholarship, opening the field onto new terrains of critical engagement"
