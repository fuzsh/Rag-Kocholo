Those that couldn't afford to buy German cameras directly often made local copies such as the Soviet FED (1934) or various Japanese cameras. These were technically illegal, but ...\n\nLeica copies - Wikipedia\n\nThe war made local copies for military use attractive, and the post-war appropriation of German patents for reparations made it legal. To the victor belong the spoils.\n\nOn the very cusp of the war, Zeiss Ikon had played around with a pentaprism eye-level mirror reflex camera- a mirror reflex Contax. There are \"patent data\" on this one but nothing but mockups were made, apparently. The mirror and prism are integral to the camera body, like the later-war and post-war Contax-S For \"Spiegel 'mirror')\n\nIhagee was not idle either and produced some interchangeable prism attachments for their Exakta waist-level SLR.\n\nHere's one with a viewfinder and light meter in addition to the eye-level prism (in pre-automatic aperture days the prism could be awfully dark).\n\nBoth the Contax and the Exakta were very expensive at first, so a more \"volks\" camera waist-level SLR called \"Praktiflex\" before the war and Praktica afterwards was made by KW. They, too, had a add-on prism available.\n\nLooking through it had a certain \"tunnel\" effect, but it worked if the light was bright.\n\nThis was gradually improved and resulted in the first integrated prism for Praktica -though it stood high like a castle on the Rhein.\n\nPraktica IV variants\n\nAs KW-Praktica developed their cameras it was widely copied even to the M42-mount., often with no acknowledgment at all, especially in Japan,\n\nJes' saying."
