        "text": "When was the last time you were afraid? Really afraid? Brace yourself for the ultimate transplant – the human soul! The devil is in the music in this sleek and scary piece of movie necromancy – when a failed musician-turned-journalist (Alan Alda, M*A*S*H) interviews a reclusive aging pianist (Curt Jurgens, The Enemy Below), he doesn’t realize he’s being interviewed himself… to be the vessel for the Satanist’s dying soul! Back in a youthful body, the pianist plans for a long life in the spotlight, but when the journalist’s wife (Jacqueline Bisset, Bullitt) realizes her husband’s twice the man he used to be, she prepares to make his new life a living Hell! Television veteran Paul Wendkos (Cannon for Cordoba) directs this cult horror classic, based on a novel by Fred Mustard Stewart (The Norliss Tapes) with a screenplay by Ben Maddow (The Asphalt Jungle). The stellar cast includes Barbara Parkins (Valley of the Dolls), Bradford Dillman (Chosen Survivors), Pamelyn Ferdin (The Beguiled), and William Windom (TV’s The Farmer’s Daughter).\n\nAudio Commentary by Film Historian Bill Cooke\n\nAudio Commentary by actress Pamelyn Ferdin, moderated by filmmaker Elijah Drenner\n\nTrailers\n\nTHIS IS A PREORDER DISC THAT IS DUE TO BE RELEASED ON OR ABOUT 4/18/2017\n\nSORRY, BUT WE CANNOT ACCEPT CANCELLATIONS OF PREORDERS\n\nALL DETAILS, INCLUDING RELEASE DATE ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE"
