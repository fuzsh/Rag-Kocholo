        "text": "Dul'Mephistos, the Lord of Hatred, commonly referred to as Mephisto, is one of the three Prime Evils.\n\nBiography[]\n\nThe Great Conflict[]\n\nLike all the Great Evils, Mephisto was born from one of the seven heads of the great dragon Tathamet. His realm in the Burning Hells was the Realm of Hatred, and he watched with joy as its denizens schemed and warred against each other.[2] He, Diablo, and Baal were the three Prime Evils, and from the outset, warred amongst each other to maintain dominion and rule over the legions of the Burning Hells.[3] He acted as the mentor of Belial.[4]\n\nAs with all of demonkind, Mephisto warred against the High Heavens in the Eternal Conflict. However, he preferred to operate from the shadows rather than lead an army in the open.[4]\n\nOne battle bore angels right into the heart of his lair, making an attack against Mephisto himself. One of the angels managed to draw blood, causing it to spill onto the ground. This led to the creation of the Magma Demons, who rose up to defend their master and drove the angels back.[1]\n\nMephisto and his brothers almost achieved victory against the High Heavens at the Fifth Battle of the Diamond Gates. However, confident of victory, the Primes began arguing over who would get the spoils of war, and thus, their attack failed.[5]\n\nThe Sin War[]\n\nWhile leading his forces on the battlefields of Pandemonium, Mephisto noticed that the angels were withdrawing. He ordered his forces to withdraw so he could analyze the situation. Baal, losing patience, stormed the Pandemonium Fortress and discovered that the Worldstone was missing.[6] Thus, the Eternal Conflict ground to a halt. Eventually, tales of demons summoned into a new realm and a new people reached the ears of the Prime Evils. They sensed within humanity the dormant powers of their nephalem forefathers, and thus resolved to corrupt humanity into a weapon to use against the High Heavens. So it was that Mephisto and his brothers cast their influence into mortal minds, spreading their ideas across Sanctuary. Their whispers led to the creation of the Triune, where each Prime Evil took on the role of a seemingly compassionate deity. Mephisto took on the persona of Mefis, Spirit of Love. Their actions were countered by the rogue angel Inarius, who formed the Cathedral of Light to counter their influence. Thus began the Sin War, as the Prime Evils and Inarius secretly vyed for influence over humanity.[2]\n\nThe Sin War ended with a final battle between the forces of Heaven, Hell, and the Edyrem, after which Mephisto met with the Angiris Council. Mephisto offered to let Sanctuary be untouched by either angel or demon to see what the children may yet become on their own for good or ill. It was agreed that Mephisto cast his mark on the ruins of the Cathedral of Light to seal the flux between worlds and in return, Mephisto was given Inarius. It was agreed that humanity be allowed to find its own path, free of the interference from angels and demons.[7]\n\nThe Dark Exile[]\n\nIn the millennia following the Sin War, the Lesser Evils grew discontent, believing that the Prime Evils had forsaken the Eternal Conflict to focus on humanity. The four Lesser Evils rose up against the Primes, and despite the efforts of Mephisto and his brothers, they were cast out of Hell into the mortal realm, in what would become known as the Dark Exile.\n\nThe banishment of the Prime Evils from Hell to the mortal plane also left them incorporeal. In order to acquire a physical form, they required a body for their spirit to possess. Over time their demonic presence twisted the victims human flesh into grotesque simulacrums of their physical form.[8]\n\nIn response to the most evil of beings walking Sanctuary, the Archangel Tyrael rallied several of the disparate Mage Clans into an alliance known as the Horadrim, and gave them the soulstones to bind the Three forever. In truth, this series of events had been masterminded by the Prime Evils. Through the soulstones they would corrupt the Worldstone itself and with it, all of humanity. A new army to be used against the forces of Heaven.[2]\n\nAt some point during the Exile, Mephisto was present in Aranoch. He bound the spirits of demons into the mummies that slept beneath the sands of Lut Gholein, hordes of undead emerging to bring woe to the living.[9]\n\nMephisto was the first of the Three to be captured. During their hunt for him, the Horadrim led an army against his Fortress of Bone, but the common soldiers found themselves hard pressed to advance against the seemingly endless tides of undead that he summoned, and were nearly overwhelmed.[1] Eventually, Mephisto was found in or around one of the urban centers of Kehjistan. The fight cost many innocent lives, but eventually, the Horadrim succeeded in defeating the Lord of Hatred and imprisoning his essence inside the soulstone. It was then entrusted to the Zakarum priests and kept sealed in the Guardian Tower of the Temple of Light in Travincal.[10]\n\nThe Corruption of Zakarum[]\n\nOver the generations, Mephisto was able to corrupt the High Council of Zakarum, and the body became a mockery of its former glory.[10] The first signs of this were as early as the 11th century. Two centuries after this,[11] Mephisto cemented his control over the Church.[12] He had been able to overcome the soulstone enough to have the Zakarum priests to work spells to shatter the soulstone into seven shards, breaking the mystic seal and freeing him.[13] The Que-Hegan Khalim proved immune to his corruption, so Mephisto had the priesthood slay and dismember him. The priest Sankekur became the new Que-Hegan and consequently, Mephisto's embodiment on the mortal plane. The corrupted High Council fashioned the Compelling Orb to control the rest of the Zakarum faithful and used their powers to conceal the lair of their master. Years passed,[10] and eventually, Lazarus was sent west to reawaken Diablo.[2]\n\nThus, Diablo arrived in the form of the Dark Wanderer, with Baal at his side. The two entered the temple's innermost chamber where Mephisto's soulstone was kept, and released him. Mephisto possessed Sankekur (already under Mephisto's control), whose body was twisted to represent Mephisto's hideous visage. After nearly three centuries, the Prime Evils were united. Within the chamber, the Three devised a final stratagem to reclaim the Burning Hells and claim vengeance upon those who overthrew them, along with enslaving humanity to their will. Diablo, assuming his true form, crossed through the Infernal Gate into Hell to rally those still loyal to the Three. Baal began his journey north to corrupt the Worldstone while Mephisto remained behind, bent on destroying anything that could oppose their plan.\n\nIt wasn't long before a group of mortal heroes arrived intent on doing such a thing. In the fevered combat that followed, Mephisto worked diligently to turn his foes' own anger and distrust against them. But despite the long hunt and many hours of battle, the heroes defeated Mephisto and imprisoned his essence within his soulstone. The artifact was later destroyed at the Hellforge, which would, in theory, cast his spirit into some unseen netherworld.[2]\n\nEven after death, Sankekur's corpse still seeped corruption from Mephisto's deep rooted demonic influence, and it was sealed in a chamber at Hawezar by one of the heroes who defeated him.[14]\n\nThe Black Soulstone[]\n\nMephisto's essence ended up in the Black Soulstone, as per the machinations of Adria.[15] He was the fourth and final Great Evil to be marked by her in her preparation for Diablo's return. When she found his soul, Mephisto fought back with a rage that she had not anticipated. More than once, he was able to take control of the witch's mind, and if not for the safeguards Adria had employed in the ritual, she would have been lost. Nevertheless, she succeeded in marking his essence.[16]\n\nMephisto was briefly merged into Diablo as a single Prime Evil,[5] but Diablo was defeated by a new hero and the Great Evils were drawn back into the Black Soulstone, their souls screaming for release.[17] Because of Malthael, the stone was destroyed, and Diablo was freed,[18] still containing Mephisto's essence and those of the other Evils.[19] Eventually however, Mephisto's spirit was able to break free from Diablo, just as all the other Evils.[20]\n\nWhile Mephisto returned to the Burning Hells, a sliver of his essence remained in Sanctuary. This sliver took the form of a Bloodied Wolf.[citation needed]\n\nThe Great Enmity[]\n\nMephisto's demonic influence bubbled up from Hell, causing the formation of the Fields of Hatred,[21] corrupted land that seeped deep hatred into the hearts of men, causing them to turn against each other. Such intense evil permeates those lands that it even causes the eruption of crystalized demonic energy made of hatred itself.\n\nAt some point, Lilith was summoned into Sanctuary by a former Horadrim, Elias.[22] This brought a resurgence to the Cult of Triune, who now worshipped her.[23] Meanwhile, Mephisto's essence remained scattered in Hell. As the Bloodied Wolf, he began following the progress of a wanderer, occasionally protecting them from unseen dangers, unknown to them, as Mephisto saw they had the strength to oppose Lilith.[citation needed]\n\nFinally, his essence began to reform within his temple in the Realm of Hatred. Unfortunately for him, Lilith sensed this, and made efforts to reach him before he fully reforms and then devour him to take his essence. According to Mephisto himself, Elias' meddling with the power at the Temple of the Primes caused imbalance to the realms of Hell; the Vision of Sescheron and its deceased inhabitans ended up in his realm, while in truth they belonged in Baal's domain, not his.\n\nWhen the Wanderer came to a Triune shrine dedicated to him to request his blessings to use against Lilith, the Bloodied Wolf revealed himself to them, and told them his true identity. He agreed to grant them the blessing if they put the renegade souls to rest.[citation needed]\n\nFrom there he continued to help them (dialogues adapting accordingly to what order the player choses to go with the campaign), now without the need to hide himself. He came to an agreement with them; he would lead them to his cathedral where his essence gathered ahead of Lilith. He would help them subdue Lilith after they freed him, after which she would be sealed in a shard of the Worldstone, which had been fashioned into a soulstone. He would keep the soulstone to make sure she didn't return. After that, he would return them to Sanctuary and seal the gates of Hell.[citation needed]\n\nResealed[]\n\nUnfortunately, when the time arrived, the Wanderer was accompanied by Neyrelle, who had the new soulstone in her possession. She recognized the runes on the wolf's head as that of Mephisto, and was aghast when she was told its true identity. She argued that between Lilith and Mephisto, he was the greater threat. The Wanderer decided to leave the final decision to her. Within his temple, Mephisto's essence could be seen as a giant floating sphere of blood; within which a shade of his visage could be glimpsed. Mephisto tried to persuade her again to stick to the agreed plan, but she refused, and stabbed his essence into the new soulstone, thereby sealing him. In the process, Neyrelle was also tainted by his essence.[24]\n\nAfter Lilith was defeated, Neyrelle travelled away, promising to find a way to put an end to the Primes before she is lost. POSSIBLY unknown to her, and unseen to all, Mephisto stalked her in the form of the Bloodied Wolf, watching as she loses a bit of herself with each passing day.[24]\n\nVessel of Hatred[]\n\nStill contained within the soulstone, Neyrelle took Mephisto to Nahantu. With every step she took, Mephisto grew stronger,[25] and he constantly pushed against Neyrelle.[26]\n\nIn-game[]\n\nDiablo II[]\n\n\"Adventurers fighting in the Durance of Hate may have spotted strange, ghost-like creatures. These \"Evil Forces\" guard Mephisto and the Infernal gate to the Pandemonium Fortress. Evil Forces can attack and kill those who dare to stick around after Mephisto's demise. The most skilled and tenacious warriors might be able to kill an Evil Force, however, they will discover that the reward is not worth the effort. Some speculate that Evil Forces have some other purpose such as to reveal the way to a hidden world. However, they are simply mindless pawns of Mephisto, like many of the people of Kurast.\"\n\nMephisto can be found on the third level of the Durance of Hate. However, before geting to him, the have to battle a score of Bloodlords and additional Council Member bosses. Mephisto can be reached either by taking the left or the right way around the pool of blood; both rooms contain a Unique Council Member boss.\n\nMephisto has a range of abilities he will use against the player: several Lightning based skills such as Lightning and Charged Bolt, a Poison Nova spell and several Cold based skills like Frost Nova. Apart from these abilities, Mephisto has an extremely powerful missile attack that looks like a blazing white orb (officially called Skull Missile), that can kill most Mercenary units or minions and take away an enormous chunk out of the player's health. Therefore, it is best to stay close to Mephisto, as he mostly uses this attack when the player is far away. While his melee damage isn't very high, the player's health can drop steadily if Mephisto combines his Poison Nova and Frost Nova skills; having enough Cold Resistance and Lightning Resistance helps mitigate this damage. In Nightmare and Hell difficulties, Mephisto is immune to life and mana leech (unless Life Tap is cast) so it is best to stock on health, mana and rejuvenation potions before battling him.\n\nA viable strategy is to battle Mephisto in one of the rooms on the left or right in order to avoid a trap: in the backroom where Mephisto stands there are restless spirits that sometimes rise up and lash out at players who are in range. These spirits can be killed, but it's very hard to hit them and the experience reward is small and the loot nonexistent, therefore, it's best to avoid them.\n\nThe easiest method to defeat Mephisto is to exploit his AI: the player first draws his attention by approaching slowly, then retreats to the central room that is separated from Mephisto by the pool of blood. Even though he should be perfectly capable of gliding past the pool the same way the player did, his AI, which forces him to only move in the direct direction of the player's position, does not allow him to do this. In this situation, Mephisto will not attack or casts spells (not even his Skull Missile), meaning the player can safely attack with ranged weapons or spells; Mephisto will, however, attack mercenaries and summoned minions that are near him.\n\nWhen Mephisto dies, a volcano erupts from his body; it doesn't do any damage, however. Now that Mephisto is dead, the player can search his room for stashes of gold. Note that he also drops his Soulstone: this item is needed in a quest in Act IV. If the player doesn't pick it up, Deckard Cain will give it later. Once the player approaches the portal, a bridge made of bones and skulls should rise from the pool of blood, allowing the player to cross it, and enter the Infernal Gate to complete Act III.\n\nQuotes[]\n\n\"You're too late!

He later reveals his true identity to them, the wolf being a manifestation of Mephisto's power still residing in Sanctuary, while his true form reforms in the Burning Hells. In the main game, he does not play an antagonistic role, and aids the player character with the goal of defeating Lilith, claiming that \"while they will be enemies in the future, Lilith must be stopped at all costs\".\n\nHis essence resided in the Cathedral of Hatred, the seat of power inside his realm. He is trapped inside a soulstone by Neyrelle, in order to prevent Lilith from absorbing him. Despite Mephisto's essence being now contained in the soulstone, his Herald doesn't disappear. The soulstone is last seen in possession of Neyrelle, who sails to the north, becoming its guardian, while the Bloodied Wolf follows her.\n\nJust before her death, Lilith saw a glimpse of Mephisto in the cathedral, believing that in killing her, humanity was robbed of any chance of victory against her father.\n\nHeroes of the Storm[]\n\nMephisto is a playable ranged assassin hero in Heroes of the Storm, and the second Prime Evil added in the game since Diablo himself.[30] His gameplay revolves around his Trait, Lord of Hatred, which decreases the cooldown of his Basic Abilities each time they deal damage. All his skills are lightning-based, most notably his signature Skull Missile. One of his Heroic Abilities, Consume Souls, is a global attack that hits all opponents in the battlefield, no matter where they are.\n\nPersonality and Traits[]\n\nMany claim that Mephisto is the most intelligent[2] and cunning[31] of the Prime Evils.[2] There are some who believe that if there is truly a leader among the Burning Hells, it is Mephisto.[32] There is certainly evidence that Mephisto himself believes this to be the case, declaring that \"where I am is Hell.\"[31]\n\nForever looking to instigate a skirmish,[33] it is said that Mephisto was most adept at pitting his brothers against each other.[2] While many demon lords rely on force to enact their will, Mephisto relied on manipulation, able to turn neighbor against neighbor for reasons that seem right and good to those who fell victim to his machinations.[16] Diablo and Baal chafed at his manipulations, but more often than not they complied. Deckard Cain speculated that this was because Mephisto provided them with ample opportunities to pursue their ambitions. Perhaps because of this, Mephisto is seen by some to be a unifier and great tactician. It was Mephisto's greatest ambition to pit entire societies against each other, to turn brother against brother, to seed discord and distrust wherever he could.[2] Mephisto shuns companionship, considering it \"a comfort of the wretched.\"[31]\n\nMephisto views hatred as a tool, though one to be wielded with precision.[2] That said, his hatred has a miasmic effect on wherever he goes.[32] By the Reign of Enmity, his hatred was able to 'bubble up' from Hell, corrupting areas of Sanctuary.[21] He loathes all,[2] including the nephalem[34] and humanity (whose suffering is his delight, and whom he considers to be lacking in both physical and mental strength). His hatred even extends so far as to despise Creation itself.[31] However, his greatest hate is reserved for angels. Ergo, the inhabitants of Sanctuary were seen by him as weapons to be forged in his likeness and directed towards the High Heavens.[2] However, Mephisto does appear to have some level of respect for Auriel, considering her aspect (hope) \"the only virtue with purpose,\"[31] and winking at her during the pact struck at the end of the Sin War.[7]\n\nMephisto's influence is so powerful that remnants of his demonic energy can corrupt everything it touches. His former host, Sankekur, had hatred rooted deeply within him even after death, and the mere presence of his foul corpse was enough to corrupt those around him, poisoning with the deepest, blind hatred, turning brother against brother. Such is Mephisto's power that its hatred can even manifest as physical objects and corrupt the soil itself.\n\nMephisto stands at 20 feet (6.1 meters) tall.[10] He possesses \"foul blood\"[1] and his voice itself is painful for mortals to hear (but only witnessed in Marius' case).[35] The undead are the minions of Mephisto.[1] Such was Mephisto's hatred that areas of Sanctuary were tainted by it, compelling mortals to turn upon one another when entering these regions.[21]\n\nLike his brothers, Mephisto, by his nature, is confrontational.[36]\n\nTrivia[]\n\nThis section contains facts and trivia relevant to this article.\n\nMephisto may appear in Diablo Immortal.[37]\n\nIn The Sanctuary Tarot Deck and Guidebook Mephisto represents The Moon card.\n\nMephisto is voiced by Paul Eiding in Diablo II and Heroes of the Storm, and by Steven Jay Blum in Diablo IV.\n\nLauren Bergin of PCGamesN has argued that despite her prominence in the game, Lilith isn't the true villain of Diablo IV, but rather, Mephisto is. She points out that Lilith has small screentime in the game (in comparison to the overall length of its campaign), while Mephisto interacts with the Wanderer far more, and is ultimately pulling the strings.[38]\n\nAppearance[]\n\nMephisto's appearance differs between Diablo II, Diablo II: Resurrected, and Diablo III (and associated artwork, such as that found in Book of Cain). This can be attritutable to either a redesign, or Diablo III showing his true form rather than that of a possessed human in Diablo II. In Resurrected, however, Mephisto's cinematic appearance has been altered, with little of his host to be seen. His appearance is far more demonic, veering towards his appearance in Diablo III.\n\nA third version of Mephisto is seen in Heroes of the Storm, which appears to combine elements of the two designs. Lines from Mephisto in the game indicate that this is an intermediary form (his true form overcoming Sankekur's), hinting that the Diablo III version (and subsequent interpretations) as his true form.\n\nCultural References[]\n\n\"Mephisto\" is a variation of the name Mephistopheles, the devil figure in the Faust legend, often depicted as Lucifer's underling, or an alternative name for Satan or Lucifer himself. It may also be derived from the Hebrew words Mephis (××¤××¥) which means \"Distributor\" and Tophel (×ª×¤×) which means \"Falsehood\". I.e. Distributor of superstitions.\n\n\"Odium\" refers to \"intense hatred or dislike,\" usually directed towards a single individual. \"Odium theologicum\" is a related term that applies to hatred generated by disputes over theology.\n\nVideo[]"
