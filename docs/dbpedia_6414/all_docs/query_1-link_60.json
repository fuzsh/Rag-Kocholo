        "text": "At the end of the Second World War, Germany was divided into four zones of occupation under the control of the United States, Britain, France and the Soviet Union.\n\nBerlin, although located within the Soviet zone, was also split amongst the four powers.\n\nThe American, British and French sectors would form West Berlin and the Soviet sector became East Berlin.\n\nThe division of Germany and the nature of its occupation had been confirmed by the Allied leaders at the Potsdam Conference, held between 17 July and 2 August 1945.\n\nThe relationship between the former wartime Allies, although tense from as early as 1942, became increasingly strained as they struggled to reach agreement on the shape of post-war Europe.\n\nBy 1945, the United States and the Soviet Union had begun to emerge as ideologically opposed 'superpowers', each wanting to exert their influence in the post-war world.\n\nGermany became a focus of Cold War politics and as divisions between East and West became more pronounced, so too did the division of Germany.\n\nIn 1949, Germany formally split into two independent nations: the Federal Republic of Germany (FDR or West Germany), allied to the Western democracies, and the German Democratic Republic (GDR or East Germany), allied to the Soviet Union.\n\nIn 1952, the East German government closed the border with West Germany, but the border between East and West Berlin remained open. East Germans could still escape through the city to the less oppressive and more affluent West.\n\nIn 1961, rumours spread that measures would be introduced to strengthen the border and stop East Germans from leaving for the West.\n\nOn 15 June, East German leader Walter Ulbricht declared that 'no one has the intention of building a wall', but on the night of 12-13 August a wire barrier was constructed around West Berlin.\n\nEstablished crossing points between the Western and Soviet sectors were closed, dividing neighbourhoods and separating families overnight.\n\nFrom this barbed wire barricade, the Wall would eventually develop into a fortified concrete structure encircling West Berlin and isolating it from the surrounding East German territory.\n\nThe Berlin Wall was not one wall, but two. Measuring 155 kilometres (96 miles) long and four metres (13 feet) tall, these walls were separated by a heavily guarded, mined corridor of land known as the 'death strip'.\n\nIt was under the constant surveillance of armed East German border guards who were authorised to shoot anyone attempting to escape into West Berlin.\n\nBy 1989, the Wall was lined with 302 watchtowers\n\nMore than 100 people died trying to cross the Berlin Wall over the course of its 28-year history.\n\nBut the Wall was just one part of the larger 'inner German border' that separated East and West Germany, and hundreds more were killed trying to cross other fortified border points."
