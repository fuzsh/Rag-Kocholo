Mephisto

István Szabó / HU, DE, AT, 1981 / 144 min.

In September, we focus on the rich history of Hungarian cinema. István Szabó’s Mephisto – about an actor rising to the top of his profession under the Nazi regime – won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film. Eye programmer Leo van Hee introduces this classic of Hungarian cinema which has been restored by the Hungarian National Film Archive. Screened in 4K.

Lead actor Klaus Maria Brandauer keeps us riveted to the screen with his portrayal of Hendrik Höfgen. Politically progressive during the Weimar Republic, after Hitler took power this German actor with a provincial background seamlessly switches sides. After playing Mephistopheles in Goethe’s Faust, Höfgen won’t allow anything to jeopardise his newfound success.
