Prayer, good communication and fun as well as dedicated time together for ongoing growth and understanding are all necessary tools.\n\nSt. John’s offers a variety of enrichment events for married couples— some on a regular basis and others occasionally. more\n\nNatural Family Planning\n\nNatural Family Planning (NFP) methods represent authentic family planning. They can be used to both achieve and to postpone a pregnancy. NFP makes use of periodic abstinence from sexual intercourse based upon the observation of the woman’s natural signs of fertility, in order to space births, or to limit the number of children when there is a serious reason to do so… this practice fosters in couples an attitude of respect and wonder in the face of human life, which is sacred. It also fosters profound respect for one’s spouse, which is necessary authentic intimacy.
