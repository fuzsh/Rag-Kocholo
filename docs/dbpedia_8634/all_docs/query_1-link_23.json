        "text": "Every Second Tuesday of the month\n\n10am OLOL Parish Hall\n\nIf you are suffering from the loss of someone you have loved, be it recent or historical, then the Ministry of Consolation may be able to help. There will be no meeting in August but we will return in September.\n\nNext meeting : Tuesday 10 September 2024 from 10.00 - 12 noon\n\n​\n\nNewcomers are welcome to join - but once the group is in session, please do not disturb.\n\nContact Maureen or Mary on rottingdean@abdiocese.org.uk\n\nWith the absence of banks in the village, and COVID handling of money - we have joined the Diocese with the contactless donation system called DONA.\n\nThere is a stand in the porch of Our Lady of Lourdes Church to receive contactless payments. Please use the hand sanitiser before using.\n\nYou can select the amount you wish to donate and simply tap your card for contactless giving.\n\nIf you are able to gift aid - this will take a couple of minutes initially to encode your details (easy to follow prompts) and only has to be set up the once. You are also able to now donate via this link. Thank you very much.\n\n- https://portal.mydona.com/assets/webPay/index.php?cid=287\n\nThank you for considering donating using Gift Aid. If you are a UK tax payer and donate to a charity, the government has a system that allows charities to claim an amount equivalent to the tax that you would have paid on your donation. It doesn't cost you anything and doesn't affect your tax status. The Diocese is a registered charity and Our Lady of Lourdes Church can claim this government funding. For the Parish to be able to claim this, we need to record the amount that has been donated. At the moment you would need to be paying by Standing Order so that we are able to identify and record your donation. (We can record cash donations by completion of a Gift Aid envelope but during Covid19 this is not available). If you are already donating by standing order just complete the Gift Aid form and give it to\n\nFr Benny or the office. Please do this for your Parish, it doesn’t cost you anything more. The Standing Order form and Gift Aid form are below.\n\nThere are different ways you can help support your Parish.\n\nOption 1 Standing Order - A big thank you to everyone who has recently asked to sign up, and for those who continue with their standing order.\n\nPlease click on the links below - either for Our Lady of Lourdes Church or St Patrick's, complete and post to Parish Office, Eastfield, Steyning Road, Rottingdean BN2 7GA or hand to Fr Benny to bring to the office - or set up easily on line with a debit card under Option 3... the JustGiving\n\nGift Aid Declaration\n\nGift Aid Standing order forms for OUR LADY OF LOURDES CHURCH or ST PATRICK'S CHURCH\n\nGift Aid Welcome Letter\n\nOption 2 DONA contactless giving. Please either use the link\n\nhttps://portal.mydona.com/assets/webPay/index.php?cid=287\n\nor use the DONA contactless machine in OLOL Church Porch. It is possible to set up as Gift Aid and only takes a a minute to do so.\n\nOption 3 JustGiving\n\nhttps://abdiocese.churchsuite.com/donate/\n\nPlease follow the guidance below:\n\n1. Under Fund - please select where you would like my donation to go to \"Our Lady of Lourdes, Rottingdean\" or to \"St Patrick's Church, Woodingdean\". This will ensure your donation is allocated to the correct parish.\n\n2. Under Frequency - select if a one off donation, or if you wish to set up a regular donation for your offering.\n\n3. Under card - you will need to enter your card details. Please remember if setting up a monthly offering, you need to keep your card details up to date. Thank you.\n\nYour details will be kept private and confidential. We comply with data protection regulation and the fundraising regulator code of practice. We will never sell your data to third parties. We will use your details to administer your gifts, occasionally send you news on the work of the Church, and give you the opportunity to support appeals. You can read our full privacy policy: https://www.dabnet.org/ContentDocuments/842.pdf\n\nThank you for your generosity of heart."
