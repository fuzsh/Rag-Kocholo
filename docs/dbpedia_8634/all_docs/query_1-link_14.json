        "text": "Celebration of the first Sunday Mass was in 1870. A church building was erected by the parishioners in 1871. The mission was recognized as a parish in 1873.\n\nThe congregation established its own cemetery in 1882, followed with the acquisition of a crucifix, statues, and colored windows for the church. From 1898, there was a shed for horses and buggies, and another one for the stove wood.\n\nForty Hours Devotions became an annual event with sermons in English and German. For Confirmation, Sylvanians went into St. Mary’s Parish in Toledo. Confirmation was conferred in St. Joseph’s for the first time in 1896 by the Rt. Reverend Bishop of Cleveland, Ignatius Horstmann, D.D. The Toledo Diocese was established in 1910. St. Joseph’s, incidentally, had a unique situation. The church itself was in the Cleveland Diocese, but more than half the parishioners lived across the state line in the Diocese of Detroit.\n\nThe priests who came out to St. Joseph’s in the nineteenth century could come via the Territorial Road, a plank and toll gate affair, over which a stage line once operated, or they could come by railroad. Oral tradition has it that the railroad was the most favored. In 1899,the pastor wrote: “…on Sundays in the afternoon, one of the farmers in turn takes me by wagon up to Monroe Street, i.e. to the Wagonworks (present Swayne Field Shopping Center) where there are street cars…There is hope that there will be in 1900, Electric Cars running from Toledo to Sylvania.”\n\nThe priests who came out to St. Joseph’s in the nineteenth century could come via the Territorial Road, a plank and toll gate affair, over which a stage line once operated, or they could come by railroad.

For example, thanks to friends of Father Henry Nellis, the last Jesuit in Sylvania, new vestments came from a Buffalo Altar Society, and an organ was acquired without any expense to the congregation.\n\nIn the rose glow of post-war prosperity, 1927, it seemed feasible for the parish to erect the red brick auditorium as a meeting hall with large kitchen and dining room facilities in the basement. But no sooner was the building completed in January, 1928, than the black specter of the Depression descended leaving the little parish floundering with—less than 200 families and a debt that grew with unpaid interest into more than $68,ooo.\n\nFather Florian Straub became the second resident pastor on May 9, 1930 .The new hall was turned into a church when the first church was no longer able to accommodate the increase in membership which reached 708 that year. The former church was converted into classrooms for the 122 pupils in school.\n\nFrom 1936-1946, Reverend Alfred Schindler was pastor of a parish which in the final analysis was bankrupt. He was a very determined priest and placed great spiritual trust in the ways of God. He tried in many legitimate avenues to gain support for the parish.\n\nFor years and years, St. Joseph parishioners tried to accumulate funds for a bigger church with revenue coming from lectures, socials, bazaars, pew rent, and special collections. With a school to support, they turned to giving Labor Day dinners to raise money. The automobile age had dawned, and people flocked from miles around for the good, home cooking served in huge, screened tents on the church grounds.\n\nDesperate measures were needed. The new hall was turned into a church. In 1938, the parish school was closed. To continue the opportunity for Catholic education, the Sisters of St. Francis opened Guardian Angel Day School, held in the old church and school building, which were moved together. The Sisters assumed all expenses of maintaining the building.\n\nA 1946 report noted that the Sisters had already spent $8,000 in improving the school.\n\nThe old dreams of a large church and a new parish school could no longer be put off as nebulous “maybe-someday” projects. They began to take on reality in 1956, with a successful drive for pledges to the building fund. Four classrooms were built and, together with the use of the former Guardian Angel building, opened in September, 1958, as St. Joseph Parish School with 286 pupils. Soon after, four more rooms were built. A solemn blessing by Bishop Rehring was given on May 24, 1959.\n\nWith further pledges in the 1961 drive, the way was clear for the erection of a church. A new rectory had to be build so that the old one could be razed to make room for the church. Father John Meehan, who served the longest of all St. Joseph pastors (1946-1967), took up residence in the new rectory in 1963. Construction on the church began in 1965. In April, 1967,\n\nthe Most Reverend John A. Donavan, Bishop of Toledo, dedicated the new building which, incidentally, was his first church dedication in his new diocese.\n\nJust as parishioners back in 1872 lent their hand to building a church, so also did parishioners volunteer to take down the church.. The small statue of an angel, which used to be in a niche above the front entrance, now stands along-side the church to mark the site and existence of Guardian Angel Day School, 1938-1958.\n\nLand across the street from the church was acquired for added parking facilities. With it came a small house. In September, 1967, it was used as St. Joseph Antique Annex. The shop was a money making project of the ladies of the parish,\n\nand much credit for its success was due to the expertise and enthusiasm of Father George Schmit, who became pastor in June, 1967.\n\nFather Schmit continued building a strong parish plant and serving the spiritual needs of the faithful.\n\nOnce the church was completed, Father converted the former church into a library and gymnasium in the fall of 1967. Also, during his administration, the church was remodeled to conform to the decrees of Vatican Council II. In 1973, the parish celebrated its’ centenary. In 1974, an addition was completed in the school.\n\nMost Reverend James R. Hoffman, Auxiliary Bishop of Toledo, succeeded Father Schmit as pastor on June 15, 1978. Bishop Hoffman served this parish until his installation as Ordinary of the Diocese on February 18, 1981. During his administration, he completed the renovation of the sanctuary with the installation of the new organ. Bishop Hoffman gave careful attention to the more than 6,000 souls in the parish, the many parish programs, as well as carrying out the duties as Auxiliary Bishop (Mossing, 1985, p. 212). This year the parish community celebrated the 25th Silver Anniversary of Festirama which the Bishop had begun as a parish family reunion in 1979.\n\nRev. Dr. Donald Heintschel, was appointed pastor when Bishop Hoffman was named Bishop of the Toledo Diocese, effective February 25, 1981. He was pastor for a very short period of time as he was chosen Associate General Secretary of the United States Catholic Conference in June, 1982 (Mossing, 1985, p. 212).\n\nReverend Richard T. Wurzel became pastor on July 2, 1990. In 1991, the rectory was converted to much-needed office space and additional meeting rooms. To facilitate this transition and to provide more privacy, the priests moved off campus. Because of the growth in school and CCD enrollment, an additional five classrooms were added to the school in time for the August, 1991 opening.\n\nSt. Joseph Church and school have continued to grow over the years. With more than 3300 households now registered at St. Joseph’s, we are one of the largest parishes in the Diocese\n\nWe are not only large in numbers. We’d like to say we have large hearts as well. Our parishioners continually support not only our own parish, but such charities as the St. Vincent de Paul Society, Mom’s House, Central City Ministries, the Christmas Giving Tree. In July, 2000, we began parish tithing to needy charities in our larger community. We give financially and with our time and talents.\n\nWe continually minister to others in and out of the St. Joseph community. Christ Renews His Parish teams have been so successful here that outreach programs to other parishes have been started by the men and women of this parish in the Toledo Diocese, as well as in Brighton, Michigan, and Naples, Italy. Christ Renews His Family was also started to strengthen the spiritual bonds of our parish families. We extend ourselves and try to educate people about our Catholic faith with RCIA (The Rite of Christian Initiation of Adults) and the Respect Life Committee. Our Vocations committee supports new seminarians with prayers and stipends. The school philosophy stresses service to others and developing a Christian way of life.\n\nWe remember with much gratitude the early struggles of all those who came before us to bring St. Joseph Parish to the present time. As our mission statement suggests, “we are aware of Christ’s presence in our midst” and will continue to strive to be a community of His disciples reaching out and giving to others through our various ministries and thereby sharing God’s love."
