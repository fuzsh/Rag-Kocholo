She was born on April 23, 1980, in Kalamazoo, Michigan to John Harris and JoAnn (Bremer) Harris. Kathryn married the love of her life, Michael Radelt, on September 21, 2013, in Howell, Michigan. Kathryn was an honors student at Calvin College and went on to receive her Master’s degree in education from Seton Hall University in New Jersey. Kathryn was a dedicated teacher who taught at private Christian schools throughout her career. She was a go getter with a warm personality and was very outgoing. Kathryn loved animals and in her youth she enjoyed horseback riding. Kathryn battled health issues her entire life, but she loved life and traveling with her husband, Michael. In her later years she took up painting and drawing and enjoyed giving her paintings as gifts. Kathryn was very spiritual and her Catholic faith was very important to her. Kathryn was a joy to know and will be missed by all who knew and loved her.\n\nHer Family… Kathryn will be missed by her husband, Michael Radelt; mother, JoAnn Casey; siblings, Jennifer (Jon) Pomeroy, Kyle Harris, Paxton (Jessica) Capman; and many other close family members on both sides. She is preceded in death by her father, John Harris; and step-son, Nicolas Radelt.\n\nHer Farewell… Kathryn’s family and friends will gather for a Mass of Christian Burial, Saturday, August 17, 2024 at 11:00AM (10 AM gathering), at Holy Spirit Catholic Church, Brighton, Michigan.
