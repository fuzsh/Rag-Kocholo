        "text": "Sister Jean Mulloy\n\n“I’ve had wonderful experiences, all growing ones. You don’t know you’re growing, but you’re being pulled, and you’re hurting many times, but I think I became a better person because of things that happened in my life that made me more flexible, more open to change.”\n\nSister Adela Rodriguez\n\n“I leave the past behind and with hands outstretched to whatever lies ahead. I go straight for the goal…” Phil. 3:13\n\nSister Virginia O’Connell\n\n“If you have a dream, give it all the prayer you have and it will happen in God’s time.”\n\nSister Catherine Ginty\n\n“In my early years, I found God’s presence in the Church and the Sacraments. Furthermore, in the years that have followed, I am still learning to find God’s presence in all that is created.”\n\nSister Jean Plausky\n\n“My vocation story is a simple love story. As far back as I can remember, my parents taught me that God was wonderful and loved everyone.”\n\nSister Gail Donahue\n\n“The Sisters of St. Joseph reach out to the needs of others. This has enabled me to reach out to all kinds of people who would have been otherwise unknown to me at so many different times in my life.”\n\nSister Alice Kirby\n\n. . . She continues to witness to her beloved CSJ charism as a grant writer, a member of the Shawl Ministry, a Sacristan at the Motherhouse Chapel, and as a volunteer for activities and events at Bethany Health Care Center and St. Joseph Preparatory High School.\n\nSister Kathleen Hagerty\n\n“The role of the CSJ is to be present to people where they are, to meet them where they are, to be with them where they are. That contemplative way of being allows people to come to know God in ways they may not otherwise.”\n\nSister Helen Noonan\n\n“Being a CSJ is very deep inside of me, and I’m very proud to say I am a Sister of Saint Joseph, it’s in my very being.”\n\nSister Frances Wool\n\n“It is the little things we can do for each other that make a difference.”\n\nSister Ann Marie Grady\n\n“All life is connected. I think in images. Where I’ve lived, the people I’ve lived with are a part of me. These connections are an important part of what enables me to be and do.” With these words, Sister Ann Marie Grady captured the essence of the relationships that have…\n\nSister Joan Duffy\n\nThe Duffy Family of Brighton, Massachusetts welcomed their second child into their lives and named her Joan, which in Hebrew means “gift from God”. Two more children joined the household, and many happy memories were created growing up in a multigenerational family.\n\nSister Jackie Damoiseau\n\nJacqueline was the only child born to John and Frances Damoiseau in Waltham, Massachusetts. Her youngest uncle was only five years older, and they developed a “somewhat sibling” relationship. This uncle taught her to ride a bike, and, in turn, Jackie helped with his paper route.\n\nSister Patricia Boyle\n\nReligion is a scary thing to some people,” states Pat Boyle, CSJ. In her current position as Associate Director of the Office of Pastoral Planning, she works with the leadership teams and parishioners in parishes of the Archdiocese as they implement Disciples in Mission. “It is a privilege for me…\n\nSister Ellie Wiegand\n\nSister Ellie Wiegand seems happiest when she is busy. That was evident during her interview for Connecting, when she noted that not only was she being interviewed, but she also had two banana breads and two coffee cakes in the oven.\n\nSister Nancy Braceland\n\nSister Nancy Braceland is a risk taker. Throughout her ministries, she has pushed boundaries, sometimes choosing the unknown. She states, “I choose to be with the immigrant. Sometimes we forget that’s our history: that either we or our ancestors were once immigrants – we have to remember this.”"
