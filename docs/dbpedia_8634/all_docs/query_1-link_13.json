        "text": "News\n\nThe Twentieth Sunday In Ordinary Time\n\nA good number of people are taking advantage of holiday time and here we have not been drenched with rain or suffered the intense heat as in some other parts of Europe.\n\nThis weekend we will be sharing a communal celebration of the Sacrament of the Anointing of the Sick during Mass at 3pm in St Mary’s Church followed by tea together. Remember that since the second Vatican Council the Sacrament is now more generally available, not just for someone near to death, but to strengthen and comfort people with chronic illnesses, disabilities and before operations.\n\nThis event also indicates the way forward in cooperation between parishes in the light of the Pastoral Plan.\n\nWe are nearing the end of Chapter 6 of St John’s Gospel as after revealing the identity of Jesus the Evangelist has His words about the Gift of the Eucharist. You may recall that at the evening Mass of the Lord’s Supper, John tells of the washing of the feet of the Apostles in Chapter 13 and other details of the Last Passover meal, unlike the other Evangelists.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 18 August 10:00am Mass (20 in OT)\n\nMonday 19 August 8:15am St Mary’s Convent Mass\n\nWednesday 21 August 9:30am Mass (Pope St Pius X)\n\nFriday 23 August 9:30am (St Rose of Lima)\n\nSunday 25 August 10am (21 in OT)\n\nForthcoming Event\n\nNational Eucharistic Congress ay Oscott College. You can read more about this event by clicking here. In our Parish on Sunday 16th September we will have a period of Exposition of the Blessed Sacrament following the Sunday Mass.\n\nPope St Pius X\n\nBest remembered for his encouragement of frequent reception of Holy Communion and by children. Because of fasting from Midnight it was the custom to have an 8am Mass on Sundays and not at subsequent Masses.\n\n(The present ruling is that we should abstain from food 1 hour before receiving Holy Communion. Water or medicine excepted. Canon 919)\n\nHe died just before World War 1.\n\nHappy News\n\nSt Bernadette’s Year 5 Teacher, Emma & Marco announce the birth of LilyAurora 3.3kgs (7lbs 2oz.)\n\nOn Receiving Holy Communion\n\nIn approaching therefore, come not with your wrists extended, or your fingers spread; but make your left hand a throne for the right, as for that which is to receive a King\n\nSt Cyril of Jerusalem 4th Century\n\nReply “Amen”, take a step to the left or right and receive the Host.\n\nI received the Living God\n\nAnd my heart is full of joy,\n\nI received the Living God\n\nAnd my heart is full of joy.\n\nHe said, 'I am the Bread\n\nKneaded long ago to give you life'\n\nThe Nineteenth Sunday In Ordinary Time\n\nThe breathless post-event interviews have been fascinating as the athlete expresses their joy, their thankfulness, their gratitude to family, coaches and supporting crowds at the Olympics. No doubt it will be the same in a fortnight when the Paralympics commence. What a contrast to the rest of the news, not only about prejudice but also those who have shown true respect by gathering to support and protect. Nor should we forget those who have faced aggression in all its forms, fulfilling their duty to server the community.\n\nOur penitential rite and prayer will reflect our attitudes.\n\nStatements Of Faith Leaders And Ecumenical Leaders\n\nCardinal Vincent Nichols, President of the Bishops’ Conference. has joined the Chief Rabbi, the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Chief Imam and the Chairman of the Imams National Advisory Board, to speak out against the violence and rioting that has been taking place across the UK.\n\nPlease click here for further details.\n\nBishop Richard’s Statement\n\nEcumenical Leaders’ Statement On Violent Protests\n\nPlease click here.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 11th August 10am – 19th Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nMonday 12th August 8:15am St Mary’s Convent\n\nWednesday 14th August 9:30am – St Maximilian Kolbe\n\nThursday 15th August 9:30am and 7:30pm HOLYDAY – The Assumption Of Our Lady\n\nFriday 16th August 9:30am St Stephen Of Hungary\n\nSunday 18th August 10am – 20th Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nSunday 18th August 3pm – Mass with Sacrament of Anointing – St Mary’s Church\n\nThe Word Of Life\n\nSeptember leaflet to help with your prayer. “Lord it is good for us to be here.” cf. The Transfiguration.\n\nThe Sacrament Of Anointing\n\nNext Sunday with St Mary’s we will be celebrating a Mass with the Sacrament of Anointing at 3pm followed by tea. During the Lourdes pilgrimage those with health conditions, disabilities and acute illnesses are anointed as Christ is present as physician and in Holy Communion. The oil for the sacrament is one of the three blessed by the bishop at the Chrism Mass and received at the Mass of the Lord’s Supper on Holy Thursday. The oil is put on the forehead and palms of the hands. Those accompanying pray with faith for those being anointed and those persons may receive the sacrament more than once. Remember that over fifty years ago at the Second Vatican Council the name of the sacrament was changed from “Unctio In Extremis”. If uncertain, have a word with Fr John.\n\nThe Assumption Of Our Lady\n\nAugust 15th is a holiday in many European Countries as holidaymakers will experience. It is an Holyday of Obligation. The Obligation is to assist at Mass and if possible, from work, We have two Masses on Thursday 9:30am and 7:30pm.\n\nGuide me O thou great Redeemer,\n\nPilgrim through this barren land,\n\nI am weak but thou art mighty,\n\nHold me with thy powerful hand,\n\nBread of heaven, Bread of Heaven,\n\nFeed me till I want no more,\n\nFeed me till want no more.\n\nThe Eighteenth Sunday In Ordinary Time\n\nAugust is a time of change and rest: holidays happen, harvesting gets underway and energy is recaptured. Among the feasts of the Church will be the Transfiguration and the Assumption of Mary. Reading Chapter 6 of St John’s Gospel is a highlight exploring faith in Jesus and gradually understanding more about the gift of Jesus as he promises himself in the Eucharist.\n\nBishop Richard\n\nAfter leading the Pilgrimage to Lourdes, Bishop Richard will be going on retreat and then having a rest before returning to his usual busy life and routine – and his weekly video messages.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 4th August 10am 18th in Ordinary Time\n\nMonday 5th August 8:15am St Mary’s Convent Dedication of St Mary Major, Rome\n\nTuesday 6th August 9:30am The Transfiguration of The Lord\n\nThursday 8th August 9:30am St Dominic\n\nFriday 9th August 9:30am St Teresa Bendicta of The Cross\n\nSunday 11 August 10am 19th in Ordinary Time\n\nThe Word of Life\n\nThe leaflet to help your prayer during August is now in the Entrance. Remember the text from Scripture has a commentary and during the month let the Word sink in and cause your prayer.\n\nThe Lectionary\n\nIt will not be too long before the Lectionaries and the Sunday Missals will become available. Do follow this link that gives plenty of information. You will also discover what is meant by the Catholic Edition of the Bible and why we will have a new Translation.\n\nJesus Shepherd of the sheep\n\nYour true flock in safety keep\n\nLiving bread, your life supply\n\nStrengthen us, or else we die.\n\n- from Lauda Sion\n\nThe Seventeenth Sunday In Ordinary Time\n\nThis is the Day for Grandparents and the Elderly following Friday’s Feast of Saints Joachim and Anne. As at least two grandparents commented during the week they had both had SOS messages to go to their daughters to help out. Now that the school holidays have commenced there is evidence of grandpas and grannies out with the children while parents are out at work. Know that you are special!\n\nThe 50th Diocesan Pilgrimage To Lourdes\n\nBishop Richard leads the Pilgrimage to Lourdes and you can follow it at home on the Diocesan Website at Lourdes Pilgrimage where you can receive his daily message.\n\nOn Wednesday the Diocese celebrates Mass in the Grotto and everyone at home in the Diocese will be included in the prayers.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 28 July 10am 17th in Ordinary Time\n\nSaturday 3 August 8:15am HMP Lewes\n\nSunday 4 August 10am 18th in Ordinary Time\n\nGrandparents’ Day\n\nPope Francis has written a Message for this Day. You can also see a video from Cardinal Vincent (please see below) There is also a reflection about Saints Joachim and Anne, Parents of Mary and therefore Grandparents of Jesus.\n\nThere is a great devotion to Saint Anne in Brittany.\n\nThe Olympic Games in Paris\n\nThe Parishes in Paris are welcoming the many visitors to the City and we had a glimpse of Notre Dame Cathedral which is almost finished after its restoration. Read what Pope Francis said here.\n\nAnd finally…\n\nTo holidaymakers – welcome to St Thomas More’s! To those travelling –bon voyage!\n\nThe Sixteenth Sunday In Ordinary Time\n\nWith the end of the School Year, holiday time is here and a time for a break and change of routine, hopefully without a repeat of the chaos with the outages. For Teachers and Staff of our Schools a thank you for all your commitment to the young.\n\nThe Diocesan Pilgrimage To Lourdes\n\nOver 700 Pilgrims from the Diocese begin journeying to Lourdes on Thursday and Friday – 17 year olds from the Secondary Schools, nurses, disabled and sick people and lots of helpers. You may catch sight of them by visiting “The Sanctuary of Lourdes” via our website or the Diocesan Website. It will be the 50th Anniversary of A&B’s Pilgrimage.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 21st July 10am 16th Sunday Ordinary Time\n\nMonday 22nd July 8:15am St Mary’s Convent\n\nWednesday 24th July 11am Requiem Mass for Adela Page RIP St Mary’s Church\n\nFriday 26th July 9:30am Ss Joachim and Anne (parents of Our Lady)\n\nSunday 28th July 10am 17th Sunday Ordinary Time.

She is described as ‘The Apostle To The Apostles’. From the Preface:\n\nHe appeared in the garden and revealed Himself to Mary Magdalene, who had loved him in life, witnessed him dying on the Cross, sought him as he lay in the tomb, and was the first to adore him, newly risen from the dead.\n\nFifteenth Sunday In Ordinary Time\n\nThis Sunday is set aside as Sea Sunday, when we think of seafarers who live and work on the sea – be they on container ships, cruise ships, ferries or fishing vessels- men and women with families, The Apostleship of the Sea or Stella Maris is the Catholic charity which provides pastoral care in ports where the ships call in, not only in the UK but also around the world.

It is 60 pages long and can be found as a download file on this webpage.\n\nSt Thomas More – Patron of Politicians and Statesmen\n\nAppropriately following the General Election and the Bidding for the newly elected here are the dates of his political and legal career:\n\nStudied Law at Oxford and London\n\nElected to Parliament 1504\n\n1510 engaged in a Diplomatic Mission at the request of Henry VIII\n\nMember of the King’s Council\n\nPresiding Judge of various Tribunals\n\n1523 Speaker of the House of Commons\n\n1529 Lord Chancellor.- the first layman to hold this Office (when you enter the Church observe the Chain of Office around his neck with the English rose in the centre.)\n\n1532 Not wishing to support Henry’s intention to take control of the Church and being true to his principles he was arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London.\n\n“I die the King’s faithful servant but God’s first”\n\nThe July Word of Life\n\nDon’t forget to take a copy to help with your prayerful reflection.\n\nOur Patronal Feast and Dedication Anniversary\n\nEvery Year around the Anniversary of St Thomas More’s Church and Parish we celebrate with a Mass of thanksgiving, remembering the Founder Priest and members who built the Church in 1963 and the comings and goings since then. We think of the benefactors who raised the funds and those who generously continue to support the Parish.\n\nWhy was it named after the Martyr, St Thomas More? Fr Edward Fooks and his brother, also a priest were sons of Arnold Fooks of the legal firm Arnold, Fooks and Chadwick who were the lawyers for the Catholic Diocese of Southwark which then covered the territory of South London, Surrey, Sussex and Kent. When the Canonisation of Thomas More and John Fisher was to take place in 1935, Mr Fooks sought permission to take his sons to Rome – they were both students for the priesthood at the time – and Bishop Amigo agreed. When Fr Fooks was Parish Priest at St Mary’s and recognised the need to build a Church for the growing areas of Patcham, Hollingbury and Westdene he requested that the new church would have the title of St Thomas More.\n\nWhen Bishop Murphy O’Connor consecrated the Church on 10th July 1983, anointing the altar with Chrism – that is why the Celebrant kisses it – Fr Fooks was present and anointed the 12-consecration points around the church. Under the Table of the Altar the Bishop inserted a relic of the Martyr St Philip Howard.\n\nRemembrance\n\nWe remember Fr Gerry Vann RIP and Fr Peter Rogers RIP who have served this Parish and Fr John who recently passed another anniversary of priesthood on 24th May, having been ordained in St Dominics, Waddon, Croydon, 1964.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 7 July 10am Patronal Dedication and Feast Day\n\nMonday 8 July 8:15am St Mary’s Convent\n\nWednesday 10 July 9:30am Weekday Mass\n\nFriday 12 July 9:30am Weekday Mass\n\nSaturday 13 July 8:30am HMP Lewes\n\nThe Word of Life\n\nThe leaflet for July takes for the scripture a line from Psalm 23.\n\nThe New Lectionary\n\nFrom Advent, the Scripture will be taken out of the translation known as the ESV CE -The English Standard Version, Catholic Edition. It contains those Readings omitted from some Bibles.\n\nThank You\n\nTo the trio, Mike Mason, John Mason and Jim Pal who weeded the courtyard and gave a ‘short back and sides’ to the driveway. Thank you!\n\n100+ Fundraiser\n\nThe Summer Draw will take place after Mass this Sunday. Annual Subscription £30.\n\nSea Sunday\n\nNext Sunday the annual appeal for Stella Maris – The Apostleship of the Sea – will have a retiring collection.\n\nContactless Giving\n\nA technical problem with the Card Machine should now have been corrected. In these days when cash is not normally used it should be easier to make your offerings. Follow the instructions on the table.\n\nGive me Thy grace to long for Thy holy Sacraments and especially to rejoice in the Presence of Thy very blessed Body, sweet Saviour Christ, in the holy sacrament of the altar and duly to thank Thee for Thy gracious visitation in it.\n\n- From St Thomas More's 'Treatise on The Blessed Body of The Lord'\n\nThe Solemnity of Saint Peter and Saint Paul\n\nA Holyday of Obligation on June 29th, transferred to Sunday this year. Both died for the Faith that they preached, being put to death in Rome. The two great basilicas – St Peter’s and St Paul’s outside the walls are places of Pilgrimage for the many millions who visit Rome. They are described in the Preface as “Peter foremost in confessing the Faith, who established the early Church from the remnant of Israel: Paul its outstanding preacher, master and teacher of the Gentiles that you call”\n\nAlong with many other Martyrs the rousing hymn expresses our loyalty and respect for their faithfulness.\n\n“Faith of our Fathers, Holy Faith\n\nWe will be true to thee till death!\n\nWe will be true to the till death!”\n\nThe Pastoral Plan\n\nAs promised, a brief note on the meeting of the parish reps and priests of the present deanery of Brighton and Hove in a “get to know you meeting” in the light of the Pastoral Plan. Those of you who follow the Diocesan Website or the Diocesan ebulletin will have read how some of the Deaneries have moved to new structures to work together in various aspects of Church Life. There are unfamiliar descriptions which will need explanation but nothing to be alarmed about! We will look forward so that the mission of the Church in Brighton and Hove can flourish. Some of the items raised were: keeping in touch, communication, sacramental preparation, formation, utilising skills, the role of Catholic Schools, social media, cooperation.\n\nIn a separate meeting with Father Sebastian initial plans were discussed and will be brought forward to be realised.\n\nHave another read of the Plan – in the green covered booklets – and pray the prayer for the implementation of the Plan.\n\nYou may remember how at Mass just after Easter the Bishop’s Vision was reviewed. Under his photograph you can read Our Parish Mission.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 30 June 10am Solemnity of Ss.

Let us endeavour ourselves to keep him still, and let us say - ‘Stay with us. Good Lord.’\n\nThe Tenth Sunday in Ordinary Time\n\nAfter celebrating the Seasons of Easter and the solemnities of Ascension, Pentecost, Trinity, the Body and Blood of Christ and the Sacred Heart of Jesus, we return to remembrance of the ministry of Jesus with his teachings as we read St Mark’s Gospel. This has another title -translated from the Latin as “Ordinary Time“- a poor translation which in English implies something of little significance! One attempt at clarifying the term is “ordered“. In the meantime you will notice the green vestment and the abbreviation ‘OT’.\n\nThe Day For Life\n\nFor information on this year’s theme please follow this link.\n\nA Bishop has written drawing attention to the “culture of death “ prevalent in proposed legislation.\n\nPatronal Feast\n\nEach year on the Sunday nearest to the Anniversary of the Dedication of our Church we celebrate the Patronal Feast. This year we will be celebrating on Sunday 7th July at the 10am Mass and afterwards with a drink.\n\nMissio\n\nThe Missions Society – has sent us reports of recent activity.

Please keep up to date by checking the noticeboard in the entrance to the church.\n\nBrother, sister, let me serve you,\n\nLet me be as Christ to you.\n\nPray that I may have the grace to\n\nLet you be my servant too.\n\nThe Body and Blood Of Christ\n\nThe description of the Eucharist as “the source and summit of the Christian life” does not immediately engage us or reveal the richness of Christ’s gift to His followers. It takes a lifetime to appreciate the riches it contains. Remembering the first time we received Holy Communion is a starting point. Where was it? What preparations were made? Who was there? What can you remember of the day? Maybe we could think of how it draws us closer to Jesus or how it strengthens our sense of belonging as a member of the Church – the great family of Catholics who are attached to the worldwide Catholic Church or the local Church of the Diocese or the community of the Parish. Take time to think about the meaning of Communion in all its forms. Our response, of course, is one of thanksgiving, worshipping , promising and adoring.\n\nBishop Richard’s Weekly Reflection\n\nNo video this week, but the text can be found here.\n\nNational News\n\nA new publication – ‘Called to be Peacemakers’ has now been published.
