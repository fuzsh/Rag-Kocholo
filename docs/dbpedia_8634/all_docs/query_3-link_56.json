        "text": "9th April 2024\n\nI have just issued the following hard-hitting Message to the Parish of Guernsey. The island is gearing up for elections and currently there is a concerted campaign to make legal assisted suicide and euthanasia.\n\nDear Canon Christopher and Parishioners of Guernsey,\n\nYOUR LIFE AND YOUR WELL-BEING ARE UNDER THREAT\n\nFirst of all, I wish you a very Happy Easter. I wish you many graces and blessings from the Lord. The death and resurrection of Christ gives us hope for our lives here on earth and the promise of eternal life with God in heaven.\n\nI write because dark clouds are threatening the beautiful island of Guernsey. The Lord’s death and resurrection remind us of two fundamental moral truths: ‘Thou shalt not kill’ (Ex 20: 13) and ‘Love thy neighbour as thyself’ (Mk 12: 31). These are commandments Jesus taught in His life on earth and of which He gave us a wonderful example. These commandments, ‘Thou shalt not kill’ and ‘Love thy neighbour as thyself,’ form the bedrock not only of Jewish and Christian morality; they are the teaching of all religions. More, they are instinctive principles written into every human heart and they ground the laws governing every civilised society on earth. Yet there are now dark forces at work in Guernsey in the media and public life actively seeking to undermine these principles. I refer here to the campaign to legalise euthanasia, or mercy-killing, and assisted suicide. (I don’t use the term ‘assisted dying.’ I call it by the name of what it actually is: suicide).\n\nAssisted suicide is gravely wrong for at least four reasons. First, it places an intolerable and immoral demand on medical staff, doctors and nurses. It asks them to ignore the Hippocratic Oath they take to preserve life, in order to extinguish life. Many a vet will speak of their grief at putting down a beloved family pet – “putting it out of its misery” – yet surely, we cannot treat an elderly relative in the same way? Assisted suicide would place medics in an impossible dilemma. It would ultimately undermine the trust we place in them. How would we know any more whether the doctor is working in our best interests?\n\nSecondly, to legalise euthanasia and assisted suicide would undermine palliative care and the work of care-homes. After all, it is easier and cheaper to kill someone than to care for them. Yes, frailty, pain and infirmity are a difficult trial and the terminally ill can experience despair. Yet, thanks be to God for the amazing advances medical science has made. Britain is a leader in palliative care with methods and drugs that can manage pain right to the end. The Church always works to relieve suffering but as a Christian, I would add that in union with Christ, it is possible to find from Him all the patience and energy we need to sustain suffering – to ‘carry the cross’ (Mt 16: 24) – and to turn it into a positive good for others. This is the meaning of Easter, when Jesus underwent death at the hands of those who had decided it was better for society to have Him extinguished.\n\nThirdly, the possibility of assisted suicide puts intolerable pressure on the sick and the elderly. It makes them feel they are a burden on their family and a financial burden. Yet when we love someone, efficiency and cost-saving is irrelevant. How can helping someone to commit suicide ever be compassionate? It is evil masquerading as a kindness. As one of your Deputies said recently in the newspaper: “Considerable savings could be realised if assisted dying was to be introduced here in the island”. Seeking to justify himself, he added “Many people don’t want to keep on living, and I think we need to put a figure on that.”\n\nAnd fourthly, as in Belgium and elsewhere where assisted suicide and euthanasia have been legalised, the legislation gradually keeps creeping forward, expanding to cover more and more categories: sick children, people with autism, those with dementia, the depressed, the mentally ill, the handicapped and others whose lives someone else decides are not worth living. In Canada, almost 5% of deaths are now by lethal injection. Recently, I read about a Canadian doctor boasting that she had helped hundreds and hundreds of people to die: she said it was the “most rewarding work she had ever done.” This is chilling stuff.\n\nI write to you now because your local politicians and pressure groups are raising the question of legalising assisted suicide and this is likely to gather momentum in the next few months before the formal election campaigns begin. I want to appeal to all people of common sense and good will to reject these alarming proposals, and to redouble the compassionate care of those who are terminally ill. Let there be no death-clinics in Guernsey. Don’t let Guernsey become a destination for suicide tourism. The right to die would inevitably become the duty to die – and the right to make another die.\n\nI appeal to Catholics to mobilise. Don’t be persuaded by emotional pitches in the media. Speak out against this sinister proposal. Raise it with the candidates in the forthcoming elections. It is never permissible to use an evil means to do good. Suicide is a mortal sin and helping someone commit suicide is a mortal sin. For we believe in assisted living, not assisted dying. Death is not pain relief; it is the transition to a glorious new life in heaven with God our Father and Creator.\n\nIn Corde Iesu,\n\n+Philip\n\nBishop of Portsmouth\n\nDuring the season of Lent, the Church invites us by God’s grace to undertake three works that, we pray, will lead to our spiritual renewal, preparing us to celebrate Easter. I’d like to invite you to send in anything you are doing so that others too might consider them: something modest and easily do-able. The only condition is that it must fall clearly under one of the categories below. We’ll add to the list below as the weeks go on, thus building up a resource for future years.\n\nPlease email your proposals to Deacon Craig: executiveassistant@portsmouthdiocese.org.uk\n\n1. Works of (daily) prayer: Attending Mass; saying part of the Rosary; making the Stations of the Cross; prayerfully reading the Gospel of the day; reading a daily meditation (online or from a book); reading a spiritual book (lives of the saints, prayer, aspect of faith); saying Morning Prayer or another part of the Divine Office.\n\n2. Works of fasting: giving up tea, coffee, chocolate or alcohol; giving up a favourite biscuit, fruit, food or sugar in a drink; not snacking between meals; fasting on Fridays; cutting back using the computer, social media or watching TV.\n\n3. Works of almsgiving and charity: assisting a parish charitable activity; visiting someone who is sick or elderly; volunteering when an appeal is made; saving money from a work of fasting and donating it to a good charitable cause; supporting CAFOD and Caritas; a work of ‘advocacy’ campaigning for a just cause (e.g. writing to an MP); random acts of kindness at school, work or in the home; giving up idle conversation.\n\nThe Laudato Si group have registered for our Parish for the CAFOD Live Simply Award and they need everyone’s help to achieve this. The award is gained by completing several targets which involve living simply (e.g. more time in prayer and with God), living sustainably and living in solidarity with the poor. The Lihou pilgrimage and the Big Lent Walk are just two examples of how we have already achieved some of these targets together.\n\nThis Lent we would like you all to make a personal pledge to live more sustainably. This could be to walk to work instead or using the car or taking unused items to a charity shop. Paper and pens will be provided in the porch of each church for you to write your pledge on before placing it on the tree which will be on display. We would also like the Parish as a whole to say the CAFOD Live Simply prayer, in Mass, in school and at home. Living simply, sustainably and in solidarity with the poor is truly our faith in action.\n\n‘Live simply, so that others may simply live’\n\nLIVE SIMPLY PRAYER\n\nCompassionate and loving God,\n\nyou created the world for us all to share,\n\na world of beauty and plenty.\n\nCreate in us a desire to live simply,\n\nso that our lives may reflect your\n\ngenerosity.\n\nCreator God,\n\nYou gave us responsibility for the earth,\n\na world of riches and delight.\n\nCreate in us a desire to live sustainably,\n\nso that those who follow after us\n\nmay enjoy the fruits of your creation.\n\nGod of peace and justice,\n\nYou give us the capacity to change,\n\nto bring about a world that mirrors your\n\nwisdom.\n\nCreate in us a desire to act in solidarity,\n\nso that the pillars of injustice crumble\n\nand those now crushed are set free.\n\nAmen.\n\nWINGS, World In Need Group Scheme, was set up in 1974 as a sub-committee of the Deanery Pastoral Council. The aims in the WINGS constitution were to raise awareness of the ‘problems and needs of the Third World (as it was designated at the time), and our responsibilities towards it, to raise funds to alleviate injustice and suffering and to liaise with other Christian organisations to that end’. High ideals indeed!\n\nFounder members were Frank Murphy, our first chairman, Angela Le Page, secretary, Bernard Gill, treasurer, Ian Le Page, Martin Gill, Vivienne Counihan (Thomson), Margaret Edmondson, Ann O’Mahoney, Don Hearne, Lilian Hamilton, Nigel Massey and Moira Murphy and Fr Bernard Fisher and Fr Martin Laker. Later stalwarts include Anne and Bryan Mauger, who kept WINGS going in the 90s, Helen Curran (Foxen) and Margaret Langlois.\n\nOn a personal note, a motivating factor in founding WINGS was as a memorial to Mary Gill, Bernard’s daughter, my sister and a pupil at Notre Dame, who had died that year, aged 11, from leukaemia. She was greatly distressed by the suffering due to a famine in Ethiopia and counted herself lucky to be so well cared for.\n\nOur main partner was CAFOD, the Catholic Fund for Overseas Development. CAFOD had a scheme whereby groups in Catholic parishes could choose a project such as the digging of a well in a village, providing sewing machines to create cottage industries, or books for schools etc. We were provided with a description and the cost of the project then raised funds by means of a monthly second collection from the Catholic churches. WINGS also managed the biannual CAFOD Family Fast Days and Christian Aid Week, providing door to door collectors in the St Peter Port area.\n\nWhen Portsmouth Catholic Diocese was twinned with Bamenda, Cameroon in the same year, WINGS took on the request of Bishop\n\nWorlock to raise £1,000 toward the building of a church and community centre in Bamenda. An appeal was made at the end of Masses by WINGS members. The Catholic community in Guernsey responded with huge generosity and over £1200 was donated in a month. Bear in mind that today £1200 would have a value of around £12,000. Besides funding projects in the developing countries, WINGS members also gave talks in the Catholic schools, held film nights, produced a news sheet describing the projects funded by parishioners donations, researched the provision of Fair Trade products like coffee and liaised with the other parish groups such as UCM, Knights of St Columba, Legion of Mary, Friday Club, the Co Workers of Mother Teresa and ICYC, the Catholic Youth club.\n\nTimes changed and membership changed as did the frequency of collections. The small projects were no longer provided by CAFOD but WINGS continues to support the CAFOD emergency appeals, unfortunately still necessary to this day. Currently WINGS sends yearly donations to the work of the Salesians for the street children of Liberia (Fr Charles Chauvel), the Holy Family Children’s Home in Bethlehem (Canon Hetherington) . Wayaya (Marian and Tony Falla) and Friends of Katete (Peter and Margaret Keeling) have also received WINGS donations over the years. Both the Bamenda appeal and CAFOD Family Fast Days became independent of WINGS.\n\nToday WINGS receives 3 second collections a year raising approximately £1800 a year. However, when Emergency Appeals are made the average of £600 rises to the £1000s. Over 50 years it is hard to put a figure on the contribution made by the Catholics of Guernsey through WINGS to the ‘alleviation of suffering’, especially allowing for the huge change in the value of money but it is well over £100,000 not allowing for inflation. So well done to our Catholic Community whose heart is always in the right place when appealing for those less fortunate than we are.\n\nThank you for your prayers and generosity.\n\nAngela Le Page"
