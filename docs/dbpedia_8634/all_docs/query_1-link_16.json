We pride ourselves on having a real family feel, where the children are known and supported by our dedicated and experienced staff. The children enjoy coming to school and value that sense of belonging, which binds a strong, caring, Christian community.\n\nThe pages of this website offer you just a flavour of what we have to offer. We are extremely proud of our school and would be delighted to share our enthusiasm with you: I very much hope I will have the opportunity of welcoming you personally. For more information, or to arrange a visit, please contact the school office.\n\nKindest Regards\n\nTina Davidson\n\nHeadteacher\n\nDear Parents,\n\nWe’re pleased to announce that St John the Baptist Catholic Primary is introducing a new, more efficient and secure system for reporting your child’s absence due to illness, called Studybugs.\n\nStudybugs will also help us track and act early on any Covid-19 and well-being reports, protecting staff, students and our surrounding community.\n\nIf you haven’t already, please get the free Studybugs app, or register on the Studybugs website, and use it to tell us whenever your child’s ill and unable to attend school. We will also be moving many of our usual communications over to Studybugs, so it's important you download the app prior to your child being ill.\n\nGet the app or register now: https://studybugs.com/about/parents\n\nThank you,\n\nSt John the Baptist Catholic Primary School, Brighton"
