        "text": "News\n\nTrinity Sunday\n\nOur response to God is one of Faith – I believe – and is the relationship which builds up each day. Through the Scriptures we discover God revealed to us as Father, Son and Holy Spirit, three persons in one God. Do not attempt to work it out like an equation. It is a Mystery of Revelation. We find in our prayer life that we are close to God when, like his Son, we say “ Our Father. Abba”; when we pray to “Our Lord Jesus Christ”, and when we invite the powerful presence of the Holy Spirit. This feast reminds us to become more aware of how we address God at the beginning of prayer and how we conclude our praying. We may be amazed how Trinitarian our prayer and worship become.\n\nThe General Election\n\nThe Bishops of England and Wales remind us to bear in mind the Common Good and have set out some of the issues to be discerned and considered in our voting and discussion. In recent months some leaflets from political parties have come through the letterbox mainly about local issues . When the Parties Manifestos are published then we should examine them carefully and be prepared to question candidates and callers on their content. One example would be the role of Faith Schools , remembering how important a place they have in the Church’s mission for education.\n\nTo research further you can find on the Bishops’ Conference some of the issues which may not be heard in the Media deluge over the next 6 weeks.\n\nClick here to read more about the following issues: Criminal Justice, domestic poverty, family life, education . environment, life issues, migration, international relations, the common good.\n\nCorpus Et Sanguinis Christi – The Body and Blood of Christ\n\nThe annual celebration of this Solemnity takes place next Sunday at the 10.am Mass to be followed by a time of Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament and thanksgiving for our Holy Communions. A time to remember our First Holy Communion Day and to recall how our devotion has developed since.\n\nArundel Cathedral Celebration\n\nThe long tradition marking this Feast in Arundel with a Solemn Mass and Procession into the grounds of Arundel Castle will commence on Wednesday May 29th with the display of the Carpet of Flowers and on Thursday 30th May with the Mass and Procession at 5.30pm\n\nYou can read more here.\n\nOnline Live Broadcasts\n\nArundel Cathedral website.\n\nFrom Lourdes. Each day you can follow the Procession and Adoration of the Blessed Sacrament at 4pm BST.

There is remarkable energy in the symbols of a wind and fire manifested in enthusiasm ,courage and action. From the first mention by Jesus of an advocate and God’s Spirit there was anticipation of what this would mean. Subsequently the message of Jesus and its effects became evident in the spreading far and wide of the knowledge of the meaning for individuals and communities, At Baptism and all the other moments of Christian celebration the presence of the Spirit is evident, Remember those word at your Confirmation “receive the gift of the Holy Spirit”.\n\nBishop Richard’s Weekly Reflection\n\nThis week’s reflection can be found here.\n\nPraying For Vocations To The Priesthood\n\nWe pray for the Holy Spirit to be poured out on our Diocese to produce many vocations.\n\nRead about the variety of spiritual gifts that make up the Church.1 Corinthians 12.3 -13.\n\nTwo Deacons will be Ordained to Priesthood in Arundel Cathedral in June.

He is presently dean of the Cathedral in Arundel.\n\nSend your Spirit upon us,\n\nAs helper and guide\n\nMay he fill us with wonder and awe.\n\nSeal us O Lord with your holy gift.\n\nSend your Spirit to renew our lives.\n\nThe Seventh Week Of Easter\n\nFollowing the celebration of the Ascension we enter a time of inviting the Holy Spirit to come to renew us and fill us with spiritual energy to be the followers of Jesus and to understand more clearly His message – what He has done and is doing for us. The Novena days ahead encourage us to invite the Holy Spirit to remind us of His presence first gifted at Baptism, then at Confirmation and subsequently in the Sacrament of Reconciliation, the Anointing and the Eucharist. Just focus on the times the Holy Spirit is invoked during Mass.\n\nBishop Richard’s Weekly Reflection\n\nThere is no video this week but Bishop Richard’s reflection can be found here.\n\nWorld Communications Day\n\nThe Sunday after the Ascension is observed as a day with communications at its heart. Pope Francis has written a letter about one aspect of social communication – “Artificial Intelligence and the wisdom of the heart. Towards a fully human Communication”. You can read the Pope’s Letter here. You can watch the video below.\n\nThere is a second collection to support the Catholic media office which provides material for the Media in this country.\n\nImpact Of The Criminal Justice Bill\n\nAmendments attempting to decriminalise aspects of present legislation relating to abortion will be debated further endangering life of the unborn. Do read the response of the Bishops which can be found here.\n\nThe Word Of Life Leaflet For May\n\nThis leaflet is now available to use in your prayerful reflection during the month of May.

He sends us His Spirit and he gives us the hope of one day reaching the place he has won for us. The day is a Holyday when we are expected to attend Mass. There are 2 Masses in our church: in the morning at 9.30am and in the evening at 7pm. Do make the effort to participate.\n\nDay of Prayer for The Eastern Churches\n\nWe are asked to pray for the members of the Eastern Catholic Churches which include the Catholics in the Holy Land. These remain in union with the Pope and have their own Liturgies and Canon Law. For example, Greek Catholic, Coptic, Syrian. There are also other Churches who are described as Orthodox who as yet are not in union with the Catholic Church. They are celebrating Easter this weekend.\n\nPraying for Vocations\n\nIn this 6th week of Easter, we reflect on the spirit of sacrifice and pray for greater numbers to respond generously to celebrate the sacrifice of the Mass.\n\nThe Diocesan Plan\n\nThere was a first gathering of the five parishes of the Brighton part of the Deanery to begin the consideration of how in the future the Church can co-operate, for example with preparation for the Sacraments, training for ministries, levels of administration, Mass times etc.\n\nNow is a good time to read again the green covered copies of the Bishop’s Plan – either the A4 copy or the abridged version – along with the prayer!\n\nThe Ministry of Welcome\n\nA Parish Community likes to be called ‘welcoming’. This depends on members thinking that the other people are also present to be part of the worshipping group forming community. It makes all the difference if there is someone there to greet us at the door. A friendly welcome, a smile, offering a hymn book but no inquisition! Could you fit the profile? Do let Fr John know.\n\nSudan Crisis Appeal\n\nThere is a wall box in the Entrance for your generosity.\n\nMass Schedule\n\nSunday 5th May Mass 10am. Int.

We have another image used by Jesus, one understood by the Chosen People, and one we can easily grasp. It reminds us to find strength by adhering to Jesus, like a branch attached to its stem. Every now and then it is good to ask ourselves how we are developing our understanding of the Faith and what it means for our sense of membership. There is a regular reminder as we pray the Eucharistic Prayer with parts such as “that we may become on body one spirit in Christ”, in union of mind and heart with Pope Francis and our shepherd, Bishop Richard.\n\n‘Intricately Woven By The Lord’ – from the Bishops of England & Wales\n\nA Pastoral reflection on gender by the Bishops.

In a spirit of faith, we deepen the commitment of the Sacrament of Baptism which may have happened long ago and are inspired by those adults who are baptised at the Easter Vigil along with those being received into full communion in Christ’s Church. Along with these features of Easter life comes a fresh joy in our hearts –singing a new song.\n\nIt is also a time to thank parishioners for their generous support in giving but also in the time and effort of ministries – of reading preparations for the liturgies, maintenance, music, finance and so many ways needed to support the parish community.\n\nThe Chrism Mass\n\nSome of you did join the live streaming of this significant Mass.
