        "text": "At St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, we feel that Religious Education runs right through the whole of our school life and we are incredibly proud of the way children engage in Gospel Values and their own spiritual development.\n\n10% of our teaching time is directly spent on teaching RE for which we use either the 'Come and See' curriculum (Years 2, 3, 4 and 5) or the new The new Religious Education Directory (RED) in the EYFS and Years 1 and 6\n\nThe new RED curriculum will be implemented across the school completely by September 2025.\n\nhttp://www.comeandseere.co.uk/\n\nClick on these links below for more information about our RE teaching and curriculum coverage.\n\nSt Joseph's Catholic School RE Statement\n\nRE Policy\n\nCollective Worship Policy\n\nCatholic School's Inspection Report February 2022\n\nYearly RE Coverage 2023-2024\n\nReligious Education Directory\n\nInformation for parents - Summer Term 2023\n\n______________________________________________________________________________\n\nDaily Christian Meditation\n\nWe have a daily act of worship and each class holds a Christian Meditation session after lunch for five minutes. Christian Meditation, alongside collective worship and prayer are an integral part of school life. Children have talked enthusiastically about how this helps them settle for the afternoon's work and how they enjoy the opportunity to engage with God for just a short part of their day.\n\nThe children take it in turns to set up the prayer focus.\n\nWe also have several prayer spaces outside too, which children can visit alone or gather together in, to quietly reflect and pray and spend time talking to God and reflecting on their faith.\n\nAt St Joseph's we pray together throughout the day. Our classroom prayers are learnt by children from their early days in school and are said each and every day. These are a few of the prayers that may be said during the school day.\n\nMorning Prayer:\n\nThank you, God for this new day In my school to work and play. Please be with me all day long In every story, game and song. May all the happy things we do Make you Our Father, happy too.\n\nAmen\n\nLunchtime Prayer:\n\nBless us O God as we sit together Bless the food we eat today, Bless the hands that make the food, Bless us O God Amen.\n\nPrayer for the end of the school day:\n\nAt the end of the day, we come to say\n\nThank you for your love today.\n\nThank you for our families\n\nAnd all the friends you give to me.\n\nGuard me through the dark of night\n\nand in the morning send your light.\n\nAmen.\n\nThese prayers are in addition to the ‘Our Father’, ‘Hail Mary’ and the ‘Glory be ’.\n\n__________________________________________________________________________________\n\nWe meet together every day for worship in assemblies and collective acts of worship. Our Assemblies are used to unite and celebrate our school. Individual and group achievements are celebrated, talents and interests of individuals are observed, news from other parts of the school is shared, current issues are discussed and the need for positive Christian qualities are emphasised.\n\nThe Church’s Liturgical Year is reflected in our Assemblies and Acts of Worship. We come together as a whole school as well as in Key Stages and in several class acts of worship.\n\nWherever possible, children lead and take part in these acts of worship.\n\nWe come together as a community to celebrate events such as Harvest, Christmas and Easter. Our parish priest regularly takes Mass in school.\n\n_________________________________________________________________________________\n\nOur class collective worship each week is based on\n\n\"The Wednesday Word.\" It details Sunday's Gospel, connecting home, school and parish.\n\nThe Wednesday Word is now available on line.Click here for access.\n\nEach child's RE work is kept in their own RE book. These are very special books that contain individual and thoughtful reflections of pupils' religious journeys through the topics throughout the year.\n\nEach class also keeps a shared learning journey that details parts of the RE coverage that children do not record individually in their RE books. This might include role play, group responses to Scripture, photographs and individual responses to a visitor etc."
