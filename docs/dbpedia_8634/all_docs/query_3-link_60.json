If you prefer an App, Universalis also offers a great one for a tenner that automatically loads the exact text and readings for the day, even for our diocesan feasts.\n\nAll of these courses are free.\n\nRosary and Divine Mercy: Fridays 11.00am\n\nNo signup required, just tune into Live Services like you do when you watch mass online.\n\nTo sign up for the following email together@sacredhearthove.org.uk\n\nChristian Meditation: First Friday of the month\n\nI run an online group at 10.00 on the first Friday of the month. We follow the teaching of the late Fr John Main OSB. (www.wccm.org) The meetings last just under an hour. If you would like to receive the link, please e mail me: timothypcullen@gmail.com\n\n******"
