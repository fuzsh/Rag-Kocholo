Keep in touch and let us know how you get on in the future. Good Luck!\n\nTop Team Treat : 19.7.24\n\nIt is lovely to see how excited the children get in Celebration Assembly when the team who have been awarded the most DOJOS is announced.\n\nThe half termly totals have been pretty evenly spread this year with RED and BLUE winning one half term each and GREEN and YELLOW winning two.\n\nThe overall points for the year were added together and the YELLOW team with the most, are this year's top DOJO collectors!\n\nThey enjoyed a refreshing ice lolly treat today. Well done to everyone in the YELLOW team for contributing to your winning total!\n\nGoodbye Year 6 : 19.7.24\n\nOur Year 6 pupils had a lovely final day at St Joseph's. They started off the day with the Leavers' Achievers' assembly and an opportunity to take a walk together down memory lane, recounting their many shared memories and reflections.\n\nThe end of year awards were then given out - congratulations to each and every one of the Year 6 pupils - you are ALL winners in our eyes.\n\nHere are a few of this year's awards and their recipients:\n\nFinn - Sports Award, Julian - Outstanding role-model and Personality (voted by class), Lily-Jo - Head Teacher's Award, Alicia - Outstanding Effort and Ibiye - R.E. and Living Out The Ethos Award.\n\nAttendance Treat: 18.7.24\n\nWe are delighted to have had 10 children in school EVERY SINGLE DAY since 4th September. What an amazing achievement!\n\nTo celebrate, we took these ten children to Preston Park this afternoon where they enjoyed some time in the play area and an ice lolly.\n\nWe understand that from time to time children do become ill and this can't be helped but we had to acknowledge the 190 days these ten children have managed this year!\n\nLeavers' Mass: 18.7.24\n\nToday, was the beginning of our week of goodbyes to our Year 6 pupils and we were joined by Father Kieron to celebrate our Year 6 thanksgiving Leavers' Mass.\n\nOur school year is drawing to its conclusion and so this morning we gathered together as a school community to celebrate and give thanks for all the blessings we have received.\n\nToday's Leavers' Mass was a time for reflection by our Year 6 pupils, both to remember and to look forward to new schools, new friends and new beginnings.\n\nYear 6 Prom : 17.7.24\n\nThis evening was our Year 6 Leaver's Prom.

The children invited a couple of friends and family members to share in the Communion Breakfast celebrations afterwards.\n\nA Taste of Spain!\n\nAs you know, our KS2 pupils study French. Each half term, they study an aspect of French culture as well as learning key phrases and simple conversational French.\n\nIn the final two weeks of term, our KS2 pupils have had a taste of Spain - learning about the location of Spain, its currency, its well-known landmarks and exploring Spanish art alongside learning some key words and phrases in Spanish.\n\nThey also sampled some Spanish food including tortilla (Spanish omelette), chorizo, Manchego cheese, olives and churros.\n\nSummer Party: 12.7.24\n\nToday, we held our annual Summer Party, organised by the FOSJ's. The dark clouds did not deter us!\n\nWe are very grateful to Sheree and the FOSJ's team for their hard work and dedication in helping raise funds to support and enhance our pupils' school experience. Without their help and enthusiasm, these events would not be able to take place and we would not be able to raise vital funds for the school.\n\nThank you also to the staff for helping run the stalls and to the parents, carers, pupils, families and friends for coming along to support our Summer Party. It was another fantastic community event.\n\nCongratulations to these children who have received a Head Teacher certificate or pencil or badge in today's Celebration Assembly:\n\nWell done: Lottie (EYFS) Emma, Mark, Ella, Ray, Mal, King and Skye (Year 2)\n\nThis is the last week of collecting DOJOS for the academic year - children , you having been amazing this year and it has been lovely to see you receiving DOJOS for demonstrating positive learning behaviours.\n\nThese are the final results for this week and the winners for the half-term and the overall winners for the year!\n\n1.

It is one of several council based initiatives that aim to help the city to become carbon neutral by 2030.\n\nFor us as a school, it is a chance to become more sustainable whilst equipping our pupils with an understanding of environmental issues and empowering them to make small changes that can collectively have a big impact.\n\nIn line with our school ethos, we are leading the project with a strong sense of hope and the belief that together we can help to create a brighter future for all.\n\nToday's launch had a celebratory feel about it: building excitement for the project.\n\nThe children looked great in their green and blue earth colours.\n\nThank you for your donations - these will go to our school eco fund.\n\nEco-Launch: 11.1.24\n\nYear 4 recycled and re-purposed Tetra Pak packaging to create pots to grow plants in.\n\nYear 2 used toast to illustrate how we need to work together to minimise damage to our Earth and Year 3 reused damaged plastic bags to create beautiful flowers.\n\nYear 1 tried some Quorn nuggets alongside some chicken nuggets to introduce them to different plant-based alternatives.\n\nThe children in EYFS made banana bread, using up over-ripe bananas that may otherwise have been thrown away.\n\nYear 6 created bird feeders using old food cartons and Year 5 had a \"Green Day Challenge\" working out how much energy they had saved by not using electricity in the classroom for the whole day.\n\nYear 1 saw with their own eyes the impact on wildlife of the polar ice caps melting and this made them think about what could be done about this issue.\n\nThank you to the parents and carers who were able to join us for this afternoon's launch assembly.\n\nPower of Reading\n\nIt is lovely to see the excitement as the children are being introduced to their new high-quality texts based on the Power of Reading scheme.\n\nAfter hearing the opening to their new class book, \"The Silver Donkey,\" the children in Year 6 used charcoal and techniques learnt previously in their art lessons to depict the scene and image that the piece of text created in their minds.\n\nHere are a few of them:\n\nStunning Starts...\n\nTo launch our History and Geography themes each term, the teachers plan a \"Stunning Start\" to ignite the children's interest in the current learning theme through a rich and creative experience!\n\nYear 4 had an \"around the world tasting session\" as an introduction to their theme, \"The World's Kitchen\" sampling different foods such as feta cheese, guacamole, pineapple and falafel and trying to work out which country they came from.\n\nMore pictures to follow on each class page shortly.\n\nBalance Bikes: 9.1.24\n\nOur EYFS class are taking part in Balance Bike Training this week.

The child/children who speak the chosen language will help their classmates learn the correct pronunciation and will share picture books written in their home language as well as in English.\n\nThese are the languages for this half term:\n\nEYFS: Arabic Year 1: Slovak Year 2: French Year 3: Spanish Year 4: Dutch Year 5: Spanish Year 6: Spanish\n\nWishing all of our children and their families a happy and healthy Christmas break.
