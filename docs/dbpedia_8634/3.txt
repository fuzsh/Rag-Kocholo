Tucked away in the hills of Hollingdean, a small school with a big heart and great ambition. As a Catholic school, we welcome children of all faiths and none; our diversity is our great strength. We are a small school with beautifully behaved children and very supportive, friendly staff. Visitors to our school often remark on the calm, spacious environment and warm welcome. Our Ofsted report also made reference to the family atmosphere.

Our children say "If you spend just one day here, you know everyone by the end of the day" and "even the staff are friends".
