St Joseph's

We are a lively and welcoming community made up of people of all ages. We want to give people the opportunity to build friendships, to deepen their faith, and to reach out to others in the wider community, including the marginalised and unchurched.

There are many ways to get involved in the life of our parish. To find out more about us and things going on in our community click on the link above or contact Canon Kieron O'Brien using the details below.
