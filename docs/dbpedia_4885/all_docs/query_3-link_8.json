        "text": "Peter Doddy, of Trevallyn, pays his tribute to the recently passed Tony Benneworth.\n\nRest in peace\n\nIT WAS with a heavy heart like many more that I woke on March 12 to news of the tragic loss of Tony Benneworth.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nA wonderful human being whose heart filled up a large part of the cavity of his chest.\n\nA sincere, jovial, capable, caring, person whose friendly disposition endeared him to all he met.\n\nAs past chairman of the Moonbeam Charity, he unselfishly donated his expertise yearly as an auctioneer at our annual dinner.\n\nAnd was instrumental in helping us raise hundreds of thousands of dollars for chosen charities.\n\nJovially he threatened castration if I ever forgot to make him a part of raising funds for needy children.\n\nHis contribution to Tasmanian cricket was enormous, his leadership qualities well known in bowls and politics.\n\nHe always led by example strengthening state cricket and playing for Australia, and always with a bigger than life personality\n\nHe took his expertise to make things better for the North by entering state politics and served with dignity and passion.\n\nMeeting Benny in the streets of Launceston was an absolute joy, his friendly persona was always present, and his good and bad jokes relentless.\n\nYou once told me, life was about peace of mind, a good job, a good wife and a good red wine and you had it all.\n\nI sincerely hope he retained that to the sad end, as the hole he has left in so many lives cannot ever be filled.\n\nCondolences to his beautiful family, I can only imagine your pain and loss.\n\nRest in peace.\n\nPeter Doddy, Trevallyn.\n\nDomestic Violence\n\nONE of the often sadly overlooked aspects of domestic violence is the care of animal companions when people are considering leaving violent relationships.\n\nThe research literature consistently highlights the fact that many people choose to remain in unsafe situations precisely because they do not have the financial resources to be able to find secure short term alternative care for their beloved animals.\n\nThey will not abandon them even though staying often places themselves, their children, and their animals at risk of escalating violence.\n\nIt is heartening to learn of the Pets in Crisis Program in Queensland, where there is a coordinated and holistic response by DVConnect Queensland, the RSPCA and the Queensland Government to ensure that a very real community need receives a fitting community solution.\n\nIt would be wonderful if Tasmanian social welfare agencies, in partnership with the RSPCA and the government, could instigate a similar initiative.\n\nTo do so would be an important recognition that for many people animals are part and parcel of their households and families, and members of the wider community.\n\nThomas Ryan, St Helens.\n\nPersecution\n\nCARMEN Frelek (Letters, March 8) have you not read a single thing about the Rohingya - the most recent genocidal atrocity committed by a government against its citizens? Razed villages, widespread murder and rape and the killing of children.\n\nIn the face of this - a tragedy that has been daily recorded in this newspaper for months on end - you still have the temerity to write: 'Surely the top priority of any government is to ensure its own people's needs are met first... (that) by fleeing their country and landing on another's doorstep is cowardly and does nothing to improve the living standards of those left behind.'\n\nDear brave Carmen if only they were like you - oblivious to the pain and suffering of others and with a protected and contented first world barrow to push. You have absolutely no idea how lucky and privileged you are. And how lucky are we to have you - the first person to man the barricades when the revolution begins.\n\nTony Newport, Hillwood.\n\nWorkers compensation\n\nWHAT has happened to Australia?\n\nNo state workers compensation insurance, I repeat no state workers compensation insurance in each state or territory, is required now under the current “work for the dole commonwealth scheme”.\n\nIt seems that members of our community, who are unable to obtain current employment, are now being considered as non-employees, even when they qualify as employees under our state workers compensation statute act.\n\nWe should all remember this action by the Commonwealth government, when under the RED. Scheme (of long ago), state workers compensation insurance was included and applied to all workers under the RED Commonwealth scheme.\n\nF. Deane, Evandale.\n\nGun Age\n\nJack Sonnemann, Lucaston.\n\nWolf Grey\n\nLeonard Colquhoun, Invermay.\n\nGun Laws\n\nI JUST saw our Premier on the news announcing that he will push ahead with the watering down of the gun laws, as he has a mandate.\n\nSince when has a policy, put out on the eve of the election without giving anyone a chance to absorb it, become a mandate?\n\nOn the radio even some landowners hadn't heard of this and weren't in favour but our Premier is determined.\n\nLet's hope that he is not becoming somewhat autocratic.\n\nGlennis Sleurink, Launceston.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
