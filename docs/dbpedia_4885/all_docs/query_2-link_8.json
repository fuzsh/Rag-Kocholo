Because I am tied up preparing for the WA Senate election, I won't have an opportunity to provide any commentary on the progress of the count. You can follow the progress of the count at the link to the Commission's website in the next paragraph.)\n\n(Thursday 20 March: For technical reasons, the ABC's Tasmanian election site cannot currently be updated with results. However, counting since Sunday has had little impact on the position of candidates and parties. If you want to see updated results, click here to visit the Tasmanian Electioral Commission website.\n\nMy only additional note on the commentary below is that Labor Party scrutineers claim that enough votes leak out of the Liberal ticket in Braddon to make it more likely that Labor's Brenton Best will win a second seat for Labor rather than the final seat being won by a fourth Liberal.\n\nThe relative positions of parties will become clearer next Tuesday when the first preference count is finalised and the surpluses of candidates polling more than a quota are distributed.)\n\n(Monday 17 March - results have been updated with Sunday counting but there is no significant change to the analysis based on Saturday night's final count.)\n\nAt the end of counting on Saturday night, the make up of the new Tasmanian House of Assembly is 14 Liberals, six Labor and three Greens, with the final seats in Braddon and Lyons undecided.\n\nAt the moment the most likely final result looks like 15 Liberal, seven Labor and three Greens, the next most likely 14/8/3.\n\nCheck counting as well as the inclusion of absent and additional postal votes will continue next week. The final determination of first preferences, the setting of a quota and the beginning of the distribution of preferences cannot begin until the cut off date for the receipt of postal votes which is 10am on Tuesday 25 March.\n\nThe likely outcome in each electorate based on election night votes is set out below.\n\nBass\n\nWith 85.6% of the vote counted, the Liberal Party are on 3.44 quotas, Labor 1.40 quotas, the Greens 0.75 quotas with 0.40 quotas with other parties and ungrouped candidates.\n\nLiberal Peter Gutwein has polled 1.41 quotas and Michael Ferguson 1.34 quotas. Both will be declared elected on the first count. Their surpluses will be distributed and determine which of Sarah Courtney 0.28 quotas, Barry Jarvis 0.24 and Leonie McNair 0.17 win the third Liberal seat. Sara Courtney would be favoured.\n\nOn the Labor ticket Michelle O'Byrne has polled 0.64 quotas and will be elected, while Kim Booth 0.61 quotas should get his vote above 0.70 quotas when the other green candidates are excluded. The second placed Labor candidate Brian Wightman has 0.50 quotas, but it is unlikely that the exclusion of other Labor candidate would allow both him and Michelle O'Byrne to get ahead of Booth.\n\nBooth is well placed to win the last seat in Bass for the Greens, leaving the result as three Liberal, one Labor one Greens, the Liberal Party gaining a seat from Labor.\n\nFor full results in Bass follow this link to the ABC election site.\n\nBraddon\n\nWith 84.2% of the vote counted, Braddon may yet produce the extra-ordinary result of 4 Liberal and 1 Labor.\n\nOn the first preferences the Liberal Party has polled 3.53 quotas, Labor 1.40, Palmer United 0.43 and the Greens 0.40 with 0.23 with other parties and ungrouped candidates. On these party numbers, the Liberals win three seats, Labor one, with the Liberal Party best placed with the highest remainder beyond filled seats to win a fourth seat.\n\nThat becomes an even greater possibility when you look at the votes by candidate. The leading candidates are Liberal Adam Brookes 1.52 quotas, Liberal Jeremy Rockliff 1.39, Labor's Bryan Green 0.62, Labor's Brenton Best 0.34, Green Paul O'Halloran 0.30, then Liberals Roger Jaensch on 0.29 and Joan Rylah with 0.25.\n\nIt is highly likely that the distribution of the surpluses of Brookes and Rockliffe, as well as the exclusion of the fifth Liberal candidate, will put both Jaensch and Rylah ahead of every other candidate except Bryan Green. In those circumstances, both have stronger chances of winning election than either Brenton Best or Paul O'Halloran.\n\nIn the old 7-member days, Braddon was the only electorate to ever return five members for one party, for Labor in 1972 and Liberal in 1992. In 2014 it may set a new record in electing four member, which would give the Liberal Party 15 of the 25 members in the House.\n\nFor full results in Braddon follow this link to the ABC election site.\n\nDenison\n\nIn party terms, Denison will be the only unchanged electorate. With 77.7% counted, the Liberal Party has 2.26 quotas, the Labor Party 2.05 quotas and the Greens 1.29 quotas. The electorate will again split 2 Liberal, 2 Labor, 1 Green.\n\nLabor's Scott Bacon has 1.37 quotas, Liberal Matthew Groom 1.27, Green Cassy O'Connor 0.93 and second sitting Liberal MP Elise Archer 0.62 quotas. All four will be re-elected.\n\nWith the retirement of Labor's Graeme Sturgess, the election of the second Labor candidate is a lottery which will be determined by preferences from Scott Bacon's surplus. The four other Labor candidates have between 0.14 and 0.20 quotas, which looks like randomised Labor linear votes produced by the rotation of candidates on the ballot paper. Presumably Bacon's surplus may be less random than Labor's first preference votes.\n\nFor full results in Denison follow this link to the ABC election site.\n\nFranklin\n\nWith 76.9% counted, the seat of the three party leaders will return three Liberals, one Labor and one Greens, the Liberal gain coming at the expense of Labor's David O'Byrne.\n\nWill Hodgman has polled 35.0% or 2.10 quotas, the highest percentage vote ever polled by an Opposition Leader. The only higher percentages were by Premiers Doug Lowe, Robin Gray and Jim Bacon.\n\nLara Giddings has 0.99 quotas, Nick McKim 0.80, David O'Byrne 0.52 and Liberals Jacquie Petrusma 0.40 and Paul Harriss 0.33. Giddings and McKimm will be elected on the party vote, Petrusma and Harriss will be elected on Hodgman's surplus, leaving David O'Byrne without a seat.\n\nFor full results in Franklin follow this link to the ABC election site.\n\nLyons\n\nWith 80.4% of the vote counted, Lyons is another electorate where the Liberal Party has gained a third seat. In the case of Lyons, this is most likely to be at the expense of the Greens.\n\nThe Liberal Party have 3.13 quotas, Labor 1.66, Green 0.67, Palmer United 0.33 and others 0.21. On the party totals it looks a close race between Labor and the Greens for the final spot, but the break up of votes by candidate gives Labor an advantage.\n\nThe three elected Liberal MPs will be Rene Hidding 1.00 quotas, former Senator Guy Barnett 0.88 as the new member, and sitting MP Mark Shelton on 0.74.\n\nLabor's Rebecca White will be elected having polled 0.78 quotas, with David Llewellyn on 0.47 and likely to benefit from preferences from Bob Gordon on 0.25 quotas.\n\nThe Greens Tim Morris has polled 0.46 quotas, short of Llewellyn, and even if he gets his total up to the Green total of 0.67 quotas, he is in danger of being overtaken by David Llewelyn as Rebecca White is unlikely to reach a quota until the very end of the count.\n\nSo the last seat in Lyons remains in doubt, though Labor is favoured to win the final seat rather than the Greens.\n\nFor full results in Lyons follow this link to the ABC election site.\n\nComments\n\nYou were wrong when you told me that ABC online would be telecasting the full Tasmanian election coverage uninterrupted. ABC24 online cut in and out of the Tasmanian coverage so your simple answer of 'Yes' was incorrect.\n\nCOMMENT: Out of my control I'm sorry. If I'd said no would it have made you any happier?\n\n- annoyed March 16, 2014 at 04:08 PM\n\nHere's a weekend to highlight that Hare-Clark in Tasmania is at least as capable of producing (and as likely to produce) decisive results as single-member-electorate systems (e.g. SA) with all their vagaries of wasted votes in safe seats, marginal-seat sandbagging etc.\n\nThank you Antony for your valuable unbiased reporting on all of the above. An intense election season.\n\n- Andrew Gunter March 16, 2014 at 04:12 PM\n\n....I wouldn't have had such a deflationary emotional moment at 6pm on election night?\n\nAnyway, I combined online radio 936 plus ABC24 online, so I suppose that was good enough in the end.\n\ncheers.\n\n- not-so-annoyed-anymore March 17, 2014 at 10:45 AM\n\nHad a quasi Hare Clark system been used in SA can we safely assume Libs would have won?\n\nCOMMENT: No you couldn't assume that though it would have been quite possible.\n\n- Robert Davidson March 17, 2014 at 11:33 AM\n\nMy view of the same data, Andrew Gunter, is just the opposite. I love Hare-Clark, but when a 51.4%+ PRIMARY vote only just gets you into majority Government when the other 2 seat winning parties get 27.4% and 13.5% it is smoothing the vote/seat relationship.\n\nExpressed slightly differently one party has got 55.7% of the primary vote of seat winning parties. Depending on the cut up it would be quite possible for this to be 14 seats in 25 seat house. Take out the speaker and its a 1 seat margin (13/11) on the floor of the house.\n\nGiven the \"house\" result I would suggest it is far from \"at least as capable of producing decisive results\" as single member electorates.\n\nThank you Antony (as always) you make a real contribution to the strength of Australia's democracy.\n\n- David Owens March 17, 2014 at 12:35 PM\n\nAntony. Would Hare Clarke or similer ? solve the above the line voting problem and help resolve the Senate voting shambles.? Currently we Oz look like going the way of so many Italian Parliaments.\n\nWould appreciate your informed opinion.\n\nCOMMENT: Taking the whole of Hare-Clark and applying it to the Senate is difficult because a system that works well in a small state in choosing five members from an electorate of 70,000, but does not scale up to electing six members from 4 million votes in NSW. Randomising candidates on a ballot paper becomes an artifice in a situation where the vast majority of voters are going entirely on party name rather than any knowledge of the candidates.\n\nMore likely is keeping above the line voting, banning the tickets, but allowing voters to express preferences for more than one party.\n\n- John Sutherland March 17, 2014 at 05:02 PM\n\nIs there any sensible way of analysing the voting data so as to estimate what would have been the result if the House still had 35 seats, with 7 per electorate?\n\nCOMMENT: Yes. Divide the total votes by 8 rather than 6 to get a quota, then divide the votes for all candidates by this new quota and work on from there. The last seat still needs some views on how preferences work, but the exercise is pretty straight forward.\n\n- Joshua March 18, 2014 at 10:36 PM\n\nIs it odd that no independents were elected? I would have thought that with focus on candidates rather than parties and having multimember electorates would give them an advantage (compared with other states).\n\nCOMMENT: It is very rare for Independents to be elected in Tasmania.\n\n- Josephine March 19, 2014 at 06:12 PM\n\nAntony, you are obviously overstretched. I was the Minister who got the Robson Rotating Bill passed in Tassie and pushed like crazy (but tactfully) for its successful introduction in the ACT. Hare Clark is pretty good because it inhibits the chance that political factions within parties can play winner take all. In single member systems, factional hacks or factional darlings get safe seats and the other, often talented, get the swinging seats and thus go in and out with the electoral tide and have no seniority (which is why Whitlam inherited a dick-headed, old cabinet that was there because of seniority). You have already noted that a fairly high prportion of Tasmanians moving around between party columns and within party columns (up to 28%) are critical. Good? Hare Clark's weakest point is the tendency for candidates competing within electorates with their own party to neglect their ministerial duties.\n\nCOMMENT: I think the one weakness that occurs is with by-election re-counts. The last candidate of a party who misses the final seat and remains unexcluded can be disadvantaged in the re-count. The most recent example was the defeat of Tony Benneworth by David Fry following Frank Madill's resignation in 2000. Benneworth had been the last candidate standing in 1998, while Fry had been excluded, so Fry benefited by getting his first preferences back on Madill's exclusion, where Benneworth had to rely on preferences from Madill for any chance of election.\n\n- Terry Aulich March 19, 2014 at 08:23 PM\n\nThanks, Antony. Based upon the currently available figures, I did as you suggested and, if the election had been held under the former arrangement with 7 members per electorate, calculations indicate that the Liberals would have gained 20 seats, Labor 11 and Green 4. The closest contest would have been in Denison, as to whether the Greens would gain a second seat there at Labor's expense.\n\n- Joshua March 20, 2014 at 04:20 PM"
