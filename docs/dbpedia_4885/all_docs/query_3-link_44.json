        "text": "Recently, policy communities in many countries have come to view universities as the knowledge base at the heart of the knowledge economy (eg OECD, 1996; for the United Kingdom, see DTI, 1998; DTI/DfES, 2001; DfES, 2003; Porter and Ketels, 2003). Many national governments have recognised the crucial role played by universities in the economy as powerful drivers of innovation and economic change.\n\nUniversities are increasingly encouraged to take a leading role in economic development, particularly through innovation. Simultaneously, economic development policy itself is increasingly focused on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), creating overlapping interactions in the roles of government policy, universities and SMEs and the processes of innovation creation and dissemination. This paper examines issues arising from these developments and relating to the key stakeholders (industry, government and universities in particular), the enabling mechanisms (network governance, relevant education, training and learning, and suitable structures), and local and cross-local links. The authors then use quantitative analysis of 450 SMEs in the UK to begin to evaluate the roles of universities and highlight areas for further theoretical development.\n\n\"This study considers the linkage between micro-sized enterprises and other organizations, especially universities, in relation to the innovation process. The focus of the research is on non-start-up enterprises in Wales and how they develop their products. The research methodology adopted is a thematic literature review and the case study approach. The findings demonstrate that there are additional barriers to innovation in terms of legislation and regulation when micro-sized enterprises endeavour to overcome their knowledge gap through collaborating with universities. It is noted that there has been minimal research examining the knowledge gap encountered by micro-sized enterprises and how they attempt to overcome the barriers to collaborating with universities\""
