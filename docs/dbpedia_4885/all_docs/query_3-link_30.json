While Keynes and his followers directed their attention and energy first and foremost to a criticism of Say's law, Sraffa and his followers did so with respect to marginal productivity theory. However, as the paper shows, Sraffa's criticism implies also a rejection of Say's law. The main focus of the paper is the route by means of which Sraffa arrived at his analysis and to ...\n\nLooking for stability: Repercussions of the Russian revolution in the work of John Maynard Keynes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSvoboda FrantiÅ¡ek\n\n2017-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper analyses and proposes an answer to the question of how the Russian revolution is reflected in the work of John Maynard Keynes. The starting point of the analysis is an interesting yet not very well known episode of the economistâs life: a period when Keynes, then a British Treasury official, was entrusted with the task of creating a currency for Northern Russia. The ensuing design and architecture of the North Russian rouble virtually became an opportunity for Keynes to put into practice some of his general currency-related ideas, and the entire project influenced Keynesâs economic thought in two specific ways. First, the Russian experience can be traced in the economistâs reflections on two fundamentally different financial policies: the inflationary approach adopted by the Bolsheviks, and the anti-inflationary strategy of the British government. Keynes made use of his experience with the Russian hyperinflation in a multitude of his works, especially in the papers on inflation and its consequences. Second, certain elements of the project influenced the actual formation of Keynesâs view on the function and balancing of the international monetary markets. This part is based on monitoring the continuity of thoughts and actions, starting from India Currency and Finance and ending with the North Russian rouble and the design of the bancor.\n\nJohn Maynard Smith\n\nIndian Academy of Sciences (India)\n\nHome; Journals; Resonance â Journal of Science Education; Volume 10; Issue 11.

The paper compares Marx and Keynes, and aims to show that the difference in treatment of the major economic issues between them is not as significant as one may expect. Marx and Keynes held some ideas in common with neo-classical economists especially in the sphere of microeconomics, and they differ from neo-classical economists significantly in their approach to both: macroeconomic issues and their consequences for a society as a whole. They predicted wars in the future, and were speaking about a new, and global world! That is why those giants of economic thought deserve to be re-approached and reexamined, especially as the events of our age remind us of no small extent of the times when they had written\n\nThe Contribution of J.M. Keynes to the Analysis of the Psychological Motives of Economic Behavior\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMaria A. Kozlova\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article examines the contribution of John Maynard Keynes to the study of the psychological motives of economic behavior. The origins of the analysis of the psychological motives in economics before Keynes are reviewed. The relative importance of rational and irrational motives of economic behavior in the Keynesian theory is analyzed. It is shown that Keynes's analysis of the behavior of the economic agents under uncertainty and the lack of information contributed to the elaboration of the bounded rationality theory by Simon. The article also describes the input of Keynes to the formation of a new Â«KeynesianÂ» model of human behavior, which implies the importance of expectations, taking into account the psychological and social factors of economic behavior. The main psychological tendencies in the actions of the consumers and investors described by Keynes (the basic psychological law, liquidity preference, the influence of the Â«market psychologyÂ» on the investor's decisions and their relevance nowadays are examined. The article shows further development of the ideas of Keynes in the Akerlof and Shiller's theory of animal spirits and in the financial instability hypothesis of Minsky. It also gives a description of a confidence multiplier, introduced by Akerlof and Shiller, and shows how the cosumers' confidence can be measured nowadays. Besides, the article stresses that the study of the psychological motives of economic behavior, undertaken by Keynes, contributed to the development of such new disciplines at the interface between the economy and psychology as the economic psychology and behavioral economics.\n\nAn anatomy of the concept of time in Maynard Keynes\n\nDEFF Research Database (Denmark)\n\nMadsen, Mogens Ove\n\n2014-01-01\n\nattention to the concept of time and subsequent alternative method of analysis has led to a number of innovations in economic thinking.

Keynes and His Economic Theory: an Ethical Perspective\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nStanislav N. Ivaskovsky\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The article examines the philosophical and moral foundations of the biggest economist and political philosopher of the 20th century John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946, who played an important role in rethinking a number of important provisions of the classical political economy and in creating the ideological and methodological basis of the \"Keynesian revolution\" and of the new field of economic analysis-macroeconomics. The author traces the main stages in the formation of ethical views of Keynes, shows that his interest in ethics as the system of values in society was dictated by the need for the new conceptual vision of economic realities and by the search of an answer to the main ethical question: \"What should we do?\". Attention is drawn to the fact that an understanding of the ethical orientation of economic theory by Keynes allowed him to take a critical stance towards traditional individualism and Victorian morality of thrift and moneymaking and to conclude that rational and \"right\" forms of individual behaviour are not a guarantee of the prosperity of society as a whole. To achieve the latter Keynes justified the necessity of \"central control\" by the State of the overall level of aggregate expenditure. It isstressed that the ethical views of Keynes correspond with the concept of the \"ethic of responsibility\"- a relatively new scientific discipline, which originated as a response to the risks of technogenic era: pollution, resource constraints, overpopulation, lack of stability of the world economy. The final part of the article analyzes one of the most important, from the point of view of Keynes, vices of capitalism - reckless proclivity of people to the multiplication of \"abstract monetary wealth\". It is shown that it doesn't only disfigure the psyche and consciousness of people, but also changes the direction of development of the market economy towards \"speculative capitalism\", which creates a threat to civilization, creativity, well\n\nClÃ¡ssicos versus Keynes: a abordagem formal de David Champernowne\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nClÃ¡udia Heller\n\n2012-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Este texto tem por objetivo ressaltar um aspecto que nÃ£o tem sido tratado com a devida profundidade na literatura que estuda a formalizaÃ§Ã£o da Teoria Geral do Emprego, dos Juros e da Moeda de John Maynard Keynes (1936. Mais precisamente, o texto destaca a estratÃ©gia de formalizaÃ§Ã£o adotada por David G. Champernowne em seu artigo intitulado \"Unemployment, Basic and Monetary: the classical analysis and the keynesian\", publicado em 1935-36 na Review of Economic Studies. Chamamos a atenÃ§Ã£o para o fato dele distinguir a teoria clÃ¡ssica da teoria de Keynes nÃ£o apenas pelos pressupostos adotados por cada teoria, mas principalmente pela construÃ§Ã£o de subsistemas a partir de um sistema geral, com caracterÃ­sticas recursivas (relaÃ§Ãµes de causalidade distintas.

M. Keynes: Background, Methodology and Specific Interpretations\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNureev Rustem, M.\n\n2016-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The paper was prepared for the 80-th anniversary of publishing of John Maynard Keynesâ âGeneral Theory of Employment, Interest and Moneyâ. It discusses the stages of the economistâs life, the main books written prior to \"The General Theory ...\". Particular attention is devoted to the development issues of the monetary policy in the works of \"Indian Currency and Finance\", âA Tract on Monetary Reformâ and \"A Treatise on Money\". A special section is dedicated to the analysis of Keynesâ methodology, its logic and structure, influenced by John. E. Moore. The paper reveals the unity and the difference in approaches of A. Marshall and John M. Keynes, and explores new categories of behavioral economics and marginal analysis, which established the success of \"General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money\", shows the value of Keynes's theory for the further development of macroeconomics. Particular attention is paid to the popularization of Keynes's ideas from the initial interpretations of \"The General Theory ...\" to the neoclassical synthesis and further to neo-Keynesianism and post-Keynesianism. The paper studies the unity and the distinction between Hicksâ and American Keynesianism. Hicksian assumptions of a savings-investment function have determined the features of the IS-LM model. The contributions to the development of Keynesianism A. Hansen and P. A. Samuelson are also shown, as well as the history of the \"Keynesian Cross\". A comparative analysis of the neoclassical and Keynesian models of general economic equilibrium is given and analyzes the institutional reasons explaining differences between neoclassical and Keynesian paradigms. A special section is devoted to the Keynesian theory of growth, showing unity and difference of R. Harrod and E. Domar models, along with their impact on the creation of Development Economics. Simplified understanding of Keynes's legacy has caused the emergence of unorthodox Keynesianism. The paper\n\nContinuidade ou ruptura? Uma anÃ¡lise de alguns aspectos da filosofia social de John Stuart Mill, Alfred Marshall e John Maynard Keynes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLAURA VALLADÃO DE MATTOS\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available O artigo argumenta que Ã© possÃ­vel se falar em uma 'tradiÃ§Ã£o' no campo de filosofia social e econÃ´mica unindo as obras de J.S. Mill e Alfred Marshall e J.M. Keynes. Essa 'tradiÃ§Ã£o' pode ser caracterizada pelas seguintes concepÃ§Ãµes: (a pela rejeiÃ§Ã£o moral aos valores aquisitivos do capitalismo; (b pela visÃ£o de que o sistema capitalista seria incapaz de resolver de forma espontÃ¢nea as questÃµes das desigualdades de renda e riqueza e da pobreza; (c pela ideia de que, por uma questÃ£o de garantia de liberdade e da diversidade, alÃ©m de por questÃµes de eficiÃªncia econÃ´mica, dever-se-ia deixar a iniciativa individual agir livremente nas esferas em que Ã© capaz de engendrar bons resultados, mas que o Estado deveria intervir, quando essa falha, atuando em benefÃ­cio da coletividade; (d pela crenÃ§a de que seria possÃ­vel melhorar significativamente esse sistema por meio de mudanÃ§as pontuais e graduais.\n\nMaynard Smith: amplifying the reasons for signal reliability.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nHarper, D G C\n\n2006-03-21\n\nOne of the many questions to which John Maynard Smith contributed was that of why most animal signals are reliable. He initially rejected the \"handicap\" argument but gradually accepted it, a process I briefly describe. This episode illustrated his preference for mathematical models over verbal ones, and the generosity with which he could change his mind. Even after accepting that some signals are reliable because of their strategic costs, he argued for a pluralistic approach to signal reliability. Signal complexity was a developing interest when he died. Signals usually involve several components, some of which appear to amplify other signal components. The terms \"amplifier\" and \"index\" require more thought to reduce the scope for semantic confusion. I conclude by describing Maynard Smith's fascination with peacocks Pavo cristatus.\n\nAmerican Influence on Post-World War I Recovery of Germany\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\n2015-06-12\n\nnumerous committees involved in these plans.

(As Keynes is in Franco Modigliani?\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLuigi Pasinetti\n\n2012-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Modigliani ebbe percezione dellâimportanza della Teoria Generale di Keynes ancor prima di incominciare a studiare economia. Dopo essere diventato economista di professione, grazie alla sua ricerca, sia teorica che applicata, il suo insegnamento, le sue raccomandazioni a combattere la disoccupazione di massa, Modigliani divenne noto a livello mondiale come uno dei piÃ¹ grandi economisti keynesiani. Eppure vi sono molte componenti essenziali della Teoria Generale di Keynes che nei lavori di Modigliani non si trovano. In questa lezione si mostra come il suo sforzo â per usare una sua espressione â di âdigerireâ le idee innovative di Keynes nella piÃ¹ tradizionale teoria walrasiana porti alla perdita delle idee piÃ¹ genuinamente rivoluzionarie di Keynes. Lâautore sostiene â riferendosi anche ad alcuni ricordi personali â che la convinzione di Keynes della necessitÃ di costruire una nuova âteoria monetaria della produzioneâ rimane rilevante oggi quanto lo era allâepoca in cui venne proposta. PiÃ¹ che cercare di âdigerireâ la rivoluzione keynesiana, dovremmo cercare di portarla pienamente a compimento.Â Â Â Modigliani was perceived importance of the General Theory of Keynes even before begin to study economics. After becoming an economist by profession, thanks to his research, both theoretical and applied, its teaching, its recommendations to combat mass unemployment, Modigliani became known worldwide as one of the greatest Keynesian economists. Yet there are many essential elements of the General Theory of Keynes that in the works of Modigliani are not. In this lesson we show how his effort - to use his own expression - to \"digest\" the innovative ideas of Keynes in the more traditional Walrasian theory lead to the loss of more genuinely revolutionary ideas of Keynes. The author claims - referring to some personal memories - that the belief of Keynes to the need to build a new \"monetary theory of production\" remains as\n\nBack to the future with Keynes\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nLee E.

On the other hand, Keynes's forecast of empl...\n\nKeynes y el empleo\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nHÃ©ctor Ruiz RamÃ­rez\n\n2013-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Keynes, al igual que Marx y la escuela ortodoxa (clÃ¡sica y neoclÃ¡sica, supone libre concurrencia en el mercado de productos, pero a diferencia de todos ellos, asume un mercado de trabajo imperfecto, en el cual los salarios se negocian en tÃ©rminos nominales y no reales, evidenciando asÃ­ un desempleo involuntario. Igualmente, Keynes postula una rigidez en el mercado de capitales que limita la expansiÃ³n del empleo, no solo en el corto plazo, sino tambiÃ©n en el largo plazo, aun cuando el beneficio sea todavÃ­a positivo. Mientras los clÃ¡sicos sostenÃ­an la idea de precios y salarios flexibles, Keynes seÃ±alaba lo contrario, es decir, rÃ­gidos e inflexibles. Para Keynes, la causa del desempleo era la insuficiente demanda agregada y que el desempleo no se corregÃ­a con una reducciÃ³n de salarios, sino con una mayor demanda. Este fue su postulado bÃ¡sico para explicar el empleo.\n\nO retorno de Keynes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFernando Cardim de Carvalho\n\n2009-03-01\n\nFull Text Available A crise econÃ´mica atual colocou em questÃ£o o desenvolvimento da teoria macroeconÃ´mica das Ãºltimas duas ou trÃªs dÃ©cadas. O rÃ¡pido e profundo desmoronamento dos mercados financeiros depois de 2007 e a recessÃ£o iniciada em 2008, cujo final Ã© ainda impossÃ­vel de se vislumbrar, levaram Ã crÃ­tica da teoria ortodoxa e Ã redescoberta de argumentos associados a Keynes, que muitos julgavam um autor superado. Este artigo lista as linhas bÃ¡sicas do pensamento de Keynes que o tornam uma ferramenta muito superior para o entendimento da crise atual do que a ortodoxia das Ãºltimas dÃ©cadas.One of the first casualties of the current economic crisis was orthodox macroeconomic theory, particularly the strand known as New Classical Economics, developed in the last two to three decades. The deep and quick collapse of world financial markets in 2007, and the recession initiated in 2008, with no end in sight, allowed a vigorous critical reexamination of orthodox theories and the revival of the economics of Keynes in the process. This paper presents the fundamental propositions that define Keynes's approach.\n\nKeynes: o liberalismo econÃ´mico como mito Keynes: the economic liberalism as a myth\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPedro Cezar Dutra Fonseca\n\n2010-12-01\n\nFull Text Available O artigo tem por objetivo recuperar os principais argumentos de Keynes em suas crÃ­ticas ao liberalismo econÃ´mico, este entendido como as teorias e prÃ¡ticas de polÃ­tica econÃ´mica adotadas pelo mainstream no campo da CiÃªncia EconÃ´mica e simbolicamente respaldado na mÃ¡xima do laissez-faire. Embora as obras de maior fÃ´lego de Keynes situem-se no campo da economia teÃ³rica, hÃ¡ trabalhos seus que permitem detectar sua ideologia e, mais explicitamente, o teor de sua crÃ­tica ao liberalismo clÃ¡ssico. O ensaio mostra que, em um mundo polarizado entre o nazi-fascismo e a experiÃªncia stalinista soviÃ©tica, Keynes articula uma visÃ£o muito particular em rejeiÃ§Ã£o a ambos e em defesa da democracia representativa e da livre iniciativa. Todavia, com possÃ­vel respaldo no pragmatismo filosÃ³fico, o liberalismo econÃ´mico Ã© entendido como uma construÃ§Ã£o mÃ­tica e incompatÃ­vel com o capitalismo do sÃ©culo XX.This paper aims at highlighting Keynes' main arguments in his criticism of economic liberalism, conceived of as the theories and the praxis of economic policy adopted by the mainstream thinkers in the field of economics and symbolically based on the laissez-faire approach. Although Keynes' ultimate works are in the field of economic theory, a number of them show his political line of thought, more evidently his criticism of classical liberalism. The paper demonstrates that, in a world polarized between nazi-fascism and the Soviet Stalinist experience, Keynes articulates a very peculiar view against both, in favor of a representative democracy and a free market economy. However, possibly based on philosophical pragmatism, economic liberalism is seen as a myth that is not compatible with 20th century capitalism.\n\nIl dono di Keynes per lâordine economico internazionale\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMario Cedrini\n\n2014-03-01\n\nFull Text Available The rediscovery, in the times of the crisis, of John Maynard Keynesâs proposals for postwar reform of the international economic order invites historians of economic thought to clarify the purposes of Keynesâs international diplomacy.

Taking his starting point at the macroeconomic level, Keynes argued that economic systems are characterized by fundamental uncertainty - an uncertainty that makes rule-based behaviour...... and reliance on monetary magnitudes more optimal to the economic agent than profit- and utility optimazation in the traditional sense. Unfortunately more systematic studies of the properties of such a system was not possible at the time of Keynes. The system envisioned by Keynes holds a lot of properties...... in commen with what we today call complex dynamic systems, and today we may aply the method of agent-based computational economics to the ideas of Keynes.

In the \"General Theory,\" the focus is on short-term fluctuations, i.e., business cycles, but Keynes fails to provide any theoretical explanation as to why the depression of the 1930s was so severe and intractable. In the 1937 article, the depression is seen as the result of the combined effects of a decline in longrun growth due to population growth decline and a shortrun cyclical decline, together producing severe economic consequences. What is important for the purposes of this discussion is the implication, within the context of the 1937 article, that not only was the stock market crash of 1929 related to population change (with its accompanying collapse in expectations) but that, in general, changes in the rate of growth of population are accompanied by stock price movements in the same direction. The remainder of the discussion is devoted to a simple empirical test of this relationship. The data used are population size (POP), defined as the total residential population in the US from 1870-1979, and the Standard and Poor 500 Stock index (SP) for the corresponding 109-year period. In addition, a 3rd series was constructed, a price deflated Standard and Poor index (RSP) with a base period of 1870, to account for possible inflationary distortion of the index. The empirical results do not invalidate the hypothesis that population growth rates affect equity markets.

Kholopov\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The Keynes' \"General Theory\", published 80 years ago, overthrew the neoclassical orthodoxy and created a new understanding of how market economy works. The main idea of the \"General Theory\" is that the amount of employment depends on the level of effective demand. Keynes believed that much economic activity is governed by \"animal spirits\" because of the existence of inescapable uncertainty about the future. In Keynes' view these \"animal spirits\" are the main cause for economic fluctuations. The uncertainty and \"animalspirits\"make investments unstable. He made distinction between risk (which is measurable and uncertainty (which is not. This is the reason why Keynes opposed the excessive mathematicization of economics. His another important impact on economics was to switch the focus of economic analysis from the long run to the short term. The message of \"General Theory\" was that government should manage demand to limit economic fluctuations. The role Keynes gave the state was essentially to reduce uncertainty and to make economy more predictable.\n\nMarx, Keynes y la posibilidad de crisis Marx, Keynes and the Possibility of crisis\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKenway Peter\n\n1992-12-01\n\nFull Text Available En este artÃ­culo Peter Kenway plantea que las teorÃ­as desarrolladas por Marx y Keynes para explicar el funcionamiento de la economÃ­a capitalista son complementarias. Debido a la existencia del dinero, en Marx la crisis econÃ³mica es siempre una posibilidad que puede ocurrir cuando una ruptura en el circuito del capi tal separa el acto de compra del de venta. Esta posibilidad emerge de la anarquÃ­a de la producciÃ³n capitalista, su caracterÃ­stica fundamental, y plantea interrogantes sobre el nivel de\n\ndemanda requerido para realizarla. La teorÃ­a de la demanda efectiva en Keynes sostiene que la crisis ocurre cuando los flujos y escapes de inversiÃ³n no proveen la demanda\n\nagregada suficiente para realizar el producto. SegÃºn el autor la caracterÃ­stica comÃºn a ambos enfoques es asÃ­ el\n\nintento por construir una teorÃ­a monetaria de la producciÃ³n capitalista, en la que la teorÃ­a de la posibilidad complementa la de la demanda efectiva en la explicaciÃ³n de porquÃ© el dinero desempeÃ±a un papel operativo en el proceso de producciÃ³n. A su vez, la teorÃ­a de la demanda efectiva complementa a la teorÃ­a de la posibilidad para explicar el nivel de demanda que se requiere para la realizaciÃ³n del producto entre los diferentes departamentos de la\n\neconomÃ­a.

(Yale)\n\n2010-03-02\n\nIn his lecture, Shiller will discuss the premise of his 2009 book, coauthored with the Nobel Prize-winning economist George A. Akerlof. Winner of the getAbstract International Book Award and the 2009 TIAA-CREF Paul A. Samuelson Award for Outstanding Scholarly Writing on Lifelong Financial Security, the book, which has the same title as Shiller's lecture, discusses how \"animal spirits,\" or human emotions such as confidence, fear, and a concern for fairness, drive financial events, including today's global financial crisis. John Maynard Keynes coined the phrase \"animal spirits\" to describe the changing psychology that led to the Great Depression and the recovery from it. Like Keynes, Shiller and Akerlof believe that government intervention is necessary to overcome the adverse effects on the economy brought about by unruly and irrational human emotions. In his talk, Shiller will explain how \"animal spirits\" lead to adverse economic effects, and he will outline his insights on how the global economy can recover from its recent setbacks.\n\nLA ESTRUCTURA LÃGICA DE LA TEORÃA GENERAL DE KEYNES\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nCarlo Benetti\n\n2000-12-01\n\nFull Text Available El objetivo de este artÃ­culo es la construcciÃ³n de la teorÃ­a de Keynes, concebida como una estructura compuesta por tres modelos generales y de base que se deducen unos de otros.

Marglin\n\n2018-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Keynesâs General Theory argues there is no self-regulating mechanism that guarantees full employment. Keynesâs vision has been distorted by mainstream Keynesians to mean that it is the warts on the body of capitalism, not capitalism itself, that are the problem: frictions and imperfections and rigidities may interfere with the mechanism for self-regulation that inheres in the perfectly competitive model. This distortion has two supposed corollaries, first, that the more the economy resembles the textbook model of perfect competition, the less likely are lapses from full employment; second, that since imperfections are limited to the short run, so are lapses from full employment.Keynes was unable to convince the economics profession that the problem is capitalism; that the warts, real though they are, obscure a more fundamental problem. The reason is that Keynes lacked the mathematical tools to substantiate his vision. This paper deploys tools that were unavailable to Keynes, in order to lay the foundations of a Keynesian macroeconomics for the 21st century.

A abordagem da complexidade tem como uma idÃ©ia central a de que as aÃ§Ãµes individuais promovem conseqÃ¼Ãªncias nÃ£o intencionais como resultado de um processo de auto-organizaÃ§Ã£o, permitindo o funcionamento do sistema. Keynes explorou tal idÃ©ia, por exemplo, na elaboraÃ§Ã£o do paradoxo da poupanÃ§a, na anÃ¡lise da formaÃ§Ã£o das expectativas e na incorporaÃ§Ã£o do efeito multiplicador. Destaca-se que a complexidade do sistema econÃ´mico, segundo a perspectiva de Keynes, comeÃ§a com a complexidade do ser humano. Por fim, sustenta-se que a visÃ£o de Keynes do sistema econÃ´mico como um organismo complexo teve a influÃªncia do filÃ³sofo G. E. Moore.This paper claims that some elements of the complexity approach, which has been recently applied to economics, were already contained in Keynes' economics, and argues for the fecundity of an interaction between them. One of the central ideas of the complexity approach is that individual actions have unintended overall consequences as a result of a self-organization process, which allows the functioning of the system. Keynes played around with the idea of unintended consequences of individual actions, for instance, in the formulation of the paradox of parsimony, in the analysis of the expectations formation, and in the inclusion of the multiplier effect. It is argued that the complexity of the economy, from Keynes' perspective, is firstly related to the complexity of the human being. Also, it is suggested that Keynes' view of the economy as a complex organism was influenced by the philosopher G. E. Moore.\n\nClÃ¡ssicos e keynesianos: primeiros passos no mundo da macroeconomia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEvandro BrandÃ£o Barbosa\n\n2013-07-01\n\nFull Text Available o estudo do pensamento dos economistas clÃ¡ssicos e de Keynes tende a apresentar complexidade Ã queles que, sendo iniciantes no universo das CiÃªncias EconÃ´micas, deixam de realizar leituras sistematizadas sobre as Escolas EconÃ´micas, porque pretendem compreender, por exemplo, as diferenÃ§as entre os clÃ¡ssicos e Keynes com simplicidade e generalizaÃ§Ã£o, sem prestar atenÃ§Ã£o aos detalhes das diferentes correntes de pensamento.

He was also skillful in depicting phenomena in small format in encyclopÃ¦dias, journals and newspapers. This article presents Heckscher as portrait maker of economic scholars. In these portraitsâwhat he emphasized, what he praised, what he criticizedâone can discern the stance of the portrait maker himself. Overall, his portraits are permeated by admiration of sharp theoretical analyses and massive economic historical investigations. He admires the founding fathers of political economy, Adam Smith and David Ricardo, stresses continuity in the development of economic thought, praises humble innovators like David Davidson, Knut Wicksell and Alfred Marshall and denounces (what he perceives as pretentious innovators like Gustav Cassel and John Maynard Keynes. He is critical towards economists who attempt to break out of the classical and neoclassical tradition, especially representatives of the German historical school, and what he judges to be a new type of mercantilism, represented by Bertil Ohlin and Keynes. At the same time he appreciates voluminous and solid investigations into economic history, even if performed without theoretical beacons, by scholars like William Cunningham, William Ashley, John Clapham, Marc Bloch, Richard Ehrenberg and Werner Sombart.\n\nCapital controversy in the birth of macrotheory: the Keynes-Hayek exchange in retrospect\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nGilberto Tadeu Lima\n\n2000-09-01\n\nFull Text Available A close historical inspection shows that many theoretical issues occupying contemporary macroeconomists surfaced in the Keynes-Hayek debate in the early 1930s. This paper, however, focuses only upon some capital-theoretic issues involved in that debate, this being done with a view to tentatively evaluate to what extent some theoretical conclusions advanced in Keynes' Treatise on Money are undermined by Hayek's capital-theoretic objections. It is submitted that a major source of disagreement between them regards the role played by monetary factors in the process through which eventual disequilibria between investment and saving lead to changes in the price level. Keynes argued that such disequilibria may lead to changes in the price level even if the amount of money in circulation remains constant, whereas Hayek claimed that changes in the price level arising from such disequilibria will be necessarily accompanied by proportional changes in the amount of money in circulation.Um exame histÃ³rico minucioso demonstra que vÃ¡rias das questÃµes que atualmente ocupam os macroeconomistas emergiram no debate travado por Keynes e Hayek no inÃ­cio dos anos 1930. Este artigo, entretanto, focaliza somente algumas questÃµes associadas Ã teoria do capital que emergiram naquele debate. Seu objetivo Ã© avaliar em que medida certas conclusÃµes tiradas por Keynes no Tratado da Moeda foram minadas pelas crÃ­ticas de Hayek baseadas na teoria do capital. O artigo sustenta que uma fonte importante de discordÃ¢ncia entre Keynes e Hayek diz respeito ao papel desempenhado por fatores monetÃ¡rios no processo atravÃ©s do qual eventuais desequilÃ­brios entre investimento e poupanÃ§a acarretam mudanÃ§as no nÃ­vel de preÃ§os. Enquanto Keynes argumentava que tais desequilÃ­brios podem ocasionar mudanÃ§as no nÃ­vel de preÃ§os mesmo quando o volume de moeda em circulaÃ§Ã£o permanece constante, Hayek acreditava que as mudanÃ§as no nÃ­vel de preÃ§os geradas por esses eventuais\n\nKeynes, investment, unemployment and expectations\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nSmith, Ron P.; Zoega, Gylfi\n\n2009-01-01\n\nIn Keynes' General Theory, investment determines effective demand, which determines unemployment and the labour market plays a negligible role.

Keynes was also a leading bibliographer of literary figures from Sir Thomas Browne to William Blake through Jane Austen. This article argues that these endeavors did not inhabit separate worlds, but rather his bibliographic methods of collecting and sorting were deeply interwoven with his therapeutic practices and medical ways of knowing. The article also examines the profound influence his engagement with the works of William Blake had on his battle against the reigning medical orthodoxy and on the humanity of his relationship with his patients. It concludes that Keynes' story sheds light on a now distant medico-cultural world where literary studies, often centered on book collecting and critique, were not only highly valued, but were influential in guiding the vision and behavior of a number of physicians.

Keynesâ formulation of the general macroeconomic equilibrium was proceeded over the years by a broader reflection on the nature of the capitalistic economic system, the individual motivations that sustain it and its ethical aspects in comparison to other systems. However, there is almost no trace of this in General Theory, if not only partially in the last chapter of the book. To rebuild these aspects we must refer to a relatively neglected group of essays from 1925 to 1928 that concern the nature of the capitalist system more broadly.

La especificidad de la teorÃ­a de Keynes respecto a Wicksell se deriva de la constataciÃ³n segÃºn la cual la teorÃ­a cuantitativa tradicional sÃ³lo se verifica en el equilibrio monetario.

A familiar account of the last financial crisis underlines the collapse of confidence and evaporation of trust which leaded to failure of corporate governance and easy money policy. Nor were these problems of recent origin; they were rooted in deep structural changes in the economy that date back many years. Financial innovations overheated the world economy and gained steam because of irrational exuberance over a risk free better future. Considering the evidence analyzed in this paper work, this approach of economic crisis through animal spirits puts forward new highlights of economic thought.\n\nÂ¿Tenemos algo que aprender de Keynes ahora?\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTorrero MaÃ±as, Antonio\n\n2016-01-01\n\nEste Documento de Trabajo se corresponde con el material preparado para la intervenciÃ³n en la InstituciÃ³n Libre de EnseÃ±anza el 28 de septiembre de 2016 En este breve ensayo el profesor Torrero plantea la vigencia del pensamiento de Keynes en la actualidad, especialmente en tres puntos: el exceso de ahorro o el dÃ©ficit de inversiÃ³n; la existencia de instituciones financieras privadas con sus propias normas y los problemas que se derivan de ello; y, la importancia de la incertidumbre.

MILONE\n\n2013-10-01\n\nFull Text Available When studying Keynesâ ideas regarding protectionism, scholars have traditional focused on the relevance that he attached to trade policy interventions geared towards macroeconomic objectives. Specifically, he was concerned with the role of the balance of payments as a constraint on full employment. Less attention has been devoted to keynesâ ideas on trade policy aimed at microeconomic objectives. These are the subject of the present paper, with a particular focus on industrial policy objectives as framed by Keynes within the UK/US negotiations between the 1930s and 1940s.Â Â JEL Codes: E12, F13, L52Â\n\nComportamento racional e formaÃ§Ã£o de crenÃ§as em Keynes\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nRicardo Henriques\n\n2000-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Este artigo procura discutir a relaÃ§Ã£o entre racionalidade e crenÃ§a para analisar o significado dos processos de tomada de decisÃ£o de longo prazo no pensamento de Keynes.

The classical economists--Adam Smith, Thomas Malthus, Karl Marx, John Stuart Mill and John Maynard Keynes appreciated this fact, and their reviews are recounted and their prescience is assessed. Adam Smith (1723-1790) was primarily concerned with the desire of humankind to better his/her material conditions. Although he did not put forward a specific population policy, the tenet of his writing is pronatalist. Economic advantages would accrue to parents by the production of many children. Yet, underneath Smith's optimism, there was an apocalyptic vision of the distant future, i.e., the \"steady state\" when resources would be depleted or near exhaustion, when capital accumulation would have ceased, and living standards would be dropping vertiginously. In his 1st \"Essay on Population\" Malthus maintained that \"the power of population is infinitely greater than the power of the earth to produce subsistence of men.\" Malthus can be complimented on his prescience. There is little question that the planet of today is grossly overpopulated and that a great gulf exists between numbers of people and their aspirations and the resources which the earth can provide for them. Malthus was particularly concerned about the population food dilemma, and that is still much in evidence in 1982. 2 concomitants of overpopulation--excessive urbanization and joblessness--could not be foreseen by Malthus. Marx did not deny the basic tenet promulgated by Malthus but to him this was simply an artifact of capitalist society which required \"enormous reserves of proletarians\" in order to maintain its odius system. Officially Communist governments remain in a Marxist straitjacket regarding the population issue. Mills approach was strongly antinatalist; he saw little need for an increase in human numbers. Mills was concerned that because of unlimited population growth and wealth the earth would lose much of its\n\nEmerging markets and the international financial architecture: a blueprint for reform\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nJAN KREGEL\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available If emerging markets are to achieve their objective of joining the ranks of industrialized, developed countries, they must use their economic and political influence to support radical change in the international financial system. This working paper recommends John Maynard Keynes's \"clearing union\" as a blueprint for reform of the international financial architecture that could address emerging market grievances more effectively than current approaches. Keynes's proposal for the postwar international system sought to remedy some of the same problems currently facing emerging market economies. It was based on the idea that financial stability was predicated on a balance between imports and exports over time, with any divergence from balance providing automatic financing of the debit countries by the creditor countries via a global clearinghouse or settlement system for trade and payments on current account. This eliminated national currency payments for imports and exports; countries received credits or debits in a notional unit of account fixed to national currency. Since the unit of account could not be traded, bought, or sold, it would not be an international reserve currency. The credits with the clearinghouse could only be used to offset debits by buying imports, and if not used for this purpose they would eventually be extinguished; hence the burden of adjustment would be shared equally - credit generated by surpluses would have to be used to buy imports from the countries with debit balances. Emerging market economies could improve upon current schemes for regionally governed financial institutions by using this proposal as a template for the creation of regional clearing unions using a notional unit of account.\n\nMethodological solipsism and kaleidoscopic worlds of Ludwig Mauritz Lachmann\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBazhenov Grigory, A.\n\n2015-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Among the Austrians fifth generation occupies a special place disciple of Friedrich A. von Hayek, economist, distracting from the overall flow of the Austrians, Ludwig M. Lachmann. Using the framework of his theory of the fundamental assumptions of the Austrian School (individualism, subjectivism, Lachmann did not try to pull them under the base of normative conclusions about the structure of the economic system of society, but rather, an attempt to build a more rigorous theory of the social world order. German economist, recognizing the importance of the concept of subjective value, pay attention to its insufficiency and stressed the need to incorporate to construct a theory of subjectivity expectations that brings his views with the views of John Maynard Keynes. Following George Shackle Ludwig Lachmann believes that the economy is similar to a kaleidoscope: the elements of economic reality are in constant rearrangement, creating continuously changing each other short-lived and unstable patterns. The author of the paper analyzes the concepts and ideas of Ludwig M. Lachmann, noting both the strengths and weaknesses of his theory.

This is a global crisis of capital accumulation, which is caused by insufficient global demand. The author analy - ses the theoretical output of John Maynard Keynes, MichaÅ Kalecki, Paul Baran and Paul Sweezy. The post-war âGolden Ageâ of the capitalist economy ended in 1973 with a de - ep stag flation of the 70s and 80s. Capitals searching for profitable investment, started to be invested in financial speculation, growing since the 80s. This speculation was enabled on a global scale by the Washington Consensus in the 90s. The explosion of financializa - tion of the global economy began. The author presents the analyses of Paul Sweezy and Harry Magdoff, who argued that this was financialization of global accumulation of ca - pital in a form of world financial speculation. This process was completed by the finan - cial crash in 2008, which was the implosion of global speculative balloons.

Economics was initially studying ways and means of achieving wealth. The essence of wealth has changed dramatically in people's minds after the first and the second industrial revolutions. The world today is on the verge of the third industrial revolution (according to Jeremy Rifkin, or, as it is called by many scientists, the new tenor of technology. In the history of any civilization comes the moment of a radical direction change for new prospects or endangered. Not all civilizations were able to transform in time. However, in the past, the effects of civilizations collapse were limited in time, space, and never addressed the species. Currently, the high probability of temperature and planet geochemistry changes as a result of climate change can lead to mass extinction of animals, plants, and people. Humanity has the ability to transit into a stable post-carbon era in the middle of the century and to prevent catastrophic climate change. Currently, sustainable development is the mechanism used to achieve the ultimate goal of any country, enterprise and human development, which is wealth. Under controlled sustainable development we understand the system unity of not only economic, social, environmental, but also resource, technological, institutional activities, as well as a permanent interaction between development and economic safety.\n\nKeynes y la crisis financiera actual: reflexiones a la luz de su luz de obra\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nTorrero MaÃ±as, Antonio\n\n2012-01-01\n\nLa obra de Keynes me parece inspiradora para analizar la crisis financiera internacional por los cuatro motivos siguientes: Era un experto en finanzas.

He strongly disapproved of the longstanding dogma of so called radical mastectomy in breast cancer, and advocated a more limited surgical approach, followed by radiation therapy. This was done more than fifty years before breastconserving surgery has become the therapy of choice and against considerable opposition from the surgical establishment of his days. He also became a pioneer in the surgical treatment of myastenia gravis by thymectomy, at a time when there was no real understanding of the pathophysiology of the disease and when considerable controversy existed as to the importance or non importance of concomitant tumour formation in the thymus. Besides being a busy surgeon Sir Geoffrey was a medical historian, writing the biography of among others William Harvey, a bibliographer with a special interest in the poet and artist William Blake and a bibliophil with a large book collection of great value to medical history.\n\nPOLITICAS E REFORMAS EDUCACIONAIS NO CONTEXTO NEOLIBERAL\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nZelina Cardoso\n\n2009-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This work has been prepared through bibliographic search to give focus to the influences of neoliberalism and international organizations in educational policymaking.

The neoliberal philosophy, although it has been defended Friedrich Von Hayek in l945, only took strength in the mid-1970s, when collapsed economic liberalism system of John Maynard Keynes. In the years 1980 many countries, especially Latin American were in debt crisis and with that came on the scene, the World Bank debt management, as well as to promote the development of countries through external funding; The World Bank, to identify in education a human development factor, treat it as a fundamental part of funding agreements. To this end adopted tough measures for the reduction of public spending, compulsory education State responsibility only for basic education, directing education for the private sector, subject to the laws of the market. Measures were recommended to the complete reform of the educational system and the role of the State in its administration and funding, aimed at improving the quality, equity and efficiency.

The Shock Doctrine in Russia, China and Romania\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nLUCIAN-ÅTEFAN DUMITRESCU\n\n2011-03-01\n\nFull Text Available Initially, the theoretical foundation of the International Monetary Fund was inspired by the economic vision of John Maynard Keynes, who argued that the state may resuscitate economic life when it undergoes a downturn. If the state proved unable to restart its national economy, the International Monetary Fund would intervene, and it would not only grant loans meant to revive the economy, but also recommend infrastructure investments, the decrease of interest rates in order to resume crediting and the reduction of taxes in order to decrease the pressure on the private sector in a quasi-immovable economy. In the 1980s, Keynesian ideas were withdrawn from the theoretical foundation of the International Monetary Fund and replaced by the neo-liberal vision. According to the new economic philosophy, the International Monetary Fund would grant loans only if the states in need reduced their budget deficits, increased taxes and interest rates. In other words, instead of boosting economic activity the new IMF practices were restricting it even more. In the rest of the work we will present, using the social constructivism paradigm and the strategic identity concept, the social consequences of neo-liberal ideas in Russia, China and Romania. The shock doctrine is the state of social disorder imposed from outside, as a result of the political gap between the states of the world.\n\nPOLÃTICA FISCAL E DÃVIDA PÃBLICA: UMA ABORDAGEM TEÃRICA A PARTIR DE KEYNES E ABBA LERNER\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nRenato Vaz Garcia\n\n2010-01-01\n\nLa polÃ­tica fiscal de los gobiernos nacionales es un importante instrumento de polÃ­tica econÃ³mica, ya que contribuye directa o indirectamente al crecimiento y el desarrollo econÃ³mico.

There is an anecdote which is worth mentioning. âJohn Maynard Keynes, recognized at the inaugural meeting of the International Monetary Fund was confused by the names he thought the Fund should be called a bank, and the World Bank should be called a bottom. Confusion has reigned ever since. The Bank and the IMF are two intergovernmental pillars supporting the structure of economic and financial worldâ. The fundamental difference between the two is understood as: the Bank institution primarily for the development, while the IMF is a cooperative institution that seeks to maintain an orderly system of payments and receipts between nations. The manner followed to choose the head of each organization has a different procedure, but the important thing is that in the next few years, several countries such as Brazil, India have more active participation and Latin America as a group may perhaps lead some of them.\n\nFundamentos macroeconÃ´micos nas perspectivas de Marx e Keynes: contribuiÃ§Ãµes para a heterodoxia\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPEDRO GARRIDO DA COSTA LIMA\n\n2016-09-01\n\nFull Text Available RESUMO: A necessidade de definir fundamentos microeconÃ´micos para os modelos macroeconÃ´micos, presente no pensamento dominante na economia contemporÃ¢nea, pode ser questionada com base em diferentes abordagens teÃ³ricas.

G.; Spadaro, J. V.; Oikonomou, E.; Davies, M.; Wilkinson, P.\n\n2015-11-01\n\nDwellings are a substantial source of global CO2 emissions. The energy used in homes for heating, cooking and running electrical appliances is responsible for a quarter of current total UK emissions and is a key target of government policies for greenhouse gas abatement. Policymakers need to understand the potential impact that such decarbonization policies have on the indoor environment and health for a full assessment of costs and benefits. We investigated these impacts in two contrasting settings of the UK: London, a predominantly older city and Milton Keynes, a growing new town. We employed SCRIBE, a building physics-based health impact model of the UK housing stock linked to the English Housing Survey, to examine changes, 2010-2050, in end-use energy demand, CO2 emissions, winter indoor temperatures, airborne pollutant concentrations and associated health impacts. For each location we modelled the existing (2010) housing stock and three future scenarios with different levels of energy efficiency interventions combined with either a business-as-usual, or accelerated decarbonization of the electricity grid approach. The potential for CO2 savings was appreciably greater in London than Milton Keynes except when substantial decarbonization of the electricity grid was assumed, largely because of the lower level of current energy efficiency in London and differences in the type and form of the housing stock. The average net impact on health per thousand population was greater in magnitude under all scenarios in London compared to Milton Keynes and more beneficial when it was assumed that purpose-provided ventilation (PPV) would be part of energy efficiency interventions, but more detrimental when interventions were assumed not to include PPV. These findings illustrate the importance of considering ventilation measures for health protection and the potential variation in the impact of home energy efficiency strategies, suggesting the need for tailored policy\n\nOs Modelos de Keynes e Kalecki e o Investimento Produtivo no Brasil: 1980/90\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDirceu Grasel\n\n2011-04-01\n\nFull Text Available O debate sobre a perspectiva de manutenÃ§Ã£o de uma taxa adequada de crescimento econÃ´mico aponta as seguintes razÃµes para justificar o reduzido volume de investimento: deficiÃªncia de demanda efetiva; restriÃ§Ãµes na disponibilidade de fundos para investir; e o desenvolvimento incipiente de ciÃªncia e tecnologia.

In this system of thought, the main philosophy of which is budget balance, that asserts that there is flexibility between prices and wages and regards public debt as an extraordinary instrument, the interference of the state with the economic and social life is frowned upon. In line with the views of the classical thought, the classical fiscal policy is based on three basic assumptions. These are the \"Consumer State Assumption\", the assumption accepting that \"Public Expenditures are Always Ineffectual\" and the assumption concerning the \"Impartiality of the Taxes and Expenditure Policies Implemented by the State\". On the other hand, the Keynesian School founded by John Maynard Keynes, gives prominence to demand, adopts the approach of functional finance, and asserts that cases of underemployment equilibrium and over-employment equilibrium exist in the economy as well as the full employment equilibrium, that problems cannot be solved through the invisible hand, that prices and wages are strict, the interference of the state is essential and at this point fiscal policies have to be utilized effectively.Keynesian fiscal policy depends on three primary assumptions. These are the assumption of \"Filter State\", the assumption that \"public expenditures are sometimes effective and sometimes ineffective or neutral\" and the assumption that \"the tax, debt and expenditure policies of the state can never be impartial\".Â\n\nRicardo, Marx y Keynes ante la Ley de Say : fundamentos microeconÃ³micos de esta ley y de su crÃ­tica\n\nOpenAIRE\n\nPosada Posada, Carlos Esteban\n\n1980-01-01\n\nEl objetivo del presente artÃ­culo estÃ¡ expresado sintÃ©ticamente en el tÃ­tulo, refiriÃ©ndose entonces, a las relaciones lÃ³gicas existentes entre: A) Las teorÃ­as ricardiana, marxista y Keynesiana de los precios y B) La posiciÃ³n de Ricardo, Marx y Keynes con respecto a dicha Ley.

The special attention, along with the analysis of the ideas of the founder of original theory of the state intervention in the economic life of the society of John Maynard Keynes (1883-1946, is given to âneoliberalâ economic constructions of an ideological orientation of Friedrich August von Hayek (1899-1992 and Milton Friedman (1912-2006, defenders of a liberal principle of self-regulation of economy, free from any regalements. The author, on the basis of the analysis of primary sources and examples from a political and social life of some States, shows that in theory the resurgence of liberalism in the form of neo-liberalism personified the idea of the priority of the individual to society and the State, the market - before planning and regulation, the human rights - before the power authority and the team. However in practice this revival was accompanied by displacement of accents and growth of ideological tendencies. Thus, theorists and practitioners of neo-liberalism lined up quite utopian model not only of economic, but also of social relations. Article details the mechanisms by which the theoretical constructions of economists-neoliberals were emasculated by politicians who gradually reduced them to the primitive and convenient theses, justifying any actions of the authorities. Over time, these points have become âundeniable truthsâ, through which neo-liberalism became dogmatic, and its economic credo has got obvious fundamentalist character, having turned to market dogma of totalitarian type.\n\nThe Heppner-Maynard Boundary measured by SuperDARN as a proxy for the latitude of the auroral oval\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nImber, S. M.; Milan, S. E.; Lester, M.\n\n2013-02-01\n\nWe present a statistical study relating the latitude of the auroral oval measured by the Imager for Magnetopause-to-Aurora Global Exploration (IMAGE) SI-12 proton auroral camera to that of the Heppner-Maynard Boundary (HMB) determined from Super Dual Auroral Radar Network (SuperDARN) data during the period 2000-2002. The HMB represents the latitudinal extent of the ionospheric convection pattern. The oval latitude from the proton auroral images is determined using the method of Milan et al. (2009a), which fits a circle centered on a point 2Â° duskward and 5Â° antisunward of the magnetic pole. The auroral latitude at midnight is determined for those images where the concurrent SuperDARN northern hemisphere maps contain more than 200 data points such that the HMB is well-defined. The statistical study comprises over 198,000 two-minute intervals, and we find that the HMB is located on average 2.2Â° equatorward of the proton auroral latitude. A superposed epoch analysis of over 2500 substorms suggests that the separation between the HMB and the oval latitude increases slightly during periods of high geomagnetic activity. We suggest that during intervals where there are no auroral images available, the HMB latitude and motion could be used as a proxy for that of the aurora, and therefore provide information about motions of the open/closed field line boundary.\n\nPragmatismo e economia: elementos filosÃ³ficos para uma interpretaÃ§Ã£o do discurso econÃ´mico\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPaulo Gala\n\n2006-09-01\n\nFull Text Available Partindo do debate atual sobre retÃ³rica em economia, o trabalho tem por objetivo trazer elementos da corrente filosÃ³fica do pragmatismo para a discussÃ£o metodolÃ³gica entre economistas, particularmente no que diz respeito Ã teoria da verdade e suas implicaÃ§Ãµes epistemolÃ³gicas. ApÃ³s apresentar as contribuiÃ§Ãµes dos pioneiros da filosofia pragmatista, William James, John Dewey e Charles Sanders Peirce, e discutir aspectos da obra de Willard Quine e Richard Rorty, procura identificar influÃªncias dessa corrente filosÃ³fica em importantes economistas tais como John M.
