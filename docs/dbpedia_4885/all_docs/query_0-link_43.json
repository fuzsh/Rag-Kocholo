        "text": "Citation preview\n\nPan-­Caribbean Integration\n\nA critical part of the history of regionalism in Latin America and the Caribbean is to be found in the widening of the economic and functional relationships among the English-­speaking Caribbean to embrace other countries in the Greater Caribbean. Bringing together a range of international experts to explain the broad thrusts of CARICOM’s Widening Project and the opportunities and challenges it presents, the book pays particular attention to CARICOM’s relations with the French Caribbean territories. Providing a review of the pan-­Caribbean landscape this volume notes the impact of these new relationships on internal CARICOM affairs; inter-­regional/South–South cooperation; and political and legislative changes in European metropoles of the non-­independent territories. It also contemplates recent developments in the region and globally, such as political instability in Brazil and Venezuela, Britain’s decision to leave the European Union and the policies of the Donald Trump administration. This edited collection will be an important resource for students and researchers in Latin American and Caribbean politics, economics, development, history and heritage.

Shaw\n\nThe International Political Economy of New Regionalisms Series presents innovative analyses of a range of novel regional relations and institutions. Going beyond established, formal, interstate economic organizations, this essential series provides informed interdisciplinary and international research and debate about myriad heterogeneous intermediate-­level interactions. Reflective of its cosmopolitan and creative orientation, this series is developed by an international editorial team of established and emerging scholars in both the South and North. It reinforces ongoing networks of analysts in both academia and think-­tanks as well as international agencies concerned with micro-, meso- and macro-­level regionalisms.

The project, designed to reflect on the region’s experience 50 years after its first states gained their independence from Britain (Jamaica and Trinidad in 1962) and to project challenges and opportunities for the next 50 years, was organised around a group of research clusters. Out of this research initiative came the regional integration research cluster, headed by Patsy Lewis, which, in a conference in 2013 to commemorate the Caribbean Community’s (CARICOM) fortieth anniversary, brought together scholars from across the globe to reflect on CARICOM’s experience. This collection represents a development of some of the papers presented there. It was enriched by contributions from Sabine Manigat and Gloria Amezquita who addressed important themes that were not covered in the conference: Haiti’s relationship with CARICOM and the Dominican Republic’s (DR) restrictive immigration policy towards the children of Haitians born in the DR, respectively. Jessica Byron-­Reid and Patsy Lewis’s chapter, which presented a timely intervention on the bid by some European Overseas Territories to join CARICOM and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS) and to reflect on their experience in other regional organisations, first appeared in Danielle Perrot, 2014, Collectivites Territoriales Et Organisations Regionales: De l’indifference a l’interaction and is being republished here with the permission of Perrot and L’Harmattan publishers. We thank them for allowing us to include this chapter. We wish to thank Brian Meeks for his insight in launching this broad research project and in making SALISES resources available to support the work of our cluster and this conference. We wish to thank the members of our research cluster for their support and exchange of ideas. We also wish to thank the members of our conference organising committee, in particular Nadine Manraj-­ Newman, who provided critical support in liaising with our conference participants and, in the early stages, with our chapter contributors and the staff of SALISES, in particular Richard Leach, for their support before, during and after the conference. We also thank Jacqueline LaGuardia Martinez and Elizabeth Wilson and others who translated some contributions.\n\nAcknowledgements xvii We owe a special debt to Norman Girvan, who delivered the conference’s keynote address, which appears in this volume. Girvan generously agreed to deliver the address after Association of Caribbean States (ACS) director, Alfonso Múnera, who was scheduled to speak, was unable to attend. Beyond his contribution to this volume, we are indebted to Norman for his constant efforts to view the Caribbean in more expansive and less exclusive terms and his practical efforts as ACS director, to work towards this. We also wish to thank Jasmine Girvan for her support in ensuring that his chapter is included in this volume. Finally, we wish also to thank the anonymous reviewers of our manuscript proposal and our chapter contributors who have given their intellectual insights to this volume.\n\nAbbreviations\n\nACCP ACP

Jessica Byron\n\nIntroduction The Caribbean Community (CARICOM1), which emerged in 1973, was the continuation of a project to secure the independence of the former and extant colonies of Britain in the Caribbean, whose first iteration was the West Indies Federation (WIF ) (1958–1962). Thus, its primary concern was with integrating the economies of its members, pursuing functional cooperation across a wide range of areas and, in a more limited way, coordinating foreign policy. Its ambit widened in the early 1990s with the recommendation by the West Indian Commission (WIC), set up to review its goals towards the close of the twentieth century, that not only should the Community focus on deepening the process among its current members, but it should also seek to widen its membership. CARICOM’s role in the advancement of a pan-­Caribbean identity has rarely been documented in the literature. However, a critical part of the history of regionalism in Latin America and the Caribbean is to be found in the widening of the economic and functional relationships among the English-­ speaking Caribbean to embrace other countries in the Greater Caribbean, across linguistic and cultural lines. In particular, overtures from CARICOM and the Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS2) to Cuba in the 1970s, Haiti in the 1990s and the non-­sovereign territories in 2000s, tell an important part of the story of a changing landscape of regionalism in the Americas. This volume brings together a wide spread of chapters that capture the broad thrusts of CARICOM’s Widening Project and the opportunities and challenges it presents, with a particular focus on CARICOM’s relations with the French Caribbean territories, Haiti and Cuba. It is a review of the pan-­Caribbean landscape that notes the impact of these new relationships on internal CARICOM affairs; inter-­regional/South–South cooperation; and political and legislative changes in European metropoles of the non-­independent territories. It also contemplates more recent developments in the region and globally, such as political instability in Brazil and Venezuela, Britain’s decision to leave the European Union (EU) and the policies of the Donald Trump administration. Before providing an outline of the arguments made in each of the remaining 15 chapters, it is useful at this point to offer a brief historical review of the emergence of pan-­Caribbean regionalism.\n\n4 P. Lewis et al.\n\nThe CARICOM Widening Project The impetus for widening CARICOM’s engagement with the region can be located in the broader context that gave rise to the political union initiative among some states of the OECS in the late 1980s, and the Grand Anse Declaration, in 1989, which committed these countries to the creation of a Single Market and Economy (CSME). This was the need to reassess the regional integration project against the backdrop of a changed international environment and the perceived damaging outcomes for the region. These included the collapse of the Soviet Bloc and the end of the geopolitical basis on which their engagements with the US and Europe had been pursued; the embrace by the EU of a single economic market and the likely restructuring of the trade protocols of the Lome Convention; the negotiation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) which threatened to further erode some of their protections in the EU market; and the negotiation of the Canada-­US Free Trade Agreement and, later, the North American Free Trade Area (NAFTA), which they feared would undermine their protected access to the US market under the Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI) (Lewis 2002, pp. 8–9). The WIC’s recommendation to reach out to the wider region was an effort to reduce the isolation that CARICOM feared would result from these developments. The primary vehicle for widening CARICOM’s engagement with the region was the proposed Association of Caribbean States (ACS), which provided for various forms of membership for all 32 states and territories washed by the Caribbean Sea, including the non-­sovereign territories of the UK, France, the Netherlands and the US as well as the non-­CARICOM independent countries – Haiti, Suriname, the Dominican Republic (DR) and Cuba. The widening agenda had already been set, with requests from Haiti, Suriname, the DR and Venezuela for full membership in CARICOM. The rationale for the ACS was to provide a distinct forum for CARICOM’s engagement with the wider Caribbean (WIC 1992, p. 60), while leaving its inner core intact. In other words, CARICOM feared that broadening its membership to include other countries in the region comprising different language groups and much larger populations, threatened the organisation’s cohesiveness. Thus, the ACS would be the vehicle for managing trade and functional cooperation between CARICOM and its larger Caribbean counterparts (WIC 1992, pp. 59–63). The ACS’s ambition as a mechanism for expanding regional trade was stymied, however, by the prospect of the hemispheric Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA), negotiated between 1998 and 2004, and did not recover after the latter’s collapse. Its focus shifted to and has remained on issues related to the Caribbean Sea – a unifying motif for its members – sustainable tourism, disasters and transportation. CARICOM accepted Suriname’s bid for membership in 1995 and Haiti shortly thereafter3 but did not extend membership to the DR. Despite being accepted for membership in 1997, with accession in 2002, Haiti’s full integration within CARICOM has been problematic. Trade with CARICOM did not begin until 2004. In March 2004, CARICOM protested the extra-­constitutional\n\nCARICOM Widening Project 5 removal of President Aristide and his government’s replacement by the Gérard Latortue administration, by suspending its membership, reinstating it in July 2006 after elections brought the government of President René Préval to power. Despite CARICOM’s more active involvement with Haiti in the aftermath of the 2010 earthquake, Haiti is still not integrated into the CSME, especially in respect of the movement of skilled people. Some CARICOM countries maintain visa restrictions against Haitian nationals. Haiti’s integration, therefore, remains a work in progress. In preference to the full accession of the DR to CARICOM, the Community opted, instead, for a Free Trade Area (FTA) in goods (1998), with provision for future services liberalisation. Nevertheless, the formation of the Caribbean Forum of African, Caribbean and Pacific Group of States4 (CARIFORUM) in 1992 comprising CARICOM states, Haiti (before its accession to CARICOM) and the DR, driven by the impetus from the EU to streamline its operations in the region, brought the DR closer to the group. CARIFORUM was eventually located within the CARICOM Secretariat. The negotiation of the CARIFORUM–EU Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA), which saw the Regional Negotiating Machinery negotiating on behalf of the DR, appears to have undermined CARICOM’s tendency to keep the DR at arm’s length, with the DR relaunching its bid for membership in 2009. This was stalled, however, when CARICOM suspended consideration of the DR’s membership in protest over the Constitutional Court’s ruling in 2013 to withdraw citizenship from Dominicans of Haitian descent. Thus, the DR’s troubled relationship with Haiti continues to present challenges to its embrace by CARICOM, whatever the economic arguments in its favour and, even here, there is concern that its membership may have negative effects on smaller CARICOM economies. The WIC Report advocated an explicit engagement with Cuba, aimed at ending its isolation, bringing it within the Caribbean fold and agitating for an end to the US embargo (WIC 1992, p. 49). An outcome of this was a partial scope trade agreement in 2000. Cuba’s relationship with CARICOM has run longer and deeper with cooperation in education and health care delivery, including the provision of nurses and doctors, and the construction of health infrastructure. More recently, it has collaborated with Venezuela to deliver the Operation Miracle eye programme that provides screening and treatment for eye disease in individual CARICOM states and in Cuba, where necessary. CARICOM also established a number of trade agreements with other countries in Latin America between 1992 and 2004. These included partial scope agreements with Venezuela (1992) and Colombia (1994), and an FTA with Costa Rica (2004). Venezuela’s offer of a one-­way preferential FTA with CARICOM was part of a bid for a more direct engagement with CARICOM. More recently, promoted by the Hugo Chavez government and continued by President Nicolas Maduro, CARICOM–Venezuela engagement included the PetroCaribe Agreement, which provided cheap financing for Venezuelan oil for participants5 and Venezuela’s involvement, with Cuba, in Operation Milagros. The FTA was eclipsed by the Bolivarian Alliance for the Peoples of our\n\n6 P. Lewis et al. Americas (ALBA), initiated by the Chavez government and supported by Cuba, with six CARICOM states – Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, St Lucia, St Kitts/Nevis and St Vincent and the Grenadines – engaging as full members6 and another three – Haiti, Guyana and Suriname – as observers (i.e. observers). This relationship is not unproblematic, however, with long-­standing claims by Venezuela to a sizeable portion of the territory of Guyana, a CARICOM member, and related tensions have been resurrected by the Maduro government. Moreover, as Chapter 16 in this volume details, recent political and economic turmoil in Venezuela places the future of ALBA and the PetroCaribe arrangements in doubt. Brazil has played an important role in drawing the region more closely into broader subregional integration processes. Both Guyana and Suriname are members of Union of South American Nations (UNASUR), in which Brazil plays a major role. Their engagement in Initiative for the Integration of the Regional Infrastructure of South America (IIRSA) has provided the basis for their stronger physical integration into the continent, with the construction of bridge and road infrastructure, as has already been occurring between Brazil and Guyana. On the popular level and unsanctioned by the regional project, is the informal movement of people, which has led to the establishment of Brazilian communities in border towns in Guyana and a sizeable Guatemalan population in Belize. Brazil was also an important contributor to the collapse of the FTAA project and the move towards the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC), in which CARICOM countries are engaged. Brazil, under the Lula regime, expressed interest in broadening its engagement with CARICOM, participating in summits with regional leaders although, as Montoute and Abdenur detail in Chapter 15, this has slowed down subsequently. Between 1991 and 2003, the non-­independent British territories,7 with the exception of Montserrat, which was already a full member of CARICOM, became associate members and engaged in some of CARICOM’s functional arrangements, most notably, education. The subregional OECS, which brings together CARICOM’s smallest members, all considered Lesser Developed Countries (LDCs), with the British Virgin Islands (BVI) and Anguilla as associate members, was the platform for engaging with the French Caribbean, notably Martinique and Guadeloupe. Martinique became the OECS’s latest associate member in April 2016,8 with Guadeloupe accession negotiations underway. CARICOM’s Widening Project has also received a boost with expressions of interest in associate membership from a number of non-­independent entities in the French and Dutch Caribbean. These are Martinique, Guadeloupe, French Guiana from the French Caribbean and Curacao and St Maarten from the Dutch.\n\nStructure of the volume This volume brings together a wide spread of chapters that capture the broad thrusts of CARICOM’s Widening Project that embraces the wider Latin America region and some of the non-­independent territories of the Caribbean, and the\n\nCARICOM Widening Project 7 opportunities and challenges it presents. It also addresses their evolving South– South relations with Brazil, China and India. It is divided into five sections. The first includes the introduction and broad historical overviews by Norman Girvan and Percy Hintzen, laying the basis for a fuller understanding of the progress in pan-­Caribbean regionalism outlined across the volume. The second brings together four chapters that explore attempts by the French Caribbean territories as well as other sub-­state entities to be more closely integrated with regional organisations, the legal and political implications of this, and the opportunities the engagement presents for both sets of actors. The third section groups two chapters that touch on Haiti’s engagement with CARICOM and a third that explores the implications of the DR’s constitutional ruling to restrict the right of Dominicans of Haitian parents to Dominican citizenship. The fourth section focuses on CARICOM’s relationship with the broader Hispanic Caribbean. It assesses their engagement in more recent initiatives that transcend trade and the changing terrain of Cuba’s provision of fraternal assistance. The final section comprises three chapters that look at CARICOM’s relationship beyond the region and explores new developments that hold challenges for its engagement in the newer integration projects and with South–South cooperation initiatives, more generally, as well as with its diaspora; and new uncertainties introduced by the British decision to leave the EU and the election of Donald Trump to the presidency of the US. A feature of this collection is that it embraces academics and civil society representatives from across the region: Brazil, Cuba, English-­speaking Caribbean and its diaspora, Haiti, the DR and Martinique and Guadeloupe; representing universities and academic institutions such as: the University of the West Indies, the Université Antilles, University of Havana, Université d’Etat d’Haïti and the Université Quisqueya, Haiti, University of Toronto, Florida International University, the Igarapé Institute, in Rio de Janeiro, Oxfam and El Consejo Latinoamericano de Ciencias Sociales (CLACSO) – reflecting on challenges and possibilities of pan-­Caribbean regionalism and possibilities for alternative South–South forms of cooperation.\n\nPart I: The foundations of pan-­Caribbean regionalism In addition to the introduction, the volume opens with Norman Girvan’s chapter, ‘Constructing the Greater Caribbean’ which presents a broad historical sweep of a pan-­Caribbean project that charts the imagining of a pan-­Caribbean identity variously through literature and activism, drawing its inspiration from perspectives on race, class, resistance and economy. Girvan references a wide range of authors and activists who contributed to the attempt to construct a pan-­Caribbean identity, and in so doing suggests the cross-­pollination of ideas that contribute to an understanding of the region that transcends language and draws on its common history and Haiti’s special role in the construction of a pan-­Caribbean identity of resistance. Girvan places his own emphasis on culture as an avenue to Greater Caribbean integration to counter the centrifugal tendencies of post-­ independence nationalism.\n\n8 P. Lewis et al. Percy Hintzen’s chapter, ‘Diaspora, affective ties and the New Global Order: Caribbean implications’ which follows, provides the backdrop for understanding the growing influence of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS) in the region – a theme Montoute and Abdenur explore in detail in Chapter 15 – which he locates in the decline of European influence and the loss of US hegemony that has opened up spaces for these emerging actors. He also explores the unanticipated role of initiatives such as the US’s CBI and the EU’s Caribbean Forum (CARIFORUM) – meant to further their interests in the region – in fostering pan-­Caribbean integration, breaking down language and other barriers fostered by colonialism; and the increasing array of regional initiatives that bring the two groups out of their mutual isolation. He also privileges race in the construction of the region. Hintzen places particular emphasis on the role of the region’s diaspora in ‘challenging the logic of the state’ with the potential to break down barriers to regionalism and contribute to a broader pan-­Caribbean project. Moreover, he argues that historical migratory patterns in the region provide a connection between the Caribbean and these new emerging powers, in particular China and India.\n\nPart II: Confronting boundaries of formal sovereignty Jessica Byron and Patsy Lewis’s, ‘Responses to the sovereignty/vulnerability development dilemmas: small territories and regional organisations in the Caribbean’, presents a detailed insight into the working of three regional groups, CARICOM, its sub-­grouping the OECS and the ACS, in particular, the avenues they provide for the deeper integration of the autonomous and semi-­autonomous territories of the French, British and Dutch Caribbean. They explore the impetus behind these territories’ attempts at increased integration within the region in which they are located and the interests the groupings might have in accommodating their membership. They suggest that greater integration within regional groupings provides these territories with avenues for functional integration, especially around the Caribbean Sea, natural disasters, education, among others, which are less feasible for the European states with which they are constitutionally aligned to provide; but it also gives them access to a political platform, including in their relations with the latter, which they would not have otherwise. They observe that interest in these organisations, with the exception of the OECS, is coming at a time when they have been experiencing crises and propose that their embrace of the non-­ sovereign Caribbean territories could potentially inject life and strengthen the rationale for their existence. This is particularly important in CARICOM’s case as it re-­emphasises its role in functional cooperation and foreign affairs, which tend to be subordinate in the organisation’s deliberations. Byron and Lewis assert that while constitutionally bound to Europe, these non-­sovereign entities remain very much a part of the region and these regional organisations are important tools for overcoming some of the challenges of small size which they also face.\n\nCARICOM Widening Project 9 The two chapters that follow present differing perspectives on the implications of the accession of the French Caribbean territories to regional organisations. In Chapter 5, ‘The stakes of admitting the French Caribbean territorial authorities to CARICOM and the OECS’, Karine Galy presents a perspective from the French Caribbean territories on their rationale for seeking closer integration, the struggle they have waged to ensure this and the legal challenges involved. Galy suggests that the Départements d’outre-mer’s (DOM’s) quest for closer integration with the region is grounded in a perception of their identity as Caribbean people and their developmental needs which they believe would be better realised if they are more integrated in economic and functional relations with neighbouring countries. Their quest to join these organisations presented challenges for the French state as it meant their greater exercise of sovereignty considered the purview of the French state. The legal basis to facilitate this emerged over time and in response to a constant struggle waged by the territories. Nevertheless, their engagement in regional integration processes poses legal challenges as many sectoral programmes involve intertwined competencies by the local authorities (DOMS), the French state and the EU. She argues that this was a dilemma that the accession negotiations had to overcome. Galy concludes that the accession of the French Caribbean territories should lead to a further refining of French law and laws/regulations governing these regimes. Alexandra Petit, in the subsequent chapter, ‘A deeper regional incorporation for the French territories of the Americas: the shifting dynamics of French foreign policy’, presents a more realpolitik view of the regional engagement of the Caribbean French overseas territories. Petit argues that rather than representing autonomous action on the part of the overseas territories, their engagement in regional organisations actually strengthens the presence of the French state. While it satisfies the overseas territories’ interest in pursuing their ‘autonomous development policy’, she argues, it is also a deliberate aspect of France’s reconfigured foreign policy approach that is conducted at the European, state and local levels. In the specific context of Caribbean and Latin America, it allows France to differentiate among the various countries on the basis of their importance to France, facilitating the focus of its diplomatic resources on a small number of countries – such as Brazil and Mexico – more crucial to its interests. Thus, the overseas territories’ engagement with CARICOM and the OECS allows France to scale back its activities in this region, while boosting its visibility. Petit notes that France retains considerable strategic interest in its overseas territories, in general, because they constitute 96 per cent of its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). She observes that the legal basis for allowing overseas territories to gain ‘international competency’ is itself restrictive, limiting them to engaging with organisations within their geographical region as well as specified areas of functional cooperation, the majority requiring French approval and legal oversight. She concludes that the engagement of overseas territories in regional organisations is not independent of France but, rather, France and its interests remain present. The danger she identifies is that these French overseas territories may inadvertently be a channel for French policy in the region.\n\n10 P. Lewis et al. Fred Reno’s chapter, ‘The insularisation of a regional university: the case of the former UAG’ shifts the discussion to fragmentation tendencies in the French overseas territories, that led to French Guiana’s withdrawal from the regional Université des Antilles et de la Guyane (UAG), and the greater autonomy of Guadeloupe within the arrangement. Drawing on the experience of the regional University of the West Indies (which embraces all the CARICOM territories with the exception of Guyana), Reno interrogates the role of a university in developing a regional identity. He argues that, unlike the UWI, which notwithstanding challenges to its regional coherence over the years, the Universite des Antilles et de al Guyane (UAG) never had this as a conscious function and concrete programmes to promote regionalism and facilitate exchanges of faculty and students were few. Also, in contrast to the clear impetus to strengthen ties with European and North American institutions of higher education, there is no such conscious effort to do so with the UWI and, even where a dynamic academic programme exists with the UWI (and the University of Bordeaux), this is not emphasised. Despite not being explicitly stated, there is the danger that the movement towards insularisation that Reno identifies in this instance may well be strengthened by the overseas territories’ pattern of engagement within regional integration processes. Petit, for example, noted the concern of Guadeloupe’s Victorin Lurel, Minister for Overseas Affairs, that their decision to seek individual membership in regional institutions could lead to damaging competition between them.\n\nPart III: Haiti and the Dominican Republic: challenges to integration The three chapters that comprise this section focus on Haiti from different aspects of its engagement with the region. Sabine Manigat and Gloria Amezquita reflect on the challenges of Haitian migrants within CARICOM states and the DR. Manigat traces the myriad roots of Haiti’s relative estrangement from the CARICOM region, reflected in negative perceptions of Haitian migrants, which continue despite its formal accession to the organisation, while Amezquita discusses Haiti from the perspective of the neighbouring DR’s treatment of Haitians. Specifically, she assesses identity discourses and national myths within the DR and the divisions in that society on the ruling of the Constitutional Court to deny and revoke the citizenship rights of descendants of Haitian migrants born in the DR, an issue that halted the DR’s consideration for CARICOM membership. Bernard Phipps raises philosophical questions about CARICOM’s adoption of French, rather than Creole, as the second official language of the Community. Manigat’s chapter, ‘Haiti–CARICOM relations: between fascination and mistrust’, explores the historical roots of Haiti’s problematic relations with the region, located in the isolation it suffered after its 1804 revolution. These are evident in the treatment of Haitian migrants throughout the region and Haiti’s slow and halting embrace by CARICOM. Haiti still does not enjoy all the rights of full membership, despite being fully admitted in 2006, nor has it fulfilled all\n\nCARICOM Widening Project 11 its obligations of membership. She argues that the road towards Haiti’s integration is likely to be challenging but that its integration was inevitable. Bernard Phipps, in ‘French or Creole? Which second language for CARICOM?’, continues the debate on Haiti’s integration into CARICOM, this time from the perspective of language. In the context of CARICOM’s acceptance of French as its second official language, Phipps assesses arguments in favour and against either language but weighs towards supporting Creole as the more legitimate option. Paradoxically, while some CARICOM leaders addressed Haitian President Martelly in Creole, it was Martelly who responded in French and insisted that French should be a formal language of CARICOM. Implicit in Phipps’s chapter is the concern that the choice of French over Creole will continue to marginalise the majority of Creole-­speaking Haitians from the regional integration process. Gloria Amezquita’s chapter ‘Imaginary narratives about Dominicans of Haitian descent: media debates around Sonia Pierre and Juliana Deguis’, provides a commentary on the DR’s constitutional ruling denying citizenship to Dominicans of Haitian descent. She does this through chronicling the struggles of two women, thus shifting the problem from an amorphous group to allow for a more intimate perspective of how the life of the individual is affected. More importantly, the two case studies illustrate the divisions that exist in Dominican society, as represented in media debates and popular perspectives on the two cases. Although not speaking explicitly to the integration experience, Amezquita’s chapter helps to illustrate why CARICOM would find it challenging to admit the DR to membership while the citizenship matter remains unresolved.\n\nPart IV: Assessing initiatives in pan-­Caribbean regionalism This section shifts the focus from the French Caribbean to assess the challenges and possibilities of CARICOM’s engagement in integration initiatives with the Hispanic Caribbean and Latin America. It begins with Milagros Martinez Reinosa’s assessment of the evolution of CARICOM–Cuba relations and the likely direction this is going to take, followed by José Piedras’s, ‘Towards a new Latin American-­ Caribbean regionalism of solidarity’ and Antonio Romero Gomez’s, ‘Opportunities for CARICOM in ALBA, PetroCaribe and CELAC’, which explore newer regional initiatives that transcend a narrow focus on trade. Martinez Reinosa, in her chapter, ‘Cuba’s cooperation with CARICOM: from Grant Aid to Compensated Development Cooperation’, provides an insider perspective on Cuba’s shift towards greater reciprocity in its relationships with third countries, including CARICOM. This shift is occasioned by the effects on the economy and ultimately, the Cuban people, of three hurricanes in 2008, aggravated by the global economic crisis. Cuba has thus had to modify its approach to aid adopting myriad strategies that include working with other countries in the region, such as Venezuela, particularly in the provision of health care services; and with Brazil, Argentina and Norway, a country outside of the region, to assistant Haiti following the 2010 earthquake. The implications of Cuba’s shift to adopting the\n\n12 P. Lewis et al. principle of reciprocity in 2011, means that for CARICOM states, many of the services Cuba has provided will now be at a cost. The consequences for those CARICOM countries engaged with ALBA are likely to be less severe. Piedras examines what he terms CARICOM’s gradual participation in initiatives such as CELAC, ALBA and UNASUR which, he believes, is based on pragmatism reflecting their need to balance their interest in such schemes with their relationship with the US and Europe. Potential tensions lie in foreign affairs where their interests might conflict with those of their Latin American counterparts. He advocates a cautious approach on the part of Latin America in appreciating CARICOM’s concerns, as well as the centrality of consolidating their own integration scheme. Gomez, in his chapter ‘Opportunities for CARICOM in ALBA, PetroCaribe and CELAC’, extends this analysis by suggesting that initiatives such as ALBA, PetroCaribe and CELAC offer the opportunity for CARICOM to address broader social and economic challenges. This was already occurring under PetroCaribe, which addressed their need for a more affordable source of oil and ALBA, which offered possibilities for cooperation across a broad field that includes health, culture and telecommunications. Gomez sees mutual benefits to Latin America and the Caribbean from their participation in CELAC, suggesting that it could be a vehicle for addressing CARICOM’s concerns with size and the need for special and differential considerations in trade; high levels of indebtedness of middle-­ income countries, a category in which they fall; as well as infrastructure, climate change, disaster risk reduction and social development, among others. He observes that Latin American countries also stood to benefit from CARICOM’s participation in CELAC, given CARICOM’s expertise in tourism, culture and cultural industries, information communication technologies (ITC), telecommunications and e-­commerce. He concludes that CARICOM’s participation in wider regional initiatives could well be the basis for tackling the current crisis of implementation within which its integration process is enmeshed.\n\nPart V: Global and regional trends: implications for pan­Caribbean integration This section picks up on some of the key themes running through this collection, while reflecting on important developments regionally and globally and their likely implications for the region. Trotz’s chapter, ‘ “Far from home but close at heart”: preliminary considerations on regional integration, deterritorialisation and the Caribbean Diaspora’ focuses on the role of CARICOM’s diaspora, which Hintzen raised earlier. Trotz explores an oftentimes turbulent and ambivalent relationship between CARICOM states and their diasporas. Increasing attempts by governments to write their diasporas into economic policy, based on the large volume of remittances many receive, as well as halting and fleeting efforts by CARICOM to define a regional diaspora, speak to the increasing perceived importance of this group. Trotz explores the inherent pitfalls in this targeting of the diaspora as a resource to exploit in the interest of the state, warning that it could lead to a hierarchy of\n\nCARICOM Widening Project 13 diasporas that privileges those with resources at the expense of those who find it more challenging to survive in their adopted land, challenges that are likely to increase under the Trump administration – a theme explored in Chapter 16. Annita Montoute and Adrian Erthal Abdenur’s chapter, ‘CARICOM and rising powers: India, China and Brazil’s growing South–South cooperation in the region’ shifts the focus to CARICOM’s relations with some of the BRICS group, moving the discussion beyond regional cooperation to assess its economic relationships with these countries. What emerges from this discussion is the largely asymmetrical and bilateral nature of relationships established, in contrast to CARICOM’s engagement with Latin America. Also of interest, is that these relations are governed by geopolitical considerations that include access to the US market (China), the balancing of power (Brazil vs Cuba and Venezuela) as well as diasporic considerations, in the case of India and China, which have sizeable diasporas in some countries. Notwithstanding, there have been initiatives to develop relationships with CARICOM by these three states. What is missing is a coherent strategy on CARICOM’s part to maximise benefits from these arrangements. Patsy Lewis, Jessica Byron and Terri-­Ann Gilbert-­Roberts’s concluding chapter, ‘Confronting shifting economic and political terrains’, charts major shifts at the regional and global levels that have introduced fault lines into pan­Caribbean integration. At the regional level this is reflected in Venezuela’s deep political and economic crisis that threatens to erase its projection of an alternative model of South–South cooperation through ALBA and Brazil’s internal conflicts that have already resulted in lower levels of engagement with the region. The main developments at the international level are Britain’s decision to exit the EU and greater insularity in Europe which introduces uncertainty both in their continued non-­trade relations with the EU after the Cotonou Agreement ends in 2020; as well as their trade and non-­trade relations with Britain after 2019, when Brexit negotiations end. The other element of uncertainty has arisen with the election of Donald Trump as US President. Early policy signals, reflected in a plethora of Executive Orders, suggest clear challenges in migration and climate change – the latter with disproportionate effect on small states; and a scaling back of relations with Cuba. Although there are no clear immediate negative effects on trade, the President’s hostility to foreign trade is an area of concern and insecurity arises from the likelihood of further effects from the implementation of a conservative political agenda. The apparent further withdrawal of Britain and the US from the region widens the space for further South– South cooperation, particularly by BRICS and other players such as Mexico. These developments suggest the need for a more coherent approach by CARICOM and broader thrusts to strengthen the wider regional project.\n\nConclusion This volume, as it attempts to move beyond the traditional focus of CARICOM’s internal dynamics, to reflect on its broader relations with other language groups in the region, represents a rare attempt to engage, not just with conceptual\n\n14 P. Lewis et al. understandings of the region, but also with a broader academic community. It reflects important trends, not just in formal integration initiatives and their fortunes, but also in the contributions of history, culture, identity, race and migratory movements, not always frontally addressed by the integration literature. We hope that it makes a useful contribution to the literature.\n\nNotes 1 CARICOM’s member states are: Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Haiti, Jamaica, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia, St Vincent, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago. 2 The OECS is a subregional grouping of countries formerly classified by CARICOM as lesser developed, with the exception of Belize. They are Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, Grenada, Montserrat, St Kitts and Nevis, St Lucia and St Vincent. They also include Anguilla, the BVI and Martinique, as associated members. 3 The CARICOM Heads of Government accepted Haiti’s membership in 1997 with certain terms and conditions that were met in 1999. Haiti was formally admitted in 2002, although the 2010 earthquake has stymied its full integration. 4 Cuba was initially a member of CARIFORUM but declined to sign the Cotonou Partnership Agreement (CPA). 5 Trinidad and Barbados were not signatories to this agreement. 6 Grenada and St Kitts/Nevis are not members of the associated People’s Trade Treaty (TCP). 7 These were the BVI and the TCI (1991); Anguilla (1999); the Cayman Islands (2002); and Bermuda (2003). Montserrat was one of the early signatories to CARICOM. 8 Although Martinique signed documents of accession in February 2015 and has been considered as part of the OECS since then, the formal process was completed when France signed off on the agreement in April 2016.\n\n2 Constructing the Greater Caribbean Norman Girvan\n\nIntroduction Some years ago I published a paper that discussed the various meanings and definitions that are attached to the term ‘Caribbean’ (Meeks and Lindahl 2001). There is a sense in which the divisions of language are part of a larger picture that we could call the ‘legacy of empire’ in our region; and it is a useful point of departure. In these reflections, I want to explore how far the ongoing project of constructing the Caribbean may usefully be looked at through the optic of the opposing forces of empire and resistance. After a brief tour of the imperial project I will invite you to consider with me some of the principal resistance projects – by which I mean regional projects of indigenous construction – which have impacted our ideas of region and their political and institutional expressions. The projects I look at are pan-­Africanism, West Indian nationalism – regional and insular; revolutionary pan­Caribbeanism; Plantation pan-­Caribbeanism, and Greater Caribbean (some of these are invented labels). I will suggest that these different projects have been conditioned by factors such as language and colonial heritage, ethnicity and referential identity, class and ideology, and national state interest.\n\nInfluence of empire It may be useful to begin at the beginning as it were, by recalling that the linkages among our scattered islands go back a long way. We are told that they were initially settled by people from the mainland to the South, thrusting upwards from the Orinoco, and perhaps by others from the Yucatan venturing across to Cuba and The Bahamas. But unlike, say, the Japanese and Indonesian islands, our archipelago never benefitted from having an empire of indigenous origin that united the disparate islands under a common language, religion, culture and cosmology. There is no historical memory of being One upon which we can collectively draw. In Spanish colonial times, the ports of ‘Terra Firma’ on the Southern mainland were networked with those of Las Antillas Mayores (Greater Antilles) in the service of wealth extraction and trans-­Atlantic shipment. Subsequent incursions by other European nations were to seriously fragment the geopolitical\n\n16 N. Girvan configuration of the archipelago and, as pointed out by the Puerto Rican historian Antonio Gaztambide-­Geigel (1996), it was not until the latter half of the nineteenth century that the sea and its surrounding littoral began to be known as ‘Caribbean’. This development, as he shows, was a reflection of the imperial designs of an expansionist America. In effect, the Caribbean ‘Basin’ was constituted as the ‘Third Frontier’ of the US – or, as some would call it, ‘America’s Backyard’. It is in this sense that the seizure of Puerto Rico and de facto of Cuba in 1898, the separation of Panama from Colombia in 1903 in order to build an American canal, and the US occupations of Nicaragua, Haiti and the DR in the opening decades of the twentieth century, were all steps in the construction of the Greater Caribbean, American style. This would continue through the Anglo-­American Caribbean Commission of the 1940s, and a string of US interventions in the second half of the century in Cuba, the DR, Grenada, Nicaragua, Panama and Haiti, Reagan’s CBI and involvement in counter-­insurgency in Colombia. Most recently we have had the reactivation of the US Fourth Fleet in 2008 (Gragg 2008) and the pervasive US military presence in the entire region, complete with overflights of drones, conveniently packaged as the War on Drugs.\n\nPan-­Africanism My main concern, however, is not with the constructions of empire; rather it is with those that have arisen in response and from within. In this connection I would like to start with the work of Jamaica’s National Hero, Marcus Garvey. Although Garvey was not a regionalist in the customary sense, his project was to a significant degree formed by his regional experience of travel and observations of the common condition of black workers in the circum-­Caribbean and South America. The countries he visited included Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Chile, Peru, Honduras, Colombia and Venezuela. It was in these communities that his sense of international vocation and vision crystallised; it was here that his skills as an orator, political journalist and publisher were honed; and it was immediately after his return to Jamaica from these travels that he founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA) in 1912. And although the focus of his organisation settled on the US it had a wide regional outreach. Professor Robert Hill informs me1 that there were UNIA branches in Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, the DR, Puerto Rico, St Thomas, Virgin Islands, Antigua, St Kitts, St Vincent, Barbados, St Lucia, Dominica, Grenada, Trinidad, Tobago, Guyana, The Bahamas and Bermuda, as well as in six countries in the circum-­Caribbean. This extraordinary fact is testimony to the extent to which Garvey’s message of racial pride, self-­respect and economic self-­ development resonated in these societies. In Arthur Lewis’s autobiographical note (Lewis 1994, p. xliv), for instance, he records that his interest in the question of underdevelopment began when his father took him to a meeting of the St Lucia branch of the UNIA, when he (Lewis) was barely seven years old. It was of course Lewis’s work on the economics of development that won him his\n\nConstructing the Greater Caribbean 17 Nobel Prize, so I have sometimes quipped that the honours should have been shared with Marcus! Garvey was, above all, a pan-­Africanist in the audacity of his vision and the tenacity of his organisation, the first in a stellar line of personalities in that tradition who have their political roots in this archipelago. Indeed it is a matter on which we might reflect; that many of the most influential political thinkers from these islands have never found it possible to confine themselves to the insular space, and have embraced projects of far wider dimensions. After Garvey we had C. L. R. James, George Padmore, Walter Rodney and Bob Marley; from the French-­speaking Caribbean we have Aimé Césaire and Frantz Fanon. We also think of Michael Manley and his struggle for a New International Order and of José Marti’s assertion that Homeland is all of Humanity. We think of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro, who have made international solidarity the bedrock of the Cuban project. It was this sense that our societies and our presence in these parts are the product of global economic forces, and the mission to be part of the construction of a global future, I think, that made a young Walter Rodney, still just a sixth form student in Georgetown, declare to his fellow students that ‘West Indians live more in time than in space’. My point here is that the construction of region, in our concrete circumstances, must necessarily take account of the imperative of ethnic cultural and psychological self-­emancipation which derives from the peculiar and unique conditions under which Africans, by comparison with other ethnicities, were incorporated into the labour regimes of this hemisphere; conditions which are well-­known to all of us and with whose legacy we are still struggling to come to terms. We see this, for example, in the on-­going debate over race in Cuba; in the launch of the campaign by CARICOM nations for reparations for slavery and native genocide; and in the matter of the treatment of Haitian descendants in the DR. This issue is of course mediated by the reality that people of African origin share the insular and regional space with other ethnicities; including those of primarily Hispanic descent in the Spanish-­speaking countries and those of Asian descent in the Southern Caribbean. In such a context, if ethnicity is made into the dominant, or only, source of political identity, it can lead to a degenerate form of political tribalism as ethnically-­ based political parties vie for state power; it can become a cover for the corrupt use of state assets; and it can be an obstacle to the consolidation of national communities around common goals and objectives. Mutual respect and understanding, based on a thorough knowledge of historically derived prejudices and stereotypes, are the key; and here of course scholars have a crucial role and responsibility. One thinks of C. L. R. James’s dictum that: The race question is subsidiary to the class question in politics, and to think of imperialism in terms of race is disastrous. But to neglect the racial factor as merely incidental is an error only less grave than to make it fundamental. (James 1989, p. 283)\n\n18 N. Girvan\n\nWest Indian nationalism – regional and insular Only three years after Garvey founded the UNIA, at the other end of the archipelago, a young Grenadian named T. A. Marryshow was founding a newspaper called The West Indian – the last two words, significantly, joined together in a single word in the banner headline of the first issue. Thus was launched a second current of resistance, social thought and political practice that has impacted the construction of region. This is the current of West Indian nationalism. This current responded to similar conditions in the colonial order that gave rise to Garveyism, but it took a somewhat different form and trajectory. Taking root and spreading over the years, it crystallised in the form of the project of West Indian nationhood when Marryshow and Cipriani held a regional conference in Grenada in 1932. These people had the audacity and the vision to write a draft Constitution for a WIF with Dominion status – read ‘Independence’ – long before the British Colonial Office got into the business of mass-­producing such documents. The pioneers were followed by the Caribbean Labour Congress in 1938, which explicitly linked the campaign for self-­government and nationhood to the cause of emancipation of the working people and the creation of societies based on social justice. Democracy and political sovereignty would not be ends in themselves; they would be instruments for, in effect, a second emancipation of the West Indian people. Yet, as the thrust continued after the Second World War, these goals were to be progressively diluted in their class content and deprived of their regional dimension. By the time Marryshow’s dream became a reality in the form of the West Indian Federation in 1957, the writing was on the wall for it to become almost a nightmare, as a result of the emerging dynamic of insular nationalism. By this time too, the regional project had been robbed of its progressive social and economic agenda, and fragmented by virtue of the abstention of British Guiana – not to speak of British Honduras and The Bahamas – as a consequence of Cold War ideological fissures and ethnic politics. Hence the insular nationalism, that has in large measure displaced West Indian regionalism in the Anglophone Caribbean since the mid-­twentieth century, while also a project of resistance, has become a powerful centripetal force in the region. Since the break-­up of the Federation, British West Indians have tried to reconcile the dynamic of insular nationalism with the economic imperative of regional integration in the form of the Caribbean Free Trade Association (CARIFTA), and the CSME, to date with only limited success. I must say however that the recent ruling of the Caribbean Court of Justice (CCJ) in the Shanique Myrie case2 is a major development in rescuing the CARICOM regional project. Not only does it give justice to an aggrieved CARICOM citizen in her treatment by the functionaries of another CARICOM state, it also establishes minimum standards for unobstructed hassle-­free travel with which all states are bound to comply; and it gives much greater legal force to decisions of the CARICOM Conference of Heads of Government than had hitherto been thought to obtain. In the 1980s, a spirited debate erupted over the\n\nConstructing the Greater Caribbean 19 relative merits of ‘deepening’ versus ‘widening’ the Community by the inclusion of non-­Anglophone states. The Report of the West Indian Commission (1992) on this question was actually a vigorous reaffirmation of the case for consolidation of a West Indian identity that had been elaborated by the early visionaries, and speaks to its enduring appeal. It is captured in the eloquent words of the Chairman, Sir Shridath Ramphal, in his Preface to the Report: That fluent sculpture of time has already changed us; we the diverse people of scattered islands and mainland countries plucked from far continents by cruel history, drawing strength from our variety of race and culture and place of origin, but reaching beyond them for other strengths from uniting elements. Historical forces and the Caribbean Sea have divided us; yet unfolding history and that same Sea, through long centuries of struggle against uneven odds, have been steadily making us one. Now West Indians have emerged with an identity clearly recognisable not only to ourselves and our wider Caribbean but also in the world beyond the Caribbean Sea … … I am the fourth generation of my family’s anguished transplantation. Other West Indians have been here over a longer period, and through systems of greater anguish; yet it was natural for me to remind an audience during the Commission’s consultations that ‘I am a Guyanese before I am an Indian. I am West Indian before I am a Guyanese’. Oneness had replaced separateness in four generations. So it is for most of the people of our CARICOM region. That oneness is the basic reality of our West Indian condition. (p. vii) This notion of ‘West Indianness’ as a composite of historically subordinated ethnicities in the English-­speaking Caribbean, melding as a result of the processes of Creolisation, continues to occupy a central place in the construction of wider regional identities. It is buttressed, materially and organisationally, by a complex of regional institutions and common socialisation processes in which the University of the West Indies plays a not insignificant part. I like to tell people that I entered the Mona Campus over 50-odd years ago as a Jamaica nationalist and left as a West Indian regionalist; and I have never recognised any contradiction between the two. Yet we must concede that it is an identity that is derived from common British colonial experience in which language and common institutional heritage is the main medium of communication and of shared understanding. Going forward, ‘West Indians’ will be more and more challenged to accommodate this feeling of uniqueness with the necessities of wider regional and hemispheric circles of association in which other languages and institutional legacies predominate.\n\nChallenging the narratives In the seven years between 1938 and 1945, four books were published by writers from this region that in one way or another challenged the prevailing imperial\n\n20 N. Girvan narratives of Caribbean history. The books to which I refer are The Black Jacobins by the Trinidadian C. L. R. James (1938); The Caribbean: The Story of Our Sea of Destiny by the Jamaican W. Adolphe Roberts (1940); Capitalism and Slavery by Trinidadian Eric Williams (1944); and The Caribbean: Sea of the New World by the Colombian Germán Arciniegas (1946). It can hardly be a coincidence that these books should have appeared at a time when colonial peoples were on the march and the political economy of Latin America was being refashioned as a result of the Great Depression. But what seems to me of great significance is the way in which these books, both individually and collectively, effected fundamental changes in the way in which we look at ourselves. As I hope to show, their import lay in transcending the frontiers of language and colonising power and in laying the foundations of a pan-­Caribbean historical and political consciousness that continue to shape our constructions of region to the present day. Revolutionary pan-­Caribbeanism C. L. R. James wrote The Black Jacobins as a weapon in the anti-­colonial struggle. What is of interest is that he took his inspiration from the Haitian Revolution that had occurred some 150 years before and was the first successful revolution against slavery and colonialism in all of Latin America and the Caribbean; and that he looked to the person of Toussaint for lessons in the brilliance of Black political generalship, strategy and tactics. James’s project was the more audacious, in that since its self-­liberation Haiti had been relentlessly demonised in the Anglophone imaginary, used as proof that it is futile to defy imperial power and that black people are incapable of governing themselves without extended periods of white colonial tutelage. In the 75 years since it first appeared, probably no other single book as The Black Jacobins has so awoken the consciousness of English-­speaking Caribbeans to the wider community of imposition and resistance of which we are an integral part. James leaves us in no doubt as to his revolutionary pan-­Caribbeanism when in the 1963 republication of the book he adds an epilogue titled ‘From Toussaint Louverture to Fidel Castro’ and makes this declaration: Castro’s revolution is as much of the twentieth century as Toussaint’s was of the eighteenth. But despite the distance of over a century and a half, both are West Indian. The people who made them, the problems and the attempts to solve them, are particularly West Indian, the product of a peculiar origin and a peculiar history. West Indians first became aware of themselves as a people in the Haitian Revolution. Whatever its ultimate fate, the Cuban Revolution marks the ultimate stage of a Caribbean quest for national identity. In a scattered series of disparate islands the process consists of a series of uncoordinated periods of drift, punctuated by spurts, leaps and catastrophes. But the inherent movement is clear and strong. (Appendix: p. 391)\n\nConstructing the Greater Caribbean 21 It is to the Haitian Revolutionaries, therefore, that we ultimately owe the foundations of our consciousness of self as a regional people of equality, self-­respect, dignity and essential humanity. The historical connections operate as at a subterranean level in collective memory. We think of the often-­overlooked fact that Boukman, a prime initiator of the Haitian Revolution, came from Jamaica; that Bolivar was materially assisted by Petion; or there persists a fallacious notion conveyed in French texts, as the Uruguayan writer Eduardo Galeano reminds us, that Caribbean slavery was abolished by the benevolent French in 1848! In 1885 the Haitian anthropologist Antenór Firmin became one of the first writers to challenge the fallacious science of racial hierarchies in his book De l’égalité des races humaines (English: On the Equality of Human Races), for which he was reviled, ridiculed and marginalised from the French academy. Firmin’s book was written in rebuttal to the Frenchman de Gobineau’s pseudo-­ science The Inequality of the Human Races (1853–1855). Only four years later, at the other end of the Caribbean, the Trinidadian John Jacob Thomas published his book Froudacity (1889); itself a brilliant polemic in rebuttal to the ill-­ informed and bigoted travelogue by the Englishman James Anthony Froude’s 1888 book The English in the West Indies, in which he argued that West Indians were congenitally unfit for self-­government. The similarity is self-­evident. It was not necessary for Thomas to know of Firmin’s work, let alone to have communicated with him, or vice versa. Both Caribbean writers were taking aim at ideas then prevalent in the imperial centres. The language of empire is the same, no matter what language it speaks in. Let us remember that this was happening in the same decade as the imperialist ‘Scramble for Africa’, the Congress of Berlin that carved up the continent, and the accompanying doctrines of ‘White Man’s Burden’ and Mision. The spirit of Haiti, indeed, persists as a kind of thread connecting the French/ Creole, Anglo and Hispanic world of spiritual and intellectual marronage in the Caribbean space. We owe to the Cuban literary critic Emilio Jorge Rodríguez the beautiful notion of a Transcaribbean Literary Identity, with Haiti as its driving force. In his book of the same name, published in Spanish and English in a single volume by House of Nehesi in Saint Marten in 2011, Jorge Rodríguez tells of his love affair with Haitian literature. He traces its impact on, and connections with, the Cuban intellectual and artistic canon associated with Nicolás Guillén, Alejo Carpentier, Wilfredo Lam and several others who visited Haiti in a process of mutually creative exchange in the 1940s and after. Jorge Rodriguez himself made the pilgrimage to Haiti, so to speak, in several visits commencing in 1995 and completed with an exhausting and emotional trip to the Citadelle Laferrière; to which Lloyd Best has said every Caribbean child should be taken to gaze in wonder, awe and inspiration. In his modest way Jorge Rodriguez (2011) points us in his conclusion to possible future undertakings: Indeed, studies on Caribbean trans-­nationalization indicate the expansion of culture beyond national administrative boundaries.… Perhaps a look at Caribbean renationalization based on intra-­regional studies may contribute\n\n22 N. Girvan to demonstrate how identity building has shaped our history and culture.… Just as Alejo Carpentier highlighted in 1951 the pressing need of taking into account Haitian novels when drawing an overview of Latin American literature, today we can assert that in any attempt to define the cultural geography of the Caribbean and Latin America, the trans-­Caribbean links emerging since the Haitian Revolution are one of the pillars that gave rise to our hemispheric specificity. (pp. 133–134) The incorporation of Haiti into CARICOM in 2002 can thus be seen as the latest step in the regional validation of the Haitian experience; and a belated but welcome recognition of our historic debt to Haiti, as has been recognised by CARICOM and by the University of the West Indies in their programmes of collaboration with Haitian institutions post-­earthquake; and by bodies including ALBA and UNASUR; by Venezuela; and especially by the magnificent example of the Cuban Henry Reeves medical brigade serving in urban and rural communities in Haiti. But this is very much unfinished business, as witness the shameful ruling of 23 September 2013 by the Constitutional Court of the DR to strip of their citizenship some three generations of native-­born Dominicans who hitherto fore enjoyed that status, on the spurious grounds that their forebears were illegal immigrants, who, as it happens, are in the vast majority of Haitian origin. It has to be said that this ruling has been roundly condemned by a wide coalition of human rights organisations in that country. Plantation pan-­Caribbeanism In 1944 there appeared Eric Williams’ Capitalism and Slavery, thought by many to be the intellectual offspring of The Black Jacobins. You could hardly ask for a more comprehensive yet meticulous work of turning the colonial narrative on its head by its thesis that slavery and the slave trade had fuelled, if not financed, the British Industrial Revolution, while foreclosing all possibility of economic development in the Caribbean. But more than that, Williams provided a theoretical and analytical frame by which we can understand all such economies, irrespective of colonial power and associated linguistic and institutional heritage. In furtherance of this understanding Williams spent several months doing post-­doctoral research in the Spanish-­speaking islands and Haiti in 1940, and maintained a lively correspondence with the Cuban luminary Fernando Ortiz, éminence grise of the documentation of the African presence permeating Cuban culture. Returning to Howard University, he published his first academic article in 1941 calling for a pan-­Antillean Union or Federation, in which he declared inter alia that the ‘defence of the Western Hemisphere does not require, nor does it need, U.S. domination of the Caribbean’, but rather ‘the end of colonial rule and the assumption by the islands of full control over their internal affairs’ (Garcia-­ Muniz 1984, p. 26, citing Williams 1941, pp. 542, 543). Williams later wrote that the time he spent in Cuba was the most important of his intellectual life.\n\nConstructing the Greater Caribbean 23 I call this construction of region Plantation pan-­Caribbeanism. After this book, we begin to understand Caribbean economy, and hence society, as a system, whether preceded by the qualifier British, French, Dutch or Spanish. For Williams, this system lay at the core of his historicised thesis of the essential Caribbean condition of fragmentation caused by imperial rivalry, colonialism and slavery, and his utter conviction that only by means of economic and ultimately political integration of these islands could true economic emancipation, independence and self-­development be achieved. Williams remained steadfast to this conception throughout his political career. He fought for the WIF to have a strong central government, responsible for economic development; after the break-­up of the Federation, he convened a conference of states and territories of all the language zones to forge a Caribbean Economic Community in 1963; he insisted that the Economic Commission for Latin America should establish a Caribbean office to promote cooperation in this region; and he initiated the establishment of a Caribbean Cooperation and Development Committee of ECLA – now ECLAC (United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean), in 1975, along with Cuban Vice President Carlos Rafael Rodriguez. When he published his other major work of Caribbean history – From Columbus to Castro – in 1970, Williams made clear that his Caribbean was the archipelagic Caribbean, with the three Guianas and Belize added because of their history with the archipelagic experience. Intellectually, the road from Capitalism and Slavery would lead to the New World Group in the 1960s and the Theories of Plantation Economy of Lloyd Best (1968), Lloyd Best and Kari Polanyi Levitt (1969) and George Beckford (1972) in the 1970s, and to the Association of Caribbean Economists in the 1980s. Most notably, and without gainsaying the enormous contribution of eminent Caribbean historians who followed Williams, it is the scope of ‘Caribbean’ that underlies the magisterial United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) History of the Caribbean project launched in the 1980s; published in six volumes. Even then, we find a growing elasticity around the edges its notion of Caribbean region. As early as 1967 we find Lloyd Best beginning his famous essay on ‘Independent Thought and Caribbean Freedom’ with an assertion that the Caribbean, as the world of plantation America, extends from the Northeast of Brazil to the South of the US. In the aforementioned UNESCO history, we find that the region is defined to include those communities – as distinct from states – in the circum­Caribbean that share the core experience. Indeed, Colombian and Venezuelan scholars take great exception to any suggestion that they are, in effect, not one of us, at least as far as the Caribbean coast of these countries is concerned. The Caribbean Studies Association (CSA) has held successful conferences in the Colombian Caribbean island of San Andres, and even as far away as Salvador da Bahia; all of which leads to two other books to which I wish to refer, which have to do with the construction of the Greater Caribbean from a perspective from within.\n\n24 N. Girvan Greater Caribbean W. Adolphe Roberts’s book The Caribbean: The Story of Our Sea of Destiny was published in 1940. Now Roberts was not only a self-­taught historian, he was a passionate Jamaican nationalist. Some credit him with ‘conceptualising and initiating the march towards Jamaican self-­government’ from his base in New York, where he founded the Jamaica Progressive League on 1 September 1936 (Jones 2011). His book of 46 chapters and 340 pages spanned a 450-year story of the lands lying in and around the ‘1,800 miles from the Serpent’s mouth, between South America and Trinidad and the Yucatan Channel’ (p. 14). It might seem to be a curious paradox that a man of such intensely insular nationalist orientation should publish a book of this magnitude claiming a proprietorial relationship with the larger space that we inhabit, and asserting it as the locus of our destiny. But what this tells us is the powerful role of history, landscape and seascape in forming the sense of our place in the world. So many of our poets, novelists and artists derive their inspiration from what lies around us. I recently watched a film on Derek Walcott, Poetry Is An Island (Ida Does Productions 2013), where he says that if he travels outside of St Lucia for more than a certain period of time, he feels literally incomplete, almost ill, with longing for his islandscape. The hinterland of Guyana has evoked some of the most compelling, almost mystical, prose of the writer Wilson Harris. This sense of place, in the widest sense, is the foundation stone of a truly expansive regionalism that fixes the Greater Caribbean as the centre of our world. We encounter this, too, in Germán Arciniegas, public intellectual par excellence, diplomat in the service of his country, and one of the most distinguished and revered men of letters of the twentieth century of his native Colombia. In the 65 years from 1932 to 1997 Arciniegas ‘published practically one book a year along with hundreds of essays, articles and speeches’ (Back cover, ‘Editorial Reviews’ Amazon, www.amazon.com/Caribbean-­Sea-The-­New-World/dp/1174857013). His Biografía del Caribe (1945), (published in English in 1946 as Caribbean: Sea of the New World) is a ‘breath-­taking and magisterial work, encompassing four centuries of history of the Caribbean basin in its broad sweep’ (Girvan 2003); and remains one of his most acclaimed works. These two books were written, therefore, as part of a political vocation to create Our Story in place of Their (His) Story. As Professor Bridget Brereton (2003, p. 315) has written, they were among the first, if not the first, to break with the imperial traditions of Caribbean historiography in writing a general yet accessible history of the region that straddles the centre of the hemisphere. In centring their narrative on the Sea, both Roberts and Arciniegas find themselves characterising the Caribbean as the Mediterranean of the Americas; a place of clash of cultures and perpetual imperial rivalries; pawns in a power game of emperors and kings; objects of the unworthy attentions of pirates and other assorted criminals. Nowadays, this strategic location gives us the dubious importance of sitting astride the principal drug trafficking routes between South America, North America and Europe, and as a result having some of the highest\n\nConstructing the Greater Caribbean 25 homicide rates in the world. It is almost as if the cocaine and marijuana of today are like the gold and silver of yesteryear: sources of fabulous wealth that traverse our borders, acting like magnets of greed and unmitigated ruthlessness. And the region has its own twenty-­first century pirates too! On the other hand, we continue, as we must, to seek opportunities for leveraging this location to legitimate advantage, as we see from the plans to create a logistics hub in Jamaica and the recent opening of the huge trans-­shipment facility at the Port of Mariel in Cuba, in order to garner the spin-­offs of the expansion of the Panama Canal. We will always be where we are, and the Sea will always be with us. We have no choice but to centre our world on this space; to embrace our Sea and make it ours. One of the most important initiatives of the ACS – the principal institutional expression of the Greater Caribbean so far – is to have the Caribbean Sea designated by the United Nations as a Special Area for Sustainable Development. In respect of the ACS, which was launched in 1994 after the Report of the West Indian Commission, what is actually noteworthy is the speed of change in Latin America and the Caribbean that has profoundly altered the hemispheric configuration since then. One consequence is that new and attractive avenues for cooperation between the Caribbean and the continent have been opened up that go beyond the ACS. Undoubtedly the most important of these are PetroCaribe, ALBA,3 UNASUR and CELAC. PetroCaribe has become far and away the largest single provider of concessionary finance to CARICOM, the majority of which are members of the scheme. Four of them have carried this further by becoming full members of ALBA and two others are in ALBA as observers.4 In the case of UNASUR, to which Guyana and Suriname belong, a huge Brazilian-­ led initiative to int"
