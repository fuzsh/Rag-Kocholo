        "text": "In November 2010 we witnessed the largest student demonstrations in Britain since 1998. Opposing the £9,000 university fees being written in by the new coalition government was the first time many students had protested, and there were signs of a new dawn for student activism. But then they seemed to give up. What happened to those heady moments of student activism? Have today’s students really not got anything to say? Edward Hyatt and Megan Denise Smith, both current students at Kingston, find action closer to home.\n\nPage, C.G. and Pears, D. (2013) The Effect Birth Date Has On Choosing To Study A Sports Related Course At An Educational Institution. Purpose: The Relative Age Effect (RAE) in the academic study of sport. The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship of those students being born on a certain date will indeed influence the decision to study a sports related course at an educational institution. Methods: Contacted various levels of educational institutions and requested student information from sport related academic courses such as their date of birth, gender and course title. The gatekeeper and the data managers securely passed the relevant information requested. Organised and arranged data collection into three birth date month groups; September-December, January-April and May-August within appropriate statistical software and spreadsheet software. Results: Statistical analysis was determined where appropriate using Chi-Square tests and formulas. The main findings show there to be significant results in the birth dates of an individual and studying a sports academic course as with the distribution of births across all levels of education were not equally distributed throughout the year. The observed frequencies showed the birth date is highest for the months of September-December and lowest for the spring and summer months. It also showed an over populace representation of male students compared to females who are studying a sport related academic course at an educational institution. Conclusions: Therefore it can be derived from the results presented that the birth date did have a large influence on choosing to study a sports related course at an educational institution. Key Words: Relative Age Effect, birth date grouping, gender bias, sports academia.\"\n\nThe UK is facing many long-term, difficult challenges. They include the need to improve economic productivity; to enhance, broaden and deliver a highly skilled workforce; and to ensure public money is spent effectively and efficiently. This report sets out the contribution smaller universities as well as regionally focused and specialist institutions make to a diverse higher education sector that is fit to help address those challenges. It also makes the case for ensuring that diversity is not put at risk, but is protected and promoted."
