        "text": "I wonder what it is like to live in uninteresting — boring, even — times? It must be nice. While I continue to ponder that, here are this month’s book covers….\n\nThe Alternatives by Caoilinn Hughes; design by Lauren Peters-Collaer (Riverhead / April 2024)\n\nBack to the Local by Maurice Gorham; design by Pete Adlington (Faber & Faber / June 2024)\n\nPete talks about the book and his process designing the cover for the Faber Journal.\n\nFestival & Game of the Worlds by César Aira; design by Tyler Comrie (New Directions / July 2024)\n\nThe Horse by Willy Vlautin; design by Milan Božić (HarperCollins / July 2024)\n\nKicking Off Around the World by Ramon Usall; design by Steve Leard (Pluto Press / June 2024)\n\nIf I was good at blogging I would have posted this last month when the book was actually published and before the finals of Euros and Copa America, but here we are. Better late than never I guess, and politics never goes out of sport however much some people pretend they are unconnected. (I’m still thinking about doing a post of covers from books about sport, but haven’t got any further than that. Again, if I was actually smart and organized, I would have had it done in time for the Olympics. Cover suggestions still welcome by the way!).\n\nAnyway… The author’s surname and the book’s subtitle were actually printed on to the shirt for the cover and Steve made or bought actual buttons to decorate it.

I feel like these work together despite being quite different? Maybe it’s as simple as the combination of really big type for the title and handwriting of “a novel”?\n\nNeu Klang by Christoph Dallach; design by Jack Smyth (Faber & Faber / May 2024)\n\nThis is out in the US/Canada next month.\n\nPaul Celan and the Trans-Tibetan Angel by Yoko Tawada; design by Jamie Keenan (New Directions / July 2024)\n\nRangikura by Tayi Tibble; design by Linda Huang; illustration by Simone Noronha (Knopf / April 2024)\n\nThe same team created the cover of Tayi Tibble’s previous poetry collection Poūkahangatus, which was included way back in September 2022’s post.\n\nThe Road to the Salt Sea by Samuel Kọláwọlé; design Alicia Tatone (Amistad Books / July 2024)\n\n(Thanks to Alicia and AD Stephen Brayda for sending over the cover)\n\nSteak by Tim Hayward; design by Luke Bird (Quadrille / May 2024)\n\nI am late to this one, but it is very good (in my defence, it only came out in the US/Canada last month).\n\nThey Dream in Gold by Mai Sennaar; design by Vivian Lopez Rowe (Zando / July 2024)\n\nTripping on Utopia by Benjamin Breen; design by Tyler Comrie (Grand Central / January 2024)\n\nI don’t who decided July is Tyler Comrie month (me, apparently), but it seems that way…\n\nTrouble in Censorville by Nadine M.

I’m a little bit ahead of schedule because fall sales conference season is upon us, and I have to be in New York for work next week. I’m less ahead than I would’ve liked — PRINT has already beaten me to the punch! — but here we are, a couple of days earlier than usual, with another look at some new and recent book covers. April is National Poetry Month in the US so there are a few poetry covers in the mix, as well as a couple of covers from independent presses, an Australian cover, and all the usual suspects.\n\nBones Worth Breaking by David Martinez; design by Alex Merto (MCD / April 2024)\n\nCharlie Hustle by Keith O’Brien; design by Eli Mock (Pantheon / March 2024)\n\nI just like the type and the colour palette here.\n\nCahokia Jazz by Francis Spufford; design by Henry Petrides (Faber & Faber / April 2024)\n\nThe Curse of Pietro Houdini by Derek B.

Does Formula One really count as a sport? Not for me, Clive. But the subtitle says it is, and a Canadian friend once told me that for something to qualify as a sport it has to endanger your life in some fundamental way, so I guess F1 qualifies under Quebec Rules for Teen Boys if nothing else.\n\nAnyway, it might be fun to do a post of interesting sports books covers at some point if I can find the time (let me know if any great examples come to mind!).\n\nHoney by Victor Lodata; design by Robin Bilardello (Harper / April 2023)\n\nKill For Me Kill For You by Steve Cavanagh; design by Laywan Kwan (Atria / March 2024)\n\nI feel like this is a bit different for a psychological thriller?

The cover of Ball by Tara Ison, designed by Kelly Winton, comes to mind. I’m sure there are other examples (David Gee’s unpublished cover for Lolita.

I hope you’re safe and well wherever you are.\n\nBefore we get to the covers, a couple of brief admin things. First up, there have been a couple of behind-the-scenes changes at the CO this past month. They’ve solved a few tech issues for me and hopefully no one else has noticed. Secondly, I’ve been tinkering with the RSS. I’m not sure that’s quite right yet, so apologies if it’s not been working as expected. Let me know if you’re experiencing any weirdness.\n\nI also wanted quickly mention that the deadline for the DPI mentorship scheme has been extended to April 12th. I’m not involved with the DPI, but some really great people are so if you are a designer from an under represented background living in the UK or Ireland, you should think about applying!\n\nAnyway, it’s a really big post this month! The are lots of great covers with the UK, Australia and Canada all represented, as well as the usual folks from US. There are some compare-and-contrasts, a couple of covers from indie presses, a couple of covers for translations, and a couple of poetry covers too. There’s even a meandering digression in the middle (sorry). Enjoy!\n\nAnxiety by Samir Chopra; design by Karl Spurzem (Princeton University Press / March 2024)\n\nCandy Darling by Cynthia Carr; design by Alex Merto (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / March 2024)\n\nCrisis Actor by Declan Ryan; design by Stephanie Cui (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / February 2024)\n\nFourteen Days edited by Margaret Atwood & Douglas Preston; design by Nathan Burton (Harper / February 2024)\n\nFree Therapy by Rebecca Ivory; design by Luke Bird (Vintage / March 2024)\n\nFruit of the Dead by Rachel Lyon; design by Math Monahan (Scribner / March 2024)\n\nSo this cover sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole. It reminded me of a cover design from a few years ago. It didn’t really look the same but, in my mind at least, this other cover featured a blue-red capsule shape (possibly a stretched illustration of a planet and its core) centred on a white background with black Swiss-style sans serif type. It was not exactly minimalist, but clean and precise. I think I saw it on Twitter back in the day. I thought it was maybe literary sci-fi or pop science, and published by one of the big American imprints. I was also pretty convinced that it was designed by Alex Merto or possibly John Gall. One of the dudes.\n\nThis is not the first time I have thought about this cover, and I can, or at least could, picture it quite clearly. The problem is that I can find no evidence of this cover ever existing, and the more I think about, the more the details shift and doubt creeps in. I don’t seem to have posted it anywhere, and I can’t find it in the usual places. It’s possible that I am getting some of the crucial details wrong, mentally combining a couple of covers into one, or it was something other than an actual book cover. But maybe this is some kind of Visual Mandela Effect thing, and this design that I’ve believed existed for years is actually a figment of my imagination.\n\nMy search has felt a bit like the online equivalent of walking into a bookstore and asking for the book with the blue cover. It has made realise that we have very few tools to find cover designs in a systematic way, especially since the Book Cover Archive stopped being a going concern. You just kind of have to browse and I hope you eventually look in the right place (or risk slowly lose your sanity).\n\nAnyway, if this mystery cover is ringing any bells with you, please let me know and put me out of my misery. I have been going slightly crazy. (This sort of thing happens more than I care to admit by the way, but it is particularly bad this time! And, no, I do not have much of a life.

Add to this the ongoing concern about how artificial intelligence will affect a business historically dependent upon human creativity — yet through it all, there was still the matter of making books, and their covers, to get on with.\n\nI read Matt’s piece the same day I read an article by Kyle Chayka in the New Yorker about his search for an epochal term to “evoke the panicky incoherence of our lives of late.” The suggestions range from the bland ‘Long 2016,’ to the incredibly ominous-sounding ‘Chthulucene,’ the Lovecraftian ‘New Dark Age,’ and the frankly terrifying and plausible ‘Jackpot’ from William Gibson’s 2014 novel The Peripheral.\n\nThis was the context of life and work in 2023.\n\nMatt notes some designers found inspiration in the zeitgeist. He’s not wrong. But, ironically perhaps, I feel less optimistic about the overall picture than he does.\n\nAt the risk of repeating what I’ve written in the past couple of years, it’s like we’re stuck in a holding pattern, circling the same design ideas. Trends have stuck around. A lot of covers feel safe. Some of this was the books themselves. I’m not sure exactly how many celebrity memoirs is too many, but I’m pretty sure we reached that point and sailed right past it in 2023. No doubt some of it is sales and marketing departments sanding down all the edges and demanding the tried and true (see Zachary Petit’s alternative best of 2023 piece on killed covers for Fast Company). But I would not be surprised if it designers were just getting caught up in the churn — too many books, too many covers, and too much other stuff to worry about.\n\nOr maybe it’s just me.\n\nOne of the themes of the year was nostalgia, which I’m sure can also be put down to the present being pretty fucking awful. It was apparent across almost all genres, including literary fiction, but nowhere more so than in the resurgent supernatural suspense and horror categories. There were creative stylistic mashups with retro vibes, along side fastidious Stranger Things-like homages to the 1980s and Stephen King.\n\nOne genuinely pleasant surprise was the number of interesting covers from Canadian publishers this year. They’ve been quietly risk-averse in recent years, so it was nice to see a few bolder design choices getting approved. I was happy to see a Canadian cover was one of the top picks on Literary Hub’s (very, very long) list of the best covers of 2023.\n\nThere were other things to cheer this year too.\n\nSpine continued to give space to designers to talk about their work in a way I’ve never been able to do consistently here. You can find their 2023 cover picks here.\n\nDavid Pearson started the Book Cover Review, a website for short reviews of book covers.\n\nZoe Norvell’s I Need A Book Cover, a resource for book cover inspiration as well as place for authors and publishers to connect with designers, also went live.\n\nSteve Leard launched Cover Meeting, a podcast series of in-depth interviews with cover designers (including David and Zoe among others). As Mark Sinclair notes in his piece on book cover design this year for Creative Review, Steve’s conversations shed light on wider concerns in the industry as well as each designer’s individual process. Have a listen if you haven’t already.\n\nThanks for reading.\n\nThe Adult by Bronwyn Fischer; design by Kate Sinclair (Random House Canada / May 2023)\n\nAlso designed by Kate Sinclair:\n\nThe Annual Banquet of The Gravediggers’ Guild by Mathias Énard; design by John Gall (New Directions / December 2023)\n\nI like John’s cover for Kairos by Jenny Erpenbeck, also published by New Directions, a lot too.\n\nBariloche by Andrés Neuman; design by Alban Fischer (Open Letter / March 2023)\n\nThe Bee Sting by Paul Murray; design by Na Kim (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / August 2023)\n\nAlso designed by Na Kim:\n\nBeijing Sprawl by Xu Zechen; design by Andrew Walters (Two Lines Press / June 2023)\n\nBerlin by Bea Setton; design by Emily Mahon; cover image by Nataša Denić (Penguin Books / May 2023)\n\nAlso designed by Emily Mahon:\n\nB.F.F. by Christie Tate; design by Ben Wiseman (Avid Reader Press / February 2023)\n\nBlue Hunger by Viola Di Grado; design by Myunghee Kwon (Bloomsbury / March 2023)\n\nBreaking and Entering by Don Gillmor; design by Michel Vrana; photograph by Joe Cohen (Biblioasis / August 2023)\n\nBright Young Women by Jessica Knoll; design by Kaitlin Kall (Simon & Schuster / September 2023)\n\nBrutes by Dizz Tate; design by Nicole Caputo (Catapult / February 2023)\n\nCaret, Pilcrow and Cedilla by Adam Mars-Jones; design by Jonathan Pelham (Faber / August 2023)\n\nI also really liked Jonny’s cover design for the UK edition of Tremor by Teju Cole, published by Faber.\n\nCat Prince by Michael Pedersen; design by Gray318 (Little, Brown / July 2023)\n\nThe Circle by Katherena Vermette; design by Jennifer Griffiths; art by KC Adams (Hamish Hamilton Canada / September 2023)\n\nChrysalis by Anna Metcalfe; design by Jack Smyth (Granta / May 2023)\n\nThe Complete Works of Álvaro de Campos by Fernando Pessoa; design by Peter Mendelsund (New Directions / July 2023)\n\nThe Details by Ia Genberg translated by Kira Josefsson; design Stephen Brayda; illustration Najeebah Al-Ghadban (Harpervia / August 2023)\n\nA Dictator Calls by Ismail Kadare; design by Matt Broughton (Vintage / August 2023)\n\nThe Employees by Olga Ravn; design by Paul Sahre (New Directions / February 2023)\n\nExcavations by Hannah Michell; design by Arsh Raziuddin (One World / July 2023)\n\nThe Girls’ Guide to Hunting and Fishing by Melissa Bank; design by Annie Atkins (Penguin / May 2023)\n\nGlaciers by Alexis M.

I don’t think I had a very satisfactory answer. 2021 felt very much like a continuation of 2020, which itself felt like a year on hold.\n\nThe trends that came to mind were not exactly new. In no particular order: big faces (big sunglasses!); cropped faces; hands; mouths; postmodern typefaces; big skies; rainbows; gradients; the colour orange; psychedelia; collage; contemporary painting.\n\nA lot was made of “blob” covers this year. I’m not sure that anything has really changed since Vulture published this article about “blocky” covers in 2019. They seemed like much the same thing.\n\nDesign is about the constraints and, as it turns out, the constraints around designing commercial literary fiction covers that have to work just as well online as in bookstores can lead to similar design solutions — large, legible type, and bright, abstract backgrounds. The surprising thing is not that a few covers look the same when you squint; it’s that more of them don’t.\n\nThere were a lot of good covers (that didn’t look alike) in 2021. LitHub posted 101 of them. Still, it didn’t exactly feel like a vintage year.\n\nDo I say that every December? Possibly.\n\nA few years ago I worried that covers were moving in a more conservative direction, particularly at the big publishers. I’m not sure this has come to pass, at least not in the US. There are plenty of covers from the big, prestigious American literary imprints in this year’s list, as there were last year, and every year before that.\n\nThere are fewer covers from the UK in this year’s list than in previous years though, and I feel less confident about the situation there. From a distance, things seem a little sedate. I may be mistaken. It’s quite possible I haven’t see enough covers — or perhaps enough of the right ones — from British publishers to get a good sense of the overall picture.\n\nIt would not be a surprise, however, if publishers were feeling a little risk-averse at the moment. We are two years into a global pandemic, experiencing a major supply chain issues, and living through a seemingly endless series of sociopolitical crises.\n\nNor would it be a surprise if designers were personally feeling the effects too — I’m not sure we are talking about this enough, and I’m not sure I know how to.\n\nThank you to everyone who has supported the blog in 2021.
