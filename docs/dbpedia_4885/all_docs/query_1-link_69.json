It is intended to be a platform for research and discussion on the student centred, competence and learning outcome based reforms of higher education programmes that are currently sweeping the world.\n\nAlthough TJHE will benefit from the experience of those academics that have engaged since 2000 in the âTuning phenomenonâ â the many university driven projects fuelling such reforms â it is open to all academics, administrators and policy makers. The prime intention is to promote research into this field and subject the tools developed during these and other projects to full academic scrutiny and debate.\n\nTuning has from the outset been generously supported by the European Commission and in recognition of the spirit in which that support was given the journal will be truly open access (no individual charges for submission or access) for the foreseeable future. ISI registration will be applied for as soon as the journal qualifies.\n\nI have pleasure, on behalf of the Editorial Board, in inviting submissions from all those working to improve the quality, transparency, transferability and relevance of higher education programmes and who wish to share their experience with the global community via the pages of this journal.

Ryan, and Robert Wagenaar\n\nHigher education is fundamental to both national and global contemporary knowledge economies. It is also a driver for social change (see for example , ,) which crucially includes making higher education available and relevant to a wider section of society and improving the mobility and relevance of its graduates in the workplace. New tools are required to integrate such developments with the sectorâs traditional functions of teaching and research. However, every student is different, each programme is different, each university is different and the needs of professions and nations also differ. Therefore, research leading to the development of such tools is fundamental to the development of modern society. One such tool, whose importance has recently been recognised, is the use of profiles at institutional, regional (geographic, cultural or discipline) and programme levels. Such profiles are a concise, precise and portable description of the particular academic entity. They have diverse uses ranging from ranking of institutions, aiding academic programme selection by a student, facilitating graduate mobility and as a tool for professional accreditation. We have, therefore, selected the topic of profiles for the first issue of the Tuning Journal for Higher Education. Whilst we cannot hope to cover the totality of this subject in one issue, we trust that it will stimulate debate and further promote research on the types, design and uses of profiles.\n\nThe first and perhaps the most important question we address is what should be profiled? Van Vught and Huisman discuss the importance of institutional profiles. In a world increasingly obsessed with rankings, the current metrics used ignore 97% of the worldâs higher education institutions and have no clear link with the quality of an individual educational programme or the needs of the student. Institutional profiles provide a means whereby an institution can clearly state how well it achieves its aims, thus establishing its place in a multidimensional educational hierarchy.\n\nThe matter of how to build discipline profiles is discussed by GonzÃ¡lez and Yarosh. They propose a new method, which relies upon a full analysis of the core competences within a discipline. A criticism of profiles is that they can contain a long and lacklustre lists of competences, often derived from a template developed elsewhere, that fail to capture the essence of the particular discipline. Grouping these competences into interlinked groups of meta-competences and then using these groups to define a meta-profile capturing the essence of the discipline (at subject template level) or the programme (at programme profile level) requires informed debate.\n\nWagenaar addresses the complex issue of how decisions made in an international political forum, in this instance that of the Education Ministers of Europe, can be translated into acceptable and practical actions to be undertaken by academics. He traces the evolution of the international tools associated with the Bologna Process and analyses the difficulties in applying them at the level of a particular higher education sector or programme. He argues that the development of programme profiles requires new sectoral profiles or frameworks, which are compatible with international qualifications frameworks and discusses the evolution of such profiles, which have been developed in the framework of the recent Tuning-HUMART SQF project.\n\nProfiles must be portable to be of value in the new globalized society. However, it is probably not possible or useful to try to design a single global profile for a given discipline. It is, therefore, important that the regional extent of any given profile is understood. Thus, regionalization in modern higher education is a fundamental context into which any profile must be placed. Knight analyses modern trends of regionalization in global higher education and provides a new conceptual model for its understanding.\n\nAlthough all aspects of proper profile design are related to the needs of society and employability, it is important that such designs are evidence based. Avvisati, Jacotin and Vincent-Lancrin analyse the findings of two major global surveys of recent graduates. They conclude that the much sought after competence for innovation, required to drive knowledge economies, is not solely developed within Science, Technology, Engineering and Medicine (STEM) programmes and that a research agenda is required to evaluate the best mix of skills required for its promotion.\n\nIt is impossible to consider the current reforms in global higher education without reference to the various Tuning programmes around the word. Whilst many articles make reference to the role of Tuning, that by DonÃ¡ della Rose and Haug provides an overview of the profiling of higher education programmes throughout Europe from 2000 to 2011 and an assessment of its impact in Europe and beyond. The article also outlines the new challenges that now need addressing.\n\nThe final three articles deal with the progress and innovations being made by Tuning programmes around the world. AlarcÃ³n, Beneitone, de Armas, Franco, SuÃ±Ã© and Veneros discuss the development of a common academic credit system (CLAR) throughout 18 countries and 15 subject areas in Latin America, which is based upon level and student workload. This credit system, like the ECTS system in Europe, is essential for the portability of qualifications and the development of new interdisciplinary programmes. The careful methodology presented provides a template for those regions which do not currently have such credit systems. Hahn and Teferra present the state of higher education in Africa and review various initiatives designed to achieve harmonisation. They then present the current results of the Tuning Africa project and present the African approach to âTuningâ. This interesting analysis of on-going work emphasises how such methodologies must adapt to serve the needs of regions in an ever-changing society. Karavayeva and Kovtun report on progress made by the Tuning Russia project. In particular they highlight the difficulties and advantages of integrating a methodology driven by academics, like the âTuning Methodâ for programme design, with Russian Federal State Education Standards. Their discussion on the need to carefully evaluate key competences and to reconcile those with the academic norms of their society provides useful insights and links nicely with the need for meta-profiles describes above by GonzÃ¡lez and Yarosh.\n\nFurther research is essential. Not only do we need for each region, each profession and programme within that region (see for example ) and each institution globally to adopt profiling, but these profiles must be transparent and transportable. Without such a tool we face the possibility of a globalized economy only in the sense of the movement of products and services and not of expertise. However, it is the mobility of this very expertise, linked with cross-cultural and interdisciplinary innovation, upon which the new knowledge based society depends.\n\nInstitutional Profiles: Some Strategic Tools\n\nFrans van Vught and Jeroen Huisman\n\nAbstract: In this paper we argue that both internal and external pressures and conditions urge contemporary higher education institutions to carefully think through their institutional profiles positions in domestic and global higher education contexts. We subsequently analyse strategic positioning from the strategic management literature and offer four tools â mapping, multi-dimensional ranking, benchmarking and degree profiling â to assist higher education institutions in their profiling and positioning strategies.\n\nKeywords: innovation policy, activity and performance profiles; strategy; autonomy; mapping; ranking; benchmarking; degree profiles.\n\nI. Introduction: the role of higher education in the knowledge economy\n\nThere is an observable trend in many countries towards de-industrialisation and a corresponding government concern about how to promote innovation and technological change as a principal means of sustaining international competitiveness. Natural resources are no longer the dominant factor in economic growth. Goods, services, capital, labour, and knowledge move around the world with increasing speed and markets become increasingly interconnected and globalised. Generally speaking, it appears that globaÂ­liÂ­saÂ­tion leads to increasing national specialisation. This process of specialisation, which is amplified by scale and learning effects, creates a reallocation of production processes between countries and forces nations to look for their international comparative advantages. Given this situation, national governments try to identify and develop their specific strengths. They try to increase their location attractiveness for business firms; they try to attract mobile production factors; they develop their socio-cultural profiles; and they try to increase their innovation capacity. Many nations now seek to promote innovation as a key driver of economic growth. In particular Western industrialised nations try to find their comparative advantages in the production of knowledge-intensive goods and services. To better compete in a globalised economy they increasingly focus on knowledge, creativity and innovation, and on the role that higher education and research organisations could play as major contributors to the knowledge economy. National innovation policies have begun to shape and supersede traditional higher education and research policies.\n\nNational innovation policies appear to take various forms. Dill and van Vught identified two broad categories of national innovation policy strategies. The first and largest category comprises what could be called prioritisation strategies. These policies are characterised by features such as foresight analyses in the science and technology sectors, priority allocation and concentration of resources, and quality assessments of research outputs. They reflect the notion of national planning (see for example Australiaâs research priority setting initiatives, Finlandâs technology and innovation policy with a key role for TEKES, and the Dutch Innovation Platform policy). The other category of innovation policies places an emphasis on market forces and competition. The policy characteristics of these competition strategies include an emphasis on competitive allocation of resources, encouraging entrepreneurial university behaviour, deregulating the higher education sector, and encouraging multiple sources of funding. The pre-eminent example of this strategy is the US federal science policy with its emphasis on a national marketplace of competing private and state universities, limited federal control, and the competitive allocation of funding by research funding agencies. But aspects of this type of competition strategy can also be found â to a greater or lesser degree â in e.g. Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom.\n\nII. Increasing institutional autonomy\n\nHigher education institutions increasingly have been granted more autonomy by their national governments. In the older days, governments largely decided on what higher education institutions should do. There were often detailed regulations regarding which programmes higher education institutions could offer and how these should be structured, detailed financial regulations determined how governmental budgets were to be spent, and the infrastructure of the higher education institutions (buildings, estate) were often owned by the government.\n\nProgrammatic freedom has increased in many countries. Nowadays, governments often use lump sum funding with significant discretion for institutions to decide how and where to allocate the budgets. Human resource management policies have been devolved to higher education institutions, sometimes going hand in hand with a change of status of academic personnel from civil servant to employee. And, many higher education institutions are now responsible for their real estate.\n\nThis may look like a rosy picture of increasingly more scope for institutional strategies and profiling, but it is fair to state that governments have sometimes been hesitant to grant institutional autonomy in all areas. Moreover, governments have often exchanged a priori evaluation (through regulations) with ex post evaluations. That said, comparing the current levels of institutional autonomy with the situation a few decades ago, there is arguably much more scope for strategic choice by higher education institutions.\n\nHowever, it is clear that governments and other stakeholders want something back in return for this increased autonomy. The crucial roles higher institutions can play with respect to national innovation policies are turning them into an object of policy attention. External stakeholders (including potential new students and business & industry) ask for more transparency and accountability, and increasingly confront higher education institutions with questions about their relevance and effectiveness in terms of national innovation.\n\nIII. Challenges for higher education institutions\n\nObviously the changing context described above has major impacts on higher education institutions. We present some of these challenges under three headings: mission overload, global research competition, and system diversity. The overarching theme of these challenges is the imperative for higher education institutions to rethink their role in the higher education landscape and to consider and develop what we will term âinstitutional profilesâ. Institutional profiles are to be understood as key characteristics of the mission, activities and performances of higher education institutions. Institutional profiles can be divided into âactivity profilesâ and âperformance profilesâ. Activity profiles describe what higher education institutions do, illustrating their activities. Performance profiles are about how good higher education institutions are in performing their activities.\n\n1. Mission overload\n\nHigher education institutions are increasingly facing rising expectations and an expanding set of challenges. They are expected to address the worldâs major problems â e.g. those related to our natural environment; the settlement and movement of people; pandemics; poverty; terrorism etc. Worldwide there is widespread expect ation that universities and other institutions should research an increasingly broad range of problems in an ever-growing holistic fashion and at an accelerated pace (see e.g. the European Commissionâs Horizon 2020 programme). As our societies become more knowledgeable, universities and research institutions come under increasing pressure to expand transfer of knowledge and apply new knowledge in order to solve the problems confronting the world.\n\nIn addition, these expectations are becoming increasingly diversified. Higher education institutions are expected to produce the knowledge and human capital that meet the needs of the modern knowledge society, play a central role in innovation processes, contribute to regional development, increase social inclusion and contribute to the resolution of global problems. Governments tend to translate these multiple expectations into roles and responsibilities, often backed by earmarked funding or with conditions attached to general budgets. Higher education institutions themselves tend to take on a wider set of activities, partly through political and social pressure and partly in response to market opportunities.\n\nThe result can be an accumulation of mission elements, leading to the risk of mission overload. Higher education institutions increasingly face the challenge to strategically consider their basic focus and portfolios.\n\n2. Global research competition\n\nOn a worldwide scale, company labs are increasingly putting an end to their basic research activities. Companies are concentrating on short-term results, while adopting a strategic global approach to more basic research increasingly reliant on offshore partnerships, academic collaboration and outsourcing to established networks of scientific expertise.\n\nNational innovation policies, with their emphasis on the application of new knowledge, serve to encourage universities and other research organisations to participate in these new global research networks. There appears to be increasing competition between nations to make themselves attractive to footloose corporate R&D investments. In their innovation policies nations aim to prioritise and concentrate their own research expenditures to achieve competitive scale and quality. In addition, nations increasingly show a willingness to coordinate their own research investments with large international research budgets, like those of the European Union.\n\nAs a result, universities and research institutions are confronted with the challenge of selecting and investing in those research fields in which they can compete on a global scale. This often requires risky investments in research teams, major facilities and equipment. The current global research competition drives universities towards new forms of strategic management forcing them to make major strategic choices regarding their research portfolios and to marshal their resources effectively and efficiently.\n\n3. Higher education system diversity\n\nIn the context of innovation, higher education institutions are not only stimulated to focus on relevant knowledge production. They are also urged to increase participation rates and particularly the supply of well-trained âknowledge workersâ in prioritised sectors in order to support the creation of effective human capital, needed for a successful implementation of the national innovation policy.\n\nGlobalisation and the focus on innovation in many countries appear to trigger diversification policies in higher education. The urge to diversify â both in terms of programmes offered and in terms of institutional profiles â appears to be a key knock-on effect of national innovation strategies in many higher education systems. The literature suggests two key factors assumed to have an impact on the level of diversity: governmental regulation and market competition, both affecting diversity in different ways. Governmental regulation (for instance the creation or maintenance of a binary system) is thought to limit the scope for higher education institutions to develop their own profiles and so can be expected to limit diversity. At the same time, regulation is sometimes deemed a ânecessary evilâ to forestall academic drift (and consequently homogenisation). Market competition is thought to offer leeway for institutional profiling and therefore is assumed to lead to higher levels of diversity. But markets also lure organisations into mimicking successful players and hence also foster homogenisation.\n\nIt has been suggested that the strategic positioning of individual higher education institutions, and particularly their ability to occupy favourable niche positions, may play an important role in terms of the overall level of diversity among higher education systems. Both governments and higher education institutions themselves increasingly focus on the strategic development of a widening range of teaching and learning programmes and specific institutional educational portfolioâs.\n\n4. Strategic challenges, the need for profiling\n\nBringing the consequences together, the need for institutional profiling becomes evident. First, because of the increasing expectations and challenges, higher education institutions need to reassess and clarify their missions, goals and priorities, carefully defining their institutional profiles. In addition, the increasing global competitiveness strengthens the need for profiling. Strategic research management â including a deliberation with whom to compete AND with whom to collaborate â is therefore one of the most important aspects of modern higher education leadership. Modern research management implies a clear view of an institutionâs research strengths and weaknesses in a competitive global research market and the courage to select and develop a set of research field priorities as a major defining part of the institutional profile. Finally, the need for profiling furthermore stems from governmentsâ imperatives regarding their national higher education systems. Governments often seek an increasing diversity of the overall sets of higher education programmes and urge higher education institutions to contribute to this diversification.\n\nAll these factors force higher education institutions to carefully consider their strategic choices regarding their activities and performances. In other words, they are incentives for higher education institutions to sharpen their institutional profiles and to develop them as key strategic tools in positioning their institution in both their national higher education system and international context.\n\nIV. Institutional profiles and strategic choice: a theoretical base\n\nInstitutional profiles display what the institution does, how good it is at it and how it compares to other institutions. As was suggested earlier, institutional profiles can be divided into activity profiles and performance profiles. Activity profiles describe the actual activities of an institution in terms of focus, volume, priorities, etc. Activity profiles are descriptive and map the set of activities that defines the various tasks that an institution sets for itself. Performance profiles are evaluative, they show how well an institution performs these tasks, and hence imply a judgement in terms of the output and impact of an institutionâs activities.\n\nGenerally speaking, an institutionâs profile reflects the dimensions of its mission. These can be the well-known basic dimensions of teaching & learning, research and knowledge exchange or transfer. But an institution may wish to emphasise other dimensions as equally important aspects of its mission, such as international orientation or regional engagement.\n\nBy providing information about the activities and/or performance of a higher education institution in terms of the dimensions of its mission, institutional profiles serve as transparency instruments allowing both internal and external actors (including students, funders, governments) to get to know the institution and to assess it as a potential fit with their needs and priorities.\n\nIn order to learn how to grasp the topic of institutional profiles we turn â building on earlier work â to the corporate sector literature. Not surprisingly, there are different perspectives on organisational profiling in that corporate sector literature, but for our purpose, a distinction between inside-out and outside-in perspectives is deemed relevant.\n\nOutside-in perspectives argue that environmental factors determine to a large extent the scope for organisational action. The population ecology approach would be an extreme version of this, arguing that environments select organisations and individual organisations do not have or limited strategic intent. Insofar as organisations have strategic intent, this is largely overshadowed by the powers of environmental forces determining populations` growth rates and organisations` survival rates. Also new institutional theory stresses the role of the environment: the environment âforcesâ organisations to comply with institutional norms and values. A similar emphasis on environments (markets) can be found in Porterâs work. He urges businesses to focus on competition, achieving strong market positions and creating a competitive advantage. The market position is key in the outside-in approach and âonlyâ then resources are considered.\n\nAt the other end of the spectrum, we see perspectives that stress much more the role of internal capabilities, competencies and resources. The resource-based view, for instance, argues that the business strength should be taken as a point of departure. Businesses should focus on developing difficult-to-imitate products or services and subsequently suitable markets should be found.\n\nFor other perspectives it is sometimes difficult to locate these on the inside-out versus outside-in dimension. Some scholars take an intermediate stance in the debate and argue that both the environment and internal capabilities need to be taken into account. For instance, the resource dependency approaches would stress the overwhelming importance of resources in the environment that need to be acquired to survive. But at the same time, it argues that the internal perceptions, deliberations, negotiations and coalition formation play an important role. These internal forces are not explicitly labelled as capabilities or competencies by Pfeffer and Salancik (1978) but can be seen as such if one were to compare their perspective with e.g. the resource-based view. Likewise, relatively recent developments in institutional theory argue for more attention to the role of agency in institutional change. These authors argue that powerful agents in organisational fields can affect the environment and institutional rules and, consequently, create space for other types of organisations that are able to acquire significant levels of legitimacy. In other words, although environments put pressure on organisations to conform to institutional rules, there is also scope for entrepreneurial and strategic action to deviate from existing rules.\n\nThe jury is still out whether inside-out and outside-in perspectives can or should be combined. For the purpose of this paper, we think it is sound to posit the following, quoting Fumasoli and Huisman:\n\nâ¦ higher education institutions respond to demands, opportunities and threats offered by the environment by displaying different degrees of agency: from reacting and adapting, to intervening dynamically to modify the context in which they are embedded. Organisational positioning is the result of both organisational action and environmental determination. Positioning is partly avoiding competition by carving out a sustainable niche in which it offers a mix of services, and partly competing on selected activities in different markets (for students, for staff, for funds) with a subset of institutions in the higher education system.\n\nNow that we have explored the potential theoretical foundations of institutional profiles, let us turn to the question how these institutional profiles can be developed in practice. In the next section, four different tools are offered.\n\nV. Institutional profiles: operational tools\n\nIn this section we discuss a set of practical and operational instruments that allow both internal and external higher education stakeholders to present and analyse institutional profiles.\n\n1. Mapping\n\nâMappingâ is an interesting way to present institutional activity profiles. When a profile is âmappedâ, the focus is on describing its various activities. Rather than taking a specific ideal type as the base for comparing a variety of profiles (as is the case in a number of current rankings), a mapping exercise begins by making the range of profiles visible and transparent and only focuses at comparing institutions with similar (or largely similar) profiles. In addition, instead of comparing all possible profiles, this approach compares apples with apples and oranges with oranges. It aims to portray the specific activity profiles of comparable individual institutions in a number of profile dimensions.\n\nThe European U-Map tool has been developed to allow the creation and analysis of these activity profiles, offering snapshots of an institutionâs activities on different dimensions. U-Map can be accessed online and offers two tools (the Profile Finder and the Profile Viewer) that allow stakeholders to analyse institutional profiles and carry out specific comparative studies (benchmarking). The six dimensions of U-Map are: teaching & learning; student profile; research involvement; regional engagement; involvement in knowledge exchange; and international orientation. For each dimension, sets of indicators have been developed, with institutional profiles comprising the scores on all or a certain number of the dimensions. A profile reflects those areas where an institution is active and indicates the intensity of activities per dimension.\n\nOf course it is up to the higher education institutions to choose their own profiles but once this is done, a mapping exercise allows for effective and useful benchmarking processes (see below). In addition, a university that knows its activity profile well and knows which counterpart institutions have similar profiles is able to identify to external stakeholders the role and position it occupies within its higher education system and how it wants to be held accountable.\n\n2. Multidimensional ranking\n\nMultidimensional ranking is a transparency tools that allows the presentation and analysis of institutional performance profiles. MultiÂ­diÂ­menÂ­sional ranking is very different from the well-known and highly visible global university rankings. Multidimensional ranking implies an approach to comparing institutional performance profiles based on a number of crucial so-called âdesign principlesâ. Starting from the fundamental epistemological point of view that âobjective rankingsâ cannot be developed, multidimensional ranking is user-driven (users construct their own rankings based on their selection of dimensions and indicators), multidimensional (reflecting a multiplicity of functions of higher education institutions), focused on comparable institutions only (comparing profiles that are sufficiently similar), multi-level (comparing performance at an institutional and at a âfieldâ level) and methodologically sound (avoiding composite indicators, and taking into account disciplinary, language and cultural differences).\n\nThe U-Multirank tool), which is based on these design principles, enables its users to identify comparable institutions and programmes, to create both institutional and field level performance profiles of individual institutions, and to undertake comparative performance analyses of institutions and programmes. U-Multirank consists of five performance dimensions (teaching and learning, research, knowledge transfer, international orientation, regional engagement) and a range of indicators for each dimension from which the users can choose.\n\nU-Multirank provides its users with an on-line functionality to create two general types of rankings:\n\nâ focused institutional rankings: rankings on the indicators of a (selection of) the five performance dimensions at the level of an institution as a whole.\n\nâ field-based rankings: rankings on the indicators of a (selection of) performance dimensions in a specific (disciplinary) field.\n\n3. Benchmarking\n\nBenchmarking can be seen as a âlogicalâ follow-up to mapping and multidimensional ranking, but benchmarking can take place independently from the phase of an extensive search for comparable partners. Burquel and van Vught present benchmarking as an exercise going beyond current quality approaches and define it as ââ¦ the process of self-evaluation and self-improvement through the systematic and collaborative comparison of practice and performance with similar organisations in order to identify strengths and weaknesses, to learn how to adapt and improve organisational processesâ. The basic idea is that benchmarking is a self-analysis and quality-enhancing tool. Through a systematic comparison of central institutional processes with other higher education institutions, an organisation will gain insight in potential improvements of its performance. A crucial difference with other quality instruments is that the organisations involved in the benchmarking process set the performance targets themselves, i.e. they are not forced up by external quality assurance agencies. This arguably leads to a stronger sense of commitment and engagement with the improvement process. Furthermore, it has other added value for it will likely lead to strategic decision-making based on systematic gathering of relevant data.\n\nVan Vught and others â on the basis of a project funded by the European Commission â report on experiences with benchmarking processes. They argue that the following format may be helpful as a generic template for benchmarking. That format consists of four steps. The first one entails defining priorities, targets, criteria, indicators and benchmarks for all institutions involved in the process. The second step involves gathering the relevant data to âscoreâ each of the institutions on all benchmark indicators. Third, an in-depth analysis should take place of the processes behind the scores followed by developing relevant action plans for improvement. The last stage relates to the implementation of the action plan and concluding the benchmarking cycle. Obviously, the benchmarking cycle can â for those institutions that think this is relevant and worthwhile â be repeated. Alternatively, an institution performing at satisfactory levels can decide to focus on other facets of its functioning.\n\nIn benchmarking processes, (elements of) institutional activity profiles or institutional performance profiles can form an effective starting point. Using a âmappingâ tool, which will produce activity profiles, or a multidimensional ranking tool, which will offer performance profiles, allows actors involved in a benchmarking process to compare activities and/or performances of a set of higher education institutions. Based on jointly undertaken comparative analyses, a focused quality improvement process can then be designed and implemented.\n\n4. Degree profiles\n\nA particularly relevant approach for teaching and learning is to be found in the idea of degree profiles, developed in the context of the Tuning project. Degree profiles can be conceived of as a potentially fruitful elaboration of the âteaching and learningâ dimension of the mapping and multidimensional tools mentioned before. In both U-Map and U-Multirank this dimension is being distinguished and operationalised by offering sets of indicators. Degree profiles capture the âessenceâ of specific study programmes and hence they offer the possibility to link these to the indicators to be applied in the other transparency tools.\n\nLokhoff et al. suggest that degree profiles should be designed to summarise the essential information about a specific study programme. It âlocates the programme in the academic map of disciplines and thematic studiesâ. The profile specifies subject areas and the competences and learning outcomes that graduates will have achieved upon completion of the degree. It does not only function as a tool of transparency â allowing for international comparisons of degree contents â but also allows for differentiation. Higher education institutions can include specialisations, strong points, etc. in their degree profiles, which could be an add-on to the general institutional profile.\n\nDegree profiles are powerful reference points for various stakeholders. Students and instructors can use them to discuss, analyse and administer learning programmes, courses, assignments and assessments. Institutions can make use of them in curriculum development and degree planning. Quality assurance agencies and accrediting organisations can apply them when addressing the quality of programmes and institutions.\n\nIn terms of institutional profiling, degree profiles offer a base for higher education institutions on which they can build and present their own teaching and learning activities and performances. As such they can be part of the broader profiling tools such as U-Map and U-Multirank and assist higher education institutions to focus on transparency and quality in their educational functions.\n\nVI. Conclusions\n\nThe analysis presented above makes clear that higher education institutions can and must make strategic choices. For higher education institutions it is of utmost importance to carefully think through which position they want to take in the national and global higher education landscapes and to consider whether these positions are sustainable. Finding, analysing and communicating their profiles has become a major strategic challenge for any higher education institution.\n\nTheoretically both the outside-in perspectives (focusing on the challenges that arise from global and national markets) and inside-out perspectives (focusing on strengths, competencies and capabilities) will be helpful to guide higher education institutions in these processes. In operational terms we have offered a set of tools that can assist higher education institutions to present, compare and analyse their profiles.\n\nIf higher education institutions are able to position themselves and develop sound and robust profiles, governments will be better able to answer questions like: do we have the best set of institutional profiles in the context of the global competition for talent and knowledge? Do we have the best range of profiles in order to further develop our knowledge economy? Do we have the best possible spread and critical mass of research units and infrastructures? In addition, by studying these profiles other stakeholders will be able to be better informed about the various ways different higher education institutions respond to their needs and interests. Finally for higher education institutions themselves institutional profiles offer fruitful and effective ways to better understand, analyse and position themselves in the rapidly changing contexts they are confronted with.\n\nBibliography\n\nBalzat, Marcus.

The Tuning Approach\n\nJulia GonzÃ¡lez and Maria Yarosh\n\nAbstract: The development of degree profiles is an important art which has become quite specialized in recent years. This article concentrates on the analysis of the importance of the role of degree profiles in the design of degrees and, as a consequence, in Higher Education in general. It analyses, particularly, the work of the Tuning Project and its main processes in relation to profile building. It also gathers together and systematizes the specific contribution of four main components which should be taken into consideration at the time of the creation of new qualifications: two of the components relate to the analysis of social and professional needs and the future trends in the area. Both of these elements provide the relevance which a degree profile should strive to attain. The third component, the reference to the meta-profile, provides a capacity for recognition throughout an entire region and also in relation to the global context. The last element in profile development takes into consideration the university where the programme is anchored, its mission and strengths.\n\nKeywords: Degree; degree profile; reference points and meta-profiles; recognition; relevance; quality; social needs; levels; competences and learning outcomes; educational programme.\n\nI. Introduction and context\n\nThe recent publication Communities of Learning: Networks and the Shaping of Intellectual Identity in Europe, 1100-1500 explores the fundamental insight that all new ideas are developed in the context of a community, whether academic, religious, or simply as a network of friends. This article arises from the context of an experience of more than 30 years of deep commitment to Higher Education (HE hereafter) of international academic communities (first at European and then at global level) engaged in student mobility, credit development, building international curricula as well as responding to the specific needs of projects in Thematic Networks. These were real Communities of Learning amongst whom ideas about HE developed and flourished. The article owes a lot to the questions shared with hundreds of academics who have been searching and exploring new ways of carrying out the unending task of opening the minds of younger generations not only to know and understand reality but also to imagine it differently, to judge the level of accuracy and the implications of their innovative perspectives and to search for ways of realizing them. This paper is heavily in debt to the international groups of colleagues who have shared the work of trying to design and deliver many international joint degrees, research and educational projects, and above all to the group of people who contributed to the systematization of processes and the development of concepts in the Tuning Project which seem to serve and be able to bridge continents achieving the acceptance of the international academic community. The Tuning Project, a Network of Communities of Learning, has been shaping the intellectual identity of HE for over ten years now, not only in Europe but in Latin America, USA, Russia, Africa... and other regions of the world.\n\nII. Degrees in the age of convergence and diversity\n\nThe speed at which changes in HE have occurred in the last two decades should not blur for us the time span that it has taken to arrive at the contemporary multi-task university with high levels of sophistication in degree design and delivery. The process has been very long, starting with a basic structure that remained the fundamental model. This evolved through time and become diversified in terms of subjects taught, the organisation of studies and the methods of teaching and examining, especially within national contexts. The structure of studies, however, remained quite fixed. Evolution in the last twenty years has been very rapid and was linked with international co-operation.\n\nIt was not until the Sorbonne and the Bologna Declarations that degrees would become the essential focal point of the European Higher Education Area and the need to reflect on the definition(s) and constitutive elements of the degrees was identified. It is at this time that an ever increasing number of countries have agreed to strive for a common definition of degrees, a common understanding of their constitutive elements and a common language to go beyond mere words and titles to the comprehension of the processes of learning that these are meant to provide. The centrality of degrees for the Bologna process is well recognised, however, the degree of success of the process is sometimes in question.\n\nStudies on the level of achievement of the Bologna Reforms show the significance of the impact. However, as Barbara Kehm observes, while there is a considerable degree of convergence at the macro-level â in cases such as the system-wide introduction of a tripartite tiered structure of degrees or the use of the European credit â there is still considerable heterogeneity at the meso- (higher education institutions) and micro-levels (study proÂ­gramÂ­mes). She also considers that some elements of the Bologna reform agenda such as modularisation, learning outcomes and their assessment are not well understood in many systems and thus create a further element of divergence. This is in agreement with Veiga who observes that while at the macro level there is a clear element of increasing convergence, the main difficulty lies at the level of the individual countries. The latter argues that the change has taken place at the institutional and departmental level with curriculum reforms affecting professional roles and academic disciplines. The impact of the national factor is also recognized by Sin who, after the analysis of three countries through a qualitative approach using cultural interpretation theory points out that the prevalent perceptions of the Bologna reforms are decoded differently by academics in these three countries; showing that National cultural factors continue to play an important role in the context of decisions taken at Joint Ministerial level. However, due to the fact that the process initiated by the Bologna Declaration was and is a joint, collaborative experience, the evaluation of the success becomes as tentative and un-dogmatic as processes can be. It also becomes attractive and appealing to other regions who want to join in the collective search and learning and perhaps this speaks for its success and impact.\n\n1. Defining degrees and their components\n\nGiven the paramount importance of degrees and as an introduction to their profiles, it is worthwhile to analyse: first the definition of degrees and second the elements which constitute them. Five bodies and associations have been engaged in the definition of degrees and in the consideration of their components:\n\n1. The Ministerial groups in meetings and declarations in which degrees had a significant level of centrality;\n\n2. The group related to the Joint Quality Initiative later becoming the European Qualifications Framework;\n\n3. The European University Association;\n\n4. The Council of Europe-Higher Education; and\n\n5. The Tuning Project.\n\nThe definition of Degrees from the Ministerial Group, with possibly the highest impact, due to its level of decision and also concreteness, comes from the Berlin CommuniquÃ©: âMinisters encourage the member States to elaborate a framework of comparable and compatible qualifications for their higher education systems, which should seek to describe qualifications in terms of workload, level, learning outcomes, competences and profileâ.\n\nA definition of degrees was produced by the collective effort of a group made up mainly of Quality Agencies and Ministerial experts, which brought about A Framework of Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area: âAny degree, diploma or other certificate issued by the competent authority attesting that particular learning outcomes have been achieved, normally following the successful completion of a recognized higher education programme of studyâ. This group also developed the Dublin Descriptors and contributed significantly with the concept of degree level, concentrating on the primary importance of the learning outcomes as the dominant characteristic of new degrees.\n\nThe European University Association offers a unique quantitative perspective through its Trends Studies, in which it considers that a large majority of institutions have implemented the new Bologna degree structure: from 53% of institutions in 2003 to 95% in 2010. However, in terms of degrees analysis, EUA mainly concentrates on the study of Master and Doctoral Degrees, particularly joint degrees as can be seen by analysing the publications of the European University Association in their web.\n\nIn relation to the Council of Europe, the contribution of Sjur Bergan needs to be highlighted. He comments on the existing state of affairs in Qualifications - Introduction to a concept and arrives at the synthesis of the elements which constitute a degree. These main elements he identifies as: Level, workload, quality, profile, and learning outcomes and competences, both generic and subject-specific competences. He also considers that degrees are a key element of higher education policies in general and of the Bologna Process in particular with the consequence that a proper understanding of qualifications is essential to making the European Higher Education Area a reality.\n\nGiven that the fifth body â the Tuning community is the focus of the present paper, this is discussed in a separate section although in terms of time, the systematic works of the academics starts early in 2001.\n\n2. Tuning definition and analysis of the degree components in a context of diversity\n\nIn order to be consistent with the Tuning philosophy, diversity should be dealt with from the start. It was a clear concern in the Declarations of Sorbonne and Bologna and in the follow up CommuniquÃ©s and it is absolutely vital to Tuning. The whole setting of the Tuning exercise is in an intercultural, international, inter-traditional-cultures context and the dialogue is an intercultural dialogue from beginning to end. The reaffirmation of diversity is an intrinsic motor in the development of the project and a constant concern in all its processes. The tension between the identification of the common and the richness of the diverse runs in each of the documents of the Tuning Project which now come from different parts of the world. In the first report in 2003, it is explained that: âThe protection of the rich diversity of European education has been paramount in the Tuning Project from the very startâ. This reaffirmation will be found again and realized in thirty one new documents, some recently published, others due to be published in 2013 related to the new studies in Latin America, Russia and Africa.\n\nThe very first definition of the Bologna Degrees as such came from the Tuning Project. From the year 2001, the members of the Tuning Project worked on a definition that was laid out in the Glossary in 2003: âQualification awarded by a higher education institution after successful completion of a prescribed programme of study. In a credit accumulation system, the programme is completed through the accumulation of a specified number of credits awarded for the achievement of a specific set of learning outcomesâ. In this Formative Phase of Tuning (2001-2005) the analysis of degrees took place under five different lines of investigation: (1) Generic competences; (2) Subject specific competences; (3) European credits; (4) Approaches to Teaching, Learning and Assessment; and (5) Programme quality. These lines gave birth to the first definition of Tuning degree components as: profile; learning outcomes and competences (generic and subject specific); level; workload; approaches to teaching/ learning and assessment; and programme quality.\n\nRelating to the work of Tuning during this first stage, the identification of the components and the structuring of degrees constituted the main collective finding and set the scene for later developments. The articulation of the whole system slowly became a reality as the profile was expressed at a particular degree level in terms of learning outcomes and competences. These competences were then jointly defined and discussed in consultation with social partners, both in terms of importance and in terms of university performance. This empirical exercise provided a concrete setting, in which to reflect, discuss and welcome the diversity. The articulation of degrees in terms of credits (present in the definition of the glossary) revealed that the dimension of the time required to achieve the learning outcomes is an integral part of the whole concept of the degree. In addition, it was very important to consider the relevance and appropriateness of different methodologies of teaching, of learning and of assessing the desired learning outcomes. The final element: programme quality was the last element to be identified as of critical importance for ensuring the consistency of the whole system and the accountability required.\n\nThe image of the jigsaw puzzle where the different pieces fitted together (Figure 1 below) accompanied the second phase of Tuning (2006-2009), the phase of consolidation and expansion.\n\nFigure 1\n\nBringing degree development elements together.\n\nA further essential identity mark inherited during this period related to the Reference Points. The Reference points, or the set of competences and learning outcomes which the Tuning Communities of Learning considered as essential for the identification of degrees in different fields of study gained popularity, validity, depth and recognition by academic communities all over the world. The development of further reference points both at the level of new disciplines as well as in relation to new areas brought further elements for reflection.\n\nThe Latin American experience revealed the importance of academic credits for a quality development of degree profiles. While in Europe, credits were introduced primarily as a tool for promoting mobility, in Latin America the experience proved that a quality degree could not be designed without an internal understanding of the units of learning and their temporal demands. At the same time the three forces which had been at the root of the Tuning concept of degrees from the beginning, became stronger. Tuning Degrees could be identified with the search for relevance, recognition and quality. This awareness of the fundamental forces driving the process brought further insights and direction.\n\nThese experiences, debates and further analysis brought the Tuning Project to the third period (2010-2013) which could be referred to as the specialization phase. In fact, the different components of the Tuning analysis of degrees can be understood from a more wholesale approach. There are three specific clusters of processes in relation to the development of degrees. The first cluster relates to the development of degree profiles, the second relates to academic programmes and the third deals with the personalised path for each of the learners. Each of these processes has two components: one of design and the other of implementation.\n\nWhile the rest of this article will concentrate on the set of processes relating to the designing of degree profiles, it is important to emphasize that the other two clusters of processes are of great significance. Updated, socially and professionally required profiles could be built satisfactorily but these would be misleading if they were unsuccessfully transformed into programmes to guarantee their implementation or if they were inadequate for the real-life students who, in practice, tried to follow them.\n\nAn educational programme transfers the profile into the curriculum. The programme needs to be designed to assure consistency between the profile promised and the learning processes at work, between the set of competences and the ways to develop and acquire them. To design an academic programme is an exercise in consistency. This consistency needs to touch every element: the learning strategies involving the specific elements of theoretical and practical learning, the international paths involved, the planned experiences and the levels at which the competences need to be developed as well as the number of academic credits devoted to each educational component of the programme.\n\nThe last cluster relates to the path of the individual learner. In a student-centred learning system, each learner needs to follow a personal road that takes him/her through a particular programme. Relevant to this context is the evaluation of how the student initiates the process, his/her starting point, the recognition of prior learning achieved, as these elements are important to the understanding of individual strengths and weaknesses and very specially the personal motivations and aims which can be the engines bringing the process to a successful completion. A further crucial consideration is the awareness of specific styles of learning. This is particularly important in an age where ICT and images invade the mind and may give special importance and necessity to capacities such as abstract thinking.\n\nDuring recent years in the Tuning process, the tasks of developing degrees have become quite diverse and demanding. Looking at the division of labour in universities, it may be considered as a specialisation issue. Since, there are some who prepare the profiles (profile designers), others who specialise in the articulation of the different elements of the programme to implement the profiles (programme developers). Still others are in charge of accompanying and stimulating the learning process (the teachers) or of following the personal road of each of the peopleâs learning paths (the tutors).\n\nThe rest of this article will concentrate on the development of the first cluster â degree profiles â and the work of those who are responsible for developing them.\n\nIII. Building degree profiles\n\nThe definition of degree profiles has advanced significantly through reflection during the latest period of the Tuning project. It appeared first as a rather tentative definition in A framework for Qualifications of the European Higher Education Area: âeither the specific (subject) field(s) of learning of a qualification or to the broader aggregation of clusters of qualifications or programmes from different fields that share a common emphasis or purpose (e.g. an applied vocational as opposed to more theoretical academic studiesâ. The text points out, then, to the work of the Tuning Project as a reference for profile building. In fact, reshaping slightly the definition given in A Guide to Formulating Degree Programme Profiles it may be concluded that a Degree profile describes the specific characteristics of a qualification in terms of learning outcomes and competences.\n\nAnother definition is offered by the Degree Qualifications Profile. This interesting combination for the American context supported by the Lumina Foundation and where Degree profiles encompass the qualifications framework, which are two different concepts in the European setting, defines it as âA Degree Profile â or qualifications framework â illustrates clearly what students should be expected to know and be able to do once they earn their degrees â at any level. This Degree Profile thus proposes specific learning outcomes that benchmark the associate bachelorâs and masterâs degrees.\n\nHowever, the latest definition of a degree profile for Tuning was given on the 21st of November 2012, after a long process of reflection and debate within the standing projects of Tuning in Latin America, Russia and Africa, and describes the degree profile as a combination of forces around four poles:\n\n1. The needs of the subject area (from the local to the more international context)\n\n2. The meta-profile of a specific field, the structured points of reference\n\n3. The consideration of future trends in the profession and society\n\n4. The specific mission of the institution.\n\nNext, reference will be made of each of the elements and their impact in Degree Profiling.\n\n1. Analysis of social needs and professional demands\n\nThe issue of relevance is paramount for the design of degree profiles. Without a doubt, the analysis of the relationship between university and society is at the core of the theme of relevance in higher education. Nevertheless, examining these relations should be conducted carefully. TÃ¼nnermann and de Souza warn that when the relevance of higher education is addressed, there is a tendency to reduce the concept to that of the appropriate response to the demands of the economy or the business sector. They assert that higher education should indeed meet these demands, but that relevance transcends economic and labour concerns. They argue that the society-university tandem should be examined in a broader perspective taking account of the challenges and demands presented to it by society as a whole. What is involved is translating the overall aims and purposes of society in terms of the tasks incumbent upon higher education, in both its quantitative and its qualitative aspects.\n\nGiven the multiplicity of stakeholders and the differentiated expectations that they place on higher education, striking a balance between employability, citizenship, and personal growth, becomes a challenge. In an attempt to address such a challenge, Tuning has developed, from the start, a particular methodology to build and re-develop degree programmes that respond to these multiple aspirations. This exercise requires a better articulation between universities, and the problems as well as society and the world of work, basing long-term orientations on societal aims and needs, including respect for cultures and environmental protection. One more concern is the identification of the right mix of skills and their translation to curricula so that higher education graduates may be able to face current â and prospective â needs, to satisfy employment and social demands, and to contribute to the betterment of their societies and closer environments.\n\nIn addition to these broad social aspirations, there are other academic and labour imperatives that need to be met, namely the needs of the knowledge society. The OECD, for example, stresses the role of tertiary education in fostering research, innovation and development, and suggests the development of educational policies articulating clearly the nationâs expectations of the tertiary education system and aligning priorities of individual institutions with the nationâs economic and social goals.\n\nTuning aims at identifying and addressing the needs of the productive sector, of the economy, of society as a whole, and the needs of individual learners within a particular area of study and mediated by their specific social and cultural contexts. In order to strike a balance between these varied needs, goals and aspirations, Tuning has undertaken consultations with leading persons, key local thinkers and experts from industry, academia, and civil society, and working groups that include all stakeholders. These practices are explained below.\n\nThe search for relevance is one of the driving forces behind Tuning exercises destined to:\n\n1. Understand, discuss and enrich the definition of generic and subject specific competences;\n\n2. Reflect critically on the needs and the strengths of their own region and the thematic and professional fields related to their own field;\n\n3. Know how other regions of the world position themselves in this respect;\n\n4. Provide for a frame of reference for later individual Degree profiling;\n\n5. Be aware of shortages and gaps present in the area;\n\n6. Reflect on the characteristics of the citizens who can best contribute to a culture of the region and world culture of democracy, sustainability and human rights; and\n\n7. Consult with other discussion groups selected in each of the academic communities.\n\nIn order to accomplish this first collective task of defining generic competences for the specific region, each Subject Area Group is asked to prepare a list of the generic/ transversal competences considered to be relevant to their perspective region. They reflect and discuss first their own understanding of the socio-economic needs of the area. They, then, analyse lists found in the current literature and those selected by previous Tuning groups such as the 31 generic competences identified in Europe, 27 identified in Latin America, 30 in Russia and 18 for Africa amongst others. In addition, there are the contributions from different participants in the project. This task is finalised when the group has understood, broadly discussed and reached consensus on a selection of competences thought to be the most appropriate for the region. This is done from a rich intercultural perspective since the participants come from different countries and cultural backgrounds. The final stage takes place at the general group level where understanding, debate and agreement has to be reached for all of all the Subject Area Groups involved. It is a process of enrichment and responsibility raising awareness, where relevance takes shape and becomes the common language at group level.\n\nThe second task is similar to the first and relates to defining specific competences for a particular Subject Area. The questions reach another level of specificity. From their particular background, how would each group of academics define their specific area? Which competences are the core contributions of each of the areas to the development and advancement of society? Which are the core elements in a particular subject area, field of knowledge or area of interest and how could they be determined? Which competences can be considered core for those attaining a qualification in this particular field and at each of the levels? Which, while not being core, are most needed in the region? The intercultural debates end with the final choice of competences that can define the specific cohorts of learners who reach a degree.\n\nA major check on relevance needs to be undertaken against the entire list which has been agreed. The analysis seeks to measure the degree to which the competences selected by academics are seen by a broader society as leading to basic required levels of employability and active citizenship. This search for relevance has recently been redefined as: âpreparing for sustainable employment; preparation for life as active citizens in democratic societies; personal development; [and] development and maintenance, through research, teaching, and learning, of a broad, advanced knowledge baseâ. It is the personal, professional, institutional and social responsibility, which could be referred to in different ways, which responds to the necessity of placing knowledge and capacity at the service of social development and innovation.\n\nThe next task relates to the process of consultation. This requires (1) understanding of the reasons behind the consultation as well as the value attached to this practice; (2) selecting the mode of consultation which is considered most appropriate; (3) understanding the technical requirements; (4) acknowledging the existing traditions and literature; and (5) identifying, discussing and agreeing on the most relevant groups to be consulted (other academics, employers, students, graduates, professional bodies, government bodies, associations of citizens, platforms, think-tanks...).\n\nOnce the mode of consultation has been agreed and the process of that consultation has been completed, the final stage in this practical process of searching for social relevance refers to the analysis of the findings. This is carried out jointly by the group and special care is taken not to lose any of the contributions coming from the different cultural perceptions which can enlighten the understanding of the concrete reality, the most urgent needs, the recognised strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats and of how they should be planned for in terms of educational measures, taking into account the characteristics of the specialists and the citizens, the people who could offer an answer.\n\n2. The development of meta-profiles\n\nIn the first definition of profiles given above, there was a reference to âthe specific (subject) field(s) of learning of a qualificationâ. It is in the tradition of Tuning to build reference points for each of the fields and to offer an understanding of the specific academic area. Communities of Learning from different parts of the world have identified the core elements in terms of competences which would make a degree identifiable and hence recognisable. The analysis of the subject area is an integral part in the Tuning Project. One of the first steps is the debate on what each discipline is about, what the graduates normally do after completing the degree, how the field is structured and linked to other fields. The joint reflection on the specific subject area, the understanding of its identity as an academic field, the essence of its conÂ­tribution to society and the mapping not only of the field but also of the possible branches and jobs required are a necessary building block in the development of the Tuning process and the essence of future developments. This is a pre-condition, a step and a starting point towards any degree profile-building endeavour.\n\nThe need to build degrees capable of gaining recognition across the European Higher Education Area was one of the earliest aspirations of the Tuning experience, as well as a driving force. Debates on the core elements of every area constitute one of the essential processes in Tuning. This seeks the collective understanding of a particular field as well as the agreement on what constitutes core as opposed to diverse or specialized competences. It is critical to differentiate between the core elements and the specialized aspects introduced for different reasons into the different subject areas. As a result of this work, lists of specific competences are built and discussed in the different regions giving those participating ownership over the comprehension of each of the fields as well as ownership over the results.\n\nDuring the last two years a new step has been developed: Beyond providing the specific competences and carrying the consultation and the definition of the reference points, the Tuning participants undertook a further exercise, that of analysing these reference points, discussing their classification, structure and desired weight. Such questions as how they could be grouped, and as what are the linkages and the differences in importance, have led to the creation of meta-profiles. Tuning Subject Area Groups are real communities of practice following EckertÂ´s definition perfectly ready to carry out this task at regional level since they are formed by highly experienced academics in their respective areas. Besides, the Tuning Communities are continually open to parallel groups from other regions and other academic fields/areas of practice and can be, therefore, truly considered Communities or Networks of Learning as explained above. Subject Area Groups do not only agree on the lists of components that identified the core and the level of diversification but go further to classify the findings and create a structure, portraying how they understand the ways in which the components relate to each other. These are called meta-profiles.\n\nThus, a meta-profile is a representation of the structure and combination of competences which gives identity to a subject area. A meta-profile is a mental construct that categorizes competences into major recognized components and illustrates their interrelationship. The meta-profiles have become fruitful tools for reaching an understanding of a field of study at the level of the individual region. This brings a number of advantages. The first is the capacity to create collective understanding and to raise the level of the debate about essential elements and secondary additions in the field of medicine, history, agriculture or architecture, for example. Besides, this collective understanding is important for reaching common comprehension of degrees since it focuses on the centrality of the reference points and its weight in an educational programme. This representation also offers the possibility to reflect and discuss further on the combination of elements. This reflection and debate should normally lead to greater depth in the understanding and quality.\n\nThe second contribution relates to recognition. Recognition, very generally speaking, means validating a learning experience. Kohler considers that at a âmacro-levelâ, which is probably the more common interpretation of the word recognition is the question of whether or not an academic qualification acquired in one country is valid as a starting point for entering into the labour market â in as much as it is academically based â or for enrolling in a postgraduate programme in another country. In this respect, the focus is on the problem of whether or not an academic qualification acquired in one country is approximately equal to a learning experience, namely a qualification, acquired in another country. âIn the case of Europe, this relates to the common European labour market, an essential part of which is the mobility of people within Europe aided by the recognition of qualifications across bordersâ.\n\nTuning maintains that what is relevant for recognition is to have a proof of having achieved the desired set of outcomes. This approach allows for a broad variety of routes, approaches and processes to achieve the goals. Historians, for example, can study past developments in different geographical settings. They can do so by reference to a very wide range of methodologies. They can also explain contexts citing different traditions, variations of cultural institutions and events which belong to different contexts. However, the outcomes should be comparable in terms of the graduatesâ capacity to analyse societies in their evolution across time and transparent in the methodologies and rigour used in their research or in the language in which their findings are presented while allowing for academic debate to continue and deepen.\n\nThe conscious decision to focus on outcomes leads directly to the relevance of meta-profiles for recognition. The meta-profile presents an understanding not only of the core elements and their description but also of their identification and explanation in a language which is understood and readable. They offer the location, importance and weight of the different factors which make up the whole image. The meta-profiles give the contours within which degrees can be identified and recognised because the key elements are well portrayed.\n\nThe third advantage of developing meta-profiles is constituted by the possibilities they offer in terms of the development of joint degrees. Through the consideration of the meta-profile, the main elements of a degree profile may be identified and responsibilities for its construction be shared, based on a common understanding of the whole area. In this age of transnational degrees, tools which favour common understanding are particularly helpful.\n\nFinally, meta-profiles provide a new and different path to regionalisation and ultimately to globalisation. In Tuning, meta-profiles are built at the level of the region: Europe, Latin America, Africa.... jointly built, owned and later validated at regional level. There is normally a further level of comparison with other world regions and eventually at global level. However, this way of reaching the global level implies that it is again (as everything in Tuning) a bottom up approach, that is to say from the regions upwards, but in this case, each region owns its own processes and may agree to compare or share with another only if and when and to the extent they choose to do so. This way, the Tuning methodology respects the genuine elements of the local which are at the heart of the process. This makes a significant difference in terms of developing global indicators - bottom up rather than top-down - and creates a new and improved path to reach global indicators.\n\nIn order to clarify the concept of the meta-profile some examples are provided below. The case of the meta-profile for Chemistry developed by Tuning Latin America is used as the primary example. It will be compared briefly with two others, the one from a Tuning group in Russia and the other from Africa.\n\nThe Chemistry Subject Group from Latin America had taken the following path. The first stage was the very thorough analysis of the competences both generic and subject specific, redefining and reducing them to 17 which were, after a debate, grouped into four major categories called Factors:\n\nâ Factor 1 relating to the Learning Process and defined in terms of knowledge, the generic and specific competences related to it (see below).\n\nâ Factor 2 was identified as related to Social Values, marking their achievement in terms of the capacity to develop an autonomous and effective ability to develop all the different social, cultural and managerial aspects, ethical practice and knowledge to contribute to the best use of natural renewal and non-renewable resources to the benefit of humankind.\n\nâ Factor 3 was identified as the Technological and International Context, including the capacity to communicate in other languages, using diverse and most modern technological and computing resources to develop in the international arena.\n\nâ Factor 4 relates to interpersonal competences, focusing on the capacity to take decisions, develop autonomy in professional life, capacity to work in interdisciplinary and trans-disciplinary context related to Chemistry. Also included here is the capacity to organise, plan both individual and team work and solve new situations.\n\nSo the Chemistry competences were grouped as follows:\n\nTable 1\n\nChemistry subject area Generic (G) and Subject-Specific (S) competences organised in factors. Latin America (Adapted from Pedraza Aboytes, âHigher Educationâ)\n\nThe first factor related to knowing, the second to knowing how to be, the third to knowing how to do and finally the fourth looked at to knowing how to be and do.\n\nWith this classification a matrix of generic and specific competences for the field of Chemistry was developed (Table 2 below). As a product of the groupâs reflection and debate, the corresponding relationship between generic and specific competences was found, the relationships between then portrayed according to the classification factors.\n\nTable 2\n\nChemistry subject area competences: Matrix\n\nGeneric Competences (GC) and Subject-Specific Competences (SC) most relevant for the subject area are grouped into factors.

Five competences were shown as very central to the Chemistry degree: 13S (capacity to act with curiosity, initiative and entrepreneurial spirit; absolute centrality for all factors), 7S (capacity to plan, design and implement research projects), 4S (capacity to recognize and analyse problems and develop strategies to solve these problems), 14S (knowledge, ability to apply it and understanding of legal contexts), 12S (familiarity with laboratory good practices). Several conclusions can be drawn but it is clear that these five competences appeared at the heart of any Chemistry degree and they are critical for identity and recognition.\n\nDifferent methodologies for developing meta-profiles are analysed and presented in the intellectually challenging and thought provoking book the Tuning Meta-profiles for Latin America (in press, in Spanish, Portuguese and English) where 15 different scientific areas explained the roads followed to reach their representations. Each field (agronomy, architecture, business, civil engineering, chemistry, education, geology, history, informatics, law, mathematics, medicine, nursing, psychology and physics) is consistent with its own approach and develops its own mental understanding after a period of research and joint debate. This book is supplemented with 15 publications where every subject area group not only presents the reference points and meta-profile for the area and the methodology used but also the analysis carried out about future trends for the area, and reflections on workload for the specific field in the different Latin American countries as well as the development of a number of competences important for the scientific field.\n\nA similar series of publications has been prepared by the Tuning Russia project and has been published in June 2013 in Russian and in English. They relate to 11 scientific areas: ecology, economics, education, environmental engineering, foreign languages, ICT, interpreting and translation, law, management, social work and tourism. The ICT subject area group used the notion of meta-competences, and their approach and solution will be taken as an example here. Meta-competences are the main categories into which the learning outcomes of a certain higher-education professional area can be grouped. Introduction of the notion of meta-competences permits articulating major strands of competential development and makes clear the academic and professional contexts to which the degrees offered within this academic and professional area are related and to which, consequently, the degree profiles need to be linked.\n\nThe final version of the ICT subject area meta-profile is presented in Figure 3, with the different axes and relationships of competences.\n\nThe diagram of meta-profile for the ICT sub-area concerned is presented in the figure, with the different axes and relationships of competences. In order to get to this representation, the 20 key competences defined were analyzed one by one. Each competence was located into the cluster of competences with which it was the most closely connected, or, if there was not such cluster, a new cluster was created for this competence. By applying this procedure, the five groups of competences were formed and the meta-competences were identified to represent the core of degrees in the ICT subject area. The core element of the final set of meta-competences is the ability to join the professional community (MGC-3). This meta-competence is achieved by mastering both generic and subject-specific competences, considering ICT sub-disciplines (according to Computing Curricula) and Russian educational standards in this area.\n\nFigure 3\n\nICT subject area meta-profile. Russia .\n\nThe generic meta-competences in question are the ability to perceive, analyze and synthesize information (MGC-1) and the ability for self-development and self-improvement (MGC-2). The subject-specific meta-competences are the ability to understand, apply and develop mathematical knowledge, basic laws of natural science and fundamentals of information technologies (MSSC-1), that is the âgroup of competences related to Computer Science sub-discipline of ICTâ and the ability to design, develop, implement and manage life cycle processes of information systems and technologies (MSSC-2), that is the âgroup of competences related to Information Systems and Technologies sub-disciplines of ICTâ.\n\nThe last example considered here is the case of the Meta-profile for Civil Engineering in Africa (Figure 4 below). After following the processes of identification and consultation as in the previous cases, the experts worked on clustering the generic and subject specific competences which gave an understanding of their respective importance in the degree.\n\nFigure 4\n\nCivil engineering meta-profile (From Tuning Africa Civil Engineering\n\nSubject Area Group, âFinal Reportâ, 33).\n\nThe group of competences in the centre relates to the capacity to develop processes intrinsic to the field which are important to secure the identity of the area. In addition, it was critical, in the second stage, to make sure that these competences would have an appropriate place in the design of the programme. It was also of great relevance for delivery. These competences relate to the capacity to understand the characteristics of the field and be able to make them operational as a result of the understanding.\n\nThe group concurred that the three core clusters mentioned above were identified as central for Civil Engineering curricula. They were also in agreement about the weight of each of the components, with the capacity for Design and Analysis taking up a larger proportion of time. The group identified 18 generic competences that are crucial for a Civil Engineering Graduate. These 18 generic competences were then clustered at one level below that of the core clusters. The clusters were for the following areas: Critical Thinking, Professionalism, Creativity, Communication, Leadership and the ability to apply Regulations. After following a lengthy process of condensing the 54 subject specific competences as well as looking at the generic competences, the group identified the critical competences and systematized them into mega clusters.\n\nThe six clusters, that are those at one level below the core clusters, were further grouped together into Critical Thinking & Synthesis and Creativity. The second grouping is Leadership and Management and the third is Professionalism and Communication. These groupings were done to show that in an African Civil Engineering context, a graduate would need to acquire the same level of skill in all these clusters. The final step of setting up the Civil Engineering Meta Profile was to combine the core clusters with the clusters as shown in the graph. The core clusters are grouped together in a knowledge sphere and this sphere symbolises the capacity to handle in its different dimensions the knowledge that a student should gain in her/his undergraduate course. This includes learning all the different ways and methods of designing in the four different fields of Civil Engineering. The final step was to link optically the generic and subject specific competences to the Meta Profile that was identified. It can also be seen that certain competences appear more than once in the different clusters, as it is believed that the information can be transferred to the student in more than one field and/or in more than one way.\n\nThis development of Meta-Profiles created a possibility for a number of uses. Firstly, it allowed a great deal of real intercultural dialogue in relation to the understanding of how the different competences can be located in each degree. The experts, who came from different backgrounds in terms of their country of origin, cultural academic tradition and also of their different professional careers, arrived at an understanding of the main elements to be considered. Secondly, they were able to discuss how the different elements inter-related with each other and the level of centrality they occupied. Thirdly, in relation to the recognition of degrees, they found it of significant help to be able to see the weight of the core competences as against those located more in the periphery. Fourthly, each Subject-Area Group contrasted the meta-profile with a large and quite representative number of universities in the different countries in order to know which were the elements either missing or over-represented and how to improve the degrees in the various contexts. Further and very much to the point, these meta-profiles will serve as reference for the development of degree profiles in terms of the specificity of the region. Finally, it will be used to compare and contrast the regional perspective with the meta-profiles developed by other geographical areas, a bottom up way of reaching a global perspective.\n\n3. Consideration of future trends\n\nA concern for the relevance of higher education means a preoccupation with the present-day societal needs that it can help satisfy, but also a look into the input that degrees can have in shaping future societies and in anticipating social, economic, cultural and political changes. Designing degree profiles is basically an exercise in looking into the future. In the present context, degrees take time to be planned, developed and approved. Students need years to achieve their outcomes and mature in their learning and they are called to serve, to be prepared to act, innovate and to transform future societies and to meet future challenges. Profiles should look as much, if not more, to the future as to the present and this element of taking into account future trends in the specific field or fields where the degree is located, is a requirement for quality. Two things are then needed: to place an emphasis on the necessity of constant updating and to have a system to do so.\n\nThe Tuning project in Latin America tried to work on this task and initiated a methodology for introducing the analysis of future trends in the designing of profiles. In preparing to undertake this study, key contributions in the field of future and foresight studies were reviewed, revealing how well developed and sophisticated this foresight studies have become. Thus, methodology was adapted to the specific context placing an emphasis on some of the steps and opening the way for further analysis.\n\nThe first step looked at the state of the art and the most appropriate approaches available. Key contributions to future studies and strategic foresight fields recommend the study and assessment of the recent history and current situation before attempting to anticipate the future. This was carried out by the Tuning communities which debated current trends. They also discussed the contributions and limitations of the studies in foresight and strategic thinking and with a given methodology they prepared for in depth interviews. A generic text was adapted and the appropriate people general and field experts, leading professionals and academics, considered relevant for each of the different areas, were jointly selected to be interviewed.\n\nThe second step related to the general context of education. Many prospective studies have been undertaken in an effort to build future scenarios for higher education and to anticipate the challenges that higher education may face in the immediate future, as well as in the long run. These studies have underscored a wide array of driving forces that are more than likely to bring change to the state of affairs in higher education. They provide the general setting where the more specific study can rest. These studies focused on the necessary transformation of the traditional role of higher education institutions; they addressed educational policy and macro-tendencies, and sometimes institutional reform. They have proved to be important in analysing the impacts of societal changes. They open the road to the third st"
