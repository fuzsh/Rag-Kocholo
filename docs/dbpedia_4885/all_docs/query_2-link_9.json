        "text": "Home comforts: Kookaburras captain Eddie Ockenden shares some memories with Rob Shaw at his Hobart home in 2019. Picture: Scott Gelston\n\nWHEN I was 18, I needed income to finance my way through journalism college.\n\nSubscribe now for unlimited access .\n\nor signup to continue reading\n\nAll articles from our website & app\n\nThe digital version of Today's Paper\n\nBreaking news alerts direct to your inbox\n\nInteractive Crosswords, Sudoku and Trivia\n\nAll articles from the other in your area\n\nLike many teenagers, I worked at a fast-food \"restaurant\".\n\nThe job was uninspiring, the pay crap and the job satisfaction non-existent.\n\nOne night, while scraping all the blackened fat off a grill pan, I turned to a colleague carrying out a similarly mundane task and said: \"Journalism had better be worth it.\"\n\nI think of that moment often, but particularly when journalism is really worth it.\n\nRELATED NEWS\n\nThe doomsayers may predict it's a dying industry, and maybe they're right - as long as it waits until after me.\n\nBut when you find yourself at a major sporting event, in a seat you know people would sever body parts for, it's a timely reminder what a privilege it can be.\n\nA former photographer at The Examiner once said he spent every day waiting for someone to tap him on the shoulder and say: \"When are you going to get a real job?\"\n\nWith such privilege comes the responsibility of sharing what you witness from that seat with the reader. It is a task no journalist should take lightly.\n\nHappening on a good thing\n\nIn the three decades since getting the fat off that grill pan, I've reported on sport on both sides of the planet and many other places in between.\n\nAfter 13 years based in the English county of West Sussex, I've spent 17 in Tasmania - a state with roughly the same population albeit slightly more interest in AFL.\n\nIn addition to the match reports, since 2004 I've written a weekly column about sporting observations.\n\nAnd after much prodding, I've compiled my favorites into a book, which was released this week.\n\nChoosing which columns made the final cut was a lengthy, but hugely enjoyable experience. And it wasn't always the biggest or most publicised events that made the grade.\n\nThe doomsayers may predict journalism is a dying industry, and maybe they're right - as long as it waits until after me.\n\nRob Shaw shares a joke with basketball great Lauren Jackson when she visited Launceston in 2016. Picture: Scott Gelston\n\nIn 2008 I was afforded the honour of a guided tour of Flinders Island by Gerald Dilger - a fifth-generation islander who manages to drive 40,000 kilometres a year on the 64km-long corner of paradise, never takes the keys out of the ignition and can (and happily does) identify the owner of any cow he passes.\n\nDilger was one of the army of Flinders Island support crews for the Three Peaks Race, without whose help runners Mark Guy and Paul McKenzie wouldn't have been able to scale Mount Strzelecki and get back to their boat for the next leg down the East Coast to Coles Bay.\n\nRe-reading Dilger's unique approach to tourist information, it was never going to miss out.\n\nRob Shaw at the opening ceremony to the London Olympics in 2012.\n\nWhen I commented on the distinctive outline of Mount Chappell Island, home of the mutant giant tiger snakes, he said: \"That's one place I wouldn't want to go.\" \"Why? Don't you like snakes?\" \"Oh I don't mind snakes, I just wouldn't want to go to Mount Chappell Island - there's nothing there.\"\n\nEqually memorable was a visit to the Queensland backwater of Kybong - population 370 and one 13-metre tall former Commonwealth Games mascot called Matilda.\n\nOther experiences spanned the breadth of the world's great sporting locations, from the magnificent Maracana Stadium in Rio de Janeiro to Queenstown's gruesome gravel oval and the contrasting histories of Glasgow City Hall (inaugurated in 1888 by Queen Victoria) to Optus Stadium in Perth (opened in 2018 and frequented by Mitchell Johnson).\n\nThe London Olympic handball match between feisty neighbours Serbia and Croatia was criminally overlooked by mainstream media so was always going to get a guernsey in this book. It featured fierce-looking foes with intimidating names like Dragan, Darko and Dalibor who sound like characters created by Bram Stoker and certainly played with plenty of bite.\n\nMy undoubted favourite was Croatian Ivan Cupic who sported a mullet 30 years past its prime but looked so fearsome that nobody was game enough to tell him.\n\nMoments after completing the 2014 Blue Dragon mountain bike ride, Rob Shaw grabbed an interview with race winner Alex Hunt.\n\nThe MCG hosted several fond memories - from sharing AFL grand finals and a Tasmanian one-day cup triumph to introducing my seven-year-old son to his maiden experience of one of the planet's iconic sporting venues.\n\nTaking the daughter to see my beloved Brighton and Hove Albion defeat Manchester United was a similarly proud occasion, after which I told her not to go to another Seagulls game because it will never get better than that.\n\nTasmanian venues abound, from the grounds formerly known as Bellerive Oval and York Park to the Silverdome, Blue Derby, Lake Barrington and assorted national park locations from Wild Dog Creek in the Walls of Jerusalem to Alchemy Wall in Freycinet with the rock-climbing legend who named it, the late Bob McMahon.\n\nHad Bob not abseiled past and afforded me the opportunity to fess up that I was hopelessly stuck, I think I would still be on that ledge. I later wrote that he had an unfathomable belief in the potential of others combined with a calming voice which should be deployed to read good news forecasts to sailors in peril.\n\nOccasionally events united my two trans-global incarnations, such as watching Kevin Muscat play for Melbourne Victory in Launceston having last seen him representing Millwall against Brighton and seeing the Hobart Hurricanes walk out to Rock You Like a Hurricane 31 years after attending a concert in South London performed by the band that wrote it, the Scorpions.\n\nAFL chief executive Gillon McLachlan gets a grilling during a visit to Launceston in 2015.\n\nNot since Cradle Mountain pioneer Gustav Weindorfer and supermarket-tycoon-turned-Grindelwald-visionary Roelf Vos have the consequences of a central European's actions had such an impact in Tasmania. Apart from the whole Second World War thing obviously.\n\nAnd the sorely-missed Three Peaks Race was always going to appear again courtesy of an unforgettable experience and comment when I joined a crew sailing to Flinders.\n\nThe undoubted highlight was watching dolphins by moonlight in the middle of Banks Strait but equally memorable was The Wife's response when I told her the organisers had loaned me a few videos to give me some idea what I was in for.\n\n\"Is one of them The Perfect Storm?\" she asked.\n\nSHAW THINGS ($29.95, Forty South Publishing) is available from The Examiner's office at 113 Cimitiere Street, Launceston, and numerous outlets around Northern Tasmania.\n\nBook signings are being held at Racecourse Newsagency in Kmart Plaza on December 5, Legana News and Lotto on December 12 and Petrarch's bookshop on December 13.\n\nDAILY\n\nYour morning news\n\nToday's top stories curated by our news team.
