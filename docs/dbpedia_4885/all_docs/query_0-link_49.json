Are you well? Did you manage to avoid either crucifixion or the acquisition of chocolate-related type-2 diabetes? GREAT!\n\nI am in something of a hurry what with having to get to lunch and it being 1155am at the time of writing and my still being in my pants and needing to get something of a move on with the washing and the dressing and suchlike – so, er, this is all you’re getting by way of an intro. Sorry.\n\nI am still Matt, this is still Web Curios, and you and I both know that the opening few paragraphs are always the very worst of each week’s edition.\n\nBy Miloš Ilić\n\nWE KICK OFF THIS WEEK WITH AN OLD ALBUM RATHER THAN A NEW MIX, BUT I MAKE NO APOLOGIES BECAUSE THIS WILL ALWAYS FEEL LIKE SPRING IN MY MIND AND MAYBE IT WILL FOR YOU TOO!\n\nTHE SECTION WHICH IS GENUINELY SADDENED BY THE FACT THAT THE GUY LEAKING ALL THE STUFF IN THE US HAD THE RELATIVELY-BANAL ‘OG’ AS A USERNAME RATHER THAN SOMETHING PLEASINGLY-CHAOTIC LIKE, I DON’T KNOW, “WWE P1SSPIG” , PT.1:\n\nThe HTML Review: This week, as a special treat for having survived without links for a whole fortnight (I refuse to believe there are other sources of links, don’t lie to me) we kick off with something GENUINELY GREAT! This is the second edition of the HTML review, and once again it’s a collection of experiments in form – the letter from the editor frankly explains the ethos better than I ever could, so, er, here: “Our 2023 issue is made up of 17 contributions that span modes of digital literature and experiment. We have poetic instruments, interactive fictions, illustrated essays, movable lyrics, linguistic gardens, and pixelated memories. I like to think each piece we publish is a specific illumination of how literature can exist in digital spaces. They are each reflective of a World Wide Web built with fingerprints visible, inviting all to participate and take ownership.” These are SO SO LOVELY – fine, ok, so I have a bias here as I am a particular sucker for anything that combines code and narrative in interesting ways, but even if you’re less of a sucker for ‘art made of words’ than I am you will, I promise, find things to love here – from click-to-advance poetry that really makes you feel each mousepress to a perfectly-crafted homage to messageboard conversations on web1.0, to the weird but very very beautiful semi-organic landscape of the html gardens, this is all just beautiful and, quite often, really affecting (again, I have a particular emotional weakness for this sort of thing, but I promise that if even someone as basically dead inside as me can find something to love in here then you can too). Practically perfect in every way, I promise you, and if you’re finding everything a bit much this week then you could do worse than just stopping at this link and just hanging out a bit.\n\nCube Fashion: What shape is the fashion industry? No, come on, it’s a serious question – WHAT FCUKING SHAPE IS IT? Know that if you answered anything other than ‘it is a cube, Matt; fashion is a cube as any fule kno’ that you were WRONG – still, you can atone for your ignorance by exploring THE UNIVERSE OF FASHION THROUGH DATA, thanks to this project by Google and Vogue (which, shamefully, is actually from October last year and which I am hideously late to and which, as I type, is causing the sort of hot/cold embarrassed sweat flushes that I associate more with childhood sporting humiliation than I do newsletter-writing) which presents the ENTIRE ECOSYSTEM OF FASHION BRANDS as, er, a series of datapoints arrayed in a vaguely cubic fashion to demonstrate each of said brands’ relative performance against a variety of different criteria (geographical footprint, green initiatives and, er, ‘corporate communications’, to name but three), letting you see a UNIQUE DATA-DRIVEN CUBIC DESIGN for each of the stars in the great fashion galaxy. And it tells you…well, it tells you the square root of fcuk-all, turns out, given there’s no scale or explanation as to how you’re meant to read any of this stuff, or any depth to the data displayed (it’s just fancy graphing, at heart), but it looks pretty and that’s the main thing. A bit of digital work in the fashion space that looks pretty but is fundamentally empty and devoid of meaning? This stuff writes itself, I tell you.\n\nBohemian RhapsodAI: Leaving aside the horror of the name – you know what they’re doing with the wordplay, but just take a moment to pause here and say the title of this website out loud;it’s genuinely unpleasant to vocalise, for reasons I can’t quite articulate – this is partly a nice piece of eyecatching digital promo work by some Dutch agency, and partly…look, I don’t want to pretend that I am some sort of massive Queen or Freddie Mercury fan, or that I have particularly strong feelings about THE SANCTITY OF AN ARTIST’S MEMORY, but at the same time, er, this sounds HORRIBLE! Basically this is at heart the sort of ‘run a bunch of different isolated vocal tracks together based on user inputs, using maths to try and make it all sound vaguely-coherent’ you’ve seen before, but with an added layer of AI-wrangling so that you can get a choir of machine-imagined Freddies warbling together as they sing all the different parts of Bohemian Rhapsody – did they have to make it sound quite so much like it’s being sung tone-deaf people who hated his music, though? If you know, live with or work with any big fans of the band and their music, this will REALLY upset them.\n\nWelcome Home: THIS IS SO GOOD. Like an ARG but, as far as I can tell, without attempting to sell you anything or get you to do really, really hard maths, this is a web portal into a fan community for forgotten mid-20thC kids TV show ‘Welcome Home’, a puppet-lad show designed to educate and amuse small people in much the same way as Sesame Street. “Welcome Home was an American children’s television program created and produced by The Playfellow Workshop, which served as the studio’s only production. Supposedly its first episode aired on October 11th, 1969 and was broadcast onto an unknown channel until it’s last estimated air date sometime in 1974” – or at least that’s the ostensible explanation. There’s something…off about this, though, and the longer you look at the pages the more you realise that this has far more of the vibe of “Don’t Hug Me I’m Scared” than, say, Rosie & Jim, and that there’s something not quite right about some of the images, and that not all the links go where you expect them to go…I don’t want to spoil this too much, but I strongly advise you to spelunk and explore and click and keep your soul clutched tight in your chest as there is a LOT in here – also, I have just decided that ARGs are due a comeback so if you could all please start working on some that would be great thanks.\n\nInside The Great Pyramid: I feel a bit guilty saying this, but I’ve never been hugely interested in visiting the pyramids – I do wonder whether this is some sort of inbuilt Italian bias whereby my Roman ancestry means that whenever I look at any ancient architecture that isn’t the Palatine I can’t help but make the sort of dismissive hand and mouth gestures immortalised by generations worth of cinematic stereotypes – which is why I was so grateful for this new bit of Streetview-esque webwork on the Mused platform which lets you explore inside the (VERY CLAUSTROPHOBIC) corridors of the Great Pyramid at Giza and see what all those explorers were so keen to get their mitts on. This is genuinely fascinating (although also…quite aesthetically uniform, which I appreciate feels like something of a churlish complaint when one is using magical future technology to explore the thousand-year-old corridors of the immortal tomb of a child-god-king but, well, it is the future and we are entitled) without needing either to get your clothes dusty or worry about camelspit.\n\nThe Pear Ring: Everything old is new again! Now that everyone’s seemingly decided that dating apps are Not The One, people are once again casting about for new and exciting ways in which to monetise the fact that people, at heart, want to fcuk (yes, ok, fine, ‘find love’). So it is that we have The Pear Ring, a revolutionary product which, er, functions as a massive neon sign above your head reading “DTF!”. Obviously that’s not how the people peddling it would want to describe it – the ‘insight’ (lol) at the heart of this is that ‘76% of people are open to being chatted up in real life’ (LOL PERHAPS BUT NOT BY YOU), and that as such it makes perfect sense for all the single people in the world to all sign up to wearing the same article of jewellery so that they can identify each other in the otherwise-homogenous soup of coupled-up marrieds. WELL. There’s lots to enjoy about this idea – for a start, the thought that any woman in 2023 would want to go out in public wearing something that’s publicly-coded as ‘yes, please come and talk to me, stranger! I am open to your potentially-amorous advances!’ strikes me as…optimistic. Second, didn’t everyone try ‘traffic light’ parties in the mid-90s and decide they were a waste of time? Thirdly, as my friend Ged pointed out, this is going to get quite awkward for anyone who wears simple jade jewellery. My biggest objection to this, though, is how BORING it is – ‘wear a ring to show you’re single’ is basically the tedious, vanilla version of the old ‘wear a specifically-coloured hanky in your back pocket to show what you’re willing to do in bed’ from olden days San Francisco (and, if you replace the hankies with baguettes, Paris too, sexy history fans!), and it saddens me that the makers of this haven’t broadened the selection of rings available to encompass (for example), yellow rings for those who are open to impromptu toilet play. By the way, clicking on the website will present you with a banner suggesting that the rings are ‘93% sold out’ – the website was also saying this when I discovered it a week or so ago, suggesting either that sales have slowed somewhat or that the people behind it are lying. YOUR GUESS.\n\nMoonView: This is Google Earth but for the moon. Yes, I know, it’s not quite as immediately visually-appealing as the Earth, but I for one had always been curious as to what Olympus Mons actually looked like and now I can die happy (lol) so, well, ENJOY!\n\nJasper The Doll: I understand literally nothing about this – who is behind it, and why the account’s owner, who as far as I can tell is a 20something kid in the states, is spenmding what I imagine amounts to a not-insignificant portion of their lives making TikTok videos embodying the persona of Jasper, a croaky-voiced and raggedy-looking doll which features in small skits and which really shouldn’t be compelling but which sort-of is. Look, I know that that’s a genuinely horrible non-description, but watch this particular example of the Jasper canon and tell me it’s not ART (it is, I promise you, ART).\n\nTo Be: I adore this. To Be is a digital poem by Alicia Guo – it’s infinite and self-generating, and I don’t quite know how it works or where it’s pulling the words from, but each time it’s different and each time it’s fragmented and magical and silly and poignant and confusing and beautiful and I would like this to be read forever by a choir of machine voices until the heat death of the universe please thankyou.\n\nAutoGPT: I put it off as long as I could, I promise, but we’re quickly going to have to run through some AI stuff – I promise I will try and keep it as painless as possible, though, and we’ll be back to t he ephemera sooner than you can say “WE ARE ALL SO BORED OF AI THAT WE WOULD WELCOME DEATH AT THE HANDS OF OUR NEW MATHSY OVERLOARDS RATHER THAN READ ANOTHER FCUKING THING ABOUT GPT”. Anyway, after a frothy couple of weeks in which people have spent an awful lot of time talking about AI and What It Might Mean For Us without in any way spending time thinking about what, to my mind, is The Big Issue Here (to whit: “why are we building all these post-scarcity toys in an era in which scarcity is still very much a thing, and why are we not spending more time thinking about what this is going to do?”) here’s another piece of ammo for all the DOOMERS currently convinced that the LLMs are just a training cycle away from plotting our demise. AutoGPT is – let’s be clear – a very emergent thing right now, and it’s more theoretical than practical, but it’s…impressive in scope. The link here takes you to a Twitter thread talking about the principle and demonstrating how it functions in practice, but, simply put, “Auto-GPT is an open-source application showing the power of LLMs like GPT-4 to autonomously develop and manage different kinds of tasks like completing a code session or suggesting a business idea. You give an agent an identity, role/task, goals, and specifics about what to accomplish and it attempts to achieve it in an “autonomous” way through a framework designed to allow the model to “reason and act” to accomplish the task.”” So what this does is basically give a window into the not-too-distant future in which you will theoretically be able to ask your AI assistant to, for example, research your preferences based on a corpus of material and then, depending on its analysis of said corpus, go off and book you a holiday that you will like (checking your calendar for your availability, obvs). Is this good? It sounds convenient, of course, but then there are all the questions about the extent to which it’s a good idea to allow black boxes to behave with this degree of operational autonomy…BUT DON’T WORRY! As I said, this is (probably) MONTHS away from being reality! If you’d like a practical, hands-on way of exploring how this stuff might work, here’s a little toy that demonstrates the sorts of steps AutoGPT would go through to accomplish a broad task – oh, and of course someone has set this up with the goal to ‘Destroy Humanity’, so if you’re interested you can track the progress of ChaosGPT at this Twitter feed (at the time of writing it has decided to attempt to use Twitter to manipulate people to do its bidding, which will make you laugh darkly if you’ve ever tried to use Twitter to change anyone’s opinion about anything). Ought we be worried? NOT ABOUT THIS, BE WORRIED ABOUT THE JOBS AND THE MONEY FFS.\n\nMemecam: Can an AI come up with meme gags? No, basically, is the answer, but that doesn’t mean it’s not fun to watch it try. Open up the Memecam site on your phone, snap a photo of anything you fancy and watch as The Machine attempts to come up with HILARIOUS ‘I Can Haz Cheezburger’-type copy to accompany it – these aren’t, by any standard definition, ‘funny’, but there’s something interesting about watching the software skirting around the edges of humour, and occasionally it will spit out something halfway-amusing (it correctly identified the fat, ugly cat currently staring at me through the back window as a stray, for example – yes, I have fed it this morning, and NO FATSO you are not having any more ffs). Why not spend the rest of your day wandering around your office/home/neighbourhood turning everyone you know into a meme? Yes, ok, fine, it might not sound like a fulfilling way to spend your Friday afternoon, but it will fill some of those empty hours between birth and death and that’s the main thing.\n\nPoeBots: Poe is Quora’s attempt at an LLM – you all remembered this, right? You all hold this vital, crucial in your heads and hearts at all times? You don’t, do you? SO WHY MUST I BE COMPELLED TO REMEMBER THIS SH1T THEN? FFS! – and it’s now introduced quite a neat feature which elevates it a little more towards being a thing you might occasionally use rather than something you tried once and then forgot existed. Basically you can now use Poe to spin up themed chatbots with but a line or two pf prompt instruction; the gimmick here is that the bots will persist, and can be shared, and that it’s free. Which is potentially useful if you can be bothered to try and spin up a conversational assistant with a particular persona which you can persistently draw on – ok, yes, fine, you could do the same with a GPT prompt but you’d theoretically have to re-enter it every few tokens whereas this purports to last longer; it’s only playing with GPT3.5 and below-level tech, so don’t expect miracles, but this could be amusing/useful to play around with.\n\nSegment Anything: On the one hand, I am aware that there is a lot of REALLY technically-impressive stuff going on with this tech, Meta’s new image-recognition AI which lets you isolate literally any element from an image with a pretty-terrifying degree of precision (seriously, play with the examples – the fact that it can clip the stick from a dog’s mouth is quite remarkable); on the other, I find it quite hard to get excited for stuff that is ‘Photoshop but easier’. Your mileage, though, may vary significantly.\n\nPhotoPrompts: Ooh, this is a useful little tool – a prompt generator for images (as far as I can make out, specifically optimised for the latest version of Midjourney) which lets you select from a series of dropdowns to pick the name of the photographer whose style you’d like to rinse, the style of image you’re after, the aspect ratio and the lighting, along with the angle of shot and depth of field, and the site will create a usable prompt to start you off. Obviously this is…less good if you stop to think about the eventual endpoint for all of this, or indeed any of the thorny and still-largely-intractable questions around the extent to which a ‘style’ can be said to be ‘owned’ by an individual or otherwise, but if you don’t dwell too much and focus on the fact that it makes YOUR life marginally easier then, well, it’s all fine!\n\nTextPrompts: I’m including this not because I think it’s good or I endorse it, but because I am once again slightly amazed by the grift here – would YOU pay $25 for a Chrome extension that would help you create prompts for LLMs based on a series of questions? Maybe you would, I don’t know, but this strikes me as a quite astonishingly-hopeful punt at making some cash out of the boom in interest in AI. Although, according to the site, nearly 300 people have signed up and this person’s trousered $7k+ so, well, I’m the idiot here, aren’t I? FFS Matt, you are always the idiot.\n\nAI CafePress: Speaking of grift, I am genuinely agog at this platform which is LITERALLY cafepress for your terrible AI art – give it a prompt, wait a few seconds and then YOU TOO can create a generic storefront to sell your soulless, generic AI-generated imagery on poor-quality sweatshop-stitched tshirts and sweats! This is in-part funny, but also very much not funny at all when you consider the number of people currently working on selling exactly this vision to morons worldwide (there are 110% people currently selling “here’s how to create an AI-to-dropshipping pipeline for seamless passive income TODAY!” courses for $199.99 a pop), and take a moment to factor in the likely impact that this sort of stuff is probably going to have on the volumes of cheap, throwaway tat clogging up the planet in the years to come.\n\nInfinite Adversaries: A fun project by Curios reader Felix Jung (THANKS FELIX!), who’s created a light ‘choose your own adventure’-style narrative game experience thing using GPT. Felix writes: “On entering the site, visitors are offered a choice of weapon (a different set of options every time). From there, ChatGPT then creates a random adversary and location, along with a set of four possible actions you can take. Some actions involve the weapon you chose. Some actions involve your physical surroundings. Depending on what you choose to do, ChatGPT then narrates the outcome. If you survive, your prize is another adversary. This was a lot of fun to work on, and I found myself pretty awed at the types of responses ChatGPT came up with (I provide some randomized guidance, but the options and outcomes are all from ChatGPT). Each encounter is also illustrated by an image from DALL-E.” This is fun-but-simple – it won’t keep you hooked for long, but it’s interesting to see what the software generates and it’s clear what the potential is from the point of view of emergent storytelling.\n\nThe Fantasy Internet Simulator: I LOVE THIS WHAT A WONDERFUL IDEA! Imagine browsing the internet from a half-imagined past, where the aesthetic and vibes sort-of fit but where everything’s not quite as you remember it…Nate Parrott is attempting to create exactly that with his Fantasy internet Simulator, which, in his words, works like this: “it works like any other browser: type a URL or a search query, and it loads a page! but in this case, the page isn’t coming from the internet. it’s coming from chatGPT. and i’ve asked chatGPT to pretend it’s still 1996.” You need to be able to install and run this yourself using Tesflight on iOS, but if you can then I promise you it is SO MUCH FUN and such a wonderful exercise in collaborative imagination and storytelling – wandering through a hallucinatory memory of a web that never was feels like the perfect application for this feverish generation of language manglers.\n\nBy Mark Steinmetz\n\nWE CONTINUE THE THROWBACKS WITH THE EXCELLENT ‘THIS IS MY DEMO’ BY SWAY FROM 2007! SIMPLER TIMES!\n\nTHE SECTION WHICH IS GENUINELY SADDENED BY THE FACT THAT THE GUY LEAKING ALL THE STUFF IN THE US HAD THE RELATIVELY-BANAL ‘OG’ AS A USERNAME RATHER THAN SOMETHING PLEASINGLY-CHAOTIC LIKE, I DON’T KNOW, “WWE P1SSPIG” , PT.2:\n\nQI Meditations: Do you meditate? Does it…does it help? Does it stop the voices? Crucially, does it do a better job of at least keeping them a bit quiet than drugs and booze do? Maybe I should give it a go – and maybe I should use QI meditations to do so (I probably shouldn’t, though)! QI Meditations combines text-generating AI with text-to-voice synthesis to present you with a selection of guided meditations penned by machine; “Defying the norms of traditional mindfulness, Qi offers a series of randomly generated meditation exercises. These peculiar and amusing prompts urge users to embrace the absurdity of the content, promoting the idea that meditation can take many forms. As a commentary on society’s increasing dependency on technology and the prevalence of AI-generated content, Qi challenges users to scrutinize the boundaries of AI and its impact on human experiences. By presenting AI-generated art in such an eccentric manner, Qi compels users to face the unpredictable nature of AI and consider its potential consequences on art and culture.” Honestly, these are actually quite funny – there’s a featured one today in the style of Trump and whilst there’s nothing I find funny or interesting about That Fcuking Man anymore I confess to being charmed enough to listen to the whole, ridiculous thing.\n\nTravel Photographer of the Year: BRAND NEW AWARD-WINNING PHOTOS! These are, as you would expect, superb – there’s a UK winner too, in the shape of the Young Travel Photographer of the Year Cal Cole from Manchester, but my personal ‘favourites’ (I use the term advisedly) are the images of the little kids boxing about halfway down because, well, just look at them.\n\nCookNovels: I really like this idea, and it feels very much like something that half a dozen of you could reasonably steal for your ‘6/10-rated concepts that we can keep to lob in any presentation that’s looking a bit thin on the creative front’ folder. CookNovels riffs on the running gag about online recipe sites requiring you to read War & Peace before you get to the ingredients list – except here the joke is that you really DO get a whole (out of copyright) novel before each recipe. There are only three, but you can get your recipe for simple Chile Con Carne served with a sider order of Homer, say, or pair Moby Dick with a low-carb prawn cocktail – I refuse to believe that there’s not a million ways you can ‘borrow’ this and frankly improve it for the right brand but, equally, I am too lazy to bother to try and think of any so who the fcuk knows?\n\nPrankGPT: This, though, I feel honour-bound to point out, is A BAD IDEA and Web Curios in no way endorses it. Do YOU think that it sounds like a sensible or liability-free idea to hook up an LLM, a text-to-voice engine and an web-to-phone calling protocol to spin up a system whereby you can call in an AI-generated ‘prank call’ about any subject you cabn imagine to anyone in the world whose phone number you know? IT IS NOT! It is, honestly, a very bad one! Yes, ok, fine, I know that the setup here is almost certainly made my a couple of bored highschool kids and is therefore is janky as fcuk (and in fairness I wasn’t quite able to get it to work this morning), and I am also aware that it’s probably not possible to make the bot generate anything awful because of guardrails and limited guiding inputs…but, also, I don’t think this FEELS like something that bodes well. Still, file this one away for June when you’re sitting around brainstorming Hallowe’en ideas.\n\nEuroVelo: Whilst obviously I have no idea of the identities of anyone reading this, I’ve got a vague idea that the readership for Web Curios tends towards ‘middle-aged urban-dwelling men who probably work in a media-related industry’, which, from what I can tell, is a pretty much 1:1 Venn diagram match with ‘people who make cycling and the fact that they like it a core and frankly insufferable part of their identity’ (sorry, but I have lost friends to the two wheels and lycra disease and I am BITTER about it) – as such, I imagine that there are a few of you for whom this website, which lets you plan cycling trips around Europe (thankfully that’s geographical rather than political Europe, meaning even the great act of national self-harm that was Brexit hasn’t managed to spoil it for the Brits just yet), will be of not-insignificant appeal. Although on reflection ifyou like cycling that much then you probably new about it already. FFS.\n\nApril Fool’s On The Web: Yes, I know, there is very little in the world less funny than the lies that brands tell you on April 1st (apart, of course, from the ones they tell you on the other 364 days of the year! “Sustainability!” lol!), but at the same time you might find it helpful to have a searchable database of every single one of the (to repeat, DESPERATELY UNFUNNY) corporate gags committed to HTML each year since 1994, if only so you can use it to resurrect every single one of these with the addition of “…but with AI!”.\n\nColouring The Past: A photography series by Eri Erlick which serves not only as an colourised archive of great shots but as useful reminder that trans people have been a thing throughout recorded history, all over the world, and recent attempts to portray the concept of transgenderism or gender fluidity as some sort of uniquely-modern aberration born of post-web decadence is, frankly, stupid and wrong and ahistorical. “Using recent breakthroughs in photo editing techniques, Eli colorizes, restores, and digitizes photos from queer and trans history. The following images are originally from 1897-1973.After noticing how much more responsive audiences are to color photos, Eli decided to share these amazing moments from queer and trans history. During a time when politicians can openly argue trans people did not exist until 2015, it is important to use reminders like these that we have always been here.” It’s honestly astonishing and not a little miserable to note the degree to which the tenor of the conversation around gender has in many respects worsened rather than improved over the course of the past 50 years.\n\nHigh Rises: Gorgeous photos of very tall American buildings. “The prosperity of early 20th century America resulted in a boom of skyscrapers that still tower over cities across the country today. Focusing on the character and craftsmanship on display at the top of these landmark buildings in a way that can’t be seen from street level, the Highrises Collection reveals fascinating details and stories of these distinctly American icons.A drone-mounted camera takes multiple high-res photos of the top of each Highrise. Images are stitched together manually to create a elevation scan with flattened perspective and enhanced lighting effects to accentuate depth and form.” The way in which these images are created lends them a slightly-odd flattened quality (I am fluctuating between describing them as ‘videogamey’ and ‘Wes Anderson-y’, but given I hate Wes Anderson let’s go with the former), but that’s part of the appeal here imho.\n\nReliable Robotics: To be clear, this links to the website of a robotics company – it may be a super-exciting robotics company, but it is very much a corporate website rather than a FUN DISTRACTION FROM MEATY HORROR. EXCEPT! The scroll animation features a genuinely-delightful graphical render of a plane, and features the near-perfect legend ‘scroll to activate take-off’, and I can’t tell you quite how much this apparently-unnecessary piece of graphical overengineering pleases me (and I hope it pleases you too). FLY, POINTLESS LITTLE CG PLANE!\n\nShed Of The Year: Many years ago, when this first launched and I was working for a company who did the PR for Amazon (yes, but those were simpler times when they were less evil, I promise) we launched an ill-feted attempt to get the ecommerce behemoth to sponsor this (look, they had just launched their gardenware vertical, it made sense at the time) – the fact that they basically laughed and rejected the concept out of hand is up there in the pantheon of my greatest career disappointments (other examples: not getting the job at The Sun when I was 20, the fact that I ever worked in PR in the first place), but I like to think that the company’s current reputational travails might have been somewhat eased had it been they rather than Cuprinol who badged the UK’s annual Shed of the Year contest. Anyway, click the link, marvel at the sheds and, if you’re a middle-aged man, feel quietly jealous of ‘The Fortress of Solitude’ (and all the rest tbf).\n\nSoren’s Clever Design Gags: You’ve probably seen some bits of design sature doing the rounds online over the past few weeks – apps whose interfaces have been alterered slightly to make a point about how TERRIBLE they are, like LinkedIn adding an ‘opentowork’ button to acknowledge the fact that the only reason anyone engages with that horrible, soulless colosseum of misery is to climb another rung up the slick, viscera-greased pole of corporate success. Almost all of them will have been by this person, Soren (no surname supplied), who collects examples of his work on this website (you can sign up to get a new gag via email each day should you be so inclined).\n\nThe Shapes of Stories: Ok, now this is an interesting use of AI. One of the most-helpful ways of thinking about LLMs (and indeed the current crop of ‘AI’ tools) is less in terms of ‘this thing generates words’ or ‘this thing generates images’ and more in terms of ‘these tools let us develop links between different disparate things in ways that have never been attempted before’ – which is exactly what this experiment is doing. Taking a bunch of classic stories, the person behind the project (Superb Owl, whoever they may be) asked GPT to ascribe a numerical value to the emotional state of each character at various points in the story, which can then be graphed to create a visualisation of the emotional journey experienced by protagonists throughout the novel in question – which is both interesting from the point of view of narrative construction and the Vonneguttian idea of ‘story shapes’, and also from the perspective of ‘how The Machine can effectively do some really interesting quant/qual-mixing stuff’. The idea of taking this sort of approach and then adding an instruction to ‘and now translate this graphical representation of a story arc into a symphonic composition for bassoon’ really rather appeals to me – I am basically waiting for someone to create an entire, machine-imagined operetta based on the emotional beats of the entirety of Crossroads, so if any of you fancy knocking that out that would be great, thanks.\n\nTape Cassette Inserts: Who wouldn’t want a Flickr page which exists solely to catalogue all the different graphic design styles that were applied to the bits of paper and cardboard that you used to inexplicably get inside blank cassette tapes when you bought them? NO FCUKER, etc! Leaving aside anything else, I reckon you could probably make a reasonable line in passive income (sorry! sorry!) from setting up a company selling 80s-esque bedsheets in these sorts of colourways to the recently-divorced.\n\nMouseTok: This is the TikTok account of one Martin Critchlow, whose feed consists exclusively of videos of his collection of fieldmice just sort of hanging about. In particular, Martin seems to focus on one particular mouse he has named ‘Mr Jingles’ – tragically, Mr Jingles recently lost his partner (“Mrs Jingles”, should you be curious), but both Martin and the mouse appear to be managing ok in her absence (although I challenge you to watch the tribute to Mrs Jingles on the feed and not tear up a bit). I am going to assume that this is entirely pure and sincere, and as such I wish nothing but the best to Martin, Mr Jingles and the rest of his nameless troupe of rodents.\n\nFrog App: OH GOD NO MORE SOCIAL APPS EVER PLEASE GOD. Still, if YOU are in the market for a BRAND NEW video-first social app, but this time one that’s focused on FRIENDS and CREATIVITY (now where have you heard that before? Oh, yes, that’s right, everyfcukingwhere!) then you might be in the market to check out Frog, made by former LSE students and which aimed SO far outside my demographic that I can barely make sense of the website. You post ‘Sups’ apparently (yes, that sound you can hear is my jaw clicking in barely-concealed irritation), and there’s a nice gimmick in that anyone can continue any of their friends’ stories by creating ‘sequels’ which effectively follow on from the original content and which feels like a nice tool for all sorts of creative endeavours but, honestly, everyone featured on this website looks so young and fresh and full of life that it mostly made me want to just lie down and bleed into the floor until it all fades to white and mercifully just stops.\n\nPermanent Beta: DON’T THINK JUST CLICK! Oh, ok, maybe think a *bit*, but generally I found this website was at its best when just approached with a sense of curious and open-minded wonder. If you have any professional interest in / intersection with the arts and digital then I think you will very much like this – or, at the very least, find it a though-0provoking exercise in digital practice/praxis (sorry). “[permanent beta] is an online platform that visualises the ongoing research of Fotomuseum Winterthur in the field of algorithmic and networked image cultures. As a platform meant to remain in a state of perpetual change, it tracks the research process, turning it into a creative and performative act in which knowledge around a specific thematic focus is collectively collected, (re-)arranged, edited and streamlined over time.” This will, I guarantee, only make marginally more sense when you click through, but I am fairly-certain you will like it.\n\nPrisonGames: This is so interesting – Marcos Paz runs programmes in Argentine jails helping to teach inmates useful skills to help them gain employment in the games-and-games-adjacent industries after release, but also as a means of helping them express themselves through creative storytelling and ludic mechanics. This site collects some of the work that the people he’s taught have produced, seemingly all pieces of interactive fiction using Twine or similar – it’s in Spanish, as you’d expect, so you’ll need a bit of language, but these are poignant and, honestly, in parts heartbreaking short works of semi-autobiography.\n\nWord Solitaire: This is a good game, but it is SO HARD that it has made me feel really quite thick and I am, to be honest, mainly sharing it with you all so that you can all feel stupid too.\n\nLegend of the Red Dragon: The final miscellaneous link of the week is a proper throwback – remember BBSs? Oh, fcuk, you may not – erm, bulletin boards! Does that help? Erm, no, ok…just think of them as old, slow forums, basically, or, alternatively, just go away and Google all this and then come back when you’ve done your homework. Done? GREAT! Anyway, this is a wonderful and painstaking recreation of oldschool multiplayer RPG Red Dragon, whose Wikipedia entry describes it as follows: “The premise of LORD is that a red dragon is wreaking havoc in a town where the player has recently arrived. Multiple players compete over a period of weeks to advance their skills and to kill the dragon. In order to achieve this goal, players must face combat to gain experience. Once they have gained enough experience, they must face their master at Turgon’s Warrior Training and advance in skill level. Advancement increases the players fighting stats and gives an additional skill point in the current skill (up to 40). Advancement also presents stronger enemies and masters; a player must challenge and defeat master Turgon himself to reach level 12, the final level, before attempting to search for and slay the dragon.” Enter text commands! Meet other players! ENTER THE METAVERSE AS IT WAS IN 1984!!!!! Lol that is funny satire because aside from the bells and whistles that is basically what this is. A time capsule, a bit of history and a weird illustration of the whole general ‘plus ca change, plus reste la meme chose’ vibe of modernity right now.\n\nBy Claire Morgan\n\nLET’S CLOSE OUT THE MUSIC THIS WEEK WITH THIS SELECTION OF FUNK AND DISCO AND ASSOCIATED OTHER BEATS AND PIECES, COLLATED BY MIDNIGHT MAGIC!\n\nTHE CIRCUS OF TUMBLRS!\n\nFanzine Haemmorhage: Ok, fine, not *technically* a Tumblr but it’s a fabulously-named website and it feels like a Tumblr and, as per, MY SITE MY TAXONOMY FFS. Anyway, if you want a place where you can find a truly marvellous selection of old scans of fanzines alongside writings about the bands and scenes they describe, this will be PERFECT for you: “Fanzine Hemorrhage explores sub-underground music fanzines from the 1960s to the present, and attempts to explore the worlds they defined and in some cases created.” This is WONDERFUL (and reminded me that a few weeks ago I did a guided walk by Paul Talling (who runs this website and whose stuff I recommend unreservedly) which basically descended into him sharing increasingly snakebite-tinged reminiscences about “that time I put on Big Tomato Dave at Filthy McNasty’s” (that is basically a verbatim quote) and which is pretty much the same vibe as this site, all told).\n\nFalse Knees: An ACTUAL TUMBLR! Also, I have for years seen images from here across the web and never known the source – if you’ve ever seen cartoons featuring beautifully-drawn and hyper-literate birds chatting about the travails of modern life then you may well recognise the work here.\n\nTHE TROUGH OF (INSTA) FEEDS!\n\nSiegfried Und Joy: Yes, ok, fine, they ARE magicians, but they are FUN magicians! The subway exit magic will honestly NEVER get old to me.\n\nRob Strati: Smashed plates and surprisingly-good artworks.\n\nRupublicans: Republican grandees, reimagined by Midjourney as drag queen versions of themselves for SATIRICAL PURPOSES. On the one hand, a pretty lazy, one-note gag – on the other, some of these images are GREAT.\n\nProject JDM: Combining maths, animation and music, this is so so so smart and so well made – I am slightly in awe. Thanks to whoever it was who sent this to me this week, whose identity I have totally failed to recall.\n\nThe Tube Map: Do you love the London Underground map? Would you like more of it on your Insta? GOOD WELL HERE IT IS THEN. Beautifully, this doesn’t appear to be affiliated with TFL in any way, which means that this is just someone who really loves the tube map a LOT. Thankyou, anonymous tube map fan!\n\nLONG THINGS WHICH ARE LONG!\n\nIan Hogarth on AI: Per an earlier comment, I KNOW YOU ARE ALL BORED OF AI I KNOW YOU ARE. Still, for the few remaining of you who can stomach another few thousand words on WHAT THIS ALL MEANS FOR US and WHERE IT IS GOING and ALL THE REASONS TO BE SCARED, this is a very good read by Ian Hogarth in the FT, which does a decent job of straddling the divide between ‘WE NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED OF THE ALL-KNOWING AUTONOMOUS MACHINE OVERLORDS WE MAY ONE DAY BIRTH!” and “WE NEED TO BE FRIGHTENED OF ALL THE WAYS IN WHICH THE HALF-FORMED VERSIONS OF AI WE HAVE ALREADY BIRTHED ARE MESSING WITH SYSTEMS WE ARE ALREADY ONLY BARELY-CAPABLE OF UNDERSTANDING DUE TO THEIR MASSIVE COMPLEXITY!” – the upshot here is that Hogarth is…a bit frit, but in a reasonably-coherent and non-hysterical way, and after reading this maybe you will be too.\n\nThe Data Delusion: I thought this piece in the New Yorker was an excellent companion to the latest ‘wow, a lot of you really enjoyed this, didn’t you?’ article to do the rounds of the strategyandplanningsphere – the ‘Age of Average’ piece by Alex Murrell was shared by seemingly everyone in advermarketingpr circles with ‘strategy’ in their jobspec as a way of proving…well, whatever they wanted to prove, from what I can tell, but mainly that we need to be BOLDER and RISKIER because focusing on the middle of the bellcurve leads to work that’s homogenous and dull and uninspiring… Anyway, the New Yorker piece to which this is ACTUALLY a link to looks at a potential problem of the emergence of predictive AI models based on large corpuses of data – to whit, the likelihood that they will result in a clumping of output towards averages and predicted centres, exactly the sort of thing that Murrell was railing against. You know what the problem is? The problem is fcuking DATA and our fetishisation of it – but you’re not allowed to say that, seemingly, despite the fact that (and I firmly believe this) that (for example) making decisions based on a bunch of data scraped from Twitter is nearly-always going to produce work that is worse and less interesting and more stupid than just sitting and thinking for a bit.\n\nGPT Is Getting Worse: Or, more accurately, OpenAI is getting better at locking it behind bars. This piece by Frank Lantz explores how in his experiments with the OpenAI stable of LLMs the software has become progressively less ‘imaginative’ with each update, and more fixed into a slightly-bland positivity in its responses. I can only echo this – Shardcore has kindly spent a bit of time seeing about introducing GPT to the Curios archive to see what happens, and it’s interesting to see that it is near-impossible to break the base model from its emptily-bromidic ‘Eddie from the Heart of Gold’ tone of voice and writing style, however much of my appallingly-convoluted prose you force down the machine’s digital gullet. The upshot, basically, is that I’m sadly stuck writing this for the foreseeable as I don’t seem to be able to outsource it to The Machine yet.\n\nMaking One Of Those AI Balenciaga Vids: Vox gives you a step-by-step guide on how to create you very own variant on the recent spate of ‘what if [INSERT FILM FRANCHISE X] directed by [INSERT VISUALLY STRIKING DIRECTOR Y] as a Balenciaga ad?’ vids – it’s both easier and slightly-harder than you might think, and the results look significantly less polished than the hugely-viral one’s you’ll have already seen on Insta/Twitter/TikTok…but they don’t look that bad, and given that teenagers have for the past two decades proved beyond any shadow of a doubt that they will consume any old crap under the guise of fanfic I think we can probably all agree that someone’s going to create a movie-length version of one of these by the end of the year (my money’s on a Potter-inspired story with a pro-trans twist, just for maximum culture war relevance) and it will comfortably do 10million+ views.\n\nThe AI Village: In many respects this is the most remarkable story of the week, I think. The link here takes you to an actual academic paper, but I promise you that it is properly readable and interesting, and if you have any interest in games or theatre or TV or general storytelling then you owe it to yourself to at least give this a go. The precis is basically that a bunch of researchers created a selection of ‘autonomous’ AI agents existing with a videogamelike closed sandbox (think a Stardew Valley-type gameworld), and then just…watched them. Each of the ‘agents’ in the simulation has its own wants and impeti, and these motivate them to act in specific ways, and the intersections of these interactions create emergent narratives…”Generative agents draw a wide variety of inferences about themselves, other agents, and their environment; they create daily plans that reflect their characteristics and experiences, act out those plans, react, and re-plan when appropriate; they respond when the end user changes their environment or commands them in natural language. For instance, generative agents turn off the stove when they see that their breakfast is burning, wait outside the bathroom if it is occupied, and stop to chat when they meet another agent they want to talk to. A society full of generative agents is marked by emergent social dynamics where new relationships are formed, information diffuses, and coordination arises across agents.” Anyone who’s been reading this for a while (and, er, who’s also been paying any attention to what I say, which I appreciate is probably not many of you) knows that I have long been obsessed with the idea of creating a modern version of Little Computer People using this sort of kit – this feels like an incredible well of potential just waiting to be tapped, and if you’ve spent any time marvelling at the sort of mad emergent storytelling gems that games like Dwarf Fortress or Skyrim throw up then this will tickle your interest significantly (oh, and if you’re curious, you can watch the how the experiment played out via this playback system).\n\nSubstack Hasn’t Thought About Content Moderation: Do you remember a couple of years ago when Substack was getting big and splashing the cash, and people started asking questions about the company’s policy on what it would and wouldn’t allow people to write about, and the company basically revealed itself to have not really given any proper consideration to issues of content moderation and responsibility? Do you imagine that in the intervening time between then and their announcement of the Twitter-like ‘Notes’ functionality on the platform this week someone senior at the company might have spent some time thinking about what they would do if they were in charge of a realtime short messaging network? Do you think they might also have briefed the CEO on lines to take on this thorny-but-incredibly-predictable line of questioning in their first media interview post the Notes announcement? OF COURSE NOT! This is a transcript of the interview between The Verge and Substack CEO Chris Best, and it really is worth reading the whole thing – if you’ve ever worked in comms, there will come a point about ⅓ of the way through where you start to see where this is going, and then a point about ⅔ of the way down the page where you will, if you’re anything like me, be literally be reading through your fingers while feeling genuinely sorry for the person whose job it is going to be managing the fallout of all this. Note to all CEOs – if someone asks you straight out whether it is ok for someone to use the thing you have made to be massively racist, THE RIGHT ANSWER IS ‘NO’.\n\nPosters: I tend not to include much stuff on THE CRAFT OF ADVERMARKETINGPR in here, mainly because it bores me to tears and I tend to find that 99% of it is pointless, overwritten w4nk designed to add an air of profundity to a series of disciplines which really don’t warrant any such thing, but I will make an exception for this piece which extols the virtues of good copy on posters and, more importantly, gives you not only some excellent examples of said GOOD COPY but also some gentle, non-patronising explanations as to why said copy is good. This is a really good post by someone called Dave Dye – thanks, Dave Dye.\n\nThat’s My Tank On Fire: A typica;ly-superb piece by James Meek in the LRB, detailing his experience of watching the social media war play out on Telegram and elsewhere, and what it feels like when your experience and knowledge of a conflict is experienced entirely through visual memetic propaganda. So so so interesting, and will be particularly so to anyone who remembers the first Gulf War welll enough to also remember the Baudrillardian discussion around its status as ‘hyperreality’ and the role of the media in the constructed reality of the conflict. It’s also a great piece because it gives an impression of the increasing impossibility of achieving anything more than an intensely-impressionistic and altered view of events like this – any events? – from hereon in, which is only going to become more pronounced with every day that passes.\n\nInterview With The Mercenary: This is quite a remarkable interview with quite a remarkable man (I use the word ‘remarkable’ in its literal, value-neautral sense here) – Simon Mann is…what is he? A relic of an England that doesn’t exist any more? A ‘soldier of fortune’? An old colonialist? Whatever you might call him, don’t call him a ‘mercenary’ – he doesn’t seem to like the term, and it struck me throughout this piece that Simon Mann is not someone you probably want to upset very much. If you’ve ever wondered what the life of an Eton-and-Sandhurst-educated former SAS officer who has attempted a coup in Equatorial Guinea, who worked with Mark Thatcher, who’s spent time in some…tasty-sounding jails and who appears to be entirely at peace with all this then, well, this will be right up your street. Equally, if you want to be rendered speechless with rage about the blithe attitude towards the lives and countries of others evidenced by this modern-day Haggard (this is how I imagine Mann would like to see himself, at least) then, well, this will also do the trick! Something for everyone!\n\nCruise Ship Invasion: I can’t help noticing that the latest ORGANISED FUN CONCEPT that Big Business is currently trying to flog to millennials and GenZs is cruises – you too will have seen the ads for Virgin’s nascent cruise ship business, promising SEXY YOUNG PEOPLE and NO CHILDREN – which made this piece, looking at the environmental impact of the cruise ship industry which tours Alaska from Seattle every year, feel partciularly timely. The short precis of this is ‘lol, you thought that this was OK for the planet? You rube! You absolute groundling! You know nothing!’, but the details are quite startling and the scrollytelling (sorry, but until someone comes up with a better word then that’s what we’re using) is pleasingly-done.\n\nBeing Colourblind Online: Friend of Curios Andy Baio (HI ANDY!) writes for The Verge about what it’s like for him using the web while colourblind – this is not only a really interesting piece, with some helpful graphics that show you exactly what a crappy experience navigating the vast majority of the web is for people with even minor visual impairments, but a useful reminder that accessible design is important and more necessary than we often imagine. It’s part of a wider series of articles all about the business of UI and the impact it has (and has had) on the way we use the web – “we explore the small design decisions that have had an outsize impact on our lives. From simple card game browser UIs to deliberately complicated video game setups, all-too-forgotten accessibility options for colorblindness to the curious incentive-driven histories of the shuffle and log out buttons, these stories delve into the ways that user interfaces have driven us forward, or failed, or found an entirely new way of living” – which is full of interesting pieces, whether or not you’re involved in the business of design (although, honestly, I think everyone is basically a BIT of a UI person these days, or ought to be).\n\nDon’t Monetise Your Kids: Or, “hang on – given the fact that we’ve all decided, rightly, that sending kids to work in factories is not ok, why are we seemingly totally fine with their parents exploiting their image and occasionally their labour for the big big influencer bucks?” To which the answer is ‘we’re not are we?’, or at least I’d sort of hoped it was – still, if you’ve ever wanted to read an exhaustive piece about why it’s perhaps no ok to force your three year old to do sixteen takes of her eating breakfast until it looks appropriately ‘cute’ then FILL YOUR BOOTS!\n\nNonsensical Advertising Futures: This is genuinely a bit miserable and dystopian and chilling, but, also, depressingly smart. Commuters in New York City have reported seeing confusingly-nonsensical video ads on their subway digital billboards, featuring the sort of content you’d expect more from chef/magicians on Facebook making some sort of artery-destroying ‘here’s a block of cheese wrapped in 19lbs of ground steak!’ monstrosity. Curious as to why, this article investigates and discovers that it’s a basic attention hack to grab passers-by’s attention for a fraction of a second – turns out that this sort of ‘WTF’ish video really does make you look, and therefore makes people marginally more receptive to whatever REAL ad comes on next. This is 100% going to become a thing, isn’t it?\n\nClitoral Enlargement Surgery: Because I’ve featured a few posts here about weird trends in masculine body enhancement over the past few months and felt the need to even things up a bit. Is this a trend? I…I doubt it. Still, if you’ve ever wanted to read a deep-dive into the (largely dubious-sounding, if I’m honest) benefits of having one’s clitoris enlarged then this will, er, hit the spot – even if you’re not interested in the full article, can I please ask that you click through and scroll down til you find the photos of the person doing this surgery who looks EXACTLY as you would imagine a West Coast plastic surgeon specialising in clitoral enhancement treatments would look.\n\nReal Life Dates With Imaginary Boys: I generally try and stay away from stories that are basically ‘lol Japan you so funny!’, not least because it feels a bit lazy and twodimensional (Web Curios? Lazy? Two-dimensional? HOW DARE YOU, etc), but on this occasion I will make an exception because, well, SO MUCH OF THIS IS MAD. I have no idea if this is an actual ‘trend’ or just something that a couple of people have done but which is going to be dressed up as a ‘thing’ regardles of its niche status, but let’s hope it’s the latter. The article describes how young Japanese are paying cosplayers to go on ‘dates’ with them in character as their favourite heroes from ganes or anime – so, rather than going to the trouble of interacting with a real person you can instead have an afternoon with someone who you are paying to assume the persona of a fictitious individual from a game or cartoon. Is…is that good? It doesn’t *feel* good. Still, the whole thing is agreeably mad-sounding, rendered all the moreso by the photos that pepper the piece in which everyone looks like a terrifying anime character because that is what phones make LITERALLY EVERYONE look like in Japan as far as I can tell.\n\nMeet Dril: His first out-of-character interview and my overriding impression was…sadness, honesty. I can very much relate to the idea of being stuck inside a persona/system/process that is simultaneously a comforting snug and a terrifying prison, and of the horror of ‘being a webmong at 50+’ (for ‘webmong’ substitute ‘poster’, or other content-appropriate epithet of choice), but I think the thing that touched me most was the description of him attempting to make his ‘thing’ the right shape to fit other media and realising that actually it probably doesn’t really work anywhere else other than Twitter – there’s a proper, real outsider artist vibe to this which I find poignant in the extreme (oh, and it’s also worth taking note of the Patreon figure he’s drawing down – tHe CrEaToR eCoNoMy lol!).\n\nLong Sentences Rule: This is, I think, the second essay in the space of a year to plough this particular furrow, and it;s proof positive (to my mind, at least) that the tyranny of Carver is FINALLY COMING TO AN END (I like Raymond Carver a lot, don’t get me wrong – or at least the version of him created by his editor – but I also find the idea that a sentence must not be longer than 10 words or so on punishment of death to be, well, fcuking stupid), and it’s a wonderful celebration of prose that is sinuous, serpentine, rich and lustrous and which is unashamed of its clauses and subclauses and parenthetical diversions. It should come as no surprise to anyone who’s read Web Curios that I am a firm believer in the long sentence – I am, however, self aware enough to admit that that is because I am a lazy and flabby writer of prose rather than because I have a unique and masterful style that deserves room to breathe (SO PLEASE DON’T FEEL THE NEED TO TELL ME).\n\nBlurred Lines: Because I am not a music radio person, and because I don’t drive and so don’t often get exposed to commercial stations, I was perhaps the last person in the UK to hear Blurred Lines when it was big 10 years ago – I can’t have been the only person, though, who on first hearing it thought ‘man, this is going to get old REALLY QUICKLY’ and also ‘wow, this really is…very, very r4pey, isn’t it?’ (an aside – am I the only person who thought the lyrics to ‘Get Lucky’ were basically all about trying to stay awake long enough that the girl you are with gets drunk or tired enough to just give in and sleep with you?, and that Daft Punk rather got away with one there? No? Ok, fair enough). This is a great Pitchfork piece looking back at the song, the Summer that it characterised, the Robin Thicke ‘phenomenon’, and that odd period when Miley Cyrus was everywhere and American pop culture got really weird about race (again).\n\nSuicidal Moments: NB – THIS PIECE IS ALL ABOUT WANTING TO KILL YOURSELF AND OCCASIONALLY TRYING BUT NOT QUITE MANAGING IT. So, er, caveat lector and all that jazz. Still, if that doesn’t put you off then I think this is a very good, very clear-eyed piece of writing about what it feels like when you want to kill yourself and how to maybe deal with said feeling when it occurs.\n\nOut To Lunch: An immensely-enjoyable piece of writing, again from the LRB, by Paul Theroux, which simultaneously tells the general story of The Literary Lunch in swinging/seedy (delete per your perception) London of the 1970s and the very specific story of how he tried and failed to have an affair with an artist called Molly. Superbly-observed, unsentimental and perfectly-written, this is all the better for being pleasingly-honest about the author’s intentions and what a sh1t he was being – and, of course, for being about lunch and the eating thereof.\n\nJohn Wick is So Tired: Finally this week, a poem about John Wick – I have never seen any of the films, but I don’t really think that matters. This is called John Wick Is So Tired and, honestly, I think this is beautiful and near-perfect, and I think you might too.\n\nBy Brecht Van Den Broucke\n\nAND NOW, MOVING PICTURES AND SOUNDS!:\n\nWebcurios 31/03/23\n\nReading Time: 34 minutes\n\nIt’s Friday, it’s lunchtime, it’s practically the holidays and I just bought Arab Strap tickets – ALL IS RIGHT WITH THE WORLD!\n\nIt’s not, of course – everything’s a benighted mess and liable to get worse before it gets better or, more accurately, we all die! – but let’s pretend otherwise as we, the Web Curios family (incestuous, dysfunctional, sickly, genetically compromised), come together for a rare moment of collective joy and hope.\n\n*PAUSES*\n\nWasn’t that nice? Eh? Oh.\n\nStill, like I care – this is the last Web Curios before the traditional Paschal break, and I am very much looking forward to not paying any attention to A-fcuking-I and associated topics for two weeks (by the time I come back I expect you all to have been replaced with automata). I hope that you have a pleasant fortnight, and that those of you who celebrate the cruel and bloody execution of a poor carpenter who was JUST TRYING TO BE NICE TO EVERYONE FFS have a wonderful, chocolatey time.\n\nI am still Matt, this is still Web Curios, and here’s what crucifixion looks like if you’re curious.\n\nBy Steve Kim\n\nWELCOME THE ARRIVAL OF WHAT MIGHT, IF YOU SQUINT, BE SPRING, WITH THIS PLEASINGLY-UPLIFTING SELECTION OF TUNES COMPILED BY TOM SPOONER!\n\nTHE SECTION WHICH WOULD LIKE TO TELL ANY OF YOU WHO WERE CONTEMPLATING GOING TO SEE ‘BERLUSCONI, THE MUSICAL’ IN LONDON AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU REALLY SHOULDN’T BOTHER, PT.1:\n\nCreate Real Magic: I don’t like to start a newsletter with a let-down, but I feel it important to warn you upfront that, unless your definition of ‘real magic’ encompasses ‘poor-quality branded imagery from a globally-notorious polluter and purveyor of carbonated sugarwaters’, you are probably not going to feel the SURPRISE AND DELIGHT that the title here might promise you. Have you been waiting anxiously for the first sighting of an AI-powered consumer activation in the wild (and have a more miserable concatenation of words ever been written by a human in the course of our species’ long and inglorious history?)? YES YOU HAVE! So, then, welcome to this GPT/DALL-E powered marketing campaign by Coca Cola, which brings together a couple of different AI toys (natural language inputs, text-based image manipulation) to enable users from around the world to remix the Coke visual brand back catalogue into new and exciting and MODERN visuals thanks to the POWER OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE! The gimmick here is that you get access to a whole host of old Coke graphic design materials which you can incorporate into your own, ‘collaborative with the machine’ canvas – so, for example, pick a cheery Coke santa and then get the AI to imagine the dystopian scene around him (“Santa laughing merrily and lifting a coke to his lips while the bombs rain around an irradiated London”, that sort of thing) – all the images will be assessed in some way, with the ‘best’ ones being used in Coke’s global marketing, billboards, etc. Which, to be clear, is EXACTLY the same mechanic brands have been using to get cheap/free work out of creatives since the advent of the internet – except in this case they can’t even claim to be offering ‘exposure’ to graphic designers! Oh, and good luck actually getting the site to work properly – you need to sign up, which process is unpleasant enough in itself, and once you do there appears to be a ⅓ chance that the site just won’t work, and then once you’re in the interface is poorly-explained, and a bit clunky, and just not that much fun to play with. What does this show? It shows fcuk all really, but if I were to try and draw conclusions it’s that adding a spurious ‘AI’ layer to what is a tired, hackneyed promotional mechanic doesn’t make said mechanic any less tired and hackneyed.\n\nAdCreative AI: A few months ago I featured a site which purported to be a one-stop-shop for AI-generated creative work, but which in fact turned out to be a bait-and-switch to promote Wunderman or some other agency – this, though, is seemingly the real thing. “Generate conversion focused ad creatives and social media post creatives in a matter of seconds using Artificial Intelligence. Get better results while saving time”, burbles the site copy! “Simply tell our Artificial Intelligence your Target Audience, the platform you are creating the ads on, it will select the best tone and length for the platform while focusing on your target audience’s pain points.” This is priced VERY keenly – $77 a month for 50 ads a month, from what I can tell, though other tiers are available – and, look, while this isn’t going to produce anything other than the most baldly-functional of Insta/FB/etc ads, and whilst it’s not doing anything that you couldn’t do yourself by cobbling together a few AI services yourself for about half the monthly fee, and whilst I know none of YOU need this and none of YOU will feel the hot, heavy breath of The Future breathing down your professional necks, spare a moment to think of all the people in the Philippines and similar parts of the world who make their living with a Fiverr account and a Canva license and who are going to see things like this whittle their likely income from low-rent piecemeal digital work dwindle to not very much at all. Oh, and the data-cleaners too, per this article. Oh, and the journalists. I don’t mean to keep banging on about this, and I promise I will shut up about it soon, but I really don’t think anyone’s taking the coming jobpocalypse quite seriously enough (or maybe I’m just projecting my increasing unemployability, who knows?).\n\nThe Future of Customer Services: This is a link to a two-tweet thread, but I promise it’s worth the click if only to get a small window into the glorious future that is set to be AI-enabled customer service interfaces. Steve Guntrip was accidentally granted access to a trial being run by photo equipment shop DigistoreEU of a new GPT-powered customer service chatbot – as you will see from his screencaps of their interaction, it does not appear to be a significant upgrade on a human (although the amusing digression into obscene poetry and milkshake recipes was, if I’m honest, a pleasant surprise and the sort of thing I could maybe get behind next time I’m in an interminable menu deathloop on the phone to HMRC. Now, obviously this setup is a test, and wasn’t meant to be live, and is a VERY early days implementation of tech that is only going to get better…and yet, it doesn’t take a massive effort of will to conceive of a not-too-distant future in which all our interactions with the large corporations and cash-strapped public institutions that mandate our lives are managed by systems like this, and exactly how fun it will be when they go wrong but there’s no way of escaping from the horrible recursive AI-led conversation loop and there’s no killswitch to get straight to a human operator and so you’re just forced to listen to endless iterations of “I can’t help you with that, Dave” until whatever is ailing you finally becomes terminal.\n\nA Small AI-Enabled Desk Pet: By way of antidote to the…less-than-sunny tone of the last few links, here’s something that looks genuinely fun and which feels like another window into a future that’s a bit more whimsical and ludic and playful. This Twitter user has cobbled together a bunch of different systems to effectively create a little holographic cartoon rabbit desktop companion (it’ll make sense when you click, promise) which she can interact with through voice commands and which is obviously running on some local LLM and it is, honestly, SO CUTE. I really think that someone somewhere is going to make a killing selling things like this – but, also, if you’ve read any contemporary scifi in the past few decades (or watched enough B***k M****r), that there will be some…interesting examples of them going rogue. Whilst I am well aware that there are a million-and-one brand safety and protection reasons that mean this could never happen, part of me rather likes the idea of a brand offering an open-source, downloadable AI-enabled version of their mascot that any hobbyist can use to create something like this.\n\nFreedomGPT: Except, of course, what happens when someone creates a cute little holographic mascot thingy that sits on your desk and becomes your interactive gopher and characterful companion, but fits said cute little holographic mascot thingy with a jailbroken AI trained on horrible stuff? An AI like FreedomGPT, for example – which, in fairness, hasn’t been trained on more-or-less horrible stuff than any of the other more famous models but which instead has been tweaked so that it runs without any of the same guardrails. Want to ask it how to make bombs? It’ll tell you! Want it to give you tips on how to dispose of a dead body in such a way as to minimise detection in an urban environment? Got you covered! (An aside: to make this work properly you have to download it and run it locally – there’s a web interface, but it’s VERY SLOW). Amusingly (not hugely amusingly) this has been created as a promo by some moron VCs – WELL DONE GUYS YOU SO EDGY! To be clear, Web Curios neither endorses said VCs or any of the stuff that this bot tells you – I don’t, personally, think particular example is anything other than a silly stunt, but it’s an interesting indicator of all the fun things that are going to be coming our way in the coming months as people create their very own personalised machines – I have a slightly horrible feeling that we’re going to see a whole host of new Count Dankulas emerging, as a bunch of bedroom-based comedy edgelords compete to make their pet stochastic parrot say the worst things possible in the name of short-lived online notoriety.\n\nVoicechess: I promise we’re going to stop with the AI stuff shortly (no really, we are!), but before we do, another example of a GENUINELY POSITIVE USE-CASE! This is a prototypical voice-controlled chess, which is being developed by world-leading online chess platform Lichess and which you can try out yourself RIGHT NOW – all the work here is, from what I can tell, being done by off-the-shelf kit (I think they’re using Whisper for the audiorecognition, for example, though I may of course be wildly wrong here), and as such it’s a brilliant example of a useful, helpful solution to a real-life problem. Click ‘play the computer’ (or, you know, play with ACTUAL FRIENDS should you be fortunate enough to have any), click the small microphone icon in the top-right, and glory in the fact that you can now scream commands at your machine and watch as your pieces follow your commands. Because of the aforementioned natural language stuff you can get away without knowing proper chess notation, and saying stuff like ‘rook takes pawn’ actually works (although it saddens me slightly that the model doesn’t extent to ‘horsey takes bish’ and doesn’t seem to understand or enjoy it when you call them ‘prawns’), and, honestly, I think a big high-quality floorscreen on which you could play Battlechess like this, seated on thrones at either end and barking commands into the sky like some sort of mad despot king, sounds rather fun.\n\nText-to-Game: Ok, this is basically just a video showing off demo technology, but I promise you that the interface on display, which seems to let you generate a navigable 3d environment from nothing but text prompts, is astonishing. Although when you stop to think about it and realise that this is going to end up being used to generate a hitherto-unimaginable quantity of CG bongo on demand it becomes…less magical, frankly.\n\nThe Newspeak House Residency: This feels like an opportune moment to mention that my friend Ed, who runs Newspeak House in London, is currently looking for new residents to join for a year and pursue research projects around technology, government and civil society. “Newspeak House is a hub for communities working to change society with technology, spanning all kinds of civic institutions, including government, politics, activism, charities, journalism, think-tanks, NGOs, philanthropy, and academia. To quote the website, “at the heart of Newspeak House is its residential programme, running since 2015. Seven residents spend a year immersed in these communities, enjoying the chance to meet thousands of people and attend events held on their doorstep. The programme is designed to support mid-career technologists gain a holistic understanding of the civic landscape in the UK, in order to found groundbreaking new projects or seek strategic positions in key institutions. It’s ideal for people who have been working professionally for several years and are now looking to grow their network and spend time reflecting deeply on how they can best have impact on the world.” If you’re in London, or thinking of coming here, and fit the above description, and can afford to spend a year learning and thinking about your work and practice, this sounds like a genuinely interesting opportunity.\n\nThe Undeniable Street View: This is a really smart piece of comms – The Undeniable Street View is a project by War Up Close, which is an organisation dedicated to taking panoramic views of Ukraine in the aftermath of the Russian invasion, to document the destruction being wrought on cities across the country in immersive detail, and which basically does the ‘before/after’ thing using a StreetView-style interface. You can select from various places across Ukraine, and in your browser navigate the streets of six different cities to see what they looked like before and after the war started. This is, obviously, heartbreaking, but it’s also an incredibly effective piece of comms – a combination of the first-person perspective and the familiarity of the StreetView interface make it genuinely affecting seeing the homes reduced to rubble and the potholed streets just 18 months apart.\n\nVisit The Global SeedVault: Virtually, that is – I mean, obviously if you want to schlep to Svalbard and see it in person then more power to you but, well, it looks cold and remote and I’m not 100% sure exactly what you’d do there once you’d got past the majesty of the architecture and the wonder of all the, er, seeds. Perhaps it’s better that you just take this virtual tour instead, and spelunk inside the remarkable project – not least because, if you ask me, it would be near-impossible not to get quite a strong wave of claustrofuturefear walking those VERY THIN-seeming corridors under all that snow (I think it’s a fact of having played too many videogames of a certain type, but it’s very hard for me not to imagine a target reticule when I first-person stroll the corridors, for example). It really is quite wondrous, when you think about it, and this is a really nice way of learning a little bit more about the Vault and how it functions and all the amazing things that they have stored in there as a hedge against the point in the not-too-distant future at which we *really* fcuk everything up for good. Seriously though, if you’re claustrophobic and the idea of exploring lots of reasonably-tight corridors underground doesn’t wholly appeal then maybe don’t fullscreen this one.\n\nLocals and Tourists: I rather love this – “In 2010, cartographer Erica Fischer made some simple and spectacular maps of images added to Flickr. She classified photos as either from “locals” or “tourists”, based on how far their profile location was from the photo’s geotag. These maps revealed fascinating psychogeographic patterns of urban exploration and photographic worthiness. Last summer, Dario Taraborelli suggested extending this to iNaturalist observations.” For those unaware (er, as I was til I looked it up just now), iNaturalist is a websitecommunityportalthing for people worldwide who are “naturalists, citizen scientists, and biologists built on the concept of mapping and sharing observations of biodiversity across the globe” – so basically people have given it loads of data about things that they have spotted in the wild, whilst at the same time also giving it data about themselves and where they are from. Which means, in turn, that the site is able to track which sightings of nature have been recorded by people who are local to an area, and those which have been made by people who are visiting from afar – which, in turn, means that it can offer a reasonable heuristic for tourist volumes around the world. Honestly, this is fascinating, in part to see where people go (obviously the data here skews hard towards, say, bird enthusiasts and badger botherers, but you can use it as a reasonable heuristic for general tourism imho) but also to find places to go if you’re a particular fan of arthropods or ‘herps’ (or, perhaps more usefully, should you be the sort of person who really really really prefers to avoid ‘herps’ wherever possible and wants to know where they hang out so that you can be as far away from them as possible).\n\nBirdBuddy LIVE: I think I featured the BirdBiddy a few months ago – it’s an internet-connected bird feeder which you can set up to snap photos of the feathery little fcuks as they dine out on your dime. Now, those of us without a BirdBuddy can live vicariously through the experience of those who do thanks to this genuinely wonderful live feed of all the images being snapped of all the birds as they happen – click the link and marvel at the steady stream of lovely birds coming at you from across the world! At the time of writing it’s all slightly-underwhelming European varietals – why are there SO MANY tits? – but if you come back later in the day you can see some truly incredible flying fauna from the Americas which I promise you are mesmerising. This is genuinely heartwarming and great.\n\nKeyprint: “If the internet were a country, it’d be the 7th most polluting. In the past 10 years alone, websites have grown 320% heavier. We studied the carbon footprint of the internet’s top 500 websites.” So speaks this site – unsurprisingly a marketing effort by a carbon analytics platform for websites, but one which is quite nicely-presented, and interesting in terms of how different the estimated outputs are from site to site and platform to platform. I am still waiting for someone to run the first big ‘WHAT IS THE AI REVOLUTION COSTING THE PLANET???’ server farm energy consumption scare story (it can only be a matter of days, surely?), but I was interested to see that, according to this, at least, the carbon footprint of the OpenAI domain at least is quite small – although that’s quite possibly because that doesn’t encompass the domain that they’re running public GPT on. Anyway, this is both interesting and aesthetically up my street, but see what you think.\n\nJapanese Woodblock Print Search: Would you like a website that lets you search an archive of over 220,000 Japanese woodblock prints, either by keyword or by uploading pictures to find similar-looking prints? OF COURSE YOU WOULD! Aside from anything else, these are just beautiful and there’s something gorgeous about the way the site lets you see the changing an evolving styles of the artists through various eras of Japanese history (there are some really gorgeous pieces of design in the latter, post-1950s period in particular). Via the wonderful Nag, this one.\n\n11ftPlus8: I think every town above a certain size anywhere in the world has a BusFcukingBridge – you know, a bridge that wasn’t quite tall enough to let a full doubledecker underneath it, or a proper articulated lorry, but was both visually deceptive and appallingly-signposted and which as such each year claimed the roof of at least one out-of-town vehicle which totally misjudged the clearance and ended up shearing a few feet of metal onto unsuspected nearby pedestrians. You, er, you all had one of these, right? OF COURSE YOU DID! Anyway, this is a YouTube channel featuring footage of just such a bridge (ahem, sorry, “Railway Trestle”) in Durham, North Carolina, and if you want to see a LOT of videos of large vehicles failing to quite understand that they are taller than a bridge and, as a result, coming something of a cropper, then FILL YOUR BOOTS. A spiritual cousin of the World Bollard Association Twitter feed, there is also an accompanying website which tells me that the person behind this content has been doing this for 15 years – a degree of utterly pointless dedication that I can’t help but admire and salute.\n\nBy Petrina Hicks\n\nNEXT, ENJOY SOME TECH-HOUSE COURTESY OF THIS NEW MIX BY DON’T BLINK!\n\nTHE SECTION WHICH WOULD LIKE TO TELL ANY OF YOU WHO WERE CONTEMPLATING GOING TO SEE ‘BERLUSCONI, THE MUSICAL’ IN LONDON AT THE MOMENT THAT YOU REALLY SHOULDN’T BOTHER, PT.2:\n\nRoboPianist: Yes, ok fine, it *is* more AI and I am sorry – BUT I PROMISE THIS IS FUN AND CUTE AND NOT SCARY! This, instead, is a rather amazing demo which accompanies a recent research paper into the development of articulated robotics; the link takes you to a bit of code that lets you watch a pair of machine-controlled virtual hands, complete with fully-articulated fingers, manipulate themselves into playing a virtual keyboard; the amazing thing here is that this is all being calculated in realtime, with the ‘fingers’ interacting with the ‘keyboard’ as though both existed in physical space, which is…slightly mind-boggling, if I’m honest. You can change the song you’re asking the machine to play, and even use your mouse to try and impede its progress – which feels mean, fine, but also allows you to see that, yes, this really is ‘working out how to ‘play’ the piano on the fly’ which, I repeat, is astonishing. I know that any sort of humanoid robot is a long way away, but the advances in articulation currently being achieved really are quite amazing.\n\nChia Earth: I can’t stress enough how much I am enjoying sites like this one at present. Chia Earth is…what is it? It’s an ASCII-ish series of small meditations on Being Online. It’s a small repository of links and thinking about a different type of internet; something small and crafted. It’s, almost certainly, a bit too twee. It’s part of a growing dialogue between digital makers and creatives about what a folk internet might look and feel and sound like, and how it might work, and what it might be for. I encourage you all to have a click and an explore and a think – you can find lots of interesting things through this if you dig enough, I promise.\n\nDial: You know that ever-so-slightly satisfying lockpicking minigame mechanic that you get in a certain flavour of videogame? Yes, well imagine that but significantly more inscrutable and online. As far as I can tell, this is a small lockbreaking toy which, should you manage to UNLOCK THE DIAL, will grant you an access code to shiny new alternative browser Arc – I can’t tell you whether or not this actually in fact works or whether it’s an incredibly cruel troll designed to keep new-browser-enthusiasts turning the dials for evermore as, honestly, I got bored after approximately 12 seconds, but those of you with more lockcracking nous (and, frankly, patience) than I might be able to get something moe out of this than I did.\n\nSnack Memories: A Twitter account dedicated to sharing pictures of old snack foods which have since been discontinued – this is runout of the US and so obviously has a North American bias, but that’s not bad thing when you consider how famously-batsh1t food across the Atlantic often is. Kellog’s Toaster Pizzas! That weird time when fast food chain Denny’s offered up “Frodo’s Pot Roast Skillet (2012-2012): Part of the themed promotional menu for “The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,” this meal featured slow-cooked pot roast, roasted carrots, red potatoes, onions, celery, and mushrooms, topped with shredded cheddar, served in a skillet”! The honestly repellent-sounding Nabisco Hammies, which had possibly the best slogan ever and were: “Party crackers, with the “taste of baked ham”, as well as pineapple and cloves, pressed into the vague shape of a baked ham. The slogan? “Ham tasty!…Ham shapey!””” This is genuinely brilliant and will make your Twitter experience marginally better (whilst it simultaneously continues to get worse each and everyday thanks to That Fcuking Man).\n\nThe World Happiness Report: This made me slightly annoyed, if I’m honest, which frankly feels like something of an ironic slap in the face. Were you aware that there exists a World Happiness Report, ranking the world’s nations based on how happy they are, a quality inferred from a range of different statistical markers, each weighted to provide an overall per-capita happiness quantification? I mean, actually, now I come to think of it this *does* ring a vague bell, but the latest dataset has just been released and therefore it seems timely to link to the website accompanying it, which purports to let you explore the numbers and run country comparisons and all that sort of numberwrangling fun. You may or may not be unsurprised to know that Finland ranks top of the list (I’ll be honest with you here – the Finns I have met have not, in my experience at least, struck me as particularly full of joie de vivre, but perhaps that’s just how they react to me), with Israel. The Netherlands, Switzerland and New Zealand making up the rest of the top-10 (the UK, should you be interested, is in 27th place, which feels both…surprisingly high, and also a real indictment of all the countries below us) and Afghanistan propping up the table (you can imagine the Taliban being pretty gutted) – this SHOULD be the point where I tell you how much fun it is to explore the data and delve into the reasons why certain countries do so well, how the list changes when you look at different indicators…but I can’t say that, because the website is a fcuking broken horrorshow and the ‘data exploration’ bit is almost comically non-functional (in Chrome, at least), and…it’s just such a shame, to be honest, because this is the sort of thing which could be genuinely useful for all sorts of planning and research purposes but which is rendered entirely pointless as a result of some really crap webwork. Amusingly this is sponsored by both Walls and Unilever, who you’d think might be a bit irked at how poorly their sponcash had been spunked but who, I suspect, just signed off some monies and forgot all about why.\n\nCollected: This is a nice idea – collected is a site which each time you visit presents 8 different examples of good homepage/landing page design. That’s it. Each visit you get a different shuffle of the 2000+ examples it’s got in its database, meaning it’s unlikely you’ll see too much repetition unless you get REALLY obsessional, and there are some really nice bits of work in here – well done Jonas Pelzer whose work this apparently is.\n\nWhat Do People Wear In Paris?: Should anyone reading this actually know me in real life, I imagine you are sniggering slightly at the idea of me including a fashion channel thing. “But Matt!”, people who know me would probably say at this juncture, “You have worn literally exactly the same clothes for approximately three decades and they hang on you like a ‘comedy’ outfit on a lab skeleton! What do you know or care of the stylish people of the world’s most fashionable city?” To which I would probably respond “ffs must you always kick me? MUST YOU!”, but also “look, just because I dress like a blind tramp doesn’t mean that I can’t appreciate the style of other people”, and “the thing about this video series is that not only are there some pretty interesting outfits on display (if you like that sort of thing), but there’s also something really quite nice about the way in which the person filming asks questions about the lives and hopes and wants of the featured fashionistas beyond the cut of their cloth; it feels human and…nice, for want of a better word, and I found myself watching more of these than I ever expected to. Oddly enough it reminded me a bit of the OLD SCHOOL days of the Sartoralist and similar, which gave me a pleasing nostalgia-kick and reminded me of a time when someone I know was featured in it and referred to as a ‘Grup’ which I still have no fcuking clue as to the meaning of.\n\nGomps: Ok, so this is QUITE technical and game development-y, but given I have no idea who any of you are and what any of you do or are interested in I suppose there’s the vanishing outside possibility that for one of you this will be aTRANSFORMATIVE piece of software. Gomps is a tool which basically lets you add multiplayer to any game built on the Unity engine – or at least very basic multiplayer features, specifically “See other players ghosts around you in real time, and leave notes throughout the game worlds for other players to read.“ Which, generally, I am a huge fan of as a mechanic – I really like the Souls-esque idea of asynchronous interplayer communications (PSEUD!) and would happily see it applied as a layer to basically every communal online experience (I still remember those nascent attempts to create a universal annotation layer over the web in the early-10s – a terrible idea, but one with SO MUCH comedic potential) – and the fact that this basically lets you do this with ANY game in your Steam library,adding a slightly social element to games that didn’t previously have them, strikes me as not only technically amazing but also a pretty cool way of exploring some emergent gameplay ideas.\n\nSplace: Seeing as we’re doing games, Splace is an interesting idea which is simultaneously very different from the last link and also very vaguely related – the idea of the app is that it effectively (and I appreciate I am probably simplifying the concept in ways the devs won’t necessarily enjoy so, er, sorry!) creates communities around individual games, with each title featured having its own map onto which users can add annotations, gameplay clips, tips and tricks, Easter Eggs, etc, with the idea that eventually there will be a ‘Splace’ for every single title within which its fans will be able to interact and chat and all that sort of jazz. Which, effectively, is a forum with bells and whistles, and I don’t know whether or not there’s enough here to hook people in – but, at the same time, I can see how a map-based interface collecting content relating to specific in-game locations and instances could be useful. Although, of course, it could just end up being flooded with content from moronic children – WHO KNOWS? God it’s exciting being online, isn’t it?\n\nMonkeyType: Look, I know that ‘learning to type better’ is noone’s idea of fun (unless you’re Mavis Beacon) but, honestly, now that we’re rapidly coming to the fag-end of the period in which ‘being marginally better at Google than your peers’ is considered any sort of competitive advantage whatsoever (I am so scared) you might want to start enhancing some of your other skills – and given we’re apparently all going to spend much of our remaining future years typing instructions to machines (until it all goes voice recognition and our fingers atrophy as our stomachs swell) you may as well take this opportunity to steal a march on your fellow prompt engineers (lol!) and learn how to communicate with The Machine marginally faster than they can. MonkeyType is a genuinely decent typing trainer, with a nice minimal style and a bunch of different training exercises that you can do to improve your performance. Look, you and I both know that this is a Cnut-like (the king, not the bowdlerised swear) attempt to stave off the inevitable obsolescence of the white collar office drone but, well, it’s worth a try, eh?\n\nThe Blue Car: The TikTok account of a remote control car, or rather its owner – the car is used to run errands and do favours for people, and whilst you might not think that you would be amused and entertained by dashcam footage from a small RC vehicle going to the shops with a $10 bill and returning with some groceries let me assure you that you are wrong and that this is the most charming four-wheeled content you will see all day.\n\nZigazoo: As the largely-confected fury about TikTok continues to swirl – gyac, everyone, if you’re worried about nefarious datacollection by bad actors then a) lol! Too late!; and b) have you checked how secure your router is?; and c) what about all the OTHER apps ffs?! – so a youth-focused competitor is making its move. Zigazoo is basically ‘TikTok for kids and with more guardrails built in’ (you will, doubtless, be heartened to learn that the platform’s ‘mission’ is to “bring out the best in humankind, build genuine connections, and cultivate a better society through positive, authentic social media built on ethical algorithms. At the largest of scales. For all”, which is nice), which promotes POSITIVITY and doesn’t allow text comments or messaging to supposedly keep it safe and clean, and the content is supposedly vetted to make sure it’s ‘positive-only’ – which, honestly, sounds MISERABLE, can you imagine a social feed filled with nothing but teenagers talking about how happy they are? Still, if you want to give a child in your life yet another reason to spend the majority of their waking hours staring slack-jawed and swiping into the eye of their portable, infinite Wunderkammer then GO FOR IT!\n\nRoast Me Greta: To be clear – I don’t find this clever or funny, but I do think it’s quite remarkable that someone’s been able to spin up this site which lets you click on a picture of Greta Thunberg and have a voice read out some words in her voice about what an ar$ehole you are for not doing enough to save the planet. This feels like it was created by a 14 year old – and it’s sort of amazing that it’s possible, and that the faux-Thunberg sounds as convincing as it does.\n\nWelcome Dream: I don’t really want to tell you anything about this. Click, explore, read, and fall down the rabbitholes of this seemingly-simple but VERY twisty and surprisingly rich little indieweb project, where every hyperlink takes you to a new fragment of…fiction? Dream? Parable? Thesis? Manifesto? I honestly couldn’t tell you, but I really really really like this. It makes me want to misuse the adjective ‘Borgesian’, which is pretty much the highest praise I can bestow.\n\nSequoia Health: This made me laugh a LOT. Sequoia is apparently a ‘men’s sexual health’ app – exactly what it does is unclear, but apparently it will allow you to “Track, analyze, and improve your intimate health by executing an individually created training program developed by sexual sphere medical experts.” Yes, that’s right, SEXUAL SPHERE MEDICAL EXPERTS! There are tests you can do – beautifully, the screenshot accompanying the ‘tests’ section of the site shows the app giving a reassuring diagnosis of ‘you seem to have a healthy erection’, but HOW DOES IT KNOW?!? – and exercises it can walk you through, and a degree of what I presume is performance tracking, and, best of all, a KNOWLEDGE CENTRE featuring helpful articles and useful content, where the example they have chosen to feature is a piece headlines “Tight underwear and its impact on men’s health”. SIGN ME UP! Should you feel that this is a product you need in your life, be aware that you will need to subscribe and pay a monthly fee – but you can’t put a price on sexual health, right? RIGHT! Reassuringly the site also features a bunch of testimonials, so you can rest easy knowing that the app was awarded “Alpha Starup at Web Summit”, and is a “Partner of the Unition Nations Population Fund” and was also named as an “Impact Starup at Web Summit” (all sic), which I imagine means you’ll all be rushing to exchange your hard-earned pennies for some d1ck-diagnostics. I am sure all the 5-star reviews on the app store are DEFINITELY LEGIT.\n\nThe Journey Planner Challenge: SO GOOD, or at least it is if you’re either a Londoner or the sort of transport nerd who knows the tube map by heart despite not being one – The Journey Planner Challenge offers you five tube stations, and you have to put them in the order that lets you travel between them in the shortest time. I promise you that this is more fun than it sounds, and EVEN BETTER it can be used as an utterly spurious “I am more London than you are” badge of honour with your girlfriend who always makes fun of you for having grown up in Swindon even though you were born in London and are DEFINITELY a Londoner whatever she thinks (what? Projecting? No).\n\nDance Music WTF: The videos section of Curios is always hardest for me to write, mainly as I find attempting to describe music in prose almost impossibly difficult (or, more accurately, impossibly difficult to do without it reading really, really badly) – in part because I simply don’t really get genre minutiae and the like. Which, if this quiz is anything to go by, is because genre minutiae is absolute bunkum and means NOTHING – here the challenge is to listen to a piece of dance music and identify from a short clip whether the track in question is (for example, hardstep or gabber or nu-hardcore or technotrepanning – one of these may be of my own invention). It is in part VERY HARD, but more than that it’s genuinely amusing to finally find out what “Chemical Breaks” are meant to sound like. This feels both like something to waste time with at work and something which you could legitimately lose a whole afterparty to circa 5am.\n\nBy Useless Arm\n\nTHE FINAL MIX OF THIS WEEK’S CURIOS COMES FROM THE CHARMINGLY-NAMED SUPER YAMBA BAND AND COMBINES FUNK AND AFROBEAT AND LATIN STUFF AND IS GENERALLY A VERY GOOD TIME INDEED!\n\nTHE CIRCUS OF TUMBLRS IS EMPTY AGAIN!\n\nTHE TROUGH OF (INSTA) FEEDS!\n\nSlappy The Little Green Frog: It’s a small green frog, on Insta! From what I can tell there’s noone in the comments of any of these pics screaming “THAT BEHAVIOUR IS A CLEAR SIGN OF AMPHIBIAN DISTRESS”, so I feel reasonably-safe in recommending this to you.\n\nCharlie Engman: I’ll be honest – I don’t really know what’s going on here, or why Engman makes images like this (unsettling ones, mainly, mixing media and human/AI created works in the feed to dizzying effect), but I very much like the style here.\n\nLONG THINGS WHICH ARE LONG!\n\nThe Open AI letter: You will, of course, have heard ALL about this this week if you’ve paid any attention to the news (and can I just say that I am really not enjoying all the airspace being given to people who know literally nothing about any of this stuff to opine on THE DANGERS (OR BENEFITS) OF AI – I am looking specifically at ‘lazy person’s go-to intellectual Yuval Noah Harari, whose interview scaremongering about AGI on Radio4 this week practically had steam coming out of my ears, so unhelpful and unanchored in practical reality was it), but if you’ve not read it then it’s worth taking a look at the actual document to see what Gary Marcus, Elon Musk et al have actually signed and what exactly they are calling for when they ask for a ‘pause’ on the development of post-GPT4 iterations of LLMs. There are LOTS OF OPINIONS about this everywhere, and, honestly, you don’t really need to hear mine beyond my general feeling that LOL ONCE AGAIN WE WORRY AT THE BOLTS OF THE GATE AND THE OILING OF THE HINGES WHILE THE HORSE CAVORTS HAPPILY IN DISTANT MEADOWS, but, should you be interested in a counterargument, this piece does a reasonable job of articulating one or two objection to the position outlined in the letter (mainly: that the dangers are already here and that worrying about ‘the future’ rather neglects to pay attention to the present; and that we might want to think a bit harder about all the things that are going to happen as a result of the fact that the current iteration of this tech is already here and already in the wild). I agree that this stuff needs more thought, and that it needs regulating, and that ploughing headlong into implementing untested technologies whose impacts we don’t necessarily understand is A Bad And Silly Thing To Do – but, look, that’s already happened, so can we maybe instead focus more energy on thinking about what some sort of universal regulatory framework might look like, and how one might go about creating enforceable standards, and all that really boring stuff that actually matters (on which point, if you’re interested in this then it’s worth reading the UK government’s consultation paper on A"
