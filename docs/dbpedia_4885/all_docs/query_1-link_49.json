I’m less ahead than I would’ve liked — PRINT has already beaten me to the punch! — but here we are, a couple of days earlier than usual, with another look at some new and recent book covers. April is National Poetry Month in the US so there are a few poetry covers in the mix, as well as a couple of covers from independent presses, an Australian cover, and all the usual suspects.\n\nBones Worth Breaking by David Martinez; design by Alex Merto (MCD / April 2024)\n\nCharlie Hustle by Keith O’Brien; design by Eli Mock (Pantheon / March 2024)\n\nI just like the type and the colour palette here.\n\nCahokia Jazz by Francis Spufford; design by Henry Petrides (Faber & Faber / April 2024)\n\nThe Curse of Pietro Houdini by Derek B. Miller; design by David Gee (Avid Reader Press / January 2024)\n\nDivided Island by Daniela Tarazona; design by Jack Smyth (Deep Vellum / April 2024)\n\nThe Formula by Joshua Robinson and Jonathan Clegg; design by Pete Garceau (Mariner Books / March 2024)\n\nTwo nonfiction sports books in one post! Does Formula One really count as a sport? Not for me, Clive. But the subtitle says it is, and a Canadian friend once told me that for something to qualify as a sport it has to endanger your life in some fundamental way, so I guess F1 qualifies under Quebec Rules for Teen Boys if nothing else.\n\nAnyway, it might be fun to do a post of interesting sports books covers at some point if I can find the time (let me know if any great examples come to mind!).\n\nHoney by Victor Lodata; design by Robin Bilardello (Harper / April 2023)\n\nKill For Me Kill For You by Steve Cavanagh; design by Laywan Kwan (Atria / March 2024)\n\nI feel like this is a bit different for a psychological thriller? I like the type a lot.\n\nKnife by Salman Rushdie; design by Arsh Raziuddin (Random House / April 2024)\n\nInterestingly, there is an “eye” motif on the spine with the Random House logo in the centre. Look for it next time you’re in a bookstore.\n\nAlso, this cover isn’t the first to riff, consciously or otherwise, on the cut canvases of Italian artist Lucio Fontana. The cover of Ball by Tara Ison, designed by Kelly Winton, comes to mind. I’m sure there are other examples (David Gee’s unpublished cover for Lolita. Are the more?).\n\nMadness by Antonia Hylton; design by Daniel Benneworth-Gray (Footnote Press / March 2024)\n\nMemory Piece by Lisa Ko; design Grace Han (Riverhead / March 2024)\n\nThe Moon That Turns You Back by Hala Alyan; design by Vivian Lopez Rowe (Ecco / March 2024)\n\nThe Obscene Bird of Night by José Donoso; design by Joan Wong (New Directions / April 2024)\n\nPrairie Edge by Conor Kerr; design Kate Sinclair (Strange Light / April 2024)\n\nThe Roadmap of Loss by Liam Murphy; design by Lisa White (Echo / January 2024)\n\nI don’t post enough Australian cover designs generally, and I’m late to this one, but I like the grunginess of it.\n\nShort War by Lily Meyer; design by Emily Mahon (Strange Object / April 2024)\n\nSociopath by Patric Gagne; design by Rodrigo Corral (Simon & Schuster / April 2024)\n\n36 Ways of Writing a Vietnamese Poem by Nam Le; design by Janet Hansen (Knopf / March 2024)\n\nIt’s nice to have two big, blocky, black and white type-only covers this month.\n\nTwelve Trees by Daniel Lewis; design by Alison Forner; illustration by Eric Nyquist (Avid Reader / March 2024)\n\nThis reminded me of Eric’s illustrations for the covers of Jeff Vandermeer’s Southern Reach trilogy designed by Charlotte Strick.\n\nWeird Black Girls by Elwin Cotman; design by Michael Morris (Scribner / April 2024)\n\n(The illustration also looks like something from Area X / the Southern Reach trilogy!)\n\nWhile We Were Burning by Sara Koffi; design by Vi-An Nguyen (G.P. Putnam’s Sons / April 2024)\n\nWith My Back to the World by Victoria Chang; design by Thom Colligan (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / April 2024)\n\nYou Are Here edited by Ada Limón; design by Mary Austin Speaker; art by Enikő Katalin Eged (Milkweed / April 2024)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHello! I hope you’re safe and well wherever you are.\n\nBefore we get to the covers, a couple of brief admin things. First up, there have been a couple of behind-the-scenes changes at the CO this past month. They’ve solved a few tech issues for me and hopefully no one else has noticed. Secondly, I’ve been tinkering with the RSS. I’m not sure that’s quite right yet, so apologies if it’s not been working as expected. Let me know if you’re experiencing any weirdness.\n\nI also wanted quickly mention that the deadline for the DPI mentorship scheme has been extended to April 12th. I’m not involved with the DPI, but some really great people are so if you are a designer from an under represented background living in the UK or Ireland, you should think about applying!\n\nAnyway, it’s a really big post this month! The are lots of great covers with the UK, Australia and Canada all represented, as well as the usual folks from US. There are some compare-and-contrasts, a couple of covers from indie presses, a couple of covers for translations, and a couple of poetry covers too. There’s even a meandering digression in the middle (sorry). Enjoy!\n\nAnxiety by Samir Chopra; design by Karl Spurzem (Princeton University Press / March 2024)\n\nCandy Darling by Cynthia Carr; design by Alex Merto (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / March 2024)\n\nCrisis Actor by Declan Ryan; design by Stephanie Cui (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / February 2024)\n\nFourteen Days edited by Margaret Atwood & Douglas Preston; design by Nathan Burton (Harper / February 2024)\n\nFree Therapy by Rebecca Ivory; design by Luke Bird (Vintage / March 2024)\n\nFruit of the Dead by Rachel Lyon; design by Math Monahan (Scribner / March 2024)\n\nSo this cover sent me down a bit of a rabbit hole. It reminded me of a cover design from a few years ago. It didn’t really look the same but, in my mind at least, this other cover featured a blue-red capsule shape (possibly a stretched illustration of a planet and its core) centred on a white background with black Swiss-style sans serif type. It was not exactly minimalist, but clean and precise. I think I saw it on Twitter back in the day. I thought it was maybe literary sci-fi or pop science, and published by one of the big American imprints. I was also pretty convinced that it was designed by Alex Merto or possibly John Gall. One of the dudes.\n\nThis is not the first time I have thought about this cover, and I can, or at least could, picture it quite clearly. The problem is that I can find no evidence of this cover ever existing, and the more I think about, the more the details shift and doubt creeps in. I don’t seem to have posted it anywhere, and I can’t find it in the usual places. It’s possible that I am getting some of the crucial details wrong, mentally combining a couple of covers into one, or it was something other than an actual book cover. But maybe this is some kind of Visual Mandela Effect thing, and this design that I’ve believed existed for years is actually a figment of my imagination.\n\nMy search has felt a bit like the online equivalent of walking into a bookstore and asking for the book with the blue cover. It has made realise that we have very few tools to find cover designs in a systematic way, especially since the Book Cover Archive stopped being a going concern. You just kind of have to browse and I hope you eventually look in the right place (or risk slowly lose your sanity).\n\nAnyway, if this mystery cover is ringing any bells with you, please let me know and put me out of my misery. I have been going slightly crazy. (This sort of thing happens more than I care to admit by the way, but it is particularly bad this time! And, no, I do not have much of a life. Why do you ask?)\n\nHeadshot by Rita Bullwinkel; design by Lynn Buckley; photo by Jenna Garrett (Viking / March 2024)\n\nTwo boxing covers in one month…\n\nThe History of My Sexuality by Tobi Lakmaker; design by Arneaux (Granta / January 2024)\n\n(Thanks to Jon Gray for helping me with the design credit for this and the other Granta title Three Births below. Publishers: post the design credits with your cover reveals!)\n\nThe Hive and the Honey by Paul Yoon; design by Craig Fraser (Simon & Schuster / March 2024)\n\nThe cover of the US edition of The Hive and the Honey, published by S & S in October last year, was design by Oliver Munday.\n\nHow to Make Herself Agreeable to Everyone by Cameron Russell; design by Arsh Raziuddin (Random House / March 2024)\n\nI Love You So Much It’s Killing Us Both by Mariah Stovall; design by Jack Smyth (Soft Skull / February 2024)\n\nLobster by Hollie McNish; design by Jack Smyth (Little, Brown / March 2024)\n\nThe two Jacks\n\nThe Manicurist’s Daughter by Susan Lieu; design by Juliana Lee; art by Justin Metz (Celadon Books / March 2024)\n\nWhile looking for the other, possibly imaginary, book cover, I came across the cover for the New Directions edition of The Musical Brain by César Aira designed by Rodrigo Corral and Zak Tebbal a few times. It was on one or two best of 2015 lists, including mine.\n\nIs neon-style lettering on covers a bit of thing? (see also Candy Darling above)\n\nNo Judgment by Lauren Oyler; design by Tree Abraham (HarperOne / March 2024)\n\nThose curvy “u”s are fun.\n\nThe Observable Universe by Heather McCalden; design by Arsh Raziuddin and Gaby Pesqueira Ortiz (Hogarth / March 2024)\n\nTwo very nice, poster-like covers from Arsh Raziuddin this month:\n\nPelican Girls by Julia Malye; design by Joanne O’Neill (Harper / March 2024)\n\nPiglet by Lottie Hazell; design by Jenni Oughton; art by Noah Verrier (Henry Holt / February 2024)\n\nBeci Kelly designed the covers of the UK (left) and Australian (right) editions of Piglet:\n\nRainbow Black by Maggie Thrash; design by Joanne O’Neill (Harper Perennial / March 2024)\n\nAnd two contrasting covers from Joanne O’Neill too this month:\n\nSorry for the Inconvenience But This Is an Emergency by Lynne Jones; design by Steve Leard (Hurst / March 2024)\n\nThere’s Always This Year by Hanif Abdurraqib; design by Tyler Comrie; photograph by Matt Eich (Random House / March 2024)\n\nThirst by Marina Yuszczuk; design by Kaitlin Kall (Dutton / March 2024)\n\nThe slightly more gothic cover of the Australia and UK editions of Thirst was designed by Luke Bird. Scribe are publishing it in October.\n\nThree Births by K Patrick; design by David Pearson (Granta / March 2024)\n\nThe Understory by Saneh Sangsuk; design by Emily Mahon (Deep Vellum / March 2024)\n\nThe cover of the UK edition of The Understory, published by Peirene Press in October last year, was designed by Orlando Lloyd. The illustration is by Miki Lowe.\n\nYour Absence is Darkness by Jón Kalman Stefánsson; design by Jason Arias (Biblioasis / March 2024)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading...\n\nHey. I hope you’re keeping safe and well wherever you are. I’m going to keep this very short as there’s lots going on, but there some great covers, and a couple of tenuous comparisons this month (hey, I can’t help how my brain works!) . Enjoy!\n\nAlphabetical Diaries by Sheila Heti; design by Na Kim (Farrar, Straus & Giroux / February 2024)\n\nNa Kim also designed the cover of Sheila Heti’s novel Pure Colour.\n\nAmerican Mother by Column McCann with Diane Foley; design by Greg Heinimann (Bloomsbury / February 2024)\n\nAntiquity by Hanna Johansson; design by Nicole Caputo (Catapult / February 2024)\n\nThis reminded me of Akiko Stehrenberger‘s poster for the movie Funny Games. They don’t really look alike, and the tone is very different, but I think it was the close crop and the hair that brought it to mind.\n\nThe Blueprint by Rae Giana Rashad; design by Robin Bilardello (Harper / February 2024)\n\nCorey Fah Does Social Mobility by Isabel Waidner; design by Kapo Ng (Graywolf / February 2024)\n\nDirtbag by Amber A’Lee Frost; design by Rob Grom (St. Martin’s Press / December 2023)\n\nThis brought to mind Peter Mendelsund’s cover for The Woman Destroyed by Simone Beauvoir, published by Pantheon, which in turn reminded me Gunter Rambow‘s Gitanes, Un Hommage à Max Ponty poster…\n\nFire So Wild by Sarah Ruiz-Grossman; design by Joanne O’Neill (Harper / Feburary 2024)\n\nThe Last Days of the Midnight Ramblers by Sarah Tomlinson; design by Dave Litman (Flatiron Books / February 2024)\n\nLove Novel by Ivana Sajko; design by Jason Arias (Biblioasis / February 2024)\n\nThe image is taken from the 17th Century painting ‘The Torture of Prometheus’ by Giovacchino Assereto (thanks for letting me know, Jason!). The tight crop (which is great!), reminded me of Peter Hujar’s 1969 photograph ‘Orgasmic Man’, which was used on the cover of A Little Life by Hanya Yanagihara designed by Cardon Webb a few years ago. Art imitating art, kind of?\n\nNightwatching by Tracy Sierra; design by Dave Litman (Pamela Dorman Books / February 2024)\n\nI swear all Dave’s covers come in pairs….\n\nOurs by Phillip B. Williams; design by Lynn Buckley; illustration by Damilola Opedun (Viking / February 2024)\n\nPraiseworthy by Alexis Wright; design by John Gall (New Directions / February 2024)\n\nJohn also designed the cover of the New Directions edition of Carpentaria by Alexis Wright, also published this month.\n\nSinking Bell by Bojan Louis; design by Tom Etherington (Cinder House / February 2024)\n\nUS edition of Sinking Bell, published by Graywolf in 2022), was designed by Adam Bohannon.\n\nSplinters by Leslie Jamison; design by Gregg Kulick (Little, Brown & Co / February 2024)\n\nThe cover of the UK edition of Splinters, published this month by Granta, was designed by Jack Smyth.

Or am I just noticing it now because I’m looking for it?\n\nWandering Stars by Tommy Orange; design by Linda Huang (Knopf / February 2024)\n\nThe cover of the UK edition of Wandering Stars, which is being published by Vintage next month, was designed by Suzanne Dean.\n\nYou Glow in the Dark by Liliana Colanzi; design by Jamie Keenan (New Directions / February 2024)\n\nLike this:\n\nLike Loading..."
