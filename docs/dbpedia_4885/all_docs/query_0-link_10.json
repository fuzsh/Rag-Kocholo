        "text": "Steve Oliver(National Candidate, Bendigo West) Born and raised in Castlemaine, Oliver was a school sporting prodigy, captaining the State Under 17 cricket side, winning his local golf club championship at 17, and being drafted at pick 26 by Carlton Football Club in the 1987-8 draft. A Coodabeen champion if ever there was one, one comment on the 1987 draft described him as the best country footballer in years but he continually refused to move to the city. He regularly would return to Bendigo to play with his mates and never really committed to life at Carlton, eventually playing 13 games with the club in his second stint 1992-94. He then returned to Castlemaine and to play local country footy, kicking more than a thousand goals including four times passing a century of goals in a season. For the past three years he has been working as the Chief Executive Officer of the Bendigo Football Netball League.\n\nI hope to have the full Victorian election website up within the next fortnight.\n\nAddendum: Before I'm swamped with names of past politicians, here's a few past examples of sportsmen who have proved that sport and politics do, and sometimes do not, mix.\n\n252 game veteran Melbourne player Brian Dixon became MP for St Kilda, and former test cricketer and selector Sam Loxton served in the Victorian Parliament. Loxton even played for Victoria while an MP. He is also currently Australia's oldest living test cricketer.\n\nFormer AFL Players Ray Groom (92 games Melbourne) and Darrel Baldock (119 games St Kilda) served in the Tasmanian parliament, Groom becoming Premier and Baldock leaving politics to coach his beloved St Kilda. Groom also served in the Commonwealth parliament. Former state cricketers Brian Davison and Tony Benneworth also became state politicians.\n\nFormer NSW Labor MP Mike Cleary was a dual international, and Queensland National Mick Vievers played for League for Australia and brought the subtle skills he'd learnt as a front rower to politics. Former test cricketer Tom Vievers briefly served as a Queensland Labor MP.\n\nFormer Australian test cricketer Gil Langley served in the SA Parliament a member for Unley, and former Adelaide Crows star Nigel Smart tried to win Norwood at the 2006 state election.\n\nFormer AFL star Maurice Rioli was a Labor member of the NT Parliament.\n\nFormer professional tennis player John Alexander won Bennelong at the 2010 Federal election.\n\nCurrent Liberal Leader Ted Bailieu (who's tall enough to have played) ran the quixotic campaign of former Carlton Player Peter 'Percy' Jones (249 games Carlton) to win the safe Labor seat of Melbourne at the 1988 Victorian election.\n\nComments\n\nAnother long-time Victorian ALP MP was former Geelong Player Neil (Nipper) Tresize. He served 28 years as a member of the Legislative Assembly,\n\nfor the electoral district of Geelong West from 1964 to 1967\n\nand Geelong North from 1967 to 1992 and as Minister for\n\nYouth, Sport and Recreation from 1982 to 1985 and Minister\n\nfor Sport and Recreation from 1985 to 1992.\n\nCOMMENT: I even have him in the election website. His son Ian is currently the MP for Geelong as well.\n\n- Ausdavo October 08, 2010 at 01:57 PM\n\nPaul Gibson, NSW member for Blacktown played for Penrith and Manly.\n\nAnd don't forget Sir Hubert Opperman, cyclist and Immigration Minister.\n\n- Liam October 08, 2010 at 02:22 PM\n\nNot forgetting one of the toughest of them all Kevin (kandos) Ryan frontrower for St George and Canterbury Bankstown (captain coach) , and Labor MP for the NSW state seat of Hurstville.\n\nCOMMENT: He later had a couple of goes as an Indepndent as well.\n\n- Walter Dixon October 08, 2010 at 10:38 PM\n\nPeter Hall, Nationals Vic, used to play for Carlton. (37 senior games between 1971-74).\n\nI only know this because my primary school library teacher was his wife and had an old poster in the school library....\n\nCOMMENT: I've chased down his record and added it.\n\n- Michael October 11, 2010 at 07:31 AM\n\nRon McAuliffe Qld Senator 1971-81. I recollect talk two decades ago about Qld Labor trying to draft Wally Lewis as a candidate. Is it out of order to mention Gerald Ford, Jack Kemp and JC Watts in a footnote to this?\n\nCOMMENT: McAuliffe was much higher profile as an administrator than as a player. He's the origin of the famous story of Whitlam as Prime Minister going out to toss the coin at a NSW v QLD game in the pre-State of Origin days. As Whitlam and McAuliffe walked back after the toss, Lang Park having erupted in a cacophony of boos and jeers, Whitlam turned to McAuliffe and said \"McCauliffe, never again take me anywhere where you are so unpopular.\"\n\nNumerous stories of offers to footballers like Lewis are around. The same story goes for Steve Waugh, and on the Liberal side with former Rugby Union Captain Nick Farr-Jones. The offer gets made, it is not necessarily sought out, and more often than not is rejected. Mike Cleary was once asked why he became a Labor MP, and is reported to have answered that Labor were the first to ask. Whether this is true or an urban myth I'm not sure.\n\n- Tom Round October 11, 2010 at 01:07 PM\n\nAntony,\n\nYou may be able to help. Graham Annesley is contesting Miranda in March for the Liberals. Would he be the first former top grade official (Referee/umpire) to hold a seat in parliament? As outlined, plenty of players have stepped up, but I cannot recall an elite referee making the jump.\n\nCOMMENT: I really don't have an answer.\n\n- Keith October 12, 2010 at 10:42 AM\n\nCome on, what about the girls? Kirstie Marshall, surely, deserves a mention? Former Olympic ariel skier who has held the Melbourne seat of Forest Hill since 2002.\n\n- Rod Swift October 13, 2010 at 06:51 AM\n\nWhat about Dr Ric Charlesworth Federal Member for Perth, National Hockey Player, Coach of both Men's and Women's National Hockey Teams with great success and opened the batting for Western Australia, and a Medical Practitioner to boot.\n\nCOMMENT: It could be argued that politics was the one life endeavour where Charlesworth did not excel.\n\n- Chris October 13, 2010 at 11:34 PM\n\nRe former umpires - going back a long time but Edmund Barton umpired a number of interstate cricket matches plus NSW's match against the touring English in 1879 which led to cricket's first riot.\n\n- Peter October 14, 2010 at 04:29 PM\n\nSome footballer named Mal announced he would run for a spot as an MLA in the ACT a few years ago...\n\nCOMMENT: Paul Osborne played Rugby League for St George 1986-91 and then the Canberra Raiders 1992-94. In 1995 he was elected to the ACT Legislative Assembly and served until 2001 as a socially conservative Independent.\n\nAt the 2001 election, Osborne convinced his mate and League legend Mal Meninga to run at the ACT election. He made a radio appearance on ABC morning radio to announce he was running, but 28 seconds into his announcement gave up and admitted he just couldn't do it. Probably the world's shortest political career.\n\nOsborne was defeated at the 2001 election. He is now in Rugby League administration as Parramatta Eels CEO.\n\n- Peter October 18, 2010 at 11:46 AM\n\nCome on, what about the girls? Kirstie Marshall, surely, deserves a mention? Former Olympic ariel skier who has held the Melbourne seat of Forest Hill since 2002.\n\nCOMMENT: A number of names additional to my original post are in the coments. I thought I'd leave the additional names with the comments of the people who made them. Kirstie Marshall has already been mentioned.\n\n- Tibia Gold October 18, 2010 at 02:03 PM\n\nAntony, as your site is not up yet, could you answer this question?\n\nIn the Victoria Upper House can parties submit \"above the line\" preference flows which are \"split\" in the way that they are able to in the Federal Senate?\n\nps - best footballer ever while IN parliament - Craig Ingram, independent, who played in a premiership while in Vic lower house.\n\nANSWER: Yes.\n\n- Rocket October 18, 2010 at 02:08 PM\n\nAustralian Democrats' founder Don Chipp played 3 games for Fitzroy in 1947. There is an obvious synergy about the demise of both, but let's not go there.\n\n- Mark Basham October 18, 2010 at 05:10 PM\n\nThank God someone has got their priorities right. Great post Antony.\n\n- Stephen Mills October 19, 2010 at 01:52 PM\n\nYou'd have to add Phil Cleary, former VFA player and indepedent member for Wills in the Federal Parliament 1992-96 - that is, if second-division footballers (and, in my opinion, second-rate politicians) count in this list.\n\nI seem to recall that former Geelong (and North Melbourne) great Doug Wade ran unsuccessfully for the Victorian Parliament in the 1970s. (Seat of Polwarth?)\n\nCOMMENT: If I include Cleary I have to add Scoresby Liberal MP Kim Wells who played VFA footbal..\n\n- Stephen Mills October 19, 2010 at 01:58 PM\n\nNever kicked a ball in anger, but you've GOT to include Uncle Doug .\n\n- Jeff October 19, 2010 at 02:05 PM\n\nA sensational column, Antony. BOG for mine. A pity it doesn't feature the most meteoric conjunction of sport and politics ever: Mal Meninga's quixotic and rather brief run for parliement 10 years ago. The man who busted more tackles than just about anyone folded at The Very First Question in his Very First Interview after announcing his candidacy. 28 seconds of sheer immortality.\n\nCOMMENTL Read the comments, it's all set out there.\n\n- Gervase Greene October 19, 2010 at 04:51 PM"
