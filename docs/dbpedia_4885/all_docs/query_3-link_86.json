A teacher of religion, especially Hindu religious teachers is not just a job assigned to transfer knowledge but also served to instill the values of the teachings of Hinduism to the learners. Hindu religious teachers are professional positions, hence a teacher demanded to carry out their duties professionally. The professionalism of a teacher can be seen from how to run any of the duties is always productive, innovative, efficient and effective and independentTo be a Hindu religious teacher who is able to carry out their duties in a professional manner, the necessary efforts both from its own consciousness and on the government's efforts. In an effort to become a Hindu religious teachers qualified and professional, then a Hindu religious teachers is not enough to just rely on what the government has programmed as with training, workshops, competition research, as well as awards in the form of allowance teacher certification, and seminars, but a Hindu religious teachers are required to understand the teachings of Hinduism as a whole and want to fill themselves with the knowledge and responsiveness to changing times and technological advances. Thus, the material being taught will always correspond with the times and the material can be innovative, efficient and effective in their delivery in the classroom.Finally the success of a teacher of religion in their profession will appear on the character and attitude of the learners who become responsible, religious and good behavior.\n\nREVITALISASI PENDIDIKAN AGAMA HINDU DALAM MENCIPTAKAN BUDAYA RELIGIUS BAGI GENERASI HINDU 2017\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI Nyoman Sueca\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available The problem of education is an issue of human life throughout their life, both as individuals, social groups as well as members of society. A hope for the government and society to the generations of Hindu that schools of Hinduism can be built not only in formal education but through education in formal and non-formal as in the rise and pasraman-pasraman in every Pakraman in Bali, so the creation of a religious culture, the strong one.The phenomenon that occurs in the Hindu generation, where Hindu religious education in the learning process in schools to create a culture of religious solely to meet the cognitive, affective and psychomotor aspects whereas as if ignored, this happens because of the situation of globalization. Build or revitalize Hindu religious education is actually the duty of teachers and parents with instilling religious values to create a religious culture. A religious culture that is based on religion teacher jobs, selfless, is also a method for building one's values in a comprehensively manner.\n\nSome contemporary aspects of Hindu-Christian dialogue\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexandru-Corneliu Arion\n\n2016-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The present paper deals with an important aspect of todayâs interreligious dialogue, that between Christianity and the second largest religion of Asia, namely Hinduism. The concern is centering around not the ancient or traditional links between these two expressions of the Sacred, but rather of the contemporary ones. But that requires certain knowledge of what has already happened. The dialogue comes from the heart of the people, and is situated in the middle of life. Unfortunately, many present-day dialogues set the stage according to the terms of one of the parties alone. But in spite of misunderstandings and difficulties of the Hindu-Christian dialogue, it has an unavoidable effect: it changes our vision and interpretation of our own religion. The main tenets would be: the future of Hindu-Christian dialogue will largely depend on future mutual interest; Hindu-Christian dialogue may be linked to the future development of Hinduism and Christianity; the future of Hindu-Christian dialogue may be endangered by an institutional misunderstanding of its nature; Hindu-Christian dialogue may have to be placed into a larger âsecularâ context; Hindu-Christian dialogue is inevitable. It is an imperative and it must exhibit more continuity.\n\nVaranasi: un processo conflittuale di patrimonializzazione - Varanasi: a conflictual patrimonialization process\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nViola Brancatella\n\n2015-06-01\n\nFull Text Available Varanasi is considered the holy city for excellence by the Hindus. Throughout centuries, the city developed along the river Ganges. Its west riverside, as center of the town, holds together the holy sites, the historical buildings as well as the local communityâs daily activities. Since 2000 the landscape along the river has been involved in a political, juridical and social conflict between a local NGO and a group of business men. The NGO represents the local intelligentsia aiming at a more comprehensive heritage preservation, largely inspired by Westerner heritage philosophy. On the other side, a like financial-driven alliance between local business men and political authorities is leading the construction of touristic accommodations in replace of ancient heritage buildings. The conflict between these two groups is the expression of two opposite perspectives on space, history, memory and culture. By aiming at two different directions, both sides may lead to transform the landscape in an open-air museum, ultimately interrupting the natural identification between local community and territory.\n\nPadma Kant Shukla 1950-2013\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBingham, Robert; Eliasson, Bengt; Mendonca, Tito; Stenflo, Lennart; Stenflo\n\n2013-03-01\n\nProfessor Padma Kant Shukla passed away on the 26th of January in New Delhi, India, just after receiving the prestigious Hind Rattan (Jewel of India) Award.

There is a common travellersâ discourse that sees India as a difficult and dangerous place to a vulnerable traveler, and the encounters of colonial women with âothernessâ have been widely analysed. This article brings this discussion to the post colonial era and endeavors to initiate a discussion about how to understand the encounters between visiting Western women and the locals in India today. The article is based on nine interviews which Korpela conducted in Varanasi, and on her participant observation.\n\nPeningkatan Kompetensi Profesional Dosen Menuju Kualitas Pendidikan Tingi Agama Hindu Dan Sumber Daya Manusia Hindu\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI Ketut Tanu\n\n2018-02-01\n\nFull Text Available The study on increasing lecturer competence is interesting in relation to the dynamics of education and education. Especially in relation to the higher education of Hinduism is also a thing that is still rare to be observed by practitioners of Hindu religious education in particular and education globally in general. With regard to the competence of lecturers in relation to the quality of Hindu religious education the hope is for the realization of the quality of Hindu human resources.An institution of higher education can be said to have quality, depending on many factors. Many components need to be met in accordance with applicable criteria and conditions. Lately there is a tendency that learners have wisely determine which college option is chosen as a place of college. Physically, that magnificent building can be used as a measure. Then there are also choosing the completeness of facilities owned by the college. In addition, it is also seen that the graduates have the best performance in the regional and national scale. All of that is as the hope and desire of each learner to be able to follow his studies at such higher education institutions\n\nPuja: Expressions of Hindu Devotion.

This play remarkably translocates the mythos and ethos of Shakespeareâs original onto a Hindu field of signifiers, reformulating Shakespeareâs Witches as bhairavis (female hermits of a Tantric cult who indulge unchallenged in ghastly rituals. It also tries to associate the gratuitous violence of the play with the fanciful yearning for a martial ideal of nation-building that formed a strand of the Hindu revivalist imaginary. If the depiction of the Witch-figures in Rudrapal undercuts the evocation of a monolithic and urbane Hindu sensibility that would be consistent with colonial modernity, the celebration of their violence may be read as an effort to emphasize the inclusivity (as well as autonomy of the Hindu tradition and to defy the homogenizing expectations of Western enlightenment\n\nModeling Wildfire Hazard in the Western Hindu Kush-Himalayas\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nBylow, D.\n\n2012-12-01\n\nWildfire regimes are a leading driver of global environmental change affecting a diverse array of global ecosystems. Particulates and aerosols produced by wildfires are a primary source of air pollution making the early detection and monitoring of wildfires crucial. The objectives of this study were to model regional wildfire potential and identify environmental, topological, and sociological factors that contribute to the ignition of wildfire events in the Western Hindu Kush-Himalayas of South Asia. The environmental, topological, and sociological factors were used to model regional wildfire potential through multi-criteria evaluation using a method of weighted linear combination. Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and geographic information systems (GIS) data were integrated to analyze regional wildfires and construct the model. Model validation was performed using a holdout cross validation method. The study produced a significant model of wildfire potential in the Western Hindu Kush-Himalayas.; Western Hindu Kush-Himalayas ; Western Hindu Kush-Himalayas Wildfire Potential\n\nThe Influence of Hindu Epistemology on Ranganathan's Colon Classification.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMaurer, Bradley Gerald\n\nThis study attempted to determine the influence of Hindu epistemology on Ranganathan's Colon Classification.

A literature search revealed that, although there is significant literature on each side of the problem, no bridges existâ¦\n\nAdvancing Regional and Transboundary Cooperation in the Conflict-Prone Hindu KushâHimalaya\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nDavid Molden\n\n2017-11-01\n\nFull Text Available The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD supports regional and transboundary cooperation to meet challenges of climate change, disaster risks, and sustainable development in the Hindu KushâHimalaya (HKH. Action to sustain the HKH has the potential to directly improve the lives of more than one fourth of the world's population. However, facilitating cooperation and policy coherence among the countries sharing HKH resources is a persistent challenge in a region that is prone to conflict and is highly variable regarding development. At ICIMOD, we work across HKH countries to help attain common goals related to sustainable development, using our skills in bringing together different groups within programmatic transboundary approaches covering topics such as river basins or transboundary landscapes. In addition, the Hindu Kush Himalayan Monitoring and Assessment Programme and the Himalayan University Consortium have made strides in promoting regional and transboundary cooperation among HKH countries, particularly emphasizing research synthesis and the role of academia.\n\nIschiopagus and diprosopus in India: two pairs of conjoined twins perceived as incarnations of Hindu deities.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nTubbs, R Shane; Ditty, Benjamin; Bosmia, Anand N; Bosmia, Arpan N\n\n2015-02-01\n\nThis article briefly reviews two specific types of conjoined twins, ischiopagus and diprosopus, and discusses recent cases of such twins born in India. Some members of the Hindu community worshiped these conjoined twins as incarnations of Hindu deities. In discussing this phenomenon, the authors aim to elucidate certain features of the faith tradition of Hinduism itself. The reception of these conjoined twins as incarnations of Hindu deities can be understood by examining two salient features of Hindu polytheism: the pictorial depiction of Hindu deities with multiple appendages and the concept of an incarnation, or avatar, of a Hindu deity.\n\nEquality on Different Terms: The Case of Dutch Hindu Schools\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nMerry, Michael S.; Driessen, Geert\n\n2012-01-01\n\nIn this article the authors examine the reasons for the establishment of Hindu schools in the Netherlands and how the Dutch system of education facilitates these and other voluntarily separate schools. In particular, the authors explore the manner in which Hindu schools aim to cultivate and sustain attachments to their own group through aâ¦\n\nEnd-of-life care beliefs among Hindu physicians in the United States.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRamalingam, Vijaya Sivalingam; Saeed, Fahad; Sinnakirouchenan, Ramapriya; Holley, Jean L; Srinivasan, Sinnakirouchenan\n\n2015-02-01\n\nSeveral studies from the United States and Europe showed that physicians' religiosity is associated with their approach to end-of-life care beliefs. No such studies have focused exclusively on Hindu physicians practicing in the United States. A 34-item questionnaire was sent to 293 Hindu physicians in the United States. Most participants believed that their religious beliefs do not influence their practice of medicine and do not interfere with withdrawal of life support. The US practice of discussing end-of-life issues with the patient, rather than primarily with the family, seems to have been adopted by Hindu physicians practicing in the United States. It is likely that the ethical, cultural, and patient-centered environment of US health care has influenced the practice of end-of-life care by Hindu physicians in this country.

Sharpe\n\n1975-01-01\n\nFull Text Available The Hindu Renaissance is commonly regarded as having begun seriously in the 1870's, consequent upon the foundation in 1875 of the Ärya SamÄj in the West of India.' But this is in many ways a date of convenience. The roots of the movement go back, particularly as far as Bengal is concerned, to the time of Rammohun Roy, when on the one hand there was created a serious, though small-scale. Hindu reform movement, and on the other there was introduced into Calcutta the remarkable catalyst of Western education. Hindu reform and Western education were closely linked for the greater part of the nineteenth century. The early Hindu reform movements to a very great extent shared the same characteristics: small-scale and elitist, they were not designed to appeal, and did not appeal, to the masses. The BrÄhma SamÄj, for instance, never succeeded in achieving popularity; it began and continued very largely as a somewhat rarefied worship-society. But the years between 1893 and 1897 were the years of SwÄmi VivekÄnanda's \"mission\" to the World's Parliament of Religions in Chicago and his tours in the countries of the West. Perhaps it was in the figure of the SwÄmi that the Indian national movement found its first powerful human symbol.\n\nThe Essence of Hindu Doctrine and its Influence on Christianity in America and Europe\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAlexandru-Corneliu Arion\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available This paper addresses the topic of the identity of Hindu religion and its impact on Christianity in the West (i.e. in Europe and USA, which is to be seen, especially through Neo-Hindu movements (that occurred mainly during 1950sâ1980s. Thus, features and key terms such as: authority of the Veda, Dharma, moksha, samsÄra and karma, the paths to liberation, concept of God, Brahman-Ätman, avidyÄ and mÄyÄ and AUM are sketchily presented in the first part of the paper. There are obvious differences between both Hindu schools and Christian faith which regards 1. Ultimate concern: For the Hindu, it is escape from the human condition, whereas for the Christian it is freedom from guilt, sin, and the devil; 2. Human nature: For the Christian it is creaturely and sinful; for the Hindu it is divine; 3. Human problem: It is moral sin for the Christian and intellectual ignorance for the Hindu; 4. Resolution: For the Christian it is a divine act at infinite cost to God; for the Hindu it is human effort, sometimes mixed with grace, without cost to the god. In the second part it is presented the debated problem of Gurus and their movements and Neo-Hindu movements sprung at the second half of 20th century, such as Satya Sai Baba, International Society for Krishna Consciousness and meditation for âtranscendental consciousnessâ (TM. In any case, the Indian offspring demonstrate that we have come to an important moment in the history of religions, one in which new religious landscapes continually emerge like the images of a kaleidoscope and where people will have to learn whether it is possible to share the same planet.\n\nAmbient PM2.5 exposure and premature mortality burden in the holy city Varanasi, India\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nJain, Vaishali; Dey, Sagnik; Chowdhury, Sourangsu\n\n2017-01-01\n\nMore than 3 million population residing in the holy city Varanasi and sub-urban areas is exposed to very high level of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) from various sources. Continuous monitoring by Central Pollution Control Board started only in 2015; therefore what was the pollution level in the past and how it has changed over the years are not known. We use MODIS aerosol products to infer PM 2.5 and examine 15-year climatology. Data shows a rapid (1.5â3% per year) increase in PM 2.5 in the last 15 years and high (87% days in a year) persistence of PM 2.5 above the national air quality standard. It translates to a burden of 5700 (2800â7500) annual premature deaths (0.16% of the population), of which 29%, 18%, 33%, 19% and remaining 1% are attributed to ischemic heart disease, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute lower respiratory infection and lung cancer respectively. If the region achieves the Indian (WHO) air quality standard, 1900 (3800) premature deaths can be avoided every year. - Highlights: â¢ MODIS AOD data are used to infer surface PM 2.5 in the holy city Varanasi, India. â¢ PM 2.5 increases rapidly (1.5â3% per year) in the last 15 years. â¢ 87% days in a year, daily PM 2.5 exceeds national standard. â¢ 5700 annual premature death is estimated, of which 1900 can be saved if Indian standard is met. â¢ COPD has the largest share in the burden. - This study presents 15-year ambient PM 2.5 statistics in Varanasi using satellite data (in absence of long-term in-situ data) and the associated premature mortality burden.\n\nA Hindu Perspective to Organizational Learning\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nShama Rao, Ashok; Kamath Burde, Jyothsna\n\n2017-01-01\n\nPurpose: This paper aims to provide an overview of the relevance and applicability of the Hindu tradition to organizational learning.

The background of various ethnic, tribe and religion in Indonesia are often tainted by the conflicts, contradictions, until riots. This makes this paper important to be appointed, where Bali gives a different color in managing the existing heterogeneity. When conflicts on behalf of ethnic, tribe and religion occurred in some areas, Bali remains in control, not affected by the riots. This article at least has the purpose to provide a review of the relation between the life that is built up during the time in Bali, especially between Muslims and Hindus in the perspective of multicultural society. The method used in this study is a qualitative method with descriptive analysis.

If Christian ethic is the ethic of love, love is in the center of Christian moral values, then Hindu ethic is an example of ethic of law.

However forgiveness, self-restraint, non-stealing, purity are common moral obligations for Christians and Hindus.\n\nSADHARANIKARANA, SEBUAH MODEL KOMUNIKASI HINDU: ASPEK-ASPEK DAN FILSAFATNYA\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nIda Bagus Putu Suamba\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Sistem komunikasi Hindu telah dianggap sebagai disiplin baru di bidang teori dan praktik komunikasi. Ini tidak berarti bahwa benih atau gagasan komunikasi tidak ada dalam literatur dan praktiknya sejak periode Veda. Referensi yang diambil dari bidang puisi, estetika, dan drama dalam literatur Sanskerta menunjukkan banyaknya sumber yang bisa dimanfaatkan sebagai sumber utama untuk mengembangkan sistem komunikasi Hindu yang tepat. Sadharanikarakana sebagai teori generalisasi dalam ekspresi puitis dikembangkan menjadi model komunikasi Hindu di era modern. Model terdiri dari beberapa aspek, seperti sahridaya (pihak yang terlibat - pengirim dan penerima, sahridayata (keadaan kesamaan, bhava (mood, abhivyanjana (encoding, sandesha (pesan, sarani (saluran, rasawadana (yang pertama diterima, decoding dan interpretasi pesan dan akhirnya mencapai rasa, dosha (suara, dan pratikriya (umpan balik; mereka menjadi bingkisan dari keseluruhan sistem. Sebagai model komunikasi, setiap pihak terlibat dalam proses komunikasi berusaha mencapai keadaan satu kesatuan, kesamaan, keadaan umum, universalitas yang disebut sahridayata. Dengan keadaan ini, setiap perbedaan dalam berbagai bidang kehidupan dapat dilampaui menjadi saling pengertian karena kesatuan atau kesamaan telah dicapai melalui proses negosiasi makna.

Selain bersifat spiritual, model ini juga nonlinier.\n\nHook whistlers observed at low latitude ground station Varanasi\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKhosa, P.N.; Lalmani; Ahmed, M.M.; Singh, B.D.\n\n1983-01-01\n\nEmploying the Haselgrove ray tracing equations and a diffusive equilibrium model of the ionosphere, the propagation characteristics of hook whistlers recorded at low-latitude ground station Varanasi (geomag. lat., 16 0 6'N) are discussed. It is shown that the two traces of the hook whistlers are caused by the VLF waves radiated from the return stroke of a lightning discharge which after penetrating the ionosphere at two different entry points, propagated to the opposite hemisphere in the whistler mode and were received at 16 geomagnetic latitude. Further the crossing of ray paths for the same frequency leads to the explanation of the hook whistler. The lower and higher cut-off frequencies are explained in terms of their deviating away from the bunch of the recorded whistler waves and crossing of ray paths for the same frequency.

The major concepts of Hinduism that are related to pain and suffering are presented. Ways that Hindu traditions deal with pain and suffering are reviewed, including the concept of acceptance, which has been studied in the pain medicine literature. By becoming more familiar with Hindu views of pain and suffering, pain medicine practitioners can offer potentially helpful concepts to all patients and support Hindus' spirituality as it relates to pain and suffering. Religion or spirituality is often important to patients. This article will inform the pain medicine practitioner how pain and suffering are viewed in Hinduism, the third largest religion in the world. It is hoped that these concepts will prove helpful when treating not only followers of Hinduism but all patients.\n\nPattern Of Adolescent Learning Hindu Scholarship Recruits Through Pasraman Widya Dharma Saraswati\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nI Nyoman Warsana\n\n2017-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Mental development and religious personality is one aspect that needs to get special attention because through it children and adolescents understand the meaning of Religion and its benefits for human life and will later form a person who virtuous noble character.

Some people follow yoga, some focus on meditation and others apply âHasta Chikitsaâ or âMudraâ. They are separate traditional exercises. They require to spend 10 to 30 minutes once or twice a day for their optional exercise/s. It is proved that such practice has productive effect in different health treatments. This paper has applied the methods of observation, interview and literature review as qualitative paradigm in exploring their original roots of Vedic Sandhyopaasan. Twice born castes (Brahman, Chhetri and Baishya of Nepali Hindu society has been found practicing all components of the exercises as a unified ritual of Sandhyopaasan. Upanayan (Bratabandha ritual teaches Sandhyopaasan procedures for self control and self healing of the performers. Brahman is not eligible as Brahman without doing the ritual daily. However, this study has found that some Dalits have also been practicing Sandhyopaasan daily and feeling relaxed. Findings of this study show that Sandhyopaasan is a compact package of yoga, meditations and Hasta Chikitsa. Students and gurus of Vedas have been regularly following the compact package for inner peace and self control. Root of yoga, meditation and âMudraâ is Sandhyopaasan and this is the base of Hindu education system. The paper analyzes the ritual through Hindu educational perspective.\n\nNUTRITIONAL IMPORTANCE DURING MENOPAUSE: A CROSS SECTIONAL STUDY IN URBAN AREA OF DISTRICT VARANASI\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nPooja Verma\n\n2015-12-01\n\nFull Text Available Introduction: - Menopause is a universal reproductive phenomenon.

They strongly discourage all sorts of violence in society including suicide. Religious commitments toward life-saving value are known to prevent suicide attempts since all world religions promote unity, reducing interpersonal hostilities. Therefore, understanding the basics on what religious scriptures narrate on life and death including suicide is essential. This paper highlights the seldom discussed topic on the concept and consequences of suicide portrayed in the ancient Hindu religious scriptures.\n\nHydrogeochemistry for the assessment of groundwater quality in Varanasi: a fast-urbanizing center in Uttar Pradesh, India.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nJanardhana Raju, Nandimandalam; Shukla, U K; Ram, Prahlad\n\n2011-02-01\n\nThe hydrogeochemical parameters for groundwater samples of the Varanasi area, a fast-urbanizing region in India, were studied to evaluate the major ion chemistry, weathering and solute acquisition processes controlling water composition, and suitability of water quality for domestic and irrigation uses. Sixty-eight groundwater samples were collected randomly from dug wells and hand pumps in the urban Varanasi area and analyzed for various chemical parameters. Geologically, the study area comprises Quaternary alluvium made up of an alternating succession of clay, silty clay, and sand deposits. The Total dissolved solids classification reveals that except two locations, the groundwater samples are desirable for drinking, and all are useful for irrigation purposes. The cationic and anionic concentrations indicated that the majority of the groundwater samples belong to the order of Na>Ca>Mg>K and HCO3>Cl>SO4 types, respectively. Geochemical classification of groundwater based on the Chadha rectangular diagram shows that the majority (81%) of groundwater samples belong to the calcium-bicarbonate type. The HCO3/(HCO3+SO4) ratio (0.87) indicates mostly carbonic acid weathering process due to presence of kankar carbonate mixed with clay/fine sand. The high nitrate concentration (>45 mg/l) of about 18% of the groundwater samples may be due to the local domestic sewage, leakage of septic tanks, and improper management of sanitary landfills. In general, the calculated values of sodium adsorption ratio, percent sodium, residual sodium carbonate, and permeability index indicate good to permissible use of water for irrigation, and only a few locations demand remedial measures for better crop yields.\n\nEpidemiology Correlates Of Diarrhoea In A Rural Area Of Varanasi\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nBhattacharya Rita\n\n1989-01-01\n\nFull Text Available Three hundred sixty nine children under six years of age were examined every month by house to house visits in Barain village of Chiraigaon Block, varanasi.

It describes the various fasts observed as part of Hindu religion and offers a classification scheme for them, labeling them as infrequent and frequent. The infrequent fasts are further sub-classified as brief and prolonged, to facilitate a scientific approach to glycemic management during these fasts. Pre-fast counseling, non-pharmacological therapy, pharmacological modification, and post-fast debriefing are discussed in detail. All available drug classes and molecules are covered in this article, which provides guidance about necessary changes in dosage and timing of administration. While in no way exhaustive, the brief review offers a basic framework which diabetes care professionals can use to counsel and manage persons in their care who wish to observe various Hindu fasts.\n\nMaking the Pitrubhumi: Masculine Hegomony and the Formation of the Hindu Nation\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nP.K.

Regarding India, it would be better to speak of âequidistanceâ between State and religious denominations. Nonetheless a âbalanced treatmentâ towards the religions leaves the question open as to what form that equidistance should take. This is the reason of some contradictions in todayâs Indian social and political life. It is likely that without the Moghul and British domination Hinduism would not have acquired a militant identity. It was the âepiphanyâ of well-armed, powerful âOthersâ (Muslim, Christian or secular which generated frustration and fear to such an extent that a religious nationalism (Hindutva was born. Nehru and the Left of the Congress Party leadership thought that modernity would overcome religion, which is a remnant of the past. They were confident that a political culture based on pluralism and tolerance would become the foundations of the new society. This is exactly what Hindu Nationalism takes issue with: the âpseudo-secularsâ project of building the national identity without Hinduism or against Hinduism. Hindutva asserts that Hinduism is the basis of the Indian civilization. The Hindu ethos is the soul of the nation.\n\nEducation for a Sustainable Future: Strategies of the New Hindu Religious Movements\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMartin Haigh\n\n2010-11-01\n\nFull Text Available Increasingly, sustainability is conceived as a crisis of the human mind and the key challenge for pro-sustainability education is developing sufficient motivation in learners. The spiritual aspirations of religious communities contain sufficient motivational force, which may be deployed for effective sustainability education. This paper explores the approaches to sustainability and sustainability education of some internationally-oriented Hindu religious movements. These include the rural education initiatives of Gandhian Sarvodaya, which emphasizes non-harming, self-reliance and personal ethics, ISKCON, which emphasizes devotional service, P.R. Sarkarâs Ananda Marg, which emphasizes cooperative enterprise, the Tantric body re-imagined at the social scale, and Swami Vivekanandaâs Sri Ramakrishna Order, which emphasizes karma yoga, spiritual development through service to the God in each human. It also describes the British Hindu contribution to the UNDP/ARCâs multi-faith sustainability initiative âMany Heavens, One Earthâ; which is the âBhumi Projectâ and its two main campaigns, Green Temples and Compassionate Living.\n\nUnearthing Nusantaraâs Concept of Religious Pluralism: Harmonization and Syncretism in Hindu-Buddhist and Islamic Classical Texts\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nAl Makin\n\n2016-06-01\n\n[Artikel ini mencoba menemukan rumusan pluralisme dengan membaca ulang teks klasik Jawa dengan memilih bagian tertentu dari sastra Hindu-Buddha yang disebut kakawin dan karya Islami yang disebut serat dan babad.

The article is based on our in-depth interviews with 26 Hindu and Muslim young women attending colleges in urban Bengaluru (formerly Bangalore), south India, and explores the barriers they confronted in fulfilling their aspirations. We highlight the similarities amongst the young women, as well as the distinctive experiences of the Hindu and Muslim interviewees. Financial constraints, lack of safety for women in public space, and gender bias, gossip and social control within the family and the local community affected Hindu and Muslim interviewees in substantially similar ways. For the Muslim interviewees, however, gender disadvantage was compounded by their minority status. This both underlines the importance of incorporating communal politics into our analysis and undermines popular discourses that stereotype Muslims in India as averse to girls' and young women's education.\n\nModernity and its Discontents: Western Catholic Pioneers of the Hindu-Christian Dialogue\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nEnrico Beltramini\n\n2013-06-01\n\nFull Text Available This article presents a reassessment of the Hindu-Christian dialogue in its relationship with modernity. The focus is on a group of Western Catholic clergymen who relocated to India, specifically during 1940-70, and became involved in the Hindu-Christian dialogue. The article traces the reasons for these Catholicsâ relocations to their dissatisfaction with modernity and the predominance of rationality in the West, as well as their aversion to modern scientific thought. It emphasises the dual character of the interfaith dialogue, and the struggles of this group of clergymen to overcome modernity, whereby a modernÂ Weltanschauung was the obstacle along the path to reshaping Catholic theology and establishing a fruitful interfaith dialogue with Hinduism.Â Although they did not pursue a common agenda and had different goals, these pioneers of interfaith dialogue came to consider such a dialogue with Hinduism as regenerative, as a means of revitalising Western thought, of balancing the modern excesses of a Western civilisation increasingly dominated by technology, and of transcending the rationalised culture of the modern West to achieve higher consciousness.\n\nFood and nutrition security in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRasul, Golam; Hussain, Abid; Mahapatra, Bidhubhusan; Dangol, Narendra\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe status of food and nutrition security and its underlying factors in the Hindu-Kush Himalayan (HKH) region is investigated.

In the present study, two Asian countries, Japan and Singapore, were chosen. The participation rate for physical activities among adolescent girls tends to be lower than that of boys in both countries. Thus, the purpose of the project was to gain knowledge and understanding about sociocultural factors that may explain adolescent girls' perceptions and behaviors toward sport, physical activity, and physical education (PE). A qualitative approach using semi-structured interviews with focus groups was used to understand meanings of physical activity among Buddhist Japanese, and Hindu Indians and Christian Chinese from Singapore. Each focus group consisted of four or five girls and female researchers. Based on the analysis, we created four themes which were \"cultural identities,\" \"Asian girls and sport/physical activities,\" \"PE experiences,\" \"motivation for future involvement.\" The Buddhist Japanese, Hindu Indian, and Christian Chinese participants each reported unique physical activity experiences, and all the participants were aware of how Asian culture may affect being physically active. Experiences of PE classes were similar but perceptions of their PE attire were different for Christian Chinese and Hindu Indian adolescent girls. Based on the results, the importance of nurturing cultural competencies and ways to encourage girls to be physically active throughout life were discussed.\n\nAn assessment of basin-scale glaciological and hydrological sensitivities in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nShea, Joseph M.; Immerzeel, Walter W.\n\n2016-01-01\n\nGlacier responses to future climate change will affect hydrology at sub-basin scales.

Lombok is known as the island of thousand mosques where majestic mosques scatter throughout the island. But Lombok is also a home for Hindus. The interactions between them have been very dynamics, creating integration, acculturation, adaptation, accommodation while sometimes also triggering tension. This article argues that theology occupies important aspects in both Hindu and Muslim daily live and thus can be employed as the solid basis of interreligious relations between them. From the Islamic perspective, there are a number of Qurâanic verse injuctions for tolerance. Hindus are also required to maintain tolerant attitude towards other religions as this is commanded in the Veda. These theological grounds will strengthen from the faith point of view Hindu-Muslim social cohesion, which has so far been realized though various means, such as music, arts and religious festivals.\n\nWhatâs in a name? An enquiry about the interpretation of Agama Hindu as âHinduismâ\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nMichel Picard\n\n2011-10-01\n\nFull Text Available Abstract In this article, I question the conceptual categories ofâreligionâ, âagamaâ, âdharmaâ, and âHinduismâ, in orderto investigate through which processes and within whichcontexts the Balinese religion resulted in being construedas agama Hindu. After having investigated how theSanskrit loanword agama came to designate in Indonesiaan Islamic conception of what âreligionâ is about, I assessthe similarities between the construction of Indian Neo-Hinduism and the interpretation of the Balinese religion asagama Hindu. In particular, I pay attention to the controversywhich has been dividing the Balinese intelligentsia overthe proper name of their religion, as it reveals a perennialconflict between the Balinese who want to retain thespecificity of their customary ritual practices, and thosewho aspire to reform the Balinese religion by conformingit to what they think Hinduism is about.\n\nDrug delivery approaches for breast cancer\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nSingh SK\n\n2017-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Santosh Kumar Singh,1 Shriti Singh,2 James W Lillard Jr,1 Rajesh Singh1 1Department of Microbiology, Biochemistry and Immunology, Morehouse School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, USA; 2Department of Kriya Sharir, Institute of Medical Sciences, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi, India Abstract: Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers affecting women worldwide. The controlled release of drugs to the precise site of the disease using a nanocarrier vehicle increases the therapeutic efficiency of the drugs. Nanotechnology-based approaches used to endorse clinical improvement from a disease also help to understand the interaction of malignant cells with their microenvironment. Receptor-based targeting is another approach for drug delivery which is undergoing clinical trials. Nanoparticles (NPs delivery has been proven to promise high loading capacity, less toxicity, and stability of the drugs or biomolecules compared to traditional chemotherapeutic drugs. The goal of this review is to present the current problems of breast cancer therapy and discuss the NP-based targeting to overcome the hurdles of conventional drug therapy approach.

However, little is known about migration rates in these populations or the extent to which migration occurs between caste groups of low, middle, and high social status. To investigate these aspects of migration, we analyzed the largest collection of genetic markers collected to date in Hindu caste populations. These data included 45 newly typed autosomal short tandem repeat polymorphisms (STRPs), 411 bp of mitochondrial DNA sequence, and 43 Y-chromosomal single-nucleotide polymorphisms that were assayed in more than 200 individuals of known caste status sampled in Andrah Pradesh, in South India. Application of recently developed likelihood-based analyses to this dataset enabled us to obtain genetically derived estimates of intercaste migration rates. STRPs indicated migration rates of 1-2% per generation between high-, middle-, and low-status caste groups. We also found support for the hypothesis that rates of gene flow differ between maternally and paternally inherited genes. Migration rates were substantially higher in maternally than in paternally inherited markers. In addition, while prevailing patterns of migration involved movement between castes of similar rank, paternally inherited markers in the low-status castes were most likely to move into high-status castes. Our findings support earlier evidence that the caste system has been a significant, long-term source of population structuring in South Indian Hindu populations, and that patterns of migration differ between males and females.

This study develops a kinematic model based on active faulting in this part of the Trans-Himalayan orogenic belt. Previous studies have described north-verging thrust faults and some strike-slip faults, reflected in the northward-convex geomorphologic and structural grain of the Pamir Mountains. However, this structural analysis suggests that contemporary tectonics are changing the style of deformation from north-verging thrusts formed during the initial contraction of the Himalayan orogeny to south-verging thrusts and a series of northwest-trending, dextral strike-slip faults in the modern transpressional regime. These northwest-trending fault zones are linked to the major right-lateral Karakoram fault, located to the east, as synthetic, conjugate shears that form a right-stepping en echelon pattern. Northwest-trending lineaments with dextral displacements extend continuously westward across the Hindu Kush-Pamir region indicating a pattern of systematic shearing of multiple blocks to the northwest as the deformation effects from Indian plate collision expands to the north-northwest. Locally, east-northeast- and northwest-trending faults display sinistral and dextral displacement, respectively, yielding conjugate shear pairs developed in a northwest-southeast compressional stress field. Geodetic measurements and focal mechanisms from historical seismicity support these surficial, tectono-morphic observations. The conjugate shear pairs may be structurally linked subsidiary faults and co-seismically slip during single large magnitude (> M7) earthquakes that occur on major south-verging thrust faults. This kinematic model provides a potential context for prehistoric, historic, and future patterns of faulting and earthquakes.\n\nThe effect of geomagnetic storm on GPS derived total electron content (TEC) at Varanasi, India\n\nInternational Nuclear Information System (INIS)\n\nKumar, Sanjay; Singh, A K\n\n2010-01-01\n\nIn this paper we studied the effect of geomagnetic storm on Global Positioning System (GPS) derived total electron content (TEC) at low latitude Varanasi (Geomagnetic lat 14 0 , 55' N, geomagnetic long 154 0 E) during the period of May 2007 to April 2008. During this period 2 storms were found, which were occurred on 20 November 2007 and 9 March 2008. In this study vertical total electron content (VTEC) of single Pseudorandom Noise (PRN) and average of VTEC of same PRN before 10 days of storm, which is called background TEC, were used to see the effect of these storms on the variation of TEC. From this study this is found that during the storm of March 2008 the TEC increases in main phase of storm while in the case of November 2007 storm, TEC decreases during the main phase of storm but increases in the recovery phase (next day) of storm.\n\nAssessment of Change of Knowledge Through on the Job Training of Health Workers (Female in Varanasi\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nV K Gupta\n\n1987-04-01\n\nFull Text Available Health care infrastructure of our country lacks in effective, bulitin system of on the job training or continuing education for different level of workers.

Subduction as a primary way to accommodate lithospheric shortening beneath the Pamir has induced the intermediate-depth seismicity, which is rare in Tibet. Here we construct a 3D S-wave velocity model of the lithosphere beneath the Pamir by surface wave tomography using data of the TIPAGE (Tien Shan-Pamir Geodynamic program) and other seismic networks in the area. We imaged a large-scale low velocity anomaly in the crust at 20-50 km depth in the Pamir overlain by a high velocity anomaly at a depth shallower than 15 km. The high velocity anomalies colocate with exposed gneiss domes, which may imply a similar history of crustal deformation, partial melting and exhumation in the hinterland, as has occurred in the Himalaya/Tibet system. At mantle depths, where the intermediate-depth earthquakes are located, a low velocity zone is clearly observed extending to about 180 km and 150 km depth in the Hindu Kush and eastern Pamir, respectively. Moreover, the geometry of the low-velocity anomaly suggests that lower crustal material has been pulled down into the mantle by the subducting Asian and Indian lithospheric mantle beneath the Pamir and Hindu Kush, respectively. Metamorphic processes in the subducting lower crust may cause the intermediate-depth seismicity down to 150-180 km depth beneath the Pamir and Hindu Kush. We inverted focal mechanisms in the seismic zone for the stress field. Differences in the stress field between the upper and lower parts of the Indian slab imply that subduction and detachment of the Indian lithosphere might cause intense seismicity associated with the thermal shear instability in the deep Hindu Kush.\n\nAJARAN AGAMA HINDU DALAM PENINGKATAN KERUKUNAN RUMAH TANGGA MENUJU KEHARMONISAN HIDUP\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nNi Wayan Gateri\n\n2016-08-01\n\nFull Text Available Harmony is a dream for every household that are nurtured with love, compassion, and sincerity.Â In improving household harmony Â a grounding Hindu religion as guidance is needed.

Articulating a deep rooted inferiority complex, they have tried hard to denounce the disrespectful behaviour of the minorities they feared most â especially the Muslims â in order to mobilize new followers. Such a process was likely to trigger riots and to polarise society along communal lines â and eventually to translate into votes. However, a purely instrumentalist interpretation of the Hindu nationalist use of outrage would be too simplistic. The use of sacred symbols is not that easy, as evident from the case of the Ram Setu movement. It shows that the Sangh Parivar finds it more difficult to mobilize followers when the culprits are not Muslims. It also shows that the exploitation of the outrage is more complicated when its instigators are born Hindus.Â In any case, the holy character of the outraged symbol is not enough: it has to be historical; and it has to be useful too.\n\nDivine Intersections: Hindu Ritual and the Incorporation of Religious Others\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nKathinka FrÃ¸ystad\n\n2012-08-01\n\nFull Text Available This article throws the study of multireligious sociality in Western contexts into sharp relief by examining the case of India. Much of the current scholarship of cosmopolitanism and multiculturalism tends to assume that religious beliefs, practices and spaces make the respective religious communities close entirely in upon themselves. While this assumption may hold true for most of the Western settings we study, it does not necessarily give an accurate description of the conditions for multireligious sociality in other parts of the world. In India, for instance, religious boundaries still display signs of malleability despite the religious politicization and occasional interreligious violence of the past decades. Drawing on recent anthropological research, this article shows that people of different religious denominations still visit Sufi shrines, that Hindus still incorporate ritual elements and divine beings from the religious traditions of their Others and that they exercise a wide personal choice in terms of spiritual activities, thus enabling spiritual paths that cross in and out of Hinduism. In a Hindu context rituals do not necessarily have an insulating effect; they may also provide points of intersection that open up toward the Other, thus fostering familiarity and recognition. Similar arguments have been made for Buddhist settings. The question is thus whether the current scholarship of cosmopolitanism may entail a certain monotheistic bias that needs to accounted for, something that is of particular importance when theorizing in ways that make universal claims.\n\nSeismic Tomography of the Northwest Himalayas, Western Syntaxis and Pamir-Hindu Kush Region: Implications for Underlying Geodynamics\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nRaoof, J.; Mukhopadhyay, S.\n\n2017-12-01\n\nTravel time tomography of the study region using regional as well as local earthquake data illuminate a very heterogeneous structure of this geologically and tectonically complex region. The tomographic image is well resolved up to 150 km depth in the Western Himalayas and up to 300 km depth in the Pamir and Hindu Kush region. The top low velocity anomaly imaged up to 80 km depth correlates well with the thicker crust with deeper low density roots under the high mountains in the northwest Himalayas as well as in the Pamir and Hindu Kush region. Average crustal thickness increases from south to north in the Himalayas as well as along the tectonic trend of the Himalayas. This might be an effect of first collision between Indian and Eurasian plates in the NW and then subsequent anticlockwise rotation of Indian plate, leading to crumpling of the crust. This could also be due to variable thickness of more rigid portion of the incoming crust of Indian plate. The Indian lithospheric slab is imaged as a gently underthrusting high velocity anomaly under the northwest Himalayas and subducted Indian lithospheric slab which follows the trend of intermediate depth seismicity under the Pamir and Hindu Kush region. On the other hand beneath the Pamir-Tien Shan the dipping high velocity anomaly which follows the trend of intermediate depth seismicity, represents the remnant of the southward subducted Asian slab. In the southwest of Hindu Kush the Indian lithospheric slab rolls over and overturns at a depth of 250 km and dips southward. The Delhi-Haridwar Ridge (DHR) and Salt Ranges orthogonal to the strike of the Himalayas are well imaged as high velocity structures. The DHR is butting against the northwest Himalayas that led to ramming and locally buckling of the crust below the Higher Himalayas just NE of DHR. Seismicity pattern follows this trend of the crust. It shows for the first time the effect of ramming of the Himalayas by DHR and most importantly how the Indian plate\n\nPaola Bacchetta, Gender in the Hindu Nation.

Health problem is a major concern in all over the world but especially in developing countries. Non-communicable diseases ( NCDs contribute the ill health. Diabetes, coronary heart disease, various forms of cancer, gastro intestinal disorder and various diseases of bones and joints are diet related NCDs. Nutritional counselling is one of the effective tools of changing the food habits of people. The data for this study is taken from the out patients services of Department of Endocrinology & Metabolism and Cardiology of Sir Sunder Lal Hospital, Banaras Hindu University, Varanasi-5. Total 250 samples were included in the study. Age group 40 â 60 years were considered as study samples who attended the Endocrinology and Cardiology departments. Purposive sampling method was used in the study. Questionnaire cum interview method was adopted in the study. Anthropametric measurements were taken by using standard techniques. 24 hours diet recall method was also used in this study. Evaluation of councelling was done on basis of changes in BMI and nutrient intake. Result shows the positive impact of nutritional counselling in BMI and nutrient intake of NCD patients.\n\nAbundant aftershock sequence of the 2015 Mw7.5 Hindu Kush intermediate-depth earthquake\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nLi, Chenyu; Peng, Zhigang; Yao, Dongdong; Guo, Hao; Zhan, Zhongwen; Zhang, Haijiang\n\n2018-05-01\n\nThe 2015 Mw7.5 Hindu Kush earthquake occurred at a depth of 213 km beneath the Hindu Kush region of Afghanistan. While many early aftershocks were missing from the global earthquake catalogues, this sequence was recorded continuously by eight broad-band stations within 500 km. Here we use a waveform matching technique to systematically detect earthquakes around the main shock. More than 3000 events are detected within 35 d after the main shock, as compared with 42 listed in the Advanced National Seismic System catalogue (or 196 in the International Seismological Centre catalogue). The aftershock sequence generally follows the Omori's law with a decay constant p = 0.92. We also apply the recently developed double-pair double-difference technique to relocate all detected aftershocks. Most of them are located to the west of the hypocentre of the main shock, consistent with the westward propagation of the main-shock rupture. The aftershocks outline a nearly vertical southward dipping plane, which matches well with one of the nodal planes of the main shock. We conclude that the aftershock sequence of this intermediate-depth earthquake shares many similarities with those for shallow earthquakes and infer that there are some common mechanisms responsible for shallow and intermediate-depth earthquakes.\n\nAssessment of permafrost distribution maps in the Hindu Kush Himalayan region using rock glaciers mapped in Google Earth\n\nNARCIS (Netherlands)\n\nSchmid, M.O.; Baral, P.; Gruber, S.; Shahi, S.; Shrestha, T.; Stumm, D.; Wester, P.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nThe extent and distribution of permafrost in the mountainous parts of the Hindu Kush Himalayan (HKH) region are largely unknown.

The pH of rainwater varied between 6.3 and 7.9, with over 70% of samples having alkaline range. Volume weighed mean concentration of ions indicated Ca2+ (11.62- 41.60 microeq l(-1)) to be the most dominant species followed by SO4(2-) (4.7-25.2 microeq I(-1)), Na+ (1.60-10.25 microeq l(-1)), Mg2+ (0.22-7.21 microeq I(-1)), (NO3(-) (0.73-4.02 microeq l(-1)), K+(0.50-3.70 microeq l(-1)) and PO4(3-) (0.02-0.97 microeq l(-1)) respectively. Among the heavy metals, Cr (12.60 to 44.60 microg l(-1)), Zn (4.25 to 34.55 microg l(-1)) and Mn (10.62 to 28.40 microg l(-1)) were found to be the dominant component of rain water. The varimax rotation of PCA results extracted four major factors namely urban-industrial emission, crustal aerosols, wind transport and biomass burning accounting for 80% of the total variance.

Recent research revealed that this condition is perhaps well known for centuries before him. This article is intended to examine if ancient Hindu surgeons knew about congenital megacolon. Sushruta Samhita is an ancient tome of Ayurvedic surgery compiled by Sushruta (circa 1200-600 bc). Passages of interest were identified by browsing the authentic English translation of the compendium. Accuracy of translation was verified by comparing to the original Sanskrit verses with the help of a Sanskrit scholar. A condition called Baddha Gudodaram, described in the Samhita, closely resembles Hirschsprung disease. There are indications that ancient Indians even deciphered the etiology as defective vayu alias vata (nerves). Although the ailment was considered incurable, a palliative operation has been discussed. Descriptive details of the operation match with that of sigmoid colostomy. Evidence from Sushruta Samhita indicates that Hindu surgeons of prehistoric India probably had considerable knowledge about Hirschsprung disease. Further research, corroborating other sources of evidence, is required to confirm this claim. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Inc.

We also extended the previous studies by using Vector Autoregressive (VAR) and Threshold Vector Autoregressive (TVAR) models and compared their forecasting accuracy with linear AR model. Unlike previous studies that typically consider the threshold model specifications by using internal threshold variable, we specified these models with external transition variables and compared their out-of-sample forecasting performance with the linear benchmark AR model. The modeling results show that time series models used in the present study are capable of capturing the dynamic structure present in the seismic data. The point forecast results indicate that the AR model generally outperforms the nonlinear models. However, in some cases, threshold models with external threshold variables specification produce more accurate forecasts, indicating that specification of threshold time series models is of crucial importance. For raw seismic data, the ACD model does not show an improved out-of-sample forecasting performance over the linear AR model. The results indicate that the AR model is the best forecasting device to model and forecast the raw seismic data of the Hindu Kush region.\n\nA Positive Psychology Intervention in a Hindu Community: The Pilot Study of the Hero Lab Curriculum.\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nSundar, Siddhi; Qureshi, Adil; Galiatsatos, Panagis\n\n2016-12-01\n\nIndia has high rates of mental health issues among its youth and low-income communities experience a disproportionate amount of depression and suicide. Positive psychology, the act of promoting well-being, could be used as a tool to promote wellness and help improve the mental health of youth living in slum areas of India. A pilot positively psychology program, \"The Hero Lab\", was conducted in a migratory slum in Worli, Mumbai, with trained Hindu community leaders implementing the interventions toward at-risk Hindu youth.

The objectives of this study were to estimate the prevalence of multidrug-resistant MRSA strains in clinical specimens and to investigate the sensitivity pattern of these strains against various antibiotics used for treating hospitalized and out patients. Strains were identified using standard procedures, and their sensitivity pattern was investigated using such techniques as disc diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC, and the mecA gene PCR. Among 783 isolates of S. aureus, 301 (38.44% were methicillin-resistant, of which 217 (72.1% were found to be multidrug-resistant. Almost all MRSA strains were resistant to penicillin, 95.68% were resistant to cotrimoxazole, 92.36% were resistant to chloramphenicol, 90.7% were resistant to norfloxacin, 76.1% were resistant to tetracycline, and 75.75% were resistant to ciprofloxacin. Vancomycin was the most effective drug, with only 0.33% of MRSA strains being resistant to it. It is concluded that antibiotics other than vancomycin can be used as anti-MRSA agents after a sensitivity test so as to preclude the emergence of resistance to it and that prevailing problems in chemotherapy will escalate unless indiscriminate and irrational usage of antibiotics is checked.Keywords: multidrug-resistant MRSA, prevalence, India\n\nDevaki syndrome: a culture-bound psychological reaction in Indian Hindu women in response to repeated pregnancy loss?\n\nScience.gov (United States)\n\nNath, Kamal; Bhattacharya, Arnab; Sinha, Prakriti; Praharaj, Samir Kumar\n\n2015-02-01\n\nDepression and anxiety are observed in pregnant women with previous foetal loss due to spontaneous abortions.

With this background a school based cross sectional study was conducted to assess the nutritional status of school going children in a rural area: Chiraigaon block of Varanasi. Study period: July 2010 to September 2010 Methods: A school-based study with cross-sectional design was adopted. A total of 1448 school children were examined from 3 middle-schools that were selected by simple random sampling method. Height and weight of the children were measured, and BMI and other parameters were assessed. Results: On applying the BMI-for-age criteria, twelve percent of the children (12.4% boys and 11.1% girls were found underweight while 5.4% were overweight or obese (5.71% of the boys and 4.63% of the girls. But when the previous WHOâs BMI classification was used, 86.5% children had BMI <18.5 (88.4% of total boys and 81.9% of all girls. Conclusion: Nutritional status of school going children based on WHO criteria of BMI for age has been satisfactory. However, this approach needs scientific validation by undertaking a multi-centric study.\n\nThe concept of âtranscendenceâ in modern Western philosophy and in twentieth century Hindu thought\n\nDirectory of Open Access Journals (Sweden)\n\nFerdinando SARDELLA\n\n2016-06-01\n\nFull Text Available âTranscendenceâ has been a key subject of Western philosophy of religion and history of ideas. The meaning of transcendence, however, has changed over time. The article looks at some perspectives offered by the nineteenth and the twentieth century AngloâAmerican and continental European philosophers of religion and presents their views in relation to the concept of transcendence formulated by the Bengali Hindu traditionalist Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati (1874â1937. The questions raised are what transcendence in the philosophy of religion is, how one can speak of it, and what its goal is. The paper points to parallels and differences in epistemology, ontology and practice. One difference is that the nineteenth and the twentieth century Western philosophy of religion tended to assume an ontological difference between self and transcendence inherited from personalities such as SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard, but also to explore the concept of transcendence beyond the idea of a metaphysical God. Bhaktisiddhanta, whose foundational thought mirrors medieval Hindu philo"
