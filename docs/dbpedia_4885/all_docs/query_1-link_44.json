        "text": "Now, don’t tell me I’m the only person who pores over pictures of other people’s libraries, focussing the picture to almost pixel level to try to work out just what that is on the shelf? Celebrity or not, I am fascinated – even if most celebrity’s over-the-shoulder shelves are depressingly dull. So, imagine my delight when I came across some pictures of one of my favourite directors’ shelves, none other than John Waters, best known for his downright filthy and off-kilter gems such as ‘Pink Flamingos’, ‘Hairspray’ (the original, non-musical), ‘Serial Mom’ and, my favourite, ‘Female Trouble’. If you’ve never heard of Waters or seen any of his films, just consider that they contain, in no particular order: the filthiest people alive, cannibalism, incest, drag queens getting high on liquid eye-liner, serial killers, teenage delinquents and girl gangs – all spliced together with a droll and black sense of humour.\n\nWater’s writing is something special too, carrying with it his trademark filthy wink and serious obsessions, one of which is books, which he wrote about in ‘Bookworm’, one of the pieces in his ‘Role Models’ collection. In this piece he waxes lyrical about his favourite books and writers, picking out for particular favour the queerness of Denton Welch’s ‘In Youth in Pleasure’. ‘No better novel‘ he describes it, this 1945 novel being ‘so precious, so beyond gay, so deliciously subversive, (it) is enough to make illiteracy a worse social crime than hunger‘. ‘ Have the secret yearnings of childhood sexuality and the wild excitement of the first stirrings of perversity ever been so eloquently described as in this novel?’.:\n\n‘He put the stick to his nose and smelt it. He thought of crystalized violets coated with bright mauve sugar, and of European-made Turkish Delight dyed pink. ‘It’s very cheap lip-stick’, he thought. Orvil went over to the glass, wound up the stick, and then began to cover his lips with a think layer of colour. Son they were gloriously cerise and sticky-looking…He put two large circles of red on his cheeks and made himself into a Dutch doll., He frizzed his hair until he looked rather pretty and depraved…when he had undressed, he absent-mindedly rouged his nipples until they were like two squashed strawberries. He looked down at them vaguely and then began to rouge all the extremities of his body…He put down the lipstick, lifted his arms above his head and started to sway and twist. He shut his eyes. It was the beginning of a dance. He kicked his legs fiercely, crouched down, and then sprang into the air. He did this several times, till the floor trembled. Such an excitement possessed him that he shouted and sang and tried to leap on to the mantelpiece.’\n\nI wouldn’t know about that as I never managed to get further than a few pages into this strange novel. Ivy Compton-Burnett he describes as looking ‘exactly like the illustration on the Old Maid card, never had sex even once and wrote twenty dark, hilarious, evil little novels between the years 1911 and 1969’ If that doesn’t make you want to read one of Compton-Burnett peculiar little novels, nothing will\n\nAt the time of writing that article, Waters claimed to have 8,425 books on his shelves, some of which are displayed below:\n\n…and my partner thinks my book collecting is out of hand! I’ve tried – oh! how I’ve tried – to magnify these shelves to very little avail. However, what I do know is Mr. Waters list of favourite books and here it is: some (in bold) I have read, others a little more esoteric..\n\nMy Prizes: An Accounting by Thomas Bernhard (Author), Carol Janeway (Translator)\n\nTwo Serious Ladies by Jane Bowles\n\nThe Great Deluge: Hurricane Katrina, New Orleans, and the Mississippi Gulf Coast by Douglas Brinkley\n\nDarkness and Day by Ivy Compton-Burnett\n\nThe Sluts by Dennis Cooper\n\nThe Naked Civil Servant by Quentin Crisp\n\nThe Ravishing of Lol Stein by Marguerite Duras (Author), Richard Seaver (Translator)\n\nMiddlesex by Jeffrey Eugenides\n\nConsider the Oyster by M.

Frasier\n\nJernigan by David Gates\n\nWe Disappear by Scott Heim\n\nSerious Pleasures: The Life of Stephen Tennant by Philip Hoare\n\nThe End of Alice by A.M. Homes\n\nPlatform by Michel Houellebecq and Frank Wynne\n\nThe Possibility of an Island by Michel Houellebecq (Author), Gavin Bowd (Translator)\n\nThe Kindly Ones by Jonathan Littell translated by Charlotte Mandell\n\nThe Beard: A Play by Michael McClure\n\nTime Remaining by James McCourt\n\nThe Ghastly One: The Sex-Gore Netherworld of Filmmaker Andy Milligan by Jimmy McDonough\n\nSita by Kate Millett\n\nInferno (A Poet’s Novel) by Eileen Myles\n\nNarrow Rooms by James Purdy\n\nGood Morning, Midnight by Jean Rhys\n\nAmerican Pastoral by Philip Roth\n\nPol Pot: Anatomy of a Nightmare by Philip Short\n\nSo Much for That by Lionel Shriver\n\nWe Need to Talk about Kevin by Lionel Shriver\n\nAnd I Don’t Want to Live This Life: A Mother’s Story of Her Daughter’s Murder by Deborah Spungen\n\nThe Man Who Loved Children by Christina Stead\n\nLadder of Years by Anne Tyler\n\nGenet: A Biography by Edmund White\n\nStill Holding: A Novel of Hollywood by Bruce Wagner\n\nThe Assistant by Robert Walser (Author), Susan Bernofsky (Translator)\n\nIn Youth Is Pleasure by Denton Welch\n\nVoss by Patrick White\n\nSwimming Underground by Mary Woronov\n\nStrangely, one book I expected to see in this list is ‘A Confederacy of Dunces’ by John Kennedy Toole. A wonderful, funny novel which is chock-a-block full of characters, situations and dialogue which could so easily have been lifted from any of Waters’ films…and I remember reading that Waters considered it to be the only adaptation he would consider making. If you know any of Water’s films read the extract below and you’ll easily imagine the wonderful Mink Stole delivering Ignatious’ lines.\n\n‘Oh good heavens!’, Ignatius shouted, unable to contain himself any longer. Popcorn spilled down his shirt and gathered in the folds of his trousers. ‘What degenerate produced this abortion?’\n\n‘Shut up,’ someone said behind him.\n\n‘Just look at those smiling morons! If only all of those wires would snap!’ Ignatius rattled the few few kernels of corn in his last bag. ‘Thank god that scene is over.‘\n\nWhen a love scene appeared to be developing, he bounded up out of his seat and stomped up the aisle to the candy counter for more popcorn, but as he returned to his seat, the two big pink figures were preparing to kiss.\n\n‘They probably have halitosis,’ Ignatius announced over the heads of the children. ‘I hate to think of the obscene places those mouths have doubtlessly been before‘\n\nOne book I have noticed and which I own but haven’t yet delved into is ‘The Kindly Ones’ by Jonathan Littell – maybe I am missing out on something great? A novel about Nazi Germany recommended by John Waters? I’m picking up vibes of Visconti’s sick, decadent masterpiece ‘The Damned’ (1972) – and that’s no bad thing.\n\nAnd, as I mentioned earlier, Mr. Waters is a fantastic writer himself – his books are witty, scabious, unsavoury and laugh-out-loud funny. If you are interested in his career, try ‘Shock Value’ on his early years, ‘Mr. Know It All’ for the later. His book of essays ‘Role Models’ touches on the things he loves, as does an earlier collection, ‘Crackpot’:\n\n‘By December I’m deep in my Xmas psychosis, and only then do I allow myself the luxury of daydreaming my favourite childhood memory: dashing through the snow, laughing all the way (ha-ha-ha) to Grandma’s house to find that the fully decorated tree has fallen over and pinned her underneath. My candy-coloured memories are run through the projector of my mind so many times that they are almost in 3-D. That awful pause before my parents rushed to free her, my own stunned silence as I dared not ask if Granny’s gifts to us had been damaged, and the wondrous, glorious sight of the now semi-crooked tree, with balls broken, being begrudgingly hoisted back to its proper position of adoration. ‘O Christmas tree! O Christmas tree!’ I started shrieking at the top of my lungs in an insane fit of childhood hyperventilation before being silenced by a glare from my parents that could have stopped a train. This tableau was never mentioned again, and my family pretended it never happened. But I remember – boy do I remember (‘Why I Love Christmas’ from ‘Crackpot – the obsessions of John Waters)\n\nFor something a little different you could attempt ‘Car Sick’, his memoir of hitchhiking – aged 66 – from Baltimore to San Francisco. Waters’ first novel, ‘Liarmouth’ comes out in May and my pants are moist with anticipation.\n\nWhere John Waters leads, I will follow so here are some (money) shots of my ‘library’. Feel free to pixelate to your heart’s content!(Not shown: my paperback shelves and the bold green Virago classics and the mud orange Penguins all stashed away behind the shelves you see below, left)\n\n”It’s as if I cannot see her without experiencing her in triplicate: the shadow of who she once was, the reality of who she is, the projection of who she might become. I mourn one, am bewildered by the next, and fear for the third.’\n\n‘To Paradise’ is an intimidating book: in size (at over 700 pages it is about the size and weight of a house brick), cover: an image (‘Iokepa, Hawaiian Fisher Boy’ by Herbet Voz, 1898) which brings instant gravitas and solemnity – implying a difficult read in my mind – and expectation.\n\nAh, expectations…Yanagihara’s last novel, ‘A Little Life’ was a global bestseller based around the lives of a groups of gay male friends and how trauma of the past impacts upon their glittering lives. Looking around at a multitude of reviews it was a book which seemed to reduce readers to gibbering wrecks, affecting them emotionally in a way few novels achieve: any future novels would have a lot to live up to. However, while I did enjoy the novel, I found it a bit of an overblown melodrama which would make a fantastically glossy 80’s style miniseries. In fact it was so overblown that I found it very, very funny in places where others found only trauma. It was clear that Yanagihara is a great writer and after ‘A Little Life’ I looked to her first novel, ‘The People in the Trees’ which concerns itself with a scientist studying an isolated tribe in the tropical jungles. A hothouse of creeping dread and unreliability, it was a much more sombre novel, less hysterical, less camp and all the better for it. So, which would the third novel nudge towards, or would ‘To Paradise’ move into different circles\n\nI am glad to report that ‘To Paradise’ takes some of the best elements of Yanagihara’s previous novels – the emotion, the human bonding, but dials down the hysteria of ‘Life’ in favour of the more sombre ‘Trees’. It is a complex novel both in theme and structure, at the same time being easy to read and never once confusing. It is one of those novels which I raced to return to, pulling me in with character, incident and ideas which are both bracing and frightening.\n\nFrightening is one word which I never expected to use when talking about this novel but the themes which run through the novel, bringing together the fears we face around climate change, disease, the loss of faith in politics per se and the delicate balance upon which rights and freedoms exist. Just how easy is it for those freedoms to be removed in the name of the greater good? But, to be clear, it isn’t based in the here and now – it covers the period from 1893 to 2094 – and is set in an approximation of our world, a world with specific differences, such as homosexual relations being accepted in at least part of the USA in 1893:\n\nPart One: New York, 1893 David Bingham, part of the old money ‘Bingham’ family, is set up by his grandfather to meet a potential suitor in the shape of Charles Griffiths, a rich, older man. Despite an attraction, David’s heart has been stolen by Edward Bishop a poor music teacher at the school in which David volunteers. Torn between the two men, David must ask which path paradise?\n\nPart Two: New York/ Hawai’i 1993 1993. David Bingham, a junior paralegal in a New York law firm is having a clandestine (at least in the workplace) affair with Charles, one of the senior partners. David hails from Hawai’i where he was the heir to the abolished Hawaian throne, a position which rested heavily on his father’s shoulders and who failed to live up to family expectations by having an affair with one Edward Bishop. Having escaped these expectations, David struggles with the luxurious lifestyle of his partner who also happens to be infected with an unnamed disease which is killing many of their generation, not least Charles’ oldest friend, Peter.\n\nPart Three: Zone Eight, 2044 – 2094 In Zone Eight of the island which was once known as Manhattan, Charles Griffiths works as a scientist at the Centre for Disease Control which works constantly to fight the continuing onslaught of worldwide pandemics which have killed millions across the globe and together with the impacts of global warming (floods, increasing temperatures) have forced radical shifts in the everyday lives of people, not least in America which is shifting towards martial law. Tough decisions are made regarding how to deal with the infected hoards, decisions which become politically expedient and lead to danger for those responsible, not least Charles Griffiths. Into this landscape comes Charles’ husband, Nathaniel with whom he has a son, David. Like children down the centuries, David rebels against his fathers, joining a group who fight against the current government’s line on dealing with the disease, bringing him into conflict with Charles – a conflict which threatens the very core of Charles and Nathaniel’s relationship and puts the whole family in danger. The world turns and Charles is left alone with his granddaughter, David’s daughter, Charlie.\n\nWe skip forward 50 years and Charlie is now a woman in an arranged marriage. Her life is one surrounded by the creeping eye of the state whose authoritarian instincts remind the reader of the worst days of the twentieth century Eastern Block. She thinks back to the memories of her beloved grandfather, her life with him, his love and his fate. But there are mysteries to be resolved: just where does her husband disappear to every Tuesday evening and who is David, a man she meets one evening on Washington Square, who seems omnipresent and may just hold the key to Charlie’s future?\n\nYanagihara uses repeated names to stress the timelessness of the story, with recurring threads which highlight the eternal human yearning for paradise and the eternal forlorn realisation that paradise is always a step away, and often a hopeless disappointment…yet time and again we see the human spirit try to rise above the hardships faced, Yanagihara showing us the strength of humankind,its indominable spirit – something which she examined in ‘A Little Life’ but here, in pulling back from the hysterics of that novel emerges as all the more powerful, finding heartbreaking moments not in the headlines but in the quiet moments:\n\n‘I imagined them joining hands and walking out the door, down the steps and into their backyard. There they’d stand holding each other’s hands smelling the air, and looking up at the treetops all around them, their mouths opening in winder, their lives becoming glorious – for once – even as they ended.’\n\nThis is a bold, fearless novel, unafraid to face a future of grim authoritarianism or to mark the depressingly repeated follies of humankind. It is a picture which can only get darker in Yanagihara’s world.\n\n‘…the very fact of producing a new life. People do it all the time, of course – we depend on them to. But why would you do it as a lark? His life is spent trying to destroy what this country is. So why would he want to bring a baby into it? Who would want a child to grow up in this time, in this place? It takes a special kind of cruelty to make a baby now, knowing that the world it’ll inhabit and inherit will be dirty and diseased and unjust and difficult. So why would you? What kind of respect for life is that?’\n\nThere is also a fine imagination at work here, pulling pearls from the crushed shells: witness the idea of ‘The Alexandria Project’ of 2056 a group set up to ‘preserve and protect’ the world’s artistic accomplishments from places ‘that had regrettably lost the stewards responsible for their protection’ To all intents and purposes, looters scouring destroyed cities and countries for art to be ‘protected’ by their billionaire donors in unknown warehouses from which they would never be seen again.\n\n‘To Paradise’ is a huge book both literally and metaphorically, brimming with ideas and fears conjured up by the times we are currently living through. It is an American talking about the fears for her country and the world and how, despite everything the human spirit endures, we can still find the tiniest speck of light in the darkest of the dark.\n\nJoe Coppock is recovering from a childhood illness, spending his days watching the nearby railway, playing with his marbles and reading comics with his lazy eye. One day a rag and bone man – Treacle Walker – comes- a-calling and a strange friendship is conjured up.\n\nTreacle Walker is the latest novel from Alan Garner, a writer famed for his novels which fuse folklore, myth, magic and here the fluidity of time. It is a short volume which is dense with wonder and strangeness and delights in the playful history of our language.\n\nTreacle Walker returns time and again, waiting to be invited across the boundary of Joe’s house, offering the boy a cup and a stone in exchange for an old pair of pyjamas and a lamb’s shoulder bone. The cup has Joe’s name written upon it, the stone is inscribed with the picture of a horse. Clearly all is not what it seems. The relationship between the rag and bone man and Joe resonates with folklore and superstition. When he invites Treacle Walker into his domain, just what – rather than who – is Joe bringing into his life? When Joe wanders into the nearby marshy wood he meets Thin Amren, a naked man with copper-brown skin and a hood made of leather, who tells Joseph that his lazy eye is, in fact, a result of “the glamourie” which enables him to see time collapsed into the here and now, tying the boy into the past, present and future of the land, allowing him to enter into the much loved, fabled world of his comics where he fights alongside “Kit the Ancient Brit” against “Whizzy Wizard and the Brit Bashers”.\n\nThis is a magic spell of a book, in which words and sentences leap and come alive and dance before the reader, as if the language itself is having a wild party in which all of its ancestors and relatives and bastard cousins have come to play.\n\n‘Treacle Walker?’ said Thin Amren. ‘Treacle Walker? Me know that pickthank psychopomp? I know him, so I do, I know him. Him with his pots for rags and his bag and his bone and his doddering nag and nookshotten cart and catchpenny oddments. Treacle Walker? I’d not trust that one’s arse with a fart.’\n\nTreacle Walker reminds us that the mythology of our land, our language, our history and our literature is all around us should we take time to look. It is a surprisingly sweet and tender novel which, at the same time, has no truck with sentimentality: it faces life’s hardships face-on yet tackles them with an imagination which races and dances, a whirligig leaving the reader breathless."
