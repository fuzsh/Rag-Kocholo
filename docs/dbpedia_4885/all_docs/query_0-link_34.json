Be prepared for cold snap (and keep an eye on elderly) by David Simister RESIDENTS are being warned this week to make sure they’re prepared for any cold snap that could grip the region. North West Ambulance Service said it was anticipating a rise in the number of callouts to help seriously ill people, particularly with heart and respiratory problems, and for a marked increase in the number of injuries caused by slips and falls on any icy conditions. Derek Cartwright, the acting director of operations said: “The Ambulance Service is an active supporter of NHS North West’s Choose Well campaign, which highlight alternative pathways of care to patients such as NHS Direct, Urgent Care Centres, pharmacies, walk–in centres, minor injury units and GPs, while explaining that visits to A&E departments and ambulances should be for urgent cases only. “Ambulance services are not there simply to transport people to a healthcare centre or hospital – our staff are specially trained in dealing with trauma and life–threatening cases and this is where their expertise should be focused on. Heart attacks, strokes and other urgent incidents cannot wait, we need to get to these people as quickly as possible without having to divert from patients who have coughs and colds and other minor ailments that can be easily treated elsewhere.” The service is urging people not only to wrap up warm as the temperatures plummet, but also to make sure that anyone with an existing health condition has sufficient medication and to make sure they have enough food should snowy conditions prevent travelling. Also, to keep an eye on elderly residents. PARKING FEES HURTING HIGH STREET, CLAIM ‘Shoppers are being put off visiting town centres’ Rising parking charges are said to be harming high street trade. Code NA Report by Natasha Young SEFTON Council is among local authorities being accused of using motorists as ‘cash cows’ despite the effects on local traders, as figures have shown revenue through car parking fines and charges has risen sharply. The Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) has calculated data from the Department for Communities and Local Government, showing the borough’s total off and on–street parking income after expenditure on capital charges increased from £1,143,000 in the 2010/11 financial year to £1,437,000 in 2011/12. While the increase equates to just over a 25% rise in 2011/12, the council has disputed the data claiming ‘true figures’ show its parking income only went up by “less than 2%” during that period. However it didn’t provide any additional figures to support the claim. Continued inside NON FERROUS SCRAP METAL WANTED! NEW TO THE SOUTHPORT AREA 1115106NON FERROUS SCRAP METAL WANTED!
