Second-highest-grossing film of 1993

Mrs. Doubtfire‘s success was bolstered by its clever plot, engaging performances and amazing on-set chemistry between Robin Williams and Sally Field. Audiences were captivated by both the former’s comedic genius and his ability to infuse his character with genuine tenderness and love.

The film’s blend of humor and touching moments resonated with viewers, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1993.

Sally Field received heartbreaking news while filming Mrs. Doubtfire

During the filming of Mrs. Doubtfire, Sally Field experienced a personal tragedy that revealed the compassionate side of her co-star, Robin Williams. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, she recounted the moment she received devastating news about her father while on set.

“I never shared this story before,” the actor revealed. “I was in the camper outside of the courtroom where we were shooting the divorce scene. My father had a stroke a couple of years before and was in a nursing facility. I got a phone call from the doctor saying my father had passed – a massive stroke. He asked if I wanted them to put him on the resuscitator. I said, ‘No, he did not want that. Just let him go. And please lean down and say, ‘Sally says goodbye.””

Robin Williams showed compassion for his co-star

Sally Field was understandably distraught, but she was determined not to let her personal grief affect the film’s production. She explained to Vanity Fair, “I was of course beside myself. I came on the set trying with all my might to act. I wasn’t crying. Robin came over, pulled me out of the set, and asked, ‘Are you okay?'”

It was then that Field confided in Robin Williams about her father’s passing, leading to an immediate and heartfelt response from her co-star; Williams’ reaction to her news exemplified his deep empathy and intuition. Upon learning about the passing of Field’s father, he took swift action to support his colleague. “Oh my God, we need to get you out here right now,” he said, recognizing the need for her to take some time to process her grief and make arrangements.

“And he made it happen – they shot around me the rest of the day,” she recalled. “I could go back to my house, call my brother, and make arrangements. It’s a side of Robin that people rarely knew: He was very sensitive and intuitive.”
