        "meta_description": "“Oh... as I hold this cold meat, I'm reminded of Winston.&nbsp;God rest his soul.” We watched “Mrs. Doubtfire” (1993) with MTMUG All Star Joshua Clement and we don’t do laundry, we don’t do windows and we DON’T do diapers. Listen, it’s been 30 years since this family comedy was released and our ideas about gender identity and expression have come a long way. That being said, we firmly believe Robin Williams did not have a malicious bone in his body or thought in his heart when he committed Euphegenia Doubtfire to film. The queer sensibilities are rife throughout Daniel Hillard’s (Williams) journey to become the matronly Mrs. Doubtfire in order to spend more time with his kids. From his gay brother Frank, played by icon Harvey Fierstein, to Robin’s manic (and still hilarious) performance channeling Mrs. Doubtfire. As time goes by, we are finding ourselves understanding Miranda (Sally Field) a bit more - that pony was INSIDE the house! Don’t get us started on Pierce Brosnan serving up body in the pool scene - we’ll be rewinding that one, thank you very much.&nbsp; We also love (and grew up with) the Hillard children played by Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence and little bitty Mara Wilson.&nbsp; This cast is perfect, the jokes still hold up and Robin, as always, serves up a master class in comedy.&nbsp; Thanks for listening and don't forget to subscribe, rate and review us on Apple Podcasts!

If we had no business watching it - we stole our parents VHS copy and watched under the cover of night. If a diva gave a rousing speech - we memorized it and lip-synced it at a talent show. Join Scott and Pete each week for a look back at the Movies That Made Us Gay!"
