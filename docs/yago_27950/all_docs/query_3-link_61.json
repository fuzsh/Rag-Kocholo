        "text": "Sally Field Shares Touching Memory Of Robin Williams And \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" And Fans Can't Hold Back Their Tears\n\nAcademy Award-winner Sally Field recalled a heartwarming memory of Robin Williams while they filmed the 1993 comedy Mrs. Doubtfire, and it made me very emotional.\n\nFor the 10th anniversary of Robin Williams's untimely death, Vanity Fair asked his costars and friends to share their favorite memories of the Grammy, Emmy, and Oscar-winning actor.\n\nBilly Crystal, Matt Damon, Ben Stiller, Robert De Niro, Al Pacino, Julianne Moore, and others shared their memories of working with the incredibly talented comedian and entertainer.\n\nSally Field, who starred alongside Robin in 1993's Mrs. Doubtfire, shared a heartfelt story about how her compassionate costar made special arrangements during filming to accommodate her during a very challenging time, and it's moving.\n\n\"I never shared this story before,\" Sally said. \"I was in the camper outside of the courtroom where we were shooting the divorce scene. My father had a stroke a couple of years before, and was in a nursing facility.\"\n\n\"I was of course beside myself,\" Sally added. \"I came on the set trying with all my might to act. I wasn't crying. Robin came over, pulled me out of the set, and asked, 'Are you okay?'\"\n\nSally eventually explained to Robin that her father had died, and she recalled him saying, \"Oh my God, we need to get you out here right now.\"\n\nSally's comments about Robin have started circulating on the internet, and many people are taking time to remember Robin's legacy and how his larger-than-life characters made them feel.\n\nResponding to Variety's share of the story, one person wrote: \"I still cry for him. God rest his soul.\"\n\nTwitter: @AlexNever347\n\nAnother person wrote: \"Such an amazing human. hope he's resting peacefully always.\"\n\nTwitter: @njhftdolans\n\n\"A beautiful thing about Robin was he was never boastful of the good things he did for others. The world is a lot more dimmer without his presence,\" another user wrote.\n\nTwitter: @MrAMG\n\nOne of Robin's youngest costars in Mrs. Doubtfire also had a delightful memory about the actor. Mara Wilson, who played his daughter in the film, said, \"People are always surprised when I tell them that Robin could be very quiet. When I was nine, we did a table read of What Dreams May Come, shortly after my mother had died.\"\n\nChris, who also directed Nine Months and Bicentennial Man, which starred Robin, said this was due to the late actor's knack for hilarious improvisation. \"Robin and I made a deal. He said, 'We're going do two or three scripted takes, and then we are going to play.'\"\n\nSally added, \"It was my task to simply respond to whatever he did, as a real person would. I completely loved that stay-on-your-toes feeling.\"\n\nRobin's relationship with his costars and the cast of Mrs. Doubtfire lifted spirits and made everyone feel like he was their friend. The movie was filmed in San Francisco, and Chris said it was \"his hometown, so he knew a lot of the crew members [on Mrs. Doubtfire].\"\n\nMara added that while filming a memorable scene at the petting zoo, Robin \"took off his hat, put some oats in it, and fed the pony I was riding. Then he turned to me with the slobber-covered hat: 'Wanna wear it?' I must have made a disgusted face, because Chris called 'Cut!' and everyone burst out laughing.\"\n\nUltimately, his memory through Mrs. Doubtfire and beyond had a lasting impression on his collaborators, costars, friends, and fans.\n\nFinally, Sally put it best when describing the character that Robin Williams built on and off the screen: \"I keep thinking of him as 'is.' He can't have left; he can't. He's still here. I feel him.\"\n\nHis memory will never leave as long as there are movies like Jumanji, Aladdin, Hook, Insomnia, Dead Poets Society, The Birdcage, and many, many more to watch over and over again. He's still here, for sure.\n\nRead the full interview here.\n\nDo you have a favorite Robin Williams moment or memory? Share in the comments.\n\nShare This Article"
