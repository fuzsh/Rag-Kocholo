Credit: CBS\n\nThe actor himself told Parade magazine in 2013, \"The idea of having a steady job [on The Crazy Ones] is appealing. I have two [other] choices: go on the road doing stand-up, or do small, independent movies working almost for scale [minimum union pay]. The movies are good, but a lot of times they don’t even have distribution. There are bills to pay. My life has downsized, in a good way. I'm selling the ranch up in Napa. I just can't afford it anymore.”\n\nThese 8 gifs of Robin Williams dancing will make you smile\n\nThe source revealed the pair used to go cycling regularly near their homes. He added that the reason he signed up to TV show 'The Crazy Ones,' which was cancelled this year after one season, was because they filmed in California, meaning the star wasn't away from his family for any length of time.\n\nThe friend also suggested that Williams' third wife Susan Schneider was getting increasingly worried about the actor's mental wellbeing.\n\n\"His wife was very worried by the end,\" he said, \"but she knew what she was getting into with him. Their marriage was great, very strong. It was all about what was going on inside of him.\"\n\n'Mrs. Doubtfire 2' has been in development for some time, with Williams meeting writer David Berenbaum to discuss the script. The future of the project is now in doubt.\n\nStars react to the death of Robin Williams\n\nRemembering Robin Williams: His best on-screen moments\n\nRobin Williams: the family he leaves behind"
