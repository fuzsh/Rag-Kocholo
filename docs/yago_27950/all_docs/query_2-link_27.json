        "text": "Much of it feels synthetic and crude, more the result of engineering than inspiration. The [filmmakers] put a commercial glaze on everything, as if a future TV series were taking over the movie even as it was unreeling in the projector.\n\nSeptember 22, 2022\n\nYou can't take Mrs. Doubtfire seriously for a moment, its daddy-track sympathies notwithstanding, and you'll know exactly where it's going at every turn. You'll laugh, though Robin Williams will not be denied,\n\nAugust 18, 2021\n\nA somewhat grotesque take on Mary Poppins, this picture has an attitude and style all its own.\n\nSeptember 16, 2020\n\nAnybody tempted by nostalgia should stay away to preserve the illusion that this was once so well-liked.\n\nApril 21, 2020\n\nThe greater story is sacrificed for schticky gags about a guy dressing as an old woman.\n\nJune 21, 2017"
