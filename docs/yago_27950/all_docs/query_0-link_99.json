        "text": "The 1990s were filled with timeless classics, one of which was certainly Mrs. Doubtfire (1993), a heartwarming comedy, starring Robin Williams and Sally Field. It captured the hearts of millions and remains a beloved film. However, behind the laughter and family-friendly plot, a deeply personal story unfolded on set that showcased the profound humanity of its stars.\n\nMagic of Mrs. Doubtfire\n\nReleased in 1993, Mrs. Doubtfire quickly became a box office sensation, grossing $441.3 million at the worldwide box office.\n\nDirected by Chris Columbus, the movie starred Robin Williams as Daniel Hillard, a father who resorts to disguising himself as a female housekeeper to stay close to his children following a bitter divorce. Sally Field portrayed Miranda Hillard, his estranged wife, in a performance that balanced humor with heartfelt emotion.\n\nSecond-highest-grossing film of 1993\n\nMrs. Doubtfire‘s success was bolstered by its clever plot, engaging performances and amazing on-set chemistry between Robin Williams and Sally Field. Audiences were captivated by both the former’s comedic genius and his ability to infuse his character with genuine tenderness and love.\n\nThe film’s blend of humor and touching moments resonated with viewers, making it the second-highest-grossing film of 1993.\n\nSally Field received heartbreaking news while filming Mrs. Doubtfire\n\nDuring the filming of Mrs. Doubtfire, Sally Field experienced a personal tragedy that revealed the compassionate side of her co-star, Robin Williams. In a recent interview with Vanity Fair, she recounted the moment she received devastating news about her father while on set.\n\n“I never shared this story before,” the actor revealed. “I was in the camper outside of the courtroom where we were shooting the divorce scene. My father had a stroke a couple of years before and was in a nursing facility. I got a phone call from the doctor saying my father had passed – a massive stroke. He asked if I wanted them to put him on the resuscitator. I said, ‘No, he did not want that. Just let him go. And please lean down and say, ‘Sally says goodbye.””\n\nRobin Williams showed compassion for his co-star\n\nSally Field was understandably distraught, but she was determined not to let her personal grief affect the film’s production. She explained to Vanity Fair, “I was of course beside myself. I came on the set trying with all my might to act. I wasn’t crying. Robin came over, pulled me out of the set, and asked, ‘Are you okay?'”\n\nIt was then that Field confided in Robin Williams about her father’s passing, leading to an immediate and heartfelt response from her co-star; Williams’ reaction to her news exemplified his deep empathy and intuition. Upon learning about the passing of Field’s father, he took swift action to support his colleague. “Oh my God, we need to get you out here right now,” he said, recognizing the need for her to take some time to process her grief and make arrangements.\n\nRobin Williams adjusted the filming of Mrs. Doubtfire for Sally Field\n\nRobin Williams spoke to Chris Columbus and arranged for the filming schedule to be adjusted, so Sally Field could be absent for the day without disrupting the production.\n\nMore from us: A Father Gifted His Daughter a Ticket to Disneyland From 1985 – And the Park Honored It!\n\nWant to become a trivia master?

It’s a side of Robin that people rarely knew: He was very sensitive and intuitive.”"
