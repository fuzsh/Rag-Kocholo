        "text": "Beloved entertainer Robin Williams captivated audiences worldwide with his one-of-a-kind performances that charted an unforgettable variety of characters in television and film. A selection of Williams’ own film memorabilia — from scripts to awards and props — will be offered in Creating A Stage: The Collection of Marsha and Robin Williams (4 October, New York). Ahead of the auction, we take a look back at some of his most fondly remembered roles.\n\nRobin Williams burst into America’s hearts and homes in the comedy sitcom Mork & Mindy, which ran from 1978 to 1982. Williams starred as Mork, an alien from the planet Ork, who came to Boulder, Colorado, to study human behavior.\n\nIn this classic film Williams starred as Adrian Cronauer, a irreverent DJ, who assigned to an U.S. Armed Services radio in Saigon during the Vietnam War. For his performance, Williams received his first Academy Award nomination for Best Actor.\n\nFor his poigniant performance as Mr. Keating, an English teacher who sets aflame the hearts and minds of a prep school of boys through the power of poetry, Williams earned his second Academy Award nomination.\n\nIn Steven Spielberg’s revamp of a childhood classic, Williams brought a spirit of magic to a new generation in the leading role of a grown-up Peter Pan returned to Wonderland to retrieve his children from the villainous Captain Hook, played by Dustin Hoffman.\n\nIn this animated Disney classic based on the Arabic tale One Thousand and One Nights, Williams played the voice of Genie – a rambunctious genie with magical powers, released from his lamp by Aladdin, a good-natured street thief from the fictional city of Agrabah.\n\nAs the title role in Mrs. Doubtfire, a hit-film produced by Marsha and Robin Williams, the actor played a divorced dad disguised as an English grandmotherly nanny in an elaborate ruse to spend time with his kids. The both hilarious and heartfelt film drove home that a family – no matter its shape — is always a family.\n\nWilliams had a talent for playing fathers who would do anything for their children; in The Birdcage, this ability reached new comedic heights as he played Armand, a gay Miami drag club owner, who feigns straightness to meet his son’s conservative future in-laws.\n\nWilliams starred as therapist Sean Maguire, who struggles to break through to Will Hunting, a brilliant but troubled working class savant played by Matt Damon. Williams’ powerful performance earned him an Academy award for Best Supporting Actor.\n\nWilliams’ talents crossed all genres. In 2002, he took a turn at psychological thriller in One Hour Photo, playing a disturbed and obsessive photo lab technician."
