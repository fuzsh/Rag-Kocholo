        "text": "Although Ferngully is a perfect example of that, it didn't make the cut! Neither did the truly haunting (not in a good way) Toys and Jack even though they are movies that stick with me to this day.\n\nRobin can make you laugh, but he also plays hurt people. People who can almost bring you tears with a single defeated look. Let's see how many defeated characters show up as opposed to genuinely fun characters!\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#10- World's Greatest Dad (2009)\n\nWhy this movie?:\n\nI think because this movie is so challenging for me. It gets darker than most movies I like but its anchored by such a dynamic Robin Williams. I also like the Hitchcock-esque struggle to keep up a lie and get away with something hook to this movie.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nThis one's rough. As one of the last Robin William's movies I actually liked it is also heavily tied to suicide. So if you can believe it, re watching this movie, can make things even more uncomfortable than they already are. Playing Lance gives Robinan opportunity to migrate from the tears and become more clownish. Overall I think it's a well balanced role for Robin which sees him trying to do something out of love.\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#9- Dead Poets Society (1989)\n\nWhy this movie?:\n\nCall me sappy but I love watching people find themselves on film. I'm sure I'd love this movie even more if there were black people in it but I get why the (maybe) two black guys I saw were relegated to the scene about Football. Seeing how the individual students reacted to Robin's lessons still makes for a compelling watch to this day.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?\n\nWelp, here's something they don't tell you before you watch this movie and decide to skip reading the book for class. This movie is about John Keating's students! So don't let the lower ranking fool you, I simply just think there isn't enough of Robin in this movie for my liking. He definitely is the clown and positive influence throughout the film... you know until the suicide that he gets blamed for and his tearful goodbye. I'd be lying if I said his final scene didn't\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#8- Death to Smoochy (2002)\n\nWhy This Movie?:\n\nAs my dad always says, \"Certain titles demand that you see them.\" Death to Smoochy is one such title. That rule has led me a stray with such films as potential MvsM movie, John Tucker Must Die. There is something to be said about a Danny DeVito directed film as well. I love Matilda and definitely have a soft spot for this movie. Something about the mix child like wonder and a mean spirit just works for me. I should also point out that this movie, Sausage Party, and Birdman are part of a very small club called \"Movies I actively like Edward Norton in\" I guess they all have him playing an actor.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nThis role for Robin is all tears. The only time we see him even remotely happy is when he's playing Rainbow Randolph or when he's celebrating the possible death of another person. Also a weird character tick of talking about someone's sexuality as if being gay makes them less than. All things that don't just make him a tearful clown but an out and out bad guy for most of this film.\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#7- The Birdcage (1996)\n\nWhy This Movie?:\n\nA lot of my love for this movie comes from being able to quote lines with my mother. But if we dig even deeper than that, I think it's clear that the fact that Genie, Timon, and basically every voice on The Simpsons... including the problematic Apu are all in one place for me to enjoy. Just kidding, I just like that it's a movie that my mother and I can enjoy together.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nHere's a movie that has Robin bending over backwards for his son without coming off as dark. In fact you'd be forgiven if you didn't notice the tears of this clown. Armand Goldman runs a burlesque show, has funny mix ups where his Greek dinnerware has men leapfrogging, and there are hilarious mix ups about how not Jewish his last name is depending on who is saying it. However at the heart of the movie is the fact that Armand loves his husband and son and desperately wants to right by both even though it appears those two things are mutually exclusive. Armand has to reject the love of his life or be rejected by his son all leading to a more tears of a clown performance than all around fun clown.\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#6- Jumanji (1995)\n\nWhy this movie?:\n\nI don't even think I saw this movie in theatres. I don't know why. What I do know is some kids got out of school to go see the movie and I felt like an idiot for not being able to talk about this movie with all the kids at school when it was in theatres. At any rate I was able to see it on home video and I remember watching it multiple times a day until it needed to be returned. The mix of adventure and a dash of humour was a perfect mix for me.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nDefinitely mostly tears. Before we even meet adult Alan Parrish he's picked on and neglected by his father. his only friend is the amazing David Alan Grier but he gets him fired so... Take all that in then realize that when we see Robin as Alan he is fresh out of a living hell and is trying everything he can to avoid going back.\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#5- Good Morning, Vietnam (1987)\n\nWhy This Movie?:\n\nIn addition to being a showcase for Robin Williams' talent with rapid fire humour, I truly appreciated the supporting cast. Especially how much fun Forest Whitaker's Garlick is. Not to be outdone, Bruno Kirby's Hauk struggling with proving how funny is definitely appreciated.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nAdrian Cronauer is definitely a clown for the majority of this movie. He is the burst of energy the troops need to get through their tour. What's interesting is the problematic way he pursues Trinh as an object to be fetishsized almost feels like it'll never get checked due to how funny Robin is in the role. Luckily for an audience watching today, and unfortunately for Adrian, that definitely gets checked as the war and his superiors all work to humble Adrian and chase him away. What does go unchecked is the implication that there is something wrong with Jimmy Wah because he's gay. The point is, Like Dead Poets, Robin ends on a more tears of a clown note than full on clown.\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#4- Mrs. Doubtfire (1993)\n\nWhy This Movie?:\n\nI was actually angry at this movie when I left the theatre. I've obviously come to appreciate this film but seriously, he doesn't get to be with his kids as Daniel at the end of this movie. Having said all of that, it's a wild ride of a movie and may be the movie that cemented Robin Williams in my books as legendary status. for an adult to make me connect with them emotionally the way Robin did in this movie was quite a feat at that early stage in my life.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nYes it's funny watching Daniel Hillard do voice acting work and become Mrs. Doubtfire but let's be real. Even kids can pick up on the tears of a clown act going on from the beginning of the movie. Daniel blows up his life only to do whatever it takes to spend time with his kids and in the end the court still rules that he's not fit. Tears all around, fam!\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#3- Aladdin (1992)\n\nWhy This Movie?:\n\nThis isn't just one of Robin's top movies it's up there as far as all Disney animate films go! The music, the magic, the action, the SEGA version of the game? All dope! No one can tell me anything bad about this movie. It's a classic.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nLike Birdcage, I can see how people might miss the tears of a clown aspect to the Genie. He's a laugh a second. Possible anachronistic impressions and references, in addition to amazing songs, aside Genie desperately wants to be free. If he can sing and dance well enough maybe master will use one of his wishes to set him free. At the end of the day \"friendship\" don't mean a thing if Aladdin doesn't choose to free Genie without his last wish.\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#2- Hook (1991)\n\nWhy This Movie?:\n\nI have defended this movie so much it's ridiculous. Who doesn't like Rufio? Who doesn't like exlaiming Bangarang? The fact that Steven Spielberg doesn't even like this movie blows my mind! Maybe I just really like Peter Pan because the idea of a movie where Hook is the one who is still trying to live out his glory days and baits Peter back into their old dynamic of fighting all day sounds and is amazing!\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nYou know what? I'm going to say neither. This movie is about Peter Banning (I would have bet money it was Panning), the coward, getting back to his care free days as Peter Pan. Not so he can clown around with his lost boys but so he can be a better husband and father to his family. You know growing up by embracing his more childlike tendencies. So that's fresh right?\n\nFilm/Rank:\n\n#1- Good Will Hunting (1997)\n\nWhy This Movie?:\n\nPaul, the person who made sure I met my wife. loves this movie so it can't be all that bad right? It's hard to put into words what exactly makes me not just love but respect this movie. But I think it's because almost everyone I respect in my life also likes this movie on some level. It also would have been the first time I saw Robin actually play an adult. Which is to say, someone you should actually take advice from instead of just someone who makes life fun.\n\nMore Tears or Clown?:\n\nThere is no question that Sean is more tears than clown in this movie. I don't even know that he is any part clown. Yes he has moments of levity, however, there is just a general layer of moroseness throughout this whole performance. I get it, he lost the love of his life, I wouldn't be singing and dancing while doing weird black preacher impressions.\n\n-YG"
