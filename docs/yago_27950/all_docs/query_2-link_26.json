        "text": "She's a hip ol' granny who can hip-hop, be-bop, dance till you drop and yo-yo — make a wicked cup of cocoa.\n\nOn Nov. 24, 1993, the late Robin Williams charmed audiences when he pulled double duty as down-on-his luck Daniel Hillard and the iconic titular character Mrs. Euphegenia Doubtfire. In this Chris Columbus-directed dramedy, a divorced father of three creates an elaborate plan to spend more time with his children by disguising himself as an older woman and posing as their nanny ... with a Scottish accent.\n\nMrs. Doubtfire was a box office success and garnered critical acclaim, earning a Golden Globe for best motion picture — musical or comedy and an Academy Award for Best Makeup in 1994. Williams also took home a Golden Globe for best actor in a musical or comedy. In October 2018, the cast reunited for the film's 25th anniversary, and actor Pierce Brosnan — who plays the new boyfriend of Daniel's ex-wife (Sally Field) — discussed the movie's impact during an appearance on the Today show in November of that year.\n\n\"I think it's really ingrained in my heart as a piece of beautiful cinema — and cinema that touched the world and has gone on so for 25 years because of the healing power of laughter — but also because [of] the nature of the story, which is very empowering for young men and women or families that are divorced,\" Brosnan said. \"I think it's a very healing film in many ways.\"\n\nThough Columbus rejected the idea of a sequel, particularly after Williams' death in 2014, the '90s classic found a new life on Broadway in December 2021 (and later hit the road on a North American tour in September 2023).\n\nHelp is on the way, dear. Here's what the cast of Mrs. Doubtfire has been up to since its 1993 premiere.\n\n01 of 08\n\nRobin Williams as Daniel Hillard/Mrs. Doubtfire\n\nIn the dual role of Daniel Hillard and Mrs. Doubtfire, Williams felt complete freedom when exploring the character.\n\n\"I started to play with the voice.

He is survived by his third wife, Susan Schneider Williams, whom he wed in 2011. The late actor also had three children — Zak, Zelda and Cody — from his previous marriages to Valerie Velardi and Marsha Garces.\n\n02 of 08\n\nSally Field as Miranda Hillard\n\nField portrayed Miranda Hillard, Daniel's ex-wife, who pursues a romantic relationship with her co-worker, Stu (Brosnan).\n\nSince appearing in the classic film, Field earned an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress for 2012's Lincoln (totaling three career nominations and two wins).
