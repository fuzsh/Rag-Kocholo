        "text": "Joey Lawrence (born Joseph Lawrence Mignogna III) is an American actor and singer from Pennsylvania. He is a former child actor, and has had an active career since the early 1980s. Lawrence is primarily known for television roles in sitcoms. He portrayed middle child Joseph \"Joey\" Russo in the popular sitcom \"Blossom\" (1990-1995), and male nanny Joseph Paul \"Joe\" Longo in the sitcom \"Melissa & Joey\" (2010-2015). As a singer, he is mostly remembered for the hit song \"Nothin' My Love Can't Fix\" (1993), which peaked at number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nIn 1976, Lawrence was born in Abington Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, located in Philadelphia's northern fringe. The township has largely been overshadowed by Philadelphia for most of its history. It is mostly remembered in history books as one of the battlefields in the inconclusive Battle of White Marsh (1777). Lawrence's parents were Joseph Lawrence Mignogna Sr. and his wife Donna Lynn Shaw. His father was an insurance broker and his mother was a personnel manager and former school teacher. Through his parents, Lawrence has English, Italian, and Scottish ancestry. His entire family changed their surname to \"Lawrence\" during his childhood.\n\nLawrence started appearing in commercials in early childhood. In 1982, he received his first taste of television stardom when he performed a song in the late-night talk show \"The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson\" (1962-1992). In the same year, he had his first guest star roles in the long-running sitcom \"Diff'rent Strokes\" (1978-1986) and the then-new sitcom \"Silver Spoons\" (1982-1987).\n\nIn 1983, Lawrence joined the main cast of the sitcom \"Gimme a Break!\" (1981-1987). He played the new foster son of main character Nellie Ruth \"Nell\" Harper (played by Nell Carter), who was already tasked with raising an old friend's three daughters. The series was moderately successful for most of its run. Its 6th and final season featured an attempt to retool the series, with most of the regular cast written out and the introduction of a new premise. This failed to prevent its cancellation, marking the end of Lawrence's first recurring role.\n\nLawrence had his feature film debut in the comedy \"Summer Rental\" (1985). He played Bobby Chester, son of the main character Jack Chester (played by John Candy). The film focuses on the efforts of stressed-out Jack to achieve victory over an arrogant sailing champion who has ruined his vacation. The film earned 25 million dollars at the domestic box office. It is mainly remembered for featuring John Candy's first lead role in a Hollywood film.\n\nIn 1988, Lawrence had his first starring role in a film. He voiced the eponymous orphan kitten Oliver in the animated feature film \"Oliver & Company\". The film was a loose adaptation of the novel \"Oliver Twist\" by Charles Chickens, changing the setting to 1980s New York City and featuring anthropomorphic animals in main roles. The film was a box office hit of its time, helping revitalize the animated studio Walt Disney Feature Animation. However, Oliver's role was overshadowed by that of the Artful Dodger (voiced by Billy Joel) who was granted more screen-time\n\nLawrence received more attention when he joined the cast of the sitcom \"Blossom\" (1990-1995). The series' main character was Italian-American teenage girl Blossom Ruby Russo (played by Mayim Bialik), but the main cast also featured Blossom's single father, her two older brothers, and her best friend. Lawrence had to play middle child Joseph \"Joey\" Russo, a skilled baseball player and aspiring ladies' man. Despite his stereotypical \"dumb jock\" traits, Joey received some character development and at time shared the spotlight with his sister. Lawrence was at the height of his popularity during the series' run, which lasted for 5 seasons and 114 episodes.\n\nLawrence wanted to have a singing career of his own. In 1993, he released his eponymous debut album \"Joey Lawrence\". He co-wrote some of the album's songs, including the international hit \"Nothin' My Love Can't Fix\". He performed the song live at then-popular music television shows, such as \"The Arsenio Hall Show\" and \"Top of the Pops\". His next album, \"Soulmates\" (1997), did not chart. He subsequently released the singles \"\"Ven Ven Conmigo\" (1997) and \"Never Gonna Change My Mind\" (1998), the later of which was the 49th most popular song in the British charts. Following these, Lawrence's singing career went on hiatus.\n\nIn 1995, Lawrence was cast as the main character in a sitcom. He played elder brother Joseph \"Joe\" Roman in \"Brotherly Love\" (1995-1997), while his real-life brothers Matthew Lawrence and Andrew Lawrence were cast in the roles of Joe's half-brothers. In the series, Joe was a 20-year-old mechanic. Following his father's death in a racing accident, Joe had to serve as a father figure to his two underage half-brothers. Other subplot's of the series focused on Joe's attempts to woo female mechanic (and artist) Louise \"Lou\" Davis (played by Liz Vassey), and whether she actually viewed him as a love interest. The series lasted for 2 seasons and 40 episodes, though it was never a ratings hit.\n\nAfter a brief decline in his acting career, Lawrence had a supporting role in the slasher film \"Urban Legends: Final Cut\" (2000). The film was the second in a trilogy of slasher films. In the film, film student Amy Mayfield (played by Jennifer Morrison) has to discover who is the masked serial killer who is targeting her classmates, and why is he stalking her in particular. The film was noted for homaging scenes from several classic serial killer films, particularly Italian giallo films.\n\nIn 2001, Lawrence had one of the main roles in the slasher film \"Do You Wanna Know a Secret?\" The film featured a mysterious killer, who always warned victims by writing this message before attacking. The film has a subplot about the killer's unrequited love for a woman, and mentions that he has been stalking her for more than a year.\n\nIn 2002, Lawrence played a police detective in the neo-noir erotic thriller \"Trois 2: Pandora's Box\". In the film, retired police psychologist Mia DuBois (played by Monica Calhoun) is unaware that her husband, her lover, and her new patient have secretly conspired to get their hands on her inheritance money. The film was marketed as a sequel to the then-popular erotic thriller \"Trois\" (2000), though their plots and characters were unrelated.\n\nIn 2002, Lawrence joined the cast of the period television series \"American Dreams\" (2002-2005), which depicted life in Philadelphia during the 1960s. He played the floor producer of the historical music and dance show \"American Bandstand\" (1952-1989), though his character was written out following the period series' first season.\n\nLawrence next had one of the main roles in the short-lived sitcom \"Run of the House\" (2003-2004). The series' premise was that three adult siblings are allowed to move into their middle-aged parents' former residence in Michigan, on condition of raising their underage sister Brooke Franklin (played by Margo Harshman). The series only lasted a single season and 19 episodes, as it was canceled due to low ratings.\n\nIn 2005, Lawrence joined the cast of the sitcom \"Half & Half\" (2002-2006). He played recurring character Brett Mahoney for the series' last few seasons. The series' premise followed the interactions between half-sisters Mona Rose Thorne (played by Rachel True) and Deirdre Chantal \"Dee Dee\" Thorne (played by Essence Atkins). The two women decided to form a relationship after moving into the same apartment building, despite being kept apart for most of their lives and having much different life experiences.\n\nIn 2006, Lawrence played a police officer in the horror film \"Rest Stop\". The premise of the film was that main character Nicole Carrow (played by Jaimie Alexander) had a series of mysterious encounters in a sparsely-populated area, including meeting a girl (or the girl's ghost) who went missing in 1971. The film was released direct-to-video, where it was an unexpected sales hit. It reportedly had a gross of about 5 million dollars in domestic video sales at retail.\n\nIn 2007, Lawrence played the recurring role of serial killer and serial rapist Clay Dobson in the police procedural television series \"CSI: NY\" (2004-2013). According to his character arc, Dobson had originally been convicted without forensic evidence tying him to his first murder. He was released on appeal, and took care that the corpses of his victims were never found.\n\nIn 2008, Lawrence played a fictionalized version of himself as one of the murder victims in the comedy horror film \"Killer Pad\". The film concerns three young men who are oblivious to the fact that their new residence is a portal to hell, and that their new friend Lucy (played by Emily Foxler) is actually Lucifer in female form. Much of the humor derived from their failure to notice supernatural events around them.\n\nIn 2009, Lawrence experienced a resurgence of his career when he and actress Melissa Joan Hart co-starred in the comedy television film \"My Fake Fiancé\". The premise of the film was that two financially broke people arranged their marriage to each other, motivated primarily by the idea of getting cash and gifts from their families and friends. But a brief cohabitation resulted in them developing genuine feelings for each other. The film was the most \"the most-watched television film of the ratings season\", and was unexpectedly popular with key demographics. Motivating the network ABC Family to cast Lawrence and Hard as the co-leads in an upcoming sitcom.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2015, Lawrence played the male lead in the sitcom \"Melissa & Joey\". The premise of the series was that character Joseph Paul \"Joe\" Longo (Lawrence) was a formerly successful business executive and commodities trader, who lost his job, money and marriage due to a Ponzi scheme orchestrated by the brother-in-law of young politician Melanie Alison \"Mel\" Burke (Melissa Joan Hart). Following the disappearance of her brother-in-law and the incarceration of her sister, Melanie became the legal guardian of her niece and nephew. Having no idea how to raise two kids on her own, Melanie hired Joe as a male nanny and live-in housekeeper. The two adults eventually started dating each other, and were eventually married. The series lasted for 4 seasons and 104 episodes. The series was among the highest-rated sitcoms during its first three seasons. Ratings declined during its fourth season, along with a general decline in the numbers of television network subscribers at the time. The network decided to cancel the series.\n\nIn 2011, Lawrence revived his singing career. He released the singles \"Rolled\" and \"Give It To Ya\" during this year. He released several more singles between 2013 and 2022. He also released the albums \"Imagine\" (2017) and \"Guilty\" (2022). In 2017, Lawrence formed the music band \"Still 3\" with his brothers Matt and Andy.\n\nIn July 2017, Lawrence and his wife Chandie Yawn-Nelson both filed for Chapter 7 bankruptcy. Their case was reportedly settled in April, 2018, though its details were not publicized. The couple filed for divorce in 2020. They had been married since 2005, and had been acquainted to each other since their teen years. In August 2021, Lawrence was engaged to actress Samantha Cope. They were married to each other on May 1, 2022. This is Lawrence's third marriage, and he has two children from previous marriages.\n\nBy 2022, Lawrence was 46-years-old. He has not had recurring acting roles for several years, though he continues appearing in guest-star roles in several television series. His singing career is still ongoing, and he keeps releasing new material. Lawrence is no longer a teen idol, but his career has endured for 40 years. He remains popular due to several of his past roles.\n\nCynthia Cristina Ferrare, the TV personality and former wife of auto executive John DeLorean, was born on February 8, 1950 in Cleveland, Ohio, to Italian-American Catholic parents, Renata Velia (Torinesi) and Tavio C. Ferrare, a butcher. Her family relocated to Los Angeles when she was 14 years old. Because of her beauty, she was offered work as a teenage model while she was still 14, and eventually was hired as a model by the makeup company Max Factor when she was 16. As a 20-year-old, she signed with Eileen Ford, one of the top modeling agencies in New York, and became a cover girl on the major fashion magazines. This exposure led to acting offers, and she signed a contract with the film studio 20th Century. She continued as the face of Max Factor, \"The Max Factor Girl\", until she was 26 years old.\n\nIn 1973, she married National Alliance of Businessmen President John DeLorean, the former vice president of car and truck production at General Motors, who was 25 years her senior. DeLorean, who had been the youngest man to ever head a division at General Motors when he was promoted head of the Pontiac Div. in 1965 at the age of 40, was a non-conformist with a flair for self-promotion who moved in show business circles. He had left G.M. in 1973 with the idea of starting his own automobile company, which eventually would become a reality in the 1980s, but would lead to his professional downfall and the collapse of his marriage.\n\nThe same year Ferrare married DeLorean, she had her sole leading role in motion pictures, the B-horror movie Mary, Bloody Mary (1975). Shot in Mexico and featuring the beautiful Ferrare as a bisexual vampire, the movie was released and sank without a trace despite her erotic nude scenes. She was a finalist to appear in Drei Engel für Charlie (1976), losing out to Jaclyn Smith, but her acting career never gained traction. As an actress, she mostly did guest spots on series TV like Love Boat (1977), but Ferrare did establish a career as a TV host. She served as the co-host on ABC's The Home Show (1988) as co-host of the \"Home & Family\" show with Michael Burger, and as co-host of \"AM Los Angeles\", which during her five-year stint, was was the highest rated morning show in its market, the second-largest in the country.\n\nAs Ferrare's career as a TV personality rose, DeLorean's business fortunes crashed. The car company that bore his name went bankrupt. In 1982, John DeLorean was trapped in a sting operated by the F.B.I. and charged with trafficking in cocaine, to raise money to refinance his car company. Both Ferrare and DeLorean became born-again Christians after the arrest, and in the two-year legal ordeal that followed, Ferrare stood by her husband. DeLorean was acquitted in August 1984, due to entrapment.\n\nFerrare realized her marriage to DeLorean had been shallow and unfulfilling. Since she was a girl in Cleveland, she had dreamed of having a fairy tale life. Life with media darling DeLorean, however, eventually came to feel make-believe, and she knew their marriage was over long before it was officially ended. Her turning to Christianity helped her to brave the ordeal of her husband's arrest and trial, but after DeLorean's acquittal, Ferrare sought a divorce.\n\nHer divorce was granted in 1985, and that same year, she married entertainment industry executive Tony Thomopoulos, whom she had first met in 1979 when he was the head of the ABC Television Network and she was auditioning for a sport on \"Good Morning America\". They had met again years later, and Ferrare knew she would marry him on their first date. They have been happily married for 22 years and have two daughters.\n\nIn addition to her TV appearances, she has written books, including \"Cristina Ferrare's Family Entertaining\", \"Okay, So I Don't Have a Headache\", and \"Realistically Ever After\". Ferrare also works for Creative Brands Group, designing jewelry, home accessories and furniture."
