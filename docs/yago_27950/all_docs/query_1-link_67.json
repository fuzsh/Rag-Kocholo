        "text": "Some of the cast members from Mrs. Doubtfire reunited for the 25th anniversary of the classic '90s comedy. They gathered on NBC and spoke with Gadi Schwartz about what it was like to film on set, and the experiences they had with the late comedic icon, Robin Williams. Pierce Brosnan, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson and Lisa Jakub were in attendance. Wilson, who played Williams' youngest daughter in the film, Natalie, said they hadn't all been together for 25 years, but they all agreed that it felt like little time had passed.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nThe cast reminisced about Williams, who died in 2014 at the age of 63, after a battle with severe depression.\n\nJakub, who played Williams' older daughter, Lydia, mentioned how open Williams was about his mental health issues, and how those conversations have stayed with her throughout her life.\n\n“One of the most powerful things for me about working with him is that he was very open and honest with me talking about his issues with addiction, depression, and that was so powerful to me at 14. I have struggled with anxiety my whole life,” Jakub said.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\nLawrence, who played Williams' son, Chris, said that Williams was \"a guiding force\" while on set.\n\n\"Like he would just, all of a sudden out of the blue, look over to me like, ‘By the way, don’t do drugs! Really messed up my brain! I’m serious. Do not do them.’ I was like, ‘Okay!’ That stuck with me,” Lawrence said.\n\nBrosnan, who played Williams' ex-wife's (Sally Fields) new partner, added in memories about filming the restaurant scene with Williams, and how difficult it was to keep it together while shooting.\n\nLoading\n\nPlay\n\n“Robin is there as Mrs. Doubtfire and he just unleashed the most bluest, the craziest innuendos about Sally’s character,\" he said.\n\nThey all agreed that every take Williams did would be different from the previous. \"Every take was something new and different and obviously amazing,\" Lawrence said.\n\nTo reminisce yourself on the late Robin Williams and the laughs he brought to so many, read our piece about the appreciation we have for him and how he gave us all so much goodness. Jessie Wade is a news writer for IGN and loves Robin Williams in all of his roles. Hook, Goodwill Hunting, Mrs. Doubtfire, Jumanji, and Aladdin are just some of her favorites.
