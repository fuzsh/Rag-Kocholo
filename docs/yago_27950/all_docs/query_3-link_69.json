        "text": "Actor Robin Williams' recent death struck a sorrowful chord with millions of people this week.\n\nFrom his comedic roles in \"Mork and Mindy\" and \"Mrs. Doubtfire,\" which made him famous, to the dramatic parts he played in \"Dead Poet's Society\" and \"Good Will Hunting,\" which won Williams accolades and awards, he was a favorite in American homes and theaters for more than 30 years. He was found dead Monday after committing suicide.\n\nWilliams, 63, always seemed approachable — someone people would like to visit with if given the chance. For a brief period 17 years ago, at least one Montana man did.\n\n\"I'm still in disbelief,\" said Craig Iron Pipe of Robin Williams' death. \"To watch him on set and see how he handled himself and how he treated people — the guy was a very, very kind person and awesome to be around. He will be greatly missed.\"\n\nIn the summer of 1997, Williams came to Montana to film portions of \"What Dreams May Come.\" Several segments of the movie were shot in Glacier National Park, and Iron Pipe was a part of the production crew that helped make that happen.\n\n\"I worked for the movie company's transportation department,\" he said. \"I drove the set-up crews and some of the stunt people around, so I'd run into all the main actors all the time and get to visit with them now and then.\"\n\nThe production of \"What Dreams May Come\" came during a high point of Williams' film career. Two of his most successful movies, \"Jumanji\" and \"The Birdcage,\" had opened in theaters over the two preceding years, and filming had recently wrapped up on \"Good Will Hunting,\" a movie for which Williams would win a best supporting actor Oscar in 1998.\n\nBut even though his career was at its zenith, Williams' star was never so bright that he ignored the common people around him. In the final days before the cast and crew of \"What Dreams May Come\" left Montana, Williams paid for a party out of his own pocket and invited everyone to it. Then he stuck around and greeted all his guests; regardless of whether they were Hollywood stars or temporary hired help.\n\n\"For him to do that — to fork out the money to hire a caterer and put on a nice meal and entertain the whole cast and crew — that was something special,\" Iron Pipe said. \"He was there mingling with everybody. It wasn't just like some millionaire who got a caterer and then went off and did something else. He was right there. It was welcoming and it was something heartfelt. You could see it in his eyes and in the attention he would give you. He was a very kind soul.\"\n\nWilliams even took a few minutes to greet Iron Pipe personally, and to meet his wife and daughter. The event was a special one for 2½ year-old Lily Iron Pipe.\n\n\"Her favorite movie at the time was 'Mrs. Doubtfire,'\" Iron Pipe said. \"At the party he put on, I introduced my wife, Billie Jo, to Mr. Williams and I told my daughter, 'This is Mrs. Doubtfire.'\"\n\nThe little girl looked up dubiously at the strange man in front of her, who was not in costume and looked suspiciously unlike the Scottish nanny from the hit movie from 1993.\n\n\"I told Mr. Williams that 'Mrs. Doubtfire' was her favorite movie, so he immediately went into character for a few minutes,\" Iron Pipe said. \"You should have seen her eyes brighten up. It was just amazing for her. That was her hero at the time, and there he was right in front of her. It was awesome.\"\n\nIron Pipe was not simply some star-struck fan who had never been in the presence of Hollywood celebrities before. From the late 1980s on through to the early 2000s, Iron Pipe regularly worked in the film industry. He worked as a stunt man specializing in horseback scenes, and is credited with bit parts in several movies such as \"War Party,\" \"Blood Trail\" and \"Geronimo: An American Legend,\" starring Gene Hackman, Robert Duvall, Matt Damon and Wes Studi.\n\n\"I ran into a lot of phony people,\" Iron Pipe said of his decades-long experience in film. \"They were out there trying to impress somebody, but not the crew and not regular common people. A lot of them get lost; they lose who they are as a human being.\"\n\nAccording to Iron Pipe, Williams, was a big exception to that observation.\n\n\"He didn't have the intimidation factor at all,\" he said. \"To me he was a really kind soul.\""
