Have an account? .\n\nRobin Williams would've turned 71 on July 21, had he not died in August 2014.\n\nOver the course of his decades-long career, he was in at least 63 movies, ranging from stinkers to hits.\n\nHe was nominated for three Oscars, winning for his best-reviewed film, \"Good Will Hunting.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe lowest-rated film of Robin Williams' career is the 2009 comedy \"Old Dogs,\" which has a 5% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 5%\n\nIn \"Old Dogs,\" Williams and Travolta co-star as two best friends, Dan and Charlie, who must team up to take care of Dan's newly discovered children after their mother is arrested while protesting.\n\n\"It all plods along to a familiar happy ending that is supposed to leave its audience feeling warm and fuzzy. I'll admit the ending made me happy, because it signaled the end to this miserable movie,\" wrote Bowling Green Daily News' Micheal Compton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNext up is the 2007 film \"License to Wed,\" in which he plays Reverend Frank Littleton, a priest who is testing an engaged couple's relationship during pre-marriage counseling.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 7%\n\nSandy (Mandy Moore) and Ben (John Krasinski) return to Mandy's hometown in order to receive pre-marriage counseling from Mandy's eccentric priest Reverend Frank (Williams), who seems hell-bent on breaking their engagement up.\n\n\"It's exactly what it looks like from the commercials — a one-joke movie, and that one joke isn't even funny to begin with,\" wrote the Associated Press' Christy Lemire.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe plays another priest in the 2013 comedy \"The Big Wedding.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 7%\n\n\"The Big Wedding\" focuses on the extended Griffin family who reunite for the wedding of adopted son Alejandro (Ben Barnes) and his fiancée Missy (Amanda Seyfried). Williams has a small role as the wedding's eccentric officiant.\n\n\"Big wedding? Big fat nothing, more like,\" wrote Charlotte O'Sullivan of the London Evening Standard.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 2014 film \"The Angriest Man in Brooklyn,\" he plays the titular angriest man in Brooklyn who finds out he may have just 90 minutes to live.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 9%\n\nWhen Henry (Williams) finds out that a brain aneurysm may very well kill him in 90 minutes, he makes it his biggest priority to reconnect with friends and family before it's too late.\n\n\"The film never quite manages to figure out what it's actually about,\" wrote Bilge Ebiri of Vulture.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams co-stars with Walter Matthau in the 1983 comedy \"The Survivors.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 9%\n\nMatthau and Williams team up as two men who meet on the unemployment line and witness a murder by a hit man by accident. When it becomes clear that the hit man (Jerry Reed) is now after them, Williams' character Donald enrolls them both in survivalist school to learn how to defends themselves.\n\n\"No one seems to have paid any attention to the screenplay or to have considered the awful truth that Mr. Matthau and Mr. Williams, each performers of great charm, don't play together very well,\" wrote The New York Times' Vincent Canby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe plays a mentally disabled janitor in David Duchovny's 2004 directorial debut, \"House of D.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 10%\n\n\"House of D\" mostly takes place in 1973, when teenager Tom (Anton Yelchin) meets a mentally disabled man Pappass (Williams) and becomes good friends with him. Tom also develops a crush on his schoolmate Melissa (played by Williams' daughter Zelda).\n\n\"'House of D' never feels honest, but when Duchovny consciously tries to score sentiment points, the strain is more than the film can handle,\" wrote Tasha Robinson of the AV Club.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams has a role in the 1986 comedy \"Club Paradise\" alongside Peter O'Toole, Rick Moranis, Twiggy, Eugene Levy, and more.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 11%\n\nWilliams stars as retired firefighter Jack Moniker who opens a resort on a tropical island with a reggae singer, played by Jimmy Reed. Over the course of the film, they deal with eager tourists, eccentric locals, and greedy land developers who wish to stop them.\n\n\"A frenetically unfunny and charmless movie,\" wrote the Los Angeles Times' Sheila Benson.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"A Merry Friggin' Christmas,\" released in November 2014, was the first of three films released after Williams' death in August 2014.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 14%\n\nIn \"A Merry Friggin' Christmas,\" Williams plays an eccentric father, Mitch. His son, Boyd (Joel McHale), is forced to spend Christmas Eve at his parents' house, and team up with his father to race home on Christmas morning to help his son open presents.\n\n\"Whereas 'Bad Santa' was nastier and riskier, as well as more mischievously winsome, 'A Merry Friggin' Christmas' is as curiously timid as it is morally dubious,\" wrote Slant Magazine's Nick Prigge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe plays a young boy in the body of a 40-year-old man in the 1996 film \"Jack.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 17%\n\nJack (Williams) is born after his mother is pregnant for just 10 weeks, but is somehow the size of a full-term baby. He is diagnosed with a rare genetic disorder that makes his body age rapidly — meaning that, for most of the movie, he's a 10-year-old in the body of a 40-year-old.\n\n\"Mr. Williams is lively and sometimes touching, but this is one of his less freewheeling performances, with little room for spontaneity in the film's mostly conventional scheme,\" wrote The New York Times' Janet Maslin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams voices a dog, Dennis, in the 2015 sci-fi comedy \"Absolutely Anything.\" This was his final film role.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 20%\n\n\"Absolutely Anything\" focuses on Simon Pegg's Neil Clarke, who is empowered by a race of aliens to do whatever he wants, in order to determine if humanity is worth saving or not.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter's Stephen Dalton wrote, \"'Absolutely Anything' is a good idea but is executed poorly, with a lame take-home message about great power demanding great responsibility.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 2006 political satire \"Man of the Year,\" he plays a Jon Stewart-esque figure who runs for president, and wins.\n\nRotten Tomaotes score: 21%\n\nWilliams plays Tom Dobbs, the host a political satire show a la \"The Daily Show.\" After an audience suggestion that he runs for president gains steam, Dobbs actually announces his campaign and begins to gain steam, while an employee at a voting machine company begins to notice discrepancies.\n\nCath Clarke of The Guardian wrote, \"Cynicism or stupidity? It's hard to say which has the run of this idiotic satire in which Robin Williams plays a talk-show host who runs for president on a ticket of cleaning up politics.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile critics didn't love the 1998 film \"Patch Adams,\" it connected with audiences.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 22%\n\n\"Patch Adams\" is based on a real doctor, Dr. Hunter \"Patch\" Adams, who decides to change the way that doctors view patient care by opening his own clinic for those without insurance. While some critics didn't appreciate the film's sugary sweet tone, it scored a 73% with audiences.\n\n\"Shamelessly sappy and emotionally manipulative, 'Patch Adams' is an aggressively heartwarming comedy-drama that may be roasted by critics but embraced by ticket buyers,\" wrote Joe Leydon for Variety.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Flubber,\" released in 1997, Williams plays an absent-minded scientist who creates flying rubber, or \"flubber.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 24%\n\nBased on the 1961 film \"The Absent-Minded Professor,\" Williams plays the single-minded Professor Philip Brainard, who is so committed to his cause that he misses his own wedding three times. Instead, he creates a mysterious kinetic goo that he names \"flubber\" that has the power to change the world.\n\n\"It's pointless, soulless, humorless and relentlessly unimaginative,\" wrote The Baltimore Sun's Chris Kaltenbach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe plays a dad desperate to reconnect with his family on vacation in the 2006 road-trip comedy \"RV.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 24%\n\nWilliams stars as the patriarch of the Munro family, Bob, who takes his entire family on an RV road-trip to reconnect before it's too late. His wife Jamie is played by Cheryl Hines, while his two kids are played by Joanna Levesque (aka JoJo) and Josh Hutcherson.\n\n\"It will likely escape no one's attention that 'RV' is a direct crib from the marginally more entertaining and kinda-sorta transgressive series of 'National Lampoon's Vacation' films,\" wrote Marc Savlov of the Austin Chronicle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe united with his friend Billy Crystal in the 1997 comedy \"Fathers' Day.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 25%\n\nWhen teenager Scott goes missing, his mother enlists two of her old flames, Dale (Williams) and Jack (Crystal) to find him by telling them both that they're Scott's dad. When they realize her lie, they decide to team up and find Scott together, regardless of who Scott's real dad is.\n\n\"A movie of implacable unfunniness,\" wrote Wall Street Journal's Joe Morgenstern.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams has a supporting role as an OB-GYN in the 1995 rom-com \"Nine Months,\" which stars Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 25%\n\n\"Nine Months\" mainly focuses on Grant and Moore's characters, Samuel and Rebecca, who discover that Rebecca is pregnant — and Samuel isn't too pleased about it. Over the course of nine months, they both evaluate what they want from their lives and their relationship. Williams plays Rebecca's OB-GYN in a typically odd performance.\n\n\"Any charm he might possess has been squeezed out by the Hollywood machine, and the little shots of Hugh rollerblading, or Hugh getting his ears pierced, are scarcely enough to create new endearments,\" wrote The Times UK's Geoff Brown.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams has an uncredited role as a celebrity visiting the titular psychologist in the 2009 indie \"Shrink.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 27%\n\nKevin Spacey stars as a therapist to the stars, Henry Crane, who is secretly experiencing his own mental health crisis. But when he meets would-be screenwriter Jemma (Keke Palmer), Henry is forced to confront his demons. Williams has an uncredited role as one of Henry's patients, Jack Holden, an A-lister who denies he's an alcoholic.\n\n\"A limply-organized multi-story snooze-fest from Jonas Pate,\" wrote The Daily Telegraph's Tim Robey.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams is also uncredited in the 2004 holiday film \"Noel.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 28%\n\nFour seemingly unrelated New Yorkers intersect across the holiday season. Williams has a small role involving Susan Sarandon's character Rose, whose mother is living in the hospital due to her Alzheimer's diagnosis.\n\n\"Except for die-hard students of extremely bad movies, 'Noel' isn't worth seeing,\" wrote the New York Post's Lou Lumenick.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe took the role of an adult Peter Pan who forgot all about Neverland in the 1991 classic \"Hook.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 29%\n\n\"Hook\" is another Williams vehicle that has a low critics' score, but a high audience one, pulling a 76%. Williams plays Peter Banning, a distracted father who must return to Neverland after Captain Hook (Dustin Hoffman) kidnaps his kids — only Peter doesn't have any memory of his time with the Lost Boys, Tinker Bell, or anything to do with Neverland, not even that he's Peter Pan.\n\n\"What Williams brings to Peter though isn't just his effervescence, it's his pathos and vulnerability. He's a scared, confused man just hoping to save his kids and that core of love and humanity is what makes 'Hook' work for those of us that love it,\" wrote Jessica Mason of The Mary Sue.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 1999 Holocaust film \"Jakob the Liar,\" Williams plays a Polish shopkeeper who tells tall tales to keep the Jewish residents of the ghetto hopeful.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 29%\n\nIn \"Jakob the Liar,\" Williams plays the titular Jakob, a Jewish tailor living in a Polish ghetto during World War II. While listening to the radio in his shop, he overhears Soviet plans and rumors spread among the residents. He decides to use this newfound power to spread hope amongst his neighbors, potentially at the cost of his own safety.\n\n\"I prefer 'Life Is Beautiful,' which is clearly a fantasy, to 'Jakob the Liar,' which is just as contrived and manipulative but pretends it is not,\" wrote Roger Ebert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams plays a toy-maker who has to go up against his brother in the 1992 film \"Toys.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 29%\n\nWilliams plays the childlike toy-maker Leslie Zevo, while Michael Gambon plays his brother Leland. When their older brother leaves the family's toy factory to the power-hungry Leland, Leslie must use his love of toys to defeat his brother, who's using toys to create weapons.\n\n\"No child I know would benefit from seeing this work, and certainly no adult,\" wrote Vanessa Letts of The Spectator.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe plays a man committing insurance fraud to help pay for his wife's Tourette treatments in the black comedy \"The Big White,\" released in 2005.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 30%\n\nWilliams plays Paul Barnell, a man who finds a dead body and, in order to receive an insurance payout on his missing brother's life insurance policy, attempts to pass off the body as his brother, which works ... until his brother Raymond (Woody Harrelson) returns.\n\n\"The director here is a bright British spark, Mark Mylod, but there's nothing he can do with a script so dire,\" wrote Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams and Kurt Russell co-star as two best friends trying to relive their high school glory days in the 1986 comedy \"The Best of Times.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 31%\n\nTwo childhood best friends Jack (Williams) and Reno (Russell) reunite decades after a fateful high school football seemingly changed the course of their lives. To get things back on track, they try to re-stage the game and relive their glory days.\n\n\"Such a rouser that it almost makes up for the incomplete passes and stopped runs that precede it,\" wrote Walter Goodman for The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"Bicentennial Man,\" released in 1999, Williams stars as a robot, Andrew, who slowly becomes more and more human over decades.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 36%\n\n\"Bicentennial Man\" follows Williams as Andrew, an advanced kind of robot who begins the film as a glorified household appliance and evolves into a complex being capable of creativity, love, and the full spectrum of human emotion.\n\n\"One could describe this movie as the story of a woman (Embeth Davidtz) who falls in love with a household appliance (Robin Williams). But that would make it sound funny. While there are a few good jokes scattered about, this is, alas, yet another of Williams's earnest attempts to make us all Better, More Sensitive People,\" wrote Newsweek's David Ansen.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe plays a selfish street musician named Wizard in 2007's \"August Rush.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 37%\n\n\"August Rush\" stars Freddie Highmore as a young orphan who is also a musical prodigy. He runs away from his home to try and find his birth parents, meeting many characters along the way, including Williams' Wizard, an NYC busker who tries to exploit August's talents for himself.\n\nPeter Bradshaw of the Guardian wrote, \"Watching this yucky emotional drama is like being sprayed with treacle from a high-pressure hose.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn \"The Final Cut,\" released in 2004, Williams plays a man who has the ability to edit people's memories.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 37%\n\nIn the future of \"The Final Cut,\" human beings are equipped with microchips that record their entire lives. \"Cutters,\" like Williams' Alan, have access to a person's memories after they die, in order to edit out anything less than flattering. And when Alan is offered $500,000 to turn over someone's memories, he falls down a rabbit hole.\n\n\"A shtick-free Robin Williams underplays so much he makes his morose loner in 'One Hour Photo' look like Mork,\" wrote Variety's Leslie Felperin.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe plays a radio host who becomes concerned he's being conned in the the 2006 thriller \"The Night Listener.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 40%\n\nWilliams plays a gay radio host, Gabriel, who develops a friendship with Pete (Rory Culkin), a young teenager living with HIV who confides in Gabriel about his horrible upbringing. Along the way, Gabriel becomes close with Peter's mother (Toni Collette), but before long, Gabriel begins to question the existence of Peter at all.\n\n\"Mr. Williams, in one of his blessedly shtick-free performances, effectively conveys Gabriel's weary, worried stoicism, but the movie limits his character to a few easy, literal motivations,\" wrote A.O. Scott of The New York Times.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 2006 animated film \"Everyone's Hero,\" he plays the corrupt general manager of the Chicago Cubs, Napoleon Cross.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 42%\n\n\"Everyone's Hero,\" directed by the late Christopher Reeves, is about a young baseball fanatic in the 1930s who decides to make a cross-country trip to reunite Babe Ruth with his anthropomorphic baseball bat, voiced by Whoopi Goldberg. Williams plays the corrupt manager of the Chicago Cubs who orchestrated the theft of the bat.\n\n\"This animated ode to baseball feels like it arrived in a time machine from the distant past when G-rated children's movies got their message across without sarcasm, innuendo, and pop-culture references,\" wrote the Austin Chronicle's Brian Clark.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams co-stars with Ed Norton in the Danny DeVito-directed comedy \"Death to Smoochy,\" which was released in 2002.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 43%\n\nIn \"Death to Smoochy,\" Williams plays a Mr. Rogers-esque figure named \"Rainbow\" Randolph Smiley, who actually lives a seedier lifestyle than he'd have anyone believe. After he's arrested by the FBI, he plots to take down his successor, Sheldon Mopes, who goes on stage as a rhino named Smoochy.\n\n\"'Death to Smoochy' is all noise with very little fun, and almost no restraint,\" wrote Stephanie Zacharek of Salon.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams took on the role of Teddy Roosevelt for the first time in the 2006 fantasy film \"Night at the Museum.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 43%\n\nThe first \"Night at the Museum\" focuses on the night watchman at New York City's Musuem of Natural History, Larry (Ben Stiller), who is amazed when the exhibits come to life at night.\n\n\"What a dull, nice movie, wrenched from a wild premise and battered into docility,\" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Lisa Schwarzbaum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe's credited under the pseudonym Marty Fromage in the 1991 comedy \"Shakes the Clown.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 43%\n\n\"Shakes the Clown\" is mainly focused on a clown, Shakes, who is down-on-his-luck and becomes an alcoholic, played by Bobcat Goldthwait. Williams, credited as Marty Fromage, has a cameo as a mime, aptly named Mime Jerry.\n\n\"The movie plays like a series of scene outlines — ideas for how the movie should progress — that needed more writing and revision before the actors were called in,\" wrote Roger Ebert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams co-stars with Annette Bening and Ed Harris in the 2013 drama \"The Face of Love.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 43%\n\n\"The Face of Love\" follows Nikki (Bening) as a widow who falls in love with a man, Tom (Harris), who looks suspiciously liked her dead husband Garrett. Williams plays Nikki's neighbor, Roger, who is harboring feelings for her.\n\n\"The actors, though, lift the material. The most poignant performance comes from the late Robin Williams in a cameo as Nikki's neighbor and friend,\" wrote Geoffrey Macnab of the Independent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams suited up again to play Roosevelt in the 2009 sequel \"Night at the Museum: Battle of the Smithsonian.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 44%\n\n\"Battle of the Smithsonian\" takes the action to Washington, DC, inside the Smithsonian Museum, where their mystical power is brought to one of the largest museum's in the world, causing chaos.\n\n\"Robin Williams, as well, explodes every single time he's onscreen in a performance with even more spark and humor than in the original,\" wrote The Independent Critic's Richard Propes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams also returned to voice multiple characters in the 2011 sequel to \"Happy Feet,\" \"Happy Feet Two.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 45%\n\nIn \"Happy Feet Two,\" Williams' plays the main character Mumble's (Elijah Wood) two best friends: Ramón, a laid-back Adélie penguin who speaks with a heavy accent, and Lovelace, a rockhopper penguin who coasts by on vibes alone.\n\n\"If there's a saving grace, it's the visuals, especially the beautiful scenes of orange krill. But that's about all,\" wrote Time Out's Derek Adams.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams' final live-action film role was the 2014 film \"Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb,\" which was also the final film in the trilogy.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 47%\n\n\"Secret of the Tomb\" concluded the (live-action) \"Night at the Museum\" trilogy, as the whole gang flies to the British Museum to see why their magic has been fading and causing problems at the Museum of Natural History. Williams' final scene as Roosevelt remains heartbreaking, almost 10 years later.\n\n\"The most poignant moment is the farewell to Roosevelt, played one final time by Robin Williams. Otherwise, 'Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb' is an instance of an idea stretched far beyond its potential,\" wrote Udita Jhunjhunwala of Livemint.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams played the Professor in the 1996 thriller \"The Secret Agent,\" based on the 1907 novel of the same name. He was also uncredited for this film.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 50%\n\n\"The Secret Agent\" follows a (presumed) Russian spy named Adolf Verloc (Bob Hoskins) ans his group of fellow terrorists, the FP, or Future of the Proletariat. Williams has a small role as one of the members of the FP, only named the Professor, who is obsessed with making bombs.\n\n\"As Conrad observed often in his work, the deliberate rejection of pity, empathy, and order (aka evil) is seductive because of the total freedom it offers. The character who embodies this principle in 'The Secret Agent' is a Mephistophelian bomb-maker called The Professor, played with startling brilliance by an uncredited Robin Williams,\" wrote the Austin Chronicle's Russell Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 2014 drama \"Boulevard,\" Williams plays a closeted banker who connects with a young sex worker.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 52%\n\nWilliams stars as Nolan Mack, a closeted man who has been married for 26 years to a woman named Joy (Kathy Baker).

Williams stars as the adult version of Alan Parrish, who got sucked into the game while playing in 1969 and is released 26 years later when Judy (Kirsten Dunst) and Peter (Bradley Pierce) begin a new game.\n\n\"It's inevitable that the technology both overwhelms the human cast and stalls the narrative drive. Even Williams's manic energy finally flags,\" wrote the Washington Post's Rita Kempley.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBased on the 1978 novel of the same name, 1998's \"What Dreams May Come\" follows Chris Nielsen, a doctor who dies in a car crash and is sent to his own personal heaven.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 53%\n\nAfter Chris (Williams) dies in a car accident, he's sent to his own version of heaven — but whe his wife Annie (Annabella Sciorra) commits suicide in her grief, Chris dedicates his afterlife to finding her and rescuing her from her own personal hell.\n\n\"Robin Williams ... gives an achingly sincere performance, and by the end it's hard to avoid the feeling that this much sincerity is too much,\" wrote Entertainment Weekly's Josh Wolk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams plays five different reincarnations of the same man in the 1994 film \"Being Human.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 54%\n\n\"Being Human\" follows a soul, Hector, across five different reincarnations: as a caveman, a slave in Ancient Rome, a Scottish crusader, a Portuguese shipwrecked man in the Renaissance, and a modern '90s man living in New York City.\n\n\"The stories are low-key and deliberately anti-climactic, but they coalesce into a tender, contemplative whole that's profound and moving,\" reads Time Out's review.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams stars as a car salesman whose dealership gets taken hostage in 1990's \"Cadillac Man.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 55%\n\nWilliams plays Joey O'Brien, a car salesman who is dealing with rising alimony payments, two mistresses, an outstanding loan to the Mafia, and a deadline to sell 12 cars in two days or lose his job. When his dealership is taken hostage by Larry (Tim Robbins), Joey must figure out how to solve yet another problem.\n\n\"My problems with 'Cadillac Man' were probably inspired more by false expectations than by anything on the screen, and maybe if Robbins had come crashing in through the window in the first scene I would have liked it more,\" wrote Roger Ebert.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn his first leading role, Williams took on the legendary cartoon sailor Popeye in the 1980 film of the same name.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 57%\n\nWilliams stars as Popeye, a spinach-loving pirate, while Shelley Duvall plays the object of his desires, Olive Oyl, as they try to raise their adopted child Swee'Pea while staying away from Olive's jilted fiancé Bluto (Paul L.

He worked in the White House for 34 years, seeing many historical events. Williams plays President Dwight D. Eisenhower, the first president during Cecil's tenure.\n\n\"Because we've seen the elements of this genre before, the film severely telegraphs its emotional beats ...

You'll laugh, though Robin Williams will not be denied,\" wrote The Miami Herald's Bill Cosford.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the 1988 Woody Allen film \"Deconstructing Harry,\" Williams plays a stand-in for Allen's character Harry, named Mel.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 73%\n\nIn one of Allen's more meta films, \"Deconstructing Harry\" sees Harry (Allen) be confronted by both people in his real life and fictional characters he's constructed. Williams plays the fictional version of Harry in the film, named Mel, who begins sliding out of focus as Harry's perception of himself becomes damaged.\n\n\"'Deconstructing Harry' is abrasive, complex, lacerating and self-revelatory. It's also very funny, most of the time,\" wrote Variety's David Stratton.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe stars as the titular Garp in the 1982 film \"The World According to Garp.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 74%\n\n\"Garp\" sees Williams star as the titular Garp, a man born out of wedlock to a radical feminist who then becomes a writer and has an unique life.\n\nAs Molly Haskell of Vogue wrote, \"Casting Robin Williams in the role was a stroke of genius.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams voices three characters (Ramón, Lovelace, and Cletus) in 2006's \"Happy Feet.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 76%\n\nThe first \"Happy Feet\" focuses on a penguin, Mumble (Elijah Wood), who, instead of singing like all the other penguins, is a talented dancer.

Williams plays a friend of Mike's, a psychologist who encourages the visits with Madson.\n\n\"As the twists come thick and fast and the plot gets progressively more and more baroque, Branagh shows himself to be at least as intelligent as Brian De Palma in delivering over-the-top stylistic filigree,\" wrote the Chicago Reader's Jonathan Rosenbaum.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe played against type in the 2002 thriller \"One Hour Photo.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 81%\n\nWilliams plays a socially awkward and isolated photo technician, Sy, at a one-hour photo counter in a Walmart-esque store called SavMart. He's obsessed with the Yorkin family, who have been developing their photos at his store for years. But when Sy realizes that the Yorkins aren't as picture-perfect as he believed, he snaps.\n\n\"'One Hour Photo' is a very well-made thriller. It shows us Robin Williams extending his acting range into unusual and disturbing material. And as well as causing acute anxiety in its last reels, it delivers a more moral message than most of its kind,\" wrote the London Evening Standard's Alexander Walker.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams stars as the flamboyant drag club owner Armand in 1996's \"The Birdcage.\"\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 82%\n\nBased on the French film \"La Cage aux Folles,\" \"The Birdcage\" stars Williams and Nathan Lane as a gay couple living in Miami who must pretend to be straight after their son announces his intentions to marry a woman with conservative parents.

It's all very \"Dear Evan Hansen.\"\n\n\"Williams is terrific as the downtrodden Lance, who guiltily seizes his chance of fame. The film's direction isn't always confident — there are baggy sections, and it's rarely deeply moving — but it is consistently funny,\" wrote Metro UK's Anna Smith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWilliams plays a painfully shy doctor who connects with comatose patients in the 1990 film \"Awakenings,\" based on a true story.\n\nRotten Tomatoes score: 89%\n\nBased on a true story, \"Awakenings\" stars Williams as a neurologist who discovers the effects of a medicine on a group of catatonic patients who were affected by an epidemic of encephalitis. Dr. Sayer (Williams) bonds with one of the awakened patients, Leonard (Robert De Niro) and learns to change his life.\n\n\"Williams gives his best 'straight' performance, shorn of all his marvelous manic vaudeville.

He's plagued with insomnia after accidentally (or maybe not accidentally) shooting his partner. All the while, he's investigating local crime writer Walter Finch (Williams).\n\n\"With a run-of-the-mill bad-guy actor playing chief suspect Walter Finch, the movie might have tipped too far Pacino's way.
