        "text": "VOICE OVER: Rebecca Brayton\n\nWhile some of his most critically-acclaimed roles have been in dramas, there is no doubt that Robin Williams is a comedian through-and-through. He made his start on television as the lovable Mork from Ork on the sitcom Mork and Mindy, and quickly jumped to the big screen in the live action adaptation of Popeye. Award nominations piled up for the actor due to films like Moscow on the Hudson, but it was in the 1990s that Williams began his string of popular, family-friendly comedy films. Hook, Aladdin and Mrs. Doubtfire are just a few of the titles that solidified Williams' reputation as a comedy genius. In this video, http://www.WatchMojo.com learns more about the comedy origins of Robin Williams.\n\nThe Comedy Career of Robin Williams\n\nYou can’t describe this comedian without using the word “manic.” Take a look back at the comedy origins of Robin Williams.\n\nEarly Years\n\nRobin McLaurim Williams was born July 21st, 1951 in Chicago, Illinois. After studying at New York’s Julliard School for three years, Williams continued practicing stand-up. In his madcap comedy routines, he seemingly followed any tangent that entered his mind to its illogical and hilarious conclusion.\n\nMork and Mindy\n\nWilliams also had small parts on television, including “The Richard Pryor Show,” and “Happy Days.” The popularity of that appearance led to Williams’ first big break. In 1978, “Mork and Mindy” debuted, and Williams portrayed an alien sent to earth to observe humans. Eventually, his comedy idol Jonathan Winters also joined the cast. Williams’ spontaneity was evident, and scripts allowed for his improvisations. However, it was also around this time that the comedian began to struggle with drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nJump to Film\n\nWilliams made the jump to film in 1980 in the live action “Popeye” movie, which highlighted his talent at voice mimicry. He then took on more dramatic roles. This was followed by a Golden Globe-nominated performance in the 1984 comedy-drama, “Moscow on the Hudson.” Williams’ mastery of dialect was evident in his portrayal of a Russian man in the United States.\n\nGood Morning, Vietnam\n\nIn 1986, he began hosting “Comic Relief” with fellow comedians Billy Crystal and Whoopi Goldberg. Williams’ career continued to soar with another highly-acclaimed performance in 1987’s “Good Morning, Vietnam.” The highly improvised role earned him a Golden Globe and an Academy Award nomination.\n\nThe Fischer King\n\nIn 1988, he took on a role in the Terry Gilliam comedy “The Adventures of Baron Munchausen.” Following that, Williams focused on drama for a few years, and then appeared in another Terry Gilliam production. His character in 1991’s “The Fisher King” allowed him to showcase both his dramatic talent and the spontaneous energy for which he was known, and it won him another Golden Globe and an Oscar nomination.\n\nHook\n\nThat same year he appeared opposite Dustin Hoffman as an aging Peter Pan in the hit family film, “Hook.” This movie allowed Williams to portray both a middle-aged businessman and his youthful alter ego.\n\nAnimated Films\n\nWilliams also took on a couple of voice roles in animated features that year. First came his turn as the Genie in Disney’s “Aladdin.” This role proved the importance of voice talent to an animated film, as he ad-libbed much of his dialogue. Then came his role as a confused bat in the environmentally-conscious cartoon “FernGully: The Last Rainforest.”\n\nMrs. Doubtfire\n\n1993 saw Williams don a fat suit, wig, mask and a muddled British accent to play the title role in “Mrs. Doubtfire.” That part allowed Williams to once again do what he does best.\n\nVaried Comedy Roles\n\nHe continued his string of family-oriented comedies in 1995 with “Jumanji.” He also provided comic relief as a Russian doctor in “Nine Months.” Following that, Williams was a big kid in “Jack.” Also in 1996 came “The Birdcage,” where he portrayed a drag nightclub owner trying to play it straight to impress his son’s fiancée’s family. While he could have shown his flamboyant side in that role, Williams was – for the most part – restrained.\n\nThe comedies “Flubber” and “Father’s Day” followed in 1997. The next year, he appeared as a doctor who used humor to cheer up his patients in the Golden Globe-nominated role “Patch Adams.”\n\nMore dramatic turns ensued, as well as a few dark comedies, most notably the cult film “Death to Smoochy.”\n\nOn-Stage Comedy, and the 2000s\n\n2002 was the year his comedy DVD “Robin Williams: Live on Broadway” was released as a follow-up to his popular stand-up specials of the late 1970s and ‘80s. Since then, his film choices have included independent films, dramas, family films, and – of course – comedies. And, he concluded his “Weapons of Self Destruction” comedy tour in 2009.\n\nDramatic Work\n\nThough he is one of the funniest men in Hollywood, Williams’ talents as an actor have also translated into drama. Over the years, his roles in “Dead Poets Society,” “Awakenings,” and “August Rush” have earned him much acclaim, and “Good Will Hunting” even won him an Oscar.\n\nLegacy\n\nRobin Williams’ irreverent, madcap humor, impersonations and hilarious tangents have made him a beloved comedian the world over."
