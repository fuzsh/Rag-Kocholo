        "text": "Thirty years ago this week, Robin Williams donned a wig and transformed into “Mrs. Doubtfire.”\n\nThe cross-dressing comedy about a divorced actor who disguises himself as an older female housekeeper to be able to see his children was shot in and around San Francisco. Released Nov. 22, 1993, it became one of Williams’ biggest hits, earning more than $200 million at the domestic box office and inspiring the phrase, “run-by fruiting,“ from a scene in which Williams hurls a lime at co-star Pierce Brosnan’s head.\n\nWhat many audience members at the time did not know, was that the bartender in that run-by fruiting scene was played by Robin’s older brother, Sonoma County winery owner Robert Todd Williams, in his only film role.\n\nRobert, who went by \"Dr. Toad\" in the film’s credits and often went by Todd in real life, may not have been a movie star, but he was a showman in Sonoma County, where he cofounded Toad Hollow Vineyards with Rodney Strong in 1993 and turned the tiny boutique winery into a 120,000-case operation before his death in 2007.\n\nRobin got Todd the role of the bartender in “Mrs. Doubtfire” because that was what Todd did for many years in San Francisco, Chicago and even Kingston, Jamaica, before getting into the wine business, according to a 2007 Press Democrat article.\n\n\"People just loved to come and sit with him and tell stories and shake dice,\" Frankie Williams, Todd’s wife of 29 years, told the Press Democrat in 2007.\n\n\"He touched a lot of people in the winery business,\" Robin Williams remembered of his brother in 2007. \"He was just an honorable man, and in times when that's really needed. He was a man who lived a great life. He leaves a big footprint — a big footprint, with a cork.\""
