        "text": "I just watched Being Robin.\n\nIt’s a remarkable film, and not anything that I expected. It’s, above all else, courageous. You explore something so personal – but the story is as compelling as any Hollywood picture. It also demonstrates your amazing acting skills. I know you are reenacting true episodes of your life, but doesn’t make the performance any less spectacular. It never rings false. It never feels written. It feels experienced, and as an audience member I am experiencing too. Sometimes it made me very uncomfortable, but you are skillfully (artfully) sharing your story and the dark side is part of that. I liked — or am relieved — how it ended…. a sensational work of theatre."
