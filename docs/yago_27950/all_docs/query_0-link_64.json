        "text": "\"We would have exactly what was scripted, and then Robin would go off and it was something to behold,\" Columbus says.\n\n\"It got to the point that I had to shoot the entire movie with four cameras to keep up with him,\" the director continues. \"None of us knew what he was going to say when he got going, and so I wanted a camera on the other actors to get their reactions. For Pierce Brosnan and Sally Field, it was quite difficult for them not to break character.\"\n\nIn the movie, Williams plays a recently divorced father who, in a desperate attempt to see his kids on a daily basis, dresses as an elderly British woman and poses as the children's nanny.\n\nColumbus says that Williams did some form of improvisation in almost every scene in the movie, leading to 2 million feet of film being used on the shoot.\n\nColumbus jokes that if the movie were shot today with digital cameras, Williams would never stop.\n\n\"Once we were out of film in the camera, we would say to Robin, 'We're out of film.' That happened on several occasions,\" the director says.\n\nColumbus, who is also known for directing \"Home Alone,\" says that out of all of the improvisations Williams did, two stand out as his favorites.\n\nRelated stories\n\nAt the end of the movie Williams, as Mrs. Doubtfire, loses his teeth in his drink. \"You can see the glee in Robin's face, he's almost smiling to himself that he came up with that,\" Columbus says.\n\nAnd the famous pie-in-face sequence in which Williams frantically goes back and forth from his Daniel character to Mrs. Doubtfire required 18 takes.\n\n\"When he's in the bedroom putting on the Doubtfire costume, that probably was his hardest work on the film. Verbally and physically,\" Columbus says. \"He was physically spent after doing that.\"\n\nColumbus says he has over 900 boxes of footage — made up of outtakes, behind-the-scenes, and used footage — that he would like to use in a documentary that highlights Williams' genius process.\n\n\"He was in his prime at that point in his life and it was like divine inspiration,\" Columbus says."
