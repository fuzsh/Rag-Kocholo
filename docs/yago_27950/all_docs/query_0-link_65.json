Speaking to Insider Chris said “There is something special and magical about how he went about his work and I think it would be fun to delve into it.” Side note: Wasn’t Chris Columbus the guy who discovered America? God he must’ve been old when he filmed Mrs. Doubtfire.\n\nPersonally, I would LOVE to see a Robin Williams documentary, he’s a comedic icon and from all reports one of the nicest humans to ever grace our screens."
