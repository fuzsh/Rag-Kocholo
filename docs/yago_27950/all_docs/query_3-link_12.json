        "text": "A consistent audience favorite since he burst onto the small screen as a red-suited alien from planet Ork in 1978, the irrepressible and irreverent Robin Williams fittingly enjoyed one of Hollywood's most unique and long-lasting careers. His classical Juilliard dramatic training coupled with his unequaled talents for improvisation led to award-winning roles as outrageous comic characters in \"Mrs. Doubtfire\" (1993) and \"The Birdcage\" (1996) as well as subtle and well-observed dramatic figures in \"The World According to Garp\" (1982), \"The Fisher King\" (1991) and \"Good Will Hunting\" (1997). Williams also maintained a reputation as one of the top stand-up comics in the history of the medium for his hyperkinetic act, which seemingly followed his every stray thought into energetic riffs and tangents as well as employing a spot-on mimicry of people of all stripes. Although the actor and comedian, who had long been upfront about his personal demons, had been batting severe depression for some time, his suicide on August 11, 2014 stunned his longtime friends and fans."
