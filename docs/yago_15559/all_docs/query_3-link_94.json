        "text": "Can cinema and education co-exist for children? It can, and Gattu, a film by Rajan Khosa, promises to do that.\n\nMany educationists came together to support Gattu and participate in a discussion about the pertinent subject of cinema and its role in education, on Friday, during the launch of Gattu’s promotional song â Laga le pech.\n\nâWe can aim to make a difference in the way films are viewed and make them a learning tool,â said Nandita Das, actor and chairperson of Children’s Film Society India (CFSI).\n\nGattu is the first work by CFSI to be released commercially.\n\nâWe also have a Kannada and an animation film coming up. Gattu will be a gate opener for all of them,\" Nandita told reporters at the event. “Through this release we hope to reach out to millions of children in India. Gattu gives me the courage to follow my dream as well. I will feel that if he can do it, so can I,” she said.\n\nThe film, starring Mohammas Samad as Gattu, has been directed by Rajan Khosa of Dance of the Wind fame.\n\nRevealing the story, Khosa said the film is about a nine-year-old street boy who is obsessed with flying kites. “He wants to cut this black kite called Kali and for this he needs a high roof. He realises that the school has one and pretends to go to the school and wins the heart of all children,” he added.\n\nGattu opened at the 17th International Children’s Film Festival at Hyderabad. The film was held in high regards by critics and film reviewers all over the world. It had also been honoured with a special mention at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival.\n\nDirector-producer Rakeysh Omprakash Mehra is supporting Gattu and says that the entertaining and wonderful story will take viewers back to their childhood days. “I am proud that I am associated with Gattu. I will do whatever I can to support the film,” said Mehra.\n\n“The film is about the have and have-nots and the right to education. It is about all of us. I am sure it will be a lovely movie and I want to give it my entire support. Lower the budget, the more the challenges. The film seems entertaining and the story is wonderful. Let’s revisit our childhood through this film,” he added.\n\nLaga le pech has been sung by Shubha Mudgal and child artists of Gattu. Lyrics are by Khosa and Ankur Tiwari and Sandesh Shandilya has composed it.\n\nCFSI is a government body that produces, exhibits and distributes childrenâs cinema. Since its inception CFSI has given opportunities to young and imaginative film-makers and over the years some of the most delightful childrenâs content has been produced by the organisation. CFSI films are regularly shown on satellite channels, but this is the organisationâs first foray into a nation-wide theatrical release.\n\nThe film is being distributed in India by Rajshri Media and will release on 20 July."
