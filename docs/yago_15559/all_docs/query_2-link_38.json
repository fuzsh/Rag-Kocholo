        "text": "Closing Night, Centerpiece and Celebrities Press Release\n\nMEDIA CONTACT: JINGO Media/ Jitin Hingorani/ 917.261.7284/ Jitin@Jingomedia.com\n\nDirectly Following its World Premiere at the Cannes Film Festival,\n\nNYIFF announces U.S. premiere of Anurag Kashyap’s GANGS OF WASSEYPUR\n\n& World Premiere of Rituparno Ghosh’s CHITRANGADA\n\n(New York, NY—May 1, 2012) Tickets are selling out fast to the plethora of award-winning, controversial, and ground-breaking movies that are part of the stellar line-up of the 12th annual New York Indian Film Festival (NYIFF), the longest-running and most prestigious showcase of Indian films in the United States. Presented by the Indo-American Arts Council, NYIFF 2012 will take place from May 23 to 27 at the home for independent film, Tribeca Cinemas in Lower Manhattan. The opening night red carpet screening of Bedabrata Pain’s CHITTAGONG will take place at the iconic Paris Theater (4 W. 58th St. at 5th Avenue) on May 23, followed by a benefit gala. The centerpiece film, right off the cutting room floor, is the world premiere of Rituparno Ghosh’s CHITRANGADA, which will have two screenings at Tribeca Cinemas. The closing night red carpet screening of Anurag Kashyap’s GANGS OF WASSEYPUR will be presented at NYU’s Skirball Center for the Performing Arts (566 Laguardia Place), followed by an awards ceremony and after party sponsored by Wells Fargo.\n\nGANGS OF WASSEYPUR comes directly to us from the prestigious Festival de Cannes 2012, as a part of the Director's Fortnight section. Synopsis: Towards the end of colonial India, Shahid Khan loots the British trains, impersonating the legendary Sultana Daku. Now outcast, Shahid becomes a worker at Ramadhir Singh's colliery, only to spur a revenge battle that passes on to generations. At the turn of the decade, Shahid's son, the philandering Sardar Khan vows to get his father's honor back, becoming the most feared man of Wasseypur. In contemporary times, the weed addicted grandson, Faizal Khan, wakes up to this vengeance that his family has inherited. Staying true to its real life influences, the film explores this revenge saga through the socio-political dynamic in erstwhile Bihar (North India), in the coal and scrap trade mafia of Wasseypur, through the imprudence of a place obsessed with mainstream 'Bollywood' cinema.\n\nIn CHITRANGADA, Rituparno Ghosh faces the camera again in the role of a choreographer who plans to stage the dance drama Chitrangada on the occasion of Rabindranath's 150th birth anniversary. Rituparno Ghosh is Rudra Chatterjee in this Bengali movie Chitrangada and the character’s nick name is Khokon. Rudra Chatterjee was interested in art from his childhood but he studied Engineering as his father wanted him to study in technical stream. There was a conflict between the father and son, ultimately the son, Rudra became a choreographer. This is the point where the story of the new Bengali film Chitrangada coincides with Rabindranath Tagore's Chitrangada. In Tagore's Chitrangada, the King of Manipur wants to see his daughter Chitrangada as prince of Manipur since he doesn't have a son but Chitrangada wants to remain a girl.\n\nOther Festival Highlights Include:\n\nOscar-winning documentary SAVING FACE from Pakistan, as well as award-winning films from South Africa, Australia, and Sri Lanka;\n\nIn addition to films in Hindi and English, regional-language films in Tamil, Bengali, and Marathi;\n\nThe controversial Kashmiri film INSHALLAH FOOTBALL;\n\nAn exciting secret film, which will be revealed during the festival;\n\nSpecial tribute to the late Dev Anand, HUM DONO RANGEEN; and\n\nShyam Benegal's retrospective trilogy: ZUBEIDA, MAMMO, SARDARI BEGUM.\n\nCelebrities Anticipated to Attend & Walk the Red Carpets Include:\n\nKareena Kapoor\n\nMadhur Bhandarkar\n\nAnurag Kashyap\n\nRituparno Ghosh\n\nSalman Rushdie\n\nMira Nair\n\nMadhur Jaffrey & Sanford Allen\n\nSuketu Mehta\n\nOmi Vaidya\n\nKiran Desai\n\nTracey Jackson & Glen Horowitz\n\nShyam & Nira Benegal\n\nSuneil Anand\n\nRajit Kapoor\n\nPadma Lakshmi\n\nPoorna Jaganathan\n\nBedobrata Pain\n\nIsabella Spinelli\n\nBornilla Chatterjee\n\nSamrat Chakraborti\n\nAasif Mandvi\n\nSarita Chaudhuri\n\nAjay Naidu\n\nJoseph Mathew\n\nJunaid Ahmed\n\nTanishtha Chatterjee\n\nPrashant Nair\n\nAishwarya\n\nDhanush\n\nZaheda Mohamed\n\nVatri Maran\n\nSujay Dahake\n\nAshwin Kumar\n\nVikram Gandhi\n\nOmi Vaidya\n\nDev Benegal\n\nFor the complete line-up of films, ticket information, and synopses, please visit .\n\nAbout the Indo-American Arts Council: The Indo-American Arts Council is a registered not-for-profit arts organization passionately dedicated to showcasing, building awareness, and celebrating artists of Indian origin in the performing, visual and literary arts.

NYIFF, the longest-running, most prestigious Indian film festival in the country, announces its 2012 line-up of films, including the opening night film, centerpiece film, and sidebar festival.\n\nOpening Night Film – Bedabrata Pain’s CHITTAGONG: Set in the turbulence of the 1930s British India, Chittagong is a true story of a 14-year-old boy, Jhunku, and of his journey to find where he belongs. For the first time in Indian history, the British army is defeated by a ragtag army of schoolboys and their teacher, Masterda. Called a traitor by his peers, and let down by a man he trusts, Jhunku impulsively joins the movement. As his world is turned upside down, Jhunku is forced to confront his self-doubts. As the leaders of the movement are progressively caught or killed, Jhunku battles against seemingly insurmountable odds to win a victory of his own. The film is a brilliant, poignant action-drama, made more so by the fact that it is true. Cast: Manoj Bajpai, Barry John and Delzad Hiwale.\n\nCenterpiece Film – Tribute to the Late Great Dev Anand through HUM DONO RANGEEN: Hum Dono Rangeen was restored and colorized using Legend Film's proprietary colorization process. The process has consistently been lauded as the highest quality color conversion technology in the world and has been used extensively on Hollywood feature films over the past 10 years. Hum Dono Rangeen was one of the latest colorization projects using the technology and it is considered light years ahead of Mugal e Azam in the quality of its color, artistry and overall design. The colorization of Hum Dono Rangeen was executed by Jagan Mohan at Goldstone Technologies, a technology licensee of Legend Films under the collaborative eye of Legend Films engineers and technicians. It lives as the finest example of Bollywood colorization that exists today.\n\nSidebar Festival – Shyam Benegal Retrospective followed by a post-screening discussion with director: Mamoo (1994), Sardari Begum (1996), and Zubeidaa (2001) - the first such programming of Benegal's trilogy based on scripts by renowned critic, journalist, and filmmaker Khalid Mohamed. All three films are Mohamed's personal stories about his mother, grandmother, aunt, and grandaunt. Shyam Benegal (born 14 December 1934, Hyderabad) is a prolific Indian director and screenwriter. With his first four feature films, Ankur (1973), Nishant (1975), Manthan (1976) and Bhumika (1977), he created a new genre, which has now come to be called the \"middle cinema\" in India. He has expressed dislike of the term, preferring his work to be called New or Alternate cinema. He was awarded the Padma Shri in 1976 and the Padma Bhushan in 1991. On 8 August 2007, Benegal was awarded the highest award in Indian cinema for lifetime achievement, the Dadasaheb Phalke Award for the year 2005. He has won the National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Hindi seven times.\n\n“To commemorate the one hundredth year of Indian cinema, our 2012 line-up celebrates all that NYIFF finds inspiring about great films – depth, character study, ingenious plots, and riveting messages,” says Aroon Shivdasani, Executive Director of the Indo-American Arts Council, the non-profit organization responsible for organizing the New York Indian Film Festival. “These movies have already won National Awards in India, at Cannes, Sundance, and the Berlin Film Festivals. We are proud to share our entire schedule with New York cinephiles.” For more information about NYIFF and to see the entire film schedule, please visit /NYIFF2012/\n\nAbout the Indo-American Arts Council: The Indo-American Arts Council is a registered not-for-profit arts organization passionately dedicated to showcasing, building awareness, and celebrating artists of Indian origin in the performing, visual and literary arts.
