        "text": "Produced by the Children’s Film Society of India, Gattu won a special mention at the Berlin International Film Festival in February this year. It’s the kind of charming film that’ll feature on critics’ year-end lists of movies you should have watched but probably didn’t. Do yourself a favor – don’t miss it.\n\nGattu’s ( Samad) sole spot of joy also comes from his deft handling of kites. Kite-flying helps him escape his life full of drudgery in a` kabaadkhaana’, surrounded by the discards of other people. He is an orphan who’s been taken under his `chacha’’s ( Kumar ) wings, so he’s not exactly on the streets, but he could very well be, given that he gets a bare bed and scant food and a lot of brusqueness in return for unending free labour.\n\nThe film does become a little far-fetched as Gattu, an illiterate, continues to fool his teachers and spins an unbelievable yarn for his classmates. But Khosa gives it a fable-like texture so that you don't mind too much when reality takes a backseat.Gattu is small in scale, but this is a film with heart.\n\nGattu is a must watch for all but most especially cynics who believe 'there is no hope for any of us'. It took Gattu just a little less than two hours to prove it.\n\nGattu carries forward the recent trend of sensible, intelligent funny and moving films about child protagonists, namely Taare Zameen Par, I Am Kalam and Stanley Ka Dabba. Add one more film to that luminous list of cinema on little wonders.\n\nOn the whole, a film like GATTU speaks to both, the kids and adults. Films like these, which aren't made to appease the box-office, but cater to a different audience, ought to be encouraged. For, there's life beyond zany entertainers as well!\n\n‘Gattu’ carries forward the recent trend of sensible, intelligent funny and moving films about child protagonists, namely ‘Taare Zameen Par’, ‘I Am Kalam’ and ‘Stanley Ka Dabba’. Add one more film to that luminous list of cinema on little wonders."
