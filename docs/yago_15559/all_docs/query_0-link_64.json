        "text": "On the fourth day of Children’s Film Festival 'Ullas' a Bollywood movie Gattu was screened at Ravindra Bhavan. Here on Friday, the Children Film Festival received an average response by the film lovers of the city.\n\nNotably, Gattu is a 2012 Hindi film directed by Rajan Khosa, which gained high recognition in the Film Festival circuit. Khosa is most known for his previous film Dance of the Wind (1997).\n\nThe story is set in a small town Roorkee, Uttarakhand, India, where a nine-year-old orphan, Gattu works in his uncle's garbage-recycling business. The blue skies above the town is dominated by a kite named 'Kali' with mysterious origins. Out of the many kids who dream to defeat Kali, Gattu is more determined. He does fail on number of occasions but one fine day, his will find a way. He discovers a local school having a roof that renders him some strategic advantage. Impersonating as a student, he sneaks into the school and must now pretend to study. The only problem - he can't read or write! The little street urchin takes up the challenge as when the desire is strong, dreams aren't impossible.\n\nGattu opened at the 17th International Children's Film Festival at Hyderabad. This film was held in high regards by critics and film reviewers all over the world. The film had been honored with a special mention under Deutsches Kinderhilfswerk category at the 62nd Berlin International Film Festival. It is one of the few films of Bollywood to win such acclaim."
