The film constantly switches between genre pieces and is part hard-boiled film noir, part love story, part melodrama and part documentary. Asim earlier had doubts whether his film will be approved for a release in India, considering how stringent the censors can be sometimes. He also spoke about it in an interview with a leading daily. He said, “In India, you barely see a kiss on screen. It’s a highly censored country. Initially, when I sent Miss Lovely to the Censor Board, they asked me: ‘Are you sure you want to put this through?’ But, to his surprise the movie was passed by the censor board and the response that followed was even better than Ashim could have imagined. He said, “For a pretty wild art-pulp film with a lot of controversial content, the reaction has been incredible. It’s a small film with no studio or Bollywood personality supporting us — it was released through a small independent distributor, which is very rare in India.”\n\nThe New York Times profiled the movie and the director in a piece titled “Mumbai in the Bad Old Days”. It premiered at the 2012 Cannes Film Festival and won the National Film Award – Special Jury Award (Feature film), and Best Production Design at the 61st National Film Awards.\n\nPeddlers (2012)\n\nPeddlers is a film set in Mumbai and revolves around the story of a 20 year old destitute boy who gets trapped in a drug trade and a young cop who tries to bust them.

The film, which features Gulshan Devaiah, Kriti Malhotra, Siddharth Menon and Nimrat Kaur has also recently toured the Toronto International Film Festival. Vasan says that the audience abroad is looking for original voices from India. “They don’t want to see rehashed European films. They were taken aback with the way Mumbai is showcased in Peddlers and surprised by the projection of women having drinks and indulging in one-night stands. They’re used to seeing only conservative films coming from India,” he says. With absolutely zero filmi contacts, this aspiring filmmaker began his struggle on a blank slate. “Other than watching movies I had no other film connection. I started cutting trailers to learn editing.

So he decided to pitch his idea to a fellow student Tushar Paranjape, who ended up turning it into a full script.
