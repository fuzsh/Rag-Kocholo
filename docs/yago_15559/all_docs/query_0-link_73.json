        "text": "Language: Hindi\n\nStarring: Mohammad Samad, Naresh Sharma, Jayanta Das\n\nDirector: Rajan Khosa\n\nAn illiterate orphan boy dreams of becoming the town’s top kite flyer and will take an unusual path to achieve his goal.\n\nTen years ago when Rajan Khosa’s Gattu opened at the International Children’s Film Festival in Hyderabad, it created an instant buzz. The goodwill carried on at a global level — it won awards and accolades alike at various film fests. The universal appeal of this little film about kids, steeped in the local milieu of a small North-Indian city, is not difficult to see. Gattu is an endearing story of a disadvantaged child who achieves his dream with wit, a little luck, and lots of pluck. And Khosa tells it with great humanity and candour.\n\nGattu (Mohammad Samad) is an illiterate orphan fostered by Anees (Naresh Sharma), a stern but well-intentioned scrap dealer who trains him with a firm hand. Like Gattu, Anees is kinless and together they make an unlikely unit. Anees never misses a chance to remind Gattu of how better off he is compared to other street children — with a roof over his head, earning his daily bread and a vocational skill to learn. “Humaari toh zindagi hi aisey nikal gayi, humein nahin seekhaya kisine kaam. Yahaan wahaan bhatak bhatak ke kaam seekha,” he reflects hoping the young boy would pay heed and secure his future. But the cheeky, quick-witted Gattu, who cooks up excuses and makes up stories on the fly, has other motivations: flying kites and beating Kali — the enigmatic owner of a black kite that soars high in the skies of Roorkee trouncing every patang that crosses its path.\n\nHaving lost seven kites to Kali and constantly ridiculed by neighbourhood’s bigger players, Gattu’s resolve grows stronger. What our pint-sized protagonist lacks is not the craft or tools of kite-flying but access to the terrace of tall building to fly his kite from that will level him up with Kali. As it so happens, it’s the primary school that’s the tallest building in the area and Gattu would have to make an audacious move to approach it.\n\nLuckily for him, the school hosts a student exchange programme, so Gattu flicks a uniform, a schoolbag and sneaks in. Biding his time to get to the roof, he mingles with students, devices clever ways to deflect attention off his illiterate status while discovering classroom bonhomie and the joys of learning new things such as science, stories, and colouring. But when his ruse is uncovered by three classmates, Gattu pretends to be an undercover agent assigned to thwart a terror attack on the school. To do so he needs to fly a kite from the school rooftop which would be a “secret signal” to his bosses. The trio join the quest fully convinced they are a part of a secret plan to save their alma mater with ‘Agent Gattu’ as their commander. Whether they succeed in their mission and does Gattu manage to defeat Kali forms the rest of the story.\n\nSet in Roorkee the film offers a contrasting and crucial depiction of the educational hub — through the perspective of the children living on the margins — ragpickers, child labourers struggling to survive. A sheltered existence and access to proper education for them is an unattainable privilege. Neither sensational nor patronising, the film views their harsh realities with a conscious and empathetic gaze. For instance, Gattu’s awareness of his circumstances and lack of opportunities is such that the thought of attending school doesn’t occur to him until he goes to one. In a most affecting scene, the young boy enquires about his past to Anees and wonders if his father is still around only to be advised to not harbour any such hopes. Despite his precociousness, a moment of vulnerability such as this is a reminder that Gattu is merely a child.\n\nThe film creates a faithful portrait of small city life: teeming houses, narrow lanes bustling with shops and small businesses, rooftops occupied with kite flyers, children running around in the streets, and people going about their daily affairs. Every now and then, the duelling kites cause traffic bottlenecks — bystanders await the patangbaazi’s outcome and eager kids wait to claim the fallen prize.\n\nKhosa captures the communal experience of kite flying evocatively. The images of bright kites swirling in the skies, the crackling sound of maanja-laced thread unrolling from the spool, the struggle to find a favourable flying spot, players trading insults across terraces, and quick alliances being struck to take on a common adversary are greatly immersive.\n\nFurthermore, the filmmaker makes a brilliant use of humour and matter-of-fact observations for the sarkaari school infrastructure running on a strapped-but-functional philosophy. The school building that forms the central setting is an average rundown structure with faded walls, crammed classrooms and dingy toilets but is of great significance to the committed teachers and staff who run it and the boisterous bunch of kids who spend their day here learning, playing and sharing tiffins.\n\nMost of the children featuring in the film are non actors and bring an element of naturalism in their performances led by a winsome Samad suitably cast as Gattu. His gait, body language, and dialogue delivery in playing the mischievous minor is perfectly effortless and a precursor to the promising career (Tumbadd, ’18; Selection Day, ’18, Chhichhore, ’19) this spontaneous young actor would have in showbiz.\n\nLike a majority of the children’s cinema in India, Gattu, too, found backing with the Children’s Film Society of India, the government body behind some the most significant children’s programming like Bal Doot, Potli Baba Ki, Jadoo Ka Shankh, Halo, Karamati Coat among others. Children’s cinema is a particularly difficult genre to navigate as budget constraints and audience reach remains a struggle. Moreover, children’s films are expected to have moral values which often results in them being unnecessarily didactic. Gattu manages this expectation tremendously well without compromising on the craft and storytelling thereby opening itself to a wider set of audience. It is a great example of cinema for children without infantilizing them. In the end, everyone has something to learn — both kids and the adults — with a lovely surprise thrown in and some pleasant outcomes.\n\nWatch: Gattu\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nStarring: Master Raju, Master Tito, Vidya Sinha, Uttam Kumar\n\nDirector: Gulzar\n\nBabla moves away from his village and mother to study in a city where his sister and brother-in-law reside. His aversion to studies and constant reprimanding from teachers and family forces Babla to run away from his new home.\n\nSomewhere in Gulzar’s Kitaab (1977) is a scene where the film’s protagonist, a school-going boy called Babla (Master Raju), has fallen sick and the doctor indicates stress as the cause. “Itne se bachche ko kya tension ho sakta hai,” wonders Babla’s elder sister Komal (Vidya Sinha) who along with her husband are his guardians. The stress kids feel is both overwhelming and intensive, the doctor explains. Komal then makes a casual remark about Babla’s inability to deal with pressure would impact his future prospects. Worried by her lack of understanding of a child’s psyche, the doctor points out how the system of raising children based on intimidation and control benefits none. “Zindagi kya hauvva hai ya rakshash hai jisse bada ho kar muqabla karna hoga? Hum yeh kyun nahin kehte zindagi enjoy karne ke liye hai… padh likh kar taiyyar ho jaao?”\n\nIt is this dissonance between the worlds of children and the grownups and the latter’s dismissiveness that Gulzar so competently illustrates in Kitaab. Based on Bengali author Samaresh Basu’s story Pathik, the film explores the ways of the world from a child’s perspective. It does so in an honest, humorous, and heartfelt manner making it a milestone children’s film in Indian cinema.\n\nGulzar’s mastery at addressing the complexities of human relationships is well-known. He is also a rare writer-filmmaker whose repertoire has a respectable amount of work dedicated to young viewers. Right from his sophomore film Parichay (1972) which had four belligerent children and their older sister as the focal point, Gulzar established his flair at grasping the sensibilities of the young. Kitaab was his next significant project in this category. This time the story centres around a curious, playful boy with the knack for getting into trouble much to the chagrin of the grownups around him. Devoid of the usual tropes associated with children’s films — an element of fantasy, mythology or the supernatural — Kitaab sets itself up for real life experiences where the whims and insecurities of childhood run concurrent to the complications of the adult world.\n\nBabla moves away from his village and mother to study in a city where his sister and brother-in-law reside. Academics doesn’t interest the boy; he is more keen on observing the routine life around him and the variety of people in it. His aversion to studies and the constant reprimanding from teachers and family leaves Babla with a sense of alienation. He feels the sole person who ‘gets’ him is his classmate Pappu (Master Tito). Together they play pranks, bunk classes, and roam the streets looking for things to engage with. One day it’s the street magician who piques their interest, then there’s the sweet-maker who they feel is better off without the troubles of school and homework. The idea of being an adult and having the power to decide for oneself is a coveted concept to them. “Pataa nahin kab bade honge. Badon ki sabko zaroorat hoti hai aur badon ko kisi ki bhi nahin,” they wonder in anticipation.\n\nStuck between the school’s terrifyingly unfriendly atmosphere and the tense situation at home owing to his sister and brother-in-law’s marital strife, Babla feels unwelcome everywhere. “Yeh duniya humaari mushkil nahin samajhti. Kabhi kabhi jee chaahta hai ki bhaag jaaun,” he confides in Pappu. And one day when things spiral out of control, he does run away, desperate to get back to his mother. Travelling ticktet-less on a train, it’s this journey home where Babla is finally on his own. The different kinds of individuals he meets and the adventures he undertakes during the course, make a transformative impact on the young boy.\n\nKitaab unfolds in a leisurely pace mirroring the un-hurriedness of its young characters but nowhere does it get dull thanks to Gulzar’s expert penmanship. The film comes alive with warm, observational humour, witty conversations, and offbeat songs like the joyous Masterji ki aa gayi chitthi and the deliciously trippy and more popular Dhanno ki aankhon mein. Babla’s thoughts while journaling, his interactions with Pappu about the futility of childhood, and his comments about the wily ways in which grownups deal with children are both amusing and profound.\n\nThe film has a remarkable mix of secondary characters led by an effortless Uttam Kumar who plays Babla’s sympathetic brother-in-law, Shreeram Lagoo as the fakeer Babla befriends along the way and who teaches him a thing or two about survival with wisdom and generosity. Ram Mohan is the cheerful engine driver with a song on his lips and Indrani Mukherjee as Babla’s doting caretaker, Kusum.\n\nThe beating heart of the film is, of course, Master Raju. His portrayal of Babla is the right amount of candour, cleverness and charm proving why he was among the most beloved child artists of that era. Kitaab is Raju’s show and he runs it without a misstep. He is excellently supported by Master Tito – another popular child actor from the ’70s – as Babla’s street-smart buddy Pappu.\n\nKitaab neither patronises kids nor does it depict childhood in a cloying fashion. It is an uncontrived and empathetic ode to growing up and views children as they really are – vulnerable and also exasperating, wise and also impulsive. And it is for this attentiveness and relatability that the film allows its central theme that the appeal of Kitaab endures.\n\nThe article was first published in Yahoo! India on November 14, 2020.\n\nWatch: Kitaab\n\nLanguage: Kannada\n\nStarring: Manohara Bhat, Aboobakar Siddik\n\nDirector: Prithvi Konanur\n\nAt nine, life looks unkind to Basu and Putta — two school going boys residing in a small fishing village in coastal Karnataka. So they decide to row to an island to meet a fabled spirit, who may have the solution to their problems.\n\nIn an endearing and uncomplicated world of childhood, failing a test, facing the teacher’s ire or confessing a lie to parents are high-stake crises. Kids, often dreading the wrath of the grown-ups, cook up lame excuses or resort to unbelievable antics to avoid facing the music. Prithvi Konanur’s debut feature Alegalu tells one such heartwarming story about the trials of growing up where two young boys set out on an adventure hoping it holds the key to their problems.\n\nBasu (Bhat), a petite nine-year-old, is having a tough time accepting his widowed mother’s decision to remarry. He has failed a class test and made the matter worse for himself by forging his mother’s signature on the report card. His best friend, Putta (Siddik) unhappy with his father’s gambling ways, spends his time playing in the water and creating miniature models with erasers. In order to buy new rubber pieces, Putta steals money from home but is caught and chastised by his mother.\n\nDejected by their circumstances, the boys turn to Basu’s grandma’s stories for comfort. Ajji tells them about a fabled Panjurli (spirit) residing on an island in the midst of the sea. Anyone who makes the perilous trip to the island and offers a prized possession to the holy spirit will have their wishes come true. Hoping to turn their luck around, Putta and Basu decide to undertake this mission in their small rowboat.\n\nInstead of evoking the usual drama and suspense associated with two children alone in the sea, the film assumes a comically self-aware tone. The truth isn’t lost on the boys that they have set out on unpredictable journey that may not end favourably. In doing so, they weigh their chances at survival and worry about immediate concerns like what to eat or how to relieve themselves. Or imagine far-fetched scenarios like on losing their oar mid-sea, Basu fears the wind may push them in the direction of Pakistan and Putta is convinced they’d spend rest of their lives in jail.\n\nFrom being foolhardy to realizing and regretting their folly, the child actors are a delight to watch, and their chemistry is humorous and natural. The film also triumphs in portraying the relaxed and close-knit milieu of coastal Karnataka. And with a major chunk of action set at sea, the tonality is well captured by the film’s slow, languorous camerawork.\n\nAlegalu addresses the apprehensions and insecurities of kids with its wonderful, slice-of-life moments and conveys many moral messages in the subtlest ways. Suffice it to say, this lovely little movie will uplift you.\n\n—\n\nAwards\n\nOsian’s Cinefan Film Festival, India (2012)\n\nRoshd International Educational Film, Iran (2012)\n\nToronto Kids International Film Festival, Canada (2013)\n\nIndian Film Festival, Germany (2013)\n\nWatch: Alegalu (Waves)\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nStarring: Manohar Mahajan, Master Ankur Javeri, Surbhi Javeri\n\nDirector: K Gopal Krishnan\n\nKailash Dutta, an amateur astronomer, joins hands with international scientists to avert a comet on a collision course with earth. However, when a nefarious gang steals his research, Dutta’s tenacious grandkids set out to recover the documents that would save the world from an apocalyptic fate.\n\nIn the early Eighties, as Doordarshan went national and colour television entered the Indian market, it opened up new vistas of communication and education. For a developing nation striving for economical stability and technological progress, television became the perfect tool for connecting with the masses. Along with health, family planning and other contemporary issues, DD’s programming also emphasized on the popularization of science. Developing a scientific mindset was the only way to alleviate a country grappling with age-old superstitions and social backwardness.\n\nDespite its nascent status, DD engaged some of the best minds to come up with science-driven content. While Ank Ajoobe demystified mathematics, Indradhanush piqued curiosity about computers, and UGC Presents made learning science affordable and accessible. Gopal Krishan’s Dhoomketu, too, was made during this period to foster scientific temperament. The film is based on astrophysicist Jayant Vishnu Narlikar’s 1976 story by the same name. Incidentally, those growing up in the Nineties would remember Narlikar from Brahmand — a Cosmos like series created by him that aired on Doordarshan.\n\nProduced by the Children’s Film Society India, Dhoomketu aims to educate and bust myths surrounding celestial bodies — all while building up an adventure on the side. Narlikar, a prolific science fiction writer, weaves an absorbing story of an impending doom with astronomy at its centre. The director, a science graduate himself, understands the writer’s vision and adapts the story where complex scientific phenomena are explained in simple terms using graphics and images — but nowhere do they overpower the story.\n\nAn amateur Indian astronomer, Kailash Dutta loves researching about comets. His grandkids Bittu and Jhumki share his enthusiasm for astronomy unlike his superstitious wife who considers Dutta’s hobby inauspicious. Dutta discovers a comet headed earth’s way and it triggers a global wave of panic among scientists. Together they work towards averting the catastrophe. However, when a nefarious gang steals Dutta’s research, his tenacious grand kids set out to recover the documents that would save the world from an apocalyptic fate.\n\nIn this age of cutting-edge VFX and snazzy CGI effects, Dhoomketu‘s visual storytelling may look amateurish and its graphics undeniably basic. But to a young viewer growing up in the Eighties in the pre-internet days with no access to world entertainment, this modest production was probably the closest representation of space and the heavenly bodies orbiting in it.\n\nThe film brings vivid memories of growing up in a pre-liberalisation era — in humble surroundings where life unfolded in a leisurely fashion. The excitement of the family as they discussed Dutta’s invitation to Geneva or when the whole neighbourhood gathers to watch the comet signify the mood of small-town India where the smallest as well as the grandest events attracted participation from all corners.\n\nThe whiff of nostalgia gets only stronger with the presence of several familiar faces. Real life siblings Master Ankur Javeri and Surbhi Javeri feature as the brother-sister duo. Ankur had a successful run as a child artiste and featured in several well-known shows during that decade. Surbhi went on to star in south Indian films and remains active in the Hindi TV serial circuit. Another sibling pair — actresses Fatima Sheikh (Sau Crore) and Mahru Sheikh (Jassi Jaisi Koi Nahin, Singh Is Bliing) too featured in it.\n\nHowever, the most interesting casting is veteran radio announcer Manohar Mahajan as Kailash Dutta. Old timers and radio enthusiasts would recall Mahajan’s deep, silky voice from Radio Ceylon’s Hindi Service in the late Sixties. It is most delightful to watch the former star of airwaves as the star-gazing patriarch.\n\nThe one area Dhoomketu severely falters in is its sexist commentary. For a film that slams outdated practices and promotes rationale, it is most jarring to find a woman shamed for her appearance and for smoking. The bad girls dress and behave a certain way trope becomes all the more problematic when such opinions are propagated in a children’s film. One can argue that it’s a product of its time — Eighties’ cinema was notoriously sexist — and no stereotypical content of that period would pass muster in today’s calling out culture. That said and done, we must examine the effects of such messages in our cultural lives. It should have been done then. It must be done now.\n\nWatch: Dhoomketu\n\nThe article was originally published in The Hindu on May 26, 2018.\n\nHalo (1996), cinematographer Santosh Sivan’s directorial debut, produced by Children’s Film Society of India (CFSI), is a little-known film. But it is a fine example of what children’s cinema should be — entertaining, empathetic and educative without being sermonising. It tells the story of Sasha, a seven-year-old girl without a mother, who will stop at nothing to find her missing puppy, Halo. During her search through the streets of Mumbai, Sasha encounters a variety of people.\n\nThe inspiration for Halo is Raakh (1989) — the cinematographer’s first Hindi feature. It so happened that director Aditya Bhattacharya’s younger sister, Anwesha’s dog went missing during the filming. “Here was this young girl trying to find where her dog had disappeared. I thought it was a very interesting story from her point of view,” says Sivan. Most of the characters in his film are inspired by people he met during that period.\n\nThe genre was a natural choice for Sivan’s first feature film. He had previously directed Story of Tiblu (1988), a short for the Films Division, about a child going to school in Arunachal Pradesh.\n\nSivan’s other two films, Malli (1998) and Tahaan (2008), too are globally acclaimed and widely screened. Children, he says are easy to work with. “I like to observe them, and make it as easy, natural and casual as they are.” During the making of Halo, he had the kids clap, shout ‘action’ and ‘cut’.\n\nSivan feels children’s films do not really do well in the Indian market, though they may win awards at foreign film festivals. Halo, for instance, got a theatre release five years after it was made. “This too was thanks to distributor, Shringar Films. And I had people like Sanjana Kapoor and Shah Rukh Khan promoting it initially with the preview.” Sivan explains that there’s little funding for such films and plenty of interference.\n\nAn endearing story about human-animal companionship, Halo is also an ode to the city of Mumbai (then Bombay) and its pluralism. The megapolis is captured with all its exquisite contrasts — sea-splashed rocks and concrete columns, cosy little parks nestled between jammed roads. “As an outsider I thought it was interesting to observe these contrasts. I guess that reflected in the movie.” Shot during the monsoon, Sivan’s masterful camerawork makes the city look almost bucolic.\n\nSivan uses his camera angles meticulously in Halo. A low-angle shot of adults talking into the camera portrays a child’s perspective, or how they view an authority figure; wide-angle shots of Mumbai signal the daunting task that lies ahead of Sasha.\n\nWhat really works for Halo is a thoughtful story and its array of quirky characters. There’s a bald and bespectacled father-son duo discussing the state of affairs, a local ‘talk show host’ kid eagerly capturing the ongoings in his video camera, two bumbling luckless cops, a mute smuggler with a penchant for Mickey Mouse print ties, and a Gabbar Singh-inspired urchin operating a network of street kids.\n\nAnd then, there’s Sasha’s inner world: her upright criminal lawyer father who deals with goons with unusual calm but is a basket case around the little mutt, her love-smitten cousin, and a food-crazy house help doling out advice and ditties in equal measure. The dialogues are simple and witty. Humour is well-used to address poignancy. Sample this:\n\n“Riots man-made hote hain ya god-made?”\n\n“Man made, but for god.”\n\nA cherubic Benaf Dadachanji as Sasha is brilliant. Her scenes with the little puppy, especially their first meeting, bring unbridled joy. Their camaraderie moves you even more when Sivan reveals the young actress was scared of dogs. Benaf’s performance is the emotional core of the movie, and she keeps you invested in her vulnerability and resolve.\n\nThe standout is filmmaker Rajkumar Santoshi as Sasha’s father. Speaking about this unusual choice of actor Sivan says, “I always felt he is a very good actor. It’s interesting the way he would enact a scene before a shot.”\n\nHalo is made of many charming moments and images. Sivan does employ the usual children’s cinema tropes and sentimentality, but helmed by some heartwarming performances and a bittersweet ending, Halo is ultimately an intimate coming-of-age tale.\n\nWatch: Halo\n\n—\n\nPS: Halo‘s credits boast some interesting names — promising talents that were still in focus at the turn of the millennium. The lyricist and dialogue writer Sanjay Chhel went on to direct Sanjay Dutt-Urmila Matondkar starrer Khoobsurat (1999) and continues with screenplay and dialogue writing to date. Govind Menon handled Halo’s production design and played the smuggling gang’s top henchman. He would later be known for directing Khwahish (2003) – the film that shot Mallika Sherawat to fame.\n\nLanguage: Manipuri / Meitei\n\nStarring: RK Surchandra, Salam Birendra\n\nDirector: Aribam Syam Sharma\n\nWhen young Sanathoi plays the role of of a Sangai fawn in a dance drama, he discovers the world of this rare, endemic deer species in Manipur.\n\nManipur’s Keibul Lamjao National Park is truly unique. It is the only natural floating park in the world, and it is home to the famed Sangai — the once endangered subspecies of brow-antlered deer endemic to the state.\n\nA medium-sized deer with great antlers, the Sangai walks deftly on the marshy wetlands, earning the appellation ‘the Dancing Deer’. It is intrinsic to Manipuri culture and folklore and is considered the hallowed connection between man and nature. In its more than 200 years of known history, Sangai was assumed to be almost extinct by 1950. In 1953, six deers were spotted in its natural habitat and since then the state government, wildlife bodies and locals have taken extraordinary measures for its conservation. In the 2016 census, the Sangai population stands at 260. Wildlife filmmaker George Thengummoottil’s short documentary The Return of Sangai gives an excellent rundown on the issue.\n\nA unique combination of aquatic, marshland and terrestrial, Keibul Lamjao is home to a variety of flora and fauna. Even as the authorities work aggressively to sustain this fragile ecosystem, they are constantly presented with threats — both natural and man-made — against their conservation efforts. The park is facing twin challenges of poaching and habitat degradation. The constant flooding of the Loktak river on which the national park stands, caused due to the artificial reservoir, results in steady habitat degeneration. With Paari, veteran filmmaker Aribam Syam Sharma highlights these threats and their repercussions for Keibul Lamjao’s inhabitants, especially the Sangai.\n\nIn Syam Sharma’s story, to prepare for a dance drama on the wildlife of Keibul Lamjao, Sanathoi (Surchandra) and his friends join their teacher on a trip to the park. The young boy is deeply impacted when they come across an injured Sangai fawn, and later shares his concern with his grandfather (Birendra). With Idhou’s (grandfather) fascinating stories about Sangai and new learnings about the species, Sanathoi starts imagining himself as Paari, the fawn he plays in the drama.\n\nAs a filmmaker, Aribam Syam Sharma has continuously focused on Manipur’s environmental issues. In Paari, he uses a young boy’s heartwarming guilelessness to make a passionate appeal against man’s interference in nature’s balance. As Sanathoi believes the Sangai he plays in the drama is the same injured fawn who was separated from his parents, he sets out for an audience with the Sangai king in the jungle. The film captures the interplay of imagination and consciousness in a child’s mind beautifully. How folklore and bedtime stories inspire the young to empathise with other beings. For example,when Sanathoi hears the story of the ancient connection between Sangai and Keibul Lamjao, the gravity of their habitat displacement hits him harder.\n\nAribam Syam Sharma is a pioneering figure of Manipuri cinema credited for placing this fledgling film industry on the world map. Manipuri cinema began in the Seventies and Syam Sharma is one of its founding fathers. His directorial debut Lamja Parshuram (1974) is considered a classic. In a career spanning four decades, this octogenarian has directed 13 features films and several shorts and documentaries. He shot into international recognition with his 1981 film Imagi Ningthem (My Son, My Precious) that received the grand prix at Festival des Trios Continents, Nantes, France. The biggest highlight of his career would be Ishanou (The Chosen One) screened in the Un Certain Regard section at the 1991 Cannes Film Festival. A son of the soil, Syam Sharma’s films are evocative, deeply embedded in the Manipuri socio-cultural milieu and emotionally rich. Most of his non features (Indigenous Games of Manipur/1990, Meitei Pung/ 1991) are based on subjects inherent to the hill state but have remained largely undiscovered in the mainstream.\n\nHaving studied at Santiniketan in his youth, Syam Sharma would have a lifelong association with classical music, theatre and dance. It influenced his career trajectory as a filmmaker, actor and music composer. Paari is a story largely dependent on music and dance forms, and under Syam Sharma’s expert understanding of the subject, it soars. The message — children as the sentinels of nature — is neither didactic nor does it require sloganeering. A simple collaborative art form does the trick.\n\nWatch: Paari (in Manipuri) | Paari (In Hindi)\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nStarring: Master Romi, Daisy Irani, Jagdeep, Mohan Choti, Murad, Maruti\n\nDirector: PL Santoshi\n\nRajan, son of a wealthy aristocrat, wishes to experience life without the privileges he was born into. His overbearing father doesn’t like him mingling with his working-class school friends. But separating this tenacious bunch of kids isn’t going to be easy.\n\nThe Fifties was a remarkable period for Indian cinema. For a newly liberated country committed to self reliance and nation building, themes like idealism, secularism and democracy permeated in its cinema as well. Rightly called the Golden Age, the decade produced some of the greatest reformist films in Hindi cinema history: Do Bigha Zamin (1953), Jagriti (1954), Shri 420 (1955), Naya Daur (1957), Do Aankhen Barah Haath (1957), Mother India (1957) and Dhool Ka Phool (1959).\n\nIn Hindi cinema, the year 1957 stands out for its distinct depiction of emerging India. Along with the empowering troika of Naya Daur, Do Aankhen Barah Haath and Mother India, there was Guru Dutt’s subversive Pyaasa, RK Films’ Ab Dilli Dur Nahin questioning injustice, and writer-director PL Santoshi’s Hum Panchhi Ek Daal Ke that espoused the Nehruvian philosophy of socialism and unity.\n\nIn 1954, the I&B Ministry established the National Film Award for Best Children’s Film. Three years later, Hum Panchhi Ek Daal Ke became the first Hindi film winner of the Best Children’s Film.\n\nThe film celebrates the spirit of unity through the story about a group of school-goers determined to stick together, come what may. Rajan (Master Romi), the only child of a wealthy aristocrat, is influenced by his school friends’ freedom and self sufficiency. However, his elitist father Rai Bahadur Kailashnath (Murad) is still entrenched in their erstwhile nobility. He doesn’t appreciate Rajan’s fraternizing with working-class boys. The young boy draws his father’s ire when he secretly goes on an excursion with his friends. A furious Kailashnath decides to put an end to this association, but separating these tenacious kids isn’t going to be easy.\n\nHum Panchhi Ek Daal Ke is in no way monumental, especially when pitted against trailblazers like Pyaasa, Mother India and Naya Daur. Unlike these films, it isn’t as arresting or technically sharp but what worked for the film, and still does, is the endearing story at the centre of it and some delightful performances steering it. The film reminds you of a time, not so long ago, when the enthusiasm for hard work and social responsibility was infectious. For example, when the boys discuss their excursion itinerary, it includes a stopover at a nearby village for shram-daan (voluntary labour). To watch an era when the children and youth of the country were fired up with optimism and hopeful of endless possibilities is refreshing.\n\nDirector PL Santoshi’s stint in the industry began with dialogue and screenplay writing. He was also an accomplished lyricist and tasted success early on with hits like Jhoola (1941), Shehnai (1947) and Sargam (1950). His biggest outing would be the 1960 musical hit Barsaat Ki Raat starring Madhubala and Bharat Bhusan. All the songs of Hum Panchhi are written by Santoshi. With N Dutta’s well-matched music, it has some fine outcomes like the leisurely lullaby Bahe Hawa Mand Mand, the peppy road trip number Ek se bhale do — both by Asha Bhosle, and Rafi’s upbeat title track.\n\nThe mainstream cinema of the Fifties offered tremendous scope to child artists. They headlined several big banner films like RK Films’ Boot Polish (1954) and Ab Dilli Dur Nahin (1957), Filmistan’s Jagriti (1954), V Shantaram’s Toofan Aur Deeya (1956) and Silver Wings’ Do Phool (1958). Similarly, Hum Panchhi Ek Daal Ke has some of the most notable child actors of the era — Mater Romi, Satish Vyas, Daisy Irani — leading the pack. The ensemble cast also includes veterans like Murad, Maruti (actress Guddi Maruti’s father), David Abraham and Achala Sachdev.\n\nYoung actor Satish Vyas, who had previously won accolades as the protagonist in Toofan Aur Deeya, plays Nandu — the conscientious head of the group. As Rajan, the rich scion eager to prove his mettle, Romi is both amiable and sincere. The cherubic actor had broken out with the titular role in KA Abbas’ Munna (1954) and later gained prominence with author-backed roles in Ab Dilli Dur Nahin and Yahudi (1958). The film also features and a very young Jagdeep and Mohan Choti; the duo’s spirited acting is a precursor of the great entertainers they would evolve into. Jagdeep would even go on to be a frequent collaborator with Santoshi’s son, Rajkumar Santoshi’s in films like Andaz Apna Apna (1994), China Gate (1998) and Ajab Prem Ki Gazab Kahani (2009).\n\nEven with the presence of industry stalwarts and promising young talent, the highlight of Hum Panchhi… however is Daisy Irani. One of the most beloved child artists and a star in her own right, Irani was famous for enacting little boy roles and billed as Roop Kumar. As Chatpat, the precocious prankster and the youngest of the pack, she is a riot. Her wildly expressive face and natural charm makes it hard to pay attention to anyone else when she is on screen. Watching this lovely, uninhibited performance now, in the light of Irani’s recent revelation that she was sexually abused (she was just six) by her guardian during the film’s outdoor shoot, is just heartbreaking.\n\nOne is just left with an odd poignancy about a film that speaks of everything fair and noble but has such a dark history — that too for its youngest and brightest star.\n\n—\n\nWatch: Hum Panchhi Ek Daal Ke\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nStarring: Shammi, Master Ankur, Paintal\n\nDirector: Mukesh Sharma\n\nGagan loves visiting Amma, his conservationist grandmother who also runs a veterinary hospital. What sets her establishment apart is that over the years, animals have familiarized themselves with the hospital, and when sick or injured, they would often check in on their own.\n\nAnokha Aspatal’s opening credits are most delightful. A series of cartoons serve as a curtain-raiser to this charming little story. There’s a rabbit in a wheelchair admitting himself into the hospital, a crocodile, an elephant and a lion recovering in a ward, and a deer’s watching eagerly as its cast is being taken off. Based on Hindi writer Saroj Mukherjee’s short story by the same name, Anokha Aspatal sensitizes young viewers to the idea of coexistence and rallies for preservation of nature and wildlife.\n\nAmma lives in a village by the forest. The film begins in lush wilderness with the majestic sights and sounds of inhabiting birds and beasts. And here at the end of the jungle nestled in a leafy canopy stands Amma’s quaint bungalow. Its premises: a sanctuary for the sick and wounded creatures where Amma along with her helper Ramdhani run a hands-on little hospital. They feed the birds, nurse the injured and provide basic healthcare to the village’s livestock. For serious medical issues, Amma seeks her doctor son’s help who lives in the nearby city with his family.\n\nAmma’s dedication to her hospital doesn’t allow her to travel often. She misses her grandson Gagan and sends for him during summer vacation. The young boy, too like his granny, is greatly inspired by nature. During his stay, he helps in tending a wounded sheep called Raja and befriends a rabbit named Bhola. Gagan also learns the importance of animals thriving in their natural habitat and conserving the same.\n\nThe peace of the jungle is threatened with the arrival of a group of poachers. Gun shots are heard, trapping pits are discovered and injured animals are found. It is now for Amma to find a way to defend her forest friends.\n\nWith her child-like eagerness and effortless ease around animals, Shammi aunty’s casting as Amma, the sage sentinel of nature is perfect. Playing her grandson Gagan is Master Ankur — one of the most recognizable faces of the ’80s and ’90s telly scene (Buniyaad, Mahabharat and Stone Boy). And as Amma’s trusted helper Ramdhani, Paintal’s skillful interaction with the four-footed compeers is a delight to watch.\n\nAnokha Aspatal works well in its conversations about empathy, coexistence and animal rights, and brings attention to the horrors of hunting. It is, however, the latter whose treatment looks shallow. The poachers, projected in the most facile manner, are toothless and theatrical. A film for children doesn’t have to be childish, and that’s where Anokha Aspatal borders in its climax.\n\nIt’s understandable for a children’s film to not be stark or graphic, but offering a little depth to an issue as grave as poaching would have added to an otherwise decent film’s weight.\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nStarring: Aiman Mukhtiar, Anushka Panvala, Manoj Goyal\n\nDirector: Batul Mukhtiar\n\nLilkee, a poor girl from the hills, moves to Mumbai to care for a working couple’s infant son. Reticent and homesick, she eventually becomes friends with some kids in her building. However, they cast Lilkee out when they learn about her house worker status.\n\nThe issue of class prejudice makes Indian middle class squeamish. Earlier this year the social media sizzled over a viral photo that depicted urban India’s apparent class inequality. While the veracity of the story was debated, the larger issue of class divide and ensuing discrimination is an uncomfortable truth staring the priggish Indian society in its face.\n\nIn Lilkee we have a heartwarming story of a poor immigrant domestic worker with the subject of class prejudice at its centre. The titular character is a bright young girl living with her mother and younger sister in Nainital. Like many children who are forced to join the domestic workforce owing to their impoverished backgrounds, Lilkee’s academic pursuit is cut short, and she is packed off to Mumbai to babysit for a working couple’s infant son.\n\nA reticent and homesick Lilkee struggles to embrace her new life in the city. A life where she misses the freedom and familiarity of her old world. The one where people know so little about her that being served brinjal — something Lilkee strongly dislikes — in her first meal brims her eyes with tears. Her employers are kind, conscientious folks who know her family and feel Lilkee is too young for the job. The film uses meaningful conversations and actions to establish the wretched cycle of poverty and child labour, and how even the well-meaning people end up abetting it — even in the most benign manner. So while Lilkee’s employer, Bela (played by a luminous Anushka Panvala) has a strict policy of not engaging the minor in any other domestic chore, she is constantly troubled by Lilkee’s situation.\n\nAs filmmaker Batul Mukhtiar’s debut venture, Lilkee is admirable in both intent and execution. The lead character is played by Mukhtiar’s pleasant-faced daughter, Aiman. The film has one of the most empathetic employer-domestic worker relationship portrayed in Hindi cinema — notorious for its stereotypical and tone deaf representation of domestic helps.\n\nIn our burgeoning cities awash with massive residential complexes and townships, the (upper) middle class thrives on vast manpower for its survival. Every housing society, big or small, has a system in place with maids, drivers, cooks, security guards, nannies keeping the domestic lives up and running. Lilkee looks at the workers of these gated communities with fresh eyes and perspective. The ubiquitous faces shunting from one tower to another, spending significant time in the premises and running households, and yet as one character in the film succinctly puts, “you have no rights here.”\n\nLilkee‘s biggest win is in the analysis of class bias and peer pressure through the eyes of children. Some of the prejudices that the young minds grow up with are ingrained — adopted from the kind of environment they are raised in. So a casual comment from an adult like servants are dirty, low-witted and shouldn’t be socialized with, becomes a caveat for the child and clouds their judgement. As Chimamanda Adichie says, “Show a people as one thing, as only one thing, over and over again and that is what they become.”\n\nSo when Lilkee’s friends in the building discover her for who she really is — a fair, compassionate and intelligent girl — they are forced to question the biases fed to them, and learn the essential lesson of looking beyond the stereotype.\n\n—\n\nWatch: Lilkee\n\nLanguage: Hindi\n\nStarring: Arjun Jaykrishna, Naseeruddin Shah, Tom Alter\n\nDirector: Virendra Saini\n\nFoto, an introverted 11-year-old boy, prefers to dwell in his world of imagination. When a film crew arrives in town, Foto’s creativity takes wings.\n\nIn her now legendary TED talk, The Power of Introverts, Susan Cain speaks about the dominant culture predisposed to undervalue introverts. Our principal establishments like offices, educational and religious institutions are designed for extroverts. Cain recalled her time at a school summer camp where her not being chatty and outgoing was considered NOT okay. Introversion is often misconstrued as a personality disorder, and introverts are made to feel inadequate and prompted to come out of their shells.\n\nIn Virendra Saini’s Foto, the eponymous character (Krishna) is a soft-spoken, reserved boy with a vivid imagination, who struggles with studies and at making friends. Amidst admonitions and snickers, the young boy finds encouragement from his mother, Shefali (played graciously by Geeta Agarwal Sharma), who has the prudence to identify his creativity. In fact, she names her boy so for his penchant for imagery.\n\nSaini had greatly emphasized support and positive reinforcement as the essentials of good parenting in his maiden venture Kabhi Paas, Kabhi Fail (1999). Foto, his sophomore outing, too, reiterates it. In the film, when Foto’s teachers raise concern about something being “wrong” with him, Shefali shuts down the discussion politely. Instead she has an interesting conversation with her son about his ideas and suggests a pragmatic way to channel his thoughts.\n\nWhen a film crew arrives in his town for a shoot, Foto’s imagination finds a footing. He is dazzled by the world of props, colors, sets, sound and music, and the miracle workers who make it thunder and rain in a jiffy.\n\nArmed with a copy of David Robinson’s The History of World Cinema and guidance from his ‘magician’ friend, Foto learns about cinema history, landmark films, and the various aspects of filmmaking. Foto’s flight of fantasy is often disrupted by a skeptic from the Imagination Detection & Prevention Squad, but the young learner chugs along.\n\nAs the shy, inventive Foto, Arjun Jaykrishna is a natural. The twinkle in his eyes and sweet-sounding voice reminds me of the adorable Jugal Hansraj. Interestingly, Foto’s magician friend here is played by Naseeruddin Shah. Ambling around in the idyllic Ranikhet, his delightful conversations with Arjun are strangely reminiscent of the ones in Masoom (1983). The warmth and charming effortlessness Shah brings to his unnamed character is a reminder of the gifted actor he is. The film is also peppered with cameos from several familiar faces with a special mention to theatre veteran Uday Chandra playing the skeptic.\n\nFoto gives a dreamy and whimsical aura to the arduous process of filmmaking and in doing so tips its hat to cinema pioneers who dared to create the magical world of motion picture. The film’s wholehearted admiration for the craft and conviction needed to pursue it would resonate with anyone who has a love affair with the movies.\n\n—\n\nAwards\n\nNational Film Award for Best Children’s Film (Year 2007)\n\nWatch: Foto"
