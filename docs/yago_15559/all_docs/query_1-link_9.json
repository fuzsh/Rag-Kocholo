        "text": "Estimate the Cost of\n\nYour License\n\nStart planning your production with a cost estimate you can save and share with your team. Just answer a few questions.\n\nThis estimator is only for non-Equity/amateur productions. Equity/professional customers should contact the Licensing department directly at [email protected].\n\nImportant:\n\nThe cost quoted is an estimate only and may differ when you apply for a license.\n\nSwallow, a 15-year-old girl growing up in America’s deep South in the fifties, discovers a mysterious man hiding out in a barn. When she asks who he is and the first words he utters are “Jesus Christ,” it’s as if all her prayers have been answered.\n\nSwallow and the town’s other children vow to protect the stranger from the world that waits outside—the townspeople who are determined to catch a fugitive hiding in their midst. As fantasy and reality collide, Swallow is torn between the two and begins to discover who she is and where she is going.\n\nAndrew Lloyd Webber’s emotive score combines hauntingly beautiful love songs and explosive rock music, with lyrics by acclaimed Meat Loaf and Bonnie Tyler songwriter Jim Steinman. The score features “No Matter What,” which was covered by Boyzone, hitting number one in 18 countries.\n\nWhistle Down the Wind contrasts the relentless influence of the modern world with the traditional values of the old days—something which the community at its heart yearns to return to. The show is a great choice for secondary/high schools and programs with a broad talent pool of young performers.\n\nWhistle Down the Wind is based on the novel by Mary Hayley Bell and subsequent Richard Attenborough-produced film of the same name. Andrew Lloyd Webber and Jim Steinman, together with Patricia Knop and Gale Edwards (co-book writers with Lloyd Webber) reset the original story in Louisiana in 1959.\n\nThe musical made its world premiere in 1996 at Washington D.C.’s National Theatre, helmed by Harold Prince. A reworked production, directed by Edwards, opened on July 1, 1998 at the West End’s Aldwych Theatre, where it ran for 1,044 performances and closed in January 2001. Whistle has since undertaken two U.K. tours and also went on the road in the U.S. in 2007-2008.\n\nThe 1998 concept album features 12 of the songs from the show, including Boyzone’s massive hit “No Matter What,” Tom Jones singing \"Vaults of Heaven,\" Tina Arena taking on the title track, Donny Osmond’s rendition of \"When Children Rule the World,\" Meat Loaf’s \"A Kiss Is a Terrible Thing to Waste\" and Bonnie Tyler’s \"Tire Tracks and Broken Hearts.\"\n\nAct 1\n\n“Keys to the Vaults of Heaven” – Minister, Congregation\n\n“Overture” – Orchestra\n\n“What’s He Doin’” – Poor Baby, Swallow, Brat, Kids\n\n“Earl – Amos” – Earl, Swallow, Brat, Poor Baby\n\n“Cold” – [Radio]\n\n“Grown Ups Kill Me” – Boone\n\n“Whistle Down the Wind” – Boone, Swallow, Poor Baby\n\n“Cold” – Edward, Local Men, Girls\n\n“For the Sake of the Children” – Sheriff, Chorus\n\n“Soliloquy” – Man\n\n“If Only” – Swallow, Man\n\n“Tire Tracks” – Candy, Amos\n\n“Safe Haven” – Townspeople, Deputy\n\n“Long Overdue for a Miracle” – Vikki, Louise, Clarence, Louis, Jackie, Lavonne, Ramona, Elizabeth, Curly, Brat, Poor Baby, Kids, Children\n\n“Annie Christmas” – Man, Poor Baby, Clarence, Swallow, Children, Kids\n\n“No Matter What” – Charity, Vikki, Lavonne, Louise, Elizabeth, Clarence, Curly, Brat, Swallow, Men, Women\n\nAct 2\n\n“Opening Act 2” – Ensemble\n\n“Try not to be Afraid” – Man, Swallow\n\n“Let’s Make a Promise” – Amos\n\n“A Kiss is a Terrible Thing to Waste” – Amos, Swallow, Man, Candy\n\n“Over Here” – Earl\n\n“If Your Mother” – Boone\n\n“No Matter What (Reprise)” – Poor Baby, Swallow\n\n“Annie Christmas (Reprise)” – Man, Swallow, Kids\n\n“So Many Cries” – Man\n\n“Off Ramp Exit” – Candy\n\n“Now the Noose” – Mob, Poor Baby, Swallow, Earl, Townspeople\n\n“Wrestle with the Devil” – Preacher, Woman, Person 1, Person 2, Candy, Amos, Sheriff, Local 1, Local 2, Townspeople, Mob\n\n“No Matter What the Outrage” – Mob, Children\n\n“There’s a Prayer” – Swallow\n\n“The Nature of the Beast” – Man, Swallow\n\n“The Thunder is Rolling” – Kids, Swallow Boone, Family"
