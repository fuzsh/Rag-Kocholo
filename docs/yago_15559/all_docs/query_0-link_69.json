        "text": "The digitally restored version of the film will be a part of Cinema XXI section celebrating 100 Years of Indian Cinema\n\nOM-DAR-BA-DAR a 1988 post modernist avant garde film, directed by auteur filmmaker Kamal Swaroop and produced by National Film Development Corporation (NFDC), in its digitally restored version executed by NFDC, will be showcased at the forthcoming Rome Film Festival (08 – 17 Nov, 2013). The film will be screened in the out of competition section in Cinema XXI, marking the special celebrations of 100 Years of Indian Cinema, at the festival, this year.\n\nThe jury for Cinema XXI is lead by well-known director Larry Clark and a team of five leading film and culture figures. CinemaXXI is a competitive selection of films devoted to new trends in world cinema embracing various genres and lengths. The category will focus on works that reflect the continuous reinvention of cinema in the contemporary audiovisual landscape.\n\nA cult classic film, OM-DAR-BA-DAR, stars Anita Kanwar, Aditya Lakhia, and Gopi Desai in lead roles, with screenplay by Kamal Swaroop, dialogues by Kuku, Music by Rajat Dholakia, Cinematography by Ashwani Kaul, and Edited by Priya Krishnaswamy.\n\nAbout OM-DAR-BA-DAR\n\nAs Om rides a bicycle, scissor legged, the landscape (Pushkar- Ajmer) resounds with distinctive voices: his father's rebellions against the world, his 'bold' sister, her gentle suitor, the searching eyes of the runaway actress, the local businessman trying to protect the diamonds he has shat.. the rebellion of the tadpoles. The filmmaker takes on the frightening, beautiful energy of adolescence – to joyfully shake open the landscapes of his own childhood, unearthing and mixing politics with mythology and techno music with biology for Alchemy.\n\nCommenting on the selection of OM-DAR-BA-DAR at Rome Film Festival, director Kamal Swaroop, said, “I am very happy to have OM-DAR-BA-DAR make a comeback, now in it’s restored version, reaching out to newer audiences! It’s an honour that the film will be a part of the well attended Rome Film Festival and I am hoping that the people attending it love and enjoy every bit of the film thoroughly.”\n\nNina Lath Gupta, Managing Director- National Film Development Corporation, said, “We are delighted to have OM-DAR-BA-DAR, one of the many landmark films from our catalogue, in its restored version, at the Rome Film Festival, this year. A film that is known to have created a benchmark for many filmmakers, and continues to even today, will once again make it to the festival circuit, as a tribute to 100 Years of Indian Cinema. It's our endeavour to support and promote Cinemas of India across the globe and we will continue to do so with every opportunity across existing and emerging avenues'.\n\nAbout NFDC Cinemas of India\n\nEstablished in 1975, NFDC has over the years produced noteworthy films with acclaimed filmmakers like Gandhi by Richard Attenborough, The Making of the Mahatma by Shyam Benegal, Salaam Bombay by Mira Nair, Dance of the Wind by Rajan Khosa, Rudaali by Kalpana Lajmi, Party by Govind Nihalani, Jaane Bhi Do Yaaron by Kundan Shah.
