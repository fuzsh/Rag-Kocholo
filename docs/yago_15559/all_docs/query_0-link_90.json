Born in Mumbai, India, on August 18, 1946, she embarked on her cinematic journey at a tender age of nine, making her debut in the movie Gunga Jumna (1961). Over the years, Irani's prowess as a skilled actress has been showcased in over 300 films across multiple languages including Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, and Kannada. Irani's acting prowess is not confined to just one genre or character type. She has successfully portrayed a myriad of roles, showcasing her versatility and talent. From playing leading roles in movies like Bombay To Goa (1972) and Do Phool (1973), to memorable supporting roles in films such as Beta (1992) and Dil To Pagal Hai (1997), Irani's performances have always been marked by their authenticity. Her exceptional portrayal of characters won her the Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actress twice and she was honored with the Filmfare Lifetime Achievement Award in 2012, solidifying her place in the annals of Indian cinema. Apart from her illustrious acting career, Aruna Irani also made significant contributions as a filmmaker.

Like their films, his films also dealt with light-hearted stories of middle-class families often in urban settings, focusing on marital and love relationships, with exceptions such as Ek Ruka Hua Faisla (1986) and Kamla Ki Maut (1989), which delved into social and moral issues.
