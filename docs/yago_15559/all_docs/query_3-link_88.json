        "text": "Summary of the new releases at the cinema this week (these films are releasing today in the UK and India, release dates may vary for other countries).\n\nEnglish\n\nThis week, there is only one major film releasing – but what a film it is. The day has finally arrived! The conclusion to Chris Nolan’s Batman trilogy has been released. The hype for this film has been enormous, what with showings of Batman Begins and The Dark Knight on Thursday night, leading onto a 5am showing of the The Dark Knight Rises.\n\nThe film has received positive reviews so far, in particular receiving a 5 star review from Empire. This is a film I can’t wait to watch, and the review will be up here before the end of the weekend.\n\nHindi\n\nNo major Hindi releases this week in India, and no Hindi releases at all in the UK. Of the films that are releasing in India, the most promising release appears to be Gattu, a film produced by the Children’s Film Society of India, and directed by Rajan Khosa. This film has received generally good reviews, and has done the round of film festivals, but does appear to appeal to a niche audience.\n\nThe other release of the week is the long delayed Mere Dost Picture Abhi Baki Hai, starring Suniel Shetty, Udita Goswami, Rajpal Yadav, Om Puri and Shayan Munshi. The film is written and directed by Rajnish Raj Thakur, whose last film Loot was a complete mess (and one of the very few films I’ve abandoned half way – and I’ve seen some pretty awful films in my time!). The film is supposedly a satire on the Hindi film industry, but with next to no pre-release promotion, and no real A list actors, I don’t see this one lasting long in the theatres.\n\nTelugu\n\nProducer MS Raju’s son Sumanth Ashwin makes his debut in this week’s release Tuneega Tuneega. Also making her debut in this film is heroine Ria Chakravarthi. Raju has produced blockbuster films such as Okkadu with Mahesh Babu, and Nuvvostantane Nennodantana with Siddharth and Trisha Krishnan. This film is ‘romantic family entertainer’, and has music by Karthik Raja."
