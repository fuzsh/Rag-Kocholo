        "text": "But on Monday — amid intense reflections on depictions of race and policing in popular culture after protests about police brutality — the filmmaker John Ridley wrote an op-ed in The Los Angeles Times pleading with HBO Max to remove “Gone With the Wind” from its streaming library. “It is a film that glorifies the antebellum south,” wrote Ridley, who won an Oscar for the “12 Years a Slave” screenplay. “It is a film that, when it is not ignoring the horrors of slavery, pauses only to perpetuate some of the most painful stereotypes of people of color.”\n\nOn Tuesday night, the service temporarily pulled the film from its catalog, citing the need for “an explanation and a denouncement” of the movie’s depictions of race relations — presumably something similar to the “outdated cultural depictions” disclaimer offered on some titles on Disney Plus.\n\nIn fact, “Gone With the Wind” is no stranger to controversy. Here’s a quick explainer.\n\nI’ve never seen the movie. What’s the story?\n\nAs with Mitchell’s best-selling novel, “Gone With the Wind” is set on a Georgia plantation during and after the Civil War. The protagonist is Scarlett O’Hara (Viven Leigh), headstrong daughter of the plantation owner, and the primary focus of the narrative is her romantic exploits. But a fair amount of the film’s leisurely 221-minute running time is spent on the struggle to keep the plantation afloat, and on Scarlett’s relationships with the family’s slaves, including Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), Pork (Oscar Polk) and Mammy (Hattie McDaniel, who won an Oscar for her performance — the first African-American so honored).\n\nWhat do critics object to?\n\nAs Ridley notes, the primary point of contention is the film’s romanticizing of the antebellum South, and its whitewashing of the horrors of slavery. The film presents the region’s pre-Civil War era as a utopia of tranquil living, and the Northern forces as interlopers, trying to disrupt that way of life. The servant characters are written and played as docile and content, more dedicated to their white masters than to the struggle of their fellow enslaved people (and uninterested in leaving the plantation after the war). And, much like D.W. Griffith’s horrifying hit “The Birth of a Nation,” the film casts the freed slaves of the Reconstruction era as morally dangerous and politically naïve.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
