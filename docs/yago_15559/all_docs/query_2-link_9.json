        "text": "Rajan Khosa worked as a ‘Dramaturg’ on Escapade with artistic director Keith Khan. Attended by over six thousand spectators, ESCAPADE took Southbank Centre in London by storm on 1 and 2 August 2003. With a cast of one hundred performers and large scale film projections on the colossal walls of Royal Festival Hall. Spaces here were teeming with carnival punks, dancers, percussionists and, at the end of it all, fireworks. ESCAPADE couldn’t help but live up to its name."
