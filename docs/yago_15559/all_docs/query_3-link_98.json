        "text": "By Glamsham Editorial\n\nHe is the boy wonder from the small town of Roorkee, Uttrakand who bagged the lead role in the Children's Film Society, India film GATTU by being the best out of 300 and more kids.\n\nFor Mohammad Samad (GATTU), director Rajan Khosa changed the story to fit his personality. And now filmmaker Anurag Kashyap has got charmed by the little one. The 11-years-old bagged a role in Anurag Kashyap Production's next, MINTO, directed by Slok who was Anurag's assistant.\n\nAnurag saw the promo of the movie GATTU and immediately wanted to meet the kid. \"He just wanted Samad for the role of this naughty kid from Ahmedabad. Samad was specially called to Mumbai from Roorkee to give a screen test to Anurag. The filmmaker took care of the stay and tickets of the kid and his father,\" says a source close to the film.\n\nNawazuddin Siddiqui will play the lead role in this movie. Director of Samad's first movie Rajan who is taking the film to Edinburgh Film Festival, is very happy for him. \"Samad is like Sridevi when she used to be a child artist. Camera loves him and he is a natural in front of it. He acts with an ease that makes working with this kid easy,\" says Rajan.\n\nCFSI's chairperson, Nandita Das seconds Rajan's feeling. \"We are already very proud of our film Gattu and we love how Samad has worked in this film. He is a bright child and I know for a fact that he will do brilliantly wherever he goes and whatever he does,\" says Nandita.\n\nGATTU will release in India on July 20th and will be distributed all over the country by Rajshri Productions."
