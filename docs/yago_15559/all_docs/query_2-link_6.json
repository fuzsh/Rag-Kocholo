        "text": "Language: Hindi\n\nStarring: Mohammad Samad, Naresh Sharma, Jayanta Das\n\nDirector: Rajan Khosa\n\nAn illiterate orphan boy dreams of becoming the town’s top kite flyer and will take an unusual path to achieve his goal.\n\nTen years ago when Rajan Khosa’s Gattu opened at the International Children’s Film Festival in Hyderabad, it created an instant buzz. The goodwill carried on at a global level — it won awards and accolades alike at various film fests. The universal appeal of this little film about kids, steeped in the local milieu of a small North-Indian city, is not difficult to see. Gattu is an endearing story of a disadvantaged child who achieves his dream with wit, a little luck, and lots of pluck. And Khosa tells it with great humanity and candour.\n\nGattu (Mohammad Samad) is an illiterate orphan fostered by Anees (Naresh Sharma), a stern but well-intentioned scrap dealer who trains him with a firm hand. Like Gattu, Anees is kinless and together they make an unlikely unit. Anees never misses a chance to remind Gattu of how better off he is compared to other street children — with a roof over his head, earning his daily bread and a vocational skill to learn. “Humaari toh zindagi hi aisey nikal gayi, humein nahin seekhaya kisine kaam. Yahaan wahaan bhatak bhatak ke kaam seekha,” he reflects hoping the young boy would pay heed and secure his future. But the cheeky, quick-witted Gattu, who cooks up excuses and makes up stories on the fly, has other motivations: flying kites and beating Kali — the enigmatic owner of a black kite that soars high in the skies of Roorkee trouncing every patang that crosses its path.\n\nHaving lost seven kites to Kali and constantly ridiculed by neighbourhood’s bigger players, Gattu’s resolve grows stronger. What our pint-sized protagonist lacks is not the craft or tools of kite-flying but access to the terrace of tall building to fly his kite from that will level him up with Kali. As it so happens, it’s the primary school that’s the tallest building in the area and Gattu would have to make an audacious move to approach it.\n\nLuckily for him, the school hosts a student exchange programme, so Gattu flicks a uniform, a schoolbag and sneaks in. Biding his time to get to the roof, he mingles with students, devices clever ways to deflect attention off his illiterate status while discovering classroom bonhomie and the joys of learning new things such as science, stories, and colouring. But when his ruse is uncovered by three classmates, Gattu pretends to be an undercover agent assigned to thwart a terror attack on the school. To do so he needs to fly a kite from the school rooftop which would be a “secret signal” to his bosses. The trio join the quest fully convinced they are a part of a secret plan to save their alma mater with ‘Agent Gattu’ as their commander. Whether they succeed in their mission and does Gattu manage to defeat Kali forms the rest of the story.\n\nSet in Roorkee the film offers a contrasting and crucial depiction of the educational hub — through the perspective of the children living on the margins — ragpickers, child labourers struggling to survive. A sheltered existence and access to proper education for them is an unattainable privilege. Neither sensational nor patronising, the film views their harsh realities with a conscious and empathetic gaze. For instance, Gattu’s awareness of his circumstances and lack of opportunities is such that the thought of attending school doesn’t occur to him until he goes to one. In a most affecting scene, the young boy enquires about his past to Anees and wonders if his father is still around only to be advised to not harbour any such hopes. Despite his precociousness, a moment of vulnerability such as this is a reminder that Gattu is merely a child.\n\nThe film creates a faithful portrait of small city life: teeming houses, narrow lanes bustling with shops and small businesses, rooftops occupied with kite flyers, children running around in the streets, and people going about their daily affairs. Every now and then, the duelling kites cause traffic bottlenecks — bystanders await the patangbaazi’s outcome and eager kids wait to claim the fallen prize.\n\nKhosa captures the communal experience of kite flying evocatively. The images of bright kites swirling in the skies, the crackling sound of maanja-laced thread unrolling from the spool, the struggle to find a favourable flying spot, players trading insults across terraces, and quick alliances being struck to take on a common adversary are greatly immersive.\n\nFurthermore, the filmmaker makes a brilliant use of humour and matter-of-fact observations for the sarkaari school infrastructure running on a strapped-but-functional philosophy. The school building that forms the central setting is an average rundown structure with faded walls, crammed classrooms and dingy toilets but is of great significance to the committed teachers and staff who run it and the boisterous bunch of kids who spend their day here learning, playing and sharing tiffins.\n\nMost of the children featuring in the film are non actors and bring an element of naturalism in their performances led by a winsome Samad suitably cast as Gattu. His gait, body language, and dialogue delivery in playing the mischievous minor is perfectly effortless and a precursor to the promising career (Tumbadd, ’18; Selection Day, ’18, Chhichhore, ’19) this spontaneous young actor would have in showbiz.\n\nLike a majority of the children’s cinema in India, Gattu, too, found backing with the Children’s Film Society of India, the government body behind some the most significant children’s programming like Bal Doot, Potli Baba Ki, Jadoo Ka Shankh, Halo, Karamati Coat among others. Children’s cinema is a particularly difficult genre to navigate as budget constraints and audience reach remains a struggle. Moreover, children’s films are expected to have moral values which often results in them being unnecessarily didactic. Gattu manages this expectation tremendously well without compromising on the craft and storytelling thereby opening itself to a wider set of audience. It is a great example of cinema for children without infantilizing them. In the end, everyone has something to learn — both kids and the adults — with a lovely surprise thrown in and some pleasant outcomes."
