Set in the turbulence of the 1930s British India, Chittagong is a true story of a 14-year-old boy, Jhunku, and of his journey to find where he belongs. For the first time in Indian history, the British army is defeated by a ragtag army of schoolboys and their teacher, Masterda. Called a traitor by his peers, and let down by a man he trusts, Jhunku impulsively joins the movement. As his world is turned upside down, Jhunku is forced to confront his self-doubts. As the leaders of the movement are progressively caught or killed, Jhunku battles against seemingly insurmountable odds to win a victory of his own. The film is a brilliant, poignant action-drama, made more so by the fact that it is true.\n\nThe film “Gangs of Wasseypur.” Photo: New York Indian Film Festival.\n\nGangs of Wasseypur (Anurag Kashyap). Towards the end of colonial India, Shahid Khan loots the British trains, impersonating the legendary Sultana Daku. Now outcast, Shahid becomes a worker at Ramadhir Singh’s colliery, only to spur a revenge battle that passes on to generations. At the turn of the decade, Shahid’s son, the philandering Sardar Khan vows to get his father’s honor back, becoming the most feared man of Wasseypur. In contemporary times, the weed addicted grandson, Faizal Khan, wakes up to this vengeance that his family has inherited. Staying true to its real life influences, the film explores this revenge saga through the socio-political dynamic in erstwhile Bihar (North India), in the coal and scrap trade mafia of Wasseypur, through the imprudence of a place obsessed with mainstream ‘Bollywood’ cinema. Having been in Bihar just a few months ago, I was delighted to see the geography on the big screen.\n\nOne of my favorite actors, Rituparno Ghosh, agonizes over his decision to have a\n\nsex change in Chitrangada. Photo: New York Indian Film Festival.\n\nChitrangada. Rituparno Ghosh faces the camera again in the role of a choreographer who plans to stage the dance drama Chitrangada on the occasion of Rabindranath’s 150th birth anniversary. Rituparno Ghosh is Rudra Chatterjee in this Bengali movie Chitrangada and the character’s nick name is Khokon. Rudra Chatterjee was interested in art from his childhood but he studied Engineering as his father wanted him to study in technical stream. There was a conflict between the father and son, ultimately the son, Rudra became a choreographer. This is the point where the story of the new Bengali film Chitrangada coincides with Rabindranath Tagore’s Chitrangada. In Tagore’s Chitrangada, the King of Manipur wants to see his daughter Chitrangada as prince of Manipur since he doesn’t have a son but Chitrangada wants to remain a girl. Watching the Festival with my old friend Sundaram Tagore, Rabindranath’s grandson, made it that much more exciting. Sundaram serves as an advisor to the Indo-American Arts Council.\n\nFrom the film “Varnam.” Photo: New York Indian Film Festival.\n\nThe final awards are:\n\nBest Director. Presented by director Anurag Kashyap to Sujay Dahake for Shala.\n\nBest Film. Presented by Rahul Baig of Wells Fargo to Gattu by Rajan Khosa.\n\nSpecial Contribution to Indian Cinema Award. Presented to actor/director Rituparno Ghosh.\n\nLifetime Achievement Award. Presented to director Shyam Benegal.\n\nFounder and director of the Indo-American Arts Council (IAAC) with her mother.\n\nPhoto courtesy of Archana Desai.\n\nFilm can entertain, but it is also the best tool known for informing and uplifting humanity to a higher plain. Films such as Saving Face about the plight of acid attack play an integral role in allowing us to see what is wrong with the world so we can focus on righting it. Films such as Bombay Snow, Shala, Gattu, feed the soul. Directors such as Rituparno Ghosh and Shyam Benegal create worlds that we may visit by simply entering a theater. The arts are man at its best, even when focused on humanity at its worst. The Indo-American Film Festival and its founder and director Aroon Shivdasani is to be commended for her decades-long efforts to promote cultural literacy, and especially for the triumph this week of the 12th Annual New York Indian Film festival.\n\nIndo-American Arts Council (IAAC)\n\nThe oldest and largest Indian arts organization outside India, it was founded by Aroon Shivdasani in New York City.\n\nNew York Indian Film Festival (NYIFF)\n\nA project of the Indo-American Arts Council, NYIFF is the oldest and largest Indian film festival outside India. 2012 is its twelfth year.\n\nSpecial thanks to Indian film expert Zoran Saher for his assistance.\n\nSee Stories by Jim Luce on:\n\nFilm | India and Indian-American Culture | New York\n\nMeet the Amazing Aroon Shivdasani of NYC's Indo-American Arts Council\n\nIndo-American Arts Council Fete Recreates Mughal Court in Manhattan\n\nThought Leader and Global Citizen, India’s Filmmaker Mira Nair\n\nMani Ratnam's Raavanan: The Must-See International Film of 2010\n\nEleventh Annual New York Indian Film Festival Triumphant!\n\nIndian Legend Ustad Amjad Ali Khan and Sons Perform in NYC\n\nThe James Jay Dudley Luce Foundation (www.lucefoundation.org) is the umbrella organization under which The International University Center Haiti (Uni Haiti) and Orphans International Worldwide (OIWW) are organized.
