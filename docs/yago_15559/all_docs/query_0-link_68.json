        "text": "Having made ‘ Gattu' on the plight of deprived street children, director Rajan Khosa talks to Madhur Tankha about his journey from filming to promoting it.\n\nIn the genre of I am Kalam , another feature film will now seek to raise awareness about education of underprivileged children. Film-maker Rajan Khosa's Gattu is about a street child who in his quest to fulfil his dream realises the significance of education.\n\nLike I am Kalam , the film is travelling to international film festivals before its release in the country.\n\n“Films like ours have to first make a name for themselves at international film festivals. Thankfully, Gattu was able to woo the audience at the recently held 62 Berlin Film Festival and got a special mention because all its shows were sold out. Our protagonist was fondly described as an endearing little rascal at the festival,” says Rajan, an alumnus of Film and Television Institute of India and Royal College of Art (London).\n\nTwo years ago, Children's Film Society, India, chairperson Nandita Das approached the film-maker to make a sensitive film on education, particularly the need for underprivileged children to become literate.\n\n“So I worked on the script along with four writers for a year. We then presented the script to Nandita, who apart from being a talented actor is also a sensitive director ( Firaaq ). She went through the script and incorporated some changes. So CFSI is producing this film. We were clear that the film has to motivate children living on streets about the importance of education. Ideally, we would like philanthropists to provide funds for their education. But we have conveyed the message in a subtle way,” says Rajan.\n\nSince Rajan's co-writer Ankur Tiwari hails from Roorkee, he recommended the city saying it would be an ideal venue for shooting.\n\nVisiting Roorkee was an unbelievable experience for Rajan. The city resembles the Walled City of Delhi where he grew up. “The people were friendly and the atmosphere was contagious. When the locals came to know that our film was being made for a noble cause, they in their large-heartedness volunteered to vacate their homes. Some even sent their children to act in the film. Since we wanted to retain the local flavour, we took child actors and the local people.”\n\nThe movie stars Mohammad Samad as Gattu, a little street urchin. He was selected only after umpteen auditions and workshops. Naresh Kumar is playing the role of Anees Bhai and Sandesh Shandilya has composed the music.\n\nGattu will take film buffs to a town where children and grown-ups are equally obsessed with kite-flying. The airspace is dominated by a black kite called Kali with mysterious origins. “Gattu is keen to emerge a winner against Kali but he fails. Not the one to give up, he discovers that the local school has a roof that will give him a vantage point. Impersonating as a student, Gattu sneaks into the school but has to rely on his street-smartness to survive. The only problem is that Gattu is unlettered. Instead of quitting, the little boy takes up the challenge of emerging victorious against Kali. Slowly but gradually, he realises the significance of education.”\n\nThe character of Gattu has been played by Samad Mohammad, who is a natural kite flyer. “In almost every small town in the country, you see street kids, selling trinkets, playing pranks and begging. You either ignore them or dole out a coin or two but they are far too smart to be wasted like this. So in Gattu , we deliberately chose a small town,” adds Rajan.\n\nThe film belongs to the community of Sati Mohallah in Roorkee where Rajan shot mostly with local actors barring a few theatre artistes. “We scanned the streets and schools for child actors, inviting them to join our film workshop. The film also talks about Hindu-Muslim unity and captures the environment around the Sati Mohallah which is inhabited predominantly by Muslims. We told the locals that the film will communicate the need to educate street children and they were enthusiastic about it. We plan to release the film across the country towards the end of April.”\n\nRajan came into the limelight when he wrote and directed Dance of the Wind which captured the beauty of ancient Indian music and dance. He had in the cast the learned and articulate scholar of Indian dance Kapila Vatsyayan and the music was provided by Hindustani classical singer Shubha Mudgal. “I was able to convince Kapilaji to do the film because I knew her since my childhood days. She played mother to Kitu Gidwani, who did the part of an Indian classical singer, whose career comes to an abrupt end after her mother expires. The singer, who studied under the guidance of her mother, also loses her voice and career.”\n\nThe prize-winning film was acclaimed at various international film festivals but was not a commercially viable project in the country."
