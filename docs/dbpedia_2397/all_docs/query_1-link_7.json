        "text": "If we read this in the context of Albanese government choosing $3 billiion student debt relief to benefit ordinary Australians most of whom are tax payers over the coalitionâ€™s tax cuts for major international corporations that costs more than $3 billion, we would all appreciate the student debt relief as a great economic decision by this government. Here is a screenshot of an article when the coalition were using the same resources for company tax cuts to benefit the economically to 1% and international corporations.\n\nHow Govt Plans to Free Public Universities from Debt The government has devised a plan to settle more than Sh60 billion in debt owed to public universities, with the first step being the phase-out of the current financing model, which has existed for more than three decades. #UniversitiesandColleges\n\nHow Govt Plans to Free Public Universities from Debt The government has devised a plan to settle more than Sh60 billion in debt owed to public universities, with the first step being the phase-out of the current financing model, which has existed for more than three decades. #UniversitiesandColleges\n\nHow Govt Plans to Free Public Universities from Debt The government has devised a plan to settle more than Sh60 billion in debt owed to public universities, with the first step being the phase-out of the current financing model, which has existed for more than three decades. #UniversitiesandColleges\n\nThe worst feature of the #uk #tax system is the marginal tax rate on earnings between Â£50k and Â£60k. With two children under the age of 16 and an outstanding #studentloandebt, the tax rate on those extra Â£10k is 72%! Yes, it is: 40% income tax + 2% NIC + 21% high income charge as you lose child benefits (Â£2,076/Â£10,000 = 21%) + 9% student loan repayment Imagine you have a base #salary of Â£50k and work really hard, extra hours, sometimes during the weekend too, but at the end of the year you finally get a nice 10k bonus, totally deserved. Except that you really get Â£2,800 cause Â£7,200 go to the Treasuryâ€¦how unfair is that?? And of course, if you have 3 kids the tax rate goes to 80%! Whoever wins the next (May?) #generalelection, MUST tackle this plain injustice! ðŸ˜¡ #rishisunak #keirstarmer\n\nThe Federal Government has announced it wants to shake up how HECS debts are indexed. What does this mean? Currently, around 3 million Australians have student loans, with the average debt sitting at $26,500. The proposed measure is set to reduce each student's outstanding HECS/HELP debt by approximately $1,200 this year. What are the proposed changes? The upcoming Federal Budget will introduce a significant reform to HECS and HELP loans to prevent student debts from outpacing wage growth. The reform proposes capping the indexation rate of these loans to the lower of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or the Wage Price Index (WPI). Pending legislative approval, this change would be applied retroactively from June 1, 2023, reversing last yearâ€™s indexation rate of 7.1%. This ensures a fairer and more sustainable approach to managing student debt. Will the proposed changes become law? We'll know more once the Federal Budget is handed down on the 14th May 2024. #Studentdebt #university #HECSdebt #education"
