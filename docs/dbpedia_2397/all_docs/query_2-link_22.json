        "text": "Boro reached the knockout stages of the Uefa Cup after sharing a goalless draw with Dutch side AZ Alkmaar.\n\nStill to concede a goal in Europe this season, Boro defended superbly and goalkeeper Brad Jones made several important saves to frustrate AZ.\n\nJones made a reaction save from a Kenneth Perez shot in the opening half and late in the game the Australian keeper frustrated Danny Koevermans.\n\nBoro's best chances came in the first-half from striker Mark Viduka.\n\nThe match at AZ's Alkmaardehout stadium was played in filthy conditions with frequent bursts of driving wind and rain.\n\nThe atrocious conditions made defending difficult and there were plenty of goalmouth scrambles.\n\nMartijn Meerdink should have capitalised from one of those scrambles but somehow he managed to scoop the ball over the bar.\n\nThe match included some nasty tackles, with George Boateng receiving a yellow card for his foul on Gretar Steinsson.\n\nSoon after Steinsson left Boateng writhing in agony as the Icelandic defender sought his own retribution.\n\nGiven the horrible weather and the fact that AZ are the top scorers in the Dutch league, Boro's spirited rearguard action was even more commendable.\n\nChris Riggott and Ugo Ehiogu were superb in the centre of the Boro defence making a series of effective blocks and tackles.\n\nJust past the hour Riggott even found time to get forward and he went close with a looping header.\n\nWith 10 minutes left Ehiogu made an important block after Jones' poor punch allowed Barry van Galen a sight of goal.\n\nJones was to make up for his lapse when he stood up well to Koevermans when the AZ forward was through on goal.\n\nWith Viduka and Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink partnered in attack and Szilard Nemeth just behind that striking duo, Boro were never content to just sit back and soak up AZ's attacks.\n\nViduka forced Henk Timmer to make the game's first save, the AZ keeper clearing the Australian's low shot with his feet.\n\nMidway through the opening half Viduka drew another reaction save from Timmer, who this time pushed the ball past the post with his hand.\n\nSoon after it Jones' turn to come under pressure and the Boro keeper was relieved when Tarik Sektioui's goal was ruled out for offside, though television replays showed the officials had made an error of judgment.\n\nSektioui had forced the ball in after Jones made a double save to deny Kenneth Perez and Shota Arvaladze, but the former Rangers striker was waved offside.\n\nMiddlesbrough manager Steve McClaren:\n\n\"We had a few hectic moments, but you're going to get that. We kept them to a clean sheet and that was the main thing.\n\n\"After 20 minutes, we decided to go for the point and we did that comfortably.\n\n\"I told the players, 'You've come to one of the top teams in Europe and got a draw, so the future's bright'.\"\n\nAZ: Timmer, Jaliens, Mathijsen, De Cler, Landzaat, Arveladze (Koevermans 77), Van Galen, Perez, Sektioui (Meerdink 61), Steinsson, Schaars.\n\nSubs Not Used: Buskermolen, Huysegems, Vlaar, Zwarthoed, Ramzi.\n\nBooked: Schaars, Steinsson.\n\nMiddlesbrough: Jones, Bates, Ehiogu, Riggott, Pogatetz, Morrison (Parnaby 64), Doriva, Boateng, Nemeth (Queudrue 75), Hasselbaink, Viduka (Yakubu 64).\n\nSubs Not Used: Knight, Southgate, Maccarone, Johnson.\n\nBooked: Hasselbaink, Pogatetz, Boateng.\n\nAtt: 8,461.\n\nRef: Gianluca Paparesta (Italy)."
