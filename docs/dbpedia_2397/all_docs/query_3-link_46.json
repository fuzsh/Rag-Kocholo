        "text": "Hi,\n\nThere is this new bug in the Gumball Numeric entry function.\n\nWhen you click one of the arrows it takes a few milliseconds for the input box to open.\n\nBut this really drives me nuts. I use this field all the time and I really don’t want to wait a full second before typing in my values.\n\nI don’t know if you can see it, but when i click the arrow it has some delay before opening the field.\n\nSo to sum up:\n\nThe problem is: Latency between clicking the arrow and the field popping up.(you can test this out yourself)\n\nSolution would be: To remove this latancy / Make it even less, so the behaviour is more like rhino 7.\n\nHopefully you can fix this issue in the next update.\n\nThanks!\n\nMartijn\n\nWe discussed this already elsewhere.\n\nIn Rhino 7 you could CTRL-click to relocate gumball accurately. Translation, rotation and scale.\n\nYou digit a positive/negative number and when you press enter it do the thing. Simple, fast, obvious.\n\nIn Rhino 8 double-click, after entering the number + enter, it will result in the Gumball UI “hanging” there waiting for an additional click… making the sign of your number useless. Slower, FAR less intuitive.\n\nScale handles behave worse, now the number is used as absolute length instead of factor… no idea if this can be considered an actual improvement. I’d say it should behave the same as the single click, at least.\n\nOnce again, why change the CTRL-click for the gumball?\n\n“Don’t touch what is not broken…”\n\nPS\n\nDid someone at McNeel kept track of all these ““small”” (but potentially big) changes like this one?\n\nIt would be useful to even just read about all the changes, instead discovering them months later when you guys will no longer even remotely consider re-changing them.\n\nRemember that users have a different experience and opinion that you devs…\n\nHi Gijs,\n\nTnx for the reply. I agree that there is no delay in typing but there is a delay in confirming the number.\n\nIf the value you need is already there you would just left click, open input field, and immediately right click confirming the value. This is now a broken mechanic, right clicking to soon will make it behave like a repeat last command input.\n\nHere you see that my repeat last command was _Zoom _Selected. You clearly see that right clicking to soon will repeat that command instead of just confirming the value.\n\nPersonally I never freely move the gumball around. (only with _GumballAlignment).\n\nI hope that there is still an option to fix this and maybe change the double clicking machinic.\n\nThanks,\n\n-Martijn\n\nI’ve been running into this exact issue regularly in R8, finally realized what was happening and found this thread. I just downloaded 8.4.24023.15001 and it seems that the issue has been somewhat tackled but it’s still not perfect.\n\nThe behaviour is now quite inconsisent (or maybe I’m crazy and it did the same thing before too?). If I use Spacebar or right mouse click, it now does different things depending on how small the delay is. If I’m really fast (which I’m almost always TBH), it’s broken like before and last command is repeated. If I’m slow but even still slightly faster than the entry field appears, then it works as expected and gumball action is activated. But there’s also this hybrid state if the delay is between these too when it moves the object via the gumball action but it ALSO repeats last command.\n\nWeirdly enough, if I click gumball arrow and immediately press Enter or Num Enter key, then now matter how small the delay is, it always works perfectly! The only problem is I never use Enter when repeating last numeric entry as it’s the least conventient way if I’m not typing numbers on the num pad and instead have my right hand on my mouse.\n\nIs it possible that it’s only been fixed for Enter key but you forgot to also fix it for the two alternative ways to confirm action, that is spacebar and right click? Would it be easy to fix that too or is there some underlying reason why it behaves differently with these two?"
