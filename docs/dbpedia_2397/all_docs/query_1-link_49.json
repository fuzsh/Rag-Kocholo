        "text": "284 days since two weary but excited New Zealanders arrived at Schipol to be greeted by the smiling faces of Nico and Lammita.\n\n284 days of a Korfball odyssey to the other side of the world.\n\n284 days that has become the most unforgettable journey of my life.\n\nMy journey to Nijeveen began by meeting Nico, Lammita and Milanne in New Zealand. They kindly offered to see DOS ’46 would host two crazy kiwi’s wanting to come to the Netherlands to learn more Korfball from the best players and coaches in the world.\n\nArriving in Nijeveen 284 days ago, Rosa and I were just two lost kiwis about to fill ourselves with new experiences, Dutch culture, Dutch food and of course as much Korfball knowledge as we could fit into our brains. There was the first cycle around Nijeveen with Nico and Lammita seeing Sterrenberg, the Coop, Sportpark Tussenboerslanden and De Eendracht. There was the first Dutch Heineken, frikandel, kroket, stroopwafel and salted herring. At our first Donderdag Meppeldag we were introduced to some of the Dossers and the art of having two fingers of foam on a beer. Meeting players like Sven and Bastian it became obvious just how short we were. Nothing has changed; I still have a great appreciation for just how tall the average Dutch person is.\n\nLearning to drive on the other side of the road, from the other side of the car was another new challenge to conquer. There were definitely some moments where my brain went on autopilot, only to be fast reminded that the gear lever was on my right (not the left as it is in New Zealand), I can’t indicate to turn a corner with my windscreen wipers, and to put my seatbelt on I need to reach over my left shoulder (not the right shoulder). At least there was usually someone else in the car to laugh at my mistakes too.\n\nGradually we were introduced to many more members of DOS ’46; so many new faces, so many new names to remember. It seemed like an impossible task at the time to remember everyone we were meeting. However, everyone seemed to have no trouble remembering my name, even if many people did not want to say it or shout it on the korfball field. I found out my name sounded very similar to certain Dutch word and if you don’t know the joke already then you probably don’t need to know! These new faces became more familiar every day. Every person we met made such an incredible effort to speak English and to help these strange foreigners feel more at home in Nijeveen. I was also in for a surprise when I was introduced to Herman Van Gunst; he looks like a taller version of my own father!\n\nWhen the Korfball began it was another new challenge for both the outsiders and the members of DOS ’46 who had to deal two non-Dutch speakers trying to learn the DOS way. Training for the players and trainers of DOS 3 and 4 became instantly more difficult than ever before. I will be eternally grateful to Martijn and Roger for all of their patience and support trying to teach the kiwi korfballers. Having to do parts of team talks in English must have been a strange addition for them. Every player in DOS 3 and 4 must also be thanked for patiently translating instructions during training and games in those early days while we settled in to life at DOS ’46. No doubt due to communication difficulties and much less korfball experience, we were the source of increased frustrations for the players. But they continued to do everything they could to help us settle in and learn a few essential Dutch words. I will always appreciate the extra effort that everyone went to in those early days.\n\nAs you all know, unfortunately Rosa had to head back to New Zealand early, leaving this lone kiwi behind. Fortunately by this stage I was feeling much more settled in Nijeveen, having gained a reputation for good skills dancing on tables, wearing short pants and becoming known for my ‘pukana’ (Maori facial expression with your tongue poking out) after performing the Ka Mate haka at DOS Got Talent.\n\nAs the Korfball season continued, the learning curve continued to be steep for me. It is very difficult to try and catch up on years of korfball experience in such a short space of time. There were many mistakes along the way but slowly I started to understand more about the game and what I needed to be doing on court and at training. There was less of a need to translate practice drills into English and now I can get through most of training in Dutch without getting lost. During games I began to realize what I was supposed to do, usually a few seconds too late, but sometimes it would make sense and I would be doing the right things at the right time. I relied a lot on the help of my teammates from DOS 4 constantly reminding me what I should be doing. Unfortunately, with the injuries in the club, DOS 4 had a tough year and often didn’t have enough players to play. This was tough on everyone and limited my chance to learn during games. My DOS 4 teammates were great at keeping everything as fun as possible throughout the year and I really appreciate all of the support and advice they gave me throughout my time here. I think I will not understand just how much I have learned until I return to playing Korfball in New Zealand. I also look forward to helping New Zealand Korfball grow with all of the knowledge I have gained from my days here at DOS ‘46.\n\nThis was also my first Christmas away from my family. Firstly I was introduced to the Dutch festive tradition of Zwart Piet and Sint Nikolaas, and the international controversy surrounding Zwart Piet! Without family of my own, my new korfball family in Nijeveen took me into their homes during the holiday celebrations. There were two Christmas meals at my new home with Harmen and Margriet, including my first Gourmetten experience and Sjoelen competition. Nico and Lammita also added a special touch with a traditional trifle and pavalova when I joined them for a Christmas meal. Just like back home, there was a lot of fun had and too much food eaten. The excess consumption of food continued at new years with eating too many Oliebollen and Krentenbollen. I also learned just how much the Dutch enjoy making things explode with the fine art of Carbid Schieten and observing just how much the Dutch love fireworks.\n\nBeing a physiotherapist I was excited to be able to help the club out by being a physio for A1 as much as I could. Wim and Roger also gave me the chance to physio for the Noord U19 this year, traveling to both the Korfball Challenge and the Junior World Cup. Of course most of the excitement came with being a physio for DOS ’46 A1. After a solid season they battled Fortuna in the cross finals for a place in Ahoy. I had to watch the incredible first game from Dublin as I was away on another of my adventures. For the second and third games I was lucky to travel with the team to Delft, experiencing the elation of winning the tough third game and place in Ahoy. Then that day in Ahoy, wow, what an amazing day that was! The farewell from Nijeveen, the arrival at the holy grail of korfball, the game preparation and experiencing what goes on behind the scenes on Korfball’s big day, all built the excitement for game time. To be a kiwi on the floor in Ahoy and to be part of DOS ’46 A1 becoming champions made the day unforgettable. That day the team lived up to the motto of Eendracht Maakt Macht and it was special to see how the win brought the club together, especially as we arrived back to Nijeveen to such a great reception at the club. I’m certainly very happy to have a gold medal to take back to New Zealand with me.\n\nI have been very privileged to be part of DOS ’46. It feels that instead of just being the crazy kiwi making everyone speak English, I have become that crazy kiwi that is part of the great DOS family. I will always count myself lucky that the opportunity arose to come to Nijeveen after meeting Nico, Lammita and Milanne in New Zealand. As some people have said, this has been one of the toughest years they have ever known at the club, with the injuries and many staff changes (don’t forget having to speak much more English than normal too!). Remember, it is through these tough challenges that you learn and become stronger for the future. DOS ’46 will learn, will grow and will make it back to the Korfball League. DOS ’46 has the korfball knowledge to guide the incredible young talent in the club as they grow and mature into truly top players. Most importantly, DOS ’46 has an amazing club atmosphere that will positively infect anyone lucky enough to become part of the club and the DOS family. The reason why DOS has such a great club feel is that the people that make up the club, the players and the staff, the supporters and those who a prepared to stay in Nijeveen to help fundraising instead of going to Ahoy, all give DOS ‘46 great strength. Success will continue at DOS ’46. With the passion, the work ethic and following the club motto, the golden years will come again.\n\nA final thank you to Harmen and Margriet and also Nico and Lammita for opening the homes to me during my stay here in Nijeveen. Without them I would not have been able to live out this amazing experience. Thanks to the trainers and players of DOS 3, 4 and A1 for putting up with me and providing me with an amazing Korfball experience. Also to Wim and Roger for giving me the chance to join Noord U19. Obviously there are too many people to thank individually but everyone involved with DOS ’46 deserves a big thank you for everything you have done for me. You should continue to be proud of your great club from little Nijeveen. Come see me in New Zealand, you are all more than welcome and will be shown the same hospitality you have all shown me.\n\nMy time here at DOS ’46 is over (for now) and I must return to working life in New Zealand. I can truly say that I am a changed person from this experience, learning much from the Dutch way of life and from DOS ’46. I don’t think I will fully appreciate how much the last 284 days have affected me and how much I have learned until I return to New Zealand. I have found a new family and a new home here in Nijeveen. Part of my heart will stay here even after I have gone. I’m already excited to come back to Nijeveen to see you all again, share a beer and remember that time a kiwi came to DOS ’46.\n\nKia Kaha – Stay Strong\n\nEendracht Maakt Macht – Unity Is Strength\n\nTot Volgende Keer\n\nLorenzo\n\nAfter the excitement of Ahoy last week, it was time to enter my Dutch reality once again and refocus on what I want to achieve in the final countdown before I head back to New Zealand. Wow, it seems a bit surreal that my almost twelve month adventure away it almost complete. No doubt there will be a few reflective blog entries coming your way!\n\nAdmittedly it’s been a rather enjoyable week having a gold medal hanging around in my room and A1 captain Lisanne Koster said she rather enjoyed waking up to having the trophy sitting in her room each day. Now that trophy must join the rest of those at the field canteen that represent the history of success at DOS ’46.\n\nThis week also meant the return to training outdoors on the artificial field. I had forgotten how big the 60mx30m field was! There was certainly much more space to run on than the standard indoor 40mx20m court. It also meant that, weather permitting, the enjoyable rouge sunsets during training were also to return.\n\nSaturday was also my first game back outdoors with DOS ’46 4 after missing a couple of the teams games with doing my physio duties for the juniors. The game, against De Meeuwen 4, turned out to be a good exercise in figuring out how much I have learned during my time here. This was because I was matched up against the same player from when we first played this opposition back in September. Back then I had a solid lesson from my opponent in smart post play and getting your opponent of balance to get a running in chance. It was also a chance to see test out how my match skills were after not playing a game for two and half months.\n\nA windy day at the field made scoring quite difficult for frequent periods throughout the game, shots sometimes being blown significantly of course (and yes you could see them move in the air, they were not missing from horrendous shooting). Scoring was sparse for the first 20 minutes and while De Meeuwen was always keeping their noses in front they were never able to establish a telling lead in the first half. Against my opponent it was certainly much easier going than last year defensively and also getting free in attack. Unfortunately, the lack of match play was also telling, as I couldn’t score a goal from a number of good chances. At half time we were trailing by two at 5-7. I also had to remember we were now playing 35-minute halves!\n\nThe second half saw us slowly fall further behind and a couple of substations, where I was giving a rest, initially did not change this. At 6-10 things were not looking great for getting the first win of the second half of the field season for DOS ’46 4. Something finally clicked as the new players settled into the game and the boys started scoring. We scored seven unanswered goals through the rest of the game to eventually win 13-10. A highly satisfying feeling after the team having such a terrible hall season where we couldn’t even get enough players together for a team.\n\nIt was nice to at least have some idea that I have learned a few things during my time here after matching up against the same player and having a much easier experience. It was still evident that my play on court is much more conscious when compared with the automatic reactions of the locals who have played for many more years than I. I also think this was probably my last game as next week I am away at the U19 World Cup and will miss our match. Then our team is not scheduled for a game over the following two weeks and I depart the Netherlands on the following Saturday before we are due to play again.\n\nSunday it was off to the football with the boys, Ajax vs. ADO. I will try find some time soon to write another post about how that day went.\n\nBack in New Zealand my team was having a national training camp. I’m very excited to finally be able to join the team and the next training camp in a months time.\n\nThe countdown continues…….less than four weeks to go!\n\nTot Volgende Keer,\n\nLorenzo\n\nAhoy. Korfball’s annual Holy Grail event where the top Dutch club teams compete for the title of Landskampion. This year two kiwis, one was New Zealand Korfball mascot Koru, tagged along as part of the DOS ’46 A1 team who were competing in the youth (U19) final against PKC. Read on below for a behind the scenes kiwi perspective on Korfball’s big day out!\n\nAfter arriving back from Paris less than eight hours earlier, it was time me to join the Dossers from Nijeveen in assembling at De Eendracht to begin our journey to Ahoy, Rotterdam. While the players and management prepared themselves, in the field across from De Eendracht many club stalwarts and supporters were preparing for the annual Rommelmarkt (Flea Market), one of DOS’s most important fundraising events of the year. No doubt it was a tough decision for many of these Dossers to stay in Nijeveen and help run the market for the good of the club instead of heading to Ahoy to support DOS ’46 A1 in their quest to become Landskampion. Their contribution to the club must be heartily acknowledged.\n\nWith the team chariot loaded, we departed on our quest for success in Ahoy, supporters waving farewell to the bus from both sides of the street.\n\nThe journey itself was a fairly relaxed one, players enjoying a laugh and some of the old boys playing their traditional game of cards on the way. While I think my body would have appreciated a sneaky disco nap or siesta, there was no chance of that as the excitement continued to grow with each rotation of the buses wheels. Nearing Rotterdam we also passed by the home court of our rivals for the day PKC. It must be said however, that both clubs have a great friendship and respect for each other. Then slowly the signs pointing the way to our final destination started appearing, Ahoy looming large over the parks, both grass and car, that surround the building.\n\nEntering the cauldron of Ahoy through the ‘Backstage entrance’, the players had a relaxed but focused aura about them and as usual the medical team of Liena and myself played the pack horse role with all our of gear. Our team dressing rooms were adorned with a sticker of the DOS ’46 playing shirt. Now it was time to put our business socks on, it’s business time.\n\nThe team stepped out on to the Ahoy court to get some practice in and calibrate their senses to the Ahoy environment. The stark grey rubber court, bright yellow korfs standing proudly erect at each end, was encased by electronic billboards flashing brightly with the vivid colours of the sponsors. An empty line of chairs on each side of the jury bench sat waiting to be filled with the combatants of the day. Busily scurrying around the hall were the technical staff setting up the light, sound and camera equipment that would turn this day into a spectacle. The three levels of seating towered over the court, awaiting the arrival of the spectators that will fill the vast cavern with a charged atmosphere akin to that of an electrical storm. It was a fascinating insight into the behind the scenes processes that go into setting up and event like this.\n\nIn the stands the early DOS ’46 supporters began adding the club banners to those of the other clubs that already adorned various sections of the stadium. The red and black ‘Eendracht Maakt Macht’ (Unity is Strength) proudly hung where the DOS supporters were to be seated behind the player’s bench. The lads kindly added a couple of New Zealand flags into the mix to make a statement about the kiwi presence in Ahoy today. Koru and I made our way out the centre of the court for a few token photo opportunities as who knows when a kiwi will next be able to return to this court. I feel incredibly lucky and grateful for the team of DOS ’46 A1 letting me tag along as part of this amazing day.\n\nWith our sights calibrated towards victory, the team stepped outside to soak up some sunshine, fuel up for the game with lunch and just to generally relax the minds ahead of combat.\n\nThe faces of the players began to steel in final preparations for the push for revenge from last years loss to the same team in the final. The red and black army of DOS supporters began to swell as the other buses arrived from Nijeveen, and while the supporters were lesser in number than those from PKC, the volume of support from the Dossers was certainly superior.\n\nThe lights dimmed in the stadium, supporters rose to their feet and one by one the players were introduced as they ran out on to the Ahoy court. Formalities and high fives over, it was game time.\n\nIt was a rather inauspicious start for the team from Nijeveen, giving away a free pass immediately that was dually converted. The deficit was quickly turned into an advantage with two quick goals from DOS but PKC were able to square the ledger at 2-2 after seven minutes. This was the last time in the game that PKC stood level with DOS ’46 as from here the red and blacks boys really started to dominate the game and the rebound at both ends of the court. DOS ’46 created many multiple shot attacks while PKC were regularly limited to a single scoring attempt before a DOS player pocketed a defensive rebound. For the next 15 minutes goals were hard to come by but DOS, on the back of some good distance shots, built a five goal lead at 3-8. Could DOS hold strong for the rest of the first half? It seemed so when every time PKC scored, DOS would quickly reply and maintain their led until in the final few minutes before half time, just as Fortuna did last week, PKC closed the gap to 9-12 at half time.\n\nFollowing the break PKC continued their momentum, scoring two goals in the first minute to bring them one goal behind DOS ’46 and add some pressure to the Nijeveen youngsters. The next 10 minutes belonged to the dames from DOS. Throughout the game they had more than matched the stronger female players from PKC and six goals shared between the four DOS ’46 females, including three for Denice De Vries, restored DOS’s five goal advantage from earlier in the match. Harjan Visscher’s goal then countered a one from PKC before Femke Van Zwol extended DOS’s lead to six with less than 14 minutes to play. Only a disaster from here would prevent DOS ’46 from claiming victory. As time ticked away, so did the chances for PKC. DOS continued to control the game with strength around the post and with seven minutes to play, the lead had been extended to seven goals, 15-22. Sven Van Erp substituted in for Jetze De Jong for some highly deserved minutes on the floor in Ahoy after being one of the core players for the team all season. The celebrations had already begun in the stands and on the side of the court by the time PKC scored a couple of consolation goals to narrow the final score to 20-25. At the final whistle, the bench emptied and swamped the players on court in celebrations of wild jumping and hugging, including the kiwis somewhere in the chaos!\n\nAs the ecstasy gradually subsided and the deep satisfaction of what the team had achieved set in, it was time to head to the stage for the medal presentation. With each team member draped in a gold medal, on of which will be returning to New Zealand, captain Lisanne Koster hoisted the trophy to the rapturous applause of the crowd and more celebratory chants from the DOS supporters.\n\nAfter a rollercoaster year for the club this was an important result that continues to bode well for the future of DOS ’46 from the tiny village of Nijeveen. Last time the club claimed the junior title was in 2002. Three years later began the golden years of DOS ’46, claiming three senior national titles from five consecutive Ahoy finals. The future continues to shine bright for DOS ’46. The club has the brains, the talent and the work ethic to return to the Korfball League in the very near future and become a title competitor once again.\n\nThe rest of the day in Ahoy celebrating for the DOS ’46 family and enjoying the other two games on offer today, the playoff for third and the final of the Korfball League. By the time the final started, the stands were almost full, somewhere in the vicinity of 9000 spectators. TOP, who had been unbeaten all season, were up against the defending champions PKC. Somehow I managed to be sitting next to the Dutch national hockey coach with the Dutch national Korfball coach next to him. As is common for finals, while still amazing to watch, the quality of the game itself was not as high as many of the regular season games. While the arm wrestle took place on court, there was also another battle happening in the stands with both groups of supporters having a brass band trumpeting away. It was a tough game that TOP controlled from the outset until PKC clawed their way back late in the game at 20-20 with the final minute ticking away, it looked like extra time would be on the cards. Last year PKC won with a goal in the final minute, this time it was the turn of TOP as male player of the match Daniel Harmzen scored to secure the title and an unbeaten season for the team from Sassenheim.\n\nFor this kiwi having his first Ahoy experience, this will certain qualify as one of lifes unforgettable days. I will forever be in the debt of DOS ’46 and the team of A1 for providing such an incredible experience. To not only watch the Ahoy finals but to stand on the court and then receive a gold medal on the podium is a unique privilege that is reserved for only a lucky few in the sport each year! I especially enjoyed the lads with their “Bevan in Ahoy” chants and a feel lucky to have been associated with such a great club during my time in the Netherlands.\n\nWith a little over a month left before returning to NZ, the junior world cup in next on the agenda as well as enjoying the last of my Dutch Korfball experience.\n\nIf you want to watch the full game from Ahoy, check it out on the IKF channel on YouTube via the link below:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uJ74i0avwbA&list=UUtbxyW3dL8S9MM2RHWVCjqg\n\nTot Volgende Keer,\n\nLorenzo\n\nI know it’s been too long since my last post for you all but I certainly have some very exciting events to write about now!\n\nWhile the hall season wrapped up for the senior teams of DOS in early March, DOS ’46 A1 continued their march towards their goal of returning to the national final in Ahoy. The team finished second to DSC in their Junior Hoodklasse pool to set up a best of three cross-finals series against Fortuna A1 from Delft. In the other semi-final series, DSC were to take on last years national junior champions PKC who beat DOS ’46 in the final from 2013.\n\nWith the timing of my birthday adventure to London and Dublin, which I won’t bore, you with the details of, except to say it was exceptional!! This meant I was in Dublin during the first playoff game between DOS ’46 and Fortuna in Nijeveen. Thanks to the wonders and modern technology, the great people at DOS ’46 had set up a live stream through YouTube that meant I was able to catch the game from Dublin. What I watched through the computer screen was one the most extraordinary games of junior korfball ever played! There was a huge and vocal home crowd in for the game but that was countered by a decent number of supporters who had made the two-hour journey from Delft. Throughout the game very little separated the teams with a back and forth of spectacular goals and both teams been punished from the free pass/penalty spot for any defensive infringements. On the back of some penalties from the visitors Fortuna opened up a four-goal 23-27 lead in the second half. The parochial home crowd rallied behind the home team who, spurred on by some deadly shooting from Harjan Visscher and Femke Van Zwol managed to level the game up at 27-27, and draw in front 29-28 with only minutes left. Fortuna struck back and leveled the score at 30-30, an amazing 60 goals in 60 minutes of Korfball, sending the game into overtime. Normally only one five minute period of extra time should have been played to find a winner but the referee played five minutes each way. This didn’t matter as DOS ’46 and Harjan Visscher, who is an incredible talent having only just turned 17 and in his first year with the club, were completely dominant going ahead by six goals. The Fortuna fight back came too late and DOS ’46 had the best possible start to their finals series with a 40-38 win, 78 goals in 70 minutes, 13 of them for Harjan, wow!\n\nBack in Nijeveen I was able to join back up with the team to prepare for the return match in Delft. March 22 was a big korfball day on the DOS ’46 junior calendar with A1 playing in Delft, with B1 and C1 playing in their respective National Championship finals days. All DOS ‘46 eyes were on Twitter to track the progress of the teams at their various locations. My mission was to help with DOS ’46 A1 and by the time we arrived in Delft, Twitter had told us that B1 and C1 had finished 6th and 7th in their respective tournaments. While we were preparing for the game, the supporters from DOS slowly starting streaming in, including the players from B1, setting up a vocal support group in one corner of Fortuna’s hall. The team appeared tense before the game and while the game was not up to the out of this world standard from the week before, both teams started solidly and traded goals through the majority of the first half. The minutes around half time can often be the most telling in a match. So it was to be with Fortuna scoring three quick goals before half time, giving them an important buffer at the break. During the second half DOS ’46 keeping chipping away at the lead of their opponents but each step closer was countered effectively by Fortuna who were able to control the ball for long periods in their attacking end. Those three goals just before half time for Fortuna, proved to be the difference in the end, the home side winning 26-23, forcing a winner-takes-all match the following week back in Delft.\n\nAlso today, PKC claimed their spot in the Ahoy junior final, beating DSC in both contests. Could DOS ’46 set up a rematch of last years final by winning in Delft?\n\nDue to regular coaches Jan Weigers and Haralt Lucas being unavailable this week, the Hulzebosch brothers Roger and Daniel took the reins of the team. On match day, the team bus departing Nijeveen was quickly filled to capacity with supporters, while others made their own way to Delft. There was a different mood in the team today; everyone feeling more relaxed after having learned from their experience in Delft the previous week. The DOS ’46 supporters, while entirely outnumbered at Fortuna Hall, certainly made their presence known with some vocal chanting and drumming on the sponsor’s hoardings. A focused DOS ’46 came out and stunned the home team in the first 10 minutes, opening up a five-goal lead and maintaining the margin for much of the first half. Controlled defence was the key for DOS ’46 in the first half where errors were minimized and Fortuna kept on coming back at DOS ’46 and in those crucial minutes before half time, managed to reduce the difference to 12-15 at half time. The second half was a tense battle with defensive errors from DOS ’46 being punished as Fortuna converted their easy chances, closing within one goal on multiple occasions. Despite being less fluent in attack, DOS ’46 maintained a grasp in their lead every time Fortuna threatened. The supporters and most certainly all of us sitting on the bench were riding the emotional waves of the game with every play, pass and turnover. I’m sure if someone had a camera focused on us at any point there would have been some great expressions of every possible emotion. With the score at 20-21 a smart play called by the coaches on a free pass allowed Iris Hulzebosch to score the most crucial goal of the match and to double the lead to 20-22. As the final minutes ticked by the noise levels and emotion in the hall were electric. With the score at 23-24, Fortuna missed a couple of opportunities to equalize. DOS ’46 received the ball in attack with about 40 seconds left on the clock. After managing to reset the shot clock once, all that was left to do was to use up the last 15 seconds safely. The supporters and the bench stormed the players on court at the sounding of the final whistle with celebrations appropriately loud and mental, with copious amounts of jumping! Much deserved celebrations and backslapping ensued in what was a very poignant moment for reminding everyone about the strength of DOS ’46. Various chants spontaneously erupted, mostly involving the word Ahoy, which is the location of the national final every year and where we will be next week! How lucky am I??!! This crazy kiwi that gets to tag along and be on the bench with the team as they aim to take revenge from last years loss to PKC. If your there, keep an eye out for the kiwi flag!\n\nWhatever the result next week, the season for DOS ’46 A1 has definitely been a great success and shining light for the future of the club. Certainly it will be an even bigger success if they manage to repeat the victory in the final from 2002. Maybe there is a great club precedent for our success next week. In 2005 DOS ’46 1 lost their first final in Ahoy for some years, only to go out and completely dominate the final the following year! Can DOS ’46 A1 follow the lead of that piece of history to create history of their own!\n\nI look forward writing my next story after the experience of the final in Ahoy, hopefully a championship winning experience!\n\nYou can check out the videos from the game in Nijeveen and the last seconds and celebrations from Delft on the link below:\n\nhttp://update.dos46.nl/?page_id=110#prettyPhoto\n\nTot Volgende Week\n\nLorenzo\n\nThe countdown is on………83 days till my departure to NZ. 83 days to soak up as much korfball knowledge and as much European atmosphere as I can. Interestingly enough, during this week my time in the Netherlands passed 200 days as well!\n\nThis week I absorbed the korfball and atmosphere in Groningen. This began by joining the students at Parabol for training on Monday evening. Full of laughs and fun, it was nice to meet another group of korfball players and let them all refresh their English speaking skills. I appreciate the club inviting this nomadic korfball kiwi into their mix. No doubt leaving more people with the impression I’m a little nuts coming all the way to the other side of the world to experience korfball. We also took the time to head along and watch Nic play KZ in the Korfball League. Nic, a long-time nemesis of DOS ’46, have had a tough year in the Korfball League and the game against KZ was no different. After a quiet first half where the score was 8-9 at the break, KZ’s goal scoring ability was unleashed in the second half against the obviously weaker team from Groningen. KZ scored 20 doelpunten (goals), looking at one stage like they would end up with double the score of the home team. In front of the sparse crowd that typifies a struggling team, Nic continued to fight to no avail, losing 17-29.\n\nIn between the korfball was checking out Groningen. The city reminded me of Dunedin in NZ where I grew up and studied. There was a great vibe in the university-dominated city with a strong café culture and social atmosphere. I joined a number of locals in the bar watching the Dutch success in the speed skating at the Winter Olympics, races which seemed to have much of the population glued to a TV set. For the tourist in Groningen there are not so many historical sights to see, the Martinitoren (Martini Tower) being the main attraction, but there are certainly plenty of other attractive views as you walk around the city.\n\nBack to Nijeveen, and after putting a dislocated finger back in at training on Friday evening, it was another home game weekend for the senior DOS ’46 teams while A1 was playing away in a top of the table clash against DSC. DOS 3 are searching for points to stay in the Reserve Hoofdklasse but some outstanding shooting from their opposition gave them little chance of succeeding in that search today. Avanti scored a massive 20 doelpunten in the first half to lead 12-20 at the break. Their scoring did not slow down in the second half either having a convincing 22-36 win over the home side. With three games left and one point behind in the fight to avoid relegation, DOS 3 must find some points soon.\n\nDOS ’46 2 were up against club rivals Nic 3. While both teams are sitting comfortably in the Reserve Hoofdklasse, this is always a match with much feeling and intensity. After DOS building an early lead, Nic fought back, leveling the scores and then building a four-goal lead of their own. In a seesaw game, DOS then managed to establish their own four-goal lead in the second half, only to see it disappear with another Nic fight back leaving the scores tied 16-16. Tight defence from both sides dominated the final stages of the match. With scores tied at 20-20, DOS ’46 scored the decisive goal and held on with more strong defence for a 21-20 win.\n\nDOS ’46 1 was out for revenge against KVA, whom they surprisingly lost to in the reverse game last year. While not being as technically skilled, KVA are fighters and built an early four-goal lead. After this the defence from the home team began to dominate and technical superiority in the attack allowed a lead to slowly build for DOS ’46. This attacking skill was proven by the goals being shared around, five players scoring five or more doelpunten with brothers Sven and Jelmer Jonker topping the score sheet with six each. Final score 31-21. Unfortunately the last mathematical chance to make the playoffs disappeared as SKF, whom DOS ’46 defeated last week, won their match to be five points ahead with only two games left.\n\nDOS A1 also suffered disappointed, being defeated in their top of the table clash 22-20. This means they must win against KCC next week to secure their spot in the semi-finals.\n\nTo top the week off, today was also the final DOS KIDs for this round. The feedback on the programme has been glowing. It would be great if we could set up something similar in NZ to help develop younger players in the sport!\n\nNext week it is off to Belgium to infiltrate the korfball community there for a week and no doubt sample some Belgian cuisine and beer!\n\nIk vond het wel lekker gaan eigenlijk!\n\nLorenzo\n\nThanks to all of those people who read and shared my last blog post! Your comments and positive reactions have been a further sign of the strength and passion you all have for DOS ’46.\n\nThe Winter Olympics has started. I have been glued to the TV watching amazing physical feats with champions being crowned and athletes achieving their own personal goals. If you haven’t seen the video of the Indian luger who fell off his sled and miraculously flipped back on it while still sliding down the track, you have to check it out! For anyone lacking motivation in their own sport, there is endless inspiration from the athletes’ strengths being broadcast from Sochi right now.\n\nThis weekend DOS ’46 went head to head with SKF. It was the turn of DOS 1, 2 and A1 to travel to Veenendaal with all team expecting tough matches from strong opposition. Despite SKF A1 being at the bottom of the pool they are known as a tough team who keep on fighting, meaning the game is never won until the final whistle. Despite the technical superiority of DOS A1, we were never able to create a convincing lead over the home side. Anytime a small lead was built, SKF would fight back to always keep the pressure on. Eventually the class and strength of the team from DOS shone through with some important shots and clinical penalty conversion towards the end of the game, winning 16-18, and scoring the first two points of the day for DOS ’46. This also means DOS A1 continue to challenge for top spot in the pool which will be important come time for the cross over matches.\n\nWith some changes to the line ups from the first and second teams, today would be a good test for the A-selection from DOS ’46. Both teams facing opponents who were placed two positions higher in the current standings of the pools. Could DOS ’46 rebound from a tough start to the year and show the strength the club is renowned for? Early on in the game between the second teams it became clear the changes to the line-ups were having a positive impact. As the first half wore on DOS 2 were able to gradually build a lead, much to the frustration of their more favoured opponents. DOS 2 would never let their guard down, not giving SKF a chance to force their way back into the match, eventually winning 19-24, scoring another two points for the Nijeveeneers. By this time the members of DOS 3 had also joined the supporters of DOS after their match had to be postponed because the shot clock wouldn’t work. Two hours is a long way to drive to not play a game due to a technical malfunction!\n\nThe vocal DOS supporters helped to spur on DOS 1. Neither team was able to create a lead through the first half but early in the second half the Dossers began showing some ascendancy, building a six goal lead with 15 minutes left in the game. At 19-25, DOS was looking a good chance to break their winless streak but sometimes when a team is struggling, knowing just how to win can be difficult. SKF came storming back and the game was tied at 26-26 when Marcel Koelma was substituted in. With 90 seconds left on the clock Marcel scored the game winner from distance and the final whistle then brought about some relieved celebrations for the DOS ’46 selection. The game was one heck of an arm wrestle but to fight hard and prove the strength in the DOS ’46 name once again was immensely satisfying for everyone involved. DOS ’46 = 6 points, SKF = 0 points!\n\nI joined a happy team on the bus back to Nijeveen, everyone celebrating with a few beers and some spontaneous karaoke. The success of the weekend will no doubt provide great inspiration for the last games of the hall season ahead.\n\nSunday provided another chance to watch DOS KIDs and continue to learn more about training young korfball players. Then on Sunday afternoon I traveled with the DOS ’46 business club to LDODK to watch their Korfball League match against the winless Nic. Despite both teams being in the lower part of the Korfball League, the skill of the players was still incredible to watch, especially the Zwart brothers from LDODK. They once again proved their value to the club, scoring the majority of the goals for the home team in a 26-22 win over their opposition, leaving Nic at risk of being the first team to not score any points during a Korfball League season.\n\nNow I’m off on a mini-break to the northern Dutch city of Groningen, staying with some former DOS ’46 players who now are the trainers at Parabol.\n\nTot Volgende Week\n\nLorenzo\n\nWith international games being played over the weekend, most of the top korfball enjoyed a rest week before the final charge towards the end of the hall season. For the record the Dutch won their games at each age level by reasonably comfortable margins. The unusually warm weather here has also been strange with many of the locals lamenting that there is no natural ice to skate on yet and the arrival of such ice not even looking likely! Instead we will just have to be content with watching the snow and ice from the Winter Olympics.\n\nThis week I thought I would reflect on club that has taken this kiwi korfball orphan in and, despite the challenges the club faces, what makes it so special.\n\nDOS ’46 has created a proud history for itself in becoming one of the most successful clubs in Dutch korfball history. DOS ’46 have won a numbers of titles at junior level, both indoor and outdoor, and become national champions in 1982, 2006, 2007 and 2009 in the senior hall competition and European Champions in 1982, 2007, 2008 and 2010. This is a very impressive record for a club from the village of Nijeveen, which boosts less than 4000 residents.\n\nToday, DOS ’46 faces a number of challenges to return to those golden years. The club is in search of a new head trainer for next season with the retirement of Herman Van Gunst. Recently the club chairman resigned and the first team have missed out on the playoffs for promotion back to the Korfball League. Also my fourth team was withdrawn from the competition, leaving DOS ’46 with only four senior teams (the fifth team still plays on Sundays). It would be easy to get hung up on these challenges and concerned for the clubs future success. Here is the perspective of an outsider turned insider, kiwi turned Dosser, on what makes this club great and why it will become Dutch champion once again.\n\nThe Youth\n\nDOS ’46 has an established reputation for success that continues to draw top players to the club for all around the northern part of the Netherlands. Not only that, DOS ’46 has an incredible youth development programme. Starting with DOS KIDs, the newly established korfball institute for youth that runs extra training for younger players, drawing on the incredible knowledge base in the club established from the last 30 years of success. Not only do the youth players benefit from the clubs internal korfball knowledge, guest trainers are regularly used to run the sessions including current and former top players as well as current Korfball League coaches. But DOS ’46 is not running this just for the benefit of themselves; the current DOS KIDs programme is for youth from other clubs, many of whom travel up to an hour to attend the Sunday morning sessions. During these sessions the DOS banner hangs proudly on the wall stating ‘Eendracht Maakt Macht’ (the English translation of the meaning is ‘Unity Is Strength’), through creating unity with other clubs DOS ’46 continues to grow its own strength as well.\n\nDOS ’46 also continues to be one of the most successful clubs at junior level in the Netherlands. This year is a perfect illustration of that with A1, B1 and C1 all currently in the top few teams in their respective competitions. Over the weekend I watched DOS ’46 C1 comfortably beat their counterparts from Dalto (a Korfball League club) and in doing so, they secured a place at the national finals day on March 22. This team includes some second generation Dossers, children of some of DOS ‘46’s past top players and honestly, it is ridiculous watching the incredible talent of these young korfball players.\n\nThe other team I have been most closely associated with is A1, full of talent, including two current Dutch U19 players. This team is also consistently at the top of the country, most recently winning the 2011/12 field competition and last year was a losing finalist in Ahoy for the hall competition. This year DOS ’46 A1 are again looking dangerous and should easily qualify for the semi-final cross over matches. The teams in the other pool will be nervous about coming up against this team, determined to return for another taste of the final in Ahoy.\n\nWhile we are talking about the younger players it should be noted that most of the players in the A-selection are also very young, many aged 19-24, and some of them fresh from competing in that A1 Ahoy final last year. Three of the selection play for Jong Oranje (the junior national side). With more experience and hard work over the next years, this young squad has the potential to be transformed into a top Dutch side.\n\nWith such incredible young talent at the club and no doubt more arriving every season, the future of the club while continue to shine.\n\nThe Knowledge\n\nEven though the current head coach is retiring, DOS ’46 is stacked with brains that are exploding with korfball knowledge and understanding. From the statesman Albert Lucas who was captain of that 1982 championship team to names like Nico Buiten, Roger Hulzebosch and Daniel Hulzebosch, all former first team captains who have turned their hands to coaching to share their deep knowledge and understanding of what makes a great team. Let’s not forget the connections that these men and many others at the club have to a much wider net of knowledge from all over the korfball world. You could focus on the fact that the club is not in the Korfball League at the moment or you could marvel at the achievement of having DOS 1, 2 and three all competing in the Hoofdklasse, pretty impressive considering the small number of senior teams presently in the club.\n\nWith the knowledge base that exists at DOS ’46, there will never be a shortage of smart brains to help guide the club past any challenge.\n\nThe People\n\nAll too often in sport we get focused on the elite; those players and teams who stand out, get the publicity and attention. The people that are the real lifeblood of a sport and a club are those who make up the majority, those who may never play top sport but love playing their sport, those who may not play at all but have passion for their club and help in other ways. In earlier posts you might remember me talking about the great DOS family and this club is definitely like one big family, now with a annoying little brother that means everyone speaks a bit more English than they used to!\n\nDOS ’46 took a couple of kiwi korfballers in this season to help us improve our skills and knowledge, returning to New Zealand to grow the sport back home. DOS ’46 had no idea if it would work out well or be a complete disaster, we were the first foreigners at the club. But they were prepared to take a chance and to try something new. Every step of the way the club, and more specifically the people in the club, have made every effort to make us feel welcome and to provide as many opportunities as possible to gain more korfball experience. Thanks to Roger and Wim Heite I was physio with the Noord U19 team and went to the Korfball Challenge. DOS 3 is constantly inviting me on their road trips away now I don’t have games to play myself. I have been invited to watch Korfball League games and helped as physio for A1. Let’s remember, none if this is easy because although my understanding of Dutch continues to improve, English is still an easier way to communicate which makes it tough on the locals. Despite that challenge they still do it with a smile.\n\nAnother perfect example of the DOS ’46 family is clubroom at either the field or the sport hall. Just over the weekend it took me well over an hour to leave as every time I went to leave someone else wanted to have a chat. This included even walking outside and being about to leave on my bike before being talked into coming back inside for another coffee by Martijn, the trainer of DOS 3! There is such a unique social and supportive atmosphere created at the clubroom that if you let it infect you it is very difficult to escape. Chances are when you do leave; it’ll be with a smile on your face.\n\nI know I’m not the only one that has been infected by the richness of the culture at DOS ’46. There are a number of people involved at the club who grew up and worked in different areas all over the Netherlands, eventually being coerced into coming to DOS ’46 as a coach or a player. The thing is, that because of the positively infectious environment here, many of those people never leave. After traveling to and from Nijeveen, they eventually move here, buying houses and having families that are now becoming the next generation of DOS ’46 korfball players. Talking to a number of people around the club, this story repeats itself again and again!\n\nThen there are unsung heroes; those that week in week out put their hearts into the club to help it continue to pulsate. These are the committee members, the canteen workers, the parents, the business club, the people who run the website, twitter and facebook accounts just to name a few. The DOS ’46 twitter account has one of the largest followings from any club in the Netherlands! The passion these people have for the club is what continues to make the club great through any challenge, no matter how difficult. During the weekend just passed, there was the DOS Dolle Driegangen Diner. A progressive dinner where you share either an entrée, main or desert with two other couples, moving on to the next course at another location but not knowing who you would enjoy that course with until you arrived there. Apart from the odd hangover the next day, all everyone was talking about was how great the evening was, how much they enjoyed the food and how much fun they had.\n\nYes, there are some challenges ahead for DOS ’46, challenges that I see as being very similar to the ones we are trying to work through with korfball in New Zealand. It is easy to focus on those challenges rather than looking at what makes the club special. It is those special qualities above that will provide DOS ’46 with the platform for its return to the top.\n\nDOS ’46 started as a little third class club. With hard work, perseverance and a little patience, they became the best korfball players in the world. Success will return to DOS ’46. With the passion, the work ethic and following the club motto, the golden years will come again.\n\nEendracht Maakt Macht – Unity Is Strength\n\nTot Ziens,\n\nLorenzo\n\nApologies to those who look forward to my weekly updates about korfball life in the Netherlands for my tardiness in posting another update. It has been a couple of weeks since you have heard from me and a lot has happened in that time.\n\nA quick aside for those of you who don’t understand the structure of the Dutch Korfball competition:\n\nEssentially there are two different competition ladders – one for first teams and one for reserve teams (any other team apart from your clubs top side). For first teams the best ten teams will compete in the Korfball League; the next 16 teams in the Hoofdklasse; next is the Overgangklasse followed by 1st, 2nd 3rd, 4th klasse etc. Exactly the same structure sits alongside for the reserve teams with the reserve teams of the Korfball League clubs automatically competing in the Reserve Korfball league. Then the best reserve teams will compete in Reserve Hoofdklasse, followed by Reserve Overgangklasse etc. First teams are promoted/relegated between divisions from the first ladder while reserve teams are promoted/relegated between divisions in the second ladder. There is no cross over where first teams play against reserve teams. Hope that makes sense!\n\nThe Good\n\nCommunicating with the NZ korfball family is becoming a more integral part of my journey now as we work towards the 2014 AOKC. Thanks to the interweb this task is made much easier, a bonus for me although some of the players back home might find my messages and prompts a bit tiresome. Recently we had a great catch up with the members of the NZ team to create a new level of focus and drive for 2014, coming up with a number of initiatives and areas to train (both on and off court) for our korfball development this year. I continue to be more and more excited about the group we have and their potential to surprise a few people in Hong Kong.\n\nHere at DOS ’46 I traveled with the third team to Eindhoven for their away game against RustRoest 2. Following a big win last week, DOS 3 were feeling confidant that they could come away from Eindhoven with two points and create some breathing space between them and the bottom teams in the Reserve Hoofdklasse. DOS 3 stayed in control through the first half, building a lead that fluctuated between three and four goals for most of the first half. RustRoest leveled the scores early in the second half with a three goal run and took the lead for the first time. After some back and forth where no team was able to build ultimate control of the game, the scores were locked at 16-16 with about 10 minutes remaining. DOS 3 finished the stronger of the two teams, scoring five unanswered goals to complete a 16-21 win and secure their second win in a row!\n\nI was also given the chance to have a run with DOS 5, which consists of a number of very experienced former first team players. It was great fun to play with this group, having a run on court in the second half. Although my shooting was atrocious, some of the others were more accurate and we had a 13-19 win over Leeuwarden 2.\n\nThe junior teams at DOS ’46 also continue to shine with A1, B1 and C1 all in the top three teams of their pools with A1 looking good to secure a semi-final spot and have a shot at competing in the final in Ahoy for the second year running.\n\nFurthermore, I have been able to watch DOS KIDs (mentioned in my last post) and learn more about coaching korfball at a junior level, which will help develop the juniors starting to play korfball back in NZ.\n\nThe Bad\n\nDOS 4 had a loss to fellow cellar-dweller in the reserve first class Oost-Arnhem, leaving the team winless for the hall season so far and still struggling to find enough females to play due to the injury situation at DOS ’46. Our game over the weekend had to be canned for this exact issue as we were unable to get enough players together to play away for the third time this season, prompting a message from the KNKV that will be reported in ‘The Jammer’.\n\nDOS 1 also continued their tough start to the year. A home draw against Wageningen followed by an away loss to Groen Geel has left them with little chance of making the top two in their Hoofdklasse pool for the crossover games and a chance to be promoted to the Korfball League. I know this will be disappointing for a team that started the season with high hopes of returning to the Dutch korfball elite. It has been a tough hall season for the club in general and one that no doubt will provide many valuable lessons for the coming years so that dream of returning to the Korfball League is realised soon.\n\nThe Jammer\n\nFrom what I eluded to above, DOS 4 was given an ultimatum by the KNKV. Either make sure you have a team to play in every game left, including the three games missed already, or pull the team out of the competition. There was a meeting between the team and members of the DOS ’46 committee to discuss what the decision would be. I have to admit while I was still bemused and confused during good portions of the meeting I was surprised how much I could actually understand. In my brain, Dutch now makes sense as a language, even if it is full of words I don’t know the meanings to. In the end there was only one possible conclusion for DOS 4, which was to withdraw the team from the competition.\n\nNow without my own team to play for, along with the other members of DOS 4 we will be filling in for other teams when required. DOS ’46 will do as much as they can to give us any opportunity possible over the coming weeks. This also means I must continue to work harder to develop my korfball knowledge as much as possible with the time I have left here. I have also managed to organise a trip to Belgium to catch up with my former New Zealand coach Daniel De Rudder, be a tourist (i.e. sample Belgian beer, chocolate and history) and also enjoy some of the Korfball in Belgium as well\n\nTot ziens,\n\nLorenzo\n\nPS - it's getting a bit colder here but keep in mind there are many record temperatures as well. One day recently a couple of weeks ago was 10 degrees C, a mere 28 degrees higher than the -18 degrees on the same day last year!\n\nIt’s been a while since I have written a match report for you all with the New Year holiday taking place. Also I snuck away to Maastricht for a few days and that is why this report is a few days overdue!\n\n2014 has brought about a renewed focus on the purpose of this Odyssey to the Netherlands. As a result the start of the year has been as I am to continue, korfball focused. As I write this, the Europa Cup is taking place in Papendrecht with the top club teams from all over Europe competing against each other. It is this kind of regular external competition that we miss in New Zealand, being so isolated from the rest of the korfball world. Fortunately we can all enjoy the live stream of the Europa Cup on the Internet.\n\nIt is now only eight months until our New Zealand team heads to Hong Kong in a bid to qualify for the 2015 World Championships. This also gives me less than four months left here in the Netherlands to soak up as much korfball knowledge as I can before returning to join my teammates. I will try to experience as much korfball as I can through training, playing, watching and studying korfball. Also on the agenda is planning how we can grow the sport in New Zealand through developing coaches, referees and increasing our player base, particularly with school age children.\n\nUnfortunately the injury situation at DOS ’46 has not really improved over the holiday break, leaving teams scraping for players for each game. It was a win itself for our fourth team to even have enough players to head to Dronten for our game against ASVD 2. However, that was where to good news ended for our team. We had hoped that we could be competitive against our opposition but it quickly became apparent that the lack of training and cohesion for DOS ’46 4 had taking its toll on the team. I started from the bench and it was certainly not an enjoyable game to watch as ASVD found the going all too easy. Defensive errors resulting in easy shots or penalties hurt our team throughout the duration of the game. ASVD 2 we also shooting well from medium distance, taking full advantage of the opportunities they were able to create. At the other end of the court someone must have covered our korf in glass that we just couldn’t break. The shots were just not dropping and as a result, ASVD were able to force us into lower percentage shots that limited our ability to control the ball for longer durations. During the second half there was no change to the flow of the game. I came on a few minutes into the second half and managed to score a couple of distance shots. The game sank to another low when Niek was given a second yellow card resulting in a red card for mouthing off at the referee too much. That made life pretty impossible for our vak trying to continue to play with three people. In the end the final score was a rather dismal 25-8.\n\nFor the rest of the senior teams at DOS ’46 the start to the new year was not a successful one either. DOS ’46 3 losing to DeetosSnel 2 25-16; DOS ’46 2 also losing to SCO 2 18-16; DOS ’46 1 having an 18-18 draw at SCO 1. Both of the results at SCO were a bit of a surprise considering in the first round DOS ’46 won both these games by over 10 goals. The juniors at DOS are shining the way at the moment with A1, B1 and C1 and winning and keeping themselves among the top teams in the country for their age groups.\n\nThe korfball immersion continued on Sunday with the first KIDs (Korfball Institute DOS ’46) session for the year. This is a coaching programme for junior players every Sunday for six weeks where each week they get taught more in depth skills about an area of korfball, often from a guest coach. The younger children learned how to hone their basic skills in passing and shooting while the older children were taught how to attack against a defender by Gerald Aukes, the head coach at korfball league club KZ/Hiltex. I plan on also going along and watching these session every week to take some more ideas back to New Zealand that we can use to develop our young korfball players skills.\n\nAnother korfball bonus for the weekend was attending the Korfball League game at LDODK on Sunday. With 950 spectators the atmosphere for the game was pretty electric, especially with a vocal home crowd supporting their team. As the home side quickly ran out to a 7-0 lead over their opponents KZ/Hiltex, it was obvious that the level of play in the Korfball League was quite a step up from that in the Hoofdklasse. While KZ boasted a couple of Dutch internationals in their ranks it was the brothers Zwart from LDODK that dominated the game. Erwin and Andre scored all those seven goals mentioned above. At the end of the game they both had reached double figures for the game. Despite a late charge from KZ they were never able to make up the ground they lost at the start of the game, 30-25 the final score.\n\nAs the countdown towards Hong Kong continues, it will take a lot of hard work to put us in the best position to secure a place at the world championships. Let’s hope with a bit of hard work the fortunes at DOS ’46 also improve quickly.\n\nTot Ziens,\n\nLorenzo"
