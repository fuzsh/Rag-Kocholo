        "text": "tl;dr New hate speeches in videoclips and again in word by Robbert van den Broeke prove that he was an/the most important hate mailer all along and there is no hacker who hacked all his accounts, Social Media included. What’s really going on as far as Joran van der Sloot-Stan-Robbert are concerned remains unclear. Furthermore with Stan’s help, Robbert is busy getting a foothold in America.\n\nRun-up\n\nThe final paragraph of my previous blog of August 12, 2017 indicates what an important part of that blog was about: the Robbert van den Broeke link, via Stan, to Joran van der Sloot / Natalee Holloway. Coincidentally, exactly one week later, on August 19, 2017, a high-profile crime documentary about Natalee Holloway would air:\n\n…\n\nBut Stan was not addressed in this umpteenth Natalee Holloway disillusion. It turned out to be about another former pal of Joran van der Sloot: the now stabbed-to-death John Ludwick (ultra-insider Gabriel Madrigal incidentally has indications that the wrong person has been appointed for the stabbing, and acquitted because of “self-defense”).\n\nA year has passed: August 2018. What has happened?\n\nThe publication of the Hanger blog was not received with cheers by Robbert, Stan and associates. In the immediate weeks following the publication of the blog, I received very hostile, vulgar mail of old acquaintances and new busybodies from the inner circle of Robbert van den Broeke.1 First Stan took off in many audios to come, pulling the trump card that he would slam me with a lawyer, demanding that I remove all my Robbert van den Broeke blogs, until I decided in mid-September 2017 to remove all surnames. Only Robbert van den Broekes surname, as a public figure, I kept intact. I then received two “thank you emails” from Stan.\n\nRobbert\n\nOn August 25, 2017, Robbert checks in by email, whining about all my (> Constantia’s skeptical) work being in vain. On 12 September 2017, Robbert van den Broeke checks in again, hatred becoming visible again. His hatred will be culminating in the following months, and erupting like a volcano in December 2017, becoming extremely visible and undeniable , for the first time really in live images and sound. Anybody who has seen his recent video clips directed at me (and others), would find it impossible to deny that he was the (or: a) hate mailer all along, and that there never was a hacker in the sense that Robbert van den Broeke did not participate passionately. However: due to new hate mail received via other accounts than that of Robbert, it has become even clearer that a club around Stan must have been active as well.1\n\nImportant sideline in his recent videos is his glorification of America where, according to Robbert, he is going to be very big and famous. To cite a couple of Robbert’s phrases: “Reconstruction in America”, “Those people are intelligent”, “Sexy American media”. In his clips Robbert turns against the Netherlands, which in his view is only a small, insignificant country, that now ignores him in terms of media attention. But it turns out to be secretly bothering him, because on November 14, 2017 I receive an email in which Robbert wants to know if the Dutch media are conspiring against him and who told me that he was boycotted since all his * ahem * downward spiral movements. A Dutch media insider had indeed said that to me and I had referred to it briefly on Twitter without mentioning a name.\n\nIn December 2017, Robbert shows his depression medication in a video clip and says that Skepsis and I are partly responsible for his terrible life. Both his videos and email messages from December 2017 use exactly the same language (and some dirty pictures) as the hate mails I received from Robberts “hacker”. I have put all the concrete material (links to a selection of clips and numerous screenshots) in the footnotes. I posted the video clip on Twitter and Stan no longer repeated the hacker story. He c-alled Robbert’s behavior “problem behavior” or said that he did not approve that side of Robbert, but that was it.\n\nNSFW, by way of illustration I give you phrases from the new hate mails and clips of Robbert: “Fuck you, wind, fart in your face, with your face in the shit, stupid box, twat, Rob Nanninga is a bastard, shut the f up! , bitch, God love me (Robbert, this should be “God loves me”, the way you say it means that you ask God to love you), stupid dumb woman, filthy dirty slut, (you are) snot on the door, old grumpy box, pooped out Aunt Sidonia, asshole, a pooped out Mihun bite, I wish you misery for 2018, throat inflammation, that you become blind and deaf, cunt, chemotherapy eyebrows, spiritual women’s gag: dirty cauliflower smell, dirty fart girl, rancor bitch, I writhe with pleasure, I feel the power taking off between my buttocks , Constantia excreted like turd, Hey lettuce head, Hey tart, gas in your face, Bitch Constantia I would prefer to sit on top of your stubborn face sitting down with my weight until I hear literally crack and you no longer move!!!” Anyway, I’ve probably forgotten a few more.1\n\nThe theory of Robbert and Stan that a hacker sent hate and death threats to numerous people via Robbert’s mailbox and Social Media accounts (Facebook and Twitter), and thus absolutely not Robbert, can be definitively and demonstrably relegated to the trash can. To my great surprise, Robbert and Stan had taken the trouble to re-upload their “hacker story” on YouTube on July 23, 2018, now with English subtitles, so apparently meant for the English-speaking public and the America that Robbert is drooling about like crazy. In my view, an attempt to clean their own house procatively for the purpose of the still fairly ignorant foreign countries.\n\nVan den Broeke is still actively and relentlessly continuing to “predict” and “find” crop circles, fake pictures of spirits and so on. The difference with the past is that he, just like charlatans who are not taken seriously (anymore) in their own country, shifts his ambitions to foreign countries and especially America. He already succeeds on a limited scale via someone who calls himself Johny Webb and filmmaker William Gazecki. Yet he is already stumbling upon the stone of reality. His “alien tentacles”, which according to many down-to-earth Dutch and non-Dutch people look damn much like octopus arms, turned out to be exactly that after DNA analysis: octopus-arms. 🐙\n\nWebb went to offer them at the Natural History Museum in London and the result came back as: 100% Octopus Vulgaris. On his Facebook page, Robbert van den Broeke had broadly announced the upcoming alien tentacle DNA research, but then it remained suspiciously silent.\n\nWhen I critically questioned this silence on my Genverbrander10 twitter account, I received the following mail from Stan in my virtual mailbox, saying; “We are now making a documentary with William. The DNA results will be included in it.\n\nWe are not going to bring this news out cheaply was the deal. It is earth-shattering.”\n\nSuddenly, on 13 July 2018, Johny Webb in one of his videos did reveal the DNA result. He appeared to have felt social scrutiny to say something about it. Understandably, since these “alien tentacles” have been Robbert van den Broeke’s Waterloo since June 2015. Johny, however, felt duped by the Natural History Museum, nót by Robbert van den Broeke. Reason: in the accompanying letter the museum had not correctly described his octopus specimen, and he also found the DNA results suspiciously concise (they paid £408 (about $530) for this research).\n\n…\n\nRobbert rapidly overturned public embarrassment and did so on his new website (launched Mid-July 2018 with operating language: English):\n\nShortly after Johny Webb, American filmmaker William Gazecki also visited Robbert. Johny had reportedly seen a very small and unsightly crop circle emerging in Robbert’s company when they had looked away for a moment (uh no, so they didn’t see it “emerge”, and it may also be that Johny just did not look carefully beforehand). But this was only the prelude to something literally much bigger: “the largest crop circle in the Netherlands“. (Unfortunately not, Robbert) This one was “found” in the company of William Gazecki and actually predicted by no other than Robbert.2\n\nWilliam Gazecki obviously refuses to establish a serious background check on Robbert and apparently never heard of partners in crime too: people who help Robbert, also when making crop circles. He is just as believer as Johny Webb and has started a Crowdfunding to make a “reality TV series” about Robbert.\n\nUpdate Gazecki August 23, 2018: William Gazecki decided to end all collaboration with Robbert overnight. Reason as yet unknown.\n\nStan\n\nStan has sent me a lot of audios again, I uploaded some “highlights” on Soundcloud. Stan’s unctuous and in principle not at all unpleasant voice (he would talk a snake out of his skin)-audios could be put on “Repeat” without noticing the difference between any of them. They all ride the same hobbyhorses.\n\nBecause of the Oxygen series in August and September 2017, and in any case, it was again about Natalee Holloway, that she really is in Grave number 15 (click!) (With small crack in the grave) on St. Anna in Aruba. Stan really wanted to talk to the FBI, but nobody wants to listen to them (Robbert and Stan). Stan finds it extremely annoying that in my Knaapje blog I made a link from Joran to him, Stan in Aruba. But in doing so, Stan always forgets that I did not come up with that theory, but he himself together with his Micha Romijn (whoever that is), for this purpose see the Knaapje Drive files (not complete).\n\nA few of his audios were about former group member Roy. Stan came back several times to Roy’s statement that he had said that Stan had misused his bank account, claiming that he could prove that Roy was lying.3\n\nOn 30 November (Stan) and 23 December (Robbert) I received from both Robbert and Stan (integral recording) the announcement that Robbert had applied for a passport and would go to Aruba with Emile Ratelband to open Natalee Holloway’s grave. A quaint development that becomes even more quaint when you realize that Emile Ratelband was one of Robbert and co’s victims in terms of hate mail and hacks. Via Facebook I contacted Emile Ratelband about this, but he hardly responded and said he did not owe anyone an explanation. The trip was canceled not long afterwards.\n\n…\n\nSome last thoughts for this blog:\n\nOn 22 February 2018 Stan reported by mail that a brick had been thrown through the window of Robbert’s window on the first floor. Robbert’s favorite tree on the Palingstraat was also damaged. He wrote: “It is not funny, he could have got it on his head”. Stan sent a video of Robbert showing this, not the same clip that they would post on YouTube later. Critical people wondered whether this was perhaps a kind of Munchausen syndrome, because it is physically almost impossible to throw a heavy brick through a window so high and accurately.\n\nOn April 12, 2018, I received the same mail message with “Stan” as the signed sender twice via Robbert’s mailbox, reporting that Robbert had been arrested by the police for open defecation; “Robbert had a great urge due to a blocked sewer in his house and practiced open defecation in the bushes near Breda airport Pangevaartbos” (whole text on request).\n\nOn April 22, 2018, I received an old-fashioned hardcore hate mail from Robbert van den Broeke, and when Stan claimed through an audio file that this was “humor” , I deployed a temporary Twexit. On May 1, 2018, I had an important Twitter announcement for Robbert and Stan, namely that I would not watch and listen to their clips and audios anymore and I have been adhering to that since April 22, 2018. I mentioned that I may continue reading their text-mails . Only during the writing of this blog, I briefly and fleetingly viewed the three clips of Robbert I hadn’t watched, following up on my own new “rule”. Despite my repeated Twitter communication, Stan sent me to this day a reasonable freight load (70 pieces after April 23, 2018) emails, of which twenty-nine audios and clips that I no longer listened to and watched (none, Stan!) . Robbert sent three emails after April 22, of which one email contained three clips.\n\nOn June 15, 2018, I had a very special request to Stan via Twitter, but then he and / or Robbert had to find out for themselves what that was. No problem would you think, for these two men who claim that they are highly sensitive / clairvoyant. But that was disappointing. Stan started to guess by mail and Robbert also made an attempt by mail. All wrong.\n\nOn June 29, 2018 I tweeted towards Stan an idea that I got on the spot because he kept demanding that I delete my blogs. I wanted € 1.5 million, then I would delete my blogs. Of course I did not expect to get that, and if I did, I would be the first to go to the FBI with the question of checking the money. I then received a mail from veteran “Sander de Graaf” (aka Stan) who countered my “requested sum of money” with €30.000 Euro. Stan denied not so much later that he was this Sander de Graaf (he had admitted to the “previous” Sander de Graaf). On Twitter, Stan’s husband Alan (or Stan under his account, or both) suddenly talked to me in detail on July 25, 2018, seemingly friendly, but with a hateful undertow, also about my requested sum of € 1.5 million, but deleted his entire account swiftly after he had said about Joran van der Sloot that Joran already received all the(ir) money. Alan also said he has “a rich family”. The tone of several tweets reminded me that Robbert van den Broeke probably did not quite hate mail all by himself. This too was followed by Stan’s denial that this was Alan, with the remark: “You are being manipulated by a 3rd.” I do assume that it was Alan and Stan, the account had been active on Twitter at least since March 2018 with Alans photos and Alan had also responded in March, and I had responded to that, and for months there was no denial on their side (and they have proven to spell out my Twitter account on a daily basis).\n\nUpdate – One day after blog publication:\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] The old acquaintances were Micha Romijn, Anne Kuiters, Sven (the brother of Stan) and Alan (the husband of Stan). The new unknowns involved one Harvey de M (full name known to me), “Mr Klijn” and “Floris Dutczak”. Language use of “Anne” and “Sven” made me unmistakably think of Stan again and was extremely obsceen (concrete texts on request). Language of “Mr Klijn” was even more serious and outright qualifiable as “threatening”. I also received part of his e-mails via Stan’s mailbox, under the guise of: “Look what I received …”. Through this account and a fake account in my own name (constantacriminal@gmail.com) I received very vulgar and threatening language, partly photoshopped in pictures. In September 2017 I also received a few long mails under this fake gmail account which supposedly explained how it really was with Stan and the hacker (texts on request).\n\nPiquant detail in this is that in a a couple of these mails the disclaimer of the Donders Institute was used, an institute that, according to Robbert van den Broeke and Stan, would carry out scientific research with Robbert van den Broeke.\n\nOn June 25, 2018, I received a new email from “Micha Romijn”, four pieces (all documents can be requested by serious journalists).\n\nThe series I received via “Dhr Klijn”, Stan and a fake Constanta-gmail account in September 2017: (! two most threatening removed in 2019 !)\n\nRobbert emails (selection, click or swipe to be able to read it):\n\nRobbert videos (selection, click or swipe to see / play) – when you click on the pictures, you get the playable link.\n\nNote: if no links appear below the images, this is due to the method of opening this page.

And this Soundcloud file about Roy I already mentioned in my last blog. (all Dutch)\n\n– I want to thank Sjaan again for all her input.\n\nThe domino that fell\n\nOn June 24, 2017, I published part II and now, not even two months later, part III of “Behind The Screens At Robbert Van Den Broeke”. The reason is simple: there has been a rapid acceleration. Yet again, I will pick up the thread chronologically, not to make this already complex story unnecessarily complicated. So, what happened after June 24, 2017 that part III is already needed again?\n\nAfter the publication of my part II, the radio silence did not last for a long time. I received mails from Stan and “Micha Romijn” again. On the side of Stan, first, some weak defense and squirting mails, “Micha Romijn” began again with his split mails about his innocence and being hacked. There was a mail from Stan about Leidy, that was quickly followed by an email that he (Stan) was hacked again, and so forth, in fact, a repetition. Robbert suddenly suffered from Russian poisoning when I received the following mail on June 29, 2017:\n\n…\n\nHowever, in the days before, I had received several photo shops sent to me and made by Stan, including photoshops Stan had done on Fred Melssen and me, both rejuvenated and made old, as well as other photo shops of Jack Spijkerman, Alan and himself, so I immediately thought this picture was also fake and came from Stan, not Robbert.\n\nRobbert, meanwhile, on the same day, June 29, 2017, was immersing himself in important life questions (despite his being poisoned) because he asked me in a video clip (Dutch only) (again) why he increasingly looks like a “gore crook”.\n\nBut on the same day, June 29, 2017, something else happened, something that added significant momentum to the Robbert van den Broeke and Stan, – and I have to add – Joran van der Sloot case. It’s a matter of fact that the Robbert-Stan-Joran’s mysterious triangular relationship began to unravel.\n\nStan had found me on Skype (not difficult, as I had given my Skype address to “Micha Romijn” in the time that I gave him little benefit of the doubt) and began to talk to me (as always unsolicited) on Skype. By the way, I did not reply here either.\n\nHere are some essential screenshots (click as always for “big”, Dutch only):\n\n…\n\nI received this file and initially devoted almost no attention to it because it was late in the (California) evening:\n\nI did send it to Fred Melssen and Pepijn van Erp immediately and then went to bed.\n\nThe next day I received some good feedback from Pepijn and I tweeted the document and then uploaded it in the rather “famous” Genverbrander Drive. Then Pepijn van Erp picked up my tweet immediately and posted this:\n\nTranslation: “Money flow from the Netherlands to Joran van der Sloot, especially from people around Robbert van den Broeke. And also of that weird American lady.”\n\nThis financial sheet shows that Leidy Figuerora, Joran van der Sloot’s wife, had received over 200,000 euros in a couple of years, including through the family of Stan’s husband, Alan, and through Robberts and Stans’s friend: Royn. Also, Joran van der Sloot’s sugar aunt Mary Hamer was there bringing financial gifts.\n\nI was surprised that Stan sent this, but I thought, once again, that this must be one of his twisted moves and that he had transmitted the file on purpose. However, Stan denied that by mail and by audio.\n\n…\n\nAnd per audio (click! Dutch only), as mentioned in the second picture (Dutch).\n\nOn July 6, 2017, “Micha Romijn” mailed again and he deemed it necessary to supplement the already idyllic “Micha Romijn” ID gallery with new ID pictures:\n\n#### (Deleted by WordPress upon complaint by Micha Romijn, with fake ID or not)\n\nHe also sent the copy of a Polish ID of one of the Sieradzki’s (one Grazyna Jadwiga Sieradzka) one day later, which I haven’t published. But it is the name that is mentioned in the aforementioned financial sheet.1 I did place it anonymized on Twitter and this time there were no threats of “Micha” that he would report me to the police.\n\nOn July 7, 2017, I received via Robben van den Broeke’s mailbox a rather long movie clip in which Joran van der Sloot talks via Skype from his Peru prison with Stan. Not long after, Stan admitted that he had sent it via Robbert’s mailbox.\n\n…\n\nI published that movie clip on YouTube the same day. (Click! Dutch only)\n\nIn this clip Joran van der Sloot drops the word “St. Anna” for the first time. It also becomes apparent, that the clip in a timely manner must have been recorded in 2014, because at that time, Joran’s child “Dushi” was not born yet and in this clip Joran is telling about him becoming a father soon and that Stan will be his child’s godfather (the word seems rather unusual thinking about Stan).\n\nThis “St. Anna” as the burial place of Natalee Holloway has been a hot topic for Robbert van den Broeke and Stan for a long time. In February / March 2014, Robbert van den Broeke published a clip in which he said that he, through cosmic means, had been given information about the place where Natalee Holloway’s remains could be found. However, he removed this clip shortly thereafter, as I already reported in my Behind The Scenes Of Robbert van den Broeke Part I.\n\nWhen I tried to find the exact date, I found a mail of mine to Pepijn van Erp:\n\nTranslation: “Right, he feels that he soon knows and is allowed to say something more about Natalee Holloway. The cheat, he has already for some time talked to Stan with Joran about it.”\n\nThis mail responded to the fact that there was material that Joran had secretly taped in prison, talking about his paranormal experiences with Robbert van den Broeke in Peru’s prison. These fragments appeared on Robberts own site, spread across multiple places, I took the trouble to cut them out and paste them together, see this clip.2\n\n…\n\nAnd before that, there was hassling abount paranormal events between Robbert and Joran, and this was found on his own site under the event of “Joran van der Sloot sees apparition of Robbert” in March 2013 .3\n\nThe clip in which Robbert, dressed in a blue sweater, talks about Natalee Holloway’s location, St. Anna, was in any case from February or March 2014.\n\nThe “St. Anna” came back again, namely in Robbert van den Broeke’s and co hate mail: (Dutch)\n\n…\n\nThe article by Vincent Verweij\n\nBack to the present. Well, exactly one day later, after I published the Skype conversation from Joran and Stan via Twitter, YouTube and the Genverbrander Drive, on 8 July 2017, an article by Vincent Verweij appeared on crimesite.nl about both the bank statement and the Skype conversation, that he in turn had found in an article by Martijn Mastenbroek who in his turn had found that material via my Twitter account Genverbrander10 (account name changed to RobConstantia on October 14, 2020).\n\nStan on Aruba?, The Hanger\n\nLooking at this sub header, you may already think, in the atmosphere of Joran van der Sloot, “Stan on Aruba?”, shouldn’t that be “Joran on Aruba?”. Here comes a new cat out of the bag. On July 11, 2017, I received from “Micha Romijn” an email that surprised me a lot. If so, all the grub of Robbert and Stan around the burial site of Natalee Holloway suddenly became a lot more comprehensible. They had always claimed Robbert was getting paranormal information about the whereabouts of Natalee Holloway’s remains, and they (now) claimed she could be found at St. Anna Church in Aruba, in a grave that was double occupied. This “psychic information” suddenly appeared much less paranormal, and on the contrary: quite banal and down-to-earth, because Stan according to “Micha Romijn” was there with Joran van der Sloot, yes, you read that correct, when Natalee Holloway disappeared on May 30, 2005.\n\nThe site of Robbert mentions the fact that Stan met Joran in 2008, and I and others also never questioned it (a good lesson, though, not to accept everything without evidence). “Micha” suddenly sent these mails:\n\nTranslation:\n\n“https://youtu.be/o3cI_tA0fJA\n\nHe is a victim of Stan.”\n\n“He was involved with Joran, and friend of Stan and Joran in the time Nathalee disappeared. He lost his mind over this tragedy. Stan was also on Aruba with Joran and accomplice. Robbert knows that secret. Stan knows where Nathalee is because he was there.”\n\n…\n\nThe “Micha Romijn” person also , I myself had traced back to Stan, as being one and the same.4\n\nBut why would Stan scatter this (false) information around about himself? Stan had said to me in a few mails that he had a secret that he wanted to share with me, but he could not, because I would misinterpret it and certainly would share it with the world (the latter is correct ). I never guessed what it was, but suddenly something started to dawn on me. Was this Stan’s secret: that he did not meet Joran in 2008, but before and maybe even in 2005? Stan was born on January 16, 1989, which meant he was 16 plus a little something years old, only 1.5-year-2 plus years younger than Joran van der Sloot (August 6, 1987) and Natalee Holloway (October 21, 1986), who on the fatal day of Natalees disappearance, May 30, 2005, were 18 and 17 respectively.\n\nWe must also keep in mind that just before Joran van der Sloot committed the murder on Stephany Flores, he spoke extensively with Stan.\n\n…\n\nAnd why had Stan been so busy with Robbert for so many years, “helping him with scientific research”, the many tricks they probably produced and launched together? Why did those two keep me sending mails, clips, pictures and audio files? It seemed a mystery.\n\nIn addition, Roy, who used to belong to Robbert’s intimi, eventually dropped out of the group, because through the medium of Vincent’s article he suddenly was airing the dirty laundry about Stan, and the breakup between him and Robbert and Stan seemed to be complete. A breakup was already reported on Robbert van den Broeke’s Facebook page, but this post was later removed. I did save screenshots back then.5\n\nNow, Stan’s motivation – as far as Robbert van den Broeke was concerned, seemed a lot less “spiritual”, and a whole lot more earthly motivated. It was a double-edged sword: Robbert van den Broeke would become world famous because he had succeeded as a paranormal medium to point out Natalee Holloway’s remains, and Stan could finally “legitimately” get rid of his Joran van der Sloot secret.\n\nJoran had become a nasty piece of work, who practiced his power over Stan from prison and wanted to see money on a monthly basis because he knew (knows) things about Stan. What kind of things specifically, that is not clear yet.\n\nHowever, when Joran apparently did not receive enough money from Stan, he sent a letter in 2015 in which he threatened to drop bombs on Stan and Robbert.\n\nWhat these “bombs” consisted of was a big riddle for everyone, but I think the fog is now lifting. Stan wanted to use the “medium” Robbert as a hanger to hang his secret, namely that he knows what happened to Natalee Holloway and where her last earthly remains are. Robbert could prove this as a phenomenal visionary to the world.\n\nThis given was reinforced by the mail of “Micha Romijn” and on 14 July 2017, also by an audio file of Stan.\n\nAgainst my usual self, I did not post the shocking mail by “Micha Romijn” about Stan as an accomplice to Joran on Aruba on Twitter, but I tried to contact Dutch media and the FBI. I did speak to the Sacramento FBI (by phone) and emailed them too, but (of course), heard nothing about that anymore. I was planning to tell nobody, because I didn’t know what the consequences could be, but a couple of days later, I told a small group of people, that committed to discretion about it, anyway.\n\nBut I felt this needed to be sorted out first, away from the “normal” public eye. This apparently disappointed Stan, because he started to send me more audios about him on Aruba, and one in which he suddenly said that he had spoken to “Micha Romijn” (yes, yes, the one who had hacked him and Robbert) and that he thought he knew what “Micha Romijn” had said to me: that “Micha” had said he was there with Joran van der Sloot, when Natalee Holloway disappeared. However, in this audio file, he moved on quickly to another subject, to sow his usual confusion and to rejuvenate the usual smoke curtains. Stan also used a bait story about Roy, I think he expected me to publish this audio right away. However, I released the audio about Roy a while later, cut out of Stans Aruba’s story, still, which did not yield me a foul response from Stan, but from Robbert van den Broeke. Part I, Part II, Part III (Dutch only)\n\nWhen I received mails from “Micha” / Stan about Stan on Aruba, I had this insight: “Do not publish now”. And I thought: hey, but why not? And a little later, I thought why, because I would only play Stan into the hands. He apparently wanted me to publish this, that he had been to Aruba (with Joran). And why would he want that? To blow away the smoke coming from his gun? To deprive Joran of his power over him? To sow great consternation and make everyone crazy? The latter seems plausible at this time. Stan as the “Master Cheat and Mind Manipulator”. Stan, the mentalist junkie.\n\nI myself had called upon Joran van der Sloot on Twitter, following all recent events, that he had to come up with a statement about Stan now, that the tide was high. Probably, I’d stepped on Stan’s toes with this, even without having noticed myself doing so:\n\n…\n\nStan was under great pressure and now wanted everybody interested in this case to consider the idea that he had been on Aruba. Why, I do not know, but I know that he is trying to use me as a mouthpiece, to put Joran van der Sloot under a lot of pressure. Also later, more Stan’s audios followed about Joran van der Sloot, “Micha Romijn” and him (whether or not) on Aruba, but I did not publish them anymore, because it was now clear to me that Stan was trying to abuse me for his great misdemeanor plan, perhaps to put Joran van der Sloot out of his mind and put him completely out of control.\n\nAlso on 27 and 28 July 2017, I received two more emails now, really true !, really of the true “Micha Romijn”, under the name “Neo the One”, and – oh big surprise – he too asked me to remove his “ID pictures” from the internet..\n\n…\n\nHowever, it seems to me quite plausible that Stan hoped that, through “medium” Robbert, an eye-catching discovery about Natalee Holloway could be launched into the world, and he could use Robbert van den Broeke as a hanger “boy” in his very doubtful dark world.\n\nEven Stan himself finds his own truth incredibly complicated, just listen (Dutch only).\n\nThe role of Bjorn mentioned by “Micha Romijn” must also be investigated.\n\nAt the end of July 2017, Stan managed to complicate the matter further by poking someone with whom I collaborated privately, and that person couldn’t resist. I won’t go into details with that. Again, (being not the first time) I was sick and tired of the whole thing and I and locked my Twitter account Genverbrander10. However, in August 2017, again, mails of Stan started to come in. But again in the same line: again on relationships between Joran van der Sloot and himself and him on Aruba. To be continued.\n\nThe “Knaapje” dossier (Dutch only, click!) in Genverbrander Drive\n\nHet “Knaapje”dossier (Dutch only) in Genverbrander Drive, specific mails Stan sent about him on Aruba (with Joran).\n\n*** Startfile of manipulating Stan audio files (or via Knaapje Dossier) (Dutch only) ***\n\n*** On August 19, 2017, the American Broadcasting Oxygen will launch a series about the search of Natalee Holloway’s father for Natalee’s remains. It is possible Stan will also be mentioned, whether or not by name. ***\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] In addition, the Polish surnames of women end up in an A instead of an I, but it still concerns “The Sieradzki’s”.\n\n[2] A Spanish-speaking channel also picked up this and published under the title: “Asesino Joran Van Der Sloot Dice Tener experiencia Paranormal” (“Murderer Joran van der Sloot claims to have paranormal experience”) in February 2014.\n\n[3] For example, this can also be found on Omroep Brabant (October 2013).\n\n[4] I already substantiated that in Part II. There were more hard and soft clues (than already discussed). For example, “Micha Romijn” once sent a screenshot picture and it appeared to have been shot by exactly the same iPhone as a shot by Stan of Alan (very high probability: unique ICC identifier, for the used device:e5bb0e9867bd46cd4bbe446ebd1b7598). A “soft clue” may be considered the identical language of “Micha” and Stan, the writing of “Nathalee” is one example, something Gisela noticed.\n\n[5] Screenshots Robbert van den Broeke about his breakup with Roy:\n\nThis time I want especially to thank Sjaan.\n\nShort recap\n\nRobbert van den Broeke- Arrest /// Wikipedia version June 6, 2017 by me, just a few sentences from previous contributor /// On January 6, 2016, Van den Broeke was arrested for alleged threat. There were seven reports, although more than seven people were actually threatened. According to various sources in the media, the people pressing charges were: Liesbeth van Dijk, Emile Ratelband, Ans Markus, Henk Verhaeren, Rinke Jacobs, Jan Willem Nienhuys en Bert Brussen.1 The by now American Constantia Oomen who was/is one of Robbert van den Broeke’s main victims, attempted to report in the Netherlands from the United States but failed to succeed because of her absence on Dutch territory. She did file a complaint at the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3). An example of some other people who were affected severely (Colin Andrews) or to a lesser degree (Andy Russell) by the hate mail of Robbert van den Broeke were the internationally known crop circle expert Colin Andrews2 and also crop circle expert Andy Russell3 and Viola Holt.4 Van den Broek’s house was searched and he was under arrest for six days in an Amsterdam detention cell. Robbert van den Broeke’s friend Stan was officially co-accused, among other things, due to a leaked conversation in possession of local broadcaster Omroep Brabant, that reveals the demeaning way Robbert van den Broeke and Stan talk about Irene Moors and Constantia Oomen. “I would like to kick her into a coma with steel noses.”5 His lawyer denied the threats and claimed his email box and Facebook page were hacked.6\n\nMy last update was dated February / March 2016 and covered the two hectic months of Robbert van den Broeke’s arrest and the interview that Robbert van den Broeke gave to local broadcaster Omroep Brabant on February 10, 2016, in which he confessed that it was indeed he and Stan who were discussing Irene Moors and myself in an almost satanic manner7\n\nAFTER THE ARREST\n\nThis update covers the period between this and the previous update. The day that Broadcaster Omroep Brabant published their intrusive report about Robbert van den Broeke, February 20, 2017 and June 24, 2017, the publication date of this update. Google Gmail tells me that at this time I received 222 emails from Stan (excluding his mails using a pseudo, because then there would be more) and 53 from his friend Robbert van den Broeke.\n\n…\n\nIndeed, for the total first-reader of my blog (s): the (now hateful rather than simple “hate”) mails did not stop after the arrest.\n\nWhen I received their mails exactly, can be seen in the hate mail charts. To me, these charts have been very helpful, because the mail chronology helps me to keep everything in check. This indeed is a confusing story if you do not keep your head cool.\n\nI still call the charts hate mail charts, because I didn’t ask for their emails and they never cease to cause (some) anxiety. The real gruesome hatemails with severe death threats (whether or not by means of hit men threats) , coarse curses, photos of beheadings and dismembered corpses and faeces are not coming anymore (I say cautiously). Apparently, the arrest had made some impression on “Team Robbert van den Broeke”.\n\nAfter Van den Broeke’s days in detention, the very severe death threats and hate mail were replaced by weird mail with lots of various attachments. I not only received them from Robbert van den Broeke and Stan, but from other mail identities too; from people clearly intimately involved in the case. So intimately involved that the boundaries between these people and Robbert and Stan were no longer clear, until I concluded that these people were the same as Stan or at least in close contact with Robbert and Stan. Hopefully you can still follow me.\n\nTherefore, I also included the “Anne Kuiters“, “Micha Romijn“, “Sander de Graaf” and “Mieke Veen” mails in the hate mail tables of 2017. The explanation about these four people follows a little further in the blog.\n\nFarewell to Enrico and Janny Post\n\n…\n\nBack to the most unnerving Robbert van den Broeke months: January and February 2016. On February 14, 2016, Robberts Dutch promoterJanny Post passed away. And the week before, on February 7, 2016, Robbert had lost another important friend, Enrico , who had helped him with his English affairs and his website.\n\nMoreover, Enrico, who knew he would soon die, had chosen a photo with Dave Haith to appear on Robbert’s camera as “proof” of Robberts “paranormal” gift and of course: the afterlife. Which photo was chosen was not communicated to Robbert. According to Colin Andrews, the photo of Enrico has never appeared in the “paranormal” pictures of Robbert van den Broeke.8\n\nFurther 2016\n\nIn addition, in February 2016, Robbert van den Broeke’s best buddies Stan and Alan (now: Alan …, who married Stan) went abroad, to Malaga, Spain. Probably nobody will deny that Robbert van den Broeke himself was in a difficult time of his life.\n\nStan explains why he left for Malaga:\n\n(Translation: “Yes, I am in Malaga, Constantia. That was planned for a long time ago already with Alan. After your delusion that I had imitated Robbert with a voice actor, I just had enough of it all. All that injustice.”)\n\nThe police had interrogated and detained Robbert van den Broeke for six days, and the possibility to receive a similar treatment didn’t sit well with Stan. Indeed, he was officially co-accused in this hate and threatening case and the idea of the police interrogating and detaining him too, was not at all far-fetched. At least seven people had reported.\n\nThe reason he left for Malaga thus seemed to be caused/promoted by a mistake on my part. I suggested in a short update blog that he had imitated Robbert van den Broeke about Irene Moors and me with a voice actor. In other words, I did not believe that Robbert himself was on the leaked tapes. At that time, I’d psyched myself out so much about the Robbert van den Broeke gang, that I did not see it as clear anymore. But I really believed this and Stan felt that I was serious about this, and apparently was in shock that he was suspected of having backstabbed his mate Robbert. My mistake was probably something good, because it made the outside world clear that there was really something going on with Stan’s share in the whole. I removed this erroneous assumption when some skeptical friends convinced me that I was mistaken. And later, Robbert’s confession confirmed the authenticity of the leaked tapes. By then, Stan had already fled and he would stay away for a year.\n\nI will only touch briefly on what was mailed to me in the past year. For some people, it’s hard to understand what exactly is the relationship between Robbert van den Broeke, Stan and myself, but I’m the unsolicited recipient of very many email messages with attachments in the form of pictures, photo shots, audio and video clips, by Robbert van den Broeke and Stan.\n\nI report on all this on my Genverbrander10 account (Twitter name changed to RobConstantia on October 14, 2020), which regularly results in Stan’s reactions by mail. Robbert seems to be less logical responding and mails according to his own moods. I suspect they send this to make me mad and to intimidate me, to involve me, and out of sheer madness and craziness. Stan is even more fanatic than Robbert in terms of mails.\n\nPart of public opinion seems to be, that I should have just blocked their mail, but this is simply not what I have in mind. If they want to email me all this stuff, so let them, but my goal with this is, to solve this “Genverbrander” case once and for all, so that Robbert and gang’s fraud goes away. All too too often, “paranormal offenders” continue their deception for a lifetime. James Randi of the former Randi Organization saw and predicted that very well (though rather in his own “unkind” choice of words), as far as Robbert van den Broeke is concerned:\n\nThe remainder of the year 2016 went along relatively quiet while Stan was in Malaga. Although he did not fail to email me regularly, it was not that grave and between October 2016 and February 2017 I was even not emailed at all by the two (at least not under their real name).\n\nAn overview:\n\nMarch 2016 – 4 mails from Stan only. It is worth noting that he says to stay in Malaga because he would be arrested in the Netherlands to be interrogated by the police and at that time he would not be allowed to leave the Netherlands.\n\nApril 2016 – 7 mails from Stan only. Nothing noteworthy\n\nMay 2016 – 4 mails from Stan only, noteworthy only his unkind words about “Anne Kuiters” who mailed me (33 times in total) about Stan, but much later it will turn out that this Anne probably does not exist at all and is possibly even Stan himself.\n\nJune 2016 – 4 mails from only Stan, including an audio in which he discusses the research on Robbert and Fred Melssen (positively) en Pepijn van Erp (negatively).\n\nJuly 2016 – Nothing\n\nAugust 2016 – 12 mails from Stan, divided between two streams: “New and Many Witnesses”, proving that Robbert is genuine, and Stan’s suggestion that Robbert and he are completely innocent of threats and hacks.\n\nSeptember 2016 – A sudden upturn in mails with 35 mails including 9 from Robbert and the rest of Stan. Robbert reports that his friends Roy and Karin Swiers have left him. The resurgence seems to be reflected in one of Robbert van den Broeke’s paranormal trucages of that time and the fact that I reacted critically to that on my Genverbrander10 Twitter account, which apparently caused a lot of consternation in “Team Robbert van den Broeke”.\n\nStan e-mailed about the person who mailed me, “Micha Romijn” of whom I already suspected it was Stan himself (22 June, 2017: 69 mails) and accuses “Micha” of slander (see explanation below). In addition, he sends me a few mails asking me, emphasizing (too much), if I can email him back. However, I have never emailed him again since May 2015.\n\nA contemptuous mail from Robbert revealing that he has discovered my love for plush lions (see my Lion Heart blogs) and ridiculing it.\n\nStan again mails about Robbert’s research, positive about Fred Melssen and again negative about Pepijn van Erp. A lot of Stan mail about “evidence” of Robbert’s “authenticity” and their “innocence”.\n\nRobbert’s “paranormal” excesses in 2016\n\nHis first, really striking paranormal blunder of the year 2016 was made by Robbert on June 3rd, 2016, when he aired a clip of his so-called filmed out-of-body experience on his YouTube channel. The clip looked like a textbook example of a demonstration video of (how to achieve certain effects of) Adobe Premier Pro, because in this program it’s pretty easy to mix images as is demonstrated in this very similar video clip by a meritorious YouTuber.\n\nGreat hilarity arose among the more critical people, when they/we discovered that “astral Robbert” was casting a physical shadow on the wall and especially as he walked past a picture frame. Even some of his fans started to mutter and quite some ridiculing reactions were posted under this video. Stan later tried raising a defense that Robbert’s astral appearance was so strong that he cast a physical shadow, but to me this was a blunder of epic proportions comparable to Robbert van den Broeke’s octopus tentacles blunder just one year earlier. Stan, who manages – among other things, like Robbert’s email9 – Robberts YouTube Channel, suddenly removed the clip. Only the interview clip about the “out-of-body experience remained.\n\nLook at the right wall during this clip:\n\nThe paranormal / astral phenomenon of the out-of-body experience had triggered “Team Robbert van den Broeke” earlier on already in 2016, because in early May 2016 excited messages were emerging on Facebook that Robbert had appeared to Alan and Stan in their apartment in Malaga while Robbert was in the Netherlands and according to his own relay had fallen flat on the ground and then appeared to be “out of it”. Stan, as always vigilant and alert, immediately took a picture and captured an image of Robbert van den Broeke moving out of his body and in Stan and Alan’s apartment in Malaga.\n\nOn August 10, 2016 Robberts new video of an “orb making a grass circle” was briefly and modestly taking off internationally, but when the clip was a proven fake, after Team Robbert delivered the “raw file” to be researched (and maybe gambling their luck on underskilled receivers, with no such luck), fame turned ruin again. Shortly afterwards again, Team Robbert van den Broeke was trying their luck again with a similar clip, trying to prove it was really genuine, but this clip was even more fake than the first. To make a long story short, they had tampered with a file and then shot the photoshopped videoclip again from a computerscreen so the clip was one whole again and new “genuine”, “raw data” was obtained.\n\n…\n\nThat fact that the first clip (and shortly after that, the second too) was tampered with, was proved on the Facebook page of Crop Circle Challenge and Stan, in response thereto was mailing me, but also on the Facebook page of Janez (the keeper of the page) he responded. However, when he discovered Janez wasn’t language-wise as delicate as me, he appeared to be heavily offended (“Slander, I will file a complaint against you, Janez!”) and quickly removed his online reactions. There is also an email from Robbert about Janez, a very technical story, but in terms of language, Stan seems to be speaking.\n\nStart bizarre clips in Fall 2016\n\nIn September 2016, Robbert scornfully mails me that no hate emails are sent anymore and hence I can not do anything against him anymore, and that Nancy Talbott will be sending a lawyer after me (which turns out to be untrue, because nothing of the sort happened):\n\nQuick translation: “Pity for you, you don’t receive hatemails anymore, now you can’t do a thing. My computer is well protected, I am not hacked anymore, you are pestering me on the internet, and when I mail you back with funny responses, you still call them hatemail. Justice will know it isn’t hate. Nancy Talbott has hired a lawyer to go after you, so don’t be surprised when you see the police appearing on your doorstep. She (Nancy) isn’t as softhearted and forgiving as me.”\n\nWorth mentioning is the fact that in Fall 2016, Robbert himself and some other people are sending me short videoclips, partly directly addressed to me (Robbert in the clips themselves addressing me with “Hello Constantia…”) with the following themes: Robbert breaking wind to skeptics, Robbert namaste and ridiculing his fans , Robbert crazy-message to somebody else, Robbert drunk with beer, expanding elaborately on his arrest and how he is intensely enjoying himself with packed halls filled with fans and a very weird one about his arrest again, making funny faces and screaming with a very high pitched voice and yet another clip in which Robbert, in my opinion, does no untalented imitation of reporter John Bas of BN De Stem (who wrote about him). See also the Genverbrander Drive and sort by date.\n\nFurthermore, Stan’s tone of voice gradually becomes less pleasant and he turns out to be indignant about the suggested effects of my blog on his personal life:\n\nQuick translation: “(some vague story about taking pictures of stars after people like Pepijn and me were criticizing a new “paranormal” event of Robbert). You won’t ever acknowledge the fact that you are wrong. But know something. Because of your blog I missed out on a house I wanted to rent. That woman found all your slander on the internet about me. She didn’t trust me anymore. I won’t stand for things like that.\n\nSoon, I want you to remove that slander. You are causing damage in my life. I am serious! Stan”\n\nOctober 2016 – A couple of hateful mails from Robbert and Stan making it clearer that he wants to talk to me on the phone.\n\nAnd then it became quiet until February 2017.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nOther strange mailers\n\nAt this moment, I will take the opportunity to review some other strange mailers in this case, because they are necessary for understanding the complete picture.\n\n“Anne Kuiters” (33 mails) would have been a friend of Stan who once had received a great amount of money from Stan when she was experiencing hardship. “She” began to mail me about Robbert and Stan in 2015, and she was both positive and negative about them. “Her” four mails from 2015 were all received on the same day: September 28, 2015. Then I received 29 more of “her” mails in 2016 and 2017 after Robbert’s arrest date. For a while, I believed half-and-half or almost entirely that she was indeed an existing, fairly honest person. I kept it open because I just did not know. But the following and, in my view, very unlikely, “Stan-exculpating” mail from 2017 nevertheless troubled me:\n\nTranslation: “I have been treated I had psychoses. Everything I sent about Stan was false. I had just imagined it all. Greetings Anne Kuiters”\n\nI also received from “her” a mail written by Stan, he apparently had her mailbox under control (see the gallery direct below).\n\nStan admitted in a couple of audios he was “Sander de Graaf” (2 mails in February 2017). I will pick up on this story a little below.\n\n“Mieke Veen” admitted in “her” (15 mails, May-June 2017) mails of various kinds, including so-called remote assistance on a modem problem, which “she” knew about earlier than I did myself, and some obscene sex speeches, that “she” too was Stan and I received a mail from Stan from “her” address (see gallery pictures below).\n\nAnd last for now, “Micha Romijn” sent me such split mails (69) about his identity, that I also counted his mail in the 2017 hate mail charts. He began to mail in August 2016, but I have not counted the 2016 mails. Also from his address, I received a mail from Stan (see gallery pictures under the piece about “Micha”).\n\nThis is by far the most intense “character”. He started out with the story about how he knew Robbert van den Broeke through a homo chat, and about Stan he remained very vague, even after I repeatedly asked him if he knew Stan or stronger yet: if he was Stan (!). Suddenly, at some point, he said he did not know Stan. But he sent me things Robbert would have sent him, like some clips. The mails were very confusing as a whole, and people interested in this figure may ask me to email them the full “Micha Romijn file”. Much later, he went to some extremes, saying he was hacked by Stan and that he would report Stan to the police.\n\nSome example mails:\n\nShort translations: in exact order as shown by the screenshot below:\n\nSeptember 6, 2016 – “Micha”: “Yes, I am Stan, I am impersonating Micha so I can hear you out. Just kidding! Why would he (Stan) run off to Spain? I do wonder about all these people who say they have witnessed Robbert’s paranormal events. I did read about Robbert hacking you. And then this Joran guy speaking from his prison cell, I find this very funny, I just can’t help myself. Don’t you think this is a bit funny? Greetings Micha”\n\nSeptember 6, 2016 – “Micha”: “I do not know Stan, I forgot to answer your question about it. I met Robbert through a homo chat, I didn’t tell you about it, because I didn’t want to appear weird, I am sorry. Robbert did know I had a problem with my left ear and he was right about it. I was interested only in this small gifted side of him. I asked him critical questions about obviously fake photos and other stuff. Articles about his exposure, I only read later on. I think he needs help when he posts nude pictures of himself on Facebook, don’t you agree? Micha”\n\nSeptember 7, 2016 – “Micha”: “Can you quote me where I was saying I know Stan? I am curious about him now, I will mail him, his email address is on your Twitter page. He (Robbert) is sick, he likes it when these clips of him are published, he likes being naked on Facebook just as he likes his fart to appear on YouTube. Like he doesn’t assess what he’s doing. It proves he is sick.”\n\nSeptember 7, 2016 – Constantia: “But are you friends with Stan? i don’t understand. How could you know Robbert and don’t know Stan? So Robbert sends you clips, you send them to me, I publish them, so Robbert must know you gave them to me, and still he is sending you more stuff? Something doesn’t add up, sorry. Constantia”\n\nMay 21, 2017 – “Micha”: “Stan told me the truth about Robbert, that he is part real, part fake. Stan said he has shielded Robbert from a part of the tricks. He’s sorry he went along with it and that there’s no hacker, but that they can’t go back now. He would have liked to start all over, help Robbert prove his real gifted side. I’ve never seen Stan mad, but I did see Robbert very mad. Stan says Robbert has threatened him, but still Stan wants to help him, with scientific research too, he paid for.”\n\nMay 21, 2017 – Constantia: “What kind of things did he tell you, violent, sexual, angry?”\n\nMay 21, 2017 – “Micha”: “Give me your Skype name, then we can talk. This will establish trust. I will tell you things he told me you wouldn’t believe. I will give you audio if you promise you won’t publish it, because then he would know I leaked it to you.”\n\n…\n\nStrange enough, he sent me a copy of his Dutch ID, just without any reservations, even without urging me to keep it to myself , when I doubted him about his identity. The photo on that ID immediately struck me, because it looked photoshopped and, in my opinion, looked younger than what the ID said in the birth year. He wanted to talk to Skype with me, but I hold back for a long time. And when I finally agreed he did not show up anymore. I posted his full ID after a long wait and thought about it on Twitter and asked if anyone knew him.\n\nThen he angry, or played angry, sent me several pictures of him and his ID (they had no usable exif data on them), which instead of reassuring me, confirmed that there was shit hitting the fan, because, in my opinion, he was disguised. He demanded that I removed his ID from Twitter, and threatened to go to the police. I exactly wanted him to do that, because I hoped that could lead to a breakthrough in this case.\n\nHis victim’s role suddenly shifted to that of perpetrator when I received hack-threats and other disturbed sounds and hate-speeches from him with distorted voice!10 There were no real-voice audios of him. And my modem indeed – probably with a ddos attaque – was undermined. Although he threatened to now report me instead of Stan to the police, because now suddenly he suggested I or my husband was the hacker, I never heard about that “police report” again.\n\nHis extremely schizophrenic mails, which varied between the poisonous friend (sending me Robbert stuff without Robbert knowing about it), victim (of hacks) and perpetrator (he threatened and hacked me himself), as well as his extremely remarkable ID “confirmations” would in my opinion rather alarm the police about him instead of helping him in his “case”. Stan, meanwhile, who read my “Micha Romijn notifications” through my Twitter account, claimed by audio (Dutch) that Micha Romijn was the hacker who was behind all the hatred. An unlikely chaos had arisen which, in my opinion, was deliberately created to raise a smoke curtain around the criminal case Robbert van den Broeke. See all “Micha Romijn” ID pictures that I was “allowed” to receive:\n\n#### (Removed by WordPress upon an complaint by “Micha Romijn”(with fake ID or not, unknown)\n\nThe evidence that Stan was literally everywhere in this case, or even was these other persons for a 100%, I found in these three simultaneously received mails from successively Anne, Micha and Mieke:\n\n…\n\nText in all three emails was almost the same (and thus from three different email addresses!):\n\nHi, I’m Stan, the person who was trying to badmouth me, gave me the logging data to come clean with me. Check the mail header, this is not a spoof. I have been wrongly trashed by this person.\n\nOn the “Sander de Graaf” personality, I’ll be back right here.\n\n——————————————————————\n\nThe year 2017\n\nJust a year later, around February and March 2017, the sky around Robbert van den Broeke suddenly darkened quickly, in my opinion not coincidentally coinciding with the moment Stan decided to turn his back to Malaga and return to his homebase.\n\nOn 21 and 24 February 2017, I received two mails from Stan under the mentioned pseudonym Sander de Graaf, in which he offered me 10K and then 15K in succession to remove my blogs about Robbert and him.\n\n…\n\nAs I was not planning to mail, and still have no intentions to mail Stan, I did not respond to this. I did immediately inform Fred Melssen and John Bas (of BN De Stem) and a few days later Pepijn van Erp. Of course, I would never remove my blog for money because it is against my principles. In June 2017, I several times received a confession of Stan that he had indeed been “Sander de Graaf”, as can be heard on this recording of June 3, 2017.\n\nSo Stan was back in the Netherlands, and Robbert was very happy with that, and also literally said that in mails and clips, because from the end of March 2017 I suddenly received a significant flow of Robbert van den Broeke mails and especially videos that besides a lot of annoyance caused much hilarity and disbelief among the followers of my Twitter Genverbrander10 account. And of course, Stan played his part and sent me in particular incredible amount of audio recordings that shot into my mailbox (until publishing date of this blog: 80 audio recordings).\n\nThis was the first of Robbert van den Broeke’s mails “New Stile” and provided an adequate “genre” label for the forthcoming tumult:\n\nQuick translation: “Hello Constantia. I am pleased that you stopped harassing me with which you didn’t achieve anything. Fortunately I’m able to see Stan again. He reported himself to the police and they have interrogated him for only three hours, not the six days they interrogated me. After three hours they let him go, and he is off the wanted list. We will continue with our paranormal events on Facebook and it pleases me to say there will be a new website. I am very happy that your tireless effort has led to exactly nothing, you learn from your mistakes now, bad lady. Greetings Robbert”\n\nVideos and audios “Highlights”\n\nThe videos and audios of Robbert and Stan are so very numerous that it would take too long to describe them all. I will limit myself to a few “highlights” sorted around the main “themes”.\n\nRobbert is having a baby/(with) Leydi Figueroa\n\n“Storyline”: Robbert says he is expecting a child with a Dutch celebrity who would like to have a child with a high energy, he was just the donor, because he is still as gay as a hatter. However, he finds it very important that a new phase of his life has has started, and the child will certainly be a very high incarnation. For some time, it remains unclear who the lucky lady is.\n\nSome time later, I receive two clips from Leidy Uceda, Joran van der Sloot‘s wife (all through Robbert’s mailbox). I want to emphasize that I do not know the lady at all, except through the news of course. Furthermore, I’ve never talked to Robbert and Stan (and I’d like to keep it that way). Leidy obviously knows me through Stan and Robbert who, as I have already made clear in previous blogs, are friends with Joran van der Sloot, in a clip she says she had a car accident and that she loves me, in the other clip she says in Dutch: “I’m pregnant from Broeke”, wherein it is not clear if she knows what she’s saying. Robbert tells me in an email that the child survived and that he is very relieved. There are also reports from Robbert and Stan that Leidy had a near-death experience in which I appeared to Leidy. Stan says via an audio file that he sent me later, he thinks Leidy is not the recipient of Robberts seed and that Robbert must have been hacked again (totally vague and raising a smoke curtain again).\n\n* Received all these clips via mailbox Robbert van den Broeke *\n\nRobbert van den Broeke’s “Good Tidings” ( English caps by me)\n\nReceived: April 2, 2017\n\nRobbert van den Broeke, second video about his becoming a father\n\nReceived: April 6, 2017\n\n“It’s almost time Whoopee ( English caps by me)\n\nReceived: May 21, 2017\n\nLeidy Figueroa, wife Joran van der Sloot, message to Constantia\n\nReceived: June 8, 2017\n\nLeydi Figueroa Uceda – Message To Constantia II “I pregnant of Broeke”\n\nReceived: June 10, 2017\n\nRobbert is mad as hell\n\nRobbert is mad as hell and repeatedly calls me “cunt”. He explodes like a volcano talking about a photoshop I made in 2006, in which I was making a little fun of Randi . Robbert and Nancy Talbott were oblivious to this side of the story, because Nancy Talbott also describes my “bloodthirsty” photoshop ” “targeting Robbert” on her site and says how widespread it was not – * not * so. Randi is seen as Black Vulture preying on Robbert van den Broeke’s alleged body. Robbert has a lot of imagination, because he is talking about organs, blood and guts that can’t be seen on the low-resolution image it always was. It was one of my first photo shops and it was rather an underachievement in terms of craftsmanship. Robbert blames me that I would have started everything with this picture.\n\nRelated: In later (but also earlier) mails and audio files, Stan also emphasizes how many Robbert van den Broeke photo shops I made, according to him that is, because I’m afraid he’s confused with many other photo shoppers. I really didn’t make that many. One of these photoshops Stan mentions, is the one of “Robbert and me together”. As an old FOK veteran (because these photoshops do exist) I knew of course, which one he meant and I still have some of those pictures as well. At that time, like I am doing now, I tended to store files. Doing some research if he has things right, is not one of Stan’s assets.\n\nTranslation: “Robbert is once again corny, but of course, nobody sees it like that. You were allowed to photoshop for years, like the one with you and Robbert together, biggest silliness, that is considered healthy, but all jokes of Robbert are “sick”. What a joke.”\n\nStan nevertheless found it a nice excuse to send me neutral (?) photoshops (via) his own mailbox regularly, but also rather unpleasant ones and sometimes clips of me.\n\nA photoshop that I received recently, but not directly via Stan, was a very vulgar one about alien sex with dildos and me and my book Through The Gate figuring. I received this from “Micha Romijn” who said he had it from Stan, but later corrected it in Sven (Stan’s brother). Six days before, I had received video clips from Stan about the fact that he bought my book Through The Gate and had put it under his pillow.11 I did not mention this on my Twitter Genverbrander10 account, but suddenly “Micha” mailed me with it (and I already linked him to Stan, above). I did upload the clips to the Genverbrander Google Drive.\n\n* Received all these clips via mailbox Robbert van den Broeke *\n\nRobbert van den Broeke, Hating again, May 8, 2017 (English caps by me)\n\nReceived: May 8, 2017\n\nRobbert van den Broeke Message to Constantia About Joran van Der Sloot\n\nReceived: May 9, 2017\n\nRobbert van den Broeke Very Angry With Constantia – Part I and II\n\nReceived: May 28, 2017\n\nStan, Rens Hendriks and the scientific research of Gerding and Van Egmond.\n\nListen from about 2:30 minutes (Dutch only)\n\nStan: “Look, Rens Hendriks, that’s also the man of whom Robbert received the divine gift …. but if he (Robbert) really gets into his divinity, then his brain activity is eliminated, and that’s how it was measured at Rens’s too. […]. And later, two people Hans and Klaas came, Hans Gerding and Klaas van Egmond […]. Hans and Klaas who have also done brain research on Robbert […] and they have admitted. ..] that Robbert was also brain death, just like Rens Hendriks […]. “\n\nStan is letting the cat out of the bag with the names of two well-known scientists and former professors, Klaas van Egmond and Hans Gerding, who had done scientific research into Robbert in the fairly distant past and would have concluded by an EEG measurement that Robbert van den Broeke was braindead during his mediumship. For years, both Robbert and Stan referred to this mysterious investigation, but never mentioned names before and nobody knew the good of it. Robbert van den Broeke’s patron Nancy Talbott also always was very eager in spreading the “scientific good news” about Robbert and, where possible, did a lot of advertising for Robbert by mentioning the “fact” he was investigated by serious scientists as Dr. Roll and further unnamed persons which would have resulted in spectacular findings.\n\nThe two scientists in question apparently had no reason to see the results coming out. Pepijn van Erp, who, like me, followes the Van den Broeke case fairly close and had heard about this “famous” research earlier on as well, picked up on this sound clip from Stan and devoted an article on Kloptdatwel.nl to it with a sharp observation in his closing sentence, namely that the Robbert van den Broeke saga needs to be unveiled step by step. Thanks to the mediation of Fred Melssen, who has been very valuable to me in this case for a couple of years now, Pepijn van Erp was able to quote them on this so-called braindead event of Robbert van den Broeke and they said no such thing as “braindead” had occurred . Stan then responded with: “They’re lying!” And “The Donders Institute is going to investigate Robbert”.\n\nWhen I opened the book of Robbert van den Broeke again, searching for passages about Rens Hendriks, I found countless. They all express their great admiration for Rens; That Rens had saved Robbert from the mental institute and was sending Robbert “powerful energies” through the astral realm. When I read the book in 2005, I put comments in pencil everywhere and my eyes caught this page and underlined sentences:\n\nTranslation: “Rens Hendriks says that God wants to be human again to be more present in creation. He wants to be in everybody, even in criminals, to achieve that goal.”\n\nThis statement did outset a full chorus of bells in my brain, because it exactly matches the ideas of Robbert and Stan, that criminals should be forgiven and that they mostly should get a lot of love. For example, look at this passage about Joran van der Sloot on Robbert’s website, and there were several other moments like these when Robbert and Stan talk(ed) about criminals:\n\nThe question that comes to my mind is: if Rens Hendriks was really (as) clairvoyant as stated numerous time in Robbert’s book and elsewhere, why then could he not foresee that Robbert would derail completely in the future? And what has been the effect of him “sending power” to Robbert van den Broeke? Given the thoughts for example on “God and criminals” of Rens Hendriks as mentioned in this book, I wonder how and to what extend Robbert and Stan are really inspired by Rens.\n\nNancy Talbott’s setback and death Sandra Reemer\n\n…\n\nAlso in this year, there were new setbacks in Robbert van den Broeke’s life, namely the fact that at the end of March 2017 his American promotor Nancy Talbott was affected by cerebral hemorrhage and is now rehabilitating. He made it known on April 1, 2017. And another important Dutch guardian, Sandra Reemer, well-known from television and music, died on June 6, 2017. Robbert wrote about it on June 12, 2017. However, this did not prevent Robbert from sending me a all kinds of weird emails, exactly in these days too (See hate mail charts) and informing his Facebook followers about various “paranormal events” like crop grass circles with “felt presences” of Martin Luther King and Princess Juliana” and light orbs.\n\nFootnotes\n\n[1] Some of the police filers are mentioned by name, for example in (Dutch): – Medium Robbert van den Broeke ontkent versturen gruwelijke foto’s en bedreigingen, Omroep Brabant, 19 januari 2015 And more:\n\n– Het medium en de haatmails, BN De Stem, 2 maart, 2016\n\n– Liesbeth van Dijk, Facebook, 7 juli 2015\n\n– Medium Robbert van den Broeke opgepakt voor doodsbedreigingen: ‘Ik snijd je keel door’, Omroep Brabant\n\n– Robbert van den Broekes arrestatie en wat daaraan vooraf ging Constantia Oomen, 16 januari 2016\n\n[2] Colin Andrews has devoted several short and long articles to Robbert van den Broeke.

This coincides with the fact that Stan, who (together with Alan, nowadays: Alan …) spent one year in Malaga, has returned to the Netherlands and is, once again, united with his “brother-in-arms” Robbert. In February 2016, when the Robbert van den Broeke-Stan leaked hate-speech about Irene Moors and myself caused a lot of negative publicity, Dutch soil became too hot for Stan. After all, both men were officially suspects in the Robbert van den Broeke threat mail case. The whole “shebang” has thus again erupted in all severity. The mails and clips about Joran van der Sloot and Leydi Figueroa Uceda, who allegedly is impregnated by Robbert van den Broeke, are the latest new “acquisitions” for the Google Genverbrander Drive. I also received that from Robbert and Stan directly. I plan to publish an update soon.\n\nDe Google Genverbrander Drive contains:\n\nHatemail (at viewer’s discretion: gross pics and language)\n\nReceived video clips of Robbert van den Broeke and Stan (a lot from 2017)\n\nReceived audio of Stan (and Robbert van den Broeke) (a lot from 2017)\n\nJoran van der Sloot (jail) photos and letters etc.. (sent to me by Robbert van den Broeke and Stan)\n\nSome crucial media clips featuring Robbert van den Broeke (and Stan)\n\nAnd more!\n\nWhat happened in the second half of 2015 and up till now in January 2016? Robbert van den Broeke and buddies haven’t disappeared. Well, in fact they have, to be precise, crossed the line yet again, and have sunk even further, as if that were possible. Because, remember, they already had sunk so low. In a nutshell, I will reveal my mailbox concerning Robbert van den Broeke, and I will try to update you about what happened in the big, bad world of Robbert.\n\nAfter the second hack on July 5, 2015 it did not remain silent for long. Stan found it necessary to email me again several times with the usual spiritual woo woo, and Robbert too showed signs of life with new hate mail that proved Rob Nanninga was still bothering his troubled digestion so much, of course interspersed with appropriate stool pictures.\n\nTwo days after the deceased Rob Nanninga’s birthday an article was published in “BN De Stem” with the sonorous title: “Who still believes Robbert van den Broeke (35) and his Hoeven crop circles? ‘We feel something ‘”. Robbert and / or friends thought it was very funny to post comments in the name of Rob Nanninga, who supposedly spoke from the other side in the comment section below this article. The comments were as always in the same style as their hate mail, abysmal as always, and when “BN De Stem” did not respond immediately, I received a triumphant email from Robbert delighting himself in the fact “BN De Stem” did not remove these comments:\n\nTranslation (all language sloppiness of Robbert van den Broeke emails lies with RvdB): “BN VOICE lets the ridiculous gore reaction of little Rob Nanninga stand about getting sick behind his computer and fainting away You do know they enjoy this Satan”\n\nBut Robert and buddies miscalculated, because “BN De Stem” had only waited for a while but then did respond. All comments were removed and the comment field below the text was suddenly empty again.\n\nRobbert at “Finding Voices Radio”\n\nRobbert appeared on the radio show of Jeroen Ghuijs of “Finding Voices” and this could be heard live. I remembered this and on that day briefly looked at Robbert’s and Jeroen Ghuijs’s website, and yes, fell right in the middle of the broadcast (though I had missed the first hour of the interview). Since there was a chat room available (which was packed with enthusiastic Robbert followers), I decided to go find my voice and expressed some critical words in that chat box, with the request to Jeroen G if he wanted to ask Robbert about his hacker. Jeroen G did it (probably he would have regretted it later), and what followed was an embarrassing defense of Robbert in which he again blamed the hacker and nursed a grievance for me not blocking him. The good and ethereal vibes of the radio broadcast were disrupted by my critical notes and Robbert dwelled on it, so Jeroen G audibly started to get a little nervous. People in the chat started attacking me and later on began to call on to each other to ignore me. Meanwhile, the technician of the broadcast was busy trying to find out how he could lock me out of the chat box, in which he eventually succeeded.\n\nThis broadcast is online (I don’t know if this will last) (without the chatbox’s history), I’ll share the link on the moment Jeroen Ghuijs is looking backwards where on screen he notices my question about the hacker in the chatbox.\n\nAn interesting sideline developed from this broadcast. Jeroen Ghuijs presented himself in the same interview as an IT expert with 30 years experience and offered to clean and secure Robbert’s PC. I had listened to this statement – given the apocryphal story about Robbert’s ‘hacker’, but also with a question mark about the IT knowledge of Jeroen Ghuijs – with some feelings of irony, which later turned out to be justified. Only five days after Jeroen Ghuijs had informed via Twitter that Robbert was ‘clean’ in terms of his PC, I again received hate mail.\n\nThe weeks, months afterwards show the same picture: Jeroen Ghuijs went to Robbert’s home few times to fix Robbert’s PC, but the hate mail continued, and Jeroen Ghuijs kept believing in Robbert and co’s innocence, and even published a clip on December 3, 2015 specifically about the “hacker” in which Robbert and he accused me of taunting Robbert (see clip) and of “harassment” on Twitter (about 10. 34 minutes). Jeroen Ghuijs was grossly exaggerating when he said he was harassed for weeks via Twitter. I have always given fair criticism, never harassed or bullied, I never hit below the belt, I only posted when something happened. As for Jeroen Ghuijs, I really did not contact him very often via Twitter or in any other way.\n\nStan’s role in all this is, at least to myself , is very obvious, not a “maybe” but a “surely”. Every time the hacker was active, he was down on it like a flash, and I mean down on it like a flash like within minutes in order to e-mail me under his own name, to warn that the hacker had struck again, often in the middle of the Dutch night. His lifestyle was and is fully in line with that of the ‘hacker’, as a 24/7 Robbert monitor in the form of Stan is not really realistic, but a “hacker” and Stan as (partially) one, is much more probable, the more since they exhibit remarkable similarity.\n\nStan abandoned all caution and blandly started mailing me through Robbert’s mailbox. He sent me lewd emails via his own mailbox but also through the mailbox of Robbert in which he said he wanted to have sex with me. He sent a picture of an erect genitalia he claimed was his and what I was ‘allowed’ to do with it. These mails he, or anyone, never explained as being of the ‘hacker’ or indeed his own. He also did not deny having sent them. Boundaries between the ‘hacker’, Robbert and Stan (and to a much lesser extent Alan, who sometimes sent hate mail) faded more and more. They fancied themselves untouchable, and who sent what from which email address, became less important. They would surely insist that the “hacker” was omnipotent.\n\nI find myself tending to write in the past tense now. Here’s why. This morning, January 14, 2016 (I’ve written this blog on on three consecutive days) somebody mailed me about Robbert’s site being off air with the notification that due to circumstances,it was no longer active and all lectures were canceled. Robberts last reading in January was scheduled at a center called Itaka but was canceled already, and in Robbert van den Broeke’s 2015 Christmas Lecture I had seen a Robbert who seemed to be worn out. He cried a little at two moments during his lecture, somewhere in the middle and at the end. To live in a hateful and morbid surrounding with bad friends while you yourself are already mentally at risk, is no easy task and now has taken its toll. But first let me get on with the rest of the update.\n\nThe hate mail had become even worse than before. Suddenly the death threats were a lot more concrete when Robbert & co started talking about (three) assassins. I tweeted about this in some detail. That they named the still missing and probably killed M Geurts, I found very strange.\n\nAndy Russell too was threatened with an assassin; I found out through Andy himself. Mails that they were hacked again, came for the umpteenth time and at the same time mails of the ‘hacker’ were being sent. Also Robbert himself emailed me now (but it would have been Stan); patterns began to change clearly.\n\nTranslation screenshot: (language mistakes Robbert’s)\n\n“Gladly I eat your brain when you are strangled I then feel powerful when I poop you out”\n\n“Dear Constantia,\n\nI see that the hacker now goes a long way and turns into real threats. We think he is in between WiFi. Why did you not block me? We asked for several times. You need at least not be afraid it’s true, nothing happens to you. I find it very annoying what happens.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nRobbert”\n\nBesides hate, Stan was sending me remarkable declarations of love:\n\n“I am not the hacker, it’s me stan and I have a big crush on you”\n\nI kept getting strange emails, more concrete, about Robbert buying animals then crushing them, Robbert walking about cemeteries and hospitals to do very bad things (I’m not going to repeat here), and to summarize: the nature of the mails had sunk so low as I previously had not thought possible. Perhaps one example, but I post this with great reluctance, just to give an impression, so you do not have to rely on my words alone about how bad it was getting:\n\n“desecration\n\nI just got crapped on a grave they will find my waste tomorrow I pooped on grave of man with cancer lung cancer I find myself strengthened ne by SATAN I get Horny proud feeling in return I got the picture of rob again printed out and stuck in the toilet target girl I will Get you I still have Murder Hate towards you constantia”\n\nBut every time I thought I had seen it all, they managed to come up with something new. More and more people were involved and a number of (famous) Dutch(wo)men were now also threatened. They previously had threatened Liesbeth van Dijk (see earlier in this blog), who became re-victim. But also Rinke Jacobs, Albert Verlinde, Emile Ratelband and his biographer Henk Verhaeren, Bert Brussen and Viola Holt fell prey to the sick games of Robbert and co. Albert Verlinde was only threatened in emails to me, but the others were harassed on their Facebook page by the same threats and gory pictures I always received.\n\nA new low was reached when I received Robbert’s nude photos through the mail and saw the same nude photos appear on his Facebook and that of Viola Holt’s.\n\n“Awake coffee newspaper, sabia not pregnant, baby lost again, for the 3rd time?\n\nMartine Bijl again refurbishing, that’s nice, and then scared out of my wits because of an ugly nude here on my fb page, which I do not get away, apparently the page of robbert van den broeke has been hacked because I do not believe that the real would do this, immediately reported of course!”\n\nThis was preceded on December 4, 2015 when I received an email from Robbert with the following text:\n\n“Come to me sweetie constantia I have become straight”\n\nThis email was accompanied by an authentic photograph of Robbert van den Broeke bare-chested.\n\nOn 11 and December 16, 2015, I then received complete nude pictures of Robbert in his own house in two different positions with alarming screenshots of the Facebook page of Viola Holt.\n\nImmediately afterwards, I was, like always, mailed by Stan who warned me that the hacker had struck again and that they would sue me if I would publish the nude pictures of Robbert. I would never do so, I have always been aware of the fact that Robbert van den Broeke is not well mentally and I in fact pity him, in spite of everything. Even if someone would do something like that having their wits together, (hate mailing, sending nude photos), I still would not publish these nude pictures. But what I had expected, Stan did exactly: he claimed that Robbert van den Broeke would never embarrass himself by placing wimpy nude pictures on his own Facebook and elsewhere . This was the ultimate proof and excuse that Robbert had a real hacker! Nobody in their right mind would do such a thing anyway?\n\nAnd that’s precisely it, Robbert van den Broeke, Stan and other friends: you are not in your right mind. That is my belief, and that is why I don’t take this argument seriously too. Stan had previously demonstrated very dubious practices to save ‘friends in need’, read: Joran van der Sloot and he blackmailed a man with alleged child pornography on his computer, to help Joran get money. Stan then claimed that he obviously never seriously had planned to go through with this…\n\nI imagine Stan figured that now something drastic had to be done to save Robbert’s face: the “hacker” would strike in such a low way it would become obvious that Robbert Robbert and friends would never ever do! Do something like that themselves. Many people would fall easily for this mindset , I guess. I still think Robbert sometimes hatemailed himself (the rather primitive hate mail in primitive language, see Gang & Snake) and his “friends” joined in later, to sow confusion and to divert attention from Robbert. Later on, this gang around him became the lead in all this mischief and made serious abuse of Robbert’s weaknesses.\n\nThere are facts about the nude photos that make a ‘hacker’ story even less credible. I quote Fred Melssen, who helped me in the past half year to understand the technical data of Robbert van den Broeke (& co) photos and mails. He and another expert analyzed the headers of Robbert’s emails (Technical investigation of ‘being hacked’ claim by Robbert van den Broeke )\n\n“The nude with erection is made with a Sony DSC-RX100 camera, on December 4, 2015 (5:18 pm) . Apparently, immediately thereafter this picture was placed on the PC. And the same day “stolen and “abused”. It does seem awkward one would take such a photo and place it on their PC when they know it is constantly being “hacked”? That photo is from a series of several photos, taken around the same time and also placed on the PC, for these photos also appeared by mail and social media.”\n\nThe hate mails kept on coming, every day(see the hate mail charts above). How this could be a hacker, time and time again, was virtually impossible. How likely is it, that for subsequently three years quite often and then even on a daily basis in 2015 (and 2016) are hacked, and you do nothing about it, even if someone warns you? And why would Robbert save nude photos on his own troubled PC, so the hacker could steal them, not once, but many times, as quickly as he put them on his PC?\n\nIn the meantime (December 6, 2015), Pepijn van Erp was threatened again, in a Robbert email to me. A whole group was being harassed now.\n\nEmile Ratelband then filed a police claim without mentioning Robbert’s name. RTL Boulevard reports:\n\nI knew immediately that it was about Robbert, because Robbert and co had mentioned Emile Ratelband’s name in one of their recent e-mails to me.\n\n“Satan is at work\n\nYou’re bored hey stan and I have hacked the mobile phones of the editorial staff of Shownews they send each other threats now ha ha it’s true really I intensely enjoy now there are going to be fatalities there mark my words Emile Ratelband has sent silly text messages today because of us about his bunnies and about me ha ha ha”\n\nI had brief contact with Emile, but I noticed that he has deleted his post on Facebook about the police report. On his Twitter it’s still there:\n\n“Just reported to the police”\n\nHere’s a part of our Facebook chat:\n\n“E R: Today, I supposedly had threatened to destroy Ans Markus’s paintings\n\nCO: Whoa, are they on it again? I guess I will receive things again soon. It is crystal clear they themselves are doing this. Today I received a mail of RTL Boulevard…\n\nE R: What did it say?\n\nC O: Did they not contact you? They want to cover Robbert’s “spam” and thought maybe I could contribute to their story. Tomorrow maybe, I’ll call with one of their contributors.\n\nE R: I know nothing !! Good thing, you go tell them\n\nC O: They want to call soon. Maybe you can give me information about Robbert mails etc. what you want to share.\n\nE R: I’ll leave it up to the Police\n\nC O: Then you are sure nothing will happen. ;-)”\n\n(With that last sentence, I turned out to be wrong, see the conclusion of this update)\n\nThe ever resourceful Robbert crew, moreover, had discovered a new ploy. People using false senders, sending disturbing e-mails and text messages, it’s all possible, on (illegal?) Websites. You just fill out the name and address where the mail supposedly has to come from and to whom you want to send it to, et voilà, you get people from SBS6 Shownieuws suddenly sending hateful (?) emails to each other. I asked SBS6 Shownieuws whether it was true, but received no response, tweet.\n\nIn December 2015 I had opened a new Twitter account, the Genverbrander10, referring to the 10 years of Robbert van den Broeke still being active after being unmasked as a fraud by skeptic Rob Nanninga. This happened in the infamous broadcast of Irene Moors on December 18, 2005 in “There’s so much more.”\n\nThe more and more I thought about it, the more I concluded how not nice it was, to have to compromise my own Twitter account with negative messages about Robbert van den Broeke and pals, because no matter how you looked at it, it looked dirty. Since there was a “jubilee” now, I finally figured out (let’s say, better late than never) that it would be a good idea to create a separate account. Exactly one week before Robberts’ “Genverbrander jubilee “, I opened the new account:\n\nSo consequently there now was, besides the original Genverbrander Twitter account of skeptic Pepijn van Erp, Genverbrander10, my own account, and “Genverbrander” and “Genverbrander10” on December 18th, 2015 ‘congratulated’ each other over each other’s birthday:\n\nTo give an impression of all the hate mail I received in December 2015 and January 2016, I provide screenshots with the subjects and a phrase of the content (if there is a paper clip, it means there are terrible photos attached) – you can open it by clicking on the picture, which will open in a new window:\n\nOn January 12, 2016, I was suddenly for one day denied access to my account Genverbrander10:\n\nRobbert van den Broeke, Stan and their crew (who else, seriously?) had spammed Twitter that my account was in violation of their rules. I received no reasoning from Twitter, no opportunity to respond, I just had to sit out my “punishment”. Stan, in my view, in a show of force, mailed me that he had nothing against me and that he would mail Twitter that it was okay. First ensure that my account is locked and then ensure that it unlocked again, uh, yes, Stan, that is the typical Stan way of doing a favor…\n\n“I have nothing against you, I will let twitter know it’s okay.”\n\nThen suddenly there was that moment, the message on Roberts website:\n\n“Dear visitor. Due to circumstances, this website is now closed. All scheduled lectures are cancelled too. Thank you for understanding.”\n\nThe preliminary end of an era, the ferryman who’s finally demanding his toll of Robbert van den Broeke and co? I was already wondering: who can stand this, years of sending hate mail and threatening people, visit hateful sites and deal with false friends, to eat into your own, already fragile psychic structure? I consider it possible that Robbert van den Broeke is actually insane, and he is getting more and more out of it when he really does not know what he’s doing. However, I think he definitely realizes that he is sailing in dubious waters.\n\nIn his most recent Christmas lecture, he talked about that afternoon, that he went to the toilet at a quarter to three, and when he returned to his bed and looked at the clock, suddenly it was half past four. This fragment also shows very clearly that Robbert especially is awake at night and sleeps in late. This lifestyle is fully in line with the times of the “hacker” who sends hate mail, especially at night, Dutch time. And it turns out that Robbert does not seem to have control over his life.\n\nI made a little transcription of it, I found it interesting enough:\n\nRobbert van den Broeke during Christmas Lecture 2015:\n\n“(Time: 1:12) It may be that when people will soon go home, they go through crazy things – not frightening things, but beautiful things. It may be that you find time differences.\n\nThis morning I have experienced something very strange – or, this afternoon! Perhaps some people now have to laugh, I myself had a little laugh, because I thought it was really weird. I really mean this, I swear it on my life.\n\nI came, today I knew I had to give the lecture, and I was in bed and I woke up. And I looked at my watch beside me and I saw, oh, it’s a quarter to three. I think: Oh, uh, I believe that I have to pee, and I’m going to get out there, and I’m going to the bathroom, pee. I peed, I blew my nose, and I came back to the kitchen … and I see that it half past four.\n\nDo you get it yet? Not me. And then I thought: na ja, well, there’s something wrong with that clock, so I walk into my bedroom: half past four. You may know, I’ve even gone to the bathroom to see if there was blood on the floor, or maybe I had become unwell, had fallen, and had lain there a few hours. But that was not the case.\n\nI do not get it, but hey, I had to learn to accept that you can not understand this. But it has to do with other dimensions … Scientifically speaking, it can not be true. But I really mean this, I’ve been through this. Are there people in the room who sometimes have experienced such a thing? (Time: 1.13: 28)”\n\nHe had no idea how that could be, at least he claimed, he blamed it on the “other dimensions”. If he didn’t lie, or in general does not always lie, it means that Robbert van den Broeke, as in his book already mentioned, sometimes does not know what happened. This could be the definition ‘of unsound mind’.\n\nI do not know whether Stan is (sometimes / regularly / often) ‘of unsound mind’. These things should be determined by mental health specialists.\n\nToday, January 15, 2016, I received the message that Robbert van den Broeke has been arrested by the police. He has spent six days in custody, the maximum time they can hold somebody in the Netherlands at the first arrest. Finally! I think I am allowed to let out a sigh of relief. He has been in prison for six days. (At least) Six people have filed against him, namely: skeptic Jan Willem Nienhuys, ‘medium’ Liesbeth van Dijk, mentalist Rinke Jacobs, Positivity Guru Emile Ratelband, Henk Verhaeren and writer Bert Brussen. My own report in the Netherlands unfortunately never got off the ground, because I was not on Dutch territory. Additionally, possibly two other people named William and Johan (this I found out through one of Stan’s mails, I do not know whom this refers to or if it’s true).\n\nIn the days when Robert was in jail, I still received a couple of hate mails. This is hardly contrary to what I’ve said on this blog since the beginning; I’ve always thought and said that I think that others are involved and perhaps even mainly Stan and co.\n\nWhat has caused Robbert van den Broeke’s fall? Yet the Ferryman? * He does not want to sail up and down that dark water forever, he wants to be free, the heavy services left him jaded and exhausted. I just hope the police will have an especially good look at Stan. Robbert was not alone in this, far from it.\n\n* View this broadcast when you have the time and inclination: The Storyteller, The Luck Child. “And Nature, my dears, is a wise woman who pays us back, tit for tat.”\n\nMy conclusion still is: Robbert van den Broeke is a psychic crook, but after the “Genverbrander” he became a plaything in the hands of even worse criminal friends (this kind of grading is hard!).\n\nTwo Skype audio tapes were leaked to journalists and people involved, containing disturbing hate speeches of Robbert van den Broeke talking to Stan. Two main topics: me and Irene Moors. This Skype audio exhibits the language that I know so well from the ‘hacker’: gross death threats, insanity and badmouthing. The number of (hate)mails I have received so far from the whole Robbert van den Broeke gang now stands at 934 emails.\n\nRobbert van den Broeke confessed to these hate speech Skype audios. The investigation into him and Stan as the two main suspects is in full swing. I already know more, but I can’t tell yet.\n\nAudio coverage Omroep Brabant (Dutch)\n\nMedium Robbert van den Broeke confesses to audio-hate-speech: ‘God is punishing Irene Moors’ (Dutch)\n\nWith permission of: BN de Stem, John Bas, Wednesday, March 2, 2016:\n\nThe medium and the hate mail (Dutch) RvdB1, RvdB2, RvdB3\n\n* Thank you, Chris Pert, for language assistance *"
