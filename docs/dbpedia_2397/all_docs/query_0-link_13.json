        "text": "Will Burns is back with his picks for the Eredivisie for this Sunday’s games and like all his tips, you will not see a ‘best bet’ under evens – good luck!\n\nSunday 23rd February\n\nFC UTRECHT vs. FC GRONINGEN (11:30 GMT)\n\nHow many weeks now have I been writing that Jan Wouters is under pressure? This weekend means no different when FC Groningen visit the Stadion Galgenwaard.\n\nAlthough, Utrecht have defeated Groningen their last five home matches against them in all competitions, I cannot see Wouters’ leading them to a victory today. The hosts have yet to win a game in 2014 and their last win came in a 2-0 away win at Cambuur in December.\n\nHowever, Groningen have not win away in five games but ended five games without a win last weekend hosting Go Ahead Eagles. Look for Erwin van de Looi to lead his side to another win on Sunday morning and at 11/5, the price offered by Bet Victor, this is bet that cannot be ignored.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: FC Groningen to win (11/5 – BetVictor) – Click here to bet on this market and receive up to £25 in free bets.\n\nAJAX vs. AZ ALKMAAR (13:30 GMT)\n\nAfter suffering a humiliating and demoralising 3-0 defeat in Europe this week at the hands of Red Bull Salzburg, Frank de Boer has the task of motivating Ajax to a win against AZ Alkmaar at the Amsterdam Arena on Sunday afternoon.\n\nDe Boer’s men were run ragged by Salzburg whose high defensive line and ultra-pressure did not give Ajax time to think on Thursday. Although, Ajax have found their game in ten wins of their last 12 Eredivisie matches, however, the Amsterdammers were held to a 2-2 home draw to AZ last season.\n\nAZ Alkmaar hope not to be suffering from the travel to the Czech Republic on Thursday where they picked up in a late 1-0 win against Slovan Liberec. How will Thursday’s defeat affect Ajax’s play and AZ’s tactics is set to be seen on Sunday come kick off? Last week’s hat-trick hero Lasse Schone is out with ankle ligament injury for an unknown time and he will be a big miss to the hosts. I think 7/2 at Betfair for a draw in this game looks too good to miss here.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Draw (7/2 – Betfair) – Click here to bet on this market.\n\nVITESSE vs. RKC WAALWIJK (13:30 GMT)\n\nPeter Bosz’s Vitesse were flying-high before the winter break but the Arnhem side are currently experiencing a run of five games without a win, gaining just two points from a possible fifteen. On Sunday, they face the visit of RKC Waalwijk who are fighting for their lives just two points off the drop zone.\n\nThere has been Under 2.5 Goals in the last five Vitesse games but Bosz’s men need to pick up points soon if they wish to catch Ajax, who are seven points clear. I think Vitesse will win and there will be goals. Also, RKC are well capable of notching with 12 goals in the last six games so I see Over 3.5 Goals as the best bet in this game.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Over 3.5 Goals (23/20 – Bet365) – Click here to bet on this market and get up to £200 in free bets.\n\nFC TWENTE vs. FEYENOORD (15:30 GMT)\n\nThe main event of the weekend is a true six pointer at the De Grolsch Veste as second play third when Twente host Feyenoord. Michel Jansen’s men are three points clear of their opponents in second, which earns a spot in the Champions League qualifying round and with 10 games left to play, this game proves vital for both sides.\n\nThe Enschede outfit have been defeated just one of their last 13 matches in the league, a 3-2 loss at PSV on February 8th, and will take some confidence from Feyenoord’s record of having won just two of their last five. Twente celebrated a 4-1 victory when the sides met in Rotterdam earlier in the season, and will see this as a pivotal week in their campaign as they bid to reduce the four-point deficit to leaders Ajax.\n\nUndefeated at home this season, the odds weigh in the favour of Twente in this clash, but Ronald Koeman’s Feyenoord are in good away form clinching ten points from a possible fifteen. It is make or break for both sides today and I cannot pick a winner but with two most potent attacks in the Eredivisie this game promises goals. Let’s get on Over 3.5 Goals for the bet and enjoy watching this one.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Over 3.5 Goals (31/20 – BetVictor)\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nAjax pulled four points clear of second-placed FC Twente thanks to a Lasse Schöne hat-trick in the 3-0 win over Heerenveen. Down at the bottom, Cambuur gained a vital 3-1 over Zwolle as title-chasing Feyenoord were held to a draw away to NAC Breda.\n\nSunday 16th February 2014\n\nSC CAMBUUR 3-1 PEC ZWOLLE\n\nSome atrocious defending from Ron Jans’ PEC Zwolle cost them as Cambuur clinched yet another win at home to lift them out of the bottom three.\n\nIt was an excellent first half for Dwight Lodeweges’s side who found themselves two goals to the good at the break. The first came after just nine minutes with Austrian midfielder Marcel Ritzmaier scoring with an excellent chip. Mohamed El Makrini picked up the ball in midfield and spotted Ritzmaier running down the left wing. The midfielder, on-loan from PSV, received the pass and skipped past Giovanni Gravenbeek to run through on goal. Zwolle goalkeeper Diederik Boer rushed out to close Ritzmaier down, but the Austrian delicately lobbed the ball into the empty net. The Cambuur Stadion erupted in delight as Ritzmaier celebrated with teammates at the corner flag.\n\nZwolle could not find their rhythm against the relentless and resilient hosts and five minutes before half-time the lead was doubled. Again, the defending from the visitors was awful. Jody Lukoki had plenty time to float in a cross from the right-wing with Martijn Barto and Elvis Manu queuing in the box to attack. Unmarked Manu failed to get his shot off and as Zwolle’s Bram van Polen and Joost Broerse unsuccessfully cleared the ball, Barto finished with ease. Jans was not happy on the bench obviously getting psyched up for his team-talk at the interval.\n\nIt could have been worse for the visitors a few minutes before the break after a good Cambuur counter attack. However, Ritzmaier lacked composure this time round and blasted his effort over the crossbar when he was one-on-one with Boer.\n\nUnfortunately for Zwolle’s travelling fans, the trip did not get any better in the second half. Six minutes in, Broerse’s nightmare continued only half clearing a corner with a weak header and the ball landed to the feet of Barto again. The striker, who was told by Lodeweges he was surplus to requirements in January, did not hesitate and hit a first time volley past Boer to make it three and will not two easier goals in the Eredivisie.\n\nThere was time for the away side to get a consolation goal with Polish midfielder Mateusz Klich notching on the edge of the box on 78 minutes.\n\nOnce again, Cambuur proved they can hold their own in this league and with such an encouraging performance one has to think they should add more pressure to Jon Dahl Tomasson next Saturday. The Dane brings his Roda side to the Cambuurstadion in a vital relegation battle, as today’s victors, Cambuur will look for victory again to retain their status in the Eredivisie.\n\nTEAMS\n\nCAMBUUR: Nienhuis, Leeuwin, Van der Laan, Droste, El Makrini, Bakker (Van Moorsel 83), Ritzmaier, Bijker, Barto (Christovao 90+3), Lukoki (Schepers 73), Manu.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Zeinstra, Van Boxel, Pereira, Dijkstra.\n\nGOALS: Ritzmaier 9, Barto 40, 51.\n\nBOOKINGS: Lukoki 66, El Makrini 70.\n\nZWOLLE: Boer, Van Polen, Broerse (Pereira 73), Van Hintum, Klich, Gravenbeek (Van der Werff 45), Karagounis, Saymak, Thomas, Fernandez (Mahmudov 46), Drost.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Begois, Nijland, Hiwat, Patricio.\n\nGOALS: Klich 78.\n\nBOOKINGS: Broerse 10, Van Polen 66, Karagounis 70.\n\nNAC BREDA 1-1 FEYENOORD\n\nAfter missing various chances in front of goal, Feyenoord lost some ground in the title race after being held 1-1 at NAC Breda.\n\nAfter an impressive start, Ronald Koeman’s men took the lead with a well taken goal from right-back Daryl Janmaat on 25 minutes. The Dutch international received the ball on the right-wing and looked to have played the ball on the edge of the box to Lex Immers. Immers dodged the ball as Janmaat continued his run into the area; Graziano Pellè collected the ball and laid it into the path of the full-back who finished beautifully with his left boot.\n\nJust before the break, against the run of play, NAC drew level with a spot-kick. After Anouar Hadouir had smashed a shot against the bar, Feyenoord defender Miquel Nelom handballed Danny Verbeek’s rebound shot and referee Bas Nijhuis pointed to the spot. Rydell Poepon sent Erwin Mulder the wrong way with the resulting penalty.\n\nAs the game went on NAC goalkeeper Jelle ten Rouwelaar became the man of the match saving everything Feyenoord could throw at him. The keeper saved a great unexpected point for his side which they were lucky to hold on to especially when substitute Stipe Perica was sent off for a challenge on Janmaat late on.\n\nFeyenoord stay in third but are now seven points off leaders Ajax while Breda are 10th six points clear of the relegation battle.\n\nTEAMS\n\nNAC: Ten Rouwelaar, De Roover, Drost, Buijs, Van der Weg, Gilissen, Matic, Hadouir (Perica 81), Sarpong (Kwakman 86), Poepon, Verbeek (Tighadouini 71).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Babos, Suk, Swerts, Bodor.\n\nGOALS: Poepon 37P.\n\nBOOKINGS: Matic 40.\n\nSENT OFF: Perica 84.\n\nFEYENOORD: Mulder, Janmaat, De Vrij, Kongolo, Nelom (Te Vrede 85), Clasie, Immers, Vilhena, Armenteros (Schaken 67), Pellè, Boëtius (Goossens 82).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Graafland, Mathijsen, Bakkal, Van Beek.\n\nGOALS: Janmaat 25.\n\nBOOKINGS: Nelom 36, Immers 62, Vilhena 88, Pellè 90+5.\n\nFC GRONINGEN 1-0 GO AHEAD EAGLES\n\nGroningen finally clinched their first win of 2014 with a narrow 1-0 win over Go Ahead Eagles.\n\nThe hosts gained the win by a Tjarron Chery goal surrounded in controversy after just three minutes. From the edge of the area, Chery fired into the bottom corner that gave Eagles keeper Stephan Andersen had no chance of saving. Video replays showed that due to disgraceful state of the penalty area, the ball took a wicked bounce over the goalie’s palm when it looked like the Danish keeper had it covered.\n\nEagles pressed for an equaliser with Denis Türüç being the main oracherstrator for any Go Ahead chance by Marco Bizot had a good day in goal and kept a clean sheet and all three points for his side.\n\nTEAMS\n\nGRONINGEN: Bizot, Hateboer, Botteghin, Kappelhof, Burnet, Kieftenbeld (Lindgren 83), Adorjan (Zeefuik 62), Van Nieff, Chery, De Leeuw, Kostic.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Van der Lei, Hiarlej, Wijnaldum, Kirm, Zivkovic.\n\nGOALS: Chery 3.\n\nBOOKINGS: Kieftenbeld 73.\n\nGO AHEAD: Andersen, Vriends, Van der Linden, Schenk (Haps 72), Overgoor (Rijsdijk 77), Türüç, Kolder, Houtkoop (Antonia 62), Schmidt, Falkenburg, Godée.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Ter Mate, Amevor, Azevedo, Lambooij\n\nGOALS: None.\n\nBOOKINGS: Schmidt 26, Overgoor 50.\n\nAJAX 3-0 HEERENVEEN\n\nDanish midfielder Lasse Schöne notched a hat-trick as Ajax saw off Marco van Basten’s Heerenveen to go four points clear at the top of Eredivisie. It was quite fitting that fellow Dane Christian Eriksen had returned to the Amsterdam ArenA with a hero’s welcome.\n\nThe Tottenham Hotspur star was given a standing ovation before the game by the Amsterdam fans, as Frank de Boer also said a few kind words about the player. Eriksen was not the only visitor on Sunday, as UEFA president Michel Platini was on hand to present Johan Cruyff with an award.\n\nThe hosts exploded out of the blocks and should have been ahead within just two minutes of play. A Schöne corner was fed to Niclas Moisander at the back post but the defender hit his shot against the post and out.\n\nThe defending champions thought they were 1-0 up on 6 minutes when Viktor Fischer finished a nice move by Schone but the young Dane was wrongly adjudged to being offside.\n\nAjax finally got ahead on 12 minutes when Joey van den Berg brought down Siem de Jong in the area and Lasse Schöne stepped up to score his first of three.\n\nThe Dane got his second penalty just four minutes later when referee Pol van Boekel penalised Stefano Marzo for a handball in the area. Schöne converted the spot-kick even though Heerenveen goalie Kristoffer Nordfeldt got a hand on it.\n\nAjax were very impressive and dominated throughout, so much so that Van Basten’s men failed to register a single shot on target within the 90 minutes.\n\nThe score was wrapped up with another Schöne with just eight minutes remaining, with fellow Dane Fischer stepping the hat-trick hero up.\n\nThis was a much improved performance from De Boer’s side and a performance fitting of defending champions. With Ajax being now four points clear and with no other side with games in hand, it’s looking more and more likely that De Boer will have his hands on a fourth consecutive Eredivisie championship.\n\nTEAMS\n\nAJAX: Cillessen, Van Rhijn, Veltman, Moisander, Boilesen (Poulsen 46), Klaassen, Blind, Serero (Duarte 58), Schöne, De Jong (Sigthórsson 72), Fischer.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Vermeer, Van der Hoorn,Bojan, De Sa.\n\nGOALS: Schone 12P, 18P, 82.\n\nBOOKINGS: Serero 21, Van Rhijn 48.\n\nHEERENVEEN: Nordfeldt, Marzo, Kum, Van den Berg (Van Aken 85), Van Anholt (Dijks 71), De Roon, De Kamps, Ziyech, Van La Parra (Lurling 67), Finnbogason, Basacikoglu.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Vandenbussche, Fazli, Sinkgraven, Warmolts.\n\nGOALS: None.\n\nBOOKINGS: Van der Berg 12, De Roon 20, Ziyech 34, Van Aken 86.\n\nSTANDINGS\n\nLeague table courtesy of FIFA.com\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nFC Twente defeated Vitesse to narrow the gap down between themselves and Eredivisie leaders Ajax to one point, albeit temporarily as Ajax are set to play Heerenveen on Sunday.\n\nSaturday 15th February 2014\n\nFC TWENTE 2-0 VITESSE\n\nFC Twente virtually eliminated Vitesse Arnhem from the Eredivisie title race with a dominating performance topped by great shows by Luc Castaignos and Dusan Tadić.\n\nTwente dominated the game throughout and Kelvin Leerdam, playing at right-back for Vitesse, did not make it easy for his team after just four minutes when he was shown a yellow for a foul on Quincy Promes. Leerdam was making his first appearance after serving a suspension.\n\nThe hosts should have taken the lead many times during the first-half but even more so on 13 minutes. Vitesse goalkeeper Piet Velthuizen passed the ball out of the box to Marko Vejinović, but the midfielder was under extensive pressure and the ball was stolen in a dangerous position by Luc Castaignos. The striker dished the ball out to Dušan Tadić, who returned the ball to Castaignos inside the area but the 21-year-old’s shot was straight at Velthuizen legs.\n\nThe attacks from Twente were relentless and Tadić nearly got on the scoresheet a minute later with a great low drive from the edge of the area but the shot was just wide much to Velthuizen’s relief. On 36 minutes, the Serbian was involved again. After some great link-up play between Tadić, Castaignos and Roberto Rosales ending with the Serb blasting a shot from close range but Velthuizen stayed strong and saved his side yet again.\n\nVitesse struggled to get involved and were restricted to just one shot on target within the game but Vejinović’s rare chance came close in the 37th minute. However, the midfielder’s strike from 35 yards out was inches wide of Nick Marsman’s left post.\n\nMichel Jansen must have been wondering how his side was not in the lead come the half-time whistle especially after missing a glorious chance three minutes before. Jan-Arie van der Heijden was caught in possession by Shadrach Eghan and the Ghanaian spotted a Kyle Ebecilio run in the area. Ebecilio was under pressure from Guram Kashia and the Georgian defender did just enough to direct the former Arsenal youth’ shot into Velthuizen’s arms.\n\nThe first goal finally came ten minutes after the interval. Luc Castaignos outpaced Leerdam to latch onto a Dico Koppers through ball and the striker made no mistake this time, calmly finishing past the onrushing keeper.\n\nOn the hour mark, the visitors were reduced to ten men as Chelsea loanee Patrick van Aanholt tackled Tadić from behind and was shown a straight red from referee Pieter Vink.\n\nThe chemistry between Tadić and Castaignos is growing game by game and with twelve minutes remaining the two combined to double the lead and seal the points for Twente. The two exchanged a wonderful one-two leading to Dusan Tadić wonderfully chipping Velthuizen with great composure. The Serbian is truly to most valuable player in the Eredivisie right now with four goals and four assists in the six games in 2014.\n\nThe win means Twente are just a point away from leaders Ajax as Vitesse are now without a win in five games and Peter Bosz must be feeling that the challenge of the club’s first ever Eredivisie title must be out of reach now.\n\nTEAMS\n\nTWENTE: Marsman, Rosales, Martina, Bjelland, Koppers, Gutiérrez, Ebecilio, Eghan (Børven 69), Tadić, Castaignos (Djordjevic 87), Promes.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Stevens, Hölscher, Röseler, Breukers, Tapia.\n\nGOALS: Castaignos 55, Tadić 78.\n\nBOOKINGS: Eghan.\n\nVITESSE: Velthuizen, Kashia, Van Aanholt, Van der Heijden, Leerdam, Vejinovic, Atsu (Labyad 73), Pröpper, Piazón (Van der Struijk 66), Ibarra (Traoré 73), Havenaar.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Room, Mori, Djurdjevic, Qazaishvili.\n\nGOALS: None.\n\nBOOKINGS: Leerdam, Vejinovic.\n\nSENT OFF: Van Aanholt.\n\nRKC WAALWIJK 1-3 NEC NIJMEGEN\n\nAnton Janssen’s NEC came back from conceding an early goal to earn a vital 3-1 win at RKC Waalwijk, this was the Nijmegen’s side first league victory on the road this season.\n\nNEC nearly took the lead within the opening few minutes after a great move by Alireza Jahanbakhsh and Kevin Conboy. The Iranian laid the ball into Conboy who chest passed it back to the 20-year-old winger but his sliding effect crashed off the post.\n\nThe hosts took the lead on six minutes with Romeo Castelen’s fourth goal of the season. Kenny Anderson and Daniel de Ridder combined until the ball fell perfectly for Castelen to hit a low drive past Swedish keeper Karl-Johan Johnsson.\n\nThe visitors were close to equalising minutes later but Conboy’s effort was tipped onto the bar by Jan Šeda. However, Janssen did not have to wait much longer to see the game turned around for his side.\n\nAfter a long free-kick from deep was nodded down by English striker Michael Higdon on 25 minutes, Navarone Foor was on hand to finish from close range. With six minutes to go before the half-time whistle, the visitors took the lead. Club captain Ryan Koolwijk launched a free-kick from the left which met Lasse Nielsen’s glancing header at the front post to make it 2-1.\n\nAfter the break, the points were almost cemented on 54 minutes. A corner from Koolwijk was headed by Jahanbakhsh, and the Iranian international flicked his effort towards goal, but it took a deflection off Evander Sno and onto the crossbar.\n\nThe win was clinched by Michael Higdon on 71 minutes to give NEC a great away win. Combining down the right, Jahanbakhsh and Søren Rieks crossed in for the Englishman to mishit a volley which ended up in the goal anyways.\n\nRKC drop to 13th just two points off the relegation places with NEC lifted out of the drop zone into 15th.\n\nTEAMS\n\nRKC: Šeda, Lamey, Van Hoevelen, Anderson (Braber 47), Gouano, Amieux (Apau 68), Sno, Jungschläger, Castelen, De Ridder (Beauguel 76), Joachim.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Van Dijk, Ivens, Van Mosselveld, Schet.\n\nGOALS: Castelen 6.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nNEC: Johnsson, Vermijl, Van Eijden, Nielsen, Conboy (Leiwakabessy 89), Štefánik (Palsson 59), Koolwijk, Foor, Rieks, Jahanbakhsh (Hemlein 90), Higdon.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Gentenaar, Haitz, Mulder, Jantscher.\n\nGOALS: Foor 25, Nielsen 39, Higdon 72.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nRODA JC 0-1 ADO DEN HAAG\n\nADO enjoyed a narrow 1-0 victory with Roda coach Jon Dahl Tomasson facing an uphill struggle to keep his side up as they sit rock bottom of the league.\n\nIn what was billed as a vital relegation battle, it was poor game in front of 14,000 supporters inside the Parkstad Limburg Stadion, which proved why both sides are at the bottom of the division. The fans endured a horrible first-half with no clear cut chances for either side.\n\nThe only excitement of the first 45 minutes came just before the half-time whistle when ADO were denied a penalty by referee Kevin Blom. Video replays showed that the visitors had a viable argument as Ard van Peppen had handled the ball in the area.\n\nMitchell Schet scored the only goal on 53 minutes, finishing a rebound from a Yanic Wildschut effort after Filip Kurto had blocked the original chance.\n\nKurto was called into action again with better consequences for him as he saved a Danny Bakker header minutes later from a great free-kick crossed in by Danny Holla.\n\nWith both sides desperate for points the action heated up with ten minutes to go. Substitiute Marc Höcher crossed for Mitchell Donald but his header was by goalkeeper Robert Zwinkels, filling in for Gino Coutinho.\n\nIn stoppage time, Roda should have clinched a point but Wiljan Pluim nodded his effort straight at Zwinkels feet.\n\nThe whistle was blown for full-time and Roda were roundly jeered off the pitch by their fans. The battle for ADO Den Haag is not over as they still sit third bottom in the relegation playoff places. Both sides are struggling to score goals and need to find some firepower soon otherwise they stand no chance of leaving the drop zone.\n\nTEAMS\n\nRODA: Kurto, Ramos (Shkurti 79), Van Peppen, Luijckx, Letschert, Donald, Sutchuin, Paulissen, Kali, Hupperts, Pluim.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Prus, Monteyne, Bosing, Jacobs.\n\nGOALS: None.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nADO: Zwinkles, Malone, Zuiverloon, Wormgoor, Meijers, Holla (Kanon 90+1), Gehrt (Kramer 90), Bakker, Schet, Van Duinen, Wildschut (Van Haaren 81).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: De Zwart, Merencia, Buwalda, Cabral.\n\nGOALS: Schet 53.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nAZ ALKMAAR 1-1 FC UTRECHT\n\nDick Advocaat’s AZ Alkmaar missed out on the opportunity to move closer to the top five when they were held 1-1 by Jan Wouters’ FC Utrecht.\n\nIt was a quiet opening twenty minutes inside the AFAS Stadion and when the action livened up it was the visitors that nearly took the lead. Australian Tommy Oar whipped in a vicious free-kick that missed everyone and forced a great save from AZ keeper Esteban.\n\nA minute later, the action went up the other end and produced a goal. Down the left Roy Beerens crossed into the front post where American striker Aron Johannsson met the ball with a diving header giving Robbin Ruiter no chance of saving.\n\nUtrecht battled on and got back in the game with Steve de Ridder being the main threat testing Esteban on many occasions but failed to make a breakthrough.\n\nAfter the break, Utrecht’s Jens Toornstra hit a perfect free-kick on 55 minutes to level the scores. Jeffrey Gouweleeuw fouled the tricky Oar on the edge of the area and Toornstra hit the resulting kick into the top corner with great precision.\n\nThe score stayed 1-1 even though Toornstra nearly repeated the act on 82 minutes but his free-kick was just too high for the target.\n\nUtrecht coach Wouters, already under great pressure are now just two points adrift of the relegation spots and will look to get more points hosting FC Groningen next Sunday. AZ face a tough away trip to the Amsterdam Arena next weekend and could have done with the three points in this game to help their Europa League aspirations.\n\nTEAMS\n\nAZ: Esteban, Gouweleeuw, Reijnen, Wuytens, Viergever, Ortiz (Poulsen 79), Gudelj, Gorter (Henriksen 66), Berghuis, Beerens, Jóhannsson.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: De Winter, Johansson, Gudmundsson, Haye, Avdic.\n\nGOALS: Jóhannsson 21.\n\nBOOKINGS: Gudelj 86.\n\nUTRECHT: Ruiter, Delpierre, Markiet, Van der Maarel, Dorda, Sarota, Ayoub (Diemers 51), Toornstra, De Ridder, Agudelo (Koevermans 75), Oar.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Verhoeven, Quesada, Bjelica, Klaiber.\n\nGOALS: Toornstra 55.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nAfter hitting two tips yesterday at 6/4 and 13/10 – Will Burns is back with his picks for the Eredivisie in today’s games and like all his tips, you will not see a ‘best bet’ under evens – good luck!\n\nSunday 16th February\n\nSC CAMBUUR vs. PEC ZWOLLE – 11:30\n\nPEC Zwolle travel to Cambuur on Sunday full of confidence on the back of three wins and a mighty draw against league leaders Ajax last weekend (which I predicted). However, Cambuur are desperate for a win after dropping down into 15th and top points off the bottom of the Eredivisie.\n\nZwolle now sit in eighth and will be dreaming of Europa League football next season.

Feyenoord know all games are must-wins if they are to realise their dream of clinching a 15th Eredivisie championship.\n\nExpect Jordy Clasie to return to Koeman’s side to boss the midfield and take Feyenoord to the victory.

This weekend the strong test of Marco van Basten’s Heerenveen comes to the Amsterdam ArenA.\n\nHeerenveen arrive without defender Kenny Otigba suspended after being dismissed last weekend in his side’s win over Groningen. Van Basten does have a tremendous attacking force of Hakim Ziyech, Bilal Basacikoglu and Alfred Finnbogason in tow which could give De Boer’s defence some trouble.\n\nI am predicting goals in this one with Davy Klaassen and Lasse Schöne being in great form also, but after last week’s draw against Zwolle, I think the desperation of getting a result against Heerenveen may overcome Ajax and a draw may be on the cards at a HUGE price of 5/1.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Draw (5/1 – BetVictor) – Click here to bet on this market.\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nA crazy day in the Dutch top flight that ends a crazy week of games with goals galore. Ajax had the chance to pull away from the chasing pack in the Eredivisie title race but they were held to a 1-1 draw to a PEC Zwolle side who could have stole all three points today.\n\nSunday 9th February 2014\n\nHERACLES 1-1 CAMBUUR\n\nHeracles and Cambuur shared the points in the opening game of Sunday, it was a late goal for the home side that shattered Cambuur hopes of clearing themselves out of relegation trouble for now.\n\nIt was a slow start to the game in the Polman Stadion with both sides failing to create any chances in the opening twenty minutes of the match but the away side took the lead after 23 minutes gone.\n\nA long ball forward was latched on by Cambuur’s on-loan striker Elvis Manu, and the Feyenoord man held off the challenges of Bart Schenkeveld and with Jeroen Veldmate failing to get across in time, the 20-year-old used great composure to finish to give the visitors the lead.\n\nHeracles had their chances but no more so than the horrendous miss of the on-loan Mikhail Rosheuvel in the 47th minute. A cross came in from the left where the AZ man dived for a header which flicked up and smacked off the crossbar from just four yards out. If he had made the choice to stick a boot on it instead he possibly would have scored.\n\nRosheuval had a better effort a few minutes later, latching on a long ball, and taking Lucas Bijker out of the challenge with his great first touch but his shot was straight at Leonard Nienhuis who parried the shot away.\n\nIt was end to end stuff as a few minutes later, Marcel Ritzmaier, on-loan from PSV, smashed a 20 yard shot off the opposite crossbar.\n\nThe points were snatched away from the visitors as Heracles got the goal to grab a point with just a minute of the game remaining, a corner was nodded home by Mike te Wierik.\n\nTEAMS\n\nHERACLES: Pasveer, Veldmate (Powel 85), Davidson, Schenkeveld, Te Wierik, Cziommer, Rienstra, Bel Hassani, Bruns (Tannane 47), Uth, Rosheuvel (Amoah 79).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Telgenkamp, Koenders, Van Dijk, Belterman.\n\nGOALS: Te Wierik 89.\n\nBOOKINGS: Reinstra, Schenkeveld, Tannane.\n\nCAMBUUR: Nienhuis, Bijker (Pereira 64), Droste, Van der Laan (Van Boxel 81), Leeuwin, Ritzmaier, El Makrini, Bakker, Lukoki, Manu, Hemmen (Barto 68).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Zeinstra, Van Brakel, Van Moorsel, Schepers.\n\nGOALS: Manu 23.\n\nBOOKINGS: Bijker.\n\nPEC ZWOLLE 1-1 AJAX\n\nThe 12,500 present inside the IJsseldelta Stadion will wonder how Ajax got out of the stadium with a point after an action-packed game on Sunday afternoon.\n\nRon Jans can be proud of his PEC Zwolle side who more than held their own against an Ajax side that were frustrating in front of goal once De Boer’s men took a 1-0 lead after just seven minutes.\n\nCentral defender Joel Veltman made a marauding run down the right and after skipping two challenges, Joost Broerse brought the defender down. The in-form Lasse Schöne whipped in a free-kick into the front post where Davy Klaassen nodded in the opening goal.\n\nSiem de Jong really struggled today and must have misplaced his shooting boots as on 21 minutes he produced a terrible miss by his standards. Totally unmarked, the Dutchman volleyed over the bar after Ricardo van Rhijn had supplied the perfect cross for him.\n\nQuarter of an hour later, the score was level. Winter transfer window signing Thanasis Karagounis played a defence splitting through ball onto Guyon Fernandez. The on-loan striker took advantage when Ajax ‘keeper Kenneth Vermeer failed to collect and the Feyenoord man finished in the empty goal.\n\nDiederik Boer saved Zwolle a few times in the match and no more important save then just before the interval when he denied Veldman’s header from the back post after Daley Blind crossed from deep. It was a point blank stop that got the crowd cheering louder than the Fernandez goal.\n\nAjax really picked up the pace after the break and forced save after save out of Boer. Schune, De Jong and Bojan all deprived of a goal due to the hands of the 6ft 4inch stopper.\n\nZwolle could see Ajax tiring and on 69 minutes, Jans will wonder how his team did not take the lead. After Fred Benson smashed his shot from outside the area against the foot of the post, the rebound fell perfectly to Jesper Drost, but even with Vermeer out of position the 21-year-old midfielder lashed his shot off the crossbar and out. Frank de Boer gave out a sigh of relief on the touchline.\n\nWith 12 minutes to go, Zwolle should have definitely clinched all three points but De Boer can thank Veldman for saving the single point. Karagounis and the onrushing Vermeer ran onto a free ball and the Greek midfielder beat the ‘keeper to the ball. The signing from Atromitos played in Fernandez and as the striker was pulling back to fire the trigger, Veldman dived in and nicked the ball away at the right time.\n\nOn the final whistle, Jans was all smiles and De Boer was miserable but he should be smiling, as Ajax are now five points clear at the top of the league and he should feel relieved that he got out of the IJsseldelta with something. However, second placed FC Twente have a game on hand against a poor Groningen side on Wednesday night.\n\nTEAMS\n\nZWOLLE: Boer, Gravenbeek, Van Polen, Broerse, Van Hintum, Klich, Drost, Karagounis (Nijland 91), Saymak, Mahmudov (Thomas 75), Fernandez (Benson 64).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Begois, Epe, Patricio, Pereira.\n\nGOALS: Fernandez 36.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nAJAX: Vermeer, Van Rhijn, Veltman, Moisander, Riedewald (Sigthórsson 75), Klaassen, Blind, Serero (Duarte 72), Schöne, De Jong, Bojan (Fischer 60).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Van der Hart, Ligeon, Denswil, Poulsen.\n\nGOALS: Klaassen 7.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nRKC WAALWIJK 5-2 FC UTRECHT\n\nIn a game that had virtually everything RKC put Jan Wouters in major trouble as they beat his Utrecht side by five goals to two.\n\nThe Utrecht manager is now under major pressure after seeing his side slip down to 14th in the league and just three points off the relegation places.\n\nThe goal fest began after an error from Yassin Ayoub played in Romeo Castelen. Ayoub flicked a header backwards thinking he was playing it to safety, but Castelen lashed a first-time half-volley that dipped under Robbin Ruiter’s crossbar after just eight minutes of play.\n\nThe game was tied four minutes later as Jens Toornstra converted a penalty after on-loan defender Prince-Désir Gouano was punished for a handball in the area.\n\nThe scoring stopped until 11 minutes from time, where the game got incredibly wild with five goals in just fourteen fun-filled minutes. Daniel de Ridder gave the hosts the lead with a 25 yard strike after the Utrecht defence failed to close him down.\n\nUtrecht collapsed and a minute later, Kenny Anderson added a third to the tally. Straight from the kick-off Utrecht’s Steve de Ridder made it 3-2 with a wonderful solo effort.\n\nOn 86 minutes, Utrecht had a glorious chance to level the game to 3-3 after Jonas Ivens was deemed to handballed Steve de Ridder shot on goal, however, Toornstra smashed his spot-kick off the post. It got for Toornstra with just a minute of normal remaining, French striker Jean-David Beauguel latched on a Toornstra backpass and made it 4-2.\n\nLuxembourg international Aurélien Joachim made it five in third minute of stoppage time and Beauguel and Daniel de Ridder combined to play the striker in. The Luxembourgian rounded Ruiter and slotted home.\n\nUtrecht need to get points and quick and in all honesty, Jan Wouters might be lucky to still be on the bench next weekend when they visit AZ Alkmaar.\n\nTEAMS\n\nRKC: Šeda, Anderson, Apau, Van Hoevelen, Amieux, Gouano (Ivens 41), Castelen (Beauguel 85), Duits, Sno, Joachim, Schet (D.

Unfortunately for the Brazilian defender, Swedish keeper Kristoffer Nordfeldt pulled off a great save to tip wide.\n\nAs always Heerenveen are the most dangerous on the counter attack and today proved no different. On 33 minutes, straight from a Marco Bizot goal-kick, Marten de Roon headed back up the field into the feet of Alfred Finnbogason. The Icelander fired a ball forward for Rajiv van la Parra to run onto, the young winger then lashed the ball past the stunned Bizot for the opener.\n\nGroningen fell to pieces and three minutes later, they found themselves two goals down. Again on the counter, Van la Parra and Hakim Ziyech combining with one-twos until Ziyech finished.\n\nThings were getting messy for Van de Looi’s men and it was 3-0 and they were down to ten men on 39 minutes. Alfred Finnbogason skipped past Bizot and was ready to turn and finish into the goal until Kieftenbeld saved with his hands on the goal-line, the striker converted the resulting spot-kick.\n\nReferee Bas Nijhuis had to dish out the red again with just under twenty minutes of time remaning which level the teams up. As Groningen’s Michael de Leeuw was running through on goal, Kenny Otigba was last defender and the Hungarian seemed to clip the midfielder’s heels.\n\nGroningen grabbed a 86th minute consolation goal after Genaro Zeefuik was felled by Stefano Marzo in the area and Michael de Leeuw put away the penalty kick. Marco van Basten was angry with two minutes remaning after his side had a penalty claim waved away but in all fairness the game was for him after 39 minutes. Heerenveen leapfrog back into fifth at PSV’s expense.\n\nTEAMS\n\nGRONINGEN: Bizot, Burnet (Hateboer 46), Botteghin, Kappelhof, Wijnaldum, Chery, Kieftenbeld, Van Nieff (Zeefuik 79), Kirm, De Leeuw, Kostic (Lindgren 46).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Van der Lei, Adorjan, Hiarlej, Zivkovic.\n\nGOALS: De Leeuw 86P.\n\nBOOKINGS: Kieftenbeld, Hateboer.\n\nSENT OFF: Kieftenbeld.\n\nHEERENVEEN: Nordfeldt, Marzo, Otigba, Kum, Van Anholt, De Roon, Ziyech, Van den Berg (Sinkgraven 65), Van La Parra (Slagveer 87), Finnbogason, Basacikoglu (Lurling 68).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Vandenbussche, De Kamps, Warmotts, Van Aken.\n\nGOALS: Van la Parra 33, Ziyech 36, Finnbogason 40P.\n\nBOOKINGS: Marzo, Lurling.\n\nSENT OFF: Otigba.\n\nSTANDINGS\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nIn the midweek games, our top tipster Will Burns hit a four bets out of nine at massive prices to make a huge profit (13/8, 13/5, 11/4 and 19/10) and last night hit ANOTHER one at 6/5. He is back with his picks for the Eredivisie this coming weekend and like all his tips, you will not see a ‘best bet’ under evens – good luck!\n\nSaturday 8th February\n\nPSV vs. FC TWENTE – 17:45\n\nWith both sides coming into this one on the back of good wins, it sure proves to a be a great game when second-placed Twente travel to the Phillips Stadion to face PSV on Saturday evening.\n\nThe installation of Guus Hiddink as Phillip Cocu’s advisor will only help the Eindhoven’s patchy season so far but Twente are in great form and are desperate to close the gap between themselves and Ajax. A win for Twente in this would sit them only a point off the top.\n\nI believe a feel good factor could be back in Eindhoven for this one but Twente could be too strong for Cocu’s men. The best bet would be to sit on the fence and settle for a draw.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Draw (5/2 – BetVictor)\n\nNAC BREDA vs. RODA JC – 18:45\n\nIt’s a relegation battle in Breda. NAC missed the chance to pick up three vital points in Nijmegen on Wednesday night and with just two wins from their last nine matches, they now find themselves just four points above the relegation zone.\n\nJon Dahl Tomasson’s Roda find themselves in the drop zone but only due to a poor goal-difference. In the past five trips, two draws and three defeats does not fill you full of confidence when away from home but they do have a young prodigy on their hands who could fire them up the league.\n\nOf course, I am talking about Guus Hupperts. He is the main reason I’m betting that Roda could grab the win.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Roda to win (28/11 – Unibet)\n\nGO AHEAD EAGLES vs. AZ ALKMAAR – 18:45\n\nDick Advocaat lead AZ to back-to-back wins last week, hosting Groningen and at Vitesse which gives them three wins from their first four games of the new year has revitalised their season.\n\nThe Eagles are yet to win in 2014 but have good form, one losing once in the last five games at Adelaarshorst but I see AZ’s firepower of Aron Johansson, 13 goals in 23 games being too strong for Go Ahead. Take AZ to win at 11/10.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: AZ to win (11/10 – BetVictor & WilliamHill)\n\nFEYENOORD vs. NEC NIJMEGEN– 19:45\n\nFeyenoord had a great 2-1 away win to Roda midweek with Lex Immers and Samuel Armenteros getting involved in the goals, with Ronald Koeman not relying on Graziano Pellè notching.\n\nNEC are undefeated in 2014 with two wins and three draws but four of those games have been played at home, the only away game was a tremendous 1-1 draw in Arnhem against Vitesse.\n\nCould NEC gain another draw on Saturday night? Possibly… To play it safe I am going to say there are going to be goals in this one and plenty of them. Get on Over 4.5 Goals at Coral at 2/1 for the best bet of the day.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Over 4.5 Goals (2/1 – Coral)\n\nSunday 9th February\n\nHERACLES vs. SC CAMBUUR– 11:30\n\nSunday’s set of games opens with Cambuur’s visit to Heracles. The hosts smashed ADO 3-0 on Tuesday so they will be full of confidence. Cambuur held their own against PSV even though they let a 1-0 lead slip to be defeated by Cocu’s men.\n\nOn the road, Cambuur’s form is not great, losing six out of the last seven away league matches. Heracles have been in decent form at home (losing only one in five) due to the in-form Bryan Linssen firing off all cylinders, scoring six in six.\n\nThe best bet will be Heracles to be winning at half-time and continuing on to defeat Cambuur at the final whistle.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Heracles HT/FT (3/2 – Ladbrokes)\n\nPEC ZWOLLE vs. AJAX– 13:30\n\nThe resurgent PEC Zwolle go in search of a fourth straight win when they host league leader Ajax on Sunday.\n\nRon Jans’ men began the season in great form, winning their first four games and led the league for almost a month but a run of just one league win in 15 put pay to any title aspirations. Ajax started poorly for have clawed back and now top the league with a four point lead.\n\nI predict this to be the game of the week and a real test for Ajax, with the game ending in a score draw.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Draw (13/10 – Bet Victor)\n\nRKC WAALWIJK vs. FC UTRECHT– 13:30\n\nEven though Jan Wouter’s Utrecht have won six of their last seven matches against Waalwijk in all competitions, they have lost six of their last seven away matches in league. Utrecht are truly in horrible form at the moment even though they clinched a great point at home to Ajax last weekend.\n\nErwin Koeman’s RKC had a great week last week, defeating PSV on Sunday and drawing away to Go Ahead on Wednesday and need more points on the board to improve their position.\n\nUtrecht also need points to and since loan signing Juan Agudelo has arrived from Stoke, he has started in back-to-back games alongside Steven de Ridder up front. Agudelo and De Ridder have impressed and I feel they could be the two help Wouters clinch a win.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Utrecht to win (12/5 – Coral)\n\nFC GRONINGEN vs. HEERENVEEN – 15:30\n\nThe final game of the weekend sees Marco van Basten take his Heerenveen side to Groningen. Both teams will be looking to bounce back after midweek defeats as Groningen lost narrowly away to Ajax and Heerenveen at home against FC Twente.\n\nGroningen were incredibly unlucky against Ajax on Thursday with a late goal snatching a great point away from their grasp. With Hakim Ziyech and Alfred Finnbogason, Heerenveen are always dangerous but I feel Groningen could win this game especially if Filip Kostic can put in a performance like he did against Ajax. BetVictor are offering 6/5 for the home win and I see this as the best bet.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Groningen to win (6/5 – BetVictor)\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nAjax scraped a narrow 2-1 win at home against a valiant FC Groningen to head the table four points clear of second placed FC Twente, although the Enschede side has a game in hand.\n\nThursday 6th February 2014\n\nFC UTRECHT 1-2 PEC ZWOLLE\n\nRon Jans’s PEC Zwolle came from behind to nail their third win in the a row against a ten-man Utrecht side.\n\nAdam Sorota was given his marching orders on just before the hour mark and Utrecht were made to pay. Referee Jeroen Sanders gave the midfielder a straight red card after a dangerous challenge on Zwolle striker Guyon Fernandez.\n\nThe home side made a good start with American striker Juan Agudelo, on-loan from Stoke City, opening the scoring in the 24th minute with a spectacular strike after turning his marker with ease in the penalty area.\n\nZwolle got a new lease of life when Sorota was shown the red card and Ron Jans’ side had the man advantage. The substitute of Macedonian striker Denis Mahmudov on for young debutant Australian defender Trent Sainsbury was inspired on and the 24-year-old scored an excellent goal within minute of being on.\n\nJust three minutes later, the game had seen a total turnaround as Zwolle grabbed their second. Utrecht failed to clear a corner and the ball fell perfectly for Fred Benson to spin his marker and striker over Robbin Ruiter in goal.\n\nZwolle held onto to win, however, looking for the fourth win in a run on Sunday, they face the tough task of league leaders Ajax.\n\nTEAMS\n\nFC UTRECHT: Ruiter, Van der Winden (Dorda 46), Van der Maarel, Delpierre (Koevermans 86), Heerings (Markiet 47), Toornstra, Sarota, Ayoub, De Ridder, Oar, Agudelo.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Verhoeven, Diemers, Queseda, Badjeck.\n\nGOALS: Agudelo 24.\n\nBOOKINGS: De Ridder.\n\nSENT OFF: Sarota.\n\nPEC ZWOLLE: Boer, Van Hintum, Broerse, Sainsbury (Mahmudov 73), Klich (Nijland 72), Karagounis (Benson 47), Van Polen, Drost, Gravenbeek, Saymak, Fernandez.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Begois, Epe, Patricio, Fennich.\n\nGOALS: Mahmudov 74, Benson 77.\n\nBOOKINGS: Broerse.\n\nAJAX 2-1 FC GRONINGEN\n\nFC Groningen were unfortunate not to leave the Amsterdam Arena with a point this evening after a tremendous performance, however a Kolbeinn Sigthórsson goal seven minutes from time gave the Amsterdammers the win.\n\nThe game started cautiously but we soon saw Ajax dominate the possession and grab a hold of the game and before the half-hour we saw the opening goal.\n\nWith 28 minutes gone, Ajax were awarded a penalty by referee Serdar Gözübüyük after Eric Botteghin stuck out a leg to stop Spanish striker Bojan in the area. Danish midfielder Lasse Schöne stepped up to convert, this was his sixth goal of the season in all competitions.\n\nHowever, Ajax were given a scare when Filip Kostic curled home an unexpected but a delightful left-footed effort before the break that left goalkeeper Kenneth Vermeer totally stranded.\n\nThe second half was a different story and Groningen started to trouble Ajax and looked more likely to go onto win the game. Kostic was causing all sorts of trouble to the back tracking Ajax defenders but his shot did not match his excellent run and was easily saved by Vermeer.\n\nDe Boer rang the changes and brought on three substitutes but Kolbeinn Sigthórsson made the biggest impact and headed home a Christian Poulsen cross on 83 minutes to put a smile on the manager’s face.\n\nTEAMS\n\nAJAX: Vermeer, Van Rhijn, Moisander, Veltman, Riedewald (Poulsen 67), Serero (Duarte 75), Klaassen, Blind, Schöne, Bojan, De Jong (Sigthórsson 67).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Van der Hart, Van der Hoorn, Fischer, Denswil.\n\nGOALS: Schöne 28P, Sigthórsson 83.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nFC GRONINGEN: Bizot, Wijnaldum, Burnet, Botteghin, Kappelhof, Kieftenbeld, Van Nieff (Zeefuik 87), Chery, De Leeuw (Zivkovic 76), Kostic.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Van der Lei, Adorjan, Lindgren, Hiarlej, Magnasco.\n\nGOALS: Kostic 41.\n\nBOOKINGS: Wijnaldum, Kappelhof, De Leeuw.\n\nSTANDINGS\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nAfter nailing four out of nine games at the weekend, Will Burns is back with his picks for the midweek Eredivisie extravaganza (all nine games) and like all his tips, you will not see a ‘best bet’ under evens – good luck!\n\nTuesday 4th February\n\nRODA JC vs. FEYENOORD – 17:45\n\nRoda’s last game at Parkstad Limburg Stadion was Jon Dahl Tomasson’s first win as head coach in a 1-0 win over Utrecht. After losing 3-1 at PEC Zwolle on Saturday, they face the tough test of Ronald Koeman’s Feyenoord tomorrow night.\n\nFeyenoord featured in Friday night’s game which was a 1-1 draw against Vitesse that leaves the Koeman’s men seven points off league leaders Ajax. The title race is not out of reach yet and they will look to Italian striker Graziano Pelle to add to his tally of 16 in 19 games this campaign.\n\nI can see Feyenoord being too strong for Roda and at 13/8 at Betfair for the Rotterdam side to be winning at half-time and full-time, it’s too big of a bet to miss.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Feyenoord HT/FT (13/8 – Betfair)\n\nADO DEN HAAG vs. HERACLES – 18:45\n\nBoth sides experienced defeats over the weekend: Heracles at home to NAC Breda and ADO at Heerenveen, with a five points separating them in the league table.\n\nI see this being a close game even though both sides will be itching to get back on track, I see this match finishing as a score draw. For the best bet, take a look at BetVictor’s at 13/5 for this one.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Draw (13/5 – BetVictor)\n\nVITESSE vs. AZ ALKMAAR – 19:45\n\nTuesday’s main event will be second place Vitesse hosting sixth placed AZ Alkmaar. AZ have proved to be a bit of a jinx for the Arnhem side over the years, with Vitesse failing to find a win in the last eight meetings between the two sides.\n\nPeter Bosz’s side will look to change all that this time round and place a bit of pressure on Ajax, currently two points clear them. A win would take Vitesse ahead of the Amsterdam side, with Ajax yet to play at home to Groningen on Thursday.\n\nAZ will certainly not lay down for Vitesse and it will be a tough test for Bosz’s men. However, AZ has been a little inconsistent with two wins and three defeats from their last five matches played. Look for Vitesse to win this one and let’s take them to win by two clear goals to give us a bit of value.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Vitesse -1 (29/20 – SkyBet)\n\nWednesday 5th February\n\nSC CAMBUUR vs. PSV – 17:45\n\nAfter a shocking display at Waalwijk, a 2-0 defeat on Sunday, Philip Cocu needs to pick his side up for the trip to Cambuur on Wednesday evening.

However, Erwin Koeman’s side has a horrible away record with only two wins in the last 21 trips.\n\nGo Ahead on the other hand has faired well at home this season with only two defeats in ten, and those losses were against the current top two, Vitesse and Ajax. A win for RKC is not unthinkable but I cannot see it happening.\n\nAlthough the draw on the other hand could, with six draws for the Eagles and seven for RKC already this season I can see them adding to this tally on Wednesday.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Draw (13/5 – Betfred, SkyBet and Bet365)\n\nNEC NIJMEGEN vs. NAC BREDA – 18:45\n\nIt is a close league this season with just five points splitting NEC (17th) and NAC (10th).

Both midfields constantly failed to link up with their forwards and give the ball away to each other, and were restricted to long-range efforts which never bothered either goalkeeper. The score at half-time was goal-less.\n\nThe hosts pressed after the break and took the lead in controversial fashion that referee Ed Janssen under huge protests from the ADO players. Hakim Ziyech whipped in a free-kick from the right-wing which sailed into the arms of ADO goalkeeper Gino Coutinho low on the ground. Tom Beugelsdijk was marking Kenny Otigba who was heading towards the ball and both players momentum sent Otigba into the ball to knock it home. Coutinho did have two hands on the ball but the goal was given.\n\nThe advantage was doubled ten minutes later, when a spot-kick was awarded when Bilal Basacikoglu was weakly pushed over by Aaron Meijers. This gave Alfred Finnbogason the opportunity to score his 20th goal in just 18 games, which he duly took, coolly chipping the ball down the middle of the goal.\n\nADO applied pressure to try and get back into the game but the points were cemented deep into stoppage time. Heerenveen absorbed the attacks and sent Rajiv van la Parra on the counter attack to make it three.\n\nTEAMS\n\nHEERENVEEN: Nordfeldt, Van Anholt, Kum, Otigba, Dijks, De Roon, Van den Berg, Ziyech (Sinkgraven 91), Lurling (Van la Parra 83), Finnbogason, Basacikoglu.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Vandenbussche, Marzo, De Kamps, Slagveer, Zomer.\n\nGOALS: Otigba 58, Finnbogason 68P, Van La Parra 90+2.\n\nBOOKINGS: Van Anholt, Otigba.\n\nADO DEN HAAG: Coutinho, Malone, Zuiverloon, Beugelsdijk, Meijers, Bakker (Kramer 63), Holla, Van Haaren, Alberg, Van Duinen, Schet.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Zwinkels, Wormgoor, Gouriye, Kanon, Merencia, Cabral.\n\nGOALS: None\n\nBOOKINGS: Van Haaren, Schet.\n\nPEC ZWOLLE 3-1 RODA JC\n\nJon Dahl Tomasson suffered his first league defeat as Roda manager as they fell to an improving PEC Zwolle side in a quiet an even game.\n\nThe away side failed to keep possession early on and in the 19th minute, New Zealand international Ryan Thomas gave Zwolle the lead. After Roda were unable to clear a corner, the ball fell to Thomas who slid home from close range.\n\nAs the first-half petered out and it looked like Thomas had scored the only goal of the game until after the half-time break. Tomasson’s side pressed for an equaliser and found the goal just after the hour mark after some great play from man-of-the-moment Guus Hupperts. Hupperts weaved his way past defenders into the box and found Mitchell Donald at the back post to tap into an empty net.\n\nRoda looked more likely to grab a second but against the run of play, Zwolle were awarded a penalty on 77 minutes, after Thomas was adjudged to be bundled over by Bart Biemans by referee Bjorn Kuipers. It was a poor decision from the ref as video replays showed that Thomas had gone down easy from a shoulder nudge. Guyon Fernandez converted the spot-kick sending Filip Kurto in the opposite direction.\n\nThe points were cemented two minutes into stoppage time when substitute Fred Benson fired home Zwolle’s third. After Kurto had stopped Mateusz Klich and Thanasis Karagounis’s close range effort, Benson finished to send the home side home happy.\n\nTEAMS\n\nZWOLLE: Boer, Van Hintum, Broerse, Van der Werff (Lachman 47 (Gravenbeek 68)), Mokotjo, Van Polen, Karagounis, Klich, Saymak (Benson 74), Thomas, Fernandez.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Begios, Nijland, Drost, Mahmudov.\n\nGOALS: Thomas 19, Fernandez 77P, Benson 90.\n\nBOOKINGS: Klich.\n\nRODA: Kurto, Monteyne (Ramos 89), Van Peppen, Biemans, Luijckx, Paulissen (Hocher 82), Donald, Kali, Sutchin, Hupperts, Shkurti (Pluim 65).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Prus, Bonevacia, Wijnen, Jacobs.\n\nGOALS: Donald 62.\n\nBOOKINGS: Paulissen, Biemans.\n\nHERACLES 1-2 NAC BREDA\n\nNAC Breda defeated Heracles by two goals to one to leapfrog them into the top ten and win their first game in three matches.\n\nBreda had goalkeeper Jelle ten Rouwelaar to thank in the opening half-hour after the hosts began the better of the two sides. However, at the other end Remko Pasveer gifted NAC the lead in the 38th minute with Jordy Buijs getting his third goal of the season. The Heracles ‘keeper failed to catch a corner and Buijs prodded home the opening goal.\n\nJan de Jonge’s men pressed for an equaliser but watched his side concede another just after the hour mark. Mats Seuntkens turned Jason Davidson on the right-wing and whipped in a pin-perfect cross to Rydell Popeon in the middle of the area to head past Pasveer.\n\nTen minutes later, Heracles did get a goal back through top scorer Bryan Linssen. Simon Cziommer surged into the right area of the box and looped a ball towards goal where Linssen rose above everyone to make it 2-1.\n\nLinssen nearly got his eighth goal of the campaign to equalise near the end of the game, but Rouwelaar again, kept his team in it to fire his team into the top ten.\n\nTEAMS\n\nHERACLES: Pasveer, Veldmate, Davidson, Te Wierik, Schenkeveld, Rienstra, Bel Hassani (Bruns 80), Cziommer, Linssen, Rosheuvel (Tannane 64), Uth (Powel 67).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Telgenkamp, Amoah, Van Dijk, Belterman.\n\nGOALS: Linssen 71.\n\nBOOKINGS: Cziommer, Veldmate.\n\nNAC: Ten Rouwelaar, Van der Weg, Buijs, Drost, De Roover, Matic (Suk 78), Gilissen, Hadouir (Verbeek 84), Seuntjens, Sarpong (Tighadouini 90), Poepen.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Babos, Perica, Swerts, Bodor.\n\nGOALS: Buijs 38, Poepon 61.\n\nBOOKINGS: Van der Weg, Hadouir.\n\nAZ ALKMAAR 2-0 FC GRONINGEN\n\nTwo first-half Nemanja Gudelj goals gave AZ a great 2-0 win over FC Groningen.\n\nIt was a great start for Dick Advocaat’s men as Gudelj opened the scoring in just the third minute of play. From a Celso Ortiz free-kick, the ball fell kindly in the area for the Serbian midfielder to strike off Groningen defender Eric Botteghin and past Marco Bizot in the visitors’ goal.\n\nAZ smelt blood and attacked Groningen relentlessly until the Serbian made it two in the 17th minute, and it was a great volleyed effort. After Steven Berghuis curled a low ball into the box, Gudelj acrobatically hit a right foot smash past Bizot.\n\nGroningen improved after the internval but were unable to breach the AZ defence, and now the Alkmaar side has won two of its last three Eredivisie matches to climb to sixth place with 30 points, moving the club two points clear of their opponents today.\n\nTEAMS\n\nAZ: Esteban, Wuytens, Gouweleeuw, Viergever, Reijnen, Gudelj, Elm, Berghuis (Gudmundsson 77), Ortiz, Johannsson, Beerens.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: De Winter, Johansson, Gorter, Henriksen, Lewis, Avdic.\n\nGOALS: Gudelj 3, 17.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nGRONINGEN: Bizot, Magnasco (Nieff 47), Wijnaldum, Kappelhof, Hiarlej (Zeefuik 76), Botteghin, Kieftenbeld, De Leeuw, Chery, Adorjan (Burnet 47), Kostic.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Van der Lei, Kirm, Lindgren, Zivkovic.\n\nGOALS: None.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nSUNDAY 26TH JANUARY 2014\n\nWeek 20 closed with just three games on Sunday as the Groningen-Twente match failed to take place due to a frozen pitch. The games that did go ahead provided great excitement and two more shock results to close the round of games.\n\nSC CAMBUUR 3-1 HEERENVEEN\n\nSC Cambuur provided their fans with a good day on Sunday with their first win in the Friese Derby since 1994.\n\nNigerian forward Bartholomew Ogbeche stole the show making his debut for Cambuur, creating one and scoring in the fantastic win. The hosts warmed up their fans in the Cambuur Stadion on a bitterly cold winter’s afternoon in Leeuwarden with a goal after just four minutes.\n\nThe goal was created by a long ball from the back of the Cambuur defence, Ogbeche rose above Joey van der Berg with ease to flick the ball into the path of on-loan striker Elvis Manu. Manu overpowered Christian Kum to win the ball and chip the ball over the onrushing Kristoffer Nordfeldt. The stadium erupted as Manu and Ogbeche wheeled away to celebrate with a dance at the corner flag.\n\nMarco van Basten’s men should have equalized on 16 minutes by Leonard Nienhuis pulled off a great save to deny Hakim Ziyech. After Luciano Slagveer crossed from Ziyech just outside the area, Ziyech let fly with a right-foot volley but Nienhuis got across a tipped it out for a corner.\n\nJust before the half-time whistle, Cambuur’s lead was doubled. Heerenveen’s on-loan defender Mitchell Dijks was penalised for a soft foul on Ajax team-mate Jody Lukoki, currently on-loan to Cambuur. The free-kick was given on the right-wing and Marcel Ritzmaier, also on-loan from PSV Eindhoven, whipped the ball into the centre. Once again, winning the aerial duel was Bartholomew Ogbeche who slipped Ramon Zoner to make it 2-0.\n\nHeerenveen came out for the second half hungry for an early goal but they were unable to cope with the speed of the Cambuur attack and with just twenty minutes to go, the home side wrapped up the points. Manu slipped a defence-splitting ball through to Jody Lukoki who beat the offside trap and raced through on goal. With a one-on-one challenge with Nordfeldt, the 21-year-old kept his composure and finished coolly. The game was done and Dwight Lodeweges could be proud of his team’s performance today.\n\nBefore the final whistle could be blown, the inevitable happened as Alfred Finnbogason got a consolation goal for Heerenveen, his 19th goal in 17 games. However, it was an embarrassing defeat for Van Basten and his side and will look to bounce back next week at home to ADO. They now sit fifth and six points of fourth place. Meanwhile, for Cambuur the win lifts them up to 13th but they will need to build on this win to climb out of the relegation battle as Lodeweges men are still only three points off bottom side NEC.\n\nTEAMS\n\nCAMBUUR: Nienhuis, Droste, Van der Laan, Bijker, El Makrini, Van Moorsel, Leeuwin, Ritzmaier, Lukoki, Ogbeche (Barto 74), Manu (Manu 91).\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Zeinstra, Van Boxel, Pereira, Bakker, Van Brakel.\n\nGOALS: Manu 4, Ogbeche 44, Lukoki 69.\n\nBOOKINGS: Lukoki\n\nHEERENVEEN: Nordfeldt, Van Anholt, Dijks, Zomer (Sinkgraven 59), Kum, De Roon, Van den Berg (De Kamps 74), Ziyech, Slagveer (Wildschut 57), Finnbogason, Basacikoglu.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Vandenbussche, Otigba, Marzo, Fazli.\n\nGOALS: Finnbogason 85.\n\nBOOKINGS: Basacikoglu, Finnbogason.\n\nVITESSE 1-1 NEC NIJMEGEN\n\nVitesse’s title hopes suffered a bitter blow as they were held at home against relegation candidates NEC in the Gelderse derby.\n\nVitesse stay second after the draw but it looked promising early on for the Arnhem side after taking the lead on the half hour mark. Star of last week’s win over PEC Zwolle, Christian Atsu whipped in a corner that found defender Dan Mori in the box who headed home past Karl-Johan Johnsson in goal.\n\nThe basement boys NEC should have levelled the game up before the interval, after they pressed and had Vitesse on the ropes for the remaining ten minutes of the half.\n\nVitesse failed to score another and paid the price with just twenty minutes to go. Danish forward Søren Rieks spun in a cross that the Vitesse defence failed to clear and Englishman Michael Higdon notched to tie the game.\n\nThe GelreDome crowd went home unhappy and even more so that title rivals Ajax defeated Go Ahead Eagles a few hours later.\n\nTEAMS\n\nVITESSE: Velthuizen, Mori, Van Aanholt, Leerdam, Van der Heijden, Pröpper, Vejinovic, Piazón (Traoré 68), Atsu, Ibarra (Labyad 78), Havenaar.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Houwen, Achenteh, Van der Struijk, Đurđević, Kazaishvili.\n\nGOALS: Mori 30.\n\nBOOKINGS: None.\n\nNEC: Johnsson, Conboy (Leiwakabessy 77), Van Eijden, Haitz, Vermeijl, Rieks (Foor 65), Koolwijk, Štefánik (Mulder 88), Jantscher, Hemlein, Higdon.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Smits, Cmovs, Disveld, Castillion.\n\nGOALS: Higdon 71.\n\nBOOKINGS: Van Eijden.\n\nGO AHEAD EAGLES 0-1 AJAX\n\nAjax struggled to find their finishing in Deventer on Sunday afternoon but a narrow 1-0 win means that they stay top of the pile.\n\nAs expected Ajax dominated in the early stages and should have taken the lead after just three minutes, if it were not for a shocking Kolbeinn Sigthórsson miss. Frank de Boer has his head in his hands after Bojan and Davy Klaassen had worked well to head the ball onto the Icelandic striker, but he fired his volley from just a few yards out straight in Eloy Room’s arms.\n\nAjax’s pressure was relentless but like Sigthórsson, Bojan, Klaassen and Lesley De Sa’s finishing was poor and unable to break the deadlock. Against the run of play, Go Ahead could have gone ahead themselves. Joël Veltman failed to head clear a Jarchinio Antonia cross from the right-wing but the defender got himself in front of Jeffrey Rijsdijk’s attempt to concede a corner.\n\nThe first-half petered out and ended goal-less but Ajax fired out of the blocks and were angry that they were not awarded a penalty after 51 minutes. Antonia bundled Klaassen over on the left side of the area, but referee Reinold Wiedemeijer booked the Ajax midfielder for diving, and the majority of the 7,938 attendance were cheering the decision.\n\nDe Boer needed a goal and quick and just after the hour mark injected some fresh legs into the attack with the double Dane substitution of Lasse Schöne and Viktor Fischer on for De Sa and the poor Sigthórsson. Within a minute, Fischer nearly opened the scoring but his header from a Klaassen cross forced a save from Room.\n\nThe goal finally came on 74 minutes and it was the other substitution that broke the deadlock. After Ajax were awarded a free-kick outside the area courtesy of a Deniz Türüç handball, Lasse Schöne stood up to take it. The Danish midfielder fired his first attempt in the wall but after the rebound returned in his path, his low drive was too powerful for Room to stop and nestle into the corner of the goal.\n\nAjax held on for the win and due to Vitesse being held by NEC, now sit two points at the top of the Eredivisie league table.\n\nTEAMS\n\nGO AHEAD: Room, Schmidt, Vriends, Van der Linden, Schenk, Overgoor (Amevor 84), Rijsdijk (Lambooij 68), Türüç, Antonia (Kavak 91), Houtkoop, Kolder.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Cummins, Pot, Oostinjen, Ten Den.\n\nGOALS: None\n\nBOOKINGS: Schmidt, Kolder.\n\nAJAX: Cillessen, Van Rhijn, Veltman, Moisander, Boilesen, Blind, Serero (Poulsen 86), Klaassen, De Sa (Fischer 65), Sigthórsson (Schöne 66), Bojan.\n\nSUBS NOT USED: Vermeer, Duarte, Hoesen, Denswil.\n\nGOALS: Schöne 74.\n\nBOOKINGS: Klaassen.\n\nSTANDINGS\n\nLeague table courtesy of FIFA.com\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com\n\nSunday 26th January\n\nSC CAMBUUR vs. HEERENVEEN – 11:30\n\nLast weekend, in the battle of the promoted sides, Cambuur pulled out a great 2-0 win against Go Ahead Eagles, meanwhile, Marco van Basten’s Heerenveen were unlucky not get the win in their 2-2 home draw with Roda JC.\n\nSunday should prove to be a totally different story for both sides. With Heerenveen’s attack triple threat of Hakim Ziyech, Bilal Basacikoglu and the Icelandic goal machine Alfred Finnbogason, this game promises to deliver goals. Heerenveen have proved this season to have great days away from home, and are undefeated in their last four league games.\n\nCambuur will find it hard to cope with the speed of Ziyech and Basacikoglu and trying to make sure Finnbogason does not score is also not easy after hitting the net 18 times in just 16 games so far this season. Look for Alfred to come up trumps once again, and lead his team to victory.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Heerenveen to win (8/5 – Betfair)\n\nVITESSE vs. NEC NIJMEGEN – 11:30\n\nNEC Nijmegen head to Vitesse on Sunday morning failing to win their last FOURTEEN away in the league, and since Vitesse have won seven of their last eight games, I think you can see where this prediction is going.\n\nEven though he missed a penalty last week, whether he scoring or creating, on-loan superstar Lucas Piazón is on fire. The Brazilian is hitting real form for the Arnhem and combining plays with fellow Chelsea player Christian Atsu has fired Vitesse up to second, joint on points with leaders Ajax.\n\nNEC have conceded at least two goals in their four away league matches so my best bet for this one is Vitesse to win by two or more goals, which is a cracking 8/5 at Bet365.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Vitesse to win by 2 goals or more (8/5 – Bet365)\n\nFC GRONINGEN vs. FC TWENTE – 13:30\n\nSitting in third, FC Twente are in fine form finding all three points in five of their last six games. In all those matches, Twente have been winning the game at half-time and full-time also.\n\nDušan Tadić, a contender for player of the season, is leading the charge with Twente searching for their second Eredivisie championship. His creativity, along with the speed and attacking prowess of young winger Quincy Promes, supplying striker Luc Castaignos is causing trouble for all Eredivisie defences.\n\nGroningen sit nine points beneath Twente in sixth place and have only won one game in their last six, losing two. I can’t see past Twente taking all three points here and applying a little pressure to the leading pack.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: FC Twente HT/FT (2/1 – BetVictor)\n\nGO AHEAD EAGLES vs. AJAX – 13:30\n\nThe hottest team in the league are the Eredivisie leaders Ajax, with their winning streak now up to seven matches. Apart from the influential Siem de Jong, the Amsterdammers are at full strength and after overcoming a tough first half against rivals PSV last week, they travel to Deventer to face Go Ahead.\n\nThis will be no easy feat for Ajax either with the Eagles undefeated at home in the last three games including the last two winning against PEC Zwolle and Utrecht.\n\nWith Vitesse hot on their tail, Ajax need to keep racking up the wins and I cannot see this game ending their winning streak.\n\nBURNS’ BEST BET: Ajax HT/FT (11/10 – BetVictor)\n\nClick here for Friday and Saturday’s preview and betting tips.\n\nClick the name above to follow Will on Twitter.\n\nTotalDutchFootball.com WorldFootballWeekly.com"
