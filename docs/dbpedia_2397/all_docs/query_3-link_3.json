        "text": "We are deeply saddened that Professor Zwart passed away in 2004. His lifelong contributions and support of the Dutch community live on through this very special endowment. This scholarship provides funds for students who seek to work and/or study in The Netherlands in any capacity, but with the clear goal to immerse themselves in the language and the culture of The Netherlands.\n\nAbout Martijn Zwart\n\nMartijn Zwart was born in Rotterdam in the Netherlands, studied as an undergraduate at the Univ. of Leiden, then took a Doctorate in Law at the Univ. of Amsterdam. He worked initially for the Dutch government and then for a private company in international trade. During WWII he was sent on assignment to the U.S. and stayed when Holland was invaded and occupied by Germany. During the war he worked for the Office of War Information, broadcasting to Holland as the “Voice of America” while pursuing language studies at the State Univ. of New York. When the war ended he worked for a Dutch press agency, covering the UN. Martijn then began his career as Professor of Languages at North Central College in Naperville, Illinois."
