        "text": "Mark Twain? George Carlin? Yul Brynner? Jean Cocteau? Bob Gray? Dilbert? Scott Adams? Anonymous?\n\nQuestion for Quote Investigator: Logic and careful reasoning are the ingredients of a constructive argument. Acrimony and irrationality are the elements of a fruitless argument. The celebrated humorist Mark Twain supposedly formulated the following cautionary remark. Here are two versions:\n\n(1) Never argue with idiots. They drag you down to their level and beat you with experience!\n\n(2) Never argue with stupid people because they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.\n\nComedian George Carlin has also received credit. I am skeptical of both of these attributions, and I have never seen solid citations. Would you please examine this saying?\n\nReply from Quote Investigator: QI has been unable to find substantive evidence crediting this remark to Mark Twain or George Carlin. It does not appear on the Twain Quotes website edited by Barbara Schmidt, nor does it appear in the large compilation “Mark Twain at Your Fingertips” edited by Caroline Thomas Harnsberger.\n\nScholar Matt Seybold of Elmira College and the Center for Mark Twain Studies examined this saying and concluded that “Mark Twain never said these words, nor anything resembling them”. George Carlin received credit many years after the quip was circulating.\n\nQI conjectures that the quotation evolved over time. The Bible contains a thematically related passage in Proverbs 26:4. Here is the text from the New International Version. Boldface added to excerpts by QI:\n\nDo not answer a fool according to his folly, or you yourself will be just like him.\n\nIn 1878 April “The Daily Picayune” of New Orleans, Louisiana printed an adage depicting the underlying idea without attribution:\n\nTo argue with a fool is to make him your equal.\n\nIn May 1878 “The Rochester Evening Express” of Rochester, New York printed another precursor while acknowledging an Ohio source:\n\nDon’t argue with a fool, or the listener will say there is a pair of you.—Cincinnati Breakfast Table.\n\nQI has a separate article about a family of sayings incorrectly linked to Mark Twain which is available here: Never Argue With a Fool, Onlookers May Not Be Able To Tell the Difference.\n\nIn 1956 an Associated Press columnist spoke with the popular actor Yul Brynner who attributed a partially matching statement to prominent French artist Jean Cocteau:\n\nYul said the greatest advice he ever received in life was given by the French writer Jean Cocteau, who told him:\n\n“Never associate with idiots on their own level, because, being an intelligent man, you’ll try to deal with them on their level—and on their level they’ll beat you every time.”\n\nThe above statement used the word “associate” instead of “argue”, but within a few years the remark evolved toward the modern expression. In 1958 a columnist in “The Daily Tar Heel” of Chapel Hill, North Carolina used the word “argue”. The columnist also omitted Brynner’s name and attributed the words directly to Cocteau:\n\nAs Jean Cocteau once said, “Never argue with an idiot, because being an intelligent man, you will argue with them on their level, and, on their level, they’ll beat you every time.”\n\nIn 1978 “The Memphis Press-Scimitar” of Tennessee printed an instance with a different attribution:\n\nNever associate with idiots on their own level because, being an intelligent person, you will try to deal with them on their level, and on their level they will beat you every time. — Bob Gray, Northeast Memphis Optimes\n\nThe expression continued to circulate in 1987 when it appeared in “The Kaplan Herald” of Louisiana. The connection to Cocteau was also recalled:\n\nIT’S TRUE — Never associate with idiots on their own level because, being an intelligent man, you’ll try to deal with them on their level — and on their level they’ll beat you every time. -JEAN COCTEAU\n\nIn 1993 an instance using the phrase “win with experience” appeared in the Usenet newsgroup comp.sys.cbm. The ellipsis occurred in the original text. The word “never” or “don’t” was omitted. No attribution was specified:\n\n… Argue with idiots, they drag you to their level & win with experience.\n\nIn March 1997 an instance using the phrase “beat you with experience” appeared in a message posted to the Usenet newsgroup aus.computers.mac. No attribution was given:\n\nNever Argue with idiots,\n\nThey drag you down to their level,\n\nAnd beat you with experience!\n\nIn April 1997 a message posted to newsgroup alt.games.vga-planets suggested that the guidance had been circulating for years. The words “it’s” and “received” were misspelled:\n\nFor what its worth…. This is advice I recieved years ago and wish I had followed.\n\n“Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level then beat you with experience”\n\nIn 1998 a columnist in a Kansas City, Missouri newspaper shared the saying with readers. No attribution was specified:\n\nThe following funnies are from e-mail that people have fielded from the Internet and shared with me . . .\n\nNever argue with idiots. They drag you down to their level then beat you with experience.\n\nIn January 1999 the quip appeared in the Usenet newsgroup aus.jokes, as the eighteenth item in a list titled “Dilbert’s Words of Wisdom”. Dilbert is a U.S. comic strip authored by Scott Adams. Earlier versions of the list from 1998 did not contain the quip. Several items in the list were misattributed:\n\n18. Never argue with an idiot. They drag you down to their level then beat you with experience.\n\nIn June 1999 an instance in the Usenet newsgroup alt.games.starcraft used the word “moron” instead of “idiot” or “fool”:\n\n“Never argue with a moron, they’ll drag you down to their level, and beat you with experience.”\n\nOn June 2, 2009 a tweet attributed a different expression containing the phrase “Never argue with an idiot” to Mark Twain:\n\n@Spud31 Mark Twain (I think) said “Never argue with an idiot. People might not know the difference.”\n\nOn June 23, 2009 a tweet credited Twain with a hybrid expression:\n\n“Never argue with an idiot. They will beat you with experience and people listening in may not be able to tell the difference.” — Mark Twain\n\nIn July 2011 the crowd sourced website Goodreads credited Twain with a full instance using the phrase “stupid people”. Twain died in 1910, and this evidence was not substantive:\n\n“Never argue with stupid people, they will drag you down to their level and then beat you with experience.”\n\n― Mark Twain\n\nIn 2012 a letter published in a Whitehorse, Canada newspaper employed an instance with “idiot” and mentioned the Twain attribution with skepticism:\n\n. . . another quote credited to Mark Twain, but its origin is really unknown: “Never argue with an idiot. He will drag you down to his level and beat you with experience.”\n\nIn 2013 a message in Usenet Newsgroup comp.os.linux.advocacy implausibly credited George Carlin:\n\nNever argue with an idiot. They will only bring you down to their level and beat you with experience.\n\n-George Carlin\n\nMatt Seybold is an Associate Professor of American Literature & Mark Twain Studies at Elmira College. In 2020 he wrote a valuable article on this topic. Seybold located the crucial citations in 1956 and 1958 together with other important evidence. He also discussed the friendship of Brynner and Cocteau.\n\nIn conclusion, a precursor idea appeared as a proverb in the bible. The expression has been evolving for many years. In 1956 Yul Brynner credited Jean Cocteau with a partially matching statement. A closer match appeared in 1958, and a strong match occurred in 1993. The dubious linkage to Twain occurred many decades after his death. The attribution to George Carlin was also spurious.\n\nImage Notes: Illustration of a jester’s hat from OpenClipart-Vectors at Pixabay.\n\nAcknowledgements: Great thanks to Marian T. Wirth, Brian Zachary Mayer, Thayne Davidson Muller, Robert McMillan, AnxiousPony, and Jane Bella whose inquiries led QI to formulate this question and perform this exploration. Also, thanks to Matt Seybold for his pioneering research.\n\nUpdate History: On March 16, 2024 the format of the bibliographical notes was updated. Also, the full article was placed on this website."
