From here for many years, he drove a wagon, delivering meat to the territory where now is located Newcastle, Penryn, Loomis, and Rocklin. He was an expert butcher and is well remembered by all old residents in this end of the county. When Mr. Glindcamp first came to Rocklin, there was but one house there, the Bolton cabin on the Huff ranch near the mineral spring. He was always interested in mining and covered every foot of mining ground in this vicinity during his residence here; less than a year ago he could be seen in Secret Ravine, seeking the elusive gold dust. At the time of his death, he had a contract with the United States Postal Department to carry mail between the post office and railway trains. Mr. Glindcamp was 83 years, 5 months, and 5 days old at the time of his death. He leaves to mourn his loss, a widow; a son, George Glindcamp; and a daughter, Mrs. Ester Sullivan of Colfax. The following tribute paid to Mr. Glindcamp by a life-long friend depicts the splendid character and traits of the deceased which endeared him to a large circle of friends: \"In all the years of our acquaintanceship I never once heard him speak ill of any fellow being, nor did I ever hear anyone speak ill of him.\" [Roseville Tribune and Register, 1 Dec 1926; sub by BW]\n\nCol.

Sherman\n\nMany who visited General Sherman during his command in Memphis, Tenn., observed with interest a bright-eyed, happy boy of nine years, whose cheerful ways gave an unwonted cheerfulness to headquarters. Such will learn with deep sympathy that that merry voice is still, and those active limbs at rest forever. âWilliam T. Sherman, died at 5 P. M., October 4, 1863, aged nine years,â is the melancholy record of a life which promised to his parents honors and length of days.\n\nWilliam was a fine, stout, healthy lad. He was taken with a slight fever on the Atlantic, having but recently left his father's camp on the Big Black. He sank rapidly. Immediately on his father's arrival at Memphis, he was taken to the Gayoso House, and every attention paid him, but in vain. His mother, with her remaining children, had but a melancholy journey home with the remains of little William and his precious memory. The military and citizens were invited to accompany the remains as they were borne from the Gayoso House to the steamer War Eagle.

[Dallas Morning News, May 21, 1950; tr by AJ]\n\nEvelyn Widrick\n\nShe Died A Martyr\n\nMemphis July 27, 1879\n\nEditor's Appeal: It has happened more than once in the recent history of our unfortunate city that opportunity to do heroic work, and out of it to pass to the martyr's grave has been seized by many an obscure man or unknown woman of whom there is no earthly record beyond the mere name in the long death-list. True in 1873, it became more notably true in 1878 that the names of many of our best and truest are known to few, or it may be to none save God only. Of course, they are none the worse for this, but it is the misfortune of the living to be left without knowledge of any inspiring example.\n\nIt is with this feeling I wish to put on record a little note of such life and death. When the Tobin family, on Bradford Street, were seized with the fever, there was of course no provision for hired nurses, since no one looked for the fever so early in the season. Opposite to this family, on the same street, lived a young girl, about seventeen years old, named EVELYN WIDRICK, her father and little brother FREDDY being the only other members of the household. EVELYN had not had the fever, but she went to her neighbors in their distress and remained with them from the beginning to the fatal ending. Immediately after the last of the TOBINs were buried, the infection spread to the family of GODSEY, living next door to the WIDRICKs. Without having rested, Evelyn began duty there and nursed these young ladies with a skill far beyound her years. It was there last Sunday morning I first saw this dear child. I sent her relief and begged her to go to rest. Returning in the afternoon, I found the tireless girl still on duty and sharing the labor with the relief nurse. The same night the fever laid her prostate. Last night in her father's room he begged me to tell him how his dear child was. I could say no more than that she is resting - a truer word than he thought I meant, but tonight they both are resting in Elmnwood, where side by side we laid them today.
