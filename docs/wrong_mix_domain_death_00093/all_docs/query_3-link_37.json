        "text": "As of yesterday, June 22nd, 2020, the world has gone without hearing from one of its most important voices for 12 years. George Carlin, famed comedian, social critic, and philosopher died on that date in 2008, he was 71 years old.\n\nIt’s hard to fathom anyone who’s not familiar with his work but I’m sure within the younger generations you’ll run into people who either haven’t heard of George Carlin or only know his name (and voice) from his time on the children’s series, Thomas & Friends. Considering how long ago Carlin began his illustrious career and how long it lasted, this would be reasonable. It’s up to the rest of us to change that, however.\n\nI first became aware of George Carlin in the mid 1980s (I’m 47) and was never the same since. Every once in a while you’ll hear a piece of music, read a book, see a film, or hear someone speak and a lightbulb goes off. It hits you in a place you didn’t know you’d had, but it makes more sense to you than just about anything had before. In the case of Carlin, it wasn’t a lightbulb as much as it was a fucking explosion."
