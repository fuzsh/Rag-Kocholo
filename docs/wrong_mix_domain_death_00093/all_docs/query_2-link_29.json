        "text": "Carlin won four Grammy awards and was nominated for five Emmy awards\n\nGrammy-award winning comedian George Carlin, best known for his Seven Words You Can Never Say On TV routine, has died of heart failure aged 71.\n\nThe star was admitted to a hospital in Los Angeles on Sunday with chest pains and died later that day.\n\nJack Burns, Carlin's comedy partner in the early 1960s, told the Associated Press agency: \"He was a genius and I will miss him dearly.\"\n\nCarlin performed as recently as last weekend in Las Vegas.\n\nAnti-Establishment icon\n\nThe star, who had a history of heart problems, was scheduled to receive the John F Kennedy Center's prestigious Mark Twain Prize for American Humour in November.\n\nCarlin became known for his unpredictable performances and for pushing boundaries during his 50-year career.\n\nHe achieved status as an anti-Establishment icon in the 1970s with his provocative and controversial acts.\n\nHis Seven Words routine led to his arrest in 1972 for disturbing the peace after he performed the act at a show in Milwaukee.\n\nCarlin became known for his edgy and provocative performances\n\nThe same routine, which was played on a New York radio station, resulted in a Supreme Court ruling in 1978 upholding the government's authority to sanction stations for broadcasting offensive language.\n\nCarlin produced 23 comedy albums, 14 HBO specials, three books, a couple of TV shows and appeared in several movies.\n\nHe also hosted the first broadcast of Saturday Night Live, won four Grammy Awards - each for best spoken comedy album - and was nominated for five Emmys.\n\nDrug addiction plagued him for much of his life, beginning with marijuana experimentation as a teenager.\n\nDuring the 1970s he began using cocaine and prescription painkillers.\n\nHe racked up debt during that time and ended up owing about $3m in back taxes.\n\nIn 2004, he entered a Los Angeles rehab clinic for his alcohol and Vicodin abuse.\n\nCarlin is survived by his second wife Sally Wade; daughter Kelly Carlin McCall; and brother Patrick."
