I could think of no better way to introduce my newest blog category, Anomalous Insights, by remembering a man who made so many us laugh and helped us see the world through his eyes.\n\nThe following are a few quotes from Carlin’s “news” portions of his stand up acts. His unique creativity and randomness is expressed so well through these “anomalous” news jokes.\n\nA small town in Tennessee downwind from a nuclear plant believes it may\n\nhave received some radiation leakage. Everyone is dead, and the trees\n\nare humming.\n\nA man in Texas was arrested today for shooting and killing:\n\nhis wife, son, two daughters, his mother and father, all four of his\n\ngrandparents, his dog, his mailman, three neighbors, and a woman who\n\nworks at the filling station. He claims he was just cleaning his gun\n\nwhen it suddenly went off.\n\nHere are the results of the blind person’s golf tournament–they’ve\n\njust come in: the winner was Johnny Downing with 1,829 strokes, just\n\nenough to beat Larry Powell who lost any chance he might have had when\n\nhe took a 312 on the final hole.\n\nAn elderly couple, celebrating their 90th wedding anniversary, died of\n\nfright today at the beginning of a surprise party.\n\nA 66-year-old woman who was attempting to trot backwards from Winnipeg\n\nto Rio was killed today when she was hit by a truck, head-on, from the\n\nrear.\n\nA man who was attempting to walk around the world…drowned today.\n\nGeorge Carlin (1937 – 2008)"
