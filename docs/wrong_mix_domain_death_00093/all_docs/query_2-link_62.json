A diehard punk rocker and former award-winning competitive cheerleader, Shapel found ways to express himself and own his individuality at an early age. Shapel was cheerleading competitively for University of Louisville when someone dared him to take the stage as a comedian and he never looked back, dropping out shortly thereafter to pursue a career in stand-up full-time. His unique life experiences such as being adopted by a Caucasian family at age 15, his punk rock mentality, and his stage presence make for a truly original voice in the comedy community. Diligence and the desire to grow led Shapel from the Phoenix open mic circuit onto main stages, where he regularly performed for comedians such as Bill Burr, Hannibal Buress, and Brendan Schaub, and is now headlining clubs across the country. Shapel was selected to be a “New Face” at the 2019 Just For Laughs Comedy Festival.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nHost: Adam Pasi\n\nFeature: Lio K\n\nHeadliner: Lynette Manning\n\nLynette Manning is a comedian based out of Olympia, Washington and is the first female member of the comedy group U Got It Productions.

After spending much of his young life engaging in mostly non-violent criminal activity, Matt has dedicated the rest of his days toward the pursuit of peace and harmony. He has written two books, most notably his novel Overlook: A Story About Drugs, Disappointment, and the American Dream. He was also supposed to be on a local TV news show once, but they scrapped the segment.

Hofstetter has also appeared on CBS' \"Late Late Show With Craig Ferguson\", Showtime's \"White Boyz in the Hood\", VH1's \"Countdown\", Sundance's \"On the Road in America\", and ABC's \"Barbara Walter's Special\", where he thankfully did not cry. He is the host and executive producer of \"Laughs\" on Fox networks, where he only cries occasionally.\n\nOne of the top booked acts on the college circuit, the original writer for collegehumor.com has also released six albums. Hofstetter has written humor columns for the New York Times, SportsIllustrated.com, and NHL.com, where he publicly admitted to being a Ranger fan.\n\nAfter hosting Four Quotas on Sirius Satellite Radio for two seasons, Hofstetter moved to broadcast radio, and his Sports Minute (Or So) was syndicated on over 170 stations and in over 30 newspapers. Hofstetter's second live comedy album (\"Cure For the Cable Guy\") reached #20 on Billboard's comedy charts. His third album (\"Dark Side of the Room\") was the first ever pay-what-you-want\" comedy album, since people were going to steal it anyway. His fourth album consisted of an hour of 100% ad-libbed material, which is, frankly, nuts. And his fifth album hit #1 on iTunes' comedy charts, which is also a bit nuts.\n\nHofstetter's brutal tour schedule consists of over 100 colleges and dozens of clubs every year, and is fueled by an immense online popularity, tons of press, and a Prius with great gas mileage. He reached 200,000 friends on Facebook (still the world record), 400,000 more on MySpace, and high shelves in grocery stores.\n\nWhile Hofstetter's live shows are routinely sold out, he is best known for his writing, first published at age 15, mainly to impress girls. At 18, he co-founded \"Sports Jerk of the Week\", an irreverent website featured by press like USA Today's Baseball Weekly, Sports Illustrated and CNN. And at 20, Hofstetter took a year off of school to head up web content for the New York Yankees. The Yankees won the World Series that year, which would have been wonderful if they hadn't beaten Hofstetter's Mets. Yes, he's also a Mets fan. Poor kid.\n\nWhile an undergraduate at Columbia University, Hofstetter was a well-read columnist for the Columbia Daily Spectator and a voice of the Lions. After a summer writing for Maxim, ESPN, and Sports Illustrated for Kids, Hofstetter syndicated his column in several newspapers.\n\nWithout his glasses, Hofstetter also looks a great deal like Michael Rappaport.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons.\n\nSteven Ho is a retired ER tech who has found a new career path as a comedian. Originally from California, Ho spent over a decade working in emergency medicine, using his quick thinking and problem-solving skills to save lives and help those in need. However, Ho also had a passion for comedy and entertaining, and he began performing stand-up comedy in his free time.\n\nOver time, Ho’s comedy career began to take off, and he found himself booking more and more shows. Eventually, he made the difficult decision to retire from his work in the medical field and focus on his comedy full-time. He has since performed at comedy clubs and festivals all over the country.\n\nManagement reserves the right to prevent customers from entering the facility who they deem disruptive or dangerous to other patrons."
