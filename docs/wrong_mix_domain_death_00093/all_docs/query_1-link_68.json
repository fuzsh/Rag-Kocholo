        "text": "As I am sure you know, the House of Delegates approved a heavily amended UCITA bill. There seems to be a great deal of confusion regarding this amended version.\n\nThe House Subcommittee on Science and Technology held ten open public work session attended by both opponents and proponents of the bill. Many suggestions which came from these work sessions were incorporated into our final version.\n\nCurrently, there is no current federal or state statue that applies to computer software licensing. However, twelve court cases have upheld shrinkwrap licenses and there have been no court cases to the contrary since 1993. By passing UCITA, consumers will now be allowed to get their money back if the product does not work as advertised or was purchased in error even after having loaded on their computer. Our amended version of UCITA also makes it clear that Maryland consumer laws apply to consumer computer transactions. Specifically, the Maryland version of UCITA prohibits software licensors from modifying or disclaiming implied warranties of merchantability.\n\nCurrent law allows a company to disable software in home or business computers. Under UCITA, this practice is outlawed on home computers by our consumer protection laws and is heavily restricted in the commercial market.\n\nMany of those concerned about the bill believe it gives software vendors control over your files and data. Under our version of UCITA, your data is your property.\n\nThe provisions do not change the law with respect to copyrighting and reverse engineering. UCITA explicitly states that all aspects of federal copyright law govern computer information transactions. The legislation also makes it clear that state trade secret laws and unfair competition laws are in full force and not overridden by UCITA."
