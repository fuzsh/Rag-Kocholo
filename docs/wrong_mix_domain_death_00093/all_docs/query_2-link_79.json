        "text": "Comedian George Carlin died nearly two years ago, at the age of 71. Almost every elegy for him said, âHe is remembered mainly for his skit on the âSeven Dirty Words You Canât Say on Radio.ââ But I remember Carlin for a better bit.\n\nIâm not going to discuss his “Seven Dirty Words” routine â it seems a shame to have your lifeâs work reduced to seven profanities. Carlin was better than that.\n\nI believe Carlin was not only one of our funniest comics â which is, after all, the point of his profession â but also one of the most thoughtful, even insightful. I still use his comparison of baseball and football â and what they say about our society â when I teach my class on the history of college athletics.\n\nCarlin not only breaks down two of our most popular sports, he deftly demonstrates how they define fans as liberal or conservative, dove or hawk, Prius or Hummer.\n\nBut Iâll let the man speak for himself.\n\nBaseball is a nineteenth-century pastoral game. Football is a twentieth-century technological struggle.\n\nBaseball is played on a diamond, in a park. The baseball park! Football is played on a gridiron, in a stadium, sometimes called Soldier Field or War Memorial Stadium.\n\nBaseball begins in the spring! The season of new life! Football begins in the fall, when everything’s dying.\n\nFootball has hitting, clipping, spearing, piling on, personal fouls, late hitting and unnecessary roughness. Baseball has â¦ the sacrifice!\n\nBaseball has the seventh inning stretch. Football has the two minute warning.\n\nBaseball has no time limit. We don’t know when it’s gonna end! We might even have extra innings! Football is rigidly timed, and it will end even if we’ve got to go to sudden death.\n\nAnd finally, the objectives of the two games are completely different:\n\nIn football the object is for the quarterback, also known as the field general, to be on target with his aerial assault, riddling the defense by hitting his receivers with deadly accuracy in spite of the blitz, even if he has to use shotgun. With short bullet passes and long bombs, he marches his troops into enemy territory, balancing this aerial assault with a sustained ground attack that punches holes in the forward wall of the enemy’s defensive line.\n\nIn baseball the object is to go home! And to be safe! I hope I’ll be safe at home!\n\nNo sportswriter or professor or deep political thinker ever said it better.\n\nI thank him for that. And Iâd like to assume that George Carlin himself is now safe at home.\n\nAbout the author: John U.
