George Carlin was an American Comedian widely known for sharing his political opinions. I could think of no better way to introduce my newest blog category, Anomalous Insights, by remembering a man who made so many us laugh and helped us see the world through his eyes.

The following are a few quotes from Carlin’s “news” portions of his stand up acts. His unique creativity and randomness is expressed so well through these “anomalous” news jokes.

A small town in Tennessee downwind from a nuclear plant believes it may

have received some radiation leakage. Everyone is dead, and the trees

are humming.

A man in Texas was arrested today for shooting and killing:

his wife, son, two daughters, his mother and father, all four of his

grandparents, his dog, his mailman, three neighbors, and a woman who

works at the filling station. He claims he was just cleaning his gun

when it suddenly went off.

Here are the results of the blind person’s golf tournament–they’ve

just come in: the winner was Johnny Downing with 1,829 strokes, just

enough to beat Larry Powell who lost any chance he might have had when

he took a 312 on the final hole.

An elderly couple, celebrating their 90th wedding anniversary, died of

fright today at the beginning of a surprise party.

A 66-year-old woman who was attempting to trot backwards from Winnipeg

to Rio was killed today when she was hit by a truck, head-on, from the

rear.

A man who was attempting to walk around the world…drowned today.
