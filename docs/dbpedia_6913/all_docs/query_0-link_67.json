        "text": "HBO launches Portland campaign to change “The Weight of the Nation”\n\nPortland, May 1st. HBO held a kick-off an event at James John Elementary School on North Charleston Avenue as part of the May 14th premier of its four-part documentary series, “The Weight of the Nation”. At the event, the school’s wellness leader, Jane Harold, presented the Oregon Wellness Awards to Xitlalic Guzman and Cielo del Rosario James. HBO created the program in collaboration with Whole Kids Foundation and GLOBALTAP. John Elementary is one of many, in twelve cities across the nation, to receive salad bars and water taps in an effort to help combat childhood obesity.\n\nSupporters celebrated the healthy new cafeteria additions at the event and saw a screening of the upcoming HBO program. “The Weight of the Nation” premieres Monday, May 14th at 8PM. All of the documentaries will be made available in English and Spanish, and will stream free of charge on HBO.com.\n\nMany local community activists joined kids, including: School Board Director Gitta Grether-Sweeney, Nutrition Services Director Beth Shelby, Principal Joyce Dougherty, and Oregon Department of Education Child Nutrition Ann Goetze.\n\nFrom HBO: The campaign is tied to the premiere of HBO’s THE WEIGHT OF THE NATION, comprised of a four-part documentary series, a three-part series for families, 12 bonus shorts, and a nationwide community-based outreach campaign to support the initiative.

For some, it’s about love; for others, it’s about knowledge. For young Cristina, it’s about listening to her heart and finding her voice. Cristina is about to finish high school and go to college, and she needs all the support she can get. But her family is distracted by the technology of modern life, from cell phones and text messages to bills and budgets. They are all too busy to listen. But when Cristina enters a dream world, she encounters several familiar characters from Latino folklore — the jaguar, the armadillo, and the daughter of the Sun God, among others — who not only help her speak her mind, but give her the confidence to face her future.\n\nJARDÍN DE SUEÑOS\n\nWritten by Sofia May-Cuxim, based on text by Pablo Jiménez and Teatro Español, Directed by Nelda Reyes,\n\nSponsored by Sterling Savings Bank, Oregon Cultural Trust, National Endowment for the Arts, The Oregonian and the Consulate of Mexico in Portland\n\nPresented in Spanish with easy-to-follow supertitles in English\n\nWHEN: MARCH 22-APRIL 14, 2012 Thursdays at 7:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays at 8 p.m. Sundays at 2 p.m.\n\nWHERE: MILAGRO THEATRE, 525 SE Stark Street, Portland, Oregon 97214\n\nADMISSION: $10 – $29; discounts for students, seniors, groups of 15+ and advance purchases\n\nTickets can be purchased from on line or by calling 503-236-7253\n\nMORE INFORMATION: 503-236-7253 or http://www.milagro.org/\n\nFrom The Miracle Theatre Group: We offers you an experience unlike anything else around.
