        "text": "Big risks and adventurous friends: How composer Julia Wolfe became a renegade\n\nThe Pulitzer-winning, MacArthur \"genius\" co-founder of Bang on a Can looks for the grit in music, whether she's writing a string quartet or one of her history-based oratorios.\n\nNPR Music's Top 20 Songs Of March\n\nDua Lipa gave us a disco bop, Code Orange glitched its way through an industrial-metal anthem and Kelsea Ballerini offered a thoughtful country ballad about a divided America.\n\nReview\n\nDeceptive Cadence\n\nBang On A Can Plays Straight From The Heart (Literally)\n\nCPR Classical\n\nHear a new piece by Arcade Fire's Richard Reed Parry that pulsates in time to the heartbeats of the musicians who play it.\n\nBang On A Can Plays Straight From The Heart (Literally)\n\n5:08\n\nA Dark But Redeeming Tour Of Coal Country, With Composer Julia Wolfe\n\nWolfe has just released the recording of Anthracite Fields, which won the 2015 Pulitzer for music. The piece is based on the knotty history of coal-mining families in her home state of Pennsylvania.\n\nA Dark But Redeeming Tour Of Coal Country, With Composer Julia Wolfe\n\nListen · 8:38 8:38\n\nReview\n\nDeceptive Cadence\n\nSongs We Love: Bang On A Can, 'An Open Cage'\n\nFlorent Ghys' An Open Cage springs from a recording of the maverick composer reading an excerpt from his Diary: How to Improve the World (You Will Only Make Matters Worse).\n\nSongs We Love: Bang On A Can, 'An Open Cage'\n\n4:08\n\nJulia Wolfe Wins Music Pulitzer For 'Anthracite Fields'\n\nThe composer is the second from the New York music collective Bang on a Can to win the award with a choral work. Her oratorio explores the lives of coal miners and their families a century ago.\n\nAnthracite Fields - 'Flowers' (performed by the Bang on a Can All-Stars and the Choir of Trinity Wall Street)\n\n6:00\n\nWatch Bang On A Can Occupy 'Arthur'\n\nBecause why shouldn't Julia Wolfe and David Lang be bringing the Bang on a Can All-Stars to Arthur? Watch this short and totally charming clip.\n\nNPR Classical's Favorite Albums Of 2012 (So Far)\n\nThe NPR Classical team discusses and spins a variety of favorite new discs and downloads.\n\nNPR Classical's Favorite Albums Of 2012 (So Far)\n\nListen · 39:42 39:42\n\nReview\n\nDeceptive Cadence\n\nA Quarter-Century Of Banging, And Still As Fresh As Ever\n\nThe venerable new music collective celebrates its 25th anniversary with a free double CD.\n\nSteve Reich: Music We Love\n\nQ2\n\nTo celebrate the composer's 75th birthday, we've invited musicians who have collaborated with Reich as well as NPR friends to reflect on the pieces they adore.\n\nFirst Listen: Steve Reich, 'Double Sextet, 2x5'\n\nQ2\n\nThe composer's innovations have been distilled and polished to a new, compelling sheen in the Pulitzer Prize-winning Double Sextet and the new, rock-inflected 2x5. Hear both works here until they're released on Sept. 14.\n\nEasy Listening For Uneasy Listeners\n\nWork is nothing more than eight hours of stress, with a lunch break in the middle. You find it's getting easier than ever to fly off the handle, even when the cause is as benign as a lack of hazelnut creamer in the coffee line. Don't reach for the Alka-Seltzer or Prozac. Instead, these five tunes will ease your toughest day on the job just fine."
