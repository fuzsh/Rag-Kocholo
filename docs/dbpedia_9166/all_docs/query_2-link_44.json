        "text": "The Universe is a simple place. Vast stretches of space filled with nothingness. Yet as it developed over billions of years, it grew increasingly complex. This is a central concept Big History will emphasize — the ever-increasing complexity of the Universe.\n\nAnother central theme in Big History is \"Goldilocks Conditions.\" Big History uses this concept to describe when the right conditions occur at precisely the right time to trigger a form of fundamental change.\n\nTaking a look at these changes through the widest possible lens, Big History offers an understanding of where we came from, where we're going, and the complexity and fragility of our world.\n\nAdopted from the story of Goldilocks and the Three Bears, Goldilocks Conditions are when conditions are \"just right\" for something new and more complex to emerge.\n\nTry to imagine something unimaginably tiny, unimaginably dense, and unimaginably hot. Then instantaneously, bang! — space, time, and all molecular material explode in a manner far beyond what words can describe.\n\nWhat is known is that, within a few millionths of a second, the Universe expanded at an inconceivable speed. From that expansion, some recognizable subatomic particles and fundamental forces formed. Then the Universe cooled dramatically — to about 1 billion degrees Celsius, allowing energy, and then matter, to appear. Much later, after dropping to a cool 1,650 degrees, the first hydrogen and helium atoms formed.\n\nA cosmic \"Dark Ages\" set in for the next 200 million years. This quiet expansion spread more complex atoms and other materials throughout the Universe. The tiny particles drifted apart like a dense puff of smoke, but not uniformly. Those little inconsistencies of distance set the stage for gravity, creating something very complex out of something very simple.\n\nIt took decades from the time a few scientists proposed that the Universe was expanding until the point where the Big Bang hypothesis was generally accepted. More proof was needed. In Big History, we call this process of gathering evidence that supports a theory or idea \"claim testing.\"\n\nWhen the theory of an expanding Universe was first proposed by Georges Lemaître in the 1920s even the great physicist Einstein did not believe it. In 1929, astronomer Edwin Hubble made observations from a powerful telescope showing that galaxies sped away from each other at an ever-increasing velocity. Still, many scientists refuted the idea.\n\nIn 1964, two scientists in New Jersey, Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson, aimed a new, extra-sensitive radio antenna at outer space to discover what they could hear. They were surprised to hear the same low, static hiss wherever they aimed it. They were baffled.\n\nFinally, a colleague at Princeton suggested the hiss might have something to do with the start of the Universe. He pointed them to mathematical calculations by astrophysicists that showed if the Universe did, in fact, begin with a Big Bang, it would have released a huge amount of energy in just the same frequency as this low, static hiss. In this way, scientists discovered evidence and claim tested the Big Bang.\n\nWhen stars are born in nebulae, lighting up in fusion, they will race through life. Some will be lucky to reach a few billion or trillion years of age. The heaviest and densest of these will die in massive supernova explosions. Others, like our Sun, will burn more slowly, and probably expire less dramatically. Upon a star's death, matter will spill out into space in the form of new elements, creating new star-forming nebulae, continuing its circle of life.\n\nTiny imperfections. Little knots, wrinkles, and flaws will begin attracting nearby particles of matter. The clumps will grow, becoming more massive, and attracting more particles.\n\nAs these compacted clumps of hydrogen and helium grow in density, they'll also heat up. Eventually, the clumps heat and compact to form a \"plasma,\" sort of a hot, swirling soup made up of free-floating atomic nuclei. This will form into giant balls called \"protostars.\"\n\nGravity squeezes the center of the protostars tighter and tighter. Their temperature rockets until they reach a flash point. And they \"light up\" as free-floating nuclei, slamming together with such intensity that they fuse into a new element. This process of \"nuclear fusion\" releases a tremendous amount of energy, presenting the Universe with a new complexity that is critical to the formation of galaxies, larger clusters, and superclusters.\n\nThree centuries after Isaac Newton watched an apple fall from a tree to the earth, we are still trying to completely comprehend the nature of gravity.\n\nEssentially, as Newton's equation put it, two masses — whether apple and Earth, Moon and Earth, or two tiny particles that happen to be near each other — exert an attractive gravitational force on each other.\n\nAlso, the larger and denser an object is, the stronger the gravitational pull it exerts on another object. The massive Earth pulls your smaller body mass to it. This gravitational pull prevents you from floating off into space. At the same time, the mass of your body, as Newton described, is actually exerting a tiny gravitational pull on Earth.\n\nA fundamental force in the Universe\n\nIn his great scientific work, Newton asserted the three Laws of Motion, elaborated on Johannes Kepler's Laws of Motion, and stated the Law of Universal Gravitation — all of which were giant leaps in human understanding of Earth and the cosmos.\n\nNewton's Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy\n\nStars are very hungry. Burning at incredible levels, cranked to the extreme, a star will eventually consume all the hydrogen that powers its nuclear fusion. Then the star changes dramatically. The hot center shrinks. It grows even hotter. This intense heat and pressure creates other nuclear reactions, producing new, heavier elements — carbon, silicon, oxygen, and others, until it creates iron. Iron is heavy, highly stable, and cannot be fused further.\n\nA catastrophic event begins. Lacking the outpouring of energy from its core, the star collapses. Its many outer layers fall inwards, in an enormous unbelievable avalanche of matter crumbling due to the pull of gravity from the dense core. They slam with unimaginable force into the star's iron center, creating new elements. These new elements bounce off the iron core, hurtling outwards into space.\n\nThis is, in effect, the massive explosion and death of a star — a supernova — and the birth of new elements out into the cosmos.\n\nNew stars shining in the Universe did not happen overnight. It would take many elements coming together, over time, building until they could prove their light in the darkness of space. In many ways, our collective learning follows a similar pattern.\n\nIdeas and knowledge accumulate. Generation after generation, humans build upon the information on hand. First, Chinese astronomers in 185 BCE and Islamic astronomers in 1006 had recorded sudden, bright stars that lasted for a brief time and faded away. Weather observers in Italy, China, and Korea observed another of these brilliant objects In 1604. Then after a yearlong observation, Johannes Kepler, an astronomer in Prague, would publish a treatise, undermining an age-old theory of the Universe — and also proving crucial to the development of modern chemistry."
