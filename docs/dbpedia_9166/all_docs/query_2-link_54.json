        "text": "What is REAL ID?\n\nThe REAL ID Act establishes minimum security standards for state-issued driver licenses and ID cards. Starting May 7, 2025, anyone traveling by airplane or visiting certain federal facilities must use a REAL ID-compliant document.\n\nYou may already have what you need\n\nThese identification options meet REAL ID standards and can be used to board domestic flights:\n\nEnhanced Driver License (EDL)\n\nEnhanced Identification Card (EID)\n\nU.S. Military ID\n\nU.S. Passport\n\nU.S. Passport Card\n\nPermanent Resident Card (Green Card)\n\nFederally recognized tribal-issued photo ID\n\nU.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services Employment Authorization Card (I-766)\n\nForeign Passport\n\nSee the full list of documents accepted for air travel.\n\nStandard driver licenses and ID cards\n\nYes, we'll continue to offer standard driver licenses and ID cards that can be used by Washington residents to drive or as identification. They don't indicate a person's residency or legal status and starting May 7, 2025, they will no longer be accepted as valid forms of ID for boarding domestic flights.\n\nEnhanced driver license (EDL) and enhanced identification (EID)\n\nAn EDL or EID is a form of identification with enhanced security features that shows proof of identity and proof of citizenship. An EDL/EID meets federal requirements under REAL ID and is an approved alternative to a passport or passport card for re-entry into the U.S. at land and sea borders between the United States, Canada, Mexico, Bermuda, and the Caribbean.\n\nWho can get an EDL or EID?\n\nYou must be a U.S. citizen and provide a Social Security number, proof of citizenship, proof of identity, and proof of Washington State residency.\n\nDo I have to get an EDL or EID?\n\nIf you don't plan to fly domestically, or already have acceptable identity documents, you may not need an EDL or EID. The standard license will continue to permit you to drive and your standard ID will continue to serve as a valid form of identification within the state.\n\nWashington’s EDL/EID doesn’t have a star marking. Will it be accepted?\n\nThe enhanced driver license/ID is Washington’s REAL ID-compliant form of identification. Many other states have chosen to offer a REAL ID card with a star marking. The EDL/EID bears a U.S. flag marking instead of a star. For domestic air travel, the EDL/EID and REAL ID card are equally acceptable.\n\nDriver licenses and ID cards that don't comply with REAL ID\n\nA standard Washington driver license or ID card does not meet the federal requirements to be a REAL ID-approved document. We started marking standard driver licenses and ID cards with \"Federal limits Apply\" in July 2018 to show this."
