        "text": "When the composers’ collective Bang on a Can alighted on the scene 30 years ago, one of its defining qualities was volume. Amplified to exuberant rock-music levels, works by its founding members, David Lang, Julia Wolfe and Michael Gordon, typically featured a novel mix of electric guitars and traditional orchestral instruments. So it was a funny coincidence that these composers’ microphones malfunctioned at the start of an onstage discussion at Zankel Hall on Wednesday.\n\nThe first question, posed by Steve Reich — the evening was part of “Three Generations,” a series of concerts he has programmed exploring Minimalism’s legacy — was almost inaudible.\n\n“When you’re younger, you’re closer to chaos,” Mr. Lang answered, as technicians fiddled with the sound. “Now I move slower. I’ve got kids, I have health insurance.”\n\nUnplugged, soft-spoken and unchaotic — parents now, rather than children — is a good summary of the Bang on a Can founders these days, even as their energy is undimmed. Their work, once punkishly outsiderish, is now showered with mainstream accolades. Mr. Lang and Ms. Wolfe have both won the Pulitzer Prize in the past decade; Ms. Wolfe has added to it a MacArthur Fellowship.\n\nThe shifts in their styles — toward a greater restraint, and perhaps even maturation — were obvious from the earlier works performed on Wednesday by the Bang on a Can All-Stars ensemble. Mr. Lang’s Pulitzer, for example, came in 2008 for his quietly chilling “Little Match Girl Passion,” an ethereal cantata light years removed from his brake-drum-clanging “cheating, lying, stealing,” from 1995, performed with raucous verve at Zankel.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
