The magazine was pointing out a major moment in the festival’s history: that season, what had begun as a quirky, do-it-yourself marathon of contemporary music in downtown New York was now playing a run of concerts at Lincoln Center and releasing an album on the major label Sony Classical. Bang on a Can’s remarkable growth in the early 1990s—as it expanded with an in-house ensemble and collaborations with major classical music organizations, its budget grew by more than twentyfold––can be traced to the entrepreneurial ingenuity of its three founding composers. But it was also a result of significant structural shifts: a “marketplace turn” in American new music in the late twentieth century, in which institutions and musicians came to believe that the survival of contemporary composition depended on reaching a broad, non-specialist audience. A reversal of Cold War-era attitudes, the marketplace turn profoundly reshaped the institutional landscape for the American avant-garde: the granting organization Meet the Composer facilitated contact between composers and the public; government funders like the New York State Council on the Arts encouraged grantees to focus on audience outreach; presenters like Lincoln Center saw contemporary music as a means to attract new ticket buyers; and the record industry looked to new music as an opportunity to amass profits. In this talk, I trace Bang on a Can’s expansion in this period, as it traipsed through these developments and found new ways to grow the listenership for contemporary composition.\n\n12 February 2021 at 11:30am ET. “Bang on a Can and New Music’s Marketplace Turn.” University of Iowa; details here.\n\n18 February 2021 at 4:30pm ET. “Bang on a Can and New Music’s Marketplace Turn.” Eastman School of Music; details and Zoom link here.\n\n24 February 2021 at 7pm ET.

(Not given due to coronavirus pandemic.)\n\n“Are you apprehensive about what the politics of ‘multiculturalism’ is going to mean to the future of our civilization?” asked a 1990 mailer for The New Criterion. The neoconservative journal was seeking out new subscribers amidst the Culture Wars, a referendum on the role of government funding of the arts. And though the focal point of right-wing ire was visual artists like Robert Mapplethorpe, the Culture Wars and conservative attacks on multiculturalism had significant consequences for American composition, which have not yet been scrutinized by scholars.\n\nThis paper examines how the Culture Wars were refracted in new music, through an analysis of a major debate around the New York State Council for the Arts. In the early 1990s, the Council introduced program guidelines advocating for grantees to take a multicultural and audience-focused approach, which incited indignation among musicians such as the neoconservative composer Charles Wuorinen. Drawing on archival research, interviews, and reception, I trace how these changes in government funding shaped the differing fates of two new-music institutions: the decline of the Group for Contemporary music, a pioneering ensemble co-founded by Wuorinen that emerged during the ’60s wave of funding for academic new music; and the ascent of Bang on a Can, a market- and multicultural- friendly organization that expanded dramatically in the early ’90s. Examining the intertwined paths of these two institutions, I argue, reveals the decline of Cold War logics that shaped midcentury American modernism and the rise of a marketplace turn in American composition.\n\n13–15 March 2020. “Bang on a Can and New Music America: Competing Festival Visions for Contemporary Music.” Music Festival Studies: Current Perspectives, Future Directions, MIT. (Not given due to coronavirus pandemic.)\n\n“These impresarios have an insight, a point of view, a vision,” the Village Voice critic Kyle Gann wrote of the recently-established Bang on a Can festival in 1989. “BoaC isn’t splintered by the favors to repay, the factions to satisfy, that have diluted New Music America and made it so disappointing (if necessary).” In the late 1980s, contemporary music was divided into two festival experiences in the United States: the upstart Bang on a Can, a twelve-hour marathon concert held in downtown New York since 1987; and the establishment New Music America, a massive, multi-day endeavor that rotated between major cities since 1979. These two festivals offered competing visions in a moment of transition for American new music.\n\nDrawing on archival research, interviews, and reception, this paper compares three key aspects of the festivals circa 1989, when both were held in New York. First, I consider how they offered different definitions of “new music” as a genre: New Music America represented a scene of experimental improvisers and composer-performers that critic John Rockwell dubbed a “post-literate vanguard,” whereas Bang on a Can advocated for composers who wrote conventionally notated works for virtuoso classical musicians. Second, I compare the distinct “festival cultures” each institution provided: New Music America dispersed its offerings over many events in multiple venues, thus fragmenting its audience, whereas Bang on a Can empathically sought to create a singular audience experience through its marathon format. Finally, I examine the governance of each festival: the nimble Bang on a Can was run out of the kitchens of three young composers (Gann’s “point of view”) whereas New Music America was organized by a rotating committee and attendant bureaucracy that served many constituencies (Gann’s “factions to satisfy”). The success of Bang on a Can, which grew into a multi-million-dollar organization in the 1990s, alongside the decline of New Music America, which held its final iteration in 1990, reveals how different festival formats structured contemporary music at the close of the twentieth century.\n\n20–21 March 2020. “Multiculturalism, New Music, and the Culture Wars.” Keynote, AMS South Central Chapter, Georgia Highlands College (Not given due to coronavirus pandemic.)\n\n8 March 2020. “Multiculturalism, Neoconservatism, and New Music’s Marketplace Turn amidst the Culture Wars.” Keynote, Rutgers University Musicological Society (RUMS) Graduate Student Music Conference.\n\n21 February 2020. “Multiculturalism, Neoconservatism, and New Music’s Marketplace Turn amidst the Culture Wars.” Bowling Green State University.\n\n1 November 2019. “‘There’s Money in New Music’: Bang on a Can and the Post-Górecki Record Industry in the 1990s.” American Musicological Society national conference, Boston.\n\n29 May 2019. “‘There’s Money in New Music’: Bang on a Can and the Post-Górecki Record Industry in the 1990s.” University of Chicago.\n\n“The classical-record industry has made a startling discovery,” proclaimed New York Magazine in March 1994. “There’s money in new music.” An unforeseen, smash hit success had ignited the revelation: Nonesuch’s 1992 recording of the Henryk Górecki’s Symphony No. 3, which would ultimately sell a million records. In response, RCA/BMG, Philips, and Sony all launched their own contemporary music lines. For the classical industry, Górecki’s Third participated in the same phenomenon as crossovers like the “Three Tenors,” projects aimed towards yielding substantive profits amidst a landscape of corporate consolidation and declining CD sales. One beneficiary of this moment was the upstart composer collective Bang on a Can, which netted a major contract with Sony Classical in 1995.\n\nThis paper reveals, first, how recordings of contemporary music in the U.S. transitioned from a non-commercial service for composers in the 1980s into a potentially profit-making enterprise in the 1990s and, second, how Bang on a Can used the recorded medium to strongly assert its institutional identity in this newly speculative marketplace. I trace the history of Bang on a Can on record, from its early participation in Composer Recordings Inc.’s edgy imprint Emergency Music; through its two Sony albums; to its reinterpretation of Brian Eno’s Music for Airports; and, finally, to the founding of its own independent label, Cantaloupe Music. More broadly, I argue that this new dialogue between contemporary music and the record industry presents a clear example of how neoliberalism transformed new music in the United States. Just as Congress was arguing over whether the National Endowment for the Arts should be eliminated and American artists left to compete in the free market, major record labels were newly extracting profits from a traditionally non-profit sector.\n\n4 April 2019. “‘There’s Money in New Music’: Bang on a Can and the Post-Górecki Record Industry in the 1990s.” Wesleyan University.\n\n1 March 2019. “Public Musicology and Public Writing.” Public Intellectuals in A Changing World, Oberlin Center for Languages and Cultures, Oberlin College.\n\n28 February 2019. “‘There’s Money in New Music’: Bang on a Can and the Post-Górecki Record Industry in the 1990s.” Oberlin College Conservatory.\n\n18 November 2018. “Training Musicians Today, Tomorrow and Beyond.” Panel participant, National Association of Schools of Music Annual Meeting, Washington, DC.\n\n1 November 2018.

These ensembles had first formed at universities in the 1960s and early 1970s, in the midst of a Sputnik-era wave of funding directed towards specialized musical research and, by the 1980s, were a central part of new-music culture. But around the turn of the 1990s such legacy groups suffered significant losses of revenue, as non-profit funders expressed new concerns about their inability to attract audiences. At the same time, in 1992, the composer collective Bang on a Can launched its All-Stars, a touring group that played rock-inflected music and was marketed deliberately to capture new listeners. A close study of the origins of the Bang on a Can All-Stars unveils the complex relationship between audience building, publicity, and funding among new-music ensembles in this period. And despite its spiritual indebtedness to downtown groups like the Philip Glass Ensemble and Steve Reich and Musicians, the All-Stars––overseen by composers Michael Gordon, David Lang, and Julia Wolfe but comprising freelance musicians who had little input into the ensemble’s decisions––re-inscribed traditional composer-performer hierarchies. The All-Stars dressed like a rock band but behaved like a traditional classical ensemble, providing a “cool” repackaging of the enduring ontology of composer, performer, and notated musical work. Their ascent as established groups like Speculum Musicae declined reveals how the marketplace in the 1990s increasingly prized such attempts to revamp familiar classical music tropes in order to reach new publics.\n\n27 September 2018.
