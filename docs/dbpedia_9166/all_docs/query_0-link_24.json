        "text": "Eleonore Oppenheim soundchecking at Drom (Photo courtesy of Ashley Bathgate)\n\nAshley Bathgate, cello\n\nEleonore Oppenheim, bass viol\n\nDrom, NYC\n\nSunday, September 8th, 2013\n\nI was really thrilled to check out a brilliant pair of post-minimal string music sets from Bang On a Can All-Stars’ Ashley Bathgate and Victoire’s Eleonore Oppenheim at the Lower East Side venue Drom this past Sunday night. The two string soloists are both very talented artists in their field, both as members of their respective ensembles as well as solo artists, not to mention that they are both also founding members of the group Bonjour (also scheduled to appear soon at Drom) with fellow bassist Florent Ghys.\n\nHaving a solo set each, Ashley’s set launched with Icelandic composer Daniel Bjarnason’s 3-movement piece Bow To String, with the ambient textures typical of the sound of Bedroom Community combined with the grittiness of Ashley’s downtown influences.\n\nThe soundbite-threaded mania of Yoav Shemesh’s “Empty City” was a big jolt, reminiscent of some of the best music of Jacob TV.\n\nBill Ryan’s “Simple Lines” and Jacob Cooper’s “Arches” both beautifully rounded out Bathgate’s set.\n\nWith her own selected stock projection of vintage b&w footage, Eleonore’s set began with my favorite moment of the evening: Ashley joining her onstage for Oppenheim’s own arrangement of Bjork’s “Pleasure Is All Mine”. The two artists’ performance of this work definitely made me want to see this kind of duo on a more regular basis.\n\nFlorent Ghys’ “Crocodile” was a delight of stereophonic clanging. Angelica Negron’s “La Isla Magica” and Jenny Olivia Johnson’s “Home” were two more sonic works of new music industrialism.\n\nBoth these artists were at their peak on this evening. I definitely love to come to NY to hear these great people, and I was very thrilled to see Eleonore for the first time solo, as I love her work in both Victoire and Bonjour.\n\nAshley Bathgate ~ Cello\n\nEleonore Oppenheim ~ Bassist\n\nBang On a Can All-Stars at Rite of Summer Festival on Governors Island–Photo courtesy of Reilly Graham\n\nRite of Summer Festival\n\npresents\n\nBang On a Can All-Stars\n\nGovernors Island, NYC\n\nSaturday, July 13, 2013\n\nI have never been to Governors Island (at least I don’t think I have in many years–something about it seemed familiar to me), and I basically was walking towards the side of the island where I believed the site of the Rite of Summer concert was going on. I felt worried when I saw a tent area that sort of looked like a stage-area with no people, thinking I’d traveled all the way to the island to find a canceled show, but after hearing the strains of a distorted cello in the distance…I KNEW that was our show! I kept walking and found the Bang On a Can All-Stars set underway.\n\nI’m very glad that I was familiar with Michael Gordon’s “Industry”, and Ashley Bathgate being given a rare solo moment in the band’s set was exciting to see. To hear such a furiously-played amplified piece for electro-acoustic cello in an outdoor concert definitely made me think of Hendrix at Woodstock. As the rest of the group took the stage, guitarist Mark Stewart, who was making the announcements between the pieces, wondered aloud “If Jimi played the cello…”\n\nThe rest of the prepared first set went equally as well with some more All-Stars classics–David Lang’s “Sunray” (written for his father’s 80th birthday), Julia Wolfe’s “Lick” (designed after a funky James Brown piece in the way Julia Wolfe does it) and Louis Andriessen’s “Worker’s Union” (perhaps its most intense performance ever). The group, even with 2 people subbing for Robert Black and Ken Thomson (Gregg August and Michael Lowernstern, respectively, and did so so effectively that I hadn’t even noticed those guys weren’t there) and the looming threat of a downpour as the sky was only giving us a partly sunny day–on top of this the band was working with generated electricity in the aftermath of the facility’s power source being jeopardized by Hurricane Sandy, and at one point the sound cut out, yet you could still hear them–There seemed to be nothing that would make these guys stop or slow down.\n\nAfter the break, there would have been a second set where the group was going to feature a Mark Stewart solo, repeat “Sunray” and “Lick” and wrap up the show with Thurston Moore’s “Stroking Piece #1” (Loved hearing that at 2012’s marathon), but during Mark Stewart’s solo performance of Steve Reich’s “Electric Counterpart”–replete with gorgeous looping effects on top of an already gorgeously-played guitar part, the rain creeped up on the event and finally managed to put a damper on it. Probably for the best since safety is the priority over the show (regardless of the “show must go on” credo), but the group definitely made the absolute best out of their circumstances and turned in some effectively executed repertoire for a summer concert.\n\nEven though they only feature a few concerts each summer, Rite of Summer is a really good festival that brings new music performances to both the fans of the genre and the general public with some potential new fans.\n\nThere’s a couple more dates of Rite of Summer if you would like to check it out:\n\nSaturday, August 10th 1pm & 3pm (raindate August 11th):\n\nAn Homage to Stravinsky’s Rite of Spring: Ljova and Friends/Fireworks Ensemble\n\nSunday, September 1st 12pm-5pm (raindate September 2nd):\n\nRITE-A-THON: Blair McMillen, Pam Goldberg, Tigue, Theo Bleckmann, Classical Jam and more\n\nBang On a Can.org\n\nRite of Summer.com\n\nBang On a Can All-Stars performing at the Bang On a Can Marathon at Pace University (Photo courtesy of Glenn Cornett)\n\nArts Brookfield\n\nin cooperation with River To River Festival and Pace University\n\npresent\n\n2013 Bang On a Can Marathon\n\nMichael Schimmel Center at Pace University, NYC\n\nSunday, June 16th, 2013\n\nOk, well here we go again!\n\nAnother amazing day of polarizing music from Bang On a Can went down this past Sunday, but I need to get something off my chest first–I did not like the change of venue. It was too intimate. I guess I’m spoiled by the gorgeously expansive Winter Garden at the World Financial Center, but sadly the garden just had to be scheduled for renovation for the planned duration of the marathon, so the Michael Schimmel Center for The Arts at Pace University was chosen for this year’s show. People were saying that this venue had nice acoustics, and suited quieter pieces like Hans Abrahamsen’s Schnee (performed here delicately and briskly by Talea Ensemble; mind you, a very challenging piece for first timers as it’s a hour in length) but there was something intense about heavy artsy culture being plopped into the laps of mainstream New Yorkers that I sort of missed from the WFC shows. Continue reading →\n\nThis photo is from another performance by Bang On a Can All-Stars\n\nBang On a Can All-Stars\n\nperforms Field Recordings\n\nRegina A. Quick Center for The Arts at Fairfield University\n\nFairfield, CT\n\nSaturday, January 26th, 2013\n\nI was very happy that the Bang On a Can All-Stars came to Connecticut to perform the multimedia project Field Recordings–Honestly, I was quite happy they came here to play, period! It’s my first experience seeing them outside of the more-familiar stomping ground, the Winter Garden at the World Financial Center, and to see them on a stage with projection and playing an uninterrupted set of music was the way to really experience them. But, I was sad that the turnout wasn’t better. It makes me feel that portions of the country are not ready for this kind of music, and that’s a shame. They have no idea what they’re missing.\n\nThe cycle Field Recordings (all with the running theme of found sounds) is actually made up of nine separate pieces by nine different composers, and the opening piece “Reeling” by Julia Wolfe is a very uplifting and lively reel that is written on the vocals of a French-Canadian singer named Benoit Benoit–A rather fluid-but-crisp vocalist whose clip Julia based the piece around, and his voice here assumes the role of a folk banjo or fiddle. The active snapping the band does along with the wild but linear dialogue of the instruments are very exciting and help to make the piece set such a wonderful tone for the rest of the program.

Vierk‘s “Go Guitars”) was a very Jandek-like detuned dirge that proceeded to make the 2 elderly women sitting next to me get up and leave. At least I knew I was at the right concert.\n\nThis is not a review, per se. I had no real plans to cover this event with any kind of extensive blogging or descriptive reviews, but, even though I was only there for 8 of the 12 hours (Ugh! Long story why I couldn’t be there for all of it–Don’t get me started!), there’s so much beauty to observe, that I can’t not write something.
