        "text": "Time and Location\n\nMay 3rd, 8pm\n\nRoulette Intermedium\n\nBrooklyn, NY\n\nAbout\n\nRyuichi Sakamoto “was arguably the best-known and most successful Japanese musician in the world.” (Peter Tasker, Nikkei Asia) He won an Oscar for his soundtrack to Bernardo Bertolucci’s “The Last Emperor” and several Golden Globes and Grammy awards and nominations for other films. In 1992, he scored the opening ceremony of the Barcelona Olympics, conducting the orchestra while a billion people watched.\n\nSakamoto’s film scores are renowned for their diversity and sensitivity and now the Bang on a Call All-Stars realize their own new live arrangements of the album 1996 — which includes an incredible selection of many of Sakamoto’s most well-known tracks.\n\nThe Bang on a Can All-Stars play Ryuichi Sakamoto is an exploration, a tribute, a celebration.\n\nFor more information and tickets, please visit: Ryuichi Sakamoto\n\nThis event is supported through the JFNY Grant for Arts and Culture."
