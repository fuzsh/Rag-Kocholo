Bang on a Can All-Stars is a band that performed in Elwood City. They released the album Big Beautiful Dark and Scary.[1]

Muffy and Francine went to their concert and shared a copy of their music with Arthur, Binky, and Buster. Binky was inadvertently inspired to compose experimental music of his own after hearing theirs.[1]

The band visited Lakewood Elementary School on Francine's invitation, after Principal Haney let them rehearse in the music classroom.[1]

The band members are Julia (the composer), a clarinetist, a cellist, a bassist, a pianist, a drummer, and a guitarist.
