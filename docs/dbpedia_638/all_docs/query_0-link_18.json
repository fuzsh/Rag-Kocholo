        "text": "1 My diary\n\nI am a very organised person and couldn’t live without my diary which goes everywhere with me.\n\nEach year I treat myself to a Smythson Soho diary which effectively becomes my mobile office.\n\nI have everything in there from the kids’ schedules to my latest to-do list and there is a pocket at the back where I keep photos and letters from friends.\n\nI know that these days a lot of people use their phones to record their appointments but I am not keen on the idea of a gadget beeping at me every time I’m supposed to be doing something. What I love about my diary is its simplicity as the second I open it my whole day suddenly makes sense.\n\n2 Chocolate Buttons\n\nGraham and I are confirmed chocoholics and I was heartened to read there is now evidence to suggest chocolate might be good for you.\n\nIn my opinion the pressure to be skinny has gone too far and the odd indulgence isn’t a bad thing. Besides a life without chocolate would be very sad. My favourite treat is a couple of chocolate buttons with a cup of coffee and I always make sure there are some in the house.\n\nI also love Easter eggs. My children learned at an early age to hide their chocolate stash from me.\n\n3 Birthday DVD\n\nI wasn’t keen on the idea of turning 40 and I certainly didn’t want to throw a big party to celebrate my coming of age.\n\nGraham seemed to understand and the present he gave me turned a birthday I was dreading into something really special.\n\nOn the day itself he presented me with a DVD of my whole life up until that point. He had spent three months making the film and while I thought he had been working late and brokering a deal he had actually been compiling my present. Graham had got hold of cine film from my childhood and it was wonderful to see myself as a little girl again with my grandparents and other important people in my life who have since passed away.\n\nThere was footage from our wedding 24 years ago which included film of me with my father Bryan while Graham had also incorporated our first moments with both Lily and Sam.\n\nToday the DVD is one of my most treasured possessions and whenever friends come to stay I will get my birthday DVD out and force them to watch it with me.\n\n4 Fresh flowers\n\nI am not much of a gardener as I don’t have the patience to wait around for things to grow. Instead I crave the instant gratification of fresh flowers.\n\nI particularly love the colour and drama of orchids and I also adore lilies and tulips.\n\n5 Sunshine\n\nI was meant to live in a hot country as I absolutely adore the sun and sometimes find England’s relentlessly grey skies depressing. If I could, I would live in a permanent heatwave and my favourite climate is that of Arizona or California as I love that dry, desert-like heat.\n\nThis winter we are off to Barbados and I can’t wait to see some proper sunshine. My friends complain I am a weather bore as I am always harping on about temperatures but the sun is integral to my happiness.\n\nIf it wasn’t for my children’s education and the fact my friends and family are all here, I would be off somewhere hot in a heartbeat.\n\nEmma Forbes has teamed up with Rachel’s organic dairy products for its “Moments” campaign which encourages people to take time out to reconnect with themselves.
