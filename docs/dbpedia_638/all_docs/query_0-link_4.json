That said, she certainly has made her own mark on television, mainly in children's programming.\n\nShe started off as the cookery expert on Going Live!, where she would try to get Phillip Schofield to bake something with hilarious consequences. She was carried over to Live and Kicking, this time as main presenter. She also presented the children's talk show Speakeasy for ITV.\n\nShe co-hosted Talking Telephone Numbers, again with Phillip Schofield, and later fronted Top Tip Challenge. Viewers in some ITV regions will also have seen her host three series of What's My Line?\n\nTrivia\n\nEmma co-wrote a cookery book called Take 3 Cooks - namely herself, her mother and her sister.\n\nShe appeared as a schoolgirl in the 1978 film International Velvet.\n\nBooks / Tapes\n\nEmma Forbes' \"Going Live!\" Cookbook\n\nContact\n\nFirst Artist Management, 3 Tenterden Street, London W1S 1TD\n\nWeb links\n\nIMDb entry\n\nFeedback"
