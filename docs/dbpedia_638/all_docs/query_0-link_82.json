        "text": "80% of working low-income adults want to attend school but cannot afford to.\n\nThatâs the result of a gnarly mix of systemic, incentive-driven problems that have stumped our best policymakers and most imaginative employers.\n\nWhile the rest scratched their heads, Rachel Romer stepped in and rolled up her sleeves. She founded Guild: a B Corp. tuition finance company that helps employers pay for employeesâ tuition.\n\nOur friends at Forbes cover Guildâs story - and the story of our work together - here.\n\nLondon, we heard you like tea.\n\nAt least, more than coffee for a Friday afternoon. So next week, Coffeehaus becomes Teahaus. We just did it in Ipanema, why not bring it to Shoreditch?\n\nWith our friends at Google Creative Lab, weâll be putting on tea, Pimms and good conversation all afternoon.\n\nLeland Maschmeyer and Brian Collins are in town joining the good people at D&AD for the D&AD Festival, where theyâll speak about transformation and design, and Brian will chair judging. We figured weâd stick around to hang with a few more Londoners before we left.\n\nFriday, May 24, 3-5pm.\n\nAfterwards, we wouldnât be surprised if we ended up at a pub.\n\nYou can RSVP, here. Spaces are limited.\n\nâThe instant you hear someone say âWhat is this ugly shit?â thatâs a signal that something promising is about to happen. It could even herald the emergence of a new world.\n\nThatâs been going on all over TikTok and YouTube lately. The kids there are beyond inspiring. Theyâre fashion designers, painters, skateboarders, coders, cooks, dancers, side hustlers, collaborators, demos, EPsâall messing around trying to figure it out. Thatâs where the energy isâat emerging edges of the arts and tech. AI is just fuel on that fireâ¦â\n\nRead on, here.\n\nWhen Freeform invited us to help them evolve their purpose and transform their brand, they made it clear they were committed to wholesale change.\n\nGame on.\n\nWe worked with the crew at Freeform to build a new brand platform and visual identity that walked us both right to the edge of what we knew and what we didnât.\n\nAnd we worked with the good, inventive people at Monotype to transform the original 1957 cut of Helvetica into something completely unexpected and dynamic.\n\nMichael Di Leo and Emily Sneddon took the stage at the Monotype-hosted Brand Talks conference to share how we did it with our friends at Disney.\n\nPlenty of us were in the crowd. And they both (unsurprisingly) crushed.\n\nYou can see the work, here. Which, by the way, Fast Company just included among the Best Work of the Year in their Innovation by Design Annual Issue.\n\nAnd again, bravo to our friends at Freeform.\n\nLove at first watch, indeed\n\nWe began our relationship with the remarkable people at Figma three years ago.\n\nWorking closely with their leaders, we set out to tell the world about a truth that history often hides: Nothing great is made alone.\n\nToday Fast Company named our efforts together the Best Brand Work of the Year.\n\nGood clients = good work.\n\nBravo, all.\n\nStory here.\n\nAt COLLINS, we believe the spaces we work from profoundly inform how we create within them.\n\nIn the words of Anne-Marie Willis, the acclaimed architect, researcher and writer, âWe design our world, while our world acts back on us and designs us.â\n\nOur friends at Thiel Architecture + Design helped us imagine and build our offices just off of Union Square years ago. Then they helped us do it again and we created our new Brooklyn clubhouse built for a new, remote-first world.\n\nWe could not love it more.\n\nWeâre also thrilled The American Institute of Architects like it, too. They honored it with their award of excellence for interior architecture of the year.\n\nFrankly, we think they just liked all the books."
