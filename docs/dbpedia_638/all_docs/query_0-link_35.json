Beginning her writing career in the 1970s, Newman has increasingly become known for her work as a writer, and has authored cookbooks and collections of children's quotations in addition to creating original picture-book texts. Among her books for children are Spider the Horrible Cat, There's a Bear in the Bath!, and Good Baby, Bad Baby.\n\nIn There's a Bear in the Bath! a girl named Liza has her patience—and her good manners—put to the test when a judgmental, know-it-all bear comes to call. The furry creature judges everything by his personal standards and usually finds it lacking; for example he sees no use for a bathtub because it is not big enough for a portly bear! Mary Harris Veeder, reviewing Newman's story for Booklist, wrote that the author's depiction of the bear, with what Veeder quipped as an \"'overbearing' personality,\" receives a counterpoint in the renderings by illustrator Michael Foreman that portray the bear \"rather like an oversize, furry uncle, both charming and charmed with himself.\" Newman's boorish bear also asserts himself in a second picture-book outing, There's a Bear in the Classroom!\n\nIn her book Good Baby, Bad Baby Newman presents readers with two stories in one; in this playful reversible story book she includes tales that work together to make what a Publishers Weekly critic described as \"a fairly routine, toddler-style spoof of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.\n\n[Image Not Available]\n\nHyde.\" Newman tells the story of one infant viewed from two different perspectives: in one view she is a bad baby, while from the other perspective she is a good baby. Demonstrating the do's and don'ts regarding appropriate behavior, the two-sided Good Baby, Bad Baby provides children with a clear message as well as more than a few chuckles.\n\nBiographical and Critical Sources\n\nPERIODICALS\n\nBooklist, March 15, 1994, Mary Harris Veeder, review of There's a Bear in the Bath!, p. 1374."
