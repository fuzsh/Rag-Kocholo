While he will be remembered in many obituaries for a movie for grown-ups, The Stepford Wives, he also made three movies that are reviewed at Movies4Kids: Whistle Down The Wind, The Slipper And The Rose and International Velvet.\n\nClick on the titles for reviews, and here’s a clip from the Cinderella musical The Slipper And The Rose, starring Richard Chamberlain and Gemma Craven – this clip features two more greatly missed British talents, Kenneth More and Michael Hordern."
