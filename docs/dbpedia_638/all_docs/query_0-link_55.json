        "text": "Bryan Forbes was an English film director best known for The Stepford Wives, the 1975 Hollywood thriller about women transformed into docile electronic incarnations of themselves.\n\nForbes had lived with multiple sclerosis since the mid-1970s; he attributed his long remission to a gluten-free diet and the support of his wife, the actor Nanette Newman.\n\nBased on Ira Levin’s 1972 novel, The Stepford Wives starred Katharine Ross as Joanna, a young wife who moves to a bucolic suburb only to discover that its women are growing mysteriously, robotically submissive. The film also starred Paula Prentiss as Joanna’s friend Bobbie.\n\nIn interviews, Forbes said that the movie’s producer, Edgar J. Scherick, expressly wanted a foreign director’s perspective on American suburbia. (The film was shot primarily in Connecticut.) In hiring Forbes, he also engaged Newman, who played the small but memorable role of the Stepford wife Carol.\n\nAfter Carol suffers a literal breakdown, she utters one of the movie’s most emblematic lines - ‘‘I’ll just die if I don’t get this recipe!’’ - over and over in endless short circuit.\n\nNewman was also partly responsible for the look of the film. According to many news accounts, the original screenplay, by William Goldman, called for the post-transformation Stepford wives to be clad in hot pants and halter tops. A proper Englishwoman, Newman did not fancy such a get-up; as a result, the wives wear long dresses that suggest 20th-century plantation belles.\n\nThe movie drew mixed reviews but endures as an artifact of high camp and perhaps even as a quasi-feminist document. At least as much as Levin’s novel, it helped to make the phrase Stepford wife, describing any woman who seems vapid and compliant, an enduring part of the lexicon.\n\nForbes was not involved in the poorly received 2004 remake, which starred Nicole Kidman as Joanna and Bette Midler as Bobbie.\n\nWhat united much of Forbes’s work - he was also a prolific screenwriter, as well as an actor and the author of fiction and nonfiction books - was a concern with eccentricity, marginality and, above all, loneliness. He was also known for directing some of the leading British and American actors of the postwar period.\n\nHis films as director and screenwriter include The L-Shaped Room (1962), which stars Leslie Caron as a resident of a seedy English rooming house, Seance on a Wet Afternoon (1964), with Kim Stanley as a psychic turned kidnapper and Richard Attenborough as her passive husband, King Rat (1965), a prisoner-of-war drama starring George Segal, The Whisperers (1967), a melodrama starring Edith Evans and the remake of International Velvet (1978), with Tatum O’Neal.\n\nHe also directed a 1969 screen version of Jean Giraudoux’s play The Madwoman of Chaillot, starring Katharine Hepburn and Paul Henreid.\n\nBryan Forbes was born John Theobald Clarke in London on July 22, 1926, and as a young man studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. To avoid confusion with a contemporary English actor named John Clark, he adopted the name Bryan Forbes early in his career.\n\nAs an actor, he appeared in many postwar British films, including Hour of Glory (also titled The Small Back Room), The Wooden Horse, Man With a Million and The Colditz Story.\n\nForbes began his screenwriting career in 1955 with The Cockleshell Heroes, a World War II drama directed by Jose Ferrer. He made his directorial debut in 1961 with Whistle Down the Wind, the story of farm children who think the fugitive hiding in their barn is Jesus. (The film was the basis for Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical of the same name, which closed out of town before its scheduled Broadway opening in 1997.)\n\nHis books include the novels The Rewrite Man and A Spy at Twilight, a memoir, Notes for a Life, and That Despicable Race: A History of the British Acting Tradition.\n\nHe was named a Commander of the British Empire in 2004.\n\nFor all his accomplishments, Forbes remained remembered almost exclusively for The Stepford Wives, and sometimes found himself having to defend the film against misinterpretation. In an interview in 2004 he recounted having been accosted by an umbrella-wielding woman at a press screening.\n\n‘‘I remember saying to this particular savagely disturbed woman, ‘You’ve missed the whole point’,’’ Forbes recalled. ‘‘A, it’s fantasy; B, if anybody looks stupid, it’s the men. It’s not an attack on women, it’s an attack on women being exploited by men.’’\n\nBryan Forbes’s first marriage, to Constance Smith, ended in divorce. Besides Newman, whom he married in the mid-1950s, survivors include two daughters, Emma Forbes and Sarah Standing.\n\nMargalit Fox, New York Times"
