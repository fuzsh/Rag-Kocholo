All right, let’s try this again. Good morning, Middlebury. >> [Unison] Good morning. Please rise, as you are able, for the National Anthem, sung by Marco Motroni, a member of the Class of 2025. [ Applause, Cheering ] [ Applause ]\n\nMarco Motroni: Okay.\n\nMale Speaker: Good luck. [ Music ]\n\nMarco Matroni: [Singing] O say, can you see, by the dawn’s early light. What so proudly we hailed at the twilight’s last gleaming. Whose broad stripes and bright stars, through the perilous fight. O’er the ramparts we watched, were so gallantly streaming? And the rockets’ red glare, the bombs bursting in air. Gave proof through the night that our flag was still there. O say, does that star spangled banner yet wave. O’er the land of the free and the home of the brave? [ Applause ]\n\nLaurie Patton: You may be seated. Good morning, Middlebury. >> [Unison] Good morning. No, no, no, no, no, no, not good enough. I want everybody. Good morning, Middlebury. >> [Unison] Good morning. My name is Laurie Patton. I am the President of Middlebury. And on behalf of the Middlebury trustees and faculty, I would like to welcome you to this celebration of the accomplishments of the members of the Middlebury College, Class of 2024. [ Applause, Cheering ] [ Applause ] I am so delighted that we are here together this morning. And now I’d like to invite Rabbi Danielle Stillman, associate chaplain at the college, to read our land acceptance. And to give the invocation. [ Applause ]\n\nDanielle Stillman: We pause to acknowledge that Middlebury College sits on land which has served as a site of meeting and exchange among indigenous peoples since time immemorial. The Western Abenaki are the traditional caretakers of these Vermont lands and waters, which they call Ndakinna, or homeland. We remember their connection to this region and the hardships they continue to endure. Let us take a moment of silence to pay respect to the Abenaki Elders and to the indigenous inhabitants of Turtle Island, past and present. [ Silence ] We give thanks for the opportunity to share in the bounty of this place and to protect it. We are all one in the sacred web of life that connects people, animals, plants, air, water, and earth. Oh source of all, today, now, we call on the mystery to be with us. As the poet Dylan Thomas described it, the force that through the green fuse drives the flower. May that force surround us here, graduates, families, beloved teachers, mentors, and friends. May we step now into joy and celebration, even as we see and feel and care deeply about the sorrow sweeping the world around us. May we affirm with our joy the imperative we each have to give ourselves over to the full range of human experience. Let us bless the force that infuses us, that drives us, that keeps us alive and brings us to this time. In the words of the ancient Hebrew prayer that is recited when we arrive at a new moment and a sacred occasion in our lives. [ Foreign language ] Blessed are you, Eternal One, Source of New Beginnings, who has kept us alive and established us and brought us to this moment. Amen.\n\nLaurie Patton: Good morning again. Graduates, today is your day. And we hope that you enjoy it to the fullest. I would note that the students who we recognize today have worked tremendously hard to reach this moment. We are so proud of them as individuals and as a class. But we know that they did not get to this moment on their own. So students and guests, please join me now in recognizing parents, grandparents, family members, chosen family members, friends of our graduating seniors whose devotion and support enabled them to be here today. Thank you all. [ Applause ] I also want to thank the members of the college staff, many of whom are here today, whose many hours of preparation have helped make this Commencement possible. Middlebury is so fortunate to have a truly dedicated staff who have been hard at work for weeks and since very early this morning setting up this site, preparing refreshments, planting flowers, bringing the programs and diplomas for distribution, and doing countless other tasks. Would everyone please join me now in thanking the amazing Middlebury College staff for their much appreciated efforts. [ Applause, Cheering ] [ Applause ] And to our faculty, you are the heart of this institution and your commitment to teaching and scholarship reverberates throughout the world every time we send new graduates on their way. Class of 2024 and families and friends, please join me in thanking our and your professors. [ Applause ] And speaking of dedication, I would like to ask you to join me in recognizing the members of our community who have retired or will retire at the end of this academic year. The members of the faculty who have retired or will retire at the end of the academic year are Priscilla Bremser, Timi Mayer, Paul Minot [assumed spelling], and Tim Spears. And staff members retiring with more than 25 years of service to the college are Arabella Holzapfel, Ronald Munson [assumed spelling], Ken Pohlman, Mary Stanley, Don Sommer [assumed spelling], and Michael Warner. Let’s thank them and all retirees for their many years of service and dedication to Middlebury and our students. [ Applause ] And finally, on a really fun note, let us thank Damascus Kafumbe and Middlebury’s Afropop Band, who provided the music as we took our seats. [ Applause ] The Constitution Brass Quintet and bagpiper Tim Cummings, who gets us in and gets us out with such dignity and elegance. [ Applause ] And I am really pleased to note that some of our graduating seniors are not able to be with us this morning. Why? Because senior Robby Ward has been selected to compete in the NCAA Individual Championships with his doubles partner, Neel Epstein, Class of ‘25, in St. Louis, Missouri. Robby and Neel will be playing their match against a team from Denison this afternoon. And — [ Applause ] — the number one ranked Middlebury women’s lacrosse team advanced to the NCAA Final Four last week. [ Applause ] On Friday, they played the semifinal game in Salem, Virginia against Franklin and Marshall, and they won 15 to 9. So today, some of your classmates aren’t with us because, they are going to be playing for the national championship against Salisbury University today, at noon. [ Applause ] We wish them all the best, and we will celebrate graduation later this week upon their return. So now, in Middlebury’s early years, every member of the student body, every member, delivered remarks at Commencement. Imagine that. We would be here considerably longer than we will be today. And then, about 150 years ago, the students’ speeches at Commencement faded out. And then, in 2000, our bicentennial year, we restored a student speech to the ceremony. This year’s student address will be delivered by Adelia Lee [assumed spelling]. [ Applause, Cheering ] [ Applause ] Adelia is a graduating senior from Somerset, New Jersey. Having matriculated in fall 2020, that tough, tough, tough fall, Adelia has witnessed the many ups and downs that this campus has to offer in its varying phases. Following graduation, she will be heading to Alaska for the summer before gearing up to teach English with Teach For America. Please join me in welcoming Adelia. [ Applause, Cheering ] [ Applause ]\n\nAdelia Lee: For those of us who graduated from high school in 2020, welcome to our very first graduation. [ Applause ] And to those who didn’t matriculate with us, well, it’s probably about time you found yourself on this lawn. Can you remember those long hours we all spent waiting idly in our cars, waving through cracked windows, slowly slithering through the Ridgeline parking lot? I remember the moment my parents drove away, leaving me to spend the rest of my 19th birthday organizing my whole life into a 100-square-foot room. Looking back on that day and the 1,369 days in between, it’s hard for me to believe that today has come. From the first moment we stepped outside our rooms, negative test results in our inboxes and masked up, we took the campus by storm. From one panther apart, we formed a community. I know for me, those first few weeks proved laborious, from sitting around on the grass in circles making countless introductions to trying to figure out how I would ever feel at home in a place so alien. Yet somehow, I did. With the help of my school-sanctioned 10 close contacts, I discovered what Middlebury had to offer, and found comfort in the changing seasons. Very quickly, those first few weeks turned to fall, followed by the first snowfall. And when the sun returned along the horizon, bringing in the first sweet moments of spring, I felt myself thaw and acclimate to my new home, finding my place as a non-athletic regular person. Now looking back at the many seasons we’ve spent together on this campus, I know I’ll miss the first few radiant hues of fall, and warm afternoons spent basking in the sun. While those moments are now only memories, I know that scattered across the globe will carry these sentiments with us. Our experiences at Middlebury will serve as an anchor, grounding us in the rhythm of the seasons. Whether you find yourself in bustling cities or tranquil countryside’s, the memory of fall foliage painting the campus in hues of red and gold, or the quiet beauty of a winter snowfall, blanketing the landscape will undoubtedly resurface. These seasonal markers will not only remind us of the passage of time, but also of the growth and transformation we underwent during our time at Middlebury. Embarking on the next chapter of our lives, emerging from the vibrant renewal of late spring, we will continue to follow the cyclical patterns of the Earth. However, there are some patterns that should be broken. As we sit on this lawn, celebrating our academic successes, taking in the last of what this place has to offer and our time as students, we must turn our attention to those we have lost and continue to mourn. I would like us to recognize Yan Zhou, Professor Raquel Albarran, Evelyn Mae Sorensen, and Ivan Valerio, who all passed away during our four years here. These members of our community were all part of marginalized groups who suffered from the standards of the toxic work culture that permeates the fabric of our campus. Even as there is a genocide happening before our very eyes, being live-streamed across the world, the majority of the student body continues on with life as normal. I too have found myself yearning for normalcy. However, there is no normalcy during genocide. In the 232 days since October 7th, at least 35,000 Palestinians have been killed, including over 14,000 children. And hundreds of thousands of families, just like those that are here today, have been displaced in their homeland. I bring this up before you all today because the place that we have called home for four years, is complicit in these atrocities. This matters to me as it should matter to all of you, because the money that is paid for my education is tied to the destruction of all universities in Gaza. Standing on this stage, moments away from graduating myself, I think of all the Gazan students who cannot graduate from their universities because they have all been destroyed. And for all of the students on this campus, our friends and peers, who cannot go about their daily lives because their people are dying, we need to keep talking about Palestine. [ Applause, Cheering ] As members of the Middlebury community, I ask you to continue standing in solidarity with those who call for divestment and the freedom of Palestine. In the coming hours, as we transition from students to alumni, I urge you to consider withholding donations to this institution as long as Middlebury continues to fund genocide. [ Applause, Cheering ] The work does not stop now that we are done with our assignments and transitioned out of our roles as student leaders. We must continue to stand up for each other, for BIPOC and LGBTQ plus communities, and those who are silenced by the oppressive regimes that strangle our society. Class of 2024, going out into the world, we must take what we have learned in our four years and break these cycles in our everyday lives. The memories and lessons from our collective college experiences, serve as examples for what we will face in the real world, and how we can navigate these new challenges as informed individuals. Stepping forward into our futures, celebrate what you have accomplished here, remember how much we have overcome together. The strength we have as a community does not dissipate as we leave this campus, but continues to evolve as we push the boundaries and resist injustice for a free Palestine and for liberation for all. Thank you. [ Applause, Cheering ]\n\nLaurie Patton: Thank you, Adelia. Every year since 1981, the members of the senior class have honored their time at Middlebury and marked their graduation by making a gift to the college. This year, members of the Class of 2024 and 2024.5 chose to support mental health resources through the Mental Health and Wellness Programs Endowment Fund. [ Applause ] This fund aims to enhance and diversify the college’s mental health resources and ensure they are accessible to all students. Your class was challenged to reach at least 200 donors. You exceeded your goal, 253 of your classmates have come together and supported this gift. In doing so, your class unlocked an additional gift from Chris Brown, Class of 2003. In total, you raised $21,104.94, and your participation is a wonderful expression of your continuing connection to Middlebury. I’d like to recognize the senior class gift team, Gianna Palli, Caitlin Baxter, Lea Hohenlohe, Naja Irvin-Conyers, and Brian Mejia for their leadership in encouraging so many members of the senior class to participate in ensuring the success of this particularly meaningful gift. Thank you, members of this fabulous, fabulous graduating class. Thank you to Chris and to everyone else who contributed to this gift. We deeply appreciate your commitment to Middlebury. [ Applause ] Later this morning, every graduating senior will receive a replica of Gamaliel Painter’s cane along with a diploma. Gamaliel Painter was one of the founders of Middlebury College, and when he died, he left his estate to the college, including his walking stick, which he was often seen carrying across campus and around town. His cane has become the college’s mace, carried by the president at all academic ceremonial occasions to signify Middlebury’s founding spirit, its optimism, and its future. Today, we will give you each your own cane, handcrafted here in Vermont, of New England birch and ash to carry forward into your life as alumni and to bring back for a union. This cane has many, many other stories besides the official one that we just told, stories of the workers who made it, stories of the women and men from all backgrounds and ethnicities who live and work in the households of Vermont where this cane and others stood in the hallways, stories of the groves of trees which provided the wood, and the Native Americans who cared for them. We are only beginning to tell these stories, and we ask you to remember them as you journey from here. These canes are a symbol of the historical ties that bind us to this institution, the generosity that supports us, and the hard work and learning that brought you to this place today as a graduate of Middlebury College. The canes will be presented by Janine Hetherington, Class of 1995, parent of a Class of 2024, and past president of Middlebury Alumni Society. I would now like to begin the presentation of the honorary degrees. I invite Middlebury trustee Emeritus Churchill Franklin, Tracy Himmel Isham, and coaches Mike Leonard and Kelly Bevere to come forward to present Joseph J. Castiglione for his honorary degree. [ Applause ]\n\nChurchill Franklin: President Patton, I have the honor to present for the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters Joseph J. Castiglione.\n\nLaurie Patton: Joseph Castiglione, Boston Red Sox announcer, author, lecturer, and member of the Red Sox Hall of Fame, your connection to Middlebury runs deep. Your uncle Salvatore and aunt Pierina Castiglione were beloved Italian professors at Middlebury, and your sister Cheryl, is a member of the Class of 1972. Sports announcing has been your calling since your earliest days in the booth as an undergraduate at Colgate and a graduate student at Syracuse. You began your professional career in Ohio, where you eventually began calling games for Cleveland teams before finding your place with the Red Sox broadcast team in the early 1980s. Since then, for 42 years, you’ve kept Boston fans tuned to the radio so they can follow your coverage of the team. As the team’s lead announcer, you’ve shared the Red Sox’s most epic moments with listeners, most notably your famous exclamation when the team had won the 2004 World Series. “Can you believe it?” In addition to your broadcasting, you’ve authored two books telling stories from your career, Broadcast Rights and Sights; I Saw It on the Radio with the Boston Red Sox, and Can You Believe It; 30 Years of Insider Stories with the Boston Red Sox. You also helped educate the next generation of sports broadcasters for almost 30 years as a lecturer of communication studies at Northeastern University. You’ve been named the 2024 recipient of the Ford C. Frick Award, presented annually for excellence in broadcasting by the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum and the Fenway Park Broadcast Booth, now officially known as the Joe Castiglione Booth, recognizing you as the longest-serving radio broadcaster in Boston sports history. Can you believe it? [ Laughter ] It is therefore my privilege, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury, to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, with all the rights, honors, privileges, and responsibilities here and everywhere pertaining to this degree. Congratulations. [ Applause ] [ Applause ] I now invite Middlebury trustee Karen Stolley, Dana Olson, and Professor Carlos Velez to come forward to present Michael R. Katz for his honorary degree. [ Applause ]\n\nFemale Speaker: President Patton, I have the honor to present for the degree Doctor of Humane Letters, Michael R. Katz.\n\nLaurie Patton: Michael Katz, C.V. Starr, Professor Emeritus of Russian and Eastern European Studies, author, translator, and scholar, you opened the world of Russian novels to audiences of English speakers. After Williams College, we’ll forgive you, where you were the first Russian major, you earned your Ph.D. from Oxford University on a Keasbey scholarship and studied at the University of Leningrad as part of a US-USSR cultural exchange. In Leningrad, you worked at the Institute of Russian Literature and the Russian Language Institute, where you studied Russian poetry. Before moving to prose and writing a book about dreams in Russian literature. From there, you began your translation career with more than 20 translations of great Russian literature, from Crime and Punishment to Notes from the Underground to last year’s acclaimed translation of Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov, which was named one of the best books of 2023. As a professor and as dean of the Middlebury Language Schools, you taught hundreds of students about the beauty and complexity of a region, its language, and its literature. Although you retired from the faculty in 2010, you continue to shape Middlebury students’ lives with the courses you teach during winter term and at the Bread Loaf School of English. You are the embodiment of the passion for inquiry, creativity, and understanding beyond borders that Middlebury holds most dear. It is therefore my privilege, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury, to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, Honoris Causa, with all the rights, honors, privileges, and responsibilities here and everywhere pertaining to this degree. Congratulations. [ Applause ] [ Applause ] I now invite Middlebury trustee Leilani Brown, Nicole Kirvan [assumed spelling], and Professor Tara Affolter to come forward to present Linda Cliatt-Wayman for her honorary degree. [ Applause ]\n\nLeilani Brown: President Patton, I have the honor to present for the degree of Doctor of Education, Linda Cliatt-Wayman.\n\nLaurie Patton: Linda Cliatt-Wayman, educator, author, and inspiration to children, teachers, and families, you know firsthand the power of transformational education. After a childhood spent in poverty in North Philadelphia, you earned your bachelor’s from Kutztown University and your master’s degree from St. Joseph University. For 20 years, you were a special educator with a firm belief in ending poverty for as many students as possible through education. You became a school principal in 2003 and helped lead Fitzsimmons High School from underachieving and a violent space to being a safe space to learn. You then opened the Young Women’s Leadership School at North Philadelphia’s Rhodes High School. Through setting and holding high standards, supporting staff, and believing in and loving your students, you transformed Rhodes from a school with low student proficiency to one where 94% of students were admitted to college. [ Applause ] At Strawberry Mansion High School, you and your team again inspired positive change with test scores dramatically improving and the school being removed from the federal government’s list of persistently dangerous schools. Your 2015 TED Talk, How to Fix a Broken School, Lead Fearlessly, Love Hard, has been viewed more than 2.4 million times. After retiring from Strawberry Mansion in 2017, you founded the non-profit Currently Trending, which is dedicated to preventing high school students from dropping out by helping them understand how to work hard, develop study habits, and enhance their reading and writing skills, while also exposing them to a wide variety of professions. In short, you have changed the trajectory of thousands of students’ lives by letting them know that you believe in them and their potential, and you share your love. It is therefore my privilege, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Trustees at Middlebury, to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Education, honoris causa, with all the rights, honors, privileges, and responsibilities here and everywhere pertaining to this degree. Congratulations. [ Applause ] [ Applause ] I now invite Middlebury Trustee, Caroline McBride, HaQuyen Pham, and Professor Mark Williams to come forward to present Emily Elizabeth Welty and Matthew Breay Bolton for their honorary degrees. [ Applause ]\n\nFemale Speaker: President Patton, I have the honor to present, for the degree of Doctor of Humanities, Emily Elizabeth Welty and Matthew Breay Bolton.\n\nLaurie Patton: Emily Welty, you are an academic, activist, ecumenist, playwright, and artist who is helping to lead critical conversations on faith-based peacebuilding and nonviolent social movements. As the founder and chair of Peace and Justice Studies at Pace University, one of the largest peace and justice programs in the United States, your work focuses on nonviolence, humanitarianism, reconciliation, transitional justice, and the role of the arts in peacebuilding. You were part of the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons and a member of the New York campaign to abolish nuclear weapons, which persuaded the New York City Council to call on NYC to divest its pension funds from nuclear weapons. You also have served as vice moderator of the World Council of Churches Commission of the Churches on International Affairs and shared their nuclear disarmament working group. And you were the main representative to the United Nations for the International Peace Research Association. Your career and your life are inspiring examples of how we can advance the causes of peace, justice, and nonproliferation. It is therefore my privilege by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humanities, honoris causa, with all the rights, honors, privileges, and responsibilities here and everywhere pertaining to this degree. [ Applause ] Matthew Breay Bolton, Professor and Peace Activist, together with your wife Emily Welty, you co-direct the International Disarmament Institute at Pace University, where you explore the impact of weapons, pathways to disarmament, arms control, and nonproliferation, and monitoring and evaluating disarmament programs. You are part, too, of the Nobel Prize-winning International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, where you highlight the concern of coastal communities affected by nuclear weapons development and testing from the South Pacific to New York City. As an aid worker in Bosnia and Iraq, you saw how landmines impacted people in the environment which led to your work investigating the politics of landmines and cluster munition clearance in Eastern Europe and Asia. Your emerging research explores politics in a more than human world, from the role of islands and international relations to bear human conflict in the Adirondack Mountains. From your books including Imagining Disarmament and Chanting International Relations to your research and activism, you challenge us to reconsider our preconceived ideas of what is possible in our quest for a more peaceful future. It is therefore my privilege, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury, to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humanities, honoris causa, with all the rights, honors, privileges, and responsibilities here and everywhere pertaining to this degree. Congratulations [ Applause ] [ Applause ] I now invite Middlebury trustee Ted Truscott, Michelle McCauley, and Bill McKibben to come forward to present Terry Tempest Williams for her honorary degree. [ Applause ]\n\nMale Speaker: President Patton, I have the honor to present for the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, Terry Tempest Williams.\n\nLaurie Patton: Terry Tempest Williams, acclaimed author, citizen writer, environmentalist, and social justice advocate, you have played a critical role in our understanding of environmental justice while enriching our literary landscape with your books. Growing up within sight of the Great Salt Lake, your awareness of our place in the natural world was fueled by both Utah’s arid natural beauty and the U.S. government’s mid-century atomic testing that exposed many in your region, including your family, to radiation. Becoming an educator after earning your bachelor’s in English and your master’s in environmental education, you taught in the Navajo Nation and then at the University of Utah, where you founded the university’s Environmental Humanities Master’s Program. Your writing career began with the 1984 children’s book, Secret Language of Snow, which won the National Science Foundation Book Award, followed by Pieces of White Shell, A Journey to Navajoland, and your memoir, Refuge; An Unnatural History of Family and Place. Your 1995 book, Testimony; Writers of the West Speak on Behalf of Utah Wilderness which you co-edited, was credited by President Bill Clinton as having made a difference in preserving the Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, and you yourself preserved more than 1,700 acres of land in Utah by purchasing oil and gas leases from the federal government, thereby keeping the land away from energy development. Now a writer-in-residence at Harvard Divinity School, you’ve been honored with the Robert Marshall Award from the Wilderness Society, the highest honor it gives to American citizens, the Distinguished Achievement Award from the Western Literature Association, the Wallace Stegner Award from the Center of the American West, the David R. Brower Conservation Award for Activism, the Sierra Club John Muir Award, and the Lannan Literary Award for Nonfiction. And today we celebrate your contributions to ecological consciousness and social change. It is therefore my privilege, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Board of Trustees of Middlebury, to confer upon you the degree of Doctor of Humane Letters, honoris causa, with all the rights, honors, privileges, and responsibilities here and everywhere pertaining to this degree. Congratulations. [ Applause ] [ Applause ]\n\nTerry Tempest Williams: I told Bill McKibben, if I pass out, he will continue. You are so beautiful, Class of 2024. Thank you, President Patton, Board of Trustees, colleagues. It is such a privilege to receive this honorary degree from Middlebury College alongside my other colleagues from a school I love and one that has been part of my own educational landscape. Members of my chosen family are here. Bill McKibben and Sue Halpern, alumna Bianca Giaever, and my activist daughter from Utah, Mishka Banuri, who is graduating today. And a deep bow to my mentor, John Elder. To the Class of 2024, the People of the Eclipse, the name given to you by President Patton for the light you shine in these shadowed times, we see you, we hear you, and we honor the arduous path that has been yours in these four years with the support of your family, your friends, and colleagues. This is a celebratory moment, a historic moment, and not an easy one. Thank you for allowing me to stand with you and be part of this monumental day. You have shown us as Audre Lorde, the poet, did, your silences will not protect you. And you have spoken, each in your own ways with the gifts that are yours, in your spheres of influences, with commitments made and delivered. Congratulations. I come to you from Utah, where Great Salt Lake, located in the heart of the American West, our inland sea, is shrinking, threatening to dry up within the next five years due to overuse of water and climate change, manifesting in a mega drought not seen in 2,500 years, if we do nothing. If we fail to get more water back in the lake, toxic winds will blow off the now exposed lake bed, risking 2 million lives along the Wasatch Front. We are watching the Great Salt Lake ecosystem collapse from brine shrimp and brine flies to the 12 million birds who depend on these food sources migrating to these saline waters to rest, to breed, and to gather strength for the next journey. Great Salt Lake continues to teach me how to find refuge in change. Last month, we brought 16 students from the Harvard Divinity School, to Great Salt Lake. They were expecting a pilgrimage of grief in the presence of a dying body of water. What they found was a shimmering landscape of joy. There is so much beauty that remains. On one excursion, we traveled to the Sun Tunnels, a piece of land art created by Nancy Holt on the west side of the lake, where four concrete cylinders, 18 feet in length and nine feet in diameter, are arranged in an open cross format, aligned to frame the sun on the horizon during summer and winter solstices. On the day we were there, we were met by 85 mile per hour winds, with no barriers for protection, but the Sun Tunnels themselves, that from afar appear as hollow bird bones on the desert that could blow away. I asked the students if they wanted to leave. We were vulnerable. They said no. For safety purposes, I radioed the rangers on Antelope Island of our quadrants, and told them we were staying. When I turned around, the students were gone, poof, gone, vanished. And then I heard something and began walking toward what I thought was music. The students were singing inside one of the Sun Tunnels, tucked safely inside, alternating head, feet, head, feet, head, feet, so all their bodies could fit. They were singing the song that spontaneously came to them, accompanied by the wind. They found their voices in the storm. And they were not afraid. They had each other. The louder the wind howled, the more powerful their voices became, until their song seemed to soften the blow of the storm. Storms are blowing around the world, physically and metaphorically. The winds of change are strong. We have a history of bravery in this country, and we must call it forward now. A livable future is guaranteed only by our degree of personal engagement, the size of our hearts, the risks we are willing to take, and our commitments to build trust in our capacity to work together among our differences. We can mobilize our creativity and care in the name of a just world for all, beyond our backyards, even beyond our own species. To the students who participated in the encampment in Middlebury, and to the varied student body who were asked to contemplate the meaning, there is a dignified tradition of civil disobedience. From Henry David Thoreau and the abolitionists opposed to slavery, to Susan B. Anthony and the suffragettes demanding the right for women to vote, to Martin Luther King and the freedom fighters in the civil rights movement. To gay rights activists protesting at the Stonewall Inn in New York. To the leadership of Bill McKibben, and the students who founded 350.org right here, at Middlebury College in 2007. Recognizing, putting us on notice, that climate change is the most important issue facing humanity. They did change the political weather system, which led to a decade-long hard and successful fight, culminating in Middlebury’s commitment to divest from fossil fuels, and it is happening now. One can imagine today’s activists changing Middlebury’s mind once again, to divest from manufacturing arms in the name of peace-building. [ Applause, Cheering ] [ Applause ] Thank you for your civil disobedience, offering up your voices on behalf of peace, sustaining social and environmental justice in the fertile gardens of dissent. Your voices matter. Engaging in civil dialogue, all of us, through varied points of view, while honoring our differences, which are beautiful and painful and instructive, where empathy and compassion are cultivating respect, it’s deeply American. What appears to be destructive on our college campuses and universities, I believe is actually generative. As exemplified by the process that is in place at Middlebury, with the students, the administration, faculty and staff who are finding common values, committed to what Wallace Stegner, a fellow Vermonter, called, a society to match the scenery. In his words, this is the geography of hope. Democracy is messy, and change can be dramatic, but it is worth the toil and toll it takes to travel to new places of understanding, to be stretched, to lead us to transformative actions. It starts with ourselves. So where do we look for guidance in these turbulent times? I follow my heart, and I would ask you to trust yours. Here’s why. The heart is the first home of democracy. It is where we embrace our questions. Can we be equitable? Can we be generous? Can we listen with our whole beings, not just our minds, and offer our attention rather than our opinions? And do we have enough resolve in our hearts to act courageously, relentlessly, without giving up, ever? Trusting our fellow citizens to join us with a determined pursuit of a living, breathing democracy? The heart is the path to wisdom because it dares to be vulnerable in the presence of power. Our power lies in our love of our own home ground. If the open space of democracy feels like it is closing inside our divided states of America, the remedy is here, with you and your fellow graduates today, celebrating, in the midst of your diverse disciplines, identities, and beliefs. I trust you. We trust you. Side by side, you are singing with the winds, changing the orientation of your hearts, our hearts, that is deepening all of our capacity to not look away, but to stay with the troubles. These issues that keep us awake at night will not allow — and that do not allow us to sleep, the wars, the weather, the dismissal of one another’s views that too often descend into violence, are interconnected and interrelated. The crisis we find ourselves in, whether it is in the Middle East, in the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, or here at home, where we are banning birth control in some states and protecting the reproductive rights of women in others. Where we are screaming drill baby drill, on one hand and divesting from fossil fuels, without the other. These issues cannot be seen simply as part of our political crisis. This is also our spiritual crisis, demanding our devotions. Each of you is on a spiritual journey, uniquely yours. Let these challenging times open your hearts, not close them. We lose nothing by loving. The heartbreak my community in the Salt Lake Valley is feeling over the possible death of Great Salt Lake is actually bringing us together, regardless of our differing opinions over the causes and solutions. We care. We care enough to work this out together, and we are being led by indigenous leaders. We are embracing the vitality of the struggle, and it is opening our hearts because we are getting to know one another as human beings, not as people of positions. And we have to if we are to succeed. Our grief has become our love, and we cannot fail. Our lives depend on it, both human and wild. A bird’s eye view of Great Salt Lake or from a plane looks like a bloodletting, and it is cellular. So high is the salt content due to extreme heat leading to extreme evaporation. The only life forms that can survive are called halophytes, salt-tolerant organisms that turn the water blood red. I can tell you it’s unnerving, it’s disorienting, and it is impossible not to see the body of Great Salt Lake as our own bodies in beauty and terror. Emily Dickinson writes, life is a spell so exquisite, everything conspires to break it. How can we not respond? Not long after I graduated from the University of Utah, I made a decision to cross the line at the Nevada test site and committed civil disobedience in the name of the women in my family. Nine women in my family have all had mastectomies and seven are dead as a result of nuclear fallout in the desert. At that time, they were still testing nuclear bombs in the desert. As one officer cinched my — as one officer cinched the handcuffs around my wrists, another officer frisked my body. She found a pen and a pad of paper tucked inside my left boot. “And these,” she asked? “Weapons,” I replied. Our eyes met. I smiled. The officer pulled the leg of my trousers back over my boot. It was in that moment I became a writer. I was no longer afraid. I knew where I stood, and I knew what I stood for and who I stood with. The community I was creating was on the page. I knew where my authority came from. I ask you to learn where yours comes from. Our hearts in place together. I wanted to change the world, but instead the world changed me. And then I realized it’s the same thing. To care and to be carried toward one’s purpose is an action akin to love. As President Patton said yesterday in her baccalaureate address, you can help and heal the world. You are, and you will. To care is neither conservative or radical, writes John Ralston Saul. It is a change in consciousness. This is the task before all of us. Being conscious of where we stand and what we stand for and with whom. This is the power of belonging to a community who cares. Many communities with great heart. There are many ways to engage at the heart level as we face the heartbreaks and difficulties of this moment. We can sing. We can sing into the winds of change. If we are present in the moment, this moment, we will know what to do. Finding beauty in a broken world is creating beauty in the world we find. In a gesture of solidarity, hands over our hearts, hand over your heart, can you feel your heart beating, alive, here, now, together? This is the geography of hope. This is the site of beautiful disturbances and disruptive discourses, beginning with yourself that will radiate outward as light, a stay against darkness. Bless us in our differences and the differences we make. You have a voice, and we hear you, and we believe in you. Cheers to you, the Class of 2024, to your beautiful revolutionary hearts, dearest People of the Eclipse.

I invite Board Chair Ted Truscott back to the podium. Thank you, Michelle. As many of you know, our president and my friend, Lori Patton, announced this spring that she will be living Middlebury at the conclusion of the calendar year. When she will become the president of the prestigious American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts. [ Applause ] This is such an extraordinary honor for Laurie and for Middlebury. And while we will miss her dearly, we are so excited for her to have this opportunity. Our students have also noted with some delight, I might add, that Lori has fibbed herself and should become an unofficial member of the class of ‘24.5. I will remind Laurie, however, at our 35th reunion, she was indoctrinated into the class of ‘83 as an honorary member as well. So I think both of those sounds appropriate. Laurie can make her choice. And while we have plenty of time in the coming months to thoroughly celebrate Lori’s myriad of accomplishments, I would like to acknowledge today Laurie is presiding over her final undergraduate commencement exercise at the college. With this in mind, I’d like to make a very special presentation. At each commencement, as we have just witnessed, our new graduates and newly tenured faculty members are presented with a walking stick. A replica for our founder’s cane, which he bequeathed to the college along with the vast majority of his estate. Gamaliel Painter’s original cane is kept in the president’s office. And for decades now, it has been carried by the president in official ceremonies, serving as the institution’s cane. Laurie has spoken of what this symbol means to Middlebury. Explaining how an artifact of the past remains relevant in an institution’s continuing evolution. And she has noted how a later verse in the song “Gamaliel Painter’s Cane” states that our founder left to us his courage in his cane. This courage has sustained Middlebury for centuries. And I’d like to note that this courage has been demonstrated in abundance during the past decade by our 17th president. So when Laurie begins to pack up her office later this year, she will need to leave behind this symbol of Middlebury’s strength and its courage. But she will not be leaving empty-handed. Laurie, it gives me great pleasure to present you with your own replica of Gamaliel Painter’s cane. Which is intended to serve as a tangible reminder of a place where you made your own historical mark, serving with distinction and courage. Congratulations, Laurie. [ Applause ]\n\nLaurie Patton: I get my own cane.\n\nMale 3: You do. And your own set of glasses as well. [ Applause ]\n\nLaurie Patton: Thank you. Thank you.\n\nMale 3: Feel free to say a few words if you want.\n\nLaurie Patton: Thank you. [ Applause ] Thank you so much, Ted, and everyone here. This is an unexpected moment for all of us, and I think we’re all still processing. The academy’s mission of strengthening American democracy through the cultivation of thought leadership is core to my life’s work. And I bring to that all that Middlebury has taught me about that mission in the work ahead. I hope to make you proud. We have seven months to work together to continue to build Middlebury. And one of the greatest things to ask when you leave a place — and I hope everyone is asking it today to themselves, is how am I different? How has this place changed me? I will continue to ask that question. Right now, my heart is filled with gratitude for all that Middlebury has shaped in mind, heart, body, and soul. For Middlebury families, all of you out there, I have learned from you the nature of support from near and far. Even when you don’t understand what your college student is doing, you love and listen to them anyway. Thank you for being that collective genius. For Middlebury trustees, I have learned the extraordinary power of faithful, trusting argument. You have embodied the ideal that I spoke about in 2015 of more and better arguments, with greater respect, stronger resilience, and deeper wisdom. From Middlebury staff, I have learned the pride of place and the work that goes into cultivating our local world. Thank you for nurturing a place of beauty. From Middlebury faculty, I have learned an exquisite combination of compassion and pedagogical excellence. Thank you for reminding us every day of rigor, freedom, and generosity. From Middlebury and Addison neighbors in the town and county, you have taught me about everyday practices of democracy that I believe will save our nation. Thank you for those lessons in the power of community life. One of my ancient teachers, Rabbi Tarfon, from the Jewish tradition says, “You may not finish the work yourselves. But neither are you permitted to cease from it.” And that is for all of us, and particularly for beloved Middlebury students. Yes, I agree. I fibbed myself. You have taught me creativity and perseverance, even and perhaps especially when the world is on fire. I will end my thanks to you, our students, by sharing again with you the final sentences that I shared with you yesterday. You are people of the eclipse, and that clamor today that you hear is not only celebrating your journey from a dark, viral Corona in 2020, to a blazing solar Corona in 2024 in April. It is also celebrating who you will become. As people of the eclipse, you will hear many times in your life a sudden hush when hope seems to vanish. As Middlebury people, you have proven over and over again that you have the strength to persevere beyond that sudden hush, beyond that unexplained darkness. And stand witness to the next moment, the moment of hope, when you embrace again that brilliant flash of promise. We need thousands of you to gather in fields and be citizen scientists, to start new festivals. To greet strangers as you do today and as you did on April 8th, on the blanket across the path. Go now and bring Middlebury into the world with your faces upturned in hope, with your mind, your spirit, your body, and your hearts, you have the power to help and heal. The same thing ancient peoples longed for. You will never be strangers to moments of unexpected and inexplicable darkness. You’ve already lived them. And you will have the wisdom like all people of the eclipse do, to stay, and wait, and watch. And then in the bigness of your hearts, you will know how to embrace that thin sliver of light reemerging. You will describe it, you will study it, you will film it, you will measure it, you will sing it, you will tell new stories. Because you are Middlebury. People of the eclipse, we know that you will carry us through the darkness and show us again how to sustain and light the world. My eternal gratitude. [ Applause ]\n\nFemale 2: At this time, to remind the graduates that they go forward from Middlebury, as well with the strength and character of the college, symbolized by the replica of the cane. We will sing “Gamaliel Painter’s Cane.” The song was first sung 107 years ago at the commencement luncheon in June 2017. As with the student address, we restored this song to commencement celebration in 2000, our bicentennial year. The text of the song may be found on page 39 of your program. I invite Catherine Kish of the Class of 2024 — [ Cheering ] — yes, to join us on stage. Catherine will sing the verse and the chorus through once, and then we will all join in singing it through a second time. Graduates, please, and now Laurie as well, make sure you tap your canes when we sing, rap, rap, rap. Please rise as you are able. [ Music ]\n\nCatherine Kish: [Singing] When Gamaliel Painter died. He was Middlebury’s pride. A sturdy pioneer without a stain. And he left his all by will. To the college on the hill. And included in a codicil cane. Oh, its rap, rap, rap, and it’s tap, tap, tap. If you listen you can hear it sounding plain. For a helper true and tried. As the generations glide. There is nothing like Gamaliel Painter’s cane. When Gamaliel Painter died. He was Middlebury’s pride. A sturdy pioneer without a stain. And he left his all by will. To the college on the hill. And included in the codicil cane. Oh, its rap, rap, rap, and it’s tap, tap, tap. If you listen you can hear it sounding plain. For a helper true and tried, as the generations glide. There is nothing like Gamaliel Painter’s cane. [ Cheering ] [ Applause ]\n\nFemale 2: Please remain standing as you are, if able. Muslim Chaplain Zahra Moeini Meybodi will now give the benediction, followed by a closing prayer by Jesse Bruchac of the Nulhegan Band of Konak Abenaki Nation and the Director of the School of Abenaki. To conclude our ceremony today, Catherine will lead us in singing all three verses of the Alma Mater. The lyrics may be found, again, on Page 39 of your program, with two options for the chorus.\n\nZahra Moeini Meybodi: The seed of knowledge is the heart. This is a teaching that is central to the many faiths and wisdom traditions present amongst us today. Especially in my own faith, Islam. Centering the heart as the organ of knowledge has profound ramifications for what we understand educational achievement itself to be. It takes it beyond the books, the papers, the texts, and plants it into the world, and most profoundly, into our character. As we celebrate your hard-earned degrees today, may you also continue to ascend to the unconditional degrees present in your heart. The heart that can be a source of hope for others. The one that uncovers beauty in struggles. The one that finds love while waiting. The one that is awed by truth-seeking. That is joyful in standing against indifference. And most importantly, the one that can’t truly be itself without being kind. Especially towards those who are oppressed and most vulnerable. May your hearts be forever polished, and may your hearts be forever flourishing. [ Foreign language ]\n\nJesse Bruchac: I congratulate you all. May your knowledge lead you to a peaceful and honest life filled with love and compassion for others. Honor those who have come before you, and those yet to come. Acknowledge that all desire a good life, so that your days will be long, and the summer will always be near. [ Foreign language ] With each new day, be thankful for the opportunities it brings you, and like the sun, become the light in the world. Let your light shine before others so that they will see and be inspired by your good deeds everywhere. [ Foreign language ] [ Music ] [ Singing ] [ Cheering, applause ]"
