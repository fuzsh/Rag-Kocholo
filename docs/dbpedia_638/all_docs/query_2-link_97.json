        "text": "Steve Forbes was named Wake Forest basketball's 23rd head coach on April 30, 2020. A 30-year coaching veteran, Coach Forbes is a proven winner and builder of championship cultures with a 369-157 (.702) overall record in his four seasons at Wake Forest, five years at East Tennessee State and at three previous community college head coaching stints.\n\nWake Forest is coming off its first back-to-back appearances in the Quarterfinals of the ACC Tournament since 2007 to end the 2023-24 season. The 2023-24 season also marked the 32nd time in program history that the Demon Deacons had advanced in the ACC Tournament.\n\nThis season also marked Wake Forest’s eighth appearance in the National Invitation Tournament and second in the past three seasons. Additionally, Wake Forest saw a resurgence in season attendance numbers this season with 164,931 fans packing Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum. This marked the highest total attendance since the 2014-15 season when Wake Forest hosted 174,336 fans during the 2014-15 season.\n\nSince the conclusion of the 2023-24 season, Wake Forest now holds a 48-7 record at home since the start of the 2021-22 season including a 17-2 mark this season, the best since having the most home wins in program history during the 2021-22 season when Wake Forest finished with a mark of 18-2. Additionally, it is the first time since the 2008-09 season that the Deacs have had one or fewer losses at LJVM Coliseum. The Demon Deacons overall wins since the start of the 2021-22 season rank second in the country and lead the ACC during that time frame.\n\nWith a regular-season conference record of 11-9 for 2023-24, 10-10 during the 2022-23 season and 13-7 for the 2021-22 season, Wake Forest has had back-to-back-to-back seasons with double-digit ACC wins for the first time since the 1995, ‘96 and ‘97 seasons. Additionally, the 34 ACC wins during that three-year period marked the most since the 2003-05 run and when the Demon Deacons had 35 ACC wins.\n\nWith the win against Notre Dame in the ACC Tournament, Wake Forest reached the 20-win mark for the second time in the last three years. The 65 wins over the last three seasons mark the most wins in a three-year stretch since the 2002-03 to 2004-05 run. The Demon Deacons defeated five teams that reached the NCAA Tournament including at least one Sweet 16 team at the conclusion of Wake Forest’s season.\n\nWith an overall record of 21-14 this season, 19-14 in 2022-23 and 25-10 in 2021-22, Wake Forest has had back-to-back-to-back winning seasons for the first time since 2007-08 (18-13), 2008-09 (24-7) and 2009-10 (20-11). The Deacs also had back-to-back 10-0 starts at home for the first time in program history during 2021-22 and 2022-23 seasons.\n\n2021-22 was one of Wake Forest's best seasons in the past 20 years, finishing the season with 25 wins, the most since 2004-05. With a regular-season conference record of 13-7, Wake Forest tied the single-season program record for ACC wins with 13 (2004-05, 2002-03). With just three league wins during 2020-21, the Deacs had the largest year-to-year improvement ever in ACC win totals with 10. Wake Forest finished conference play fifth in the standings, its highest finish since 2010.\n\nWith a 19-win differential from Forbes’ first year to his second, Wake Forest had one of the largest improvements from year to year in NCAA history. Wake Forest also broke the program for most home wins in a season during the first and second rounds of the NIT for 18 home wins in 2021-22.\n\nAt the conclusion of the regular season, Forbes was named the 2022 Atlantic Coast Conference Coach of the Year, along with Alondes Williams earning ACC Player of the Year and All-ACC First Team honors and Jake LaRavia being named to the All-ACC Second Team.\n\nForbes was the fifth Wake Forest coach to earn the honor and the first since Skip Prosser in 2003. That same season, Josh Howard took home Player of the Year honor and was the last Demon Deacon to garner this prestigious honor before Williams. With Williams and LaRavia's selection on the All-ACC First and Second Team, respectively, they were the first Wake Forest tandem to garner that honor since 2005 (Chris Paul First Team, Justin Gray and Eric Williams Second Team).\n\nWake Forest also had their first postseason appearance since the First Four in 2017, being named a two seed in the National Invitation Tournament and advancing to the Quarterfinals. It was the longest postseason run for the Deacs since 2000, when they won the NIT.\n\nForbes won at least 24 games in each of his five seasons as the head coach for the Buccaneers while finishing third or better in the SoCon every year. ETSU won 130 games and two SoCon championships during his tenure, while all 22 of his seniors earned their ETSU degrees. Forbes joined elite company in 2018-19, becoming one of just 10 active Division I head coaches who have reached the 100-win mark in their first four seasons at an institution.\n\nDuring the 2019-20 season, ETSU was having its best season in program history before the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament. The Bucs finished with a 30-4 record and SoCon regular season and tournament titles. Forbes earned conference coach of the year along with the Hugh Durham Award, given to the most outstanding mid-major coach in the country.\n\nAn assistant under three Final Four coaches over the course of his career, Forbes developed his coaching style under some of best head coaches in the game. National powers Tennessee and Wichita State both reached the pinnacle of success with Forbes on the bench.\n\nThe Vols ascended to their first No. 1 overall ranking in program history in 2008 while winning a program record 31 games. In 2015, Wichita State won a NCAA record 35-straight games to start the season, earning the first No. 1 seed in program history.\n\nIn addition, Forbes spent two record-breaking seasons in College Station, Texas (2004-06) when Texas A&M set a program record for Big 12 Conference wins. Picked to finish last in the Big 12 prior to the 2004-05 season, the Aggies won their first 11 games and went on to a 21-10 record and an appearance in the National Invitation Tournament. In 2005-06, Texas A&M advanced to the NCAA Tournament for the first time since 1987 while recording a 22-9 record, the third-most wins in school history.\n\nA native of Lone Tree, Iowa, Forbes graduated from Southern Arkansas University with a degree in secondary education in 1988. A former baseball student-athlete for the Muleriders, Forbes spent one year at his alma mater as the sports information director before embarking on a coaching career.\n\nForbes and his wife, Johnetta, have three children, Elizabeth, Christopher and Johnathon.\n\nForbes NBA Players (Round Drafted)\n\n• G Alondes Williams (UDFA) – Wake Forest – Brooklyn Nets\n\n• F Jake LaRavia (1st - 19th overall) – Wake Forest – Memphis Grizzlies\n\n• G Fred VanVleet (UDFA) – Wichita State '16 – Toronto Raptors\n\n• G Ron Baker (UDFA) – Wichita State '16 – New York Knicks\n\n• F Cleanthony Early (2nd) – Wichita State '14 – New York Knicks\n\n• F Jordan McRae (2nd) – Tennessee '14 – San Antonio Spurs\n\n• F Tobias Harris (1st – 19th overall) – Tennessee '11 – Milwaukee Bucks\n\n• G Scotty Hopson (UDFA) – Tennessee '11 – Dallas Mavericks\n\n• G Acie Law III (1st – 11th overall) – Texas A&M '07 – Atlanta Hawks\n\n• F Paul Millsap (2nd) – Louisiana Tech '06 – Utah Jazz*\n\n*Recruited to Louisiana Tech but did not coach\n\n• F Antoine Wright (1st – 15th overall) – Texas A&M '05 – New Jersey Nets\n\n• F Kaniel Dickens (2nd) – Idaho '00 – Utah Jazz\n\nEast Tennessee State (2015-20)\n\n• Forbes finished his fifth season with 130 wins and a .748 win percentage.\n\n• After winning his 100th game at ETSU in the 2018-19 season, Forbes joined an elite group as only 10 current active Division I head coaches have reached the 100-win mark in their first four seasons – Shaka Smart, Eric Musselman, Brad Underwood, Josh Pastner, Jamie Dixon, Mark Few, Steve Prohm, Roy Williams, Mike White, Chris Beard and Jim Boeheim.\n\n• Individually in his first four seasons at ETSU, Forbes has coached 10 All-Southern Conference selections, including Desonta Bradford earning Player of the Year and Bo Hodges claiming Freshman of the Year honors in 2017-18.\n\nWichita State (2013-15)\n\n• Helped coach Wichita State to two of the most successful seasons in program history.\n\n• The Shockers went 30-5 on the season and recorded its third consecutive season of 30 wins or more.
