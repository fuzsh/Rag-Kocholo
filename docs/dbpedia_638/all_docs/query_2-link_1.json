        "text": "In a BBC News report in 2004, it was reported that he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis in 1975, but had been in remission for almost 30 years. He put his subsequent remission down to a gluten-free diet and a loving wife.\n\nHad a bad relationship with writer William Goldman on Die Frauen von Stepford (1975), claiming he found Goldman arrogant and reluctant to rewrite his first-draft screenplay. Goldman in turn claimed that Forbes ruined the film by casting his wife Nanette Newman in a key role and that Forbes did all the rewriting himself at nights during filming. Despite this antagonism, Goldman got on well with Forbes' closest friend, Richard Attenborough, when they worked together soon after on both Die Br√ºcke von Arnheim (1977) and Magic - Die Puppe des Grauens (1978). Many years later Attenborough hired Forbes to write the screenplay for Chaplin - Das Leben der unsterblichen Filmlegende (1992), but his draft was subsequently rewritten by . . . William Goldman (and others). As he made clear on Sir Richard Attenborough (1992), Forbes was very upset by this; he had no screenplay credits since then."
