        "text": "She also has a sharp view on the ever-changing mood of film-making today. “What annoys me is that people go on endlessly about the lack of women in films or there not being enough parts for black actors,” she says. “If you have the talent, you will get the role. If you are a black actor, I would not insult you by casting you for a part just by the colour of your skin. Nor would I want to change a part just because a woman would play it.\n\n“Can Juliet in Romeo And Juliet be black? Yes of course she can be black – but is she talented? There is a danger we can become dictatorial about such things.\n\n“As for salaries they must be the same between men and women, but we must not become militant.” One of her own big paydays came in the 1980s with a long-running advertisement campaign for Fairy Liquid, always known by the slogan: “Now hands that do dishes can feel as soft as your face.”\n\nBut Nanette’s own hands were never used, she says. “I met up with someone the other day near where I live in Virginia Water who asked ‘Do you remember me?’” she says. “I dread that question and, no, I didn’t.\n\n“She turned out to be the ‘hands lady’ from all my adverts. She had beautiful hands and it was hers that you saw in the close-ups. I have to accept that after a 40-year film career I still get people who simply ask me: ‘When are you going to do the washing up?’”\n\nA newly restored version of The Raging Moon will be released on DVD and Blu-Ray on November 23 as part of Studiocanal’s Vintage Classics collection"
