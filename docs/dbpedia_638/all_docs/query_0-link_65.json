        "text": "The BBC is celebrating the 30th anniversary of Live and Kicking, the children's Saturday morning magazine show that launched on BBC One on 2 October, 1993.\n\nLive and Kicking, which made stars of many of its presenters including Jamie Theakston and Zoe Ball, replaced Going Live! on the Saturday morning BBC slot, and ran for eight years until September 2001.\n\nSince the show ended two of the presenters of Live and Kicking have married each other and one's career has hit a bump in the road after they were caught up in a scandal.\n\nSo who were the faces of Live and Kicking and where are they now?\n\nAndi Peters\n\nAndi Peters was already a familiar face to Children's BBC viewers along with hand puppet Edd the Duck sidekick.\n\nThey moved out of the Broom Cupboard to the Live and Kicking studio when the morning show replaced Going Live! in 1993 and played host to popstars, performed sketches and introduced competition.\n\nPeters, 53, went on to work as a producer as well as a presenter on a number of hit shows, including Top Of The Pops, The O-Zone and Channel 4 reality show Shipwrecked.\n\nWhen he moved to Channel 4 in 1998 he is credited with creating T4, the successful weekend morning TV show aimed at young people.\n\nHe can now be seen as a regular guest host on TV weekday morning show This Morning.\n\nEmma Forbes\n\nEmma Forbes joined Peters as co-host of the new kids breakfast show, having hosted the cooking slot on predecessor Going Live!.\n\nHer TV success in the 90s landed her the role as the face of Head and Shoulders shampoo.\n\nShe left Live and Kicking in 1996 and went on to co-host the breakfast show on Heart Radio, and has hosted shows on BBC Radio 2, including co-presenting Saturday evening show Going Out With Alan Carr until 2010.\n\nForbes, 58, was a presenter on The Alan Titchmarsh Show until 2014 and the mother-of-two has voiced Mummy Hippo on Peppa Pig.\n\nZoe Ball\n\nZoe Ball was already known for presenting Top Of The Pops and The Big Breakfast when she was announced as the new co-host of Live and Kicking in 1996.\n\nThe daughter of kids TV presenter Johnny Ball, she went on to become the first female host of the Radio One Breakfast show.\n\nBall, 52, competed in Strictly Come Dancing in 2005 and then landed the job as host of Strictly: It Takes Two from 2011 to 2021.\n\nShe has been the host of the Radio 2 Breakfast show since 2019 and stars on Celebrity Gogglebox with her son Woody.\n\nJamie Theakston\n\nJamie Theakston had presented BBC music show The O Zone and Top Of The Pops before he was signed up as Zoe Ball's co-host on Live and Kicking.\n\nHe has since DJ-ed shows on Radio One and Radio 5 and presented Channel 4 reality TV show The Games with Kirsty Gallacher.\n\nTheakston, 52, even did a stint presenting This Morning briefly in the summer of 2013 with Emma Bunton.\n\nSince 2005 he has co-hosted radio morning show Heart Breakfast and his current co-presenter is Amanda Holden.\n\nSteve Wilson\n\nSteve Wilson, 49, co-hosted Live and Kicking with Irish presenter Emma Ledden between 1999 and 2000.\n\nHe went on to co-present on CITV with Holly Willoughby and is now known to This Morning viewers for hosting the gadget slot.\n\nOrtis Deley\n\nOrtis Deley, 52, began his career on CBBC and joined Live and Kicking in 2000 as one of four new co-presenters.\n\nAt this time ratings were starting to plummet due to the popularity of ITV rival SM:TV Live hosted by Ant McPartlin and Declan Donnelly.\n\nDeley has gone on to have a successful presenting career in TV and radio and has had several minor acting roles including in Kidulthood and The Bill.\n\nHe has co-presented on The Gadget Show since 2009.\n\nKatie Hill\n\nBlue Peter presenter Katy Hill joined Live and Kicking in 2000.
