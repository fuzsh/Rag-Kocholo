        "text": "LONDON (Reuters) — British film director Bryan Forbes, whose work included the 1970s thriller The Stepford Wives and International Velvet, has died.\n\nHe was 86.\n\nForbes was born John Theobald Clarke in 1926 in east London and made his screen acting debut in 1948.\n\nHe landed supporting parts in several notable British films, including An Inspector Calls and The Colditz Story.\n\nIn 1959, he set up Beaver Films with director Richard Attenborough. Forbes wrote their first film, The Angry Silence, which featured Attenborough in the lead role.\n\nForbes was nominated for an Oscar in 1961 and won a British Academy of Film and Television Arts award.\n\nHis directing career began in 1961 with Whistle Down the Wind, featuring child star Hayley Mills, but his best-known films internationally were The Stepford Wives (1975), based on the novel by Ira Levin, and the horse-racing sequel International Velvet (1978), starring Tatum O’Neal."
