        "text": "Sandra Forbes\n\nGod graced His earth when He gave life to Sandra 77 years ago, and He called her back to His Kingdom just before dawn on April 11th. She carried herself with dignity, elegance and grace. Her only wish was to have a loving family, and because of her love she produced that family. She and her husband Charles “Sonny” Forbes III found great joy with her children, daughter Teresa Thacker Haskin (David), sons Harold Scott Thacker (Ellen), and Clifton Brian Thacker (Laurie). And they gave her 11 grandchildren: Trace, Nicholas, Ian, Odessa, Robert, Michael and her “Ladybugs” Claire, Rebekah, Julianna, Emma and Zhen. She loved her sister Pam, and her brothers Harold Jr. and Donald. Her family was complete and loving. She knew her job was finished and she rejoiced in them. Sandra set the standard in honesty, goodness, and a winning attitude to friends and family. For all who knew her, they were enriched by her life and her family lost a special person. Heaven gained a special angel. A memorial service for Sandra will be held at St. Mark Lutheran Church in Yorktown on Sunday, May 1st, at 3:00 PM. Arrangements by Amory Funeral Home, Grafton, Va."
