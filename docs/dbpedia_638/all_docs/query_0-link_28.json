        "text": "If you grew up in the late 1990s to mid 2000s, or you had TV-watching children during that time, you undoubtedly know The Amanda Show, Drake & Josh, All That, Zoey 101 and iCarly. You may not know that the same man, Dan Schneider, created and produced all of those shows.\n\nThey were known for their peppy child performers and silly gags, but a new documentary draws back the curtain on allegations of toxic and even predatory behavior on set.\n\nQuiet on Set: The Dark Side of Kids TV, which had its debut Sunday on Investigation Discovery and concluded on Monday, uncovers some disturbing allegations, including “abuse, sexism, racism, and inappropriate dynamics with its underage stars and crew,” according to show materials.\n\nPerhaps the biggest reveal is that Drake Bell, one of the stars of Drake & Josh, comes forward for the first time as the child star sexually assaulted by Brian Peck, who was convicted in 2004 of a lewd act against a child and oral copulation of a person under 16.\n\nThe documentary doesn’t lean into the salaciousness but rather raises questions about how this type of behavior could be identified and avoided in the future, and whether there are enough protections for child actors. The answer is clearly, “no.”\n\nFollowing the release of the documentary, Schneider appeared in a 19-minute video interview with BooG!E, who played T-Bo on iCarly. “Watching over the past two nights was very difficult—facing my past behaviors, some of which are embarrassing and that I regret. I definitely owe some people a pretty strong apology,” Schneider said in the video. “When I watched the show, I could see the hurt in some people’s eyes, and it made me feel awful and regretful and sorry. I wish I could go back, especially to those earlier years of my career, and bring the growth and the experience that I have now and just do a better job and never, ever feel like it was OK to be an asshole to anyone, ever.”\n\nHere are seven revelations from the documentary and a discussion with the directors Mary Robertson and Emma Schwartz that could — and should — raise real concerns about industry practices.\n\n1. The Documentary Had Several Inspirations\n\nRobertson notes a confluence of events that included the release of former iCarly star Jennette McCurdy’s bestselling memoir (I’m Glad My Mom Died) recounting problematic events on set; reporting about toxic sets under Schneider by Business Insider’s Kate Taylor (who collaborated on the documentary series); and the release of YouTube videos that compiled disturbing clips from Schneider’s shows.\n\n“In many of these clips, there was behavior that arguably could be characterized as quite sexual in nature and featured children,” Robertson said. “Some of these clips included Ariana Grande leaning off the side of the bed, pouring water on her chest and her face in a manner that is arguably sexual. Jamie Lynn Spears, who was then a teenager, a young teenager, receiving a squirt of this viscous substance sort of glue like on her face. Or Ariana Grande, squeezing a potato in a manner that many felt was quite sexual.”\n\n2. The Directors Reached Out To Hundreds Of People For Interviews\n\nRobertson, Schwartz and the production team scanned IMDB lists of actors, writers, producers and others who worked on Schneider’s shows.\n\n“We had spreadsheets with hundreds of names on them,” Schwartz said. “We reached out to as many people as possible, many of whom, even if they weren't ready to speak, were really excited that somebody was actually going to take this seriously. They've seen attempts before that had never really landed.”\n\n3. The Amanda Show Spurred A Lawsuit Over Gender Discrimination\n\nThe program starring a young Amanda Bynes had just two female writers, Jenny Kilgen and Christy Stratton, who say they were forced to split a single salary for their work. Kilgen says in the documentary that she was forced to watch pornography and that Stratton, who was fired after one season, once presented an idea at the writers’ table while someone pretended to sodomize her. Kilgen later filed a gender discrimination lawsuit against Schneider’s production company alleging she didn’t receive equal pay. The suit was settled.\n\n4. All That Cast Members Felt Uncomfortable With Their Stunts\n\nBryan Hearne, who was on All That for two seasons, detailed stunts and costumes that made him feel uncomfortable, including one scene in which a dog licked peanut butter put all over his body body. Another actor wore a tight-fitting costume with what some described as phallic symbols.\n\nRobertson said they found other examples in footage where a child was urged to put a live scorpion in their mouth and one where the child is asked to drink water from a bathtub that a trucker has supposedly bathed in.\n\n5. Some Of The Wildest Conspiracy Theories Weren’t True\n\nRobertson and Schwartz said that, while what they found was plenty disturbing, not all of it was true.\n\n“We worked diligently to separate fact from fiction,” Robertson said. For instance, they found a production assistant, Jason Handy, who was convicted for child abuse and child pornography in 2004, who worked on set with many kids.\n\n6. Many Were Eager To Finally Tell Their Stories\n\nSchwartz recounted connecting with the mother of Brandi, a child actor who guest-starred on All That and said she received an explicit image sent by Handy.\n\n“When I first reached out to the mother of Brandi, the girl that Jason Handy had solicited and sent the photos to, I didn't even know if I had the right address. And a week later, I got an email from her [the mother], and she was like, ‘You know, I've been waiting 20 years for the right time to talk. And I feel like this is a sign,’” Schwartz said.\n\n7. Some Things Have Changed, But Not Enough\n\nNickelodeon and Schneider ended their relationship in 2018, and the producer had previously always denied allegations of misconduct. Still, his shows were hardly the only ones to generate allegations of problematic work environments for children.\n\n“I think we've made progress but you know, quite possibly, we had a long way to go. So I think that there's a there's a broad sort of mushy thing that we can all engage in, which is just cultivating work environments that distribute power more evenly,” Robertson said.\n\nAdded Schwartz: “When you put together a documentary like this, you hope it will start a broader conversation.”\n\nNote: This story has been updated to reflect Schneider’s response to the documentary."
