        "text": "Topline\n\nAs the Paris Summer Olympics get underway, some of the nearly 600 athletes on Team USA have begun competing including two children of billionaires, while the son-in-law of billionaire Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates will be competing for Egypt.\n\nKey Facts\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We’re launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day’s headlines. Text “Alerts” to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.\n\nWhat To Watch For\n\nLeBron James, meanwhile, is the only billionaire competing in the Olympics, part of a star-studded USA men’s basketball team (James made $128.8 million on and off the court between May 2023 and May 2024, according to Forbes). The men’s team faces South Sudan on Wednesday.\n\nTangent\n\nSome of the highest-paid athletes competing in the Paris summer games are also some of the biggest names in professional basketball, tennis and golf, led by James, a four-time NBA champion. Behind James are Greek forward Giannis Antetokounmpo ($111 million, according to Forbes) and Team USA’s Steph Curry ($102 million). In Olympic golf, Spanish star Jon Rahm leads the pack making $218 million both on the course and off, ahead of Ireland’s Rory McIlroy ($83 million) and Scottie Scheffler ($61 million) of Team USA.\n\nBig Number\n\n$37,500. That’s how much the U.S. Olympic and Paralympic Committee rewards each Team USA athlete who wins gold. Athletes on Team USA will take home $22,500 for each silver medal, and $15,000 for bronze. In addition to the payout, the U.S. committee also offers U.S. athletes and their dependents a healthcare package, including vision, therapy, mental health service and access to sports medicine clinics.\n\nSurprising Fact\n\nTeam USA fielded athletes for the summer games from every U.S. state except for two: North Dakota and Wyoming. Nineteen other states provided five or fewer athletes: Alabama (5), Hawaii (5), Louisiana (5), Arkansas (4), Kansas (4), Kentucky (4), New Hampshire (4), Idaho (3), Oklahoma (3), Vermont (3), Alaska (2), Delaware (2), Mississippi (2), Montana (2), New Mexico (2), Rhode Island (2), South Dakota (2), West Virginia (2), Maine (1) and the U.S. Virgin Islands (1). The state with by far the most athletes competing this year is California, with 144, over Florida (47), Texas (45), Pennsylvania (35) and New York (31).\n\nFurther Reading\n\nForbesThe Highest-Paid Athletes At The Paris OlympicsForbesParis Olympics Opening Ceremony In Photos-Featuring Celine Dion, Lady Gaga And Ariana Grande"
