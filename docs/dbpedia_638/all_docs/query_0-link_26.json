        "text": "Emma, 43, a former children’s presenter, who has worked with co-host Phillip Schofield, 46, before, is said to be “seriously considering” the offer.\n\nAn ITV1 insider said: “There is some concern that the early starts for This Morning might put too much pressure on family life with her two children. She’s weighing it up.”\n\nEmma has two children, Lily, 13, and Sam, 10, and has been married to banker Graham Clempson for 23 years. She took a break from television eight years ago to open her own children’s clothes shop, called Semmalina, in Belgravia.\n\nFern, 51, shocked viewers last week by announcing she was leaving less than a year into a two-year contract. She took over ITV1’s daytime show from Richard Madeley and Judy Finnegan 10 years ago, but will now walk away from a ­reported £700,000 salary in July.\n\nEmma, daughter of actress Nanette Newman and film director Bryan Forbes, said in an interview: “I’m very bad at saying ‘No’. If I’m put on the spot, 99 per cent of the time I’ll say, ‘Yes’.”\n\nShe also revealed: “A common misperception of me is that I’m nice and sweet. In fact, I’m much stronger than people give me credit for.\n\nI am quite stubborn and determined, a true Taurus.” She has a softer side, too, however, adding: “I’m good at chicken soup and sympathy. I’m the person who comes round at four in the morning to sit and chew the fat. I love needy people.”\n\nThe news will shock some of the other favoured contenders, particularly Ruth Langsford, 49, who hosts This Morning’s Friday show, and whose odds at Lad­brokes have shortened to evens from 2/1.\n\nLadbrokes spokesman Nick Weinberg said: “We think Ruth’s practically on the sofa. She seems the natural choice and has attracted most of the early money.”"
