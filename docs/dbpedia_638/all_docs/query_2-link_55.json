        "text": "THE FILM OF EDITH NESBIT’S BOOK THE RAILWAY CHILDREN (1906), produced by Bryan Forbes and directed by Lionel Jeffries, was released in 1970 and won its place in the heart of the British public.\n\nThe story is simple and episodic. The Waterbury family, well-off middle-class inhabitants of a comfortable Edwardian villa in suburban London, are thrown into turmoil when the father is arrested on accusations of espionage. The mother and three children are thrown into (very relative) poverty and forced to move to the Yorkshire Dales to a house near a railway line. (Yes, I know.The ignominy.) The station used in filming is Oakworth Station and you can get to it on the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway. The Bronte Parsonage in Haworth is another location.\n\nThe children have a series of adventures. They prevent a train crash, they take in a Russian political dissident, they rescue a boy who gets trapped in the tunnel. They steal coal, in a good cause. They become friends with the station porter and wave to the old gentleman who is a regular passenger on the 9.15 am down train.\n\nPart of the distinctiveness of The Railway Children is the added resonance it brings to familiar tropes of children’s film and literature. The absent father; an idealised view of childhood in which children are free to roam and have adventures; idyllic rural and natural backgrounds; kindly adults who offer protection and facilitate happy endings are encountered in Arthur Ransome, Enid Blyton, Charles Dickens among many others.\n\nBut here the reasons for the father’s absence place the film in a wider context. His Kafkaesque night-time disappearance, false imprisonment and ultimate vindication, set against the background of the recent Dreyfus affair, reflects the social and political realities that concerned Edith Nesbit, a socialist, political activist and ‘genuine Bohemian’, as Noel Coward called her. The Russian who is rescued by the children is based on Peter Kroptopkin, a Russian anarcho-communist who Nesbit met in London through her friendship with William Morris and George Bernard Shaw. The children’s social conscience and sense of communal responsibility are depicted with warmth. Their charitable activities, at first resented then accepted as coming from the heart, highlight issues of class and poverty.\n\nThe pain of the father’s absence and the difficulties of this new life without him are the emotional background to the whole film. That is what makes the final scene such a powerful moment. The train pulls in, the steam gradually clears to reveal the figure standing on the platform. Bobbie’s (Jenny Agutter’s) cry of ‘Daddy! My Daddy!’ pulls at the heartstrings no matter how many times you see it.\n\nShe is great, as is the whole cast. Also making impressive appearances are the trains. Magnificent steam locomotives with livery colours derived from existing rail lines, brown, apple green, white and maroon, plough through the rolling countryside, linking village and village, town and country, bearing cargoes of loss and hope and reconciliation, and delivering one of film’s most satisfying endings.\n\nFeatured Posts\n\nThe Village by Marghanita Laski caught British society on the cusp of change after the war (Retro Reads: 1950s British Novels)\n\nRetro Reads: The Village by Marghanita Laski On May 7, 1945 the BBC in London interrupted its scheduled programme with a newsflash. The war in Europe was over. The following day would be a national holiday. The celebrations which swept through the country on VE-Day are well documented — the celebrating crowds, the dancing, the […]\n\nThe Cage by Andrea Newman shows how the Sixties arrived late in provincial Britain\n\nAndrea Newman, who died recently, was a British author who is best remembered for her novels which became steamy, gripping television dramas about characters whose family relationships are fraught with sexual tensions and desires.\n\nFemale TV Detectives: Maggie Forbes in The Gentle Touch\n\nLondon Weekend Television’s series The Gentle Touch (1980-1984) was the first British police TV drama series with a female lead. Welcome to our screens, Detective Inspector Maggie Forbes. You paved the way for those who followed, and provided a template of characteristics developed by writers and actors who went on to create a number of […]\n\nShe’s The One: How Jane Austen’s Fanny Price has become a heroine for our times\n\nMy new novel in my series of Modern Jane Austen Variations is called She’s The One and has its basis on the main plot of Mansfield Park. Its characters are modern versions of Jane Austen’s, and the significant events in Austen’s novel have their counterparts in my contemporary story. Mansfield Park rarely takes top place […]\n\nHow Hilary Bailey humanised the Whitechapel victims years before the Jack the Ripper bandwagon got rolling\n\nThe Cry from Street to Street by Hilary Bailey Hilary Bailey’s novel The Cry from Street to Street focuses on the dreadful events in Whitechapel in 1888, when the notorious murderer known as Jack The Ripper brutally killed a number of women and instilled fear and panic into the East End community. A huge industry […]\n\nThe ring of truth: How Green Finger by Adam Faith showed us that all that glitters is not gold (Retro Records)\n\nGreen Finger is a short, snappy number whose tale of woe is offset by the lively, sparky arrangement by music maestro John Barry. The chirpy strings lead us into the story, delivered in Faith’s trademark cockneyish accent. ‘I bought my girl a diamond ring,’ he tells us, ‘Bigger than the morning star.’\n\nThe Seedy Side of Soho in the Swinging Sixties: The Small World of Sammy Lee — Retro Films\n\nOh, the Swinging Sixties, full of fun, glamour and excitement. The clubs! The girls! The boys! But the The Small World of Sammy Lee, written and directed by Ken Hughes, depicts a different reality.\n\nPeyton Place Revisited — Would You Want To Go Home Again?\n\nAs Thomas Wolfe famously said, You Can’t Go Home Again. Re-reading Grace Metalious’s hugely successful 1956 blockbuster novel Peyton Place is an unsettling experience.\n\nDown in the Valley — How Jeannie C Riley Socked It to the Harper Valley PTA\n\nIt’s 50 years since a certain Mrs Johnson, resident of Harper Valley, USA, marched into her daughter’s school and disrupted a meeting of the Parent Teacher Association. In 1968, singer Jeannie C Riley took Tom T Hall’s song Harper Valley PTA to the top of the charts, and plunged us into a world made familiar by books, films and songs.\n\nSharp at Heart: Why We Should Resist the Appeal of Vanity Fair’s Becky Sharp\n\nVanity Fair’s Becky Sharp is a vibrant and compelling creation and we can admire her for many things, not least her ability to captivate and entertain us readers and viewers as well as those she manipulates for her own ends, but to admire her without acknowledging the moral emptiness at her core is to distort the totality of her creation."
