        "text": "August started off on a victorious note for proponents of school choice. That’s because numerous candidates who support Governor Bill Lee’s (R-Tenn.) proposal to make Tennessee’s education savings account program available to all children statewide prevailed in their August 1 primary contests.\n\nThe dynamics at play in the Tennessee Republican primaries shared much in common with the Texas GOP primaries that took place a few months prior. Support for school choice, Governor Lee’s proposal for a universal ESA program in particular, was the main point of contrast between candidates in contested GOP primaries, just as a candidate’s position on Governor Greg Abbott’s (R-Texas) proposal for universal school choice was the dominant point of contrast in the Texas primaries.\n\nAs occurred in Texas this spring, supporters of school choice fared better in Tennessee’s primaries than did opponents. Incumbent Tennessee lawmakers who are well known champions of school choice — such as Representatives Chris Todd (R), Rusty Grills (R), Mary Littleton (R), and Robert Stevens (R) — all prevailed last week over primary challengers who opposed expanded access to ESAs. Anti-school choice incumbents like Senator Frank Niceley (R) and Representative Bryan Richey (R), meanwhile, were defeated by challengers who support Gov. Lee’s effort to expand the state’s existing ESA program.\n\n“The election results were proof that educational choice is popular across Tennessee, particularly among Republicans,” said Justin Owen, president and CEO of the Beacon Center, a Nashville-based think tank. “The Beacon Poll shows that 68% of voters support universal Education Savings Accounts, while 85% of GOP voters support them, and last week's election backs that up.”\n\nEnacted in 2019, Tennessee’s ESA program awards families more than $7,000 annually to pay for private school tuition. Tennessee’s ESA program is currently limited to the state’s three most populous counties. Tennessee lawmakers adjourned their 2024 legislative session without voting on the bill to implement the Governor’s universal ESA proposal. That’s not the end of the debate, however, as Governor Lee will make another push for this proposal in 2025. Governor Lee made a number of endorsements in Republican primaries in which supporters of school choice were going up against opponents, with most of the Lee-endorsed candidates prevailing on August 1.\n\n“Only in Blount County, near Knoxville, did Lee’s pick lose as retired Maryville teacher and football coach Tom Stinnett defeated attorney Jason Emert,” noted Chalkbeat Tennessee. “Numerous legislative incumbents who were considered Lee’s key voucher allies also won their primaries, but there were two big exceptions.”\n\nOpponents of Governor Lee’s effort to expand school choice might celebrate the defeat of pro-school choice incumbents — such as Senator Jon Lundberg (R), Representative John Ragan (R), and Representative Patsy Hazlewood (R), but the main point of contrast in those races, unlike the aforementioned contests, was not school choice.\n\n“Tonight, voters sent a clear message: It’s time to deliver school choice for Tennessee families, strengthen public safety, & keep our economy strong,” Governor Lee said in a statement posted after all the results had come in on primary night. “I look forward to working with the 114th General Assembly to ensure Tennessee remains a beacon of opportunity, security & freedom.”\n\n“Thursday's victories in Tennessee mark yet another seismic shift in our nation’s school choice movement, as parents continue to reward lawmakers who stand with kids and oust those who don’t,” said Tommy Schultz, CEO, American Federation for Children. “Anti-school choice incumbents like Bryan Richey, Frank Niceley, and others across the country have received the message loud and clear that parents will always have the final say when it comes to their kids’ education.”\n\nAs was the case in Texas this spring, supporters of school choice in Tennessee are now optimistic that the results from the August 1 primary will make it more likely that the Governor’s universal school choice proposal can be enacted during the 2025 legislate session.\n\n“Despite the reality-distortion campaign waged by teachers’ unions, their candidates, and legislators who showed their true colors after the candidate filing deadline, Tennessee parents made it clear that they expect legislators to take bold action that will open new opportunities for their children,” Schultz adds. “We look forward to the transformative work ahead as Tennessee’s school choice majority prioritizes student-first policies.”\n\nThe results this year from primary elections in Tennessee, Texas, and other states have improved the prospects for passage of legislation in 2025 to expand school choice. Greater school choice could still get the green light before 2025 in at least one state, Kentucky. Appearing on Kentucky’s 2024 general election ballot is a constitutional amendment that, if approved by voters, would permit the allocation of state funding to non-public schools.\n\nThis constitutional amendment in Kentucky was proposed in response to a 2023 Franklin County Court ruling, in which the judge struck down the commonwealth’s charter school program. The judge ruled that it was unconstitutional to send taxpayer dollars to charter schools. Kentucky lawmakers referred this constitutional amendment in an attempt to salvage the viability of charter schools in the state and provide more education options for families.\n\nThat 2023 ruling in Kentucky was a setback for school choice in the commonwealth, but was an outlier nationally. There has been a tremendous expansion of school choice in recent years, particularly since 2020. Today, 24 states have education tax credit scholarship programs, while 20 have education voucher programs. 14 states have ESA programs, with six of them universally available to all families. Thanks to the primary results in Tennessee this summer, along with those in Texas and other states this spring, the historic expansion of school choice those figures are likely to continue increasing in 2025 and after."
