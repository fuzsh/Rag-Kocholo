        "text": "Chapter Three: Finding My Feet\n\n“I had all sorts of career aspirations but, no surprise, my dream was to become a ballerina. It was my obsession from about the age of ten until 16. I got into the Urdang Academy (having failed to get into the Ballet Rambert and the Royal Ballet School) and I owe a lot to an amazing teacher called Mr Etheridge. He made me realise (in the nicest way) that ballet was my passion rather than my destiny! I was good, but just not quite good enough. In short, I was destined to be the swan at the back of the stage and I didn’t want that. After that, I sort of ‘fell’ into different jobs until I discovered the world of live television.\n\n“I was actually extremely shy as a child – strange considering that I love talking more than anything now! It wasn’t until I got to about 16 years old that everything changed. I was adamant to do something different and craved the adrenaline rush that went with television presenting.”\n\nChapter Four: The Big Break\n\n“My big break came when I got a job working as an assistant to the fashion editor at the Daily Mail. I was mainly tasked with getting the coffees, but I soon became a permanent fixture. Then, one day, the editor said he was buying into satellite TV and asked whether anyone was interested in becoming a presenter. I jumped at the chance and got a gig on a show on a lifestyle TV channel that I don’t think had a single viewer.\n\n“It was funny, really – I did a beauty slot with zero beauty experience and used to make things like face masks in a Magimix which I lugged into the studio on the tube. But it was a start – and, crucially, enough to give me a showreel. After relentlessly asking the editor of Going Live (the Saturday morning kids’ BBC show) for an opportunity for a year, he finally caved and met with me. I remember that day like it was yesterday and thinking I would do anything to work here. He asked what I could bring to the show and off the top of my head I said ‘cookery’. The following Saturday I presented my first six-minute live slot with Phillip Schofield. As the weeks went on, the segment took off.”\n\nChapter Five: Alive & Kicking\n\n“Around this time, I was offered a job at The Big Breakfast with Chris Evans, but turned it down in the hope that, post Going Live, I’d be up for the next big Saturday morning show. It was a gamble that paid off. Without sounding sickly, being on Live & Kicking were some of the happiest days of my life. I loved everything about it – from the Fridays spent in the office sorting through the fan mail to eating baked potatoes in the BBC canteen, not to mention the team and general camaraderie.\n\n“It was an extraordinary opportunity to present for three and a quarter hours live with no auto cue and no script – that’s pretty much unheard of these days. I also got to interview incredible people who – at that time – stuck around for the whole morning. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. I also made lifelong friends in Andi Peters and John Barrowman – I’m still very close to them today.\n\n“Certain aspects of being on television were very glamorous; I would be lying if I said otherwise. I loved getting my make-up done, having a wardrobe budget – there were a lot of upsides and I’m grateful to have been on TV when there wasn’t the added stress of paparazzi and social media. That said, I was quite naïve and had my parents to ground me. As my career grew, there were the inevitable stresses that came with the territory, such as the overwhelming anxiety that you were always ‘replaceable’. It was quite hard to deal with.\n\n“Plus, there were jobs I really wanted but missed out on, like the breakfast show at Capital radio. I also remember being told I was a shoo-in for This Morning and for the first time truly believing the publicity… only to realise I wasn’t actually in the running at all!”\n\nChapter Six: Time To Be A Radio Star\n\n“Radio became a bigger part of my career later on – probably a result of having children. I got the Heart breakfast show with Jono Coleman and the working hours were ideal. I could leave in the morning, spend the rest of the day with my kids, put them to bed in the evenings and be off at weekends. It turned out I loved live radio as much as TV – I didn’t think that would be the case, but it felt intoxicating. It’s less glamorous for sure – and obviously zero clothing budget – but it was still the same authentic conversations I’d loved having on television.\n\n“I also worked at BBC Radio 2, standing in with Alan Carr for Steve Wright when he was on holiday. It was the dream scenario – and led to Alan and I landing our own Saturday night show. As you can imagine, there was never a dull moment. Alan was so fun to work with and it was a different style for me. There’s nothing better than working with someone who makes you laugh.”\n\nChapter Seven: The Man Of The Hour\n\n“My husband Graham and I have been married for almost 35 years. It’s crazy to think how quickly the time has passed. Initially, he was my best friend – which is always a good start – and we were roommates. I dated his best friend for three years while Graham was living in New York, but we regularly got together as a group. The irony was, I was always trying to find Graham a girlfriend. Then, at a time when we were both single, we realised there was more than just friendship between us. It was a whirlwind. We went out for three months, got engaged, got married three months later and the rest is history.\n\n“The secret to our relationship, if you ask me, is that we met before either of us had any success in our careers. It can definitely go either way, but we’ve totally supported each other and are each other’s biggest cheerleaders. We also had a strong friendship first, so we were able to grow together. We also didn’t have children for the first ten years – we did lots of travelling and fun things as a couple. He’s always my voice of reason and was definitely my agent’s nightmare, as he would pick up on all the small details. I’m very lucky.”"
