        "text": "July 19, 2015\n\nFor a long time I had no idea this was a book, and my surprise and elation were fantastically high when I found out. I ordered it IMMEDIATELY. As a life-long devotee/worshipper of International Velvet, I couldn't resist. This movie was my childhood.\n\n1. The summary sucks.\n\n2. It's essentially the same as the movie, only it explains a little more and makes a bit more sense.\n\n3. They still leave out key details, but I'll live. It's one of the many charms of International Velvet.\n\n4. I just want to know how much money she paid for Arizona Pie (quite a lot of money doesn't suffice for me).\n\n5. IT'S THE FOAL!!!\n\n6. Sarah Brown is completely unlikeable.\n\n7. OH MY GOD SOME OF THE LINES IN THIS BOOK ARE LEGENDARY (some things just don't make sense at a PG rating)\n\n8. Why was this made? I'm so glad it was though...\n\n9. OH MY GOSH I FORGOT HOW MUCH I LOVE THIS\n\nLiterally, just read this and watch the movie. It's like the king of bad horse movies and it's everything I stand for and love about life. That is all. PS: Bryan Forbes, u da real MVP\n\nApril 7, 2012\n\nI couldn't not read this, when I came across it in childhood. It was about horses, it was a sequel to National Velvet (still one of the finest \"horse books\" evah) and it was in my grubby paws. Sadly it was no National Velvet. Hints of failure and sadness permeate the book; Velvet (the heroine from the original book) is older, wiser and sadly no longer a rider. The transcendence of National Velvet is not in evidence in this book.\n\nAugust 12, 2017\n\nInternational Velvet is a childhood favorite of mine, and I'm sure one of my stars is pure nostalgia, but I love rereading this novel. It is rather fast-paced, and so the author doesn't dig as deep into many events that could merit their own story even, but that is part of the charm. You never have time to get mired down in details, never time to get bored or question the characters, it is simply a manic drive to find a way to help Sarah realize her dreams.\n\nInternational Velvet ties itself to National Velvet through the character of Velvet, who is now faced with raising her taciturn niece Sarah. I'll be honest, the timeline on their ages never feels quite right if you are thinking of the original book, but I try not to dwell on that. Instead, I accept that Velvet has not quite had the life she dreamed of, but has a chance at redemption through her niece. Sarah herself is quite sympathetic as a character because she's been dealt a bad hand in life, and doesn't have the tools to overcome it on her own. Through the understanding tutelage of her aunt and uncle, and a lot of hard work, Sarah does have a second chance at happiness herself, and she grabs it with both hands.\n\nThis is a wonderful horse book, and the story of a family drawn together through circumstance and held together by love. The realistic way in which Velvet and John's relationship is written, as well as the careless disregard for others that Sarah often embodies reeks of typical teen, and these character flaws help the story feel more natural, considering the lofty goals everyone has for Sarah's riding career. Little girls everywhere hold their breath while thinking of dreams coming true as they read International Velvet - you can do it, Sarah!\n\nFebruary 4, 2017\n\nThis is SUCH a weird book - in exactly the same ways the movie is weird. Don't get me wrong, I love the movie! I went into the book hoping it would maybe help explain or justify the ridiculous ending, and...no such luck.\n\nSeptember 15, 2017\n\nThis was a wonderful book. I remember watching the movie when I was younger and loving it…reading the book now brought back all those feelings.\n\nSeptember 9, 2012\n\nI got this book in 1977 for Christmas and loved it. But be forewarned, it is not the same book as its predecessor, National Velvet. Even at fourteen, I was disappointed to find that Velvet had changed and the writer had written her more ‘modern’ in terms of her morals. However, I did enjoy being introduced to the character, Sarah Brown, her niece. It’s a fun book for teens and horse lovers. I loved the movie just as much as the book which is unusual. Normally the book is far superior than the movie, but this time they did a pretty good job in staying with the book. The cast includes, Tatum O'Neal, as Sarah Brown, Nanette Newman as Velvet, and Christopher Plummer as John. And one mustn't forget the great Anthony Hopkins as Sarah's coach/trainer.\n\nAugust 6, 2016\n\nYeah, that's about it. It's a halfway decent story about going for the gold in a 1970s Summer Olympics but to attach it to the universe of National Velvet should be illegal. I think the movie was made before the book which explains the assholery involved. I sort of liked the movie when I was a kid but then I learned not only about reality but that the horse in National Velvet was a piebald gelding -- not a stallion as mentioned here.\n\nMay 11, 2016\n\nInternational Velvet is about a young girl named Sara who lives in Arizona, United States. That is until her parents die in a car accident and she has to move to England to live with her aunt and uncle. Sara is very upset about this, and has a very bad attitude. Sara's aunt, Velvet, has a horse that is a champion jumper. When it is time for Velvet's horse to retire and have his last foal, Sara decides to save up her money and buy the foal. This is a very good book. It is written very well and it is a very good story of hard work and the bond between horse and rider.\n\nJune 30, 2016\n\nPretty much the exact story of the movie but with a bit more detail. If I hadn't seen the film then that's great but having watched the film several times over the years it makes the book a little lacking.\n\nMay 6, 2010\n\nMy children loved this book. It's a classical horse story that is loved by all ages."
