        "text": "Monophyletic origin of domestic bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and its evolutionary relationship with the extant wild camel (Camelus bactrianus ferus)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJi, R; Cui, P; Ding, F; Geng, J; Gao, H; Zhang, H; Yu, J; Hu, S; Meng, H\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe evolutionary relationship between the domestic bactrian camel and the extant wild two-humped camel and the factual origin of the domestic bactrian camel remain elusive. We determined the sequence of mitochondrial cytb gene from 21 camel samples, including 18 domestic camels (three Camelus bactrianus xinjiang, three Camelus bactrianus sunite, three Camelus bactrianus alashan, three Camelus bactrianus red, three Camelus bactrianus brown and three Camelus bactrianus normal) and three wild camels (Camelus bactrianus ferus). Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that the extant wild two-humped camel may not share a common ancestor with the domestic bactrian camel and they are not the same subspecies at least in their maternal origins. Molecular clock analysis based on complete mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that the sub-speciation of the two lineages had begun in the early Pleistocene, about 0.7 million years ago. According to the archaeological dating of the earliest known two-humped camel domestication (5000â6000 years ago), we could conclude that the extant wild camel is a separate lineage but not the direct progenitor of the domestic bactrian camel. Further phylogenetic analysis suggested that the bactrian camel appeared monophyletic in evolutionary origin and that the domestic bactrian camel could originate from a single wild population. The data presented here show how conservation strategies should be implemented to protect the critically endangered wild camel, as it is the last extant form of the wild tribe Camelina.

However, no information on Anaplasma infection in two-humped Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) in China has been published to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. in domestic Bactrian camels and ticks in Xinjiang, China. A total of 382 ticks were collected from the Bactrian camels and from environmental sources. Of these, 84 were morphologically identified as belonging to the Rhipicephalus sanguineus group and genetically identified (12S rDNA, 16S rDNA and the cytochrome c oxidase 1 genes) as R. sanguineus group ticks (temporally designated as Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang). PCR testing showed that 7.2% (20/279) of the camels harbored Anaplasma platys DNA. However, microscopic examination revealed no A. platys inclusions in blood smears from the camels. The PCR prevalence of A. platys DNA was 9.5% (6/63) in Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang from the Bactrian camels and 14.3% (3/21) in Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang from the vegetation. A. platys DNA was not detected by PCR in other tick species (Hyalomma asiaticum, Dermacentor niveus and Hyalomma dromedarii), and no other Anaplasma species were detected in these samples. This is the first report of A. platys in Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China. The moderate positivity observed indicates that these animals might be a natural host for this pathogen in China.\n\nAnatomical subdivisions of the stomach of the Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus).\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, J L; Lan, G; Wang, G X; Li, H Y; Xie, Z M\n\n2000-08-01\n\nTwenty stomachs of Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) were studied by gross dissection. Based on the configuration of the stomach and the structure of the mucous membrane, the stomach was divided into three ventricles that differ from the arrangement described for ox and sheep. The first and second ventricles of the proventriculus of camel form one stomach rather than two different stomachs. These ventricles of the proventriculus do not correspond to the rumen and reticulum of ox and sheep. The third ventricle appears to be the abomasum. One part of the abomasum has reticular mucosal folds that indicate it is not the reticulum. A second part of the abomasum has longitudinal mucosal folds suggesting it is not the omasum. Three glandular sac areas associated with the preventriculus and abomasum are also described.

This study aimed to examine the alternative noninvasive and cheap methods of pregnancy diagnosis from urine in domestic Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus). Urine from 14 female camels kept in four European zoologic gardens was collected and tested by two chemical tests--Cuboni reaction and barium chloride test. The Cuboni reaction was significantly (P<0.01) affected by the pregnancy status of female camels. The total accuracy of the Cuboni reaction was 70.5% but it increased significantly (P<0.05) in the time leading up to parturition. The accuracy was 100% in the 3rd third of pregnancy. Urine of nonpregnant females did not react with a solution of barium chloride while, contrary to other studies, white precipitates formed mostly (80 to 100%) in urine of pregnant females. This study concluded that the Cuboni reaction is applicable for pregnancy diagnosis in camels.\n\nHost specificity of Enterocytozoon bieneusi genotypes in Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) in China.\n\nPubMed\n\nQi, Meng; Li, Junqiang; Zhao, Aiyun; Cui, Zhaohui; Wei, Zilin; Jing, Bo; Zhang, Longxian\n\n2018-04-02\n\nEnterocytozoon bieneusi is an obligate, intracellular fungus and is commonly reported in humans and animals. To date, there have been no reports of E. bieneusi infections in Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus). The present study was conducted to understand the occurrence and molecular characteristics of E. bieneusi in Bactrian camels in China. Of 407 individual Bactrian camel fecal specimens, 30.0% (122) were E. bieneusi-positive by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based on internal transcriber spacer (ITS) sequence analysis. A total of 14 distinct E. bieneusi ITS genotypes were obtained: eight known genotypes (genotype EbpC, EbpA, Henan-IV, BEB6, CM8, CHG16, O and WL17), and six novel genotypes (named CAM1 to CAM6). Genotype CAM1 (59.0%, 72/122) was the most predominant genotype in Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, and genotype EbpC (18.9%, 23/122) was the second-most predominant genotype. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that six known genotypes (EbpC, EbpA, WL17, Henan-IV, CM8 and O) and three novel genotypes (CAM3, CAM5 and CAM6) fell into the human-pathogenic group 1. Two known genotypes (CHG16 and BEB6) fell into the cattle host-specific group 2. The novel genotypes CAM1, CAM 2 and CAM4 cluster into group 8. To our knowledge, this is the first report of E. bieneusi in Bactrian camels. The host-specific genotype CAM1 was the predominant genotype, which plays a negligible role in the zoonotic transmission of E. bieneusi. However, the second-most predominant genotype, EbpC, has greater zoonotic potential.\n\nA complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the wild two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus ferus): an evolutionary history of camelidae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCui, Peng; Ji, Rimutu; Ding, Feng; Qi, Dan; Gao, Hongwei; Meng, He; Yu, Jun; Hu, Songnian; Zhang, Heping\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBackground The family Camelidae that evolved in North America during the Eocene survived with two distinct tribes, Camelini and Lamini. To investigate the evolutionary relationship between them and to further understand the evolutionary history of this family, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the wild two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus ferus), the only wild survivor of the Old World camel. Results The mitochondrial genome sequence (16,680 bp) from C. bactrianus ferus contains 13 protein-coding, two rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes as well as a typical control region; this basic structure is shared by all metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Its protein-coding region exhibits codon usage common to all mammals and possesses the three cryptic stop codons shared by all vertebrates. C. bactrianus ferus together with the rest of mammalian species do not share a triplet nucleotide insertion (GCC) that encodes a proline residue found only in the nd1 gene of the New World camelid Lama pacos. This lineage-specific insertion in the L. pacos mtDNA occurred after the split between the Old and New World camelids suggests that it may have functional implication since a proline insertion in a protein backbone usually alters protein conformation significantly, and nd1 gene has not been seen as polymorphic as the rest of ND family genes among camelids. Our phylogenetic study based on complete mitochondrial genomes excluding the control region suggested that the divergence of the two tribes may occur in the early Miocene; it is much earlier than what was deduced from the fossil record (11 million years). An evolutionary history reconstructed for the family Camelidae based on cytb sequences suggested that the split of bactrian camel and dromedary may have occurred in North America before the tribe Camelini migrated from North America to Asia. Conclusion Molecular clock analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes from C. bactrianus ferus and L. pacos suggested that the\n\nMolecular diversity of methanogens in fecal samples from Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) at two zoos.\n\nPubMed\n\nTurnbull, Kathryn L; Smith, Rachel P; St-Pierre, Benoit; Wright, AndrÃ©-Denis G\n\n2012-08-01\n\nAnimals are dependent on mutualistic microbial communities that reside in their gastrointestinal track for essential physiological functions such as nutrition and pathogen resistance. The composition of microbial communities in an animal is influenced by various factors, including species, diet and geographical location. In this preliminary study, the population structure of fecal methanogens in Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) from two zoos was studied using separate 16S rRNA gene libraries for each zoo. While methanogen sequences belonging to the genus Methanobrevibacter were dominant in both libraries, they showed significant differences in diversity (p=0.05) and structure (p<0.0001). Population structure analysis revealed that only two operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were shared between libraries, while two OTUs were unique to the Southwick Zoo library and seven OTUs were unique to the Potter Park Zoo library. These preliminary results highlight how methanogen population structures can vary greatly between animals of the same species maintained in captivity at different locations.

The First Description of Allosuckling in Domestic Bactrian Camel (Camelus bactrianus)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrandlovÃ¡, KarolÃ­na; BartoÅ¡, LudÄk; HaberovÃ¡, Tamara\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAllosuckling is a situation when a female nurses a non-filial offspring. It was described in various ungulate species; however for camels this is the first description of this behaviour. The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of allosuckling in captive camels (Camelus bactrianus) and to test whether it can be explained as a âmilk-theftâ (opportunistic behaviour of calves) or alternatively as an altruistic behaviour of females. During 2005 and 2007, nine camel females and ten calves in four zoological gardens in the Czech Republic were observed. In total, 373 sucking bouts were recorded, from which 32 were non-filial (the calf sucked from the non-maternal female). Allosuckling regularly appeared in captive camel herds. As predicted for the milk-theft explanation, the non-filial calves sucked more often in the lateral position and even did not suck in the antiparallel position at all. The non-filial calves preferably joined the filial calf when sucking but in five cases (15.6% of non-filial sucking bouts) the calves sucked from non-maternal dam without the presence of filial calf. We then expected the differences in terminations of sucking bouts by females but did not find any difference in sucking terminations for filial and non-filial calves. As the calves were getting older, the incidence of allosucking increased. This was probably because skills of the calf to outwit the non-maternal dam increased and/or the older calves might be more motivated for allosucking due to the weaning process. Finally, duration of a sucking bout was shorter with non-filial than filial calves. The results of the study support the hypothesis of âmilk theftâ, being mostly performed by calves behaving as opportunistic parasites, but we cannot reject certain level of altruism from the allonursing females or their increased degree of tolerance to non-filial calves.

Also, the embryos reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred into the uterus of synchronized dromedary camel recipients to explore the possibility of using them as surrogate mothers. Serum-starved skin fibroblast cells were injected into the perivitelline space of enucleated mature oocytes, collected from super-stimulated dromedary camels, and fused using an Eppendorf electroporator. After activation with 5Î¼M ionomycin and 6-dimethylaminopurine, they were cultured at 38.5Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 in air. In experiment 1, Day 7 blastocysts were stained with Hoechst to count their cell numbers, while in experiment 2, they were transferred to synchronized dromedary recipients. A lower number (P < 0.05) of blastocysts were obtained from reconstructs utilizing fibroblast cells from Llama when compared with those reconstructed with dromedary and Bactrian fibroblast cells. However, no difference was observed in their cell numbers. In experiment 2, a higher (P < 0.05) proportion of blastocysts were obtained from the cleaved embryos reconstructed with Bactrian fibroblast cells when compared to those reconstructed with dromedary cells. Twenty-six Day 7 blastocysts reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred to 23 synchronized dromedary recipients with 5 pregnancies established on Day 30, however, only one of the pregnancies developed to term and a healthy calf weighing 33 kgs was born after completing 392 days of gestation.

Selected PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs were measured in pools of milk from camels (n=15) located in various places of Kazakhstan (Almaty, Atyrau, Aralsk, Shymkent) and sampled at two different seasons for two different species (Camelus bactrianus and Camelus dromedarius). Non-dioxin-like (NDL-)PCB concentrations (6.3Â±2.7 ng g(-1) fat, median 5.1 ng g(-1) fat, range 0.6-17.4 ng g(-1) fat) were far below the maximum value of 40 ng g(-1) fat proposed by the EU. Dioxin-like (DL-)PCB concentrations (1.7Â±0.7 ng g(-1) fat, median 1.5 ng g(-1) fat, range 0.3-4.2 ng g(-1) fat) and the NDL-PCB to DL-PCB ratio (4.3) were similar to what is reported in EU for cow-based dairy products. PCB 52 and PCB 101 appeared to be proportionally more present in Kazakh camel milk samples (>60% of the sum of the 6 indicator NDL-PCBs) than in European cow milk samples (<10% of the sum of the 6 indicator NDL-PCBs), indicating possible differences in the route of exposure to PCBs in Kazakhstan. PCB 105 and PCB 118 appeared to be present at higher concentrations in camel milk (>80% of the sum of the 12 DL-PCBs). PCB 105, PCB 118 and PCB 156 were the major congeners for DL-PCBs, accounting for 92% of the sum of concentrations of DL-PCBs (88% for Belgian cows). In terms of TEQ, PCB 126 and PCB 118 are the major contributors and represent, respectively, 80% and 14% of the DL-PCB TEQWHO05 concentrations. No significant interracial or geographical trends were observed for NDL- and DL-PCB profiles. However, concentrations of all DL-PCBs appeared to be significantly higher for samples collected in Atyrau region. 2,3,7,8-TCDD level (mean 0.08Â±0.07 pg g(-1) fat, median 0.08 pg g(-1) fat, range 0\n\nIsolation and molecular characterization of partial FSH and LH receptor genes in Arabian camels (Camelus dromedarius)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJelokhani-Niaraki, Saber; Tahmoorespur, Mojtaba; Bitaraf-Sani, Morteza\n\n2015-01-01\n\nVery little is known about LHR and FSHR genes of domestic dromedary camels. The main objective of this study was to determine and analyze partial genomic regions of FSHR and LHR genes in dromedary camels for the first time. To this end, a total of50 DNA samples belonging to dromedary camels raised in Iran were sent for sequencing (25 samples of each gene). We compared the nucleotide sequences of Camelus dromedarius with corresponding sequences of previously published FSHR and LHR genes in bactrian camels and other species. According to the data, the same nucleotide variation was identified in both regions of the two camel species. The alignment of deduced protein sequences of the two different species revealed an amino acid variation at the FSHR region. No evidence of amino acid variation was observed, however, in LHR sequences. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both camel species had a close relationship and clustered together in a separate branch. This was further confirmed by genetic distance values illustrating significant sequence identity between Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus. Interestingly, sequence comparisons revealed heterozygote patterns in FSHR sequences isolated from dromedary camels of Iran. In comparison to other species, this camel contains three amino acid substitutions at 5, 67, and 105 positions in the FSHR coding region. These positions are found exclusively in camels and can be considered as species specific. The results of our study can be used for hormone functionality research (FSHR and LHR) as well as reproduction-linked polymorphisms and breeding programs.

This tumor-specific antigen is ligand independent, contains a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain and has been shown to be present in a number of human malignancies. In this study, we report the production and characterization of camel antibodies that are directed against the external domain of the EGFRvIII. Antibodies developed in camels are smaller (i.e. IgG2 and IgG3 subclasses lack light chains) than any other conventional mammalian antibodies. This property of camel antibodies makes them ideal tools for basic research and other applications such as tumor imaging and cancer therapy. In the present study, camel antibodies were generated by immunization of camelids (Camelus bactrianus and Camelus dromedarius) with a synthetic 14-amino acid peptide corresponding to the mutated sequence of the EGFR, tissue homogenates of several patients with human glioblastoma, medulloblastoma and aggressive breast carcinoma, as well as EGFR-expressing cell lines. Three subclasses of camel IgG [conventional (IgG1, 160 kD) and heavy chain-only antibodies (IgG2 and IgG3, 90 kD)] were separated by their different binding properties to protein A and protein G affinity columns. The anti-EGFRvIII peptide antibodies from immunized camels were purified further using the EGFRvIII synthetic peptide affinity column. The purified anti-EGFRvIII peptide camel antibodies selectively bound to the EGFRvIII peptide and affinity-purified EGFRvIII from malignant tissues and detected a protein band of 140 kD from malignant tissues by Western blot. Affinity analysis showed that the antibodies from C. bactrianus and C. dromedarius reacted with peptide and antigen purified from a small cell lung cancer ascitic fluid with affinities of 2 x 10(8) and 5 x 10(7)M(-1) to the same extent, respectively.

As a result, eight genera containing 24 species with 11 forms were identified. Of them, one species was concluded to be new, then described as Dasytricha kabanii n. sp. This new species was clearly distinguished from D. ruminantium, the other species of the genus, by its lack of somatic cilia on the posterior one-fifth of the body surface. Entodinium nanellum and Epidinium ecaudatum f. caudatum were found in all camels examined. Although the percentage composition of respective species varied with the individual camel, the rate of Entodinium spp. was high in general. Total ciliate density in forestomach fluid was 1.9 x 10(5)/ml on average. Ciliate composition in Egyptian camels was similar to that in Bactrian camels, Camelus bactrianus, in China reported previously. However, more Entodinium species were detected from Egyptian camels than from Bactrian camels.\n\nStudies of thermostability in Camelus bactrianus (Bactrian camel) single-domain antibody specific for the mutant epidermal-growth-factor receptor expressed by Pichia.\n\nPubMed\n\nOmidfar, Kobra; Rasaee, Mohhamad Javad; Kashanian, Soheila; Paknejad, Malieheh; Bathaie, Zahra\n\n2007-01-01\n\nCamelids have a unique immune system capable of producing heavy-chain antibodies lacking the light chains and CH1 (constant heavy-chain domain 1). It has been shown that, in contrast with conventional antibody fragments, the variable domains of these heavy-chain antibodies are functional at or after exposure to high temperatures. In the present study, the VHH (variable domain of heavy-chain antibody) camel antibody was subcloned into vector Ppiczc and expressed in Pichia pastoris. ORB1-83 VHH antibody recognizes the external domain of the mutant EGFR [EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptor], EGFR VIII. This tumour-specific antigen is ligand-independent, contains a constitutively active tyrosine kinase domain and has been shown to be present in a number of human malignancies. We report here that, although expression from P. pastoris resulted in a significantly increased level of expression of the anti-EGFR VIII VHH antibodies compared with Escherichia coli [Omidfar, Rasaee, Modjtahedi, Forouzandeh, Taghikhani, Bakhtiari, Paknejad and Kashanian (2004) Tumor Biol. 25, 179-187; Omidfar, Rasaee, Modjtahedi, Forouzandeh, Taghikhani and Golmakany (2004) Tumor Biol. 25, 296-305], this antibody selectively bound to the EGFR VIII peptide and reacted specifically with the immunoaffinity-purified antigen from non-small-cell lung cancer. Furthermore, thermal denaturation stability and CD spectra analysis of the Camelus bactrianus (Bactrian camel) VHH and heavy-chain antibodies at different temperature proved reversibility and binding activity after heat denaturation. Our results indicate that the P. pastoris expression system may be useful for the expression of camel single domain antibody and the ability of the expressed protein to reversibly melt without aggregation, allowing it to regain binding activity after heat denaturation.\n\nGenetic diversity and phylogeographic structure of Bactrian camels shown by mitochondrial sequence variations.\n\nPubMed\n\nMing, L; Yi, L; Sa, R; Wang, Z X; Wang, Z; Ji, R\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Bactrian camel includes various domestic (Camelus bactrianus) and wild (Camelus ferus) breeds that are important for transportation and for their nutritional value. However, there is a lack of extensive information on their genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure. Here, we studied these parameters by examining an 809-bp mtDNA fragment from 113 individuals, representing 11 domestic breeds, one wild breed and two hybrid individuals. We found 15 different haplotypes, and the phylogenetic analysis suggests that domestic and wild Bactrian camels have two distinct lineages. The analysis of molecular variance placed most of the genetic variance (90.14%, PÂ <Â 0.01) between wild and domestic camel lineages, suggesting that domestic and wild Bactrian camel do not have the same maternal origin. The analysis of domestic Bactrian camels from different geographical locations found there was no significant genetic divergence in China, Russia and Mongolia. This suggests a strong gene flow due to wide movement of domestic Bactrian camels. Â© 2016 The Authors.

Some camel parasites also represent a threat to human health. About 171,500 one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) and 100-300 two-humped camels (Camelus bactrianus) live in Iran. Knowledge of the biodiversity of their parasites is still limited. The present review covers all information about camel parasitic diseases in Iran published as dissertations and in both Iranian and international journals from 1931 to February 2017. Ten genera of Protozoa (Trypanosoma, Eimeria, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, Neospora, Sarcocystis, Besnoitia, Theileria, Babesia and Balantidium), 48 helminth species detected in the digestive system, including three species of Trematoda, four species of Cestoda, and 41 species of Nematoda, as well as helminths from other organs - Echinococcus spp., Dictyocaulus filaria, Thelazia leesei, Dipetalonema evansi and Onchocerca fasciata - have so far been described in Iranian camels. Furthermore, 13 species of hard ticks, mange mites, the myiasis flies Cephalopina titillator and Wohlfahrtia magnifica, and immature stages of the Pentastomida Linguatula serrata have also been reported from camels of Iran. Camel parasitic diseases are a major issue in Iran in terms of economics and public health.

Both Bactrian camels and horses have been invaluable for the survival and development of human activities in the harsh arid environment of the Mongolian steppe. As camels offer unique and sustainable opportunities for livestock production in marginal agro-ecological zones, we investigated the current genetic diversity of three local Mongolian camel breeds and compared their levels of variation with common native Mongolian camels distributed throughout the country. Based on mitochondrial and nuclear markers, we found levels of genetic diversity in Mongolian populations similar to that reported for Chinese Bactrian camels and for dromedaries. Little differentiation was detected between single breeds, except for a small group originating from the northwestern Mongolian Altai. We found neither high inbreeding levels in the different breeds nor evidence for a population decline. Although the Mongolian camel census size has severely declined over the past 20 years, our analyses suggest that there still exists a stable population with adequate genetic variation for continued sustainable utilization.

An initial biopsy of the vulvar mass of one of the camels performed by a local veterinarian showed eosinophilic dermatitis. An allergic or parasitic dermatitis was suspected. The two camels were treated with one dose of sodium iodide (66 mg/kg, in 1.0 L of normosolR, IV) and ivermectin 1% (200 ug/kg PO). Upon presentation at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Tennessee, additional biopsies of the masses again revealed eosinophilic dermatitis. Microscopic examination of a Gomori methenamine silver (GMS)-stained section prepared from the biopsy of one of the camels revealed the presence of fungal-like hyphae of a mold which was suspected to be Pythium insidiosum. The vulvar masses were surgically debulked in both animals and sodium iodide and Pythium-immunotherapy prescribed. Pythium insidiosum was isolated in culture and hyphae elements were detected in histological sections confirming the diagnosis of pythiosis in both animals. Despite signs of progressive healing of the vulvar surgical areas, postoperative persistent weight lost in one of the camels suggested the possibility of gastro intestinal (GI) tract pythiosis. This camel died 5 months after the first onset of clinical signs and unfortunately a necropsy was not performed. The other camel responded well to the combination of surgery, iodides, and immunotherapy and has currently rejoined the other members of the herd.\n\nUltrasonography of the liver and kidneys of healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nTharwat, Mohamed; Al-Sobayil, Fahd; Ali, Ahmed; Buczinski, SÃ©bastien\n\n2012-12-01\n\nThis study describes the ultrasonography of the liver and kidneys of healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius). Images of the liver were obtained from the 11th to 5th intercostal spaces (ICSs). The distance between the dorsal liver margin and the midline of the back was shortest (39.1 Â± 7.4 cm) at the 11th ICS and increased cranially to 5th ICS. The size of the liver was largest at the 9th ICS and smallest at the 5th ICS. In 6 camels the right kidney was visualized from the 10th and 11th ICSs and upper right flank and in the 10th and 11th ICSs in the remaining 16 camels. In all camels, the left kidney was imaged from the caudal left flank. In 21 camels, the differentiation between the renal cortex and medulla was clearly visible in the ultrasonograms.

For each camel, the IOP of both eyes was measured with applanation tonometry. Three measurements with < 5% variance were obtained for each eye on the same day of the week for 3 consecutive weeks. Mean IOP was calculated for each eye on each day for comparison purposes. Mean Â± SD IOPs for the right (31.1 Â± 2.1 mm Hg) and left (30.8 Â± 1.9 mm Hg) eyes of immature camels were significantly higher than those for the right (27.1 Â± 1.2 mm Hg) and left (28.2 Â± 1.2 mm Hg) eyes of mature camels. Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) for IOP measurements of the right and left eyes did not differ significantly between immature and mature camels. Interassay CVs of IOP measurements for the right and left eyes ranged from 1.5% to 12.1% and 1.2% to 10.3%, respectively, for immature camels and from 1.2% to 17.2% and 1.7% to 18.8%, respectively, for mature camels. Intra-assay CVs of IOP measurements for the right and left eyes ranged from 1.5% to 10.6% and 1.9% to 9.6%, respectively, for immature camels and from 2.8% to 16.9% and 2.7% to 12.4%, respectively, for mature camels. Age was negatively correlated (r = -0.403) with IOP. Results provided a reference and might aid in the diagnosis of glaucoma and uveitis during complete ophthalmic examinations of dromedary camels.\n\nUltrasonography of the liver and kidneys of healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTharwat, Mohamed; Al-Sobayil, Fahd; Ali, Ahmed; Buczinski, SÃ©bastien\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study describes the ultrasonography of the liver and kidneys of healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius).

Seventy camels with confirmed Johne's disease were examined by ultrasonography and subsequent necropsy; 15 healthy camels were included as controls. The most outstanding findings were visible enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes in 52 (74%) camels. Lesions had either echogenic (26%; n = 18) or anechoic (69%; n = 48) capsule and the contents were either anechoic (21%; n = 15), echogenic (27%; n = 19), or heterogeneous (46%; n = 32). Clumps of echogenic tissue interspersed with fluid pockets were imaged between the intestinal loops in 9 (13%) camels. There was mild, moderate, or severe thickening and corrugation of the intestinal wall, excessive anechoic fluid in the abdominal cavity in 18 (26%) camels, increased hepatic brightness in 30 (43%) camels, and pericardial and pleural effusions in 22 (31%) camels.

The conditions included trypanosomiasis (n=35), intestinal obstruction (n=12) and ruptured urinary bladder (n=5). Fifteen clinically normal camels were included as controls. Transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonography was carried out on all camels. In animals with trypanosomiasis, ultrasonographic findings included accumulation of massive amounts of hypoechoic abdominal fluids where liver, intestine, kidney, spleen and urinary bladder were imaged floating. Except in two cases of bile duct calcification and one of hepatic abscessation, no detectable abnormal sonographic lesions were detected while imaging the hepatic and renal parenchyma, and the heart and its valves and major blood vessels. In camels with intestinal obstruction, ultrasonographic findings included distended intestinal loops with markedly reduced or absent motility. In one camel, the intestinal lumen contained localised hyperechoic material that was consistent with a foreign body. Hypoechoic fluid with or without fibrin was seen between intestinal loops. In camels with ruptured urinary bladder, ultrasonographic findings included collapsed and perforated bladder, echogenic blood clots within the urinary bladder and peritoneal cavity, increased thickness of the bladder wall, floating intestines in hypoechogenic fluid and echogenic calculi within the urethra. Ultrasonography was considered a useful tool for the evaluation of dromedary camels with abdominal distension. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As parasitic diseases are the major cause of impaired meat and milk production in this animal, the present study aimed at determining gastrointestinal helminthic infections of Iranian camels in the center of the country. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract of 144 carcasses of one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtered in Yazd, Esfahan and Kerman provinces' abattoirs were examined for adult helminths. Camels were from both sexes and different ages. Recovered parasites were identified according to described keys by light microscope. Of 144 tested camels, 117 were infected with at least one helminth species (81.3%). A total of 28 worm species from 14 genera were identified in the digestive tract of infected animals, including 26 species of nematodes and two species of cestodes. The infection rates in stomach, small intestine, and caecum/large intestine were 86.3%, 91.5% and 11.1%, respectively. However, no worm was found in the oesophagus. The recovered worms with infection rates are discussed in this paper. In the present study, Haemonchus tataricus, Trichostrongylus hamatus and Trichuris infundibulus are reported from Iranian dromedaries for the first time. Regarding high prevalence of infection, using anthelminthic drugs seemed necessary to improve the health and productivity of camels. On the other hand, the high rate of zoonotic species indicated that camels have important role in maintaining and transmitting infection to humans.\n\nClinical, ultrasonographic, and pathologic findings in 70 camels (Camelus dromedarius) with Johneâs disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTharwat, Mohamed; Al-Sobayil, Fahd; Ali, Ahmed; Hashad, Mahmoud; Buczinski, SÃ©bastien\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study evaluated the use of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of Johneâs disease in camels (Camelus dromedarius).

During domestication, strong artificial (anthropogenic) selection has shaped the livestock, creating a huge amount of phenotypes and breeds. Hence, domestic animals represent a unique resource to understand the genetic basis of phenotypic variation and adaptation. Similar to its late domestication history, the Bactrian camel is also among the last livestock animals to have its genome sequenced and deciphered. As no genomic data have been available until recently, we generated a de novo assembly by shotgun sequencing of a single male Bactrian camel. We obtained 1.6 Gb genomic sequences, which correspond to more than half of the Bactrian camelâs genome. The aim of this study was to identify heterozygous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and to estimate population parameters and nucleotide diversity based on an individual camel. With an average 6.6-fold coverage, we detected over 116 000 heterozygous SNPs and recorded a genome-wide nucleotide diversity similar to that of other domesticated ungulates. More than 20 000 (85%) dromedary expressed sequence tags successfully aligned to our genomic draft. Our results provide a template for future association studies targeting economically relevant traits and to identify changes underlying the process of camel domestication and environmental adaptation.

We sequenced 24 camel mitogenomes and combined them with three previously published sequences to study the role of natural selection under different environmental pressure, and to advance our understanding of the evolutionary history of the genus Camelus. We confirmed the heterogeneity of divergence across different components of the electron transport system. Lineage-specific analysis of mitochondrial protein evolution revealed a significant effect of purifying selection in the concatenated protein-coding genes in domestic Bactrian camels. The estimated dN/dSâ<â1 in the concatenated protein-coding genes suggested purifying selection as driving force for shaping mitogenome diversity in camels. Additional analyses of the functional divergence in amino acid changes between species-specific lineages indicated fixed substitutions in various genes, with radical effects on the physicochemical properties of the protein products. The evolutionary time estimates revealed a divergence between domestic and wild Bactrian camels around 1.1 [0.58-1.8] million years ago (mya). This has major implications for the conservation and management of the critically endangered wild species, Camelus ferus.\n\nUltrasonography of the lungs and pleura in healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nTharwat, Mohamed\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThis study describes ultrasonography of the lungs and pleura in healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius). The different layers of the thoracic wall appeared as narrow bands of variable echogenicity. Reverberation artefacts appeared as lines of variable echogenicity that ran parallel to the pulmonary surface medial to the pleura. Because of its air content, the pulmonary parenchyma was not visualised in all camels. On the right side, the pulmonary surface was seen in the 5th through the 10th intercostal space (ICS). In addition, it was imaged in the 11th ICS in 20 camels and in the 4th ICS in three camels. The dimension of the ventral lung border was largest at the 4th ICS and smallest at the 11th ICS. The echogenic line on the surface of the lung, consisting of the costal and the parietal pleurae, was 1 to 4 mm thick. The left pulmonary surface and pleura were imaged with approximately the same frequencies as the right side. At this side, only the pulmonary surface and pleura were imaged in 15 camels in the 11th ICS. In conclusion, ultrasonography of the lungs and pleura provides information that can be used as a reference when examining camels suspected to have respiratory diseases.\n\nSerosurvey of Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) in Dromedary Camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Laikipia County, Kenya.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrowne, A S; FÃ¨vre, E M; Kinnaird, M; Muloi, D M; Wang, C A; Larsen, P S; O'Brien, T; Deem, S L\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are an important protein source for people in semi-arid and arid regions of Africa. In Kenya, camel populations have grown dramatically in the past few decades resulting in the potential for increased disease transmission between humans and camels. An estimated four million Kenyans drink unpasteurized camel milk, which poses a disease risk. We evaluated the seroprevalence of a significant zoonotic pathogen, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), among 334 camels from nine herds in Laikipia County, Kenya. Serum testing revealed 18.6% positive seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii (nÂ =Â 344). Increasing camel age was positively associated with C.Â burnetii seroprevalence (ORÂ =Â 5.36). Our study confirmed that camels living in Laikipia County, Kenya, have been exposed to the zoonotic pathogen, C.Â burnetii. Further research to evaluate the role of camels in disease transmission to other livestock, wildlife and humans in Kenya should be conducted. Â© 2017 The Authors.

The concentrations of the vitamin in the plasma of eight camels of both sexes afflicted with aflatoxicosis were also determined. The mean concentration (+/-SD) of the vitamin in healthy camels was 460.1 +/- 49.3 ng/L. Sex had no significant effect on the concentration of the vitamin. Camels with aflatoxicosis had a mean concentration of retinol in the plasma of 243.4 +/- 32.3 ng/L. The concentrations of aflatoxins in the liver and ruminal contents of these animals were 18.2 +/- 1.3 and 243.4 microg/kg, respectively.\n\n\"Candidatus anaplasma camelii\" in one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Morocco: a novel and emerging anaplasma species?\n\nPubMed\n\nAit Lbacha, Hicham; Zouagui, Zaid; Alali, Said; Rhalem, Abdelkbir; Petit, Elisabeth; Ducrotoy, Marie Julie; Boulouis, Henri-Jean; Maillard, Renaud\n\n2017-02-05\n\nThere has been a growing interest in camel anaplasmosis due to its recent emergence in this reservoir species and concerns for its zoonotic potential. The epidemiology of anaplasmosis in camels therefore remains poorly understood mostly because camels belong to marginalised poor and often transhumant populations whose interests are largely neglected. Most studies of anaplasmosis in camels have relied on microscopy and serology for diagnosis and only three studies, undertaken in Tunisia, Saudia Arabia and China, have used molecular diagnostics. The present work characterises Anaplasmataceae strains circulating in the Camelus dromedarius reservoir in Morocco using PCR. Camels (nâ=â106) were randomly sampled from 6 regions representing different agro-ecological areas in southern Morocco. Whole blood was collected and screened using PCR methods targeting the gene groEL. Anaplasmataceae strains were characterised by sequence analysis of the gene groEL. A total of 39.62% (42/106) camels screened were positive for Anaplasmataceae spp. GenBank BLAST analysis of five positive sequenced samples revealed that all strains were 100% identical to \"Candidatus Anaplasma camelii\". Phylogenetic investigation and genetic characterisation of the aligned segment (650Â bp) of the gene groEL confirmed high similarity with A. platys. This study demonstrates the circulation of a previously unidentified species of the genus Anaplasma in Morocco which is genetically close to the agent causing canine anaplasmosis but whose main reservoir is thought to be Camelus dromedarius. This study is not a clinical trial and therefore a trial registration number does not apply.\n\nMycoplasma detection and isolation from one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nMederos-Iriarte, Lidia E; Poveda, JosÃ© B; Poveda, Carlos G; Vega-Orellana, Orestes M; GutiÃ©rrez, Carlos; Corbera, Juan A; RamÃ­rez, Ana S\n\n2014-10-01\n\nIn scientific literature, a small amount of information is found concerning mycoplasmosis in camel species. Mycoplasma (M.) arginini, Acholeplasma (A.) laidlawii, and Acholeplasma oculi have been reported to be isolated from these host species. Serologically positive results have been reported for Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC type, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, and M. mycoides subsp. capri. The aims of this study were to detect, isolate, and identify mycoplasmas from camels (Camelus dromedarius). Initially, saliva and ear smears plus conjunctival and vaginal secretions were taken from five female animals, but only conjunctival secretions in three male animals, all belonging to the same farm. An unknown mycoplasma was isolated from one of the vagina samples. Additionally, another unknown and uncultured mycoplasma was detected with molecular biology in the same sample. In the second stage, 23 vaginal secretions were taken from the same farm plus another secretion from a different one. Ten isolates of the same unknown and previously isolated mycoplasma were detected, nine of them recovered from the vagina of female camels. Some mycoplasmas have been related to reproductive disorders; however, there is no evidence that the isolated mycoplasmas are related to such disorders.\n\nPrevalence and pathology of dermatophilosis in camels (Camelus dromedaries) in Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nKhodakaram-Tafti, Azizollah; Khordadmehr, Monireh; Ardiyan, Mahmoud\n\n2012-01-01\n\nGross and histopathologic lesions of the integumentary system were studied in 103 camels (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtered in Yazd Province of Iran. Dermatophilosis was diagnosed in 14 (13.6%) of the studied camels. Grossly, patchy thickening of the skin with dark brown scabs or crusts were observed on the rump, flanks, abdomen, shoulders, and neck. A heavy infestation with brown hard ticks was present on the lesions in almost all of the affected camels. On parasitology examination, all the ticks were identified as Hyalomma spp. Histopathologic examination of the affected skins revealed prominent superficial thickening of the epidermis as orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, degenerating neutrophils, serous fluid, and bacterial filaments. A lot of keratinaceous debris associated with an exudate rich in neutrophils were seen as remarkable features of the lesions on the superficial epidermis. Dermal inflammation was mild with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells, particularly lymphocytes, around superficial vessels. A Gram-positive filamentous organism which was divided into parallel rows of cocci was observed in the crusts by Brown and Brenn Gram stain. This is the first report of the occurrence of dermatophilosis in the camels of Iran. With regard to infestation of the lesions by Hyalomma spp., it seems that this tick may have an important role in the pathogenesis of dermatophilosis in the camels of this region.\n\nACUTE CLINICAL LEPTOSPIROSIS (GRIPPOTYPHOSA SEROVAR) IN AN ADULT DROMEDARY CAMEL (CAMELUS DROMEDARIUS).\n\nPubMed\n\nGyimesi, Zoltan S; Burns, Roy B; Erol, Erdal; Bolin, Steven R\n\n2015-09-01\n\nA 9-yr-old castrated male dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) presented with lethargy and partial anorexia. A diagnostic examination revealed fever, and further workup revealed a neutrophilia, hyperfibrinogenemia, renal azotemia, and a rapid onset of a high Leptospira antibody titer during the acute clinical period (Grippotyphosa serovar). The camel responded clinically to antimicrobial treatment with ceftiofur crystalline free acid injections, but renal azotemia persisted, presumably secondary to chronic renal damage. Subsequent Leptospira polymerase chain reaction testing on urine samples obtained over the following 4 mo revealed no evidence of urinary shedding, so a persistent infection was unlikely. Although often mentioned as a potential cause of reproductive loss, well-documented case reports of clinical leptospirosis in camelids are very rare. In this case, native wildlife contamination of a small watering hole is suspected to have been the source of infection. In response to this experience, the camel and two conspecifics were prescribed a vaccination regimen using an inactivated pentavalent Leptospira vaccine licensed for cattle.\n\nProduction of a novel camel single-domain antibody specific for the type III mutant EGFR.\n\nPubMed\n\nOmidfar, K; Rasaee, M J; Modjtahedi, H; Forouzandeh, M; Taghikhani, M; Golmakani, N\n\n2004-01-01\n\nCamelids have a unique immune system capable of producing single-domain heavy-chain antibodies. The antigen-specific domain of these heavy-chain IgGs (VHH) are the smallest binding units produced by the immune system. In this study, we report the isolation and characterization of several binders against the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) vIII retrieved from immune library of camels (Camelus bactrianus and Camelus dromedarius). The EGFRvIII is a ligand-independent, constitutively active, mutated form of the wild-type EGFR. The expression of EGFRvIII has been demonstrated in a wide range of human malignancies, including gliomas, and breast, prostate, ovarian and lung cancer. Camels were immunized with a synthetic peptide corresponding to a mutated sequence and tissue homogenates. Single-domain antibodies (VHH) were directly selected by panning a phage display library on successively decreasing amounts of synthetic peptide immobilized on magnetic beads. The anti-EGFRvIII camel single-domain antibodies selectively bound to the EGFRvIII peptide and reacted specifically with the immunoaffinity-purified antigen from a non-small cell lung cancer patient. These antibodies with affinities in the nanomolar range recognized the EGFRvIII peptide and affinity-purified mutated receptor. We concluded that using the phage display technique, antigen-specific VHH antibody fragments are readily accessible from the camelids. These antibodies may be good candidates for tumor-diagnostic and therapeutic applications. Copyright 2004 S.

Our findings testified that the gland was divided into three parts, capsule, cortex and medulla from outside to inside as other mammals, and the cortex itself was further distinguished into four zones: zona glomerulosa, zona intermedia, zona fasciculate and zona reticularis. Notably, the zona intermedia could be seen clearly in the glands from females and castrated males, whereas it was not morphologically clear in male. There was a great deal of lipid droplets in the zona fasciculate, while it was fewer in the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis. The cytoplasm of adrenocortical cell contained rich mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. The adrenal medulla was well-developed with two separations of external and internal zones. The most obvious histological property of adrenal medulla cells were that they contained a huge number of electron-dense granules enveloped by the membrane, and so medulla cells could be divided into norepinephrine cells and epinephrine cells. Moreover, the cortical cuffs were frequently present in adrenal gland. Results of this study provides a theoretical basis necessary for ongoing investigations on Bactrian camels and their good adaptability in arid and semi-arid circumstances.

Samples were taken from the diaphragm, heart, tongue, esophagus and masseter muscles for histopathological studies. No macroscopic sarcocysts were found in the samples at gross inspection. Sarcocysts were detected in 209 of 250 (83.6%) examined camels at histopathological level. The infection rate of the esophagus, heart, masseter muscles, diaphragm, and tongue was 58.8%, 48.0%, 46.8%, 41.6%, and 28.0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate of infection between male (85.8%) and female (81.0%) camels. The tissue response to vital cysts was minimal; however, reaction to the degenerating cysts was severe and caused tissue damages resulting in hyperemia, hemorrhages, mononuclear cell infiltration, necrotic changes, and fibrosis. The wild and domestic carnivores especially dogs may be the final hosts of Sarcocystis spp. in this area. PMID:19127328\n\nIdentification and phylogenetic analysis of contagious ecthyma virus from camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nOryan, Ahmad; Mosadeghhesari, Mahboobe; Zibaee, Saeed; Mohammadi, Ali\n\n2017-03-24\n\nContagious ecthyma is a highly contagious disease affecting domestic and wild ruminants such as sheep, goats and camels. The identification and characterisation of a parapoxvirus (PPV) infecting camels is described here. The virus was detected in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Kerman and Shiraz in Iran. PPV-specific amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) further confirmed that the disease was associated with PPV infection. Phylogenetic analysis of ORF011 (B2L) gene sequences showed 99.79% and 82.13% similarity of the PPV identified in this study with the Jodhpur isolate and the bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) isolates (CE41), respectively. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the ORF045 gene indicated that the Shiraz sample was in all probability closely related to VR634 and to F00.120R and PCPV776. In conclusion, the results suggest that camel PPV (CPPV) is a likely cause of contagious ecthyma in dromedary camels in Iran.\n\nFirst Report on Circulation of Echinococcus ortleppi in the one Humped Camel (Camelus dromedaries), Sudan\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2013-01-01\n\nBackground Echinococcus granulosus (EG) complex, the cause of cystic echinococcosis (CE), infects humans and several other animal species worldwide and hence the disease is of public health importance. Ten genetic variants, or genotypes designated as (G1-G10), are distributed worldwide based on genetic diversity. The objective of this study was to provide some sequence data and phylogeny of EG isolates recovered from the Sudanese one-humped camel (Camelus dromedaries). Fifty samples of hydatid cysts were collected from the one- humped camels (Camelus dromedaries) at Taboul slaughter house, central Sudan. DNAs were extracted from protoscolices and/or associated germinal layers of hydatid cysts using a commercial kit. The mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NADH1) gene and the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene were used as targets for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were purified and partial sequences were generated. Sequences were further examined by sequence analysis and subsequent phylogeny to compare these sequences to those from known strains of EG circulating globally. Results The identity of the PCR products were confirmed as NADH1 and cox1 nucleotide sequences using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). The phylogenetic analysis showed that 98% (n = 49) of the isolates clustered with Echinococcus canadensis genotype 6 (G6), whereas only one isolate (2%) clustered with Echinococcus ortleppi (G5). Conclusions This investigation expands on the existing sequence data generated from EG isolates recovered from camel in the Sudan. The circulation of the cattle genotype (G5) in the one-humped camel is reported here for the first time.

In camels renal disorders have received lesser attention in comparison with other animals, thus there is shortage of information in this area. The present study was conducted on 100 slaughtered camels (Camelus dromedaris) (200 kidneys) in Najaf-Abad district (Iran) to evaluate the frequency and types of renal disorders. Results demonstrated varieties of gross abnormalities in 14.00% of kidneys that out of them, 9.00% were confirmed by microscopic examination. Renal capsular pigmentation, medullary hyperemia, subcapsular calcification, cortical and medullar discoloration, hemorrhage in renal pelvis, nephrolithiasis and hydatidosis were recorded in 3, 6, 5, 6, 3, 2 and 3 cases, respectively. In addition, capsular melanosis, acute tubular necrosis, chronic interstitial nephritis, caseous necrosis, calcification, medullary hyperemia, and hydatid cyst were confirmed by histopathological examination in 3, 5, 1, 3, 2, 2, and 2 cases, respectively. Our findings indicate the presence of many types of renal disorders which may relate to dehydration, bacteremia or nephrotoxicosis. In addition capsular melanosis in male camel was recorded for the first time and its etiology remains to be addressed.\n\nA comparative study of ketone body metabolism between the camel (Camelus dromedarius) and the sheep (Ovis aries).\n\nPubMed\n\nChandrasena, L G; Emmanuel, B; Hamar, D W; Howard, B R\n\n1979-01-01\n\n1. Plasma levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and acetoacetate (AcAc) have been measured in camels (Camelus dromedarius) and sheep (Ovis aries). The activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BHB-deH2) (E.C. 1.1.1.30) was studied in the rumen epithelium and the liver of these animals. 2. Concentrations of plasma BHB and AcAc in the camel were in respective order 33 and 4 times lower than that of the sheep. The ratios of BHB to AcAc were 0.61 and 4.8 for the camel and sheep, respectively. 3. The activity of BHB-deH2 in the rumen epithelium of the camel and sheep were 7.15 and 66 mumol/hr/g wet wt tissue, respectively. The activity in both species was higher in the rumen epithelium than in the liver.\n\nSerological, molecular detection and potential risk factors associated with camel brucellosis in Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nFatima, Sana; Khan, Iahtasham; Nasir, Amar; Younus, Muhammad; Saqib, Muhammad; Melzer, Falk; Neubauer, Heinrich; El-Adawy, Hosny\n\n2016-12-01\n\nBrucellosis is one of the most important zoonoses in developing countries and was considered the most widespread zoonosis in the world. Brucellosis was reported in camels and has been reported from all camel-keeping countries.The present study was performed in three districts (Jhang, Chiniot, and Bhakkar) of Punjab province of Pakistan. A total of 200 camel (Camelus bactrianus) sera were collected using random and multistage cluster sampling from different areas. Fifty samples were collected from one organized governmental farm. One hundred fifty samples were collected randomly from nomadic/pastoral production systems. All sera were tested with Rose Bengal plate agglutination test (RBPT) and confirmed by ELISA. Genomic DNA was extracted from all serum samples and tested by real-time PCR. Various potential risk factors (season, rearing with other animals, and abortion or orchitis history) recorded through questionnaires were statistically analyzed by Chi-square test.In total, 5Â % of investigated sera were positive by RBPT. Only 2Â % of the camel sera were CELISA positive. Brucella abortus DNA was detected in 1.5Â % of the investigated animals. Season, rearing of camels with other ruminants, abortion, and orchitis history were found to be statistically significant (pâ<â0.05) disease for determinants.Camel brucellosis is a zoonotic disease in the Pakistani Punjab with various risk factors maintaining and perpetuating its spread. Therefore, there is a need for implementing control measures and raising public health awareness in prevention of brucellosis in Pakistan.\n\nAn outbreak of dermatophilosis and caseous lymphadenitis mixed infection in camels (Camelus dromedaries) in Jordan.\n\nPubMed\n\nTarazi, Yaser Hamadeh; Al-Ani, Falah Khalil\n\n2016-05-31\n\nThis study describes and reports, for the first time, an outbreak of dermatophilosis that occurred concurrently with caseous lymphadenitis involving two camel herds (Camelus dromedaries) in north Jordan. The affected animals were part of two herds comprising 52 Arabian camels in herd 1 and 65 camels in herd 2. The age of infected camels ranged from 18 months to 5 years. Pus and skin scab samples were aseptically collected and bacteriologically examined. Affected camels were treated by long-acting oxytetracycline injection in a dose rate of 10 mg/kg body weight every 48 hours for three successive treatments, and local antiseptic and antibiotic cutaneous spray treatment for five successive days. The main clinical signs on affected camels were skin dermatitis and abscess formation. The isolated organisms were Dermatophilus congolensis and Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis were the causative agents of dermatophilosis and caseous lymphadenitis, respectively. Other organisms were isolated from skin abscesses, including Î±-hemolytic streptococci, hemolytic E. coli, Actinomyces pyogenes, and S. aureus. The affected camels were rapidly and effectively cured by the above-mentioned treatment protocol. No mortality was recorded. Introducing purchased camels from animal auctions without pre-examination and keeping camels in over-crowded small barns under cold, humid, and rainy conditions during winter may predispose the eruption of mixed infection of dermatophilosis and caseous lymphadenitis. Treatment by long-acting oxytetracycline injection with local antiseptic and antibiotic cutaneous spray can control such infection. A survey on camel herds raised near Jordan's borders is needed to monitor the possibility of emerging infectious disease.\n\nAge-related changes in the anatomical characteristics of Peyer's patches in small intestine of Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus).\n\nPubMed\n\nQi, Shan-Shan; Wang, Wen-Hui; Gao, Qiang; Xu, Xiao-Hong; He, Wan-Hong; Zhaxi, Ying-Pai; Tai, Li-Feng\n\n2011-08-01\n\nThe distribution, size, and appearance of Peyer's patches vary according to species. In order to determine the anatomical characteristics of Peyer's patches in small intestine of Bactrian camel, and age-related changes in the number of Peyer's patches, 40 Bactrian camels of the following four age groups were studied: young (0.5-2 years), pubertal (3-5 years), middle-aged (6-16 years), and old (17-20 years). The exact number of Peyer's patches was recorded, and the appearance of Peyer's patches was described in detail. The results indicated that Peyer's patches of Bactrian camels not only have a particular anatomical location and distinct appearance but also change with age. They were distributed in the whole small intestine and there were four distinct types of Peyer's patches: nodular, faviform, cup-shaped, and cystic form Peyer's patches. However, the nodular and cystic form Peyer's patches are specific to Bactrian camel, which have not been found in other animals including Dromedary camel. In addition, the distribution density of Peyer's patches in ileum was the maximum, then was jejunum and duodenum. Further statistical analysis showed that the number of Peyer's patches was altered with age. The number peaked in 5-year-old camels and declined subsequently with age. However, there was little change in the size of Peyer's patches in different age groups; no age-related macroscopic variations in the shape or size of the Peyer's patches were found. Results obtained from this study provide the basic information to further study on the gastrointestinal mucosal immunity of Bactrian camel.\n\nProduction of novel recombinant single-domain antibodies against tandem repeat region of MUC1 mucin.\n\nPubMed\n\nRahbarizadeh, F; Rasaee, M J; Forouzandeh Moghadam, M; Allameh, A A; Sadroddiny, E\n\n2004-06-01\n\nRecently, the existence of \"heavy-chain\" antibody in Camelidae has been described. However, as yet there is no data on the binding of this type of antibody to peptides. In addition, there was not any report of production of single-domain antibodies in two-humped camels (Camelus bactrianus). In the present study, these questions are addressed. We showed the feasibility of immunizing old world camels, cloning the repertoire of the variable domain of their heavy-chain antibodies, panning and selection, leading to the successful identification of minimum-sized antigen binders. Antigen-specific fragments of the heavy-chain IgGs (V(HH)) are of great interest in biotechnology because they are very stable, highly soluble, and react specifically and with high affinity to the antigens. In this study, we immunized two camels (Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus) with homogenized cancerous tissues, synthetic peptide, and human milk fat globule membrane (HMFG), and generated two V(HH) libraries displayed on phage particles. Some single-domain antibody fragments have been isolated that specifically recognize the tandem repeat region of MUC1. The camels' single-domain V(HH) harbor the original, intact antigen binding site and reacted specifically and with high affinity to the tandem repeat region of MUC1. Indeed soluble, specific antigen binders and good affinities (in the range of 0.2 x 10(9) M(-1) to 0.6 x 10(9) M(-1)) were identified from these libraries. This is the first example of the isolation of camel anti-peptide V(HH) domains.\n\nEchocardiography of the normal camel (Camelus dromedaries) heart: technique and cardiac dimensions\n\nPubMed Central\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBackground Echocardiography and intra-cardiac dimensions have not previously been reported in adult camels despite its potential application for medical purpose. The aim of this study was to describe the results of a prospective study, aiming to report normal cardiac appearance and normal chamber dimensions in adult camels (Camelus dromedarius). Results On the right side, when the probe was placed in the 5th or 4th intercostal space (ICS), the caudal long-axis four-chamber view of the ventricles, atria, and the interventricular septum was obtained. Placing the probe slightly more cranially in the 4th ICS, the caudal long-axis four-chamber view and the caudal long-axis view of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) were imaged. In 7 camels, a hybrid view between a âfour-chamberâ and âLVOT viewâ was imaged from the same position. The short-axis view of the ventricles was obtained in the 4th ICS where the transducer was rotated between 0Â° and 25Â°. Placement of the transducer in the 3rd ICS allowed visualisation of the right ventricular outflow tract (RVOT). On the left side, when the probe was placed in the 5th or 4th ICS, a four-chamber view was obtained. The LVOT is imaged in the 4th ICS and the RVOT was seen from the 3rd ICS. Conclusions This study showed that it is possible to obtain good-quality echocardiograms in adult camels and provide normal cardiac dimensions. This study could be used as a reference for further studies concerning camels with cardiac diseases.

We sequenced a genomic cluster containing three hsp70 family genes linked with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region from an extremely heat tolerant animal, camel (Camelus dromedarius). Two hsp70 family genes comprising the cluster contain heat shock elements (HSEs), while the third gene lacks HSEs and should not be induced by heat shock. Comparison of the camel hsp70 cluster with the corresponding regions from several mammalian species revealed similar organization of genes forming the cluster. Specifically, the two heat inducible hsp70 genes are arranged in tandem, while the third constitutively expressed hsp70 family member is present in inverted orientation. Comparison of regulatory regions of hsp70 genes from camel and other mammals demonstrates that transcription factor matches with highest significance are located in the highly conserved 250-bp upstream region and correspond to HSEs followed by NF-Y and Sp1 binding sites. The high degree of sequence conservation leaves little room for putative camel-specific regulatory elements. Surprisingly, RT-PCR and 5â²/3â²-RACE analysis demonstrated that all three hsp70 genes are expressed in camel's muscle and blood cells not only after heat shock, but under normal physiological conditions as well, and may account for tolerance of camel cells to extreme environmental conditions. A high degree of evolutionary conservation observed for the hsp70 cluster always linked with MHC locus in mammals suggests an important role of such organization for coordinated functioning of these vital genes. PMID:22096537\n\nThe pleural curtain of the camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nBuzzell, Gerald R; Kinne, Joerg; Tariq, Saeed; Wernery, Ulrich\n\n2010-10-01\n\nThe visceral pleura of the camel (Camelus dromedarius) possesses a fibrous curtain of pleural threads or extensions along its basal margins, which extends into the pleural cavity of the costophrenic recesses. These threads are lined by mesothelium and have a core or stroma, which is largely collagenous. Small threads are avascular and nearly acellular. In larger proximal threads, blood vessels in the stroma are often arranged in a branching network, with irregular endothelia surrounded by several incomplete basal laminae. Lymphocytes and other inflammatory cell types aggregate in the stroma near blood vessels. The threads are lined by typical mesothelium except in patches close to the main pleural surface. These patches consist of layers of loosely applied cells with numerous cellular processes and features suggestive of phagocytosis. The position of the pleural curtain in the costophrenic recess and the presence of possibly phagocytotic cells suggest that the pleural curtain stirs, samples, and cleans the pleural fluid. The pleural curtain appears to be a feature of camelids and has also been seen in giraffes.

First, IgG was successfully isolated from their serum and rabbit antibody against Bactrian camels IgG was prepared. The IgG antibody secretory cells (ASCs) in small intestine were particularly observed through immumohistochemical staining, then after were analyzed by statistical methods. The results showed that the IgG ASCs were scattered in the lamina propria (LP) and some of them aggregated around of the intestinal glands. The IgG ASCs density was the highest from middle segment of duodenum to middle segment of jejunum, and then in ended segment of jejunum and initial segment of ileum, the lowest was in initial segment of duodenum, in middle and ended segment of ileum. It was demonstrated that the IgG ASCs mainly scattered in the effector sites of the mucosal immunity, though the density of IgG ASCs was different in different segment of small intestine. Moreover, this scatted distribution characteristic would provide a morphology basis for research whether IgG form a full-protection and immune surveillance in mucosal immunity homeostasis of integral intestine.\n\nMolecular study on Pasteurella multocida and Mannheimia granulomatis from Kenyan Camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nGluecks, Ilona V; Bethe, Astrid; Younan, Mario; Ewers, Christa\n\n2017-08-22\n\nOutbreaks of a Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS) like disease causing large mortalities in camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Asia and in Africa have been reported since 1890. Yet the aetiology of this condition remains elusive. This study is the first to apply state of the art molecular methods to shed light on the nasopharyngeal carrier state of Pasteurellaceae in camels. The study focused on HS causing Pasteurella multocida capsular types B and E. Other Pasteurellaceae, implicated in common respiratory infections of animals, were also investigated. In 2007 and 2008, 388 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 12 locations in North Kenya from 246 clinically healthy camels in 81 herds that had been affected by HS-like disease. Swabs were used to cultivate bacteria on blood agar and to extract DNA for subsequent PCR analysis targeting P. multocida and Mannheimia-specific gene sequences. Forty-five samples were positive for P. multocida genes kmt and psl and for the P. multocida Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS) specific sequences KTSP61/KTT72 but lacked HS-associated capsular type B and E genes capB and capE. This indicates circulation of HS strains in camels that lack established capsular types. Sequence analysis of the partial 16S rRNA gene identified 17 nasal swab isolates as 99% identical with Mannheimia granulomatis, demonstrating a hitherto unrecognised active carrier state for M. granulomatis or a closely related Mannheimia sp. in camels. The findings of this study provide evidence for the presence of acapsular P. multocida or of hitherto unknown capsular types of P. multocida in camels, closely related to P. multocida strains causing HS in bovines. Further isolations and molecular studies of camelid P. multocida from healthy carriers and from HS-like disease in camels are necessary to provide conclusive answers. This paper is the first report on the isolation of M. granulomatis or a closely related new Mannheimia species from camelids.\n\nEffect of dystocia on some hormonal and biochemical parameters in the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nGhoneim, I M; Waheed, M M; Al-Eknah, M M; Al-Raja'a, A\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThe present study compared some of the hormonal and biochemical constituents of serum from eutocic and dystocic one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius). Sera were harvested from eutocic (nÂ =Â 9) and dystocic (nÂ =Â 20) camels within the first 15Â minutes after delivery. Although there were no differences in the concentrations of estradiol-17Î² (E2) and prostaglandin F2Î± (PGF2Î±) between the eutocic and the dystocic animals, the level of progesterone (P4) and cortisol was significantly higher (PÂ <Â 0.01) in animals that experienced dystocia than those that had a normal birth. There were no differences between the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, cholesterol, creatine kinase, creatinine, or magnesium (Mg) in eutocic and dystocic animals. The nitric oxide concentration was significantly higher (PÂ <Â 0.01) in the serum from animals with dystocia than those that had normal births. By contrast, the serum concentrations of glucose, phosphorus (P), and triglycerides were significantly lower (PÂ <Â 0.01) in eutocic camels compared with dystocic camels. As the delayed decline of P4 is reported to be the major hormonal difference between eutocic and dystocic camels, we propose that the insensitivity of corpus luteum to luteolytic action may be a cause of dystocia. Moreover, stress and hormonal changes may affect the metabolic traits in dystocia camels. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

The results showed that Peyer's patches (PPs) were mainly located on the mucosal surfaces of the entire ileocecal orifice, the beginning of the cecum and the first third of the colon. The shape of PPs gradually changed from \"scrotiform\" to \"faviform\" along the large intestine with the scrotiform PP as the major type in the ileocecal orifice. The distribution density also gradually decreased from the ileocecal orifice to the colon. The histological observations further revealed that the MALT in the form of PPs or isolated lymphoid follicles (ILF) and lamina propria lymphocytes was mainly present in the lamina propria and submucosa from the entire ileocecal orifice, where the muscularis mucosa is usually incomplete, to the colonic forepart. In addition, lymphoid tissue was much more abundant in the lamina propria and submucosa of the ileocecal orifice as compared to the cecum and colon. Statistically, the MALT of the ileocecal orifice contained a higher number of lymphoid follicles (37.7/10 mm(2) ) than that of the cecum, colon, or rectum (Pâ<â0.05). The germinal centers of the lymphoid follicles were clearly visible. Together, our data suggest that the ileocecal orifice constitutes the main inductive site for the mucosal immunity in the large intestine of the Bactrian camel; and that scrotiform PPs are likely to the result of long-term adaptation of the Bactrian camel to the harsh living environment.

For this purpose, 22 camels were examined. The rumen and its glandular sacs were filling most of the left side of the abdomen. The rumen wall was smooth and echogenic. The ventral part of the reticulum could be best imaged in 17 (77%) camels from the left and right paramedian region just behind to the sternal pad. The reticulum in these animals had a thick wall (1.17Â±0.27 cm) that appeared as a half-moon-shaped structure with a biphasic contraction. The omasum was best viewed through the right 8th to 6th intercostal spaces in 18 (82%) camels. In the remaining 4 (18%), it was visualized through four consecutive intercostal spaces (right 9th to 6th). It had a wall thickness of 1.1Â±0.7 cm and a transverse diameter of 8.74Â±3.4 cm. The abomasum could be best visualized from the right 9th and 8th intercostal spaces in 14 (64%) camels, while it was observed in the 9th intercostal space in 3 (14%) animals and in the 8th and 7th intercostal space in 5 (22%) camels. Small intestinal structures were best seen low in the right paralumbar fossa. It was thin-walled (0.43Â±0.14 cm) and had a diameter of 2.62Â±0.47 cm. The cecum was imaged chiefly in the caudal right flank. It was thin-walled (0.37Â±0.05 cm), had a diameter of 13.8Â±1.6 cm. The proximal loop of the large colon appeared as thick, echogenic, continuous and slightly curved lines. It was thin-walled (0.51Â±0.08 cm) and had a diameter of 3.5Â±0.8 cm. The spiral colon was confined in all camels to the caudal ventral half of the abdomen. It appeared as structures with thick echoic lateral walls with a number of echogenic arched lines next to each other. Free peritoneal fluid pockets were imaged in two locations in 19 (86%) camels. Ultrasound-guided abdominocentesis was successful in 15 (68%) of the examined camels.
