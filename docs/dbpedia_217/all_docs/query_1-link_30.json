A total of 2400 blood samples were collected and examined by the buffy coat and thin blood film laboratory methods, and data were analyzed using the SPSS statistical software. The overall prevalence of camel trypanosomosis in the area was found to be 2.33 %. Prevalence was significantly different among the surveyed districts (Pâ=â0.000), the pastoral associations (Fâ=â6.408, Pâ=â0.000), altitudinal divisions (Pâ=â0.000), age groups (Pâ=â0.034), and between animals possessing packed cell volume (PCV) values greater than 25 % and less than 25 % (Pâ=â0.000); whereas, prevalence of the disease was not statistically significantly different between the sexes (Pâ=â0.311) and among the body condition score groups (Pâ=â0.739). The PCV of trypanosome positive and trypanosome negative camels differ significantly (Pâ=â0.001), and prevalence of trypanosomosis was seen to be negatively correlated with packed cell volume (râ=â-0.069, Pâ=â0.000) revealing the effect of camel trypanosomosis on anemia state of parasitized animals. In conclusion, camel trypanosomosis is a serious and economically important disease hampering camel production and productivity in southern Ethiopia. Further studies involving more sensitive molecular techniques to reveal the precise magnitude of the disease and to identify the vector species of the parasite are recommended.\n\nPerceptions and problems of disease in the one-humped camel in southern Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, R T\n\n2008-06-01\n\nThe one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) was first introduced to German South West Africa (Namibia) for military purposes in 1889. Introductions to the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) in 1897 and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) in 1903 were initially with a view to replacing oxen that died of rinderpest. Disease risks attendant on these introductions were recognised and to some extent guarded against. There were, however, relatively few problems. One camel was diagnosed as having foot-and-mouth disease. Mange in camels from India caused some concern as did trypanosomosis from Sudan. Trypanosomosis was introduced into both the Cape of Good Hope and Transvaal. Antibodies to some common livestock disease were found in later years.\n\nThe socio-economic impact of important camel diseases as perceived by a pastoralist community in Kenya.\n\nPubMed\n\nMochabo, M O K; Kitala, P M; Gathura, P B; Ogara, W O; Eregae, E M; Kaitho, T D; Catley, A\n\n2006-12-01\n\nThis paper presents the results of a study conducted in a pastoral community in Kenya using participatory appraisal approaches. The objective of the study was to assess the socio-economic impact of camel trypanosomosis (surra) according to the perceptions of the pastoralists. Four livestock grazing units were conveniently selected and in each of them, three groups of key informants comprising five to eight persons were selected for the participatory exercises. Five camel diseases were listed in order of importance according to their severity and frequency of occurrence including trypanosomosis, mange, non-specific diarrhoea, tick infestations and haemorrhagic septicaemia. The losses listed as incurred due to the five diseases were: losses in milk, meat, blood, fats and hides, dowry payments, and depreciation in sale of animals, losses due to infertility and abortions, and losses due to the cost of treatment. There was good agreement (P < 0.05) between the informant groups on the losses incurred as a result of the diseases for all the selected loss indicators. Surra and mange were given high median scores on all the indicators while non-specific diarrhoea, tick infestations, and haemorrhagic septicaemia received moderate median scores. Based on the study findings it is concluded that the camel plays a central role in the lives of Turkana pastoralists and that surra has a devastating social and economic impact. There is a need for veterinary and policy decision-makers to focus more attention on the control of surra in this arid and semi-arid area of Kenya.\n\nBovine trypanosomosis in the Bolivian Pantanal.\n\nPubMed\n\nGonzales, J L; Chacon, E; Miranda, M; Loza, A; Siles, L M\n\n2007-05-15\n\nTrypanosomosis caused by Trypanosoma vivax has been a constraint for cattle production in the Bolivian lowlands, since it was introduced in 1996. Flooded areas like the Bolivian Pantanal have a suitable environment for the presence and transmission of Salivarian trypanosomes and farmers from that region often report trypanosomosis-like problems on their farms. The objective of the present study, therefore, was to characterize the epidemiology of bovine trypanosomosis in the Bolivian Pantanal. In order to achieve this objective, 202 cattle from the province of Angel Sandoval and 209 cattle from the province of German Busch were randomly sampled (the Pantanal is located in both provinces). Twenty-nine farms in both provinces were visited, the farmers interviewed, and biologic samples collected from their cattle. Samples were submitted for parasitological and PCR evaluation and the prevalence of bovine trypanosomosis was estimated for each province. Laboratory results were correlated with the sampled animals packed cell volume (PCV) and body condition (BC) scores and the observed T. vivax parasites measured for morphometry analysis. Results from this study show differences in morphometric measures between T. vivax parasites from each province. Differences between provinces were also observed in the T. vivax-related disease situation. While in Angel Sandoval the PCV and BC of T. vivax-affected animals were significantly lower than those of the T. vivax-negative animals, in German Busch no differences were observed in the PCV and BC of T. vivax-positive or negative animals. Animal prevalence of T. vivax in Angel Sandoval was 27.79% (95% CI: 14.52-44.28) and in German Busch was 19.03% (95% CI: 9.19-30.75). The T. evansi animal prevalence in each province was 0.99% (95% CI: 0.27-2.99) and 5.71% (95% CI: 2.43-12.19), respectively. Based on questionnaire and laboratory results, it was concluded that trypanosomosis is a primary constraint for cattle production in the\n\nEthnoveterinary treatments by dromedary camel herders in the Suleiman Mountainous Region in Pakistan: an observation and questionnaire study.\n\nPubMed\n\nRaziq, Abdul; de Verdier, Kerstin; Younas, Muhammad\n\n2010-06-21\n\nThe Suleiman mountainous region is an important cradle of animal domestication and the habitat of many indigenous livestock breeds. The dromedary camel is a highly appreciated and valued animal and represents an important genetic resource. Camel herders, living in remote areas, have developed their own ways to treat diseases in camels, based on a long time of experience. Information about the diseases and the ethnoveterinary practices performed was collected from a total of 90 herders and healers by interviews and participant observations. The respondents classified the diseased in major and minor fractions. Clinical signs were given in detail. Mange followed by trypanosomosis and orf were considered the most prevalent diseases, and also caused the greatest economic losses. Orf was regarded the most complex disease. The season was considered to have great influence on the occurrence of the diseases. A variety of different treatments were described, such as medicinal plants, cauterization, odorant/fly repellents, pesticides, larvicides, cold drink, yogurt and supportive therapy (hot food, hot drink). There is paramount need to document and validate the indigenous knowledge about animal agriculture in general and ethnoveterinary practices in particular. This knowledge is rapidly disappearing and represents a cultural heritage as well as a valuable resource for attaining food security and sovereignty.\n\nSharing the blame: smoking experimentation and future smoking-attributable mortality due to Joe Camel and Marlboro advertising and promotions.\n\nPubMed\n\nPierce, J P; Gilpin, E A; Choi, W S\n\n1999-01-01\n\nDespite public denials, internal tobacco company documents indicate that adolescents have long been the target of cigarette advertising and promotional activities. Recent longitudinal evidence suggests that 34% of new experimentation occurs because of advertising and promotions. To apportion responsibility for smoking experimentation and future smoking-attributable mortality among major cigarette brands attractive to young people (Camel and Marlboro). DATA SOURCES, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Data were from confirmed never-smoking adolescents (12-17 years old) responding to the 1993 (n = 2659) and 1996 (n = 2779) population-based California Tobacco Surveys. Adolescents named the brand of their favourite cigarette advertisements and tobacco promotional items. Using these \"market shares\" and the relative importance of advertising and promotions in encouraging smoking, we estimated how many new experimenters from 1988 to 1998 in the United States can be attributed to Camel and Marlboro. From other data on the natural history of smoking, we projected how many future deaths in the United States can be attributed to each brand. Although Camel advertisements were favoured more than Marlboro and other brands in 1993 and 1996, the \"market share\" for promotional items shifted markedly during this period from Camel and other brands towards Marlboro. We estimated that between 1988 and 1998, there will be 7.9 million new experimenters because of tobacco advertising and promotions. This will result in 4.7 million new established smokers: 2.1, 1.2, and 1.4 million due to Camel, Marlboro, and other brands' advertising and promotions, respectively. Of these, 1.2 million will eventually die from smoking-attributable diseases: 520,000 from Camel, 300,000 from Marlboro, and the remainder from other brands. Our analysis provides a reasonable first estimate at sharing the blame for the long-term health consequences of smoking among the major brands that encourage adolescents to start\n\nThe effects of trypanosomosis on sperm morphology in Zebu x Friesian crossbred bulls.\n\nPubMed\n\nSekoni, V O; Rekwot, P I; Bawa, E K\n\n2004-01-01\n\nDetailed studies of sperm morphological abnormalities were carried out on 12 Zebu x Friesian crossbred bulls used in a study of the effects of trypanosomosis. Four bulls were infected with T. vivax, another four with T. congolense, while four served as controls. The infected bulls developed chronic trypanosomosis. All the bulls initially had very low sperm morphological abnormalities that were within acceptable limits for fertile animals. After infection there was a rapid and progressive increase in all sperm abnormalities. Spermatozoa of infected bulls were highly deformed with multiple morphological defects. Mean percentage pre-infection baseline values prior to infection for acrosomal, sperm-head, detached heads, proximal cytoplasmic droplets, distal cytoplasmic droplets, sperm-tail, midpiece and total sperm morphological defects ranged between 0.1 +/- 0.1 for acrosomal and 8.3 +/- 3.2 for total morphological abnormalities in the semen of the bulls. All the infected bulls developed sperm morphological abnormalities of more than a mean of 40.0% from the 4th week after infection until the end of the investigation and were considered unfit for breeding. At 7 weeks post-infection (PI) until the end of the study (12 weeks PI), the controls had a mean of less than 5% sperm morphological defects, while the infected bulls had 100%. Mean percentage values of sperm morphological defects throughout the duration of the investigation for control bulls were low and within the normal range for fertile bulls. These values differed significantly (p<0.001) from the elevated values of the infected bulls. The results show that trypanosomosis due to T. vivax or T. congolense infection can render Zebu x Friesian crossbred bulls unfit for breeding within a very short time. The resultant infertility could be of economic importance in trypanosomosis-endemic sub-Saharan Africa where Zebu x Friesian crossbred bulls are kept.\n\nRJR Nabisco's cartoon camel promotes camel cigarettes to children.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiFranza, J R; Richards, J W; Paulman, P M; Wolf-Gillespie, N; Fletcher, C; Jaffe, R D; Murray, D\n\n1991-12-11\n\nTo determine if RJR Nabisco's cartoon-theme advertising is more effective in promoting Camel cigarettes to children or to adults. To determine if children see, remember, and are influenced by cigarette advertising. Use of four standard marketing measures to compare the effects of Camel's Old Joe cartoon advertising on children and adults. High school students, grades 9 through 12, from five regions of the United States, and adults, aged 21 years and over, from Massachusetts. Recognition of Camel's Old Joe cartoon character, product and brand name recall, brand preference, appeal of advertising themes. Children were more likely to report prior exposure to the Old Joe cartoon character (97.7% vs 72.2%; P less than .0001). Children were better able to identify the type of product being advertised (97.5% vs 67.0%; P less than .0001) and the the Camel cigarette brand name (93.6% vs 57.7%; P less than .0001). Children also found the Camel cigarette advertisements more appealing (P less than .0001). Camel's share of the illegal children's cigarette market segment has increased from 0.5% to 32.8%, representing sales estimated at $476 million per year. Old Joe Camel cartoon advertisements are far more successful at marketing Camel cigarettes to children than to adults. This finding is consistent with tobacco industry documents that indicate that a major function of tobacco advertising is to promote and maintain tobacco addiction among children.\n\nImpact of habitat fragmentation on tsetse populations and trypanosomosis risk in Eastern Zambia.\n\nPubMed\n\nMweempwa, Cornelius; Marcotty, Tanguy; De Pus, Claudia; Penzhorn, Barend Louis; Dicko, Ahmadou Hamady; Bouyer, JÃ©rÃ©my; De Deken, Reginald\n\n2015-08-04\n\nFragmentation of tsetse habitat in eastern Zambia is largely due to encroachments by subsistence farmers into new areas in search of new agricultural land. The impact of habitat fragmentation on tsetse populations is not clearly understood. This study was aimed at establishing the impact of habitat fragmentation on physiological and demographic parameters of tsetse flies in order to enhance the understanding of the relationship between fragmentation and African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) risk. A longitudinal study was conducted to establish the age structure, abundance, proportion of females and trypanosome infection rate of Glossina morsitans morsitans Westwood (Diptera: Glossinidae) in areas of varying degrees of habitat fragmentation in Eastern Zambia. Black screen fly rounds were used to sample tsetse populations monthly for 1 year. Logistic regression was used to analyse age, proportion of females and infection rate data. Flies got significantly older as fragmentation increased (pâ<â0.004). The proportion of old flies, i.e. above ovarian category four, increased significantly (Pâ<â0.001) from 25.9% (CI 21.4-31.1) at the least fragmented site (Lusandwa) to 74.2% (CI 56.8-86.3) at the highly fragmented site (Chisulo). In the most fragmented area (Kasamanda), tsetse flies had almost disappeared. In the highly fragmented area a significantly higher trypanosome infection rate in tsetse (Pâ<â0.001) than in areas with lower fragmentation was observed. Consequently a comparatively high trypanosomosis incidence rate in livestock was observed there despite lower tsetse density (pâ<â0.001). The overall proportion of captured female flies increased significantly (Pâ<â0.005) as fragmentation reduced. The proportion increased from 0.135 (CI 0.10-0.18) to 0.285 (CI 0.26-0.31) at the highly and least fragmented sites, respectively. Habitat fragmentation creates conditions to which tsetse populations respond physiologically and demographically thereby\n\nSharing the blame: smoking experimentation and future smoking-attributable mortality due to Joe Camel and Marlboro advertising and promotions\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPierce, J.; Gilpin, E.; Choi, W.\n\n1999-01-01\n\nBACKGROUNDâDespite public denials, internal tobacco company documents indicate that adolescents have long been the target of cigarette advertising and promotional activities.

Endemic regions are often located in the countryside where laboratory diagnosis is costly or inaccessible. The establishment of simple, effective, and accurate field tests is therefore of great interest to the farming and veterinary sectors. Our study aimed to develop a simple, rapid, and sensitive immunochromatographic test (ICT) for animal trypanosomosis utilizing the recombinant tandem repeat antigen TeGM6-4r, which is conserved amongst salivarian trypanosome species. In the specificity analysis, TeGM6-4r/ICT detected all of Trypanosoma evansi-positive controls from experimentally infected water buffaloes. As expected, uninfected controls tested negative. All sera samples collected from Tanzanian and Ugandan cattle that were Trypanosoma congolense- and/or Trypanosoma vivax-positive by microscopic examination of the buffy coat were found to be positive by the newly developed TeGM6-4r/ICT, which was comparable to results from TeGM6-4r/ELISA (kappa coefficient [Îº]â=â0.78). TeGM6/ICT also showed substantial agreement with ELISA using Trypanosoma brucei brucei (Îºâ=â0.64) and T. congolense (Îºâ=â0.72) crude antigen, suggesting the high potential of TeGM6-4r/ICT as a field diagnostic test, both for research purposes and on-site diagnosis of animal trypanosomosis.\n\nExperimental study of camel powered electricity generation unit\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nJakhar, O. P.; Choudhary, Rahul Raj; Budaniya, Mukesh; Kumar, Ashish\n\n2018-05-01\n\nDeveloping nations are facing a huge gap in generation and demand of electricity across the world. In present scenario the demand of electricity is increasing day by day and the shortfall of electricity has become one of the major obstructions in the development of rural areas. There is a big gap between electricity supply and demand. In India it is very difficult that to give twenty four hours electric supply in rural areas. The traditional use of camel as draught animal, for the purpose of transport of goods and agricultural work, has been drastically reduced during last few decades, due to advancements and cheaper availability of mechanical machineries. In this research paper we experimentally studied the camel powered electricity generation system at National Research Centre on Camels (NRCC) Bikaner. Camel Energy in form of high torque low speed can be converted into low torque high speed through motion converting system i.e. gear and pulley mechanism for high RPM output. This high RPM (more than 3000) output is used for electricity generation. The electricity generated can be used directly or stored in the battery and later may be used whenever it is required either for DC light or AC light using inverter. According to experimental study a camel can comfortably generate electricity up to 1KW by rotating shaft. The complete set up for electricity generation using camel power has been designed, developed and physically commissioned at National Research Centre on Camels (NRCC) Bikaner.\n\nLevel of natural hepatotoxin (Indospicine) contamination in Australian camel meat.\n\nPubMed\n\nTan, Eddie T T; Al Jassim, Rafat; D'Arcy, Bruce R; Fletcher, Mary T\n\n2016-10-01\n\nCamel meat production for human consumption and pet food manufacture accounts for a relatively small part of overall red meat production in Australia. Reliable statistical data for the Australian production and consumption of camel meat are not available; however, it is estimated that 300,000 feral camels roam within the desert of central Australia, with an annual usage of more than 3000 camels for human consumption, 2000 for pet food manufacture and a smaller number for live export. Despite a small Australian camel meat production level, the usage of camel meat for pet food has been restricted in recent years due to reports of serious liver disease and death in dogs consuming camel meat. This camel meat was found to contain residues of indospicine, a non-proteinogenic amino acid found in certain Indigofera spp., and associated with mild to severe liver disease in diverse animals after dietary exposure to this hepatotoxin. The extent of indospicine-contaminated Australian camel meat was previously unknown, and this study ascertains the prevalence of such residue in Australian camel meat. In this study, indospicine levels in ex situ (95 samples collected from an abattoir in Queensland) and in situ (197 samples collected from camels after field culling in central Australia) camel meat samples were quantitated using a validated ultra-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). The quantitation results showed 46.7% of the in situ- and 20.0% of the ex situ-collected camel meat samples were contaminated by indospicine (more than the limit of detection (LOD) of 0.05 mgÂ kg -1 fresh weight). The overall indospicine concentration was higher (p < 0.05) in the in situ-collected samples. Indospicine levels detected in the present study are considered to be low; however, a degree of caution must still be exercised, since the tolerable daily intake for indospicine is currently not available for risk estimation.\n\nOccurrence and surgical repair of third degree perineal lacerations in adult female camels (Camelus dromedarius) by one-stage (Goetz) technique\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnwar, S.; Purohit, G.N.\n\n2013-01-01\n\nRetrospective analysis of third degree perineal lacerations in 7 female camels (6-17 yrs of age) that were surgically corrected by one stage repair (Goetz technique) is presented. Majority (3/7) of the camels was primiparous and all parturitions had a history of calving assistance. Six (6/7) camels recovered by first intention of healing. Dehiscence of perineal structure occurred in only one camel due to infection and healed by second intention. Subsequent matings resulted in pregnancy in four camels and one camel died due to unrelated causes. We conclude that perineal lacerations can occur in primiparous camels with difficult assisted deliveries and that one stage repair of perineal lacerations in camels improves the perineal conformation and such camels may easily regain normal fertility.

We determined the sequence of mitochondrial cytb gene from 21 camel samples, including 18 domestic camels (three Camelus bactrianus xinjiang, three Camelus bactrianus sunite, three Camelus bactrianus alashan, three Camelus bactrianus red, three Camelus bactrianus brown and three Camelus bactrianus normal) and three wild camels (Camelus bactrianus ferus). Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that the extant wild two-humped camel may not share a common ancestor with the domestic bactrian camel and they are not the same subspecies at least in their maternal origins. Molecular clock analysis based on complete mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that the sub-speciation of the two lineages had begun in the early Pleistocene, about 0.7 million years ago. According to the archaeological dating of the earliest known two-humped camel domestication (5000â6000 years ago), we could conclude that the extant wild camel is a separate lineage but not the direct progenitor of the domestic bactrian camel. Further phylogenetic analysis suggested that the bactrian camel appeared monophyletic in evolutionary origin and that the domestic bactrian camel could originate from a single wild population. The data presented here show how conservation strategies should be implemented to protect the critically endangered wild camel, as it is the last extant form of the wild tribe Camelina.

The first part of the study investigated livestock keeper knowledge about trypanosomosis and trypanotolerance. For each breed 60 livestock keepers were interviewed, resulting in a total of 240 interviews. The second part of the study focused on biological evidence for trypanotolerance. Blood samples of about 100 head of cattle per breed were collected during peak trypanosomosis challenge period and analyzed for packed cell volume (PCV) and parasitaemia. In addition individual body measurements of the sampled animals were taken and the keepers provided some information regarding their animals. Livestock keeper interviews revealed that trypanosomosis was considered a major problem in all areas (95-100%). Almost all Abigar livestock keepers knew how trypanosomosis is transmitted, whereas only 34-52% of the keepers of the other breeds had that knowledge. Most Sheko keepers (75%) knew of trypanotolerance and claimed to have trypanotolerant animals in their own herds. Among the other three breeds the knowledge of trypanotolerance was much less (8-18%). A majority of the keepers were interested in purchasing trypanotolerant animals. PCV was highest among Horro (26.2) and Sheko (25.1) cattle whereas Abigar had the lowest PCV (20.0). Sheko were least infected by trypanosomes (6%) and had the lowest number of trypanocidal treatments per year (1 treatment/animal and year). Abigar cattle were most infected (23%) followed by Gurage (20%) and Horro (17%). Gurage had by far the highest number of treatments per animal and year (24). There were large differences between the number of cattle perceived by the keepers to be infected, and the number detected from blood sampled, among Abigar, Gurage and Horro. Sheko livestock keepers were better at correctly diagnosing trypanosomosis in their animals. It is concluded that Sheko cattle have higher\n\nA Spatio-temporal Model of African Animal Trypanosomosis Risk\n\nPubMed Central\n\nDicko, Ahmadou H.; Percoma, Lassane; Sow, Adama; Adam, Yahaya; Mahama, Charles; SidibÃ©, Issa; Dayo, Guiguigbaza-Kossigan; ThÃ©venon, Sophie; Fonta, William; Sanfo, Safietou; Djiteye, Aligui; Salou, Ernest; Djohan, Vincent; Cecchi, Giuliano; Bouyer, JÃ©rÃ©my\n\n2015-01-01\n\nBackground African animal trypanosomosis (AAT) is a major constraint to sustainable development of cattle farming in sub-Saharan Africa. The habitat of the tsetse fly vector is increasingly fragmented owing to demographic pressure and shifts in climate, which leads to heterogeneous risk of cyclical transmission both in space and time. In Burkina Faso and Ghana, the most important vectors are riverine species, namely Glossina palpalis gambiensis and G. tachinoides, which are more resilient to human-induced changes than the savannah and forest species. Although many authors studied the distribution of AAT risk both in space and time, spatio-temporal models allowing predictions of it are lacking. Methodology/Principal Findings We used datasets generated by various projects, including two baseline surveys conducted in Burkina Faso and Ghana within PATTEC (Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomosis Eradication Campaign) national initiatives. We computed the entomological inoculation rate (EIR) or tsetse challenge using a range of environmental data. The tsetse apparent density and their infection rate were separately estimated and subsequently combined to derive the EIR using a âone layer-one modelâ approach. The estimated EIR was then projected into suitable habitat. This risk index was finally validated against data on bovine trypanosomosis. It allowed a good prediction of the parasitological status (r2 = 67%), showed a positive correlation but less predictive power with serological status (r2 = 22%) aggregated at the village level but was not related to the illness status (r2 = 2%). Conclusions/Significance The presented spatio-temporal model provides a fine-scale picture of the dynamics of AAT risk in sub-humid areas of West Africa. The estimated EIR was high in the proximity of rivers during the dry season and more widespread during the rainy season. The present analysis is a first step in a broader framework for an efficient risk management of climate\n\nGenetic diversity and phylogeographic structure of Bactrian camels shown by mitochondrial sequence variations.\n\nPubMed\n\nMing, L; Yi, L; Sa, R; Wang, Z X; Wang, Z; Ji, R\n\n2017-04-01\n\nThe Bactrian camel includes various domestic (Camelus bactrianus) and wild (Camelus ferus) breeds that are important for transportation and for their nutritional value. However, there is a lack of extensive information on their genetic diversity and phylogeographic structure. Here, we studied these parameters by examining an 809-bp mtDNA fragment from 113 individuals, representing 11 domestic breeds, one wild breed and two hybrid individuals. We found 15 different haplotypes, and the phylogenetic analysis suggests that domestic and wild Bactrian camels have two distinct lineages. The analysis of molecular variance placed most of the genetic variance (90.14%, PÂ <Â 0.01) between wild and domestic camel lineages, suggesting that domestic and wild Bactrian camel do not have the same maternal origin. The analysis of domestic Bactrian camels from different geographical locations found there was no significant genetic divergence in China, Russia and Mongolia. This suggests a strong gene flow due to wide movement of domestic Bactrian camels. Â© 2016 The Authors.

The disease is caused by a complex of trypanosome species, and the species and strain of parasite can have a profound influence upon the epidemiology of the host-parasite-vector relationships, the severity and course of infection, and, consequently, the implementation and development of control methods. This review will summarise our current knowledge of the relationship between trypanosome species/genotype and the phenotype of disease in cattle, and the implications that this has for ongoing efforts to develop diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for the control of cattle trypanosomosis.\n\nBrucellosis in camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Darfur, Western Sudan.\n\nPubMed\n\nMusa, M T; Eisa, M Z M; El Sanousi, E M; Abdel Wahab, M B; Perrett, L\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn a field outbreak of brucellosis in 21 camels mixed with cattle, sheep and goats, five camels, three of which showed clinical signs, were serologically positive. In a subsequent abattoir survey of apparently healthy camels, six animals were seropositive, albeit with titres that tended to be lower than those found in the field outbreak. Of the six seropositive slaughtered camels, five were shown to have lymph nodes (prescapular and supramammary) infected with brucellae (Brucella melitensis biovar 3, two camels; Brucella abortus biovar 6, three camels). Infection of camels with B. abortus biovar 6 had not previously been reported. Infection of the supramammary lymph nodes presents a potential hazard to those who consume raw camels' milk, a common practice in nomadic camel owners.\n\nPlague from Eating Raw Camel Liver\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAl-Hamdan, Nasser A.; Fontaine, Robert E.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe investigated a cluster of 5 plague cases; the patients included 4 with severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. These 4 case-patients had eaten raw camel liver. Yersinia pestis was isolated from bone marrow of the camel and from jirds (Meriones libycus) and fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel corral.

This practice suggests that many apparently healthy infected animals are left untreated. In this study animal trypanosomosis in clinically healthy zebu cattle was evaluated, the distribution of the vectors established and the epidemiological implications discussed. In 2014 two cross-sectional surveys were carried out in the Cambeef ranch. A total of 866 blood samples were collected from cattle in different sites: 549 in the dry season and 317 in the rainy season. The blood samples were subjected to parasitological examination using the buffy coat method and to PCV determination. An entomological survey on animal trypanosomosis vectors was undertaken during tsetse flies caught were identified and the mid-gut of each living non-teneral tsetse fly was examined for infections using a microscope. An overall trypanosomosis prevalence of 9% was found in the cattle examined. There were significantly (Pâ<â0.05) more trypanosome infected cattle in the dry season than the rainy season. Trypanosome-infected cattle had significantly (Pâ<â0.05) lower Body Condition Scores (BCS) and Packed Cell Volumes (PCV) in the dry season than in the rainy season. Anemia was positively correlated with trypanosome infection. The likelihood for an animal to be parasitologically free of trypanosome infection was at least three times as high in the Gudali breed as compared with the white and red Fulani breeds. Species of trypanosomes identified were Trypanosoma vivax (73.23%), Trypanosoma congolense (15.49%) and Trypanosoma brucei (11.27%). A total of 390 tsetse flies and 103 tabanids were trapped. Two species of tsetse flies were identified: Glossina tachinoides (33.59%) and G. morsitans submorsitans (41%). Nine of the 194 non-teneral flies were infected with trypanosomes. Carriers of trypanosomes are present\n\nInsecticide and Repellent Mixture Pour-On Protects Cattle against Animal Trypanosomosis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAbdoulmoumini, Mamoudou; Zoli, Andre; Cene, Bylah; Adakal, Hassane; Bouyer, JÃ©rÃ©my\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground African animal trypanosomosis (AAT), transmitted by tsetse flies and tick-borne diseases are the main constraints to livestock production in sub-Saharan Africa. Vector control methods such as pour-on offer individual protection against ticks but not against tsetse so far, for which protection has always been communal, through a reduction of their density. The latter requires the treatment of a large part of the herd in a given landscape and is not instantaneous. Methodology/Principal Findings Two prospective surveys were conducted to evaluate the efficacy and persistence of a pour-on formulation composed of cypermetrhin, chlorpyrifos, piperonyl butoxid and citronella (Vectoclor, CEVA SantÃ© Animal). In experimental conditions, tsetse flies were exposed to treated and control cattle. Flies knockdown and engorgement rates were determined and the product persistence was assessed as the time for these parameters to drop below 50% (T50). T50 was 37 days (95%CI: [33â41] days) and 46 days (95%CI: [39â56] days) for the knockdown and engorgement rates respectively. In field conditions, two cattle herds were monitored following a case-control experimental design, in the Adamaoua region of Cameroon. One herd was treated once with Vectoclor pour-on (treated group) and the second used as a control group (not treated). Ticks infestation rate, trypanosomosis prevalence and packed-cell volume were measured over the two months following treatment. The treatment was highly effective against ticks with a complete elimination three days after application in the treated group. Trypanosomosis prevalence was also significantly reduced during the study (by 4, P<0.001) and PCV of the treated group increased significantly in the same time (P<0.001), contrary to the control group. Conclusions/Significance The protection of this new pour-on against tsetse bites and trypanosomosis is demonstrated here for the first time. Moreover, this insecticide and repellent mixture offer a\n\nHydatidosis of camel (Camelus dromedarius) at Jijiga municipal abattoir, Eastern Ethiopia: prevalence, associated risk factors and financial implication.\n\nPubMed\n\nDebela, Etana; Abdulahi, Buckhary; Megersa, Bekele; Kumsa, Bersissa; Abunna, Fufa; Sheferaw, Desie; Regassa, Alemayehu\n\n2015-12-01\n\nA cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2010 to May 2011 to estimate the prevalence of camel hydatidosis, associated risk factors and financial loss in Jijiga municipal abattoir, Somali Regional State, Eastern Ethiopia. Accordingly, of the total 400 inspected camel, 92 (23Â %) camels and 109 organs were positive for hydatid cyst with the highest proportion recorded in lung (56Â %) followed by liver (33.9Â %), spleen (7.3Â %) and kidneys (2.8Â %). The prevalence of hydatidosis significantly varied among age categories (PÂ <Â 0.05), sex (PÂ <Â 0.05) and body condition score (PÂ <Â 0.05) of camels. Hence, there is higher likelihood for occurrence of camel hydatidosis among the older age groups (OR 1.8, 95Â % CI 1.2, 3.3), in female camels (OR 2.8, 95Â % CI 1.7, 4.7) and in poor body conditioned camels (OR 4.1, 95Â % CI 2.2, 7.9) than younger camels, males and camels with good body condition score, respectively. Of the total 288 examined cysts for fertility and viability, 59.7Â % (172/288) were fertile while the rest 24.0Â % (69/288) cysts were sterile. Of the 172 fertile cysts 69.8Â % (nÂ =Â 120) were viable and 30.2Â % (nÂ =Â 52) were non-viable. The rest 16.3Â % (47/288) cysts were found dead. It was also observed that the pulmonary and hepatic cysts had fertility rate of 63.7Â % (116/182) and 57.4Â % (54/94), respectively. The total annual direct financial loss recorded in this study as result of organs condemnation due to hydatid cyst, was 12,147.75 Ethiopian birrs ($714.57 or $7.77/camel). If this value could be extrapolated to the infected camel population of the region, financial loss due to hydatidosis could be enormous. In conclusion, this study showed the importance of hydatidosis and the associated direct financial loss due to the condemnation of organs affected by hydatid cyst in the study area.\n\nA Frameshift Mutation in KIT is Associated with White Spotting in the Arabian Camel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nHoll, Heather; Isaza, Ramiro; Mohamoud, Yasmin; Ahmed, Ayeda; Almathen, Faisal; Youcef, Cherifi; Gaouar, Semir; Antczak, Douglas F.; Brooks, Samantha\n\n2017-01-01\n\nWhile the typical Arabian camel is characterized by a single colored coat, there are rare populations with white spotting patterns. White spotting coat patterns are found in virtually all domesticated species, but are rare in wild species. Theories suggest that white spotting is linked to the domestication process, and is occasionally associated with health disorders. Though mutations have been found in a diverse array of species, fewer than 30 genes have been associated with spotting patterns, thus providing a key set of candidate genes for the Arabian camel. We obtained 26 spotted camels and 24 solid controls for candidate gene analysis. One spotted and eight solid camels were whole genome sequenced as part of a separate project. The spotted camel was heterozygous for a frameshift deletion in KIT (c.1842delG, named KITW1 for White spotting 1), whereas all other camels were wild-type (KIT+/KIT+). No additional mutations unique to the spotted camel were detected in the EDNRB, EDN3, SOX10, KITLG, PDGFRA, MITF, and PAX3 candidate white spotting genes. Sanger sequencing of the study population identified an additional five KITW1/KIT+ spotted camels. The frameshift results in a premature stop codon five amino acids downstream, thus terminating KIT at the tyrosine kinase domain. An additional 13 spotted camels tested KIT+/KIT+, but due to phenotypic differences when compared to the KITW1/KIT+ camels, they likely represent an independent mutation. Our study suggests that there are at least two causes of white spotting in the Arabian camel, the newly described KITW1 allele and an uncharacterized mutation.

Here we present a 2.01âGb draft genome sequence from both a wild and a domestic bactrian camel. We estimate the camel genome to be 2.38âGb, containing 20,821 protein-coding genes. Our phylogenomics analysis reveals that camels shared common ancestors with other even-toed ungulates about 55â60 million years ago. Rapidly evolving genes in the camel lineage are significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, and these changes may underlie the insulin resistance typically observed in these animals. We estimate the genome-wide heterozygosity rates in both wild and domestic camels to be 1.0 Ã 10â3. However, genomic regions with significantly lower heterozygosity are found in the domestic camel, and olfactory receptors are enriched in these regions. Our comparative genomics analyses may also shed light on the genetic basis of the camel's remarkable salt tolerance and unusual immune system.

Blood samples were collected to 0, 5, 10, 15, 45, and 60 minutes and at 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 26, 28, 30, 40, 48, 50, 53, and 60 hours after i.v. administration of 4.5 mg of phenylbutazone per kg of body weight. Urine was obtained in fractions during the entire blood sample collection period. Serum and urine phenylbutazone concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography; assay sensitivity was 100 ng/ml. Serum oxyphenbutazone concentration was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; assay sensitivity was 10 ng/ml. Disposition of phenylbutazone was best described by a two-compartment open model. Mean +/- SEM elimination half-life was 13.44 +/- 0.44 hours. Total body clearance was 12.63 +/- 1.64 mg/kg/h. Renal clearance was between 0.3 and 0.4% of total body clearance. The elimination half-life of oxyphenbutazone was 23.9 +/- 2.09 hours. The elimination half-life and total body clearance of phenylbutazone in camels are intermediate between reported values in horses and cattle. Extrapolation of a dosage regimen from either species to camels is, therefore, not appropriate. Elimination of phenylbutazone in camels is mainly via metabolism. Owing to the long half-life of phenylbutazone and of oxyphenbutazone, and to the zero drug concentration regulation adopted by the racing commissioner in the United Arab Emirates, practicing veterinarians would be advised not to use phenylbutazone in camels for at least 7 days prior to racing.\n\nPrevalence and species distribution of caprine trypanosomosis in Sinazongwe and Kalomo districts of Zambia.\n\nPubMed\n\nNyimba, P H; Komba, E V G; Sugimoto, C; Namangala, B\n\n2015-06-15\n\nAfrican animal trypanosomosis is one of the key livestock diseases hindering full exploitation of livestock production potential covering 37 countries across sub-Saharan Africa. Many studies have been carried out to investigate the prevalence of the disease in cattle and humans in many tropical African countries but very little attention has been directed towards generating the disease prevalence rates in goats. The current study was conducted between December 2013 and January 2014 to establish the prevalence of caprine trypanosomosis in Sinazongwe and Kalomo districts, southern Zambia. It involved 422 goats which were first examined by palpation for possible enlargement of superficial lymph nodes. Blood samples were then collected from the goats and subjected to laboratory diagnosis using the microscope and Loop Mediated Isothermal Amplification (LAMP). None of the examined goats displayed enlargement of superficial lymph nodes. On microscopy only one goat was found to be positive. The results of investigation using the LAMP method showed that 100 goats were infected with trypanosomes giving an overall prevalence rate of 23.7%. The prevalence of infection in Sinazongwe was 22.4% (n=183) while in Kalomo it was 24.7% (n=239); and the difference between the two districts was statistically significant at 95% CL (x(2)=4.4, df=1, p<0.05). Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanasoma vivax and Trypanasoma congolense were detected in 82.0%, 31.0% and 23.0% of the infected goats, respectively. Mixed infections were detected among 33.0% of the positive samples. The high prevalence rate of trypanosomes detected in the study area confirms the earlier reports that trypanosomosis is re-emerging in the areas previously aerial sprayed by Government. The detection of trypanosomes in naturally infected goats outlines the important role goats play in the epidemiology of African animal trypanosomosis. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Knowing where the potential benefits of removing animal trypanosomosis are distributed geographically would provide crucial evidence for prioritising and targeting cost-effective interventions as well as a powerful tool for advocacy. To this end, a study was conducted on six tsetse-infested countries in Eastern Africa: Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia, South Sudan, Sudan and Uganda. First, a map of cattle production systems was generated, with particular attention to the presence of draught and dairy animals. Second, herd models for each production system were developed for two scenarios: with or without trypanosomosis. The herd models were based on publications and reports on cattle productivity (fertility, mortality, yields, sales), from which the income from, and growth of cattle populations were estimated over a twenty-year period. Third, a step-wise spatial expansion model was used to estimate how cattle populations might migrate to new areas when maximum stocking rates are exceeded. Last, differences in income between the two scenarios were mapped, thus providing a measure of the maximum benefits that could be obtained from intervening against tsetse and trypanosomosis. For this information to be readily mappable, benefits were calculated per bovine and converted to US$ per square kilometre. Results indicate that the potential benefits from dealing with trypanosomosis in Eastern Africa are both very high and geographically highly variable. The estimated total maximum benefit to livestock keepers for the whole of the study area amounts to nearly US$ 2.5 billion, discounted at 10% over twenty years--an average of approximately US$ 3300 per square kilometre of tsetse-infested area--but with great regional variation from less than US$ 500 per square kilometre to well over US$ 10,000.

The naturally occurring disease in Sudanese camels is characterized by emaciation, anaemia, oedema of the lower parts of the limbs, eosinophilia, hypoproteinaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, hyperglobulinaemia and eosinophilia, as well as elevated blood urea concentrations.\n\nProcessing Challenges and Opportunities of Camel Dairy Products\n\nPubMed Central\n\nSeifu, Eyassu; Ipsen, Richard; Kurtu, Mohamed Y.; Hansen, Egon Bech\n\n2017-01-01\n\nA review on the challenges and opportunities of processing camel milk into dairy products is provided with an objective of exploring the challenges of processing and assessing the opportunities for developing functional products from camel milk. The gross composition of camel milk is similar to bovine milk. Nonetheless, the relative composition, distribution, and the molecular structure of the milk components are reported to be different. Consequently, manufacturing of camel dairy products such as cheese, yoghurt, or butter using the same technology as for dairy products from bovine milk can result in processing difficulties and products of inferior quality. However, scientific evidence points to the possibility of transforming camel milk into products by optimization of the processing parameters. Additionally, camel milk has traditionally been used for its medicinal values and recent scientific studies confirm that it is a rich source of bioactive, antimicrobial, and antioxidant substances. The current literature concerning product design and functional potential of camel milk is fragmented in terms of time, place, and depth of the research. Therefore, it is essential to understand the fundamental features of camel milk and initiate detailed multidisciplinary research to fully explore and utilize its functional and technological properties.

In the ammonium sulfate precipitation, the best condition for fractionation of IgG from the other proteins in camel serum was 55% precipitate. The camel IgG presented as 2 bands with molecular masses of 250 and 100 kDa, the latter corresponding to heavy chain IgG, on 10% gel electrophoresis. A trace amount of non-IgG proteins was not isolated and remained in this precipitate. Therefore in order to effectively separate albumin and the other nonspecific proteins from the IgG, the 25% precipitate of ammonium sulfate precipitation of serum was subjected to DEAE-Sepharose CL-6B column chromatography. A peak of antibody (IgG) could be obtained by elution with sodium phosphate buffer. In this stage, 2 bands of molecular masses of 150 and 75 kDa were observed on 7% gel electrophoresis. A comparative study was performed between camel IgG and conventional horse F(ab)2 antivenoms in term of potency (serum neutralization test and ELISA). Our results showed that the potency of camel antivenom was 4-fold higher than that of horse. It is suggested the combined ammonium sulfate precipitation and ion-exchange chromatography process effectively removed residual proteins in the final camel IgG preparation and can be a suitable method for large-scale refinement of therapeutic camel antivenoms.

Therefore, computational methods for this purpose are crucial to the design of such wet-lab experiments. We present an algorithm suite called CaMELS (CalModulin intEraction Learning System) for predicting proteins that interact with CaM as well as their binding sites using sequence information alone. CaMELS offers state of the art accuracy for both CaM interaction and binding site prediction and can aid biologists in studying CaM binding proteins. For CaM interaction prediction, CaMELS uses protein sequence features coupled with a large-margin classifier. CaMELS models the binding site prediction problem using multiple instance machine learning with a custom optimization algorithm which allows more effective learning over imprecisely annotated CaM-binding sites during training. CaMELS has been extensively benchmarked using a variety of data sets, mutagenic studies, proteome-wide Gene Ontology enrichment analyses and protein structures. Our experiments indicate that CaMELS outperforms simple motif-based search and other existing methods for interaction and binding site prediction. We have also found that the whole sequence of a protein, rather than just its binding site, is important for predicting its interaction with CaM. Using the machine learning model in CaMELS, we have identified important features of protein sequences for CaM interaction prediction as well as characteristic amino acid sub-sequences and their relative position for identifying CaM binding sites. Python code for training and evaluating CaMELS together with a webserver implementation is available at the URL: http://faculty.pieas.edu.pk/fayyaz/software.html#camels.

However, the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in such effects remain completely unknown. In this study, we hypothesized that camel milk may act at the level of human insulin receptor (hIR) and its related intracellular signaling pathways. Therefore, we examined the effect of camel milk on the activation of hIR transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells using bioluminescence resonance energy transfer (BRET) technology. BRET was used to assess, in live cells and real-time, the physical interaction between hIR and insulin receptor signaling proteins (IRS1) and the growth factor receptor-bound protein 2 (Grb2). Our data showed that camel milk did not promote any increase in the BRET signal between hIR and IRS1 or Grb2 in the absence of insulin stimulation. However, it significantly potentiated the maximal insulin-promoted BRET signal between hIR and Grb2 but not IRS1. Interestingly, camel milk appears to differentially impact the downstream signaling since it significantly activated ERK1/2 and potentiated the insulin-induced ERK1/2 but not Akt activation. These observations are to some extent consistent with the BRET data since ERK1/2 and Akt activation are known to reflect the engagement of Grb2 and IRS1 pathways, respectively. The preliminary fractionation of camel milk suggests the peptide/protein nature of the active component in camel milk. Together, our study demonstrates for the first time an allosteric effect of camel milk on insulin receptor conformation and activation with differential effects on its intracellular signaling. These findings should help to shed more light on the hypoglycemic activity of camel milk with potential therapeutic applications.

In northern Kenya, under conditions of reduced rainfall and more frequent droughts, one response has been for pastoralists to focus increasingly on camel herding. Camels have started to be kept at higher altitudes and by people who rarely kept camels before. The development has been understood as a climate change adaptation strategy and as a means to improve climate resilience. Since 2003, development organizations have started to further the trend by distributing camels in the region. Up to now, little has been known about the nature of, reasons for, or ramifications of the increased reliance on camels. The paper addresses these questions and concludes that camels improve resilience in this dryland region, but only under certain climate change scenarios, and only for some groups.\n\nThe clinico-pathology and mechanisms of trypanosomosis in captive and free-living wild animals: a review.\n\nPubMed\n\nMbaya, A W; Aliyu, M M; Ibrahim, U I\n\n2009-10-01\n\nReports on the clinico-pathology and mechanisms of trypanosomosis in free-living and captive wild animals showed that clinical disease and outbreaks occur more commonly among captive than free-living wild animals. This is because the free-living wild animals co-exist with the disease until subjected to captivity. In exceptional cases however, draught, starvation and intercurrent diseases often compromised trypanotolerance leading to overt trypanosomosis in free-living wild animals. Meanwhile, in captivity, space restriction, reduced social interactions, change in social herd structure, reduced specie-to-specie specific behaviors, altered habitat and translocation were the major stressors that precipitated the disease. The cumulative effect of these factors produced severe physiological and somatic stress leading to diminished immune response due to increased blood cortisol output from adrenal cortex. The major symptoms manifested were pyrexia, innapetence, increased respiration, anaemia, cachexia and death. At necropsy, pulmonary oedema, splenomegally, hepatomegally, lympadenopathy and atrophy of body fats were the gross changes encountered. At the ultra-structural level, the tissues manifested degenerative changes, haemorghages, necrosis and mononuclear cellular infiltrations. The mechanisms of cellular and tissue injuries were primarily associated with physical and metabolic activities of the organisms. From the foregoing, it is evident that stress is the underlying mechanism that compromises trypanotolerance in wild animals leading to severe clinico-pathological effects.\n\nIntraocular pressure in clinically normal dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nMarzok, Mohamed A; El-Khodery, Sabry A\n\n2015-02-01\n\nTo determine the intraocular pressure (IOP) in healthy dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius). 24 clinically normal dromedary camels. For each camel, the IOP of both eyes was measured with applanation tonometry. Three measurements with < 5% variance were obtained for each eye on the same day of the week for 3 consecutive weeks. Mean IOP was calculated for each eye on each day for comparison purposes. Mean Â± SD IOPs for the right (31.1 Â± 2.1 mm Hg) and left (30.8 Â± 1.9 mm Hg) eyes of immature camels were significantly higher than those for the right (27.1 Â± 1.2 mm Hg) and left (28.2 Â± 1.2 mm Hg) eyes of mature camels. Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) for IOP measurements of the right and left eyes did not differ significantly between immature and mature camels. Interassay CVs of IOP measurements for the right and left eyes ranged from 1.5% to 12.1% and 1.2% to 10.3%, respectively, for immature camels and from 1.2% to 17.2% and 1.7% to 18.8%, respectively, for mature camels. Intra-assay CVs of IOP measurements for the right and left eyes ranged from 1.5% to 10.6% and 1.9% to 9.6%, respectively, for immature camels and from 2.8% to 16.9% and 2.7% to 12.4%, respectively, for mature camels. Age was negatively correlated (r = -0.403) with IOP. Results provided a reference and might aid in the diagnosis of glaucoma and uveitis during complete ophthalmic examinations of dromedary camels.\n\nFrequency of trypanosomosis and gastrointestinal parasites in draught donkeys in The Gambia in relation to animal husbandry.\n\nPubMed\n\nMattioli, R C; Zinsstag, J; Pfister, K\n\n1994-05-01\n\nPrevalence of trypanosomosis, gastrointestinal strongyles and level of strongyle egg outputs were studied in relation to husbandry practices in the draught donkey population in The Gambia. Feeding regime, number of working hours per day and overnight penning practices of donkeys affected significantly (P < 0.05) the level of gastrointestinal strongyle egg output, but not (P > 0.05) trypanosomosis prevalence. Dual trypanosome and gastrointestinal strongyle infection significantly reduced the PCV (P < 0.001). Animals positive for gastrointestinal strongyles alone did not show a significantly (P > 0.05) lower PCV than those found negative. Husbandry practices to improve the situation are recommended.\n\nCharacterization of the aggregation responses of camel platelets.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl Ghumlas, Abeer K; Gader, Abdel Galil M Abdel\n\n2013-09-01\n\nDespite evidence of active hemostasis, camel platelets barely respond to common aggregating agents at standard doses used for human platelet aggregation. The purpose of the study was to find out whether camel platelets can be activated by high doses or combinations of aggregation agonists, and to characterize the receptor that mediates the aggregation response to adenosine diphosphate (ADP), the most potent agonist for camel platelets known so far. Aggregation studies were performed with platelet-rich plasma (PRP) in response to multiple doses or combinations of ADP, epinephrine (EPN), collagen, and arachidonic acid (AA). Aggregation responses to ADP were performed before and after the addition of the ADP receptor (P2Y12) antagonist Clopidogrel. Camel platelets responded to ADP at doses higher than the standard dose for human platelets, and to combinations of EPN and other agonists, while no aggregation was elicited with EPN or AA alone. Clopidogrel blocked the ADP-induced aggregation responses in a dose-dependent fashion in vitro. Camel platelet aggregation can be activated by increasing the dose of some agonists such as ADP, but not AA or EPN. Irreversible aggregation of camel platelets could also be triggered by a combination of EPN and ADP, and collagen and AA. Inhibition with clopidogrel suggests that camel platelets express the ADP receptor, P2Y12. Understanding platelet function in camels will add to the understanding of platelet function in health and disease.

CAMEL provides an integrated framework for modeling all types of earthquake-induced landslides using fuzzy logic systems and geographic information systems. CAMEL is designed to facilitate quantitative and qualitative representation of terrain conditions and knowledge about these conditions on the likely areal concentration of each landslide type. CAMEL has been empirically evaluated with respect to disrupted landslides (Category I) using a case study of the 1989 M = 6.9 Loma Prieta, CA earthquake. In this case, CAMEL performs best in comparison to disrupted slides and falls in soil. For disrupted rock fall and slides, CAMEL's performance was slightly poorer. The model predicted a low occurrence of rock avalanches, when none in fact occurred. A similar comparison with the Loma Prieta case study was also conducted using a simplified Newmark displacement model. The area under the curve method of evaluation was used in order to draw comparisons between both models, revealing improved performance with CAMEL. CAMEL should not however be viewed as a strict alternative to Newmark displacement models. CAMEL can be used to integrate Newmark displacements with other, previously incompatible, types of knowledge. ?? 2008 Elsevier B.V.\n\nNo Serologic Evidence of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus Infection Among Camel Farmers Exposed to Highly Seropositive Camel Herds: A Household Linked Study, Kenya, 2013.\n\nPubMed\n\nMunyua, Peninah; Corman, Victor Max; Bitek, Austine; Osoro, Eric; Meyer, Benjamin; MÃ¼ller, Marcel A; Lattwein, Erik; Thumbi, S M; Murithi, Rees; Widdowson, Marc-Alain; Drosten, Christian; Njenga, M Kariuki\n\n2017-06-01\n\nAbstractHigh seroprevalence of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) among camels has been reported in Kenya and other countries in Africa. To date, the only report of MERS-CoV seropositivity among humans in Kenya is of two livestock keepers with no known contact with camels. We assessed whether persons exposed to seropositive camels at household level had serological evidence of infection. In 2013, 760 human and 879 camel sera were collected from 275 and 85 households respectively in Marsabit County. Data on human and animal demographics and type of contact with camels were collected. Human and camel sera were tested for anti-MERS-CoV IgG using a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) test. Human samples were confirmed by plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT). Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with seropositivity. The median age of persons sampled was 30 years (range: 5-90) and 50% were males. A quarter (197/760) of the participants reported having had contact with camels defined as milking, feeding, watering, slaughtering, or herding. Of the human sera, 18 (2.4%) were positive on ELISA but negative by PRNT. Of the camel sera, 791 (90%) were positive on ELISA. On univariate analysis, higher prevalence was observed in female and older camels over 4 years of age ( P < 0.05). On multivariate analysis, only age remained significantly associated with increased odds of seropositivity. Despite high seroprevalence among camels, there was no serological confirmation of MERS-CoV infection among camel pastoralists in Marsabit County. The high seropositivity suggests that MERS-CoV or other closely related virus continues to circulate in camels and highlights ongoing potential for animal-to-human transmission.\n\nCamel Calves as Opportunistic Milk Thefts? The First Description of Allosuckling in Domestic Bactrian Camel (Camelus bactrianus)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nBrandlovÃ¡, KarolÃ­na; BartoÅ¡, LudÄk; HaberovÃ¡, Tamara\n\n2013-01-01\n\nAllosuckling is a situation when a female nurses a non-filial offspring. It was described in various ungulate species; however for camels this is the first description of this behaviour. The aim of the study was to assess the occurrence of allosuckling in captive camels (Camelus bactrianus) and to test whether it can be explained as a âmilk-theftâ (opportunistic behaviour of calves) or alternatively as an altruistic behaviour of females. During 2005 and 2007, nine camel females and ten calves in four zoological gardens in the Czech Republic were observed. In total, 373 sucking bouts were recorded, from which 32 were non-filial (the calf sucked from the non-maternal female). Allosuckling regularly appeared in captive camel herds. As predicted for the milk-theft explanation, the non-filial calves sucked more often in the lateral position and even did not suck in the antiparallel position at all. The non-filial calves preferably joined the filial calf when sucking but in five cases (15.6% of non-filial sucking bouts) the calves sucked from non-maternal dam without the presence of filial calf. We then expected the differences in terminations of sucking bouts by females but did not find any difference in sucking terminations for filial and non-filial calves. As the calves were getting older, the incidence of allosucking increased. This was probably because skills of the calf to outwit the non-maternal dam increased and/or the older calves might be more motivated for allosucking due to the weaning process. Finally, duration of a sucking bout was shorter with non-filial than filial calves. The results of the study support the hypothesis of âmilk theftâ, being mostly performed by calves behaving as opportunistic parasites, but we cannot reject certain level of altruism from the allonursing females or their increased degree of tolerance to non-filial calves. PMID:23326378\n\nVulvar pythiosis in two captive camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nVidela, Ricardo; van Amstel, Sarel; O'neill, Sarah H; Frank, Linda A; Newman, Shelley J; Vilela, Raquel; Mendoza, Leonel\n\n2012-02-01\n\nTwo camels (Camelus dromedarius), 3- and 4-years-old, respectively, from an eastern Tennessee wildlife farm presented with persistent weight loss and large vulvar masses. An initial biopsy of the vulvar mass of one of the camels performed by a local veterinarian showed eosinophilic dermatitis. An allergic or parasitic dermatitis was suspected. The two camels were treated with one dose of sodium iodide (66 mg/kg, in 1.0 L of normosolR, IV) and ivermectin 1% (200 ug/kg PO). Upon presentation at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Tennessee, additional biopsies of the masses again revealed eosinophilic dermatitis. Microscopic examination of a Gomori methenamine silver (GMS)-stained section prepared from the biopsy of one of the camels revealed the presence of fungal-like hyphae of a mold which was suspected to be Pythium insidiosum. The vulvar masses were surgically debulked in both animals and sodium iodide and Pythium-immunotherapy prescribed. Pythium insidiosum was isolated in culture and hyphae elements were detected in histological sections confirming the diagnosis of pythiosis in both animals. Despite signs of progressive healing of the vulvar surgical areas, postoperative persistent weight lost in one of the camels suggested the possibility of gastro intestinal (GI) tract pythiosis. This camel died 5 months after the first onset of clinical signs and unfortunately a necropsy was not performed. The other camel responded well to the combination of surgery, iodides, and immunotherapy and has currently rejoined the other members of the herd.\n\nCamel milk: a possible boon for type 1 diabetic patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nAgrawal, R P; Tantia, P; Jain, S; Agrawal, R; Agrawal, V\n\n2013-11-03\n\nPoor nutrition in utero and in early life combined with over nutrition in later life may also play a role in epidemic of diabetes. The efficacy of camel milk consumption as an adjunct to routine diabetic management in type 1 diabetes is a approach showing new rays of hope to cope with this disorder by adding a food supplement with medicinal values. Research on the beneficial aspects of camel milk has been taking place in different corners of globe since last three decades. Continuous efforts to disclose the role of camel milk in diabetes has rendered it title of 'white gold'. Biochemical studies has revealed the components e.g. insulin like protein, lactoferrin, immunoglobulins are responsible for imparting camel milk the scientific weightage. In parallel, epidemiological surveys stating low prevalence of diabetes in communities consuming camel milk clearly indicate towards its hopeful role in maintaining hyperglycemia. This article shades light on camel milk production, composition, characteristics as well as it expresses positive effect of camel milk on blood glucose level, insulin dose, beta cell function. This review also compiles various epidemiological studies carried out to bring forth utility of camel milk suggesting it as a useful food supplement or alternative therapy for type 1 diabetic patients.\n\nCardiac biomarker changes in camels (Camelus dromedarius) secondary to road transportation.\n\nPubMed\n\nTharwat, Mohamed; Al-Sobayil, Fahd; Buczinski, SÃ©bastien\n\n2013-03-01\n\nLittle is known about cardiac biomarkers in camels despite their extensive use as draft animals. This study was designed to establish reference ranges for the cardiac biomarkers cardiac troponin I (cTnI) and creatine kinase myocardial b fraction (CK-MB) in healthy camels and to investigate their changes in response to road transportation. Twenty-five healthy camels transported for a 5 h round-trip journey. None of the camels had evidence of cardiac abnormalities on cardiac auscultation, echocardiography or electrocardiography. Three blood samples were obtained from each camel: 24 h before transportation (T0), within 2 h after unloading (T1) and 24 h after transportation (T2). The mean cTnI concentration in the camels was 0.032 Â± 0.023 ng/mL. All the camels had resting cTnI concentrations of <0.08 ng/mL. At T1, the cTnI concentration was significantly higher (P < 0.001) in all 25 camels compared to values at T0. The CK-MB concentration in the camels was 0.19 Â± 0.05 ng/mL. All the camels had resting CK-MB concentrations of <0.33 ng/mL. At T1, the CK-MB concentration was higher in 3/25 camels compared to values at both T0 and T2. Concerning the hematobiochemical variables, significant increases were detected at T1 in total white blood cells, total protein, globulin, magnesium and phosphorus. Cardiac troponin I, CK-MB and all the hematobiochemical parameters had returned to their pre-transport values at T2. 5 h road transportation might have transient adverse effects on the cardiac muscle of healthy camels.

The length of GIF gene of PCPV obtained from camel is 795âbp and due to the addition of one cytosine residue at position 374 and one adenine residue at position 516, the open reading frame (ORF) got altered, resulting in the production of truncated polypeptide. The ORF of UDG encoding gene of camel PCPV is 696âbp encoding a polypeptide of 26.0âkDa. Comparison of amino acid sequence homologies of GIF and UDG of camel PCPV revealed that the camel PCPV is closer to ORFV and PCPV (reference stains of both human and reindeer), respectively.

This is because of its unique physiological characteristics, including a great tolerance to high temperatures, solar radiation, water scarcity, rough topography and poor vegetation. The average birth weight of camels is about 35kg, but it varies widely between regions, breeds and within the same breed. The meat producing ability of camels is limited by modest growth rates (500g/day). However, camels are mostly produced under traditional extensive systems on poor levels of nutrition and are mostly slaughtered at older ages after a career in work, racing or milk production. Camels reach live weights of about 650kg at 7-8 years of age, and produce carcass weights ranging from 125 to 400kg with dressing-out percentage values from 55% to 70%. Camel carcasses contain about 57% muscle, 26% bone and 17% fat with fore halves (cranial to rib 13) significantly heavier than the hind halves. Camel lean meat contains about 78% water, 19% protein, 3% fat, and 1.2% ash with a small amount of intramuscular fat, which renders it a healthy food for humans. Camel meat has been described as raspberry red to dark brown in colour and the fat of the camel meat is white. Camel meat is similar in taste and texture to beef. The amino acid and mineral contents of camel meat are often higher than beef, probably due to lower intramuscular fat levels. Recently, camel meat has been processed into burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma to add value. Future research efforts need to focus on exploiting the potential of the camel as a source of meat through multidisplinary research into efficient production systems, and improved meat technology and marketing.\n\nStructure and microanalysis of tear film ferning of camel tears, human tears, and Refresh Plus.\n\nPubMed\n\nAm, Masmali; Ra, Fagehi; El-Naggar, Ahmad H; Tm, Almubrad\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThis study aimed to investigate the tear ferning pattern and chemical elements of the tear film of camel tears compared with human tears and Refresh Plus eye lubricant. Refresh Plus was used as a control because it provides a healthy ferning pattern, due to the presence of an optimum ratio of carboxymethylcellulose (CMC) sodium and electrolytes. The main research focus is elucidating the viability of camel tear film in the dry, harsh environment of the desert. The tears were collected from five camels, five male desert workers (20-25 years old) at a small village located 100 km from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, and five male subjects (20-25 years old) from Riyadh. A small drop (1 Î¼l) of tears was dried on a glass slide and observed under a light (Olympus BX1) and scanning electron microscope (Inspect S50, Field Electron and Ion Company [FEI]). Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) of the tear film and Refresh Plus were investigated with a JEOL 1400 scanning transmission electron microscope. The camel tear film pattern was surrounded by thick, peripheral, homogenous layers containing small oily droplets, particles, and tiny branches in the tear ferning. The tear ferning of the camel was grade 0-1, whereas the tear ferning of human tears and Refresh Plus was grade 1-2. The mass percentage of chloride was highest in the camel tears. The mass percentage of potassium in the camel tears was greater than that in the human tears, but it was less than that in the Refresh Plus lubricant. Camel tears exhibit a better quality than human tears and Refresh Plus lubricant do. The presence of oily droplet-like structures at the periphery of tear ferning suggests that camel tear film may have a higher quality and quantity of minerals and lubricants, which may help the animal to avoid eye dryness. Future work is required to investigate the identification of the elements present in the peripheral and central part of the tear ferning.\n\nUltrastructure features of camel cornea--collagen fibril and proteoglycans.\n\nPubMed\n\nAlmubrad, Turki; Akhtar, Saeed\n\n2012-01-01\n\nâ The uniform distribution of collagen fibrils and proteoglycans maintain the transparency of normal cornea. We describe the ultrastructural features of camel cornea including collagen fibrils and proteoglycans (PGs). â Camel corneas (of 6-, 8-, and 10-month-old animals) were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde containing cuprolinic blue in sodium acetate buffer and processed for electron microscopy. The 'AnalySIS LS Professional' program was used to analyze the collagen fibril diameter. â The camel cornea consists of four layers: the epithelium (227âÎ¼m), stroma (388âÎ¼m), Descemet's membrane (DM), and endothelium. The epithelium constituted 36% of the camel cornea, whereas corneal stroma constituted 62% of the corneal thickness (629âÎ¼m). The PGs in the posterior stroma were significantly larger in number and size compared with the anterior and middle stroma. The collagen fibril diameter was 25ânm and interfibrillar spacing 40ânm. Fibrillar structures are present throughout the DM. â The structure of the camel cornea is very different from human and other animals. The unique structure of the cornea might be an adaptation to help the camel to survive in a hot and dry climate. The camel cornea may also be a good model to study the effect of hot and dry climates on the cornea.

Some camel parasites also represent a threat to human health. About 171,500 one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) and 100-300 two-humped camels (Camelus bactrianus) live in Iran. Knowledge of the biodiversity of their parasites is still limited. The present review covers all information about camel parasitic diseases in Iran published as dissertations and in both Iranian and international journals from 1931 to February 2017. Ten genera of Protozoa (Trypanosoma, Eimeria, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, Neospora, Sarcocystis, Besnoitia, Theileria, Babesia and Balantidium), 48 helminth species detected in the digestive system, including three species of Trematoda, four species of Cestoda, and 41 species of Nematoda, as well as helminths from other organs - Echinococcus spp., Dictyocaulus filaria, Thelazia leesei, Dipetalonema evansi and Onchocerca fasciata - have so far been described in Iranian camels. Furthermore, 13 species of hard ticks, mange mites, the myiasis flies Cephalopina titillator and Wohlfahrtia magnifica, and immature stages of the Pentastomida Linguatula serrata have also been reported from camels of Iran. Camel parasitic diseases are a major issue in Iran in terms of economics and public health. The present review offers information for an integrated control programme against economically relevant parasites of camels. Â© A. Sazmand & A.

In different parts of the world, trichostrongylose, mange, nasal myiasis and trypanosomiasis are the most common parasitic diseases found in camels. Hydatic cyst larval stage of E. granulosus is important both economically and in terms of public health. It is also emphasized that the records concerning parasites of the Turkish camel population, which is decreasing significantly, are extremely limited.\n\nCamel heavy chain antibodies against prostate-specific membrane antigen.\n\nPubMed\n\nEvazalipour, Mehdi; Tehrani, Bahram Soltani; Abolhassani, Mohsen; Morovvati, Hamid; Omidfar, Kobra\n\n2012-12-01\n\nProstate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA), a type II integral membrane glycoprotein, is highly overexpressed in all forms of prostate cancer tissues. It has also been demonstrated in a wide range of neovasculature of non-prostatic solid tumors, including bladder, pancreas, lung, kidney, colorectal, and gastric cancers. Given the unique expression of PSMA, it is considered an alluring target for antibody-based imaging and therapy of cancer. In the present study, the production and characterization of camel heavy chain antibodies (HCAbs) specific for the external domain of the PSMA are reported. Due to the absence of the CH1 domain, HCAbs are smaller than their counterparts in conventional antibodies. In this study, camel antibodies were generated through immunization of Camelus dromedarius with a synthetic 28 amino acid peptide corresponding to the external surface domain of antigen and PSMA-expressing cell lines. Different binding properties to protein A and protein G affinity columns were deployed to separate three subclasses of camel IgG. The affinity purified HCAbs bound selectively to the synthetic peptide in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and reacted specifically with PSMA-expressing cell line through immunocytochemistry study. Currently, we are attempting to develop recombinant variable domain of these heavy chain antibodies (VHH or nanobody) for tumor imaging and cancer therapy.\n\nWater restriction and bone metabolism in camels.\n\nPubMed\n\nBen Goumi, M; Robins, S P; De La Farge, F; Coxam, V; Davicco, M J; Barlet, J P\n\n1996-01-01\n\n'Krafft disease', occurring in camels living in the very arid areas of North Africa, is characterized by spontaneous fractures of costal and/or appendicular bones. To better understand the mechanisms of this, we studied the influence of water restriction on plasma and urinary markers of bone metabolism in camels. Eight 2-year-old nonpregnant, nonlactating camels were studied at the research station of LaÃ¢youne (Morocco). After a 10 day period of daily watering, five animals were watered only every 10th day over a 50 day period, then again watered daily for a final 10 day period (rehydration). The three control animals were watered daily throughout the whole experimental period (70 days). Each camel was fed a ration of straw, luceme hay and barley, resulting in a daily intake of 25 g calcium and 11 g phosphorus. Water restriction induced a decrease in daily urinary volume and an increase in plasma osmolality. These symptoms of dehydration were not associated with any significant change either in the markers of osteoblastic activity (plasma alkaline phosphatase activity and osteocalcine concentration) or in the markers of bone resorption (urinary excretion of calcium, hydroxyproline pyridinoline and deoxypyridinoline). Thus, in well-fed camels, water restriction did not affect bone metabolism. However, no conclusions were possible regarding the influence of dehydration or calcium and/or phosphorus deficiency in the etiology of 'Kraft disease'.\n\nPurification and functional characterization of pancreatic insulin from camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nElamin, Babiker A; Al-Maleki, Abdulmajeed; Ismael, Mohammad A; Ayoub, Mohammed Akli\n\n2014-12-01\n\nLarge-scale production of insulin still represents the key step in helping diabetic patients throughout the world. Many species and approaches have been used for the production of insulin. In this study, we purified and characterized for the first time pancreatic insulin from the Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) using a modified acid-alcohol extraction method. After extraction insulin was purified using a one-step gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column leading to a purification yield of 80Â mg/kg (20%) of camel pancreas. The purity of camel insulin was assessed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC using insulin from human, bovine and porcine as standards. Molecular weight was determined for purified camel insulin as 5800 Daltons and its amino acid composition is similar to that known for other species. The functional characterization of purified crude camel insulin was demonstrated in vitro by positive competition by radioimmunoassay and in vivo showing camel insulin inducing acute hypoglycaemia in mice. Together, our study reports for the first time the successful purification of functional insulin from camel pancreas with similar properties compared to other insulin species. This is of great interest given that the camel represents considerable economic worth in many countries.\n\nPurification and functional characterization of pancreatic insulin from camel (Camelus dromedarius)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nElamin, Babiker A.; Al-Maleki, Abdulmajeed; Ismael, Mohammad A.; Ayoub, Mohammed Akli\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLarge-scale production of insulin still represents the key step in helping diabetic patients throughout the world.

The database used for the identification of camel and cow proteins was set from http://www.uniprot.org/. The obtained results showed that, after heating, camel milk at 80Â°C for 60min, camel Î±-lactalbumin (Î±-la) and peptidoglycan recognition protein (PGRP) were not detected while camel serum albumin (CSA) was significantly diminished. When heating cow milk at 80Â°C for 60min, Î±-lactalbumin (Î±-la) and Î²-lactoglobulin (Î²-lg) were not significantly detected. Moreover, 19 protein bands from SDS-PAGE were analyzed and a total of 45 different proteins were identified by LC-MS/MS. Casein fractions were kept intact under a heat treatment of 80Â°C during 60min of both camel and cow milks. Camel and bovine whey proteins were affected by a heat treatment of 80Â°C for 60min.

Fecal samples were collected from 206 camels directly after slaughtering including 25 local camels and 181 imported ones as well as stool specimens were obtained from 50 slaughterhouse workers at the same abattoir. The obtained samples were cultured while Salmonella serovars were identified through Gram's stain films, biochemical tests and serotyping with antisera kit. Moreover, the obtained Salmonella serovars were examined by PCR for the presence of invA and stn genes. The overall prevalence of Salmonella serovars among the examined camels was 8.3%. Stn gene was detected in the vast majority of exotic strains (11/14) 78.6% including emerging serovars such as Salmonella Saintpaul, S. Chester, S. Typhimurium whereas only one isolate from local camels carried stn gene (1/3) 33.3%. On the other hand, none of the examined humans yielded positive result. Our findings highlight the potential role of imported camels as a transboundary vector for exotic emerging Salomenella serovars.\n\nFirst cloned Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) calf produced by interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer: A step towards preserving the critically endangered wild Bactrian camels.\n\nPubMed\n\nWani, Nisar Ahmad; Vettical, Binoy S; Hong, Seung B\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStudies were conducted to explore the possibility of employing dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) oocytes as recipient cytoplasts for the development of interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) embryos using skin fibroblast cells of an adult Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and Llama (Llama glama) as donor nuclei. Also, the embryos reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred into the uterus of synchronized dromedary camel recipients to explore the possibility of using them as surrogate mothers. Serum-starved skin fibroblast cells were injected into the perivitelline space of enucleated mature oocytes, collected from super-stimulated dromedary camels, and fused using an Eppendorf electroporator. After activation with 5Î¼M ionomycin and 6-dimethylaminopurine, they were cultured at 38.5Â°C in an atmosphere of 5% CO2, 5% O2, and 90% N2 in air. In experiment 1, Day 7 blastocysts were stained with Hoechst to count their cell numbers, while in experiment 2, they were transferred to synchronized dromedary recipients. A lower number (P < 0.05) of blastocysts were obtained from reconstructs utilizing fibroblast cells from Llama when compared with those reconstructed with dromedary and Bactrian fibroblast cells. However, no difference was observed in their cell numbers. In experiment 2, a higher (P < 0.05) proportion of blastocysts were obtained from the cleaved embryos reconstructed with Bactrian fibroblast cells when compared to those reconstructed with dromedary cells. Twenty-six Day 7 blastocysts reconstructed with Bactrian cells were transferred to 23 synchronized dromedary recipients with 5 pregnancies established on Day 30, however, only one of the pregnancies developed to term and a healthy calf weighing 33 kgs was born after completing 392 days of gestation. Unfortunately, the calf died on day 7 due to acute septicemia. In conclusion, the present study reports, for the first time, birth of a cloned Bactrian calf by iSCNT using dromedary camel\n\nFirst cloned Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) calf produced by interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer: A step towards preserving the critically endangered wild Bactrian camels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nVettical, Binoy S.; Hong, Seung B.\n\n2017-01-01\n\nStudies were conducted to explore the possibility of employing dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) oocytes as recipient cytoplasts for the development of interspecies somatic cell nuclear transfer (iSCNT) embryos using skin fibroblast cells of an adult Bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and Llama (Llama glama) as donor nuclei.
