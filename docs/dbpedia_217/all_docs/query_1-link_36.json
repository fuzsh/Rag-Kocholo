        "text": "TL;DR\n\nOCI and America’s CF Industries in merger talks\n\nTE Data saga continues\n\nThis week’s agenda: Kerry coming to town, CBE to set interest rates on Thursday\n\nIKEA looks to open second branch\n\nFirst Rafale jets arrive\n\nNew Suez Canal countdown\n\n…AND WE’RE BACK, WITH A SPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT\n\nAs (most of us) return from our extended Eid and the Revolution Day break, we’re exceptionally pleased to inform all of you that Enterprise is welcoming leading real estate developer SODIC as the sponsor of our popular Speed Round section.\n\nThat makes SODIC our second commercial sponsor, after pillar supporter Pharos Holding.\n\nIn addition to having its logo appear at the head of Speed Round, SODIC will use its weekly “Word from SODIC” space to discuss developments in real estate, housing and the economy at large as well as to deliver news the company feels is of particular interest to Enterprise readers, who include chairmen and CEOs of major EGX-listed corporations and startups alike, as well as c-suite executives; domestic, regional and international fund managers; members of the diplomatic community; and others with a deep interest in Egyptian affairs.\n\nThe support of major corporate sponsors including Pharos and SODIC makes it possible not just for us to continue offering Enterprise at no charge to thousands of daily readers in Egypt and far beyond — it will allow us to continue developing as an independent publication. We’ll have more news for you on this front in the days and weeks ahead.\n\nPlease join us in extending a very warm welcome to our friends at SODIC. Thank you for your trust — we’re honored to have you along for the ride.\n\nWHAT WE’RE TRACKING TODAY\n\nWe’re looking forward to the resumption of “business as usual” this week as the business community and the government alike begin the slow, Sa7el-season build-up to what will doubtless be a busy fall season. Among the major issues on which we would expect news this week and next: the Mahlab government is looking to push through key pieces of economic legislation and related regulations before the nation goes to the polls to elect its first House of Representatives under the new constitution. Similarly, we’ll be looking for the latest developments in the CBE’s managed devaluation of the EGP as well as news on energy policy, as many industrial consumers continue to cope with an effective shut-off of natural gas.\n\nWHAT WE’RE TRACKING THIS WEEK\n\nJohn Kerry is due in Cairo for bilateral talks on Tuesday and Wednesday (28-29 July), with SolarTech Egypt due to take place on the same days at the capital city’s JW Marriott Hotel.\n\nThe next meeting of the Central Bank of Egypt’s Monetary Policy Committee is due to be held on Thursday, 30 July — the same day a final verdict is expected in the retrial of former Al Jazeera English journalists Mohamed Fahmy, Baher Mohamed and Peter Greste.\n\nLAST NIGHT’S TALK SHOWS\n\nCBC’s all-star triumvirate of Lamees El Hadidy, Magdy El Galad, and Khairy Ramadan was a no-show on Saturday. Filling in was a doe-eyed gentleman, whom we were unable to identify. (We’ll do better next time if he’s back in the anchor seat, we promise.)\n\nThe first thirty minutes of CBC’s flagship program Lazem Nefham was devoted to covering the upcoming inauguration of the New Suez Canal. CBC’s unknown presenter spoke proudly of the project, giving the impression that he himself had been involved in the dredging process.\n\nAnonymous gentleman: “When our president announced that the project would be completed in less than a year, there were doubts. Foreign media outlets questioned Egypt’s ability to achieve this national goal. They said that the project would fail, that it was mired with engineering challenges that could not be overcome. But due to the grace of God and the leadership of our president, the Egyptian people find themselves 12 days away from achieving this historic goal.”\n\nAfter drawing his sycophantic praise of the New Suez Canal project to a close, the unknown presenter transitioned to a discussion on the thanawiya amma matriculation process (Egyptian high-school exit examination). A recent female graduate called-in to express her disappointment over what she described as an unfair system. “I got a 96.4 percent on my thanawiya amma exam. In spite of my high score, I will be unable to study pharmacy at any of the top universities. Also, I cannot afford to attend a private university. What am I supposed to do?” she asked.\n\nTo the disappointment of Enterprise’s talkshow reviewers, Al Qahera Al Youm will be off until 6 August. We presume that Amr Adeeb will be spending the next 10-12 days on the sunny shores of Egypt’s north coast, wallowing in grief over Zamalek’s 2-0 loss to archrival El Ahly. We’re gonna miss you, Amr.\n\n** READ ENTERPRISE IN ARABIC **\n\nDid you know that Enterprise publishes each morning — Sunday through Thursday — by 8am Sign up herewithout charge, or visit enterprise.press/ar to check out back issues.\n\nSPEED ROUND\n\nCF Industries in talks to merge with some of OCI NV’s businesses: Fertilizer maker CF Industries Holdings Inc. said Monday it was in talks with OCI NV about a potential merger with some of OCI’s businesses, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. Both CF Industries and OCI separately declined to comment at this stage and both said that talks may not necessarily lead to an agreement, according to CF Industries’ press release. CF Industries was established in 1946 as a fertilizer brokerage and is today headquartered in a suburb of Chicago, with a subsidiary operating seven nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing plants in the U.S. and Canada as well as a 50% stake in UK plant nutrients manufacturer GrowHow. The Journal speculates that the agreement could be structured as a so-called ‘inversion’ that would see CF Industries’ so-called “tax headquarters” out of the United States for tax purposes — adding that it would be the largest such transaction since the U.S. Treasury Department imposed new regulations that made such transactions more difficult to pull off.\n\nTop river transport and Nile River police officials placed on administrative leave: Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab has suspended the heads of the River Transport Authority and the top official in charge of policing the nation’s riverways following the Waraaq boat incident on Wednesday, Al Masry Al Youm reported. Families of each of what the Health Ministry now says are the 35 confirmed victims will receive a death benefit of EGP 60,000, Youm7 claims.\n\nAlso sacked: Cairo security chief: Cairo police chief Gen. Osama Bedair was dismissed on Thursday, 16 July, replaced by Gen. Khalid Abdel Aal, according to a statement from the MOI and as reported by AFP. The statement gave no reason for the reshuffle, but the AFP piece points to the spate of recent bombings under Gen. Bedair’s watch. (Read)\n\nThe saga of TE Data continues as the state’s top telecoms regulator announced that it is considering new regulations to curb TE Data’s 70% share of the broadband internet market. The National Telecommunications Regulatory Authority is reportedly in discussions with the company on a package of measures that would include TE Data suspending offers of ultra-high-speed internet access; impose new tariffs payable to the state on promotional offers; and a ban on TE Data signing-up new clients ‘poached’ from other providers who were moved to the ISP when landline numbers were changed, Al Borsa reports. The move comes as multiple new complaints have reportedly been lodged with the Egyptian Competition Authority alleging that that TE Data is engaged in anticompetitive practices, the newspaper adds. TE Data Chief Executive Osama Yaseen denies the 70% market share represents a monopoly. His argument? “Other providers are running smoothly and their clients are not jumping ship.” He also denied that the NRTA was making any regulatory changes governing the market.

The Cairo Festival City store is the first in Africa and only the fourth in the Middle East, after Dubai, Qatar and Oman.\n\nWatch a spectacular flyby of Egypt’s new Rafale fighter jets — or check out a couple of up-close photos. Ahram Online has a bit more here.\n\nWould-be suicide bomber killed near military base last week: The armed forces denied on Wednesday, 15 July, claims made by an Islamic-state affiliated group that it had successfully bombed a military base on the Katameya-Suez road, as reported by Ahram Online. The group had claimed the attack on Twitter, saying that it had resulted in the death of military personnel. The Egyptian Army said the vehicle exploded after service members opened fire on it as it attempted to break through a security checkpoint. The would-be suicide bomber was killed in the explosion.\n\nWanted Egyptian militant urges jihad against President El Sisi -SITE: “An audio message attributed to Hisham al-Ashmawy, who security officials suspect masterminded the recent car bomb assassination of Egypt’s top prosecutor, said the country is ‘overpowered by the new pharaoh Sisi,’” according to Reuters, citing jihadi-monitoring network SITE. Nabil Na’im, a leader of Al-Gamaa Al-Islamiya during the 1990s, said Al-Ashmawy was a former member of the Egyptian Army’s special forces, from which we was sacked in the 2000s, according to Ahram Online. Na’im also went on to state that the audio message is a call for further foreign funding for more attacks.\n\nJustice Minister Zend struck a harsh note in an interview with El Watan, speaking of the historic pre-30 June struggle against the Ikhwan and the ongoing war against the “traitors,” of whom Egypt has “15,000.” Zend dismissed journalists’ concerns about the new terrorism law and penalties — criminal or financial — for journalists who report facts that deviate from the official line in terror cases. He also reaffirmed how a judge should not be compelled to hear from all witnesses in a case before rendering a verdict. Notably, Zend also made clear that Egypt has a witness protection law that he has promoted as a means of encouraging individuals with information about terrorist and other crimes to come forward.\n\n198 alleged members of Ikhwan referred to military prosecutor; Eid Friday demonstrations leave six dead, Morsi calls for his followers to continue the revolution: Six pro-Ikhwan protesters were killed in clashes following demonstrations on Friday, 17 July, according to state news agency MENA and as reported by Ahram Online. A message purportedly smuggled out of prison and allegedly written by former president Mohamed Morsi had circulated online the day before protests took place, calling on his followers to “continue the revolution.” Meanwhile, acting Prosecutor General Ali Omran referred on Wednesday, 15 July,198 alleged members of the Ikhwan to military court for allegedly planning to target police officers and army officers in militant operations, according to Ahram Online, citing a statement from the Prosecutor General’s office.\n\nMorsi trial session postponed, Ikhwan accuse gov’t of attempting to poison ex-president:Mohamed Morsi’s ongoing espionage trial has been postponed to 2 August as Morsi was unable to attend last Wednesday’s trial session due to low blood sugar, Ahram Online reports. The Ikhwan cosplay parliament-in-exile-in-Turkey accused the Sisi administration of trying to poison Morsi and called on the United Nations to intervene, according to UAE-based Gulf News.\n\nNazif gets longer prison term as retrial verdict handed down: An Egyptian court sentenced former prime minister Ahmed Nazif to five years in prison for graft, according to Ahram Online, in a retrial which witnessed a toughening of his sentence, along with an EGP 53 mn fine.\n\nThe World Trade Organization is ready to slash tariffs on 201 technology products including computers, touch-screen devices and machine tools and components — but the measure is just short of the quorum required for it to go into effect. The USD 1.3 tn agreement, covering a whopping 7% of world trade, is expected to boost global economy by USD 190 bn. The trade covered in this agreement is comparable to annual global trade in iron, steel, textiles and clothing combined, and more than world trade in cars, WTO Director General Roberto Azevedo, told Reuters. The agreement, built on the previous Information Technology Agreement (ITA), incorporates popular products invented after 1997, when the last ITA was inked, including GPS, MRI machines, touch screens, microchips, semiconductors and video game consoles among others, reported WSJ. It’s the first major global tariff-cutting pact in 18 years.\n\nInfluential movie director and scenario writer Raafat El Mihi passed away at age 75, Youm7 reported. You’ll remember him from classics including Ghoroub W Shrouk, Samak Laban Tamr Hendi, and the movie that set off Mortada Mansour, El Avocato.\n\nWhy we hate self-driving cars on basic principle, lesson 1: “[I was] a willing subject on whom they could test the car-hacking research they’d been doing over the past year. The result of their work was a hacking technique—what the security industry calls a zero-day exploit—that can target Jeep Cherokees and give the attacker wireless control, via the Internet, to any of thousands of vehicles. Their code is an automaker’s nightmare: software that lets hackers send commands through the Jeep’s entertainment system to its dashboard functions, steering, brakes, and transmission, all from a laptop that may be across the country.” Say the hackers: “When you lose faith that a car will do what you tell it to do … it really changes your whole view of how the thing works.” Read “Hackers Remotely Kill a Jeep on the Highway—With Me in It”\n\nSPOTLIGHT: The countdown to the New Suez Canal begins\n\nA trial run of three large cargo ships became the first convoy to pass through the New Suez Canal ahead of its official opening on 6 August. Suez Canal Authority Chief Mohab Mamish supervised the vessels’ run down the 72 km waterway, Al Mal reports.\n\nHopes are high as we approach the official opening of the new canal, long celebrated as a cornerstone economic project of the Sisi administration. The government is anticipating a tripling of Suez Canal revenues to USD 15 bn per annum as a result of the new canal, while expecting revenues from the Canal’s International Logistic and Industrial Center to comprise 33% of GDP, according to Al Mal.\n\nPromoting project’s success has become a national priority, with EgyptAir changing its logo and offering a 25% discount on all flights for those attending the opening as the Civil Aviation minister ordered refurbishing and upgrades to Cairo International Airport.\n\nMindshare, the advertising wing of the opening ceremony’s organizers WPP Consortium, has called on state-owned and private newspapers to run advertisements for the event without charge, with Al Borsa agreeing and running a full-page coverage of the event in its print edition. Mindshare also released today its first wave of TV ads for the opening ceremony, which you can view here.\n\n***\n\nA MESSAGE FROM PHAROS HOLDING\n\nThe Best of Both Worlds: High Dividend Yield + Potential for Significant Capital Appreciation\n\nAlexandria Container and Cargo Handling (ALCN.CA) FV reported a net profit of EGP 61.8m in June 2015, on top of EGP 775.1m reported in the 11 months ending May 2015. In our latest update on 11M-FY15 results, we had noted that 11M-FY15 results are already way above our full-year projections and that they imply an annualized net income of EGP 840.0m. So far, the firm has only published June 2015 results highlights, and the results are excellent: Throughput, average revenue per container and margins have all exceeded our expectations.\n\nOur take: Alex Containers is trading at an exceptionally low FY15 earnings multiple of 6.5x — and an even lower capitalization rate of c. 5.0x. What’s more, the company typically distributes 55.0% of net income in the form of cash dividends every October. Based on FY15 net income, we expect the firm to distribute cc EGP 18.7/share in cash dividends — which translates into a dividend yield of 8.5% on a holding period of only three months.

While the editorial also mentions the Obama administration in its criticism, characterizing previous foreign aid bills as having serious conditions as the editorial board does here is misleading.\n\nDaylong visit from Uncle Ayman, cancel your plans: Ayman Nour has reinvented himself as an Egyptian Edward Snowden, leaking what he says is inside information to anyone who will humor him, which at this point includes and is limited to the Turkish press. When last we heard from Nour, he said he was leaving Beirut for Turkey before heading to Europe. In his recent sit-down with Turkish newspaper Sabah, it would seem that Nour is settling in to stay in Turkey so he can be in better touch with the other “revolutionary youth” hiding out in Ankara and Istanbul. So why did Nour leave Beirut? He became convinced that the Egyptian regime was trying to assassinate him when it was noticed that a laser light was shining inside his vehicle. By the same logic, it would in retrospect appear that this writer narrowly dodged an assassination attempt himself while on a jog, after having a green laser shined in his eyes by two unkempt youts on a motorcycle.\n\nEgypt arrests press advocate, accuses him of belonging to banned group: Egyptian authorities on Tuesday arrested the head of the independent Electronic Media Syndicate, accusing him of belonging to the Ikhwan, as well as “taking pictures and displaying artistic works without a license,” with regard to photographs he took of the late Prosecutor General Hisham Barakat’s funeral, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists on Wednesday. (Read)\n\nWhy things could get even worse for reporters in Egypt: Ruth Michaelson, writing for the Columbia Journalism Review, who details her experience in being contacted by FactCheckEgypt, a media watchdog affiliated with the State Information Service, regarding Michealson’s reporting. “‘It is our view that journalists’ basic function in any democratic society is to vet government behavior, not the other way around,’ said Sharif Mansour of the Committee to Protect Journalists. ‘The government should focus on fulfilling its role, as prescribed in Egypt’s own constitution, of providing … access to information, instead of intimidating critical and independent reporters.’”\n\nRobert Fisk, again. Robert Fisk sounds the alarm at The Independent, arguing, among other things, that the lack of affordable housing in Egypt is reinforcing Daesh’s position in Egypt, in What a choice for Egypt – a megalomaniac president or the madness of Isis. Along with his analysis he sprinkles in his incredulity that Egypt will be able to complete its announced projects on time or perhaps at all: “… the new two-lane Suez canal which must be finished – and those who know Egypt will literally gasp here – in a maximum of 12 months.” Meanwhile, Egypt successfully tested the expanded waterway on Saturday with six vessels in two fleets of three, according to the AFP, ahead of the Suez Canal Axis inauguration on 6 August, as noted in our special feature above..\n\nEgyptian show that’s flattering to Jews is a surprise hit among Palestinians: The Washington Post reports on the Egyptian Ramadan drama series “The Jewish Quarter” as having captured a 40% share of primetime viewing. Khalid Sukar, the programming director general for Palestinian public TV, is quoted as saying “‘Honestly? For many Palestinians, the Jew is a soldier or settler … That’s it. That’s what our people see. For us, the stereotype is a Jew with a machine gun who occupies us.’ He said The Jewish Quarter offers another perspective, and one that gets closer to the truth of the complex relationship between two peoples.”Meanwhile, Saudi cleric Mohamed Alarafe, who has 12.5 mn followers on Twitter (view his Twitter handle) weighed in on the FJP’s site with his review of the show, which he criticizes for not demonstrating the ‘true nature of Jews’ [insert the usual canards of treachery, hate of Muslims and usury here].

Today, a range of players has embraced terrorism and violence … today’s bloodshed cannot be seen—at least not exclusively—as a direct consequence of domestic adversity and government repression.

Water Resources Minister Hossam Moghazi said Egypt presented two studies, according to SIS: one on the GERD’s impact on Egypt’s water supply and hydropower generation, and another on the performance of the GERD’s spillways, and a recommendation that they be increased to minimize decreased water supply on downstream states. Sudan’s state news agency SUNA says that Sudan and Ethiopia have signed an agreement linking power grids at 500 kV with an eye on future purchase of electricity generated by the GERD, Sudan Tribune reports. Sudan has reportedly faced electricity shortages.\n\nSudan backtracks on promised release of 101 Egyptian fishermen: On Thursday, Sudan had announced it was releasing 101 Egyptian fishermen detained for trespassing in Sudanese territorial waters, only to reverse the decision a day later on Saturday, according to the MFA as reported by Ahram Online. “It was not immediately clear if the men were released and re-arrested, or were not allowed to walk … in the first place,” according to Ahram Online.\n\nPM Mahlab met with a high level French delegation headed by Defense Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian in Cairo, Al Mal reports. According to the cabinet spokesperson, the agenda included a number of national security issues such as further cooperation on combating terrorism and the fight against extremist ideologies. The issue of illegal immigration will be discussed in addition to France’s official attendance of the opening ceremony of the New Suez Canal. France and Egypt are also in talks for the sale of two Gowind-class corvettes, in addition to the four already ordered, according to the AFP.\n\nPM Mahlab traveled to Equatorial Guinea to attend first international conference on Ebola, followed by visit to Italy: Prime Minister Ibrahim Mahlab was in Equatorial Guinea from 20-21 July to attend the first international conference on Ebola, followed by his visit to Italy where he met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi, along with the Italian president and defense minister, according to Youm7 as reported by the Cairo Post.

Riyadh has recently played host to members of the Ikhwan from Gaza, Tunisia, Jordan and Yemen, in what many observers say is a signal that Saudi Arabia is looking to reestablish its role as an Islamist incubator in an attempt to resist Iran. “Despite recent hostilities, Saudi Arabia has an extensive history of using the Brotherhood against its regional rivals. In the 1950s and ’60s the kingdom supported the Brothers as a way to weaken the nationalist republican regime of Egypt’s Gamal Abdel Nasser. Although banned from political activity in Saudi Arabia, Brotherhood members were active in academia and had substantial influence in the kingdom’s secondary schools and universities.” (Read)\n\nENERGY\n\nEni makes 15 bcm gas discovery in Nile Delta\n\nEni Press Release, Al Borsa | 20 July 2015\n\nEni announced on Monday a gas discovery in its Abu Madi West license, an area in the Nile Delta 120 km north-east of Alexandria.

The ceiling, which the article notes that Netanyahu worked to get in place just as recently as 2013, currently limits exports to 40% of Israel’s gas reserves. His government’s recently proposed amendments to Israel’s export law includes a provision that would redefine what constitutes Israel’s domestic share by changing it from proven reserves to expected, which would speed up exports, as well as another amendment that would allow for more gas exports from the Tamar gasfield before Leviathan comes online.
