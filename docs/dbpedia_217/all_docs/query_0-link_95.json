        "text": "A guide for support and service providers for new arrivals in Egypt: The most important advice and guidance on the law, residence and movement\n\nOn April 15, conflict broke out between the army and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Sudan. Civilians became unsafe in light of the repercussions on various sectors echoing shortages in health services, water, food, medicine, as well as energy resources such as electricity and fuel. The constant instability and interruption of Internet services affected communication and the banking sector as well.\n\nIn consequence, people in Sudan started fleeing towards neighboring countries on a journey fraught with great dangers. In Egypt alone, 16,000 people have arrived according to the Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman. There are others waiting on the Sudanese side to cross in search of a safe haven.\n\nRPE team has prepared this guide, which contains:\n\n1- Data of support and service providers for people upon their crossing to Egypt. This data is based on direct sources through Sudanese community leaders and self-organized support groups within immigrant communities in Egypt, and data sent to us through the form “I provide a service” on the “Refugee Platform in Egypt” website.\n\n2- In addition to tips and instructions on movement, law and protection prepared by the platform team.\n\n* The information in this guide is updated as of April 30, 2023.\n\nHealth services upon arrival in Aswan\n\nThe Egyptian Red Crescent Relief Center at the Arqin border crossing, Qastal, Karkar station and Abu Simbel hospital provides: health services / psychological support/medicines/snacks/means of communication: Phone: +20 01153772211-+20 01153881199 – +20 01153994455- +20 01153991133\n\nAswan University Hospital provides comprehensive health services and emergency care at nominal costs.\n\nAvailable 24 hours to contact Tel: 0972428625.\n\nLocation: Qasr El-Haggar Street, Aswan Beginning, Egypt The site of the University Hospital in Aswan\n\nRed Crescent Hospital, Aswan: Provides comprehensive health care at nominal costs\n\nTel: +20 01203426415\n\nLocation: Red Crescent Hospital, Aswan\n\nAl-Ramad Hospital in Aswan provides special eye care at nominal costs\n\nTel: 0972454025\n\nLocation: Ophthalmology Hospital site in Aswan\n\nAl-Masala Hospital provides a variety of medical care at private sector prices\n\nTel: 0972302523\n\nLocation: El-Masala Hospital\n\nNew Friendship Hospital with nominal costs\n\nTel: 0972240594\n\nLocation: Friendship Hospital\n\nEvangelical Mission Hospital: 23 Corniche El Nil – Corniche – Aswan Governorate\n\nTel: 0972317176 – 0972302176 – +20 01221385685 – 0972322176\n\nNasr El Nuba Central Hospital: Nasr El Nuba, Aswan,\n\nTel: 0972850003\n\nThe Egyptian Ministry of Health also announced in a statement on April 28, 2023 that all medical services will be provided to the returnees and the displaced through the Arqin and Qastal crossings, and that they will conduct an apparent medical examination for the crossings and follow up with them for a period of two weeks from the date of crossing and increase the mobile clinics at the crossings to 10 clinics to detect any infectious diseases.
