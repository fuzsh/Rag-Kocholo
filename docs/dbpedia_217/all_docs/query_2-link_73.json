        "text": "LONDON: The World Cup is underway, and the hopes of football-mad Arab nations are rising. Many eyes are on Mohamed Salah, star of the Egyptian team and of the English Premier League, to elevate the reputation of Arab footballers.\n\nAt Liverpool, the 25-year-old is adored. But he is not the first Egyptian that British football fans have taken to their hearts.\n\nLong, long before Mo, there was Mustafa Mansour and Mohamed Latif in the 1930s and before them, there was Hussein Hegazi and Tewfik Abdullah. All were Egyptians footballers who brought their dazzling skills to British clubs.\n\nOne was a striker who had poems written about him; one graced the cover of the top football magazine of the time; one was a goalkeeper regarded as a trailblazer for African football who later served as a government minister, and one played for Glasgow Rangers and went on to become his country’s top football commentator.\n\nHussein Hegazi\n\nHegazi was the first. Born into a wealthy aristocratic Cairo family in 1891, he honed his footballing skills by playing against British soldiers and by the time he arrived in England in 1911 to study engineering at University College, London, he was already known in Egypt as a prolific goal scorer, notching up 57 in one season. He was also a top-class runner, winning the national championships in the quarter-mile and half-mile (equivalent to today’s 400 meters and 800 meters) four years in a row.\n\nHow he came to the attention of Dulwich Hamlet FC, a well-established non-league club in South London is unclear but he made his debut with them on Sept. 23, 1911, to great acclaim. With his wiry build (he weighed only 60 kg), he was described as having “a lightning drive.”\n\nA match report in the local newspaper, the “South London Press,” said: “The Egyptian gave a splendid exhibition… simply conjured with the ball.” Another report from Oct. 13 called him “the thinking man’s footballer.”\n\nThe fans loved him as much as the pundits and promptly nicknamed him Nebuchadnezzar.\n\nIt was not long before a much bigger club noticed him. Fulham, then in the Second Division (today’s Championship), were eager to sign him up, especially after Hegazi scored in his try-out for them against Stockport County on Nov. 11.\n\nAlarmed at the prospect of losing him, Dulwich Hamlet manager Pa Wilson turned up at Hegazi’s lodgings. After listening to Wilson’s pleadings, Hegazi felt honor-bound to stay at Dulwich.\n\n“I was in a difficulty for I wanted to play very much in league football and at the same time I did not want to leave Dulwich Hamlet, who have been very good to me,” he said. Wilson called Hegazi “as honorable a man as ever stepped on to a football field” and a writer for the “Athletic News” was moved to write a five-verse poem in tribute.\n\nHegazi did two European tours with Dulwich Hamlet and also played for the London county team. In 1913, he embarked on studies at Cambridge University but left before the end of his first year, though not before winning a Blue with the university football team. He played for the national Egyptian team in the 1920 and 1924 Olympics and finally hung up his boots in 1932, aged 40. He died in 1958. A street in the Garden City area of Cairo is named after him.\n\nTewfik Abdullah\n\nTewfik Abdullah (sometimes spelled Tawfik Abdallah), the second Egyptian to play in Britain, was encouraged by his friendship with Tommy Barbour, a Scottish soldier in the British army serving in Egypt who also played fullback for Derby County.\n\nBorn in Cairo in June 1896, Abdullah, a midfielder, began his career with Cairo club, El-Mokhtalat, and played for the national team at the 1920 Olympics. He also played against the British army, where he met Barbour.\n\nAbdullah made his English league debut in October 1920 against Manchester City and was instantly nicknamed “Toothpick.”\n\nOne possibly apocryphal tale about his first game relates that he came out on to the pitch asking, “Where’s me camel?” It transpired he was, in fact, asking, “Where’s Mick Hamill?” the City player he had been assigned to mark.\n\nAbdullah scored in the match, which Derby won 3-0. The following month, he was on the cover of the magazine “Topical Times,” with the pyramids and the Sphinx in the background, as part of a feature on the fashion for recruiting players “from far afield.”\n\nIn 15 appearances for Derby County, Abdullah never scored again and in 1922 he joined Scottish Second Division side, Cowdenbeath, where he was nicknamed “Abe” and was awarded the ultimate accolade when a local leading miner named one of his racing greyhounds Abe in his honor.\n\nBeset by injury, Abdullah only stayed one season in Scotland. In 1923, he joined Welsh non-league Bridgend Town and a year later he was back in the league with Hartlepool, in the northeast of England. He made 11 appearances, scored once and at the end of the 1924 season crossed the Atlantic to join the exotically named Providence Clamdiggers.\n\nHe played for four more teams in the US and went on to coach, but America’s racial segregation laws — which meant he was often not allowed to stay in the same hotels as his white colleagues — dismayed him. He returned to Egypt in the late 1920s for a year but crossed the Atlantic again to join Canadian side Montreal Carsteel, spending the rest of his playing career there.\n\nAfter retiring he managed Farouk Club (an old name for Zamalek) and in 1940 became manager of the Egyptian national team, taking them to the 1952 Olympics in Helsinki, Finland.\n\nMore than a decade passed before an Egyptian again donned football boots for a British side — and then came a pair of them.\n\nGoalkeeper Mustafa Kamel Mansour and winger Mohammad Latif were in Egypt’s 1934 World Cup squad, which was coached by Scotsman James McCrea.\n\nMustafa Kamel Mansour\n\nMansour, born in Alexandria in August 1914, began his club career with Al-Ahly. Latif, five years older, played for El-Mokhtalat, (another of Zamalek’s past names). Encouraged by their mentor, McCrae, they arrived in Scotland in 1935 and enrolled at Jordanhill College to train as physical education teachers.\n\nThe Glasgow Rangers wanted them both but Mansour instead chose to join Queen’s Park, Scotland’s oldest club and also the only amateur team in the Scottish professional league. He even turned down the huge sum of £5,000 — equivalent to around £340,000 ($455,000 or SR1.7million) today — to turn professional.\n\n“It was a record at the time but I did not want to play for money,” said Mansour in a BBC interview in 2002. How times have changed.\n\nHe spent two seasons at Queen’s Park, where he was affectionately known as Tuffy, and played in almost 50 league matches and eight Cup ties. He was also a popular adult member of the 72nd Glasgow Scout Troop.\n\nMansour returned to Egypt when war broke out in 1939, but his footballing career was far from over. After his playing days ended, he qualified as an international referee and then managed his old club, Al-Ahly. He was a top-ranking figure in Egyptian football and from 1958-61 he was secretary-general of the Confederation of African Football. He also served as a minister in the Egyptian government.\n\nHe died in 2002, a few weeks after the interview with the BBC and a month before his 88th birthday.\n\nMohammad Latif\n\nFive years older than his compatriot, Mohammad Latif was from Beni Suef, south of Cairo, and by his early 20s, he was one of the best footballers in the country. His three goals against a British mandate football team during qualification rounds secured both Egypt’s place in the 1934 World Cup and Latif’s place in the squad.\n\nThe first non-white to play for Glasgow Rangers made his first team debut on Sept. 14, 1935, the same day that Hitler addressed 54,000 people at a mass rally in Nuremberg, announcing laws against non-whites.\n\nUnfortunately, Latif’s Rangers career did not progress well. His playing was described as “impetuous” and after that first outing, he was left out of the first team for seven months. His next game was also his last and he returned to Egypt to prepare for the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. He and Mansour both made the squad.\n\nLatif rejoined El-Mokhtalat and continued playing for them until 1945. He moved into coaching and also attained international standard as a referee, before embarking on yet another successful career as a football commentator, achieving fame not only in Egypt but throughout the Arab world as “the sheikh of commentators.”\n\nMohammed Salah may have the fame and, with a reported salary of £200,000 (SR1 million) per week, he certainly has the fortune.\n\nThe names of Hegazi, Abdullah, Mansour and Latif may not echo so resoundingly through the annals of footballing history. But they were pathfinders and admirable ambassadors for Arab sportsmen. And that is a hard act to follow.\n\nSURREY: US golfer Peter Uihlein triumphed in the International Series England on Sunday to register his maiden victory on the Asian Tour and The International Series, pulling away impressively from a packed leaderboard.\n\nThe American stole the show on the Longcross course at Foxhills Golf Club, carding a scorching bogey-free eight-under-par 63 for a four-round total of 20-under. This gave him a seven-shot victory over England’s Andy Sullivan, who shot a 66, and fellow American Caleb Surratt, who shot a 68.\n\nChina’s Sampson Zheng (66), Sadom Kaewkanjana (67) from Thailand, and Harold Varner III (70) from the US tied for fourth, one stroke further back.\n\nUihlein, aged 34, smashed the course record with a 61 to take the lead at the halfway mark and began the day with a one-shot advantage over Varner. By the turn Uihlein had a one-shot lead over Surratt, playing in the group ahead.\n\nUihlein then proceeded to eagle the par-four 10th to move three ahead, putting some daylight between him and the chasing pack. A birdie on the 12th saw him maintain his three-shot lead after Surratt had birdied the same hole.\n\nUihlein then survived a couple of shaky holes, holing a crucial par putt from seven feet on the par-four 13th. On the ensuing hole, a par-five, he found the trees on the right with his tee shot but played a miraculous recovery shot. His ball found a bad lie, entangled in tree branches, but he was able to chip back into the fairway and hit his third to 12 feet, which he just missed for a birdie.\n\nOn the treacherous par-three 16th, where a tough pin position on the right brought a greenside lake dangerously into play, he holed a 15-footer for a birdie to virtually wrap up the title. The look of relief on his face was tangible as his ball would have rushed past the cup if it had not dropped.\n\nIt meant he had a four-shot lead from Surratt, which became five when Surratt made a bogey on hole 17. It became six when Uihlein holed a 12-footer for a birdie at the same hole, and a magnificent seven when he birdied the par-five 18th.\n\n“Bit of a dream, really,” said Uihlein, who plays for RangeGoats GC on LIV Golf.\n\n“I mean, I was two over par through eight holes on the first day. I tripled 17 and it was a bit of a grind that day, and then the next day I just kind of blitzed it, and yesterday kind of survived. And today, obviously, I kind of had some things going my way, no doubt about it. So just kind of one of those days where things were going my way, and I took advantage of it. So, I’m happy to be here.”\n\nSurprisingly, this is only Uihlein’s fourth win since he turned professional in 2013. He has won once before on the DP World Tour and twice on the Korn Ferry Tour, while on the LIV Golf League he has come close to winning on multiple occasions, having finished second four times.\n\nHe earned a cheque for US$360,000 and moves into third on The International Series Rankings, currently still led by American John Catlin.\n\nThe golf course, located in Surrey, played a big part in his success.\n\nHe said: “I loved it. You were allowed to try different things. You could play it different ways. I obviously was very aggressive and tried to kind of drive to a lot of greens, and, you know, it paid off. There are obviously other ways guys probably played it, but I liked the strategy we had. I like the game plan we were doing, and I had fun doing it.”\n\nBoth Sullivan and Surratt, playing together, missed makeable birdie putts on the last to snatch second place outright.\n\nEarlier in the day Indonesian Jonathan Wijono stormed through with a 64 and eventually ended in ninth place, 11 behind the champion.\n\nThis week’s $2m tournament is the ninth event of the year on the Asian Tour and the fourth stop on The International Series.\n\nThe Asian Tour now has a two-week break before the Mandiri Indonesia Open. The $500,000 event will be played at Damai Indah Golf (PIK Course) from Aug. 29-Sept. 1. Thailand’s Nitithorn Thippong, whose strong performance this week finished in a tie for 13th, is the defending champion.\n\nPARIS: From a colorful, sometimes controversial opening ceremony to boxers caught up in a gender row to respectful bows on the gymnastics podium, the 2024 Olympics served up many memorable moments.\n\nAFP Sport looks at 10 of the best:\n\n-- Organizers promised a spectacular opening ceremony and the rain-soaked boat parade on the River Seine ended up making global headlines, but not for the expected reasons.\n\nChurch leaders, conservatives, and even US presidential candidate Donald Trump were left outraged by a scene involving drag queens and lesbian DJ Barbara Butch that appeared to parody Jesus’s Last Supper.\n\nArtistic director Thomas Jolly denied any such intention. He and others involved ended up facing vicious online harassment that led to police complaints.\n\n-- Novak Djokovic stunned Carlos Alcaraz in a memorable men’s final to clinch tennis gold and become only the fifth player to complete the Golden Slam of all four majors plus Olympic gold.\n\nThe 37-year-old celebrated with a roar that echoed around Roland Garros before the tearful Serb clambered into the player’s box to embrace his wife Jelena and two children.\n\n“There is no greater inspiration than representing your country,” said the 24-time Grand Slam title winner.\n\nAlcaraz was also in tears, claiming he “had let Spain down.”\n\n-- Simone Biles may have been the star of the show but she was widely praised for bowing to her arch-rival Rebeca Andrade on the podium.\n\nBiles said it was “just the right thing to do” after she and team-mate Jordan Chiles finished in silver and bronze medal position respectively behind the Brazilian in the floor final.\n\n“Rebeca’s so amazing, she’s queen,” said Biles.\n\nRomanian Ana Barbosu was later awarded the bronze medal after the Court of Arbitration for Sport ruled that Chiles should not have been upgraded from her initial fifth-place finish.\n\n-- World champion Noah Lyles roared to victory in 9.79sec to claim gold in a dramatic men’s Olympic 100m final in the closest finish in modern history — just five thousandths of a second separated him from Jamaica’s Kishane Thompson.\n\n“I’m the man among all of them. I’m the wolf among wolves,” said Lyles whose victory was only confirmed after a photo-finish.\n\n-- Pakistan’s Arshad Nadeem won the men’s javelin title, his country’s first individual gold at an Olympics, with a Games record of 92.97m.\n\nIn second place was India’s defending champion Neeraj Chopra.\n\n“Rivalry is there when it comes to cricket matches, other sports, the two countries have a rivalry, but it’s a good thing for the young people in both countries to watch our sport and follow us.
