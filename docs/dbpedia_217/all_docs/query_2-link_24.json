Then check out on the highlights in the article here: https://ow.ly/xSsp50QivnZ\n\nAs we gear up for our 2024 #BICSI Winter Conference, we wanted to share another tip to make the most of BICSI #Conferences! This time, we're covering a few suggestions on how to truly soak in the variety of #presentations available to you at BICSI #events. 1) Be ready to take notes (your conference program includes notes pages for you to jot down ideas!) 2) Attend sessions on a variety of topics to help you build a well-rounded knowledge base. 3) Come prepared to ask questions! Don't be afraid to pick the brain of the presenter. and 4) Be prepared to engage in discussions - your perspective could be helpful to someone else and doing so will help you retain the information longer. We hope to see you putting these ideas to work at the 2024 BICSI Winter Conference! https://lnkd.in/ewr5vDp5"
