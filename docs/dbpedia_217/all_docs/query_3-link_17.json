The famous Mohameds below have many different professions, including notable actors named Mohamed, famous athletes named Mohamed, singers named Mohammed and even political figures named Mohamed.\n\nMohamed Farah is certainly one of the most famous Mohameds on this list. One of the famous athletes named Mohamed, he is a British long-distance runner. He won gold medals at the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games. You will also recognize Muhammad Ali.

He was the last Shah of Iran. He reigned from 1941 until 1979.\n\nDid we forget one of your favorite famous people named Mohammed? Just add them to the list!\n\nMuhammad (Arabic: مُحمّد‎, pronounced [muħammad]; c. 570 CE – 8 June 632 CE) was an Arab religious, social and political leader and the founder of Islam. According to Islamic doctrine, he was a prophet, sent to present and confirm the monotheistic teachings preached previously by Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. He is viewed as the final prophet of God in all the main branches of Islam, though some modern denominations diverge from this belief. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity, with the Quran as well as his teachings and practices forming the basis of Islamic religious belief. He is referred to by many appellations, including Messenger of Allah, The Prophet Muhammad, Allah's Apostle, Last Prophet of Islam and others; there are also many variant spellings of Muhammad, such as Mohamet, Mahamad, Muhamad and many others. Born approximately 570 CE (Year of the Elephant) in the Arabian city of Mecca, Muhammad was orphaned at the age of six. He was raised under the care of his paternal grandfather Abd al-Muttalib, and upon his death, by his uncle Abu Talib. In later years he would periodically seclude himself in a mountain cave named Hira for several nights of prayer. When he was 40, Muhammad reported being visited by Gabriel in the cave, and receiving his first revelation from God. Three years later, in 610, Muhammad started preaching these revelations publicly, proclaiming that \"God is One\", that complete \"submission\" (islām) to God is the right way of life (dīn), and that he was a prophet and messenger of God, similar to the other prophets in Islam.The followers of Muhammad were initially few in number, and experienced hostility from Meccan polytheists. He sent some of his followers to Abyssinia in 615 to shield them from prosecution, before he and his followers migrated from Mecca to Medina (then known as Yathrib) in 622. This event, the Hijra, marks the beginning of the Islamic calendar, also known as the Hijri Calendar. In Medina, Muhammad united the tribes under the Constitution of Medina. In December 629, after eight years of intermittent fighting with Meccan tribes, Muhammad gathered an army of 10,000 Muslim converts and marched on the city of Mecca. The conquest went largely uncontested and Muhammad seized the city with little bloodshed. In 632, a few months after returning from the Farewell Pilgrimage, he fell ill and died. By the time of his death, most of the Arabian Peninsula had converted to Islam.The revelations (each known as Ayah, lit. \"Sign [of God]\") which Muhammad reported receiving until his death form the verses of the Quran, regarded by Muslims as the verbatim \"Word of God\" and around which the religion is based. Besides the Quran, Muhammad's teachings and practices (sunnah), found in the Hadith and sira (biography) literature, are also upheld and used as sources of Islamic law (see Sharia).\n\nBirthplace : Louisville, Kentucky, USA\n\nMuhammad Ali, born Cassius Marcellus Clay Jr. on January 17, 1942, in Louisville Kentucky, was a globally recognized boxing legend and social activist. His extraordinary journey began at the tender age of 12 when, after his bicycle was stolen, he vowed to \"whup\" the thief. This incident led him to a local police officer who introduced him to boxing. What followed was a meteoric rise in the amateur boxing circuit, culminating in a gold medal win at the 1960 Rome Olympics. Ali's professional career was as remarkable as his amateur one. He won the world heavyweight championship three times, first in 1964 against Sonny Liston, then in 1974 against George Foreman, and finally in 1978 against Leon Spinks. Renowned for his unorthodox fighting style, which he described as \"float like a butterfly, sting like a bee,\" Ali was known for his quick feet and ability to avoid a punch. His larger-than-life persona both inside and outside the ring, coupled with his poetic and often provocative rhetoric, made him an unforgettable icon in the world of sports. Apart from his boxing prowess, Ali was also a prominent figure in the civil rights movement. He converted to Islam in 1964, changed his name from Cassius Clay, which he called his \"slave name\", to Muhammad Ali and used his global platform to speak out against racial injustice. His refusal to be drafted into the Vietnam War on religious grounds led to a legal battle that went all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court, where he was eventually vindicated. Ali's impact extended beyond the boxing ring, leaving an indelible mark on society. His life serves as a testament to courage, conviction, and the relentless pursuit of greatness.\n\n3\n\nMohamed Hadid\n\n11/06/1948\n\nBirthplace : Israel\n\nMohamed Anwar Hadid (born 6 November 1948) is a Jordanian-American real estate developer of Palestinian origin.
