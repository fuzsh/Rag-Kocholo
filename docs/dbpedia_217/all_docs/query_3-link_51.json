        "text": "In this study, which presents the situation of young people in Jordan in 2021, authors Mohammed Abu Rumman and Walid Khatib focus on the religious orientation of youth and their social values. Young Jordanians have become more religious, while considering religion a personal matter at the same time. The analysis of young peopleâ€™s positions about democracy and Jordanian policies shows that there is a low level of trust in representative institutions which has led to a loss of interest in politics and subsequently a turn towards traditional institutions such as the family or tribe. At the same time, the study reveals a growing awareness of and sense of civic duty regarding climate change among Jordanian youth. The study is based on the results of the regional FES MENA Youth Study for which 1,000 young men and women were interviewed in twelve countries."
