        "text": "The Islamic state that was formed in 2006 in territories outside the control of two war-torn countries, with the capture of the city of Mosul in 2014 was world famous and be of interest to all news circles across the globe. This state used extremely cruel methods in relation to its prisoners of war, which is not a venue to discuss in this paper, came more than ever to fill the headlines of newspapers and online media. After a period of relative silence news, now with fighting to retake the city of Mosul, the \"Islamic state\" is once again under the focus of the news circles. This paper intends to review primarily on the formation of the \"Islamic State\" and introduce a summary of the main factors involved in forming this state with a slightly different perspective than the views have been described earlier.\n\nThe “rebirth” of the Islamic state after its fall in 1924 CE, both in ‘symbolic and practical terms’ is the ‘story of fall and rise’ (not narrated but) discussed and analyzed, historically, in this book by Feldman—from the Prophetic to the Ottoman periods, and from the final decades of the twentieth century to the recent so-called “Arab Spring”. This book is an insightful work with many original and fresh ideas and arguments about the rebirth and rise of the Islamic state in the modern Muslim world which has gained momentum after the “Arab Spring”.\n\nAlthough a lot has been said about the Islamic State (IS) since its proclamation in 2014, very little is known about the terrorist group’s internal dynamics. In spite of what is usually acknowledged, there is more to IS than its violence, and the instauration of a very organized network of governance accompanies its expansion, to the point that IS’ leaders are worried about both expanding and governing. The organization has a utopian project: to become a territorial reality and establish a new “Islamic” society.\n\nThe emergence of the Islamic State (ISIS), a fundamentalist-terrorist organization that tends to reshape the Middle East state system, has shocked the international community and all humanity. The jihadists in Iraq and Syria that proclaimed a caliphate in June 2014 in the areas they have captured are posing a major threat to the regional state system as it was shaped with the secret Sykes–Picot agreements between France and Britain in 1916. The main argument in this paper is that the actions of the jihadists of ISIS will provoke important redistributions of power in the Middle East, resulting in major changes not only as regards the strategies of the main actors in the Middle East, but also for the Great Powers. The analysis in this paper lies in the realist school of thought in international politics. Therefore, it seeks to explain to what extent the emergence of ISIS provoked redefinition of threats and interests in the Middle East so that states and non-state actors were forced to cooperate in the light of a greater evil. In this article we also examine competing regional strategies of the Great Powers in the Middle East that we believe contributed to the ascent of ISIS. For example, the strategic inaction or cooperation of the Great Powers in Syria, because of the divergent interests of Russia and U.S., resulted in the empowerment of the jihadists. However, political realism alone cannot totally explain the emergence of ISIS, since other fields of the social sciences, such as the psychology, beliefs, and ideology of ISIS members are interconnected with the whole issue. This paper explores these important issues in order to shed light on the rise of Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East. Before getting to our main analysis, though, we must detect the origins of the Islamic State."
