        "text": "Identification of macroscopic sarcocysts of Sarcocystis cameli from camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Iraq\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThere is considerable confusion concerning the identity of macroscopic Sarcocystis species in camels. Currently two species: Sarcocystis cameli, and S. ippeni are recognized from one humped camel (Camelus dromedarius), and sarcocysts of both species are microscopic. Here, we report identity of macro...\n\nIsolation and molecular characterization of partial FSH and LH receptor genes in Arabian camels (Camelus dromedarius)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJelokhani-Niaraki, Saber; Tahmoorespur, Mojtaba; Bitaraf-Sani, Morteza\n\n2015-01-01\n\nVery little is known about LHR and FSHR genes of domestic dromedary camels. The main objective of this study was to determine and analyze partial genomic regions of FSHR and LHR genes in dromedary camels for the first time. To this end, a total of50 DNA samples belonging to dromedary camels raised in Iran were sent for sequencing (25 samples of each gene). We compared the nucleotide sequences of Camelus dromedarius with corresponding sequences of previously published FSHR and LHR genes in bactrian camels and other species. According to the data, the same nucleotide variation was identified in both regions of the two camel species. The alignment of deduced protein sequences of the two different species revealed an amino acid variation at the FSHR region. No evidence of amino acid variation was observed, however, in LHR sequences. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that both camel species had a close relationship and clustered together in a separate branch. This was further confirmed by genetic distance values illustrating significant sequence identity between Camelus dromedarius and Camelus bactrianus. Interestingly, sequence comparisons revealed heterozygote patterns in FSHR sequences isolated from dromedary camels of Iran. In comparison to other species, this camel contains three amino acid substitutions at 5, 67, and 105 positions in the FSHR coding region. These positions are found exclusively in camels and can be considered as species specific. The results of our study can be used for hormone functionality research (FSHR and LHR) as well as reproduction-linked polymorphisms and breeding programs.

Images of the liver were obtained from the 11th to 5th intercostal spaces (ICSs). The distance between the dorsal liver margin and the midline of the back was shortest (39.1 Â± 7.4 cm) at the 11th ICS and increased cranially to 5th ICS. The size of the liver was largest at the 9th ICS and smallest at the 5th ICS. In 6 camels the right kidney was visualized from the 10th and 11th ICSs and upper right flank and in the 10th and 11th ICSs in the remaining 16 camels. In all camels, the left kidney was imaged from the caudal left flank. In 21 camels, the differentiation between the renal cortex and medulla was clearly visible in the ultrasonograms. Ultrasonographic description of the liver and kidneys provides a basic reference for diagnosing hepatic and renal disorders in camels.\n\nVulvar pythiosis in two captive camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nVidela, Ricardo; van Amstel, Sarel; O'neill, Sarah H; Frank, Linda A; Newman, Shelley J; Vilela, Raquel; Mendoza, Leonel\n\n2012-02-01\n\nTwo camels (Camelus dromedarius), 3- and 4-years-old, respectively, from an eastern Tennessee wildlife farm presented with persistent weight loss and large vulvar masses. An initial biopsy of the vulvar mass of one of the camels performed by a local veterinarian showed eosinophilic dermatitis. An allergic or parasitic dermatitis was suspected. The two camels were treated with one dose of sodium iodide (66 mg/kg, in 1.0 L of normosolR, IV) and ivermectin 1% (200 ug/kg PO). Upon presentation at the Veterinary Teaching Hospital, University of Tennessee, additional biopsies of the masses again revealed eosinophilic dermatitis. Microscopic examination of a Gomori methenamine silver (GMS)-stained section prepared from the biopsy of one of the camels revealed the presence of fungal-like hyphae of a mold which was suspected to be Pythium insidiosum. The vulvar masses were surgically debulked in both animals and sodium iodide and Pythium-immunotherapy prescribed. Pythium insidiosum was isolated in culture and hyphae elements were detected in histological sections confirming the diagnosis of pythiosis in both animals. Despite signs of progressive healing of the vulvar surgical areas, postoperative persistent weight lost in one of the camels suggested the possibility of gastro intestinal (GI) tract pythiosis. This camel died 5 months after the first onset of clinical signs and unfortunately a necropsy was not performed. The other camel responded well to the combination of surgery, iodides, and immunotherapy and has currently rejoined the other members of the herd.\n\nUltrasonography of the liver and kidneys of healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTharwat, Mohamed; Al-Sobayil, Fahd; Ali, Ahmed; Buczinski, SÃ©bastien\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study describes the ultrasonography of the liver and kidneys of healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius).

Seventy camels with confirmed Johne's disease were examined by ultrasonography and subsequent necropsy; 15 healthy camels were included as controls. The most outstanding findings were visible enlargement of the mesenteric lymph nodes in 52 (74%) camels. Lesions had either echogenic (26%; n = 18) or anechoic (69%; n = 48) capsule and the contents were either anechoic (21%; n = 15), echogenic (27%; n = 19), or heterogeneous (46%; n = 32). Clumps of echogenic tissue interspersed with fluid pockets were imaged between the intestinal loops in 9 (13%) camels. There was mild, moderate, or severe thickening and corrugation of the intestinal wall, excessive anechoic fluid in the abdominal cavity in 18 (26%) camels, increased hepatic brightness in 30 (43%) camels, and pericardial and pleural effusions in 22 (31%) camels. Sensitivity values for detecting intestinal lesions and enlarged mesenteric lymph nodes were 95% and 84%, respectively.\n\nPurification and functional characterization of pancreatic insulin from camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nElamin, Babiker A; Al-Maleki, Abdulmajeed; Ismael, Mohammad A; Ayoub, Mohammed Akli\n\n2014-12-01\n\nLarge-scale production of insulin still represents the key step in helping diabetic patients throughout the world. Many species and approaches have been used for the production of insulin. In this study, we purified and characterized for the first time pancreatic insulin from the Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) using a modified acid-alcohol extraction method. After extraction insulin was purified using a one-step gel filtration on a Sephadex G-50 column leading to a purification yield of 80Â mg/kg (20%) of camel pancreas. The purity of camel insulin was assessed by SDS-PAGE and HPLC using insulin from human, bovine and porcine as standards. Molecular weight was determined for purified camel insulin as 5800 Daltons and its amino acid composition is similar to that known for other species. The functional characterization of purified crude camel insulin was demonstrated in vitro by positive competition by radioimmunoassay and in vivo showing camel insulin inducing acute hypoglycaemia in mice. Together, our study reports for the first time the successful purification of functional insulin from camel pancreas with similar properties compared to other insulin species. This is of great interest given that the camel represents considerable economic worth in many countries.\n\nPurification and functional characterization of pancreatic insulin from camel (Camelus dromedarius)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nElamin, Babiker A.; Al-Maleki, Abdulmajeed; Ismael, Mohammad A.; Ayoub, Mohammed Akli\n\n2014-01-01\n\nLarge-scale production of insulin still represents the key step in helping diabetic patients throughout the world.

For each camel, the IOP of both eyes was measured with applanation tonometry. Three measurements with < 5% variance were obtained for each eye on the same day of the week for 3 consecutive weeks. Mean IOP was calculated for each eye on each day for comparison purposes. Mean Â± SD IOPs for the right (31.1 Â± 2.1 mm Hg) and left (30.8 Â± 1.9 mm Hg) eyes of immature camels were significantly higher than those for the right (27.1 Â± 1.2 mm Hg) and left (28.2 Â± 1.2 mm Hg) eyes of mature camels. Intra-assay and interassay coefficients of variation (CVs) for IOP measurements of the right and left eyes did not differ significantly between immature and mature camels. Interassay CVs of IOP measurements for the right and left eyes ranged from 1.5% to 12.1% and 1.2% to 10.3%, respectively, for immature camels and from 1.2% to 17.2% and 1.7% to 18.8%, respectively, for mature camels. Intra-assay CVs of IOP measurements for the right and left eyes ranged from 1.5% to 10.6% and 1.9% to 9.6%, respectively, for immature camels and from 2.8% to 16.9% and 2.7% to 12.4%, respectively, for mature camels. Age was negatively correlated (r = -0.403) with IOP. Results provided a reference and might aid in the diagnosis of glaucoma and uveitis during complete ophthalmic examinations of dromedary camels.\n\nUltrasonographic evaluation of abdominal distension in 52 camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nTharwat, Mohamed; Al-Sobayil, Fahd; Ali, Ahmed; Buczinski, SÃ©bastien\n\n2012-08-01\n\nThe purpose of this study was to assess the diagnostic value of ultrasonography in the evaluation of abdominal distension in 52 camels (Camelus dromedarius). The conditions included trypanosomiasis (n=35), intestinal obstruction (n=12) and ruptured urinary bladder (n=5). Fifteen clinically normal camels were included as controls. Transabdominal and transrectal ultrasonography was carried out on all camels. In animals with trypanosomiasis, ultrasonographic findings included accumulation of massive amounts of hypoechoic abdominal fluids where liver, intestine, kidney, spleen and urinary bladder were imaged floating. Except in two cases of bile duct calcification and one of hepatic abscessation, no detectable abnormal sonographic lesions were detected while imaging the hepatic and renal parenchyma, and the heart and its valves and major blood vessels. In camels with intestinal obstruction, ultrasonographic findings included distended intestinal loops with markedly reduced or absent motility. In one camel, the intestinal lumen contained localised hyperechoic material that was consistent with a foreign body. Hypoechoic fluid with or without fibrin was seen between intestinal loops. In camels with ruptured urinary bladder, ultrasonographic findings included collapsed and perforated bladder, echogenic blood clots within the urinary bladder and peritoneal cavity, increased thickness of the bladder wall, floating intestines in hypoechogenic fluid and echogenic calculi within the urethra. Ultrasonography was considered a useful tool for the evaluation of dromedary camels with abdominal distension. Copyright Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

As parasitic diseases are the major cause of impaired meat and milk production in this animal, the present study aimed at determining gastrointestinal helminthic infections of Iranian camels in the center of the country. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract of 144 carcasses of one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtered in Yazd, Esfahan and Kerman provinces' abattoirs were examined for adult helminths. Camels were from both sexes and different ages. Recovered parasites were identified according to described keys by light microscope. Of 144 tested camels, 117 were infected with at least one helminth species (81.3%). A total of 28 worm species from 14 genera were identified in the digestive tract of infected animals, including 26 species of nematodes and two species of cestodes. The infection rates in stomach, small intestine, and caecum/large intestine were 86.3%, 91.5% and 11.1%, respectively. However, no worm was found in the oesophagus. The recovered worms with infection rates are discussed in this paper. In the present study, Haemonchus tataricus, Trichostrongylus hamatus and Trichuris infundibulus are reported from Iranian dromedaries for the first time. Regarding high prevalence of infection, using anthelminthic drugs seemed necessary to improve the health and productivity of camels. On the other hand, the high rate of zoonotic species indicated that camels have important role in maintaining and transmitting infection to humans.\n\nClinical, ultrasonographic, and pathologic findings in 70 camels (Camelus dromedarius) with Johneâs disease\n\nPubMed Central\n\nTharwat, Mohamed; Al-Sobayil, Fahd; Ali, Ahmed; Hashad, Mahmoud; Buczinski, SÃ©bastien\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThis study evaluated the use of ultrasonography for the diagnosis of Johneâs disease in camels (Camelus dromedarius).

The epidemiology of anaplasmosis in camels therefore remains poorly understood mostly because camels belong to marginalised poor and often transhumant populations whose interests are largely neglected. Most studies of anaplasmosis in camels have relied on microscopy and serology for diagnosis and only three studies, undertaken in Tunisia, Saudia Arabia and China, have used molecular diagnostics. The present work characterises Anaplasmataceae strains circulating in the Camelus dromedarius reservoir in Morocco using PCR. Camels (nâ=â106) were randomly sampled from 6 regions representing different agro-ecological areas in southern Morocco. Whole blood was collected and screened using PCR methods targeting the gene groEL. Anaplasmataceae strains were characterised by sequence analysis of the gene groEL. A total of 39.62% (42/106) camels screened were positive for Anaplasmataceae spp. GenBank BLAST analysis of five positive sequenced samples revealed that all strains were 100% identical to \"Candidatus Anaplasma camelii\". Phylogenetic investigation and genetic characterisation of the aligned segment (650Â bp) of the gene groEL confirmed high similarity with A. platys. This study demonstrates the circulation of a previously unidentified species of the genus Anaplasma in Morocco which is genetically close to the agent causing canine anaplasmosis but whose main reservoir is thought to be Camelus dromedarius. This study is not a clinical trial and therefore a trial registration number does not apply.\n\nUltrasonography of the lungs and pleura in healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nTharwat, Mohamed\n\n2013-09-01\n\nThis study describes ultrasonography of the lungs and pleura in healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius). The different layers of the thoracic wall appeared as narrow bands of variable echogenicity. Reverberation artefacts appeared as lines of variable echogenicity that ran parallel to the pulmonary surface medial to the pleura. Because of its air content, the pulmonary parenchyma was not visualised in all camels. On the right side, the pulmonary surface was seen in the 5th through the 10th intercostal space (ICS). In addition, it was imaged in the 11th ICS in 20 camels and in the 4th ICS in three camels. The dimension of the ventral lung border was largest at the 4th ICS and smallest at the 11th ICS. The echogenic line on the surface of the lung, consisting of the costal and the parietal pleurae, was 1 to 4 mm thick. The left pulmonary surface and pleura were imaged with approximately the same frequencies as the right side. At this side, only the pulmonary surface and pleura were imaged in 15 camels in the 11th ICS. In conclusion, ultrasonography of the lungs and pleura provides information that can be used as a reference when examining camels suspected to have respiratory diseases.\n\nACUTE CLINICAL LEPTOSPIROSIS (GRIPPOTYPHOSA SEROVAR) IN AN ADULT DROMEDARY CAMEL (CAMELUS DROMEDARIUS).\n\nPubMed\n\nGyimesi, Zoltan S; Burns, Roy B; Erol, Erdal; Bolin, Steven R\n\n2015-09-01\n\nA 9-yr-old castrated male dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) presented with lethargy and partial anorexia. A diagnostic examination revealed fever, and further workup revealed a neutrophilia, hyperfibrinogenemia, renal azotemia, and a rapid onset of a high Leptospira antibody titer during the acute clinical period (Grippotyphosa serovar). The camel responded clinically to antimicrobial treatment with ceftiofur crystalline free acid injections, but renal azotemia persisted, presumably secondary to chronic renal damage. Subsequent Leptospira polymerase chain reaction testing on urine samples obtained over the following 4 mo revealed no evidence of urinary shedding, so a persistent infection was unlikely. Although often mentioned as a potential cause of reproductive loss, well-documented case reports of clinical leptospirosis in camelids are very rare. In this case, native wildlife contamination of a small watering hole is suspected to have been the source of infection. In response to this experience, the camel and two conspecifics were prescribed a vaccination regimen using an inactivated pentavalent Leptospira vaccine licensed for cattle.\n\nSerosurvey of Coxiella burnetii (Q fever) in Dromedary Camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Laikipia County, Kenya.\n\nPubMed\n\nBrowne, A S; FÃ¨vre, E M; Kinnaird, M; Muloi, D M; Wang, C A; Larsen, P S; O'Brien, T; Deem, S L\n\n2017-11-01\n\nDromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) are an important protein source for people in semi-arid and arid regions of Africa. In Kenya, camel populations have grown dramatically in the past few decades resulting in the potential for increased disease transmission between humans and camels. An estimated four million Kenyans drink unpasteurized camel milk, which poses a disease risk. We evaluated the seroprevalence of a significant zoonotic pathogen, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), among 334 camels from nine herds in Laikipia County, Kenya. Serum testing revealed 18.6% positive seroprevalence of Coxiella burnetii (nÂ =Â 344). Increasing camel age was positively associated with C.Â burnetii seroprevalence (ORÂ =Â 5.36). Our study confirmed that camels living in Laikipia County, Kenya, have been exposed to the zoonotic pathogen, C.Â burnetii. Further research to evaluate the role of camels in disease transmission to other livestock, wildlife and humans in Kenya should be conducted. Â© 2017 The Authors.

Mycoplasma (M.) arginini, Acholeplasma (A.) laidlawii, and Acholeplasma oculi have been reported to be isolated from these host species. Serologically positive results have been reported for Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC type, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, and M. mycoides subsp. capri. The aims of this study were to detect, isolate, and identify mycoplasmas from camels (Camelus dromedarius). Initially, saliva and ear smears plus conjunctival and vaginal secretions were taken from five female animals, but only conjunctival secretions in three male animals, all belonging to the same farm. An unknown mycoplasma was isolated from one of the vagina samples. Additionally, another unknown and uncultured mycoplasma was detected with molecular biology in the same sample. In the second stage, 23 vaginal secretions were taken from the same farm plus another secretion from a different one. Ten isolates of the same unknown and previously isolated mycoplasma were detected, nine of them recovered from the vagina of female camels. Some mycoplasmas have been related to reproductive disorders; however, there is no evidence that the isolated mycoplasmas are related to such disorders.\n\nRetinol values in the plasma of the Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius) and the influence of aflatoxicosis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbbas, T A; Ali, B H\n\n2001-08-01\n\nThe normal values are reported of the concentration of vitamin A (retinol) in the plasma of 44 male and female adult camels (Camelus dromedarius) in the United Arab Emirates. The concentrations of the vitamin in the plasma of eight camels of both sexes afflicted with aflatoxicosis were also determined. The mean concentration (+/-SD) of the vitamin in healthy camels was 460.1 +/- 49.3 ng/L. Sex had no significant effect on the concentration of the vitamin. Camels with aflatoxicosis had a mean concentration of retinol in the plasma of 243.4 +/- 32.3 ng/L. The concentrations of aflatoxins in the liver and ruminal contents of these animals were 18.2 +/- 1.3 and 243.4 microg/kg, respectively.\n\nSarcocystis and Its Complications in Camels (Camelus dromedarius) of Eastern Provinces of Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nValinezhad, Akbar; Ahmadi, Nasrollah\n\n2008-01-01\n\nThe prevalence of Sarcocystis spp. was investigated by gross and histopathological examinations in 250 camels (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtered from 2002 to 2005 in the Mashhad Slaughterhouse, eastern Iran. Samples were taken from the diaphragm, heart, tongue, esophagus and masseter muscles for histopathological studies. No macroscopic sarcocysts were found in the samples at gross inspection. Sarcocysts were detected in 209 of 250 (83.6%) examined camels at histopathological level. The infection rate of the esophagus, heart, masseter muscles, diaphragm, and tongue was 58.8%, 48.0%, 46.8%, 41.6%, and 28.0%, respectively. There was no significant difference in the rate of infection between male (85.8%) and female (81.0%) camels. The tissue response to vital cysts was minimal; however, reaction to the degenerating cysts was severe and caused tissue damages resulting in hyperemia, hemorrhages, mononuclear cell infiltration, necrotic changes, and fibrosis. The wild and domestic carnivores especially dogs may be the final hosts of Sarcocystis spp. in this area. PMID:19127328\n\nThe pleural curtain of the camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nBuzzell, Gerald R; Kinne, Joerg; Tariq, Saeed; Wernery, Ulrich\n\n2010-10-01\n\nThe visceral pleura of the camel (Camelus dromedarius) possesses a fibrous curtain of pleural threads or extensions along its basal margins, which extends into the pleural cavity of the costophrenic recesses. These threads are lined by mesothelium and have a core or stroma, which is largely collagenous. Small threads are avascular and nearly acellular. In larger proximal threads, blood vessels in the stroma are often arranged in a branching network, with irregular endothelia surrounded by several incomplete basal laminae. Lymphocytes and other inflammatory cell types aggregate in the stroma near blood vessels. The threads are lined by typical mesothelium except in patches close to the main pleural surface. These patches consist of layers of loosely applied cells with numerous cellular processes and features suggestive of phagocytosis. The position of the pleural curtain in the costophrenic recess and the presence of possibly phagocytotic cells suggest that the pleural curtain stirs, samples, and cleans the pleural fluid. The pleural curtain appears to be a feature of camelids and has also been seen in giraffes.

The identification and characterisation of a parapoxvirus (PPV) infecting camels is described here. The virus was detected in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Kerman and Shiraz in Iran. PPV-specific amplification by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) further confirmed that the disease was associated with PPV infection. Phylogenetic analysis of ORF011 (B2L) gene sequences showed 99.79% and 82.13% similarity of the PPV identified in this study with the Jodhpur isolate and the bovine papular stomatitis virus (BPSV) isolates (CE41), respectively. Moreover, phylogenetic analysis of the ORF045 gene indicated that the Shiraz sample was in all probability closely related to VR634 and to F00.120R and PCPV776. In conclusion, the results suggest that camel PPV (CPPV) is a likely cause of contagious ecthyma in dromedary camels in Iran.\n\nA comparative study of ketone body metabolism between the camel (Camelus dromedarius) and the sheep (Ovis aries).\n\nPubMed\n\nChandrasena, L G; Emmanuel, B; Hamar, D W; Howard, B R\n\n1979-01-01\n\n1. Plasma levels of beta-hydroxybutyrate (BHB), and acetoacetate (AcAc) have been measured in camels (Camelus dromedarius) and sheep (Ovis aries). The activity of beta-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase (BHB-deH2) (E.C. 1.1.1.30) was studied in the rumen epithelium and the liver of these animals. 2. Concentrations of plasma BHB and AcAc in the camel were in respective order 33 and 4 times lower than that of the sheep. The ratios of BHB to AcAc were 0.61 and 4.8 for the camel and sheep, respectively. 3. The activity of BHB-deH2 in the rumen epithelium of the camel and sheep were 7.15 and 66 mumol/hr/g wet wt tissue, respectively. The activity in both species was higher in the rumen epithelium than in the liver.\n\nFunctional Organization of hsp70 Cluster in Camel (Camelus dromedarius) and Other Mammals\n\nPubMed Central\n\nGarbuz, David G.; Astakhova, Lubov N.; Zatsepina, Olga G.; Arkhipova, Irina R.; Nudler, Eugene; Evgen'ev, Michael B.\n\n2011-01-01\n\nHeat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) is a molecular chaperone providing tolerance to heat and other challenges at the cellular and organismal levels. We sequenced a genomic cluster containing three hsp70 family genes linked with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class III region from an extremely heat tolerant animal, camel (Camelus dromedarius). Two hsp70 family genes comprising the cluster contain heat shock elements (HSEs), while the third gene lacks HSEs and should not be induced by heat shock. Comparison of the camel hsp70 cluster with the corresponding regions from several mammalian species revealed similar organization of genes forming the cluster. Specifically, the two heat inducible hsp70 genes are arranged in tandem, while the third constitutively expressed hsp70 family member is present in inverted orientation. Comparison of regulatory regions of hsp70 genes from camel and other mammals demonstrates that transcription factor matches with highest significance are located in the highly conserved 250-bp upstream region and correspond to HSEs followed by NF-Y and Sp1 binding sites. The high degree of sequence conservation leaves little room for putative camel-specific regulatory elements. Surprisingly, RT-PCR and 5â²/3â²-RACE analysis demonstrated that all three hsp70 genes are expressed in camel's muscle and blood cells not only after heat shock, but under normal physiological conditions as well, and may account for tolerance of camel cells to extreme environmental conditions. A high degree of evolutionary conservation observed for the hsp70 cluster always linked with MHC locus in mammals suggests an important role of such organization for coordinated functioning of these vital genes.

Sera were harvested from eutocic (nÂ =Â 9) and dystocic (nÂ =Â 20) camels within the first 15Â minutes after delivery. Although there were no differences in the concentrations of estradiol-17Î² (E2) and prostaglandin F2Î± (PGF2Î±) between the eutocic and the dystocic animals, the level of progesterone (P4) and cortisol was significantly higher (PÂ <Â 0.01) in animals that experienced dystocia than those that had a normal birth. There were no differences between the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, cholesterol, creatine kinase, creatinine, or magnesium (Mg) in eutocic and dystocic animals. The nitric oxide concentration was significantly higher (PÂ <Â 0.01) in the serum from animals with dystocia than those that had normal births. By contrast, the serum concentrations of glucose, phosphorus (P), and triglycerides were significantly lower (PÂ <Â 0.01) in eutocic camels compared with dystocic camels. As the delayed decline of P4 is reported to be the major hormonal difference between eutocic and dystocic camels, we propose that the insensitivity of corpus luteum to luteolytic action may be a cause of dystocia. Moreover, stress and hormonal changes may affect the metabolic traits in dystocia camels. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Yet the aetiology of this condition remains elusive. This study is the first to apply state of the art molecular methods to shed light on the nasopharyngeal carrier state of Pasteurellaceae in camels. The study focused on HS causing Pasteurella multocida capsular types B and E. Other Pasteurellaceae, implicated in common respiratory infections of animals, were also investigated. In 2007 and 2008, 388 nasopharyngeal swabs were collected at 12 locations in North Kenya from 246 clinically healthy camels in 81 herds that had been affected by HS-like disease. Swabs were used to cultivate bacteria on blood agar and to extract DNA for subsequent PCR analysis targeting P. multocida and Mannheimia-specific gene sequences. Forty-five samples were positive for P. multocida genes kmt and psl and for the P. multocida Haemorrhagic Septicaemia (HS) specific sequences KTSP61/KTT72 but lacked HS-associated capsular type B and E genes capB and capE. This indicates circulation of HS strains in camels that lack established capsular types. Sequence analysis of the partial 16S rRNA gene identified 17 nasal swab isolates as 99% identical with Mannheimia granulomatis, demonstrating a hitherto unrecognised active carrier state for M. granulomatis or a closely related Mannheimia sp. in camels. The findings of this study provide evidence for the presence of acapsular P. multocida or of hitherto unknown capsular types of P. multocida in camels, closely related to P. multocida strains causing HS in bovines. Further isolations and molecular studies of camelid P. multocida from healthy carriers and from HS-like disease in camels are necessary to provide conclusive answers. This paper is the first report on the isolation of M. granulomatis or a closely related new Mannheimia species from camelids.\n\nPurification, crystallization and preliminary crystallographic study of haemoglobin from camel (Camelus dromedarius): a high oxygen-affinity lowland species.\n\nPubMed\n\nBalasubramanian, M; Moorthy, Pon Sathya; Neelagandan, K; Ponnuswamy, M N\n\n2009-08-01\n\nHaemoglobin is a prototypical allosteric protein that is mainly involved in the transportation of oxygen from the lungs to tissues and of carbon dioxide back to the lungs in an intrinsically coordinated manner to maintain the viability of cells. Haemoglobin from Camelus dromedarius provides an interesting case study of adaptation to life in deserts at extremely high temperatures. An ambition to unravel the integrated structural and functional aspects of the casual survival of this animal at high temperatures led us to specifically work on this problem. The present work reports the preliminary crystallographic study of camel haemoglobin. Camel blood was collected and the haemoglobin was purified by anion-exchange chromatography and crystallized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method under buffered high salt concentration using PEG 3350 as a precipitant. Intensity data were collected using a MAR 345 dtb image-plate detector system. Camel haemoglobin crystallized in the monoclinic space group P2(1), with one whole biological molecule (alpha(2)beta(2)) in the asymmetric unit and unit-cell parameters a = 52.759, b = 116.782, c = 52.807 A, beta = 120.07 degrees .\n\nSevere whipworm (Trichuris spp.) infection in the dromedary (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nEo, Kyung-Yeon; Kwak, Dongmi; Kwon, Oh-Deog\n\n2014-03-01\n\nOne adult (13-yr-old) and two young (3-4-yr-old) male dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) from the Seoul Zoo displayed anorexia and chronic diarrhea for 2 wk. Direct fecal smear examination revealed Trichuris spp. infection. After confirmation of the infection, fenbendazole was orally administered as a suspension; this was repeated two times at 3-wk intervals. A high initial dose (20 mg/kg) was followed by administration at the recommended dose (10 mg/kg). Starting on the day following the first treatment, a large number of adult whipworms were discharged with the feces over a 3-day period. Two young male dromedary camels gradually recovered. However, the adult male dromedary camel developed continuous bloody mucoid diarrhea and died 2 days after treatment. Postmortem examination revealed that numerous whipworms were attached to the mucosa throughout the large intestine.\n\nMolecular analysis of the bacterial microbiome in the forestomach fluid from the dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nBhatt, Vaibhav D; Dande, Suchitra S; Patil, Nitin V; Joshi, Chaitanya G\n\n2013-04-01\n\nRumen microorganisms play an important role in ruminant digestion and absorption of nutrients and have great potential applications in the field of rumen adjusting, food fermentation and biomass utilization etc. In order to investigate the composition of microorganisms in the rumen of camel (Camelus dromedarius), this study delves in the microbial diversity by culture-independent approach. It includes comparison of rumen samples investigated in the present study to other currently available metagenomes to reveal potential differences in rumen microbial systems. Pyrosequencing based metagenomics was applied to analyze phylogenetic and metabolic profiles by MG-RAST, a web based tool. Pyrosequencing of camel rumen sample yielded 8,979,755 nucleotides assembled to 41,905 sequence reads with an average read length of 214 nucleotides. Taxonomic analysis of metagenomic reads indicated Bacteroidetes (55.5 %), Firmicutes (22.7 %) and Proteobacteria (9.2 %) phyla as predominant camel rumen taxa. At a finer phylogenetic resolution, Bacteroides species dominated the camel rumen metagenome. Functional analysis revealed that clustering-based subsystem and carbohydrate metabolism were the most abundant SEED subsystem representing 17 and 13 % of camel metagenome, respectively. A high taxonomic and functional similarity of camel rumen was found with the cow metagenome which is not surprising given the fact that both are mammalian herbivores with similar digestive tract structures and functions. Combined pyrosequencing approach and subsystems-based annotations available in the SEED database allowed us access to understand the metabolic potential of these microbiomes. Altogether, these data suggest that agricultural and animal husbandry practices can impose significant selective pressures on the rumen microbiota regardless of rumen type. The present study provides a baseline for understanding the complexity of camel rumen microbial ecology while also highlighting striking\n\nOverexpression, purification and enzymatic characterization of a recombinant Arabian camel Camelus dromedarius glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaeed, Hesham; Ismaeil, Mohammad; Embaby, Amira; Ataya, Farid; Malik, Ajamaluddin; Shalaby, Manal; El-Banna, Sabah; Ali, Ahmed Abdelrahim Mohamed; Bassiouny, Khalid\n\n2018-02-01\n\nIn a previous study the full-length open reading frame of the Arabian camel, Camelus dromedarius liver cytosolic glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) cDNA was determined using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The C.Â dromedarius cDNA was found to be 1545 nucleotides (accession number JN098421) that encodes a protein of 515 amino acids residues. In the present study, C.Â dromedarius recombinant G6PD was heterologously overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21 (DE3) pLysS and purified by immobilized metal affinity fast protein liquid chromatography (FPLC) in a single step. The purity and molecular weight of the enzyme were analyzed on SDS-PAGE and the purified enzyme showed a single band on the gel with a molecular weight of 63.0Â KDa. The specific activity was determined to be 2000Â EU/mg protein. The optimum temperature and pH were found to be 60Â Â°C and 7.4, respectively. The isoelectric point (pI) for the purified G6PD was determined to be 6.4. The apparent K m values for the two substrates NADP + and G6P were found to be 23.2Â Î¼M and 66.7Â Î¼M, respectively. The far-UV circular dichroism (CD) spectra of G6PD showed that it has two minima at 208 and 222Â nm as well as maxima at 193Â nm which is characteristic of high content of Î±-helix. Moreover, the far-UV CD spectra of the G6PD in the presence or absence of NADP + were nearly identical. Copyright Â© 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Most Bartonella spp. have adapted to a specific host, generally a domestic or wild mammal. Dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) have become a focus of growing public-health interest because they have been identified as a reservoir host for the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Nevertheless, data on camel zoonoses are limited. We aimed to study the occurrence of Bartonella bacteremia among dromedaries in Israel. Nine of 51 (17.6%) camels were found to be bacteremic with Bartonella spp.; bacteremia levels ranged from five to >1000 colony-forming units/mL. Phylogenetic reconstruction based on the concatenated sequences of gltA and rpoB genes demonstrated that the dromedary Bartonella isolates are closely related to other ruminant-derived Bartonella spp., with B. bovis being the nearest relative. Using electron microscopy, the novel isolates were shown to be flagellated, whereas B. bovis is nonflagellated. Sequence comparisons analysis of the housekeeping genes ftsZ, ribC, and groEL showed the highest homology to B. chomelii, B. capreoli, and B. birtlesii, respectively. Sequence analysis of the gltA and rpoB revealed â¼96% identity to B. bovis, a previously suggested cutoff value for sequence-based differentiation of Bartonella spp., suggesting that this approach does not have sufficient discriminatory power for differentiating ruminant-related Bartonella spp. A comprehensive multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis based on nine genetic loci (gltA, rpoB, ftsZ, internal transcribed spacer (ITS), 16S rRNA, ribC, groEL, nuoG, and SsrA) identified seven sequence types of the new dromedary isolates. This is the first description of a Bartonella sp. from camelids. On the basis of a distinct reservoir and ecological niche, sequence analyses, and expression of flagella, we designate these isolates as a novel Bartonella sp. named Bartonella dromedarii sp\n\nMolecular Cloning, Characterization and Predicted Structure of a Putative Copper-Zinc SOD from the Camel, Camelus dromedarius\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAtaya, Farid S.; Fouad, Dalia; Al-Olayan, Ebtsam; Malik, Ajamaluddin\n\n2012-01-01\n\nSuperoxide dismutase (SOD) is the first line of defense against oxidative stress induced by endogenous and/or exogenous factors and thus helps in maintaining the cellular integrity. Its activity is related to many diseases; so, it is of importance to study the structure and expression of SOD gene in an animal naturally exposed most of its life to the direct sunlight as a cause of oxidative stress. Arabian camel (one humped camel, Camelus dromedarius) is adapted to the widely varying desert climatic conditions that extremely changes during daily life in the Arabian Gulf. Studying the cSOD1 in C. dromedarius could help understand the impact of exposure to direct sunlight and desert life on the health status of such mammal. The full coding region of a putative CuZnSOD gene of C. dromedarius (cSOD1) was amplified by reverse transcription PCR and cloned for the first time (gene bank accession number for nucleotides and amino acids are JF758876 and AEF32527, respectively). The cDNA sequencing revealed an open reading frame of 459 nucleotides encoding a protein of 153 amino acids which is equal to the coding region of SOD1 gene and protein from many organisms. The calculated molecular weight and isoelectric point of cSOD1 was 15.7 kDa and 6.2, respectively. The level of expression of cSOD1 in different camel tissues (liver, kidney, spleen, lung and testis) was examined using Real Time-PCR. The highest level of cSOD1 transcript was found in the camel liver (represented as 100%) followed by testis (45%), kidney (13%), lung (11%) and spleen (10%), using 18S ribosomal subunit as endogenous control. The deduced amino acid sequence exhibited high similarity with Cebus apella (90%), Sus scrofa (88%), Cavia porcellus (88%), Mus musculus (88%), Macaca mulatta (87%), Pan troglodytes (87%), Homo sapiens (87%), Canis familiaris (86%), Bos taurus (86%), Pongo abelii (85%) and Equus caballus (82%). Phylogenetic analysis revealed that cSOD1 is grouped together with S. scrofa. The\n\nMonophyletic origin of domestic bactrian camel (Camelus bactrianus) and its evolutionary relationship with the extant wild camel (Camelus bactrianus ferus)\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJi, R; Cui, P; Ding, F; Geng, J; Gao, H; Zhang, H; Yu, J; Hu, S; Meng, H\n\n2009-01-01\n\nThe evolutionary relationship between the domestic bactrian camel and the extant wild two-humped camel and the factual origin of the domestic bactrian camel remain elusive. We determined the sequence of mitochondrial cytb gene from 21 camel samples, including 18 domestic camels (three Camelus bactrianus xinjiang, three Camelus bactrianus sunite, three Camelus bactrianus alashan, three Camelus bactrianus red, three Camelus bactrianus brown and three Camelus bactrianus normal) and three wild camels (Camelus bactrianus ferus). Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that the extant wild two-humped camel may not share a common ancestor with the domestic bactrian camel and they are not the same subspecies at least in their maternal origins. Molecular clock analysis based on complete mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that the sub-speciation of the two lineages had begun in the early Pleistocene, about 0.7 million years ago. According to the archaeological dating of the earliest known two-humped camel domestication (5000â6000 years ago), we could conclude that the extant wild camel is a separate lineage but not the direct progenitor of the domestic bactrian camel. Further phylogenetic analysis suggested that the bactrian camel appeared monophyletic in evolutionary origin and that the domestic bactrian camel could originate from a single wild population. The data presented here show how conservation strategies should be implemented to protect the critically endangered wild camel, as it is the last extant form of the wild tribe Camelina.

The routine application of artificial insemination with frozen semen would assist the flow of valuable genetic material nationally and internationally. The current study sought to examine the effects of cholesterol (cholesterol-loaded cyclodextrin [CLC]) preloading on camel sperm cryosurvival. Ejaculates (n = 3 males; 3 ejaculates per male) were collected using an artificial vagina during the breeding season and extended in HEPES-buffered Tyrode's albumin lactate pyruvate (TALP) and allowed to liquefy in the presence of papain (0.1 mg/mL) before removal of the seminal plasma by centrifugation. Sperm pellets were resuspended (120 million/mL) in fresh TALP and incubated (15 minutes; 37 Â°C) with 0, 1.5, or 4.5 mg CLC/mL. Sperm suspensions were then centrifuged and reconstituted in INRA-96 containing 20% (v:v) egg yolk and 2.5% (v:v) methylformamide, loaded in 0.5-mL plastic straws, sealed, and cooled for 20 minutes at 4 Â°C. Straws were frozen over liquid nitrogen (4 cm above liquid; 15 minutes), plunged, and stored. Sperm motility, forward progressive status, and acrosomal integrity were recorded at 0 and 3 hours after thawing and compared with these same parameters before freezing. Aliquots also were stained with chlortetracycline hydrochloride to assess spontaneous sperm capacitation status before freezing and post-thaw. Pretreatment with CLC (1.5 and 4.5 mg/mL) enhanced cryosurvival. Post-thaw sperm motility was highest (P < 0.05) in 1.5 mg CLC/mL immediately after thawing (44%) and after 3 hours incubation at room temperature (34%). Highest post-thaw sperm progressive status was also achieved in the presence of 1.5 CLC. Greater proportions of spermatozoa retained acrosomal membrane integrity when cryopreserved in the presence of CLC, but there was no difference between 1.5 and 4.5 CLC. Although thawed spermatozoa underwent spontaneous\n\nCrimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in the One-Humped Camel (Camelus dromedarius) in East and Northeast of Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChampour, Mohsen; Chinikar, Sadegh; Mohammadi, Gholamreza; Razmi, Gholamreza; Mostafavi, Ehsan; Shah-Hosseini, Nariman; Khakifirouz, Sahar; Jalali, Tahmineh\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: This comprehensive study was conducted on multi-purpose one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) sera and ticks to assess the epidemiological aspects of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in northeast Iran. Methods: From May 2012 to January 2013, eleven cities were randomly selected in the Khorasan Provinces of Iran as âclusters,â and at least 14 one-humped camels were sampled from each area. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of the CCHFV genome in ticks. Sera were analyzed using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Results: Four hundred and eighty ixodid ticks were collected, and the genome of the CCHFV was detected in 49 (10.2%) out of 480 ticks. The CCHFV genome was detected in two out of four tick species, and in tick samples from three cities in Khorassan-e-Jonoobi. All three provinces, and six out of eleven cities, were CCHFV-specific IgG-positive. In total, nine (5.3%) out of 170 one-humped camels were IgG-positive. The highest rate of IgG-positive samples was found in Nehbandan (16.67%). Conclusion: Continued surveillance and strictly enforced importation and quarantine practices should be implemented to prevent human exposure and the on-going dispersal of infected ticks and livestock in these regions. It is recommended that acaricides be used to prevent CCHF transmission to humans, and to reduce the tick population. In addition, care should be taken by abattoirs workers and people who work with one-humped camels.

Phylogenetic analysis using both the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and large-subunit (LSU) regions of the rRNA locus demonstrated that these isolates were identical and formed a distinct clade within the anaerobic fungi (phylum Neocallimastigomycota). Morphological examination showed that these fungi formed monocentric thalli with filamentous rhizoids and uniflagellate zoospores, broadly similar to members of the genus Piromyces. However, distinctive morphological features were observed, notably the pinching of the cytoplasm in the sporangiophore and the formation of intercalary rhizoidal swellings. Since genetic analyses demonstrated this fungus was only distantly related to Piromyces spp. and closer to the polycentric Anaeromyces clade, we have assigned it to a new genus and species Oontomyces anksri gen. nov., sp. nov. Interrogation of the GenBank database identified several closely related ITS sequences, which were all environmental sequences obtained from camels, raising the possibility that this fungus may be specific to camelids.

However, no information on Anaplasma infection in two-humped Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) in China has been published to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. in domestic Bactrian camels and ticks in Xinjiang, China. A total of 382 ticks were collected from the Bactrian camels and from environmental sources. Of these, 84 were morphologically identified as belonging to the Rhipicephalus sanguineus group and genetically identified (12S rDNA, 16S rDNA and the cytochrome c oxidase 1 genes) as R. sanguineus group ticks (temporally designated as Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang). PCR testing showed that 7.2% (20/279) of the camels harbored Anaplasma platys DNA. However, microscopic examination revealed no A. platys inclusions in blood smears from the camels. The PCR prevalence of A. platys DNA was 9.5% (6/63) in Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang from the Bactrian camels and 14.3% (3/21) in Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang from the vegetation. A. platys DNA was not detected by PCR in other tick species (Hyalomma asiaticum, Dermacentor niveus and Hyalomma dromedarii), and no other Anaplasma species were detected in these samples. This is the first report of A. platys in Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China. The moderate positivity observed indicates that these animals might be a natural host for this pathogen in China.\n\nMolecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of Dipetalonema evansi (LEWIS, 1882) in camels (Camelus dromedarius) of Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSazmand, Alireza; Eigner, Barbara; Mirzaei, Mohammad; Hekmatimoghaddam, Seyedhossein; Harl, Josef; Duscher, Georg Gerhard; Fuehrer, Hans-Peter; Joachim, Anja\n\n2016-04-01\n\nDespite the economic importance of camels, the parasites that affect them have not received adequate attention so far and molecular studies are scarce compared to other livestock. In this study, we characterized peripheral blood microfilariae in 200 healthy one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) from south-east Iran by microscopy and molecular tools to receive a more detailed insight into prevalence and species that affect them. Moreover, adult specimens of the filarial nematode Dipetalonema evansi were collected from the carcass of an infected animal. Microscopic examination was performed on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and blood was also spotted on Whatman FTA(Â®) cards for DNA analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted, and PCR was carried out for the detection of filaroid helminths, followed by sequence analysis of positive samples. Four samples were positive for microfilariae by microscopy, while 16 animals (8 %) were positive by PCR. Sequence analysis revealed D. evansi in all cases. Phylogenetic analysis of a cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence of filaroid nematodes showed that most species in a single genus cluster in the same clade; however, D. evansi and D. gracile are not monophyletic and branch rather at the base of the tree. Further studies on the life cycle of D. evansi, specifically the identification of intermediate host(s), have become feasible with the provision of the first specific COI sequences in this study.\n\nPharmacokinetics and distribution of ceftazidime to milk after intravenous and intramuscular administration to lactating female dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nGoudah, Ayman M; Hasabelnaby, Sherifa M\n\n2013-08-01\n\nTo determine the plasma disposition kinetics, absolute bioavailability, and milk concentrations of ceftazidime in healthy lactating female dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) following IV and IM administration of a single dose of 10 mg/kg (4.5 mg/lb). Prospective crossover study. 8 healthy adult lactating female dromedary camels. Camels received ceftazidime (10 mg/kg) IV and IM in a crossover study design with a 15-day washout period between treatments. Plasma and milk samples were collected at predetermined times for 48 hours after drug administration and analyzed by use of high-performance liquid chromatography. A 2-compartment open model best represented the plasma concentration-versus-time data after IV and IM administration of ceftazidime to camels. Plasma ceftazidime concentrations decreased biexponentially after IV administration with mean distribution and elimination half-lives of 0.3 hours and 2.85 hours, respectively. After IM administration, the mean maximum plasma concentration of ceftazidime was 32.43 Î¼g/mL (1.21 hours after administration), mean elimination half-life was 3.20 hours, mean residence time was 4.84 hours, and mean systemic bioavailability was 93.72%. Distribution of ceftazidime from plasma to milk was rapid and extensive as indicated by the ratio of the area under the milk concentration-versus-time curve to the area under the plasma concentration-versus-time curve and the ratio of the maximum milk concentration to the maximum plasma concentration of ceftazidime after IV and IM administration. Results suggested that ceftazidime may be a useful treatment for female camels with mastitis caused by susceptible microorganisms.\n\nPrevalence of antibodies to Neospora caninum in the serum of camels (Camelus dromedarius) from central Punjab, Pakistan.\n\nPubMed\n\nNazir, Muhammad Mudasser; Oneeb, Muhammad; Ayaz, Muhammad Mazhar; Bibi, Fehmeeda; Ahmad, Atif Nisar; Waheed, Abdul; Sajid, Muhammad Afzal; Sultan, Muhammad Tauseef; Yasin, Ghulam; Lindsay, David S\n\n2017-06-01\n\nInfection with the Apicomplexan parasite Neospora caninum occurs in domestic and wild animals worldwide. This parasite causes significant economic losses in the dairy industry worldwide. The current study was designed to assess the prevalence of N. caninum antibodies in the sera of camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Rakh Mahni, Bhakkar, Pakistan, to better understand the epidemiology of this important cause of bovine abortion in Pakistan. Eighty-one sera samples collected from apparently healthy camels (maleÂ =Â 19, femaleÂ =Â 62) were tested for antibodies against N. caninum by using a commercially available competitive Enzyme Linked Immunosorbent assay diagnostic kit. Nine (11.1%) of 81 sera samples were found positive for antibodies to N. caninum. No significant (PÂ >Â 0.05) difference in seroprevalence was observed between male and female camels or between different breeds. An increasing trend of seropositivity to N. caninum was seen with the age of animals indicating postnatal exposure to N. caninum infection. However, this increase in prevalence was not significant (PÂ >Â 0.05). However, a significant (PÂ <Â 0.05) difference in seroprevalence was noted among feeding style of animals, i.e., stall feeding, grazing, and mixed (grazing and stall feeding) feeding style. The prevalence was significantly (PÂ <Â 0.05) higher in female animals 26.1% (6/23) with abortion history that of animals have had no such history 5.1% (2/39). Presence of antibodies to N. caninum in the sera of camels indicates that further studies are required to evaluate the importance of N. caninum as a cause of abortion or neonatal disease in these animals.\n\nComparison of some biochemical and hormonal constituents of oversized follicles and preovulatory follicles in camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nGhoneim, I M; Waheed, M M; El-Bahr, S M; Alhaider, A K; Al-Eknah, M M\n\n2013-03-01\n\nThe current study was carried out to compare some biochemical and hormonal constituents in follicular fluids from oversized follicles, preovulatory follicles, and serum in camels (Camelus dromedarius). Follicular fluids from oversized follicles (N = 10), preovulatory follicles (N = 10), and sera were harvested from 20 dromedaries. The follicular fluids and sera were subjected to biochemical and hormonal analysis. The results indicated no significant differences in the concentrations of ascorbic acid, glucose, cholesterol, acid phosphatase, and alkaline phosphatase between follicular fluid from oversized follicles and preovulatory follicles. In addition, there were no significant variations in the level of ascorbic acid, glucose, cholesterol, and acid phosphatase in the serum of animals with oversized follicles and those with preovulatory follicles. Serum alkaline phosphatase was significantly greater (P < 0.05) in camels with oversized follicles. The concentrations of estradiol-17Î² (E2) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in the follicular fluid of oversized follicles were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that from preovulatory follicles. There were no differences in the concentrations of progesterone, tri-iodothyronine, and thyroxin between follicular fluid from oversized follicles and that of preovulatory follicles. The concentrations of E2, progesterone, tri-iodothyronine, thyroxin, cortisol, and IGF-1 were not different in the serum of camels with oversized follicles and camels with preovulatory follicles. The current study revealed that the significant differences of biochemical and hormonal constituents between follicular fluids from oversized follicles and preovulatory follicles were restricted on E2 and IGF-1. Relaying on the aforementioned outcome we can suggest that oversized follicle phenomenon is a form of follicular atresia of anovulatory follicles. Copyright Â© 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Ocular measurements were recorded by A- and B-scan ultrasonographic examination of 40 buffalo eyes (18 young and 22 adult eyes) and 34 camel eyes (14 young and 20 adult eyes) using a KANGH ultrasound scanner equipped with 10âMHz probe. For gross measurements, 20 buffalo and 16 camel eye globes were frozen and dissected and the same measurements were made using fine callipers macroscopically. The aqueous and vitreous humour of the buffalo and camel eyes appeared anechoic. The cornea, anterior and posterior lens capsule and iris appeared hyperechoic. The ocular measurements for the axial length, vitreous chamber depth (VCD), corneal thickness, lens thickness and scleroretinal rim thickness increase with the advance of age in both buffaloes and camels. Except for the anterior chamber depth, VCD and lens thickness, which were larger in adult camels than in adult buffaloes, no other differences between ocular dimensions were observed in both species. The results of this study are valuable for comparative ocular anatomy and will be useful for ultrasonographic evaluation of ocular diseases in buffaloes and camels.

The objective was to evaluate how different watering intervals affected milk production and feeding. Eight lactating camels (Camelus dromedarius) were recruited and subjected to 4 watering regimens in a Latin square design experiment performed at Haramaya University in Ethiopia. Each regimen lasted 16 d with 5 d of daily watering between periods: water was offered at 1,315 h once daily (W1); on d 4, 8, 12, and 16 (W4); on d 8 and 16 (W8); and on d 16 (W16). One camel became sick in the second period and its results were excluded. Camels were kept in a pen with minimal shade and a noon temperature of 30.9Â±0.1Â°C. They had free access to hay and were offered 2 kg of concentrates 3 times daily. At noon on d 1, 4, 8, 12, and 16, a blood sample was taken from the jugular vein before watering. All calves were kept together in a separate pen. Morning and afternoon calves stimulated milk let-down before the camels were hand-milked, after which the calves suckled, emptying the udder. Camels maintained the milk volume during water deprivation for about 1 wk, but they produced less milk during the second week during W16. Morning milk osmolality increased from 315Â±3 on d 1 to 333Â±3 mosm/kg on d 4 during W4 and from 321Â±3 on d 1 to 342Â±3 mosm/kg on d 8 during W8. After watering at 1315 h, milk osmolality decreased to 316Â±3 and 323Â±3 mosm/kg, respectively, the same afternoon and then increased during recurrent water deprivation to 338Â±3 (W4) and 347Â±3 mosm/kg (W8) on d 16, respectively. During W16, osmolality increased from 318Â±3 to 336Â±3 mosm/kg during the first 4 d of water deprivation, but during the remaining 12 d the further rise in osmolality was not higher compared with that on d 4. The change in milk osmolality was linearly correlated to plasma osmolality (r=0.8), but milk lactose content did not increase. Contrary to widespread belief, camels did not dilute their milk when\n\nEntrainment of the circadian clock by daily ambient temperature cycles in the camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nEl Allali, Khalid; AchaÃ¢ban, Mohamed R; Bothorel, BÃ©atrice; Piro, Mohamed; BouÃ¢ouda, Hanan; El Allouchi, Morad; Ouassat, Mohammed; Malan, AndrÃ©; PÃ©vet, Paul\n\n2013-06-01\n\nIn mammals the light-dark (LD) cycle is known to be the major cue to synchronize the circadian clock. In arid and desert areas, the camel (Camelus dromedarius) is exposed to extreme environmental conditions. Since wide oscillations of ambient temperature (Ta) are a major factor in this environment, we wondered whether cyclic Ta fluctuations might contribute to synchronization of circadian rhythms. The rhythm of body temperature (Tb) was selected as output of the circadian clock. After having verified that Tb is synchronized by the LD and free runs in continuous darkness (DD), we submitted the animals to daily cycles of Ta in LL and in DD. In both cases, the Tb rhythm was entrained to the cycle of Ta. On a 12-h phase shift of the Ta cycle, the mean phase shift of the Tb cycle ranged from a few hours in LD (1 h by cosinor, 4 h from curve peaks) to 7-8 h in LL and 12 h in DD. These results may reflect either true synchronization of the central clock by Ta daily cycles or possibly a passive effect of Ta on Tb. To resolve the ambiguity, melatonin rhythmicity was used as another output of the clock. In DD melatonin rhythms were also entrained by the Ta cycle, proving that the daily Ta cycle is able to entrain the circadian clock of the camel similar to photoperiod. By contrast, in the presence of a LD cycle the rhythm of melatonin was modified by the Ta cycle in only 2 (or 3) of 7 camels: in these specific conditions a systematic effect of Ta on the clock could not be evidenced. In conclusion, depending on the experimental conditions (DD vs. LD), the daily Ta cycle can either act as a zeitgeber or not.\n\nStreptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus pleuropneumonia and peritonitis in a dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) calf in North America.\n\nPubMed\n\nStoughton, William B; Gold, Jenifer\n\n2015-08-01\n\nA 12-week-old female dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) calf was evaluated because of acute (< 24 hours) inappetence and lethargy. The calf was being bottle-fed because of maternal rejection. Physical examination revealed decreased bronchovesicular sounds and absent borborygmi. The rectal temperature was 38.9Â°C (102.0Â°F). A CBC indicated leukopenia with a degenerative left shift suggestive of a systemic infection. Results of abdominal and thoracic ultrasonography showed severe bicavitary effusion, peripheral lung consolidation, and intestinal hypomotility. Pleural and peritoneal fluid analysis confirmed a diagnosis of septic pleuritis and peritonitis. Results of aerobic bacterial culture of venous blood, peritoneal fluid, and pleural fluid samples indicated Streptococcus equi subsp zooepidemicus septicemia as the etiology for the polyserositis (ie, alpaca fever). Treatment with IV broad-spectrum antimicrobials, an NSAID, and pleural drainage was initiated. Clinical signs of pleuropneumonia, peritonitis, and systemic infection improved rapidly 24 hours after initiation of medical treatment. The calf was discharged from the hospital after 11 days, and antimicrobial treatment continued for 2 weeks after discharge. At follow-up approximately 4 weeks after hospital discharge (6 weeks after the initial examination), there were no clinical signs suggestive of relapse or any reported complications. S equi subsp zooepidemicus may cause polyserositis in Old World camelids (eg, dromedary camels) with signs similar to those seen in New World camelids (eg, alpaca and llama). The rapid response to medical treatment for the patient described suggested that S equi subsp zooepidemicus-induced polyserositis (alpaca fever) in dromedary camels may respond favorably to appropriate treatment. Reducing stress, reducing overcrowding, and separate housing of equids and camelids are suggested. Further studies are needed to better assess the epidemiology of alpaca fever in dromedary\n\nComparison of effects of age and sex on serum protein electrophoretic pattern in one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Semnan, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhmadi-hamedani, M.; Ghazvinian, K.; Kokhaei, P.; Barati, M.; Mahdavi, A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of age and sex on the concentration of total serum protein measured by the biuret method and protein fractions determined using cellulose acetate electrophoresis in apparently healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius). Blood samples were collected from 21 camels (12 males and 9 females). The camels were further divided into two groups: 12 young camels at the age of 3 months to 2 years and 9 adult camels at the age of 3-15 years.

Selected PCDDs, PCDFs, and PCBs were measured in pools of milk from camels (n=15) located in various places of Kazakhstan (Almaty, Atyrau, Aralsk, Shymkent) and sampled at two different seasons for two different species (Camelus bactrianus and Camelus dromedarius). Non-dioxin-like (NDL-)PCB concentrations (6.3Â±2.7 ng g(-1) fat, median 5.1 ng g(-1) fat, range 0.6-17.4 ng g(-1) fat) were far below the maximum value of 40 ng g(-1) fat proposed by the EU. Dioxin-like (DL-)PCB concentrations (1.7Â±0.7 ng g(-1) fat, median 1.5 ng g(-1) fat, range 0.3-4.2 ng g(-1) fat) and the NDL-PCB to DL-PCB ratio (4.3) were similar to what is reported in EU for cow-based dairy products. PCB 52 and PCB 101 appeared to be proportionally more present in Kazakh camel milk samples (>60% of the sum of the 6 indicator NDL-PCBs) than in European cow milk samples (<10% of the sum of the 6 indicator NDL-PCBs), indicating possible differences in the route of exposure to PCBs in Kazakhstan. PCB 105 and PCB 118 appeared to be present at higher concentrations in camel milk (>80% of the sum of the 12 DL-PCBs). PCB 105, PCB 118 and PCB 156 were the major congeners for DL-PCBs, accounting for 92% of the sum of concentrations of DL-PCBs (88% for Belgian cows). In terms of TEQ, PCB 126 and PCB 118 are the major contributors and represent, respectively, 80% and 14% of the DL-PCB TEQWHO05 concentrations. No significant interracial or geographical trends were observed for NDL- and DL-PCB profiles. However, concentrations of all DL-PCBs appeared to be significantly higher for samples collected in Atyrau region. 2,3,7,8-TCDD level (mean 0.08Â±0.07 pg g(-1) fat, median 0.08 pg g(-1) fat, range 0\n\nMolecular detection of Rickettsia aeschlimannii in Hyalomma spp. ticks from camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Nigeria, West Africa.\n\nPubMed\n\nKamani, J; Baneth, G; Apanaskevich, D A; Mumcuoglu, K Y; Harrus, S\n\n2015-06-01\n\nSeveral species of the spotted fever group rickettsiae have been identified as emerging pathogens throughout the world, including in Africa. In this study, 197 Hyalomma ticks (Ixodida: Ixodidae) collected from 51 camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Kano, northern Nigeria, were screened by amplification and sequencing of the citrate synthase (gltA), outer membrane protein A (ompA) and 17-kDa antigen gene fragments. Rickettsia sp. gltA fragments were detected in 43.3% (42/97) of the tick pools tested. Rickettsial ompA gene fragments (189 bp and 630 bp) were detected in 64.3% (n = 27) and 23.8% (n = 10) of the gltA-positive tick pools by real-time and conventional polymerase chain reaction (PCR), respectively. The amplicons were 99-100% identical to Rickettsia aeschlimannii TR/Orkun-H and R.âaeschlimannii strain EgyRickHimp-El-Arish in GenBank. Furthermore, 17-kDa antigen gene fragments of 214 bp and 265 bp were detected in 59.5% (n = 25) and 38.1% (n = 16), respectively, of tick pools, and sequences were identical to one another and 99-100% identical to those of the R.âaeschlimannii strain Ibadan A1 in GenBank. None of the Hyalomma impressum ticks collected were positive for Rickettsia sp. DNA. Rickettsia sp. gltA fragments (133 bp) were detected in 18.8% of camel blood samples, but all samples were negative for the other genes targeted. This is the first report to describe the molecular detection of R.âaeschlimannii in Hyalomma spp. ticks from camels in Nigeria.

The aim of this study was the first genetic analysis of B. melitensis strains isolated from dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) using multiple-locus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). MLVA 16 and its MLVA 8 and MLVA11 subsets were used to determine the genotypes of 15 B. melitensis isolates from dromedary camels (11 strains) and other host species (4 strains) from the United Arab Emirates and the results were then compared to B. melitensis MLVA genotypes from other parts of the world. Five, including two novel genotypes were identified with MLVA 8. MLVA 16 further discriminated these five genotypes to ten variants. The eleven camel isolates clustered into four main genetic groups within the East-Mediterranean and African clades and this clustering correlated with the geographic origin of the hosts (United Arab Emirates, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and Sudan) and the date of their isolation. The camel strains were also genetically related to strains isolated from wild and domestic ruminants from their close habitat or from other parts of the world. Although limited number of strains were analysed, based on our data imported animals from foreign countries, local small ruminants and wildlife species are hypothesized to be the main sources of camel brucellosis in the United Arab Emirates. MLVA was successfully applied to determine the epidemiological links between the different camel B. melitensis infections in the United Arab Emirates and it can be a beneficial tool in future disease control programs.

Cartilage from 4 carpal joints of healthy adult dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius). Chondrocytes were evaluated for type II collagen and aggrecan production They were incubated with control media or with 2 test mixtures (alone and then in combination) that have anti-inflammatory activity (avocado-soybean unsaponifiables, glucosamine, and chondroitin sulfate [ie, ASU + GLU + CS] and pentosan polysulfate and N-acetyl glucosamine [ie, PPS + NG]). Cells were then stimulated with interleukin-1Î² and tumor necrosis factor-Î± to determine prostaglandin (PG) Eâ production and nuclear factor (NF)-ÎºB activation. Chondrocytes proliferated in media used for propagating equine chondrocytes; they produced type II collagen and aggrecan. Cytokine stimulation induced PGEâ production and translocation of NF-ÎºB. Incubation with each test mixture significantly inhibited PGEâ production. The combination of ASU + GLU + CS and PPS + NG significantly potentiated PGEâ inhibition and disrupted NF-ÎºB translocation, compared with effects for either mixture alone. Chondrocytes proliferated without loss of the cartilage phenotype. Responses to cytokines were significantly inhibited by the mixtures of ASU + GLU + CS and PPS + NG, which indicated that this response can be modulated. This culture technique can be used to study the functional properties of camel chondrocytes and identify agents that may potentially be used to treat and manage joint inflammation.\n\nSequencing, Analysis, and Annotation of Expressed Sequence Tags for Camelus dromedarius\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAl-Swailem, Abdulaziz M.; Shehata, Maher M.; Abu-Duhier, Faisel M.; Al-Yamani, Essam J.; Al-Busadah, Khalid A.; Al-Arawi, Mohammed S.; Al-Khider, Ali Y.; Al-Muhaimeed, Abdullah N.; Al-Qahtani, Fahad H.; Manee, Manee M.; Al-Shomrani, Badr M.; Al-Qhtani, Saad M.; Al-Harthi, Amer S.; Akdemir, Kadir C.; Otu, Hasan H.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nDespite its economical, cultural, and biological importance, there has not been a large scale sequencing project to date for Camelus dromedarius. With the goal of sequencing complete DNA of the organism, we first established and sequenced camel EST libraries, generating 70,272 reads. Following trimming, chimera check, repeat masking, cluster and assembly, we obtained 23,602 putative gene sequences, out of which over 4,500 potentially novel or fast evolving gene sequences do not carry any homology to other available genomes. Functional annotation of sequences with similarities in nucleotide and protein databases has been obtained using Gene Ontology classification. Comparison to available full length cDNA sequences and Open Reading Frame (ORF) analysis of camel sequences that exhibit homology to known genes show more than 80% of the contigs with an ORF>300 bp and â¼40% hits extending to the start codons of full length cDNAs suggesting successful characterization of camel genes. Similarity analyses are done separately for different organisms including human, mouse, bovine, and rat. Accompanying web portal, CAGBASE (http://camel.kacst.edu.sa/), hosts a relational database containing annotated EST sequences and analysis tools with possibility to add sequences from public domain. We anticipate our results to provide a home base for genomic studies of camel and other comparative studies enabling a starting point for whole genome sequencing of the organism.

The in vitro maturation (IVM) technology is a fundamental step for in vitro embryo production (IVP), and its optimization could represent a way to increase the success rate of IVP. The aim of the present study was to investigate the bioenergy/oxidative status of dromedary camel oocytes before and after IVM by confocal microscopy 3D imaging. Oocytes were retrieved by slicing ovaries collected at local slaughterhouses. Recovered oocytes were examined before and after IVM culture for nuclear chromatin configuration and bioenergy/oxidative status, expressed as mitochondria (mt) distribution and activity, intracellular Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels and distribution and mt/ROS colocalization. The mean recovery rate was 6 oocytes/ovary. After IVM, 61% of oocytes resumed meiosis and 36% reached the Metaphase II stage (MII). Oocyte bioenergy/redox confocal characterization revealed changes upon meiosis progression. Immature oocytes at the germinal vesicle (GV) stage were characterised by prevailing homogeneous mt distribution in small aggregates while MI and MII oocytes showed significantly higher rates of pericortical mt distribution organized in tubular networks (P<0.05). Increased mt activity in MI (P<0.001) and MII (P<0.01) oocytes compared to GV stage oocytes was also observed. At any meiotic stage, homogeneous distribution of intracellular ROS was observed. Intracellular ROS levels also increased in MI (P<0.01) and MII (P<0.05) oocytes compared to GV stage oocytes. The mt/ROS colocalization signal increased in MI oocytes (P<0.05). This study provides indications that qualitative and quantitative indicators of bioenergy and oxidative status in dromedary camel oocytes are modified in relation with oocyte meiotic stage. These data may increase the knowledge of camel oocyte physiology, in order to enhance the efficiency of IVP procedures.\n\nUrinary excretion of purine derivatives as an index of microbial protein synthesis in the camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nGuerouali, Abdelhai; El Gass, Youssef; Balcells, Joaquim; Belenguer, Alvaro; Nolan, John\n\n2004-08-01\n\nFive experiments were carried out to extend knowledge of purine metabolism in the camel (Camelus dromedarius) and to establish a model to enable microbial protein outflow from the forestomachs to be estimated from the urinary excretion of purine derivatives (PD; i.e. xanthine, hypoxanthine, uric acid, allantoin). In experiment 1, four camels were fasted for five consecutive days to enable endogenous PD excretion in urine to be determined. Total PD excretion decreased during the fasting period to 267 (SE 41.5) micromol/kg body weight (W)0.75 per d. Allantoin and xanthine + hypoxanthine were consistently 86 and 6.1 % of total urinary PD during this period but uric acid increased from 3.6 % to 7.4 %. Xanthine oxidase activity in tissues (experiment 2) was (micromol/min per g fresh tissue) 0.038 in liver and 0.005 in gut mucosa but was not detected in plasma. In experiment 3, the duodenal supply of yeast containing exogenous purines produced a linear increase in urinary PD excretion rate with the slope indicating that 0.63 was excreted in urine. After taking account of endogenous PD excretion, the relationship can be used to predict purine outflow from the rumen. From the latter prediction, and also the purine:protein ratio in bacteria determined in experiment 5, we predicted the net microbial outflow from the rumen. In experiment 4, with increasing food intake, the rate of PD excretion in the urine increased linearly by about 11.1 mmol PD/kg digestible organic matter intake (DOMI), equivalent to 95 g microbial protein/kg DOMI.\n\nEvaluation of medetomidine-ketamine and medetomidine-ketamine-butorphanol for the field anesthesia of free-ranging dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Australia.\n\nPubMed\n\nBoardman, Wayne S J; Lethbridge, Mark R; Hampton, Jordan O; Smith, Ian; Woolnough, Andrew P; McEwen, Margaret-Mary; Miller, Graham W J; Caraguel, Charles G B\n\n2014-10-01\n\nAbstract We report the clinical course and physiologic and anesthetic data for a case series of 76 free-ranging dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius) chemically restrained, by remote injection from a helicopter, in the rangelands of Western Australia and South Australia, 2008-11, to attach satellite-tracking collars. Fifty-five camels were successfully anesthetized using medetomidine-ketamine (MK, n=27) and medetomidine-ketamine-butorphanol (MKB, n=28); the induction of anesthesia in 21 animals was considered unsuccessful. To produce reliable anesthesia for MK, medetomidine was administered at 0.22 mg/kg (Â± SD=0.05) and ketamine at 2.54 mg/kg (Â± 0.56), and for MKB, medetomidine was administered at 0.12 mg/kg (Â± 0.05), ketamine at 2.3 mg/kg (Â± 0.39), and butorphanol at 0.05 mg/kg (Â± 0.02). Median time-to-recumbency for MKB (8.5 min) was 2.5 min shorter than for MK (11 min) (P=0.13). For MK, the reversal atipamezole was administered at 0.24 mg/kg (Â± 0.10), and for MKB, atipamezole was administered at 0.23 mg/kg (Â± 0.13) and naltrexone at 0.17 mg/kg (Â± 0.16). Median time-to-recovery was 1 min shorter for MK (5 min) than MKB (6 min; P=0.02). Physiologic parameters during recumbency were not clinically different between the two regimes. Both regimes were suitable to safely anesthetize free-ranging camels; however, further investigation is required to find the safest, most consistent, and logistically practical combination.\n\nA review of sarcocystosis in camels and redescription of Sarcocystis cameli and Sarcocystis ippeni sarcocysts from the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nDubey, J P; Hilali, M; Van Wilpe, E; Calero-Bernal, R; Verma, S K; Abbas, I E\n\n2015-10-01\n\nThere is considerable confusion concerning Sarcocystis species in camels. Five species: Sarcocystis cameli, Sarcocystis ippeni, Sarcocystis camelicanis, Sarcocystis camelocanis and Sarcocystis miescheri were named with inadequate descriptions and no type specimens. Here, we review literature on sarcocystosis in camels worldwide and redescribe structure of S. cameli and S. ippeni sarcocysts by light- and transmission electron microscopy (LM and TEM). Eight sarcocysts from the oesophagi of two camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Egypt were studied. By LM, all sarcocysts were thin-walled with barely visible projections on the cyst walls. By TEM, two structurally distinct sarcocysts were recognized by unique villar protrusions (vp) not found in sarcocysts from any other host. Sarcocysts of S. cameli had vp of type 9 j. The sarcocyst wall had upright slender vp, up to 3.0 ÂµM long and 0.5 ÂµM wide; the total thickness of the sarcocyst wall with ground substance (gs) layer was 3.5 ÂµM. On each vp, there were rows of knob-like protrusions that appeared to be interconnected. The vp had microtubules that originated at midpoint of the gs and continued up to the tip; microtubules were smooth, without any granules or dense areas. Bradyzoites were approximately 14-15 Ã 3-4 ÂµM in size with typical organelles. Sarcocystis ippeni sarcocysts had type 32 sarcocyst wall characterized by conical vp with an electron dense knob. The total thickness of the sarcocyst wall (from the base of gs to vp tip) was 2.3-3.0 ÂµM. The vp were up to 1.2 ÂµM wide at the base and 0.25 ÂµM at the tip. Microtubules in vp originated at midpoint of gs and continued up to tip; microtubules were criss-crossed, smooth and without granules or dense areas. Bradyzoites were 12.0-13.5 Ã 2.0-3.0 ÂµM in size. Sarcocystis camelicanis, S. camelocanis and S. miescheri are considered invalid.\n\nMolecular Cloning and 3D Structure Modeling of APEX1, DNA Base Excision Repair Enzyme from the Camel, Camelus dromedarius\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAtaya, Farid Shokry; Fouad, Dalia; Malik, Ajamaluddin; Saeed, Hesham Mahmoud\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThe domesticated one-humped camel, Camelus dromedarius, is one of the most important animals in the Arabian Desert. It is exposed most of its life to both intrinsic and extrinsic genotoxic factors that are known to cause gross DNA alterations in many organisms. Ionic radiation and sunlight are known producers of Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), one of the causes for DNA lesions. The damaged DNA is repaired by many enzymes, among of them Base Excision Repair enzymes, producing the highly mutagenic apurinic/apyrimidinicsites (AP sites). Therefore, recognition of AP sites is fundamental to cell/organism survival. In the present work, the full coding sequence of a putative cAPEX1 gene was amplified for the first time from C. dromedarius by RT-PCR and cloned (NCBI accession number are HM209828 and ADJ96599 for nucleotides and amino acids, respectively). cDNA sequencing was deduced to be 1041 nucleotides, of which 954 nucleotides encode a protein of 318 amino acids, similar to the coding region of the APEX1 gene and the protein from many other species. The calculated molecular weight and isoelectric point of cAPEX1 using Bioinformatics tools was 35.5 kDa and 8.11, respectively. The relative expressions of cAPEX1 in camel kidney, spleen, lung and testis were examined using qPCR and compared with that of the liver using a 18S ribosomal subunit as endogenous control. The highest level of cAPEX1 transcript was found in the testis; 325% higher than the liver, followed by spleen (87%), kidney (20%) and lung (5%), respectively. The cAPEX1 is 94%â97% similar to their mammalian counterparts. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that cAPEX1 is grouped together with that of S. scrofa. The predicted 3D structure of cAPEX1 has similar folds and topology with the human (hAPEX1). The root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) between cAPEX1 and hAPEX1 was 0.582 and the Q-score was 0.939.

Dermatophilosis was diagnosed in 14 (13.6%) of the studied camels. Grossly, patchy thickening of the skin with dark brown scabs or crusts were observed on the rump, flanks, abdomen, shoulders, and neck. A heavy infestation with brown hard ticks was present on the lesions in almost all of the affected camels. On parasitology examination, all the ticks were identified as Hyalomma spp. Histopathologic examination of the affected skins revealed prominent superficial thickening of the epidermis as orthokeratotic and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis, degenerating neutrophils, serous fluid, and bacterial filaments. A lot of keratinaceous debris associated with an exudate rich in neutrophils were seen as remarkable features of the lesions on the superficial epidermis. Dermal inflammation was mild with infiltration of mononuclear inflammatory cells, particularly lymphocytes, around superficial vessels. A Gram-positive filamentous organism which was divided into parallel rows of cocci was observed in the crusts by Brown and Brenn Gram stain. This is the first report of the occurrence of dermatophilosis in the camels of Iran. With regard to infestation of the lesions by Hyalomma spp., it seems that this tick may have an important role in the pathogenesis of dermatophilosis in the camels of this region.\n\nEffect of progesterone from induced corpus luteum on the characteristics of a dominant follicle in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nManjunatha, B M; David, C G; Pratap, N; Al-Bulushi, Samir; Hago, B E\n\n2012-06-01\n\nThe present study was carried out to elucidate the effect of progesterone (P4) from the induced corpus luteum (CL) on the characteristics of the dominant follicle (DF) in dromedary camels (Camelus dromedarius). Ovarian follicular and induced CL dynamics were monitored by transrectal ultrasonography in eight camels during the peak breeding season. The characteristics of the DF were monitored daily from the day of emergence into a wave, until it appeared to lose its dominance and the DF of a subsequent wave grew to a diameter of 13-17 mm. At this stage ovulation was induced by hCG and the DF was monitored every 8 h for 48 h. After ovulation, CL dynamics and follicular development (emergence of a new wave, growth and mature phase of the selected DF) were monitored daily. Blood samples were collected during each ultrasound examination to study the P4 profile in these animals. The CL developed to a maximum size (22.55 Â± 3.24 mm) with a peak concentration of P4 (4.60 Â± 2.57 ng/ml) 7 days a"
