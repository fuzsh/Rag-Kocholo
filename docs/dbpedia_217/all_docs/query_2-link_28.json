        "text": "The great Claudio Abbado in rehearsal with the Berliner Philharmoniker on the differences between one conductor and another, the great Herbert von Karajan and the way the PEOPLE/the orchestra/the organisation are reacting to the different way of interpretation of the well-known notes. This is in essences, the differences in how we humans do music (non-optimality expressive) and the way algorithms do it. Is your organisation an organisation of robots or humans?!? https://lnkd.in/d-uqxNGY\n\nWe cannot look at this issue without talking about the current dominant economic system. Neoliberalism was not only an economic revolution, but a social and cultural one as well. At its hart it places the image of man as a strong, independent, (economically) successful, self-made individual; opposed to it the unfortunate, poor and those who are in need. This have played people apart and have made acting selflessness suspicious. It's not surprising that the domain of culture/art - which is all about social interaction, connect and share - greatly suffered under this. Yes, education plays a key role in the survival of culture, classical music no exception. Like every cultural expression it will face oblivion when its rituals are no longer practised and passed on the next generation. But the real question here should be 'what made us as society, to neglect our culture and its rituals?'. Perhaps we should shake-off the neo-liberal image of man and seek for a more true and positive one - less ego more care and love.\n\nðŸŽ‰ Today marks the 200th anniversary of the premiere of the \"Ode to Joy\" from Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. This is the #EuropeanAnthem. The #CouncilofEurope adopted it in 1972 and the #EuropeanUnion in 1985. Since then, this melody has helped us to be inspired by the shared #EuropeanValues of #peace or #solidarity. In short, this is an anthem for the whole of #DemocraticEurope. ðŸŽ¶ More #versions of this Anthem can be listened to at this link: https://lnkd.in/dNwC7SpM #Europe #Europa #EuropeanUnion #UnionEuropea #ConsejodeEuropa #OdeToJoy #HimnodelaAlegria #EuropeaConvencida"
