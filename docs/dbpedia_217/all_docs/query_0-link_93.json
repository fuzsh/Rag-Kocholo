        "text": "Contemporary urban design, as well as sustainable development calls, pays serious attention to the notion of identity in the urban context. In this regard, this thesis studies the urban identity in Cairo. Globalization and the rapid growth of cities have caused a lack of sense of identity in images of cities as most of them have become similar, repetitive, and monotonous, without meaningful places for people to enjoy the experience of being in them. Identity has become an essential topic on the agendas of planners and designers. Today, the recent monumental urbanization changes in Egyptian cities raise concerns about the identity of their public places, especially in Cairo, the capital of Egypt. So, the urban identity of Cairo, more than other cities, needs an updated study. Since identity is affected by the place's culture and the nature of the people in it, this study focuses on public places in administrative areas of Greater Cairo. This study literature provided a deep recognition of place identity definitions by opting for the inductive method of literature and research articles discussing several factors and elements that identify place identity. This study used the descriptive-analytical approach to analyze, compare, and explore the collected information on place identity to present a checklist for place identity components. This checklist divides the identity of the place into three axes: Environment, people, and the interaction between them, under two primary classifications: tangible and intangible. The checklist was validated by surveying experts' opinions on the importance of these components in creating a place's identity. Afterward, the paper empirically analyzed the checklist of place identity components by assessing two case studies. As identity is affected by the place's culture and the nature of the people in it, this paper focused on public places in administrative areas in Greater Cairo. The two case studies were selected based on three conditions: classified as a public place, located in an administrative area, and existing in the Greater Cairo Region. According to these requirements, the Ministries Square in the downtown area of khedivial Cairo and the governmental district in the new administrative capital were picked. The identity of public places in the case studies was examined according to the checklist of place identity components extracted from the theoretical study. The field study relied on three sources of data; archives and available documents of those places, site visits (observation), and interviews with experts. According to the results, this study identified the strengths and weaknesses in each assessment category, then presented Identity Enhancing Strategies (IES) to enhance identity. The findings came in three categories, environment-related strategies, people-related strategies, and strategies for the relationship between the place and its people. Finally, the conclusion states the whole process of the study and spots the significant factors that form the identity of the place. It also presents strategies for enhancing the sense of identity of public places in the administrative areas of Greater Cairo to the officials and decision-makers. After that, the study refuted its limitations to clarify future studies in this field. The added value of this study is that its methodology can be followed to evaluate and develop other places with different functions and characteristics.

The fear of loss of individuality and distinctiveness between one place and another is increasing with the impact of globalization. This has caused much anxiety regarding the emergence of 'clone cities'. The concept of place identity refers to the relationship between place and identity. City identity and image could be recognized by analysing places attributes and types of activities that occur in it. Strategies for promoting environmental sustainability should necessitate encouraging processes of social cohesion. This paper aims to predict the impact of urban planning for new cities before implementing them on making a unique identity for new cities as one of the key urban design issues of contemporary cities. New Administrative Capital of Egypt is planned to be a smart city and after a few years, it will form its own distinct identity. The paper sheds light on the expected local identity of New Administrative Capital in Egypt by analyzing and evaluating the city's distinctive attributes.\n\nScholarly studies have enriched the definition and theory of place identity since the 1960s. These trends are becoming more prevalent in the urban setting. This is because place identity has become a common theme in many researches and design projects and a thriving theme in policies and regulations to achieve sustainable development. In this respect, it is necessary to review these studies to identify the points of intersection and present updated evidence that incorporates the most relevant approaches. In this context, literature provides a deep understanding of place identity definitions through literature and research articles that discuss many factors and elements that identify place identity. This review divided the data into definitions, types, layers, levels, forms, features, dimensions, principles, and elements. Based on the research objective to present a reliable tool to measure the sense of identity in public places, the study used the descriptive-analytical approach to analyze, compare, and explore the collected information on place identity to present a matrix for evaluating place identity. According to the matrix, identity can be categorized into three axes: environment, people, and interaction; under two primary classifications: tangible and intangible. The findings confirmed a network of elements that were coded and defined. Parcel \"elements\" are evaluated by grouping them into three groups according to their contribution: positive element contribution, negative contribution, and neutral or non-contributing element. Based on the matrix checklist proposed as part of the evaluation strategy, the outcome indicates the extent of the place's senses of identity. The suggested matrix could be used to compare different places' sense of identity, and accordingly, the places could be developed based on these results.\n\nhttps://www.ijert.org/promoting-cultural-identity-along-streetscape-redesign-case-studies-in-cairo-and-luxor-cities-egypt https://www.ijert.org/research/promoting-cultural-identity-along-streetscape-redesign-case-studies-in-cairo-and-luxor-cities-egypt-IJERTV4IS051101.pdf In the recent decades, many approaches, trends, and visions had been introduced and applied for promoting and revitalizing cultural identity in the historic cities. The debates of interventions, policies, and implementation plans, are the essential community challenges. Most of strategies focused on local spines and main streets as the most priorities urban level for revitalizing action plans. Streetscape is an immediate vista of the city that people grasp and create the general image and identity of the city. A creative community vision can continuously evolve and embrace new ideas while balancing the inherent conflicting nature of past, present, and future community values and culture. Through this vision the paper adopts the streetscape redesign as an urban aspect to reinforce and embrace the cultural identity and urban character of the historic cities. The paper aims at analyzing the urban design principles for preserving and enhancing the local identity, uniqueness, and cultural assets of a community regarding in downtown main streets. It presents a proposal of practical framework for streetscape redesign through three phases, which can be applied in local streets in the historic cities. The framework produces redesign principles that reflect and support community character revitalization. The paper methodology depends on: 1. Theoretical approach; analyzing thoughts of streetscape redesign and cultural identity relationship and concluding a practical framework identifying the main phases to redesign process. 2. Practical approach; analyzing two different case studies of main streets in the Egyptian cities, evaluating the outputs and results. The paper concludes that the streetscape redesign have a vital role for conserving and promoting cultural identity of the historic cities.\n\nThe city square is the best interaction point between various inhabitants and the city. It is the place where urban identity is well grasped. This study aimed to understand if it is important to have urban identity characteristics to be a successful public place, or not. Therefore, urban identity and public place terms analyzed in the notion of identity and the notion of place. The significance of the city square emerged as a connection between urban identity and public place. To clarify the importance of the urban identity characteristics in successful public places, Or-taköy Square is chosen for the case study. The study area is a public place that the richness of urban identity characteristics was defined in the researches before. In this study the relationship between urban identity, public place and citizens was explained by using the methods which are literature research and photo-analysis. According to these analysis, it is proved that Ortaköy Square is a successful public place. Binding on the studies before, urban identity characteristics were pointed out. Ortaköy Square has all the components to reflect urban identity. It is cleared that urban identity is a necessity to be a successful public place and it exists especially in city squares."
