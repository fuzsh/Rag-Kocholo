        "text": "Introduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nThe regularity and richness of the annual Nile River flood, coupled with semi-isolation provided by deserts to the east and west, allowed for the development of one of the world's great civilizations. A unified kingdom arose circa 3200 B.C., and a series of dynasties ruled in Egypt for the next three millennia. The last native dynasty fell to the Persians in 341 B.C., who in turn were replaced by the Greeks, Romans, and Byzantines. It was the Arabs who introduced Islam and the Arabic language in the 7th century and who ruled for the next six centuries. A local military caste, the Mamluks took control about 1250 and continued to govern after the conquest of Egypt by the Ottoman Turks in 1517. Completion of the Suez Canal in 1869 elevated Egypt as an important world transportation hub. Ostensibly to protect its investments, Britain seized control of Egypt's government in 1882, but nominal allegiance to the Ottoman Empire continued until 1914. Partially independent from the UK in 1922, Egypt acquired full sovereignty from Britain in 1952. The completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1971 and the resultant Lake Nasser have reaffirmed the time-honored place of the Nile River in the agriculture and ecology of Egypt. A rapidly growing population (the largest in the Arab world), limited arable land, and dependence on the Nile all continue to overtax resources and stress society. The government has struggled to meet the demands of Egypt's fast-growing population as it implements far-reaching economic reforms, including the reduction of select subsidies, large-scale infrastructure projects, energy cooperation, and foreign direct investment appeals.Inspired by the 2010 Tunisian revolution, Egyptian opposition groups led demonstrations and labor strikes countrywide, culminating in President Hosni MUBARAK's ouster in 2011. Egypt's military assumed national leadership until a new legislature was in place in early 2012; later that same year, Muhammad MURSI won the presidential election. Following protests throughout the spring of 2013 against MURSI's government and the Muslim Brotherhood, the Egyptian Armed Forces intervened and removed MURSI from power in July 2013 and replaced him with interim president Adly MANSOUR. Simultaneously, the government began enacting laws to limit freedoms of assembly and expression. In January 2014, voters approved a new constitution by referendum and in May 2014 elected former defense minister Abdelfattah ELSISI president. Egypt elected a new legislature in December 2015, its first Hose of Representatives since 2012. ELSISI was reelected to a second four-year term in March 2018. In April 2019, Egypt approved via national referendum a set of constitutional amendments extending ELSISI’s term in office through 2024 and possibly through 2030 if re-elected for a third term. The amendments would also allow future presidents up to two consecutive six-year terms in office, re-establish an upper legislative house, allow for one or more vice presidents, establish a 25% quota for female legislators, reaffirm the military’s role as guardian of Egypt, and expand presidential authority to appoint the heads of judicial councils.\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nGeography\n\nLocation\n\nNorthern Africa, bordering the Mediterranean Sea, between Libya and the Gaza Strip, and the Red Sea north of Sudan, and includes the Asian Sinai Peninsula\n\nGeographic coordinates\n\n27 00 N, 30 00 E\n\nMap references\n\nAfrica\n\nArea\n\ntotal: 1,001,450 sq km\n\nland: 995,450 sq km\n\nwater: 6,000 sq km\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 31\n\nArea - comparative\n\nmore than eight times the size of Ohio; slightly more than three times the size of New Mexico\n\nLand boundaries\n\ntotal: 2,612 km\n\nborder countries (4): Gaza Strip 13 km, Israel 208 km, Libya 1115 km, Sudan 1276 km\n\nCoastline\n\n2,450 km\n\nMaritime claims\n\nterritorial sea: 12nm\n\nexclusive economic zone: 200nm or the equidistant median line with Cyprus\n\ncontiguous zone: 24nm\n\ncontinental shelf: 200nm\n\nClimate\n\ndesert; hot, dry summers with moderate winters\n\nTerrain\n\nvast desert plateau interrupted by Nile valley and delta\n\nElevation\n\nmean elevation: 321 m\n\nlowest point: Qattara Depression -133 m\n\nhighest point: Mount Catherine 2,629 m\n\nNatural resources\n\npetroleum, natural gas, iron ore, phosphates, manganese, limestone, gypsum, talc, asbestos, lead, rare earth elements, zinc\n\nLand use\n\nagricultural land: 3.6% (2011 est.)\n\narable land: 2.8% (2011 est.)/permanent crops: 0.8% (2011 est.)/permanent pasture: 0% (2011 est.)\n\nforest: 0.1% (2011 est.)\n\nother: 96.3% (2011 est.)\n\nIrrigated land\n\n36,500 sq km (2012)\n\nPopulation distribution\n\napproximately 95% of the population lives within 20 km of the Nile River and its delta; vast areas of the country remain sparsely populated or uninhabited\n\nNatural hazards\n\nperiodic droughts; frequent earthquakes; flash floods; landslides; hot, driving windstorms called khamsin occur in spring; dust storms; sandstorms\n\nEnvironment - current issues\n\nagricultural land being lost to urbanization and windblown sands; increasing soil salination below Aswan High Dam; desertification; oil pollution threatening coral reefs, beaches, and marine habitats; other water pollution from agricultural pesticides, raw sewage, and industrial effluents; limited natural freshwater resources away from the Nile, which is the only perennial water source; rapid growth in population overstraining the Nile and natural resources\n\nEnvironment - international agreements\n\nparty to: Biodiversity, Climate Change, Climate Change-Kyoto Protocol, Desertification, Endangered Species, Environmental Modification, Hazardous Wastes, Law of the Sea, Marine Dumping, Ozone Layer Protection, Ship Pollution, Tropical Timber 83, Tropical Timber 94, Wetlands\n\nsigned, but not ratified: none of the selected agreements\n\nGeography - note\n\ncontrols Sinai Peninsula, the only land bridge between Africa and remainder of Eastern Hemisphere; controls Suez Canal, a sea link between Indian Ocean and Mediterranean Sea; size, and juxtaposition to Israel, establish its major role in Middle Eastern geopolitics; dependence on upstream neighbors; dominance of Nile basin issues; prone to influxes of refugees from Sudan and the Palestinian territories\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPeople and Society\n\nPopulation\n\n99,413,317 (July 2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 14\n\nNationality\n\nnoun: Egyptian(s)\n\nadjective: Egyptian\n\nEthnic groups\n\nEgyptian 99.7%, other 0.3% (2006 est.)\n\nnote: data represent respondents by nationality\n\nLanguages\n\nArabic (official), Arabic, English, and French widely understood by educated classes\n\nReligions\n\nMuslim (predominantly Sunni) 90%, Christian (majority Coptic Orthodox, other Christians include Armenian Apostolic, Catholic, Maronite, Orthodox, and Anglican) 10% (2015 est.)\n\nDemographic profile\n\nEgypt is the most populous country in the Arab world and the third most populous country in Africa, behind Nigeria and Ethiopia. Most of the country is desert, so about 95% of the population is concentrated in a narrow strip of fertile land along the Nile River, which represents only about 5% of Egypt’s land area. Egypt’s rapid population growth – 46% between 1994 and 2014 – stresses limited natural resources, jobs, housing, sanitation, education, and health care.Although the country’s total fertility rate (TFR) fell from roughly 5.5 children per woman in 1980 to just over 3 in the late 1990s, largely as a result of state-sponsored family planning programs, the population growth rate dropped more modestly because of decreased mortality rates and longer life expectancies. During the last decade, Egypt’s TFR decline stalled for several years and then reversed, reaching 3.6 in 2011, and has plateaued the last few years. Contraceptive use has held steady at about 60%, while preferences for larger families and early marriage may have strengthened in the wake of the recent 2011 revolution. The large cohort of women of or nearing childbearing age will sustain high population growth for the foreseeable future (an effect called population momentum).Nevertheless, post-MUBARAK governments have not made curbing population growth a priority. To increase contraceptive use and to prevent further overpopulation will require greater government commitment and substantial social change, including encouraging smaller families and better educating and empowering women. Currently, literacy, educational attainment, and labor force participation rates are much lower for women than men. In addition, the prevalence of violence against women, the lack of female political representation, and the perpetuation of the nearly universal practice of female genital cutting continue to keep women from playing a more significant role in Egypt’s public sphere.Population pressure, poverty, high unemployment, and the fragmentation of inherited land holdings have historically motivated Egyptians, primarily young men, to migrate internally from rural and smaller urban areas in the Nile Delta region and the poorer rural south to Cairo, Alexandria, and other urban centers in the north, while a much smaller number migrated to the Red Sea and Sinai areas. Waves of forced internal migration also resulted from the 1967 Arab-Israeli War and the floods caused by the completion of the Aswan High Dam in 1970. Limited numbers of students and professionals emigrated temporarily prior to the early 1970s, when economic problems and high unemployment pushed the Egyptian Government to lift restrictions on labor migration. At the same time, high oil revenues enabled Saudi Arabia, Iraq, and other Gulf states, as well as Libya and Jordan, to fund development projects, creating a demand for unskilled labor (mainly in construction), which attracted tens of thousands of young Egyptian men.Between 1970 and 1974 alone, Egyptian migrants in the Gulf countries increased from approximately 70,000 to 370,000. Egyptian officials encouraged legal labor migration both to alleviate unemployment and to generate remittance income (remittances continue to be one of Egypt’s largest sources of foreign currency and GDP). During the mid-1980s, however, depressed oil prices resulting from the Iran-Iraq War, decreased demand for low-skilled labor, competition from less costly South Asian workers, and efforts to replace foreign workers with locals significantly reduced Egyptian migration to the Gulf States. The number of Egyptian migrants dropped from a peak of almost 3.3 million in 1983 to about 2.2 million at the start of the 1990s, but numbers gradually recovered.In the 2000s, Egypt began facilitating more labor migration through bilateral agreements, notably with Arab countries and Italy, but illegal migration to Europe through overstayed visas or maritime human smuggling via Libya also rose. The Egyptian Government estimated there were 6.5 million Egyptian migrants in 2009, with roughly 75% being temporary migrants in other Arab countries (Libya, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates) and 25% being predominantly permanent migrants in the West (US, UK, Italy, France, and Canada).During the 2000s, Egypt became an increasingly important transit and destination country for economic migrants and asylum seekers, including Palestinians, East Africans, and South Asians and, more recently, Iraqis and Syrians. Egypt draws many refugees because of its resettlement programs with the West; Cairo has one of the largest urban refugee populations in the world. Many East African migrants are interned or live in temporary encampments along the Egypt-Israel border, and some have been shot and killed by Egyptian border guards.\n\nAge structure\n\n0-14 years: 33.38%(male 17,177,977 /female 16,007,877)\n\n15-24 years: 18.65%(male 9,551,309 /female 8,988,006)\n\n25-54 years: 37.71%(male 19,053,300 /female 18,431,808)\n\n55-64 years: 5.99%(male 2,956,535 /female 2,995,497)\n\n65 years and over: 4.28%(male 2,058,217 /female 2,192,791) (2018 est.)\n\npopulation pyramid:\n\nDependency ratios\n\ntotal dependency ratio: 61.8 (2015 est.)\n\nyouth dependency ratio: 53.6 (2015 est.)\n\nelderly dependency ratio: 8.2 (2015 est.)\n\npotential support ratio: 12.2 (2015 est.)\n\nMedian age\n\ntotal: 23.9 years (2018 est.)\n\nmale: 23.6 years\n\nfemale: 24.3 years\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 167\n\nPopulation growth rate\n\n2.38% (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 28\n\nBirth rate\n\n28.8 births/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 42\n\nDeath rate\n\n4.5 deaths/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 204\n\nNet migration rate\n\n-0.4 migrant(s)/1,000 population (2018 est.)\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 122\n\nPopulation distribution\n\napproximately 95% of the population lives within 20 km of the Nile River and its delta;

Egypt's economy was highly centralized during the rule of former President Gamal Abdel NASSER but opened up considerably under former Presidents Anwar EL-SADAT and Mohamed Hosni MUBARAK. Agriculture, hydrocarbons, manufacturing, tourism, and other service sectors drove the country’s relatively diverse economic activity.Despite Egypt’s mixed record for attracting foreign investment over the past two decades, poor living conditions and limited job opportunities have contributed to public discontent. These socioeconomic pressures were a major factor leading to the January 2011 revolution that ousted MUBARAK. The uncertain political, security, and policy environment since 2011 has restricted economic growth and failed to alleviate persistent unemployment, especially among the young.In late 2016, persistent dollar shortages and waning aid from its Gulf allies led Cairo to turn to the IMF for a 3-year, $12 billion loan program. To secure the deal, Cairo floated its currency, introduced new taxes, and cut energy subsidies - all of which pushed inflation above 30% for most of 2017, a high that had not been seen in a generation. Since the currency float, foreign investment in Egypt’s high interest treasury bills has risen exponentially, boosting both dollar availability and central bank reserves. Cairo will be challenged to obtain foreign and local investment in manufacturing and other sectors without a sustained effort to implement a range of business reforms.\n\nGDP (purchasing power parity)\n\n$1.204 trillion (2017 est.)\n\n$1.155 trillion (2016 est.)\n\n$1.107 trillion (2015 est.)\n\nnote: data are in 2017 dollars\n\ncountry comparison to the world: 21\n\nGDP (official exchange rate)\n\n$236.5 billion (2017 est.)\n\nGDP -
