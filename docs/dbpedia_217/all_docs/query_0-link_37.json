        "text": "The seroprevalence of Toxoplasma gondii infection among pregnant women in the Democratic Republic of Sao Tome and Principe (DRSTP) from November 2003 to March 2004 was determined by detection of serum anti-T. gondii antibodies. A short questionnaire interview for pregnant women was performed to investigate risk factors associated with T. gondii infection, including consumption of raw meat or unwashed vegetables, drinking unboiled water and keeping pets (cats and dogs). The overall seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was high (75.2%; 375/499). The older age group of > or =35 years had a significantly higher seroprevalence (85.7%; 54/63) than that of the younger age group of 15-25 years (70.4%; 178/253) (odds ratio 2.5, 95% CI 1.2-5.4; P=0.01). No significant difference in the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection was found between the pregnant women with and without exposure to the risk factors studied. However, among pregnant women with high antibody titers of > or =1:1024, it seemed likely that continual contact with pets and consumption of oocyst-contaminated water or raw unwashed vegetables rather than tissue cysts in meat was the primary route of infection. The incidence of congenital toxoplasmosis in unborn babies should be intensively monitored in the DRSTP.\n\nToxoplasma gondii (T. gondii) is a zoonotic infection that may be transmitted to human beings either by consumption of raw or uncooked meat or by ingesting oocysts. Toxoplasma organisms can cross blood placenta barrier and may result in congenital toxoplasmosis. About 80% of immunocompetent individuals do not show any clinical manifestations and are silent carriers of this disease. Pregnant women especially in highly prevalent areas are recommended to be screened for this disease in order to prevent the potential vertical transmission. To our knowledge no such study has been conducted in this region of Saudi Arabia. This study attempted to carry out two objectives: first, to find out the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in pregnant women attending prenatal care services in our hospital; second, to find out risk factors associated with T. gondii seroprevalence in our patients. It was carried out in Teaching Hospital in Al-Kharj over a period of one year. All 306 pregnant women attending antenatal clinic were involved in the study. A pretested self-explanatory questionnaire was filled out by the patients and their sera were collected to be tested for IgG and/or IgM against T. gondii. The results were then statistically analyzed using SPSS software and p-value was calculated using Pearson Chi Square test. Out of the 306 blood samples tested, 99 (32.4%) were seropositive for specific anti T. gondii IgG antibodies and 3(1%) were seropositive for IgM. This show that seroprevalence of T. gondii antibodies was high among pregnant women and the prevalence showed a significant association with age. The study recommends conducting educational programs to raise awareness among women about risk factors and precautions to be taken.\n\nTo identify the true contribution of toxoplasmosis to fetal loss and bad obstetric history, we tested 310 women, 77.4% of whom had had single or multiple fetal loss, for evidence of infection. The study was conducted in Duhok, northern Iraq, from July 2002 till September 2003. All the women were examined for the presence of toxoplasma-specific IgM antibodies by enzyme-linked immunofluorescent assay; only 3 (0.97%) tested positive. We also tested 187 of the women by latex agglutination test; 55 tested positive. Histopathological examination was done for 9 pregnant women who tested positive by the latex agglutination test but we found no evidence of toxoplasma infection. The results indicate that the contribution of toxoplasmosis to fetal loss in our region is greatly overestimated.\n\nThe aims of the study were: to estimate the prevalence of Toxoplasma gondii in pregnant women in the Lódź region; to assess the rate of incidence of suspected recent infection based on the results of the standard test for specific anty -T. gondii IgG and IgM antibodies. The study covered 1920 pregnant women served in 1998 by Toxoplasma Reference Laboratory in Lódź. T. gondii specific IgG and IgM were quantitated by an enzym-linked immunoabsorbent assay (ELISA, Organon). We have demonstrated high prevalence of T. gondii among pregnant women in the Lódź region. In the analysed sample of Polish population the T. gondii-specific IgG with negative IgM occurred in 43.4% (n = 837). In 1.42% of pregnant women IgG and IgM specific antibodies were detected.\n\nToxoplasma gondii is a protozoan parasite that is capable of causing a zoonotic disease, known as toxoplasmosis. Vertical transmission of T. gondii from the mother to the fetus, during pregnancy may cause severe complications to the developing fetus. This current study aimed to determine the seroprevalence and investigate the associated risk factors of Toxoplasma infection in pregnant women (n=219) visiting the antenatal clinic at UMMC. While the elevated level of anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies indicates the presence of infection, it fails to differentiate between a past and a recent infection. Thus, the study also demonstrates the usefulness of IgG avidity in validating the timing of infection. The serum samples were tested for the presence of anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies by ELISA test, and the seropositive samples for both anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies were further evaluated by IgG avidity. The results showed that the overall prevalence of T. gondii seropositivity was 34.7%. Of these, 30.6% (67/219) were positive for anti-Toxoplasma IgG antibody only, 2.3% (5/219) were positive for anti-Toxoplasma IgM only, and the remaining 1.8% (4/219) was positive for both anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibodies. All of the pregnant women who were positive for both anti-Toxoplasma IgG and IgM antibody were found to have past infection when evaluated by IgG avidity. In this study, Malay ethnicity and the number of existing previous children were significantly associated with T. gondii seropositivity (p<0.05). Based on these findings, information and education on the transmission and prevention of congenital toxoplasmosis are very crucial as a public health effort towards a healthier society."
