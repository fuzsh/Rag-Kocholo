One-humped camels are found in the western side of the Aegean region of our country and bred for wrestling. The aim of this study is the application of diagnosing systemic fungi infection from camel blood samples by the PCR method. In this study, specific primers for DNA topoisomerase II gene sequences were used. As a result, a systemic fungal infection was detected by the nested PCR method from 10 (20%) out of 50 DNA samples taken from camels located on the western side of the Aegean region. In this study, 3 (30%) samples were identified as Candida albicans, 3 (30%) samples were identified as C. glabrata, and 4 (40%) samples were identified as C. parapsilosis. In conclusion, the 20% positive systemic fungal infection rate in one-humped camels observed in the present study showed that the systemic fungal infections are not taken into considerations in veterinary medicine. Further studies are suggested in order to obtain and to maintain extensive data for systemic fungal diseases in our country for one-humped camels.\n\nTrypanosoma evansi infection and major risk factors for Iranian one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nMirshekar, Freshteh; Yakhchali, Mohammad; Shariati-Sharifi, Fariborz\n\n2017-09-01\n\nTrypanosoma evansi is a cosmopolitan protozoan which affects camelids and may cause illness and economic losses. The present study was aimed to determine the prevalence and geographic distribution of T . evansi in Iranian one-humped camels of South East Iran. A total of 369 camels were randomly examined from three parts of southeastern Iran from March to September 2015. Blood samples were taken from jugular vein and examined by using thin blood smear and mercuric chloride test. Ninety-five out of 369 examined camels (25.75%) with clinical signs (15.8%, 58/369) were found to be infected with T. evansi . The prevalence was significantly higher in camels more than 4Â years-old (23.3%) with clinical signs (8.8%) than the other ones. There was no significant difference between the prevalence and sex (6.23% male and 19.51% female). Trypanosoma evansi infection was geographically found in all investigated regions with the highest prevalence in North (17.61%). The results indicated that T. evansi infection was prevalent in Iranian one-humped camels which could be useful finding to lunch control programs in the region.\n\nEffect of simulated acid rain on nitrate and ammonium production in soils from three ecosystems of Camels Hump Mountain, Vermont\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nLike, D.E.; Klein, R.M.\n\n1985-11-01\n\nThe authors removed intact soil columns from the Harwood (550 to 790 m), Transition (790 to 1050 m), and Conifer (1050 to 1160 m) ecological zones of Camels Hump Mountain, Vermont, treated them with simulated acid rain (pH 4.0) or nonacidic (pH 5.6) rain, and examined the percolates for ammonium and nitrate ions. Nitrification in soils from all three ecosystems was unaffected by acidic treatments, but mineralization was stimulated by acidic treatment of soil from the Transition Zone. Irrespective of treatment, Conifer Zone soils released less nitrate than did either Transition or Hardwood Zone soils. Soil columns from the HardwoodmoreÂ Â» Zone were treated with acidic or nonacidic simulated rainfall supplemented with nitrate, ammonium, or both N sources. NO3-N in percolates increased when acidic simulated rain was supplemented with ammonium ion or both ammonium and nitrate ions. Efflux of NH4-N was unaffected by supplementing precipitation with either ammonium or nitrate ions.Â«Â less\n\nCrimean-Congo Hemorrhagic Fever in the One-Humped Camel (Camelus dromedarius) in East and Northeast of Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nChampour, Mohsen; Chinikar, Sadegh; Mohammadi, Gholamreza; Razmi, Gholamreza; Mostafavi, Ehsan; Shah-Hosseini, Nariman; Khakifirouz, Sahar; Jalali, Tahmineh\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground: This comprehensive study was conducted on multi-purpose one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) sera and ticks to assess the epidemiological aspects of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) in northeast Iran. Methods: From May 2012 to January 2013, eleven cities were randomly selected in the Khorasan Provinces of Iran as âclusters,â and at least 14 one-humped camels were sampled from each area. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of the CCHFV genome in ticks. Sera were analyzed using specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay tests. Results: Four hundred and eighty ixodid ticks were collected, and the genome of the CCHFV was detected in 49 (10.2%) out of 480 ticks. The CCHFV genome was detected in two out of four tick species, and in tick samples from three cities in Khorassan-e-Jonoobi. All three provinces, and six out of eleven cities, were CCHFV-specific IgG-positive. In total, nine (5.3%) out of 170 one-humped camels were IgG-positive. The highest rate of IgG-positive samples was found in Nehbandan (16.67%). Conclusion: Continued surveillance and strictly enforced importation and quarantine practices should be implemented to prevent human exposure and the on-going dispersal of infected ticks and livestock in these regions. It is recommended that acaricides be used to prevent CCHF transmission to humans, and to reduce the tick population. In addition, care should be taken by abattoirs workers and people who work with one-humped camels.

Ten genetic variants, or genotypes designated as (G1-G10), are distributed worldwide based on genetic diversity. The objective of this study was to provide some sequence data and phylogeny of EG isolates recovered from the Sudanese one-humped camel (Camelus dromedaries). Fifty samples of hydatid cysts were collected from the one- humped camels (Camelus dromedaries) at Taboul slaughter house, central Sudan. DNAs were extracted from protoscolices and/or associated germinal layers of hydatid cysts using a commercial kit. The mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (NADH1) gene and the cytochrome C oxidase subunit 1 (cox1) gene were used as targets for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification. The PCR products were purified and partial sequences were generated. Sequences were further examined by sequence analysis and subsequent phylogeny to compare these sequences to those from known strains of EG circulating globally. Results The identity of the PCR products were confirmed as NADH1 and cox1 nucleotide sequences using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) of NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD). The phylogenetic analysis showed that 98% (n = 49) of the isolates clustered with Echinococcus canadensis genotype 6 (G6), whereas only one isolate (2%) clustered with Echinococcus ortleppi (G5). Conclusions This investigation expands on the existing sequence data generated from EG isolates recovered from camel in the Sudan. The circulation of the cattle genotype (G5) in the one-humped camel is reported here for the first time.

Sera were harvested from eutocic (nÂ =Â 9) and dystocic (nÂ =Â 20) camels within the first 15Â minutes after delivery. Although there were no differences in the concentrations of estradiol-17Î² (E2) and prostaglandin F2Î± (PGF2Î±) between the eutocic and the dystocic animals, the level of progesterone (P4) and cortisol was significantly higher (PÂ <Â 0.01) in animals that experienced dystocia than those that had a normal birth. There were no differences between the concentrations of alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, calcium, cholesterol, creatine kinase, creatinine, or magnesium (Mg) in eutocic and dystocic animals. The nitric oxide concentration was significantly higher (PÂ <Â 0.01) in the serum from animals with dystocia than those that had normal births. By contrast, the serum concentrations of glucose, phosphorus (P), and triglycerides were significantly lower (PÂ <Â 0.01) in eutocic camels compared with dystocic camels. As the delayed decline of P4 is reported to be the major hormonal difference between eutocic and dystocic camels, we propose that the insensitivity of corpus luteum to luteolytic action may be a cause of dystocia. Moreover, stress and hormonal changes may affect the metabolic traits in dystocia camels. Copyright Â© 2016 Elsevier Inc.

We determined the sequence of mitochondrial cytb gene from 21 camel samples, including 18 domestic camels (three Camelus bactrianus xinjiang, three Camelus bactrianus sunite, three Camelus bactrianus alashan, three Camelus bactrianus red, three Camelus bactrianus brown and three Camelus bactrianus normal) and three wild camels (Camelus bactrianus ferus). Our phylogenetic analyses revealed that the extant wild two-humped camel may not share a common ancestor with the domestic bactrian camel and they are not the same subspecies at least in their maternal origins. Molecular clock analysis based on complete mitochondrial genome sequences indicated that the sub-speciation of the two lineages had begun in the early Pleistocene, about 0.7 million years ago. According to the archaeological dating of the earliest known two-humped camel domestication (5000â6000 years ago), we could conclude that the extant wild camel is a separate lineage but not the direct progenitor of the domestic bactrian camel. Further phylogenetic analysis suggested that the bactrian camel appeared monophyletic in evolutionary origin and that the domestic bactrian camel could originate from a single wild population. The data presented here show how conservation strategies should be implemented to protect the critically endangered wild camel, as it is the last extant form of the wild tribe Camelina.

In-diffusion of In and segregation of Cd to the surface in course of annealing lead to a formation of elliptically distorted nano-rings, elongated along the fast [110] diffusion direction. Exacerbated diffusion anisotropy in the liquid state, at temperatures above the melting point of In, further distorts the nano-rings into a camel-hump shape.\n\nPerceptions and problems of disease in the one-humped camel in southern Africa in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\n\nPubMed\n\nWilson, R T\n\n2008-06-01\n\nThe one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) was first introduced to German South West Africa (Namibia) for military purposes in 1889. Introductions to the Cape of Good Hope (South Africa) in 1897 and Rhodesia (Zimbabwe) in 1903 were initially with a view to replacing oxen that died of rinderpest. Disease risks attendant on these introductions were recognised and to some extent guarded against. There were, however, relatively few problems. One camel was diagnosed as having foot-and-mouth disease. Mange in camels from India caused some concern as did trypanosomosis from Sudan. Trypanosomosis was introduced into both the Cape of Good Hope and Transvaal. Antibodies to some common livestock disease were found in later years.\n\nUltrasonographic and macroscopic anatomy of the enucleated eyes of the buffalo (Bos bubalis) and the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) of different ages.\n\nPubMed\n\nKassab, A\n\n2012-02-01\n\nThe ultrasonographic appearance and measurements of the normal buffalo and camel eye globes were described in 60 buffaloes (Bos bubalis) aged 1âyear (28 eyes) and 10âyears (32 eyes), and in 51 humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) aged 1âyear (26 eyes) and 10âyears (24 eyes). Ocular measurements were recorded by A- and B-scan ultrasonographic examination of 40 buffalo eyes (18 young and 22 adult eyes) and 34 camel eyes (14 young and 20 adult eyes) using a KANGH ultrasound scanner equipped with 10âMHz probe. For gross measurements, 20 buffalo and 16 camel eye globes were frozen and dissected and the same measurements were made using fine callipers macroscopically. The aqueous and vitreous humour of the buffalo and camel eyes appeared anechoic. The cornea, anterior and posterior lens capsule and iris appeared hyperechoic. The ocular measurements for the axial length, vitreous chamber depth (VCD), corneal thickness, lens thickness and scleroretinal rim thickness increase with the advance of age in both buffaloes and camels. Except for the anterior chamber depth, VCD and lens thickness, which were larger in adult camels than in adult buffaloes, no other differences between ocular dimensions were observed in both species. The results of this study are valuable for comparative ocular anatomy and will be useful for ultrasonographic evaluation of ocular diseases in buffaloes and camels.

CCHF is typically asymptomatic in animals but can be highly fatal in humans approaching case fatality rate of approximately 30%. In the present investigation, a cross sectional study was conducted to determine the prevalence of CCHF and to identify the potential risk factors associated with CCHFV seropositivity among the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedaries) in Central Sudan. A total of 361 camels selected randomly from six localities were employed in the study. Sera sampled were tested for the presence of CCHFV-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). CCHFV seropositivity was recorded in 77 out of 361 animals accounting for a prevalence rate of 21.3%. Age (ORÂ =Â 3.6, CIÂ =Â 1.72-7.79, p-valueÂ =Â 0.026); locality (ORÂ =Â 5.85, CIÂ =Â 1.81-18.83, p- valueÂ =Â 0.003), tick number (ORÂ =Â 4.6, CIÂ =Â 1.37-9.81, P-value 0.04); tick control (ORÂ =Â 2.2, CI, 1.11-4.35, P-valueÂ =Â 0.023) and breed (ORÂ =Â 6.60, CIÂ =Â 2.38-18.36, P-valueÂ =Â 0.001) were recorded as potential risk factors for contracting CCHF. The prevalence of CCHF is significantly high among camels in Khartoum State, Sudan. Age, breed, locality and tick control are considered as potential risk factors for contracting CCHF. This study would be expected to reduce the impact on the livelihood of pastoral communities and ultimately avoid disease spread in human.\n\nLymph node hemangioma in one-humped camel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAljameel, M.A.; Halima, M.O.\n\n2015-01-01\n\nHemangioma is a benign tumor of blood and lymphatic vessels. It is common in skin, mucosa and soft tissues, and its occurrence in lymph nodes is extremely rare. A 10 year-old she-camel was slaughtered at Nyala slaughterhouse, South Darfur State, Sudan. Grossly, the carcass was emaciated. The left ventral superficial cervical lymph node was enlarged, hard on palpation and protruded outside the body. Its cut surface was dark red in color and measured (18 cm) in diameter. Histopathologically, the sections revealed vascular masses were composed of non-encapsulated clusters of small and medium sized with thick and thin-walled, filled with blood, separated by courageous stroma and surrounded by closely packed proliferating capillaries. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first record of the left ventral superficial cervical lymph node hemangioma in a camel in the Sudan.

Some camel parasites also represent a threat to human health. About 171,500 one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) and 100-300 two-humped camels (Camelus bactrianus) live in Iran. Knowledge of the biodiversity of their parasites is still limited. The present review covers all information about camel parasitic diseases in Iran published as dissertations and in both Iranian and international journals from 1931 to February 2017. Ten genera of Protozoa (Trypanosoma, Eimeria, Cryptosporidium, Toxoplasma, Neospora, Sarcocystis, Besnoitia, Theileria, Babesia and Balantidium), 48 helminth species detected in the digestive system, including three species of Trematoda, four species of Cestoda, and 41 species of Nematoda, as well as helminths from other organs - Echinococcus spp., Dictyocaulus filaria, Thelazia leesei, Dipetalonema evansi and Onchocerca fasciata - have so far been described in Iranian camels. Furthermore, 13 species of hard ticks, mange mites, the myiasis flies Cephalopina titillator and Wohlfahrtia magnifica, and immature stages of the Pentastomida Linguatula serrata have also been reported from camels of Iran.

A total of 605 haematoxylin and eosin-stained tissue samples from cardiac, diaphragm, shoulder, masseter and oesophagus muscles of 121 adult camels and 20 tissue samples from four foetuses were examined for sarcocysts. Sarcocysts were detected in 55 of 121 (45.45%) camels examined. The infestation rate of oesophagus, diaphragm, shoulder, masseter and cardiac musculatures were 19.83, 11.57, 12.4, 8.26 and 9.17%, respectively. There was no significant (P > 0.05) variation between males (48.6%) and females (40.82%), nor between the two sites studied (Dollo Addo, 40.00% versus Neghelle Borana 47.25%). None of the 20 tissue samples from the four foetuses examined harboured sarcocysts. The possible impact of sarcocysts on camel production is indicated. This is the first report of the presence of sarcocysts in camels from Ethiopia.\n\nAnaplasma infection of Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) and ticks in Xinjiang, China.\n\nPubMed\n\nLi, Youquan; Yang, Jifei; Chen, Ze; Qin, Gege; Li, Yaqiong; Li, Qian; Liu, Junlong; Liu, Zhijie; Guan, Guiquan; Yin, Hong; Luo, Jianxun; Zhang, Lin\n\n2015-06-10\n\nTo date, anaplasmosis has been reported to be a subclinical disease in Indian and Arabian one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) and llamas (Lama glama). However, no information on Anaplasma infection in two-humped Bactrian camels (Camelus bactrianus) in China has been published to date. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of Anaplasma spp. in domestic Bactrian camels and ticks in Xinjiang, China. A total of 382 ticks were collected from the Bactrian camels and from environmental sources. Of these, 84 were morphologically identified as belonging to the Rhipicephalus sanguineus group and genetically identified (12S rDNA, 16S rDNA and the cytochrome c oxidase 1 genes) as R. sanguineus group ticks (temporally designated as Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang). PCR testing showed that 7.2% (20/279) of the camels harbored Anaplasma platys DNA. However, microscopic examination revealed no A. platys inclusions in blood smears from the camels. The PCR prevalence of A. platys DNA was 9.5% (6/63) in Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang from the Bactrian camels and 14.3% (3/21) in Rhipicephalus sp. Xinjiang from the vegetation. A. platys DNA was not detected by PCR in other tick species (Hyalomma asiaticum, Dermacentor niveus and Hyalomma dromedarii), and no other Anaplasma species were detected in these samples. This is the first report of A. platys in Bactrian camels in Xinjiang, China. The moderate positivity observed indicates that these animals might be a natural host for this pathogen in China.\n\nPrevalence of Cryptosporidium-like infection in one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) of northwestern Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nYakhchali, M.; Moradi, T.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nCryptosporidium is a ubiquitous enteropathogen protozoan infection affecting livestock worldwide. The present study was carried out to determine the prevalence of Cryptosporidium infection in different age groups of dromedary camels in northwestern Iran from November 2009 to July 2010. A total number of 170 fecal samples were collected and examined using modified Ziehl-Neelsen (MZN) staining under light microscope. Examination of stained fecal smears revealed that 17 camels (10%) were positive for Cryptosporidium-like. The prevalence of Cryptosporidium-like was significantly higher in camel calves (< 1 years old) (20%) than other age groups, in which the diarrhoeic calves had the prevalence of 16%. In adult camels the prevalence was 6.5%. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of Cryptosporidium-like between male and female camels. It is concluded that Cryptosporidium infection is a problem in camel husbandry and could be of public health concern in the region.

Serologically positive results have been reported for Mycoplasma mycoides subsp. mycoides SC type, Mycoplasma capricolum subsp. capripneumoniae, and M. mycoides subsp. capri. The aims of this study were to detect, isolate, and identify mycoplasmas from camels (Camelus dromedarius). Initially, saliva and ear smears plus conjunctival and vaginal secretions were taken from five female animals, but only conjunctival secretions in three male animals, all belonging to the same farm. An unknown mycoplasma was isolated from one of the vagina samples. Additionally, another unknown and uncultured mycoplasma was detected with molecular biology in the same sample. In the second stage, 23 vaginal secretions were taken from the same farm plus another secretion from a different one. Ten isolates of the same unknown and previously isolated mycoplasma were detected, nine of them recovered from the vagina of female camels. Some mycoplasmas have been related to reproductive disorders; however, there is no evidence that the isolated mycoplasmas are related to such disorders.\n\nA complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the wild two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus ferus): an evolutionary history of camelidae\n\nPubMed Central\n\nCui, Peng; Ji, Rimutu; Ding, Feng; Qi, Dan; Gao, Hongwei; Meng, He; Yu, Jun; Hu, Songnian; Zhang, Heping\n\n2007-01-01\n\nBackground The family Camelidae that evolved in North America during the Eocene survived with two distinct tribes, Camelini and Lamini. To investigate the evolutionary relationship between them and to further understand the evolutionary history of this family, we determined the complete mitochondrial genome sequence of the wild two-humped camel (Camelus bactrianus ferus), the only wild survivor of the Old World camel. Results The mitochondrial genome sequence (16,680 bp) from C. bactrianus ferus contains 13 protein-coding, two rRNA, and 22 tRNA genes as well as a typical control region; this basic structure is shared by all metazoan mitochondrial genomes. Its protein-coding region exhibits codon usage common to all mammals and possesses the three cryptic stop codons shared by all vertebrates. C. bactrianus ferus together with the rest of mammalian species do not share a triplet nucleotide insertion (GCC) that encodes a proline residue found only in the nd1 gene of the New World camelid Lama pacos. This lineage-specific insertion in the L. pacos mtDNA occurred after the split between the Old and New World camelids suggests that it may have functional implication since a proline insertion in a protein backbone usually alters protein conformation significantly, and nd1 gene has not been seen as polymorphic as the rest of ND family genes among camelids. Our phylogenetic study based on complete mitochondrial genomes excluding the control region suggested that the divergence of the two tribes may occur in the early Miocene; it is much earlier than what was deduced from the fossil record (11 million years). An evolutionary history reconstructed for the family Camelidae based on cytb sequences suggested that the split of bactrian camel and dromedary may have occurred in North America before the tribe Camelini migrated from North America to Asia. Conclusion Molecular clock analysis of complete mitochondrial genomes from C. bactrianus ferus and L. pacos suggested that the\n\nObservations on the distribution of the omentum in the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nKanan, C V; Abdalla, O\n\n1979-12-01\n\nThe greater omentum of the camel has been studied for the first time. Although the camel belongs to the suborder Artiodactyla, the greater omentum exhibits a striking similarity to that of Perissodactyla.\n\nSerum protein electrophoretic pattern in one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Tripoli, Libya.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdoslam, Omran; Bayt-Almal, Mahmoud; Almghrbe, Abdullah; Algriany, Omran\n\n2018-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to characterize serum protein capillary electrophoretic pattern in apparently healthy adult male (age: 3-7 years) dromedary camels and also evaluate total protein and albumin levels using automated analyzer. Blood samples were taken from 20 camels. 5ml of blood was collected from the jugular vein and serum was separated from samples by centrifugation. Capillary electrophoresis of serum proteins identified six protein fractions in adult camels, including albumin, alpha1, alpha2, beta1, beta2 and gamma globulins, serum levels of these parameters were 3.9Â±0.04 g/dl, 0.16Â±0.01 g/dl, 0.39Â±0.03 g/dl, 0.515Â±0.03 g/dl, 0.205Â±0.01 g/dl and 0.61Â±0.04 g/dl, and 65.42Â±0.62 g/l, respectively. The total protein concentration was 65.42Â±0.62 g/L, while, the albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio was 2.4Â±0.14. The present study indicates six peaks with minicapillary electrophoresis and the results obtained were compared and interpreted in the light of finding reported by other investigators in camels.\n\nEffects of age and period of fattening on carcass and non-carcass characteristics of one-humped camels.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaghi, Davoud Ali; Shahdadi, Ali Reza; Mokhtarpour, Amir\n\n2016-08-01\n\nThis study was conducted to compare the carcass characteristics and quantity of carcass and non-carcass components of 2- and 3-year-old male camels fattened for either 3 or 6Â months. Twelve 2-year-old camels with an average body live weight of 268.5âÂ±â21.4Â kg and twelve 3-year-old camels with an average body live weight of 307.5âÂ±â29.9Â kg were used in a completely randomized design with a 2âÃâ2 factorial arrangement. For carcass analysis, three camels from each group were selected and slaughtered. The results showed that camel age and fattening period had no significant effect on average daily gain (ADG). Older camels and a longer fattening period resulted in heavier hot and cold carcass weights. Three-year-old camels had a higher dressing percentage compared to 2-year-old camels, regardless of the period of fattening. Analysis of non-carcass components showed that the heaviest component was the hide and 2-year-old camels fattened for 90Â days had the greatest weight of hide as percentage of cold carcass weight. Total muscle weight was greater for the 3-year-old camels compared to the 2-year-old ones, regardless of the fattening period, and camels fattened for 180Â days had heavier weight than those fattened for 90Â days, regardless of age at fattening. However, the greatest weight of total muscle was detected in camels at 2Â years of age fattened for 180Â days when it was expressed as percentage of carcass weight. The highest and the lowest total fat content as kilogram or as percentage of cold carcass was observed in 3-year-old camels fattened for 180Â days and 2-year-old camels fattened for 180 days, respectively. Our results suggested that the best age for slaughtering is 2Â years old with the fattening period of 180Â days.\n\nA review of sarcocystosis in camels and redescription of Sarcocystis cameli and Sarcocystis ippeni sarcocysts from the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius)\n\nUSDA-ARS?s Scientific Manuscript database\n\nThere is considerable confusion concerning Sarcocystis species in camels. Five species: Sarcocystis cameli, S. ippeni, S. camelicanis, S. camelocanis, and S. miescheri were named with inadequate descriptions and no type specimens. Here, we review literature on sarcocystosis in camels worldwide and r...\n\nRumen ciliate protozoal fauna of native sheep, friesian cattle and dromedary camel in Libya.\n\nPubMed\n\nSelim, H M; Imai, S; el Sheik, A K; Attia, H; Okamoto, E; Miyagawa, E; Maede, Y\n\n1999-03-01\n\nRumen ciliate species and composition were surveyed on the native sheep, Friesian-cattle and dromedary (one-humped) camels kept in Libya. As a result of survey, 5 genera including 14 species with 5 formae in native sheep, 9 genera including 27 species with 6 formae in Friesian-cattle and 6 genera including 13 species and 7 formae in dromedary camels were identified. All of the ciliate species and their percentage composition detected from the Libyan sheep and cattle in this examination were similar to those found from corresponding animals in the other countries. Libyan camels lacked some peculiar ciliate species found from camels in the other countries, but had many cosmopolitan species common with those in the domestic ruminants, suggesting that ciliate faunae of camel are easily affected by the other domestic ruminants kept together. The ciliate density was estimated as 105/ml in every host species.\n\nGastrointestinal helminths of camels (Camelus dromedarius) in center of Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nAnvari-Tafti, M; Sazmand, A; Hekmatimoghaddam, S; Moobedi, I\n\n2013-03-01\n\nCamels are multipurpose animals in Iran. As parasitic diseases are the major cause of impaired meat and milk production in this animal, the present study aimed at determining gastrointestinal helminthic infections of Iranian camels in the center of the country. Gastrointestinal (GI) tract of 144 carcasses of one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) slaughtered in Yazd, Esfahan and Kerman provinces' abattoirs were examined for adult helminths. Camels were from both sexes and different ages. Recovered parasites were identified according to described keys by light microscope. Of 144 tested camels, 117 were infected with at least one helminth species (81.3%). A total of 28 worm species from 14 genera were identified in the digestive tract of infected animals, including 26 species of nematodes and two species of cestodes. The infection rates in stomach, small intestine, and caecum/large intestine were 86.3%, 91.5% and 11.1%, respectively. However, no worm was found in the oesophagus. The recovered worms with infection rates are discussed in this paper. In the present study, Haemonchus tataricus, Trichostrongylus hamatus and Trichuris infundibulus are reported from Iranian dromedaries for the first time. Regarding high prevalence of infection, using anthelminthic drugs seemed necessary to improve the health and productivity of camels. On the other hand, the high rate of zoonotic species indicated that camels have important role in maintaining and transmitting infection to humans.\n\nDevelopment of the areola in the early placenta of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius): a light, scanning and transmission electron microscopical study.\n\nPubMed\n\nAbd-Elnaeim, M M M; Saber, A; Hassan, A; Abou-Elmagd, A; Klisch, K; Jones, C J P; Leiser, R\n\n2003-12-01\n\nThis study aimed to elucidate development of the areola in the early dromedary placenta in comparison with that of the pig and mare. Placental tissues from 25 pregnant camels were obtained from Cairo abattoir and prepared for light, scanning and transmission electron microscopy by routine methods. Vascular casts were made by injection of 4 : 1 liquid plastic mixture of mercox and methylmethacrylate. Areolar formation was first observed at 4.5 cm curved-crown-rump CVR length, while by 5-9 cm CVR length, the endometrial surface was uneven and studded with numerous uterine gland openings, where corresponding foetal areolae were barely detectable and the foetal areolar cells were of variable appearance and covered with long microvilli. At 10-13 cm CVR length the uterine gland openings developed irregular folds and the maternal areolar cells showed numerous apical blebs. At 14-29 cm CVR length the foetal areolae showed a great increase in height at the expense of their width. At 30-34 cm (CVR) length the maternal areolae appeared discoid and sharply demarcated from the surrounding inter-areolar tissues and the foetal areolae were rounded to irregular in shape with well-developed areolar rims. The vascular casts showed a widely meshed capillary network on the maternal areola, connecting with the pre- and post-capillary vessels, whereas the foetal side showed a relatively dense capillary meshwork. These studies indicate that the areola in the placenta of the one-humped camel is of the regular type like in the pig, and is poorly vascularized.\n\nLipid profile and thyroid hormone status in the last trimester of pregnancy in single-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nOmidi, Arash; Sajedi, Zhila; Montazer Torbati, Mohammad Bagher; Ansari Nik, Hossein\n\n2014-04-01\n\nChanges in lipid metabolism have been shown to occur during pregnancy. The thyroid hormones affect lipid metabolism. The present study was carried out to find out whether the last trimester of pregnancy affects thyroid hormones, thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), lipid, and lipoprotein profile in healthy dromedary camels. Twenty clinical healthy dromedary camels aged between 4-5 years were divided into two equal groups: (1) pregnant camels in their last trimester of pregnancy and (2) non-pregnant age-matched controls. Thyroid function tests were carried out by measuring serum levels of TSH, free thyroxin (fT4), total thyroxin (T4), free triiodothyronine (fT3), and total triiodothyronine (T3) by commercially available radio immunoassay kits. Total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were analyzed using enzymatic/spectrophotometric methods while low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL), and total lipid (TL) were calculated using Friedewald's and Raylander's formula, respectively. Serum levels of TSH and thyroid hormones except fT4 did not show any significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant camels. fT4 level was lower in the pregnant camels (P < 0.05). Serum levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, total lipid, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and VLDL did not show significant difference between pregnant and non-pregnant camels. All of these variables in pregnant camels were higher than non-pregnant. Based on the results of this study, the fetus load may not alter the thyroid status of the camel and the concentrations of thyroid hormones were not correlated with TSH and lipid profile levels in the healthy pregnant camels.\n\nA review of the growth, and of the carcass and meat quality characteristics of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedaries).\n\nPubMed\n\nKadim, I T; Mahgoub, O; Purchas, R W\n\n2008-11-01\n\nThe dromedary camel is a good source of meat especially in areas where the climate adversely affects the performance of other meat animals. This is because of its unique physiological characteristics, including a great tolerance to high temperatures, solar radiation, water scarcity, rough topography and poor vegetation. The average birth weight of camels is about 35kg, but it varies widely between regions, breeds and within the same breed. The meat producing ability of camels is limited by modest growth rates (500g/day). However, camels are mostly produced under traditional extensive systems on poor levels of nutrition and are mostly slaughtered at older ages after a career in work, racing or milk production. Camels reach live weights of about 650kg at 7-8 years of age, and produce carcass weights ranging from 125 to 400kg with dressing-out percentage values from 55% to 70%. Camel carcasses contain about 57% muscle, 26% bone and 17% fat with fore halves (cranial to rib 13) significantly heavier than the hind halves. Camel lean meat contains about 78% water, 19% protein, 3% fat, and 1.2% ash with a small amount of intramuscular fat, which renders it a healthy food for humans. Camel meat has been described as raspberry red to dark brown in colour and the fat of the camel meat is white. Camel meat is similar in taste and texture to beef. The amino acid and mineral contents of camel meat are often higher than beef, probably due to lower intramuscular fat levels. Recently, camel meat has been processed into burgers, patties, sausages and shawarma to add value. Future research efforts need to focus on exploiting the potential of the camel as a source of meat through multidisplinary research into efficient production systems, and improved meat technology and marketing.\n\nSouth-verging early folds: An important element in the structure of the northern Green Mountains\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nThompson, P.J.\n\n1993-03-01\n\nReconnaissance mapping in the Camels Hump Group, Mt. Mansfield 7.5[prime] quadrangle, north-central Vermont, indicates more complex structures than those portrayed on previously published maps. Preliminary interpretation for the structure around Smugglers Notch, for example, is that an early recumbent syncline with Hazens Notch Formation in its center (including the Sterling Pond talc deposits), opens to the south. The early syncline is deformed by the north-northeast trending Green Mountain anticlinorium, which at Smugglers Notch plunges gently south. Thus the mass of Underhill Formation along the summit ridge of Mt. Mansfield is on the upper, overturned limb of the early fold, andmoreÂ Â» on the west limb of the open, upright anticlinorium. The lowest cliffs in Smugglers Notch are Underhill Formation on the upright limb of the early fold. Rocks of the intervening, intensely weathered and graphitic Hazens Notch Formation are especially prone to the rock slides for which Smugglers Notch is infamous. Early minor isoclinal folds and strongly developed quartz rods and lineations trend roughly east-west. Correlation of this fabric with east-west lineations and poorly preserved fold hinges in the Camels Hump area farther south will help correlate deformational sequences between the two areas. Early minor folds that are roughly coaxial with younger Green Mountain folds are much less common in the Mt. Mansfield area than to the south, and faulting seems to have been much less intense. Thus following marker horizons such as quartzite beds and greenstones around fold hinges may be more successful. Do south-directed structures indicate lateral movement of material toward the Vermont reentrant during the Taconian orogenyÂ«Â less\n\nSeroprevalence of Brucella antibodies in camels in Katsina State, Nigeria.\n\nPubMed\n\nSalisu, U S; Kudi, C A; Bale, J O O; Babashani, M; Kaltungo, B Y; Saidu, S N A; Asambe, A; Baba, A Y\n\n2017-06-01\n\nA cross-sectional study was carried out to determine the status of Brucella infection in one-humped (Dromedary) camels in the North and Central senatorial districts of Katsina State, Nigeria. Nine hundred and eighty serum samples from live and slaughtered camels were tested. Modified Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT) and serum agglutination test (SAT) with ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, (EDTA) were used as screening and standard tests, respectively. The prevalence of Brucella antibodies were 110 (11.2%) and 103 (10.5%) for RBPT and SAT, respectively. Of the 472 and 508 serum samples tested from the herds and abattoirs, respectively, 63 (13.3%) and 47 (9.3%) were positive by RBPT while 62 (13.1%) and 41 (8.1%) were positive by SAT, respectively. Based on the results, it was concluded that Brucella antibodies were present in camels in the study area. Poor management practices and mixing of camels with other species of livestock as well as unrestricted movement of camels were proposed to be the reasons for the prevalence of the disease in the study area. In view of the public health importance of the disease, it is recommended that there is the need to develop a strategic plan to decrease spread of brucellosis in the study area.\n\nAn assessment of the productivity for meat and the carcass yield of camels (Camelus dromedarius) and of the consumption of camel meat in the eastern region of Ethiopia.\n\nPubMed\n\nKurtu, M Y\n\n2004-01-01\n\nA survey on camel meat productivity and consumption was conducted in Jijiga and Harar towns in 1999. Almost all the camels slaughtered were adults, predominantly males. Measurements of height, hump girth and thoracic girth were used to estimate the live weight. All the measurements were significantly greater in the male than in the female camels. Average live and carcass weights were 400 and 211 kg, respectively. Males were significantly heavier (p < 0.05) and had better dressing percentages than females. The carcasses contained averages of 76% meat, 12% fat and 20% bone for both males and females. The difference between the males and females was not significant for the ratio of meat and bones, except for fat, which was higher in the males. Camel meat is regarded as a high-quality food with medicinal value and as a least-cost source of meat. Camel meat is preferred to that of any other livestock by some people, particularly by the Somalis in Jijiga town. It is also more available, especially during the dry season when beef is in short supply. Hence, camel meat is a socially acceptable, economically viable and environmentally adaptable alternative source of meat, consumption of which should be encouraged.\n\nCiliate protozoa in the forestomach of the dromedary camel, (Camelus dromedarius), in Egypt, with description of a new species.\n\nPubMed\n\nSelim, H M; Imai, S; Yamato, O; Miyagawa, E; Maede, Y\n\n1996-09-01\n\nThe composition of ciliates obtained from the forestomachs of eleven dromedary (one-humped) camels in Egypt was examined. As a result, eight genera containing 24 species with 11 forms were identified. Of them, one species was concluded to be new, then described as Dasytricha kabanii n. sp. This new species was clearly distinguished from D. ruminantium, the other species of the genus, by its lack of somatic cilia on the posterior one-fifth of the body surface. Entodinium nanellum and Epidinium ecaudatum f. caudatum were found in all camels examined. Although the percentage composition of respective species varied with the individual camel, the rate of Entodinium spp. was high in general. Total ciliate density in forestomach fluid was 1.9 x 10(5)/ml on average. Ciliate composition in Egyptian camels was similar to that in Bactrian camels, Camelus bactrianus, in China reported previously. However, more Entodinium species were detected from Egyptian camels than from Bactrian camels.\n\n\"Candidatus anaplasma camelii\" in one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Morocco: a novel and emerging anaplasma species?\n\nPubMed\n\nAit Lbacha, Hicham; Zouagui, Zaid; Alali, Said; Rhalem, Abdelkbir; Petit, Elisabeth; Ducrotoy, Marie Julie; Boulouis, Henri-Jean; Maillard, Renaud\n\n2017-02-05\n\nThere has been a growing interest in camel anaplasmosis due to its recent emergence in this reservoir species and concerns for its zoonotic potential. The epidemiology of anaplasmosis in camels therefore remains poorly understood mostly because camels belong to marginalised poor and often transhumant populations whose interests are largely neglected. Most studies of anaplasmosis in camels have relied on microscopy and serology for diagnosis and only three studies, undertaken in Tunisia, Saudia Arabia and China, have used molecular diagnostics. The present work characterises Anaplasmataceae strains circulating in the Camelus dromedarius reservoir in Morocco using PCR. Camels (nâ=â106) were randomly sampled from 6 regions representing different agro-ecological areas in southern Morocco. Whole blood was collected and screened using PCR methods targeting the gene groEL. Anaplasmataceae strains were characterised by sequence analysis of the gene groEL. A total of 39.62% (42/106) camels screened were positive for Anaplasmataceae spp. GenBank BLAST analysis of five positive sequenced samples revealed that all strains were 100% identical to \"Candidatus Anaplasma camelii\". Phylogenetic investigation and genetic characterisation of the aligned segment (650Â bp) of the gene groEL confirmed high similarity with A. platys. This study demonstrates the circulation of a previously unidentified species of the genus Anaplasma in Morocco which is genetically close to the agent causing canine anaplasmosis but whose main reservoir is thought to be Camelus dromedarius. This study is not a clinical trial and therefore a trial registration number does not apply.\n\nEffect of season on contractile and metabolic properties of desert camel muscle (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdelhadi, O M A; Babiker, S A; Picard, B; Jurie, C; Jailler, R; Hocquette, J F; Faye, B\n\n2012-01-01\n\nThirty fattened one humped desert camels were used to examine the effect of season on contractile and metabolic properties of Longissimus thoracis (LT) muscle. Ten camels were slaughtered according to seasons of the year (winter, summer and autumn). Season significantly influenced muscle chemical composition, ultimate pH (pHu) and color. Activities of metabolic enzymes were higher during autumn season compared to summer and winter for phosphofructokinase (+64% compared to both seasons) and for isocitrate dehydrogenase (+35% and +145% in autumn vs. summer and winter, respectively). Quantification of muscle myosin heavy chain isoforms by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis showed only presence of type I and type IIa MyHC in camel muscle and indicated high proportion in winter for type I and in autumn for type IIa with respect to other seasons. Several correlations between different MyHC proportions and enzyme activities were reported. These findings indicated that muscle characteristics in camels are influenced by season.

The aim of the current study was to characterize vector-borne protozoa in the blood of dromedaries from Iran by molecular tools. From June to July 2014, 200 peripheral blood samples were collected from asymptomatic one-humped camels in two provinces of Kerman and Sistan- va-Baloochestan in central and southeastern Iran. Microscopic examination was performed on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and drops of blood were spotted on Whatman FTA Â® cards for further analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from the cards, and PCR was carried out for the detection of piroplasms and trypanosomes, followed by sequence analysis of positive samples. One sample was positive Trypanosoma spp. trypomastigotes in light microscopy. PCR results revealed one positive sample each with Theileria annulata and Trypanosoma evansi . Camels were identified as hosts for bovine Mediterranean theileriosis in the investigated area. The presence of Tr. evansi , the causative agent of surra disease, was also confirmed in camels of Iran. Further studies are recommended in order to investigate their impact on the health and productivity of camels and other livestock in this region.\n\nComparison of effects of age and sex on serum protein electrophoretic pattern in one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Semnan, Iran\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAhmadi-hamedani, M.; Ghazvinian, K.; Kokhaei, P.; Barati, M.; Mahdavi, A.\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of age and sex on the concentration of total serum protein measured by the biuret method and protein fractions determined using cellulose acetate electrophoresis in apparently healthy camels (Camelus dromedarius).

The results of the present study indicate a significant effect of age and sex on the concentrations of some of the serum protein fractions in dromedary camels.\n\nResponses to dehydration in the one-humped camel and effects of blocking the renin-angiotensin system.\n\nPubMed\n\nAli, Mahmoud Alhaj; Adem, Abdu; Chandranath, Irwin S; Benedict, Sheela; Pathan, Javed Y; Nagelkerke, Nicolas; Nyberg, Fred; Lewis, Lynley K; Yandle, Tim G; Nicholls, Gary M; Frampton, Chris M; Kazzam, Elsadig\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOur objectives were to compare the levels of circulating electrolytes, hormones, and renal function during 20 days of dehydration in camels versus the level in non-dehydrated camels and to record the effect of blocking angiotensin II AT1 receptors with losartan during dehydration. Dehydration induced significant increments in serum sodium, creatinine, urea, a substantial fall in body weight, and a doubling in plasma arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels. Plasma aldosterone, however, was unaltered compared with time-matched controls. Losartan significantly enhanced the effect of dehydration to reduce body weight and increase serum levels of creatinine and urea, whilst also impairing the rise in plasma AVP and reducing aldosterone levels. We conclude that dehydration in the camel induces substantial increments in serum sodium, creatinine, urea and AVP levels; that aldosterone levels are altered little by dehydration; that blockade of angiotensin II type 1 receptors enhances the dehydration-induced fall in body weight and increase in serum creatinine and urea levels whilst reducing aldosterone and attenuating the rise in plasma AVP.\n\nResponses to Dehydration in the One-Humped Camel and Effects of Blocking the Renin-Angiotensin System\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAli, Mahmoud Alhaj; Adem, Abdu; Chandranath, Irwin S.; Benedict, Sheela; Pathan, Javed Y.; Nagelkerke, Nicolas; Nyberg, Fred; Lewis, Lynley K.; Yandle, Tim G.; Nicholls, Gary M.; Frampton, Chris M.; Kazzam, Elsadig\n\n2012-01-01\n\nOur objectives were to compare the levels of circulating electrolytes, hormones, and renal function during 20 days of dehydration in camels versus the level in non-dehydrated camels and to record the effect of blocking angiotensin II AT1 receptors with losartan during dehydration.

From May 2012 to January 2013, 11 cities and towns from the Khorasan provinces, northeastern Iran, were randomly selected as a \"cluster\" and at least 14 camels were sampled from each cluster. A total of 200 camels were examined in this study, reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used for the detection of the Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) genome. Tick infestation was observed in 171 of the 200 camels, 480 ixodid ticks were collected, and one genus was identified as Hyalomma. Four species were reported to be the major tick species infesting camels. Among these, Hyalomma dromedarii was the most predominant tick species (90.7Â %), followed by H. anatolicum (6Â %), H. marginatum (2.9Â %), and H. asiaticum (0.4Â %). The genome of the CCHFV was detected in 49 (10.2Â %) of the 480 ticks. The CCHFV RNA was detected in two of the four tick species, and the viral genome was detected from tick samples in three South Khorasan cities. The positivity rate of ticks was as follows: Boshroyeh, 25 out of 480 (5.2Â %); Birjand, 17 out of 480 (3.5Â %); and Nehbandan, 7 out of 480 (1.5Â %). We recommend the use of acaricides to prevent disease transmission to humans and to reduce the tick population in camels. Care should be taken by abattoir workers and by those who work closely with camels.\n\nImmunohistochemical studies for the neuronal elements in the vomeronasal organ of the one-humped camel\n\nPubMed Central\n\nIBRAHIM, Dalia; ABDEL-MAKSOUD, Fatma; TANIGUCHI, Kazumi; YAMAMOTO, Yoshio; TANIGUCHI, Kazuyuki; NAKAMUTA, Nobuaki\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe neuronal elements of the vomeronasal organ (VNO) of camel were investigated immunohistochemically. PGP 9.5 labeled the receptor cells in the vomeronasal sensory epithelium, but not the supporting or basal cells. OMP stained some receptor cells, but no immunoreactive signals for OMP were detected in the non-sensory epithelium. PLCÎ²2 labeled scattered cells in the sensory epithelium and a larger number of cells in the non-sensory epithelium. Double labeling immunohistochemistry revealed that the PLCÎ²2-positive cells were surrounded by substance P-positive nerve fibers. Collectively, these data suggest that the camel VNO bears, in addition to the mature vomeronasal receptor cells, trigeminally-innervated solitary chemosensory cells which are expected to play a substantial role in the control of stimulus access to the VNO.

The dromedary camel is a highly appreciated and valued animal and represents an important genetic resource. Camel herders, living in remote areas, have developed their own ways to treat diseases in camels, based on a long time of experience. Information about the diseases and the ethnoveterinary practices performed was collected from a total of 90 herders and healers by interviews and participant observations. The respondents classified the diseased in major and minor fractions. Clinical signs were given in detail. Mange followed by trypanosomosis and orf were considered the most prevalent diseases, and also caused the greatest economic losses. Orf was regarded the most complex disease. The season was considered to have great influence on the occurrence of the diseases. A variety of different treatments were described, such as medicinal plants, cauterization, odorant/fly repellents, pesticides, larvicides, cold drink, yogurt and supportive therapy (hot food, hot drink). There is paramount need to document and validate the indigenous knowledge about animal agriculture in general and ethnoveterinary practices in particular. This knowledge is rapidly disappearing and represents a cultural heritage as well as a valuable resource for attaining food security and sovereignty.\n\nRegional and circadian variations of sweating rate and body surface temperature in camels (Camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nAbdoun, Khalid A; Samara, Emad M; Okab, Aly B; Al-Haidary, Ahmed A\n\n2012-07-01\n\nIt was the aim of this study to investigate the regional variations in surface temperature and sweating rate and to visualize body thermal windows responsible for the dissipation of excess body heat in dromedary camels. This study was conducted on five dromedary camels with mean body weight of 450 Â± 20.5 kg and 2 years of age. Sweating rate, skin and body surface temperature showed significant (P < 0.001) circadian variation together with the variation in ambient temperature. However, daily mean values of sweating rate, skin and body surface temperature measured on seven regions of the camel body did not significantly differ. The variation in body surface temperature compared to the variation in skin temperature was higher in the hump compared to the axillary and flank regions, indicating the significance of camel's fur in protecting the skin from daily variation in ambient temperature. Infrared thermography revealed that flank and axillary regions had lower thermal gradients at higher ambient temperature (T(a) ) and higher thermal gradients at lower T(a) , which might indicate the working of flank and axillary regions as thermal windows dissipating heat during the night. Sweating rate showed moderate correlation to skin and body surface temperatures, which might indicate their working as potential thermal drivers of sweating in camels. Â© 2012 The Authors.

Five species: Sarcocystis cameli, Sarcocystis ippeni, Sarcocystis camelicanis, Sarcocystis camelocanis and Sarcocystis miescheri were named with inadequate descriptions and no type specimens. Here, we review literature on sarcocystosis in camels worldwide and redescribe structure of S. cameli and S. ippeni sarcocysts by light- and transmission electron microscopy (LM and TEM). Eight sarcocysts from the oesophagi of two camels (Camelus dromedarius) from Egypt were studied. By LM, all sarcocysts were thin-walled with barely visible projections on the cyst walls. By TEM, two structurally distinct sarcocysts were recognized by unique villar protrusions (vp) not found in sarcocysts from any other host. Sarcocysts of S. cameli had vp of type 9 j. The sarcocyst wall had upright slender vp, up to 3.0 ÂµM long and 0.5 ÂµM wide; the total thickness of the sarcocyst wall with ground substance (gs) layer was 3.5 ÂµM. On each vp, there were rows of knob-like protrusions that appeared to be interconnected. The vp had microtubules that originated at midpoint of the gs and continued up to the tip; microtubules were smooth, without any granules or dense areas. Bradyzoites were approximately 14-15 Ã 3-4 ÂµM in size with typical organelles. Sarcocystis ippeni sarcocysts had type 32 sarcocyst wall characterized by conical vp with an electron dense knob. The total thickness of the sarcocyst wall (from the base of gs to vp tip) was 2.3-3.0 ÂµM. The vp were up to 1.2 ÂµM wide at the base and 0.25 ÂµM at the tip. Microtubules in vp originated at midpoint of gs and continued up to tip; microtubules were criss-crossed, smooth and without granules or dense areas. Bradyzoites were 12.0-13.5 Ã 2.0-3.0 ÂµM in size. Sarcocystis camelicanis, S. camelocanis and S. miescheri are considered invalid.\n\nThe differentiation of camel breeds based on meat measurements using discriminant analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nAl-Atiyat, Raed Mahmoud; Suliman, Gamal; AlSuhaibani, Entissar; El-Waziry, Ahmad; Al-Owaimer, Abdullah; Basmaeil, Saeid\n\n2016-06-01\n\nThe meat productivity of camel in the tropics is still under investigation for identification of better meat breed or type. Therefore, four one-humped Saudi Arabian (SA) camel breeds, Majaheem, Maghateer, Hamrah, and Safrah were experimented in order to differentiate them from each other based on meat measurements. The measurements were biometrical meat traits measured on six intact males from each breed. The results showed higher values of the Majaheem breed than that obtained for the other breeds except few cases such dressing percentage and rib-eye area. In differentiation analysis, the most discriminating meat variables were myofibrillar protein index, meat color components (L* and a*, b*), and cooking loss. Consequently, the Safrah and the Majaheem breeds presented the largest dissimilarity as evidenced by their multivariate means. The canonical discriminant analysis allowed an additional understanding of the differentiation between breeds. Furthermore, two large clusters, one formed by Hamrah and Maghateer in one group along with Safrah. These classifications may assign each breed into one cluster considering they are better as meat producers. The Majaheem was clustered alone in another cluster that might be a result of being better as milk producers. Nevertheless, the productivity type of the camel breeds of SA needs further morphology and genetic descriptions.\n\nRare congenital absence of tail (anury) and anus (atresia ani) in male camel (Camelus dromedarius) calf\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnwar, S.; Purohit, G.N.\n\n2012-01-01\n\nA one-day old male camel calf was presented to the Al-Qattara Veterinary Hospital with complaints of abdominal straining and lack of defecation. On examination it was found that the calf had no tail, the posterior sacral margin was blunt and the anal opening was absent. The case was diagnosed as congenital anury with atresia ani. The animal was sedated with 0.1 mg/kg of xylazine administered intramuscularly and under local infiltration with 2% lidocaine a circular incision was made at the anal area to create an anal opening. The animal passed plenty of meconium. The cut edges were sutured with horizontal mattress sutures. The animal was administered penicillin and streptomycin for 5 days and had an uneventful recovery. It is reported that congenital anury rarely occurs in one humped camel and accompanied atresia ani can be surgically treated.

The Arabian one-humped camel lives in an environment of thermal stress, nevertheless is able to encounter the risk of misfolded proteins. Here, the cDNA encoding camel GRP94 was isolated by rapid amplification of cDNA ends. The isolated cDNA contained an open reading frame of 2412â¯bp encoding a protein of 803 amino acids with predicted molecular mass of 92.5â¯kDa. Nucleotide and protein BLAST analysis of cGRP94 revealed strong conservation between camel and other domestic mammals. Overexpression of cGRP94 in COS-1 cells revealed multiple isoforms including one N-glycosylated species. Immunofluorescence colocalized cGRP94 with the ER resident protein calnexin. Interestingly, none of the cGRP94 isoforms expressed in CHO cells was N-glycosylated, presumably due to folding determinants that mask the N-glycosylation sites as proposed by in silico modelling. Surprisingly, isoforms of cGRP94 were detected in the culture media of transfected cells indicating that the protein, although an ER resident, also is trafficked and secreted into the exterior milieu. The overall striking structural homologies of GRP94s among mammalian reflects their pivotal role in the ER quality control and protein homeostasis. Copyright Â© 2017.

Jr.; Norby, R.J.; McLaughlin, S.B.\n\n1986-04-01\n\nThe response of growth processes in red spruce to ozone, mist chemistry, rain chemistry, and soil type (singly and in combination) was investigated over a four-month period. Precipitation and ozone exposures were based on air chemistry/deposition in high elevation forests of eastern North America. The two soils were from Camels Hump in the Green Mountains of Vermont and Acadia National Park on the Maine coast. Growth was evaluated through analysis of relative growth rates (RGR) and biomass partitioning to root, stem, and needle fractions. The only main treatments that consistently influenced seedling growth were soil type and rain chemistry. SeedlingsmoreÂ Â» grown in Camels Hump soil had significantly less needle, stem, and root biomass and lower RGR. The only influence of precipitation chemistry was greater root and shoot biomass in seedlings experiencing the more acidic rain. It is hypothesized that the physiological mechanism underlying the growth responses of P. rubens is whole-plant allocation of carbon resources.Â«Â less\n\nComputed tomography and cross-sectional anatomy of the metatarsus and digits of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) and buffalo ( Bos bubalis).\n\nPubMed\n\nEl-Shafey, A; Kassab, A\n\n2013-04-01\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to provide a detailed computed tomography (CT) and cross-sectional anatomic reference of the normal metatarsus and digits for the camel and buffalo, as well as to compare between metatarsus and digits in these animals to outstand a basis for diagnosis of their diseases. Advantages, including depiction of detailed cross-sectional anatomy, improved contrast resolution and computer reformatting, make it a potentially valuable diagnostic technique. The hind limbs of 12 healthy adult camel and buffalo were used. Clinically relevant anatomic structures were identified and labelled at each level in the corresponding images (CT and anatomic slices). CT images were used to identify the bony and soft tissue structures of the metatarsus and digits. The knowledge of normal anatomy of the camel and buffalo metatarsus and digits would serve as initial reference to the evaluation of CT images in these species.

To fill this gap in knowledge, the prevalence, risk factors, and genetic diversity of Anaplasma species were investigated in Tunisian dromedary camels. A total of 226 camels from three different bioclimatic areas were sampled and tested for the presence of Anaplasma species by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and nested polymerase chain reaction (nPCR) assays. Detected Anaplasma strains were characterized by 16S rRNA sequence analysis. Overall infection rate of Anaplasma spp. was 17.7%, and was significantly higher in females. Notably, A. marginale, A. centrale, A. bovis, and A. phagocytophilum were not detected. Animals were severely infested by three tick species belonging to the genus Hyalomma (H. dromedarii, H. impeltatum, and H. excavatum). Alignment, similarity comparison, and phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA sequence variants obtained in this study suggest that Tunisian dromedaries are infected by more than one novel Anaplasma strain genetically related to A. platys. This study reports the presence of novel Anaplasma sp. strains genetically related to A. platys in dromedaries from various bioclimatic areas of Tunisia. Findings raise new concerns about the specificity of the direct and indirect diagnostic tests routinely used to detect different Anaplasma species in ruminants and provide useful molecular information to elucidate the evolutionary history of bacterial species related to A. platys.\n\nRJR Nabisco's cartoon camel promotes camel cigarettes to children.\n\nPubMed\n\nDiFranza, J R; Richards, J W; Paulman, P M; Wolf-Gillespie, N; Fletcher, C; Jaffe, R D; Murray, D\n\n1991-12-11\n\nTo determine if RJR Nabisco's cartoon-theme advertising is more effective in promoting Camel cigarettes to children or to adults. To determine if children see, remember, and are influenced by cigarette advertising. Use of four standard marketing measures to compare the effects of Camel's Old Joe cartoon advertising on children and adults. High school students, grades 9 through 12, from five regions of the United States, and adults, aged 21 years and over, from Massachusetts. Recognition of Camel's Old Joe cartoon character, product and brand name recall, brand preference, appeal of advertising themes. Children were more likely to report prior exposure to the Old Joe cartoon character (97.7% vs 72.2%; P less than .0001). Children were better able to identify the type of product being advertised (97.5% vs 67.0%; P less than .0001) and the the Camel cigarette brand name (93.6% vs 57.7%; P less than .0001). Children also found the Camel cigarette advertisements more appealing (P less than .0001). Camel's share of the illegal children's cigarette market segment has increased from 0.5% to 32.8%, representing sales estimated at $476 million per year. Old Joe Camel cartoon advertisements are far more successful at marketing Camel cigarettes to children than to adults. This finding is consistent with tobacco industry documents that indicate that a major function of tobacco advertising is to promote and maintain tobacco addiction among children.\n\nComparative anatomy of the dorsal hump in mature Pacific salmon.\n\nPubMed\n\nSusuki, Kenta; Ban, Masatoshi; Ichimura, Masaki; Kudo, Hideaki\n\n2017-07-01\n\nMature male Pacific salmon (Genus Oncorhynchus) demonstrate prominent morphological changes, such as the development of a dorsal hump. The degree of dorsal hump formation depends on the species in Pacific salmon. It is generally accepted that mature males of sockeye (O. nerka) and pink (O. gorbuscha) salmon develop most pronounced dorsal humps. The internal structure of the dorsal hump in pink salmon has been confirmed in detail. In this study, the dorsal hump morphologies were analyzed in four Pacific salmon species inhabiting Japan, masu (O. masou), sockeye, chum (O. keta), and pink salmon. The internal structure of the dorsal humps also depended on the species; sockeye and pink salmon showed conspicuous development of connective tissue and growth of bone tissues in the dorsal tissues. Masu and chum salmon exhibited less-pronounced increases in connective tissues and bone growth. Hyaluronic acid was clearly detected in dorsal hump connective tissue by histochemistry, except for in masu salmon. The lipid content in dorsal hump connective tissue was richer in masu and chum salmon than in sockeye and pink salmon. These results revealed that the patterns of dorsal hump formation differed among species, and especially sockeye and pink salmon develop pronounced dorsal humps through both increases in the amount of connective tissue and the growth of bone tissues. In contrast, masu and chum salmon develop their dorsal humps by the growth of bone tissues, rather than the development of connective tissue.

Hump geometry is a major factor in altering the level of these shocks and specifying the speed limit. However, there is no study of the relationship between whole body vibration due to passing over a speed control hump and lower back pain or occupational diseases. In this study, an experimental investigation is conducted to evaluate health risks associated with different geometry speed control humps. Vibration levels and shocks are measured by a seat pad accelerometer placed under the driver's seat to evaluate hazard risks on the human body's lower back. The assessment is based on two standard methods of measuring whole body vibration: the British standard BS 6841 and the new ISO/DIS standard 2631-5. These methods are used to assess the effects of vehicle type, passenger location in the vehicle, vehicle speed, and speed control hump geometry. It was found that circular speed control humps currently installed on many public roads should be modified in order to eliminate hazards. Two newly designed speed humps were proved to be less hazardous than circular speed control humps.\n\nOn the relation between testes size and sperm reserves in the one-humped camel (camelus dromedarius).\n\nPubMed\n\nElwisby, A B; Omar, A M\n\n1975-01-01\n\nThe size, weight and volume as well as the sperm content of the testes of 18 mature, 6-10-year-old camels with unknown breeding history were determined after slaughtering and then related to one another. It was found that the weight and the volume of the testes can be estimated fairly accurately by means of their length. The length of the testes can also be used to calculate the sperm reserves, although more accurate values can be obtained by taking the square numbers of the testes length, breadth, and thickness into account. The average values for gonadal and epididymal sperm reserves of paired testes and epididymides was 6.278 +/- 1.226 X 10(9) and 12.177 +/- 2.316 X 10(9) respectively. The sperm production per gram testes tissue was 40.55 +/- 15 X 10(6).\n\nAssessing forest damage in high-elevation coniferous forests in Vermont and New Hampshire using Thematic Mapper data\n\nNASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS)\n\nVogelmann, James E.; Rock, Barrett N.\n\n1988-01-01\n\nThis study evaluates the potential of measuring/mapping forest damage in spruce-fir forests in the Green Mountains of Vermont and White Mountains of New Hampshire using Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) data. The TM 1.65/0.83-micron (TM5/4) and 2.22/0.83-micron (TM7/4) band ratios were found to correlate well with ground-based measurements of forest damage (a measure of percentage foliar loss) at 11 spruce-fir stands located on Camels Hump, a mountain in northern Vermont. Images using 0.56 and 1.65-micron bands with 1.65/0.83-micron band ratios indicated locations of heavy conifer forest damage. Both 1.65/0.83 and 2.22/0.83-micron band ratios were used to quantify levels of conifer forest damage among individual mountains throughout many of the Green and White Mountains. Damage was found to be consistently higher for the Green than the White Mountains.\n\nMorphological and glycan features of the camel oviduct epithelium.\n\nPubMed\n\nAccogli, Gianluca; Monaco, Davide; El Bahrawy, Khalid Ahmed; El-Sayed, Ashraf Abd El-Halim; Ciannarella, Francesca; Beneult, Benedicte; Lacalandra, Giovanni Michele; Desantis, Salvatore\n\n2014-07-01\n\nThis study describes regional differences in the oviduct of the one-humped camel (Camelus dromedarius) during the growth phase (GP) and the mature phase (MP) of the follicular wave by means of morphometry, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and glycohistochemistry investigations. Epithelium height significantly increased in the ampulla and decreased in the isthmus passing from the GP to the MP. Under SEM, non-ciliated cells displayed apical blebs (secretory) or short microvilli. Cilia glycocalyx expressed glycans terminating with sialic acid linked Î±2,6 to Gal/GalNAc (SNA affinity) throughout the oviducts of GP and MP and sialic acid linked Î±2,3 to GalÎ²1,3GalNAc (MAL II and KOH-sialidase (K-s)-PNA staining) throughout the MP oviducts. Non-ciliated cells displayed lectin-binding sites from the supra-nuclear cytoplasm to the luminal surface. Ampulla non-ciliated cells showed O-linked (mucin-type) sialoglycans (MAL II and K-s-PNA) during GP and MP and N-linked sialoglycans (SNA) during the MP. Isthmus non-ciliated cells expressed SNA reactivity in GP and MP, also K-s-PNA binders in MP, and MAL II and PNA affinity (GalÎ²1,3GalNAc) during GP. GalÎ²1,3GalNAc was sialilated in the non-ciliated cells of GP UTJ. Luminal surface lacked of GalÎ²1,3GalNAc in GP and MP, whereas it expressed Î±2,6- and Î±2,3-linked sialic acids. In GP intraluminal substance reacted with SNA, MAL II, K-s-PNA in ampulla and only with MAL II in the isthmus and UTJ. These results demonstrate that the morphology and the glycan pattern of the camel oviductal epithelium vary during the follicular wave and that could relate to the region-specific functions.

Q.\n\n2009-11-01\n\nThe hump bead is a typical weld defect observed in high-speed welding. Its occurrence limits the improvement of welding productivity. Visualization of hump formation during high-speed gas metal arc welding (GMAW) is helpful in the better understanding of the humping phenomena so that effective measures can be taken to suppress or decrease the tendency of hump formation and achieve higher productivity welding. In this study, an experimental system was developed to implement vision-based observation of the weld pool behavior during high-speed GMAW. Considering the weld pool characteristics in high-speed welding, a narrow band-pass and neutral density filter was equipped for the CCD camera, the suitable exposure time was selected and side view orientation of the CCD camera was employed. The events that took place at the rear portion of the weld pools were imaged during the welding processes with and without hump bead formation, respectively. It was found that the variation of the weld pool surface height and the solid-liquid interface at the pool trailing with time shows some useful information to judge whether the humping phenomenon occurs or not.\n\nPeak-dip-hump lineshape from holographic superconductivity\n\nDOE Office of Scientific and Technical Information (OSTI.GOV)\n\nChen, J.-W.; Kao, Y.-J.; Wen, W.-Y.\n\n2010-07-15\n\nWe study the fermionic spectral function in a holographic superconductor model. At zero temperature, there is no horizon and hence the entropy of the system is zero after the backreaction of the condensate is taken into account. We find the system exhibits the famous peak-dip-hump lineshape with a sharp low-energy peak followed by a dip and then a hump at higher energies. This feature is widely observed in the spectrum of several high-T{sub c} superconductors.\n\nNumerical and Experimental Investigations of Humping Phenomena in Laser Micro Welding\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nOtto, Andreas; Patschger, Andreas; Seiler, Michael\n\nThe Humping effect is a phenomenon which is observed approximately since 50 years in various welding procedures and is characterized by droplets due to a pile-up of the melt pool. It occurs within a broad range of process parameters. Particularly during micro welding, humping effect is critical due to typically high feed rates. In the past, essentially two approaches (fluid-dynamic approach of streaming melt within the molten pool and the Plateau-Rayleigh instability of a liquid jet) were discussed in order to explain the occurrence of the humping effect. But none of both can fully explain all observed effects. For this reason, experimental studies in micro welding of thin metal foils were performed in order to determine the influence of process parameters on the occurrence of humping effects. The experimental observations were compared with results from numerical multi-physical simulations (incorporating beam propagation, incoupling, heat transfer, fluid dynamics etc.) to provide a deeper understanding of the causes for hump formation.\n\nMolecular identification and phylogenetic analysis of Dipetalonema evansi (LEWIS, 1882) in camels (Camelus dromedarius) of Iran.\n\nPubMed\n\nSazmand, Alireza; Eigner, Barbara; Mirzaei, Mohammad; Hekmatimoghaddam, Seyedhossein; Harl, Josef; Duscher, Georg Gerhard; Fuehrer, Hans-Peter; Joachim, Anja\n\n2016-04-01\n\nDespite the economic importance of camels, the parasites that affect them have not received adequate attention so far and molecular studies are scarce compared to other livestock. In this study, we characterized peripheral blood microfilariae in 200 healthy one-humped camels (Camelus dromedarius) from south-east Iran by microscopy and molecular tools to receive a more detailed insight into prevalence and species that affect them. Moreover, adult specimens of the filarial nematode Dipetalonema evansi were collected from the carcass of an infected animal. Microscopic examination was performed on Giemsa-stained blood smears, and blood was also spotted on Whatman FTA(Â®) cards for DNA analysis. Genomic DNA was extracted, and PCR was carried out for the detection of filaroid helminths, followed by sequence analysis of positive samples. Four samples were positive for microfilariae by microscopy, while 16 animals (8 %) were positive by PCR. Sequence analysis revealed D. evansi in all cases. Phylogenetic analysis of a cytochrome C oxidase subunit I (COI) sequence of filaroid nematodes showed that most species in a single genus cluster in the same clade; however, D. evansi and D. gracile are not monophyletic and branch rather at the base of the tree. Further studies on the life cycle of D. evansi, specifically the identification of intermediate host(s), have become feasible with the provision of the first specific COI sequences in this study.\n\nBrucellosis in camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Darfur, Western Sudan.\n\nPubMed\n\nMusa, M T; Eisa, M Z M; El Sanousi, E M; Abdel Wahab, M B; Perrett, L\n\n2008-01-01\n\nIn a field outbreak of brucellosis in 21 camels mixed with cattle, sheep and goats, five camels, three of which showed clinical signs, were serologically positive. In a subsequent abattoir survey of apparently healthy camels, six animals were seropositive, albeit with titres that tended to be lower than those found in the field outbreak. Of the six seropositive slaughtered camels, five were shown to have lymph nodes (prescapular and supramammary) infected with brucellae (Brucella melitensis biovar 3, two camels; Brucella abortus biovar 6, three camels). Infection of camels with B. abortus biovar 6 had not previously been reported. Infection of the supramammary lymph nodes presents a potential hazard to those who consume raw camels' milk, a common practice in nomadic camel owners.\n\nPlague from Eating Raw Camel Liver\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAl-Hamdan, Nasser A.; Fontaine, Robert E.\n\n2005-01-01\n\nWe investigated a cluster of 5 plague cases; the patients included 4 with severe pharyngitis and submandibular lymphadenitis. These 4 case-patients had eaten raw camel liver. Yersinia pestis was isolated from bone marrow of the camel and from jirds (Meriones libycus) and fleas (Xenopsylla cheopis) captured at the camel corral.

E.; Williams, D. L.\n\n1985-01-01\n\nThe utilization of remote sensing to monitor forest damage due to acid deposition is investigated. Spectral and water measurements and aircraft radiance data of red spruce and balsam fir, collected in Camels Hump Mountain and Ripton, Vermont between August 13-20, 1984, are analyzed to evaluate the damage levels of the trees. Variations in reflectance features and canopy moisture content are studied. It is observed that damage correlates with elevation (greater damage at higher elevations); xylem water column tension is greater at higher damage sites; and a 'blue shift' is indicated in the spectral data at high damage sites.\n\nNumerical simulation of humping phenomenon in high speed gas metal arc welding\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nChen, Ji; Wu, Chuan-Song\n\n2011-06-01\n\nIt is of great significance to obtain a thorough understanding of the physical mechanisms responsible for humping bead phenomenon in high speed gas metal arc welding (GMAW) in order to raise welding efficiency. Experiments were conducted to observe the weld pool behaviors in high speed GMAW, and it was found that both the severely deformed weld pool surface and strong backward flowing play a dominant role in humping bead formation. In this study, a mathematical model is developed to quantitatively analyze the forming mechanism of humping beads for high speed GMAW through considering both the momentum and heat content distribution of the backward flowing molten metal inside the weld pool. The transient development of temperature profiles in the weld pool with severe deformation demonstrates the humping bead forming process under some welding conditions. The predicted and measured humping bead dimensions are in agreement.\n\nGenome sequences of wild and domestic bactrian camels\n\nPubMed Central\n\nJirimutu; Wang, Zhen; Ding, Guohui; Chen, Gangliang; Sun, Yamin; Sun, Zhihong; Zhang, Heping; Wang, Lei; Hasi, Surong; Zhang, Yan; Li, Jianmei; Shi, Yixiang; Xu, Ze; He, Chuan; Yu, Siriguleng; Li, Shengdi; Zhang, Wenbin; Batmunkh, Mijiddorj; Ts, Batsukh; Narenbatu; Unierhu; Bat-Ireedui, Shirzana; Gao, Hongwei; Baysgalan, Banzragch; Li, Qing; Jia, Zhiling; Turigenbayila; Subudenggerile; Narenmanduhu; Wang, Zhaoxia; Wang, Juan; Pan, Lei; Chen, Yongcan; Ganerdene, Yaichil; Dabxilt; Erdemt; Altansha; Altansukh; Liu, Tuya; Cao, Minhui; Aruuntsever; Bayart; Hosblig; He, Fei; Zha-ti, A; Zheng, Guangyong; Qiu, Feng; Sun, Zikui; Zhao, Lele; Zhao, Wenjing; Liu, Baohong; Li, Chao; Chen, Yunqin; Tang, Xiaoyan; Guo, Chunyan; Liu, Wei; Ming, Liang; Temuulen; Cui, Aiying; Li, Yi; Gao, Junhui; Li, Jing; Wurentaodi; Niu, Shen; Sun, Tao; Zhai, Zhengxiao; Zhang, Min; Chen, Chen; Baldan, Tunteg; Bayaer, Tuman; Li, Yixue; Meng, He\n\n2012-01-01\n\nBactrian camels serve as an important means of transportation in the cold desert regions of China and Mongolia. Here we present a 2.01âGb draft genome sequence from both a wild and a domestic bactrian camel. We estimate the camel genome to be 2.38âGb, containing 20,821 protein-coding genes. Our phylogenomics analysis reveals that camels shared common ancestors with other even-toed ungulates about 55â60 million years ago. Rapidly evolving genes in the camel lineage are significantly enriched in metabolic pathways, and these changes may underlie the insulin resistance typically observed in these animals. We estimate the genome-wide heterozygosity rates in both wild and domestic camels to be 1.0 Ã 10â3. However, genomic regions with significantly lower heterozygosity are found in the domestic camel, and olfactory receptors are enriched in these regions. Our comparative genomics analyses may also shed light on the genetic basis of the camel's remarkable salt tolerance and unusual immune system.

Blood samples were collected to 0, 5, 10, 15, 45, and 60 minutes and at 1.5, 2, 2.5, 3, 3.5, 4, 5, 6, 8, 12, 24, 26, 28, 30, 40, 48, 50, 53, and 60 hours after i.v. administration of 4.5 mg of phenylbutazone per kg of body weight. Urine was obtained in fractions during the entire blood sample collection period. Serum and urine phenylbutazone concentrations were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography; assay sensitivity was 100 ng/ml. Serum oxyphenbutazone concentration was measured by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry; assay sensitivity was 10 ng/ml. Disposition of phenylbutazone was best described by a two-compartment open model. Mean +/- SEM elimination half-life was 13.44 +/- 0.44 hours. Total body clearance was 12.63 +/- 1.64 mg/kg/h. Renal clearance was between 0.3 and 0.4% of total body clearance. The elimination half-life of oxyphenbutazone was 23.9 +/- 2.09 hours. The elimination half-life and total body clearance of phenylbutazone in camels are intermediate between reported values in horses and cattle."
