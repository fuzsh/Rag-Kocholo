        "text": "The Incompetent Excuses Killing Egypt’s Trees\n\nEihab Boraie\n\nAnother week, another tree massacre, ruining Egypt’s environment, ecology and landscape. Eihab Boraie looks at the government’s insistence on turning a blind eye on the destruction of mother nature’s most valuable gift.\n\nMother Nature and Om El Donia are one in the same, however too many of its children are uneducated and continue to barbarically maim her of her beauty. Meanwhile the rest of the developed world turns to experienced city planners focused on making their cityscapes more attractive by adding open, green spaces for its citizens while tackling the serious issue of climate change. With 90% of Egypt’s landscape being a barren desert and its citizens desiring to return to its once cosmopolitan ways, the aneurysm-inducing question becomes: how are people still getting away with killing the few precious trees providing Egypt with colour and oxygen? Upon hearing the news that another tree massacre is underway, in the northern Cairo district of Shubra, we decide to examine the history behind these reckless acts in hopes of understanding why this keeps happening.\n\nTrees are historically the most important raw material used to build civilisations. They are the bearers fruits, the providers of oxygen, the producers of fuel and, in the current heatwave, the mother of all shade. Lining streets, they provide a much-needed relief from the eye sore that is Egypt’s garbage strewn streets, and yet while people continue to focus on the more prevalent issues dominating the news cycle, crooked branches of governments continue to allow the massacre of trees, recycling the same excuses. With each new massacre, comes outrage and ultimately an explanations from officials that are far from satisfactory. Instead of strengthening and enforcing laws to protect trees, officials continue to place blame and provide excuses instead of solutions.\n\nThe ancient Pharaohs knew how pivotal trees would be in the advancement of their civilisation. They went to great lengths to acquire ebony wood from Sudan, pine and cedar from Syria, planting a variety of organic life predominantly in Giza and the surrounding areas. Fast forward to 2001, and even the most historically cherished and oldest of trees fail to be protected, and at the turn of new millennium an alleged land dispute resulted in the destruction of a biblically significant tree. Allegedly, farmers had heard that the tourism of Ministry was planning to develop “Christian tourism” by protecting Egyptian sites believed to have been visited by Jesus according to the Bible. Coptic tradition believes that the tree bowed in homage to Jesus Christ when he, Joseph and the Virgin Mary passed through Egypt to escape the murderous King Herod. Upon hearing that the government planned to build a wall around the tree, farmers fearing for their land decided to cut it down, breaking the hearts of many Egyptians and Christians worldwide. “I regret that authorities were not able to protect a 2,000-year-old tree that was such an important monument for us,” Father Matta Kamel Hanna, whose church overlooks the spot near the Nile where the tree stood, told The Associated Press in 2001. In this example, the government failed to protect a tree that they themselves identified as important, and a lot of blame should be placed on the farmers who cut down the tree, but at the same time the government’s inability to quickly act and communicate to farmers that their land would be protected deserves partial blame as it could have possibly saved a tree that may have attracted scores of new tourists.\n\nInstead of admitting failures, the government puts the blame on others as a common excuse used to wash their hands of the situation. In 2012, a similar incident happened in Zamalek, when a branch from a poorly maintained tree destroyed a car in the front of a shop. The driver was furious and demanded compensation from the store owners for the damage. After settling with driver, the shop owners on that street decided that they couldn’t afford to compensate damage by city trees that are supposed to trimmed and maintained by the government. Witnessing the event, writer Aaron Jakes writes “The shop owners had loved the trees and enjoyed the canopy of shade they provided. But the day’s events had convinced them that the cost and liability of upkeep were more than they could bear. With some reluctance and an awareness that they were breaking the law, they cut them all down.” With the government’s inability to once again act quickly or communicate their plan, store owners took matters into their own hands cutting down a majority of trees. When outrage ensued, the government retreated to their favourite excuse that they were unaware of the action, despite the many pleas to trim the trees. “The issues, of course, extend well beyond the erosion of basic services that led my neighbours to take matters into their own hands and chop down some trees on our block. Indeed, others have argued, the highly centralised and profoundly undemocratic structures of governance below the national level have played a central role in driving forward a process of rapid, haphazard, and devastatingly uneven urbanization across the country. The corruption, incompetence, and institutionalized impunity of provincial governors and local officials, moreover, played a crucial role in the pillaging of public resources and the unplanned allocation of land in both urban and rural areas under the Mubarak regime,” explains Aaron Jakes in piece for Egypt Independent in 2012.\n\n[Photo By Michel Hanna who continues to post photos of mutilated trees on his blog and on the Facebook page Heliopolis Eyes in attempt to raise awareness of these massacres.]\n\nSadly, even when the government attempts to trim the trees, they fail to do so properly, often killing the trees by ‘mistake’ and blaming workers incompetence for the destruction. That is exactly what happened in the first week of August this year when complaints were sent to the Environment Ministry of improper trimming on Al-Falaky and Mansour Streets near government buildings. The Environment Minister admitted that the trimming was botched and although an Egyptian law stipulates jail time and fines for unguided cutting, it does nothing for trimming. We’re not exactly sure what the differences is and neither does death, but even troublesome is the fact that internet search failed to find anyone convicted for unguided cutting and that this wasn’t. This brings up one of the biggest problems surrounding the issue; lack of accountability and corruption.\n\n[Photo by Michel Hanna]\n\nIn 2005, the government announced that they would be trimming trees in the very same area, but once again ‘trimmed’ beyond repair. Hundreds of trees were decimated under the guise of maintenance on Al-Falaky and Mansour streets. Coincidentally, the largest culled area so happens to be the very same site of the Four Seasons at First residence Hotel. The only evidence is the trees which were totally destroyed beyond the possibility of pretending to be trimmed, but again officials wiped their hands of any wrong doing and no one was held accountable. This would happen again in the case of Heliopolis’ Merry land park. Heliopolis has drastically transformed and the vast killing of trees is evident all over Heliopolis.\n\nIn March, residents were up in arms when without any warning several ancient trees were needlessly destroyed in the park to allegedly allow for a parking lot. To quell the anger, a fact finding mission was launched, and the ministry’s legal affairs department said they would examine the rental contract of the park, as they were unaware of the plan and claim that they didn’t issue any permits or perform a study to assess the environmental impact as stated by Article 19 of the constitution. Until now there have been no updates on this case, and despite intentions, history shows that the damage won’t be reversed, and holding someone accountable would be the exception and not the rule. Killing trees is illegal, but enforcing these laws seems to never happen. That is why kanaqin (charcoal producers) seem comfortable that they can operate with impunity when selecting which trees to cut down. Explaining what was happening in the region in 2011, Mourad El Essawi, a prominent farmer in Saqqara, tells Egypt Independent “These guys are kanaqin (charcoal) producers who request an arbitrary contract from the ministry to cut down dead trees. In the contract it says only to cut down trees that are dry. But of course they abuse this because they have the paperwork, and they just go and cut whichever ones they like.” This highlights that laws are not enough and that at some point they need to be enforced to thwart further environmental devastation. Abdel Nabi Osman, manager of the Egyptian Endurance Riders Association (EERA), tells Egypt Independent that he filed official complaints saying “They’re not just producing kanaqin, they are wood traders and they’re selling the trees, and it’s highly illegal. Regardless, someone needs to be held accountable - these trees are beautiful, old landmarks of the Saqqara area, and the irresponsibility of the ministries and their porous contracts must be revealed.” The call for transparency is of the utmost importance as the government continues to prove they are unable to hold perpetrators accountable and worse still seem to be involved.\n\nWith a new Suez Canal built, Egypt eyes the transformation of places like Port Said as pivotal to Egypt’s future. However, instead of adopting plans around the few ancient trees available, the municipality’s plan seems to be to rip up the whole town including its streets and trees to start a-new with security in mind instead of following the most recent constitution which protects the right to healthy environment and requires state institutions to protect natural resources like trees while striving for sustainable development. Needless to say, the government is far from reaching this goal and highlights the lack of communication within the government. Two days ago residents of Shubra’s Aghakhan district filed complaints of yet another tree massacre. Once again, the Environment Ministry claims they weren’t aware of the plans and that they need to be consulted in order before any tree is cut down. However, the plan to cut these trees is part of a government project to build a road linking the Cairo-Alexandria road with Nasr City and that the trees that were removed stood in the way of the on-ramp. Talking to Aswat Masriya the deputy Cairo Governor, Ahmed Deif, stresses that “The governorate’s only role is to hand over the lands allocated for the project to the Armed Forces who are tasked with implementation.”\n\n[Port Said municipality uprooting trees as part of its urban beautification efforts]\n\nIf the government is still unable to communicate plans within its own branches than what chance will concerned citizens have to stop these massacres before the damage is done? Why is there an Environment Ministry if they aren’t going to be consulted on city projects? Sadly, this issue remains unresolved and the longer it stays that way the closer Egypt will come to bringing the extinction of the few trees we can grow in a desert. Do we really need to wait until we can’t breathe the air and the city regularly get shutdown due to severe smog? For meaningful change to occur there will be a need to call for transparency, accountability, and better communication both inside and out of the government as well as the end to corrupt practices and ridiculous excuses. In order to actualise these changes concerned citizens need to be unified beyond their districts. In each of these cases complaints were filed, but since it only affects people in a particular community not enough concern is raised to mount any pressure. This is a nation-wide concern and until it is addressed as such not much will change.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Cairo Scene.\n\nCapital Cairo: A Regime of Graphics\n\nAdham Selim\n\nFour months after an extravagant announcement, the government’s plans to establish a new Egyptian capital city seem to be caught somewhere between controversy and awkward silence.​\n\nThe influx of conflicting reports about cancellation, technical obstacles, financial problems and decommissioning briefly stopped after a media embargo was issued, but resumed shortly thereafter with a statement by General Kamal al-Wiziri, chief-of-staff for the Armed Forces Engineering Authority, about commencing the project directly after the inauguration of the New Suez Canal. Despite the negative critique that swarmed professional circles and social media before the media blackout, and despite the historically recurring failure of the new cities scheme in general, the government is still publicizing the project with an air of positivity.\n\nThe official presentation of the new city during the Egypt Economic Development Conference last March featured photoshopped maps of Egypt with a huge green terrain covering what’s now the Western Desert, showing “how Egypt in the 22nd century would look like,” Housing Minister Mostafa Madbouli said.\n\nHe further explained that the new city is only a part of a bigger \"national strategic plan” that combines on a single map all of the new cities that were built since the late 1970s and other mega-projects currently underway in Toshka, the Western Desert and, more importantly, in the Suez Canal Zone, in addition to the new capital city, together forming one big integrated network of development spanning the whole map of Egypt.\n\nThis was accompanied by other architectural visualizations, stock images and videos suggesting daily scenes from the new city with green promenades, Dubaiesque architecture in the background, and young people strolling by in the foreground.\n\nThe presentation thus stands not only for a city, but for a whole world — and not merely a better or a greener world, but also a world that is ultra-organized, a world where everything on both the macro- and micro-scale follows a single abstract plan that blatantly encompasses everything.\n\nDuring the presentation, however, very little was said about the viability of this world. Questions of whether it’s financially feasible, or whether it’s actually going to be functional, or even liked by those who are going to inhabit it, were not addressed. There were only speculative abstract graphics, but they were enough to convince the audience of the achievability of this imaginary world, give it a material existence, and make it somehow immediately graspable.\n\nThe maps and images had such a potent make-believe effect that the value of properties located within several dozen kilometers of the proposed city spiked out of proportion just a few minutes after the press release was issued. Discussions about the pros and cons of living in high-rise buildings and possibilities of pre-booking suddenly surfaced in talk shows. The average public was plugged into discussing details of life in the new city — a city that is still just an image. The audience’s immediate response collapsed the experience of the image with real space-time.\n\nHow did this happen?\n\nThe answer lies in the means used to produce these visuals. Using a set of techniques verging the fields of photography, 3D graphics and cinematic VFX, architects are capable of producing ultra-real visualizations of buildings, streets, trees, cars, people and skies cut out from their original contexts, and collaged together to form whole environments. These populations of pixels — as in the case of the new Egyptian capital — inspire not only a design, but a whole world.\n\nBeing mere pixels, these collages are inexact, incongruent and unrepresentative of the real world. Nevertheless, they are used to discuss designs, negotiate contracts, buy and sell property, and even constitute legal documents in the real world. By fully depicting the world-to-be to the tiniest detail, these images assume control over the immediate world — hence, they become material in and of themselves.\n\nIn this case, the sheer scale of the maps combined with the images’ minute details of everyday life speaks of an authority that has absolute control over this promised world. Such an authority has to remain external to our world — much like a modernist architect, it has to see our world from a distance. It has to see it as an image subject to comprehensive reorganization.\n\nThis graphical mode of drawing/designing a new Egypt in a comprehensive fashion finds its root in classical, late-19th century urban theory, and in Boris Groys’ notion of the artist-ruler. The art historian theorizes the Communist Party of Stalinist Russia as an artist whose material was Russia itself, and whose goal was to reshape it in ideal form. This mode of ruling cultivates a positivist attitude that conflates social engineering with spatial planning, and advocates a heroic vision of what the city and society must one day become — largely via the aid of concepts, drawings, maps and images. The object of these visions — the whole of society itself — is inert matter that can only find purpose and meaning through an image, a plan, or a concept laid out by the hands of the artist-ruler.\n\nBut to be more specific, the practice of thinking through images as substitute realities falls more precisely under what political theorist and historian Timothy Mitchell calls representation. In this context, representation doesn’t refer to the mere making of images or mental references. Instead, Mitchell’s representation is a social practice that establishes an image as authority over reality, where the reality of the real is always a function of an image.\n\nIn this sense, adding green to a yellow patch on the map or visualizing imaginary worlds is not simply an act of creating visual references. It’s an act of bestowing meaning and existence on a visual depiction. Through representation, the imaginary world visualized in these images becomes even more knowable and discussable than the real world.\n\nSome would ask, so what? Isn’t building such a dream world a good thing?\n\nThe answer is no.\n\nEgypt’s New Urban Communities Authority (NUCA) lists 27 new cities established by successive governments since 1976. The most ambitious was Sadat City, conceived in 1978 to spearhead the then-emerging national urbanization policy. Built half-way between Cairo and Alexandria, the city was planned as an alternative administrative capital, and a symbol of then-President Anwar al-Sadat’s effort to “draw a new map of Egypt.”\n\nThese new cities were similarly planned side-by-side with massive infrastructure projects — and, of course, massive forced evictions where needed — and were supposed to reinvent social, spatial and demographic realities into the shape of a dream world. However, this dream world fell bleakly short of its promises. New cities failed to achieve any substantial economic development, mobilize any positive social change, or even meet a tiny fraction of their planned target populations. In short, unlike the image, the reality of the promised world turned out to be so gloomy that many preferred to stay in their old worlds.\n\n[Still from 1977 national TV news reel showing inauguration of 10th of Ramadan City.]\n\nSo why would the government repeat the same mistake?\n\nDavid Sims’ latest book, Egypt’s Desert Dreams: Development or Disaster?, portrays the Egyptian government as an entity so complex, yet so inefficient, that it prefers to repeat the same pattern of mistakes and encounter expected problems than to try something else and risk new difficulties — hence the frequency of grand planning schemes that never work.\n\nThis argument runs the risk of falsely flattening the different administrations of the last half century into one single entity, but it can still be of good use when considering the case of the new capital city. If we can entertain the assumption that, deep inside the imaginary inner-self of the Egyptian government, there is a stable paradigm where these grand schemes still make sense despite all the past failures, we would start to glimpse the metaphysical framework that governs spatial planning in Egypt.\n\nOf course, such an \"inner-self” does not actually exist, but the phrase refers to the ethos that collectively guides the bureaucratic apparatus. Such an ethos can be found in a statement by one NUCA official about the failure of the new cities scheme: “We have to complete our plans. We cannot look to see if people come or not. They will come.”[1]\n\nIt is this blind belief in drawings that makes up the matter of this ethos. The statement reflects a sense of religiosity that elevates failing cities into some sort of a disciplinary practice, rather than a recurring mistake — a practice of ruling through drawing.\n\nFrom the authority’s viewpoint, the real world is an image that needs to be aesthetically reconstructed or improved, and the imaginary world promised in images is more vivid and true than the one that is to be replaced. Drawings for this NUCA official must have been more material, immediate and meaningful than reality itself. The continuous act of drawing the world-to-be is the way in which authority sustains a stable worldview, in which it places itself as external to the world it intends to change, and rule.\n\nFarha Ghannam, professor of anthropology at Swarthmore College, refers to a similar notion when she highlights the privilege of vision over other senses in the Egyptian government’s rhetoric around development, particularly in its metaphors “presenting Cairo as the face of the Egyptian body that should be maintained, cleaned and beautified.”[2]\n\nThe object of this vision, the thing that is looked at, seems to be lacking a self of its own — it is, in fact, an image. Another sense of graphicness is also noted in Salah El-Shakhs’ discussion of Sadat City’s failure as an administrative capital. The now-abolished Ministry of Development and New Communities planned to move administrative functions to the new capital, but refused to relocate itself. [3] The hand that drew the plan can move things, but cannot be moved. It stays outside the plan.[4]\n\nThis regime of graphics isn’t solely a remnant of modernity. Historically, Egypt’s urban mass is a man-made network of infrastructural ventures developed over centuries of precarious dependence on the Nile as a sole source for water. This situation renders futile any attempt at projecting politics on territorial space without a parallel reanimation of infrastructure.\n\nEgypt’s history could be a history of hydraulic engineering. This makes Egypt a constantly evolving architectural project — an endless series of drawings in the strict architectural sense. Consequently, if the crux of the nationalistic project in Egypt was to establish a comprehensive sense of order spanning the country’s physical and non-physical space, then this order must be of a graphical nature. This order is expressed in a visual form.\n\nThe government’s growing interest photoshopped maps, architectural visualizations, video promos and professional presentations might simply be good PR campaigning, but it’s also part of a ruling paradigm. These plans, drawings, maps, images, videos, presentations and other visual media about grand schemes for a new Egypt are in fact some of the ways in which the authority produces itself, rather than being a mere product of the regime.\n\n[1] cited in David Sims, Desert Dreams, p.126\n\n[2] Farha Ghannam, Remaking the Modern, p.31\n\n[3] Salah El-Shakhs, “Sadat City, Egypt And The Role Of New Town Planning In The Developing World,” in Journal of Architectural and Planning Research, Autumn 1994, pp. 243-244\n\n[4] The construction of government buildings in Sadat City was already completed by 1979. However, Sadat’s sudden visit to Tel Aviv the same year enraged the public, and made it necessary to retreat a few steps to absorb pressure, particularly in governmental circles that welcomed the Camp David accords in return for staying in Cairo.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Mada Masr.\n\nSpaces: A Conversation at Nile Sunset Annex\n\nSpaces is a new series of posts spotlighting arts and culture venues in Cairo and beyond.\n\nNile Sunset Annex (Taha Belal and Jenifer Evans) with a 1986 work by Mounir Canaan at What are you doing, object? at Gypsum Galley (photo: Laura Cugusi)\n\nJenifer Evans: Here we are staying at Lugar a Dudas in Cali, Colombia for a month, where we’re taking the time to stop and think about our activities as Nile Sunset Annex properly for the first time since we started in January 2013. These include 20 exhibitions in our space, a spare room in a flat in Garden City, and almost as many publications, as well as creating an art collection, a growing but technically inadequate digital archive of local exhibition ephemera and some art. We also just recently became a curator for a group exhibition at a nearby commercial gallery, Gypsum.\n\nOne thing we’ve come up with to help us figure out how to proceed is a questionnaire for the local, living artists we’ve worked with so far, to find out what they think we’re doing well and badly, and what they think we should do next. Are you nervous about their responses?\n\nTaha Belal: No, it’s exciting! This is the first time we’ve systematically asked artists what they thought about working with us and how we’ve done things so far. I’m hoping it will be very helpful, informative and critical.\n\nIt seems that so far one thing they agree on is for Nile Sunset Annex to become sustainable by no longer relying solely on our personal earnings from our other jobs and the artists’ contributions. The models we’re thinking of at the moment involve starting a kind of membership program or selling limited editions. Do you think this would change the way we work?\n\nJE: I think that if we develop our model and money comes into it then expectations will rise and people won’t be so forgiving when we make mistakes or do something that isn’t very interesting.\n\nAlso we will need to become more “professional” if we want to monetize Nile Sunset Annex, and this would probably mean slowing down from doing monthly exhibitions, as lately we have stretched ourselves a bit thin doing those as well as our other jobs — me as the culture editor for Mada Masr and you helping your family out at Actotrade.\n\nMahmoud Khaled’s It’s Never Too Late to Talk About Love at Nile Sunset Annex, June 2013 (photo: Mahmoud Khaled)\n\nEven if we don’t attempt to monetize, slowing down would enable us to focus more on each thing we do — like clean up our ephemera archive and make it user-friendly, be less last-minute with exhibition production, have fewer typos in our publications, and so on. What would you most like to do if we had more time?\n\nTB: It would be great to generally be able to spend more time working on things. Often we’re so close to producing something we’re really proud of and then a typo glares at us when it’s too late. Monetizing could force us to slow down and make fewer frustrating mistakes, but also potentially mean we’re less reliant on other jobs so could spend more time with Nile Sunset Annex.\n\nDo you think the necessary “professionalization” would make us into more of an institution and then inevitably less exciting? Would slowing down then make us less fresh?\n\nJE: I think just continuing as we have been will make us less fresh anyway, so we either need to shake things up a lot or become more professional about what we’re doing.\n\nWe’ve always stuck to our constant exhibition schedule (except for summer breaks), we both have fulltime jobs and there is only two of us, plus whatever help the artist(s) can give and Andeel pitching in when he can. Lately things got more last-minute because we were working on other, off-site projects — What are you doing, object? at Gypsum and Nile Sunset Annex: The Many Hats at Haines Gallery in San Francisco — at the same time as our regular “program”.\n\nMona Marzouk’s Untitled (1996) and Sarah Samy’s Solid (2014) in What are you doing, object? at Gypsum Gallery, June 2015 (photo: Laura Cugusi)\n\nGiving things more time will be more satisfying as we won’t have that slight tinge of embarrassment when we show the audience what we’ve done, and more importantly the artists we work with will be more satisfied. Also we’ll be able, potentially, to become more ambitious and push our ideas further. But part of me is still very glad that both of us have one foot outside the “art world” because it gives us perspective (and I like my work for Mada a lot), plus it keeps us from becoming career artists.\n\nDo you think that inviting in another person or people, if we could find someone critical yet also willing, could help us shake things up and become more professional and ambitious about things while also letting us continue with our “non-art” work?\n\nTB: I wonder if we need both slowing down and someone joining us? We would have the time to decrease mistakes, and to think and develop ideas. And there’s no doubt that having another person or people would shake things up. They would also bring other skills, and it would mean dividing the work (and costs) between more people, like when we had Hady Aboukamar on board. It would be challenging — we’d have to take time to figure out how to work again — but could also be exciting and keep Nile Sunset Annex on its toes. Perhaps we consider doing all three: monetizing, slowing down and adding a person?\n\nI agree that it’s important to have perspective, but I also think that working and living in Cairo has the advantage of always keeping one in check or forcing perspective in a way.\n\nOne side of Take to the Sea’s publication accompanying their Nile Sunset Annex show A Roomful of Memory, October 2013.\n\nWe still have the question of whether it’s important to continue having a physical space where we do exhibitions. We’ve talked about going into publishing instead, or even running a bar at one point, after the short exhibition we did that was a functioning bar.\n\nJE: One reason we started is that we felt that in Cairo there’s a lack of regular solo shows as most spaces currently have quite irregular exhibition programs and their exhibitions are often heavily curated and themed. Also in response to a perceived lack, we wanted to have an emphasis on object-based works that prioritize formal aspects, rather than video, photography and digital works, and/or those prioritizing social and political issues. And we wanted to offer exhibitions that were very well-installed on a technical level. This all required having a designated space.\n\nAlthough this still feels important, we’ve increasingly noticed that for various reasons objects behave and are seen in Cairo in a different way from the places where we went to art school (London for me, San Francisco for you). As a result we have begun thinking about moving away from the white cube, which can never be properly achieved in Cairo due to factors such as dust, noise and poverty, and seems like a borrowed and uncompetitive way of exhibiting objects in our context anyway.\n\nMuseumish, with Mariam Elias, Sobhy Guirguis, Paradoxia and Wadiaa Shenouda, at Nile Sunset Annex in June 2014\n\nAlthough the two 4-by-4-meter rooms Nile Sunset Annex has inhabited (in your flat until this March, and in mine since April) open into domestic spaces, we’ve kept them empty and their walls white for the art. Ditching the designated space would help us explore other options like showing objects outside or in other people’s houses. This might increase our small audience but will mean negotiating with other people a lot more, being less self-sufficient, maybe even getting into trouble. Even more challenging will be convincing artists we can still offer an attractive exhibition opportunity if it’s not on blank white walls, and that they can trust us with their art in dirtier, noisier circumstances.\n\nMaybe publishing and limited editions could help us still offer artists a blank controllable space (in a book) while potentially making us some money, and at the same time we do a less regular but more experimental exhibition program involving noise and dust?\n\nTB: I think we’ve reached a good re-starting point then! This would be the best of all worlds — focusing on publishing and limited editions which have been an ambition of ours, and not giving up on the object and its physical presence while choosing to engage with the context we’re in, to negotiate with the “real” world head on rather than spend our energy on trying to keep it out.\n\nNew Folder (2), Andeel and Kareem Lofty’s exhibition at Nile Sunset Annex, March 2015\n\nThis reminds me of when we were invited by Beirut in Cairo to come up with a “display format” for a an exhibition series they were planning around the theme of institutions. We proposed going to the Friday market and buying various used objects to crowd the space so it felt less sterile. We imagined placing the exhibition’s TV screens on old washing machines, its books on refrigerator parts, bits of wood holding up its documents, and having clutter and secondhand furniture lying around. We suggested putting wheels on heavy items to make them easier to move around so the whole display could be changed at any moment… They didn’t buy it though.\n\nBack to now — another thing to consider is that we’ve benefitted from having a framework of doing exhibitions regularly and this could still be helpful. Perhaps we should simply do publications and/or limited editions at least once a month instead of exhibitions. We can figure that out.\n\nJE: Yeah. We’re lucky to find ourselves at a good point to reconsider things — having just done this “Many Hats” exhibition, a hybrid combining documentation of our activities since we started with our hand-made mini-approximations of the works in our contemporary art collection and a central suitcase-shaped artwork. It provided a step back and overview.\n\nNile Sunset Annex: The Many Hats at Haines Gallery, San Francisco, July 2015\n\nWe’re also now spending time doing a lot of reading for our upcoming editorial project for YATF (or as it’s about to be renamed, Mophradat), in Cali where there’s a wealth of artist-run initiatives and collectives to be inspired by. Another upside of slowing down and having more members is that we may also be able to spend time on our own art practices again.\n\nHow would we find another person to be Nile Sunset Annex with us? Should we do an open call?\n\nTB: I think we’ll have to try everything we can think of….\n\nDisappearing Cities of Egypt\n\nThe symposium “Disappearing Cities of the Arab World” took place on 12 July at the British Museum in London. Cairobserver’s Mohamed Elshahed was invited to participate in the third panel of the day along side artists Ali Cherri, Hrair Sarkissian and Jananne Al-Ani. Each were asked to present remarks for 12 minutes. The following text was read by Elshahed accompanied by a slideshow of his photography of contemporary urban conditions in Egypt. For more photos see Picture Masr.\n\nPart I: 19 acts of disappearance\n\n1. At 7:00 am on July 11, 1882 British warships bombarded Alexandria. Tens of recently built grand apartment buildings as well as public buildings were devastated by the bombardment. The main urban space of 19th century Alexandria, Place des Consuls (also known as Muhammad Ali Square) was surrounded by rubble. The entire area had to be rebuilt.\n\n2. Earlier this year, the Egyptian military evacuated the entire town of Rafah and started to dynamite every single building. By the end of the year the entire town, once a stop on the road from Cairo to Jerusalem, will disappear forever.\n\n3. On January 24, 2014 a car bomb targeting the Cairo police headquarters severely damaged the Museum of Islamic Art. Originally established in 1858 as the Museum of Arab Art, the first of its kind in the world, the now shattered building was completed in 1902. It was closed for 8 years for restoration before it reopened in 2010.\n\n4. Starting in the 1820s Cairo underwent major urban interventions that called for the destruction of entire areas of the old city to make way for new straight avenues that would ease mobility, allow light and air into the medieval street network. During this process of modernization hundreds of houses, commercial buildings and mosques were destroyed. Orientalists, romantics and travel writers scoffed the modernization efforts as mixing what shall not mix: features of the oriental city with features of the European city.\n\n5. Villa Ambron, the inspiration for The Alexandria Quartet by Lawrence Durrell, awaits its demolition.\n\n6. Near downtown Alexandria, a time capsule of a space, the Venus Salon de The, has seen few customers in recent years. Its exact history and story I do not know, but the space was a palimpsest of the city’s social and urban history. It quietly closed last year and will most likely be remembered by few.\n\n7. In Port Said today, two elderly brothers sit in their bookshop, which has been in business for six decades in the Woolworth building, a 19th century two story wooden structure on a prominent corner. The brothers await the inevitable fate of having their shop and the history that comes with it demolished. In the meantime they have set up a personal museum of photographs documenting their successful careers and their travels to international exhibitions and fairs. A state-owned insurance company controlling most properties in the oldest part of Port Said is leading the way to allow such buildings to disappear to sell the properties for real estate speculation, often by members of the military and police with connections to the company’s management.\n\n8. In 1956 French, British and Israeli areal bombing devastated the Suez Canal cities of Port Said and Ismailia. Entire districts, particularly those belonging to the poorest were annihilated.\n\n9. The government is currently removing (against the wishes of residents) vast stretches of the tram network that was always part of the affluent district of Heliopolis in Cairo.\n\n10. Um Kulthoum’s 1930s modernist house designed by Ali Labib Gabr was demolished over two decades ago.\n\n11. In the years leading to 2011, Luxor governor Samir Farag, a military man whose career saw him in civilian posts such as director of the Cairo Opera, led a citywide re-planning vision that called for the mass demolition of 19th and 20th century buildings to make way for the reconstruction and excavation of ancient sites. The project aimed to evacuate the city of its inhabitants—and with them erase nearly all signs of modern history—in favor of turning Luxor into an open-air museum for the consumption of European tourists.\n\n12. On January 26, 1952 a great fire tore through downtown Cairo as rioters retaliated against the killing of Egyptian police personnel by British forces in the city of Ismailia during the previous day. Hundreds of establishments, mostly catering to foreigners and elites, such as cinemas, department stores, bars, casinos as well as foreign owned businesses and buildings were torched.\n\n13. In 1947, King Farouk dressed in military uniform raised the Egyptian flag in what is today’s Tahrir Square and ordered the demolition of the military barracks of Qasr el Nil, built in 1863 for the Egyptian military but used since 1882 by the British.\n\n14. The house of Ahmed Shawqi, the Egyptian poet and dramatist who pioneered the modern Egyptian literary movement, is currently being demolished.\n\n15. In the 1960s Nubian villages and towns were forever submerged under the waters of Lake Nasser.\n\n16. Alexandria’s Greco-Roman museum, established in 1892, has been closed for as long as I can remember. It’s shell is still standing but the museum as a public place in the city has long disappeared from the minds of Alexandrians, especially the city’s youngest residents who never had the chance to enter its doors.\n\n17. In early February 2014 bulldozers started to incrementally destroy the fully intact Villa Aghion in Alexandria. The modernist icon built in 1928 and designed by Auguste Perret had become an economic burden on its owner. Hundreds of historic villas across the country met the same fate in recent years.\n\n18. The status of the house in which Gamal Abdel Nasser was born is unknown.\n\n19. Last month the government commenced the demolition of the former headquarters of Mubarak’s National Democratic Party. The torched building had become a powerful yet unintentional monument to the revolts of 2011.\n\nPart II: A possible prognosis\n\nThis partial and unsystematic list of disappearing buildings, infrastructures, museums, houses and entire neighborhoods reveals that disappearance as a term used in these cases masks extraordinary violence. Buildings and cities don’t disappear; they are demolished, dynamited, bombed, attacked, razed to the ground, and bulldozed. There is an entire industry in Egypt for helping owners of would-be heritage buildings destroy their own properties. Methods include injecting acid into columns and flooding foundations with water.\n\nThus, what does the seemingly apolitical phrase “disappearing cities of the Arab world” mean in the context of the contemporary Middle East? Is it about the destruction of cities by direct acts of war and terrorism, including terrorism unleashed by despotic state institutions as a way of saying to besieged Arab populations “not yet, you’re not ready to be truly moderns”? Is it the intentional negligence of national patrimony as a way of producing insecure easy to govern populations with little sense of national pride? Or is it the destruction of archeological sites deemed uninteresting by the state and therefore made available for real estate speculation? Or is it the total dismissal of two centuries of local modern history by postcolonial states that adopt colonial narratives that only that which pre-dates European arrival (often marked with 1798 and the arrival of Napoleon in Egypt) is considered authentic and therefore possibly worthy of recording? Or is it the destruction of neighborhoods and the eviction of their residents in the name of reconstructing ancient sites and uncovering archeological remains deemed of interest to the global tourism industry?\n\nOnce upon a time, the destruction of cities and buildings promised architects the opening of new territories for renewal and modernism. For example, in 1945 Egyptian modernist architect Sayed Karim published an article in the popular magazine al-Ithnein wal Dunya lamenting Cairo’s survival from the Second World War. “What if Cairo were destroyed?” he asked. Karim argued that peacetime had caused Egyptian cities incremental widespread damage. For a modernist aspiring to build architecture and cities on a grand scale, the mass destruction of European cities by the war gave Karim reason for envy. He wrote, “European architects are busy rebuilding their cities according to the latest principles.” Karim asserts the classic notion that modernization often requires destruction and the disappearances of older urban forms.\n\nBut, is this always the case? After all, the destruction of downtown Beirut led the way for further destruction as part of the rebuilding processes which have transformed the city center into a neoliberal ghostly image of its former self. And the destruction of Iraqi cities by US forces has given way for some of the most lucrative reconstruction contracts in history, given largely to US companies, but with little tangible results lived and experienced by Iraqis.\n\nDisappearing Egyptian neighborhoods, museums, landmark buildings, and the collective identities of entire cities is an everyday occurrence under the auspices of friendly despotic governments and often in the service of piecemeal capital speculation. Often times uncontrolled real estate markets replace sites that carry histories and memories with blank square footage up for sale even if the overabundance of this newly built area does not correspond to market dynamics of supply and demand. This new real estate is not solving the housing crisis; there are an estimated 6 million vacant newly built units in Egypt.\n\nWhile all this happens, millions of Egyptians “like” and “share” on social media melancholic images and videos of what is perceived as a better urban past that was not long ago. A sense of being helpless and besieged pervades. At the same time the current regime directly or indirectly oversees the destruction and intentional negligence of Egyptian cities while presenting itself to the masses as savior and builder. Propaganda aside, there are facts on the ground that are undeniable: Our cities are mismanaged, public spaces are restricted, and our heritage, particularly modern heritage, is left to melt into air. The result is an urban condition in which the past is unrecorded, the present is unstable and the future is uncertain.\n\nUrban encroachment on Egypt’s agricultural land\n\n[In this Thursday, May 14, 2015 photo, a farmer leads his cattle on his way home, in a village in the Nile Delta town of Behira, 300 kilometers (186 miles) north of Cairo, Egypt. Red-brick urban settlements are springing up everywhere in Egypt, snuffing out farmland to make way for the growing population in this country of about 90 million people. (AP Photo/Mosa’ab Elshamy)]\n\nPhotojournalist Mosa’ab Elshamy’s latest reportage for the Associated Press is on Egypt’s urban expansion onto agricultural land. In preparation for the AP story, Elshamy sent Mohamed Elshahed of Cairobserver a few questions, below are the questions and responses. You can see Elshamy’s full story and images here.\n\nHow serious do you think are the threats of urban encroachment? It seems to be either overstated by the government or understated by farmers.\n\nThere is a paradoxical situation in which the state constantly attempts to “green the desert,”often with little success, while failing to strike a balance that allows for the protection and increased productivity of existing agricultural land. Urban encroachment on agricultural land is a serious problem that threatens the country’s food security. Villages across the delta are quickly transforming into high-density urban settlements without any proper plans for the urban expansion patterns or any regulations regarding the architecture such as effective building codes. In many cases a single story family home has transformed into a multistory multi-family dwelling, often with adjacent agricultural land being added to the urbanized plot to provide housing for the extended family. This piecemeal urbanization has irreversible negative impact on the quality of the soil and the productivity of the land. The lack of proper infrastructure, particularly sewage systems, means that the land also becomes contaminated and unsuitable for agriculture. It is a deadly cycle, more urbanization leads to impoverished soil, bad soil means low productivity of crops, which brings down the value of the agricultural land and makes urbanization the only profitable option.\n\nWho is to blame? Farmers say it’s their only option, with low crop income and lack of lands. Do you agree with that?\n\nThe Egyptian government is the biggest culprit in this crisis. Rather than support local farming economies, the government has lifted subsidies, raised taxes on farmers, and its policies of importing cheap wheat from the US and other countries has led to the deprivation of the country’s agricultural economy. Add to that complications and pressures put on farmers by the Awqaf ministry among other institutions. Farmers owning the smallest plots face the biggest challenges. Access to fertilizers and farming supplies for efficient modern farming is difficult and expensive.\n\nMajor cash crops like cotton have long died out, which has a ripple effect as it also impacted local textile industrial production, export and shipping businesses. The government has allowed for the sale of Egyptian seeds to other countries, so when you find a product of “Egyptian cotton” in a US department store it doesn’t necessarily mean the cotton was ever grown in Egypt. At the same time there has been no serious effort on the part of the state to provide adequate urban and village development schemes to provide services and infrastructure and to that absorb population growth while protecting the country’s resources in terms of agricultural land.\n\nWhat do you think is the way to confront this, especially since criminalizing doesn’t seem to work?\n\nThe Egyptian state for the past 40 years, since Sadat’s economic liberalizing policies, continued by Mubarak and now by the current regime, has retreated from its social responsibilities towards supporting the local economies, particularly of small businesses and farmers. The result has been the massive expansion of the informal/unofficial economy and a mass migration from small towns and villages towards Cairo/Giza. The problem of encroachment on agricultural land is directly linked to the fact that Egypt is the world’s largest wheat importer. Thus, the problem needs to be confronted on multiple fronts: Overhaul the current economic policies that make importing wheat cheaper than growing Egyptian wheat, safeguarding the economic value of agricultural land (so that it remains agricultural) and providing logistical and professional support to small-scale farming communities, upgrading the agricultural infrastructure and maintaining, expanding and modernizing irrigation canals which are now mostly polluted, surveying the current status of all towns and villages surrounded by agricultural land and providing immediate plans for urban expansions that minimize impact on agricultural land.\n\nThe government policy of building housing in the desert to correspond with every Nile-side urban community as a means of absorbing the population has totally failed. This failure is due in large to design problems. Rather than build comprehensive urban communities, the state has built thousands of housing units without the least effort in creating urban environments that invite new inhabitants to adopt them as their new homes: No services, transport, public spaces and no infrastructure will not make these parallel desert developments attractive to village and town dwellers who will continue to prefer building on agricultural land to remain in their communities and close to work, school and the few available services.\n\nRelated reading on Cairobserver:\n\n900 KM Nile City: Grappling with Egypt’s Baffling Urban Condition\n\nBread and Urbanism\n\nIt’s Countryside: Life outside Cairo\n\nCairo: User-Driven Housing Construction\n\nIman Salama\n\nSince the 1970s, the concept of self-help in housing has become a strong theoretical foundation and a practical and functional basis for public interventions in upgrading slum areas. By the mid-1980s, over 50% of the World Bank’s urban projects were sites and services schemes that encouraged people to build their own dwellings on land provided by the state and equipped with basic infrastructure. However, its definition has led to different interpretations. In general, self-help practices withdrew the notion of ‘user control’ over the construction process, which led to their failure in achieving the concept’s original objective: allowing integrated community participation and the creation of autonomy in housing environments.\n\nToday, a set of practical questions about the self-help approach still remains unanswered. What is the user’s role and responsibilities? In which phases of the housing project does he participate? What is the role of the expert and the state? The following documentary was produced to address these fundamental questions by referring to the popular housing production modes in Cairo. The city’s informal development has been and continues to be the dominant mode of urbanization, housing over 12 million people. So what can this strong dynamic of user-driven construction in Cairo tell us about self-help housing?\n\nSelf-Built informal housing in Cairo : a user driven approach. from urbaMonde on Vimeo.\n\n[Interview with Dr. Dina Shehayeb, Housing and Building Research Center, Cairo.]\n\nThe documentary (see video above) shows a testimony of two owner-builder families living in Cairo’s informal settlements - in Manshiyet Naseer and in Qalyubia - describing the process by which they built their homes. Their testimonies and the remarks by professor and architect Dr. Dina Shehayeb indicates the practical elements of self-help and challenges of housing autonomy. In fact, they demonstrate that divers actors, processes and social systems are implied in the project management, they influence each other and their combinations include a variety of participation processes. Three principles of housing autonomy emerge from this self-built process.\n\nFirst, participation in housing implies user control over the entire project. The beneficiary must have a significant decision-making power over design, planning, financing, and management of the project. The autonomy that the owner-builder benefits from exists and prevails due to his capacity to articulate essential resources such as land, local construction materials, financial and human capital, expertise and building tools.\n\nSecond, housing must be seen as a process rather than a product. Its values lie in the inter-action between the actors, their activities and the house. In the informal sector, the organizational design - that implies the user’s coordination between these three elements - is allowed by the existence of a decentralized market of housing components and resources. Its market has a large network of independent actors and suppliers that offer a necessary variety of construction means. This multiplicity of choice creates the opportunity for the user to combine different options and respond to his specific needs through collective arrangements. The role of social networks and know-how transfer is also important in strengthening individual capacities and diversifies the user’s lines of action. These networks allow a freedom of action and choice, which is fundamental to an autonomous housing system. In addition, the informal housing financing modes are essential. As we question their role and the ways in which they benefit the development of the economy, we note that they are the ones financing the small and medium sized enterprises, particularly in the construction sector.\n\nThird, a self-help housing strategy implies a change of the role of planners, architects and the state. The application of user control to the assembly of the housing components and its management means a greater dependence on the user’s capacity to negotiate land prices and the process of acquiring and transferring property rights, accessing tools and materials, financial resources, and architectural expertise. These resources are a function of law and its administration, which are controlled by the central authority. The self-help approach to housing isn’t a combination of the formal and informal as it used to be understood, but rather a combination between two inter-linked and open systems in which the state and professionals assist people’s activities in planning, designing, building and managing housing projects. This co-responsible model demonstrates that the housing production environment has a complex role in identity formation and determines the strengthening, (or inversely), the weakening of the community’s capacity to meaningfully participate to the project.\n\nIt is by these characteristics of its structure of authority and control that the informal modes of housing production in Cairo create a resilient and user-generated city. These processes identify the tendencies of emerging cities, which define the global conditions of contemporary urbanization. It is a reality that calls for the recognition of the ways people are already participating in the formation of their living environments and the need to use these emerging processes to engage with ‘informality’ from a planning and architectural perspective. This implies a dramatic change in the approach to the phenomenon. Overcoming its legalistic approach and understanding the organizational potential to promote requires a shift from a top-down planning system to a heterogeneous system of multiple networks in the construction sector, which includes artisans, entrepreneurs, technologies, and financial mechanisms. In fact, housing should be thought in its integral complexity, by identifying and prioritizing its interdependent tendencies and avoiding a sectorial approach, which mostly ignores and fragments them.\n\nIman Salama is a designer and urban planner who is pursuing her PhD in Geography at the University of Geneva on the socio-spatial dimensions of the incremental development process of popular neighborhoods in Cairo.\n\nBook: Jours Tranquilles au Caire\n\nIsabelle Mayault\n\nThe following is a translated extract from the book Jours Tranquilles au Caire (Quiet days in Cairo), by Isabelle Mayault, published in March 2015 in French by the Paris-based publishing house Riveneuve. The book is part of the series Quiet days in… which comprises Gaza, Beirut, Ramallah and Kabul. Jours Tranquilles au Caire is a collection of first-person chronicles narrating daily life in Cairo between spring 2012 and summer 2014, from one presidential election to another, through the eyes of a young female journalist. It is available online, as well as in Cairo at Oum el Dounia and Livres de France bookstores.\n\nOf white and grass / Sept. 30th, 2012\n\nWithout warning, they decided that Tahrir should be rid of its tents, and Mohammed Mahmoud street of its tattoos. Grass and fresh paint were needed to advertise for the dawn of a new Egypt. Gardeners and painters were swiftly sent over and, under the scrutiny of dozens of Cairenes, the men in grey jumpsuits transformed the most famous square of the Arab world into what looked like a Scandinavian urban landscape. White and grass !\n\nAfter 20 months of turmoil, weekly demos, slogans shout out in megaphones, street vendors grilling corn and activists spending the night on the square, seated on the rotunda’s low-wall, clearing the most symbolic place in the country appeared to many like a wild move. Someone within the government had lost patience. The president himself, maybe. Tahrir needed to look clean again, in order to show that the revolution was behind, and the future, ahead.\n\nFor those who had hung out on Tahrir since winter 2011, watching the freshly added central lawn could be an odd view. It was pretty much like coming back home from a long holiday and finding it emptied out of its furniture. It was not a nice feeling either to discover Mohammed Mahmoud’s walls covered with a thick white layer of paint, awkwardly concealing its famous revolutionary graffitis. Month after month, famous artists and amateurs alike had left their mark on them, their inspiration ranging from Ancient Egypt to a more warholian touch.\n\nAs soon as the next day, however, something unexpected happened: dozens of artists gathered again in the famous street and for the following five days, they dedicated their time to making all the white disappear. That week, Mohammed Mahmoud filled up with passersby curious to see the walls coming back to life: here, a mother and her two daughters, after school, deciphering revolutionary slogans; there, men in their cars slowing down and leaning their heads outside to get a glimpse of the iconic fury. Some even got off their cars and stood for half an hour, sometimes more, hands in their backs. Intense talks regarding the future of Egypt occurred between students and old men.\n\nOne particularly large graffiti paid homage to the fifty something people who had lost their lives during the Mohammed Mahmoud clashes, almost a year before. And for several days, people were crowded in front of it, taking pictures before this graffiti too would be swept out by a new white tide.\n\nGeography of a revolution / November, 20th 2012\n\nIt begins with clashes in the night. Some kids are throwing rocks on Mohamed Mahmoud Street. They’re bored, have nothing to do and come from poor neighborhoods: this is what is said about them. And yet, their cause is a just one: they clash with police in memory of their friends who died the same week in November one year earlier. Sixty died in total, some were shot in the head or chest. When you take the time to talk to them, those who are still alive and throwing rocks into the empty darkness, they say, “We will not forget. They must know that we will not forget.”\n\nThe atmosphere in Tahrir Square is tense. Cars are scarce, and some taxis refuse to enter the square. Going there in groups at night is recommended, especially for girls. At this particular moment we can still laugh at the cowardly drivers; what do they think Tahrir is, a minefield? The clashes are concentrated on Mohamed Mahmoud, well away from the square. Three days later tear gas is launched into that same square and the neighborhood begins to stir. It’s at once gradual and fast.\n\nAfter the decree / November, 23rd 2012\n\nOn Friday, after a night of clashes spurred by the president’s surprise decree, the crowds took hold of Tahrir just like they’re used to. Throngs of families and other groups flowed in from all directions, welcoming the arrival of newcomers. Merchants and vendors took their places before the crowds, accommodating demands with remarkable agility, gas masks made in China piled up among their wares. For a low-budget alternative, there are also hospital masks at one Egyptian pound each. It’s a good deal but not very effective, which most do not learn unfortunately until after learning the hard way under a rain of tear gas. A new wall was built across Qasr el Aini Street, a main tributary from the south and center. This is a classic attempt to contain the flow of masses, futile in Egypt as anywhere else. Around the world there are famous walls known by everyone and while these walls near Tahrir are not yet famous, they are a sign, a provocation. The army has not had its last word.\n\nNor have the revolutionaries, and two hours later the already yellowing walls have been painted with a large black smiley face, jeering and triumphant. The more diligent cars skirt around the wall, veering left towards the Nile two hundred meters before Tahrir through the normally calm upper-class neighborhood of Garden City. It’s only a matter of hours before new traffic rules take shape. The roads are no longer one-way as taxis charge against the flow of traffic along the Corniche: no one planned on letting a wall hold them back. Qasr el Aini was flanked by barbed wire and pedestrians adapt naturally to detours. People still need to go about their business as usual after all.\n\nWalls blossom / November 27th, 2012\n\nWhen building walls, why not build two? After five days of geographic stability, the army has backslided. All night long–three days ago–trucks were deployed amidst the din of flying rocks in front of the American embassy outside of Tahrir. The operation is carried out under the leadership of Simon Bolivar, whose statue overlooks the embassy as the war of rocks and tear gas transpires on the adjoining street. Thus, the path between the Corniche and Tahrir by Bolivar Street is cut off. At the time the bronze face of the Libertador is covered with a hospital mask by a noble revolutionary.\n\nThose are the same kids who celebrated their martyr friends nonchalantly. However, during the time that had passed since then, the figurative political hand had changed – Tahrir was occupied and Egypt seemed posed to launch another revolution. It was not time to stand down. The narrow street was no longer big enough: so, the playing field between youth and the police stretched all the way down to the Corniche. Cars have begun to abandon this route through the crowds. Now it is by “the interior”, the heart of Cairo with its row of ministries crowded with brown trucks and cronies that they most cross to rally in Tahrir. The detour is longer than previous ones, but still doable by car or on foot. A 30-minute jog should do it, no reason to complain.\n\nOn Friday during the third day of mass assembly, Talaat Harb, a major artery in north-central Cairo, is made pedestrian-only. Earlier in the week, cars had already begun to give up. The sound of heated verbal sparring poured out from the sidewalks until the early hours of the morning. This time it’s not the merchants selling cream, koshary, and drinks that inconveniently block the entrance and bicker with irate drivers. Now it’s the same barbed wire that impedes the side streets to the south of the square. There too, the road is twisted and windy. There is no doubt: it is by the number of pedestrians in Cairo that we can gauge the revolution.\n\nThe City of the High Dam\n\nAlia Mortada\n\nIntro\n\n“Men of Egypt! Women and children…\n\nHere, before the whole world, is a living symbol of your will, power, persistence, work capacity, and sacrifice.\n\nHere, this High Dam, is a victory souvenir over all obstacles.\n\nHere is a clear picture of your dreams, realized by the mighty work which subordinates nature, regardless of price in blood and sweat, to assert man’s determination, with God’s spirit and guidance, to honor, and be honored, by life. Friends, citizens, no spot in the world materializes the great struggle of the contemporary Arab, in its full scope, as this site on which we stand, the site of the Aswan High Dam.\n\nHere, the political, social, national, and military battles of the Egyptian people materialize as the bulk of the great rock which blocked the old Nile waterway, to accumulate its waters into the biggest lake ever made by man, as a permanent source of prosperity.”\n\nExtract from Gamal Abdel Nasser’s the speech on the occasion of the diversion of the Nile River, 14th May 1964\n\nHistory/Background\n\nIn 1964 newly cultivated settlements in the desert north of Aswan were arranged to house the Egyptian Nubians after a massive relocation campaign that was part of the construction of the Aswan High Dam and behind it the ‘biggest lake ever made by man’. However, despite the fact that the Nubian community was “compensated” for the loss of its land on the banks of the Nile River, this loss could not be materially indemnified. The relocation of the community by the state did not only lead to the loss of land but also to a struggle for the community’s identity and culture. By relocating the Nubians away from the Nile and out of their villages their camaraderie and sense of community were deeply affected. Songs that were sung after the resettlement tell stories of the Nile and express a deep yearning for the flooded homeland. At the same time, some of the Nubians perceived their loss as a contribution to the common good of all Egyptians, and prayed that the Nile would be as good to Nasser as it has been to them.\n\nThe preparations for the Aswan High Dam construction site constituted a budget of 5 million Egyptian pounds and entailed the extension of the Nile Valley railway line, the construction of a power connector to the power plant of the Aswan Old Dam as well as workshops and workers’ settlements with their associated infrastructure. However, the dam that promoted an egalitarian society and national unity did not reflect that on an urban scale. Engineers, foreign experts and technicians lived in well-built compounds and were offered a wide range of facilities and services while the laborers and builders lived in informal shacks and tents. Forty-three years after the completion of the dam, the workers’ settlements still exist and have developed into multiple quarters. The old construction site workshops are left unused.\n\nProject description\n\nThe following proposal explores the Aswan High Dam as a mega-project of a previous era, a piece of infrastructure of great national and geopolitical significance that once promised a new futures for the nation, for society and for the nation’s refashioned subjects. This monumental structure, which altered the Nile River’s ecosystem and landscape, as well as Egypt’s agriculture and energy supply, also triggered through its insertion a widely overlooked process of urban development - one that this study unravels. The research presents a retroactive reflection on the construction plan of the dam and puts forward the hypothesis that this plan - in fact - led to the unforeseen creation of a new city, the City of the High Dam. Following an on-site investigation of the geographical, urban and architectural parameters surrounding the dam, the proposal translates the findings into a history of creation of the “City of the High Dam” from 1944 until today and imagines a vision for this - fictional on paper, but very much existing - city in 2064, one hundred years after the dam’s construction.\n\nThe built environment in the immediate vicinity of the Aswan High Dam today is an agglomeration of districts of different characters and functions. Roads that are kilometers long cut through granite deserts connecting industrial and residential areas as well as educational facilities, landmarks and touristic temples. Electrical transmission towers dominate the landscape. The last Nile Valley railway station is located on the eastern riverbank overlooking Lake Nasser and the harbor - which together with a weekly ferry constitute the only connection to Wadi Halfa, the next city on the Sudanese border.\n\nThe presented design considers existing functions in the city as an archipelago and attempts to link them and complement them with places of gathering and public functions that were the main components of every old Nubian village and community. It proposes alternative solutions to perceive the dam - the reason for the city’s existence and its main resource - as part of the urban fabric and consequently to create a city center around it.\n\nHow can loose agglomerations of infrastructural, residential and administrative buildings amount to a whole, complete and connected city? What are the limitations of design in a location of great social, political and economic complexities? How could this city evolve 100 years after the completion of the dam? Is it possible to revive traces of a lost community? And, how can the City of the High Dam reach its full potential of becoming an important port city at the end of the Egyptian Nile Valley and a gateway to Africa?\n\nThe Aswan High Dam Authority owns most of the land surrounding the dam, and is responsible for its maintenance and security. Therefore, the complete area is spatially controlled by a number of political and security measures around the dam dictated and shaped the ways in which the nearby urban settlement developed:\n\n1. A dividing line between the two riverbanks for 12 hours of the day, where the dam is inaccessible to cars and pedestrians (from 5:30 pm to 06:00 am).\n\n2. A 1 km safety radius around the dam where no boats are allowed to come near the structure.\n\n3. A derelict granite quarry that is meant to become a granite reserve for the dam.\n\nIn the past, these security measures have limited the development of the city. The proposed project however, looks at them today as areas of potential urban and architectural interventions of different scales in the city. The first intervention is planning a public transport system, composed of the existing train line connecting the city to Aswan, a new bus as well as ferryboat network and a cable car line. This transport system allows the process of city formation that had started 40 years ago to develop further, faster and in a more purposeful way. The newly inserted bus, ferry and cable car stations embody starting points for the creation of new quarters, and designing these stations and how they interact with the existing sites on different scales constitute the second intervention of this project. Furthermore, the stations are designed to become meeting points and transit hubs that would restore a lost community spirit. The cable car stations are placed at the highest points of the city whereas the ferryboat stations are located very close to the Nile and its immediate landscape. The bus stations on the roads offer fleeting views of the different city districts, which make it possible to fully experience the entire city through its public transport.\n\nThe cable car line is an attempt to work against the dividing line that intersects the city, and makes it possible for the two riverbanks to be connected throughout the entire day. The site of the cable car station on the eastern riverbank was chosen along the promenade, which is informally used today by workers as a place of gathering after a hard day at work to watch the Nile water flow through the turbines of the hydropower station at sunset. Its insertion would enhance the flow of people to this site, which offers a breathtaking view over the dam and the Aswan reservoir. The promenade would become a linear market, where the vendors could sell vegetables and fruits as well as Sudanese goods that arrive regularly at the harbor. The cable car reaches the other side of the river at a station at the derelict granite quarry, which would trigger the development of a new residential and cultural district - the “Granite Quarter”. This would be the closest quarter to the dam, and therefore together with the promenade, the new city center. The landscape of the quarry is to be used to host a new small amphitheater.\n\nThe new Aswan Reservoir ferryboat line would connect the islands in the reservoir to the new city center. In addition, the Lake Nasser ferryboat line is designed to make the touristic sites and temples, i.e. Kalabsha Tempel and Abu Simbel, publicly accessible and to enhance the use of the lake as a public recreational area.\n\nThe bus stops are located along the existing roads and residential districts and near existing institutional facilities, such as the post office, the school, the Aswan University campus and dormitory, the Aswan International Airport, the harbor and the Aswan High Dam Authority. The bus lines are linked with the new ferryboat and cable car stations and lines, leading to an interconnected and efficient transportation system. By changing the mode of transport multiple times within one commute, the city becomes easily readable for inhabitants as well as visitors. The stations and the spaces they define are meant to be reminders of the market places in the old Nubian villages. Depending on the their scale and location they shape spaces where different patterns of activities and encounters can take place; from having a cup of tea while waiting for the bus to playing a game of backgammon at the ferry station and trading goods near the cable car station. Unlike traditional urban sprawl, where cities grow towards their peripheries, the proposed interventions aim that the city of the High Dam would grow inward toward the dam.\n\nBy 2064, High Dam City would still be governed by the Aswan High Dam Authority. Reviving the spirit of the old Nubian villages, the city would be self-sustainable and would not be based on private land ownership. The city could then be fully experienced through its transport network and would have a well-developed city center. The inhabitants could experience their city on their daily commute to work, school or university from different viewpoints and at varying speeds. The dam would no longer be an alien infrastructural body dividing the city but rather a palimpsest of the city’s own history, a city landmark and a place of gathering.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe project intends to reveal the rich history of this location and emphasizes its specific cultural identity. Moreover, it provokes a discussion about the boundaries of visionary urbanism and how it stands in contrast to notions of Utopia. Rather than (consciously) criticizing past political and infrastructural decisions, this project’s contribution lies in using visionary urbanism as a tool to criticize the limits of reality as accepted by planners today and seeks to visually project the “still possible”.\n\nIn the light of the anticipated development of the New Suez Canal Project, again questions about the process of planning big scale infrastructural projects in Egypt must be raised. The Suez Canal Corridor Development Project is the latest announced project in a series of ambitious development plans since the 1950s. These projects—triggered by the government’s fervor of mega projects as a solution for Egypt’s demographic and economic problems—become the government’s publicly hyped attempts to distract from daily economic and political problems through promoting a strategy of ‘we plan, we build, we deliver’. However, often what is promised to be delivered—if it ever reaches such stage (note: Toshka, among many others)—also leads to major unplanned urban and social changes that take place beyond the drilling and excavation work and continue to develop for years after the project’s completion. The discrepancy of abstract visions of political leaders and the urban situations they impact in reality has an immense effect on Egyptian cities and their residents, which raises questions about the role of military planning today: In a city like “High Dam City” or even the “New City of Toshka” where militarized zones of exception proliferate, what/who then defines the city? Who plans its city center, public spaces and transport systems? Is there a way around individual and communal sacrifices of land for the “common national good”? And will history repeat itself in the cities of the Suez Canal Zone?\n\nAlia Mortada received her Bachelor and Master in Architecture from RWTH Aachen University, Germany.
