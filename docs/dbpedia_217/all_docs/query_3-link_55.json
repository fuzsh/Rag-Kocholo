A major scholarly library of research now exists to document Arab women’s activism from the nineteenth century to the present. This literature tackles a variety of issues, including voting rights, nationality rights, citizenship, family law, children’s advocacy, the environment, education, civil liberties, and democratic governance. Indeed, one can argue that there has never been a period in which Arab women did not express agency through a variety of political pathways. Yet, the representation of Arab women in Western news, social media, popular culture, and even in some scholarship often continues to reproduce the Orientalist tropes of Arab women as apolitical, as having no access to politics, or as politically silent/silenced. The Arab Spring of 2011 is often represented as an apparition, a fleeting moment of female activism that sparked an awakening only to be crushed. Women Rising: In and Beyond the Arab Spring attends to Arab women’s activism in the Arab Spring not as a fleeting moment, but as one moment in a long genealogy of Arab women’s activism. Women Rising is a volume of hope grounded in history and in the lived present. The editors, Rita Stephan and Mounira M. Charrad, argue that “there is no going back” and that democracy in the Arab region is not dead. Rather, they remind us, political transformations are “messy, lengthy, and problematic.” Change is not just coming, they contend, but it is occurring in the daily lives of women who stand up and fight for themselves, their families, and their people through engagements that become readily visible to the public, as well as through enactments that, while not recorded, nevertheless contribute to the small streams that eventually turn into rivers of change. Women Rising brings together voices of women across the nations of the Arab region—from Libya, Egypt, Lebanon, Palestine, Iraq, Moxiii\n\nxiv | Foreword\n\nrocco, Algeria, Bahrain, Yemen, Jordan, and Syria—and on and on. The editors bring forward voices from different religious and ethnic groups, across religious “divides” that they expose for their misrepresentation of women’s conditionalities. They attend to voices of women across class, regional, and urban/rural arenas. They recognize the importance of transnational Arab women’s voices, as these Arab women, spread across the globe, continue to invest in the transformations of their home countries. They intentionally trespass into and through topics less voiced, including sexual rights and sexual minorities—and protests, which are often ignored, such as “garbage” protests. They engage the many debates animating women activists across the region—constitutional reform, personal status laws, “Islamism” and “democracy,” movements of nonviolence, militarism, authoritarianism, and sectarianism. They create spaces for the many forms in which these debates voice themselves— through art, photography, films, popular culture, cyberspace, blogging, graffiti, soundscapes, poetry, journalism, and the like. They track the many spaces that are created by women activists—universities, streets, villages, checkpoints, public plazas designated as “male” terrain, city centers, courtyards, and homes. They analyze the methods and tactics used by women activists to disrupt, unsettle, undo the structural, the institutional, the given, the normative, and the hegemonic. In capturing these spaces, Stephan and Charrad mean to do some undoing themselves. They critique transnational feminists who homogenize Arab women’s activism within a unifying subaltern frame that manages to gaze only through a single lens. They challenge the ahistorical rendering of Arab women as having only “woken up” with the Arab Spring. They offer a correction to much scholarship, as well as popular culture, that finds comfort in the reproduction of the Arab woman as “victim” needing Western rescue. They take on sisterly Third World feminist literature, which is largely based on Latin America, Africa, and East Asia, by making the case for the specificity of the contexts of Arab women as countries that are generally not poor, have oil wealth unevenly distributed, and have a vast range of political and cultural experiences. They offer theoretical perspectives on resistance, revolution, and reform to inform the readings of the many voices brought forth in the volume. Women Rising quilts together the stories, the views, the values, the experiences, the approaches, the styles, and the analyses of Arab women\n\nForeword\n\n|\n\nxv\n\nthroughout the Arab region and beyond. The stitching together of stories designed from so many fabrics of life is precisely what is needed to resist and undo the essentialism that continues to plague the representation of Arab women. Here, Stephan and Charrad assemble many pieces held together by threads of history into the present and beyond—the many spools, the many fabrics, the many colors—vibrant and alive to the lived realities. The totality is not one cover, but a patchwork—always in the making, always doing and undoing, always moved by agency and intent going forward and not back, and, despite the messy unfinished business, continuing to unfold as full of promise.\n\nIntroduction Advancing Women’s Rights in the Arab World Rita Stephan and Mounira M. Charrad\n\nWhen women flamed in protests from Tunisia to Yemen calling for political reforms, the world was quick to proclaim that Arab women had finally risen. Some claimed that “this was the first time so many women from so many different backgrounds had joined demonstrations.”1 Unfortunately, the world had not paid attention to Arab women protesting, voting, running for office, and leading organizations since the 1920s, through the Arab Spring years, and up until today. The events of the Arab Spring, a period during which women’s activism intensified, were only a historical marker that brought women’s activism to the forefront. The Arab Spring gained prominence in international politics with the 2011 Egyptian protests in Tahrir Square against the Mubarak regime, following the protests in Tunisia, where the Arab Spring started. After a month of protest, much of which was captured on social media, Mubarak fled Egypt and both the Parliament and the constitution were dissolved (Clarke 2011). For many casual Western observers, Tahrir Square events were unique, if not surprising. However, for those who have been following the region’s history, the 2011 Egyptian revolution marks only one dynamic part of a larger series of events known as the Arab uprisings. These uprisings, arguably, accumulated the social tension that has been rising in the region since the 2004 Kefaya Egyptian Movement for Change (Clarke 2011) and the 2005 Lebanese Cedar Revolution (Stephan 2018). Frustration heightened by the end of 2010, and spread quickly throughout the region. The spark that started the Arab Spring was the one with which the young Tunisian man, Mohamed Bouazizi, set himself on fire in response to police brutality, on December 17, 2010. This event triggered notable 1\n\n2\n\n| Rita Stephan and Mounira M. Charrad\n\npublic agitation and drove supporters to protest and topple the regime in Tunisia. The domino effect of protests followed in Bahrain, Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait, Libya, Morocco, Saudi Arabia, Syria, and Yemen, with shy endeavors in Algeria, Iraq, Oman, and Palestine. Some protests achieved a change of regimes, as in Tunisia, Egypt, and Lebanon (in 2005). Others developed into violent encounters that left the protesters in a deadlock with their governments, as in Bahrain; and others turned into bloody civil wars, as in Yemen, Libya, and Syria. In some countries, major reforms were implemented, as in Morocco, Kuwait, and Jordan. Minor reforms were also introduced in Algeria, Oman, and Saudi Arabia— ending these protests shortly thereafter,2 though they reignited in 2019 in Algeria, Iraq, Lebanon, and Sudan. Several years after the Arab Spring, Tunisia, a budding democracy, continues to fight corruption and extremism; Syria, Libya, and Yemen are torn between war and Islamic extremism; Egypt is slowly sliding into becoming a dictatorship and a sexually dangerous environment for women; and the Gulf countries continue to be preoccupied with their crowns’ stability and with containing dissident voices. Morocco, Jordan, Lebanon, and Algeria are trying to appease their constituents by introducing social, economic, political, and legal reforms, on the one hand, while managing their financial crises and curbing the appeal of extremism and emigration on the other. Some have been quick to write democracy’s obituary in the region, but we argue that the democratic transition to consolidation is messy, lengthy, and problematic. Like us, however, the contributors to this volume believe that there is no going back. Social and political norms that have traditionally rewarded compliance are now changing to encourage innovation; male-dominated social structures and powers are now shaken; and women have gained confidence in their ability to influence politics and to challenge the secular-Islamist power poles. We believe that a social revolution has made women more self-assured of their collective power to fight exclusion, silence, and oppression. Women Rising: In and Beyond the Arab Spring features women fighting for reforms; resisting oppression; and engaging in protests and revolutions to change the status quo. The volume also takes these terms beyond the chronological, geographical, and thematic spaces of the Arab Spring and explores women’s agency before and after the events of the Arab Spring\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n3\n\nthemselves. While the majority of the pieces in this volume focus on women’s activism during the Arab Spring uprisings, ten chapters emphasize the expressions of women’s agency that predate this era. By providing historical context for women’s political activism long before the Arab Spring, these contributions shake the claim that Arab women just “woke up” in 2011. In the same vein, women’s struggle for rights extends beyond this historical marker, and seven pieces continue into the aftermath of the Arab Spring, viewing subsequent events from a variety of angles. The voices of Women Rising include those of activists, politicians, scholars, and many others. We bring to the fore voices we rarely hear, such as those of filmmakers, poets, students, and artists, as well as those who have been silenced, like rural women, queer feminists, and housewives. In their own voices, women give testimony on how their activism shaped the fight for democracy, liberty, and human rights. This volume creates a space for multiple forms that include literary expression, street art, photographic discourse analysis, interviews, critical biography, testimonies, ethnographic interpretation, and political commentary. The forty essays in this volume bear witness to women’s activism, and to the way women mitigated the threats and obstacles that they faced in Algeria, Bahrain, Egypt, Iraq, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, Libya, Morocco, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Sudan, Syria, Tunisia, Yemen, and even the Arab diaspora. The essays combine analysis and testimony by authors from diverse communities in the region as well as Australia, Japan, Canada, Europe, and the United States. The forty chapters reflect questions posed by local, national, and transnational activists on the topics of beliefs, identity, agency, mobilization, and resistance. The pieces vary in the type of discourse with which they engage, the type of data they use, and the type of subjects they address. While Western media and the world community have focused on popular political topics such as the toppling of regimes and the occupying of popular places like Tahrir Square, contributions to this volume take readers to remote spaces and introduce them to unusual topics. Contributors tell their stories from their personal experiences as activists or participant observers, and analysts weave first-hand accounts of activism with analytic commentary to answer important questions, such as what Arab women fought for or believed in and how they expressed their agency, mobilized through space, and organized these movements.\n\n4\n\n| Rita Stephan and Mounira M. Charrad\n\nTheoretical Contributions of Women Rising We present resistance, revolution, and reform as three theoretical concepts that correspond to three bodies of literature. The Arab Spring events brought new challenges to the fields of feminism, social movements, and gender politics, as we know them.\n\nResisting Feminist Narrative Just as Arab women resisted oppressive regimes, their activism was also a form of resistance to the ways they have been portrayed in the narrative of Western, transnational, and even Third World feminisms. Their actions during the uprisings revealed the shortcomings of Arab women’s overwhelming misrepresention as “victims” and as subordinate by nature (Mohanty 1991); who operate in a highly patriarchal setting (Enloe 2013; Peterson and Runyan 2010); and whose activism is limited to “bargaining with patriarchy” (Kandiyoti 1988). This misrepresentation strips Arab women from their feminism and denies them agency and “the ability to exercise their own approaches to local and global problem solving” (Peterson and Runyan 2010, 127). Western scholars who claim expertise on global and Middle Eastern gender politics often misinterpret Arab women’s activism as lacking feminist consciousness or identification (Ray and Korteweg 1999). Other Western feminists tend to believe that gender struggle is universal; in other words, women everywhere tend to face similar oppression merely by virtue of their sex/gender, and regardless of their cultural or geopolitical context (Tong and Botts 2009). Therefore, these feminists assume that they can play a leadership role in saving, and speaking on behalf of, Third World, minority, and Arab women. Equally misrepresentative of Arab women’s activism are transnational feminists who view gender inequality from a single global lens that focuses on the intersection of nationality, sex, class, and race. They assume that a unified subaltern identity exists among all victims of colonialism and imperialism (Alexander and Mohanty 1997; Enloe 2000). While colonial powers are indeed oppressive, past and present, Arabs’ relations with them have been complicated, before and after the Arab Spring. Internal conflicts and unusual alliances have made Western forces the lesser of two evils in some instances, and have aided Arab women’s re-\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n5\n\nsistance to their corrupt regimes, oppressive laws, and restrictive social norms. In their position of rejecting nation-states and viewing nationalism as detrimental to feminism, transnational feminists have claimed hegemony over the discourse on Third World women (Herr 2014). The Arab Spring showed that women’s struggle within the context of the nation-state is still relevant, and that the nostalgic feelings of global sisterhood were shaken even within the region’s boundaries. The literature on Third World feminism does not fully represent Arab feminists either. Despite sharing a colonial heritage with East Asia, Latin America, and sub-Saharan Africa, Arab women view their experience as hybrid (Tzoreff 2014). Moreover, Third World feminist literature, which is based mostly on the experience of these East Asian, African, and Latin America women (Mohanty 1991; Tong and Botts 2009), assumes that, by extension, their struggles apply to Arab women (Golley 2007). But this is not the case. Arab women see themselves living in a geography that is hybrid economically, politically, and socially. Economically, one third of Arab countries are high income, and the rest are either high-middle or lower-middle income.3 Politically, Arab countries range among oil-rich monarchies, dictatorships, and quasi democracies. Socially, Arab norms vary between conservative Saudi Arabian and westernized Lebanese. With these diverse characteristics, Arab women tend to construct their feminism vis-à-vis Western, transnational, and Third World feminisms, on an intersectional understanding of nation, patriarchy, and Islam as both resources for mobilization and grounds for revolution and reform.\n\nSocial Revolutions Numerous experts argue that the Arab Spring uprisings were failed revolutions that have instead produced violence and renewed state repression. They claim that a true shift in politics, institutions, and identities did not occur (Cook 2017) and that “most rulers of the Middle East managed to survive the uprisings of 2011 . . . [and] dictators have strengthened their grip on power” (Kurzman 2013, 14–15). Typically, democratic transitions are multicausal, notoriously difficult, and unpredictably nonlinear. Goldstone (2011) reminds us, “Revolutions are just the beginning of a long process. Even after a peaceful revolution,\n\n6\n\n| Rita Stephan and Mounira M. Charrad\n\nit generally takes half a decade for any type of stable regime to consolidate,” and Kurzman further posits, “Most new democracies fail. They dissolve into civil wars, or are overtaken by coups or collapse under authoritarian bureaucrats and demagogues” (2016). We propose to shift the evaluation of the Arab Spring to a different spectrum and caution against declaring the game “over.” The uprisings of the Arab Spring did not produce revolutions in the sense of “rapid, basic transformations of a society’s state and class structures” as defined by Skocpol (1979, 4). However, they did raise citizens’ awareness of the power of collective action. We believe that while the foundations for democratic transition were not present before the Arab Spring, they certainly emerged with it. What we see as irreversible after the Arab Spring is the fact that citizens now realize the power of collective action: protest and campaigning. At the very least, the Arab Spring uprisings produced a political environment amenable to advancing women’s political participation and contentious collective action. Simply put, the revolution of Arab women resulted in their increased participation in public life, increased representation in decision making, and emboldened leadership of women’s organizations. The rising rates of women’s participation in the public sphere also led them to assume a larger role in governance (IRI 2016). In December 2016, the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU)4 reported that women’s representation in Parliament (single or lower house) in the Arab states reached 19.1 percent, compared to 12.5 percent in 2010 (the lowest in the world then). This advancement, however, does not reflect improving conditions for women in all Arab countries. Arab women continue to face “obstacles toward achieving parity in elected legislative bodies,” and despite many great achievements, “stark variations across the region in terms of the numerical presence of women in Arab parliaments” remain (Shalaby 2016). Since 2011, women have also infiltrated the contentious collective space en masse. They fought for women’s rights and representation as parts of the larger effort to achieve greater political and economic reforms. They made their claim not only through women’s organizations but also in nongovernmental, nonprofit, governmental, and for-profit entities. Although, to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive data has been collected on women’s organizations in the region, the chapters in this volume provide evidence of the activism that is taking place. In a nutshell, however\n\nIntroduction\n\n| 7\n\ndiverse their geographies and societies might have been, women’s participation in the Arab Spring has elevated their ability to influence the decision-making process. Despite being underrepresented in the new political order, women are refusing to take the back seat.\n\nReforms in Gender Politics Historically, liberalization of women’s rights in the region has been initiated primarily from above. In exploring the process of expanding women’s rights in the Tunisian Law of Personal Status in 1956, Charrad (2001 and 2011) shows that reforms were a state-building strategy, initiated in the absence of on-the-ground activism, designed to weaken tribal governance, and to contribute to the formation of a “modern” centralized state. This top-down model locates power as it relates to gender in the state, rather than in civil society or the public. Whereas the bottom-up, grassroots model suggests that people’s dissatisfaction with the gendered social order results in pressure and social change, the top-down model demonstrates how the agency of the state shapes power as it relates to gender. Since the Arab Spring, women have intensified pressure from below in efforts to introduce reforms in gender politics. Women collaborated with international actors, civil society organizations, private sector partners, and “willing” state actors to pass a number of legal reforms that protect women’s rights, combat gender-based violence, and promote gender equality. Most notable were laws (listed in chronological order from most recent) criminalizing gender-based violence in Jordan, Lebanon, Morocco, Tunisia, and Algeria and laws advancing social and political rights in Saudi Arabia and Tunisia: In 2019, • Saudi Arabia passed a law allowing women to travel without male consent.5 In 2017, • Saudi Arabia passed a law allowing women to drive and ending a longstanding policy that has become a global symbol of the oppression of women in the ultraconservative kingdom.6 • the lower house of Parliament in Jordan removed Penal Code Article 308, which had made rape permissible if the rapist marries the victim. The\n\n8\n\n| Rita Stephan and Mounira M. Charrad\n\nredaction is still waiting to be approved by the Upper House and signed by King Abdullah II.7 • the Lebanese Parliament agreed to abolish Penal Code Article 522, the infamous “rape law” or “rape-marriage” law, which exempted a rapist from punishment if he married his victim.8 • the Tunisian Parliament passed a law on “Eliminating Violence against Women,” which stipulates that gender-based crimes of a physical, moral, sexual, or economic nature are punishable offenses. A first-of-its-kind law, it eliminated the loophole for rapists to avoid punishment by marrying their victims.9 • Iraq allowed women to apply for a passport in the same way as men, passed legislation on sexual harassment in employment, imposed criminal penalties or civil remedies for sexual harassment in employment, and gave women at least fourteen weeks of paid maternity leave.10 In 2016, • Algeria passed a law that punishes violence against women and sexual harassment.11 • Egypt passed legislation on sexual harassment in employment, and imposed criminal penalties or civil remedies for sexual harassment in employment.12 In 2014, • Tunisia passed the first constitution in the Arab world to use the language of equality between men and women, in addition to safeguarding the rights won by Tunisian women in 1959, including the right to divorce, marriage by mutual consent, and the banning of polygamy.13 • the Moroccan Parliament unanimously amended Article 475 in the Penal Code, which allowed a rapist to escape prosecution if he married his underage victim.14 • Bahrain amended labor laws to require nondiscrimination based on gender in employment.15 In 2013, • King Abdallah of Saudi Arabia allowed women to run for the 2015 municipal election and to join the Shura Council and hold at least one fifth of its 150 seats.16\n\nIntroduction\n\n|\n\n9\n\nWhile the passage of all these laws can be dismissed as an attempt by “liberalizing” states to appease the international community and appear democratic, one cannot deny that on-the-ground activism was influential in the passing of so many gender laws in the region. Major transformations occurred in Arab women’s ability to respond to existing and new challenges. They gained momentum to personalize their agency and make their voices heard, as the chapters in this volume reveal.\n\nWomen’s Voices in This Volume Building on their experiences in mobilizing for women’s rights, and on their analyses of women’s activism, the authors in this volume provide a rich and nuanced understanding of women’s agency and mobilization before, during, and following the Arab Spring. They offer the reader a unique perspective on what may be one of the most significant historical developments of our times. We aim for this volume, with women’s agency as its central focus, to give voice to Arab women as they tell their own stories of activism for democracy, social justice, and women’s rights.

Activists made political claims of their status as citizens, women, workers, political actors, queer activists, nonviolent resisters, and advocates against sexual violence. Political claims are “morallylegitimated demands” that become recognized as rights through persuasive interactions.1 Activists use claim making as the “purposive and public articulation of political demands, calls to action, proposals, criticisms or physical attacks.”2 The chapters in this section show how women used claim making to challenge the status quo and fight against violence, oppression, and injustice. Rula Quawas encourages her students to claim their voice in the cultural transformation of Jordan while Nadine Naber documents women workers’ struggles over class oppression in Egypt. Former Kuwaiti parliamentary member Aseel Alawadhi shares her personal fight for political participation, and Amal Amireh searches for the voice of Palestinian queers in the claim for nationalism. Lina Abirafeh and ABAAD bring men into the effort to combat violence against women, and Ginger Feather carries Najia Adib’s voice in breaking the silence on pedophilia in Morocco. Finally, Syrian American activist and scholar Mohja Kahf highlights Syrian women’s nonviolent resistance against militarism and fundamentalism, and Aminah Ali Kandar features the leadership role of women in the nonviolent uprisings in Yemen. This collection starts with Rula Quawas, the prominent champion of women’s advancement in Jordan, who passed away on July 27, 2017. Rula was the founder of the Women’s Studies Centre at the University of Jordan. Her journey embodies the theme of this collection, and her lifelong goal was to empower young women and challenge patriarchal structures. 13\n\n14\n\n| Part I\n\nNotes\n\n1 Malcolm Spector and John I. Kitsuse, Constructing Social Problems (New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 2001). 2 Ruud Koopmans, Contested Citizenship: Immigration and Cultural Diversity in Europe (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 2005), 24.\n\n1\n\nBarefoot Feminist Classes A Revelation of Being, Doing, and Becoming Rula Quawas\n\nGraduate and undergraduate students who sign up for feminist theory and literature modules in the English Department at the University of Jordan engage in an exercise of unlearning and re-visioning beyond the patriarchal perspective through which Arab women have been trained to see the world. They not only wrestle with difficult and dense texts that deal with the history of feminism and theories of gender that create emotion, tension, and conflict, but they also come to engage with, and analyze, the Arab culture in which they live outside the classroom. Through a feminist lens, they rigorously and seriously engage with issues that directly affect them, and, through debate and argument, they sharpen their opinions and address tangential questions that affect the very core of their beingness, doingness, and becomingness. My twenty years of teaching literature and feminist theory at the University of Jordan, and my activism in movements on women’s rights, on social justice, and on cultural and social transformation in Jordan, have taught me that Arab women believe education to be their weapon. They believe that transformative education is substantively good for them, and evidence shows that they are right. An educated woman has what it takes to live and lead an informed and empowered life and to seek employment and be financially independent. Even though her education does not solve all her problems and, at times, fails to eliminate her subordination to man, it enhances and builds her capacities and creativities. Admittedly, feminist discourse is not part of my thinking; rather, it is my thinking, connecting me to my students and to the global world. As we know, feminist thinking and practice emphasize a vision wherein 15\n\n16\n\n| Rula Quawas\n\nFigure 1.1. Rula Quawas in 2016 at the University of Jordan\n\neveryone’s needs are respected, everyone has rights, and no one needs to fear subordination or abuse. This vision runs counter to the male domination most of us have experienced or will experience in our lives. During the fall semester of 2011, I taught a feminist theory class in which my students produced a video addressing the sexual harassment experienced by female students on campus and uploaded it to YouTube in June 2012. The video, which is revolutionary and heterodox in more than one way, created a controversy storm not only in Jordan but also all over the world. Little did I know that months later, I would be relieved of my post as dean of the faculty of foreign languages and that I and my students would be demonized and deprecated.1 In the spirit of feminist discourse, I would like to share this saga poem, a narratological testimonial, which reflects the intellectual development and nourishment of my students, who come to harvest feminist knowledge, to challenge commonly held views about Muslim women as passive objects of patriarchal structures, and to midwife active speech. Their vivid voices are incorporated within the poem I have crafted to show their ontological desire to be, do, and become. This is their Arab Spring, or better still, their Arab Renaissance. The students emerge as active agents in their own learning, and they develop an authentic voice that bears witness to their lives and minds. As independent subjects, they rip into feminist texts and speak in their own active voices with certainty, becoming midwife learners, delivering their own ideas to the\n\nBarefoot Feminist Classes\n\n|\n\n17\n\nworld, and engaging in conversations with other voices—past and present—in the culture. Through dialogue, they cross barriers and bridge private and shared experience. They not only rise; they go beyond.\n\nTestimonial Poem: The Democracy of the Human Spirit I speak I was born into an ancient sarcophagus, but when I looked closer, the sarcophagus was made of glass, and I could break it if I wished. Inside I was an instar, waiting to become an imagine. Inscribed on the walls of my tomb, expectations and dreams. Staring in from outside my tomb—a multitude of eyes. It is all a mosaic, constructed on a foundation of polyphonic voices. In the orange-scented soiled familial depths, I send down my roots to seek the knowledge of my ancestors, absorbing my inheritance, my right to grow up, to expand, ascend, simply to stand. Branching, my tendrils extend, seeking cracks in the walls of the glass womb. Finding air, sunlight, water. I give a little push, the crack becomes a chasm. I am imagined.\n\nStudents Speak Oh! Name is guttering, choking, drowning . . . Raw dirt catching strong ribs. Tears of shame and fear in splintered eyes.\n\n18\n\n| Rula Quawas\n\nA mask of sorrow that bitterly hides shrouds of darkness, webs of silence, nets of failure. Alone, afraid as a sinner of exile. A vortex of confusion in my veins, a mesh of seaweed in my being, a giant ripping hole in my canvas, intolerable pain hidden in my veil, patiently hiding in his shadows. Tired, yet eager for sunlight, violently shaking my head, asking What should I do? Who should I be? Self-perception distorted by bent power. The burden of dutiful obligations, An uncomfortable journey stunted by restriction. This tangled and gruesome coexistence—wasted potential. An ebbing fire tied up in copper, inner knots reaching my very fiber. The torch of conformity painlessly cuts through glory. Paper bearing paper in the posture of departure. The light at the end of a furnace, not a tunnel. I’m a stranger, displaced, and tired of everything. I’m nothing, Absolutely nothing. No I, me, myself. Nada, a cipher, nonexistent. Why couldn’t I have been a boy? A female . . . What is my sin? My crime? A piece of luggage, Numb, Hollow, Shriveled.\n\nBarefoot Feminist Classes\n\nWho will solve my problems? Who will put an end to my fractured dreams, to my excruciating pain, to my slow suicide, living death. What will become of me?\n\nThe Awakening Something snaps. Something sheds. Something surfaces. Are you mad, woman? I laugh and laugh loudly. I am stronger than sin. I know my defiant soul. I am here, self-present and beautiful. I exist. I will live. How well I breathe now! Mabrouk, pure one. I am an Arab woman. Ana Imra’ah Arabiya I own my identity, My virginity, My voice, My self. I am no longer a tenant of my body. I am no longer enthralled in snares of silences. I am ME, birthing a new life into my soul, catalyzing change, and becoming an agent of change. I am ready to sail, to brave the horizon and go beyond.\n\n|\n\n19\n\n20\n\n| Rula Quawas\n\nI am an Arab woman. Ana imra’ah Arabiya\n\nThe Revelation A journey of truth telling, of voyaging in and diving within my nooks and crannies, my ifs and buts, my doubts and certainties, discovering my innermost self, unearthing a real self, branded and labeled, dominated and misrepresented, subjugated and objectified, negated, even canceled, by societal restrictions, forged by a culture of ‘eib and haram. For the first time in forever, I am okay. My feelings are okay. My thoughts are okay. My life choices are okay. I use myself, let nothing and no one use me. I am not alone. Other women are with me in feminist courses, awakening to our newfound selves, infused with feminist knowledge and with feminist consciousness, birthing ourselves anew and afresh, rehumanizing ourselves, putting ourselves into the text, into the world,\n\nBarefoot Feminist Classes\n\ninto history, embracing our solidarity and singing our songs of freedom. Unbuttoning our hearts, which throb and beat with internalized misogyny. Unlocking our muted voices, and speaking back to the patriarchy. Our language is not phallocentric, shaped by socialization. Our language is our verbal weapon through which we unlearn our mindsets, shaped by the male stream. We become resistant readers, refusing to be immasculated.2 We think, choose, and act. We herald a new age of change, and move on, onward and forward. I now call myself a woman. A victor, rather than a victim. I am no longer encapsulated in the image of the Angel of the House. No longer hiding behind Anon, as Virginia Woolf has once said. No longer confined in a doll’s house, or trapped behind aged yellow wallpapers, or locked up in attic rooms, labeled mad and bad. I am free, body and soul. Unveiling, unmasking, and unraveling leaves of imposed cultural scripts and religious myths about the inferiority of women. Now, I love me, A Promothea, with a handful of words telling my story, in gynocentric language,\n\n|\n\n21\n\n22\n\n| Rula Quawas\n\nin white ink. Living my telling life, one day at a time, and sharing it with my daughters and also with my sons. I have had enough. My duty is to honor myself. Owning and honoring it. I am not an appendage, Bint flan, always referenced and cross-referenced: The daughter of my father, the wife of my husband, and the mother of my son. I am not a blank page to be written upon. I am a creator of art and of life. Bent on unlearning what it means to be a tenant in my very body, undoing and rewriting patriarchal precepts, shedding socially assumed fictitious garments, ready-made cultural scripts, written about and for me in dark ink thick and morose, ink committing deadly sins against me, the me-myself, and my humanity. I speak passion to my voice, which has been buried under layers and layers of Dos and Don’ts, dictates of my Arab society, of my family, and of myself, lampooning my existence and life. I speak my truth, speaking it to power.\n\nBarefoot Feminist Classes\n\n|\n\n23\n\nI own my space, a room of my own, and furnish it, too, with confidence, strength, and hope, with education, ambitions, and aspirations; A niche which fits me, all of me, all of my contradictions and ambivalences, all of my scars and wrinkles, all of my positionalities and standpoints, all of my pain and anguish, all of my modalities of enunciations, all of me, Regardless. I have made peace with my new reality. Gaping holes have made me whole again. It is a new beginning of enlightenment and self-exploration. Feminist knowledge transforms me.

I’m no longer a passive entity which lives to give birth as a machine. no longer caught in a deadly either/or. I am not an “other” His other, to be propertized, marginalized, or ridiculed. I have broken through many barriers, changed the landscape of the conversation and reclaimed my voice and my life. I have studied feminist literature. Too long. Long Enough.

Stories that have served me well, and many, many more. I no longer see people. I read their faces, which are no object masks, and each face has a wonderful story to tell. I know how to be woman-oriented and how to abound in everything and in all things. I have learned how to be fulfilled rather than filled. I can do all things through Me, Me, who strengthens me, A stronghold in lived experiences. I name myself, and I own it, too. I am an Arab woman, Ana Imra’ah Arabiya, realizing the potentials I sense for myself as a woman, through an act of re-vision, re-calling, re-membering, and re-claiming, I give voice to my deepest fears and hopes, through unleashing my spirit upon the world, infusing my entire life with renewed synergy, with meaning, with self-worth, with love, with purpose, with abundance, and full of things that have never been.

I am enough. Enough I Am.\n\nReflections This saga poem is a string of vignettes that are designed not so much to supply solutions as to provide insight into the social challenges that Jordanian students experience, and to offer ways of addressing them that are open to discussion, rejection, acceptance, and/or revision. The students’ feelings, thinking, and action provide grounding for my poems, and their experiences nurture the value of a feminist discourse, which aims to promote and support women’s voices and agency. A feminist classroom is open, safe, and liberating in terms of students speaking up and teachers encouraging debate. Within this site of resistance and contestation, students find their voices and take ownership of their feminist education, question what they are taught and how it is relevant to them, dialogue about sensitive topic areas in feminism, such as sexism, politics, and identity issues, and engage in actions that change personal and political realities. The majority of students come to feminist theory classes with little knowledge about the subject, and sometimes they come with preconceptions about feminism that make them apprehensive about their decision to enroll. Throughout their feminist education, they discover, many for the first time, the rich details of women’s lives and experiences and learn to make sense of this knowledge. They say again and again, “This course is nothing like we thought it would be; it is so much better.” Indeed, it is. Feminism, which pushes against and beyond boundaries, is a fight not only for the benefit of all women but for the benefit of all beings. As a professor of literature and feminist theory, I have always glimpsed the possibility of a world that could be much more for Arab women. When I teach, I always ask myself, What is it that I can do within the domain of my classrooms to make this world a living reality? What kind of future do I want to create with my students? The last twenty years have\n\nBarefoot Feminist Classes\n\n| 27\n\nbeen fiercely intense on the issue of teaching feminist theory classes to graduate and undergraduate students. Intense such teaching is, but it is also liberating, democratizing, and empowering for me and for my students. Together, we become part of a teaching-learning process in which we create the opportunity to dare or to brave into unconventional forms of doing research and giving voice to women who have been marginalized and, at times, ridiculed. Together, we live our lives forward.

She explains that women are taught to think as men and to identify with their points of views. In itself, this is misogyny (xx).\n\nBibliography\n\nFetterley, Judith. The Resisting Reader: A Feminist Approach to American Fiction. Bloomington: Indiana University Press, 1978.\n\n2\n\nThe Labor Strikes That Catalyzed the Revolution in Egypt Nadine Naber\n\nTwo kinds of stories have been consolidated as predominant representations of women’s activism within the Egyptian revolution in both dominant US and Egyptian corporate media discourses: (1) stories about how Egyptian women activists rose up to fight sexual harassment; and (2) stories about how Egyptian women mobilized en masse only to be pushed out of political participation afterwards (Naber and Said 2016). Mona Ezzat, labor organizer and human rights activist, points out that both cases reify the Western fixation on Egyptian women as if there is no broader context or political struggle (beyond “sexism”) shaping their activism. All too often, she notes, it was as if outside commentators were exclaiming, “‘Wow, the women of Egypt!’ without any discussion of why they came to protest. We need a true understanding of the reality of women’s lives and what brought them out to the street en masse. . . . I’m stunned by this fixation” (Ezzat 2013). Ezzat’s critique reflects the limitations of the liberal feminist lens that shapes dominant US and Egyptian discourses about Egyptian women’s activism, as though their activism is simply a response to sexism. These discourses have assumed that women activists and protesters rose up to fight either against sexual violence enacted by Egyptian men or for equal political participation in official and unofficial politics. Meanwhile, these dominant stories relegate to the background the demands of the revolution for which women risked their lives—bread, dignity, and social justice—and the structural violence inflicted upon Egyptian women by neoliberalism, militarism, corruption, and authoritarianism, out of which these demands emerged. In this chapter, I focus on the six-year period preceding the official revolution of 2011, when Egypt witnessed a series of workers’ strikes wherein women were central actors. As Egyptian feminists have been 28\n\nThe Labor Strikes That Catalyzed the Revolution in Egypt\n\n|\n\n29\n\ndoing all along, this chapter contributes to efforts committed to providing alternatives to both the liberal feminist (singular gender-based) and masculinist “unite and fight” (singular class-based) narratives by mapping the gendered socioeconomic conditions and grievances that inspired the participation of many women in the political actions that catalyzed the revolution. This chapter shows that women workers’ struggles over class oppression and authoritarianism were co-constituted with struggles over gender injustice and that even when women protesters or strikers did not assert an explicitly “feminist” agenda, gender injustice and gender demands persisted. Of course, women workers’ activism emerges out of the broader conditions in Egypt related to class and gender oppression, including the interrelated structures of authoritarianism, neoliberal economics, militarism, and the US’s imperial alliance with Egypt, as Paul Amar (2011) and El Said, Meari, and Pratt (2015) have shown. This chapter recognizes that, given the complex ways in which multiple oppressions have structured the lives of women workers, women involved in either the strikes of 2005–2008 or the revolution of 2011 may not have accorded all oppressions the same saliency in their activism all the time. It simultaneously acknowledges the potential dangers of attaching lesser value to different valences of oppressions (such as sexism) at different points in time. I am interested in what we can gain from reflecting back on the implicit structures of gender oppression that haunted the workers’ strikes of 2005–2008, especially as they relate to dominant demands of the Egyptian labor movement, the Egyptian revolution, and the future Egypt revolutionaries have been fighting for.1 This study is based upon ethnographic, collaborative, and participatory research I conducted in 2012, 2013, and 2016 with twenty Egyptian women activists who participated in the revolution, have dedicated their lives to struggles for gender justice, and worked together in the coalition of revolutionary feminist organizations that formed in February 2011. Here, I focus on conversations with Mona Ezzat, a labor organizer and director of the Women and Labor Program at the New Women Foundation. Ezzat has been at the forefront of activism and research related to women workers, women’s economic and social rights, and the right to organize for Egyptian women.\n\n30\n\n| Nadine Naber\n\nThe Conditions of Twenty-first-century Egypt At the turn of the twenty-first century, social movements against the interconnected forces of neoliberalism, authoritarianism, and imperialism peaked in Egypt. Spring 2005 was a key moment in this history when activists mobilized against a referendum on constitutional reform that made it impossible for candidates to run for the presidential election unless Mubarak’s governing party (the National Democratic Party—NDP) permitted them to do so. Government supporters and security forces targeted women protesters, attacking their bodies and chasing them through the streets. The story of journalist Nawal Ali, attacked and nearly stripped by NDP, made international headlines— yet no one was held accountable despite protests (Slackman 2010). Such events have increasingly directed the attention of Egyptian antiauthoritarian/pro-democracy movements to the state’s use of systematic gender violence. On the ground, grassroots initiatives that combine principles of both gender justice and anti-authoritarianism continued to develop (Amar 2011). During this period, women workers stood at the forefront of a series of mobilizations leading up to the revolution of 2011 (el-Hamalawy 2008). Workers’ strikes between 2006 and 2011 catalyzed the official revolution of 2011 (generally understood as the eighteen days prior to the ousting of Hosni Mubarak), and women were heavily active in these strikes (El-Mahdi and Marfleet 2009; Slackman 2010). Ezzat contends that the conditions inspiring women’s participation in the labor strikes of the early twenty-first century developed over the preceding thirty years: Egyptians have suffered from economic policies whose feature was to showcase the Egyptian market on the grounds that it had cheap labor. We witnessed the acceleration of the pace of privatization, leading to the sale of a number of factories at low prices. Government policies supported deals to sell companies and factories for profit and labor laws disadvantaged workers. These forces inspired a workers’ movement, including many women. It escalated because these economic policies led to an increase in impoverishment, driving large segments of women into the labor market. The industrial sector absorbed many women workers—in spinning, weaving, pharmaceuticals, the food and electronics industries,\n\nThe Labor Strikes That Catalyzed the Revolution in Egypt\n\n|\n\n31\n\namong others. These are the same factories whose workers opposed privatization and saw financial and administrative corruption. Numerous protests emerged, with women in large numbers. (Ezzat 2013)\n\nBy 2004, as the outcome of years of mounting frustration and struggles with bureaucracy and financial and administrative corruption in the public and private sectors, a wide movement of workers from different sectors was consolidated in Egypt. Women workers, heavily impacted by the policies Ezzat describes, were active in the major strikes of this period, as well as specific protests. They were especially active organizing within women-dominated sectors, such as nursing or education, or even the information sector, where they walked door to door collecting information and census data. She explains, Women and men joined protests because they were struggling with the same problems. Although the media and society were surprised women were participating in protests, their participation was a natural action. They were motivated by financial need and wanted to secure their families. They were under threat of being fired because their companies were being sold to privatization or because of corruption so women protested like men to defend their jobs and their workplace and this is a continuation of the long fight of women in the labor movement since the forties. Women were supporters and organizers. They prepared and participated in the negotiation process with the government. (Ezzat 2013)\n\nThese realities inspired mobilizations that came to be celebrated worldwide, such as those within Mahalla Spinning and Weaving textile mill in 2006, the largest industrial strike between 2004 and 2010. Mahalla Spinning and Weaving is one of the largest textile mills in the Middle East, with a labor force of twenty-seven thousand. In 2006, after a series of injustices, the company refused to grant workers a bonus the prime minister had promised to them. Egyptian police cracked down on workers who went on strike. This synopsis, composed from various interviews, represents the dominant narrative that circulated among activists in Egypt and internationally about the strike of December 7, 2006: Three thousand women garment workers left their posts. In some instances, women inspired men to join the strike. Production slowed\n\n32\n\n| Nadine Naber\n\nalmost to a halt. Workers rejected a twenty-one-day pay bonus from the factory management. The strike continued for two more days, reaching a total of all twenty-seven thousand workers present. On the fourth day, government officials offered a new compromise and promised a twentyone-day bonus in addition to LE89 (equivalent to five US dollars) for each worker, one month worth of bonuses, and a half salary for January. Many Egyptian and international activists have recognized women like labor activist Wedad Al-Damrdash. In a 2013 interview, Egyptian labor organizer (coordinator of labor communications at the Egyptian Center for Economic and Social Rights and member of the Popular Alliance Party) Dalia Moussa told me, “One of the most prominent activists in Egypt’s labor movement is Wedad from Mahalla Spinning and Weaving. . . . She mobilized co-workers who feared that taking action would land them in jail.” The Washington Post also covered Wedad’s activism: “Wedad led women out of the building onto the mill grounds when the strike was supposed to begin but most men had not joined them” (Sly 2011). In Egypt and internationally, dominant narratives recognized women’s labor activism not only in Mahalla, but in Asfoor, in Alexandria, and across Egypt. While these stories identify women labor activists as “heroes” of class struggle, they obscure the gender injustices that shaped their labor activism. Stories of the Mahalla women fail to address the struggles of sexual harassment that women workers faced as they participated in public space. In an interview, Ezzat told me, “Like Mahalla, international stories have also narrated the well-known sit-in against Mansoura-Spanish Company through the story of a woman named Maryam—who played a key role inside the factory—or with references to the numerous women workers who participated in the sit-in. Mansoura-Spanish Company is in the Nile Delta province of Daqahliya, where women make up 75 percent of the labor force” (Ezzat 2013). The tax collectors’ strikes of 2007 (the largest collective of actions of the 2000s, involving fifty-five thousand real estate tax collectors employed by local authorities) have been remembered similarly (Beinin 2011). For three months, the property tax collectors went on strike to demand improvement in their working conditions. In progressive Egyptian and international discourse, the story of the tax collectors’ strike tends to appear as follows:\n\nThe Labor Strikes That Catalyzed the Revolution in Egypt\n\n| 33\n\nThe strike culminated in an 11-day sit-in when 8,000 tax collectors, including many women, camped out together with their children. They slept in front of the Ministers’ Council building and won a 325 percent wage increase. This laid the groundwork for Egypt’s first independent trade union. Women labor activists convinced their husbands they had to leave their families, fight the battle and sleep in the street even if they knew they would be beaten and arrested there. Even if their husbands did not agree, they were determined and they would go. They knew they had to go because they were getting paid 90 pounds a month and believed it was not a choice—even though they were negotiating with families to go and still had to stay on top of their housework, child-care, and so on but they were not making enough to stay alive. (el-Hamalawy 2008)\n\nFatma told me that Egyptian labor organizers collectively acknowledge the crucial contributions of women workers who participated in the tax collectors’ strike (2013). She told me, for example, that they refer to Aisha Abu Sammad as “the amazing trade unionist”; that they acknowledge the contributions of Mervat, who, “with the land improvement workers was sleeping in the street in front of the Parliament building for many days in 2010 and standing chanting to encourage and lead her colleagues”; and that they referred to a woman from the rural Beheira area as one of “those who left her children and husband at the peak of the struggle!” (2013). Leftists and labor organizers have affirmed that women formed an important component of the matrix of forces propelling the mobilization that toppled President Hosni Mubarak in February of 2011. But feminist labor organizers like Ezzat have been insisting upon a gender analysis of women’s labor and labor activism: While women and men are struggling shoulder to shoulder, they do not have the same power in decision making. It is not only the factories, corporations, or government that are oppressing women (and men), but it is also workers (men), the unions (led by men), and the structures of family, community, and society that shape women workers’ lives and work. While women participated with men, shouldn’t that make her also a partner in the decision making? Here you will find them say, well, it is because her role is with the family. She is his partner as long as she is pro-\n\n34\n\n| Nadine Naber\n\ntesting and striking. They do not deny the role of the women but who will come and work with her on the issues of day care or sexual harassment or equal wages? We have a large gap in wages, up to 27 percent advantage to men! (2013).\n\nEzzat is referring to conditions whereby 20.2 percent of women participate in (formal) economic activities compared to 79.8 percent of men; and a gap in salaries between women and men continues to grow, despite the ways women and men came together within joint labor struggles. Official government data reveals that men workers make 13.8 percent more than women, and that women are relegated to jobs that align with patriarchal assumptions equating womanhood with mothering and home-making, including a concentration of women in the fields of education, health, and social work. Some sectors employ a particularly high number of women, such as nursing, where women workers live in what Ezzat calls “slave like conditions,” including extremely low pay, discrimination in salaries, sexual harassment, an unsafe work environment, constant punishment at work such as pay deductions, long hours without overtime pay, and a lack of childcare and other crucial services (2013). By assuming that the kinds of jobs where women work in larger numbers are “women’s jobs” and therefore less important, patriarchal assumptions help to sustain the disproportionately low salaries women receive. Women are virtually nonexistent in trades such as mining and construction, and the percentage of men in managerial roles is double that of women (68.8 percent for men and 31.2 percent for women). Generally, more men occupy higher-level jobs compared to women (Ezzat 2012), and a gap in salaries exists between men and women workers for conducting the same work despite similar levels of education and experience (Shaaban 2014). Even though women workers were not articulating gender-specific demands in their labor activism of this period and women and men workers share similar struggles, their life conditions (which inspired their actions) cannot be reduced to class struggle alone. Gender injustices such as the interconnected forces of (1) patriarchal family structures, (2) patriarchal structures at work, and (3) sexualized harassment permeate women workers’ lives.\n\nThe Labor Strikes That Catalyzed the Revolution in Egypt\n\n|\n\n35\n\nWhile the percentage of women working in Egypt is high, dominant family structures have marginalized the women who were involved in the major strikes of 2005–2008 in the area of decision making at home. Women workers are primarily responsible for housework in addition to their paid work. New Women Foundation is currently developing a program (started in 2010 and continuing) about the power imbalances that emerge in such contexts, calculating and balancing the time for unpaid work and protecting women working in the unofficial work sector. Women’s problems as workers—from inequality in pay to the need for childcare at work—are not taken seriously, given the dominant assumption that women are primarily mothers. In other words, a patriarchal logic constructs the normative worker as a man (and women as mothers) and therefore excludes women from crucial decision making within labor activism. According to Ezzat, “When I talked to the men about women’s participation in a union vote they say we cannot give women a vote as a member because she is home and cannot make a union meeting at night. And they act like they are being considerate to their woman comrades” (2013). Yet while the gendered components of class struggle tended to be left out of the strikers’ demands, the gendered components of class struggle were primarily responsible for a dynamic in which women’s massive participation in these mobilizations often remained invisible and unrecognized. In a 2013 interview, labor organizer Fatma Ramadan (executive board member of the Egyptian Federation of Independent Trade Unions and member of the Socialist Popular Alliance Party) told me, “Even though they are working, they are also primarily responsible for household care and childrearing. They work so many hours and then leave to do housework and deal with family commitments.” Ezzat similarly explained, Because workplaces don’t abide by the law and don’t provide nurseries, the woman is still the one who wakes up on her own at five or six in the morning to see that her child is taken to the nursery or to her mother or neighbor. Then she turns around to go to work. Then she picks up her child and stays up all night doing housework. She is discriminated against based on the type of work she does and on the basis of gender and she often doesn’t know that the law guarantees her the right to child leave,\n\n36\n\n| Nadine Naber\n\nmaternity leave, nurseries, time for breastfeeding, and that she should receive equal wages. Also, even under poor working conditions and with unfair work requirements, depressed wages and [an] unstable labor market, and not having qualifications for decent work—women’s work does not improve a woman’s situation within her family, nor her rights within her extended family (2013).\n\nBecause the combined effects of class and gender co-constitute women workers’ life conditions, men workers are more visible, because they do not have to leave strikes to return home to do housework or childrearing. An exclusive lens of class struggle limits our analyses of women’s life conditions by ignoring the co-constitution of multiple oppressions that women workers in Egypt face and privileges the realities of men workers. An exclusive lens of class struggle also obscures the conditions that have prevented women from being as visible as men. Alternatively, the predominant feminist frameworks that center upon the struggles of middle-class women fail to account for the deeply intertwined conditions of gender and class oppression and do not account for the struggles of women workers. An analysis of the gendered and sexualized underpinnings of authoritarianism and neoliberal economics that give rise to sexualized violence in Egypt is beyond the scope of my analysis. (See Amar 2011 for more information.) However, it is well established that sexualized violence in the workplace is an outgrowth of dominant ideals that equate women with motherhood and gendered conditions in the workplace. For instance, since many women workers lack stable contracts, they can be easily reprimanded or fired for reporting sexual harassment. Ezzat explains, Because women were in the financial districts and were working without contracts, it made it very easy to fire them or face harassment from their boss or coworker. She cannot prove this and it leads to attacks against her. She is forced to remain quiet or she does not know the law and procedures she can take. This is tied to the lack of policies that would protect women at work and make them feel safe to report harassment. Sexual harassment also happens inside the government sector. But even among leftists, there is talk about government-led violence but not about the vio-\n\nThe Labor Strikes That Catalyzed the Revolution in Egypt\n\n|\n\n37\n\nlence committed by the worker against the worker or the violence that comes out of living in poverty.\n\nIn 2013, Ezzat told me about recent efforts to establish independent unions related to gender equality in the workplace; the successful formation of childcare in particular factories; and how women’s participation has increased in unions, the workplace, and political parties.2 She explained how these efforts are taking place within a larger environment where government officials constantly refer to the role of women in economic growth projects but fail to establish policies, laws, or projects that support the distinct struggles of women workers. Discussing future visions, she said, What would truly shake up [authoritarianism] would be the arrival of a broad social movement made up of all the marginalized sectors of society, among the workers and the farmers, men and women, so we can build a foundation in the heart of these villages, that could truly shake up the voting blocs. I see the coming battle as a battle of economic rights and social rights, a battle for people’s livelihoods, a battle for all people’s wages, because we need to bring in the people who, because of the political reality, are absent. If we could draw them in on the grounds of their economic and social rights, we would be doing something very important. At the center of this are the issues of women because of the questions of justice, equality, citizenship. You can’t just talk about them and exclude the rights and issues of women within them.\n\nConclusion Ezzat’s words capture the multidimensionality of Egyptian women workers’ realities. Classism and authoritarianism are gendered, and their struggles cannot be reduced to either the struggles of women or the struggles of workers. Orientalist and liberal feminist paradigms, which single out women’s activism in the Arab region only when it can be explained as a response to “cultural” or “religious” forms of oppression and masculinist paradigms that conceptualize the normative worker or activist as a man, do little to further women workers’ struggles for social justice. But given the complex ways in which gender, class,\n\n38\n\n| Nadine Naber\n\nauthoritarianism, and neoliberal economics co-constitute one another, the dominant voices of the workers’ strikes of 2006–2008, like the eighteen days of the revolution of 2011, did not accord all oppressions the same saliency all the time. There is no magic formula for how much gender analysis is enough in a given context, but we must remain attentive to questions of power, history, and context. The extent to which women activists might hold each axis of power—of race, of class, of gender, and of sexuality—in view will vary depending on who we are talking about, what they are doing at the time, what the historical and political context is, what is at stake, and who their audience is. What is important is that we do not flatten our analyses of gender and/or class or make universal proclamations about either. We need flexible analyses that will vary their focus, just as different valences of power become more or less salient at different points in time. At the same time, there is a danger in ending the analysis of the saliency of oppressions here—especially since the socially inscribed gendering of women’s bodies becomes more salient than ever in moments of intense violence. The point is not that priorities do not have to be selected or that postponing certain issues and agendas is not sometimes necessary and important—yet it is urgent that we carefully consider how these decisions get made, what kinds of criteria are used, and what their implications are for truly inclusive social movements and meanings of freedom.

With a PhD from the United States, Alawadhi was a political philosophy professor at Kuwait University who taught critical thinking. The scandal, referred to as “Fadihat Aseel Alawadhi,” was based on amalgamated clips from her lectures to female students in which she appeared to argue that a well-known interpretation of the Quranic verse on the veil was applicable to the Prophet’s wives rather than to all women. Six days before the elections, Aseel gave the following interview to journalist Bushra Al-Zain.1\n\nWhy was the YouTube accusation held against you and what’s your reaction? Election campaigns rarely happen without rumors. Many result from misunderstandings and misinterpretations, but the YouTube campaign was an organized and deliberate rumor leveled against me. This premeditated action violated the university rules and used three different segments from my lectures to frame me as urging students to drop the veil. In my lectures, I try to compel students to think about a range of views on a particular subject and consider contexts that give rise to one particular view over others. I propose ideas to my classes to stimulate their thinking. I take certain phenomena and apply them to a concept to stimulate a friendly and fun discussion. I think that overall these accusations are immoral, stemming from a misunderstanding of the 40\n\nFrom a Smear Campaign to the Kuwaiti Parliament\n\n|\n\n41\n\ndemocratic process. We are not in a state of war in which our ethical standards are being abandoned. As one community, of brothers and sisters, we agree and disagree. I was very dismayed by this smear campaign. The focus of the election should be on my competence to reach Parliament, not my lectures. We have many more urgent issues impacting our nation and its citizens that must be prioritized. Citizens who embrace reform expect me to defend their issues as their representative, and they care less about my attitude towards the hijab. With these altercations, we, as politicians, send the wrong message to our citizens indicating that we are removed from their concerns and are only interested in battling each other. Efforts put into the YouTube video would have been better spent being directed towards finding solutions for the difficulties facing Kuwaitis’ everyday life. This type of political action, which is beneath us, explains the poor services from which people suffer nationwide.\n\nAre you leading students to abandon Kuwaiti society’s conservative principles? As much as anyone else, I am embedded in my conservative family and society. Yet, as a philosophy professor, I believe teaching critical thinking is fundamental at every educational level. Kuwait needs people to think critically in order to contribute to our national development. Learning is not merely regurgitating what’s known, but rather questioning and examining knowledge in a critical manner, and understanding the reasoning and evidence that support each viewpoint. During Kuwait’s Golden Era, we had freedom of thought and were an enlightened culture—two elements that go hand in hand to achieve development. We have since had waves of governance that impose restrictive ideologies, repress others, paralyze civil society and the Parliament, and produce a generation that is unreceptive to others’ views. Because we have become a fertile ground for fanaticism, our social progress has been halted. This is why I try to push students in critical thinking courses to use their minds, to justify their opinions with logical reasoning, and to refrain from attacking each other. In these discussions, numbers and research are essential. Teaching students in this way does not challenge traditions and customs but serves them. Repressing freedom of expression is the\n\n42\n\n| Aseel Alawadhi\n\nreal challenge to our society whereas the solution lies in strengthening our critical thinking skills.\n\nWere you victimized because of your education? I began my college education in architecture but later chose philosophy in order to answer the many questions I have had since childhood. In my academic experience, I was surprised to see students interested in gossip more than logic, and allegations over facts. My specialization in philosophy refined my character and taught me wisdom. My silence during the negative campaigns was the result of self-discipline and logical thinking. I truly believe that in disagreements there is progress and I am now more tolerant and accepting of others’ views.\n\nAre you “Americanized,” as they accuse you? Anyone in Kuwait who offers different ideas is labeled “Americanized.” I do not imitate other cultures or people. I choose what works for me and discard what does not, according to my convictions, which I form according to logical reasoning. In my lectures, I purposely speak positively about the West because I want my students to learn about this world’s progress. Embracing other cultures does not mean that I reject our great heritage. But we need to be realistic. In previous eras, our civilizations were more progressive. Specifically, we had freedom of thought that was fostered and knowledge was shared, translated, and produced. However, we have fallen behind in science, technology, weaponry, education, and human rights. Acknowledging this does not mean that we underestimate ourselves. But we must be honest about our own reality and willing to change it—this is why they say I’m “Americanized.”\n\nIs your hope to enter Parliament broken by these rumors? Women have been absent from political life in Kuwait for a long period. Now, we have a legacy of this exclusively male practice and I refuse to accept women’s continuous absence. Since the beginning of the election, I have encountered several rumors and ignored them. Some use the fact that I am not veiled as a basis for accusing me of being against\n\nFrom a Smear Campaign to the Kuwaiti Parliament\n\n| 43\n\nIslam and the hijab. These accusations aim to dissuade my religious supporters from voting for me. Others use my education in the United States to dissuade educated and open-minded Kuwaitis by appealing to their position against American dominance over Arab countries. In my doctoral thesis, I criticized American interference in the region, especially in regards to governance. Others refuse to allow women into the Parliament and attempt to undermine the role of women in politics in general. And of course, there are some Parliament members who fear losing their seat to someone who is more qualified than they; therefore, having a PhD could be perceived as a threat to them. My priorities are clear towards Kuwaiti voters. My first and most important concern is being a voice for Kuwaiti citizens in the halls of Parliament. Note\n\n1 A 2009 interview with Al-Anbaa Kuwaiti newspaper.\n\n4\n\nPalestinian Queerness and the Orientalist Paradigm Amal Amireh\n\nThe intersectionality between queer studies on the one hand and the (neo-)orientalist vis-à-vis postcolonial studies on the other frames the debate about queer issues in the Middle East in two paradigms: universal and local. The first understands queer Middle Eastern identities as an expression of a universal gay identity that is progressing toward full expression, with the West as its model; the second understands them as products of local cultures and histories, which sets them apart from Western expressions of gayness. While these paradigms have been used to study queerness in other non-Western societies, they have been particularly crippling when applied to the Middle East. They inevitably have become enmeshed with the (neo-)orientalist and colonialist discourses that still dominate discussions of Arab and Muslim sexualities and, to a lesser extent, with the anticolonial discourses that resist them. Focusing on queer issues as they relate to Palestine/Israel, we must be well aware of the colonialist context within which the discourse about sexuality is deployed. As Gil Hochberg states, we must “situate questions regarding LGBTQ rights, homophobia, and sexual policing, in direct relation to questions concerning the ethnonational and colonial politics that currently define the relationship between Israel and its occupied Palestinian population” (2010, 495). Indeed, “discussions of queerness (and sexual politics more extensively) are essential for our understanding of national movements, colonial oppression, new technologies of state surveillance, and new modes of racial/ethnic/religious segregation” (Hochberg 2010, 495). In fact, queer sexualities, as both discourses and practices, are entangled, in the context of the Palestine-Israel conflict, with colonialism and nationalism in fundamental and complex ways that cannot be ignored. The rest of this essay elaborates on some of these entanglements. 44\n\nPalestinian Queerness and the Orientalist Paradigm\n\n|\n\n45\n\nPalestinian Queers: Now You See Them, Now You Don’t . . . The visibility of Palestinian queers in Israeli discourse is determined by Israel’s colonial project, the core of which is the denial of Palestinian national rights. In Israeli discourse and consciousness, Palestinian queers occupy two extreme locations: either they are hypervisible or they are invisible. In both cases, it is their Palestinianness, not their queerness, that determines whether and how they are seen, as illustrated in the two examples below. In 2004, the Zionist Organization of America helped the Georgetown Israeli Alliance bring a Palestinian man to speak at the Georgetown campus. Hiding behind a wig, sunglasses, and a fake mustache, “Ali” claimed he was a gay Palestinian and spoke about the difficulties that he faced as a gay man in Palestinian society. But that was only part of his mission. He went on to sing the praises of the Israeli state as a haven for gay rights and to elaborate, as a good native informant, on the cultural differences between the repressive Palestinians and the liberal Israelis regarding homosexuality (Tehranian 2004). Ali’s performance should be seen as one more in a long line of staged performances, where “others” are exhibited to propagandize for a colonial, racist agenda. Coming at the height of the Israeli repression of the Al Aqsa Intifada, Ali’s cultural performance had one purpose only, which was to discredit the Palestinian people and their culture at a time when they were under assault by the Israeli military machine. However, this hypervisibility turns into invisibility when another Palestinian queer demands to speak. As Hochberg shows (2010a, 2010b), during the Tel Aviv demonstration to protest the homophobic killing of two young gay Israelis, Palestinians were denied the right to speak. Both the former Knesset member Issam Makhoul and a representative of Aswat, a lesbian Palestinian organization, were not allowed to address the crowd on their own terms. According to some reports, the organizers felt that “they could not go so far,” and as a result, on that day, no Palestinians were visible on the national stage (Nisreen and Dayna 2009). Those queer Palestinians demanding to speak were not the gay Palestinians the Israeli establishment likes to parade around. They do not present themselves as victims of Palestinian culture but as activists\n\n46 | Amal Amireh\n\narticulating a queer political agenda that is, simultaneously, anticolonial, antiracist, and antihomophobic. Alisa Solomon (2010, 153) charts the altered value of queerness for the state of Israel. “In today’s Israeli culture war,” she notes, “queerness—or at least the tolerance of queerness—has acquired a new rhetorical value for mainstream Zionism: standing against the imposition of fundamentalist religious law, it has come to stand for democratic liberalism.” The positive rhetorical function of queerness for Zionism, however, goes beyond those internal culture wars (between secular Jews and religious Jews) into the wider culture wars between Israelis and Palestinians, where it functions to consolidate a fractured Zionist consensus by casting Palestinians as the ultimate “Other” for their alleged essentialist homophobia.\n\nDoes the Palestinian Queer Exist? And Can She Speak? Palestinian queerness exists, but its discourses and practices are entangled in the context of colonialism, nationalism, religion, and patriarchy. Let me illustrate through using lessons from two Palestinian queer groups, Aswat and Al-Qaws. As explained on its website, Aswat is “a group of lesbian, bisexual, transgender, intersex, questioning and queer Palestinian women that came together in 2002 and established a home for Palestinian LBTQI women to allow safe, supportive and empowering spaces to express and address their personal, social and political struggles as a national indigenous minority living inside Israel; as women in a patriarchal society; and as LBTQI women in a wider hetero-normative culture.” Alternatively, AlQaws for Sexual & Gender Diversity in Palestinian Society is a grassroots group, formed in November 2007 to create what its website describes as “a sustainable, visible, and truly impactful Palestinian LGBTQ movement that focuses on fostering the unity of the Palestinian LGBTQ community; connecting the local/global, anti-colonial, and queer feminist; and defying borders created by Israeli occupation.” While Aswat’s approach centers on advancing lesbian women’s rights and empowering them, Al-Qaws has adopted a universalist queer activism agenda that transcends political, ideological, and social divisions. Three major challenges restrict Palestinian queer women from setting their own discourse. The first challenge to forging a queer Palestinian\n\nPalestinian Queerness and the Orientalist Paradigm\n\n|\n\n47\n\nagenda is the context of occupation and racism. Al-Qaws refuses to prioritize the issue of nationalism over the issue of advancing the rights of Palestinian queers living between Israel, the West Bank, Gaza, and sometimes the diaspora. As a political choice dictated by the lived realities of Palestinian queers, Al-Qaws’s approach is the best alternative to the “prioritizing model” of struggle that has dominated the Palestinian national movement for decades and that had crippled the progressive forces within this movement. As a consequence of this prioritizing paradigm, leftist and women’s groups could not forge a connection between what they called a “social agenda” and “a national agenda.” Issues relating to sexuality, for instance, were meant to be dealt with after (national) liberation. Despite its youth, Al-Qaws, in my opinion, has already much to teach the more established Palestinian women’s movement and leftist groups. Another challenge facing Palestinian queer organizations is that of building a safe community where LGBTQ Palestinians can grow personally and politically. Again, homophobia and patriarchy are only part of the story—almost the easy part, as Samira Saraya explains: “For a Palestinian lesbian citizen of Israel, it will likely take a lot of maneuvering for her to successfully attend one of Aswat’s meetings; for a lesbian living in the West Bank this ‘mission’ is almost impossible, and for the one in Gaza, it is not even remotely conceivable” (Hochberg 2010b, 610). But despite this fragmentation, both Aswat and Al-Qaws include members who live in Israel, the West Bank, and Gaza. In and of itself, that is an important political achievement that insists on Palestinianness as a primary category of identification. The community Aswat and Al-Qaws create by being “out”—in the political sense—is crucial for loosening the grip that the trope “homosexuality as collaboration” has on Palestinian society. One Palestinian queer activist told me that the main reason for his decision to return to the West Bank and not continue his graduate studies abroad was Al-Qaws’ decision to work in Ramallah. Although this is an individual story, I do believe it reflects the difference local queer Palestinian activism is already making and has the potential to make. The third challenge, which is particularly frustrating, is that these queer activists have to contend with accusations that they are embracing an “inauthentic” identity that is foreign to Arab and Muslim culture. It is not that such accusations are anything new. Palestinian (and Arab)\n\n48\n\n| Amal Amireh\n\nfeminists and leftists had always to justify themselves against charges launched at them by Islamists and conservative nationalists that their ideologies, lifestyles, and political agendas are marks of contamination by either an imperialist West or a communist East. The newness of these queer organizations, the small number of members, and their NGO status in some cases have been used against them to discredit their rootedness, relevance, and loyalties. They have been seen as tools of what Joseph Massad (2007) calls the “Gay International” that seeks to impose a heterosexual-homosexual regime on the Middle East as the continuation of the colonial, orientalist project in the area. For Palestinian queers, the Gay International, if relevant at all, is much less relevant than the realities of occupation, racism, and homophobia with which they have to contend daily. Yet, scholars like Joseph Massad (2007) are unable to see anticolonial queer Arab activists outside the orientalism paradigm.\n\nThe Misapplication of Orientalism I contend that positions such as Massad’s are a misapplication of models drawn from Michel Foucault’s History of Sexuality (1984) and Edward Said’s Orientalism (1978). As David Halperin (1998) reminds us, when Foucault wrote about the inv"
