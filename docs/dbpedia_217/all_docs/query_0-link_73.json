        "text": "An outbreak of lumpy skin disease (LSD) was reported among cattle in El-Menia Governorate, Upper Egypt during the summer season of 1998. In July 1998, nine villages were visited at different localities of El-Menia Governorate and all suspected cases were clinically examined as well as the epidemiological data of the outbreak were collected. Cattle of all ages were affected. The disease was observed in both indigenous and Holstein-Friesian cattle, with an increase in the severity of the disease among Friesian breeds. Epidemiological data revealed that the insect vectors, which present in high populations during the summer season, are incriminated in transmission and spreading of LSD virus. The morbidities are ranged from 20 to 75% in the nine investigated villages, while the mortality rates are estimated as less than 1%. Clinically the disease was characterized by fever, sudden appearance of firm rounded skin nodules, enlargement of superficial lymph nodes and edema of the limbs. The skin nodules were of about 1-4 cm in diameter and were covered with erected hair. LSD virus was detected by inoculation onto chrioallantoic membrane of embryonated egg and identified by indirect immunoflourscent technique. Transmission electron microscopy was used for demonstration of the LSD viral particles in the tissue samples and inoculated CAM. Also, the ultrastrucural features were described. Agar gel precipitation test (AGPT) and complement fixation test (CFT) were used for detection of LSD antibodies in the collected sera. The present study reported the re-occurrence of LSD epizootic in Egypt ten years after the appearance of the disease for the first time in the country in May 1988. Preparation of specific vaccine against LDS and application of an accurate vaccination programs are in need. Controlling of the insect vector will reduce the reappearance and spreading of the disease among cattle populations in the African countries.\n\nIbrahim H A Abd El-Rahim\n\nÂ·\n\nMuhsen Hussein\n\nThis study describes an epizootic of respiratory tract disease caused by influenza virus infection in a large population of equines in Luxor and Aswan, Upper Egypt, during the winter of 2000. The epizootic started in January and the infection rate reached its peak in February before gradually decreasing until the end of April, 2000. Horses, donkeys and mules of all ages and both sexes were affected. Free movement of the infected equines and direct contact between the animals at markets facilitated the rapid spread of the disease. The cause of the epizootic was established by use of serological testing and the identification of the influenza virus in nasal secretions. Egg inoculation and the haemagglutination test were used to detect the influenza virus. Both haemagglutination inhibition (HI) and agar gel precipitation tests were performed to identify the isolated influenza virus using reference antisera against A/Equi-1 (H7N7) and A/Equi-2 (H3N8). Antibodies against the equine influenza virus were demonstrated in 416 (95.6%) out of 435 collected sera using the HI test. High rectal temperature, inappetence, conjunctivitis, redness of nasal mucosa, a serous to mucopurulent nasal discharge and a harsh dry cough were the most common clinical manifestations. Stress factors, such as using equines for heavy transportation and drawing, precipitated the onset of the disease, intensified the clinical syndrome, delayed recovery and facilitated secondary bacterial infection. The present study suggested that the absence of a vaccination programme against equine influenza was one of the principal causes of the spread of infection during this outbreak. In conclusion, the implementation of a national equine influenza vaccination programme, using an effective updated vaccine, is essential in Egypt.\n\nView"
