        "text": "Cervical/pectoral osteoderms\n\nWestern Science Center 16505.1 is identified as a possible right medial cranial/pectoral osteoderm. The medial cervical/pectoral osteoderms of Edmontonia rugosidens (AMNH 5665) (Plates 5, 8 in Gilmore (1930)), Panoplosaurus mirus (Plates 5, 6 in Lambe (1919)), and G. mimus (Figs. 2 and 5B in Burns (2008)) have straight medial margins, suggesting that the straight preserved margin on WSC 16505.1 is the medial margin ( – ). WSC 16505.1 preserves the caudal and medial margins, but is broken along the cranial and lateral margins ( – ). The caudal margin is straight immediately medial to the caudal end of the keel, but then curves craniomedially into the straight medial margin, suggesting a rectangular or subrectangular shape reminiscent of the medial cervical/pectoral osteoderms of Edmontonia rugosidens (AMNH 5665) (Gilmore, 1930) and G. mimus (Morphotype F of Burns (2008)). Lateral to the keel, the caudal margin curves craniolaterally. The caudal margin is overall convex, with the caudal-most point on the osteoderm being the caudal end of the keel, as on the medial cervical/pectoral osteoderms of E. rugosidens, P. mirus, and G. mimus. The preserved margins are rugose, with an intricate morphology of furrows, small projecting bumps, and, at the caudal end of the keel, abundant neurovascular pits ( – ). The osteoderm thins considerably toward its preserved margins. At the thickest preserved point on the keel, the osteoderm is 1.8 cm thick, while it is only 0.6 cm thick along its medial margin. This thinning occurs gradually, such that the medial flank of the keel exhibits a very gentle gradient and the keel is poorly defined compared to the rest of the osteoderm’s external surface. The keel itself is low, rounded, and thins cranially so that it appears not to have reached the cranial margin ( – ).\n\nWestern Science Center 16505.1 is the only osteoderm in WSC 16505 that exhibits any degree of projecting rugosity on its external surface. The entire external surface is covered in small subcircular neurovascular pits of more or less uniform size, though a few larger pits occur adjacent to the caudal margin and on the caudal end of the keel ( and ). On the keel and near the caudal margin of the osteoderm, the pits are interspersed with small patches of projecting rugosity. This rugosity diminishes toward the cranial margin. Toward the cranial margin, the pitted texture continues, but the surfaces among the pits are smooth, as is the case on the entire external surfaces of all other osteoderms in WSC 16505. The transition from pitted and rugose to pitted and smooth texture is abrupt. There are no neurovascular grooves present on the preserved portion of the osteoderm.\n\nThe basal surface of this medial cervical/pectoral osteoderm is similar to the external in exhibiting a large number of small pits of uniform size distributed randomly over the entire surface ( ). Projecting bumps are present on the basal surface as well, though compared to the external surface these bumps are more prominent, fewer in number, more widely spaced, and extend the entire preserved craniocaudal length of the osteoderm. The basal surface has a woven appearance, with visible structural fibers. Adjacent to the medial margin of the osteoderm, the basal surface is flat. However, lateral to this flat expanse, the basal surface becomes arched, with a broad, shallow concavity extending craniocaudally and corresponding to the keel on the external surface ( ).\n\nWestern Science Center 16505.2 is identified as a medial cervical/pectoral osteoderm based upon similarities with the medial cervical/pectoral osteoderms of Glyptodontopelta (Fig. 5B in Burns (2008)), including a straight, sharp keel that is dorsally convex toward its cranial end ( – ). The preserved portion of the cranial margin of WSC 16505.2 is gently convex, similar to the craniolateral margins of the left medial cervical/pectoral osteoderms of Glyptodontopelta (Figs. 2 and 5B in Burns (2008)) and different from the square craniomedial margins of those same osteoderms. This suggests that WSC 16505.2 is a left medial cervical/pectoral osteoderm. WSC 16505.2 is broken medially and caudally, and is missing most of its lateral margin ( – ). The texture of the cranial margin is similar to that of the medial and caudal margins of WSC 16505.1, though with less pronounced rugosity. As in WSC 16505.1, WSC16505.2 becomes much thinner along its margins and away from its keel. At its greatest preserved depth, the keel’s apicobasal thickness is 2.2 cm. At the cranial margin, the osteoderm thins to only 0.6 cm. However, in contrast to WSC 16505.1, the keel of WSC 16505.2 reaches the cranial margin and is well demarcated along its entire preserved length except at the cranial margin, where it diminishes and merges with the margin ( and – ). The keel is more sharply defined on WSC 16505.2 than on WSC 16505.1, with steeper lateral and medial flanks.\n\nThe entire preserved external surface of WSC 16505.2 is akin to that of the cranial portion of WSC 16505.1: smooth with no rugosity and numerous, randomly distributed, small pits ( ). Most of the pits on WSC 16505.2 are miniscule, smaller than those on WSC 16505.1, although larger pits are present along the apex of the keel. WSC 16505.2 also differs from WSC 16505.1 in the presence of a small number of randomly distributed neurovascular grooves. Some of these grooves are simple, non-branching furrows, while others bifurcate, forming a Y-shaped groove with the opening of the “Y” directed laterally ( ).\n\nThe basal surface of WSC 16505.2 lacks the projecting bumps present on WSC 16505.1. Otherwise, the basal surfaces of the two osteoderms are similar, with abundant small pits and a broad, shallow groove extending craniocaudally and corresponding to the keel on the external surface ( ).\n\nWestern Science Center 16505.3 is identified as the distal osteoderm of the left side of the second cervical half-ring. It is nearly complete, missing only some small portions of the medial margin ( – ). This osteoderm is more oval in shape than WSC 16505.1 and 16505.2, making it difficult to delineate the cranial and caudal margins from the medial margin. In contrast, the lateral margin is easily demarcated; the cranial-most margin of the osteoderm is incomplete, but the caudal-most margin is preserved and forms an abrupt, only slightly obtuse angle with the lateral margin. The preserved margins are similar to the rugose margins of WSC 16505.1 and 16505.2.\n\nThe keel of this distal cervical osteoderm is strongly laterally offset, as on the distal osteoderms of the second cervical half-ring of E. rugosidens (AMNH 5665). However, the distal cervical osteoderm of I. zephyri differs from those of AMNH 5665 in that the keel curves laterally, rather than medially, toward its cranial end ( ). The keel is very pronounced, with a steep medial flank and precipitous, nearly vertical lateral flank. At its deepest point, the keel is 2.2 cm thick. At a point directly lateral to this along the lateral margin, the osteoderm is only 0.8 cm thick.\n\nThe external surface of this distal cervical osteoderm is very similar to that of WSC 16505.2: smooth with numerous miniscule pits and a smaller number of larger pits along the apex of the keel, and a small number of randomly distributed neurovascular grooves ( ). The basal surface also is similar in texture to that of WSC 16505.2, with abundant small pits randomly distributed over the entire surface and a broad, shallow, longitudinal concavity corresponding to the position of the keel on the external surface. WSC 16505.3 measures 6.3 cm at its greatest mediolateral width and 8.4 cm at its greatest craniocaudal length.\n\nThoracic osteoderms\n\nThe life placements of ankylosaur thoracic osteoderms can be inferred from the position of the keel, as noted by Burns (2008). A keel located at or near the midline of an osteoderm indicates that the osteoderm was positioned near the animal’s midline. A keel offset to the right or left, resulting in an asymmetrical osteoderm, indicates that the osteoderm was positioned more laterally. Three distinct morphotypes are present among the thoracic osteoderms of WSC 16505.\n\nThoracic osteoderm WSC 16505.4 is incomplete cranially but appears similar to Morphotype A of Burns (2008), though perhaps with a more prominent keel ( – ). The caudal margin of this osteoderm is moderately rugose, similar to the margins of WSC 16505.2 and 16505.3 ( – ). At the caudal end of the keel, situated at the caudal margin of the osteoderm, the osteoderm is 1.8 cm thick. The offset of the keel indicates that this osteoderm was situated laterally.\n\nThe external surface texture of WSC 16505.4 is consistent with the cervical/pectoral osteoderms. The texture is smooth, with numerous neurovascular pits of roughly the same size randomly distributed from the keel to the margins. Three subparallel non-branching neurovascular grooves are present lateral to the keel ( ); a single non-branching groove is discernible medial to the keel. This is reminiscent of the characteristic dendritic pattern of neurovascular grooves on the osteoderms of G. mimus (Burns, 2008); however, none of the osteoderms of WSC 16505 exhibit the density of radiating neurovascular grooves to both sides of the keel exhibited by G. mimus (Figs. 4–6 in Burns (2008)). The basal surface is not as well preserved as the external, though it was clearly gently concave ( ).\n\nAnother large thoracic osteoderm, WSC 16505.5, was apparently similar in shape to WSC 16505.4, at least in having a rounded caudal margin ( – ). The keel of WSC 16505.5 is low, rounded, and poorly defined, unlike that of WSC 16505.4. The subtlety of the keel of WSC 16505.5 is reminiscent of Morphotype B in G. mimus (Burns, 2008). However, the keel of WSC 16505.5 differs from those of Glyptodontopelta and other nodosaurids in having a “split” morphology, with a deep, sharply defined groove extending craniocaudally along the apex of the keel ( ). The smooth, copiously pitted external surface texture continues uninterrupted into this groove, with no deformation that might signify a pathological nature. This same feature is also present on a thoracic osteoderm of UMNH VP 28351, one of the specimens referred to Invictarx (see Thoracic osteoderms of UMNH VP 28351 below). This feature is also present on some thoracic osteoderms of the ankylosaurids A. lambei and P. coombsi (Figs. 13G and 13O in Penkalski (2018)) (P. Penkalski, 2018, personal communication).\n\nThe external surface texture of WSC 16505.5 closely resembles that of the other osteoderms in the specimen, with a smooth surface invaded by numerous, randomly distributed pits of uniform size ( ). A single short neurovascular groove branches off from the elongate groove that forms the “split-keel” morphology. The basal surface is nearly featureless, except for a small number of randomly distributed pits ( ). The basal surface is flat apart from a very slight arching ventral to the keel.\n\nThe only complete thoracic osteoderm, WSC 16505.6, is also the most puzzling. It is quite small compared to the other osteoderms in WSC 16505, and fits the definition of an “ossicle” as proposed by Burns & Currie (2014): “small (<70 mm), amorphous mineralized dermal elements often found interstitial to major osteodermal elements.” WSC 16505.6 measures only 5.1 cm across at its maximum width. This ossicle is uniformly very thin, only 0.5 cm thick at its center. The external surface is very slightly concave with no trace of a keel, while the basal surface is flat ( – ). WSC 16505.6 is quite similar in size and shape to Morphotype D in G. mimus (Burns, 2008). Despite their thinness, the margins of WSC 16505.6 are highly rugose, similar to those of WSC 16505.1, the medial cervical/pectoral osteoderm described above ( – ). The external and basal surface textures of WSC 16505.6 are like those of the other osteoderms in WSC 16505, especially the larger thoracic osteoderm WSC 16505.5 ( and ). There are two well-defined neurovascular grooves on the external surface, one non-branching and the other bifurcating.\n\nCervical/pectoral osteoderms\n\nNatural History Museum of Utah VP 28351 includes a broad, thick plate that most likely pertains to one of the cervical/pectoral half-rings. This osteoderm is broken on all sides apart from the inferred caudal margin. The caudal margin is not straight, but rather comes to a rounded protrusion ( and ). This morphology is also present on the medial cervical/pectoral osteoderms of P. mirus (Lambe, 1919), E. rugosidens (AMNH 5665) (Gilmore, 1930), and G. mimus (Burns, 2008). Furthermore, in its indistinct, gentle keel and cross-sectional shape this osteoderm of UMNH VP 28351 closely matches WSC 16505.1, a right medial cervical/pectoral osteoderm, albeit much thicker ( and – ). Unlike many of the osteoderms of UMNH VP 28351, this medial cervical/pectoral osteoderm preserves patches of the external surface texture. This closely resembles that of WSC 16505 in being smooth with numerous neurovascular pits ( ), supporting referral of UMNH VP 28351 to I. zephyri. Short, non-branching grooves are also present on these patches of surface texture. The basal surface texture is not well preserved, but sideritic infilling has revealed the presence of abundant pitting ( ).\n\nNatural History Museum of Utah VP 28351 includes another very thick osteoderm that is unlike any of the osteoderms of WSC 16505 and UMNH VP 28350. This osteoderm is broken on all sides. A siderite coating has obscured the external surface texture, and the basal surface texture has been weathered away ( ). Nevertheless, the discernible morphology of this osteoderm allows some precision as to its identification. A low but distinct keel is present on the external surface. Caudally, this keel becomes much wider mediolaterally and the osteoderm overall becomes much thicker, forming an oval pedestal that is truncated by a break ( – ). This morphology resembles the bases of the cervical/pectoral and thoracic spines of E. rugosidens (AMNH 5665, TMP 1998.98.1, USNM 11868; Gilmore, 1930). E. rugosidens is unusual in having four osteoderms on either side of the second cervical half-ring—broad, plate-like medial, lateral, and distal osteoderms, and a craniolaterally-directed spine (AMNH 5665) (Gilmore, 1930). In other nodosaurids for which all three cervical/pectoral half-rings are preserved, there are only three osteoderms on either side of the second cervical half-ring; this is the case in S. condrayi (Eaton, 1960; Carpenter & Kirkland, 1998), S. edwardsorum (Carpenter & Kirkland, 1998), and B. markmitchelli (Brown et al., 2017). If WSC 16505.3 is correctly identified as the left distal osteoderm of a second cervical half-ring, then it is likely that the spine of UMNH VP 28351 was in the distal position on one side of the pectoral half-ring or the first thoracic band. E. rugosidens (AMNH 5665) (Gilmore, 1930) and B. markmitchelli (Brown et al., 2017) have distal spines on both the pectoral half-ring and first thoracic band.\n\nNatural History Museum of Utah VP 28351 includes another fragment that probably belonged to a distal spine. This piece is a tapering prong with a D-shaped cross-section and inflated sides ( and ). External bone surface is present on only one of the three sides; this resembles the external surface texture of the other osteoderms of WSC 16505, UMNH VP 28350, and UMNH VP 28351 in having numerous small pits distributed over an otherwise smooth surface. Based upon comparisons with the spines of E. rugosidens (e.g., AMNH 5665, TMP 1998.98.1), this fragment is interpreted as the tip of a spine. It is impossible to ascertain whether it is part of the same spine as the osteoderm described above.\n\nThoracic osteoderms\n\nThere are four morphotypes distinguishable among the thoracic osteoderms of UMNH VP 28351, all of which are also represented among the osteoderms of WSC 16505 and UMNH VP 28350. The first thoracic morphotype includes two partial osteoderms and at least two additional fragments. The two partial osteoderms are very thick with flat bases and sharp, prominent midline keels ( ). Due to weathering and siderite coating, details of the margins and external and basal surface textures cannot be discerned. However, in cross-sectional shape, these two osteoderms are similar to the large, craniocaudally elongate thoracic osteoderm of UMNH VP 28350, despite breakage of the apex of the keel on the osteoderm of UMNH VP 28350 ( – , , , and ). Like the osteoderm of UMNH VP 28350, these two thoracic osteoderms of UMNH VP 28351 appear to have been craniocaudally elongate elements similar to Types D and E osteoderms of E. carbonensis (Kirkland et al., 2013). The midline positions of the keels of these two osteoderms indicate that they were probably situated near the midline of the animal. They are so similar in size and morphology that they might even constitute a left-right pair positioned parasagitally, as in the in situ thoracic bands of Borealopelta markmitchelli (Brown et al., 2017).\n\nThe next thoracic morphotype observable in UMNH VP 28351 consists of more laterally positioned osteoderms with offset keels. This morphotype appears to be the most abundant class of osteoderm in UMNH VP 28351, with numerous fragments exhibiting small segments of offset keels. However, only two examples are sufficiently complete for meaningful comparison with the osteoderms of WSC 16505 and UMNH VP 28350. One example bears a strong resemblance in cross-sectional shape to the two well-preserved lateral thoracic osteoderms of UMNH VP 28350 ( – and – ). The apex of the keel and all the margins are broken in the osteoderm of UMNH VP 28351, and the external and basal surface textures are not preserved. The other example of this thoracic morphotype probably is the cranial end of an osteoderm very similar to WSC 16505.4, the caudal portion of a lateral thoracic osteoderm in the holotype of I. zephyri (see Thoracic osteoderms of WSC 16505 above). WSC 16505.4 and the osteoderm of UMNH VP 28351 are alike in cross-sectional shape and thickness, the prominence of the offset keel, and moderately rugose medial margin ( , , , and – ). The keel of the UMNH VP 28351 osteoderm diminishes cranially, while the keel of WSC 16505.4 remains prominent up to the caudal margin.\n\nThe next thoracic morphotype is represented by only one definite example, which is an osteoderm fragment broken on all sides but exhibiting well-preserved external surface texture. It is similar to WSC 16505.5, a thoracic osteoderm of uncertain placement in the holotype of I. zephyri. WSC 16505.5 and the UMNH VP 28351 osteoderm share nearly flat bases; overall smooth external surface texture with numerous small pits of roughly uniform size and random distribution; and a low, rounded keel ( – , and ). Most importantly, this thoracic osteoderm of UMNH VP 28351 exhibits a deep groove extending craniocaudally along the apex of the keel, as in WSC 16505.5. This “split-keel” morphology supports referral of UMNH VP 28351 to Invictarx.\n\nThe final thoracic morphotype is represented by numerous flat, thin osteoderm fragments. Most of these are simply nondescript shards; however, two examples are sufficiently large and well-preserved for comparison with other osteoderms. Both examples are quite thin, only 0.6 cm thick at their thickest preserved points. Their preserved margins are highly rugose ( – ). On the larger of the two fragments, siderite infilling has highlighted the presence of abundant small pits of roughly uniform size and random distribution; the external surface texture is otherwise smooth ( ). In all these features, these osteoderms of UMNH VP 28351 match WSC 16505.6, a thoracic interstitial ossicle in the holotype of I. zephyri ( – )."
