        "text": "Yes another guest post and yes we’re back on the tyrannosaurines again. While I’ve already talked somewhat about the impact of the artwork (that by now everyone is familiar with) I’ve not talked process. Here is a chance to make that up as Bob Nicholls returns to the Musings again (see here, here and here for starters!) to talk about how he created this piece. My thanks once again to him for his superb work:\n\nBeing the first artist to illustrate a new species of extinct animal is a great honour. The series of events that are required to successfully fossilise a dinosaur and for that individual to be revealed to the world millions of years after death is an epic story. In brief, the dinosaur first died in a location where its remains were covered by sediment rapidly. The animal’s remains then hid within the Earth and lay undisturbed for a length of time we cannot imagine. During this vast period the dead creature’s species will evolve out of existence and new life forms will survive catastrophes to colonize our planet. Eventually a species of energy hungry ape developed an interest in investigating planet Earth’s history and against the odds our fossilised dinosaur was discovered. One of the apes, let’s call him Dave Hone, then decided to reveal the dinosaur to his entire ape species and asked a friend, let’s call him Bob Nicholls, to illustrate the wonderful discovery. It may sound like a simple tale, but if you really think about it, it is astonishing. To be a small part of it makes the hair on the back of my neck stand up. There is no greater honour for a palaeontologist than to be the first to show the world what a long extinct animal looked like. Especially a tyrannosaur!\n\nThe illustration of Zhuchengtyrannus took me about eight hours in total, from the first preliminary drawing to e-mail delivery. The first sketch was a satisfactory pose but four re-draws were required to make small adjustments to the teeth, snout, nostril and eye. When Dave was happy for me to render the colour artwork I painted it with acrylic paint on illustration card. I chose to paint the colour scheme of a show-off male with an eye stripe and blood red patches for impressing the tyrannosaur ladies. I wish Dave and I could have worked on the piece a little longer but it was an excellent and most enjoyable day’s work. Zhuchengtyrannus is dead, long live Zhuchengtyrannus!\n\nMy guest posts are generally exclusive but this one’s doing the rounds after Tom Holtz wrote this up on the DML. The title question was recently asked by Roberto Takata on the Dinosaur Mailing List and Tom took up the challenge. :\n\nI think that is a good question. What really are the most important elements of paleontology that the general public should understand? I took a shot at coming up with a list of key concepts, based on experiences with teaching paleontology and historical geology and with less-formally structured outreach to the public. I have offered this list (cross posted at the Sauropod Vertebrae Picture of the Week and Superoceras blogs) as a way for it to reach a wider audience. That this is Darwin Week makes it even more appropriate, as we should use this occasion to encourage a better understanding of the changes of Earth and Life through Time for the public at large.\n\nMuch as I might like to think otherwise, the specific details of the hindlimb function of Tyrannosaurus rex or the pneumatic features of brachiosaurid vertebrae really are not the most important elements of the field. Understanding and appreciating the nitty gritty details of the phylogeny and anatomy of any particular branch of the Tree of Life are not really necessary for everyone to know, any more than we would regard detailed knowledge of bacterial biochemistry or the partitioning of minerals in a magma chamber to be significant general knowledge. (Indeed, these latter two items are actually far more critical for human society than any specific aspect of paleontology, and so from a certain point of view really more important for people to know than the History of Life.)\n\nThat said, all human societies and many individuals have wondered about where we have come from and how the world came to be the way it is. This is, in my opinion, the greatest contribution of paleontology: it gives us the Story of Earth and Life, and especially our own story.\n\nI have divided this list into two sections. The first is a list of general topics of paleontology, touching on the main elements of geology that someone would need to know for fossils to make any sense. The second is the more specific list of key points in the history of life.\n\n(NOTE: as the idea of this list is that it should be aimed at the general public, I have tried to avoid technical terminology where possible.)\n\nContinue reading ‘Not exactly a guest post: What Should Everyone Know About Paleontology?’"
