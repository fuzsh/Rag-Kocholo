        "text": "Now that Spinosaurus and Velociraptor has found TF fame through Scorn and Slash, and that we´re gonna have a plesiosaur in the form of (not-)Paddles, what other dinosaurs could be interesting to turn into Dinobots? Here are a few suggestions on my part:\n\nTherizinosaurus - Definitely different from most dinosaurs, anatomically. Impressive giant claws... a challenge for any toy designer...\n\nCarnotaurus - One of the oddest carnosaurs out there, naturally weaponized...\n\nGigantoraptor - Again, something different from the overall bulkiness of the Dinobots. How about turning those arm- and tail feathers into sharp blades?\n\nAmargasaurus - Neck spike mayhem!\n\nKentrosaurus - Even more spikey mayhem!\n\nPachyrhinosaurus - It has a battering ram built into its face!\n\nAnd from here on, not true dinosaurs but nevertheless prehistoric reptiles!\n\nNyctosaurus - What if its head-sail is some sort of vibro-blade?\n\nShonisaurus - A whale-sized ichtyosaur, some serious backup for Paddles!\n\nLiopleurodon - Another whale-sized behemoth, slower than Shoni but with more massive jaws...\n\nTylosaurus - This beast from the Cretaceous oceans of Kansas is both swift and powerful... The king of the oceans of its age!\n\n...so what do you think? Can there be too many dinobots? Or should we have a team of Dinocons? Any other species you´d like to become Dinobots? Lemme know what you think!\n\nGreat suggetions! I especially agree with the following:\n\nParasaurolophus - Perhaps the most iconic dinosaur species not yet getting a proper transformers character (except as part of the PCC Dinobots)\n\nSauropelta - It has got some serious melee potential with those spikes!\n\nDimetrodon - A true icon, also part of Dino-PCC, but needs its own proper character. What if the back sail was a chainsaw?\n\nEstemmenosuchus - That face!\n\nTapejara - Another flying blade-head!\n\n...and a few more additions of my own:\n\nInostrancevia - The sabertooth of the age of reptiles!\n\nAnkylosaurus - Another dinosaur icon that needs to be lifted out of its PCC drone-only status...\n\nEDIT: I just found out about Slapper...\n\nCeratosaurus - Because I always dug that nose horn!\n\nEven tho not technically a dinosaur I always had a fascination with the Megalodon Shark,that thing makes the great white seem like an aquarium fish,the Megalodon can get as big as some whales of today,oh and I'm talking 65-70 feet long.\n\nOh and while I'm at it here are some other prehistoric creatures (not just dinosaurs) I'd like to see get made in the TF Line:\n\nSabertooth Tiger man would those teeth be the stuff of nightmares if one was after you.\n\nThose little dinosaurs at the beginning of Jurassic Park 3 that were about a foot high (perfect troop builders).\n\nI always liked the Rhamphorhynchus air raptor due to its small size of 3 feet wingspan,and even tho I love Swoop in any design I just think Hasbro should do a 2nd flying dinosaur design,namely the Rhamphor.\n\nThe ever popular pterodactyl (and his smaller cousin Nemicolopterus at only 10 inches fully grown),these creatures epitomize why Hasbro should do more Dinobot Transformers,they are just wondrous to think what they lived like 100s of millions of years ago.\n\nSo in closing I just say Hasbro should create a whole new line with nothing but Dinosaurs and maybe some more modern prehistoric creatures like that Sabertooth Tiger I wrote about,so I hope Hasbro considers giving them there own line and call it something like Dinobot Island 2 (I know LAME but its the only thing I can think of on short notice).Later all.\n\nYou could have a whole sub-line of dino type Transformers, and here is how. Thunderwing, while researching for organic pretender technology solutions, found a planet similar to Earth that had indigenous earth-like prehistoric species, he planted a techno-organic virus into the ecosystems as an experiment that would eventually turn all full organic things into a Cybertronian like sub-species over millions of years of evolution. He wanted to see how they could be melded. At the same time, just in case it all worked out, he seeded the planets core to become an Energon producing body that would spread the energy throughout the planet and then the native organics would help weed out the impurities of the Energon through millions of years of recycling, from consumption to breakdown to decomposition to back into the planet and then remade as a more potent and compatible food source for the average Cybertronian. He did all this (lets just say) in preparation of Cybertrons possible destruction. The virus worked, the Energon became a super fuel and eventually made the beasts of the planet live longer and achieve a super intelligence of their own, although they never achieved the ability to transform. Later, Science Division groups from both Decepticons and Autobots found the Energon signal as it became its most potent and both sent large exploration groups to investigate. To search for the mysteries of the planet without being stopped by the native Dinotronians the Cybertronians needed to blend in and took native forms. Adventure and hilarity ensues.....Bam.\n\nThere is your reason to make an ass load of new dino type characters and since its all made up and let's not get into any evolutionary conundrums, we'll just say that all the coolest beasts were on it.\n\nOr whatever....don't kill me super fan boys for my possible plot holes, I just want more dinobots.\n\nHey, I love that backstory!"
