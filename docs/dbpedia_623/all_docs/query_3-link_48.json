        "text": "Sources of morphological variation (dimorphism, individual variability, ontogeny, and pathology) can obfuscate taxonomic variation. This is true for Late Cretaceous nodosaurid ankylosaurs, for which several complete, well-preserved skulls and postcrania are known. Although a generalized taxonomy has been accepted for about 25 years, new specimens show mixtures of features considered diagnostic for more than one taxon. Because these taxa are well-accepted and overlap temporally and geographically, they are good candidates for testing intraspecific variation in dinosaurs. This was done by quantitatively testing taxonomic characters a priori with bivariate and clustering analyses. A character-specimen matrix was coded for a parsimony analysis to aid in taxonomic referrals. Because many phylogenetic characters are based on relative proportions or shapes, taphonomic distortion is problematic for this group. Nevertheless, four taxa are valid: Edmontonia longiceps, E. rugosidens, Panoplosaurus mirus, and Denversaurus schlessmani, the latter two more derived. Compared to contemporaneous North American ankylosaurids, nodosaurid taxa do not correlate as well with their stratigraphic distribution. A posteriori character analysis reveals that Panoplosaurus has a shortened skull and rounded cervical/pectoral osteoderms. Denversaurus and Panoplosaurus share inflated cranial sculpturing with visible sulci between individual elements. Denversaurus has a relatively wider anterior snout. The clade shows some overall evolutionary trends: doming of the skull over the orbits, thickening of the vomer and closure of prevomer foramen, encroachment of sculpturing over the anterior temporal bar, shortening and widening of the snout, etc. Use of proportional character data is common in dinosaur systematics, often subjectively. This study demonstrates that quantitatively testing such characters increases their repeatability and clarifies taxonomic decisions."
