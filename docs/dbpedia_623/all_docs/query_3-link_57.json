        "text": "The atlas is composed of a ventral intercentrum and a pair of dorsal neural arches (Figure 8A–D, F and G). In anterior view, the atlas is rotated clockwise through 30° with respect to the other preserved vertebrae (Figure 8F). It is much wider transversely than long anteroposteriorly . The intercentrum is crescentic to reniform in outline in anterior view and possesses an anterior articular surface that is broadly concave and faces anterodorsally (Figure 8F). A massive but short swelling is present on either side of the lateral surface that is directed ventrally and laterally, anterior to which is a low anterodorsally directed ridge (Figure 8F and G). This ridge is separated from the swelling by a distinct anterodorsally directed trough. Viewed ventrally, a pair of arrow-like depressions, which point posterolaterally, occupies the posterior-most surface of the intercentrum to form sharp posterior margins (Figure 8G). This feature appears to be unique to Yuxisaurus and is absent in Scelidosaurus (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a) and Scutellosaurus (Breeden and Rowe, 2020; Breeden et al., 2021). In contrast to Yuxisaurus, the ventral surface of the atlantal intercentrum in Stegosaurus bears two posterolaterally directed ridges and a subtle midline ridge separating two cavities (Maidment et al., 2015). The left neural arch is incompletely preserved but resembles closely the right one where preserved. The right pedicle is cylindrical, with an expanded ventral base articulating with the intercentrum. The postzygapophysis is a thin plate, extending posterodorsally, as in Scelidosaurus (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a) and Gastonia (Kinneer et al., 2016), but its lateral margin bulges and thickens. A small plate above the neural arch probably represents the proatlas.\n\nThe axial centrum is massive and approximately equally long and wide (Figure 8A, C and D). Viewed laterally both its anterior and posterior articular surfaces are inclined anteriorly, giving it a trapezoidal outline (Figure 8A and C). Its anterior articular surface is strongly concave but the posterior surface appears to be flatter. The anteroventrally placed triangular parapophysis is prominent, expanding laterally, posterior to which a distinct depression extends over the lateral surface (Figure 8A). The ventral surface of the centrum is smooth, with a rounded ridge in the center that is flanked by oblique surfaces laterally (Figure 8D), similar to the condition in Scutellosaurus (Breeden et al., 2021). By contrast, the axial centra of Scelidosaurus (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a), Stegosaurus (NHMUK PV R36730; Maidment et al., 2015), and Gargoyleosaurus, all bear a midline keel. In lateral view, the left diapophysis is directed ventrally (Figure 8A), but its tip is separated from the parapophysis by an anterodorsally extending trough. The right diapophysis is concealed by a cervical rib and surrounding matrix. In other thyreophorans, such as Scelidosaurus (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a), Stegosaurus (NHMUK PV R36730; Maidment et al., 2015), and Sauropelta (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003), the diapophysis is directed ventrally but also slightly laterally and can be seen in ventral view. Both of the prezygapophyses curve laterally and ventrally and bear slightly convex articular facets (Figure 8A and B). Due to rotation of the atlas (see above), the right prezygapophysis of the axis does not articulate with the corresponding atlantal postzygapophysis. The postzygapophysis expands and diverges laterally to a greater degree than the prezygapophysis in dorsal view (Figure 8B). Its articular facet faces ventrally and is slightly concave as in the ankylosaur Sauropelta (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003), but differs from Scelidosaurus in which the articular facet faces ventrolaterally (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a). A flat lamina above the diapophysis connects the base of the prezygapophysis anteriorly and the postzygapophysis posteriorly. The thick neural spine extends anteroposteriorly with a mild anterior transverse expansion but flares posteriorly where the postzygapophysis meets the spine on either side. In Scelidosaurus (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a), the anterior transverse expansion is much more prominent than in Yuxisaurus, whereas in the ankylosaur Sauropelta (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003) and the stegosaur Stegosaurus (NHMUK PV R36730; Maidment et al., 2015), this expansion appears to be mild. In lateral view, the dorsal margin of the axial neural spine is sinusoidal with a central apex, an anterior portion that slopes ventrally and that is nearly straight, and a posterior portion that is slightly concave (Figure 8A and C), similar to that of Sauropelta (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003) and Stegosaurus (NHMUK PV R36730; Maidment et al., 2015). In contrast, the dorsal margin of the axial neural spine is convex in Lesothosaurus (NHMUK PV R11004; Baron et al., 2017b) and straight in Scelidosaurus (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a) and Scutellosaurus (Breeden et al., 2021). Both the anterior and posterior ends of the neural spine overhang the articular surfaces slightly in lateral view, as seen also in Lesothosaurus (NHMUK PV R11004; Baron et al., 2017b) and some ankylosaurs (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003). By contrast, in Scelidosaurus the posterior end of the neural spine extends much farther than the posterior articular surface (NHMUK PV R1111; Norman, 2020a). Posteriorly, a deep, oval postspinal fossa is present, as also occurs in Scelidosaurus and Stegosaurus (NHMUK PV R1111, NHMUK PV R36730; Maidment et al., 2015; Norman, 2020a).\n\nThe third cervical vertebra is similar in size to the axis. The centrum is spool-shaped and constricted in the middle (Figure 8D). Its ventral surface possesses a rounded ridge that extends anteroposteriorly, contrasting with the presence of a keel in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a) and Scutellosaurus (Breeden and Rowe, 2020; Breeden et al., 2021). In lateral view, the centrum is relatively short and subquadrate in outline (Figure 8A and C), with a length to posterior height ratio of approximately 1.4, similar to the condition in some ankylosaurs (Maleev, 1956; Kilbourne and Carpenter, 2005), but contrasting with the more elongate cervicals present in Scelidosaurus (~1.7; Norman, 2020a), Scutellosaurus (~2.1; Breeden and Rowe, 2020), and some stegosaurs (NHMUK PV R36730; Maidment et al., 2015). The parapophysis is not as prominent as that on the axis, and is a rounded process occupying the anterior corner of the lateral surface, posterior to which the lateral surface of the centrum is depressed. The right diapophysis curves ventrolaterally and its distal end is crescentic with a flat dorsal surface and a convex ventral margin, as in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a). The prezygapophyses extend anterodorsally beyond the centrum anterior margin. The postzygapophyses project posterodorsally and somewhat laterally, terminating flush with the posterior margin of the centrum, and their articular facets face ventrolaterally. The dorsal surface of the postzygapophysis bears a rugose ridge that expands transversely as it extends posteriorly, as also occurs in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a). The neural spine is damaged, but it appears to have expanded strongly posteriorly to overhang the posterior margin of the centrum (Figure 8A–C). This feature is absent in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a), in which the neural spine terminates more anteriorly, but is present in some cervicals of Scutellosaurus (Breeden and Rowe, 2020). A postspinal fossa is present but is smaller than that of the axis.\n\nThe fourth cervical centrum is similar to that of the preceding vertebra, both in overall morphology and proportions (Figure 8A–D). The lateral surface posterior to the parapophysis bears the shallowest excavation of the four preserved cervicals. The posterior articular surface has a crescentic outline, with a flat upper margin and ventral convex margin, and its center is occupied by a semilunate concavity (Figure 8E). The parapophysis is cylindrical in outline, differing from those of the axis and third cervical, which have subtriangular and rounded outlines, respectively. The transverse process extends ventrolaterally and has an elliptical cross-section (Figure 8A–D). The prezygapophysis projects anterodorsally to a point almost halfway along the preceding cervical centrum (Figure 8A), contrasting with the shorter processes present in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a), Scutellosaurus (Breeden and Rowe, 2020; Breeden et al., 2021), and Stegosaurus (Maidment et al., 2015), but it is unclear if this has been altered taphonomically. A postspinal fossa is present, but is the smallest found in the preserved cervicals. The large neural canal is rounded in outline (Figure 8E).\n\nA cervical rib articulates with the parapophysis of the right axis and, partly, with the posterior surface of the atlas via its expanded single head. Its elongate shaft extends posterodorsally at an angle of 32° from the horizontal with a gentle curvature (Figure 8C), almost reaching the middle of the third cervical with a total length of about 75 mm. By contrast, the axial ribs of Scelidosaurus are relatively shorter (Norman, 2020a), but they are unknown in other early thyreophoran taxa. In Yuxisaurus, the rib shaft is transversely compressed and tapers distally, but that of Scelidosaurus is more rod-like (Norman, 2020a) but this difference could reflect taphonomic compression. The lateral surface of the rib shaft is generally flat, but is slightly depressed anteriorly, and is separated from the head by a shallow break-in-slope in lateral view. By contrast, the axial rib of Scelidosaurus bears a lateral ridge along the shaft (Norman, 2020a). Another 26-mm-long rib fragment is attached to the lateroventral surface of the axis.\n\nFive isolated dorsal vertebrae of varying preservation are present (Figure 9) and are labeled as D1–D5 for convenience. They are generally similar to those of a range of thyreophoran taxa, including Scelidosaurus and ankylosaurs (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003; Norman, 2020a), although they lack the extreme neural arch elongation of stegosaurs (Galton, 2004).\n\n‘D1’ preserves the centrum and the bases of the neural arch pedicles only (Figure 9A–E). Its anterior articular surface is concave (Figure 9C) while the posterior articular surface is flat but possesses a rounded fossa in the center (Figure 9D). Both articular surfaces are subcircular in outline. The centrum has a subquadrate outline in lateral view (Figure 9A), is spool-shaped in ventral view, and lacks a ventral keel (Figure 9E).\n\nThe centrum of ‘D2’ is spool-shaped with a ventral margin that is gently arched in lateral view (Figure 9F–J). The ventral surface is rounded and lacks a keel (Figure 9J). Both articular surfaces are subcircular in outline but with a slightly flattened dorsal margin (Figure 9H1). The anterior articular surface appears to be more dorsoventrally compressed than the posterior one. The anterior articular surface is concave, while the posterior surface is nearly flat with its center occupied by a distinct concavity. A partial neural arch is present. The parapophysis is positioned level with the dorsal part of the neural canal and is an expanded oval facet that is situated close to the anterior rim of the centrum in lateral view (Figure 9F). Its diapophysis is stout and projects laterodorsally at an angle of ~33° above the horizontal. Its dorsal surface is generally flat with a gentle swelling in the middle. Although broken, the neural spine appears to have been low, with a transverse expansion anteriorly, and is nearly level with the diapophysis in height in lateral view (Figure 9F). The neural canal is ovoid in outline and dorsoventrally elongated (Figure 9H1). All of the zygapophyses are missing, but a broad infrapostzygapophyseal fossa is present (Figure 9F).\n\n‘D3’ has an amphicoelous, spool-shaped centrum (Figure 9K–O). In lateral view its ventral margin is more arched than that of ‘D2’ (Figure 9K), and its ventral surface is constricted into a keel (Figure 9O). The left lateral surface bears an anteroposteriorly elongated depression on its dorsal part, but this is absent on the right-hand side. A partial neural arch is present. The remaining portion of the left diapophysis is horizontally inclined and has a flat dorsal surface. The neural spine is thickened mediolaterally, with a transverse width of 16 mm in the middle, which is significantly greater than that of ‘D2’ (4 mm). The thickened neural spine and horizontal transverse process suggest that this is most likely a posterior dorsal vertebra (Norman, 2020a). The prezygapophysis curves anterodorsally from the base of the neural spine, overhanging the anterior margin of the centrum (Figure 9K). Its articular facet was probably directed dorsally but is concealed by an adhered fragment of the preceding postzygapophysis. In anterior view, the infraprezygapophyseal surface is broadly concave (Figure 9M). The postzygapophyseal fragment of the preceding vertebra is massive, extending across the vertebral midline, suggesting that the postzygapophysis fused with its counterpart in the posterior dorsal series.\n\n‘D4’ consists of a centrum and partial neural arch lacking processes (Figure 9P–T). The centrum is slightly longer than that of ‘D3’ , but its morphology is generally similar, including the presence of a ventral keel (Figure 9T). Its right lateral surface bears a shallow, elongate depression, but this is absent on the left. The remnant of the left parapophysis indicates that it was positioned high on the neural arch, immediately above the neural canal. Viewed anteriorly both of the neural arch pedicles are stout and have lateral margins that curve dorsally and then laterally as also occurs in ‘D2’ and ‘D3’ (Figure 9R).\n\n‘D5’ consists only of the centrum and the broken bases of the neural arch pedicles (Figure 9U–Y). It is generally similar to the other dorsal vertebrae and is of equal length to ‘D4,’ although its concave lateral surfaces are smooth and lack depressions. The ventral margin of the centrum is only slightly concave in lateral view, and in ventral view, the keel is less prominent than that of ‘D4’ (Figure 9Y). The presence of ventral keels in posterior dorsal vertebrae contrasts with their absence in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a) and Stegosaurus (Maidment et al., 2015), although some ankylosaurs have keeled posterior dorsal centra (Kirkland and Carpenter, 1994; Kirkland et al., 2013).\n\nThe right humerus is well preserved, except for a small section of the distal end (Figure 11). It has an elongate, slender shaft, with a diameter of ~50 mm, which separates the proximal and distal expansions, which reach maximum widths of ~160 mm and 120 mm, respectively (Figure 11A and C). Both of these expansions are relatively broader than in either Scutellosaurus (Colbert, 1981; Breeden and Rowe, 2020; Breeden et al., 2021) or Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a), giving the humerus of Yuxisaurus a stockier appearance that is much more similar to those of ankylosaurs and stegosaurs (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003; Galton, 2004).\n\nIn anterior view, the humerus is straight, with the shaft lacking any significant deflection, and has a total length of ~345 mm (Figure 11A). A robust deltopectoral crest arises from the lateral margin of the proximal expansion and curves anteriorly and slightly medially, terminating in a thickened, transversely expanded distal end (35 mm in thickness). The deltopectoral crest extends to a point ~46% of the humeral length (Figure 11A). This is similar to the conditions present in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a) and some ankylosaurs (e.g., Pawpawsaurus, Europelta: Lee, 1996; Kirkland et al., 2013), but differs from those of other ankylosaurs (e.g., Pinacosaurus, Saichania), where this crest terminates more distally (Maryanska, 1977; Godefroit et al., 1999), and Scutellosaurus, where it ends more proximally (Breeden et al., 2021). The proximal anterior surface is strongly concave. In anterior view, the internal tuberosity has a straight, steeply inclined dorsomedial margin, which meets its curved ventromedial margin at an angle of ~110°. In proximal view, the internal tuberosity is anteroposteriorly expanded and is separated from the humeral head by a distinct notch dorsally (Figure 11E). This notch is absent in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a) and Scutellosaurus (Breeden and Rowe, 2020; Breeden et al., 2021), but is present in some ankylosaurians (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003). The humeral head is subspherical, protrudes posteriorly and somewhat anteriorly with respect to the rest of the proximal end, and its posterior end curves posterolaterally, forming a triangular process (Figure 11E). This process partially encloses a posterolateral concavity, which is present in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a) and Europelta (Kirkland et al., 2013) but not Stegosaurus (Maidment et al., 2015) or Scutellosaurus (Breeden et al., 2021). In posterior view, the proximal surface is convex, and a broad swelling arises from the base of the humeral head that extends ventrally for a short distance (Figure 11C). On the posterior surface of the deltopectoral crest, there is a large triceps tubercle, which is obliquely oriented and has a sharp, pointed apex (Figure 11B). This tubercle is present in various ankylosaurs, such as Gastonia and Gargoyleosaurus, and is supposedly homologous with a pocket-like muscle scar present in Scelidosaurus (Norman, 2020a), but is absent in Lesothosaurus (Baron et al., 2017b) and Scutellosaurus (Colbert, 1981; Breeden et al., 2021).\n\nThe shaft has a subtriangular cross-section in its mid-part, with a flat anterior surface and convex posterior surface. Distally, the medial (ulnar) condyle extends further ventrally than the lateral condyle and also exhibits greater anteroposterior expansion. A broad, shallow, ‘U’-shaped fossa is positioned immediately dorsal to the distal condyles on the anterior surface (Figure 11A), which differs from the longer, narrower, ‘V’-shaped and shallower fossa seen in other early thyreophorans (Breeden and Rowe, 2020; Norman, 2020a; Breeden et al., 2021) and stegosaurs (Maidment et al., 2015), although a similar fossa occurs in some ankylosaurs (Vickaryous and Russell, 2003). A narrow, vertical depression separates the two condyles on the posterior surface (Figure 11C). In ventral view, the distal end has a dumbbell-shaped outline, though the ulnar condyle is more strongly expanded anteroposteriorly than the radial condyle (Figure 11F).\n\nSeven compound osteoderms are preserved. Two of these consist of three elements (tripartite osteoderms) and the remaining five consist of two elements (bipartite osteoderms) (Figure 13). In all of these compound structures, the individual osteoderms are fused indistinguishably and it is likely that other co-ossified osteoderms were originally attached to some of these structures but were not preserved.\n\nThe two tripartite osteoderms (referred to hereafter as TPO 1 and 2) are similar in size and shape and mirror each other anatomically (Figure 13A–F). Each is composed of a blade-like lateral spine, a stouter, intermediate spine, and a conical medial osteoderm. In TPO 1 (Figure 13A–C), which is interpreted as from the right-hand side of the body, the base of the lateral spine is anteroposteriorly wide (128 mm) but thins dorsoventrally (45 mm). This spine extends laterally and its anterior and posterior margins are sharp. The straight anterior margin is inclined posteriorly while its posterior margin is slightly convex. Although the apex is missing, it seems reasonable to assume that the two edges converged to a point apically. Its lateral surface is swollen laterally in its central part. Four parallel ridges and the grooves between them extend on to the lateral surface from the base: however, these features are absent in TPO 2, which suggests that they might be due to accidental over-preparation. The intermediate spine of TPO 1 is directed dorsoventrally. It has a suboval base, which is anteroposteriorly elongated (108 mm) but transversely narrow (78 mm), and that is tall dorsoventrally (107 mm). In TPO 1, the anterior margin of the intermediate spine is long and convex, but in TPO 2 (inferred to be from the right-hand side; Figure 13D–F), this margin is divided into two straight edges. In both specimens, the posterior margins of these spines are deflected, and are consistently shorter than the anterior margins: as a result, the dorsal apex is posteriorly displaced relative to the base. Their lateral surfaces are concave and smooth, lacking foramina or grooves, and bear a central swelling, which is vertically directed, on either side. In both TPO 1 and 2, the medial-most osteoderm is the smallest of the three (Figure 13A, C, D and F). It is similar to the others, and in TPO 1 has an anteroposteriorly elongated (62 mm) but transversely narrow (40 mm) base. Nevertheless, the spine is more conical in shape with a smooth rounded lateral surface. It has a posteriorly displaced dorsal apex, which is almost flush with the posterior margin of the base. Its dorsal end bears a small protrusion.\n\nIn anterior or posterior views, the conjoined ventral surface of each tripartite structure is arched (Figure 13A, C, D and F), presumably corresponding to the neck shape of Yuxisaurus. Co-ossified cervical half-rings are present only in Scelidosaurus and ankylosaurians among Thyreophora (e.g., Carpenter, 2001; Norman, 2021), and vary in terms of the number of osteoderms included and their individual morphology (e.g., Blows, 2001). The partial cervical half-rings of Yuxisaurus are not fused to any other half-rings and closely resemble the third cervical half-ring of Scelidosaurus, as well as those of Gargoyleosaurus, Sauropelta, Silvisaurus, Gastonia, Stegopelta, and Ankylosaurus (Carpenter, 1984; Ford, 2000; Kinneer et al., 2016; Norman, 2020b). The external surfaces of the cervical osteoderms are generally smooth, similar to those of the ankylosaurians Gastonia and Silvisaurus (Eaton, 1960; Kinneer et al., 2016), whereas they are pitted or vascularized in the early branching thyreophorans Scutellosaurus and Scelidosaurus, and in most ankylosaurians, such as Mymoorapelta, Edmontonia, Europelta, Saichania, and Pinacosaurus (Maryanska, 1977; Kirkland and Carpenter, 1994; Kirkland et al., 2013; Burns and Currie, 2014; Breeden and Rowe, 2020; Norman, 2020b; Breeden et al., 2021).\n\nThe first bipartite osteoderm (termed ‘BPO 1’ hereafter) is composed of two spines (Figure 13G–I). These are similar in morphology, with an elongated oval base, a blade-like body and a convex dorsal end (Figure 13G). BPO 1 is inferred to be from the left side of the body when the spine apices are posteriorly placed relative to their base. The lateral spine curves dorsolaterally with a concave medial surface and convex lateral surface; the medial spine is straight with the lateral and medial surfaces nearly symmetrical to each other. The spine margins are somewhat convex, except that the posterior edge of the medial spine is straight. In posterior view, the lateral spine diverges from the medial spine at an angle of 45°. In dorsal view (Figure 13H), the lateral spine is more posteriorly placed than the medial spine, and the junction slightly narrows anteroposteriorly, leaving a broad concavity anteriorly and a narrow one posteriorly. Consequently, the lateral spine appears to contact the posterolateral portion of the medial spine. The ventral surface of the medial spine bears a curved ventromedial expansion, rendering its ventral surface concave. This expansion also extends anteriorly for a short distance.\n\nThe second bipartite osteoderm, BPO 2, has a similar configuration but is from the right-hand side of the body (Figure 13J–L). Compared to BPO 1, the medial spine is more robust (Figure 13J). This spine has a wide base and its distal end curves somewhat medially. The lateral spine diverges from the medial spine at an angle of 70° when the medial spine is vertically positioned. The surfaces of BPO 2 are not as smooth as those of BPO 1: grooves are present on the lateral surface of the lateral spine; the medial spine is medially pitted at the base; and the conjoined ventral surface is ornamented with striations. The junction between the individual osteoderms has suffered severe damage, leaving a large fissure.\n\nA pair of symmetrical bipartite osteoderms, BPO 3 (Figure 13M–O) and BPO 4 (Figure 13P–R), are similar in size and appearance. Each is composed of two spines of distinct sizes. In both specimens, the larger spine is oval-based, has a nearly flat medial surface and a dorsoventrally concave but anteroposteriorly convex lateral surface. Both its anterior and posterior edges are curved and converge dorsally into a pointed apex. By contrast, the smaller spine has straight anterior and concave posterior margins that are both sharp, which terminate dorsally in a rounded apex. Its lateral surface is flat and the medial surface is convex. In dorsal view, the junction between the two osteoderms has a broad anterior concavity but an obtuse angle posteriorly, and unlike the condition in BPO 1, the lateral spine contacts the anterolateral corner of the medial spine. The co-ossified ventral surface is smooth and concave.\n\nThe fifth bipartite osteoderm (BPO 5) consists of a spine and a plate (Figure 13S-U). The spine has a long sharp edge, which extends obliquely and dorsally from the base, opposite to which is a short, blunt, vertical margin. Its lateral surfaces are strongly convex. The plate is generally flat dorsally, but half of it curves ventrally to meet, and project slightly beyond, the ventral margin of the spine. A gradual widening trough, which parallels part of the lateral surface, crosses the plate’s dorsal surface and extends ventrally next to the spine along the curved half surface. The plate contacts the spine at the front of the short edge. The conjoined ventral surface is severely damaged.\n\nTo our knowledge, asymmetrical co-ossified bipartite osteoderms are present in the cervical armor of Scelidosaurus, Hungarosaurus, and Struthiosaurus (Bunzel, 1871; Seeley, 1881; Pereda-Suberbiola and Galton, 2001; Ősi, 2005; Ősi et al., 2019; Norman, 2020b), the lateral pectoral armor of Edmontonia and in a possible Early Jurassic ankylosaur from India (Ford, 2000; Galton, 2019). Therefore, these bipartite osteoderms were most likely from the cervical or pectoral region.\n\nIt seems likely that two isolated blade-like spines are also from the cervical region. These spines have an elongated oval base, so that the body and base are both narrow (Figure 13V and W). They both have a long convex edge and a short concave edge, so that the dorsal apex projects beyond the level of the base. The ventral half of the convex edge is nearly straight, then curves posterodorsally and continues dorsally with a mild curvature. The dorsal end is sharp on one spine but rounded on the other slightly larger one. Each spine has a depressed medial surface and a slightly convex lateral surface, although the larger spine (Figure 13V) bears a vertical depression on the convex surface close to its longest margin. The ventral surface is depressed but also bears an anteroventral expansion as in BPO 1 and BPO 2. These two spines are similar in appearance to the cervical spines of Polacanthus and the caudal plates of Mymoorapelta (Kirkland and Carpenter, 1994; Blows and Honeysett, 2014). However, the caudal plates are hollowed ventrally in Mymoorapelta; consequently, these spines are most likely from the cervical region of Yuxisaurus.\n\nOther osteoderms\n\nMost other individual osteoderms are similar (Figure 14). They are oval-based, with a convex or slightly concave longest margin and a vertical or slightly concave short margin. These margins converge dorsally into an apex. Therefore, the body appears to be curved in osteoderms with a concave short margin, but straight in those with a vertical short margin. The longest margin is generally sharp whereas the shorter margin is rounded in some cases, although occasionally both margins are rounded. Ventrally they are generally flat but sometimes convex, with the ventral margins somewhat everted. The lateral surfaces are depressed, but generally bear a vertical swelling in their centers. It is noteworthy that 15 of the 120 osteoderms have a foramen or are excavated ventrally. Where present the foramina have rounded outlines and are usually small relative to the ventral surface area, but they appear to open out and expand into cavities within the osteoderm. By contrast, the ventral excavations are fully open, creating an osteoderm inner surface. Generally, the osteoderms with a solid ventral surface are smaller in size than those with a hollow base. The largest hollow-based osteoderm is damaged but was at least 160-mm long, 150-mm wide, and 110-mm tall (Figure 14A–D). With reference to Scelidosaurus, the relatively large hollow-based osteoderms probably formed the primary rows across the dorsolateral body surface or the caudal region, while other smaller osteoderms would have been interspersed among them (Norman, 2020b).\n\nA unique ‘pup tent’-shaped osteoderm is approximately 126-mm long and 94-mm tall but lacks anterior and posterior walls (Figure 15). It is triangular in cross-section and strongly excavated ventrally with a dorsal acute angle on one surface but rounded on the other side. Although weathered, the two buttresses are generally straight and divergent at an angle of ~48°. The outline between the buttresses resembles the overline outline of the osteoderm in both anterior and posterior views, and the external and inner surfaces are smooth and slightly depressed (Figure 15). In dorsal view, the roof is somewhat curved and the rounded end transversely expands more than the acute side. Viewed laterally, the dorsal roof is nearly straight, overhanging the ventral end on both sides. This osteoderm appears to be similar to an anterior median caudal scute referred to Scelidosaurus from Arizona, USA (Padian, 1989), and we propose that, in life, it was probably situated on the midline of the posterior part of the body of Yuxisaurus. Alternatively, this unusual morphology might represent a pathology."
