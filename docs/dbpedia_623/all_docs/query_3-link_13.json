        "text": "By Jack Wood\n\nEtymology: Shield of Glyptodon\n\nFirst Described By: Ford, 2000\n\nClassification: Dinosauromorpha, Dinosauriformes, Dracohors, Dinosauria, Ornithischia, Genasauria, Thyreophora, Eurypoda, Ankylosauria, Nodosauridae\n\nStatus: Extinct\n\nTime and Place: About 68 million years ago, in the Maastrichtian of the Late Cretaceous\n\nGlyptodontopelta is known from the Naashoibito Member of the Ojo Alamo Formation in New Mexico\n\nPhysical Description: Glyptodontopelta is not a particularly well-known ankylosaur, being only known from fragments of body armor. Like (most) other ankylosaurs, it would have probably been fairly squat and wide, not built for fast movement. Like other Nodosaurs, it would have had a flexible tail, with no tail club; and spikes on its shoulders. Its head would have been armored,a nd it would have had osteoderms (armor on the back grown directly from bone) all over its back. The osteoderms are fossilized, and what we know of them indicates they have furrows going away from the center of the body, and they featured pores and pits randomly spaced over its body.\n\nDiet: Like other Ankylosaurs, Glyptodontopelta would have primarily fed upon low-growing foliage, as a low-level browser.\n\nBehavior: Glyptodontopelta was actually quite common in its environment, and as such it possibly lived in social groups, meandering together across the plains for plants such as ferns and shrubs. The spikes on its shoulders – while sharp – would have been used for display to one another, with bigger spikes indicating a more “fit” individual. They may have crouched against the ground in an attempt to protect the softer parts of their bodies from predators, leaving only the armor on top exposed to danger. They also probably had more narrow mouths, to pick out very specific bits of foliage from the environment to eat; rather than a wider, more generalist mouth. They also would have found most of their food with an excellent sense of smell, and used long, flexible tongues to grab plants from hard to reach places. As a dinosaur, Glyptodontopelta would have taken care of its young – called Scutelings!\n\nEcosystem: The Naashoibito ecosystem is the last known environment from a notable series of environments in New Mexico from the Cretaceous; before it are things such as the Kirtland Formation and the Fruitland Formation. These showcase a familiar – but different – sort of Late Cretaceous North America than we are usually used to. While it features the usual hadrosaurs and ankylosaurs, it also has sauropods, and everything is quite distinct – an indication of the crossing over of South American and North Ameircan faunas, and the unique habitat present at the time. This environment is directly followed in the fossil record by a Cenozoic one – ending our look into this distinctive Late Cretaceous ecosystem turnover. This was a very sandy floodplain, frequently arid and with distinctive dry and wet seasons. This environment was very different from contemporary places like the Hell Creek which – while seasonal in a similar way – was significantly cooler in temperature. Here, Glyptodontopelta lived alongside dinosaurs such as the very large titanosaur Alamosaurus, hadrosaurs like Hypacrosaurus, ceratopsians like Ojoceratops and Torosaurus, the chickenparrot Ojoraptorsaurus, the raptor Richardoestesia, and possibly Tyrannosaurus rex, which would have been the main predator of Glyptodontopelta.\n\nOther: Glyptodontopelta, being so poorly known, has been examined thoroughly to see if it counts as its own dinosaur; for now, the consensus says yes, primarily due to the differences in its armor.\n\n~ By Meig Dickson\n\nSources under the Cut\n\nContinue reading “Glyptodontopelta mimus” →\n\nBy Jack Wood\n\nEtymology: Brainy One\n\nFirst Described By: Maryanska, 1977\n\nClassification: Dinosauromorpha, Dinosauriformes, Dracohors, Dinosauria, Ornithischia, Genasauria, Thyreophora, Eurypoda, Ankylosauria, Ankylosauridae, Ankylosaurinae, Saichania + Zaraapelta Clade\n\nStatus: Extinct\n\nTime and Place: Between 71 and 70 million years ago, in the Maastrichtian of the Late Cretaceous\n\nTarchia is known from the Khulsan member of the Barun Goyot Formation, as well as potentially the Nemegt Formation, of Ömnögovi, Mongolia\n\nPhysical Description: Tarchia is a type of Ankylosaur, specifically the group with short snouts and the ability to live in the tough and dry desert. Tarchia is known from several specimens, indicating it was about 4.5 meters long, and it had a lot of ornamentation on its head. It had a wider beak than its relatives, and rows of bumps going up from the beak to the back of the head, ending in a bony plate at the back of the head. INterestingly enough, it also has little spikes coming off of its head, and bigger spikes on its cheeks. It has a larger brain than its relatives, making it one of the smarter Ankylosaurs. It doesn’t have small bony plates behind its eyes like its relatives, however. It had a long tongue and armored nostrils, with extensive passageways for its nasal airways. Grooves run along its horns, as well, giving them a distinctive look.\n\nLittle is known of the rest of its skeleton, but presumably Tarchia was covered in rows of boney bumps along its back. It would have had a long and stiffened tail, still with armor across it, ending in a large round club. It would have had short, squat legs, and a very wide body; it probably would have been only scaly and bumpy, without any protofeathers.\n\nBy Nobu Tamura, CC BY 3.0\n\nDiet: Tarchia would have been an herbivore, primarily of very tough and dry desert vegetation at a low browsing level.\n\nBehavior: Tarchia was one of many ankylosaurs living side by side in a desert – scrubland environment, adapted excellently for finding plant material and chewing on it. Their top-notch sense of smell allowed them to find plants, even when there were none for miles; their long tongues could grab food that was harder to reach, while their wide beaks means they could just mow down rows of tough vegetation with ease. They protected their heads with extensive armor, that differed from species to species – allowing for it to help in species recognition, on top of everything else.\n\nTarchia probably would fight other members of its species with its tail clubs, smashing them together against each others’ side to compete for food and mates in their environment. They would have blended in with the vegetation, using camouflage to avoid predators; when predators did find them, their armor and clubs would have aided in protecting them from the threat.\n\nIt’s uncertain whether or not Tarchia would have lived in social groups; that being said, it probably would have taken care of its young – dubbed Scutelings – for at least a little while. It wouldn’t have moved particularly fast, but ambled along slowly through the scrubland.\n\nBy José Carlos Cortés\n\nEcosystem: Tarchia is known from two separate ecosystems – the desert/scrub forest of the Barun Goyot, and possibly then the slightly wetter Nemegt Formation. It is telling that it began to disappear as the environment got wetter – and its high adaptation for dry vegetation began to disappear. Since its presence in the Nemegt is more suspect (and largely dependent on whether or not it is synonymous with another dinosaur), we shall focus on the Barun Goyot in this article. The Barun Goyot was a transition, from a more desert environment of the Djadokhta, to a scrubland, which would then transition right on into the swamp forest of the Nemegt. This means Tarchia was surrounded mainly by bushes, conifers, and the like.\n\nMany other dinosaurs lived in the Khulsan environment, including its close relative Saichania! There was also the pachycephalosaur Tylocephale, the Protoceratopsid Bagaceratops, the Alvarezsaur Parvicursor, the Oviraptorosaur Avimimus, the Opposite Bird Gobipteryx, a potential Tyrannosaur, a potential Velociraptorine, and possibly even a titanosaur. There were many lizards there, like the very large Estesia, the monitor lizared Ovoo, and the Monstersaur Gobiderma. There were many mammals as well – the marsupial relatives Asiatherium and Deltatheridium, the placental relatives Asiorcytes, Barunlestes, and Zofialestes, and the weird multituberculates Nemegtbaatar, Catopsbaatar, and Chulsanbaatar.\n\nOther: Tarchia may be synonymous with another dinosaur called Minotaursosaurus. It is a member of a group of specialized Ankylosaurs that were highly adapted for desert life, along with Zaarapelta and Saichania.\n\n~ By Meig Dickson\n\nSources under the Cut\n\nContinue reading “Tarchia kielanae” →\n\nBy Jack Wood\n\nEtymology: Roofed Shield\n\nFirst Described By: Williston, 1905\n\nClassification: Dinosauromorpha, Dinosauriformes, Dracohors, Dinosauria, Ornithischia, Genasauria, Thyreophora, Eurypoda, Ankylosauria, Nodosauridae\n\nStatus: Extinct\n\nTime and Place: Between 100 and 97 million years ago, in the Cenomanian age of the Late Cretaceous\n\nStegopelta is only known from the Belle Fourche Member of the Frontier Formation in Wyoming\n\nPhysical Description: Stegopelta is a Nodosaur, a sort of armored dinosaur that specialized in fancy spikes and other kinds of osteoderms (aka, external armor growing from bone in the skeleton) on their bodies, in addition to very narrow snouts for selective foraging. Stegopelta itself, however, is not known from a lot of fossil material – namely, some fragments of the jaw, vertebrae, hips, and limbs, as well as some armor from the back and some teeth. These fossils were damaged, too, due to exposure to erosion and being walked on by cattle. The most we can say about it compared to other nodosaurs is that it had distinct armor patterns on its back, including a fused region over its hips and spines on the shoulders that were split, but even that is mostly small details of difference. It would have been short and squat, with a long flexible tail and short neck.\n\nDiet: As a nodosaur, Stegopelta would have been a specialized forager, using its narrow beak to grab only the plants it wanted to; it would have been a low-level browser, given its height.\n\nBehavior: Little can really be said about the behavior of Stegopelta given its lack of good remains. However, it would have probably been a fairly slow-moving animal, ambling along in its environment and searching for food. As such, its main defense against predators would have been its armor along its back and tail. It would have spent a good portion of its day eating, as well, searching for the food it wanted amongst the leaves and foliage. It’s possible it may have associated with large herds of ornithopods, but without fossils of ornithopods found with it, that’s difficult to say for sure.\n\nEcosystem: Stegopelta was found in an ocean formation, indicating that its body washed out to sea; it’s possible, thus, that Stegopelta itself lived near the beach ecosystem.\n\nOther: The original fossil was found before ankylosaurs were really known, so the original describer thought it was like a combination between Stegosaurus and Glyptodon!\n\n~ By Meig Dickson\n\nSources\n\nCarpenter, K., J.

These teeth, like many of Ornithischian dinosaurs, were roughly leaf-shaped, used for slicing up plant material. There might also be a tibia known, which is quite robust, but that is rather dubious. The robustness of the tibia makes sense, as Ankylosaurs such as Priconodon are true heavyweights.\n\nAs an Ankylosaur, Priconodon would have been a large quadrupedal herbivore, with extensive armor on its back. It wouldn’t have had a club tail, but rather more ornamentation in its spikes and other osteoderms on its back and shoulders. The tail would have been quite flexible instead. It would have had a small head, with a narrow snout for selectively feeding on certain plants. It also would have had a very wide torso, and most likely short and robust limbs.\n\nDiet: Low-level selective browser\n\nBehavior: Priconodon would have probably been mostly a loner, spending its time wandering about its ecosystem looking for sources of green food, probably softer plant material. Ankylosaurs are not known for their probable socialness, but it’s likely that Priconodon would have taken care of its young like other dinosaurs. It’s even possible that Priconodon, like other Nodosaurids, would have stuck with herds of large herbivores for protection.\n\nEcosystem: The Arundel Clay was a swamp ecosystem right near the coast of the burgeoning Atlantic Ocean, filled with cycads, ferns, and aquatic plants. There were a lot of different types of fish, including sharks, in this area, along with many early turtles. There were also indeterminant crocodilians and a few mammals such as Argillomys. As for dinosaurs, there was the large sauropod Astrodon, possibly an ornithopod such as Tenontosaurus, a possible raptor, and the crappy “Capitalsaurus”.\n\nOther: Priconodon was originally thought to be a Stegosaur, since Ankylosaurs were not really known during the 1800s, until it was reexamined in the 70s.\n\n~ By Meig Dickson\n\nSources\n\nCarpenter, K., J.

American Journal of Science 35:89-94\n\nBy Jack Wood\n\nEtymology: Reptile Shield\n\nFirst Described By: Ostrom, 1970\n\nClassification: Dinosauromorpha, Dinosauriformes, Dracohors, Dinosauria, Ornithischia, Genasauria, Thyreophora, Eurypoda, Ankylosauria, Nodosauridae, Nodosaurinae\n\nStatus: Extinct\n\nTime and Place: Sauropelta lived between 115 and 105 million years ago, from the Aptian to the Albian ages of the Early Cretaceous\n\nSauropelta is known entirely from the Cloverly Formation of Montana and Wyoming, specifically the Himes and Little Sheep Mudstone Members\n\nPhysical Description: Sauropelta is a Nodosaurid, a kind of armored dinosaur that featured extensive spikes and other ornaments on their bodies for sexual display. It’s also one of the better known ones, due to its fairly impressive shoulder spikes. While we know the basic structure of this armor due to its bone base, relatives of Sauropelta have helped to indicate that keratin – the same material as hair and nails – probably covered these spikes and made them even longer. This made Sauropelta and animals like it impressive to look at, with increasingly ridiculous spikes and ornaments.\n\nBy Dino Guy 2, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nSauropelta itself was about 5. 2 meters long, making it fairly average size for a Nodosaurid. It was heavily built and squat in size, giving it the general appearance of a tent. It had a triangle shaped head, with a narrow tapering snout. It had a very flat top to its head and a thick skull covered in tightly fused plates, primarily for defense. It had leaf-shaped teeth in both the lower and upper jaws, and a ridge on the inside of its mouth that supported a small beak in the front.\n\nIt had a very long tail, half the total length of the body, with bony tendons lining along it to keep it stiff. It had a very wide body, with broad hips and ribs, giving it a very round appearance when looked at head-on. It had short front limbs compared to the hind limbs, arching its back so it was highest over the hips. It had very stout feet and limbs, as well as its shoulders and pelvis, allowing for it to support a great amount of muscle mass and weight.\n\nSauropelta had rows of small domes – scutes – from the top of the neck to the back of the tail. Over the back and the tail there are small nodules, which separated the larger cone-shaped scutes in parallel rows. On the hips these nodules and scutes locked together into a shield. Sauropelta had large spines on the sides of the neck, increasing to a peak over the shoulders, and decreasing dramatically before stopping at the hips. Flat plates lined the tail on both sides, pointing out and decreasing in size towards the tail. The spines on the tail and neck were fused, reducing the amount of motion possible for both ends of the body.\n\nBy Emily Willoughby, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nDiet: The small, pointed head of Sauropelta means it was a selective browser, eating very specific plant material while foraging rather than indiscriminately eating whatever plants it wanted. It would have been a low-level browser as well, given its short height and limited range of motion in the neck. So, it probably specialized in eating berries; leaves from ferns, conifers, and cycads; and other small bits of vegetation close to the ground or fallen on the ground.\n\nBehavior: Sauropelta is a fairly common animal from its environment and possibly lived in somewhat social groups, either with a few members or many in mixed-species herds, as many other plant eating dinosaurs lived in the same location and may have associated together. It would have been somewhat slow given its squat limb proportions, as opposed to other Nodosaurids such as Hungarosaurus which specialized in quick movements and rapid turns. As such, Sauropelta would have primarily utilized its extensive armor across its back, hips, neck, and head for defense, and may have squatted down against the ground to protect its softer underbelly from attack from predators. This could also have been helped with counter-shading, as found in a close relative Sauropelta. Counter-shading is the use of natural lighting in conjunction with the color of an animal to help disguise it and hide it in the environment, and it is known in Borealopelta, another Nodosaurid; thus, it’s possible that the same would have been found in Sauropelta, or, at least, that Sauropelta would also have been a prey species that needed to hide from predators in its environment. Thus, since Sauropelta didn’t have extensive offensive structures, it probably would have been at least somewhat more skittish than aggressive.\n\nBy José Carlos Cortés\n\nAs an Ankylosaur, Sauropelta had a long tongue that it could use to grab food and draw in plant materia, that it would snip off with its narrow beak and jaws. They could breathe while chewing, as well, and probably had a decent sense of smell to aid in seeking out the specific sorts of food it would have preferred.\n\nSauropelta would probably have taken care of its young, considering that other dinosaurs tend to do so, but there is little evidence present either way for Sauropelta.\n\nEcosystem: Sauropelta lived in the Cloverly Formation, an Early Cretaceous Western North America ecosystem that showcases the transition from the Late Jurassic to the Late Cretaceous in this region, with many of the features of the more famous Morrison and Hell Creek formations in a weird sort of blender in terms of types of dinosaurs present. This environment lay along the Western Interior Seaway as it began to grow through North America, and extensive rivers ran through the Cloverly Formation to drain into the ocean. These rivers would flood, causing mass burials of animals and leading to the fossils of the formation. The plains were mostly forested, covered in a variety of conifers and cycads. This would lead to flooding causing extensive damage to the forest ecosystem and, as such, leading to mass die-offs of animals.\n\nThis muddy environment transitioned to a more sandy environment, still with some mud, as it aged from the Little Sheep Member of the formation to the Himes Member. This reflected the growth of the seaway and the encroachment of beach sand towards the environment of Sauropelta and others. While many creatures died off in the transition, Sauropelta is present in both layers, indicating that it was fine with the new beachfront property.\n\nBy John Conway, CC BY-SA 3.0\n\nIn the earlier Little Sheep ecosystem, Sauropelta lived alongside dinosaurs such as the medium-level Ornithopod browser Tenontosaurus, the fast-moving low browser Zephyrosaurus, the ambush raptor predator Deinonychus, the Oviraptor omnivore Microvenator, and remains of large sauropods that have not yet been named. There were also non-dinosaurs such as the lungfish Ceratodus, the sharks Polyacrodus and Egertonodus, and many other bony fish, frogs, salamanders, and turtles like Glyptops. There were also mammals such as Gobiconodon, Oklatheridium, Paracimexomys, and Atokatheridium. Crocodilians and lizards were also frequenters of the environment, along with the dinosaurs.\n\nThe Himes ecosystem was somewhat different, but in many ways still quite similar to its earlier precursor. Deinonychus, Microvenator, and Tenontosaurus were still around, but there was also the very tall sauropod Sauroposeidon, a poorly known sauropod Rugocaudia, another Nodosaurid Tatankacephalus, and the large predator Acrocanthosaurus, which would definitely have been a thorn in Sauropelta’s side. There may have even been a proto-bird, but that is unconfirmed. There were lizards, frogs, salamanders, crocodilians and more basal crocodile relatives, turtles such as Naomichelys, and an extreme variety of fish and sharks. There were also mammals such as Gobiconodon, Argaliatherium, Corviconodon, Montalestes, Pappotherium, and a wide variety of others.\n\nSauropelta was an critical fixture of both of these time points, and would have been a defining sight in the Cloverly environment.\n\nOther: Sauropelta may also be known from the Cedar Mountain Formation, a similar environment to the Cloverly, but these remains are largely unconfirmed at this time.\n\n~ By Meig Dickson\n\nSources\n\nArbour, V.
