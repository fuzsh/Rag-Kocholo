        "text": "Classification: Nodosaur\n\nReview: Animantarx (Schleich)\n\n4.3 (16 votes)\n\nA great dinosaur figure is a figure I can´t take my eyes off.\n\nA great dinosaur figure is a figure I want to hold in my hand again and again, just to enjoy how it feels. The texture of the skin, ist detail, the spikes, the pose: Everything has to appeal to me surpassingly.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Borealopelta (CollectA)\n\n4.9 (23 votes)\n\nBefore we sink our teeth into a toy that is based upon one of the most exciting fossil discoveries ever made, I have a few thanks to give out. First I would like to thank CollectA for supplying this sample and its continuing support to the writers at the Dinosaur Toy Blog. I also would like to thank Suspsy, who has made this review possible.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Borealopelta (Jurassic World by Mattel)\n\n4 (44 votes)\n\nBack in 2017, one of the best preserved fossils discovered was making the rounds. It was named Borealopelta markmitchelli, “Mark Mitchell’s northern shield”, honoring the man who spent more than 7,000 hours carefully preparing the fossil material, and slowly carving it out from the rock it rested in.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Borealopelta (PNSO)\n\n4.8 (38 votes)\n\nThere are quite a number of fossils that stun the layman aswell as the professionell for their quality of preservation. Finds enclosed in Burmese amber, Chinese or German limestone come to mind, revealing large numbers of numerous species in outstanding quality. In common they have, that most of the species preserved are comparably small….\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Dino Trackers Minis (Jurassic World by Mattel)\n\n3.6 (25 votes)\n\nReview and photos by Faelrin, edited by Suspsy\n\nBeing a heavy collector of the Mattel Jurassic World line, it’s not often I give attention to their fantastic line of minis despite having collected a good portion of them ever since the line’s launch in 2018. In fact, this is probably my first review of these particular types of figures.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Dinosaur Advent Calendar 2020 (Schleich)\n\n2.6 (11 votes)\n\nWell, the holiday season is nearly upon us. No matter what this time means to you and what holiday you celebrate, it is a time to spread joy. This year certainly seems to need some, with everything that happened. It is now the time when many will choose a calendar to count down the days til the 25th.\n\nRead more\n\nAmazon ad:\n\nReview: Dinosaur Excavation no. 7 (Capsule MiniQ Museum by Kaiyodo)\n\n4.7 (18 votes)\n\nThis set of reissued figurines offers an updated, good-quality variety of animals for collectors who might have missed earlier releases.\n\nKaiyodo’s miniature dinosaur lines might be among the very best in the market, even with more and more high-end companies entering the scene in recent years. It’s a shame that acquiring Kaiyodo’s figurines hasn’t gotten any easier for collectors outside of Japan – especially in the wake of the 2020 pandemic, and the ensuing shipping bottlenecks which have only made imported goods all the more expensive.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Edmontonia (Battat)\n\n4.8 (17 votes)\n\nReview and Photos by forum member Pangolinmoth\n\nFrom the Battat line of dinosaur figures, better known as the bane of our bank accounts and the envy of our peers, comes the charming Edmontonia rugosidens. Edmontonia was a nodosaur from the late cretaceous, and quite the tank at that.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Edmontonia (CollectA)\n\n3.3 (14 votes)\n\nEdmontonia is named after the Edmonton Formation (now called the Horseshoe Canyon Formation) in which it was found. As a nodosaurid, it lacked a bony club at the end of its tail, but made up for that with its formidable array of shoulder spikes.\n\nThe CollectA Edmontonia was released back in 2010.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Edmontonia (Recur)\n\n4.2 (25 votes)\n\nThe last of the review samples sent to me by Recur is their 2015 rendition of the heavily armoured nodosaurid known as Edmontonia. Let’s see what this one has to offer, shall we?\n\nLike all Recur toys, this Edmontonia is quite large.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Edmontonia (Replica-Saurus by Schleich)\n\n4 (15 votes)\n\nThe burly, heavily armored, herbivorous nodosaur Edmontonia inhabited North America during the Late Cretaceous period some 70 million years ago. The name simply means “from Edmonton”, as the type specimen was discovered in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation near the city of Edmonton in Alberta, Canada by George Paterson in 1924.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Edmontonia (Tyco)\n\n4 (5 votes)\n\nEdmontonia is a popular genus of nodosaurid that has been produced by toy companies many times over the years. CollectA, Schleich, and Battat have all taken a crack at the beast with fairly good results. Edmontonia is a very well-known genus with articulated specimens first discovered in 1915!\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Gastonia (CollectA)\n\n4.5 (25 votes)\n\nDuring the early Cretaceous in North America around 126 million years ago, a small herbivore emerges from the trees in a wooded forest lifting its head to smell the breeze that is drifting by. It ambles into the clearing on its small legs and starts to nibble some of the vegetation at the forest edge.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Gastonia (Schleich)\n\n4 (78 votes)\n\nBefore we begin the review, I would like to extend my gratitude towards Happy Hen Toys for sending this figure along as a review sample. Happy Hen Toys is a U.S. distributor of figures by Safari, Papo, CollectA, Schleich, and other similar companies. In the case of CollectA they’re often the only place that sells their products at a reasonable price within the United States.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Hylaeosaurus (Deluxe by CollectA)\n\n2.3 (15 votes)\n\nThe English ankylosaurian Hylaeosaurus was one of the very first dinosaurs to be described, in 1832 by the great Gideon Mantell. And along with Iguanodon and Megalosaurus, it enabled Sir Richard Owen to describe the family we all know and love as Dinosauria.\n\nRead more"
