        "text": "Brand: Tyco\n\nQuick links\n\nReview: Ankylosaurus (Tyco)\n\n2.6 (10 votes)\n\nTime now to jump into the WABAC Machine and take a trip to 1988. It was a good time to be a kid or a collector. GI Joe and Transformers were still going strong, Barbie and Lego were around as always, and TMNT was taking its first steps towards iconic status.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Brontosaurus (Tyco)\n\n3.9 (8 votes)\n\nThis review marks my 100th review for the Dinosaur Toy Blog and with having reached this milestone I think I need to reflect a bit. My first review was posted on July 16th, 2011. That’s just over 5 years of collecting and writing about dinosaur toys. Although others have reached this milestone in an impressively short amount of time that makes this no less significant for me.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Deinonychus (Tyco)\n\n2.8 (6 votes)\n\nIf your average person were hard pressed to name every dinosaur that came to mind we all know the names that would crop up; Tyrannosaurus, Stegosaurus, Triceratops, and since 1993…Velociraptor. I can’t think of many genera that achieved so much fame so fast, at least not since the so called golden age of paleontology in the late 1800’s and early 1900’s when most well known dinosaurs were discovered.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Dimetrodon (Tyco)\n\n3.5 (4 votes)\n\nReview and photographs by “Paleona”\n\nAnother gem from the Tyco Smithsonian line of toys is the Dimetrodon. Everyone’s favorite synapsid features a simple, but fun action feature and a charming disposition.\n\nThis squatty little creature measures about 7.7″ (19.5cm) long and 4.5″ (11.4cm) tall.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Diplodocus (Tyco)\n\n3 (6 votes)\n\nReview and photographs by Paleona, edited by Suspsy\n\nNo childhood collection of dinosaurs is complete without a large sauropod, and Tyco’s Diplodocus certainly fit the bill during the late 80’s. Originally sold among the Dino-Riders toy line as Diplodocus, it would later be remarketed under the Smithsonian line as Apatosaurus.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Edmontonia (Tyco)\n\n4 (5 votes)\n\nEdmontonia is a popular genus of nodosaurid that has been produced by toy companies many times over the years. CollectA, Schleich, and Battat have all taken a crack at the beast with fairly good results. Edmontonia is a very well-known genus with articulated specimens first discovered in 1915!\n\nRead more\n\nAmazon ad:\n\nReview: Kentrosaurus (Tyco)\n\n4.5 (4 votes)\n\nReview and photographs by Paleona\n\nBack in the late 80’s / early 90’s, pre-Jurassic Park, the Tyco dinosaurs were among the first dinosaur action figures. Tyco first released their dinosaur toys as a Dino-Riders toy line, but the Smithsonian Institution later hired Tyco to release a museum quality line of dinosaurs and prehistoric animals under their name.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Megachoerus AKA Archaeotherium (Tyco)\n\n4.2 (5 votes)\n\nReview and photos by Archinto, edited by Suspsy\n\nHere we will be taking a look at a classic rendition of the prehistoric mammal Archaeotherium, as perceived by the Tyco company in 1990 for their awesome Dino-Riders toy line. This particular figure was released for the Ice Age sub-theme (under the subgenus Megachoerus), which also featured a motorized woolly mammoth as well as an articulated Smilodon and Megatherium.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Megatherium (Tyco)\n\n3.7 (7 votes)\n\nDino riders is a much cherished series by many, who eagerly looked to get all the figures of the line. The first two lines are large, full of various dinosaurs, while the latter two lines are smaller and often rarer than the first two. The last line featured ice age mammals, four recognisable animals from the Pleistocene (and a bit before).\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Monoclonius (Tyco)\n\n2.7 (6 votes)\n\nReview and photos by Griffin\n\nMonoclonius was always known as a sort of “little brother” to Triceratops, characterized by its short frill and singular nose horn. Sadly for it, like several other dinosaurs I remember growing up with like Trachodon and Brontosaurus, it’s no longer believed to be a valid genus of dinosaur.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Pachycephalosaurus (Tyco)\n\n3.7 (6 votes)\n\nReview and images by dinoguy2, edited by Suspsy\n\nI knew I had a box full of Dino-Riders toys somewhere, and when it was rediscovered recently I was excited to take a fresh look at some of these 1980s’ era dinosaur figures, especially those I remembered as being ahead of their time.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Placerias (Tyco)\n\n4 (9 votes)\n\nAlthough the Dino-Riders line consisted mostly of familiar faces like Stegosaurus, Triceratops, Diplodocus, and, of course, Tyrannosaurus rex, there were a few obscure animals tossed into the mix. I had never heard of Placerias until I came across it on the shelf at Toys R Us.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Protoceratops (Tyco)\n\n3.2 (5 votes)\n\nProtoceratops was a smaller more primitive ceratopsian dinosaur that lived during the late Cretaceous in what is now Mongolia. Size wise it is most commonly compared to a sheep and many fossilized specimens of this dinosaur have been discovered from tiny eggs and hatchlings all the way up to full grown adults.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Pteranodon (Tyco)\n\n2.8 (4 votes)\n\nA couple days ago I received a package in the mail. I could start off a lot of reviews this way but inside this package was something special, an old friend I hadn’t seen in over 20 years. This package might as well have been a time capsule.\n\nRead more\n\nReview: Pterodactyl (Tyco)\n\n4 (4 votes)\n\nReview and photos by Lanthanotus, edited by Suspsy\n\nSome Saturday back in the late 1980s’, my parents dragged me to a big mall (by 80’s European standards) in a nearby city to buy those things that boys age 11 or 12 like most: clothing, shoes, and such.\n\nRead more"
