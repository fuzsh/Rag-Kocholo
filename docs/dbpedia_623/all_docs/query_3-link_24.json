        "text": "On May 17, I posted a photo of the ilium of a ceratopsid dinosaur that we collected in the Upper Cretaceous Menefee Formation of New Mexico. At the time, only the medial surface of the bone was visible; however, WSC volunteer Joe Reavis has been working hard and has now prepped the lateral surface as well. On May 17, I identified the bone as a left ilium, but now that I can see the whole thing, I can say that it's actually a right ilium.This beautifully-preserved ilium is part of an incomplete skeleton that also includes vertebrae and ribs from the torso, as well as the sacrum, the series of fused vertebrae to which this ilium would have attached. Ceratopsids, the great horned dinosaurs such as Triceratops, were very abundant and diverse in western North America during the Late Cretaceous; our specimen is around 79 million years old, and we can't yet determine what species it represents. This skeleton was collected in 2016-2018 by staff and volunteers from the Western Science Center, Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences, and Southwest Paleontological Society.Post by Curator Dr. Andrew McDonald\n\nLast week for Fossil Friday, I posted the sacrum of a ceratopsid, a large horned dinosaur related to Triceratops. The sacrum is a series of fused vertebrae to which the hip bones attach. Today, I want to show you one of those hip bones from the same ceratopsid individual. This is the left ilium, showing the inner surface where it would have attached to the sacral ribs along a series of deep facets. At about 80 centimeters long, this ilium is not terribly big for a ceratopsid, but it still would have been a hefty animal, plodding around the forests and swamps of Late Cretaceous New Mexico.In the coming months, we will create 3D-printed replicas of the sacrum and ilium of this ceratopsid to see how they fit together, the first step in rebuilding this 79-million-year-old skeleton. We also have several vertebrae and ribs from the back. This specimen was collected during the 2017 and 2018 field seasons by staff and volunteers from the Western Science Center, Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences, and Southwest Paleontological Society. The sacrum and ilium have both been prepped by WSC lab volunteer Joe Reavis.Post by Curator Dr. Andrew McDonald.\n\nHorned dinosaurs were one of the most successful groups of dinosaurs in the Late Cretaceous of western North America. Known as ceratopsids, these rhino- to elephant-sized beasts brandished horns, spikes, and frills on their massive skulls. More than 40 different species are known to have inhabited western North America at different points in time between 80 and 66 million years ago. The last of them was the great \"three-horned face\" - Triceratops.Ceratopsids have been known from the Menefee Formation of New Mexico since the 1990s, when paleontologists at the New Mexico Museum of Natural History & Science reported fossils including a partial skeleton. More recent expeditions to the Menefee by the Western Science Center, Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences, and Southwest Paleontological Society have discovered further ceratopsid fossils, including another partial skeleton now being prepped at WSC.Today's image is the sacrum of that 79-million-year-old ceratopsid skeleton, recently prepped by WSC volunteer Joe Reavis. The sacrum is a series of fused vertebrae to which the hips were attached. In the image, the bottom surface of the bone is visible. We'll be working on more bones from this skeleton over the coming months, including a hip bone, more vertebrae, and ribs.Post by Curator Dr. Andrew McDonald.\n\nOn March 8 Fossil Friday, I posted an 80-million-year-old dinosaur bone from New Mexico, which I identified as a tibia (shin bone). At the time, it was only partially prepped, and since then, WSC volunteer Joe Reavis has been working tirelessly to remove the remaining mudstone.It turns out the \"tibia\" is actually a femur! It's the proximal half of the left femur of a hadrosaur, one of the large duck-billed plant-eating dinosaurs that are so abundant in Upper Cretaceous rocks throughout the American West. Comparison with a complete hadrosaur femur from Montana (Museum of the Rockies specimen MOR 794) allows us to identify several major features, including the head that fitted into the hip socket and the 4th trochanter, a major muscle attachment site. It also shows that the WSC femur is from a fairly large individual, probably close to 30 feet long.Hadrosaur bones are very common in the Menefee Formation, the rock layer in which this femur was collected by my colleagues from the Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences and Southwest Paleontological Society in 2015. We'll have more to say in the near future.Post by Curator Dr. Andrew McDonald\n\nLast week, five staff members from the Western Science Center, including yours truly, traveled to Albuquerque to attend the 2018 Society of Vertebrate Paleontology conference. We presented six posters on the research, outreach, and educational activities taking place at the museum. Three of the posters dealt with fossils discovered in the Menefee Formation of New Mexico, including the new dinosaurs Invictarx (https://valleyofthemastodon.wordpress.com/2018/08/24/fossil-friday-invictarx-zephyri/) and Dynamoterror (https://valleyofthemastodon.wordpress.com/2018/10/12/fossil-friday-dynamoterror-dynastes/). We presented this research with our colleagues from Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences and Southwest Paleontological Society.This beautiful little bone was the subject of a poster led by Kara Kelley, who has been participating in Menefee expeditions since 2012 and is now an undergraduate at the University of Arizona - Tucson. It's the left maxilla (upper jaw bone) from a very young, very small hadrosaur, which Kara discovered in 2016. Bones of baby dinosaurs are often rare, and this remains the only such bone we have collected in the Menefee Formation so far. In the image, the outer surface of the bone is shown, with a row of tiny teeth along the bottom. The animal's snout would be towards the left of the image, and the back of the skull towards the right. We can't yet tell exactly what kind of hadrosaur this little maxilla belongs to, but it does provide information on the anatomy of a young hadrosaur that lived 80 million years ago.And lest you think that we have two tiny hadrosaur maxillae, the bottom one is actually a painted 3D-print that we created here at Western Science Center through photogrammetry. Now we have a replica of the maxilla that we can take to events and conferences to show people and highlight just one of the many research projects unfolding here at the museum.Andrew McDonald\n\nWelcome Dynamoterror dynastes! This is another very special Fossil Friday for Western Science Center and our colleagues at Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences and Southwest Paleontological Society. Hot on the heels of our new armored herbivorous dinosaur, Invictarx zephyri comes this new tyrannosaur. Like Invictarx, Dynamoterror lived 80 million years ago in what is now New Mexico and is published in the online open-access journal PeerJ. Dynamoterror is known from an incomplete skeleton that includes bones from the skull, hand, foot, and many other fragments. The first image shows the two frontal bones from the top of the skull of Dynamoterror (left and right) and the 3D-print of the composite frontals created at Western Science Center (center). We made the 3D-print by laser-scanning the actual fossils, building 3D digital models of them, and then mirroring and combining the models based upon overlapping anatomical features preserved on both frontals. This 3D-print helped us refine our interpretation of the anatomy in this region of the skull and is a nifty item to share at public events!Dynamoterror lived at the same time and place as Invictarx and the hadrosaur I have posted for Fossil Friday the last three weeks, and probably was quite a threat to them. Paleoartist Brian Engh has depicted a less than friendly encounter between Dynamoterror and Invictarx in a spectacular piece of artwork.Post by Curator Dr. Andrew T. McDonald.\n\nWelcome Invictarx zephyri! This is a very special Fossil Friday for me and everyone here at Western Science Center, and our colleagues at Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences and Southwest Paleontological Society. The paper naming and describing this new armored plant-eating dinosaur was published today in the online, open-access journal PeerJ. These are the fossils of Invictarx laid out, including vertebrae, parts of the forelimbs, and many osteoderms, the bony armor plates that would have been set in the animal's scaly hide - picture the armored back of an alligator. The image is a composite of three different fossil skeletons found at different spots but in the same rock layer in northwestern New Mexico, and all belonging to Invictarx zephyri.Invictarx lived 80 million years ago, when New Mexico was covered in lush forests, dank swamps, and sluggish rivers, a far cry from the parched badlands in which my colleagues and I found the fossil remains. Invictarx is a nodosaurid, a group of armored dinosaurs that includes many species from North America and Europe. The osteoderms of Invictarx have a unique set of features that set them apart from all other nodosaurids, indicating that we have a new species on our hands, one never found by paleontologists before. Like other nodosaurids, Invictarx sported armor plates across its neck, back, and hips, which probably provided a formidable defense against predators like tyrannosaurs. We collected the first skeleton of Invictarx in 2011, at a site perched atop a high ridge whipped by 40 mile-per-hour winds, which made for a challenging excavation. With all this in mind, my sister and I took out our Latin dictionaries and came up with the name Invictarx zephyri, the \"unconquerable fortress of the western wind\". Apart from being a fascinating animal in itself, Invictarx is also the first new species of dinosaur named from the Menefee Formation, the rock layer in which it was discovered. It is the first of many fossil animals and plants from the Menefee that we will describe over the coming years. Of the three specimens, we chose one to serve as the holotype of Invictarx. The holotype of an organism, living or extinct, is the specimen to which the organism's scientific name will always be attached. It serves as the standard by which all future discoveries will be assessed as to whether they represent the same species as the holotype or not. The holotype is accessioned here at the Western Science Center, and is the first holotype in our collections. My colleagues and I return to New Mexico every summer to search for dinosaurs and other fossils in the Menefee Formation. We will very probably find additional fossils of Invictarx that will tell us more about its appearance and evolution. Naming it was really just the first step!Post by Curator Dr. Andrew McDonald\n\nAfter a successful expedition earlier this summer, the Western Science Center crew returned to the Menefee Formation of New Mexico last week to search for more fossils of dinosaurs and other creatures that roamed the area 80 million years ago. As before, we were joined by colleagues from the Zuni Dinosaur Institute for Geosciences, students from the University of Arizona - Tucson, and volunteers from the Southwest Paleontological Society. Unlike the first trip, when we spent most of our time digging at two dinosaur quarries, this trip was mostly spent exploring for new fossil sites.This bone fragment is one of the pieces we collected while prospecting. The outer surface of this piece is riddled with deep branching grooves. This sort of texture is present only on the bony horn cores of ceratopsids, the big horned dinosaurs, such as Triceratops. When the dinosaur was alive, these grooves would have been occupied by blood vessels supplying the sheath of keratin (think fingernails) that covered the bony horn core. The photo shows the Menefee horn core fragment next to the brow horns of Ava, a horned dinosaur skull on display in WSC's \"Great Wonders\" exhibit. Ava's horns have the same texture. We will spend the next year preparing and studying the fossils we brought back from this summer's Menefee expeditions, and we will have much more to say about them in the very near future!
