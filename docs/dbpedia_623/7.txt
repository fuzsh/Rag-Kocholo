Continuing our journey to discover the Vitae models, today we show you the photographs of the Zhejiangosaurus lishuiensis, the first nodosaurid discovered in Asia!

This model is also in 1:35 scale (17 cm long and 5 cm high) and will be released in the Regular, Cheap and Deluxe variants. The Cheap version will cost around $ 3 and the Regular version around $ 11, while for the Deluxe version with base the price will be around $ 25.

Like the other models, the deluxe version has an incredibly detailed base, which attaches to the model via small magnets.

Another natural looking model that will please many fans!
