        "text": "Planning a trip to France? You’re going to need some France currency!\n\nI’ve traveled to France nearly a dozen times, so I know what you need for a smooth and stress-free vacation in France.\n\nI’ve found that most shops and restaurants in large French cities – like Paris, Lyon, Nice and Marseille – accept credit cards as payment.\n\nBut smaller businesses may not, especially if you take day trips to smaller French towns.\n\nIt is always a good idea to have some money in France for small purchases and places that don’t accept credit cards. For example, for buying a baguette at a small mom-and-pop bakery, or for tipping your tour guide.\n\nAre you wondering to yourself, ‘What is France’s currency?’ Don’t worry, I’ve got everything that you need to know before your trip!\n\nDisclaimer: This page may contain affiliate links. I earn a small commission if you make a purchase through these links (at no additional cost to you).\n\nWhat is the currency of France?\n\nThe official currency of France is the euro. The symbol of the euro is €.\n\nAnd since France currency is the euro, that means that Paris currency is the euro.\n\nFrance was one of the first European countries to start using the euro. Euro bills and coins began circulating as legal tender in France on January 1, 2002.\n\nEleven other countries started using the euro as legal tender on this same date.\n\nWhat is the euro?\n\nThe euro is a monetary unit and the common currency of many of the member nations of the European Union (EU). The countries that use the euro are referred to as the ‘eurozone’ or the ‘euro area’.\n\nThe euro (EUR) is the second most traded currency in the world, after the United States dollar (USD).\n\nHaving a common currency between these European countries has a lot of benefits for the countries. For example, it makes trade easier by not having to contend with fluctuations in exchange rates between countries.\n\nThe euro is also a HUGE improvement for travelers to Europe!\n\nIf you were visiting multiple countries in Europe before the introduction of the euro, you’d have to carry several currencies or exchange currency multiple times during your trip. This was certainly a hassle.\n\nLet’s use an example of a trip itinerary starting in Naples, continuing on to Paris, and ending in Barcelona.\n\nBefore the introduction of the euro, you would have needed three different types of money: Italian lira, French francs, and Spanish pesetas.\n\nBut now, all you need to do is pick up some euros and you’ll be set for your entire trip. With the euro, France’s currency is the same as the currency in Italy. Easy peasy!\n\nAcross the sea to the north, euros are used within Ireland, but not in the Nothern Ireland. (Northern Ireland is part of the UK.) Be sure to bring your euros to Dublin, since Dublin is not in Northern Ireland!\n\nWhat do euros look like?\n\nI think euros are some of the prettiest currencies. Each bill features a different design of architectural elements. One side depicts bridges and a map of Europe, and the other depicts arches, windows, and columns.\n\nIt is easy to tell the different denominations of euro banknotes apart. The different euro bills come in different colors and sizes. The largest denomination is also the physically largest bill, with bill sizes decreasing with denomination.\n\nI found it really handy to be able to organize my wallet by size to quickly find a small bill (as compared to US dollars, where all bills are the same size and color). This is really helpful for people with vision impairments.\n\nYou’ll note plenty of security features, like watermarks and holograms, on the bills to prevent counterfeiting.\n\nEuro denominations: euro banknotes\n\nEuro bills come in seven denominations: €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200, and €500.\n\nFor travel, it’s good to carry a variety of denominations. But the larger bills are going to be a lot harder to spend, so stick with €50 and below.\n\n500 EUR: This is the largest euro bank note, at 160mm x 82mm. This banknote is purple (my favorite) and features modern architecture. Note: This denomination is being phased out. You might still find older notes, but as of April 2019, €500 are no longer being issued.\n\n200 EUR: Physical size: 153mm x 82mm. The yellow €200 bill features Art Nouveau architecture.\n\n100 EUR: Physical size: 147mm x 82mm. The green €100 bill depicts Baroque and Rococo architecture.\n\n50 EUR: Physical size: 140mm x 70mm. The orange €50 bill portrays Renaissance architecture.\n\n20 EUR: Physical size: 133mm x 72mm. The blue €20 note features Gothic architecture. I love those arched stained-glass windows!\n\n10 EUR: Physical size: 127mm x 67mm. The red €10 note depicts Romanesque architecture.\n\n5 EUR: This is the smallest bank note, at 120mm x 62mm. The gray €5 note portrays Classical architecture.\n\nEuro denominations: euro coins\n\nIn addition to the euro paper banknotes, there are also several denominations of euro coins. The smallest denominations are ‘cents’, where 1 cent = 1/100 of €1 (just like in US currency, where cents are 1/100 of $1).\n\nEuro coins come in 8 denominations: 1 cent, 2 cent, 5 cent, 10 cent, 20 cent, 50 cent, €1 and €2.\n\nEuro coins come in a variety of sizes, metals, and edge patterns. Some edges are completely smooth, some are evenly ridged, some are notched, and some alternate smooth and ridged sections.\n\nThis differentiation again helps the visually impaired to easily identify the various coins.\n\nWhile the euro bills are the same across all counties, each country is able to choose its own design for the back of its coinage.\n\nThe €1 and €2 coins\n\nThe €1 and €2 coins are the easiest to pick out of a pile of change. They’re large and made of two different metals.\n\n€2: The €2 is the largest of the euro coins. The inside of the coin is a golden toned metal, with the outer ring a silvery tone. The edge of the coin is a set of very fine ridges, and if you look closely, you’ll see small patterns and letters spaced along the edge. My remaining €2 coins appear to be from France and the patterning is tiny numbers and stars.\n\n€1: The €1 is another two-toned coin, with the colors flipped from the €2 coin. On the €1 coin, the inside is the silver-toned metal, and the outer ring is the golden colored metal. The edge of the €1 alternates smooth sections and sections of very fine ridges.\n\nThe Nordic Gold coins\n\n50c: The 50c euro coin is the largest of the fractional euro coins. The 50c coin is golden in color, a special composition called ‘Nordic gold’. Nordic gold is a copper alloy which is commonly used in currency. The edge of the 50c coin is patterned with thick ridges.\n\n20c: The 20c coin is smaller than the 50c coin, but is also made of the golden ‘Nordic gold’ alloy. The edge of the 20c coin is smooth but marked with 7 regularly spaced indentations, or notches.\n\n10c: The 10c euro coin is again smaller than the 20c coin, and is the third coin made of the ‘Nordic gold’ alloy. The edge of the 10c coin is patterned with thick ridges.\n\nThe smallest euro coins\n\n5c: The 5c euro coin is slightly larger than the 10c coin, but now we’ve moved to a different metal. The 5c coin is copper in color with a smooth edge (like the US penny).\n\n2c: The 2c euro coin is smaller than the 5c coin, and is also copper in color. The edge of the 2c coin is smooth but with a groove.\n\n1c: The smallest denomination of the euro, the 1c coin, is physically quite tiny. The 1c coin is the baby version of its 5c big brother – it’s copper in color with a smooth edge.\n\nEuro coins: tips\n\nPro Tip #1: Here’s another good reason to carry cash that no-one talks about: pay toilets. If you need to use the facilities when you’re waiting at the train station, you’ll need to make sure you have some small change on hand.\n\nTypically, the fee for the restroom will be 50 cents or €1, but it can vary. Always keep an assortment of change in your pocket!\n\nPrio Tip #2: I mentioned that the 5c euro coin looks a lot like a US penny. This makes it really difficult to find the right change if you have euros and US coins jumbled together in your coin purse.\n\nI highly recommend bringing a Ziploc-type plastic bag along with you on your trip. Before you land in Paris (or whatever your European destination city is), put all your US change into the baggie.\n\nAnd once you’re ready to come home, put the US coins back into your wallet, and put your euro coins into the bag. Be sure to keep the bag in a safe place – that you will remember! – and bring the French money back with you on your next trip to Europe.\n\nWhich countries use the euro?\n\nThe euro is the common currency of the European Union. However, not all of the countries in the European Union have met the economic stability criteria to be able to use the euro as legal tender.\n\nThe countries that do use the euro are considered to be part of the ‘eurozone’ or ‘euro area’. The countries that are not part of the eurozone still use their own national currencies. So, if you are visiting one of those countries, you’ll still need to exchange your money into the local currency.\n\nHere is a list of the current countries in Europe that are part of the eurozone and use the euro as legal tender:\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nCroatia (scheduled to join the eurozone and the Schengen Area Jan1 2023 – congrats, Croatia!)\n\nCyprus\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nthe Netherlands\n\nPortugal\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nHere are the countries that are part of the European Union, but have not met the economic stability conditions required to join the eurozone. (So, you’ll need local currency in these countries.)\n\nBulgaria\n\nCzechia\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nSweden\n\nAnd, we have one country that is part of the European Union, but that has opted out of using the euro as its legal tender. (Note that European Union member states can opt-out of various EU policies.)\n\nDenmark\n\nHere is a handy map to help you visualize which countries are in the European Union, which are in the eurozone, and which are part of the Schengen area. This has been created based on Croatia’s plan to become a member of the eurozone and Schengen area on January 1, 2023.\n\nCurrency exchange rates\n\nWhen you’re traveling abroad, it’s important to know the currency exchange rates for your home currency to the currency of the country you’re visiting.\n\nIt’s easy to see a price and associate it to your home currency without doing the proper math. This can be a costly mistake!\n\nOn our first visit to Paris after the money in France became the euro, the US dollar to euro exchange rate was not favorable to the US. It was around €1 = $1.3. So, if your hotel cost €100/night, it was really a price of $130/night.\n\nThe exchange rates have been getting much more favorable for the US in recent years. When we visited Paris in November, the exchange rate was nearly at parity – around €1 = $1.04. When the exchange rates are close like this, it’s a lot easier to keep on your budget.\n\nBe sure to check the current exchange rates for your home currency vs the euro prior to your travels. This currency converter will give you the current exchange rate between any two currencies.\n\nWhat was the previous currency of France?\n\nBefore the introduction of the euro, the previous currency of France was the French franc. In 1795 (after the French Revolution), the republican government introduced the French franc (FF) as a monetary unit.\n\nThe French franc became the official currency of France in the year 1799. Smaller monetary units, franc coins, were décimes (10 décimes = 1 franc) and centimes ( 100 centimes = 1 franc).\n\n(Prior to the French franc, the French livre was the national currency of France. There is a long history of other French currencies, including the livre tournois and French coins such as the gold louis and the silver écu.)\n\nAfter the adoption of the euro as the official French currency in January 2002, there was a brief period where both the euro and the franc were accepted as legal tender. The franc was no longer accepted as legal tender in France after February 17th, 2002.\n\nThe fixed exchange rate of the French franc to euro : €1 = 6.55957 FRF.\n\nIf you still have old francs from a previous trip to France, I’m sorry to say that they are just souvenirs now. The Banque of France stopped exchanging francs for euros in 2012.\n\nHow to get money for your trip to France\n\nThere are several ways to get euros for your trip to France.\n\nIf you want to be prepared and have some euros before you leave home, you can order foreign currency from your local bank.\n\nNote that this option will be more expensive than getting cash from an ATM once you get to France. But for me, it was worth it for my peace of mind.\n\nMy bank used a slightly different euro-to-dollar exchange rate for the currency purchase (to their advantage) and also charged a shipping fee. But I received the currency within 48 hours of my order.\n\nThe least expensive way to get cash in France is to visit an ATM affiliated with a bank once you arrive in France. (If you choose an ATM that is not affiliated with a bank, you will likely be charged cash withdrawal fees by the ATM.)\n\nAlso, be aware of your bank’s policies for withdrawing cash in a foreign country, as your bank might charge fees in addition to the fees levied by the ATM. (Be sure to notify your bank that you’ll be traveling, to reduce the chances that your transactions will get flagged or denied.)\n\nWhen withdrawing cash, always choose the option to pay in the local currency, to avoid currency exchange rate markups.\n\nA third option is to use money exchange offices. Here the exchange rate will be much worse than the official rate, and the office may also charge a commission or fee on the transaction. If you must use a money exchange bureau, try to avoid the ones at the airport.\n\nFrance Currency FAQ\n\nFinal Thoughts:\n\nNow you know all the essential information about the currency used in France, and can now answer the question, “What currency does France use?“\n\nSo go get some euros and have a fantastic trip!
