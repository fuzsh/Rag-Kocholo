It was introduced in 1999 and has since grown to be one of the world’s most traded currencies. Countries that use the euro are called the eurozone.\n\nWhen the euro was first created, it was only used by 12 countries.\n\nAustria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain all adopted the euro as their official currency in January 1999. Slovenia joined in 2007, Cyprus and Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014, Lithuania in 2015, and Croatia in 2023.\n\nThere are currently 20 European Union member countries that use the euro as their currency: Austria, Belgium, Croatia, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy*, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain.\n\nWhen Was Euro First Used? And By Which Country\n\nThe euro was first used in 1999 when eleven European Union member states introduced it. These countries were Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece later joined in 2001.\n\nList Of European Countries Using The Euro\n\nAs of January 2023, there are 20 EU member countries that use the euro as their official currency. Croatia was the most recent member of the EU to join joined in January 2023.\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nNetherlands\n\nPortugal\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nBrands We Use And Trust\n\nList Of Non-EU Countries Using The Euro\n\nThere are a number of countries that use the euro as their currency but are not members of the European Union.\n\nAndorra\n\nKosovo\n\nMonaco\n\nMontenegro\n\nSan Marino\n\nVatican City\n\nMap Of Countries That Use The Euro\n\n&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;span data-mce-type=”bookmark” style=”display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;” class=”mce_SELRES_start”&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt; &amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;lt;/span&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;gt;\n\nWhat Countries Are Part Of The European Union (EU)\n\nThere are 27 member states of the European Union. These countries are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.\n\nThe euro is the official currency of 20 of these 27 member states. The other seven member states have chosen to keep their own national currencies and have not yet adopted the euro. These countries are Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Ro, mania, and Sweden.\n\nWhy Are Some Countries In The EU Not Using The Euro As The Currency – Who Are They\n\nThere are several reasons why some EU countries have not adopted the euro as their currency. Some of these countries, like Denmark, have opt-outs from the monetary union. Other countries, like Sweden, have chosen not to join the euro zone despite being eligible to do so.\n\nSome countries have not adopted the euro because they believe it would be detrimental to their economies.\n\nThese countries are concerned that they would lose control over their monetary policy and interest rates if they adopted the euro. Additionally, many of these countries have strong economies and don’t feel pressure to switch to the euro. For example, Sweden has one of the strongest economies in Europe, and its currency, the SweKronakrona, is very stable.\n\nSo far, only 20 out of 27 EU member states have adopted the euro as their currency. This means that there are still 7 EU countries that are using their own national currencies. These include:\n\nBulgaria\n\nCzech Republic\n\nDenmark\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nSweden\n\nWhat Country Will Next Adopt The Euro As The Local Currency\n\nThis is a difficult question to answer, as many factors need to be considered before a country can adopt the euro as its local currency. Some of these factors include:\n\nThe country’s economic stability\n\nThe country’s political stability\n\nThe country’s inflation rate\n\nThe country’s trade deficit or surplus\n\nThe country’s interest rates\n\nThere is no definite answer as to which country will be the next to adopt the euro as its local currency. However, it is believed that it would next be Bulgaria. The euro is targeted to be introduced in January 2025, leaving behind the “Lev,” making the euro Bulgaria’s second currency after more than 140 years.\n\nWhat Country Will Next Join The European Union (EU)\n\nThe next country to join the European Union is widely expected to be North Macedonia. This follows the recent signing of the Prespa agreement between Greece and North Macedonia, which settled a long-standing dispute over the latter’s name.\n\nOther potential candidates for EU membership include Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, Montenegro, Serbia, and Turkey. All these countries are currently in various stages of negotiations or pre-accession processes with the EU.\n\nWhat Are The Denominations Of The Euro\n\nEuro banknotes are in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500.\n\nThere are also 1 and 2 euro coins, as well as euro cents in coins of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50.\n\nEuro & Eurozone FAQs"
