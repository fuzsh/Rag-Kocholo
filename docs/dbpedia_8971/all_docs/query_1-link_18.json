        "text": "What is the currency in France?\n\nThe official currency in France is the Euro, which is issued and overseen by the Bank of France. If you’re buying your travel money online you may also see the official code being shown - EUR. In stores and restaurants, Euro prices are likely to use the currency symbol €.\n\nOnce you’re in France you’ll see costs of items shown in EUR and you’ll need to start paying for things in local coins and notes which are often found in the following denominations:\n\nbanknotes - 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 EUR and coins - 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents; 1, 2 EUR.\n\nCan you officially pay in CAD when you are in France?\n\nYou’re unlikely to be able to officially transact in CAD in France, which is why it’s time to start getting used to EUR and learning more about the currency exchange rates so you’ll know what you’re spending on your trip.\n\nThis guide will walk through all you need to know, including Canadian dollar/Euro rates and where best to get your travel money from.\n\nEuroCurrency nameEuroISO codeEURSymbol€SubunitCentCentral BankBank of FranceBest travel cards to take to FranceWise\n\nEUR coins and banknotes\n\nHere’s a full rundown of the EUR coins and banknotes you’ll need to be familiar with when you’re in France.\n\nEUR banknotesEUR coinsbanknotes - 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 EURcoins - 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 cents; 1, 2 EUR\n\nHistory of Euro currency\n\nThe Euro (EUR) is the official currency of the Eurozone, which consists of 19 of the 27 European Union countries. It was introduced in 1999 as an accounting currency and launched as physical coins and banknotes in 2002. The euro is the second-most traded currency in the world and provides the benefits of removing exchange rate risk in the Eurozone.\n\nIs CAD accepted in France?\n\nAs we’ve seen, the official currency in France is EUR. If you carry CAD with you on your trip, you’ll probably need to exchange it before you can spend.\n\nSometimes when you’re away on a trip abroad you’ll find that merchants will take payments in a selection of major foreign currencies. However, the chances are that where this is offered, you won’t get a good exchange rate for your CAD. Planning smart and convenient ways to spend in EUR when you’re away is likely to mean you save on costs in the end.\n\nUsually, having a few different ways to pay and get cash is the best option for travelers and tourists. That’s because you’ll have a back up plan in case one payment method isn’t accepted for any reason, and you can pick the method that’s best suited to the specific transaction. Having a multi-currency card from a provider like Wise, plus your normal bank debit card, and some local cash in EUR should mean you’ve always got options. You can use your cash for small purchases and tipping, and make low cost payments and cash withdrawals with your multi-currency card, while keeping your bank card in reserve for emergencies.\n\nUse a travel card on your next trip to France\n\nUsing a travel debit card in France is usually cheap, safe and convenient. A few providers in the UK offer multi-currency cards which come with a linked payment account that lets you convert, hold and spend in EUR. That allows you to add a balance in CAD and switch over to EUR to lock in the exchange rate and set your travel budget.\n\nOnce you have EUR in your account there are no extra fees to make payments, and you’ll not have foreign transaction charges to worry about, either.\n\nHere’s a quick overview of a couple of handy travel debit cards you may want to order and use in France.\n\nWhat is the currency exchange rate for £ 1 CAD/EUR?\n\nIt’s helpful to get to know the live CAD/EUR rate so you can easily calculate how much things are costing you while you’re on your trip abroad. The rate you need to focus on is the mid market rate, which is the one banks and major currency services get when buying and selling currencies. This rate isn’t always passed on to customers. Instead you may find that the CAD/EUR rate you get when exchanging travel cash includes a markup - an extra fee.\n\nFind the CAD/EUR mid-market rate from a currency conversion site or a website like this, so you can keep an eye on the market and compare the rates you’re offered as you travel against the mid-market rate easily.\n\nShould I exchange CAD to EUR before traveling to France?\n\nBecause France sees many tourists from the UK every year you might find you’re better off if you exchange your currency when you get to France rather than worrying about getting your cash sorted out before you leave.\n\nGet familiar with the exchange rates offered locally to you, and online, so you can decide whether it’s worth switching some funds in advance of travel, using a card to pay while you’re away, or converting cash on arrival. Both in the UK and in France, steer clear of exchanging currency at the airport. A captive market means that CAD/EUR rates are often worse in the airport than in city centers.\n\nWhen you’re in France you’re going to need EUR in cash for some of your spending - particularly when tipping or making smaller value purchases. Buying your EUR travel money in advance can get you better CAD/EUR exchange rates, and saves you wasting precious time shopping around for a good deal once you arrive in France.\n\nTips for exchanging money in France\n\nThere’s a good network of ATMs across France, and card payments are also widely accepted. Always pay in CAD to avoid sneaky extra dynamic currency conversion costs and to make sure your money goes further.\n\n2)Avoid using exchange providers at airports or hotels in France as they usually offer pretty poor exchange rates because they have a captive market and little competition nearby\n\n3)Today’s mid market exchange rate for CAD/EUR is 0.66224 - look for this or as close as possible to it when you exchange your travel money\n\n4)Use a travel debit card like the Wise card while you’re in France for fast and cheap conversion between currencies and easy ways to manage your money from your phone\n\nBest place to exchange currency in France\n\nYou can get your EUR in France in a couple of ways.\n\nYou’ll be able to use a travel debit card from a provider like [wise-affiliate-name-links] to make convenient payments and cash withdrawals and to convert funds online.\n\nOr if you prefer an offline solution you can carry some cash in CAD to exchange when you arrive. Currency exchange providers are often in airports and hotels, although the exchange shops in a city center are likely to be cheaper overall.\n\nHow to pay in France?\n\nYou’ll need to have EUR to spend in France. However, generally having a few different payment methods is a good plan. That means that if a merchant won't accept one, you’ve got a back up. It’s also reassuring to know you have a different way to pay if you were unlucky enough to have a card or some travel cash stolen. Here are your key payment options in France.\n\n1. Debit or credit card\n\nCard payments can be helpful in shops, restaurants and hotels but there will be places where cash is also important. Order a travel card from a provider like Wise for cheap and fast transactions, including card payments and cash withdrawals as and when you need travel money in EUR.\n\n2. EUR cash\n\nCash is widely used in France, so it’s worth having some with you at all times. You may want to exchange money to EUR before you leave, but it’s also usually convenient to make ATM withdrawals locally once you arrive in France.\n\nYou’ll usually find you can use a card to make payments in France, but carrying some cash in EUR is also reassuring. It’s often easier for tipping and making smaller purchases, plus you’ve got a nice backup if your card is ever out of action for some reason.\n\nIt’s a smart idea to have both a card and some cash in EUR when you’re in France. Some merchants will prefer cash, but having a card for higher value payments and in busier more tourist places is also convenient. Consider using a travel card from a provider like Wise alongside your cash for flexibility.\n\nPaying for the trip in CAD\n\nIf you’re paying for things in France with a CAD bank card you might find a foreign transaction fee is added. This pushes up your costs when you spend in a foreign currency, and can be tricky to calculate.\n\nTravel debit cards don’t always work this way. When you make purchases in France using the [wise-affiliate-name-links] card you can either choose to convert your account balance to EUR in advance in the Wise app, or just leave your balance in CAD and let the card handle the transaction when you pay. You’ll always get the lowest available fee and there are no extra foreign transaction charges.\n\nConclusion - Currency in France\n\nYou won’t be able to pay in CAD when you visit France - so learning about the currency you need is essential. Whether you decide to use a travel debit card from a service like [wise-affiliate-name-links], or stock up on EUR in cash in advance, knowing the mid-market exchange rate can help you get the best available deal. Use this guide to learn all you need to know about the options, rates and fees for exchanging CAD to EUR, and make your money go further while you’re away.\n\nThe official currency in France is EUR. You can’t usually pay in CAD in France, so you’ll need to plan in advance to get your travel money sorted.
