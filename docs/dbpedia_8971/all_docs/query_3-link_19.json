        "text": "As of 2022, the euro has been the world's second-most traded currency and it has a major influence on the global economy. It gives businesses and countries a meaningful alternative to the US dollar, and promotes competition and stability within foreign exchange markets. The strength of the euro stems from the eurozone, an economically powerful collective of nations which all use the euro.\n\nBusinesses within the eurozone benefit from using a single currency. It makes trade easier and gets rid of the need for currency conversion. For international businesses, operating in euros reduces exposure to risks surrounding exchange rates. A strong euro grows the European Union's global presence, allowing it to advocate for its economic interests and help to shape global financial regulations.\n\nThis guide will cover a brief history of the euro and where it's currently used.\n\nWhat's in this article?\n\nHistory of the euro\n\nImportance of the euro in the world economy\n\nWhich countries use the euro?\n\nHistory of the euro\n\nThe euro is the official currency of the eurozone, which includes 20 of the 27 EU member states. The process of creating a single European currency began in earnest with the Werner Report published in 1970, which had the failed goal of creating a monetary union by 1980. The Maastricht Treaty, signed in 1992, set the formal criteria for the adoption of a single currency. And in 1994, the European Monetary Institute was established to strengthen cooperation between the EU's central banks and to prepare for the European Central Bank (ECB) and the euro.\n\nOn 1 January 1999, the European Union introduced the euro as an \"invisible\" currency for electronic payments and accounting purposes, while continuing to use national currencies for cash transactions. Euro banknotes and coins began circulating on 1 January 2002, replacing the old currencies of 12 member states and marking the biggest cash changeover in history. The old national currencies ceased to be legal tender shortly thereafter.\n\nHowever, the global financial crisis of 2008 and subsequent European debt crises exposed weaknesses in the eurozone's economic architecture. The EU introduced measures such as the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to provide financial stability and assistance to member states in financial distress.\n\nThe eurozone expanded in the years that followed as new EU members met the economic Maastricht criteria for entry, with Slovenia joining in 2007, Malta in 2008, Slovakia in 2009, Estonia in 2011, Latvia in 2014 and Lithuania in 2015. Croatia was the most recent addition, adopting the euro in 2023."
