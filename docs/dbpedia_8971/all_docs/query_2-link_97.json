        "text": "“It is up to us, to you, to map out the route which ensures our future, the one I wish to talk to you about today. The route of rebuilding a sovereign, united and democratic Europe. Let us together have the audacity to create this route.”\n\nSorbonne Speech – 26 September 2017.\n\n“We need to step up the work underway to combat the financing of terrorism and terrorist propaganda online. We need to enhance our cyber security and create a common area of security and justice.”\n\n“I want us to create a European Civil Protection Force, pooling our resources for rescue and intervention, thus enabling us to respond to disasters.”\n\n“I would like our partnership with Africa to be an aspect of the overhaul of the European project.”\n\n“We have only one choice, one alternative: closing in behind our borders or the construction of a common area for border management, asylum and migration. ”\n\n“We also need to look further, and I want to say clearly that even the most robust borders and most ambitious security policies will not suffice to curb long-term migration flows. Only stabilization and development in countries of origin will dry them up.”\n\n“Today Europe is in a period in between but our choice is simple: do we want to continue producing as we have in the past […] or do we wish to push forward and become leaders of a new production model that will not only be a model for the economy, but also a model for society.”\n\nEurope […] must take the lead in this revolution through radical innovation. Throughout Europe, we must do everything in our power to have these digital champions, to attract talented scientists and entrepreneurs. ”\n\n“And today, this digital continent has no standards, or more precisely, it has one law: the survival of the fittest. It is Europe’s responsibility to define its regulatory framework so as not to effectively be subject to the survival of the fittest here.”\n\n“Sovereignty is industrial and monetary economic power. Making the heart of Europe an economic and industrial power, […] also means having an ambitious space policy and consolidating a competitive European industry on a global scale.”\n\n“And we cannot accept to have European actors who must pay tax, while their international counterparts do not, and digital actors who pay no tax competing with traditional economy actors who do pay tax.”\n\n“We need to have transparent negotiations and we need the trade agreements to be implemented. We need social and environmental stringency in our trade debates. And we need reciprocity.”\n\n“Europe currently has no protection from social dumping, and we have allowed a European market to develop that runs contrary to our labour market’s very philosophy of unity.”\n\n“In 2024, half of students in a given age group should have spent at least six months in another European country by the time they are 25. whether they are university students or learning a trade. ”\n\n“What will this Europe of 2024 look like? As I have said, Europe’s unity is the basis of this overhaul. The European Union in 2024 will be brought together on two pillars, in my view. The first represents the values of democracy and the rule of law. They’re non-negotiable, there can be no cherry-picking. On values, there can be no two-speed Europe. They are the catalyst for our unity and freedom.”"
