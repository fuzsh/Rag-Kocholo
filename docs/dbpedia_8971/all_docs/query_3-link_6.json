        "text": "Out of the 51 independent states which make up Europe, just under half of those (25) use the Euro as its currency despite 27 countries currently EU members*. To ensure savvy travellers looking to holiday in Europe this summer are travelling with the correct currency in their pockets, we have compiled a table highlighting which European countries use the Euro and which countries have maintained their own currency.\n\nNon-Euro\n\nDespite the Euro used as the currency by EU member states, eight of the 27 current members were found to not use the Euro and to have maintained their own independent currency including Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland and Sweden. Denmark, despite having joined the EU in 1973**, has also not changed its currency and still uses the Danish Krone (DKK).\n\nEuro\n\nTravellers looking to holiday outside of the EU should also plan ahead and check the country’s currency. Surprisingly, the APH research found six non-EU countries use the Euro as a local currency including Andorra, Monaco and San Marino, as well as Akrotiri and Dhekelia – two British Overseas Territories bordering the Republic of Cyprus and Northern Cyprus. Gibraltar on the other hand, another British Overseas Territory, is not part of the EU and has maintained its own currency of the Gibraltar Pound (GIP). Ireland is also a member of the EU and has converted to the Euro.\n\nSterling\n\nFor those holidaymakers looking to stay closer to home this summer and visit Guernsey or Jersey in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man, it also pays to plan. As self-governing British dependencies, they all have the authority to use their own currency with the Guernsey Pound (GGP), Jersey Pound (JEP) and Manx Pound (IMP) used respectively. Travellers are able to use UK currency across all three countries, however the Guernsey, Jersey and Manx Pound cannot be used back in the UK and will need to be exchanged back to UK currency.\n\nNick Caunter, Managing Director of APH said, “We put together the APH currency table to help travellers planning a short-haul holiday to Europe this summer, ensure they have the correct currency in their pockets and purses. Exchanging travel money is usually left until the last minute, however it pays to shop around for the best exchange rate and sometimes order currency in advance. By planning ahead and having the correct currency, travellers can get more from their holiday pounds.”\n\nCountry European Union Member / European Economic Area Currency Albania NO Albanian Lek ALL Andorra NO Euro Armenia NO Armenian Dram AMD Austria YES Euro Azerbaijan NO Azerbaijan Manat AZN Belarus NO Belarusian Ruble BYN Belgium YES Euro Bosnia and Herzegovina NO Bosnia and Herzegovina convertible mark BAM Bulgaria YES Bulgarian Lev BGN Croatia YES Croatian Kuna HRK Cyprus YES Euro Czech Republic YES Czech Koruna (CZK) Denmark YES Danish Krone DKK Estonia YES Euro Finland YES Euro France YES Euro Georgia NO Georgian Lari GEL Germany YES Euro Greece YES Euro Hungary YES Hungarian Forint HUF Iceland NO (EEA) Icelandic Krona ISK Ireland YES Euro Italy YES Euro Kazakhstan NO Kazakhstani Tenge KZT Kosovo NO Euro Latvia YES Euro Liechtenstein NO (EEA) Swiss Franc CHF Lithuania YES Euro Luxemburg YES Euro Malta YES Euro Moldova NO Moldovan Leu MDL Monaco NO Euro Montenegro NO Euro The Netherlands YES Euro North Macedonia NO Macedonian Denar MKD Norway NO (EEA) Norwegian Krone NOK Poland YES Polish Złoty PLN Portugal YES Euro Romania YES Romanian Leu RON Russia NO Russian Ruble RUB San Marino NO Euro Serbia NO Serbian Dinar RSD Slovakia YES Euro Slovenia YES Euro Spain YES Euro Sweden YES Swedish Krona SEK Switzerland NO Swiss Franc CHF Turkey NO Turkish Lira TRY Ukraine NO Ukrainian Hryvnia UAH United Kingdom NO Pound Sterling GBP Vatican City NO Euro\n\nDependent Territories\n\nCountry European Union Member Currency Akrotiri and Dhekelia (UK) NO Euro Aland Islands (Finland) YES Euro Faroe Islands (Denmark) NO Faroese Krona Gibraltar (UK) NO Gibraltar Pound GIP Guernsey (UK) NO Guernsey Pound GGP Isle of Man (UK) NO Manx Pound IMP Jersey (UK) NO Jersey Pound JEP Svalbard and Jan Mayen (Norway) NO Norwegian Krone NOK\n\nReferences"
