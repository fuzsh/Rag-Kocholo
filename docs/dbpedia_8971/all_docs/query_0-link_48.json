        "text": "Whether you’re voting, following the news, or just need to distract yourself from the surge of populism, knowing who’s in power (and why!) is always a recommended move. Learn more about France’s political system, including recent election results, key political alignments, and the role of the president.\n\nContinue reading for more information on the following:\n\nOverview of the political system in France\n\nFrance is one of the birthplaces of modern democracy, with modern political institutions dating back to 1789.\n\nThe republic is a parliamentary democracy with a semi‑presidential political system. Its head of state is the French president (président), who appoints the prime minister (Premier ministre – PM) as head of government.\n\nHaving invented the three branches of power (i.e., trias politica) in 1748, France’s government is separated into:\n\nThe executive – the president and the central government (Gouvernement), which consists of the PM and French ministers\n\nThe legislature is called the Parliament (Parlement) and consists of two chambers:\n\nThe lower house is called the National Assembly (Assemblée nationale), which has 577 democratically elected seats (députés) with five-year terms\n\nThe upper house or Senate (Sénat), which has 348 senators with six-year terms\n\nThe judiciary comprises the courts and the legal system in France\n\nThe national government is France’s main decision-making body and oversees policy development in areas such as healthcare, education, and public transport. Below that are three tiers of government that perform various administrative and legal functions: 18 French regions (régions) including five overseas territories, 96 departments (départements), and around 35,000 municipalities (communes).\n\nAccording to the 2023 Democracy Index, France ranks 23rd globally and is classed as a full democracy. The country holds elections every five years to choose its president and political leaders. All French citizens over the age of 18 have the right to vote and stand for public office.\n\nWhile voting is not mandatory, the French score above average in civil society participation. In 2023, an impressive 88% of citizens were active in an organization that chooses and influences policy-makers.\n\nLiving\n\nCrime and the legal system in France\n\nRead more\n\nWhich are the main political parties in France?\n\nFrance has a high number of political parties across the spectrum. These often fragment or mutate into a new party, form alliances with each other, or sometimes just dissolve.\n\nMost parties can be quite easily placed along the old left-right economic scale. Interestingly, in French politics, the term libéral tends to mean only economic (free-market) liberalism. As such, it should be treated as the opposite of socialism, rather than as social liberalism (e.g., civil rights).\n\nThe June–July 2024 election saw the following political alliances:\n\nTogether (Ensemble – ENS)\n\nThe alliance also includes three smaller center parties.\n\nNew Popular Front (Nouveau Front Populaire – NFP)\n\nThe alliance also includes 50 smaller left-wing parties.\n\nNational Rally Alliance (Rassemblement National – RN)\n\nFollowing the 2024 European Parliament election, LR party leader Éric Ciotti declared his party would align with the RN during the 2024 election. However, this provoked a major schism within the party, and Ciotti was ousted on 12 June. He took the case to court and was reinstated two days later.\n\nAs a result, some LR members split off and started The Republican Right (La Droite républicaine), under the leadership of Laurent Wauquiez. It is unclear what this means for the RN alliance.\n\nPresident vs PM: who is currently in power in France?\n\nFrance has both a president and a prime minister.\n\nThe president is the most powerful person in the French government, and generally the most well-known figurehead. The public elects (and may re-elect) the president for a five-year term. Presidents cannot serve more than two consecutive terms.\n\nFrance’s current president is Emmanuel Macron (RE). He came to power in 2017 and was re-elected in 2022, beating Marine Le Pen (NR) with 58.5% of the vote. His term runs until 2027.\n\nThe president is responsible for appointing a prime minister as the head of government. Of course, a lot of pressure to pick a PM from the winning party of the legislative elections. Presidents do not have the power to dismiss PMs, but they can ask for their resignation.\n\nFrench prime ministers don’t often last the full parliamentary term, and many have resigned early for various reasons. For example, amid a major government crisis in January 2024, now-former Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne resigned at Macron’s request. She was the second woman to hold the position after Édith Cresson.\n\nBorne was succeeded by now-Prime Minister Gabriel Attal (RE), who is the first openly gay person to serve as a G7 head of government. At age 37, he was also the youngest prime minister in the history of France.\n\nHowever, following the June–July 2024 snap election, Attal resigned from the office. He will stay on until a new government can be formed.\n\nThe 2024 General Election in France\n\nThe most recent general elections in France took place in June–July 2024.\n\nThe snap election was called after President Macron dissolved the National Assembly following a significant loss in the 2024 European Parliament election. Mirroring trends around the world, the far-right populist party NR won this election by a landslide. By calling for a vote, Macron hoped that French voters would come to their senses and show that the far right could not win at a national level.\n\nMany analysts feared he would lose this high-risk political gamble. However, the French public shocked the world (and France) by electing the left-wing alliance NPF as their winner, with 26.3% of the votes. The NPF won 188 seats, a marked improvement from the 2022 election when they won 131 seats.\n\nOther voting results included:\n\nENS – 161 seats, suffering a tremendous loss of 76 seats (compared to the 2022 election)\n\nRN – 142 seats, winning an incredible 53 more seats than last time\n\nLR – 48 seats, losing 13 seats compared to last time\n\nOther – 38 seats, which is 21 less seats than in 2022\n\nThis puts France in an “uncertain, and unprecedented situation”. The country often finds itself in a situation that the French call ‘cohabitation‘, where the president and the parliament hail from different parties. This usually leads to political and decisional deadlocks, because of the difficulties in finding compromises.\n\nThis time, however, the election yielded no winning party with an outright majority, which requires 289 seats. As of this writing (July 2024), the country has not yet formed a new government.\n\nThe French electoral system\n\nFrench citizens vote in four types of elections:\n\nPresidential – every five years\n\nParliamentary – every five years\n\nEuropean Parliament – every five years\n\nLocal (e.g., regional, departmental, and municipal) – every six years\n\nFrance is one of only two European democracies – the other being the UK – that doesn’t use proportional representation in its national elections. Instead, the political landscape is decided using a two-round system.\n\nIn the first round, the top two candidates are elected using simple plurality. In the second round, the winner is chosen by the majority vote:\n\nDuring presidential elections, all parties can put forward a candidate if they get enough support. Likewise, independents can also stand for office. However, some parties, particularly the smaller ones, often choose to support candidates from other parties to ensure their ideology wins.\n\nIn parliamentary elections, 577 députés are elected in single-seat constituencies. Each citizen gets a single vote. Only candidates with the support of at least 12.5% of eligible (rather than actual) voters progress to round two. Again, in round two, the winner is the candidate with the majority vote.\n\nLocal elections in France are decided differently; these use a mixture of two-round and proportional representation voting.\n\nThe French public does not directly vote for the 348 members of the Senate. Instead, the lower house is selected by an electoral college of representatives from the 96 departments in metropolitan and overseas France.\n\nWho can vote in France?\n\nAll French citizens over the age of 18 can vote in French elections. That is, unless their civic rights have been taken away after a criminal conviction.\n\nEU citizens living in France may vote in local and European Parliament elections. Other foreign residents do not have voting rights.\n\nHow to vote in France\n\nVoter registration is automatic for French citizens over 18. However, EU nationals must register themselves. You can do this online or through your local town hall (mairie). You can check if you are registered to vote on the government’s public services website.\n\nFrench elections are always held on a Sunday. There are many polling stations (bureau de vote) across the country, and you’ll see signs for your local voting place.\n\nAt the polling station, you’ll need to show either your voter registration card or valid ID. You then receive a ballot paper (bulletin) and are directed to a curtained booth. If you’re unable to go to the voting station, you can also appoint a proxy. This must be someone from your municipality and you must arrange this in advance of Election Day.\n\nPolitical representation in France\n\nAnyone eligible to vote can stand for public office in France. This means that most French citizens can run for the National Assembly, while EU citizens can participate in local and European elections.\n\nInterestingly, France was one of the first countries in the world to introduce gender quotas to improve female political representation. Consequently, each party needs to put forward a candidate list consisting of 50% women in most elections. This has increased the number of women in power, with a record number of female MPs elected in 2017.\n\nIn the previous government (2022–2024), 36% of ministers and 36.2% of French Senators are women. This is above the European average of 31.5% and 31.3% respectively. Ethnic minority MPs made up 5.8% of the National Assembly. This is below the figure for minorities among the overall population, which is around 10%.\n\nThe political history of France\n\nFrance’s political system dates back to the French Revolution and the creation of the National Assembly in 1789. This was the beginning of modern-day democratic politics in the country.\n\nFrance had a tumultuous 19th century, alternating between a republic and monarchic rule. There was also a brief period in 1871 when a workers’ commune established direct democratic rule in Paris.\n\nThe Fifth Republic began under Charles De Gaulle in 1958. That year, France adopted a new constitution that introduced the current semi-presidential system and strengthened the powers of the French president.\n\nEarly presidents of the Fifth Republic ruled for seven-year terms; however, this was reduced to five years in 2000. After a 2008 constitutional reform, a maximum of two consecutive terms was imposed.\n\nWhile France has remained a stable democracy during the Fifth Republic, the French government has also experienced crisis periods. For example, the country saw the collapse of its overseas empire in the immediate post-war years, including a brutal war in Algeria. And in May 1968, a student revolt (Mai 68) almost ended the de Gaulle presidency.\n\nPolitical power in the French modern era has alternated between center-right and center-left governments and presidents, often involving the participation of the more fringe parties.\n\nFrance in the European Union\n\nFrance is one of the founding members of the EU, which was established in 1993. The country also joined the Eurozone in 1999, replacing its currency, the Franc, with the Euro.\n\nHowever, Euroscepticism is high, and the possibility of a future ‘Frexit’ (France exit) cannot be ruled out. In fact, several parties on both right and left support either leaving or severely reforming the EU. Furthermore, the anti-EU National Rally won the 2024 European elections in France with 31.4% of the vote.\n\nGrassroots politics and political activism in France\n\nFrance has a long-standing culture of grassroots activism and political protest, which has probably been a factor in the proliferation of French political parties over the years. Both the left and the right have been fairly effective at mobilizing citizens. There have been numerous protests against the previous government’s austerity measures, including over 100,000 taking to the streets in 2015.\n\nSince 2018, the so-called “yellow vests” (gilets jaunes) have also mobilized and protested regularly about a range of issues, including fuel tax and pension reforms. The movement is associated with the populist right in France, although it attracts citizens from across the political spectrum.\n\nClimate change is also inspiring citizen involvement. The global movement Extinction Rebellion is active in 14 areas of France. The country also held a Citizens’ Convention on Climate (Convention Citoyenne pour le Climat) in 2019–20, involving 150 citizens.\n\nWays to get involved in French politics or government issues include:\n\nYou can start or join a local activist group\n\nIf you are an EU citizen, you can get involved in local politics. This could involve attending municipal or communal meetings or even running for local office.\n\nIf you work in France, you could join a trade union. Although membership is on the decline, workers’ unions have a fair amount of political power and are good at mobilizing le peuple (the people)."
