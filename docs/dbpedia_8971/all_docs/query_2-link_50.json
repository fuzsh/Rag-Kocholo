        "text": "Please see our section on Adoptions from the United States for more information on the process for adopting a child from the United States. We urge prospective adoptive parents residing abroad who are considering adoption of a child from the United States to consult with France’s Central Authority, Mission de l'Adoption Internationale, for its determination as to whether it considers your adoption to be subject to the Convention.\n\nFrance is a party to the Hague Convention on Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption (Convention). Intercountry adoption processing in Convention countries must be done in accordance with the Convention; the Intercountry Adoption Act of 2000 (IAA); the IAA’s implementing regulations; and all applicable legislation and regulations of France.\n\nFrance is not considered a country of origin for intercountry adoption at this time. While adoption is legally possible, children from France are not generally placed for intercountry adoption. No children from France have received a U.S. immigrant visa based on an intercountry adoption in the past five fiscal years. The information provided is intended primarily to assist in extremely rare adoption cases from France, including adoptions of children from France by relatives in the United States, as well as adoptions from third countries by U.S. citizens living in France.\n\nProspective adoptive parents who are stationed overseas on U.S. military orders, posted overseas on U.S. government orders, or are private citizens living abroad are cautioned that the Convention may apply to an adoption completed in the United States, in the host country, and/or involving a child from a third country. We also strongly encourage such prospective adoptive parents to consult with the Central Authority of the country where they are physically residing, and/or where the child is residing, to determine whether the Convention applies to a proposed adoption.\n\nBelow is the limited adoption information the Department has obtained from the adoption authority of France. U.S. citizens interested in adopting children from France should contact the Central Authority of France to inquire about applicable laws and procedures. U.S. citizen prospective adoptive parents living in France who would like to adopt a child from the United States or from a third country should also contact France’s Central Authority. See contact information below.\n\nPlease visit the Department of State’s country page for more information on traveling to France and the U.S. Embassy in Paris’ website for information on consular services.\n\nThe consular officer will send a letter (referred to as an “Article 5/17 Letter”) to France’s Central Authority in any intercountry adoption involving U.S. citizen adoptive parents and a child from France if all Convention requirements are met and the child appears eligible to immigrate to the United States. This letter will inform the French Central Authority that the parents are suitable and eligible to adopt, that the child appears eligible to enter and reside permanently in the United States, and that the U.S. Central Authority agrees that the adoption may proceed.\n\nWarning: Do not attempt to adopt or obtain custody of a child in France before USICS has provisionally approved your Form I-800 petition AND a U.S. consular officer issues the “Article 5/17 Letter” for your adoption case.\n\nRemember: The consular officer will make a final decision about a child’s eligibility for an immigrant visa later in the adoption process.\n\nWARNING: France is party to the Hague Adoption Convention. Do not adopt or obtain legal custody of a child in France before a U.S. consular officer issues an \"Article 5 Letter.\" Read on for more information.\n\nFrance's Central Authority\n\nSince January 2009, the Central Authority for adoptions in France is the Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs.\n\nTHE PROCESS\n\nBecause France is party to the Hague Adoption Convention, adopting from France must follow a specific process designed to meet the Convention's requirements. A brief summary of the Convention adoption process is given below. You must complete these steps in the following order so that your adoption meets all necessary legal requirements.\n\nNOTE: The information provided is intended primarily to assist in rare adoption cases from France, including adoptions of French children by relatives in the United States, as well as adoptions from third countries by Americans living in France.\n\nChoose an Accredited Adoption Service Provider\n\nApply to be Found Eligible to Adopt\n\nBe Matched with a Child\n\nApply for the Child to be Found Eligible for Immigration to the United States\n\nAdopt the Child in France\n\nBring your Child Home\n\nChoose an Accredited Adoption Service Provider:\n\nThe first step in adopting a child from France is to select an adoption service provider in the United States that has been accredited. Only these agencies and attorneys can provide adoption services between the United States and France. We provide a list of Accredited Adoption Service Providers on our website.\n\nApply to be Found Eligible to Adopt:\n\nAfter you choose an accredited adoption service provider, you apply to be found eligible to adopt (Form I-800A) by the U.S. Government, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Eligibility Requirements.\n\nOnce the U.S. government determines that you are \"eligible\" and \"suitable\" to adopt, you or your agency will forward your information to the adoption authority in France. France's adoption authority will review your application to determine whether you are also eligible to adopt under France's law.\n\nBe Matched with a Child:\n\nIf both the United States and France determine that you are eligible to adopt, and a child is available for intercountry adoption, the central adoption authority in France may provide you with a referral for a child. Each family must decide for itself whether or not it will be able to meet the needs of the particular child and provide a permanent family placement for the referred child.\n\nApply for the Child to be Found Eligible for Adoption:\n\nAfter you accept a match with a child, you will apply to the U.S. Government, Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) for provisional approval to adopt that particular child (Form I-800). USCIS will determine whether the child is eligible under U.S. law to be adopted and enter the United States.\n\nAfter this, your adoption service provider or you will submit a visa application to a Consular Officer at the U.S. Embassy in Paris. The Consular Officer will review the child's information and evaluate the child for possible visa ineligibilities.\n\nIf the consular officer determines that the child appears eligible to immigrate to the United States, he or she will send a letter (an \"Article 5 Letter\") to the French Central Authority. Do not adopt or obtain custody of a child in France before a U.S. consular officer issues the Article 5 Letter.\n\nRemember: The Consular Officer will make a final decision about the immigrant visa later in the adoption process.\n\nAdopt the Child (or Gain Legal Custody) in France:\n\nRemember: Before you adopt (or gain legal custody of) a child in France, you must have completed the above four steps. Only after completing these steps can you proceed to finalize the adoption or grant of custody for the purposes of adoption in France.\n\nThe process for finalizing the adoption (or gaining legal custody) in France generally includes the following:\n\nROLE OF THE ADOPTION AUTHORITY: American citizens interested in or considering adopting a child in France should consult the website of the Agence Française de l'Adoption, provided in the section under \"Contact Information.\"\n\nROLE OF THE COURT: Prospective parents must file for adoption at the Tribunal de Grande Instance having jurisdiction over their place of residence. Although it is not mandatory, it is advisable to retain a lawyer. The court has six months to determine if the conditions for adoption have been respected and if the adoption is in the best interest of the child. Once adoption is granted, the prosecutor asks the city hall of the adoptee's place of birth to record the adoption. There is no indication of the biological parents.\n\nROLE OF ADOPTION AGENCIES: In cases of domestic adoption, prospective parents deal directly with social services. Other adoption agencies specialize in international adoption.\n\nTIME FRAME: Intercountry adoption in France is a lengthy process, sometimes taking several years. The domestic adoption process takes about a year on average.\n\nADOPTION APPLICATION: Necessary documents are generally prepared by an attorney.\n\nADOPTION FEES: There are no \"adoption fees\" in France but adopting parents often hire an attorney to assist them with the administrative and legal proceedings.\n\nDOCUMENTS REQUIRED: American citizens interested in or considering adopting a child in France or bringing a child to be adopted elsewhere to reside with them in France should consult the French government internet site provide above under Adoption Authority in France for information concerning documentary requirements.\n\nIMPORTANT VISA REQUIREMENTS IN ADOPTIONS FROM THIRD COUNTRIES: Americans who are legally resident in France but are considering adopting a child from a different country should first consult the country-specific information on adoption for that country. It is critical to remember, however, that in addition to meeting U.S. legal requirements, such children adopted from a third country must also have a French visa to enter and reside in France. Adopted children of a number of Americans have been denied entry into France because they did not have the appropriate French visas. Once in France, they will need to obtain a U.S. visa, if they choose to bring their child to the United States at a later time.\n\nNOTE: Additional documents may be requested. If you are asked to provide proof that a document from the United States is authentic, we can help. Read more on Traveling Abroad to learn about Authenticating U.S. Documents.\n\nBring Your Child Home\n\nOnce your adoption is complete (or you have obtained legal custody of the child), there are a few more steps to take before you can head home. Specifically, you need to apply for three documents for your child before he or she can travel to the United States:\n\nBirth Certificate\n\nYou will first need to apply for a new birth certificate for your child, so that you can later apply for a passport. Your name will be added to the new birth certificate.\n\nThe city hall of the adoptee's place of birth will issue a birth certificate with the names of the adoptive parents.\n\nFrench Passport\n\nYour child is not yet a U.S. citizen, so he/she will need a travel document or Passport from France. You can request a passport for your child at the city hall in Paris (Mairies d'Arrondissement) or at the prefectures and sous-préfectures outside Paris.\n\nU.S. Immigrant Visa\n\nAfter you obtain the new birth certificate and passport for your child, you also need to apply for a U.S. visa from the United States Embassy for your child. After the adoption (or custody for purpose of adoption) is granted, visit the U.S. Embassy for final review and approval of the child's I-800 petition and to obtain a visa for the child. This immigrant visa allows your child to travel home with you. As part of this process, the Consular Officer must be provided the \"Panel Physician's\" medical report on the child. Read more about the Medical Examination.\n\nCHILD CITIZENSHIP ACT\n\nFor adoptions finalized abroad: The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 allows your child to acquire American citizenship when he or she enters the United States as a lawful permanent resident.\n\nFor adoptions to be finalized in the United States: The Child Citizenship Act of 2000 allows your child to typically acquire American citizenship when the U.S. state court issues the final adoption decree. We urge your family to finalize the adoption in a U.S. State court as quickly as possible.\n\n*Please be aware that if your child did not qualify to become a citizen upon entry to the United States, it is very important that you take the steps necessary so that your child does qualify as soon as possible. Failure to obtain citizenship for your child can impact many areas of his/her life including family travel, eligibility for education and education grants, and voting.\n\nRead more about the Child Citizenship Act of 2000.\n\nAPPLYING FOR YOUR U.S. PASSPORT\n\nA valid U.S. passport is required to enter and leave France. Only the U.S. Department of State has the authority to grant, issue, or verify U.S. passports.\n\nGetting or renewing a passport is easy. The Passport Application Wizard will help you determine which passport form you need, help you to complete the form online, estimate your payment, and generate the form for you to print-all in one place.\n\nOBTAINING YOUR VISA\n\nIn addition to a U.S. passport, you may also need to obtain a visa. A visa is an official document issued by a foreign France that formally allows you to visit. Where required, visas are attached to your passport and allow you to enter a foreign nation.\n\nTo find information about obtaining a visa for France, see the Department of State's Country Specific Information.\n\nSTAYING SAFE ON YOUR TRIP\n\nBefore you travel, it's always a good practice to investigate the local conditions, laws, political landscape, and culture of the country. The State Department is a good place to start.\n\nThe Department of State provides Country Specific Information for every country of the world about various issues, including the health conditions, crime, unusual currency or entry requirements, and any areas of instability.\n\nSTAYING IN TOUCH ON YOUR TRIP\n\nWhen traveling during the adoption process, we encourage you to register your trip with the Department of State. Travel registration makes it possible to contact you if necessary. Whether there's a family emergency in the United States, or a crisis in France, registration assists the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in reaching you.\n\nRegistration is free and can be done online."
