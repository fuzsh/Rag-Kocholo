        "text": "When was the euro first introduced?\n\nMany of us probably have some euros stored away from the last time we went on holiday, but where else can this currency be used and what is its history?\n\nOn 1 January 1999, the euro came into the world. For the first three years, however, it was an ‘invisible’ currency and only used for accounting purposes and electronic payments.\n\nOn 1 January 2002, coins and banknotes were then launched in 12 EU countries including France, Italy and Ireland.\n\nHow many countries use the euro?\n\nAround 341 million people use the euro every day across 20 EU member countries.\n\nThese 20 countries are:\n\nAustria\n\nBelgium\n\nCroatia\n\nCyprus\n\nEstonia\n\nFinland\n\nFrance\n\nGermany\n\nGreece\n\nIreland\n\nItaly\n\nLatvia\n\nLithuania\n\nLuxembourg\n\nMalta\n\nthe Netherlands\n\nPortugal\n\nSlovakia\n\nSlovenia\n\nSpain\n\nThe euro is also used in non-EU member countries, including:\n\nAndorra\n\nMonaco\n\nMontenegro\n\nSan Marino\n\nVatican City\n\nKosovo\n\nThere are non-EU member countries in the process of adopting the euro, which is the second-largest and second-most-traded currency globally (behind the US dollar).\n\nThese countries are:\n\nBulgaria\n\nCzech Republic\n\nHungary\n\nPoland\n\nRomania\n\nSweden\n\nVisit Christmas markets in Europe. Use our guide to learn more about the best Christmas markets to visit this winter.\n\nOur euro exchange rate\n\nIf you’re travelling to any of the above countries soon (that currently accept the euro), one of the jobs on your to-do list will probably include money exchange.\n\nWith M&S bank, you can buy euros online or in store. Once you’ve returned from holiday you can also sell back your euros to us. We’ll buy them back at the buy back rate available that day.\n\nUpdated June 2023"
