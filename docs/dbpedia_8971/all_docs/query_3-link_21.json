        "text": "Did you know that there are European countries that don't use the euro? Of the 27 nations that make up the European Union (EU), 20 use the euro as their official currency, in the region known as the Eurozone. While most countries that join the EU are required to adopt the euro as part of their membership, there are seven member states that have yet to adopt the currency.\n\nOf course, there are pros and cons for an EU-member country using a currency specific to their own economy. As far as advantages go, such a country is able to more fully dictate its own financial and monetary policies, without being beholden to the larger group. They can adjust exchange rates and interest rates, for example, to suit their economic needs. Furthermore, a country with its own currency avoids the liabilities associated with being part of a larger currency union. If a financial crisis affects the euro, these seven European countries that don't use the euro will be spared from the brunt of it.\n\nFor travelers, this variation in exchange rates could be useful to know. If you want to visit a European country and want your dollar or pound or peso to stretch even further, you might head to a destination with a more favorable currency conversion. Here’s a list of the non-eurozone EU member countries.\n\nBulgaria\n\nWith glacial lakes, spectacular mountain ranges, a coastline along the Black Sea and fascinating historical monuments, Bulgaria is developing into an attractive holiday destination in Europe.\n\nCurrency: Bulgarian Lev (BGN) (1 BGN = 0.54 USD)\n\nWhere to stay: Kempinski Hotel Grand Arena Bansko\n\nCzech Republic\n\nLocated in Central Europe, the Czech Republic has the highest concentration of castles in the continent, some dating back to the 1300s, making it a paradise for architecture and history enthusiasts. Plus, Prague, the Czech capital, is home to the world’s largest castle complex. The country is also famed for its tradition of brewing beer, which began as early as 993 AD.\n\nCurrency: Czech Koruna (CZK) (1 CZK = 0.043 USD)\n\nWhere to stay: Augustine, a Luxury Collection Hotel, Prague\n\nDenmark\n\nDenmark may be the smallest of Northern Europe’s Scandinavian countries, but it’s big on gourmet food, culture, design, and wellness.\n\nCurrency: Danish Krone (DKK) (1 DKK = 0.14 USD)\n\nWhere to stay: Villa Copenhagen\n\nHungary\n\nDespite its modest size, the nation has a number of UNESCO Biosphere Reserves, the world’s second-largest thermal lake (Lake Hévz), the largest lake in Central Europe (Lake Balaton), and the largest natural grassland in Europe (Hortobágy). The Hungarian capital, Budapest, is also considered one of the most beautiful cities worldwide.\n\nCurrency: Hungarian Forint (HUF) (1 HUF = 0.0028 USD)\n\nWhere to stay: Four Seasons Hotel Gresham Palace Budapest\n\nPoland\n\nLocated in the heart of Europe, Poland draws history buffs, with plenty of medieval castles. There are also museums steeped in Second World War history, such as the Auschwitz-Birkenau Museum, the Warsaw Uprising Museum, and the POLIN Museum of the History of Polish Jews.\n\nCurrency: Polish Zloty (PLN) (1 PLN = 0.24 USD)\n\nWhere to stay: Mamaison Hotel Le Regina\n\nRomania\n\nThe largest of the Balkan countries, Romania has charming villages, dramatic castles, and some of Europe's most stunning natural landscapes. A paradise for birdwatchers, the Danube Delta is one of the best preserved on the continent, while the spectacular Scărișoara is Europe’s second-largest underground glacier.\n\nCurrency: Romanian Leu (RON) (1 RON = 0.21 USD)\n\nWhere to stay: Carol Parc Hotel\n\nSweden\n\nThis Scandinavian beauty boasts one of the strongest and most stable economies in Europe. Sweden also happens to be the perfect country where you can watch one of nature’s greatest spectacles—the Northern Lights—or stay up all night under the midnight sun.\n\nCurrency: Swedish Krona (SEK) (1 SEK = 0.089 USD)\n\nWhere to stay: Grand Hôtel Stockholm"
