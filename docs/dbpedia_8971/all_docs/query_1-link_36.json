        "text": "The central bank in Europe is called the European Central Bank (ECB). Currently, 17 EU member states have adopted the Euro. It is the second-most traded currency on the forex market, after the US Dollar, and also a major global reserve currency. Other common names for the Euro include Yoyo (Irish English), Leru (Spanish), and Ege (Finnish).\n\nIntroduction of the Euro\n\nOn January 1, 1999, the Euro (EUR) was introduced as an account currency, replacing the European Currency Unit at par. The European Currency Unit was a theoretical basket of currencies rather than a physical currency in and of itself. Initially, eleven of the countries in the European Economic and Monetary Union replaced their own currencies with the Euro: Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Spain. Greece followed suit in 2001, Slovenia in 2007, Malta and Cyprus in 2008, Slovakia in 2009 and Latvia in 2014.\n\nUse of the Euro outside the EU\n\nA number of sovereign states that are not part of the European Union have since adopted the Euro, including the Principality of Andorra, the Principality of Monaco, the Republic of San Marino, and the Vatican City. The Euro is also used in many territories, departments, and sovereign states of Euro-zone countries, such as the Azores, Balearic Islands, the Canary Islands, Europa Island, French Guiana, Guadeloupe, Juan de Nova, the Madeira Islands, Martinique, Mayotte, Reunion, Saint-Martin, Saint Pierre and Miquelon, to name just a few. The Euro is used as a trading currency in Cuba, North Korea, and Syria and several currencies are pegged to it.\n\nCurrency Peg Rate Bosnia and Herzegovina Convertible Mark 1.95583 Bulgarian Lev 1.95583 Cape Verdean Escudo 110.265 Central African CFA Franc BEAC 655.957 CFA Franc 655.957 CFP Franc 119.3317 Comoran Franc 491.9678 Lithuanian Litas 3.45280\n\nValue of Obsolete National Currencies\n\nEuro bank notes and coins began circulating in 2002 with old notes and coins gradually being withdrawn from circulation.

Some old currencies are still physically convertible at special locations. For details, refer to the official ECB site listed in the Relevant Links section below.\n\nSpelling and Capitalization\n\nThe official spelling of the EUR currency unit is \"euro\", with a lower case \"e\"; however, the common industry practice is to spell it \"Euro\", with a capital \"E\". Many languages have different official spellings for the Euro, which also may or may not coincide with general use. Additionally, there are various nicknames for the currency including, Ege (Finnish), Pavo (Spanish), and Euráče (Slovak).\n\nRelevant Links\n\nFor more information on the EUR, we encourage you to visit the links below, particularly the European Central Bank. These sites include recent news on the Euro as well as issues like implementation, spelling, legislation, and more."
