        "text": "All the countries in the world have a different unit of currency with which they transact business activities and trade. This creates the harmonious exchange of service, goods and property in terms of value and preference. The Euro (€) is the most substantial pointer of integration economically speaking in Europe i.e. The European Union. It is mostly used in the Eurozone and its territories. Having the Euro used as legal tender officially by the member countries of the European Union offers individuals travelling to these countries obvious benefits such as the elimination of the cost of currency conversion.\n\nIntroduced on January 1, 1999, the Euro was one of the greatest steps towards economic integration of the European Union.

The Euro banknotes are in seven denominations i.e. €5 which is grey in colour, €10 which is red in colour, €20 which is blue in colour, €50, its colour being orange, €100, a green banknote, €200 which is coloured yellow and €500 which is purple coloured.\n\nThe Euro coin has a total of 8 denominations: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20 and 50 cents, €1 and €2.

Having this single currency has also eliminated uncertainty over exchange rate as this is one of the problems of trading with other countries and their currencies.\n\nThe Euro offers more choice and stable prices for consumers and citizens in addition to offering greater security and vast opportunities to firms and markets. It has also led to increased economic stability and substantive growth.\n\nJoining the Euro area\n\nThe process of a non-European Union member planning to use the Euro is carefully done before one is allowed to use the currency. A country planning to join the union must harmonize many aspects of its society economically, socially and politically with those of EU member states. Much of this orientation is aimed at ensuring that an accession country can operate comfortably within the union’s single market for goods, services, capital and labour. Adopting the use, furthermore, needs extensive legal frameworks and political alignment for a smoother transition.\n\nThe Euro is a tangible sign of European identity and has provided the European Union with a stronger presence in the global economy, something only other regional economic blocs envy. This not only makes the countries that use Euro revered but also respected in the financial sphere.\n\nREAD ALSO: How to use Ecobank Internet Banking\n\nSource: YEN.com.gh"
