        "text": "Title II - The President of the Republic\n\nArticle 5\n\nThe President of the Republic shall ensure due respect for the Constitution. He shall ensure, by his arbitration, the proper functioning of the public authorities and the continuity of the State.\n\nHe shall be the guarantor of national independence, territorial integrity and due respect for Treaties.\n\nArticle 6\n\nThe President of the Republic shall be elected for a term of five years by direct universal suffrage.\n\nNo one may carry out more than two consecutive terms of office.\n\nThe manner of implementation of this article shall be determined by an Institutional Act.\n\nArticle 7\n\nThe President of the Republic shall be elected by an absolute majority of votes cast. If such a majority is not obtained on the first ballot, a second ballot shall take place on the fourteenth day thereafter. Only the two candidates polling the greatest number of votes in the first ballot, after any withdrawal of better placed candidates, may stand in the second ballot.\n\nThe process of electing a President shall commence by the calling of said election by the Government.\n\nThe election of the new President shall be held no fewer than twenty days and no more than thirty-five days before the expiry of the term of the President in office.\n\nShould the Presidency of the Republic fall vacant for any reason whatsoever, or should the Constitutional Council on a referral from the Government rule by an absolute majority of its members that the President of the Republic is incapacitated, the duties of the President of the Republic, with the exception of those specified in articles 11 and 12, shall be temporarily exercised by the President of the Senate or, if the latter is in turn incapacitated, by the Government.\n\nIn the case of a vacancy, or where the incapacity of the President is declared to be permanent by the Constitutional Council, elections for the new President shall, except in the event of a finding by the Constitutional Council of force majeure, be held no fewer than twenty days and no more than thirty-five days after the beginning of the vacancy or the declaration of permanent incapacity.\n\nIn the event of the death or incapacitation in the seven days preceding the deadline for registering candidacies of any of the persons who, fewer than thirty days prior to such deadline, have publicly announced their decision to stand for election, the Constitutional Council may decide to postpone the election.\n\nIf, before the first round of voting, any of the candidates dies or becomes incapacitated, the Constitutional Council shall declare the election to be postponed...\n\nIn the event of the death or incapacitation of either of the two candidates in the lead after the first round of voting before any withdrawals, the Constitutional Council shall declare that the electoral process must be repeated in full; the same shall apply in the event of the death or incapacitation of either of the two candidates still standing on the second round of voting.\n\nAll cases shall be referred to the Constitutional Council in the manner laid down in the second paragraph of article 61 or in that laid down for the registration of candidates in the Institutional Act provided for in article 6.\n\nThe Constitutional Council may extend the time limits set in paragraphs three and five above, provided that polling takes place no later than thirty-five days after the decision of the Constitutional Council. If the implementation of the provisions of this paragraph results in the postponement of the election beyond the expiry of the term of the President in office, the latter shall remain in office until his successor is proclaimed.\n\nNeither articles 49 and 50 nor article 89 of the Constitution shall be implemented during the vacancy of the Presidency of the Republic or during the period between the declaration of the permanent incapacity of the President of the Republic and the election of his successor.\n\nArticle 8\n\nThe President of the Republic shall appoint the Prime Minister. He shall terminate the appointment of the Prime Minister when the latter tenders the resignation of the Government.\n\nOn the recommendation of the Prime Minister, he shall appoint the other members of the Government and terminate their appointments.\n\nArticle 9\n\nThe President of the Republic shall preside over the Council of Ministers.\n\nArticle 10\n\nThe President of the Republic shall promulgate Acts of Parliament within fifteen days following the final passage of an Act and its transmission to the Government.\n\nHe may, before the expiry of this time limit, ask Parliament to reopen debate on the Act or any sections thereof. Such reopening of debate shall not be refused.\n\nArticle 11\n\nThe President of the Republic may, on a recommendation from the Government when Parliament is in session, or on a joint motion of the two Houses, published in the Journal Officiel, submit to a referendum any Government Bill which deals with the organization of the public authorities, or with reforms relating to the economic, social or environmental policy of the Nation, and to the public services contributing thereto, or which provides for authorization to ratify a treaty which, although not contrary to the Constitution, would affect the functioning of the institutions.\n\nWhere the referendum is held on the recommendation of the Government, the latter shall make a statement before each House and the same shall be followed by a debate.\n\nA referendum concerning a subject mentioned in the first paragraph may be held upon the initiative of one fifth of the members of Parliament, supported by one tenth of the voters enrolled on the electoral lists. This initiative shall take the form of a Private Members' Bill and may not be applied to the repeal of a legislative provision promulgated for less than one year.\n\nThe conditions by which it is introduced and those according to which the Constitutional Council monitors the respect of the provisions of the previous paragraph, are set down by an Institutional Act.\n\nIf the Private Members' Bill has not been considered by the two Houses within a period set by the Institutional Act, the President of the Republic may submit it to a referendum.\n\nWhere the Private Members' Bill is not passed by the French people, no new referendum proposal on the same subject may be submitted before the end of a period of two years following the date of the vote.\n\nWhere the outcome of the referendum is favourable to the Government Bill or to the Private Members' Bill, the President of the Republic shall promulgate the resulting statute within fifteen days following the proclamation of the results of the vote.\n\nArticle 12\n\nThe President of the Republic may, after consulting the Prime Minister and the Presidents of the Houses of Parliament, declare the National Assembly dissolved.\n\nA general election shall take place no fewer than twenty days and no more than forty days after the dissolution.\n\nThe National Assembly shall sit as of right on the second Thursday following its election. Should this sitting fall outside the period prescribed for the ordinary session, a session shall be convened by right for a fifteen-day period.\n\nNo further dissolution shall take place within a year following said election.\n\nArticle 13\n\nThe President of the Republic shall sign the Ordinances and Decrees deliberated upon in the Council of Ministers.\n\nHe shall make appointments to the civil and military posts of the State.\n\nConseillers d'État, the Grand Chancelier de la Légion d'Honneur, Ambassadors and Envoys Extraordinary, Conseillers Maitres of the Cour des Comptes, Prefects, State representatives in the overseas communities to which article 74 applies and in New Caledonia, highest-ranking Military Officers, Recteurs des Académies and Directors of Central Government Departments shall be appointed in the Council of Ministers.\n\nAn Institutional Act shall determine the other posts to be filled at meetings of the Council of Ministers and the manner in which the power of the President of the Republic to make appointments may be delegated by him to be exercised on his behalf.\n\nAn Institutional Act shall determine the posts or positions, other than those mentioned in the third paragraph, concerning which, on account of their importance in the guarantee of the rights and freedoms or the economic and social life of the Nation, the power of appointment of the President of the Republic shall be exercised after public consultation with the relevant standing committee in each assembly. The President of the Republic may not make an appointment when the sum of the negative votes in each committee represents at least three fifths of the votes cast by the two committees. Statutes shall determine the relevant standing committees according to the posts or positions concerned.\n\nArticle 14\n\nThe President of the Republic shall accredit ambassadors and envoys extraordinary to foreign powers; foreign ambassadors and envoys extraordinary shall be accredited to him.\n\nArticle 15\n\nThe President of the Republic shall be Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces. He shall preside over the higher national defence councils and committees.\n\nArticle 16\n\nWhere the institutions of the Republic, the independence of the Nation, the integrity of its territory or the fulfilment of its international commitments are under serious and immediate threat, and where the proper functioning of the constitutional public authorities is interrupted, the President of the Republic shall take measures required by these circumstances, after formally consulting the Prime Minister, the Presidents of the Houses of Parliament and the Constitutional Council.\n\nHe shall address the Nation and inform it of such measures.\n\nThe measures shall be designed to provide the constitutional public authorities as swiftly as possible, with the means to carry out their duties. The Constitutional Council shall be consulted with regard to such measures.\n\nParliament shall sit as of right.\n\nThe National Assembly shall not be dissolved during the exercise of such emergency powers.\n\nAfter thirty days of the exercise of such emergency powers, the matter may be referred to the Constitutional Council by the President of the National Assembly, the President of the Senate, sixty Members of the National Assembly or sixty Senators, so as to decide if the conditions laid down in paragraph one still apply. It shall make its decision by public announcement as soon as possible. It shall, as of right, carry out such an examination and shall make its decision in the same manner after sixty days of the exercise of emergency powers or at any moment thereafter.\n\nArticle 17\n\nThe President of the Republic is vested with the power to grant pardons in an individual capacity.\n\nArticle 18\n\nThe President of the Republic shall communicate with the two Houses of Parliament by messages which he shall cause to be read aloud and which shall not give rise to any debate.\n\nHe may take the floor before Parliament convened in Congress for this purpose. His statement may give rise, in his absence, to a debate without vote.\n\nWhen not in session, the Houses of Parliament shall be convened especially for this purpose.\n\nArticle 19\n\nInstruments of the President of the Republic, other than those provided for under articles 8 (paragraph one), 11, 12, 16, 18, 54, 56 and 61, shall be countersigned by the Prime Minister and, where required, by the ministers concerned.\n\nTitle V - On relations between parliament and the government\n\nArticle 34\n\nStatutes shall determine the rules concerning :\n\ncivic rights and the fundamental guarantees granted to citizens for the exercise of their civil liberties; freedom, pluralism and the independence of the media; the obligations imposed for the purposes of national defence upon the person and property of citizens.\n\nnationality, the status and capacity of persons, matrimonial property systems, inheritance and gifts\n\nthe determination of serious crimes and other major offences and the penalties they carry; criminal procedure; amnesty; the setting up of new categories of courts and the status of members of the Judiciary.\n\nthe base, rates and methods of collection of all types of taxes; the issuing of currency.\n\nStatutes shall also determine the rules governing :\n\nthe system for electing members of the Houses of Parliament, local assemblies and the representative bodies for French nationals living abroad, as well as the conditions for holding elective offices and positions for the members of the deliberative assemblies of the territorial communities\n\nthe setting up of categories of public legal entities\n\nthe fundamental guarantees granted to civil servants and members of the Armed Forces\n\nnationalisation of companies and the transfer of ownership of companies from the public to the private sector.\n\nStatutes shall also lay down the basic principles of :\n\nthe general organisation of national defence\n\nthe self-government of territorial communities, their powers and revenue\n\neducation\n\nthe preservation of the environment\n\nsystems of ownership, property rights and civil and commercial obligations.\n\nEmployment law, Trade Union law and Social Security.\n\nFinance Acts shall determine the revenue and expenditure of the State in the conditions and with the reservations provided for by an Institutional Act.\n\nSocial Security Financing Acts shall lay down the general conditions for the financial equilibrium thereof, and taking into account forecasted revenue, shall determine expenditure targets in the conditions and with the reservations provided for by an Institutional Act.\n\nProgramming Acts shall determine the objectives of the action of the State.\n\nThe multiannual guidelines for public finances shall be established by Programming Acts. They shall be part of the objective of balanced accounts for public administrations.\n\nThe provisions of this article may be further specified and completed by an Institutional Act.\n\nArticle 34-1\n\nThe Houses of Parliament may adopt resolutions according to the conditions determined by the Institutional Act.\n\nAny draft resolution, whose adoption or rejection would be considered by the Government as an issue of confidence, or which contained an injunction to the Government, shall be inadmissible and may not be included on the agenda.\n\nArticle 35\n\nA declaration of war shall be authorized by Parliament.\n\nThe Government shall inform Parliament of its decision to have the armed forces intervene abroad, at the latest three days after the beginning of said intervention. It shall detail the objectives of the said intervention. This information may give rise to a debate, which shall not be followed by a vote.\n\nWhere the said intervention shall exceed four months, the Government shall submit the extension to Parliament for authorization. It may ask the National Assembly to make the final decision.\n\nIf Parliament is not sitting at the end of the four-month period, it shall express its decision at the opening of the following session.\n\nArticle 36\n\nA state of siege shall be decreed in the Council of Ministers.\n\nThe extension thereof after a period of twelve days may be authorized solely by Parliament.\n\nArticle 37\n\nMatters other than those coming under the scope of statute law shall be matters for regulation.\n\nProvisions of statutory origin enacted in such matters may be amended by decree issued after consultation with the Conseil d'État. Any such provisions passed after the coming into force of the Constitution shall be amended by decree only if the Constitutional Council has found that they are matters for regulation as defined in the foregoing paragraph.\n\nArticle 37-1\n\nStatutes and regulations may contain provisions enacted on an experimental basis for limited purposes and duration.\n\nArticle 38\n\nIn order to implement its programme, the Government may ask Parliament for authorization, for a limited period, to take measures by Ordinance that are normally the preserve of statute law.\n\nOrdinances shall be issued in the Council of Ministers, after consultation with the Conseil d'État. They shall come into force upon publication, but shall lapse in the event of failure to table before Parliament the Bill to ratify them by the date set by the Enabling Act. They may only be ratified in explicit terms.\n\nAt the end of the period referred to in the first paragraph hereinabove Ordinances may be amended solely by an Act of Parliament in those areas governed by statute law.\n\nArticle 39\n\nBoth the Prime Minister and Members of Parliament shall have the right to initiate legislation.\n\nGovernment Bills shall be discussed in the Council of Ministers after consultation with the Conseil d'État and shall be tabled in one or other of the two Houses. Finance Bills and Social Security Financing Bills shall be tabled first before the National Assembly. Without prejudice to the first paragraph of article 44, Bills primarily dealing with the organisation of territorial communities shall be tabled first in the Senate.\n\nThe presentation of Government Bills tabled before the National Assembly or the Senate, shall follow the conditions determined by an Institutional Act.\n\nGovernment Bills may not be included on the agenda if the Conference of Presidents of the first House to which the bill has been referred, declares that the rules determined by the Institutional Act have been ignored. In the case of disagreement between the Conference of Presidents and the Government, the President of the relevant House or the Prime Minister may refer the matter to the Constitutional Council, which shall rule within a period of eight days.\n\nWithin the conditions provided for by statute, the President of either House may submit a Private Members' Bill tabled by a member of the said House, before it is considered in committee, to the Conseil d'État for its opinion, unless the member who tabled it disagrees.\n\nArticle 40\n\nPrivate Members' Bills and amendments introduced by Members of Parliament shall not be admissible where their enactment would result in either a diminution of public revenue or the creation or increase of any public expenditure.\n\nArticle 41\n\nIf, during the legislative process, it appears that a Private Member's Bill or amendment is not a matter for statute or is contrary to a delegation granted under article 38, the Government or the President of the House concerned, may argue that it is inadmissible.\n\nIn the event of disagreement between the Government and the President of the House concerned, the Constitutional Council, at the request of one or the other, shall give its ruling within eight days.\n\nArticle 42\n\nThe discussion of Government and Private Members' Bills shall, in plenary sitting, concern the text passed by the committee to which the Bill has been referred, in accordance with article 43, or failing that, the text which has been referred to the House.\n\nNotwithstanding the foregoing, the plenary discussion of Constitutional Revision Bills, Finance Bills and Social Security Financing Bills, shall concern, during the first reading before the House to which the Bill has been referred in the first instance, the text presented by the Government, and during the subsequent readings, the text transmitted by the other House.\n\nThe plenary discussion at first reading of a Government or Private Members' Bill may only occur before the first House to which it is referred, at the end of a period of six weeks after it has been tabled. It may only occur, before the second House to which it is referred, at the end of a period of four weeks, from the date of transmission.\n\nThe previous paragraph shall not apply if the accelerated procedure has been implemented according to the conditions provided for in article 45. It shall not apply either to Finance Bills, Social Security Financing Bills, or to bills concerning a state of emergency.\n\nArticle 43\n\nGovernment and Private Members' Bills shall be referred to one of the standing committees, the number of which shall not exceed eight in each House.\n\nAt the request of the Government or of the House before which such a Bill has been tabled, Government and Private Members' Bills shall be referred for consideration to a committee specially set up for this purpose.\n\nArticle 44\n\nMembers of Parliament and the Government shall have the right of amendment. This right may be used in plenary sitting or in committee under the conditions set down by the Rules of Procedure of the Houses, according to the framework determined by an Institutional Act.\n\nOnce debate has begun, the Government may object to the consideration of any amendment which has not previously been referred to committee.\n\nIf the Government so requests, the House before which the Bill is tabled shall proceed to a single vote on all or part of the text under debate, on the sole basis of the amendments proposed or accepted by the Government.\n\nArticle 45\n\nEvery Government or Private Member's Bill shall be considered successively in the two Houses of Parliament with a view to the passing of an identical text. Without prejudice to the application of articles 40 and 41, all amendments which have a link, even an indirect one, with the text that was tabled or transmitted, shall be admissible on first reading.\n\nIf, as a result of a failure to agree by the two Houses, it has proved impossible to pass a Government or Private Member's Bill after two readings by each House or, if the Government has decided to apply the accelerated procedure without the two Conferences of Presidents being jointly opposed, after a single reading of such Bill by each House, the Prime Minister, or in the case of a Private Members' Bill, the Presidents of the two Houses acting jointly, may convene a joint committee, composed of an equal number of members from each House, to propose a text on the provisions still under debate.\n\nThe text drafted by the joint committee may be submitted by the Government to both Houses for approval. No amendment shall be admissible without the consent of the Government.\n\nIf the joint committee fails to agree on a common text, or if the text is not passed as provided in the foregoing paragraph, the Government may, after a further reading by the National Assembly and by the Senate, ask the National Assembly to reach a final decision. In such an event, the National Assembly may reconsider either the text drafted by the joint committee, or the last text passed by itself, as modified, as the case may be, by any amendment(s) passed by the Senate.\n\nArticle 46\n\nActs of Parliament which are defined by the Constitution as being Institutional Acts shall be enacted and amended as provided for hereinafter.\n\nThe Government or Private Member's Bill may only be submitted, on first reading, to the consideration and vote of the Houses after the expiry of the periods set down in the third paragraph of article 42. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the accelerated procedure has been applied according to the conditions provided for in article 45, the Government or Private Member's Bill may not be submitted for consideration by the first House to which it is referred before the expiry of a fifteen-day period after it has been tabled.\n\nThe procedure set out in article 45 shall apply. Nevertheless, failing agreement between the two Houses, the text may be passed by the National Assembly on a final reading only by an absolute majority of the Members thereof.\n\nInstitutional Acts relating to the Senate must be passed in identical terms by the two Houses.\n\nInstitutional Acts shall not be promulgated until the Constitutional Council has declared their conformity with the Constitution.\n\nArticle 47\n\nParliament shall pass Finance Bills in the manner provided for by an Institutional Act.\n\nShould the National Assembly fail to reach a decision on first reading within forty days following the tabling of a Bill, the Government shall refer the Bill to the Senate, which shall make its decision known within fifteen days. The procedure set out in article 45 shall then apply.\n\nShould Parliament fail to reach a decision within seventy days, the provisions of the Bill may be brought into force by Ordinance.\n\nShould the Finance Bill setting out revenue and expenditure for a financial year not be tabled in time for promulgation before the beginning of that year, the Government shall as a matter of urgency ask Parliament for authorization to collect taxes and shall make available by decree the funds needed to meet commitments already voted for.\n\nThe time limits set by this article shall be suspended when Parliament is not in session.\n\nArticle 47-1\n\nParliament shall pass Social Security Financing Bills in the manner provided by an Institutional Act.\n\nShould the National Assembly fail to reach a decision on first reading within twenty days of the tabling of a Bill, the Government shall refer the Bill to the Senate, which shall make its decision known within fifteen days. The procedure set out in article 45 shall then apply.\n\nShould Parliament fail to reach a decision within fifty days, the provisions of the Bill may be implemented by Ordinance.\n\nThe time limits set by this article shall be suspended when Parliament is not in session and, as regards each House, during the weeks when it has decided not to sit in accordance with the second paragraph of article 28.\n\nArticle 47-2\n\nThe Cour des Comptes shall assist Parliament in monitoring Government action. It shall assist Parliament and the Government in monitoring the implementation of Finance Acts and Social Security Financing Acts, as well in assessing public policies.

Any other territorial community created, if need be, to replace one or more communities provided for by this paragraph shall be created by statute.\n\nTerritorial communities may take decisions in all matters arising under powers that can best be exercised at their level.\n\nIn the conditions provided for by statute, these communities shall be self-governing through elected councils and shall have power to make regulations for matters coming within their jurisdiction.\n\nIn the manner provided for by an Institutional Act, except where the essential conditions for the exercise of public freedoms or of a right guaranteed by the Constitution are affected, territorial communities or associations thereof may, where provision is made by statute or regulation, as the case may be, derogate on an experimental basis for limited purposes and duration from provisions laid down by statute or regulation governing the exercise of their powers.\n\nNo territorial community may exercise authority over another. However, where the exercising of a power requires the combined action of several territorial communities, one of those communities or one of their associations may be authorised by statute to organise such combined action.\n\nIn the territorial communities of the Republic, the State representative, representing each of the Members of the Government, shall be responsible for national interests, administrative supervision and compliance with the law.\n\nArticle 72-1\n\nThe conditions in which voters in each territorial community may use their right of petition to ask for a matter within the powers of the community to be entered on the agenda of its Deliberative Assembly shall be determined by statute.\n\nIn the conditions determined by an Institutional Act, draft decisions or acts within the powers of a territorial community may, on the initiative of the latter, be submitted for a decision by voters of said community by means of a referendum.\n\nWhen the creation of a special-status territorial community or modification of its organisation are contemplated, a decision may be taken by statute to consult the voters registered in the relevant communities. Voters may also be consulted on changes to the boundaries of territorial communities in the conditions determined by statute.\n\nArticle 72-2\n\nTerritorial communities shall enjoy revenue of which they may dispose freely in the conditions determined by statute.\n\nThey may receive all or part of the proceeds of taxes of all kinds. They may be authorised by statute to determine the basis of assessment and the rates thereof, within the limits set by such statutes.\n\nTax revenue and other own revenue of territorial communities shall, for each category of territorial community, represent a decisive share of their revenue. The conditions for the implementation of this rule shall be determined by an Institutional Act.\n\nWhenever powers are transferred between central government and the territorial communities, revenue equivalent to that given over to the exercise of those powers shall also be transferred. Whenever the effect of newly created or extended powers is to increase the expenditure to be borne by territorial communities, revenue as determined by statute shall be allocated to said communities.\n\nEqualisation mechanisms intended to promote equality between territorial communities shall be provided for by statute.\n\nArticle 72-3\n\nThe Republic shall recognise the overseas populations within the French people in a common ideal of liberty, equality and fraternity.\n\nGuadeloupe, Guyane, Martinique, La Réunion, Mayotte, Saint-Barthélemy, Saint-Martin, Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon, the Wallis and Futuna Islands and French Polynesia shall be governed by article 73 as regards overseas departments and regions and for the territorial communities set up under the final paragraph of article 73, and by article 74 for the other communities.\n\nThe status of New Caledonia shall be governed by title XIII.\n\nThe legislative system and special organisation of the French Southern and Antarctic Territories and Clipperton shall be determined by statute.\n\nArticle 72-4\n\nNo change of status as provided for by articles 73 and 74 with respect to the whole or part of any one of the communities to which the second paragraph of article 72-3 applies, shall take place without the prior consent of voters in the relevant community or part of a community being sought in the manner provided for by the paragraph below. Such change of status shall be made by an Institutional Act.\n\nThe President of the Republic may, on a recommendation from the Government when Parliament is in session or on a joint motion of the two Houses, published in either case in the Journal Officiel, decide to consult voters in an overseas territorial community on a question relating to its organisation, its powers or its legislative system. Where the referendum concerns a change of status as provided for by the foregoing paragraph and is held in response to a recommendation by the Government, the Government shall make a statement before each House which shall be followed by debate.\n\nArticle 73\n\nIn the overseas departments and regions, statutes and regulations shall be automatically applicable. They may be adapted in the light of the specific characteristics and constraints of such communities.\n\nThose adaptations may be decided on by the communities in areas in which their powers are exercised if the relevant communities have been empowered to that end by statute or by regulation, whichever is the case.\n\nBy way of derogation from the first paragraph hereof and in order to take account of their specific features, communities to which this article applies may be empowered by statute or by regulation, whichever is the case, to determine themselves the rules applicable in their territory in a limited number of matters that fall to be determined by statute or by regulation.\n\nThese rules may not concern nationality, civic rights, the guarantees of civil liberties, the status and capacity of persons, the organisation of justice, criminal law, criminal procedure, foreign policy, defence, public security and public order, currency, credit and exchange, or electoral law.

They may not be conferred where the essential conditions for the exercise of civil liberties or of a right guaranteed by the Constitution are affected.\n\nThe setting up by statute of a territorial community to replace an overseas department and region or a single Deliberative Assembly for the two communities shall not be carried out unless the consent of the voters registered there has first been sought as provided by the second paragraph of article 72-4.\n\nArticle 74\n\nThe Overseas territorial communities to which this article applies shall have a status reflecting their respective local interests within the Republic.\n\nThis status shall be determined by an Institutional Act, passed after consultation of the Deliberative Assembly, which shall specify:\n\nthe conditions in which statutes and regulations shall apply there;\n\nthe powers of the territorial community; subject to those already exercised by said community the transfer of central government powers may not involve any of the matters listed in paragraph four of article 73, as specified and completed, if need be, by an Institutional Act\n\nthe rules governing the organisation and operation of the institutions of the territorial community and the electoral system for its Deliberative Assembly\n\nthe conditions in which its institutions are consulted on Government or Private Members' Bills and draft Ordinances or draft Decrees containing provisions relating specifically to the community and to the ratification or approval of international undertakings entered into in matters within its powers.\n\nThe Institutional Act may also, for such territorial communities as are self-governing, determine the conditions in which:\n\nthe Conseil d'État shall exercise specific judicial review of certain categories of decisions taken by the Deliberative Assembly in matters which are within the powers vested in it by statute ;\n\nthe Deliberative Assembly may amend a statute promulgated after the coming into effect of the new status of said territorial community where the Constitutional Council, acting in particular on a referral from the authorities of the territorial community, has found that statute law has intervened in a field within the powers of said Assembly ;\n\nmeasures justified by local needs may be taken by the territorial community in favour of its population as regards access to employment, the right of establishment for the exercise of a professional activity or the protection of land ;\n\nthe community may, subject to review by the central government, participate in the exercise of the powers vested in it while showing due respect for the guaranties given throughout national territory for the exercising of civil liberties.\n\nThe other rules governing the specific organisation of the territorial communities to which this article applies shall be determined and amended by statute after consultation with their Deliberative Assembly.\n\nArticle 74-1\n\nIn the Overseas territorial communities referred to by Article 74 and in New Caledonia, the Government may, in matters which remain within its power, extend by Ordinance, with any necessary adaptations, the legislative provisions applying in mainland France, or adapt the legislative provisions applying, to the specific organization of the community in question, provided statute law has not expressly excluded the use of this procedure for the provisions involved.\n\nSuch Ordinances shall be issued in the Council of Ministers after receiving the opinion of the relevant Deliberative Assemblies and the Conseil d'État. They shall come into force upon publication. They shall lapse if they are not ratified by Parliament within eighteen months of their publication.\n\nArticle 75\n\nCitizens of the Republic who do not have ordinary civil status, the sole status referred to in Article 34, shall retain their personal status until such time as they have renounced the same.\n\nArticle 75-1\n\nRegional languages are part of France's heritage."
