        "text": "Since 1973, the European Commission has been monitoring the evolution of public opinion in the Member States. In addition to half-yearly Standard Eurobarometers where an essentially standard set of questions are posed, 'Special' one-off surveys are also carried out, usually at the request of particular DGs of the European Commission on particular topics.\n\nThe euro was introduced as the single currency, in non-physical form, of 11 EU member states in January 1999, with Greece joining the euro area in January 2001. In these 12 countries, euro coins and notes came into circulation from the beginning of 2002. With Slovenia joining the euro area in January 2007, it is now the official currency of 13 EU member states: Belgium, Germany, Greece, Spain, France,\n\nIreland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Austria, Portugal, Slovenia and Finland.\n\nIn 2008, this will increase with the adoption of the euro in Cyprus and Malta. This survey deals specifically with issues related to euro coins, of which there were €18 billion worth in circulation at the end of February 20072. Responsibility for producing and issuing euro coins lies with the national central banks of Member States (subject to approval by the European Central Bank of the overall issue volume).\n\nCurrently, one side of each euro coin denomination represents a national design of the issuing country, with the other side consistent across all countries in the euro area. In this sense, coins differ from euro banknotes, which are issued under the authority of the European Central Bank and are identical across the euro area.\n\nIn order to ensure a degree of coherence across countries, the European Council declared a moratorium on circulation euro coins until the end of 2008. This means that the standard national side cannot change except if the Head of State depicted on a coin changes or if a country wishes to issue a commemorative edition of a 2 euro coin.\n\nAs this moratorium approaches its expiry, the European Commission will prepare a review of the current rules and examine whether they should be extended or whether a different practice should be introduced for the period after 2008. A Commission Communication issued to mark the fifth anniversary of the introduction of euro banknotes and coins states:\n\nThe Council's future decision on the national sides of euro circulation coins, which should be taken before the moratorium's expiry at the end of 2008, is a very\n\nimportant one which should be carefully prepared. The Commission will launch a survey in the course of 2007 among the euro-area population in order to collect people's views and preferences in this respect.\n\nThe above mentioned survey was commissioned by the Economics and Finance Directorate-General of the European Commission and as well as dealing with opinions on national sides, it also tests citizens’ knowledge and awareness of euro coins."
