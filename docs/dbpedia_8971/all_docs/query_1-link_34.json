        "text": "Everyone once in a while dreams to visit France. Apart from being the most demanded tourist destination, it is also popular for its prestigious educational institutions. Thousands of students every year visit France to pursue higher education. Many immigrate for work too.\n\nSo before you plan for your visit, make sure you know what currency is used in France and where you can buy some.\n\nHistory of the Euro\n\nThe national currency of France has changed from Franc to Euro in 2002. It has been the official currency since then. It is symbolised by € and EUR. Before this, the national currency was Franc. Franc first came into existence in 1360 and was represented with \"F.\" However, Franc had a relatively unstable history compared to Euro.\n\nThe purpose of adopting the Euro was to promote growth, stability and economic integration in Europe. Initially, it was used as a currency only between the countries of the European Union.\n\nAfter three years, Euro replaced the domestic currency of most of the EU nations. Even the nations that have not yet adopted the Euro as their domestic currency still pegs to it in some way. In fact, official documents refer to the Euro as 'The Single Currency.'\n\nIt is interesting to note that although France mints its coins, any coin from the Eurozone is valid in France. And the vice versa is also true.\n\nNote Denominations of EUR\n\nThe Euro banknotes come in denominations of €5, €10, €20, €50, €100, €200, and €500. The notes are of the same design but different in sizes and colours. While the coins come under one, two, five, ten, 20, and 50 cents and € 1 and € 2.\n\nWhat Countries Use the Euro?\n\nApart from France, eighteen other countries under the European Union have replaced their national currencies with a single currency- the Euro.\n\nThose countries are:\n\nAustria- one of the first nations to adopt Euro in 1999\n\nLuxembourg- 1999\n\nBelgium- 2002\n\nFinland- 2002\n\nGermany- 2002\n\nGreece- 2002\n\nIreland- 2002\n\nItaly- 2002\n\nNetherlands- 2002\n\nPortugal- 2002\n\nSpain- 2002\n\nSlovenia- 2007\n\nCyprus- 2008\n\nMalta- 2008\n\nSlovakia- 2009\n\nEstonia- 2011\n\nLatvia- 2014\n\nLithuania- the last to adopt Euro in 2015\n\nApart from these, the Euro is also unofficially accepted in Kosovo and Montenegro.\n\nWhere Can You Buy EUR?\n\nYou can buy Euro as your travel money from the bank, bureau de change and international airport.
