        "text": "A European holiday is a classic trip for many Australians. It offers history, epic architecture, beaches, mountains, food, culture, and art. While the euro (EUR) is the dominant currency in Europe, not every country in the continent uses it. This means that things can get a little confusing when it comes to money matters.\n\nThe currency used in the majority of Europe is known as the euro. It is also abbreviated as € or EUR.\n\nThe euro was first launched in 1999 and aimed to unify countries in the European Union both monetarily and economically. The second phase of the euro adoption occurred in 2002, when euro coins and banknotes were created and distributed. This meant that the euro replaced national currencies such as French francs, Italian lira, Deutsche marks, and Dutch guilders.\n\nThe euro single currency is managed by the Economic and Monetary Union (EMU), which also coordinates Europe’s economic and fiscal policies."
