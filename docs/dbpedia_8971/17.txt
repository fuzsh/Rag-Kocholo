The French Fifth Republic was established on 4 october 1958, with the approval of the new constitution which transformed the previous parliamentary republic into a new semi-presidential republic.

Starting from 1 january 1960, was introduced to the so-called "new Franc", which replaced the previous one with an exchange ratio of 1:100. In the initial period the old coins remained in circulation, until 1963 when the "new Franc" became again simply "Franc".

During the fifth republic period three sets of coins were minted: the first called "ear", which included the values ​​of 1, 2 (trial coin, never in circulation) and 5 cents (until 1964), all made in stainless steel, the second with the design of the "Marianne", composed by values ​​of 5 (from 1965 to 2001), 10, 20 and 50 cents (until 1964) and made in bronze-aluminum, and finally the third with the subject of the "Seeder", coined in nickel with the values of ½, 1 and 5 Francs (in silver from 1960 to 1969). The higher values, 10 and 50 francs, were initially coined in silver. In the following years were added new coins: the 2 Francs "Seeder" (from 1979), the 10 Francs (from 1974 to 1987 in cupronickel-aluminum, then from 1988 bimetallic), the 20 Francs (from 1992, trimetallic coin) and finally the 100 Francs (in silver, from 1982).

All the pieces were made by the National Mint, located in Paris until the mid-seventies, and then moved to the new headquarters in Pessac.

The franc coins of the Fifth Republic remained legal tender until 1 january 2002, when the national currency was replaced by the Euro, with an exchange rate of 1 Euro = 6.55957 Francs.
