In France, the currency used is the Euro (€), which has been the official currency since January 1, 2002. The Euro replaced the French Franc, which was the country’s currency for many years.

As a member of the European Union, France adopted the Euro to facilitate easier trade and economic coordination with other EU member states. The Euro is used in 19 of the 27 EU countries, known collectively as the Eurozone.

In this article, we examine the French currency, the Euro, delving into its historical background and key facts. We trace the Euro’s origins back to its predecessor, the Franc, exploring its evolution and eventual adoption within the Eurozone.

Historical Journey of The France Currency

France’s currency history mirrors its economic and political changes. Initially, France used livres, sous, and deniers, a system rooted in medieval times. After the French Revolution in 1795, they switched to the franc to simplify and stabilize the economy.

The franc, which was divided into 100 centimes, saw many changes, especially during major events like the World Wars. In 1960, the new franc was introduced to counter inflation, worth 100 old francs. Finally, in 2002, France joined other European Union countries in adopting the euro, marking a major shift from a national to a shared European currency.

Franc

The French Franc, a historic currency of France, has a rich history that dates back to the Carolingian monetary system established in the 8th century. Originally, it was linked to the Livre Tournois, a unit from this system. The franc’s name first appeared around 1360, denoting coins worth 1 livre tournois, and it continued to be used for centuries, evolving in value and form.

Charlemagne’s monetary system, introduced in 781 AD, was foundational for the franc. It involved a Livre (pound) of silver, which was subdivided into 20 Sols or Sous (shillings) and further into 12 Deniers (pennies). For a long time, the denier was the only actual coin, with the sou and livre mostly serving as accounting units.

Over the years, the value of the Livre Tournois fluctuated, especially during times of economic and political turmoil. During the reign of King Louis IX in 1266, the silver Gros tournois was issued, which later became France’s preferred accounting system. The 15th and 16th centuries saw further debasements and revaluations of the currency, influenced heavily by wars and economic crises.

The French Revolution brought significant changes, introducing the decimal “franc” in 1795 as a unit of 4.5 grams of fine silver, slightly less than the livre. This move marked the end of the ancien régime’s practice of not stating denominations on coins and manipulating their values. Decimalization was a major step, aligning France with a system that was becoming standard across many countries.

During the Napoleonic era, significant reforms were introduced, including the establishment of the Franc germinal in 1803, a gold franc containing 290.034 mg of fine gold. This era saw the introduction of modern gold coins denominated in francs and the shift to bimetallism, where gold and silver-based units circulated interchangeably.

In the 19th century, France joined the Latin Monetary Union (LMU), standardizing the franc across several European nations. The LMU marked a significant step towards economic integration, using the franc as a common currency base.

World War I and II profoundly impacted the franc. The wars led to severe devaluations and changes in the coinage system. During the Nazi occupation, the franc was pegged to the German Reichsmark. Post-WWII, France underwent several devaluations within the Bretton Woods system, adjusting the franc’s value against other currencies.

In 1960, the new franc (nouveau franc) was introduced, worth 100 old francs. This change was part of a broader effort to stabilize the currency and control inflation. Despite these efforts, the franc continued to experience devaluation, and in 1999, it was replaced by the Euro at a rate of 6.55957 francs to 1 euro.

The transition to the Euro marked the end of the French Franc as a currency, though it left a lasting legacy in France’s economic history. The Franc was more than just a currency; it was a symbol of France’s national identity and sovereignty, reflecting the nation’s tumultuous history through its economic ups and downs.

Euro

France has gone through several currency changes over the years, including the introduction of the Euro in 1999. The Euro became the official currency of France in 2002, replacing the French Franc. Today, the Euro is the official currency of France and is used by millions of people every day.

The Euro is divided into 100 cents. Coins come in denominations of 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, and 50 cents, and 1 and 2 Euros. Banknotes are available in 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, and 500 Euros, although the 500 Euro note is no longer being issued since 2019, it remains legal tender and can still be used.

Euro coins

The euro, introduced in 1999, is the official currency of the Eurozone, consisting of 20 member countries. It is divided into eight coin denominations, ranging from one cent to two euros, each featuring a common reverse side depicting a map of Europe.

However, the obverse side varies among member countries, showcasing unique designs. In addition to Eurozone members, four European microstates (Andorra, Monaco, San Marino, and Vatican City) also use the euro with their own designed coins. The coins are minted at national mints, adhering to strict quotas, while the European Central Bank manages the common side.

Over the years, the euro’s design has evolved, with changes in 2007 reflecting the EU’s enlargement and updates in 2017 for some denominations. The euro’s introduction aimed to foster economic and monetary union, contributing to stability and collaboration among member states.

The coins incorporate security features, and their design considers tactile elements for the visually impaired. While national sides of regular coins can be updated every 15 years, commemorative coins may vary more frequently. As of 2023, 24 countries issue euro coins with their national sides, reflecting the diversity within the Eurozone.

Euro bills

Euro banknotes, the common currency of the eurozone, have evolved since their 1999 inception. Initially, under ES1, these €5 to €500 notes featured a uniform design with the European flag, a map, and “euro” in Latin and Greek.

The designs, by Robert Kalina, resulted from a 1996 competition. ES1, made of pure cotton, excluded non-EU Cyprus and Malta. ES2, or Europa series, introduced size changes and enhanced durability with updated security features. Reinhold Gerstetter redesigned the notes, featuring Mario Draghi’s signature post-March 2012.

Anticipated in 2024, the third series will redesign notes based on public-voted themes. Security features include confidential elements like holograms and watermarks. The Europa series introduced Europa’s face, reflecting EU expansion and adding Bulgaria’s Cyrillic alphabet. Circulating since 2013, it phased out the €500 note due to concerns about criminal use.

Security features include watermarks, holograms, color-changing ink, and more, with consultation for the visually impaired. A 2021 plan outlines the next redesign with potential themes like “European culture.” The ECB monitors euro banknote circulation and stock, ensuring integrity since its 2002 introduction. The euro’s history involves expansion, formalized political authority through the Lisbon Treaty, and usage across multiple EU countries. The seven denominations feature stylized historical European architectural illustrations on both sides.

Inflation and Buying Power of Euro

In France, the purchasing power of the Euro has fluctuated notably between 2007 and 2022. After a significant decline, there was a minor recovery in 2014 with a 1.2% increase. The most substantial drop occurred in 2013, more severe than during the 2008 financial crisis and the 2020 COVID-19 crisis.

Inflation was highest in 2008 at 2.8% and rose again between 2015 and 2018 in France. Despite these inflationary changes, the average household income in France has remained fairly stable since 2005.

Purchasing power has been a major issue in French public discussions, especially during the 2019 Great National Debate following the Yellow Vests movement. Many French citizens believe that President Macron’s economic policies have negatively affected their purchasing power.

The French central bank forecasts an economic recovery by 2025, with decreasing inflation and increasing consumer purchasing power. This prediction is more conservative than the government’s, which expects higher growth rates.

The central bank’s report suggests that if growth aligns more with its forecast than the government’s, additional budget savings might be needed to keep deficit reduction on track.

Inflation is expected to decrease from 5.7% to below 2% by early 2025, which should lead to wage increases outpacing inflation, enhancing purchasing power. This could result in higher consumer spending and boost economic growth to 1.3% in 2025 and 1.6% in 2026.

The adoption of the Euro has facilitated easier travel and business across much of Europe, as people no longer need to exchange currencies when moving between most EU countries. The European Central Bank is responsible for the monetary policy of the Eurozone, including France.
