It was last tested for 1.0.2 and is part of my list of things to do this week. I am trying to update the entire Pirate Pack for NAS to 1.1.1 by end of the week.\n\nhttps://communities.netapp.com/docs/DOC-14076\n\nCurrently we don't have support for soft quotas for qtrees.\n\nWe have revamped our \"Create Qtree Qouta\" and \"Resize Qtree quota\" to work better in 1.1.1 in terms of updating the quotas,\n\nand will add the option not to \"Refresh\" quotas \"Now\" (That will be combined with a command that will refresh all quotas on the\n\nvolume later in a maintenance window) in 2.0.\n\nIf such a code snippet may assist you now, I can see if I can share some of it here.\n\nWe are also adding user quota handling....\n\nYaron Haimsohn\n\nWFA team\n\nHi Yaron\n\nYes that would be usefull, I am creating a workflow wich needs to set the soft valuse (for alerting) so if you have something that you can share that would be good, otherwise I will need to look at what goodrum has produced.\n\nIf you can't share it publically, can you send it to my NetApp account?\n\nThanks\n\nTony"
