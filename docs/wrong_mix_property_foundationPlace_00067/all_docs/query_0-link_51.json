        "text": "In the age-old battle of the sexes, we threw a match on the fire today. It's always fun to see the guys and gals battle it out for gender superiority!\n\nAll of the discussion of gender and how you identify aside, it's true... men and women communicate differently. Some even say they think differently. If that weren't so, there wouldn't be a multi-gazillion dollar industry aimed at deciphering how to deal with the other sex! Hello? Men are from Mars, Women are from Venus? Anybody?\n\nSo today, I stirred the pot in the interest of good-natured fun to hilarious results! I simply proclaimed on Facebook, 'Don't forget this month we're celebrating those three days when men are always right; February 29, 30, and 31.' I won't lie, an evil little giggle may have slipped out as I hit 'post.' Then, I sat back to watch the magic of social media. I've listed some of my favorite responses below.\n\nPeter Ziello\n\nSo you are admitting that men are correct one every four years on February 29th.\n\nMary Celichowski\n\nI have promised myself to drink no alcoholic beverages on those days.\n\nTony Rice\n\nLet's see you post this in 2024.\n\nHaley Lawson\n\nPriceless.\n\nGerald Efferson Jr.\n\nI think we are right for five days... this is fake news... lol\n\nJulie Craig McCoy\n\nAmen.\n\nEd DeWerff\n\nOnce every 4 years? Iâ€™ll take it!\n\nRichard McBroom\n\nSo we get to imagine it for 3 imaginary days, you girls get to imagine it for 365 real days, damn my ass is going to catch HELL for that\n\nMichael Cassell\n\nI have two exes that will argue with you on that.\n\nChris P Davis\n\nI'll buy you dinner on any one of those three nights.\n\nIsn't social media grand? Add your comments to the post below, check out some of the other responses, and I'd love it if you gave me a follow!\n\nIntersting Facts About Shreveport-Bossier"
