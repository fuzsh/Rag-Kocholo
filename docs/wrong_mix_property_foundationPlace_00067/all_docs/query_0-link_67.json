Carroll Heard Goyne, Jr. & Betty Brantley Goyne\n\nEditorial Boardmembers\n\n10019 Canterbury Drive Shreveport, Louisiana, 71106\n\n318/798-7108 [email protected]\n\nOur plans to visit Turkey in June 2000 were nearing com-\n\npletion when Dr. N. Brent Kennedy, Vice Chancellor of the\n\nUniversity of Virginia's College at Wise [UVA/Wise], in-\n\nformed us that our trip was being delayed until mid-July.\n\nDr. Kennedy had received a telephone call from the New\n\nYork representative of the Turkish Republic of Northern\n\nCyprus [TRNC], inviting our group to attend the annual\n\ncelebration of the Peace and Freedom Operation in North-\n\nern Cyprus. The event honors Turkey for its military in-\n\ntervention on July 20, 1974, that halted an attempted\n\ngenocide of the Turkish Cypriots by the Greek Cypriots.\n\nIn addition to Dr. Kennedy, five members of the faculty\n\nof the UVA/Wise were in the travel party. Others in the\n\ngroup were: Ms. Connie Clark, President of the Melungeon\n\nHeritage Association; Mr. and Mrs. Wayne Winkler, he be-\n\ning Director of National Public Radio Station WETS-FM at\n\nEast Tennessee State University; and my wife Betty Brant-\n\nley Goyne and myself.\n\nOur group assembled at Chicago's O'Hare Airport on Friday,\n\nJuly 14, 2000. We departed Chicago about 5 PM, and had\n\nan overnight flight to Ataturk Airport in Istanbul. A\n\ntour guide provided by the TRNC met us on arrival. She\n\nhad been retained to show us parts of Istanbul, take us\n\nto lunch, and to otherwise keep us occupied for about\n\neight hours until boarding our flight to Cyprus.\n\nWe flew from Istanbul to Ercan Airport at Lefkosa [Nico-\n\nsia], Cyprus, arriving a little after midnight on Sunday\n\nmorning. An attractive young lady greeted us, and escort-\n\ned us to the airport VIP Lounge. During our walk across\n\nthe tarmac, it became apparent that our escort was some-\n\none of importance in the government. One in our group\n\nsaid to our escort: \"I bet I can guess who you work for.\n\nYou work for the Prime Minister.\" Devrim Altiok respond-\n\ned: \"Close, but not quite.\" We learned later that Devrim\n\nwas Third Secretary in the Foreign Ministry.\n\nFrom Ercan airport, we were driven to the beautiful Olive\n\nTree Resort Hotel near Girne [Krynia], arriving at about\n\n3 AM. When we finally settled into our beds, we had been\n\n\"out of bed\" for about 40 hours.\n\nMost of Sunday was spent recovering from jet lag. We re-\n\nlaxed around the hotel swimming pool, and talked with\n\nsome of the other delegates. That evening Devrim Altiok\n\nescorted us to dinner at the Park Hotel near Gazimagusa\n\n[Famagusta]. After a delightful dinner on the hotel pa-\n\ntio, we attended a performance of the Bolshoi Ballet of\n\nBelarus in the Roman Amphitheater in the ancient city of\n\nSalamis. It was a brilliant performance, with beautiful\n\ncostumes, in a magnificent setting.\n\nMonday morning we visited with His Excellency, Mr. Musta-\n\nfa Akinci, Minister of State, and Deputy Prime Minister.\n\nPreviously, Mr. Akinci had been mayor of the Turkish part\n\nof Lefkosa [Nicosia] for 14 years. Following our meeting,\n\nMr. Akinci hosted us for lunch in the 8th floor dining\n\nroom of a mid-city hotel. The panoramic view gave us a\n\ngood view of the entire city, including Ledra Palace, UN\n\nHeadquarters for Cyprus. That evening we had dinner at a\n\nseaside restaurant near the ruins of Soli. From that lo-\n\ncation we could see the Taurus Mountains of Turkey.\n\nTuesday morning we visited with His Excellency, Mr. Tah-\n\nsin Ertugruloglu, Minister of Foreign Affairs and De-\n\nfence. The Minister is a graduate of the University of\n\nArizona, and is very fond of the United States. Next, we\n\nvisited with His Excellency, President Rauf Dinktas.\n\nPresident Dinktas had just returned from Geneva, where he\n\nhad been engaged in proximity talks with his Greek Cypri-\n\not counterpart. We had very informative meetings with all\n\nthree of these senior members of the TRNC government.\n\nAfter our meeting with President Dinktas, we had lunch at\n\nthe Dome Hotel in Girne [Kyrenia]. As we were having des-\n\nert, an assistant manager came to our table and extended\n\nan invitation for us to have coffee with the General Man-\n\nager. We were escorted to Mr. Mete Hatay's office, where\n\nhe greeted us with a big smile. Mr. Hatay said: \"Dr. Ken-\n\nnedy, I have been wanting to meet you. I know about the\n\nMelungeons. I have read your book.\" He then showed us his\n\ncopy of Dr. Kennedy's book published in the Turkish lan-\n\nguage.\n\nMr. Hatay said that he had a story to tell us. He said in\n\nthe mountains east of Girne was a village named Melun Dag,\n\nmeaning Damned or Cursed Mountain. He informed us that a\n\nman on his hotel staff was from that village. Mr. Hatay\n\nthen told the assistant manager to bring the man to his\n\noffice. Presently, a man dressed in chef's clothing en-\n\ntered the office. Mr. Hatay asked the man to tell us of\n\nthe history of his village. The man proceeded to relate\n\nthe story in the Turkish language, with Mr. Hatay trans-\n\nlating. He said long ago his ancestors were living on\n\nthe north coast of Cyprus, when sea-raiders attacked\n\nthem. The people fled into the mountains. They named the\n\nmountain where they took refuge Melun Dag. Eventually the\n\npeople settled at the base of the mountain, and built a\n\nnew village. They named the village Melun Dag. Since that\n\nday, the people of Melun Dag have referred to their an-\n\ncestors as Melun Cans, meaning Damned or Cursed Souls.\n\n[The Turkish word 'can' is pronounced 'jan.'] All three\n\nwords: melun, dag and can, are listed in current English-\n\nTurkish Dictionaries, and have the meanings I have stated.\n\nWednesday morning we got an early start for Melun Dag.\n\nThe people of the village had been informed of our visit,\n\nand received us warmly. They placed chairs on the shaded\n\nporch of the village mosque, where they seated us. They\n\nserved us cold drinks and sweets. Dr. Kennedy explained\n\nthe purpose of our visit, and asked for volunteers to\n\ngive hair samples for a DNA project. The two oldest men\n\nin the village came forward, as did other adults. After a\n\nfew giggles, and saying \"you first,\" some of the children\n\ngot in line. The hair samples, with roots intact, were\n\nplaced in numbered plastic bags and returned to the USA\n\nwith us. The results of this test will become part of an\n\nongoing DNA study.\n\nAs is apparent from the foregoing, Cyprus, or the Turkic\n\nworld in general, is certainly a candidate for being the\n\nsource of the term Melungeon.\n\nFor several years we have researched the story of Piri\n\nReis, his maps, and his book \"Kitab-l Bahriye.\" This led\n\nus to the story of the \"Book of Shah Iskender.\" The fol-\n\nlowing poem from \"Kitab-l Bahriye\" is translated from the\n\nTurkish language:\n\n\"Those sailors read, write and know about\n\nThe whole sea science\n\nBut they never share this knowledge\n\nWith anybody other than themselves.\n\nLet me tell you why:\n\nOnce upon a time, Shah Iskender\n\nHad traveled all over the seas,\n\nWhat ever he had heard or seen\n\nHe had them written.\n\nTherefore, all the world is\n\nIn that book of his.\n\nThe book is in Egypt\n\nKept in secret\n\nSince Iskender.\n\nThey escaped with that book,\n\nTraveled with its knowledge,\n\nTranslated it,\n\nLet me tell you who translated it:\n\nHe was called Portolmiye.\"\n\nThis poem, written in the late 1400s or early 1500s,\n\ntells of a world traveler who, in antiquity, wrote a book\n\nand drew maps. That person was Shah Iskender, which is\n\nthe Turkish name for Alexander the Great. Alexander's\n\nbook of the world was recovered from the ruins of the Li-\n\nbrary of Alexandria, Egypt, and preserved in Egypt for\n\nmany years. At some point, Piri Reis obtained a copy of\n\nthe \"Book of Iskender,\" and included parts of it in his\n\nbook \"Kitab-l Bahriye.\" \"Kitab-l Bahriye refers to elev-\n\nen geographic features on the west coast of Africa having\n\nTurkish names. The Piri Reis map, presented to the Turk-\n\nish Sultan in 1513, shows islands in the south Atlantic,\n\nand parts of Antarctica, that had not been discovered in\n\n1513. There is other evidence of a Mediterranean people\n\nvisiting the 'New World' long before Columbus' first voy-\n\nage. Certainly, much research remains to be done to de-\n\ntermine the origin of the term Melungeon. Insallah, we\n\nwill continue with our research.\n\nThe information on Piri Reis and Shah Iskender comes to\n\nus from the Ottoman Archives, the Turkish Naval Archives,\n\nand the Turkic World Research Foundation. It was trans-\n\nlated from the Turkish language by Aslihan Arul who lives\n\nin Istanbul.\n\nCALEB EMERY GOWEN AND FAMILY WERE \"FREQUENT FLYERS\"\n\nTHRU PORT OF NEW YORK A HUNDRED YEARS AGO.\n\nCaleb Emery Gowen was a descendant of William Alexander\n\nGowen who was deported by Oliver Cromwell and who ar-\n\nrived in New England in 1651. He inherited his wander-\n\nlust.\n\nCaleb Emery Gowen, with his son, Albert Younglove Gowen,\n\nwould have been the winners of any \"frequent flyer\" pres-\n\nentations awarded to passengers moving through Ellis Is-\n\nland and the Port of New York a century ago. They and\n\ntheir families were recorded 22 times among the 101 Gowen\n\nindividuals who made a transit between 1892 and 1924, ac-\n\ncording to the records of American Family Immigration\n\nHistory Center.\n\nCaleb Emery Gowen was a namesake of Caleb Emery who was\n\nborn in York County, Maine October 17, 1710. He was a\n\nson of Daniel Emery and Margaret Gowen Emery, daughter of\n\nWilliam Alexander Gowen, who were married March 17, 1695\n\nat Kittery, Maine.\n\nCaleb Emery Gowen was enrolled in Harvard University from\n\n1874 to 1878, receiving his A. B. Degree in 1878. In 1910\n\nhe was a resident of Cleveland, Ohio, living on Magnolia\n\nDrive. He was engaged in \"manufacturing and transporta-\n\ntion\" according to the alumni directory. From 1893 to\n\n1910 he was recorded 11 times in the records of Ellis Is-\n\nland. His wife and children frequently accompanied him.\n\nThey made crossings, mostly to English ports in 1893,\n\n1894, 1896, 1903, 1904, 1906, 1909, 1910, 1914, 1920 and\n\n1922.\n\nChildren born to Caleb Emery Gowen include:\n\nAlbert Younglove Gowen born about 1884\n\nMargaret H. Gowen born about 1887\n\nHarriett Gowen born about 1892\n\nAlbert Younglove Gowen, son of Caleb Emery Gowen, was\n\nborn about 1884. He was listed in the Harvard Alumni\n\nDirectory as a student at Harvard University from 1903\n\nthrough 1905. In 1910 and in 1917 he was listed in \"man-\n\nufacturing\" with home address as 11120 Magnolia Drive,\n\nCleveland.\n\nAlbert Younglove Gowen was recorded four times from 1906\n\nto 1923 in the records of Ellis Island , and then he\n\nbought his own yacht.\n\nIn 1917 he was registered as the owner of a wooden motor\n\nyacht, \"Sweetheart,\" according to Lloyds of London. It\n\nwas built as Hull No. 796 in 1913 at Lawley Shipbuilders\n\nof Quincy, Massachusetts. At the same time, an 18-foot\n\nyacht tender, Hull No. 1252, named \"Adelia\" was built to\n\nbe carried on the \"Sweetheart.\"\n\nAlbert Younglove Gowen was recorded as a member of the\n\nCleveland Yacht Club, and the vessel showed Chicago as\n\nits home port. He changed the name of the yacht to \"Spee-\n\njacks.\" In 1922, he sailed the vessel around the world\n\nand became the first to circumnavigate the globe in a mo-\n\ntor-driven yacht, according to \"Guiness Book of Records.\"\n\nJeanne Couchet Gowen extracted information from the log\n\nof the Speejacks on a voyage from New York to Australia.\n\nDale Collins used the data to write \"Sea Tracks of the\n\nSpeejacks\" which was published in 1923.\n\nBrian Cartwright of Toronto, Ontario, Canada contacted\n\nGowen Research Foundation October 10, 1999 to report that\n\nhe had purchased the \"Adelia\" in 1985. He wrote:\n\n\"I took \"Adelia\" back to Boston [the Lawley boatyard\n\nwas in Quincy, south of Boston] last summer for the\n\nLawley Boatowners Rendezvous & Boston Antique Boat\n\nShow. This was her first return visit since it was\n\nbuilt, over 85 years ago. Not only did I then find\n\nout from Albert Hickey, LBOA Executive Director and\n\nBurt Hasselbalch, curator, Hart Nautical Collection,\n\nMassachusetts Institute of Technology, when \"Adelia\"\n\nwas built, but for whom and for what yacht.\n\nIdeally, and perhaps, idealistically, I am very cur-\n\nious to know if the motoryacht for which it was\n\nbuilt, has survived two world wars and over nine\n\ndecades of use, to this present day. My fingers are\n\ncrossed. I look forward to any background informa-\n\ntion and any insights you may be able to provide on\n\nAlbert Younglove Gowen. I would be interested to\n\nknow how he came about such good fortune to have\n\nsuch fine yacht/boat commissioned.\"\n\nChildren born to Albert Younglove Gowen include:\n\nAlbert Younglove \"Jaxie\" Gowen, Jr. born about 1939\n\nAlbert Youngblood \"Jacksie\" Gowen, Jr, son of Albert\n\nYounglove Gowen, was born about 1944 in Cleveland.\n\nIn 1993, he was living in Geneva, Switzerland where he\n\nwas the executive vice-president of Coutts & Company, an\n\ninvestment banking arm of the National Wesminster Bank\n\nGroup of London. His office was located at 13 Quai de\n\nl'Ile, 1211 Geneva [11].\n\nIn 1999 Albert Younglove \"Jaxie\" Gowen, Jr, was vice\n\nchairman of Sarasin Geneva, part of Bank Sarasin, a\n\nSwiss private bank. He was interviewed by a reporter of\n\nthe \"International Herald-Tribune\" of Paris, France who\n\nwas writing a news story which was published October 18,\n\n1999.\n\n==O==\n\nAfter more than four years of work, millions of volunteer\n\nhours and almost $25 million, the American Family Immi-\n\ngration History Center opened its doors to the American\n\npeople. This center, housed in the Ellis Island Immigra-\n\ntion Museum along with a companion Website provides easy\n\naccess to ships' passenger manifest records of more than\n\n22 million immigrants who entered through the Port of New\n\nYork and Ellis Island from 1892 to 1924. While these rec-\n\nords have been available on microfilm for years through\n\nthe National Archives, this is the first time they are\n\navailable via an electronic database.\n\nThe millions of records available both through kiosks at\n\nEllis Island and via the Internet will provide the fol-\n\nlowing types of information about the immigrants:\n\nImmigrant's given name\n\nImmigrant's surname\n\nGender\n\nAge at arrival\n\nEthnicity/Nationality\n\nMarital status\n\nLast residence (town & country)\n\nDate of arrival\n\nShip of travel\n\nPort of origin\n\nCurrent microfilm records at the National Archives cover\n\nimmigration through the Port of New York from 1820 to\n\n1957. While the American Family Immigration History Cen-\n\nter's database currently includes only the records from\n\n1892-1924, the peak years, they plan to continue adding\n\nrecords until all Ellis Island records are available\n\nelectronically. Records of immigrants through other U.S.\n\nports will be added to database subsequently.\n\nOne hundred one members of the Gowen family made an en-\n\ntrance into the United States through the Port of New\n\nYork and Ellis Island in the 32 years between 1892 and\n\n1924. They were among the 22 million immigrants, pass-\n\nengers and crew members who made a transit through the\n\nport facility, according to the website of the American\n\nFamily Immigration Center.\n\nThe Website is accessed at:\n\nhttp://www.ellisislandrecords.org\n\nThe free electonic database has been overwhelmed by fam-\n\nily researchers since its announcement. The site quickly\n\nbecame one of the 50 busiest in the United States with\n\n1.9 hits during the month of April. Included in the rec-\n\nords were:\n\nName of Passenger Residence Arrived Age\n\n1.

I dedicated many hours to the Foundation's goals\n\nof finding the \"lost key\" or truth for what I still con-\n\nsider to be one of America's most interesting historical\n\nmysteries.\n\nThe Foundation pledged then to print all views [of the\n\norigin of the Melungeons], and still is doing so now. We\n\ntried to clarify to members that not all Gowen related\n\nfamilies were tied to the Melungeons. In time I would\n\nlearn that there may be several partial truths from vari-\n\nous theories regarding the ethnicity of the original Me-\n\nlungeons of Newmans Ridge, as well as 'some' their simi-\n\nlar counterparts in the early Southeast. Until the mid\n\n19th century, the first ones studied were the Appalachian\n\nMelungeons, the Redbones of South Carolina, the Moors of\n\nDelaware, and the Croatan [Lumbee Indians of NC].\n\nSome of the original team members are still members of\n\nGRF and we still have these same goals. Most serious re-\n\nsearchers who have controlled their human instincts to-\n\nward racial idealogy on this issue continue to believe\n\nthat the jury is still out.\n\nMuch has been discovered by many professionals since the\n\npioneer laymen of the 1990s took on the project. It rem-\n\nains incomplete as more theories surface, including Tim\n\nHashaws recent series. Yet, theories they all are. It\n\nis such an emotional and complicated issue that it is\n\nnot unusual for different views on their ethnicity to be\n\ndisputed, with each giving many sources they consider ac-\n\ncurate and solid.\n\nHopefully the article regarding the DNA process by Dr. N.\n\nBrent Kennedy in the April issue of the Newsletter may\n\nresolve some of the questions. In the last few years\n\nmore of the so called experts have given us some convinc-\n\ning play on words to declare as fact who the Melungeons\n\nwere, and when minds are made up, even proper DNA results\n\nmay not change some minds.\n\nA short critique of the Tim Hashaw Series: It is an ex-\n\ntremely well written, fascinating story. One can under-\n\nstand why Tim won journalism awards. I had hoped he\n\nwould cite original documents that show the early Angolan\n\nMalange as Appalachian Melungeons, since his story was\n\nwritten as historical fact.\n\nThe story of the first 20 Negroes to Virginia that Tim\n\nties to the Melungeon term was recently published in \"The\n\nWilliam & Mary Quarterly\" July 1998, by John Thorton,\n\nand in \"The New Light\" April, 1997 by Engel Sluiter.\n\nFrom my research so far, I would agree that Tim is right\n\nto guess that the real Melungeons originally called them-\n\nselves a name sounding similar to Melungeon. It may nev-\n\ner have come from the French word \"Melange\" [meaning mix-\n\ned] as often suggested. There are several researchers\n\nwho have discovered this name being used in areas of the\n\nworld, other than guessing it came from the corruption of\n\nAngolan \"Malange.\" {See \"Origin of Name Melungeon,\"\n\nNewsletter, September 2000 and Carroll Goyne's Melun Dag\n\nCyprus\" story, May 2001.\n\nTim brought out an excellent point that has probably also\n\nbeen a myth too long. All Negroes who come to the colo-\n\nnies were not necessarily slaves. Freed endentured ser-\n\nvants, black or white, were free to do as they wished and\n\ninter marry as they pleased before the the anti-dark skin\n\nlaws began.\n\nTim seems to have taken the data from the Gowen Research\n\nManuscript, regarding the first Gowen Melungeons in Amer-\n\nica as solid fact to publish support for the ethnicity of\n\nthousands of descendants. He leaves no room for \"maybes\"\n\nor mistakes in genealogy. If possible errors are in the\n\nmanuscript as several members claim, the Foundation will\n\ntry to correct them. Honest mistakes or varying inter-\n\npretations have been made in research by most all of us.\n\nThe original Melungeon story has relied on guesswork of\n\nscholars and lay writers since the 1880's. Are we to do\n\nno better?\n\nLDS CHURCH RELEASES 1880 CENSUS ON CD-ROMS\n\nThe complete 1880 census of the United States is being\n\nreleased by the LDS Church in Salt Lake City. Approxi-\n\nmately 50,000,000 names of U.S. citizens enumerated in\n\n1880 have been transcribed into a set of 56 CD-ROM discs.\n\nThe entire set sells for $49.\n\nAccompanying the CD-ROM set is a national index which\n\nalphabetizes every name into a single index. A search\n\nengine allows the user to search by names, states, towns\n\nand other parameters. Although the collection is not a\n\nreproduction of the entire 1880 census, it will point a\n\nresearcher to the exact location of his family 120 years\n\nago. The collection provides the following information\n\nabout each person listed:\n\n* Last name\n\n* First name, often including middle name or initials\n\n* Age\n\n* Sex\n\n* Race\n\n* Marital status\n\n* Occupation\n\n* Relationship to the head of household\n\n* State or country of birth\n\n* Father's state or country of birth\n\n* Mother's state or country of birth\n\n* National Archives microfilm number and page\n\n* Family History Library microfilm number\n\nFrom Melungeon Heritage Assn:\n\nMELUNGEON HISTORY: A GATHERING AT VARDY ON JUNE 23, 2001\n\nThe annual Melungeon event this year is scheduled for\n\nJune 23 at Newman's Ridge, Vardy and Sneedville, Hancock\n\nCounty, Tennessee [almost at the intersection of North\n\nCarolina, Tennessee, Kentucky and Virginia].\n\nThis is where the two Melungeon patriarchs, Vardyman\n\n\"Vardy\" Collins and Shepard \"Buck\" Gibson began leaving\n\nrecords of their colorful lives.

C. Aus­mus on a September day in 1908.\n\nLand agent B. W. Ellison, while extolling the fertility\n\nof the vir­gin land, unfolded a map of 90,000 acres of\n\nland owned by the C-B Livestock Company \"as flat as a\n\npool table, on top of a sawed-off mountain.\" Located in\n\nnewly-organized Crosby County, Texas, it could be bought\n\nat the give-away price of $3 an acre.\n\nWhen Ellison declared, \"You'd have to ride a mile to\n\nfind a rock as big as your fist,\" both Ausmus and Johnny\n\nGoins were con­vinced. Both families had struggled with\n\nthe rocky, mountain­side land in Campbell County, Tennes-\n\nsee, trying to scratch a living out of the hard-scrabble.\n\nJohnny Goins raced home to tell his parents about his de-\n\ncision to head west. John Peter Goins had been born\n\nthere March 21, 1889 to Preston Goins and Annie Smith\n\nGoins. His father was less than enthusiastic. \"I don't\n\nguess you will,\" he firmly told his son. But the deter-\n\nmined Johnny Goins won out. He left his parents' home\n\non November 4, 1908, \"the day William Howard Taft was\n\nelected president of the United States.\"\n\nAlthough he failed to realize fully the impact this de-\n\ncision would have on the remainder of his life, John Pe-\n\nter Goins be­came a pioneer in a developing country. His\n\nlife was changed forever, according to an article in the\n\nMarch 12, 1961 edition of \"The Crosbyton Review\" of\n\nCrosbyton, Texas.\n\nThe Tennessee farm boy informed his parents, \"I'll return\n\nhome in one year.\" He didn't! In fact, it was 16 years\n\nbefore he re­turned to Tennessee for a visit.\n\nGoins and the Ausmuses bought railroad tickets to Texas.\n\nThey changed cars in Kentucky and stayed overnight in\n\nKansas City where they turned south. The group \"landed\n\nin Seymour, Texas on November 4\" and stayed at the B. W.\n\nEllison place three days. On the 11th, they hired John\n\nBradford to move them to Crosby­ton with his wagon and\n\nteam. Ausmus paid Bradford $25 to de­liver his family\n\nand possessions, and Goins paid $10.\n\nLeav­ing Seymour, they \"didn't see one soul until we got\n\nto Ben­jamin.\" They asked Bradford, \"How could all these\n\ncounties get orga­nized when nobody lived there?\" Brad-\n\nford explained that all they had to do was to \"throw a\n\ndance,\" and cowboys would ride 'clear across three coun-\n\nties\" to get there. Texas law required 75 residents to\n\norganize a county, and the dance would continue until\n\nthey had 75 signatures on the petition. \"Occasionally\n\na cowboy signed for his horse, as well.\"\n\nCamping overnight at Benjamin, Texas, the Tennesseeans\n\nmet east-bound Henry Leatherwood. \"Mr. Leatherwood was\n\nthe first Crosby County man I met\" the slightly-built\n\nGoins remembers. He also got acquainted rapidly with\n\nthe rawness of West Texas, observing Leatherwood handl-\n\ning wild mules. Stock back home in Tennessee was\n\n\"raised right in the pen and was always tame.\"\n\nIsolation and primitiveness were all around. Goins re-\n\ncalled that Mrs. Ausmus cried all night long when they\n\nwere camped at Benjamin, expressing a desire to \"go back\n\nhome to Tennessee.\" The Ausmus family \"didn't stay long;\n\nthey compromised and went to Illinois.\"\n\nDespite the adversities of this austere, pioneer land,\n\nJohnny Goins stayed! The 19-year-old lad had \"$15 in\n\ncash when I got to Crosbyton. I bought a little food,\n\nand we stayed that night in a half dugout on B. W. El-\n\nlison's place west of town. Along about midnight, Har-\n\nley Coffey, Ewing Lawson and Luther Collier reached the\n\ndugout to overnight.\"\n\nEarly the next morning, \"Harley Coffey made breakfast.\n\nHe cooked the first biscuits I ate in Crosby County.\n\nAusmus killed an antelope, and we had fresh meat.\"\n\nGoins met ranch foreman Jay Walling, \"one of the finest\n\nmen I ever knew\" and became a cowboy. \"When Mr. Walling\n\nhired me, he sent me to Crawfish Ranch to feed cattle.\n\nThat ranch was in Fairview Community where Goins six\n\nyears later purchased land, which became his home for\n\nthe next 63 years.\n\nWhile working for Walling on the ranch Goins helped \"lay\n\noff the route from Crosbyton to Petersburg.\" A sled\n\npulled by four mules was utilized to blaze a trail and\n\nto outline the road. \"We went across many farms; most\n\nland owners were agreeable. There was a lot of give-and\n\n-take in opening up a new land. It was hard, but there\n\nwere also some fond memories.\"\n\nJohnny Goins remembers driving a chuck wagon with the\n\ncrew which was building the road. Goins jumped from the\n\nchuck wagon to open a gate. He was unprepared to see\n\nthe half-broke horses running off with the chuck wagon.\n\nThe mounted cow­boys soon had the runaway team under con-\n\ntrol.\n\nGoins became friends with Frank White, newspaper editor\n\nand helped him distribute the first issue of the \"Cros-\n\nbyton Review\" in January 1909. In fact, he had spent\n\npart of Christmas Day in White's office watching him\n\nhandset type for that initial publi­cation. A copy of\n\nthe first issue of the paper was sent \"to my father in\n\nTennessee.\" Six decades later, Johnny Goins owned the\n\nlongest-running subscription the newspaper ever had.\n\nThe former Tennessee farmboy worked as a freighter in\n\n1909. He hauled freight on a wagon, going to Plainview on\n\na route. The job had its good points. \"You could get\n\ngood meals for 25 cents at a boarding house in Plainview.\n\nIt also had its bad fea­tures. \"I had a full load of\n\nIrish potatoes when it came up a freeze, and they all\n\nspoiled. I burned out on that job because of the weather.\n\nOne night, me and my team nearly froze. We had some hard\n\nwinters. I took 90 hides to Plainview one time, hides of\n\ncattle which had froze or starved.\"\n\nWith the arrival of barbed wire, Crosby County began to\n\nchange from ranchland to farmland. By 1910, it was evi-\n\ndent that the fertile land was ideal for rowcrop produc-\n\ntion.\n\nJohn Peter Goins was married about 1910, wife's name, No-\n\nra L. \"John Goen\" was the father of an infant born in\n\nCrosby County November 30, 1911, according to Texas Bu-\n\nreau of Statistics File 19418. A son was born to them\n\nin 1915.\n\nAfter seven years in Crosby County, Goins, now a full-\n\nfledged Texan, became a landowner. He made a deal with\n\nthe C-B Livestock Company for 160 acres of land in the\n\nFairview com­munity. Actually it was an agriculture\n\nlease for five years. The agreement called for $1 per\n\nacre lease the first year, $1.25 the second year, $1.50\n\nthe third year, $1.75 the fourth year, and $2.00 the\n\nfifth and final year.\n\nAt the end of the lease, the land contract was marked,\n\n\"Paid in Full.\" Goins moved to Fairview community in\n\n1912 and \"broke out the sod with a walking plow.\" He\n\nfarmed there until 1959.\n\n\"Exceptionally dry years\" prevailed across West Texas in\n\n1917 and 1918. And World War I was declared in 1917.\n\nThese were troubled years. The war ended November 11,\n\n1918. The situa­tion was improving. \"The drought broke,\n\nand we had a good crop in 1919.\" He planted and harvest-\n\ned \"wheat, oats, and high-gear\" [heigera, a form of\n\nmaize].\n\nGoins \"bought my first car\" October 11, 1921. He retain-\n\ned his original registration papers issued by the late B.\n\nW. Mitchell, then sheriff and tax collector, 40 years\n\nlater. He has \"my first poll tax receipt from 1910.\" He\n\nalso kept his first auto license plates and his registra-\n\ntion cards from two World Wars.\n\nThe spry pioneer points out that he vividly recalls\n\nevents from his childhood in Tennessee -- recalling the\n\nBible verse from his final Sunday school lesson there--\n\nand \"things when I first came out here are fresh in my\n\nmind, but I don't remember other things\" more recent.\n\nAddressing the changing times, Goins says \"people start-\n\ned gath­ering at Fairview before sundown to get a seat for\n\nplays\" pre­sented at school. Community life was strong in\n\nthose days. He served 12 years on the Fairview school\n\nboard \"before it was consolidated with Ralls in 1948.\"\n\nAdmitting that he \"strongly opposed\" the consolidation\n\nmove, Goins is emphatic that \"when we lost our school,\n\nwe lost our community life.\"\n\nGoins comes down hard on \"farmers who talk about hard\n\ntimes. Lord o' mercy, in the early days, many people\n\nlost their land and did well to just live. We didn't\n\nhave disaster payments, or Social Security or anything.\"\n\nContinuing on the changing times, Goins remembers \"I\n\nhelped break out lots of sod land. I had three horses\n\nto a plow and walked behind. \"The first cotton I raised,\n\nI hauled to Floydada in 1921 and sold for six cents a\n\npound.\"\n\nJohn Peter Goins was remarried to Miss Ruth Pratt Febru-\n\nary 15, 1942, according to Crosby County Marriage Book 3,\n\npage 451. This pioneer man who will celebrate his 92nd\n\nbirthday on March 21 \"if the Lord let's me live,\" says.\n\n\"when farmers lived on a quarter or a half section, they\n\nhad milk cows, chickens, and meat hogs. They had their\n\nliving at home. They took milk and eggs to town on Sat-\n\nurday and sold them. This kept the little man on the\n\nfarm.\"\n\nGoins and his third wife, the former Alice Holmes \"who I\n\nmet by accident November 14, 1964 and married June 18,\n\n1966\" will be allowed to maintain their residence on the\n\nFairview farm for the remainder of their lives. \"I hated\n\nto sell the land after living here 73 years because I\n\nknew we'd never own another home,\" the pioneer admits.\n\nChildren born to John Peter Goins and Nora L. Goins\n\nin­clude:\n\nSamuel Preston Goins born in 1915\n\nGENEALOGICAL RESEARCH IN THE 2000 CENSUS\n\nWILL BE MORE DIFFICULT IN THE NEXT CENTURY\n\nThe federal census of 2000 suggests that genealogy may be\n\na little more complicated when family researchers a hun-\n\ndred years from now begin to discover their 20th century\n\nroots. It is because more and more couples are living\n\ntogether \"without the benefit of clergy.\"\n\nFive and a half million unmarried couples were living to-\n\ngether in 2000. That's almost double the three million\n\nsingles living together in 1990, according to the U.S.\n\nCensus Bureau.\n\nOver 25% of the U.S. population now live alone. In 1960,\n\nonly eight percent of the population lived alone. Today\n\nthe typical family of father, mother and 1.6 children\n\ncompose only 25% of the total; In 1960, they composed 40%\n\nof all households in America.\n\nThere seems to be no consistant pattern of determining\n\nsurnames for children of unmarried parents and unwed mo-\n\nthers. Perhaps genetic genealogy will have to be used\n\nin 22nd century research.\n\n==Dear Cousins==\n\nThe 11 children of Shadrack Going named in his 1805 Pat-\n\nrick Co., VA, will: Obadiah, Keziah, John, David [David\n\nSmith], James, Claborne, Laban/Leeborne, Shadrack Jr.,\n\nCaleb, Fanny (w/o Edward Bowlin), and Hannah (w/o Thomas\n\nBeasley). There were at least two others: Jerusha, not\n\nnamed in her father's will but named in an 1807 deed in\n\nwhich she and Keziah jointly released claim to their fa-\n\nther's estate; and Nathan, who was murdered September 21\n\n1793 by Robert Hall (who struck him in the head with a\n\nweeding hoe).\n\nOf the 12 surviving children, 8 were in Grainger Co., TN,\n\nat the time of their father's death. Keziah, Jerusha,\n\nObadiah, and Hannah were still in Patrick County. Obadi-\n\nah was the major beneficiary of Shadrack's will; in mid-\n\n1806, six of his brothers in TN signed over power-of-at-\n\ntorney to a Patrick County lawyer to break the will.\n\nThey finally made an out-of-court settlement in late\n\n1807, at which time the land was sold and Obadiah, too,\n\nmoved to TN. Kesiah [Keziah] was in Patrick as late as\n\n1813; not sure what became of her. Jerusha was there too,\n\nlisted with Kesiah on the special 1813 free persons of\n\ncolor tax list.\n\nShe was counted in neighboring Stokes Co., NC, in 1820,\n\nand registered as a free woman of color in Patrick in\n\n1821, at which time she, her daughter, and her grandson\n\nmoved to Ohio.\n\nThis left Hannah (Going) Beasley the last of Shadrack's\n\nchildren in Virginia. Thomas Beasley's 1835 will lists\n\nhis six children. They were: Polly (bc1790, never mar-\n\nried, but had a family in Patrick County); Shadrack\n\n(bc1790, m1821 in Surry County to Martha Harris); Harden\n\n(b. 1790s); Hannah (m1831 in Patrick County to Seaton\n\nChandler); Catherine (m1821 in Surry County to Benjamin\n\nHarris) and Thomas Jr. (inherited bulk of his father's\n\nestate but washed out financially in Patrick in 1845-46).\n\nAll of these folks moved freely around between Patrick,\n\nSurry, and Stokes. Catherine and Shadrack left the area,\n\nI think, Catherine about 1848 and Shadrack in the 1860s.\n\nThomas Beasley, Sr.'s widow, Hannah (Going) Beasley, died\n\nin early 1845 (estate sale in Patrick County).\n\nSome of the other Beasleys you will see in Stokes & Pat-\n\nrick Counties are the families of Benjamin Beasley (c1762\n\n-1841), who was Thomas's brother, and his wife Rachel\n\nPrather; and the family of Robert Beasley & Caty Beasley.\n\nRobert may have been another brother--not sure.\n\nHope this helps,\n\nG.

These types of documented materials stimu-\n\nlate many of us to continue the ever elusive search for\n\nselected minorities in our great melting pot called the\n\nUnited States of America.\n\nUnfortunately,we must take his papers as yet another\n\nspeculative study that is yet to be resolved. We cannot\n\nstart with a hypothetical premise that the core of what\n\nwe call Melungeons came from Angola, Africa and then\n\ntrace their migrations throughout the Eastern Seaboard.\n\nThe last Gowen newsletter with Mr. Hashaw's conclusions\n\nincluded Brent Kennedy's management of new studies of\n\nDNA at the University of Virginia. This type of research\n\nis probably our best hope to eventually solve the Melun-\n\ngeon mystery. This group is collecting selected Melun-\n\ngeon DNA materials for present and future studies. Cur-\n\nrently even this study has its shortcomings as our genet-\n\nicists are just now mapping the entire DNA makeup of the\n\nhuman species. Most researchers feel we will understand\n\nour genetic map in the near future. Eventually there is\n\nhope that through genetics we can actually trace the ex-\n\nact paths of the first man from Africa, as well as iden-\n\ntify migratory routes of and origins of many different\n\npeoples over our entire planet.\n\nThere is still some hope that archeologists will make\n\nsome unique find to help identify the source of the Me-\n\nlungeons, but with limited labor and resources, as well\n\nas little interest in this minority this does not seem\n\ntoo feasible at this time. Surveillance equipment will\n\nimprove for looking under the ground and sea, but cur-\n\nrently only a limited amount of people are interested in\n\nthis mystery. Perhaps future finds of artifacts of an-\n\ncient peoples in selected sites of the coastal waters or\n\nlands of America will add confirmation to new knowledge\n\nand understanding of genetic findings.\n\nWe must applaud cousin Tom Hashaw for his fine work and\n\nadded stimulation for our thoughts. At this time,we must\n\nnot take his fine investigative efforts and theories as\n\ngospel as we store away his materials in our libraries\n\nfor future reference.
