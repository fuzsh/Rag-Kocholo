        "text": "Being born a native Louisianan in Mer Rouge, and raised in nearby Monroe, Horace Logan Jr. couldn't have had any idea the influence he would have on popular music.\n\nNot long after landing in Shreveport, Logan got a job at KWKH (now 1130AM The Tiger) at 16 years old after winning a contest. Even at 16, Horace Logan had a deep and booming voice. After announcing for several years, Logan took over as Program Director at KWKH in 1947. The following year, in 1948 Logan started booking acts for a live music program that would become the famous Louisiana Hayride.\n\nLogan booked talent to play the legendary show, broadcasted live from Shreveport Municipal Auditorium. The Louisiana Hayride began picking up steam, and \"Hoss\" became something of a star-maker. Logan launched several careers including, Hank Williams, Faron Young, Slim Whitman, Johnny Cash, and of course, Elvis Presley.\n\nOne of \"Hoss\" Logan's claims to fame, (among MANY others) is coining the phrase \"Elvis has left the building\". After The King's debut on the Louisiana Hayride, the audience was so wild and frenzied that Logan tried to calm the crowd by announcing, \"Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis has left the building...\".\n\nHorace Logan also, greatly helped the career of Hank Williams as well. Hank was a regular on the Hayride when he would tour through Louisiana. Hank later became a regular on the infamous Grand Ole Opry out of Nashville, but was fired after a series of issues stemming from Hank's addiction. Logan welcomed Williams back to the Hayride with open arms after that, and featured the tortured artist until his untimely death.\n\nThe amazing Louisiana Hayride unfortunately only lasted two years after Logan's departure from KWKH in 1958. Logan stayed active in entertainment throughout his life, and even ran The Big D Jamboree in Dallas for several years. Logan died of pancreatic cancer in his home in Seadrift, Tex., on San Antonio Bay. He was 86 years old."
