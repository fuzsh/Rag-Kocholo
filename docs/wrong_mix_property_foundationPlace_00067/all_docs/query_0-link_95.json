While it is\n\nauthorized and \"officialized\" by Apogee, it is not the property nor the\n\nwork of Apogee. However, Apogee has contributed generously to its\n\ncreation and growth; for that, I offer my sincere thanks.\n\n}As of version 2.4w, this FAQ is also available in HTML format (see the\n\n}section on \"obtaining the latest version of the FAQ\" for information on\n\n}how to access it). The HTML versions of the FAQ will always have a\n\n}trailing \"w\" as part of the version number; this denotes it as an HTML\n\n}version as opposed to a text version of the FAQ. The text versions will\n\n}always be quicker to appear, and, for minor updates, I may skip\n\n}the HTML release altogether. However, I will try to keep both versions\n\n}reasonably up to date.\n\n[1.2.1] Obtaining the latest version of the FAQ\n\n}There are a few ways to get the latest copy of either the text based\n\n}version or the HTML version of the Apogee FAQ.

A list,\n\nwith instructions for obtaining the latest versions, follows:\n\nGame Maintainer How To Get It\n\n---- ---------- -------------\n\nRise of the Triad Rylan Hilman FTP to ftp.uml.edu, and download\n\n/msdos/games/apogee/faq/rott.faq, or\n\nsend mail to rhi...@oasis.rain.com.\n\n} Wolfenstein 3D Adam Williamson FTP to wcl-l.bham.ac.uk and download\n\n} /pub/djh/faqs/Wolfenstein-3D.faq, or\n\n} send mail to ad...@scss.demon.co.uk.\n\nCommander Keen Bill Amon FTP to wcl-l.bham.ac.uk and download\n\n/pub/djh/faqs/commander.keen.faq, or\n\nsend mail to wa...@mbunix.mitre.org.\n\nNote that you could probably get copies of any or all of these by simply\n\nposting a request to alt.games.apogee or comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.action.\n\nHowever, to keep requests posts to a minimum, please do not do this, unless\n\nyou are unable to obtain it via the other means listed here.\n\n[1.4] What is Apogee?\n\nApogee is a games distributor for PC games of many sorts. It is a diverse\n\ngaming company, contributing to several different genres of games. While\n\nmuch of what Apogee publishes are games written primarily by other companies,\n\nsuch as Cygnus or Argo Games, Apogee writes their own games as well. Apogee's\n\nstaff includes an array of talented programmers, artists, and musicians. For\n\nmany years now, Apogee has been among the leading shareware games companies\n\nfor the PC and compatible market.\n\n[1.5] What does \"Apogee\" mean?\n\nAccording to the American Heritage dictionary, \"apogee\" means: \"the point\n\nin the orbit of the moon or of an artificial satellite most distant from\n\nthe earth.\" Or, more generally, \"the farthest or highest point; apex.\"\n\nRelated words are the Greek \"apogaion,\" the neuter form of \"apogaios\"\n\nwhich means \"away from the earth.\" There is also the New Latin word\n\n\"apogaeum,\" which is derived from the Greek word. There is a French word\n\n\"Apogee\" (with an accent over the first 'e'). In English, there is the\n\nrelated word \"apogean\" and the antonym \"perigee.\"\n\nAll this is academic, however, for according to the Apogee slogan, \"Apogee\n\nmeans action.\" :-)\n\n[1.6] How Apogee markets its games\n\nIn 1987, Apogee came up with a unique method of marketing their games. Since\n\nthen, other shareware companies have adopted their strategy. Their scheme is\n\nthis: each game they produce is divided into three to four, sometimes even\n\nsix episodes. The first episode is free. It can be downloaded from\n\nCompuServe, BBS's, or the Internet, or bought in a store that distributes\n\nshareware games for disk copying charges. You can distribute the shareware\n\nepisode to your friends yourself, if you like, provided you leave all the\n\noriginal files intact.\n\nIf you like the shareware episode of a game, Apogee requires that you register\n\nit. This is the normal rule regarding shareware. Upon registration, you will\n\nreceive the complete game. Apogee uses this marketing scheme so that people\n\ncan have a good idea about the game they are buying before they put their cash\n\non the line.\n\n[1.7] Getting the latest information\n\nThere are a few ways to get the latest information about Apogee, even if you\n\nwant it more quickly than keeping up with the latest revisions of this FAQ\n\nwould do. These methods are mentioned briefly in the following sections:\n\n[1.7.1] Electronic news\n\nOn Usenet, the newsgroups alt.games.apogee, comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc.action,\n\nand comp.sys.ibm.pc.games.misc all carry discussion about Apogee's latest.\n\nApogee monitors these, plus the gaming, shareware, and Apogee support\n\nconferences on Fidonet, Rime, Intelec, ILink, U'NI-Net, and Smartnet.\n\n[1.7.2] Apogee's internet mailing list\n\nApogee has an Internet mailing list. Whenever new games or slide shows are\n\nreleased (or other important information), Apogee sends the information out in\n\na mailing. If you would like to be on this mailing list, contact Joe Siegler\n\n}(joe.s...@apogee1.com, joe.s...@swcbbs.com, or apo...@metronet.com, in\n\n}that order). Those email addresses send directly to Joe Siegler, and not\n\n}to a list daemon or robot. The mailing list is free of charge.\n\n[1.7.3] Finger files\n\nOn the internet, you can finger apo...@fohnix.metronet.com, and receive all\n\nthe latest information about Apogee. Usually this entails both recent and\n\nupcoming releases, among other things. If apo...@fohnix.metronet.com does\n\nnot work, try apo...@metronet.com.\n\n[1.8] Apogee's staff\n\nScott Miller - President, Co-owner\n\nGeorge Broussard - Executive VP, Co-owner\n\nSteven Blackburn - VP Operations\n\nTom Hall - Creative Director\n\nGreg Malone - Creative Director\n\nDennis Scarff - Vice President, World Operations\n\nJoe Siegler - On-Line Support Manager & Technical Support\n\nKevin Green - Customer Support Supervisor & Technical Support\n\nDan Linton - SysOp/Owner of Software Creations BBS\n\nLee Jackson - Technical Support\n\n} Dennis DeSmeth - Technical Support\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n[2] Historical Information\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n[2.1] Other companies\n\n[2.1.1] What is Apogee's relationship with 3D Realms?\n\nApogee and 3D Realms are sister companies, both divisions of Action\n\nEntertainment, Inc. Originally, Action Entertainment's next-generation\n\nof 3D games were going to be published under the Apogee name. However,\n\nin late August of 1994, 3D Realms was born, and the four next-generation\n\n}3D games that Action had under production (namely, \"Blood,\" \"Duke Nukem 3D,\"\n\n}\"Ruins: Return of the Gods,\" and \"Shadow Warrior,\" all of which use the\n\n}\"build\" engine) are now under the 3D Realms label.\n\n[2.1.2] What is Apogee's relationship with id?\n\n}Apogee and id Software are two completely different companies. They\n\n}always have been, always will be. Apogee doesn't own id; id doesn't own\n\n}Apogee; nor is one a division of the other.\n\n}\n\n}Apogee Software writes and distributes software. Of the many games that\n\n}Apogee has published, only a handful have not been written by Apogee as\n\n}well. id Software wrote three of these games, namely, Keen Vorticons, Keen\n\n}Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D.\n\n}\n\n}id Software writes software, and up until Doom, had never published anything\n\n}themselves. id has published through a few companies, Apogee being one of\n\n}them. As mentioned before, Keen Vorticons, Keen Galaxy, and Wolfenstein 3D\n\n}were distributed by Apogee. (At later dates, id went on and also published\n\n}Keen Galaxy and Wolf3D in the stores through GT Software, but that's another\n\n}story.) Some earlier id efforts such as Catacombs Abyss are distributed\n\n}through Softdisk. (Technically, games like Catacombs Abyss, Dangerous Dave,\n\n}and Rescue Rover are Softdisk games, and not \"id Software\" games. id's first\n\n}official game as \"id Software\" was Keen Vorticons. While the same people\n\n}worked at Softdisk on the previously mentioned games, they are not\n\n}officially id Software games.)\n\n}\n\n}id has published three commercial only games. Two of these were published\n\n}by FormGen, those being Keen: Aliens Ate My Babysitter and Spear of Destiny.\n\n}These two are quite frequently assumed to be Apogee games, but they are not.\n\n}Check them; the name Apogee does not appear within. Apogee does, however,\n\n}*resell* those two games, adding to the confusion. But again, they do not\n\n}distribute them; they only sell them. Apogee has to buy them from FormGen\n\n}like any other computer store would. The third id retail game is Doom II,\n\n}published in the retail markets by GT Software.\n\n}\n\n}Starting with Doom, id has been publishing on their own. Apogee has absolutely\n\n}nothing to do with Doom, nor future titles by id Software. Furthermore,\n\n}starting with the release of Heretic, id Software will also be publishing games\n\n}on their own label. They licensed their Doom engine to two companies, Cygnus\n\n}Studios (the people who did Raptor), and Raven Software. The two games\n\n}produced under this agreement (Strife & Heretic respectively), are going to be\n\n}published under the \"id\" label exactly the same way that id Software themselves\n\n}published Wolfenstein 3D under the \"Apogee\" label.\n\n}\n\n}There has been no \"big divorce,\" or \"feud\" or something along those lines\n\n}between id and Apogee. The id guys and the Apogee guys are all good friends,\n\n}and in fact get together every once in a while to shoot pool at the id\n\n}offices. Other mutual activities include paintball (which also involves\n\n}Cygnus). There was never a fallout between Apogee and id. Anyone trying to\n\n}imply this is driving a wedge where it doesn't belong or exist.\n\n}[2.1.3] What's Apogee's relationship with Parallax?\n\n}\n\n}In the credits for the game Descent, written by Parallax and distributed by\n\n}Interplay, there is a thank you note to \"Scott Miller and Apogee Software.\"\n\n}Mike Kulas, the leader for the project, was asked why that was in there,\n\n}and his response is given below.\n\n}\n\n} Hi Joe,\n\n}\n\n} We put Scott and Apogee in there because we truly appreciate\n\n} all that Apogee did for us. Scott showed a lot of faith in\n\n} us when we didn't really have anything to show anybody. If\n\n} not for Scott, I don't think we would be anywhere near where\n\n} we are today.\n\n}\n\n} You can tell people exactly this, if you like.\n\n}\n\n} Mike\n\n[2.2] What awards has Apogee won?\n\nApogee has won over a hundred national and international awards -- far too\n\nmany to list here -- but here are some of the highlights:\n\nCommander Keen - Best Entertainment Software - 1992\n\nCommander Keen - Best Overall - 1992\n\nMath Rescue - Best Education Software - 1993\n\nWolfenstein 3D - Best Entertainment Software - 1993\n\nWolfenstein 3D - Best New Home, Hobby, Entertainment - 1993\n\nWolfenstein 3D - Best Overall, People's Choice - 1993\n\n[2.3] History of specific games\n\n}[2.3.1] The Kroz Series\n\n}\n\n}Scott Miller had been programming games since 1975, when he was in high\n\n}school. In 1987 he wrote Kingdom of Kroz in Turbo Pascal, and, with the\n\n}full knowledge that, at the time, 99% of shareware was not profitable for\n\n}its authors, released it into the shareware market. Thus, it was a\n\n}mystifying surprise when Kroz turned out to be a smash hit. The letters\n\n}poured in, expressing love of the game and demanding sequels. In 1988,\n\n}Kingdom of Kroz I received top honors in the game category of a national\n\n}programming contest, and came in second overall (it lost to a spreadsheet\n\n}program). Scott Miller himself said, in the notes to a later version of\n\n}the game, \"Thanks to Kroz I now know what a mutual fund is, but on the\n\n}downside my taxes require a book two inches thick to figure out.\"\n\n}\n\n}In short, Kroz marked Apogee's birth, emergence into the national\n\n}mainstream, and coronation as one of the earliest kings of shareware.\n\n}\n\n}What inspired Kroz? At the time, Scott Miller's favorite games were\n\n}M.U.L.E., Archon, and Spelunker, among others. He liked games where puzzle\n\n}solving was first, and the action secondary. Kroz's main inspiration was\n\n}probably Rogue, which Scott used to play, but disliked for its randomness\n\n}and reliance on chance. So Kroz was born. Another of Scott's favorite\n\n}games is evident from the title; Kroz spelled backwards is \"Zork,\" one of\n\n}Infocom's most famous and successful text adventure games.\n\n}\n\n}The various episodes and versions of Kroz are many. To confuse the issue,\n\n}Kroz, as well as many of the other early Apogee games, were not sold\n\n}strictly in a single bundle of three or four episodes. The shareware\n\n}episode, Kingdom of Kroz, could be registered at a cost of $7.50, and this\n\n}registration made the customer eligible to buy other episodes at $7.50 each,\n\n}or several episodes at some savings. The episodes of Kroz are as follows:\n\n}\n\n} 1. Caverns of Kroz\n\n} 2. Dungeons of Kroz\n\n} 3. Kingdom of Kroz\n\n} 4. Return to Kroz\n\n} 5. Temple of Kroz\n\n} 6. The Final Crusade of Kroz\n\n} 7. The Lost Adventures of Kroz\n\n}\n\n}Episodes 1-3 comprised \"The Kroz Trilogy.\" These episodes were later\n\n}redone in 1990, their names changing to \"Caverns of Kroz II,\" \"Dungeons of\n\n}Kroz II,\" and \"Kingdom of Kroz II.\" Since Kingdom of Kroz II had\n\n}significant map changes to 17 different levels, the original \"Kingdom of\n\n}Kroz I\" remained available for purchase to registered owners of \"Kingdom of\n\n}Kroz II.\"\n\n}\n\n}Episodes 3-6 comprised \"The Super Kroz Trilogy.\" These contained more\n\n}levels, more items, and more effects. This trilogy was intended to complete\n\n}the Kroz series, but the letters kept pouring in, including one from\n\n}Patricia Baker, RI, who said, \"I have lived in Kroz for almost a month and\n\n}was sorry tonight to finally find the Amulet.\"\n\n}\n\n}So one final episode of Kroz was to be made, namely Episode 7, \"The Lost\n\n}Adventures of Kroz.\" This contained 75 new levels, and, as such, was sold\n\n}at the slightly steeper rate of $20. As said earlier, however, the rates\n\n}were lowered if more episodes were purchased at once. In early 1991, one\n\n}could buy the first six episodes for $35 total, or $45 for all seven.\n\n}\n\n}\"The Lost Adventures of Kroz\" was the final episode to be completed. At\n\n}one time, another episode had been planned for release in March 1991\n\n}entitled \"The Underground Empire of Kroz,\" but this never saw the light of\n\n}day. Apogee, along with the rest of the gaming community, started moving\n\n}on toward more ambitious projects.\n\n}\n\n}Unlike most of Apogee's early games, the Kingdom of Kroz is still\n\n}commercially available from Apogee. The episodes you'll get upon a $24.95\n\n}registration are the revised Kroz Trilogy, the Super Kroz Trilogy, and\n\n}the Lost Adventures. You cannot buy the individual episodes for Kroz or\n\n}any other Apogee game any longer; Apogee stopped doing this in mid 1993.\n\n[2.3.2] Commander Keen\n\nJoe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Keen series:\n\nHere's a short history of the Commander Keen games. First, I'll list\n\nall the games and their titles. All of them were written by id\n\nSoftware.\n\n1) Marooned on Mars ---\\\n\n2) The Earth Explodes | ---> Invasion of the Vorticons\n\n3) Keen Must Die ---/\n\n3.5) Keen Dreams\n\n4) Secret of the Oracle --\\__ Goodbye Galaxy\n\n5) The Armageddon Machine --/\n\n6) Aliens Ate My Babysitter\n\nEpisodes 1-3 are collectively called \"Invasion of the Vorticons,\"\n\nand are published by Apogee Software. This series of Commander Keen\n\nwas released on December 14th, 1990, according to Tom Hall, Apogee's\n\nCreative Director, and at the time, Creative Director of id Software.\n\nEpisodes 4 and 5 are collectively called \"Goodbye Galaxy,\" and are also\n\npublished by Apogee Software. This series of Commander Keen was\n\nreleased somewhere around June of 1991. There was also a special CGA\n\nedition of Keens 4-5 made. The game is functionally exactly the same\n\nas the standard EGA version of the game, but the graphics are in CGA.\n\nEpisode 6 is a \"stand alone\" game, and is entitled \"Aliens Ate my\n\nBabysitter.\" This episode of Keen is distributed by FormGen. It is\n\ncommercial software, and is available at your local software store\n\n(such as CompUSA). This is also sold by Apogee, but Apogee only\n\nresells this product, we don't actually distribute it. FormGen also\n\ndecided to put off-disk copy protection on the full version of this\n\ngame. Furthermore, FormGen also has a playable 3 level commercial\n\ndemo available for perusal before purchase. Apogee Software sells a\n\nversion of Keen 6 in CGA. I do not know if FormGen sells the CGA\n\nversion of Keen 6 in the stores; it may only be available from Apogee\n\nSoftware. Check with FormGen for more details.\n\nKeen Dreams has kind of an interesting story. This is referred to as\n\nthe \"Lost Episode\" of Commander Keen. I like to think of it as \"Keen\n\nEpisode 3.5.\" The reason for that is that Keen Dreams falls in between\n\nVorticons and Galaxy, both in terms of technology and story line.\n\nBefore the id guys actually formed id, the majority of them worked at\n\nSoftdisk, a computer software publisher in Shreveport, LA. The\n\nfounding members of id Software left Softdisk to do the Vorticons\n\nseries of Keen for Apogee Software. However, they were contractually\n\nobligated to deliver another game to Softdisk, and since development\n\nhad started on the Galaxy series, they threw together a Keen game for\n\nSoftdisk, and Keen Dreams was born. This game is not sold by Apogee\n\nSoftware, nor does Apogee have anything at all to do with it. You'd\n\nneed to contact Softdisk for any further information regarding Keen\n\nDreams.\n\nEpisodes 1, 3.5, 4, and the 3 level demo for Episode 6 are\n\nthe only ones that you are legally allowed to upload and download\n\nanywhere. Episodes 2, 3, 5, and the full version of Episode 6 are\n\ncommercial software, and should not appear on any BBS, online service,\n\nor should otherwise be sold except for authorized sellers of the\n\ngames.\n\nHere are the BBS filenames as currently available from Apogee for the\n\nvarious Keen games from Apogee.\n\nKeen 1 -> #1KEEN.ZIP\n\nKeen 4 -> #4KEEN.ZIP\n\nKeen 4 -> #4KEENC.ZIP (Special CGA Version)\n\nI've seen the 3 level Aliens Demo available with the filename\n\n}#6K-DEMO.ZIP and K6DEMO.ZIP. I've seen Keen Dreams available with\n\nthe filename KDREAMS.ZIP. However, neither of these are Apogee\n\nproducts, and I cannot vouch for the files' names.\n\nIf you played Keen 5, there was a screen that said something to the\n\neffect of \"Join us in December 1992 for the greatest Keen adventure\n\nyet.\" There was a picture of Keen smiling, with a Santa Claus hat on.\n\nAt the time, id Software was intending to do a third series of\n\nCommander Keen, tentatively entitled \"Commander Keen: The Universe is\n\nToast.\" However, other projects came up (Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of\n\nDestiny, and later, Doom). At this time, there is no development\n\n}going on in the Commander Keen department. There will probably be\n\nmore Commander Keen games by Apogee Software. However, even if the\n\nwork were to commence on the game TODAY, it would still take about twelve\n\nmonths to see the light of day. The earliest development could start\n\n}on this game would be late in 1995, so I would not look for any new\n\n}Commander Keen games before the third quarter of 1996.\n\n}On a different note, Commander Keen, and artifacts from the Keen games have\n\n}found their way into other games. Commander Keen is listed in the default\n\n}scoreboards of a handful of Apogee games, mentioned in the instructions of\n\n}one, and has made a few more prominent appearances, which are listed under\n\n}the \"Cameos\" section of this FAQ.\n\n}[2.3.3] Wolfenstein 3D, Spear of Destiny, and Rise of the Triad\n\nJoe Siegler's explanation of the history of the Wolfenstein series:\n\nOn May 5, 1992, Apogee Software released the shareware episode of Wolfenstein\n\n3D, and has been distributing it in the shareware market since. Apogee\n\nis the official distributor of Wolfenstein 3D's original six episodes in the\n\nshareware market.\n\nSomewhere around September of 1992, FormGen Corp released Spear of Destiny.\n\nThis is a retail sequel to Wolfenstein 3D. This game consisted of one episode\n\nwith 20 levels. This game consists of some new wall art, a couple of new\n\nobjects, and new boss creatures. This game is essentially the same as Wolf3D\n\ngenerally, but is completely new in the level design aspect. This game is\n\navailable in stores like CompUSA. Apogee also resells this product, but is not\n\nresponsible for its distribution. Apogee has to buy it from FormGen\n\nlike any other store would. There is a two level playable demo floating around\n\nfor Spear of Destiny. It's the same first two levels that appear in the full\n\nversion of the game. It is not shareware; commercial demos are for the most\n\npart non-interactive, however, this one *is* interactive, and since it bears\n\na close resemblance to Wolfenstein 3D, which is shareware, the SOD demo is\n\nfrequently mistaken for being shareware, which it is not.\n\nThere have been numerous editors and extra levels created by users for both\n\nWolfenstein 3D and Spear of Destiny. With regard to Wolf3D, Apogee\n\nrespectfully requests that you not make or distribute any editors, extra\n\nlevels, or other add-ons that will work on the shareware episode. If you\n\nchoose to make add-ons, please make these items for the registered version\n\nonly, and be aware that Apogee cannot support user-created items.\n\nSometime in mid/late 1993, id Software decided that they were going to publish\n\nthese same six original episodes in the retail market. These are the same six\n\nepisodes that Apogee had been selling since May of 1992. Since Apogee was at\n\nthat time not set up for retail distribution, id Software went with another\n\ncompany called is GT Software. This package is available in CompUSA and\n\ncontains the same six episodes that Apogee distributes. Apogee has absolutely\n\nnothing at all to do with this product. The GT Software version of\n\nWolfenstein 3D is totally a GT product. Apogee has no control over the\n\npackaging, quality control, or price.\n\nIn May of 1994, FormGen Corporation released an update to Spear of Destiny. It\n\nwas two new epsiodes and are available in the stores. The collective name of\n\nthe product is \"Spear of Destiny Mission Add-On Packs.\" The new new epsiodes\n\neach have their own individual titles, these being \"Mission 2: Return to\n\nDanger,\" and \"Mission 3: Ultimate Challenge.\" These are add-ons to Spear of\n\nDestiny and have some new level graphics, some differently colored actors,\n\nbut is essentially more levels for Spear of Destiny. These extra versions do\n\nrequire that you have the first Spear of Destiny game (the original six Apogee\n\nWolf episodes are not required). Neither Apogee Software nor id software\n\nhas anything to do with these add-on packs. Neither Apogee nor id sells the\n\npacks or supports it. It is strictly a FormGen product.\n\nid Software has also either written or released versions of Wolfenstein 3D for\n\nother platforms over time. Apogee Software has nothing to do with any\n\nof them. id Software holds the copyright to Wolfenstein 3D and can\n\nlicense it to others for other platforms or do whatever they want with it.\n\nThese versions are listed for completeness' sake only.\n\nThe Super Nintendo version was released around Jan/Feb of 1994. This was\n\npublished through a company called \"Imagineer.\" Due to Nintendo restrictions,\n\nsome elements of the game had to be removed. These were, 1) all Nazi\n\nreferences, 2) the dogs (replaced with rats), and 3) blood (replaced with\n\nsweat). This is still a good game, considering what it's programmed for.\n\nThere was a version released for the Atari Jaguar around August of 1994, and\n\nthis version is probably the best graphically of any version published. When\n\nyou go up right against walls and the like, they do not become as blocky or\n\nchunky, as compared to previous versions of Wolfenstein 3D. This version was\n\npublished by Atari. id also licensed Wolf3D so that it could be published\n\non the Macintosh computer. This version was released in October 1994 and is\n\nbeing distributed by MacPlay, a division of Interplay. WolfMac is a\n\nshareware title, and there is a shareware version of it available. When you\n\nregister, you get something like 30 levels. Again, Apogee has nothing to do\n\nwith these versions of Wolfenstein 3D; you would need to contact the various\n\n}companies, or id Software directly for more information on them. There was\n\n}yet another version published in late 1994 by Vitesse, this version being done\n\n}for the Apple IIGS. This brings the game full circle, as the original Castle\n\n}Wolfenstein was written for the Apple IIe. The IIGS version was done by Burger\n\n}Bill Heinemann (as was the Mac version).\n\nThe premiere issue of Game Developer's Magazine stated that Apogee Software was\n\nworking on a game called \"Wolfenstein 3D: Part II,\" which was to be a totally\n\nnew game, with completely new actors, and new everything; the only thing the\n\nsame being the title Wolfenstein 3D. This information is partially\n\nincorrect; there is no such title under production at either Apogee or id\n\n}Software. However, this was under production at Apogee for a while back in\n\n}early 1994, but this was dropped, and the project changed to \"Rise of the\n\n}Triad.\" This game is now available from Apogee Software.\n\n}[2.3.3.1] \"Call Apogee and say Aardwolf\"\n\n}\n\n}Joe Siegler's explanation of \"Aardwolf\":\n\n}\n\n}\"Call Apogee and say Aardwolf.\" It's a sign that to this day is something\n\n}that I get asked about a lot. This is a sign that appears on a wall in a\n\n}particularly nasty maze in Episode 2 Level 8 of Wolfenstein 3D. The sign\n\n}was to be the goal in a contest Apogee and if was going to have, but\n\n}almost immediately after the game's release, a large amount of cheat and\n\n}mapping programs were released. With these programs running around, we felt\n\n}that it would have been unfair to have the contest and award a prize. The\n\n}sign was still left in the game, but in hindsight, probably should have\n\n}been taken out, since we still get calls now, almost three years after the\n\n}game's release.\n\n}\n\n}Also, in a somewhat related issue, the registered version had letters after the\n\n}highest score in the score table in some revisions of the game. These letters\n\n}were to be part of another contest that got scrapped before it got started,\n\n}where we were going to have people call in with their scores and tell us the\n\n}code; we'd then be able to verify their score. However, with the cheat\n\n}programs out there, this got scrapped too.\n\n[2.3.4] Halloween Harry and Alien Carnage\n\nHalloween Harry was written by Sub-Zero software, located in Australia.\n\nApogee is the game's distributor. In October of 1993, Apogee released\n\nv1.1 of Halloween Harry in the United States. As with both Mystic Towers\n\nand Wacky Wheels, the first American version was 1.1, not 1.0. The reason\n\n}for this is that an incomplete version of the game was released overseas\n\n}as a cover program and referred to as v1.0. Please note, however, that\n\nthese are not complete, finished versions of the games.\n\nA month later, v1.2 of the game was released. A year after that, Apogee\n\nsuggested a title change to \"Alien Carnage.\" Sub-Zero agreed. Thus, in\n\nearly November of 1994, \"Halloween Harry\" was dropped from Apogee's\n\ndistribution, and \"Alien Carnage\" added. Alien Carnage v1.0 is essentially\n\nHalloween Harry v1.2 with a name change, price change, and episode\n\nreorganization. The shareware version of Alien Carnage (its first episode)\n\nis Halloween Harry's episode three. With the exception of this\n\nreorganization, Alien Carnage consists of the same episodes as Halloween\n\nHarry. The shareware version of Halloween Harry is still legal to\n\ndistribute; however, Apogee prefers you distribute the shareware version of\n\nAlien Carnage only, as this version has the new pricing information\n\nscreens.\n\n}[2.3.5] Paganitzu and Realms of Chaos\n\n}\n\n}About a year before Keith Schuler wrote Paganitzu for Apogee, he wrote\n\n}another game called Chaganitzu for Softdisk. These two games were almost\n\n}identical, containing the same characters and story and so forth. Unlike\n\n}Paganitzu, however, Chaganitzu does not adapt to the speed of your computer,\n\n}making it virtually unplayable on fast computers.\n\n}\n\n}Following his success with Apogee's Paganitzu, Schuler began a sequel\n\n}in early 1992 entitled, \"Paganitzu II: the Bloodfire Pendant.\" Later, it\n\n}went through a name change to \"Alabama Smith and the Bloodfire Pendant.\"\n\n}Still later, its name became \"Realms of Chaos,\" losing all its Paganitzu\n\n}references in the process.\n\n}\n\n}Realms of Chaos was originally supposed to be a 16 color EGA game, slated\n\n}for a 1994 release, but, with the increasing popularity of VGA games, it was\n\n}decided that time should be spent converting Realms of Chaos to a 256 color\n\n}VGA game. Realms of Chaos should be available from Apogee sometime in the\n\n}second quarter of 1995.\n\n}\n\n}Contrary to what one might think, the 3D Realms project \"Ruins: Return of the\n\n}Gods\" was not ever associated with Paganitzu, even in its early days.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n[3] Lists\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n[3.1] Games\n\nPlease note that this information is constantly changing, especially when new\n\ngames are added to the list of Apogee products.

Ratings are given\n\nin several different categories. I try to make the ratings fairly objective,\n\ncompensating as best I can for any personal bias. Ratings are given on a\n\nscale of 1-5. 2.5 is a mediocre rating. Anything less is substandard.\n\nA 3 rating would only impress fans of the genre (or games in general). 4 is\n\nexcellent. 5 does not mean perfect (in the computer gaming world, perfection\n\nis never achieved, for somebody always comes out with something one step\n\nbetter), but it does mean you're nuts if you don't love it. :-)\n\nFor the \"graphics\" field, the letter indicates (T)ext, (C)GA, (E)GA, (V)GA,\n\nor (S)VGA. The rating rates how artistically the graphics are used. The\n\n\"sound\" field rates the sound. The \"enemies\" field rates how unique and\n\ninteresting the enemies are. The \"level\" field rates the design of the\n\nlevels. The \"gameplay\" field rates how well the game \"works.\" The \"overall\"\n\nfield is not an average, but rather how lastingly enjoyable the game is to\n\nplay. \"Gameplay\" as a strong influence on this rating. Blank fields mean\n\nthat I don't (yet) feel qualified enough to give an opinion.\n\nOne final note: in Joe Siegler's words, \"Ultimately, you, the reader, are\n\nthe only person who can make up your own mind about whether a game is good.\n\nBeauty is in the eye of the beholder, and so is the enjoyment factor of\n\ncomputer games. Only you can decide whether you'll like our games or not.\"\n\nName Graphics Sound Enemies Level Gameplay Overall\n\n---- -------- ----- ------- ----- -------- -------\n\nSpear of Destiny V 4 4 4 4.5 5 5\n\nWolfenstein 3D V 4 4 4 4 5 5\n\nRaptor: Call of the Shadows V 5 5 2.5 3.5 4 5\n\nDuke Nukem I E 2.5 1.5 4.5 5 4.5 4.5\n\nDuke Nukem II V 4.5 4.5 5 4 4 4.5\n\nAlien Carnage V 4.5 4 3 4 3.5 4\n\n}Monster Bash E 2.5 5 4.5 4 3.5 4\n\n}Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold V 3.5 3.5 3.5 3.5 4 3.5\n\nBio Menace E 2.5 2 4.5 4 3.5 3.5\n\nCrystal Caves E 2 1.5 3.5 4.5 4 3.5\n\nSecret Agent E 2 1.5 3 4 3.5 3.5\n\nCommander Keen: Aliens E 3.5 3 3 3.5 3.5 3.5\n\nCommander Keen: Galaxy E 3.5 3 3 3.5 3.5 3.5\n\nMajor Stryker E 3 3.5 3 3.5 3.5 3.5\n\nWacky Wheels V 3.5 3 N/A 3 3.5 3\n\nMystic Towers V 3.5 4 2 3 3 3\n\nCosmo's Cosmic Adventure E 3 2 3 4 3 3\n\nCommander Keen: Vorticons E 1.5 1.5 2 2.5 3 3\n\nWord Rescue E 1.5 3 3 3 3 3\n\nMath Rescue E 1.5 3 3 3 2.5 3\n\nPaganitzu E 1 2.5 N/A 3 3 3\n\nHocus Pocus V 4.5 1.5 2.5 1.5 2 2.5\n\nArctic Adventure C 1 1 1.5 3 3 2.5\n\nDark Ages E 1.5 2 2 2 2.5 2\n\nThe Kroz Series T 1 1 1 3 3 2\n\nMonuments of Mars C 1 1 1.5 2.5 2.5 2\n\nPharaoh's Tomb C 1 1 1.5 2.5 2.5 2\n\nBoppin V 2.5 1 N/A 2.5 1.5 1.5\n\nBlake Stone: Planet Strike V\n\nRise of the Triad V\n\n[3.2] Past projects\n\n[3.2.1] What Apogee games are no longer supported?\n\nApogee no longer takes orders, technical support calls, or offers any other\n\nform of support for the following games: The Thor Trilogy, SuperNova, Beyond\n\nthe Titanic, Word Whiz, and Trivia Whiz.

First, make sure your system meets the hardware\n\nrequirements of the game. If they don't, you probably can't run the game\n\nwithout upgrading your hardware.\n\nSecond, make sure you have the most recent version of the game. Many older\n\nversions of games have bugs that are fixed in the most recent versions.\n\nThird, if there is a XXX-HELP.EXE file that came with the game, read it.\n\n(Most registered Apogee games have such a file on the first game disk;\n\nwith shareware versions, you might find it there and possibly in the directory\n\nthe game was installed to as well.) This file will contain numerous common\n\ntechnical problems with their solutions. There are plans underway to make\n\na file available on-line which will contain all the current versions of\n\nthe technical support files in them.\n\nIf the game is failing to start due to insufficient memory, you can try\n\nremoving TSRs, or booting \"clean.\" With MS-DOS 6.0 or greater, you can do\n\nthis by holding down either the shift key or F5 while the system is booting.\n\nThis causes your autoexec.bat and config.sys files to be bypassed. If you\n\nare running a memory manager, try removing the manager altogether; this\n\nseems to fix most problems Apogee games have with EMS/XMS memory. Additional\n\nsuggestions on how to free up memory may be in the XXX-HELP.EXE file.\n\nAlso, you may want to check the cheats section of this FAQ, as, for some\n\ngames, it lists several technical support parameters you can pass to the\n\ngame. Sometimes this fixes problems with certain pieces of hardware.\n\nIf you problem is your Soundblaster card (or a Soundblaster emulating card),\n\nthen the problem may be the settings on the card or the BLASTER environment\n\nvariable. Check the section on that subject below.\n\nWith regard to drive compression, Apogee has tested their entire product\n\nline with Stacker 3.1, Stacker 4.0, and MS-DOS 6.22's DriveSpace. The\n\nproducts all worked fine, except for Monster Bash which suffered a slowdown\n\nusing DriveSpace.\n\nIf you've tried everything and still can't get an Apogee game to work\n\ncorrectly, contact Apogee's technical support services. These are listed\n\nunder \"Contacting Apogee.\"\n\n[6.2] Setting the BLASTER environment variable\n\nThis section may be useful if you are having problems with sound or music in\n\nan Apogee game.\n\nApogee games that use Sound Blasters look at the BLASTER environment variable\n\nto figure out where to send its sound output. Check to make sure that you\n\nhave the SET BLASTER line in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file. This code is an example,\n\nand probably isn't exactly what you need to put in your system.\n\nNOTE: Some of these parameters (P, H, & E) are dependant on certain types of\n\ncards. For example, the E is only needed if you have an AWE 32. The\n\nminimum requirements are to have the A, I, D, & T parameters. The other\n\nthree may or may not be needed depending on what type of card you have.\n\nPlease read this entire section to see if you need any of them. If you\n\nare using a clone card, or some card that's not a \"true\" Sound Blaster,\n\nthen you will most likely only need A, I, D, & T.\n\nSET BLASTER=A220 I5 D1 T3 P330 H6 E620\n\n| | | | | | | | |\n\n| | | | | | | | |_______ AWE 32 Only Parameter\n\n| | | | | | | |__________ \"High\" DMA Channel\n\n| | | | | | |_______________ MIDI Port\n\n| | | | | |__________________ Type of Card\n\n| | | | |_____________________ DMA Channel\n\n| | | |________________________ Interrupt\n\n| | |_____________________________ Port Address\n\n| |___________________________________ Environment Variable\n\n|________________________________________ DOS Command\n\nNOTE: There can be no spaces between the word BLASTER and the equal sign (=).\n\nIf you have a space in there, your system will read the parameter incorrectly,\n\nand it will not be recognized by our games.\n\nNow, these may not (most likely not) be the same for your board, because the\n\nPort Address, Interrupt and DMA Channel can be set by adjusting \"jumpers\" on\n\nyour sound board. Some newer cards have this information controlled by\n\nsoftware, please consult your card's manual for more information on how to set\n\nthese things. You should also check your manual if you are unclear as to how\n\nto tell what settings your card is set at. The information *IS* important, so\n\nit's recommended that you know precisely what the settings are. If you are\n\nusing a card that \"emulates\" the Sound Blaster (such as the Gravis UltraSound\n\nthrough software, or the PAS16), you should check your card's manual on how to\n\nset the card for Sound Blaster emulation.\n\nFor PORT ADDRESS, it's almost always 220. That seems to be the default for\n\nmost sound cards out there, and unless you know you've switched it away from\n\n220, it's a safe bet it's still there.\n\nThe INTERRUPT is something that varies from system to system. Mystic Towers\n\nand games prior to Raptor require that your IRQ be set at 7 or less. Apogee\n\ndoes not recommend using IRQ2, as it causes problems.\n\nThe DMA CHANNEL sometimes causes problems if it isn't set to 1, which is the\n\nusual default. If it is not set to one, some Apogee games may lock up.\n\nThe TYPE OF CARD should be 1 if you have an older Sound Blaster, or a Sound\n\nBlaster emulating card. Use 3 if you have a newer plain Sound Blaster. Use\n\n2 for an older Sound Blaster Pro. Use 4 for a newer Sound Blaster Pro.\n\nThe MIDI PORT parameter will only be needed if you are using a card that has\n\nMIDI capabilites. If so, this is where you define what MIDI port you are\n\nusing. 330 seems to be the default, so if you have a MIDI card, and you\n\nhaven't changed anything from factory defaults, this is probably where it still\n\nis.\n\nThe HIGH DMA CHANNEL is something that is used primarily on Sound Blaster 16\n\ncards. This is not the same as the standard DMA channel, this is a different\n\none. This is only used if you're using a 16 bit sound card capable of playing\n\n16 bit Sound Blaster sounds. By default, this is usually 5, so unless you know\n\nthat it's something else, it's probably still 5.\n\nThe E620 parameter is something that is needed _only_ if you have a Creative\n\nLabs AWE 32 sound card. If you have one of these, this parameter will have\n\nbeen set up properly assuming you've installed the software that came with the\n\ncard. Check your AWE 32 documentation for a more thorough explanation of what\n\nthis parameter is used for.\n\n[6.3] By game\n\nThis section contains some common problems, and their solutions, for specific\n\nApogee games. In addition to perusing this section, you might want to look\n\nat the cheats section; technical support parameters are listed there also,\n\nwhich may help to fix your problem. Again, please make sure you are running\n\nthe most recent version of the game, since older versions may contain bugs\n\nthat are fixed in newer versions.\n\n[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]\n\nProblem: I can't save or load games.\n\nSolution: Increase the value \"files\" is set to in your config.sys. Note that\n\nif you booted clean, this would have been bypassed.\n\nProblem: My mouse will only go in a corner of the screen.\n\nSolution: This is usually due to an old version of your mouse driver. Check\n\nwith the mouse manufacturer to see if a more recent version is\n\navailable.\n\n[Duke Nukem II]\n\nProblem: Certain levels lock on me.\n\nSolution: There's no good solution for this yet. It's a sprite problem,\n\nand Apogee isn't really sure how to fix it. You could try\n\nrebooting and trying the level again. If the problem persists,\n\nthen playing on a lower difficulty level might help.\n\n[Monster Bash]\n\nProblem: In episode 3, I can take the broom and, in one place, fly off the\n\ntop of the screen. Then the game crashes.\n\nSolution: Don't go up there; there's nothing of value there.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n[7] Cheats\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\n[7.1] Overview\n\nApogee has almost always made a point of putting cheats in their games, both\n\ndocumented and undocumented. In their later games, however, these cheats are\n\nonly available in the registered versions of the games. From 1987 to\n\naround May 1993, Apogee games came with a hint sheet, which often contained\n\ncheats in them. From May 1993 to December 1993, Apogee games were shipped\n\nwith a XXXXHINT.EXE file, which had the same text as the old hint sheets.\n\nBeginning in 1994, the XXXXHINT.EXE files are done away with too; the\n\ninformation is now contained in the actual game manuals.\n\nThe cheats listed in the complete cheat list are subdivided by category.\n\nThe customer cheats are the cheats listed in the hint sheet, hint file, or\n\ngame manual that comes with the game. Some of the games also have a debugging\n\nmode, which is not generally documented. Their original purpose is to aid in\n\nthe beta testing of the game. Lots of times, however, the debugging mode is\n\nleft intact, available for the regular game-player to use. Finally, there are\n\ntechnical support parameters, which are not really cheats, but are used to\n\ncorrect some technical problems.\n\n[7.2] What's that about cows and monkeys in Raptor?\n\nRaptor was written by Cygnus, and it seems to be a birthday present to\n\nthemselves. Whenever Raptor is started when your system's clock matches the\n\nbirthday of one of the people at Cygnus (a list can be found in the complete\n\ncheat list section), then Raptor behaves a little strangely. First, the\n\nApogee logo is displayed, but not with Apogee's trademark music. Instead,\n\nyou hear the Cygnus folks, sounding a little tipsy, humming the Apogee theme\n\nmusic themselves. In addition, some of the Raptor levels contain enemies\n\nthat don't normally appear such as monkeys who throw coconuts at you, raptor\n\ndinosaurs scurrying across he screen, and cows with machine guns concealed\n\nbeneath their hides. Most of these peculiar enemies appear on the first\n\nmission of the game, and they are invariably difficult to kill.\n\nFinally, when you exit the game, you get to hear the member of Cygnus whose\n\nbirthday it is give an impersonation of a monkey. This might consist of\n\nhooting or screeching sounds, or simply an eloquent rendering of the word\n\n\"monkey.\"\n\nNow the reason this section is in with the cheats is because there is a way,\n\nbeyond setting the system time to a particular birthday, of getting the\n\nmonkeys and raptors and cows to fight you. When the screen comes up where you\n\nmust choose a sector to fly, flip the switch at the bottom center of the\n\nscreen by clicking on it with the mouse. It should darken. This activates\n\nthe three lights to the right of this switch. In version 1.0 of Raptor, you\n\nshould turn on the first and third lights; in v1.1 and v1.2 of Raptor, you\n\nshould turn all three lights on. Then you can select a sector or \"auto\n\npilot\" and fly the level. You'll know the cheat worked if you hear a static-\n\nlike sound. All levels have some new enemy that appears by using this cheat,\n\nthough sometimes they are small and inconspicuous. Besides monkeys, cows,\n\nand raptors, there are: the ship from 2001: A Space Odyssey, the ship from\n\nSpace 1999, pedestrians, a woman sunbathing on a roof, and other miscellaneous\n\nitems.\n\n[7.3] Complete cheat list\n\nThis section contains a variety of cheats from various Apogee games.\n\nActually, in the words of Joe Siegler, it's \"the first comprehensive cheat\n\n[list] ever published for all Apogee titles.\"\n\nNote that while the customer cheat keys are officially supported by Apogee,\n\nthe debug keys are not. If you use the debug keys, Apogee cannot provide\n\nany support, since this alters game performance to a state where their\n\nstandard support comments and issues might not apply. In short, neither\n\nApogee or I can be held responsible for damage caused by usage of the debug\n\nkeys. (Though, as a word of reassurance, I have never heard of such a thing\n\nhappening, save where expressly noted below.)\n\n[Rise of the Triad]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - Type in each cheat code, letter by letter, to get the\n\n} desired effect.

These work only in the registered\n\nversion:\n\n[ctrl] [F] - go to the final battle for the episode\n\n[alt] [H] - delivers one maximum hit during the final battle\n\n[ctrl] [F5] - add one credit to player one (nine maximum)\n\n[ctrl] [F8] - add one credit to player two (nine maximum)\n\n[1] or [!] - set lives for player one to zero *\n\n[2] or [@] - set lives for player two to zero *\n\n* These two cheats may not work if the shift key is used for a button.\n\nFinally, in v1.1 of Boppin, the command line parameter \"blood\" may\n\nbe used to access the violence mode from v1.0.\n\n[Wacky Wheels]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - The following command line parameters can be used in\n\nboth the shareware and registered versions of the game:\n\n/2 Fast gameplay.\n\n/3 Really fast gameplay.\n\n/debug Create a ERR.LOG file as you play.\n\nturbo Activate the turbo key [brake]+[fire].\n\njump Activate the jump key [brake]+[accelerate].\n\nAdditionally, you can specify ONE of the following three weapon parameters:\n\nhog Get 99 hedgehogs.\n\nice Get 99 ice cubes.\n\nfire Get 99 fireballs.\n\n[Mystic Towers]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - Cheats are activated by typing \"BALDRIC\" during a level.\n\nOnce actived, your score is reset to zero, and you can\n\npress the following key combos to achieve what is listed:\n\n[lshift] R xx - where xx is a number of a room to jump to (01-45)\n\n[lshift] H - to get maximum health, also food and drink\n\n[lshift] K - to get all keys except the end tower key\n\n[lshift] W - to get full weapons\n\n[lshift] C - to get ten coins\n\nOnly the health cheat works in the shareware version; the\n\nrest require the registered version.\n\n[Hocus Pocus]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - Type these:\n\nFEELGOOD - full health\n\nBLAKE - both keys\n\nBANANA - laser shots (registered version only)\n\nQUARK - rapid fire (registered version only)\n\n[Raptor: Call of the Shadows]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - The backspace key will restore all your energy and give\n\nyou a death ray, at the cost of all your money. This\n\nwill only work in the registered version.\n\n+ Debug mode - Set the environment variable \"S_HOST\" to the value \"CASTLE\"\n\nat the DOS prompt by typing \"SET S_HOST=CASTLE\" (it must be\n\nin caps). Then, when you play Raptor, you become completely\n\ninvincible, and have all the weapons at your disposal.\n\n+ Warp - There is a level warp built into the game, so you can see any level\n\nyou want at any time. What you need to do is to get to the screen\n\nwhere you see the level selection (Bravo Sector, etc...). The warp\n\ncombination is a 2 key entry. The keys are not to be pressed at the\n\nsame time. Note that you cannot use the level warp unless debug\n\nmode (see above) is active.\n\nKey 1 - Z, X, or Y (Z is Episode 1, X is Episode 2, and Y is Episode 3)\n\nKey 2 - Any key between Q and O on the keyboard. Q is Level 1, and O is\n\nLevel 9.\n\nThis works in both the shareware and registered versions. Note that if you\n\ntry and warp to a registered episode from the shareware version, it will\n\ncrash the game.\n\n+ Other notes - With a hex editor, change bytes 27h and 28h of a Raptor saved\n\ngame file (char????.fil) to the value FF. When you load this\n\nsaved game, you'll have a few million dollars to spend on\n\nequipment. If you don't have a hex editor, there are some\n\nprograms available that do this for you. RapCheat is one;\n\nRapCash is another. Both should be available at ftp.uwp.edu\n\nunder the directory /pub/msdos/games/romulus/cheats. Some\n\npeople have reported problems using RapCash; I don't know if\n\nthese problems have been fixed since or not.\n\n+ Birthday Mode - As mentioned above, the \"Birthday Mode\" will automatically\n\nput you into \"Battle Cow\" mode, and it will also play the\n\ngoofy Apogee theme song. To get it, change the system's\n\ndate to the birthday of one of the Cygnus programmers, given\n\nbelow. Any year should be ok, as long as it's not in the\n\npast:\n\nMarch 12 Bobby Prince\n\nMay 16 Scott Host\n\nAugust 28 Rich Fleider\n\nOctober 2 Jim Molinets\n\nNote that in v1.0 of Raptor, Bobby Prince's birthday wasn't\n\nrecognized, but that the birthday of Tim Neveu *was*.\n\nYou can also get \"Battle Cow\" mode by darkening the switch\n\non the \"choose sector\" screen, and turning on all three\n\nlights on the right (for v1.0, don't turn on the middle\n\nlight). You don't get the goofy Apogee theme song if you do\n\nit this way, however.\n\n[Blake Stone: Aliens of Gold and Planet Strike]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - [J] [A] [M] [Enter] - These keys are to be pressed one at a\n\ntime. When all are pressed, the message \"Now you're\n\nJammin'\" appears, and you will be given all keys, and you\n\nwill get 100% health. Your score will also be taken to 0.\n\nThis will only work on the registered version of the game.\n\n+ Debug Mode - Command Line Parameters\n\nPOWERBALL - Enables debug keys. This also requires that you hold down the\n\nleft and right shift keys during the JAM Logo intro. Don't\n\nhold them down until the white letters start to appear.\n\nOnce the PC-13 screen is loaded, you can let go. You will hear\n\na \"ching\" sound during the intro when debug mode has been\n\nsuccessfully enabled. The \"ching\" sound will only happen if\n\nyou have a sound card. If you have a PC speaker, you won't hear\n\nthis.\n\nTICS - Display TIC INFO in score area.\n\nMUSIC - Enable music test mode: [backspace] [arrows] changes music.\n\nRADAR - Displays a rotating overhead view during gameplay. Please note\n\nthat this REALLY slows the game down, to the point of being\n\nunplayable.\n\nThese cheat keys can be use during gameplay only if you invoked\n\nthe program with the \"powerball\" parameter:\n\n[backspace] W - Warp to level ([shift] [W] loads the default map)\n\n[backspace] D - Player invisible (dumb objects)\n\n[backspace] G - God mode\n\n[backspace] I - Item cheat\n\n[backspace] M - Memory info\n\n[backspace] P - Pause screen\n\n[backspace] Q - Fast quit\n\n[backspace] A - Add Actors to AutoMapper.\n\n[backspace] U - Unlock all floors\n\n[backspace] O - Show hidden walls on auto mapper\n\n[backspace] E - Quick Win Mission\n\n[backspace] B - Border color\n\n[backspace] C - Count objects\n\n[backspace] F - Facing spot\n\n[backspace] H - Hurt self (only if not in God mode)\n\n[backspace] S - Slow motion\n\n[backspace] V - Extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do\n\nnothing for most users)\n\n[backspace] [home] - Dec sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)\n\n[backspace] [pgup] - Inc sky color (if ceiling textures are OFF)\n\n[backspace] [end] - Dec ground color (if ground textures are OFF)\n\n[backspace] [pgdn] - Inc ground color (if ground textures are OFF)\n\n[backspace] + - Add shading depth (if textures are OFF)\n\n[backspace] - - Dec shading depth (if textures are OFF)\n\n[backspace] ] - Inc shading drop off (if textures are OFF)\n\n[backspace] [ - Dec shading drop off (if textures are OFF)\n\n[shift] [tab] - Show full automap containing all live actors.\n\nThese cheat keys can be used during gameplay:\n\n[6] [7] - Collect all bonus items (gold, ammo, health, etc).\n\n[7] [8] - Kill all actors.\n\n[6] [8] - Collect all bonus items and kill all actors.\n\n+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters - These aren't really debug codes, or\n\ncheats, either. They're in here for Apogee's Tech Support to use in\n\nassisting customers who might be having problems running the game.\n\nVERSION - Display version information.\n\nSYSTEM - Display system information.\n\nHIDDENCARD - Disable checking for video card.\n\nNOJOYS - Disable checking for joysticks.\n\nNOMOUSE - Disable checking for mouse.\n\nNOMAIN - Disable checking for main memory.\n\nNOEMS - Disable checking for EMS memory.\n\nNOXMS - Disable checking for XMS memory.\n\nNOAL - Disable checking for Adlib.\n\nNOSB - Disable checking for Sound Blaster.\n\nNOPRO - Disable checking for Sound Blaster Pro.\n\nNOSS - Disable checking for Sound Source.\n\nSST - Disable checking for Tandy Sound Source.\n\nSS1 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT1.\n\nSS2 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT2.\n\nSS3 - Disable checking for Sound Source on LPT3.\n\nNO386 - Disable checking for 386.\n\nENABLEGP - Enables NoteBook GamePort checking. (This will do bad things if\n\nyou try it on an Acer.)\n\n[Duke Nukem II]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - For the registered version only, the following two codes\n\ncan be used during gameplay. Please note that all three\n\nletters have to be pressed at the same time.\n\n[E] [A] [T] - health is restored to maximum, but score is reset to zero\n\n[N] [U] [K] - get a random weapon, plus all inventory required to finish\n\nthe current level\n\n[Alien Carnage]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [B] [I] [G] all at the same time will give you\n\nfull health and jetpack power.\n\n+ Debug mode - The following debug keys work for version 1.1 of Halloween\n\nHarry only:\n\n[ctrl] [R] [E] [N] - Gives you all weapons, and activates\n\ngod mode for several seconds.\n\n[alt] [L] - Level warp. Type the number of the\n\nepisode (1-4), followed by the number of\n\nthe level (1-5). Illegal input will dump\n\nyou to DOS. This can not be used in the\n\nshareware version to access levels in the\n\nregistered version.\n\n[alt] [=] - Change location within a level. Type\n\ncoordinates after this code; illegal\n\ninput will probably crash the game.\n\n+ Tech Parameter - Pressing these four keys at the same time will show you the\n\ncoordinates you are at on the level. This serves no real\n\nfunction on its own, but it is used by Apogee's Game Hint\n\nLine sometimes to locate a player in a level. The keys are\n\n[ctrl] [alt] [rshift] [F12]\n\n+ Misc Command Line Parameter - \"skip\" will start the game directly from the\n\nmain menu.\n\n[Wolfenstein 3D / Spear of Destiny]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - Pressing [I] [L] [M] all at the same time, will give you\n\nboth keys, and will give you 100% health. It will also\n\ntake your score to zero. This cheat will work in both the\n\nshareware and the registered version.\n\n+ Debug mode -\n\nThe debug mode is activated with a different command line parameter\n\ndepending on what version of the game you have.\n\nv1.0 -> -next\n\nOnce in the game, press [ctrl] [tab] [enter] to activate.\n\nv1.1+ -> -goobers\n\nOnce in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.\n\nSpear -> -debugmode\n\nOnce in the game, press [lshift] [alt] [backspace] to activate.\n\nOnce activated, these are the keys you can use.\n\n[tab] [Q] - Quit\n\n[tab] [W] - Warp to level xx\n\n[tab] [E] - Exit to next level\n\n[tab] [T] - Debug info in memory\n\n[tab] [I] - Free items\n\n[tab] [O] - Map of level (only works in beta versions of Wolf3D)\n\n[tab] [S] - Slow motion\n\n[tab] [F] - Position info\n\n[tab] [G] - God mode (no damage)\n\n[tab] [H] - Hurt yourself\n\n[tab] [X] - Extra stuff (???)\n\n[tab] [C] - Statistics\n\n[tab] [V] - Add extra VBLs (Vertical Blanking Signal -- this will do nothing\n\nfor most users except maybe increase or decrease\n\nthe game speed.)\n\n[tab] [B] - Change border color\n\n[tab] [M] - Memory map\n\n[tab] [N] - No clipping (walk through walls)\n\n(This works only in Wolf3D v1.0 shareware. This mode can cause\n\nreally bad things to happen to the game, including corrupting\n\nitself, which is why it was taken out.)\n\n+ Tech Support Command Line Parameters are the same as in Blake Stone, except\n\nVERSION, SYSTEM, and ENABLEGP do nothing in Wolf3D.\n\n+ Misc Command Line Parameter - \"NOWAIT\" will start the game directly from\n\nthe main menu.\n\n+ Note 1: If you press [B] [A] [T] all at once, you'll get a message wondering\n\nwhy you're trying to cheat, since this is the old Keen Galaxy cheat\n\ncode.\n\n+ Note 2: For Spear only, if you do nothing in the game for 30 seconds, BJ\n\nwill either cross his eyes or stick his tongue out at you. It\n\nhappens quickly, so you have to watch carefully.\n\n[Bio Menace]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - [C] [A] [T] - During gameplay, you can press these three\n\nletters at the same time, and you will receive the machine\n\ngun, 99 ammo, & 99 grenades.

Hold\n\ndown [Z] first; since the [F10] key, by itself, has meaning\n\nin the game, the cheat won't work if you push both down at\n\nthe same time and the [F10] is the first to register.\n\n[Commander Keen: Goodbye Galaxy! and Aliens Ate My Baby Sitter]\n\n+ Customer Cheat - Pressing the [B] [A] [T] keys all at once will give you 99\n\nshots, an extra life, and all the gems.
