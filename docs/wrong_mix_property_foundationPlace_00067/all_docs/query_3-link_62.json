        "text": "Appearance Upgrade: Light & Dark Mode\n\nThe user interface of Wise Disk Cleaner has two modes, light mode, and dark mode. According to your usage habits, you can freely choose to switch between the two modes. If you have normal vision or are receiving correction, you will see more clearly in light mode. While working in the light mode for a long time late at night may make your eyes sensitive, switching to dark mode can relax your eyes.\n\nSecurely Cleans Up Useless Files & Makes Your Computer Run Faster\n\nOver time, junk files, temporary files, all kinds of system files and other items you do not need at all accumulate on your Windows Computer. Those useless files take up valuable hard disk space and slow down your computer. Wise Disk Cleaner can delete these unnecessary files on your hard disk to free up disk space and make your computer run faster. It also provides many custom options to allow advanced users to clean up more files they donât need. Equipped with advanced algorithms, Wise Disk Cleaner can scan and remove them within seconds, making it one of the most efficient disk cleaners out there.\n\nCleans Internet History & Other Traces - Protecting Your Privacy\n\nWise Disk Cleaner can clean Internet histories, cache files, and cookies of Internet Explorer, MS Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Safari and other browsers. It also detects and cleans all other traces caused by Windows System, components and other applications. By removing all these traces thoroughly, your privacy will be well protected from prying eyes.\n\nDo you want to know how to prevent items pinned to Quick Access from being cleaned?\n\nImprove Your PC Performance by Defragging & Re-arranging Files on Your Disks\n\nYour hard disk drive will get fragmented over time. Fragmentation makes your hard disk do extra work that can slow down your computer. The Disk Defrag feature of Wise Disk Cleaner can rearrange fragmented data so your disks and drives can work more efficiently. It also offers you a clear graphic chart of the selected drive, letting you know the drive usage at a glance. You can also use it to analyze and defragment any external storage devices.\n\nScheduled Automatic Disk Cleaning\n\nYou can set Wise Disk Cleaner to clean the disk on a daily, weekly, or monthly schedule according to your own need. Wise Disk Cleaner will automatically clean up the useless files in the background when the scheduled time is up. In settings, you can also create a Clean with 1-click icon and place it on the desktop. With this feature, you can clean up the junk files by just clicking the icon without opening Wise Disk Cleaner."
