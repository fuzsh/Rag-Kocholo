        "text": "Feminine hygiene options have been moving beyond just pads and tampons – and the menstrual disc is the latest alternative to join newer innovations like the menstrual cup and period pants. These two methods, together with the sponge and the practice of free bleeding, have rightly opened up the options available to women and people who menstruate.\n\nAlthough some of these options have been on the market for more than a decade, we've definitely seen the conversation around menstruation get louder, bolder and less embarrassed (as it should be), with social media helping women to access more resources and platforms to discuss the options open to them. But along with finding something that's comfortable to us and our lifestyle, many of us are conscious about the impact our cycle can have on the planet, and are therefore we're seeking out solutions that are sustainable, too.\n\nWhat is the menstrual disc?\n\nIt shares its function (collecting period blood) and material (medical-grade silicone) with the menstrual cup but differs slightly in shape. It is more elongated, with a much shorter base than the cup. However it's usually equipped with a double rim that's more rigid and designed to prevent leakage. And some models come with a ribbed bottom to make removal a little easier.\n\nHow to use the menstrual disc?\n\nAs with the cup, learning to insert the menstrual disc is a process and, as such, requires some learning time. Inserting it is divided into the following steps:\n\nSqueeze the central part with your index finger and thumb until it has a figure eight shape.\n\nInsert it with the top side up and the cupped end closest to the hole.\n\nPush it gently with one finger behind your pelvic bone.\n\nTo make sure it is well positioned and will not leak, you can run your finger along the top of it.\n\nTo remove it, simply insert your finger, hook it under the rim and pull it out by gently.\n\nWhat is the difference between the menstrual cup and the menstrual disc?\n\nThe menstrual disc is generally more comfortable to wear when having penetrative sex since the shape is shallower\n\nIt can offer a better alternative for women who have a shorter cervix (and do not feel comfortable with the cup) or a weakened pelvic floor.\n\nWhere and how to insert them also differs. While the menstrual cup sits very close to the vaginal entrance and creates a vacuum, the disc sits below the cervix. And that means that they also have a different removal process.\n\nMany people find the menstrual disc messier as it's more difficult to keep it level and stop the blood from spilling out, so make sure you're over the toilet when you remove it. Plus it doesn't have a stem, like the menstrual cup, to grab onto when removing, which can make it trickier.\n\nThe lifespan of each product is a little different, too. It depends on the manufacturer, but in general, a cup can be used for up to 10 years but, while a menstrual disc can be used for 2 years. Even so, both work out cheaper and better for the planet than single-use products.\n\nVariety: there are currently many brands and designs of menstrual cups available on the market, but there are less options when it comes to menstrual discs.\n\nHowever, they also share certain characteristics:\n\nBoth need to be sterilised before and after each use.\n\nBoth can be kept in for between 8 and 12 hours, depending on the amount of flow of each person and the model of the disc or cup.\n\nInstagram content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe best menstrual discs to buy now:\n\n1. Lumma\n\nOne of the most affordable models is the Lumma disc. Aesthetically it stands out for its multicolour tie-dye design, but its the ease of use that makes it one of the most popular models of discs, especially among new users since it has a silicone string incorporated in its design to make insertion and removal easier.\n\nIt is available in 3 sizes: S, M and L (depending on the height of the cervix).\n\nIt can be worn for up to 12 hours.\n\nIt is very comfortable.\n\nIt has an affordable price, similar to menstrual cups.\n\nSave when you shop with these Amazon promo codes.\n\nThe Ziggy Cup from Swedish brand Intimina is one of the pioneers. It is characterised by its hexagonal textured surface, designed for easy removal, and a petal shape, to do the same with the placement.\n\nAvailable in two sizes: A and B.\n\nUp to 8 hours of protection.\n\nIt has a double rim, which prevents leakage.\n\nRecommended for light to medium flow.\n\nCan be used for 2 years.\n\nIts price can be a little higher.\n\nIntimina Ziggy Cup 2\n\nSave when you shop with these Amazon promo codes.\n\n3. Softdisc\n\nAlthough less environmentally friendly than reusable ones, it is also possible to find single-use menstrual discs. Softdiscs are the best-rated on platforms like Amazon, where they have more than 17,000 reviews and an average score of 4.4 out of 5.\n\nThey can be worn for up to 12 hours.\n\nThey are disposable.\n\nThey have a smaller capacity.\n\nSave when you shop with these Amazon promo codes.\n\nThis feature originally appeared on GLAMOUR Spain."
