        "meta_description": "This is a picture from 1997 after a hardcore Quake1 deathmatch session with my friend Noel Stephens at Ion Storm (the 30th floor, a year before we moved up to the 55th floor).  The rule that I created (back at id Software with my friend Shawn Green) was that if you got beaten in a deathmatch your opponent could go absolutely nuts and degrade you and you had to just sit back and take it.  So after our insane deathmatching session in which Noel beat me down, I went freaknuts and grabbed my keyboard and started screaming and chopping at the legs of my computer table - and hacked at the leg until it folded up and the table fell down. Then Noel ran over and started yelling at me calling me all kinds of names and I had to just suck it down.   I subsequently did this to the table my computers were on and the entire table and computers, monitors, etc. all slid crashing to the floor.  Unfortunately I don't have a picture of that mess. :)",
