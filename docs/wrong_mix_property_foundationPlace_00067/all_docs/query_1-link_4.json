        "text": "John Romero — Softdisk alumnus, programmer and designer for Wolfenstein 3D and Doom, and KansasFest 2012 keynote speaker — will be honored with the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Game Developers Choice Awards. This award “recognizes the career and achievements of a developer who has made an indelible impact on the craft of game development and games as a whole”.\n\nReports Brendan Sinclair:\n\nRomero … is best known for his work on seminal first-person shooters like Wolfenstein 3D and Doom in the early ’90s, but his career extends considerably beyond that period in both directions.\n\nRomero’s game development career began in 1979, and he spent much of the ’80s working on a slew of Apple II titles before co-founding Id Software in 1991 and helping the company not only establish the first-person shooter genre but revamp game distribution with successful shareware hits like Commander Keen.\n\nGamesIndustry.biz\n\nWith this award, Romero joins the ranks of other Apple II alumni to have been so honored, including Richard Garriott (Ultima), John Carmack (Softdisk), and Tim Schafer (Maniac Mansion).\n\nThe award will be bestowed at this year’s Game Developers Conference (GDC), held March 20–24, 2023, in San Francisco, California."
