        "text": "Caleb Abraham (Université de Lausanne): Books and Itineraries: New Perspectives on the Genevan Collège de Rive Before the Academy (1559)\n\nScholarship concerning the Geneva Academy (1559–) and the nascent years of the Collège de Rive (1536–1538) abounds, yet the intermediary period between the establishments of these institutions remains comparatively underexplored. Prevailing historiography often presents a skewed, predominantly negative portrayal of the Collège de Rive during the 1540s and 1550s. This paper aims to rectify this oversight by offering fresh insights into the educational landscape of Geneva in the decade preceding the foundation of the Academy. Drawing upon overlooked sources, notably the records of the Hospital, this study reveals a curriculum at the Collège de Rive encompassing Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, consistent with the institution’s original mandate outlined in 1538. Through an examination of neglected archival materials, this paper posits the existence of a functional educational establishment capable of fostering proficient students in the liberal arts. Additionally, it scrutinizes the academic trajectories of select pupils who, having received instruction at the Collège de Rive, subsequently excel in their studies at various European universities. These findings challenge prevailing narratives and enrich our understanding of early modern pedagogy in Geneva.\n\nJack Arnold (Boston University): Noble Autonomy and the Development of Multiconfessionalism in Late Fifteenth Century Moravia\n\nThe large-scale settlement in the 1460s of the Unity of the Brethren to the Margraviate of Moravia, the eastern portion of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown, coincided with an increase in autonomy on the part of Moravian nobility in relation the center of royal power in Bohemia. Amidst the Bohemian-Hungarian War (1468–1478) and the subsequent twelve-year period which saw Moravia transferred to Hungary before its return to the Bohemian crown in 1490, the Moravian nobility were able to successfully consolidate their newfound freedom from royal oversight, including now their de facto protection of the heterodox Unity of the Brethren whom they had accepted as their subjects. Through this, multiconfessionalism became a part of Moravian policy and identity. Following the only major expulsion of the Unity in 1481 at the orders of the Hungarian king Matthias Corvinus, the nobility of Moravia protested and secured their return in 1485. This paper argues that these developments, autonomy for the nobility and the implementation of multiconfessionalism, were intrinsically intertwined. The Moravian nobility saw their autonomy from the political centers of power, be it Prague or Buda, as their right, and protecting their heterodox subjects was part of that. Through this, Moravia became the first multiconfessional society already by the end of the fifteenth century, setting the stage for its status as a religious haven following the beginning of the wider Reformation in the next century.\n\nJakub Basista (Jagiellonian University): A fruitful treatise of fasting wherin is declared what ye Christen fast is… Fasting and Humiliation in the Time of the English Reformation: Do We Know Everything?\n\nIn 1549 the archbishop of Canterbury, Thomas Cranmer, published the Book of Common Prayer, which was to become the fundamental book of the new religious order in the reformed English church. The Book contains prayers, defines holidays, discusses the administration of newly defined sacraments – in other words defines the everyday functioning of the changed Anglican religion. What may be striking is the absence of fasting in the church calendar. Fasting was abolished along with other superstitious and unholy practices of the Roman Catholic Church. This presentation wants to look at the phenomenon of fasting in the years of the English Reformation until 1662 and the publication of the third version of the Book of Common Prayer, which reintroduced the fasting days again. This issue has been looked at by various researchers, yet no full study and full answer why was fasting abolished and next restored, as well as how did it function in the 113 years, has been provided by historians. This presentation shows possible areas of research and future analysis of the topic.\n\nPeter Benka (Department of Slovak History, Faculty of Arts, Comenius University in Bratislava): Languages of Confessional Communities in the Royal Towns of Upper Hungary in the Seventeenth Century\n\nThe royal towns of Upper Hungary present a case of multilingual communities. During the early modern period, the town elites were still mostly German. The rural background of the towns – one of the sources for immigration into the urban communities – were mostly Slovak, with admixture of Ruthenian and Hungarian speakers in individual cases. Moreover, the burghers were involved in distant trade that brought new inhabitants from nearby Poland as well as from more distant regions in the German lands to the west or Balkan regions to the south-east. In terms of religion, the burghers accepted the Reformation ideas already around the middle of the sixteenth century and subsequently established Lutheran church organization. It remained in place until the last quarter of the seventeenth century when it was confronted with Counter-Reformation measures of the Habsburg rulers. This paper will look at the ways how the local churches managed to accommodate the above-mentioned linguistic heterogeneity during the seventeenth century, addressing questions such as: how was the Reformation ideal of making the faith available in vernacular languages put into practice in that context? What were the tools used on the institutional level and what were the expectations put on clergy that was supposed to serve speakers of various languages (often from quite different language groups)? What were the attitudes to non-Lutheran urban dwellers, distinct not only linguistically, but also confessionally – Uniate or Eastern Orthodox Ruthenians or “Greeks” from the Balkans, Polish Catholics or Calvinist Hungarian nobility? What challenges – and eventually changes – were brought by the Counter-Reformation, organized by the Habsburg court circles at the end of the seventeenth century? Thus, even though the Upper Hungarian towns were not large communities in terms of population, they represent an interesting case of interplay of confessional, linguistic, cultural, and ethnic identities in one place.\n\nJan-Andrea Bernhard (Institut für Schweizerische Reformationsgeschichte, Universität Zürich): Ulrich Bolt: Ein Reformator und Täufer auf der Flucht\n\nIm September 1524 kam Ulrich Bolt in die Kaplanei Fläsch (bei Maienfeld, CH), auf Empfehlung Ulrich Zwinglis hin. Er soll das Abendmahl unter beiderlei Gestalt ausgeteilt haben. Als aber der Täufer Konrad Grebel Mitte 1525 in Maienfeld auftrat, liess sich Bolt begeistern und sympatisierte immer mehr mit den Täufern. Nach dem vom Bundstag durchgeführten Täufergericht am 12. März 1526 in Maienfeld, verliess Bolt Fläsch, zog ins Amt Grüningen (CH), später nach Basel. 1528 trat er in Bern bei der Disputation auf. Seine Täuferhaltung blieb zeitlebens kryptisch. Seit über 100 Jahren sind keine ernsthaften Forschungen zu Bolt mehr betrieben worden, obwohl er einer der faszinierendsten Reformatoren der frühen Stunde war. In dem short paper sollen neue Erkenntnisse zum Täufertum in Graubünden im Allgemeinen und zu Ulrich Bolt im Speziellen präsentiert und kontextualisiert werden.\n\nMartin Berntson (University of Gothenburg): Were Muslim Turks Forcibly Baptized in Stockholm in the Seventeenth Century?\n\nIn a number of studies two or sometimes three forced baptisms of Turkish Muslims in Stockholm are mentioned during the seventeenth century. This paper argues that one or perhaps even two Turkish Muslims were indeed baptized in Stockholm 1672, but these baptisms were not forced. Likewise, there is no indication that the baptism of a Turkish Muslim 1691 should have been performed by any means of force. In the year 1686, at least seven Turks were baptized in Stockholm. Even though it is not possible to affirm that all baptisms were willingly accepted, and while it is not unreasonable that at least some of the baptized children and women initially had been forced to Sweden, there is no evidence of the acts of baptism being forced upon individuals. This paper discusses the idea that it should have been illegal to live as a Muslim in Stockholm during the last decades of the seventeenth century. It also discusses the function of the presumed forced baptism in immigration narratives being used as evidence of a Lutheran intolerant state which forced the people of Sweden to remain in a monolithic faith-culture until the late nineteenth century (or even later). This narrative has sometimes had a normative political undertone and is based on the presumption that a forceful legal policy issued through an intolerant Lutheranism still influences today’s Swedish citizens.\n\nAna Biočić (Catholic Faculty of Theology, University of Zagreb, Croatia): The Union of Marča – a Source of Conflict or Cooperation\n\nThe early modern period in Croatia was characterized by Ottoman conquests, leading to the migration of the indigenous population and the arrival of Orthodox communities in Croatian lands. One of such settlements was Marča, which was originally owned by the bishop of Zagreb. Here, the Orthodox settlers established a monastery and a church on the ruins of a former Roman Catholic church. Since the 1054 schism, there had been several attempts to unify the Eastern and Western Churches, such as the Council of Lyons in 1274 and the Council of Florence in 1439. A similar endeavor took place in Marča, thanks to the efforts of pastor Martin Dobrović, bishop Petar Domitrović of Zagreb, and bishop Simeon Vratanja of Marča. The idea was supported by Emperor Ferdinand II, who, in March 1611, appointed Simeon as the bishop, who subsequently convened an assembly in Marča. During this assembly, the union between the Orthodox Vlachs and Uskoks and the Roman Apostolic See was accepted, as confirmed in Pope Paul V’s apostolic letter Divinae maiestatis arbitrio. This paper seeks to address key research questions, including the territorial extent of the Marča diocese and its precise name. It argues that the success of this union depended on factors such as the politics of the Vienna court, the stance of Zagreb’s bishops, and the intricate relations between Greek Catholics and the Orthodox communities which kept arriving. Consequently, the paper delves into topics such as the selection of bishops in Marča and the attitudes of Emperors Ferdinand II and Leopold I toward Greek Catholics and Orthodox believers throughout the seventeenth century. In conclusion, the case of the Marča Union exemplifies the complexity of Christian relationships and highlights the influence of socio-political circumstances on religious communities and their survival.\n\nMattias Sommer Bostrup (Aarhus University): To Cross the Line: Interconfessionality and Interreligiosity in Early Modern Schleswig-Holstein\n\nDuring the seventeenth century, several sites of religious toleration were established in Schleswig-Holstein, i.e. Altona, Glückstadt, Friedrichstadt, and Nordstrand. Here, the ‘domestic’ Lutherans of the Danish-German borderland encountered ‘foreign’ Christians of other denominations, as well as Jews, and vice versa. These encounters meant different things to different people: for some, they were a reason to continue or even enhance confessional selfing/othering discourses; for others, being exposed to the ‘religious other’ was an experience that could lead to crossings of borders and to interconfessional or even interreligious acts. This paper focuses on religious life shaped by interconfessionality and interreligiosity with a special emphasis on Glückstadt and Nordstrand in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and it discusses the labelling of such cases as “tolerance”.\n\nValentina Bottanelli (FSCIRE): Cross Confession Contamination in Early Modern China and Dutch Batavia: Justus Heurnius’ Chinese-Latin Compendium Doctrinae Christianae (Bodleian Library, Marsh 456)\n\nIn the colonial context, interactions between the Catholic and Reformed churches were often marked by sheer conflict and mistrust. This was also the case in seventeenth-century Dutch Batavia, where the Portuguese legacy and the different doctrines on Baptism led Reformed consistories to see native Catholic converts as no more than Christians de nomine. At the time, the Batavian society was characterised by a mélange of ethnicities and languages, including a substantial community of Chinese immigrants, of whom a few had some elementary education in Mandarin language and classics, and were possibly familiar with the Jesuit catechetics in southern China. This set the stage for a unique experiment: Justus Heurnius, pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church, compiled in 1628 a Compendium Doctrinae Christianae in Mandarin Chinese and Latin. This text stands out significantly in terms of contents and structure when compared to other Protestant catechisms or doctrines, such as the coeval translation of the Heidelberg Catechism in Malay, by Sebastiaen Danckaerts, another pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in Batavia (Catechismus attau Adjáran derri agamma christáon, 1623). However, it shares terms and forms with the simultaneous Jesuit mission in China, even including a chapter of prayers directly from the euchologies of the Jesuit mission itself. The aim of this paper is to highlight the inter- and cross-confessional elements of Heurnius’ Doctrina in relation to the progress of the Dutch mission in Batavia and the Jesuit mission in southern China. The paper will focus on MS Marsh 456, of the Oxford Bodleian Library, the earlier existent version of Heurnius’ Compendium. Heurnius’ manuscript will then be compared with three editions of the Jesuits’ Chinese euchologue: 1602 edition, nihil obstat by Niccolò Longobardi (ARSI Jap-Sin I 172); 1605 edition, nihil obstat by Francisco Furtado (ARSI Jap-Sin I 57a); and 1628 edition, nihil obstat by Figueredo Rodrigue (BAV Racc. Gen. Or. III 214).\n\nTheo Brok (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam): Revisiting the Emergence and Spread of Anabaptism in the Southern Habsburg Netherlands (1530–1555)\n\nTo this day, the historiography of early Anabaptism in the Habsburg Netherlands has traditionally been shaped by the seventeenth-century perspective of the Dutch Republic of the Seven United Provinces. This narrative intentionally sidestepped the tumultuous events in Münster (1534–1535) and portrayed the rise of Dutch Anabaptism as primarily emerging from Friesland, Groningen, and Holland since 1530, while disregarding the (pre-)Anabaptist movements in the neighboring Lower Rhine. The prevailing view of the spread of Anabaptism in the southern provinces oversimplifies the interpretation of the past by suggesting a primarily unidirectional movement from north to south. This paper aims to challenge this dominant historiography, perpetuated and reconstructed in the nineteenth century within the new Kingdom of the Netherlands (1830–1839), which systematically ignored the enduring influence of key figures from the Lower Rhine, including Johannes Campanus (1500–1574), the ‘Wassenberg Predicants’, Gerhard Westerburg (d. 1558) and (post-)Münsterite Anabaptist bishops. Despite some previous scholarly interrogations of this retro-projected historical framework, the prevailing narrative persists, raising doubts about its accuracy. This paper seeks to underscore the east-to-west influence by tracing the spread and coherence of Anabaptism in the southern cities such as Aachen, Liège, Maastricht, Hasselt, Ghent, Antwerp, and Bruges. Through an examination of archival materials and a comparative analysis of existing historiographical narratives, this presentation seeks to provide an alternative to a ‘small (Northern) Netherlandish’ perspective, fostering a more comprehensive understanding of the broader territorial landscape of Dutch Anabaptism from the 1530s to the 1550s. This reassessment prompts scholars to reconsider established notions and re-examine the broader religious, economic, and socio-political contexts that contribute to the Anabaptist historical narrative.\n\nBenedikt Brunner (IEG Mainz): Contesting Sacralities. Native Americans, Puritan Missionaries, and the Fight for a New Sensescape in Colonial New England\n\nThe Puritan mission among Native Americans in the seventeenth century has not yet been studied from the perspective of sensory history. Yet the sources describing this missionary activity – mostly from the white, colonial perspective – are extensive and offer a variety of reference points. It is clear that very different concepts of what was considered sacred and how individual and communal life was to be led on this basis clashed here. A particularly telling example is the Puritan mission on Martha’s Vineyard among the Wampanoag. On this island, Puritan missionary efforts were perceived as relatively successful, as they were relatively permanent. Experience Mayhew, whose Indian Converts from 1723 is an important account, was already a third-generation missionary on the Island. Mayhew’s work was mainly aimed at demonstrating the successes of the missionary efforts to the international, mostly English donors of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. This paper will focus on the descriptions and evaluations of Native American sensory experiences that Mayhew repeatedly highlights at length as evidence of the success of missionary efforts. However, Native American conversions were, not infrequently, also a step of self-empowerment that enabled them to belong to the Christian community. These different assessments and experiential worlds are to be compared with each other. The question of the senses leads to the centre of the conflicts of norms that were characteristic of seventeenth-century New England.\n\nAmy Burnett (University of Nebraska-Lincoln): Erasmus and Reuchlin in the Correspondence Network of German Humanists on the Eve of the Reformation\n\nThe two most controversial issues that engaged German intellectuals on the eve of the Reformation were the Reuchlin affair and Erasmus’s edition of the Greek New Testament. Reuchlin was at the center of a correspondence network that linked German humanists during the second decade of the sixteenth century, and Erasmus joined that network when he moved to Basel in the summer of 1514. This paper will examine the correspondence of Germany’s two most famous humanists between 1510 and 1517 both as ego-networks and as components of this larger network. Using both quantitative and qualitative analysis, it will show how Reuchlin and Erasmus consciously used their letters, both private and published, to win support against their critics. It will also highlight the very different strategies that each employed to defend their reputation and ward off charges of heresy. Network visualization will demonstrate the geographic scope of the larger correspondence network to which the two men belonged and draw attention to those individuals who held significant places within the network. Finally, the paper will discuss the significance of network analysis for identifying the flow of news and information on the eve of the Reformation.\n\nStephen Burnett (University of Nebraska-Lincoln): Luther’s Against the Sabbatarians (1538) and Judaizing Christians in Electoral Saxony\n\nMartin Luther wrote Against the Sabbatarians against Jews and Judaism, but also against Judaizing Christians who sought to impose Old Testament law on other Christians. This paper argues that the book reflects Luther’s theological worries about sectarians in Electoral Saxony. His attacks on Christian observance of the Sabbath and imposition of Old Testament laws, and his worries about Jews teaching and circumcising Christians reflect challenges to church and magistrate in mid-1530s Saxony. Luther sought to address not only Moravian Sabbatarianism in his book, but also Saxon sectarianism.\n\nSimon Burton (University of Edinburgh): Reformed Scotism Revisited: The Case of William Ames\n\nWilliam Ames was one of the leading Puritan theologians of the seventeenth century and a pioneer of Reformed and Ramist system. Yet scholars still remain polarised between differing interpretations of Ames’ scholastic heritage with Richard Muller arguing for his “Calvinist Thomism” and Philip Fisk and Henri Krop arguing for major Scotist and even Nominalist elements in his theology. Discussion of Ames’ Scotism has also become deeply entangled with a welter of claims concerning his marked voluntarism. By resituating Ames in his Ramist context, with its marked drive towards a Christian philosophy, this paper supports a Franciscan and Scotist interpretation of Ames, while fully accepting his scholastic eclecticism and his appreciative reception of Thomist analogical and exemplaristic reasoning. Through examination of Ames’ use and transformation of important Scotist devices such as the formal distinction, esse cognitum, instants of nature and synchronic contingency it argues for his profound debt to Scotus and his school. At the same time, it also seeks to explain the definite fit of Calvinist Thomist and Nominalist elements within his broader Ramist and Scotist approach.\n\nIan Campbell (Queen’s University Belfast): Orthodoxy and Failure in Later Seventeenth Century Franciscan Political Thought: Cardinal Lorenzo Brancati da Lauria (1612–1693) and Angelo Volpi da Montepeloso (d. 1647)\n\nCardinal Lorenzo Brancati was described by Diomede Scaramuzzi in 1927 as “the most luminous figure of the golden century of Scotism”; he was certainly the most institutionally powerful Scotist theologian in Rome during the second half of the seventeenth century. Graduate of the College of St Bonaventure in the Conventual Franciscan house of SS. XII Apostoli, Brancati taught at Conventual studia throughout Italy before obtaining the chair in Holy Scripture at the Sapienza in 1654. He was nominated consultor and qualificator at the Inquisition in 1658, and prefect of studies at the Collegio Urbano de Propaganda Fide in 1665. He was appointed keeper of the Vatican Library in 1670. Innocent XI created him cardinal in 1681. Scaramuzzi argued that Brancati’s Commentaria on the third and fourth books of John Duns Scotus’s Ordinatio interpreted Scotus as a far-sighted precursor of the Council of Trent. Brancati defended Scotus vigorously against Jesuit criticism and sought to bring the Scotist theological textbook of his former senior colleague, Angelo Volpi da Montepeloso, to a conclusion. Is Scaramuzzi’s argument that Brancati sought to make Scotus safe for the Counter-Reformation true with regard to Scotus’s political doctrines? In what ways did Brancati retrieve or innovate doctrines of virtue, natural law, the origins of human society, and the powers of the prince? This paper will explore these questions, alongside the possibility that Brancati defended Volpi’s Sacrae Theologiae Summa Ioannis Duns Scoti against criticism in the Roman Inquisition during the 1650s, delaying the wholesale condemnation of Volpi’s combative and erratic brand of Scotism by fifty years.\n\nLiliana Castilho (Politecnic University of Viseu / CITCEM – Oporto University): Cardinal D. Miguel da Silva and the Introduction of Renaissance Aesthetics in Northern Portugal\n\nMiguel da Silva had a broad humanist culture, acquired at the universities of Paris and Siena and during his years as ambassador of the king of Portugal in Rome. From his long stay in Italy and constant contact with the pontifical court, its customs, achievements and agents, upon his return to Portugal, in 1525, he brought a new aesthetic and artistic taste. A lover of the arts and humanities, D. Miguel da Silva promoted the Renaissance architectural taste in Portugal and particularly in the spaces under his supervision, the bishopric of Viseu, S. João da Foz in Porto, and the monastery of Santo Tirso, counting on the work of architect Francesco de Cremona. He also became one of the great patrons in the national territory, promoting and contextualizing the spirit, the greatest example of which will be the infusion of the pictorial model of the pale commissioned by Vasco Fernandes, for the five chapels of the cathedral. He was the personification of il perfetto cortegiano (Baldesar Castiglione, 1528), who, in writing and through writing, marked an era, at the national and international level. In the city of Viseu, he renovated the episcopal palace of Fontelo, providing it with gardens designed in the Italian style, woods, lakes and huge cages that greatly impressed contemporaries. The low cloister of the cathedral church of Viseu also was commissioned by this prelate. After his appointment to the cardinalate in 1539, he also bequeathed the high choir chair to the city, against the will of D. João III, and had to flee to Rome. He resigned from the bishopric of Viseu in 1547, and never returned to the country: he died in Rome in 1556 and was buried in Santa Maria in Trastevere. He was responsible for the introduction of a purely Renaissance aesthetic, both at an architectural and pictorial level, in a geography (northern Portugal) and chronology (second quarter of the sixteenth century) in which these models were still unknown.\n\nMassimo Cattaneo (Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II): Natural Earthquakes and Revolutionary “Scourges”: Central Italy in 1799\n\nOn Sunday 28 July 1799, the city of Camerino – formerly a duchy and, during the eighteenth century, the seat of a papal governor – after some tremors that had occurred in the preceding days, was hit by a very strong earthquake that caused about sixty deaths and destroyed a large part of the city. Starting from this peculiar event, this paper aims to reconstruct, on the one hand, the impact of the earthquake on a wider territory, between Marche and Umbria but also Rome and Abruzzo (kingdom of Naples); on the other hand, this paper will place the seismic events in the context of the dramatic situation of the war provoked by the clash between the French and the Republicans following the invasion by the Austro-Russian army and the “insurgents” (counter-revolutionary troops). In this situation of confusion, in which the control of the territory was unstable, local institutions tried in some way to intervene, with innovative results if compared to the past. Moreover, the clergy and some religious orders, such as the Oratorian fathers of St. Philip Neri, played an important role in an area where the presence of former and pro-Jesuit priests and reluctant French priests who had found shelter in the Papal States, remained strong. The earthquakes also led to the ultimate “success” as a patron saint of earthquakes of St Emidio, as result of a long process that saw an important moment during the 1703 earthquake and affected not only from Norcia in Umbria to L’Aquila in Abruzzo, but also the rest of the Umbrian-Marchigiana Apennine ridge. Finally, this paper will analyze the policies and dynamics related to the reconstruction of Camerino, with the proposals made by the writers of the Georgian Academy of Treia for a more productive, rational management of the agricultural land, and with the interpretation of the French Revolution and its Italian consequences, as a scourge, a plague, an earthquake, as suggested by the most anti-Enlightenment and anti-revolutionary sectors of the Roman Church.\n\nSigrid Christensen (University of Copenhagen): Pietist Cross-Theologies in the Orphanages in Copenhagen and the Duchies\n\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century, Pietist ideas began to cross the borders of the Danish-Norwegian kingdom. The Pietist influence led to a rise in welfare institutions in Denmark and the duchies, as seen in the establishment of orphanages in Schleswig, Flensburg and Copenhagen. In both Schleswig and Flensburg, it was the awakened – including both laypeople and clergy – who were the driving forces behind the establishment of orphanages. In Copenhagen, however, it was the king, Frederik IV (1671–1730), who early on had a strong desire to establish an orphanage in Copenhagen, while more indirectly supporting the orphanages in the duchies. On the king’s birthday, 11 October 1727, the Royal Orphanage opened in Copenhagen, which was seen as a monument to Pietism in Halle. Modelled upon the orphanage in Halle, it also housed a church, a pharmacy and a printing press that distributed a wealth of Pietistic devotional literature. But was the theology within the Royal Orphanage so straightforward? Hitherto unexplored sources indicate that it was not exclusively the Hallensian-inspired theology that dominated the orphanage. This paper examines the cross-theologies within the walls of the Royal Orphanage in Copenhagen, emphasizing the care of the children and not least their religious education to make them good Christians and useful citizens, with perspectives on how this was achieved in the duchies.\n\nMattia Corso (Università Roma Tre): Between Devotion and Exploitation: Natural Sites and the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land between the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries\n\nOn 8 February 1637, Father Andrea d’Arco, the newly-appointed Custodian of the Holy Land, issued a decree calling for the preservation of the material traces left by Christ in the landscape of the Holy Land. A primary concern for the Custodian was the behaviour of the pilgrims who, blinded by a form of “unrestrained devotion”, avidly collected fragments of the places and objects which, during Christ’s life, were said to have come into contact with his sacred body, thus absorbing a permanent trace of his divine essence. Under the severe threat of excommunication, the decree forbade the collection of any material from some of the most sacred churches of the Christian religion, built on the sites associated with Christ’s birth, life, and death in the Gospels. These included the Church of the Holy Sepulchre and the Chapel of the Mount of Olives, both located in Jerusalem, as well as the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem. The order also extended its reach to several places where the divine traces were not enclosed within the walls of a church. As a result, natural sites in the Catholic topography of the region were equally brought under the religious authority of the Custodian, with excommunication imposed for cutting branches from trees and removing stones from streams. Beginning with Andrea d’Arco’s decree, this paper examines the Franciscan Order’s approach to natural sites in the Holy Land from the sixteenth to the seventeenth centuries, arguing that in the Franciscan mission in Ottoman-controlled Palestine nature was a crucial yet fragile resource, one that required a nuanced balance between exploitation and conservation. Focusing on the case study of the sacralisation and subsequent exploitation of a tree, the paper explores the complex interplay between spirituality and resource management in an early modern mission land.\n\nDidier Course (Hood College, Maryland): Hagiography, Geopolitics, Adventure Novel, or Amorous Tale? A Study on the Arabo-Muslim Motif in French Literature\n\nThe Moorish narrative experienced a unique popularity throughout the seventeenth century. Serving as a remarkable source of inspiration, it took on various forms and adapted its themes – pirates, abductions, interfaith loves, international politics, religious interference, emerging Orientalism, and even spiritual exercises – according to the rules of storytelling and genres. This paper aims to delineate the different incarnations that constitute a corpus delimited by the relationship between the Christian and the Muslim worlds in the literature of the time. While the theme was favored and addressed by nearly all forms of written expression – theater, novels, hagiographical literature, memoirs, travel accounts, or diplomatic reports – it is still necessary to extract the rules that govern not so much the genres themselves but the subject matter in general. This paper will be organized around three directions. Firstly, the Moorish narrative between fiction and historical reality; then, between generalization and individualism, and finally, between romance and religious edification. In order to conduct this study, we will analyze various texts, ranging from novels to the religious accounts of the Trinitarian fathers in North Africa, from the captivity of Saint Vincent de Paul to the memoirs of a French ambassador to Morocco, Pidou de Saint Olon.\n\nMaria Craciun (Babeş-Bolyai University of Cluj): Not Entirely a Man’s World: The Impact of the Reformation on the Lives of Early Modern Transylvanian Women\n\nEver since Susant Karant-Nunn discussed the impact of the Reformation on the lives of the women of Zwickau, scholarship, particularly of feminist ilk, has been tempted to deal with this issue. The impulse and motivation may stem from Karant-Nunn’s answer to the question asked. Based on the evidence analysed, Karant-Nunn concluded that, at least in Zwickau, apart from the lives of nuns and prostitutes, which had been completely disrupted by the decisions of the city councils to close convents and brothels, the Reformation had changed very little in the lives of ordinary women, in their traditional roles of wives and mothers, in their less-acknowledged presence as laborers or in their attitudes as pious individuals. Since the 1980s, a gendered perspective on the study of history has led to the exploration of the definition of women’s roles, their participation in religious life and their presence in the public sphere as opposed to the home and family. Within this broader geographical and historiographical context, a closer look at the history of Transylvanian women and their encounter with the Reformation would provide a new, peripheral perspective from the edges of Europe. Moreover, wishing to disengage from a focus on the elites, this study aims to integrate the issue of gender as an analytical category with other categories such as class, community and agency, highlighting social hierarchies and gendered power relations, while taking into account the intersection rather than the dichotomy of private and public. This study will consequently look at women’s relationship with groups, particularly gendered groups, such as nuns and tertiaries, at women’s position as wives in a world that idealised marriage and at women’s devotional patterns, forcefully redefined in the wake of the Reformation.\n\nDavide Dainese (University of Bologna | FSCIRE): Between Coexistence and Domination. Pietrino Belli as a Benchmark of an Ongoing Juridico-Political Transformation\n\nCanon law disciplining the presence of Latin Christendom in the Holy Land between the late eleventh century and the end of the thirteenth stands as testimony to to a decisive shift: from the logic of war (i.e. crusade) to that of coexistence. This periodization operates along two lines: that of the construction of a peculiar kind of auctoritas and that of an unappealable (and total) denial of rights shifting from the figure of the infidel to the heretic. During the age of the ius commune, this very legal framework shaped a new form of sovereignty, which, over the course of the long Iron Age, was remodeled by the wars of Italy and the wars – characterized by a religious dimension – that erupted following the Reformation. This paper presents a specific case: that of Piedmontese judge Pietrino Belli (one of the main hidden sources for Alberico Gentili and Hugo Grotius), 1502–1575, who served first under Charles V and Philip II of Spain and, after Cateau-Cambrésis, at the court of Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy as state counselor. Belli is an extraordinary witness to the forging of at least some characteristics of the modern state, as, in its theoretical assumptions, matured between Hobbes and Rousseau.\n\nDaniele De Camillis (DREST, Italian Doctoral School of Religious Studies): Intersecting Worlds: The Pious Schools and Rome’s Jewish Community in the Early Modern Era\n\nAgainst the backdrop of the connection between Jewish communities and religious institutions particularly focusing on the Catholic Church in the early modern era, Rome stands out as a remarkable case. The “Eternal City” has harbored one of the communities in Italy and across Europe for centuries. The coexistence of this Jewish community within Rome, a hub, makes it a crucial setting for studying interfaith, religious and cultural dynamics. Numerous studies delve into the history of Rome’s Jewish community and its interactions with both secular authorities and the Papacy. Within our discussion, we have an opportunity to explore a scenario involving the initiatives of the Pious Schools established by San Giuseppe Calasanzio and their impact on young Romans, including those from Jewish backgrounds. This research seeks to delve into an instance where the Pious Schools intersected with the Roman Jewish community. Accounts of Calasantian practices found in archival material have been transmitted through various narratives about the saints’ life presenting a unique model, within their orders’ historical tradition. In examining this case in relation to studies, the goal is to shed light on an intriguing angle regarding the potential connections between the Jewish community and the religious institutions of early modern Rome. Moreover, analysis of documents, such as Calasanctian correspondence addressing purported ties between the Piarists and the Jewish community, offers a chance to present a distinctive perspective on this dynamic.\n\nJulia Derzsi (Romanian Academy, Institute of Social Sciences and Humanities; Arbeitskreis für Siebenbürgische Landeskunde Sibiu): Social Order in the Multi-Ethnical and Multi-Confessional Communities of Southern Transylvania: Town Councils and their Rural Subjects in the Early Modern Period\n\nUnder the administration of the Saxon towns and seats in southern Transylvania (Sibiu/Hermannstadt and Brașov/Kronstadt), there were several serf villages whose inhabitants belonged to different ethnic groups (Romanians, Serbs or Bulgarians, Hungarians, and Germans), sometimes even within the same village. In the early modern period, the inhabitants of these villages, who often had different legal statuses, were subject to two different ecclesiastical jurisdictions, one under the German Lutheran bishop and the other under the Orthodox diocese. These communities were culturally very different, and their linguistic and (ethno-)religious identities did not always overlap. In addition to enforcing Protestant religious principles (translation and printing of the Bible and catechisms for the Orthodox and church visitation for the Protestants), the town councils also relied on good governance as a means of establishing social control and stability in the exercise of its landowning powers. In addition to enforcing public order (good policing) in many areas of daily life, it also sought to favour culturally homogeneous groups (Lutheran and German-speaking) to suppress mixed identities. This paper examines how the town councils used political instruments to manage social and religious tensions. How did the town councils reconcile the need to organise practical church life with measures to promote public order, and how did they extend their authority over the communities under their administration.\n\nAntonio Pio Di Cosmo (University of Modena and Reggio Emilia): The Virgin and Her Patronage: Analysis of Two Typologies of Devotion Productions and their Implications on Visual Culture\n\nThe lithographs connected to Loreto’s litanies, produced by the Kauber brothers, and published in 1763 represent the Virgin, who like a “lawyer” intercedes in favour of her Son and places her mantle between the Earth and God, focused on throwing arrows. The gesture connected to the mantle recalls the “covenant of Mercy” of the Coptic tradition, as the maximum expression of maternal care of the Virgin and the remarkable product of her intercessory power. We observe that the Enlightenment era welcomes the ancient function of the Virgin as a mediator and intercessor. The role of “lawyer”, winning all the court cases, is masterfully expressed in the prayer of Bernard of Clairvaux: “Memorare, Piissima Virgo Maria, a saecula non esse auditum quemquam ad Tua currentem praesidia, Tua implorantem auxilia, Tua petentem suffragia esse derelictum.” Thus, we considered that the religious material culture of Christianity generated a visual typus as the Aghiosoritissa or Advocata. Such descriptive formulas achieved success in the everyday devotion of Roman citizens between the eighth and thirteenth centuries. The effigy of the Virgin contemplates a singular proxemic, and represents the Madonna which turns to Christ her right hand, while her left is open to receive grace. Such an image reflects a belief shared in the collective unconscious: indeed, wives, mothers, and sister always exercised their influence on powerful men and convinced them to desist from exercising acts of force on the people. We encounter a successful woman, who exercises the role of “lawyer” and opposes her rhetorical ability against the exercise of violence, as an anthropological component of established power. The powerful attitude of the Virgin is proclaimed in a passage of the Libellus de Laudibus Mariae Virginis written by the monk Arnold of Bonneval (PL 189, col.1726C-D). The representation must convince the beneficiary about the effectiveness of Mary’s patronage.\n\nSilvia Di Giovanna (DREST, Italian Doctoral School of Religious Studies): Rabbis: Blessed or bien aventuradi? On the Death of Livornese Jews, between Suspicion and Outrage in the City of Nations\n\nArticle XXXVII of the Livornine Constitution, issued by Ferdinand I in 1591, reads: “Vi concediamo, che possiate comprare in Pisa & in Liuorno un campo di terra, per poter in esso sopelire i vostri morti, e che in esso non possiate esser molestati per quanto haueranno caro la gratia nostra” [We grant you that you may buy a field of land in Pisa and Livorno, and that you may bury your dead in it, and that in it you may not be harassed if you wish to have Our Grace]. Since then, the people of Livorno by birth and adoption of any nazione, on the strength of this grand-ducal concession that has permitted this exceptional experiment in cohabitation, the city have officiated the funerals of their deceased and buried their dead in cemeteries that can still be visited. Despite the great freedom granted, the case of Rabbi Malachaim Montefoscoli’s funeral in 1680 repeatedly returns to the chronicles and to the attention of scholars. The solemn funeral that was celebrated for this important rabbi of the community raised the suspicions of the young Livornese Gregorio Bonfigli, who decided to turn to the vicar of the Roman Inquisition to ask it to investigate whether there had been any wrongdoing. But why did the pompous funeral of a rabbi attract the attention and investigation of the Inquisition in Pisa? In truth, not only such ceremonies caused a stir: inscribing epitaphs on graves was considered an abuse, and inscriptions on Jewish tombstones often aroused suspicion and indignation in Catholic hierarchies, for fear that they might contain blasphemous concepts. The central question is tracing how under the Grand Duke’s shadow it was possible to preserve and enhance the specificity of the minorities, in this case the nazione ebrea, and how over time these minorities found obstacles to respecting their traditions. Is it possible that this compromise, between concession and resistance, produced the result made up of bilingual epitaphs and syncretic traditions.\n\nYunus Dogan (European University Institute, EUI): A Tale of Two Faiths: When Local Christians Encounter New Christians\n\nIn Part II, Chapter 54 of Cervantes’ Don Quijote, Morisco Ricote sits at the foot of a beech and talks to his old friend Sancho Panza in pure Castilian: “I left our village, as I said, and went to France… I crossed into Italy, and reached Germany, and there it seemed to me we might live with more freedom, as the inhabitants do not pay any attention to trifling points…. I know well that Ricota my daughter and Francisca Ricota my wife are Catholic Christians, and though I am not so much so, still I am more of a Christian than a Moor…” This brief paragraph by Ricote in fact summarizes the displacement of more than 300,000 Moriscos, forcing them to seek temporary or permanent settlements in a wide geographical space that included Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, the interior of Anatolia, and the Middle East. The forced emigration of the Moriscos to the vast region in question created a social and religious identity crisis, particularly as they passed through Christian territories, mainly France and Italy. As they began to arrive in Christian lands, their presence sparked tension, curiosity, and religious conflict between two groups: on the one side Moriscos with their ambiguous identities as “Muslims”, “new Christians” or extraneus; and the local Christian population, who already saw these newcomers with suspicion, on the other side. From this point of view, this paper, based on Spanish, Italian, and French documents, seeks to provide insight onto the religious identity crisis Moriscos experienced when they encountered local Christian communities on their journey across France and Italy from 1600 to 1614. This study examines cross-cultural and religious interaction in the early modern Mediterranean space, focusing on the Moriscos’ understanding of their religious identity, as well as the local Christians’ perceptions of these newcomers whose identities shifted between Christianity and Islam.\n\nAneke Dornbusch (Rheinische Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität Bonn): “wolle uns hiemit iren rat und gutbedunken wissen machen” – The Persecution of Anabaptists as a “Shared Concern” of South German Imperial Cities\n\nAs the Anabaptist movement gained ground in South Germany from 1525 onwards, the imperial cities in this area faced the crucial question on how to react to this phenomenon which threatened the cooperation between city dwellers and local authorities. For many centuries, the portrayal of the persecution of Anabaptists has been shaped by biased and tendentious research. The field was also mostly determined by local, and therefore very limited studies, failing to recognize that Anabaptism – and its persecution – was not a local, but very much a transregional occurrence. This paper aims to provide a more differentiated look into the early years of Anabaptist persecution by analysing letters between imperial cities on this subject. These letters, largely overlooked until now and often difficult to access, reveal how Anabaptism was perceived by city authorities and which measures the cities employed to handle this threat. The letters also show that the strategy against Anabaptism was developed as a “group effort” of the cities and that inter-city cooperation was a key aspect of their tactics. Cities shared lists of suspected deviants, issued warnings to one another or simply sought advice on how to proceed. In cooperating in such ways, they fostered a sense of shared identity, in a time when the cities began to understand themselves as Protestant religious authorities. This paper intends to offer some preliminary insights into structural and content-related aspects of the persecution of Anabaptists as an inter-city phenomenon. It will combine features of historical network analysis and a close reading of the concerning early modern High German letters.\n\nRasmus H.C. Dreyer (University of Copenhagen): Early Modern Danish Hospital Institutions. Cross-confessional Inspirations\n\nTraditional national historiography of the Danish Reformation marks its beginning in 1536, but recent research suggests that its roots go back to the early 1520s. Urban centres such as Husum in Schleswig, and cities in Denmark proper as Viborg, Copenhagen and Malmö were hotbeds of reformatory activity during this period, influenced not only by Lutheranism but also by the theology and practice of Zwinglianism. Bernd Moeller’s seminal work, Reichstädte und Reformation (1962), highlighted the urban dimension of the Reformation, particularly its association with Zwinglianism and the transformative role of city magistrates. Despite some scholarly efforts to integrate this perspective, the traditional narrative of the Danish Reformation remains largely unchanged. This paper proposes to explore the urban dimension of the Danish Reformation, focusing on institutional reform and the emergence of social welfare practices and institutions in early modern Denmark and the Duchy of Schleswig. An often-overlooked aspect of the Reformation in these urban centres is the reuse of monastic institutions by city councils. Former monasteries were transformed into ecclesiastical welfare institutions, often called hospitals, to care for the sick, elderly, and infirm. In addition, some monasteries were converted into Latin schools (gymnasia) or municipal offices. The influence of these reforms extended beyond national borders, with inspiration coming from across the Baltic region and various local and regional reform movements, whether Lutheran or Zwinglian. While sources on the political and social history of Danish and Schleswegian cities during the Reformation are limited, this paper seeks to identify common trends and unique developments in institutional reform and social welfare practices. By examining the development of hospital foundations in the sixteenth century this study aims to trace their impact on the subsequent development of Danish municipal welfare and care institutions.\n\nPaweł Dziwiński (Jagiellonian University of Kraków): Paulus Vladimiri and John of Falkenberg at the Council of Constance, 1415–1417: The Debate that Failed to Shape Modern Natural Law\n\nDuring the Council of Constance (1414–1418), the Polish-Lithuanian union and the Teutonic Order aimed to combine their territorial disputes over the borders of Semigalia and the Vistula mouth with the main topic of synodal discussion, which was ecclesiastical reform in capite et in membris. To achieve this, Cracovian scholar Paulus Vladimiri drafted and circulated two treatises among the Council’s participants. In his treatises Tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium and Opinio Ostiensis, the author did not directly defend the Polish-Lithuanian claims. Instead, he questioned the existing perception of international law regarding the sovereignty of states, the rights of non-believers, and the theological justification of conversion by force. This challenges the foundations of the Order’s functioning in Prussia. According to some scholars, both texts are the first synthetic interpretation of public international law. This interpretation inspired the Salamanca school of natural rights, especially Vitoria’s De iure belli and De Indis. However, Vladimiri’s claims on the papacy and the Church’s authority over infidels were met with opposition from John of Falkenberg, who informally defended the Order’s position. In his Liber de doctrina, he strongly opposed Vladimiri’s theses and argued that the international community had the right to deprive sovereignty and even liquidate a nation that acts against the Christianitas. This paper aims to provide a fresh perspective on the scientific impact of both authors regarding the formation of natural law. It will examine their methodology, internal structure, and ideas in terms of the changes popularized by the Renaissance discourse. The first section will evaluate their reasoning by focusing on the sources that inspired them. The following section will briefly summarise the main differences between the Vladimiri-Falkenberg debate and those found in Vitoria’s works.\n\nWilliam Engel (Sewanee, The University of the South): ‘The Wandering Jew’ in the Reformation Allegorical Imagination\n\nThis paper revisits the perennial specter which received renewed life during the Reformation: Judeophobia. By examining some key stages in an ever-abiding, composite trope in pan-European cultural consciousness, the figure of the “Wandering Jew,” we begin to understand the extent to which “the Jew” was associated with being the migratory figure par excellence. Jews of the Middle Ages and later during the century of Reformation were subjected to a variety of – and often quite arbitrary – laws, differing region to region, prince to prince, and bishop to bishop, depending on any of innumerable factors, though usually financially motivated and bolstered by blatant racism and anti-Semitism. This is made quite clear by Martin Luther, in his 1543 On the Jews and their Lies: “We let them get rich on our sweat and blood, while we remain poor and they suck the marrow from our bones.” Although Judeophobia is pan-European in its sweep and scope, there are decisive Germanic roots to be found in late medieval legislation about sumptuary regulations for Jews, for example, in Worms and in Würzburg (among other jurisdictions), perpetuated further by Luther’s appeal addressed to the princes of Mitteleuropa: “I wish and I ask that our rulers who have Jewish subjects exercise a sharp mercy toward these wretched people.” My paper will conclude with Thomas Browne’s conciliatory English, post-Reformation, “new science” approach to investigating specific allegations about “the Jews” so as to break the cycle of perpetuating “vulgar errors” that had bolstered the Jewish imaginary in pre-Enlightenment Europe.\n\nHanna Filipova (University of Gothenburg): Banquet of Chestnuts, Hats Nailed to Heads and Sodomy: Image Transformation of Religious Othering in Renaissance and Early Modern Europe\n\nIn 1501 Johann Burchard, Master of Ceremonies of the Papal Court, recorded in his famous diary how, at a banquet hosted by Pope Alexander VI, guests were amused by watching naked courtesans crawl along the floor, picking chestnuts. In 1571, the Livonians Taube and Kruse, who were in the service of the Russian Tsar Ivan IV, described a similar scene, arranged by the Tsar, only the women were catching chickens. In 1555, Magnus of Denmark mentioned another “joke” by the Tsar: he ordered a hat to be nailed to the head of the Italian ambassador. The no less legendarily cruel Vlad the Impaler allegedly did the same thing, only in relation to the Turkish ambassadors. This story is recorded in the Tale of Dracula (1490s), which was popular in Muscovy. In 1453, after the fall of Constantinople, European chronicles described Turks led by Sultan Mehmed II raping Christian boys and young men; in 1704, German pamphleteer Martin Neugebauer attributed similar behavior to couriers of the Russian Tsar Peter I, summing up the stereotype of the “sodomitical Muscovite”. What could unite the Wallachian ruler, the Ottoman Sultan, the Pope and the Moscow Tsar? All became targets of propaganda attacks based on religious and political confrontations in fifteenth- to eighteenth-century Europe. Accusations of “unnatural” behavior, contrary to the Divine order of the universe, were among the most popular and many-sided weapons in the ideological struggle. Thus, the “Borgia black legend”, in the wake of the Reformation, echoes in Swedish Protestant propaganda against the Russians during the Great Northern War 1700–1721, although there seem to be no direct connections between them. In this report, I trace the paths of wandering plots, that became, at different times and in different contexts, the embodiment of othering, largely based on religious identity. My research question is why these stories arose in one form or another and were adopted, what stereotypes they were based on and what ones they created.\n\nAntonio Gerace (Università degli Studi di Bologna | KU Leuven): Sovereign Ordination: Biblical Exegesis of Romans 13 in Renaissance Rome Political Theology\n\nThe project “The Renaissance Papacy’s Political Theology and Its Projects of Religious Reform (PRIN 2022 – 2022BXT33X)” takes the pre-Tridentine Church as an institution promoting an ambivalent and complex project of religious reform, where the ideal of the affirmation of a new political power, nourished by classical and Roman cultural models, coexists – in dialectic tension – with the attempt to absorb and channel claims for the spiritual renewal of the Church, based on Biblical motifs. The crux of Renaissance Rome’s political theology lies not solely within the institutional dominion of the Papacy but also within the interpretation of the Bible as it pertains to governance. In particular, the exegesis of Romans 13, a keystone New Testament passage concerning the Christian’s relationship to authority, was employed and interpreted to cement the religio-political nexus that defined the era. In examining the exegetical tradition of Romans 13 during the Renaissance – by focusing in particular on Iacopo Sadoleto, Tommaso de Vio Cajetan and Ambrogio Catarino Politi – we probe into the interpretive techniques used by theologians of the time to propagate a vision of divine sovereignty that inherently justifies the political structure of the Papal States. The purpose of this analysis is twofold: firstly, to discern the hermeneutical nuances that shaped the comprehension of Papal and princely authority as God’s earthly representatives; secondly, to evaluate how such theological interpretations impacted the public’s perception of authority. By threading the historical with the textual, this presentation aims to shed light on how biblical interpretation functioned as both a mirror and a motor for political thought and action in Renaissance Rome. It argues for a sophisticated theological-political landscape, where biblical exegesis played a pivotal role in both reflecting and shaping the socio-political realities of the time.\n\nPhillip Haberkern (Boston University): Conceptualizing a Trans-confessional Religious Community: The “Bohemian Church” Across Two Centuries\n\nFrom the middle of the fifteenth century until the outbreak of the Thirty Years’ War, the Czech lands harboured a pluralistic religious landscape. Certainly, the distinctive religious groups in this polity (i.e. Utraquists, Catholics, Unity of Brethren, Lutherans, and Anabaptists) came into conflict during these centuries, but the region was characterized by a stable, if uneasy, regime of de facto toleration during this period. This paper will therefore examine how the leaders of different churches articulated a shared religious identity at crucial moments in the history of the Bohemian reformation in order to justify their existence independent of Rome. That identity drew on the Augustinian conception of the “true church” as refracted through the writings of the martyr Jan Hus (d. 1415), and the leaders of the non-Catholic factions in the Czech lands emphasized the existence of a confessionally-ambiguous ecclesia Bohemica to advocate for their political rights throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Focusing specifically on the negotiations around the composition of the Bohemian Confession in 1575 and the efforts of Jan Amos Comenius to garner support for Czech exiles during the Thirty Years’ War, this paper will argue that the invocation of the “Bohemian Church” was intended to minimize confessional differences and emphasize the shared history of the evangelical Czech churches. By affirming the shared genealogy of these different religious groups, the deliberately amorphous conception of the Bohemian church allowed their leaders to act together and put aside potentially contentious issues like sacramental theology and collectively demand royal recognition of their right to continued existence.\n\nJoachim Haddad (Aix-Marseille Université): Peregrinatio and Spiritual Pilgrimage in Augustine’s Late Works\n\nIn his 1543 Traité des reliques Calvin offered a radical critique of the cult of relics, which led him to question the practice of pilgrimage. This mistrust of pilgrimage is not new in theology, and we would like to examine this notion in the work of Augustine, since he had a great influence on Calvin. While the notion of peregrinatio is fundamental to describing the development of the city of God on earth, the notion of pilgrimage is absent from Augustine’s work. We would like to take a closer look at this paradox, which B. Bitton-Ashkelany has already highlighted in her important 2005 book Encountering the Sacred. In this work, she sees peregrinatio as a spiritual pilgrimage. This idea is defended with convincing arguments, but in our view needs to be nuanced, insofar as it cannot be understood in the same way depending on whether we are dealing with the writings of the young Augustine or Augustine’s later writings, marked by the Pelagian controversy. First of all, we would like to show that Augustine’s lack of emphasis on the idea of an earthly pilgrimage is explained by his eschatological conception of the city of God as a heavenly city. We will then analyse the idea of a peregrinatio understood as a spiritual pilgrimage to show that it reveals a tension in Augustine’s work: if a pilgrimage is understood as progress towards a goal, then the peregrinatio must be understood as progress for the individual and for humanity in this earthly existence. However, by placing great emphasis on the notion of grace, the Pelagian controversy calls this idea into question. So how should we understand this spiritual pilgrimage? We would like to show that it can only be understood in the context of a global history, which is no longer that of a single man, but of humanity as a whole. From this spiritual pilgrimage, we can then better understand Augustine’s, and therefore Calvin’s, rejection of earthly pilgrimage.\n\nIsabel Harvey ((Université du Québec à Montréal | Université Catholique de Louvain): Mountains, Forests, and a Lot of Rain: The Impacts of Natural Environment on the Domestic Missions of Calabria during the Seventeenth Century\n\nThe 1636 New France Jesuit relations explained how the harsh natural environment of the New World influenced their travels to reach the Huron communities. “The travelers’ food is a little Indian or Turkish corn, crushed between two stones and cooked in simple water. There is no salt, vinegar or anything else mixed in. We sleep either on the ground or on the awful rocks that line this great river, and always under the sign of the moon.” In New France, nature – unfamiliar and unruly – was everywhere, forcing the Jesuits to adapt and review their itineraries and, more broadly, their evangelization program. While environmental challenges were obvious in these remote regions, nature is much less present in the writings of the missionaries who remained in Europe and worked on the domestic missions aimed at strengthening the Catholic faith and establishing its practices among populations already part of the Roman Church. However, in Europe too, the environment was a protagonist of evangelization, especially in peripheral, rural or mountainous areas, where most of these missions took place. How did natural environments met during missions create constraints on missionaries’ everyday work, influence their views of the world and, ultimately, force them to adapt their goals and practices? Based on Jesuit case studies from Southern Italy, in perspective with the Jesuits sources from New France, this paper will problematize a new research path in environmental history from ecclesiastical sources. It will show, on the one hand, how the environmental history of missions is not just an additional aspect of history but a central one in the definition for Rome of what was possible or not to achieve in their search for a Universal Church. On the other hand, following the refusal of Simon Ditchfield in 2010 of the concept of “global Catholicism” for instead talking about a plurality of “Catholicisms”, it will show the role of natural environment in the construction of such localisms.\n\nAbigail Hayton (University of Oxford): Does Jewish Law Mandate Infant Baptism by Sprinkling? The Perspective of John Lightfoot (1602–75)\n\nThis paper assesses the development of John Lightfoot’s conception of infant baptism by sprinkling as an ancient Jewish practice through his participation in the debates of the Westminster Assembly, where his interventions meant that the resultant Directory of Public Worship did not allow for any other option to his hugely influential Horae Hebraicae (1658–1678), which defined the Reformed case for the traditional baptismal rite for over a century. It demonstrates the role played by Lightfoot’s familiarity with seemingly very obscure Jewish sources in his emergence as the most authoritative biblical commentator of his era. This is the story of how a seemingly marginal scholarly pursuit, post-biblical Jewish legal exegesis, could come to occupy a central role in the construction of Reformed doctrine, and, as such, forms part of an emerging case for the abandonment of the term “Christian Hebraism” in favour of a much broader recognition of the diversities of Jewish scholarly influences upon Early Modern Christianities.\n\nBernhard Holl (Archdiocese of Berlin): And the Land Rested for Forty Years: Spanish New Christians at the Beginning of the Fifteenth Century\n\nCompared to the massive social conflict that surrounded the Iberian “conversos” (newly baptized former Jews and their descendants) in the latter half of fifteenth century Castile and Aragon, the previous relatively peaceful period usually receives rather little attention. Most historians deem the widespread pogroms and massacres of 1391 a pivotal moment in time, ushering in the era of mass conversions with all its drastic consequences – including the establishment of the Spanish Inquisition and the expulsion of all Jews from the Iberian Peninsula. However, there are almost no explanations as to why the first documented hostilities between Old and New Christians can only be dated back to 1430s at the earliest. This paper proposes five different (but possibly related) hypotheses to account for this previously unexplained observation. Theoretical approaches refer to phenomena observed in sociology and cultural anthropology such as the integration paradox, collective memory and ambiguity tolerance. Historical evidence is drawn upon with particular attention to the Council of Basel’s decree on neophytes, the rise of converso officials under John II and his minister Álvaro de Luna and the opposing factions within the Spanish Old Christian community.\n\nAndrew Hope (Oxford University): Judaism, Islam, and the Work of William Tyndale\n\nWilliam Tyndale produced the first modern English translation of the New Testament, the first English translation from the Greek, and the first English printed translation. He also substantially contributed to the English Old Testament equivalents of each of these from the Hebrew, although his work was unfinished at the time of his martyrdom in 1536. Traditionally his work was valued principally as the basis of the King James Bible of 1611, for long the standard English translation. Over the last quarter century or so there has been increasing appreciation of his Greek scholarship and of Tyndale as a Renaissance figure. As yet almost no attention has been paid Tyndale’s Jewish links or the evidence of his Arabic scholarship. Tyndale’s closest associate in the production of the first printed English New Testament (1526), was William Roye, a Christian of Jewish descent. Roye’s outlook in his polemical work, particularly after his parting from Tyndale, shows the influence of his Jewish background. In 2002, Thomas E. Burman discovered a manuscript of the Qur’an with a Latin translation in Cambridge University Library. Watermark evidence suggests it may have originated in Palermo. At some later point it was owned by William Tyndale, and contains extensive marginalia in Tyndale’s hand, correcting or further explaining the Latin translation of the Arabic. Although the manuscript has attracted the attention of scholars of the Qur’an, there has been little attempt to use it as a source for Tyndale’s scholarship. It was once argued that Tyndale did little more than translate Luther’s German into English. On the contrary, it can now be argued that, despite his lonely exile, he was one of the most accomplished English humanist scholars of his generation,\n\nEmilia Hruszowiec (Historical Institute/University of Wrocław): Polish Anti-Jewish Literature in the Attempt to Shape Christian-Jewish Relations (Sixteenth-Seventeenth Centuries)\n\nThe Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth was not a socially homogeneous state. Its territories were inhabited by the representatives of various faiths and nationalities, but it was the Jews who were particularly seen as others and strangers. Early modern anti-Jewish literature especially contributed to this. The situation was facilitated by the fact that the representatives of the Jewish faith never fully assimilated into the society, although they had been present in the Polish lands since the Middle Ages. They were simply different, and authors emphasised this otherness by trying to push it beyond the limits of acceptability in order to achieve intended goals. Hence the negative perception of otherness enabling the authors to affect people’s imagination and change their attitudes towards Jews. Anyone may feel fear and might do everything to avoid danger and to survive, and redirecting social tensions to the Jews could have helped mitigate those directed, inter alia, towards the Church or the State. Religious and social issues in particular contributed to this. The discussed subject was also an important part of the Church’s polemic stance against the Jews, which was based on manifold reasons. The situation became more specific as the authors often transformed and reshaped the reality of the time. They, for example, took advantage of unfavorable circumstances and social tensions such as wars, natural disasters or epidemics. For instance, the legend of ritual murders, alleged profanations and other stereotypes concerning Jewish people took on a slightly different meaning. Portraying the Jews as murderers, enemies of Christianity or representatives of the devil had a certain reason – that which meant to evoke fear or even anxiety. Owing to that, popular imagination could be more easily and effectively affected, and thus manipulated, which helped to shape social attitudes towards Jews at the time and in the centuries to come.\n\nAnis Issa (École Pratique des Hautes Études): The Catholics under the Feather of the Coptic Historians, Efforts for Unity or a Conspiracy of Subjugation?\n\nThe ecumenical relations between the Coptic Orthodox Church and the Roman Catholic Church continue to be friendly on the leaders’ level. However, no tangible achievements when it comes to Christian unity, were ever achieved. This could be interpreted in the light of a long tradition of Coptic skepticism towards the Roman Church. The paper will try to shed light on the Coptic perception of Catholic rapprochement attempts during the early modern period. To this aim, we will present an analytical reading for the nine-volume book History of the Coptic Church by Iris Habib Elmasry where we will only focus on the segments related to the Catholic Church and its envoys to the Copts. Given how widespread and respected it was in the Coptic milieus, Elmasry’s work represents an important source to understand the roots of Coptic perception of Western Christendom.\n\nGábor Ittzés (Debrecen Reformed Theological University): A Tenacious Myth of Authenticity: The Reception History of the Dream of Frederick the Wise\n\nSomnium Friderici is an apocryphal early modern text that burst onto the scene at the first Reformation centenary in 1617. It took the stage by storm, and wrote itself indelibly into the memory of the beginnings of the renewal movement for about three and a half centuries. It was not until the late 1960s that modern scholarship conclusively challenged its ostensible provenience and relocated its birth to the context of early Lutheran orthodoxy in the latter half of the sixteenth century. This paper will review Somnium Friderici’s remarkable reception history. After summarising the work’s contents, structure, and sophisticated strategies of self-legitimisation, it will briefly present its early publication history. The first broadsheets are famous for their quality of text and image. The latter, widely regarded as the first pictorial representation of the “nailing” of the Ninety-Five Theses, had its own effective history, which cannot be pursued here. Instead, the paper will follow the afterlife of the text, tracing the dissemination and reception of Somnium Friderici. Beyond sketching the overall story from the early seventeenth to the twenty-first century, this paper will discuss the text’s gradual assimilation into historical works on the Reformation and will focus especially on two episodes that poignantly illustrate the tenacity of the myth of this work’s authenticity. The first was a notable scholarly debate around the turn of the eigtheenth century which falsely confirmed the historicity of the work in the face of some reasonable challenges that still seem valid today, while renewed attention around the tricentennial of the Reformation ultimately gave it a new lease on life for another 150 years. The paper will conclude by offering some contemporary signs of doubt about the critical deconstruction of the claim of authenticity, illustrating the myth’s refusal to fully dissolve under the weight of scholarly evidence to the contrary.

Martin emphasizes the ethical aspect of the Erasmian concept of philosophia Christi. This philosophy, Martin states, is a religious ethic embodied in Christ that is set before human beings as the measure and ultimate target. Obviously, Martin is not the first among scholars to stress the exemplary character of Christ and the restraint of metaphysical speculations in Erasmus, since these notions are crucial to understanding his theology. However, even though morality and the notion of a virtuous and spiritual life play a significant role in Erasmian theology, this paper will argue that one ought to be cautious in rendering the Christology of Erasmus in mere moral tenets. This paper will investigate Erasmus’ De libero arbitrio (1524) to present an additional interpretation of his Christology in relation to his hermeneutics, his academic scepticism, and his anthropology. In this regard, it is essential to pay attention to how Erasmus – against the backdrop of his scriptural interpretation – formulated thoughts on human capabilities, original sin, and spirit that do not necessarily reflect the ‘optimistic’ anthropology and the unambiguous morality implied in other works of his as well as in scholarly contributions on Erasmian theology. Erasmus did indeed accentuate the human moral endeavor, but he also stressed that no human being could make any claims for their own powers – evidently, though sometimes overlooked in the debate with Martin Luther. Therefore, this paper seeks to look behind the veil of ethical prescriptions for a virtuous Christian life and to reconsider the rich complexity and demanding ambiguity of the theology of Erasmus in order to gain a deeper understanding of his authorship, both in his own right and in relation to the Lutheran Reformation.\n\nGrigori Khislavski (Erfurt University): “Judenherz” and “Judengehirn”. Anti-Semitic Vocabulary of the Early New High German Period\n\nIf one were to lexicographically determine how the lexeme Jude (and its collocations) was already semanticized in Early Modern High German texts (1450–c.1750) and subsequently in New High German texts (1750–1945), one would find that this lexeme appears, for example in compounds with the determiner Jude (lexicographic evidence 1450–c.1750) such as Judenarzt, Judenarznei, Judenbad, Judenbegierde, Judenblut, Judenbube, Judenbüchlein, Judendienst, Judeneid, Judenfeind, Judenfreund, Judengasse, Judengesicht, Judenherz, Judengehirn, Judengeißel, Judengekröt, Judengeld, Judengenosse, Judengeschenk, Judengeschlecht, Judengeschmeiß, Judengeselle, Judengönner, Judenhand, Judenhaus, Judenheucheln, Judenkind, Judenklage, Judenknecht, Judenkopf, Judenkur, Judenlatein, Judenliebhaber, Judenpatient, Judenpatron, Judenrotte, Judensache, Judenschatz, Judenschmalz, Judensau, Judenschulden, Judenschule, Judenschutz, Judenschutzbüchlein, Judenschützer, Judenschwarm, Judenspiegel, Judenspieß, Judenstadt, Judenturm, Judenvater, Judenverteidiger, Judenvolk, Judenwucher, Judenzettel, Judenzucht, Judenzwang. It is clear that Martin Luther’s body of work strongly influenced the general parlance of other German authors of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. This holds especially true for his 1543 work Von den Juͤden und jren Luͤgen. The lexemes “Judenherz” and “Judengehirn” suggest a linguistic stigmatization that far exceeds the usual scope of the Christian Adversus-Judaeos literature. With regards to language and cultural history, it seems therefore pertinent to ask about the significance of Luther’s anti-Semitic vocabulary for the literary construction of the collective Jew in the early New High German period.\n\nJonas Kjøller-Rasmussen (University of Copenhagen): Psychagogics and Meditation: Quantitative and Qualitative Approaches to Sabbati Sanctificatio (1635–38)\n\nThe concept of ‘meditation’ in early modern devotional literature is not easy to get a hold of, since it is often used in various contexts to denote either specific literary genres, structured devotional practices, or mystical piety. In the scholarship on one of the most influential seventeenth century devotional writings in Denmark, Sabbati Sanctificatio (1633) by the professor of theology and bishop of Zealand Jesper Rasmussen Brochmand (1585–1652), neither concept of ‘meditation’ has so far been considered applicable. However, recently Günter Butzer has suggested considering looking at early modern meditation as a subset of a broader, longer tradition of psychagogics, which has roots in classical literature (in particular Seneca). Psychagogics is a praxis of self-formation that works with the disciplines of ethics, rhetoric, and medicine to shape virtues and affects. This paper will first introduce Butzer’s concept of psychagogics as an analytical tool for working with early modern devotional literature and then demonstrate the benefits of applying it to an analysis of Brochmand’s Sabbati Sanctificatio. Analysis will include the use of visual and affective elements, but will focus on the dialogical aspects of Sabbati Sanctificatio, which emerge through a strategic use of perspective changes in the text, whereby the reader is drawn in to engage dialogically with scripture as a devotional praxis.\n\nBrandt Klawitter (NLA University College, Bergen, Norway): In or Out? Ulpian’s Understanding of Natural Law and the Wittenberg Reformers\n\nBy the 1520s, Wittenberg figures such as Philipp Melanchthon and then also Martin Luther had turned away from a more traditional definition of natural law based upon Domitius Ulpian’s quod natura omnia animalia docuit. The justification for such a turn was based on the fact that “nature” (that which was held in common with the animals) was not properly the realm of reason. Given that the animals were unreasonable, their urges and instincts could not properly be considered under the term “law”. As a result, the Wittenberg reformers shied away from Ulpian’s definition of natural law, though they nevertheless maintained what was an unmistakably elevated understanding of nature’s normativity under differing terminology. Despite this being the case, it is notable that Melanchthon – who had led the turn away from the traditional definition of natural law already in his Loci Communes of 1521 – takes up a more Ulpianic understanding of natural law in his 1531 Apology to the Augsburg Confession (Ap. 23), thus demonstrating that Ulpian had not entirely fallen out of Melanchthon’s purview – not even under the term “natural law”. In this paper I propose to explore these events, their implications for reformation theology, and then also seek to formulate a thesis for why Melanchthon made use of an otherwise generally discarded conception of natural law.\n\nSkirmantas Knieža (Vilnius University): The Purger or The Reconciler: The Mission of the Nobleman in Sixteenth-Century Jesuit Literature of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania\n\nThe ethnically diverse polity of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania in the sixteenth century faced internal tensions fueled by the clash of Protestantism and Catholic Reformation, not to mention the external threats posed by the Duchy of Moscow and the Ottoman Empire. The establishment of the Society of Jesus and, subsequently, their academy in Vilnius, fuelled the intellectual debate, with university students reflecting the tension with the Other and the noblemen’s role in establishing order and peace. This paper will focus on the late sixteenth-century Jesuit occasional poetry of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, dedicated to monarchs, bishops, and noblemen, analyzing how their missions were reflected and understood amid the political and religious tensions.\n\nJakub Koryl (Jagiellonian University): Muslim-Dressed Greek Philosopher among His Fellow Christians: Cultural Hybrids, Polyphonies and Luther’s Part in the Aristotelian Tradition\n\nThis paper focuses on the transcultural development of Luther’s research area, that is, in the ways in which the image of Aristotle was multiplied and pluralized in the post-antique tradition, as well as in the reconstruction of the image of Aristotle as a Muslim-Christian hybrid rather than a Greek philosopher that was vivid in the Lutheran collective consciousness and popular culture. Despite its detailed and professional approach during the Heidelberg Disputation of 1518, Luther’s philological and philosophical investigation into various “Aristoteles” – the Greek one and his different Latin variants – was not merely an armchair exercise or endeavor left hanging in the air and thus devoid of any cultural significance and resonance. Hand in hand with Luther’s academic undertakings, popular ideas about the unprecedented meaning and content of his dispute with Latin Aristotelianism were entering the collective consciousness of German Lutheranism. Revealed by Luther in Heidelberg, and then visualized in pamphlets and visual propaganda between 1519 and 1523, the hybrid image of Latin Aristotle not only did not fall within the intellectual and confessional divisions within the Christian commonwealth, but also was already extending beyond European borders. Drawing on the example of Aristotle’s hybrid images, I will be interested to examine the manners the early-modern image of a stranger was conceptualized, stigmatized and pluralized. So far, this non-academic, popular framework of early modern Aristotelianism has not received any attention.\n\nChrysovalantis Kyriacou (Theological School of the Church of Cyprus): Hilarion Kigalas (Cigala) and the Fortunes of Eastern Orthodoxy in Ottoman Cyprus between Calvinism and Roman Catholicism\n\nThis paper explores the life and times of Hilarion Kigalas (1624–1682), an Orthodox-born Cypriot of probably Genoese descent and one of the most fascinating figures in the history of seventeenth-century Cyprus. An alumnus of the Greek College of Saint Athanasius at Rome, Kigalas served as director of the Cottunian College at Padua before travelling in the Ottoman Empire as a Catholic missionary and teacher. Following his public return to Orthodoxy, Kigalas received the office of the “great theologian” of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. In 1668 he was the mind behind the condemnation of Calvinism during the Synod of Nicosia, under Archbishop Nikephoros (1641– 674), who was pro-Catholic for political reasons. Kigalas also collaborated with Nektarios, the former patriarch of Jerusalem, to refute the arguments of Franciscan missionaries in the Holy Land. The increasing need to defend Eastern Orthodoxy against Catholic penetration in the East offered Kigalas the opportunity to forge his public image as a representative of the “authentic” tradition of the Orthodox Church, against Nikephoros, whom he replaced as archbishop of Cyprus between 1674 and 1678. During Kigalas’ tenure, Nikephoros maintained his claims over the throne, in a power game involving the Ottomans, the Catholic consuls and merchants of Cyprus, and various groups within the Orthodox hierarchy. Although Kigalas was himself deposed in 1678 and died four years later in Constantinople while trying to regain his office, his tenure marked the fortunes of Eastern Orthodoxy on the island for centuries to come. By dynamically associating the invented tradition of the Orthodox archbishop’s “imperial privileges” with Byzantium and Orthodoxy, Kigalas promoted the veneration of Saint Barnabas, apostolic founder of the Cypriot Church, as a symbol of spiritual regeneration. Last but not least, Kigalas’ rhetoric of power visualised the increased responsibilities of the archbishop in Ottoman administration.\n\nAlysée Le Druillenec (Université Paris 1 Panthéon-Sorbonne): For a Comparative Environmental Theology of New-France Wendats and French Missionaries\n\nThis paper focuses on the landscape in the painting La France apportant la foi aux Wendat de la Nouvelle France (1666) and its uncanny resemblance with the iconographic tradition of St Christopher. In the center of the composition, the sea looks like the tormented river he had to cross to get Christ through. On both sides, the shores are rocky, and the composition, together with the houses and trees in the background and foreground, pushes them up the sides of the picture to the middle. This type of composition is well known for St Christopher’s iconography, especially because his hagiography tells the story of a baptism. Moreover, what makes this painting a unicum, is that St Joseph, Canada’s future patron saint, appears twice alongside Christ in an unusual way: on one hand, in a mise en abîme image, and on the other hand, in the heavens, at the same level as Mary. In 1666, his cult was still developing in France where he was promoted as the best intercessor at the time of death because of the grace he received from God to carry the Christ. Through a multidisciplinary approach using comparative theology, missiology, religious art history, and religious history, this paper aims to show how the Counter-Reformation Josephology and the survival of St Christopher’s iconographic tradition resonates with the Wendats’ theology. It aims to show how the carrying of the Christ, which was attributed to saint Christopher in arts, is re-actualized into saint Joseph’s posture as the custos prudens of the Holy Family and what is at stake when put into the context of the Wendats evangelization.\n\nTapio Leinonen (University of Helsinki): Encounters and Experiences Behind Martin Luther’s Political Theology\n\nThis paper analyzes a shift in Martin Luther’s theological teaching by comparing two scarcely researched theological sources: Luther’s Lectures on Deuteronomy (1525) and Sermons on Deuteronomy (1529). The paper presents examples of Luther’s teaching in the sources and examines the encounters and experiences Luther and his contemporaries had that influenced his theological teaching. The paper argues that Luther’s teaching on Deuteronomy is founded on the theological foundation of faith-based love. Through faith established in the heart, human beings can follow the law by conducting works of love. The two sources reveal a shift in Luther’s application of his theology in different contexts. While the foundation remains the same for Luther, he argues for different kinds of actions for princes and their subjects in different times. The paper analyzes how Luther’s encounters in early modern society with the leadership of the Teutonic Order which shortly after converted to the Lutheran faith in 1525, and Zwingli’s supporters at the Marburg Colloquy in 1529, directed Luther’s words on how a Christian ruler or commoner should relate to their neighbor of different faith, nationality, or opinion. During a short period of time, the historical and political context had major shifts due to the political threat posed by the Turks, the Peasants’ War, and the arguments between different Reformation confessions. This paper presents changes in Luther’s biblical and political teaching related to the lived experiences in the 1520s. The research proposes that Luther stays true to his teaching on faith as a foundation for love and good works in societal and ecclesial realms. However, the context affects Luther’s teaching on how love is expressed to ensure the stability of faith in a changing political context with uprising threats.\n\nUrs Leu (Institut für Schweizerische Reformationsgeschichte, Universität Zürich): Presentation of the Forthcoming Collection of Sources on the History of Anabaptism in Zurich (1534–1636)\n\nOn 21 January 1525, the first adult baptism was performed in Zurich, according to the chronicles of the Hutterite Brethren. This event is not only regarded as the birth of the free churches in Switzerland, but also marks the beginning of the movements that we now call the Amish and Mennonite churches. Until now, the Zurich Anabaptist sources were only available up to 1533 in a critical edition, but this is now set to change. In the early summer of 2025, two further extensive volumes will be available containing the Zurich Anabaptist sources from the years 1534 to 1636. They will not only cover the periods of the famous antistes Heinrich Bullinger, Rudolf Gwalther and, in part, Johann Jakob Breitinger, but will also provide far-reaching insights into persecution, congregational life, dissemination and the structure of the Anabaptist communities. These turbulent times also saw the last execution of a Zurich Anabaptist in 1614 (Hans Landis) and the beginning of the systematic destruction of Anabaptist life in the canton of Zurich (1635/36). The largely unknown source material sheds new light on Anabaptism in Zurich in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\n\nJohannes Ljungberg (University of Copenhagen): Generational Dissent in the Lutheran North? Early Adopters of New Platforms in Shifting Media Ecologies, 1700–1774\n\nThis paper investigates how religiously dissenting people navigated three shifting media ecologies in the Lutheran North between 1700 and 1774. By examining the dissenters’ use of expanding epistolary networks around 1700, clandestine manuscript collections in the 1730s, and the world-unique, far-reaching freedom of print in Sweden 1766–1774 and in Denmark 1770–1772, it discusses different ways to examine what we might call “generational dissent”. This paper fleshes out three empirical examples which indicate generational patterns and discusses how these connects to a variety of theoretical definitions of generation: as indirect belonging to age cohorts by year of birth, as connection to certain cohorts by socialization, and as self-aware articulation of connections and contentions between old, young, past, present and future generations. It discusses the usefulness of the concepts of ‘early adopters’ and ‘natives’ of media ecologies, in conversation with how Thomas Kaufmann has introduced the term ‘print natives’ into Reformation studies in his book Die Druckmacher. Wie die Generation Luther die erste Medienrevolution entfesselte (Munich, 2022). Thereby, the paper aims to nurture a continuing discussion on the intersection of shifting media ecologies, religious dissent and generational patterns. It does so with a point of departure in examples from the Nordic Countries, generating a more general question to the conference concerning potential comparisons with other geographical areas and chronological frameworks within the studies on early modern Christianity from 1500 onwards.\n\nDiego Lucci (American University in Bulgaria): Transubstantiation, the Trinity, and the Rule of Faith in England under James II\n\nIn 1686-87, during the Anglican controversy with Catholicism, some English Catholic polemicists and Church of England clergymen focused on transubstantiation and the Trinity in debating the rule of faith. Drawing on anti-Trinitarian arguments on the impossibility of deducing the Trinitarian dogma from Scripture alone, anonymous Catholic writers maintained that the Protestant doctrine of sola Scriptura led to the denial of not only transubstantiation but also the Trinity. Accordingly, they insisted on grounding biblical exegesis in ecclesiastical tradition. Anglican theologians such as Richard Kidder, William Sherlock, Edward Stillingfleet, and Thomas Tenison replied that the Trinity was a “truth above reason” revealed in Scripture. However, this solution, implying that the Trinity was not plainly comprehensible to reason, led to further doubt about the role of rational inquiry in biblical hermeneutics, the perspicuitas of Scripture, and the doctrinal authority of ecclesiastical institutions. Catholics indeed denounced the fallibility of individual interpretation of Scripture, while Protestants argued that Church Councils were not exempt from mistakes. The Unitarian leader Stephen Nye joined that controversy with A Brief History of the Unitarians, Called also Socinians (1687) and was soon followed by other anti-Trinitarians. While sticking to sola Scriptura and rejecting ecclesiastical tradition, Unitarian authors exposed the aforesaid fallacies of the claim that the Trinity was above reason, thereby questioning the scriptural foundations of the Trinitarian doctrine and eliciting different responses from Trinitarian apologists. Consequently, that inter-confessional debate about the rule of faith provoked the Trinitarian crisis that shook the English theological arena in the late seventeenth century.\n\nTomasz Mantyk (KU Leuven | Catholic University of Lublin): Theology of the Eucharist in Erasmus’ and Titelmans’ Paraphrase on John 6\n\nAfter publishing his epoch-making Novum Instrumentum in 1516, Erasmus (re)invented a genre of biblical paraphrase. The humanist strove to render the biblical message in a clear and elegant manner. The work of paraphrasing was inevitably also an interpretation, which alerted some conservative theologians such as Noël Beda. The syndic of the Parisian theological faculty considered paraphrases as per se false interpretations. Surprisingly, Beda’s protegee, Francis Titelmans, a young Franciscan scholar from Leuven, started composing his own paraphrases of biblical books in a poorly disguised competition with Erasmus. The aim of the presentation is to confront biblical paraphrases of both authors and establish the degree of Titelmans’ dependence on the older author and theological differences between them. The case study is John 6, one of the key texts for the doctrine of the Eucharist, especially the concept of “the real presence”. The paper will demonstrate how Titelmans sought to “catholicise” Erasmus, filling a progressive form (paraphrase) with a conservative message.\n\nRobert Aleksander Maryks (Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, Poland): From the IJssel Valley to the Vistula Valley: Jesuits and Devotio Moderna in the Commonwealth of Poland–Lithuania\n\nJesuits played a pivotal role in the early modern era in Poland-Lithuania, countering the Protestant Reformation’s progress through theological debates and printing. They also promoted forms of devotion rooted in the tradition of devotio moderna, a movement predating Protestantism, that advocated spiritual exercises, self-discipline, and introspection. This movement, championed by the Brethren of the Common Life and the Augustinian Canons Regular, spread to German-speaking regions, northern France, and Catalonia. In Montserrat, Abbot García Jiménez de Cisneros incorporated devotio moderna texts into Benedictine reform, compiling a book of spiritual exercises. These practices became fundamental to the spiritual journey of Ignatius of Loyola, the future co-founder of the Jesuits. The devotio moderna had marked its influence in Paris, and notably, Jan Standonck, founder of the Collège de Montaigu, had ties with the movement. Ignatius of Loyola studied there, absorbing the devotio moderna authors’ works, which informed his Spiritual Exercises and led to the formation of his group. Once the group became an official religious order in 1540, the Spiritual Exercises became the Jesuit spirituality and ministry’s cornerstone. Loyola was especially attached to à Kempis’s Imitation of Christ, a devotio moderna text, which later became central to Jesuit literature and was translated into multiple languages, including Polish. Once the Jesuits arrived in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1564, they published translations of à Kempis’s Imitation, which remained popular well into the nineteenth century. Its popularity was not limited to the Jesuits; Protestants and other Catholics also published its editions in Latin and Polish. This paper attempts to trace the circulation of devotio moderna texts in the Commonwealth which played a pivotal role in the early modern era focusing on the Imitatio Christi, highlighting the Jesuits’ role in integrating the devotio moderna into the new religious culture of Poland-Lithuania.\n\nYelena Matusevich (University of Alaska Fairbanks): Amicitia in morte: Continuity and Discontinuity in Early Modern Death Preparation Texts\n\nOutside medical professionals the word “palliative” became current only about twenty years ago, when it was introduced as a euphemism in order to replace a centuries-old concept of death preparation or ars moriendi. The absolute majority of ars moriendi focused on the spiritual well-being of the dying person and their readiness to face God’s judgment. In a society entirely dominated by Christian worldview, the soul had the priority over the body, salvation over personal happiness, suffering over health. It would be logical, in such a cultural context, to suppose that death preparation would be reserved exclusively for “clerical management of the dying” (Tingle) and making members of the clergy “deathbed specialists”. It was, however, not always the case. In ars moriendi texts by the most famous late medieval theologian Jean Gerson (1363–1429), it was the figure of amicus (friend, companion) that took central stage in a Christian death preparation. This paper seeks to trace the posterity of Gerson’s idea of amicus in morte in the sixteenth century by analyzing several most influential death preparation manuals of the time.\n\nSini Mikkola (University of Eastern Finland): Women Encountering Men in the Early Reformation\n\nOne of the first women standing up for the evangelical movement was Bavarian noblewoman Argula von Grumbach. In the famous yet imaginary depiction of her encounter with the academics of the Ingolstadt university she is portrayed standing alone, holding a book (probably Scripture), facing a group of male academics standing together in tight formation.
