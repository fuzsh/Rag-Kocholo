        "text": "The way through the southern Baltic is the only one of the three routes that only lead over land. It passes through larger cities such as Berlin, Warsaw, Vilnius and Riga and was attractive to diplomatic travelers and scholars because of the cultural sights and collections they could visit along the way. It is the only route that passes through many parts of the territory of modern Estonia.\n\nThe maps chosen for this route begin with a larger view of Europe as a whole and then successively zoom in to individual points along the way. The selection of historicized maps and the occasional unique or hand drawn specimen allow glimpses of the historical and spatial situation on the route. Having reached the cultural region of Wolfenbüttel, a number of special highlights are presented, among them Goslar as a UNESCO World Heritage Site and the Herzog August Bibliothek, which was praised as the eighth wonder of the world in the 17th century.\n\n„And the distance to Tallinn being not much less than 300 German miles, a long journey, taking the land route through Prussia and Livonia, even if there were no other hindrance, nor one such to arise en route, with such a wench, one would still have to calculate 3 whole months for the trip’s completion – from here to Tallinn – even though the travelling were to go altogether happily and well, and thus, one could hardly estimate to reach Tallinn before the month of November.”\n\nFrom: Landgr. Philipps von Hessen Antwort dem Schwedischen Secret. Christo Schieffer ausgestellt in der Vermähl.-Sache seiner Tochter mit Kön. Erich XIV. In: Göttingisches Historisches Magazin von C. Meiners und L. T. Spittler, Vol. 3 (1788), p. 703-740."
