        "text": "Archduchess Catherine of Austria (September 15, 1533 – February 1572) was one of the fifteen children of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor and Anna of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia. the oldest child and only daughter of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia (1456–1516) and his third wife Anne of Foix-Candale.\n\nKing Louis II of Hungary, Bohemia and Croatia was Anna’s younger brother. Anna’s paternal grandparents were King Casimir IV of Poland (of the Jagiellon dynasty) and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, the daughter of King Albrecht II of Germany/the Romans, Archduke of Austria, and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund and his second wife, the 17-year-old Barbara of Celje.\n\nOn March 17, 1543, Archduchess Catherine was betrothed to Francesco III Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua and Marquess of Montferrat, reflecting her father’s desire to strengthen Habsburg influence against France in northern Italy, particularly Milan.\n\nCatherine and Francesco were 9 and 10 years old at the time, so the wedding took place six years later on October 22, 1549. In October 1549, Catherine with a dowry of 100,000 Rhine florins was escorted by her elder brother Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria from Innsbruck to Mantua.\n\nThe marriage lasted only four months as Francesco drowned in Lake Como on February 21, 1550, and as a widowed Catherine returned home to Innsbruck. To improve Catherine’s chances of a better second marriage, the Habsburgs claimed that the marriage was not consummated.\n\nWhen King Sigismund II Augustus was co-crowned King of the Poland-Lithuanian Commonwealth, Chancellor Krzysztof Szydłowiecki organized a preliminary marriage treaty between the young king and Archduchess Elizabeth of Austria, daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I and his wife Anna of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia.\n\nThe marriage was signed on November 10–11, 1530 in Poznań, however, the arrangement was delayed by Queen Bona Sforza, who detested the new bride. The treaty was renewed on June 16, 1538 in Wrocław by Johannes Dantiscus and the betrothal ceremony took place on July 17, 1538 in Innsbruck.\n\nBona continued to lobby against the marriage and instead proposed Princess Margaret de Valois of France, the youngest daughter and child of King François I of France and Claude, Duchess of Brittany, to potentially form an alliance with the French against the Habsburgs.\n\nOn May 5, 1543, Elizabeth’s escorted convoy entered Kraków and was greeted with enthusiasm by both the nobles and the townsfolk. The same day 16-year-old Elizabeth married 22-year-old King Sigismund II Augustus of Poland, Grand Duke of Lithuania whom she met for the first time shortly before marriage vows.\n\nThe ceremony was performed at the Wawel Cathedral and the wedding continued for two weeks. Bona began to plot against the new queen. As a result, the newly wedded couple decided to reside in Vilnius, far from the royal court.\n\nDespite the initial euphoria demonstrated by royal subjects, the marriage was unsuccessful from the very beginning. Sigismund Augustus did not find Elizabeth attractive and continued to have extramarital affairs with several mistresses, the most famous being Barbara Radziwiłł. Elizabeth was also known to be timid, meek and apprehensive due to strict upbringing.\n\nThe young and garrulous king was also repulsed by Elizabeth’s newly diagnosed epilepsy and subsequent seizures. Only Sigismund the Old and some nobles showed compassion towards the new Queen, who was disregarded by her husband and scorned by Bona.\n\nSigismund Augustus was indifferent to her health condition; when the seizures continued to intensify he abandoned Elizabeth and returned to Kraków to collect her dowry.\n\nSigismund II Augustus also sent for Emperor Ferdinand’s doctors to travel the long distance from Vienna knowing that Elizabeth was ailing and deteriorating fast. She eventually died unattended and exhausted from the epileptic attacks on June 15, 1545 at the age of 18.\n\nSecond marriage\n\nFrom the outset of his reign, King Sigismund II Augustus came into collision with the country’s privileged nobility, who had already begun curtailing the power of the great families. The ostensible cause of the nobility’s animosity to the King was his second marriage, secretly contracted before his accession to the throne, with the Lithuanian, Calvinist and former mistress, Barbara Radziwiłł, the daughter of Hetman Jerzy Radziwiłł. The marriage was announced by the king himself on February 2, 1548 in Piotrków Trybunalski.\n\nThe young and beautiful Barbara was also despised by Queen Bona, who attempted to annul the marriage at any cost. Unlike her predecessor, Barbara was disliked by the royal court and led a more secluded life with Sigismund Augustus, who was deeply in love with her. On the other hand, she was ambitious, intelligent, perceptive and had an exemplar taste in fashion.\n\nSince the day Sigismund and Barbara met, she complained of poor health, particularly stomach and abdominal pain. After the coronation her condition deteriorated rapidly. She was tormented by strong fever, diarrhea, nausea and lack of appetite.\n\nAfter careful observation by hired medics, a lump was discovered on her stomach filled with pus. Sigismund Augustus gravely despaired and sent for doctors and even folk healers from the entire country.\n\nHe personally tended to his sick wife despite her foul smell and dedicated himself when necessary; the king hoped to take Barbara to the hunting castle at Niepołomice and ordered to demolish the small city gate so her carriage could pass freely. However, Barbara died on May 8, 1551 in Kraków after continuous pain and agony.\n\nIn my study of European Royalty and the history of monarchy in general one of the things that I’ve learned is that the concept of monarchy has been in a constant state of evolution and adaptation.\n\nI even see that here with the development of the title and position of Roman Emperor. To historians, and most of the general public, we conventionally regard Augustus as the first Roman Emperor. However, at the time of his rule Augustus did not see himself as an Emperor in the modern understanding of the word, nor did he consider Rome an Empire or a monarchy in the modern sense. To Augustus he was a leader who was preserving and strengthening the Roman Republic.\n\nJulius Caesar is considered the last dictator of the Roman Republic, a view having its origins in the Roman writers Plutarch, Tacitus, and Cassius Dio. Conversely, the majority of Roman writers, including Josephus, Pliny the Younger, Suetonius and Appian, as well as most of the ordinary people of the Empire, thought of Julius Caesar as the first Emperor.\n\nAt the end of the Republic no new, and certainly no single, title indicated the individual who held these titles also held supreme power. Insofar as Emperor could be seen as the English translation of the Latin imperator, then Julius Caesar had been an emperor, like several Roman generals before him. This is because at the time the title Imperator was a title of military command and not highest title of a reigning monarch.\n\nInstead, by the end of the Roman Republican civil wars in which Julius Caesar had led his armies, it became clear that there was certainly no consensus to return to the old-style monarchy (before the Roman Republic, Rome had been a Kingdom) but that the period when several officials, bestowed with equal power by the Roman Senate, would fight one another had come to an end.\n\nJulius Caesar, and then Augustus after him, accumulated offices and titles of the highest importance in the Republic, making the power attached to those offices permanent, and preventing anyone with similar aspirations from accumulating or maintaining power for themselves.\n\nWhen Republican Rome turned into a de facto monarchy in the second half of the 1st century BC, at first there was no name for the title of the new type of monarch. Ancient Romans abhorred the name Rex (“king”), and it was critical to the political order to maintain the forms and pretenses of republican rule. Julius Caesar had been Dictator, an acknowledged and traditional office in Republican Rome. Caesar was not the first to hold it, but following his assassination the term was abhorred in Rome.\n\nAugustus, established his hegemony by collecting on himself offices, titles, and honours of Republican Rome that had traditionally been distributed to different people, concentrating what had been distributed power in one man. One of these offices was princeps senatus, (“first man of the Senate”) and became changed into Augustus’ chief honorific, princeps civitatis (“first citizen”) from which the modern English word and title prince is descended.\n\nThe first period of the Roman Empire, from 27 BC to AD 284, is called the principate for this reason. However, it was the informal descriptive of Imperator (“commander”) that became the title increasingly favored by his successors.\n\nPreviously bestowed on high officials and military commanders who had imperium, Augustus reserved it exclusively to himself as the ultimate holder of all imperium. (Imperium is Latin for the authority to command, one of a various types of authority delineated in Roman political thought.)\n\nBeginning with Augustus, Imperator appeared in the title of all Roman monarchs through the extinction of the Empire in 1453. After the reign of Augustus’ immediate successor Tiberius, being proclaimed imperator was transformed into the act of accession to the head of state. Other honorifics used by the Roman emperors have also come to be synonyms for Emperor. Tomorrow I will examine the honorifics that evolved into titles of the Roman Emperor.\n\nAlbrecht IV of Austria (September 19, 1377 – September 14, 1404) was a Duke of Austria.\n\nAlbrecht IV of Austria was born in Vienna, the son of Duke Albrecht III of Austria and Beatrix of Nuremberg, a member of the House of Hohenzollern and a daughter of Friedrich V, Burgrave of Nuremberg and his wife Elisabeth of Meissen (a Saxony Princess of the House of Wettin).\n\nHe was the Duke of Austria from 1395 until 1404, which then included roughly today’s Lower Austria and most of Upper Austria, as the other Habsburg dominions were at that time ruled by his relatives of the Leopoldinian Line of the family. Albrecht’s rule was characterized by quarrels with that part of his family and with members of the Luxemburg dynasty, Wenceslaus of Luxembourg and Sigismund of Luxembourg.\n\nWenceslaus was King Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia from 1378 until his death and King of Germany/King of the Romans from 1376 until he was deposed in 1400. As he belonged to the House of Luxembourg, he was also Duke of Luxembourg from 1383 to 1388. Wenceslaus never held the title of Emperor.\n\nSigismund of Luxembourg was a monarch as King of Hungary and Croatia (jure uxoris) from 1387, King of Germany/Romans from 1410, King of Bohemia from 1419, and Holy Roman Emperor from 1433 until his death in 1437, as well as Prince-Elector of Brandenburg (1378–1388 and 1411–1415). He was the last male member of the House of Luxembourg.\n\nDuke Albrecht IV of Austria died at Klosterneuburg, Lower Austria, in 1404. He is buried in the Ducal Crypt in the Stephansdom in Vienna. He was succeeded by his son as Duke Albrecht V of Austria.\n\nThrough his maternal grandmother, Elisabeth of Meissen, Albrecht IV descended from Babenberg Dukes of Austria.\n\nElisabeth of Meissen was the daughter of Friedrich II, Margrave of Meissen and Mathilde of Bavaria.\n\nThe House of Babenberg was a noble dynasty of Austrian Dukes and Margraves. Originally from Bamberg in the Duchy of Franconia (present-day Bavaria), the Babenbergs ruled the imperial Margraviate of Austria from its creation in 976 AD until its elevation to a duchy in 1156, and from then until the extinction of the line in 1246, whereafter they were succeeded by the House of Habsburg, to which they were related.\n\nThe male line of the Babenbergs became extinct in 1246, when Due Friedrich II of Austria was killed in battle (the Henneberg branch of the Franconian Babenbergs lived on until 1583 when its lands were divided among the two branches of the Wettin family).\n\nFriedrich’s heir general was Gertrude of Austria, the only child of his late elder brother, Heinrich of Austria by that man’s wife, Agnes of Thuringia. However, neither her husbands nor her son succeeded in settling the Babenberg inheritance under their power. Gertrude’s only surviving child, Agnes of Baden, tried to reclaim at least part of her inheritance through her third husband Ulrich II of Heunburg, but was unsuccessful.\n\nAfter some years of struggle known as the Austrian Interregnum, or War of the Babenberg Succession (1246–1256/78/82), the Duchies of Austria and Styria fell to King Ottokar II of Bohemia and then to Count Rudolph I of Habsburg and later German King.\n\nCount Rudolph I (May 1, 1218 – July 15, 1291) was the first King of Germany/King of the Romans from the House of Habsburg. The first of the count-kings of Germany, he reigned from 1273 until his death.\n\nRudolph’s election as King marked the end of the Great Interregnum which had begun after the death of the Hohenstaufen Emperor Friedrich II in 1250. Originally a Swabian count, he was the first Habsburg to acquire the duchies of Austria and Styria in opposition to his mighty rival, the Přemyslid king Ottokar II of Bohemia, whom he defeated in the 1278 Battle on the Marchfeld.\n\nThe Austrian territories remained under Habsburg rule for more than 600 years, forming the core of the Habsburg monarchy and the present-day country of Austria. Rudolph played a vital role in raising the comital House of Habsburg to the rank of Imperial princes.\n\nDuke Leopold V of Austria, a member of the House of Babenberg and he was known for his involvement in the Third Crusade where he fought in the Siege of Acre in 1191 and of his imprisonment of King Richard of England I in 1193 at Dürnstein Castle.\n\nFamily and children\n\nDuke Albrecht IV of Austria was married in Vienna April 24, 1390 to Joanna Sophia of Bavaria, daughter of Albrecht I, Duke of Bavaria-Straubing and Margarete of Brieg. Their children were:\n\n1. Margarete (1395 – 1447), married in Landshut 25 November 1412 to Duke Heinrich XVI of Bavaria.\n\n2. Duke Albrecht V (1397–1439).\n\nHenry, Duke of Gloucester (July 8, 1640 – September 13, 1660) was the youngest son of King Charles I of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and his wife, Princess Henrietta Maria de Bourbon of France the daughter King Henri IV of France and Navarre and his second wife, Marie de’ Medici.\n\nFrom the age of two, Henry and with his sister Elizabeth were separated from their family during the English Civil War and became prisoners of Parliament. For several years, the children were constantly transported from one residence to another due to the plague raging in London.\n\nThey also periodically changed their governesses and guardians to those more loyal to the government. In 1645, Henry and Elizabeth were joined by their elder brother James, Duke of York, who found himself in a difficult financial situation.\n\nIn 1647, Charles I was arrested, and during the years 1647–1648 he was allowed to see his children several times. In April 1648 James fled the country; it was probably planned that he would take Henry with him, but Elizabeth was afraid to let her younger brother go. When in 1649 Charles I was sentenced to death, he, fearing that Henry would be proclaimed king and made a puppet of the government, took an oath from his eight-year-old son not to take the crown for anything while both of his older brothers were alive.\n\nAfter the execution of Charles I, Scotland proclaimed his eldest son Charles II as their sovereign. In the summer of 1650, he landed in Scotland, which prompted Parliament to send the children of the late monarch to Carisbrooke Castle on the Isle of Wight, where their father had previously been imprisoned.\n\nBefore leaving for Carisbrooke, Henry and Elizabeth were stripped of all titles and privileges. Shortly after arriving on the Isle of Wight in September 1650, Henry’s sister fell ill and died. Henry remained at Carisbrooke until the following year, when, with the permission of Oliver Cromwell, he returned to the continent, where he eventually joined his mother in Paris.\n\nWith Henrietta Maria, whom the prince had not seen for eleven years, Henry did not have a good understanding: the prince was an ardent Protestant, and his mother was an implacable Catholic. The Queen, against the wishes of her late husband and eldest son, tried to convert Henry to Catholicism, but this only deteriorated their relationship.\n\nHenry went to his brother Charles in Cologne. In 1657, the prince fought on the side of the Spanish against France with his brother James. In May 1659, Charles restored to his brother the title of Duke of Gloucester, which Henry had been deprived of by Parliament in 1650, and bestowed the title of Earl of Cambridge.\n\nAfter the restoration of the monarchy in England in 1660, Henry accompanied his brother during his return to Britain. There Henry received a number of appointments, but before the coronation of Charles II, he contracted smallpox and died. He was buried in the vault of Mary I, Queen of Scots in Westminster Abbey, where his elder sister Mary, who also died of smallpox, was buried a few weeks later.\n\nLeopold V, Archduke of Further Austria (October 9, 1586 – September 13, 1632) was the son of Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria, and the younger brother of Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand II, He was Bishop of Passau and of Strasbourg, until he resigned to get married, and Archduke of Further Austria including Tirol.\n\nLeopold’s mother was his father’s niece Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria,\n\nPrincess Maria Anna of Bavaria was a daughter of Albrecht V, Duke of Bavaria and Archduchess Anna of Austria, the third of fifteen children of Emperor Ferdinand I (1503–1564) from his marriage with the Jagiellonian Princess Anna of Bohemia and Hungary (1503–1547). Her siblings included: Elizabeth, Queen of Poland, Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II, Archduke of Further Austria, Catherine, Queen of Poland, Eleanor, Duchess of Mantua, Barbara, Duchess of Ferrara, Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria and Johanna, Duchess of Tuscany, Maria Magdalena, Grand Duchess of Tuscany.\n\nOn August 26, 1571 in Vienna, the 20-year-old Maria Anna of Bavaria married her maternal uncle the 31-year-old Archduke Charles II of Inner Austria. The marriage was arranged to give Austria political support from Bavaria and Bavaria an agent in Vienna.\n\nThe relation between Maria Anna and Charles was described as good, and the couple had 15 children in just 18 years. Maria Anna was described as confident, ambitious and a great lover of pomp and power, but foremost a devout Catholic.\n\nArchduke Leopold V was born in Graz, and was invested as bishop in 1598, as a child, even though he had not been ordained as a priest; he became Bishop of Strasbourg in 1607, a post which he held until 1626. From 1609 onwards he fought with his mercenaries in the War of the Jülich succession, and in the Brothers’ Quarrel within the Austrian Habsburg dynasty against his first cousin Maximilian III, Archduke of Further Austria in Tyrol, and from 1611.\n\nArchduke Maximilian III of Further Austria was the fourth son of the Emperor Maximilian II and Infanta Maria of Spain (daughter of Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor and King of Spain, and Infanta Isabella of Portugal).\n\nArchduke Maximilian III was a grandson of Anna of Bohemia and Hungary, daughter and heiress of King Vladislaus II of Bohemia, Hungary and Croatia who himself was the eldest son of Casimir IV of Poland from the Jagiellonian dynasty.\n\nArchduke Leopold V fought the Brother’s Quarrel with his first cousin Holy Roman Rudolph II in Bohemia.\n\nWith great concern, the Habsburgs observed the increasing psychological decline of the ageing Emperor Rudolph II. After Archduke Ernst’s death in 1595, Matthias became the oldest Archduke. From 1599 onward, Matthias in vain urged the childless Emperor Rudolph II to arrange his succession to the Imperial Throne, but Matthias was rejected.\n\nThe crisis carried on in 1604 during the uprising of Stephen Bocskai in Hungary. Matthias initially avoided an argument with the Emperor, but Bishop Klesl urged him to take command in what became known as Brothers’ Quarrel.\n\nTheir other brothers—Maximilian III and Archduke Albrecht VII—and their cousins—especially Emperor Ferdinand II and Archduke Leopold V—were also deeply involved in their dispute. The family feud weakened the Habsburgs’ position and enabled the Estates of their realms to win widespread political and religious concessions.\n\nArchduke Albrecht VII succeeded his brother Archduke Matthias as reigning Archduke of Lower and Upper Austria, but abdicated in favor of Emperor Ferdinand II the same year, making it the shortest (and often ignored) reign in Austrian history.\n\nIn 1614, Archduke Leopold V financed the construction of the Church of the Jesuit College of Molsheim, within which his coat of arms is still prominently displayed.\n\nIn 1619, upon the death of his kinsman and former rival, Maximilian III, Archduke Leopold V became governor of Archduke Maximilian III’s inheritance: Further Austria and Tyrol, where he attained the position of ruler as Archduke of Further Austria from 1626 to his death in 1632.\n\nArchduke Leopold V had the custom house and the Jesuit church built in Innsbruck. He fought for the Veltlin and defended Tyrol against the Swedes in 1632. He died in Schwaz, Tyrol and was succeeded as Archduke of Further Austria by his eldest son, Archduke Ferdinand Charles.\n\nMarriage and Family\n\nIn 1626 Archduke Leopold resigned his ecclesiastical positions and married Claudia de’ Medici. Claudia de Medici was born in Florence into the House of Medici, and was the youngest daughter of Ferdinando I de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and his wife, Christina of Lorraine. She was named after her grandmother Claude of Valois, herself granddaughter of Claude, Duchess of Brittany, consort to King François I of France.\n\nArchduke Leopold V of Further Austria became the founder of the most recent line of Archdukes of Further Austria of the Habsburg family, which persisted until 1665.\n\nHis children with Claudia de Medici were:\n\n1. Archduchess Maria-Eleonora (1627–1629)\n\n2. Archduke Ferdinand Charles (1628–1662)\n\n3. Archduchess Isabella-Clara (1629–1685); married Charles III, Duke of Mantua\n\n4. Archduke Sigismund Franz (1630-1665); married Hedwig of the Palatinate-Sulzbach\n\n5. Archduchess Maria Leopoldine (1632–1649); married her cousin Holy Roman Emperor Ferdinand III. She was his second wife and they were first cousins as male-line grandchildren of Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria, and Princess Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nArchduke Leopold V of Further Austria and Claudia de Medici ‘s eldest son, Archduke Ferdinand Charles of Further Austria, married his cousin Anna de Medici the daughter of Cosimo II de Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and Archduchess Maria Magdalena of Austria the youngest daughter of Archduke Charles II, Archduke of Inner Austria, and his wife Maria Anna of Bavaria….the grandfather of Archduke Ferdinand Charles.\n\nOne of their three children was Archduchess Claudia Felicitas of Austria (1653 – 1676) who married her cousin Leopold I, Holy Roman Emperor, the second son of Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, by his first wife, Infanta Maria Anna of Spain, the daughter of the Spanish Habsburg King Felipe III of Spain and his wife his first-cousin, once-removed, Archduchess Margaret of Austria the daughter of Archduke Charles II of Austria and Maria Anna of Bavaria.\n\nThis blog entry has enough genealogy to make you dizzy!\n\nGrand Duke Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia (August 30, 1917 – April 21, 1992) was the Head of the Imperial Family of Russia, a position which he claimed from 1938 to his death. He was born 6 months after Emperor Nicholas II had abdicated.\n\nVladimir was born Prince Vladimir Kirillovich of Russia at Porvoo in the Grand Duchy of Finland, the only son of Grand Duke Cyril Vladimirovich and Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.\n\nPrincess Victoria Melita was a daughter of Prince Alfred of the United Kingdom (second son of Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom), Duke of Edinburgh and Reigning Duke of Saxe-Gotha-Gotha and his wife Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia, the fifth child and only surviving daughter of Emperor Alexander II of Russia and Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine.\n\nVladimir married Princess Leonida Georgievna Bagration-Moukhransky on August 13, 1948 in Lausanne. She was a daughter of Prince George Bagration of Mukhrani and his Polish wife Helena Sigismundovna, née Nowina Złotnicka (1886–1979). She descended patrilineally from former Kings of Georgia.\n\nHer mother’s family belonged to the untitled Polish aristocracy, although one of Leonida’s two lines of descent from Georgia’s penultimate King Erekle II (Heraclius II) is through her mother, a descendant of the king’s daughter, Princess Anastasia, who married an Eristavi prince. The other ancestral line derives through the marriage of another of the king’s daughters, Princess Tamara, to Ioane Bagrationi, 18th Prince of Mukhrani.\n\nThe Bagration family’s genealogy traces back at least to the medieval era in its male line and hundreds of years further back as rulers in the female line. Leonida’s grandfather, Prince Alexander Bagration of Mukhrani, was born in 1853 in Georgia’s historical capital Tbilisi, then part of the Russian Empire, and was killed by Bolsheviks at Pyatigorsk in 1918 during the Russian revolution.\n\nPre-revolutionary Pauline Romanov House dictated that only those born of an “equal marriage” between a Romanov dynast and a member of a “royal or sovereign house”, were included in the Imperial line of succession to the Russian throne; children of morganatic marriages were ineligible to inherit the throne or dynastic status.\n\nThe family to which Princess Leonida belonged, the Bagrationi dynasty, had been kings in Georgia from the medieval era until the early 19th century, but no male line ancestor of hers had reigned as a king in Georgia since 1505 and her branch of the Bagrations, the House of Mukhrani, had been naturalised among the non-ruling nobility of Russia after Georgia was annexed to the Russian empire in 1801.\n\nYet the royal status of the House of Bagration had been recognized by Russia in the 1783 Treaty of Georgievsk and was confirmed by Vladimir Kirillovich on December 5, 1946 as claimed head of the Russian imperial house. However the last ruling Emperor of Imperial Russia, Nicholas II, had deemed marriage in this family of Princess Tatiana Constantinova in 1911, as morganatic.\n\nSome controversy therefore arises as to whether Vladimir’s marriage to Leonida was equal or morganatic, and whether his claim to the Imperial throne validly passed to his daughter Maria, to some other dynast, or to no one upon his death.\n\nFollowing Vladimir’s public designation of his daughter as “curatrix of the throne”, in anticipation that she would eventually succeed him as head of the dynasty in exile, the heads of three of the other branches of the imperial family—the Princes Vsevolod Ioannovich (Konstantinovichi), Roman Petrovich (Nikolaevichi) and Andrei Alexandrovich (Mihailovichi) — wrote to Vladimir in 1969, asserting that the dynastic status of his daughter was no different from that of their own children (Vsevolod Ioannovich was childless, but Roman Petrovich had two sons by Countess Prascovia Sheremetyev, while Andrei Alexandrovich had two sons by Donna Elisabeth Ruffo of a Russian branch of the Princes di San Sant’ Antimo) and that his wife was of no higher status than the wives of the other Romanov princes.\n\nJutta (Bonne) of Luxemburg (May 20, 1315 – September 11, 1349), was born Jutta (Judith), the second daughter of King John of Bohemia, and his first wife, Elisabeth of Bohemia, daughter of King Wenceslaus II of Bohemia and Judith of Habsburg, the youngest daughter of King Rudolph I of the Romans/Germany and Gertrude of Hohenberg.\n\nJohn the Blind or John of Luxembourg was the Count of Luxembourg from 1313 and King of Bohemia from 1310 and titular King of Poland. He is well known for having died while fighting in the Battle of Crécy at age 50, after having been blind for a decade. In his home country of Luxembourg he is considered a national hero.\n\nComparatively, in the Czech Republic (the Kingdom of Bohemia), is often recognized for his role as the father of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor, one of the more significant Kings of Bohemia and one of the leading Holy Roman Emperors.\n\nIn June or July 1315, Jutta was betrothed to the future King Casimir the Great of Poland, son of Władysław Łokietek., but he married Aldona of Lithuania in 1325 instead.\n\nIn 1326, Jutta was next betrothed to Henri of Bar. This arrangement was broken, however, and she stayed at the abbey of Saint-Esprit until her marriage to Jean, Duke of Normandy and future King Jean II of France.\n\nShe was 17 years old, and the future king was 13. Her name Jutta (or Guta), translatable into English as Good (in the feminine case), was changed by the time of her marriage to Bonne (French) or Bona (Latin). Upon marriage, Bonne was the wife of the heir to the French throne, becoming Duchess of Normandy and Countess of Anjou and Maine.\n\nThe wedding was celebrated in the presence of six thousand guests. The festivities were prolonged by a further two months when the young groom was finally knighted at the cathedral of Notre-Dame in Paris. John was solemnly granted the arms of a knight in front of a prestigious audience bringing together the kings of Bohemia and Navarre, and the dukes of Burgundy, Lorraine and the Brabant.\n\nBonne was a patron of the arts, the composer Guillaume de Machaut being one of her favorites.\n\nShe died on September 11, 1349 of the bubonic plague in Maubuisson, France at the age of thirty-four. She was buried in the Abbey of Maubuisson. however, as she died a year prior to his accession, she was never a French queen.\n\nAmong her children were King Charles V of France, Philippe II, Duke of Burgundy, and Joan, Queen of Navarre as the wife of King Charles II of Navarre.\n\nLess than six months after Bonne’s death, Prince Jean married Joan I, Countess of Auvergne.\n\nJohann Georg of Brandenburg (September 11, 1525 – January 8, 1598) was a Prince-Elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg (1571–1598).\n\nBorn as a member of the House of Hohenzollern, Johann Georg of Brandenburg was the son of Joachim II Hector, Prince-Elector of Brandenburg, and his first wife Princess Magdalena of Saxony, who was the daughter of Georg the Bearded, Duke of Saxony and his wife Barbara Jagiellon of Poland, the sixth daughter of King Casimir IV of Poland and Archduchess Elisabeth of Austria, daughter of Albrecht II, King of the Romans and his wife Elizabeth of Luxembourg, daughter of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nBarbara Jagiellon of Poland, was named after her great-grandmother, Barbara of Celje, Holy Roman Empress the wife of Emperor Sigismund.\n\nBarbara of Celge was the daughter and youngest child of Herman II, Count of Celje, and Countess Anna of Schaunberg. Barbara was engaged in 1405 to Sigismund of Luxembourg, King of Bohemia, King of Hungary, and King of Croatia a younger son of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor. The marriage likely took place in December 1405.\n\nBiography\n\nFaced with large debts of 2.5 million guilder accumulated during the reign of his father, Johann Georg instituted a grain tax which drove part of the peasantry into dependence on a nobility that was exempt from taxation. He had Jews expelled from Brandenburg in 1573, stripped of their assets and prohibited from returning.\n\nThough a staunch Lutheran opposed to the rise of Calvinism, he permitted the admission of Calvinist refugees from the wars in the Spanish Netherlands and France. On July 13, 1574, he founded the Berlinisches Gymnasium zum Grauen Kloster, the first humanistic educational institution in Berlin.\n\nUpon his death on January 8, 1598 was succeeded by his son Prince-Elector Joachim Friedrich of Brandenburg.\n\nUpon the death of his kinsman Albrecht I, Duke of Prussia in 1568, the Duchy of Prussia was inherited by the latter’s underage son Albrecht Friedrich. Johann Georg’s father was a co-inheritor of the Duchy of Prussia. In 1577 the Brandenburg electors became co-regent with Duke Albrecht Friedrich of Prussia.\n\nFamily and children\n\nJohann Georg was married three times.\n\nHis first wife was Princess Sophie of Legnica (ca. 1525 – 1546), whom he married in 1545. She was the daughter Friedrich II, Duke of Legnica, Brzeg, and Wohlau, and his second wife, Sophie of Brandenburg-Ansbach-Kulmbach (1485 – 1537).\n\nThey had one child together:\n\nJoachim Friedrich (1546 – 1608) ~ Succeeded his father as Prince-Electors of Brandenburg.\n\nSecondly, in 1548, he married Margravine Sabina of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1529 – 1575), the daughter of Georg, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1484–1543) from his second marriage to Hedwig of Münsterberg-Oels (1508–1531). His first wife Sophie of Legnica was Sabina’s cousin. The day before the wedding ceremony, she solemnly renounced her possible paternal inheritance.\n\nFor 23 years Sabina’s husband, Prince Johann Georg, was heir apparent to the Electorate of Brandenburg The couple spent this time on various castles in the territories of Brandenburg. The family’s official residence was Zechlin castle in Rheinsberg near Wittstock.\n\nThey had eleven children\n\nThirdly, he married Princess Elisabeth of Anhalt-Zerbst (15 September [1563 – 1607) in 1577. Princess Elisabeth of Anhalt-Zerbst was a daughter of Joachim Ernst, Prince of Anhalt (1536–1585), from his first marriage to Countess Agnes of Barby-Mühlingen (1540–1569).\n\nThey had eleven children\n\nFrom his three marriages Prince-Elector Johann Georg of Brandenburg had 23 children in total with 12 children reaching adulthood.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (November 18, 1856 – January 5, 1929) was a Russian general in World War I (1914–1918).\n\nFamily\n\nA very tall man (1.98m / 6′ 6″), Grand Duke Nicholas, named after his paternal grandfather, the Emperor Nicholas I of Russia, was born as the eldest son to Grand Duke Nicholas Nicolaevich of Russia (1831–1891) and Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg (1838–1900) onNovember 18, 1856.\n\nHis father was the sixth child and third son born to Emperor Nicholas I of Russia and his Empress Consort Alexandra Fedorovna (1798–1860). Alexandra Fedorovna was born Princess Charlotte of Prussia the daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm III of Prussia and Louise of Mecklenburg-Strelitz.\n\nNicholas’s mother, Duchess Alexandra of Oldenburg, his father’s first cousin’s daughter, was a daughter of Duke Constantine Peter of Oldenburg (1812–1881) and Princess Therese of Nassau (1815–1871).\n\nHis maternal grandfather, Duke Peter of Oldenburg, was a son of Duke George of Oldenburg and Grand Duchess Catherine Pavlovna of Russia, daughter of Paul I of Russia and Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg.\n\nSophie Dorothea of Württemberg was a daughter of Duke Friedrich Eugene of Württemberg and Princess Friederike of Brandenburg-Schwedt.\n\nAfter Grand Duke Paul (the future Emperor Paul I of Russia) became a widower in 1776, King Friedrich II of Prussia (Sophie Dorothea’s maternal great-uncle) and Empress Catherine II of Russia chose Sophie Dorothea as the ideal candidate to become Paul’s second wife.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas was the first cousin once removed of Emperor Nicholas II. To distinguish between them, the Grand Duke was often known within the Imperial family as “Nikolasha”: the Grand Duke was also known as “Nicholas the Tall” while the Emperor was “Nicholas the Short”.\n\nOn April 29, 1907, Grand Duke Nicholas married Princess Anastasia of Montenegro (1869–1935), the daughter of King Nicholas I, and sister of Princess Milica, who had married Nicholas’s brother, Grand Duke Peter. They had no children. She had previously been married to George Maximilianovich, 6th Duke of Leuchtenberg, by whom she had two children, until their divorce in 1906. Since the Montenegrins were a fiercely Slavic, anti-Ottoman people from the Balkans, Anastasia reinforced the Pan-Slavic tendencies of Nicholas.\n\nRevolution\n\nThe February Revolution found Nicholas in the Caucasus. He was appointed by the Emperor, in his last official act, as the supreme commander in chief, and was wildly received as he journeyed to headquarters in Mogilev; however, within 24 hours of his arrival, the new Prime Minister, Prince Georgy Lvov, cancelled his appointment.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas spent the next two years in Crimea, sometimes under house arrest, taking little part in politics. There appears to have been some sentiment to have him head the White Army forces active in southern Russia at the time, but the leaders in charge, especially General Anton Denikin, were afraid that a strong monarchist figurehead would alienate the more left leaning constituents of the movement. He and his wife escaped just ahead of the Red Army in April 1919, aboard the British Royal Navy battleship HMS Marlborough.\n\nOn August 8, 1922, Grand Duke Nicholas was proclaimed as Nicholas III, Emperor of all the Russias by the Zemsky Sobor of the Priamurye region in the Far East by White Army general Mikhail Diterikhs. Nicholas was already living abroad and consequently was not present. Two months later the Priamurye region fell to the Bolsheviks.\n\nIn exile\n\nAfter a stay in Genoa as a guest of his brother-in-law, Victor Emmanuel III, King of Italy, Grand Duke Nicholas and his wife took up residence in a small chateau at Choigny, 20 miles outside of Paris. He was under the protection of the French secret police as well as by a small number of faithful Cossack retainers.\n\nHe became the symbolic figurehead of an anti-Soviet Russian monarchist movement, after assuming on November 16, 1924 the supreme command of all Russian forces in exile and thus of the Russian All-Military Union, which had been founded in the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes by Gen Pyotr Wrangel two months prior.\n\nThe monarchists made plans to send agents into Russia. Conversely a top priority of the Soviet secret police was to penetrate this monarchist organization and to kidnap Grand Duke Nicholas.\n\nThey were successful in the former, infiltrating the group with spies (OGPU later lured the anti-Bolshevik British master spy Sidney Reilly back to the Soviet Union (1925) where he was killed). They did not succeed however, in kidnapping Grand Duke Nicholas. As late as June 1927, the monarchists were able to set off a bomb at the Lubyanka Prison in Moscow.\n\nGrand Duke Nicholas died on January 5, 1929 of natural causes on the French Riviera, where he had gone to escape the rigors of winter. He was originally buried in the church of St. Michael the Archangel Church in Cannes, France.\n\nIn 2014 Nicholas Romanov, Prince of Russia (1922–2014) and Prince Dimitri Romanov (1926–2016) requested the transfer of his remains. The bodies of Nicholas Nikolaevich and his wife were re-buried in Moscow at the World War I memorial military cemetery in May 2015.\n\nThe Queen’s last public message was issued on September 7, to her Canadian people, in the aftermath of the Saskatchewan stabbings.\n\nThe last time I saw pictures of Queen Elizabeth II was general her Platinum jubilee says celebrations June. From June to September I don’t think I saw any pictures of her majesty until the pictures from her meeting with her final prime minister please trust on September 6.\n\nI was honestly shocked to see how she had deteriorated during those few months. Sadly, I knew it wouldn’t be long before she passed but I didn’t think it would be in the next couple of days.\n\nLiz Truss was the fifteenth and final British Prime Minister to serve under Elizabeth II. Prime Minister Truss was told of the Queen’s ill health in the early morning and that the Queen’s passing was a “matter of hours, not days”; Truss ordered black clothes from Greenwich in the event of her death.\n\nA witness said that “[Truss] knew it would be that day but she had to go to the Commons to pretend everything was normal”. Upon Elizabeth’s death, Truss delivered a statement outside 10 Downing Street paying tribute to her, saying “Queen Elizabeth II was the rock on which modern Britain was built. Our country has grown and flourished under her reign. Britain is the great country it is today because of her”.\n\nOn September 8, 2022, Buckingham Palace released a statement which read: “Following further evaluation this morning, the Queen’s doctors are concerned for Her Majesty’s health and have recommended she remain under medical supervision. The Queen remains comfortable and at Balmoral.” Her immediate family rushed to Balmoral to be by her side.\n\nWhen I had heard/read that the members of the Royal Family were rushing to be by her side I knew the end was very near.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II died peacefully at 15:10 BST at the age of 96, with two of her children, Charles and Anne, by her side; Charles immediately succeeded as monarch as King Charles III of the United Kingdom. Her death was announced to the public at 18:30, setting in motion Operation London Bridge and, because she died in Scotland, Operation Unicorn. Elizabeth II was the first monarch to die in Scotland since James V in 1542. Her death certificate recorded her cause of death as “old age”.\n\nIt was very sad news for me. I was born in 1963 and Queen Elizabeth II was the only British monarch I had ever known. To me she was an exemplary monarch. She carried out her duties with devotion and dignity.\n\nHer passing left me with mixed emotions I did not expect. I experienced profound grief at her passing and at the same time I felt joy and excitement for Charles and his new role as King. It was an emotional rollercoaster.\n\nI still miss Queen Elizabeth II despite the fact that King Charles is doing an excellent job as King. For today I will celebrate the life of Queen Elizabeth II and remember her dedication and service as her country’s Head of State."
