        "text": "This page is owned by Zarexian Mapper.\n\nPlease ask him before making relevant edits.\n\nSchaumburg-Lippe, officially the Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe (German: Freistaat Schaumburg-Lippe), is a German-speaking and landlocked microstate located in Central Europe enclaved by Germany. The capital is Bückeburg while the most populous town is Stadthagen. It covers an area of 340 square kilometres (130 sq mi), about twice the size of Liechtenstein. With a population of 75,190, it makes the world's eleventh-smallest country in the world both in terms of area and population.\n\nSchaumburg-Lippe arosed in 1647 by the division of the County of Schaumburg among the House of Brunswick-Lüneburg, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel and the Count of Lippe. The existence of the small territory of the County of Schaumburg-Lippe was difficult from the very beginning. Facilities were initially shared with the Hessian part, the County of Schaumburg. The territorial independence was always endangered by the Hessian landgraves, which is one of the reasons why Count Wilhelm (r. 1748–1777) developed a specific form of national defence, but also caused the small state to become over-indebted. Under Count Georg Wilhelm (r. 1787–1860), Schaumburg-Lippe became part of the Napoleonic-dominated Confederation of the Rhine and was rewarded by the enhancement to a principality (1807). After the defeat of Napoleon the microstate joined the German Confederation and would eventually become a federal state of the German Empire. After World War I, Prince Adolf II renounced his throne on 15 November, 1918 as one of the last remaining monarchs in Germany.\n\nSchaumburg-Lippe then became a free state within the Weimar Republic. A final constitution of Schaumburg-Lippe was eventually enacted in 1922. During Nazi rule the democratic government was suppressed. At the end of World War II, the British military occupation government decreed on 1 November 1946 the union of Schaumburg-Lippe, Hanover, Brunswick and Oldenburg to form the new state of Lower Saxony. This new state received little approval from the people of Schaumburg. A plebiscite held on 19 January, 1975 to restore the former state was rejected by the federal legislature despite a positive outcome. This triggered a wave of outrage, which the Red Army Faction used to undermine the political institutions of the Federal Republic. To solve this constitutional crisis a radical decision was struck when Schaumburg-Lippe was kicked out of Germany intended to forestall other attempts at changing the post-war order, such as Oldenburg which also had a successful plebiscite, but it had the opposite effect and the federal government soon had to give in to the wishes of the Oldenburgers. However, the people of Schaumburg-Lippe felt betrayed and declared themselves as fully independent, adopting a modified version of the 1922 constitution. This led to a second constitutional crisis, which was resolved by the Bielefeld Customs Treaty. The independence of the Free State was recognized, but politically and economically it would become nothing more than a puppet state of its larger and stronger neighbour.\n\n92% of the residents describe themselves ethnic Germans, the rest is made up from other EU countries, the Middle East or Afghanistan. The Evangelical Lutheran Church of Schaumburg-Lippe is nominally the largest and most important religion in the microstate, but the number of atheists is steadily increasing. The Free State is a member of the United Nations, the European Free Trade Association, and the Council of Europe. Although not a member of the European Union because it was not designed with microstates in mind, it participates in both the Schengen Area and the European Economic Area. It has a customs union and a monetary union with Germany.\n\nEtymology[]\n\nUsually when a political unit in the German realm consists of two words combined with a hyphen, such as Schaumburg-Lippe, it implies that two geographic or political regions have been merged (e.g. Baden-Württemberg, Schleswig-Holstein, etc.). In this case, however, only Schaumburg is meant to describe a region. The former County of Schaumburg was partitioned in 1647, and one of the newly created administrative units was to become Schaumburg-Lippe. Since the part of Schaumburg ruled by the Hessians was still called Schaumburg, the name -Lippe, the ruling house of the newly established county, was added to the present day country in order to distinguish between the two Schaumburg.\n\nThe name of the former County of Schaumburg can be traced to the House of Schauenburg, who ruled the county before the partition and in turn got their name from Schaumburg castle. The castle is located in Rinteln, the Hessian part of Schaumburg, now a part of Germany and used to be called Schauenburg, but was later renamed to Schaumburg, while the ruling dynasty is still called Schauenburg. The origin of Schaumburg itself has not been historically recorded. The House of Lippe, which incidentally also ruled the Principality of Lippe, is named after the once Lippian Lippstadt, located on the river Lippe. What exactly Lippe means isn't clear, it could originate in an Indo-European term that means stream or slike. The Latin form of the river (Lupia) has been comprehensible for over 2000 years.\n\nHistory[]\n\nOrigins in Medieval times[]\n\nIn 1110, the Saxon Duke Lothar von Süpplingenburg, later Emperor Lothar III (r. 1133-1137), fiefed the noble Adolf von der Schauenburg with the counties of Holstein and Stormarn. Its origin is unknown, but he probably was the builder of the Schaumburg castle, after which he named himself. Adolf was to defend the endangered border to the Slavs. He and his successors also colonized eastern Holstein. Hamburg was expanded by Count Adolf I, Lübeck by Count Adolf II in 1143 and Kiel by Adolf IV between 1233 and 1242 as a newly established city, as well as Plön, Eutin and Travemünde which emerged under their leadership. The Schauenburgers managed to become one of the most important dynasties in the southern Baltic Sea. By marriage they related to the kings of Sweden and Denmark, to the dukes of Saxe-Lauenburg, Brunswick-Lüneburg and Mecklenburg with one line eventually becoming the dukes of Schleswig. The shared history of the modern state of Schleswig-Holstein and the Schaumburg region is symbolically expressed in the coat of arms: the nettle leaf is part of the Schleswig-Holstein coat of arms as well as a symbol of the Free State of Schaumburg-Lippe. The Counts of Holstein-Schauenburg were initially only endowed with selective goods and rights in the area between the Steinhuder Meer and Hamelin, facing the Counts of Roden, the Bishops of Minden and the Dukes of Saxony as fierce competition. Only in the course of the High Middle Ages did the Schauenburgers assert themselves in what would soon become the Schaumburg region and create a closed territory.\n\nOne means that the Schauenburgers used to expand and consolidate their dominion was the systematic clearing and resettlement of the boondocks (internal colonization) north of the Bückeberge, the Stadthäger plain. The Schaumburg Forest is a remnant of the Dülwald, a primeval forest that disappeared during colonization in the 13th century. The Hagenhufendörfer (e.g. Pollhagen, Probsthagen, Vornhagen) were established with special rights and with a typical layout: along a road, narrow fields lined up next to each other like towels for kilometers on one side while farms with meadows and pastures were opposite on the other side.\n\nThe two monasteries of Möllenbeck and Fischbeck in the Weser Valley are among the oldest documented settlements in Schaumburg with the oldest surviving document concerned about the Möllenbeck monastery dated 13 August, 896, a Benedictine monastery converted into an Augustinian monastery in 1441 before it became a canonical monastery after the Reformation in 1559 and a Hessian domain after the Thirty Years' War, with whose goods the University of Rinteln, founded in 1621, was furnished. The collegiate church, a Protestant parish church since 1836, is one of the most important late Gothic monuments in the central Weser area. The two striking stair towers are the remains of a Romanesque westwork. The ladies' foundations in Fischbeck was established on 10 January, 955, making it the oldest documented place in Schaumburg. In the mid-1200s the Augustinian rule was introduced. After the Reformation, it was transformed into a free imperial abbey, which lives on to this day as an evangelical ladies' foundation. The Romanesque building forms from around 1100 and the coherence of the complex make it a remarkable example of medieval monastic tradition. As part of the municipality of Hessisch Oldendorf, Fischbeck no longer belongs to Schaumburg since the administrative reform in 1973. The former Augustinian nunnery in Obernkirchen, founded shortly before 1167, also survived as a Protestant ladies' foundations. In 1498 the priory also had income from coal mining; which served to equip the in 1621 based University of Rinteln. The late medieval hall church with a double-towered Romanesque west wing is also used as an evangelical parish church. In 1225 the Cistercian monastery at Bischoperode near Stadthagen was moved to Rinteln, later converted into a Benedictine monastery. After the Reformation, its buildings were handed over to the newly founded university by Prince Ernst in 1621, and its goods were used to equip them. The university eventually was closed in 1810, the buildings were demolished and the Ernestinum Gymnasium was built in its place. Of the medieval buildings, only the high Gothic church has survived, which today serves as a Protestant parish church. The income from the Augustinian monastery in Egestorf, established in 1298, was also used to fund the University of Rinteln. It disappeared without leaving any obvious traces. From the Franciscan monastery in Stadthagen, which was built in 1486 and only existed for a short time until the Reformation, only the chancel of the Gothic church remains, which is still used by the Protestant community as a place of worship today.\n\nThe founding and expansion of towns was also part of the measures taken to develop the lands in the Middle Ages. Stadthagen am Hellweg, Rinteln on the Weser and Oldendorf on the road from Minden to Hildesheim were therefore planned by the Schauenburg counts around 1225/30. Stadthagen and Rinteln received Lippstadt city rights and fortifications, which were converted into a park at the beginning of the 19th century and as such - easily recognizable to everyone - now surround the medieval old town. Impressive town buildings, town halls and parish churches testify the prosperity and self-confidence of its citizens, Burgmannshöfe to the attractiveness of the city for families of knights in the surroundings. The bourgeois settlements in Bückeburg, Rodenberg, Hagenburg - based by the counts of Roden - and Sachsenhagen - established by the Ascanians - were linked to sovereign castles, Möllenbeck and Obernkirchen to the respective monastery; the Steinhude fishing settlement was under the influence of the canonical monastery of Wunstorf. Its legal and economic development probably fell short of the expectations of its founders as they remained in the rank of minor cities. Bückeburg received city rights in 1609, Obernkirchen as well as Rodenberg in 1615, and Sachsenhagen in 1650. Möllenbeck even reverted back into a village in the Late Middle Ages.\n\nThrough skilful politics, the counts of Schauenburg had created a coherent small territory in their ancestral lands - the Holstein possessions had been reduced to the dominion of Pinneberg with Altona during the High Middle Ages. Since they were regarded as equals by noble families such as Brunswick-Lüneburg, out of the 10 children of Otto II, daughter Mathilde († 1468), married two Dukes of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Anton (1439-1526), a daughter of the Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg, and Johann (1449-1527) the Cordula of Gemen, who brought the Lordship of Gemen in Münsterland (including the Lordship of Bergen in North Holland) into the marriage as a dowry. The Schauenburg counts also had a career as prince-bishops up to the end of the Middle Ages: three bishops to Hildesheim, five bishops to Minden, one bishop to Olmütz - not counting the other ecclesiastical dignitaries in the cathedral chapters - came from the Schauenburg family; two counts of Schauenburg (Adolf r. 1547-1556; Anton r. 1557-1558) were even archbishops of Cologne and thus electors of the empire.\n\nReformation, zenith and demise[]\n\nThe Reformation was introduced in 1559, i.e. comparatively late, under Count Otto IV (r. 1544-1576), who was initially on the Catholic side. Otto had studied in Leuven, was Bishop of Hildesheim from 1531 to 1537 and took part in the war against France on the side of Spain before he eventually married Elisabeth Ursula of Brunswick-Lüneburg, a daughter of Duke Ernst, the Confessor, in 1558. Under her influence, evangelical teaching was introduced in Schaumburg. The two monasteries of Obernkirchen and Fischbeck have survived to this day as ladies' foundation.\n\nThe county experienced its cultural peak under Otto's son Ernst (r. 1601-1622). Ernst was born in Bückeburg in 1569, grew up in Detmold at the court of Simon VI. to Lippe, studied law in Helmstedt, stayed in Kassel at the court of the very erudite Landgrave Moritz and got to know the art and culture of Italy and the Netherlands on educational trips through half of Europe. He married Landgrave Moritz's sister, Hedwig. Advised by outstanding men, he refurbished the country's finances, led the country to economic prosperity and reorganized Schaumburg. In 1606 he moved the main residence from Stadthagen to Bückeburg, which he expanded according to his ambitious plans and standards. The Golden Hall with its gate of the gods still impresses every visitor to Bückeburg Castle with its glance; the town church and the layout of the town square together with the adjoining buildings also originating in Count Ernst. Further noteworthy achievements consist of the mausoleum in Stadthagen by Giovanni Maria Nosseni and its important sculptures by Adriaen de Vries, the academic high school in Stadthagen and the University of Rinteln. He gave the country a church (1614) and a police ordinance (1615), some of which remained valid well into the 19th century. His funds, largely coming from the Schaumburg mines, were also sufficient for a greater loan, which he made available to Emperor Ferdinand II. In gratitude, Count Ernst was raised to the rank of prince in 1619.\n\nThe University of Rinteln was founded in 1621 with an imperial privilege. The equipment was initially sufficient for twelve professors and several tens of scholarships. After a promising start, it experienced a sudden collapse in 1622 due to the death of its founder and the turmoil of the Thirty Years' War. With usually around 150 students, it was one of the smaller universities; their spatial catchment area was limited to the nearer to farther surroundings of north-west Germany. On the whole, its reputation among academic institutions remained rather modest. So there was little protest when the University was abolished in 1810 and its estates incorporated into the University of Marburg; the archive was largely destroyed. The university building was demolished and the \"Ernestinum\" high school was built in its place.\n\nWhen Prince Ernst was buried in his mausoleum in Stadthagen on 21 March, 1622, troops of the Catholic League marched through the Weser Valley against the \"insane\" Duke Christian of Brunswick-Lüneburg; the Thirty Years' War had reached Schaumburg. Like all of Germany, the population suffered from billeting, blackmail and arson; plague and shortages did the rest. Time after time the Weser valley was used as a transit and deployment area. One of the few major battles took place on 8 July, 1633 at Hessisch Oldendorf; it ended victorious for the Protestant Union, but without having any significant influence on the further course of the war.\n\nSince Prince Ernst had died childless, the county was inherited by the Gemener line of the Counts' House of Schaumburg. Count Otto V. was participating in a war council of the Evangelical party in Hildesheim in 1640, when the attendees at a banquet were reportedly given poison. In any case, Count Otto V. died a few days after his return from Hildesheim on 15 November, 1640, and with him the last male Schauenburger. With his death, the \"Old County of Schaumburg\" came to an end. The inheritance was up for division: Otto's mother Elisabeth, daughter of Simon VI. to Lippe, transferred all rights to her brother Philipp. With foreign relations ceasing to exist, the county of Pinneberg and the lordship of Bergen were sold, the lordship of Gemen fell to the counts of Limburg, and the mortgaged county of Sternberg to Lippe. Several parties laid claim to the ancestral lands on the Weser: Brunswick-Lüneburg drew in the office of Lauenau, the bailiwick of Lachem, Mesmerode and Bokeloh, as well as Wiedensahl as a defunct fief; the landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel and the prince-bishopric of Minden also asserted feudal claims, and the Counts of Lippe asserted inheritance claims. In the end the old county of Schaumburg was divided into two equal halves: the counts of Lippe (Alverdissen collateral line) received the offices of Arensburg, Bückeburg, Stadthagen, Hagenburg and half of the office of Sachsenhagen; Hesse received the offices of Rodenberg and Schaumburg and the southern part of the office of Sachsenhagen. The University of Rinteln (until 1665), the Weser tolls (until 1734) and the mines (until the 20th century) remained in common possession. Minden, ruled by the Swedes, got nothing. In several contracts, this regulation was affirmed (1647 and in Article XV on 14/24 October, 1648) with the Westphalian peace treaty concluding the war between the Emperor and Sweden.\n\nLippian reign[]\n\nIf you want to learn more about the Hessian part of Schaumburg you can find more information here.\n\nThe county of Schaumburg continued to exist in the theory of imperial law. In practice, both parts of the country now went their separate ways. The Lippian part of Schaumburg was fortunate enough to produce some capable rulers who devoted themselves entirely to the well-being of their small country. Among the most important and famous of these is Count Wilhelm (r. 1748-1777), who was deemed worthy by King Ludwig I of Bavaria to be ranked among the great Germans in the Valhalla Gallery of Honour. Born in London, after a temporary stay in Geneva and studies in Leiden and Montpellier, he got the opportunity to travel to Italy while serving in the Austrian army. As a field marshal in the Brunswick-Lüneburgian/British service, he fought successfully in the Seven Years' War in the Battle of Minden in 1759 and secured the independence of Portugal against France and Spain in 1762. He built his own country according to the new military-theoretical concepts he had created himself so it could be defended in case of war, being amonst the first to introduce general conscription. The Wilhelmstein Fortress in the Steinhuder Meer as well as the war school that he set up in Wilhelmstein produced the Prussian army reformer Gerhard von Scharnhorst. He promoted agriculture and commerce in his country; established colonist villages, improved the school system and maintained a written exchange of ideas with people like Friedrich II of Prussia, Voltaire, Mendelssohn, Möser and Gleim. At his court he raised the polymath Johann Gottfried Herder (1771-1776 consistorial councilor in Bückeburg), the philosopher Thomas Abbt and the \"concert master\" Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach, the \"Bückeburger Bach\" (1750-1795 in Bückeburg). Contrary to family tradition, Wilhelm's grave, a pyramid with Masonic symbols, was built in the middle of the Schaumburg Forest.\n\nAfter the end of the Old Empire (1806), the small country experienced an increase in rank when its regent Georg Wilhelm assumed the title of prince on his own initiative in 1807: the county now became the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe, which claimed full sovereignty.\n\nAfter the devastating Napoleonic Wars, Prince Georg Wilhelm (r. 1807-1860) specifically promoted the country's economic development. The traffic connections were considerably simplified when the Dortmund - Minden - Hanover - Berlin railway line was opened in 1847 and Schaumburg-Lippe joined the Prussian customs area in 1854. Despite industrialization, agriculture remained an important factor. It was freed from bondage by the abolition of serfdom. All of this led to a surge in modernization like never before. The mining and glass industry in Obernkirchen in the Hessian district was influencial far into the Principality of Schaumburg-Lippe. With the establishment of the Georgschacht near Stadthagen, mining in Schaumburg peaked, which continued to flourish into the 20th century until it came to an abrupt end in 1961. In addition, the princely court and sovereign forests offered many jobs. The industrialization of the region was favored by the relatively high population density, the existing mineral resources (coal, sandstone) and the favorable traffic situation (railway, Weser, Mittelland Canal, motorway since the 1930s). So in Schaumburg - not evenly distributed, but with different focal points - there was a coexistence of agriculture, mining and glass industry, last but not least also small trades (basket weavers) and migrant work (clupeidae catching). Industrial towns based on the model of the Ruhr area or the neighboring Hanover (Linden) did not develop in Schaumburg; rather, the settlement structure in Schaumburg remained rural and small-town.\n\nThe claim and reality of the principality increasingly diverged in the course of the 19th century. Although Schaumburg-Lippe retained its self-dependence in 1866, it lagged behind general developments in the modernization process and had to accept help from Prussia wherever the small state was overwhelmed by modern administration. Post and judiciary, schools and medicine were gradually subordinated to Prussian supervisory authorities. After 1867 the military system had passed entirely to Prussia, the 7th Westphalian Rifle Battalion was transferred from Cleve to Bückeburg and Stadthagen; the Prince of Schaumburg-Lippe became the chief of the \"Bückeburger Jäger\". In the political discussion, from about 1840, Schaumburg-Lippe became more and more the proverbial object of ridicule against the outdated small state; it found its best-known expression in the \"Duodez\" by Hermann Löns, who was editor of the Schaumburg-Lippian Landeszeitung in Bückeburg from 1907 until his dismissal in 1909."
