Under his control the principality of WolfenbÃ¼ttel suffered its greatest loss of territory in history.Â Between 1616 and 1622 ruling authority was taken away from him by his widowed mother and her brother, king Christian IV. (1577-1648) of Denmark.\n\nFriedrich Ulrich was married to Anna Sophie, a daughter of the Elector of Brandenburg.Â This unhappy marriage remained without descendents.Â In 1623 his wife even hatched a murder plot against him.Â With the death of duke Friedrich Ulrich in 1634, the Middle House of Brunswick was extinguished.Â The successor became duke August the Younger (1579-1666) of the Dannenberg line.Â With the beginning of his rule in WolfenbÃ¼ttel, Duke August became the founder of the New House of Brunswick.\n\n--Adapted from the website, Die Welfen\n\nSources\n\nEckart, Rudolf.
