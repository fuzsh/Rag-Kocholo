        "text": "Heinrich Julius; (October 15, 1564 – July 30, 1613), a member of the House of Welf, was Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and ruling Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel from 1589 until his death. He also served as administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt from 1566 and of the Prince-Bishopric of Minden between 1582 and 1585.\n\nEarly Life\n\nHeinrich Julius was born in Hessen am Fallstein as the eldest son of Duke Julius of Brunswick-Lüneburg (1528–1589) and his wife Hedwig of Brandenburg (1540–1602). Hedwig, a member of the House of Hohenzollern, was a younger daughter of Elector Joachim II Hector of Brandenburg (1505–1571) from his second marriage with Hedwig Jagiellon (1513–1573), a daughter of King Sigismund I of Poland and his first wife, Hungarian Countess Barbara Zápolya, sister of the later King John I of Hungary.\n\nAt the time of his birth Heinrich Julius the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel was still under the rule of his grandfather Duke Heinrich V. Already in 1566, at the age of two, he was elected Lutheran administrator of the Halberstadt bishopric by the cathedral chapter; however, a condition of his election was an agreement that the cathedral chapter would lead the prince-bishopric under its own authority until Henry Julius reached the age of 14.\n\nHis father implemented the Protestant Reformation in the Wolfenbüttel lands upon his accession in 1568. In 1576 he appointed Heinrich Julius first rector of the newly established Protestant University of Helmstedt. Even though he was only twelve years old, Heinrich Julius participated in theological debates among the faculty that were held in Latin.\n\nAfter finishing his study in law, he was employed by his father as a court judge. When he came of age, he was rated one of the most educated princes of his time.\n\nCareer\n\nHeinrich Julius took over administration of the Halbertstadt Prince-Bishopric in 1578, he became active as a temporal as well as spiritual ruler. He improved general education in the episcopal lands, and completed the implementation of the Protestant Reformation begun by his father, although he allowed Catholic office holders to keep their privileges — except that he strictly prohibited priests from having mistresses.\n\nIn view of his moderate policies, he also was offered the position of an administrator of the Minden prince-bishopric and was elected by the cathedral chapter in 1582. Nevertheless, expectations were disappointed, when Heinrich Julius ordered that all sermons ought to be preached according to the Augsburg Confession. When he resigned from office three years later, to marry the Wettin Princess Dorothea of Saxony, he left a virtual Lutheran diocese.\n\nHenry married first Dorothea of Saxony (October 4, 1563 – February 13, 1587) on September 26, 1585. Dorothea was the daughter of Elector August of Saxony (1526–1586) and his wife Anna of Denmark (1532–1585), daughter of King Christian III of Denmark and his wife Dorothea of Saxe-Lauenburg.\n\nDorothea died giving birth to their only child, Princess\n\nDorothea Hedwig of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (13 February 13, 1587 – October 16, 1609). She married Rudolph, Prince of Anhalt-Zerbst and died in childbirth like her mother before her.\n\nIn 1589, when Heinrich Julius succeeded his father as ruler of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, he replaced Saxon by Roman Law, and instead of local nobles, lawyers with academic degrees now served as judges. He was also versed in architecture and began to rebuild his Wolfenbüttel residence in a lavish Weser Renaissance style, including the construction of the Protestant Beatae Mariae Virginis main church which started in 1608.\n\nOn April 19, 1590 Heinrich Julius married as his second wife Elizabeth of Denmark (August 25, 1573 – June 19, 1626), daughter of King Frederik II of Denmark . They had ten children together including his eldest son and successor: Friedrich Ulrich, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg (April 5, 1591 – August 11, 1634). Friedrich Ulrich was also the reigning Prince of Wolfenbüttel from 1613 until his death.\n\nHe also had had extended barracks, walls and fortifications laid out around the city. He invited Hans Vredeman de Vries to develop ramparts and had a canal built through a swampland between Hornburg and Oschersleben. One of the most important buildings erected under his rule was the Juleum Novum, the main lecture hall of the Helmstedt university.\n\nHowever, he lost control of the state’s finances and amassed large amounts of public debt. When the rights of the nobles were reduced, the local nobles sued Heinrich Julius at the Reichskammergericht (Imperial Court) in Speyer. A compromise was struck in 1601.\n\nPolitics\n\nThough a Protestant Prince, Heinrich Julius became a close advisor to the Habsburg Emperor Rudolph II. From 1600 onwards he stayed at the Emperor’s court at Prague Castle several times. He gained Rudolph’s confidence, and was named Geheimrat and his “chief director” in 1607.\n\nThis position gave him much influence in Imperial affairs. He also managed to resolve the conflict between Rudolph and his brother, Matthias and assisted in temporarily resolving the differences between Catholic and Protestant estates in the Kingdom of Bohemia.\n\nA serious conflict occurred between Heinrich Julius and the Brunswick citizens, when they refused to recognize his overlordship. Heinrich Julius was not willing to confirm the city’s traditional privileges and had mercenary (Landsknecht) troops deployed, leading to a civil war in 1605.\n\nAttempts by King Christian IV of Denmark to mediate failed and in 1606, Emperor Rudolph II banned the city. In 1607, Heinrich Julius again went to the Emperor’s court, in order to negotiate the details of the ban. In return, he was given the emperor’s full support in dealing with the Brunswick insurgents. Nevertheless, all attacks on the city failed.\n\nUnder the rule of Heinrich Julius, the persecution of Jews and witches reached a historic peak. Early in his career he expelled the Jews from his state. He was also a committed burner of witches; one contemporary chronicler wrote that Lechelnholze Square looked like a little forest, so crowded were the stakes.\n\nThe duke was a dedicated follower of theatre and acting. In the years 1593 and 1594, he wrote eleven plays, in which he wrote about the moral duty of princes to burn witches. He invited Robert Browne, Thomas Sackville and their theatre company, who staged a shortened version of his “Susanna” for several years.\n\nHis other plays, five comedies, four tragedies, were not very successful; however, one was a basis for the tall tales of Baron Munchausen. Duke Heinrich Julius also invited John Dowland to come and see Michael Praetorius, his Kapellmeister, playing on the famous Gröningen organ.\n\nWhen Emperor Rudolph II died in 1612, Duke Heinrich Julius returned to the Prague court to consult his successor, Matthias. On July 20, 1613 he died in Prague, possibly of alcohol abuse. He was buried in the Marienkirche at Wolfenbüttel.\n\nRoyals are known for living lives of wealth and privilege and that is true. However, that wealth and privilege doesn’t shield one from hardship and tragedy. In this series I will examine the hardships of the family of Charles Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, his wife, Princess Augusta of Great Britain and their children.\n\nCharles Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nCharles Wilhelm Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg, Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (October 9, 1735 – November 10, 1806) was the Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg and a military leader. His titles are usually shortened to Duke of Brunswick in English-language sources.\n\nHe was the first-born son of Charles I, Duke of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and his wife Philippine Charlotte of Prussia. His father was the ruling prince (German: Fürst) of the small state of Brunswick-Lüneburg, one of the imperial states of the Holy Roman Empire. Philippine Charlotte was the favourite daughter of King Friedrich Wilhelm I of Prussia and sister of Friedrich II of Prussia. As the heir apparent of a sovereign prince, Charles Wilhelm Ferdinand received the title of Hereditary Prince. (Although known by the cumbersome triple name Charles Wilhelm Ferdinand , for the rest of this blog entry I’ll refer to him simply as Charles).\n\nThe royal houses of the former Duchy of Brunswick-Lüneburg had traditionally married within the family, to avoid further division of their family lands under Salic law. By the time, Brunswick-Lüneburg had consolidated back into two states, Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel and the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg (Hanover).\n\nThe electorate was ruled by the Hanoverian branch of the family in personal union with the Kingdom of Great Britain. It was therefore arranged for Charles to marry a British-Hanoverian princess: Princess Augusta of Great Britain, daughter of Frederick Louis, Prince of Wales and his wife, Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha, and sister of the reigning King George III. Augusta was given a careful education. She was not described as a beauty, having protuberant eyes, loose mouth and a long face.\n\nOn January 16, 1764, Charles married Princess Augusta of Great Britain, eldest sister of King George III. The couple were second cousins to each other, being great-grandchildren of George I of Great Britain, Elector of Hanover. As such, they were not related in a particularly close degree, yet there had been many bonds of marriage between the House of Brunswick-Bevern and the House of Hanover, themselves both branches of the House of Guelph.\n\nAugusta of Great Britain\n\nAugusta never fully adapted to life in Brunswick due to her British patriotism and disregard of all things “east of the Rhine”. This attitude did not change with time, and twenty five years after her marriage, she was described as: “wholly English in her tastes, her principles and her manners, to the point that her almost cynical independence makes, with the etiquette of the German courts, the most singular contrast I know”.\n\nIn 1777, Augusta announced to Charles that she would retire from court life and devote herself to the upbringing of her children and religious studies under the Bishop of Fürstenberg. The reason was her disapproval of the relationship between Charles and Louise Hertefeld whom he, in contrast to his previous mistress Maria Antonia Branconi, had installed as his official royal mistress at the Brunswick court.\n\nAugusta of Great Britain\n\nIn 1780, Charles succeeded his father as sovereign prince of the Principality of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, one of the princely states of the Holy Roman Empire. The duke was a cultured and benevolent despot in the model of Friedrich II the Great of Prussia. He was also a recognized master of 18th century warfare, serving as a Field Marshal in the Prussian Army.\n\nIn 1806, when Prussia declared war on France, her husband, the Prince of Brunswick-Wolfenbuttel, 71 at the time, was appointed commander-in-chief of the Prussian army. On October 14, of that year, at the Battle of Jena, Napoleon defeated the Prussian army; and on the same day, at the Battle of Auerstadt, he was struck by a musket ball and lost both of his eyes; his second-in-command Friedrich Wilhelm Carl von Schmettau was also mortally wounded, causing a breakdown in the Prussian command.\n\nSeverely wounded, the Duke was carried with his forces before the advancing French. Augusta, with the Hereditary Prince and Hereditary Princess, fled to Altona, where they were present at her dying spouse’s side. Because of the advancing French army, they were advised by the British ambassador to flee, and they left shortly before the death of the Prince. He died of his wounds in Ottensen on November 10, 1806.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg\n\nAugusta then went to stay at the Duchy of Augustenborg, where her nephew-in-law was sovereign. She remained there with her niece, the Duchess of Augustenborg (daughter of her sister the late Queen Caroline Mathilde of Denmark), until her brother George III of the United Kingdom finally relented in September 1807, and allowed Augusta to come to London. There she resided at Montagu House, at Blackheath in Greenwich, with her daughter, Caroline the Princess of Wales, but soon Augusta fell out with her, and purchased the house next door, Brunswick House. Augusta lived out her days there and died in 1813 aged 75.\n\nPart II will be a discussion about their children."
