The Head of the House and his spouse bear the stle of Highness (HH).\n\nThe Zollern are among the oldest and most important Swabian noble families. The county Zollern was the ancestral homeland of the Hohenzollern's. The name was for many centuries Zollern. In the middle of the 14th Century, the Hohenzollern family name was first detectable written. In medieval writings spelling was Hohenzolr Hohenzolre respectively. The composite name was from 16 Century used consistently.Zollern could be derived from Söller which means as much as height and rfers to the 855-meter high cone-shaped mountain castlehill near Hechingen, on which the ancestral Hohenzollern Castle is located. On a seal of 1246, the name is also written once Solre; Söller means mountain height. In the first known source of 1061 \"de Zolorin\" (Zollern) was formulated. Another and less favored interpretation is that the name has to do with Customs in terms of output and acted at once to the nobles inch counts. The Hohenzollern Castle is today collectively owned by the Brandenburg-Prussian line and Swabian line. The lines maintain close contact and view themselves as a family.The monk Berthold of Reichenau wrote in his 1061 chronicle of two killed whilst nobleman named Burchardus Wezil et de Zolorin. The wording means the nobles came from the castle .. Zoller To determine the ancestors and relatives of those named relationship to each other, it is not possible for historians. Documents about family members are from the end of the 11th Century ago. Adelbert von Zollern founded in 1095 on his estate the convent Alpirsbach. Frederick I of Zollern called Maute, where he worked first as a bailiff. Many old scholars have come far declining inaccurate theories with large inertia in the study of the origin of Hohenzollern in the past.\n\nFriedrich I((† before 1125), called Maute, lobbied for Emperor Heinrich V. of the family ofaSalian. The Hohenzollernswereperceivedat theimperial level. The Countremained atthe court of theregentand took part intheaffairs of governmentEmpirewith. Friedrich Iwas also activein the Investiture Controversyof Heinrich V., theHohenzollernwasin1111in the wakeof thecoronationof Heinrich V.at this timePaschal IIwas the Pope.\n\nDuring the reignof Friedrich I, the countyconsisted ofthe areas around thecastlesZollernHohenberg,HaigerlochSchalksburgandRotenburg. Thesub-regionswere unitedin one hand andterritoriallyseparated. After the death ofMaute his sonFriedrich II. receivedthe castlesZollernSchalksburgand a castlenot far fromMülheim. The other sonBurkhard,henceforthCountofZollernHohenberg, inherited the castleHohenberg,HaigerlochandRotenburg. Founded byBurkhard this line became extinct in 1486This branchis often consideredas a separategenderwith thenoblename ofHohenberg.The lineof the elder brotherenduresto this dayandishistorically significant.\n\nCount Friedrich III of Zollern was a loyal retainer of the Holy Roman Emperors Friedrich Barbarossa and Heinrich VI, and around 1185 he married Sophia of Raabs, the daughter of Conrad II, Burgrave of Nuremberg. After the death of Conrad II, often referred to as Kurt II who left no male heirs, Friedrich III was granted the burgraviate of Nuremberg in 1192 as Burgrave Friedrich I of Nuremberg-Zollern. Since then the family name has been Hohenzollern.\n\nAfter the death of Friedrich III./I. his his sons partitioned the family lands between themselves\n\nAncestor of the swabian line is Friedrich IV. Count of Zollern. After the death of Friedrich III./I. Count of Zollern, Burgrave of Nuremberg his his sons partitioned the family lands between themselves\n\nThe younger brother, Friedrich IV, received the county of Zollern and burgraviate of Nuremberg in 1200 from his father, thereby founding the Swabian branch of the House of Hohenzollerns. The Swabian line remained Catholic\n\nThe older brother, Conrad III, received the burgraviate of Nuremberg from his older brother Friedrich IV in 1218, thereby founding the Franconian branch of the House of Hohenzollern. The Franconian line later converted to Protestantism\n\nAfter Count Friedrich II. of Zollern (Burgrave Friedrich IV. of Nuremberg) gave the Burggraviate of Nuremberg to his older brother Conrad in 1218 he took over the ancestral territories in Swabia and became as Count Friedrich IV. the fpunder of the swabian line. After his death in 1255 he was succeeded by hos oldest son Count Friedrich V. Friedrich V. earnedtheadvocacy ofthemonastery Beuronin 1259andwasthe founderofthemonasteryStettenin the Gnadental. The Foundation wasexpandedin 1267with hiswifeagain. In the same yearthe monasteryStettenwasalsointended to became the anecestral burial site of the family. Thegravelaywas probablyconnectedby an underground passagewith theHohenzollern Castle.According to legend,Friedrichis said to have foundedthe monastery tovote the the Emperor Friedrich II. conciliatory becausehe had failedhismilitary service. [With the related swabian Counts of Hohenberg Friedrich V. wasinconstant conflict which where only resolved in 1286 through mediationby KingRudolf of Habsburg. Thedisputewith the chiefsalvorshad a longpast,particularlyin 1267, the situation escalated. Thepossessions of theSwabianHohenzollersnformed afairlyclosedterritory.

The older brother Friedrich VI. got Hohenzollern Castle and the territories around it.His oldest son and successor Friedrich VII. was married to Euphemia of Hohenberg, daughter of Count Albrecht II. of Hhóehnberg which ended the rivalry between the 2 families. After his death in 1309 his younger rother Friedrich VIII. (called Ostertag) appeared as Count and after the death of his nephew Fritzli in 1313 he alone ruled Zollern. At the divison of the country with his brother he had founded the Hohenzollern line. In 1339 Friedrich IX. followed his odler brother Fritzli II. as Count of Hohenzollern. He made for Zollern-Zollern on 27.07.1342a contract with the line Schalksburg.Here itwasdetermined thatthe elderof the twolinesZollern-ZollernandZollern-Schalksburgshoulddecide on the allocationofzollerischenmanfiefdom.

In 1344he sharedwith his youngerbrother Friedrich, calledthe Strasbourg, the country and founded theBlackCount'sline. Theline died already outin 1412with Friedrich X. The younger brother Friedrich the Straßbourg was the founder of the more important Straßbourg line.

After the death of his childless brother-in-law count Johann of Fürstenberg-Haslach (the brother of his wife Adelheid) in the Battleof Sempach the House of Hohenzollernacquiredfrom itsheritage Bräunlingen. Withthe main line of Fürstenberg hewasthereforestillina long dispute.\n\nAfter the deatrh of Count Friedrich XI. the country was in 1402 divided between his sons Fredrich X II. called the Öttinger and Eitel Friedrich I. Theancestral castleof the family Hohenzollern Castle, the city Hechingenand a millremained incommonownership. The brotherslived inpermanentinheritance disputes. Friedrich'seconomicsituationwas tense. Salesof areasto the Countsof Württembergcouldnot establishthe financial equilibrium. The houseWürttembergwas thelargest competitorfor power,andit was necessaryto preservethezollernsche independence .Dealing withEitelFriedrich I about Hohenzollern Castle escalated when Friedrich overlaid the imperial citiy ofRottweil withfeud.Thusin 1422thecities of theSwabianCities alliated withEitelFriedrich I. and the Countof Württemberg. Friedrich had tocapitulatein 1423after a ten-month-long siege of thecastle byZollerhis opponents.

From 1429 his brother Eitel Friedrich reigned. Large partsof the property had been sold by FriedrichXII. to theCountof Württemberg,themain rivalstothezollernscheindependence.So itwasmainlytoavoid the conflictwith thesecounts andto consolidate thecountry'sdominationinside.For this purpose,asuccession agreementwasconcludedin 1429with the houseWuerttemberg.Thisthing, howeverrisky,because iftheSwabianHohenzollernextinctin the male line, the countywould fallto theWürttemberg.

Under Prince Eugene, he fought in theAustrianVenetian-Turkish War(1714-1718)andrebelagainstHungary. After the took over the goverment of the principality after the death of his father he was tied to the region, and his enthusiasmfor huntingcaused the construction of ahunting lodge and summerpalace, despite an awkwardfinancial position. From 1739 to 1741out ofthreekilometers westof Hechingen, thearchitecturally outstanding.castleLindich was build. After it's after its completion it aklso became the princely summer residence. Alsothe hunting lodgeFriedrichstalsoutheastofBoll was build. Thisfinancial burdentookthe pressure onthe population andclashes with thesubjectsintensified. Fürst Friedrich Ludwigdied in 1750 unmarried andwithout issueat CastleLindich. His successor was his cousin Josef Freidrich Wilhelm, whose father Hermann Freidrich was the second son of Fürst Philipp. Fürst Josef Friedrich Wilhelm was a friend of representation of court life, hunting and traveling. On 25.06.1750, he married the rich Spanish heiress Maria Theresa of Folch Cardona and Sylva, Countess of Castelnuovo and Villalva del Alcor. The later Hechinger Rabbi Dr. Samuel Mayer wrote in 1844 in his book, the young princess had then demanded as a condition of marriage, the expulsion of all Jews from the Principality. The Jews are - to come before the expulsion - have already made arrangements before the news arrived, was the Princess 25 September drowned in Vienna. Later, he is said to have proved against Protestants and Jews as tolerant. An example of this is that in the same year he took over the sponsorship of a baptized in the name of Joseph Wilhelm Jews. On 07.02.1751 Fürst Josef Friedrich Wilhelm married again. This time with Princess Maria Theresa of Waldburg-Zeil-Zurzack. In May, the princely couple undertook a pilgrimage to Einsiedeln. In the first years of his reign, he took up the wine publishing, so \"like to get an honest drink wine with cheap price our subjects.\" In addition, he built a allee from castle Lindich to the Martin's Hill and built the stables south of the Friedrichsburg. In 1764, during a stay in Wildbad, the Fürst made the acquaintance of an army staff captain who was discharged after the war from the Prussian Army. The officer to whom he offered a Hofcharge, was Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben (1730-1794), who spent the next twelve years as a marshal in the immediate vicinity of Josef Friedrich Wilhelm before he at George Washington's side as Inspector General of the U.S. Army and organizer of a successful role played in the American War of Independence. He promoted the agricultural economy in the country, renewed derelict farm buildings and wasteland who converted to new cropland. From 1766 Josef Friedrich Wilhelm sought the introduction of potato cultivation. In 1768 he released the convicted to life imprisonment Count Oswald von Hohenzollern-Berg, who was proprietor of a rule in the Netherlands, on probation to freedom. One of the requirements was one that he would not leave his newly assigned residence Haigerloch. In the same year he submitted a second Tiergarten district across to between Rangendingen Grosselfingen, Owingen and Lindich Castle. Steuben was one of the party, when the prince concocted his adventurous projects in order to get money or to save money. This included, among other things, in 1772 the idea of ​​dissolving the royal household for reasons of economy and incognito to go with the Fürstin, accompanied by Steuben traveling. In Strasbourg, Montpellier and Lyon has taken longer stay. In societies with Diners, at the table, in the comedy, the Carnival and on the hunt Josef Wilhelm brought by his time and his money. It took three full years to this unsettled life before the Fürstin succeeded with the help of Steuben to move the Fürst to end the masquerade. In later years the Fürst did well in the role of an enlightened country's father, presented to model farms, introduced compulsory education, founded in 1775, a school, a grammar school in the Old Castle and decreed against the continued resistance of the population, the reduction of church holidays. His wife founded a hospital. His need for representation that the new collegiate church in Hechingen their formation. 1764 she joined the then resident in Strasbourg famous French architect Pierre Michel d'Ixnard, the future builders of the Collegiate Church, as Planning Director in royal service. Although the Fürst was trying to appear nationwide fatherly and jovial, he remained adamant in subjects conflict and suspicion against the government of his successor intermediary course. On 09.04 1798 Fürst Josef Friedrich Wilhelm died after 48 years in power. Since he left no male heirs, the government passed to his nephew, Hermann. Fürst Hermann was familiar with the situation in the country when he came to power. He was raised in Belgium, where his father was an imperial officer. From his his mother, the Countess Anna Maria of Hoensbroech-Geulle, Fürst Hermann inherited her dutch possessions from his second wife the dutch Princess of Gavre, Marquise d'Aysseau he had inherited a million francs. His first wife, Countess Louise de Merode, Marquess of Westerlo, he had lost after just one year of marriage, and was since 1779 married to Countess Maria Antonia of Waldburg-Zeil-Wurzach. He tried, after the assignment of the left bank of the Rhine to France, to be considered in the compensation negotiations. Fürst Hermann eventually received from the Imperial Deputation Committee to replace the lost belgian possessions of his mother the rule Hirschlatt in Tettnang and the monastery Gnadenthal in Stetten. He used money for the beautification of Hechingen and the improvement of rural roads. All his activities were aimed outward, to improve the fortunes of his house. Fürst Hermann was Empire Marshal Lieutenant and Prussian lieutenant general. As difficult as presented itself to the external situation of the Principality in the period between the Congress of Rastatt and the end of the Empire, so relaxing is the cost of the Fürst inside. Immediately after his accession he took on the peace negotiations with the villages, concluded on the basis of the comparison city from 1795 on 26 June Hechingen the country comparison and dismissed on that day ..... today's gratifying tribute celebrations from our own free motion all subjects of bondage, but of which grace the village Bisingen because it is not a party to the comparison, did not appear even when the homage excluded was (since the Bisinger are nicknamed \"Nichthuldiger\"). The Fürst limited his hunting three animal parks, there could be shot outside of town shooters unlimited hunting and Hagfronen were transformed into \"measured\" or money. Serfdom was abolished as a legal function that loads arising from them remained. The main event was set at five percent of the estate. The subjects were given the right to determine in a general election twelve deputies, which had the right to control the taxes and make suggestions opposition. The Jews gave the Fürst , on the advice of his court factor Jacob Kaulla (see also Caroline Kaulla) \"for appropriate Remuneration to the exchequer,\" a new letter of protection to 40 years. The Fürst succeeded as the settlement of the conflict subjects within a few weeks. Fürst Hermann was not generally a man of compromise, he was a rather bizarre personality by nature suspicious, petty, and he took care of extremely pedantic about the details of the administration. He loved the time according to taste, the seclusion in nature, preferably in the hunting lodge Friedrichstal. He was always busy, vigilanter patriarch, under which the small princely absolutism reached a final climax. The Act of Confederation saved the independent existence of the Hechinger Fürst, but there was no increase, neither ownership nor rights of sovereignty bestowed. He felt this was blatant discrimination and its reset, the elder line of the house. Greatly afflicted by the humiliation of Prussia and AustriaFürst Hermann died on 02.11.1810. His scucessor became his son Friedrich. Already as hereditary Prince Friedrich le many difficult diplomatic negotations for the Principality. So hereachedin 1800 with the Emperor in Vienna,that the also the hereditary prince and his decendatns should be entitlted to the rank of Imperial Prince.

Fürst Konstantin had married in 1826 Eugenie de Beauharnis, Princess of Leuchtenberg but the marriage remained without Issue. After he death in 1850 he mad in 1850 a second morgantic marriage Barnoess Amelie Schenk of Geyern who was created Countess of Rothebeurg by the King of Prussia. From his second marriage he had several children. Fürst Konstantin died on 03.09.1869. As hisson from his second marriage was notentitled to inherit the pricnely line of Hohenzollern-Hechingen became with Konstantin's death, extinct in the male line andwassucceeded byHohenzollern-Sigmaringen\n\nThe County from 1623 Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen\n\nIn the partition of 1576 the second son of Karl I., Karl II.received the county Sigmaringen with the monasteries Hedingen and Veringen and the county Veringen. Hohenzollernhad to payLehnslastenofAustriaand the Holy RomanEmpire, on the other handhadhighZollernHechingennottocarry suchloads.This wastaken into account inthedivision of the inheritance.A judgment of theImperial Supreme Courtfrom 1588notedthe countySigmaringenwasan imperial fief. However, thisassessmentwasuntil 1806called into question. As his residence Count Karl II. choose Sigmaringen as residence and rebuild Sigmarignen Castle. Between 1576and 1606he had thevaulting ofthe castleentrancebuildand orderedthe construction of thechurch nexttothe castle.In 1589he acquired the CastleRatzenhofenin Sigmaringenvillage.In 1595 hebought thetownKrauchenwiessince then was closely connectedwith the county Sigmaringen. Count Karl II. died in 1605 and was succeeded by his oldest son Johann from his first marriage to Countess Euphrosine of Oettingen-Wallerstein. Count Johann had studied atthe universities of Freiburgand IngolstadIn Ingolstadt,hebecame friends withMaximilian I ofBavaria.He also became ​​friends with thefuture Emperor Ferdinand II . Unlike the Electorate of Brandenburg, Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen had remained catholic, but were in the immediate vicinity of the Protestant Duchy of Württemberg and were thus in a prominent place in the escalating dispute denomination. Johann is therefore closely tied to the Duchy of Bavaria, the leader of the Catholic League. He also worked on administrative reform in Bavaria in Munich. Count Johann was a member of the secret Council and later its president. He also tried to positively influence the attitudes of the Pope and Emperor against Bavaria. Good in these efforts was, that his brother Eitel Friedrich represented Catholic League and the German bishops in Rome. The alliance with the Duke Maximilian I of Bavaria and Emperor Ferdinand II paid off. 1623 after Bavaria was raised from Duchy to an Electorate also Johann was rewarded with a higher rank: The Reichstag in Regensburg approved in 1623 the raise of Count Johann to an Heriditary Prince. Similarly, Count Johann Georg of Hohenzollern-Hechingen, his cousin from the line founded by Eitel Friedrich IV was raised to Fürst of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. With the extinction of the line of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch their territory in 1634 came under the rule of Johann. His brother Ernst Johann Georg was set off financially because of these alleged, among other things, claims to Krauchenwies. The excellent financial position of his country allowed John to make church and monasteries significant monetary donations as well as to expand the residential palace in Sigmaringen. A change brought the events of the Thirty Years War. Fürst Johann accompanied the Emperor Maximilian I. in Regensburg in 1630, which aimed at the military command of the imperial army there. Ravages of war also took place in Sigmaringen, whose castle was captured by the Swedes in 1632 and freed from the Imperial again in the following year, however, came up in the fighting in flames. Together with Maximilian of Bavaria, he fled as his receding President before the chaos of war to Braunau am Inn. After the withdrawal of the services Maximilian Johann received from him the rule Schwabegg. John himself lived in Bavaria, where he then died at the age of 60 years, in 1638, four years after his wife. Shortly before, he had been included in the College of the Imperial Princes (Reichsfürstenkollegium), which meant the elevation of the land to an Imperial Principality. Primogeniture in the male line was set. His successor was his only son Meinrad I. who took over a country that was Bledand devastatedby war. 1646werethe French underHenride Turenneand the Swedesunder CarlGustavWrangelin Swabia andBavariaa.

His oldest son Maximilian had been named after Maximilian I. of Bavaria. he had together with his brother served in imperial austrian where he took part in the 4. austrian Turk War. In 1681 he beame after the death of his father ruler of a smaller Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen and because his brother Franz Anton got Haigerloch he ruled over a country which was as big as the former county Sigmaringen. In 1666 he had married Maria Clara of Berg 'sHeerenberg, daughter of Count Albert. After the death of her brother Count Oswald III. in 1702 she inherited the counts s'Heerenberg. To the inheritance belonge the dominionsBoxmeer,Bergh,DiksmuideGendringen, Etten, Wisch, Pannerden and Millingen. Fürst Maximilian died in 1689 and was succeeded by his son meinrad II. who was still a minor and was initially under the guaerdianship of his mother and his uncle Count Franz Anton of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch. Meinrad II. studied 1678-1679 at the University of Ingolstadt and struck like his father, a military career in the Imperial Austrian Service. In 1683 he fought in the Battle of Kahlenberg at the Second Siege of Vienna, the Hungarian Revolution in 1697 the Nine Years War and the war against France. The latter war was significant because of the location of the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen also out of personal interest. Meinrad served in the War of Spanish Succession in 1702 in the Netherlands. Then followed, among other missions in Bavaria in 1703 and 1704 in Hungary. The children of princes lived at that time in Sigmaringen. Since the French penetrated to Swabia, the children were taken for safety reasons to Vienna and returned to Sigmaringen after the peace treaty of Rastatt in 1714 again.In 1692, Emperor Leopold I increased the princely rank of the Swabian Hohenzollern on primogeniture out. In other words, the first ceremony, lordship was bound only by the law of primogeniture, respectively direct successor. The Prince graduated in 1695 with the electoral House of Brandenburg the Hohenzollern-Brandenburg inheritance contract. Thereafter, the country should fall to Brandenburg in the case of extinction of the Swabian line. The agreement also was agreed by Emperor Leopold I..In 1702 his uncle Count Franz Anton of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch fell at the Battle of Friedlingen so the Haigerlocher area fell to Meinrad II. In 1708 he built the iron melt in Laucherthal Meinrad, the present company based in Sigmaringen.

Shortly beforehis accessionJosephhad enteredAustrian militaryservice, wherehe achievedthe rankof general ofcavalry, andfinallythe position of theGeneral field Marshall lieutnantof the SwabianCircle.Under JosephHohenhuollern-Sigmaringen again became closer to the Electotate of Bavaria andafter the electionof Karl VII: he apponted Joseph as his Privy Councesllor. Joseph wasan avidhunterand in 1727he led create thewildlife parkJosefslustatSigmaringen.In 1736,he modernizedtheSigmaringen Castleand rebuild it. He also cnahged the Ridder Hall there to the ancestral hall. The so-calledPrinceJoseph's buildingis reminiscent ofthat time.Joseph wasknown asArt patron. Hebuilt theparish church of St.Johann,the Joseph's Chapel, the hunting lodgeinJosefslustandin Haigerloch,whichhe preferredto his residence inSigmaringen, theChurch of St. Anne. Fürst Joseph ran thecanonizationof FatherFidelisof Sigmaringenand is regarded aspromoters ofschool and churchbeing.

France received from Germany the territories on the left bank of the Rhine. So in 1802 Anton Aloys lost all his dutch possessions. He received as compensation rule Glatt in the northern Black Forest and the secularized monasteries Inzigkofen, Beuron and Lumber. In 1806 Fürst Anton Aloys under the guarantee of complete sovereignty over its land he joined the Confederation of the Rhine. Politics in southern Germany was determined by the French. But the ratio of Napoleon Bonaparte proved profitable for the Swabian Hohenzollern, although they had to accept the hegemony of Napoleon. There were some matrimonial alliances of his family with the imperial France. Anton Aloys received from Napoleon the reigns oh Achberg and Hohenfels and full sovereignty over all knights economic areas of the country. At the Congress of Vienna, where Anton Aloys participated in 1814, its sovereignty was recognized, and he also received his earlier possessions in Bavaria and the Netherlands back for his house. In 1815, the principality became a member of the German Confederation. Overall, Anton Aloys always had a rather provincial view. His grandson Karl Anton of Hohenzollern described this by saying that the Fürst\"did not overlook a vast horizon\". Under Anton Aloys was 1815-1817 the so-called \"fruit box\" of the castle Sigmaringen rebuild to the Cavllierssbulding the, the so-called \"Wilhelmsbau\". He had in 1781 married Princess Amalie Zephyrine zu Salm-Kyrburg (her brother Fürst Friedrich III. zu Salm-Kyrburg was married to Anton Aloys sister, Princess Johanna Franziska).

This marriage had been arranged by his mother. The not equal marriage was signed in a contract by the prussian House to legitimize the children and their noble claims.

He had originally intended to dispense entirely with the sovereignty of the country. To this end, he negotiated with the Provisional Central Power in Frankfurt. These negotiations led to no results.In the Principality itself, the revolutionary movement radicalized. It came to battle with the estates to the royal domains. These conflicts forced Karl Anton to temporarily leave the Principality. Of the counter-revolution in the summer of 1849 the country was occupied by Prussian troops. Karl Anton stepped on 07.12.1849 into a treaty with the Principality of compensation to the Prussian crown. After his abdication as sovereign in favor of Prussia, Karl Anton became division commander in Dusseldorf. He and his family resided there in Jägerhof castle. At the beginning of the Crimean War, he was sent as an envoy to Paris. He should prevent an anti-Russian coalition of France and Britain. Politically Karl Anton moderate liberalism of the weekly party close. He also had good relations to Prince Wilhelm. After he had assumed the regency, Karl Anton was appointed in 1858 to Prussian prime minister. This office he held until 1862. He was thus head of government in the time of the New Era. Inside, he attempted to carry out a liberal point of these reforms. In appearance it was aimed at unification of the German states. In particular, the European crisis as a result of the war in Italy was Germany's political plans fail. Domestically, there was initially a collaboration with liberalism, which provided the majority of the Prussian House of Representatives. However, the conflict led to the military structure for military conflict. Karl Anton supported the plan of Albrecht von Roon, but pleaded for a greater opening up next to the officer's career also for commoners. The federal election of 1861 ended with the victory of the Progressive Party, which ruled the military refused plans. So lost in the chamber Karl Anton political support. Within the Cabinet he had difficulty to maintain itself by Roon between the liberal members around August von der Heydt and the Conservatives. On 12 March 1862 his time as Prime Minister ended. In 1866, his son Charles was elected as Prince of Romania. After the death of Fürst Konstantin of Hohenzollern-Hechingen on 03.09.1869 Karl Anton without legitmate male Issue this line of the House became ectinct and the Sigmaringen branch was now the only line of the older line of the House of Hohenzollern.\n\nThe county of Hohenzollern-Haigerloch\n\nThe third son of Karl I., Christoph got in the partiction of 1576 the county Haigerloch. His countyat that timeconsisted of10,000inhabitantsand wasmuch smallerthan that of Christoph's brothers. Christophwasthe progenitor of theHaigerlocherline who became extinctin 1634with his youngersonagain. In 1577 he marriedinSigmaringenCatherine, daughter ofChristophBaronsofWelsperg.

As his marriage to Countess Rosamunde of Ortenberg weas childless, he died without leaving heirs, and the line Hohenzollern-Haigerloch became extinct. According to the inheritance contract of 1575 Hohenzollern-Haigerloch fell now to the Principality of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen.\n\nPrincipality of Hohenzollern\n\nAfter the line of Hohenzollern-hechingen had become extinct after the death of Fürst Konstantin of Hohenzollern-Hchingen on 03.09.1869 Fürst Karl Anton of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen dropped the Sigmaringen part of his title and became now the Fürst of Hohenzollerbn. In February 1870 his other son Leopold was offered the Spanish throne. Karl Anton was forced by Otto von Bismarck to accept the offer. Only after a hesitation, he went out. Given the relationship with the French houses Murat and Bonaparte seemed to him an approval by Napoleon III. to be possible. As a European crisis threatened to ignite the candidacy, Karl Anton pulled the nomination on back on 12.07.1870. This step was not sufficient to the Franco-German War of 1870/71 to prevent, for only a day later it came to the Ems telegram. During the war, Karl Anton held no front command but practiced with the rank of Commanding General of the position of Militärgouveneurs for the Rhine Province and the province of Westphalia.

He took part in the First World War to the campaigns in the West and East, in Italy and in the Carpathians and led the fifth reserve mountain infantry battalion. In 1919 he retired from active military service. Well, he managed until his father's death in 1927, the Hohenzollern ppsession Umkirch in Freiburg im Breisgau. This he had inherited from King Carol I of Romania. Fürst Friedrich was opposed to the Weimar Republic from the beginning. He was inclined to the traditional Catholicism and the imperial ideology of the Catholic conservatives. With the death of his father in 1927, he took according to the House laws the name Fürst of Hohenzollern, which from 1927 to 1931 led to a name and title dispute with the Prussian authorities. President of the Government of Hohenzollern country, Alfonso Scherer, sat in a circular of 9 July 1928, the authorities informed that Prince Friedrich of Hohenzollern after the death of his father, neither had the right to the title Fürst of Hohenzollern nor the style of Highness. Further emphasized Scherer in the letter that the name is Prince of Hohenzollern and the name Fürst of Hohenzollern in 1927 was extinguished with the death of Fürst Wilhelm of Hohenzollern, and therefore could not pass to his son Friedrich. He particularly emphasized also that the name Fürst Friedrich of Hohenzollern was forbidden. He pointed specifically to Article 109, paragraph 3 of the constitution and the Prussian aristocracy law of 23.06.1920. It was the Prussian state and local authorities in general forbidden to use the words Fürst and Court. Therefore, Fürst Friedrich was now officially treated as Mr. Friedrich, Prince of Hohenzollern. This resulted in a year-long political battle of the Princely House with the regional council, because Friedrich wanted the astyle of Highness and the title of fürst. He threatened the town of Sigmaringen with the transfer of its management to Munich. This prompted the city fathers to work towards the replacement of the President of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior Government in Berlin. The Minister of the Interior Carl Severing (SPD), the placed on 31.08.1931 the Government President Scherer into temporary retirement. The Princely House had won the political battle for name and style. The new government President Heinrich Brand made no further resistance to Friedrich's claim to be adressed as Highness and Fürst. Despite the adverse conditions during the Great Depression, Friedrich succeeded to secure the possession of the house and its operations, in particular the extensive forest ownership in eastern Germany. He managed to acquire parts of the already divested of his father treasures again and so to save the Hohenzollern art collection. Friedrich was honorary chairman of the Association of Silesian Maltese law knight and chief of the steel helmet in Württemberg and Baden. Friedrich affinity for military nursing tradition led to the approach of Nazism. His younger twin brother of Prince Franz Joseph of Hohenzollern joined the SS. 1935 gave the Nazi state Friedrich the style of Royal Highness. The desired of him entering the army he was denied due to the later so-called Prince decree. In the beginning of September 1944 he had to leave with his family the castle in Sigmaringen because it was needed for the billeting of the Vichy regime. With the Romanian King Michael I related royal family was interned because of the waste of Romania from the Axis powers in Unterwilflingen Castle in Langenenslingen. With the end of World War II two-thirds of the former possessions of the Princely House of Hohenzollern went lost. The well-known aristocrat Fürst Friedrich was very popular in the Hohenzollern lands. He was far beyond the home region beyond use and helpfulness. He supported, for example, many religious and cultural institutions. To the monasteries Beuron and Habsthal he gave a larger scale plots. He was also active for the expellees and social housing. At Castle Krauchenwies he set up a Maltese orphanage for refugee children and war orphans.\n\nFürst Friedrich had married in 1921 Princess Margarethe of Saxony, the oldest daughter of King Friedrich August III. of Saxony.\n\nThey had 7 children:\n\nMaria Antonia, married to Count Heinrich of Waldburg zu Wolfegg and Waldsee\n\nMaria Adelgunde, maried first to Prince Konstantin of Bavaria from whom she was later divorced.

The Palais was build from 1623-1830 by Albrecht of Wallenstein (from the noble Family Waldstein) who was Commander In Chief of the Imperial Troops during the 30 years War. He however only lived in it for a short time and after his death it was sold to another member of the Waldstein Family who owned it until 1945. It then become czecian Strate Property and since 1992 the Palais houses the Senate. Therefore the Palais itself an not be visited.\n\nHowever the Gardens can be visited. Albrecht of Wallenstein led them design by italien architects as he had travelled in italy before. Four courtyards are created by the palace layout. Its complex includes period gardens, the Avenue of Sculptures, stables and the large Riding School. The monumental conception of the loggia with three arcades on doubled columns recalls the Baroque style. The Italian style garden includes an aviary, a grotto, and a fountain by Adrian de Vries. After years of neglect after the war, the gardens have been reconstructed. Wallenstein would have dined in the huge sala terrena (garden pavilion) that looks out over fountain and rows of bronze statues. The sala terenna and its rich stucco decoration were modeled after the portico of a Livornese church. Today, these are copies of the Netherlander sculptor Adriaen de Vries’ works. The originals were looted by the Swedish army in 1648, and they can be seen today at Drottningholm Palace.\n\nmore Photos\n\n↧\n\nNoble Wedding at Iphofen\n\nPhoto and Copyright Gabi P.\n\nOn 21.

For this reason, it is sometimes also called Guelf-Este. The first member of this branch was Welf IV. he was the son of Azzo II., Margrave of Este and Kunigunde of Altdorf from the elder House of Guelf. From his father second marriage Gersende du Maine the house of Este, which ruled in Ferrare and Modena and became extinct in male line in 1803 is descending. When his maternal uncle Welf, Duke of Carinthia died in 1955 without leaving Issue he inherited the property of the Elder House of Guelf. In 1070, Welf IV. was created Duke of Bavaria by King Henrich II. Welf IVfoundedin 1056after the transferof theancestral castleof Altdorfonthe adjacentVeitsburgin Ravensburg Martinshill, a new Benedictineabbey which is the present Abbey Weingarten. He increased his holdings with those of Count Otto of Buchhorn and count Luitolt of Achalm. With him andhis sonsWelf V. and Heinrich the Blackbegan the periodin which thefamily in opposition to theHohenstaufenplayedthe central role in the Empire. His two sons Welf V and Heinrich split the inheritance, with the duchy of Bavaria going first to Welf VI. , who died without issue in 1120. Therefore his brother Heinrich the Black became Duke of Bavaria and inherited through his wife Wulfhild of Saxony, heiress of the Billung dynasty, Lüneburg and its region. He left two sons, Heinrich the Proud and Welf VI. They split the inheritance, with the lands in Saxony and Bavaria going to Heinrich, and the lands west of the Lech in Swabia to Welf VI. Heinrich the Proud followed his father as Duke of Bavaria, and married Gertrud, daughter of Emperor Lothar III and heiress of the Supplinburg, who brought him Brunswick, Wolfenbüttel and Nordheim. This made the Welfs the most important family in Saxony, and in 1137 Heinrich became Duke of Saxony, and also Margrave of Tuscany. In 1138 Lothar III died and Heinrich unsuccesfully contested the imperial crown with the Hohenstaufens; Conrad III became Emperor and Heinrich was banned in 1138, lost his two duchies, and died the following year. Welf VI, meanwhile, married the heiress of the count palatine Gotfried von Calw and greatly increased his possessions in Swabia. After thedeath of his brother he initiallytook over theleadership of the Houseandthe administration of the guelf family estatesin Swabia, as Heinrich the Lion, the onlyson of Heinrich the Proud, was notyet of age. In 1142, he succeeded byKonrad III. thereturnof the Duchy ofSaxonyto Heinrich the lion.MargraveWelfVI. founded in 1147 thePremonstratensian monasterySteingaden as House monastery andgravelay. Alreadyaround 1120wasJudith,sister of Heirnich the ProudandWelfVI. married to Friedrich vonStaufen,Duke of Swabia to effecta balancebetweenthe Hohenstaufenand Guelf . From this marriagethe future Emperor Friedrich Barbarossawas born, who in 1151 reached 1151a reconciliationbetweenhis uncleKonrad III. and his Guelf cousins.Konrad III. haddiedin 1152andhis successor was Friedrich.As part of thereconciliation Heinrich the Lionin 1156receivedthe duchy of Bavariaback. WelfVI.becameDuke ofSpoletoand thusthe most powerful manin the Italianpart of the empire, sincehe ruledbecause of itsrelationshipwith the house ofEsteviaSardinia andMargraveaboutTuscia. Whenin 1167 the only son of Welf VI. WelfVII diedfrom malaria, he lost interestin politics andbequeathed to Friedrich I. Barbarossa through inheritance contract theGuelfhouseestates inSwabia, includingRavensburg andAltdorf,which have now beenadded totheHohenstaufenhousegoods. As a result, there was renewedconflictsbetween the Emperor andhis cousinHeinrich the Lion ,in thecourse of whichthisis notonly hisduchies ofBavariaand Saxonylost(1179 outlawry, 1180withdrawingtheimperial fief), but also to Englandto his relativesfrom the house ofPlantagenettohad togoin exile-his wifeMatildawas the sisterofRichard the Lionheart.The power of the Guelf'sinGermanywas broken,the Duchy ofBavariafell to theWittelsbach family, who ruledthere until1918.\n\nAfter areconciliationwith the Emperorin 1194he wasindeedgiven partof his estatesandtitle back, the struggle betweenHohenstaufen(allied with theFrench royalhouse ofCapetandwithAragon) andGuelph(allied with theHouse of Anjou-Plantagenet) buttookon,reflectsismainly reflected intheconflictswithintheItalianloyal to the emperorand thepopeloyalpartyof the GhibellinesandGuelfs. Heinrich the Lion died in 1195 and left three sons who in 1203 dividded the inheritance:\n\nHeinrich received Ditmarsen, Hadeln, Wursten, Stade, Hannover with the lands on the left bank of the Leine, Nordheim, Göttingen, the western half of Lüneburg with Celle, Homburg, Eimbeck, part of the Eichsfeld and the possessions in Westphalia. He also inherited the palatinate from his wife Agnes, daughter of Konrad (brother of the Emperor Friedrich I. Barbarossa) but left no male issue\n\nOtto received Brunswick and the regions west to Hanover and north to Hankensbüttel, half of the Harz, the lands between the Leine and the Aller, Sommereschenburg, the castles of Lichtenberg, Asselburg, Schiltberg, Staufenburg, Herzberg, Scharzfeld, Hohenstein, Osterode and the possessions in Thuringia. In 11898 he elected as opposide Anti-King against Philipp of Swabia. After the assassination of Philipp of Swabia in 1208Ottowasin 1209by PopeInnocent III. crowned as thefirst and onlyGuelf Emperor of the HolyRoman Empire, butmade​​shortly thereafterbecauseof his attemptto integrateinto the kingdom ofSicily, underexcommunication. 1214Ottodefeatedin the Battleof Bouvinesthe French KingPhilip II Augustusand theHohenstaufen Friedrich II, whoin 1215waselectedAnti-King. Otto IVdiedin 1218at theHarzburg, and was succeeded by Friedrich II.\n\nWilhelm (d. 1213) received the lands beyond the Elbe, the eastern half of the Lüneburg region with Lüneburg, the other half of the Harz and most of the possessions in the Altmark; he also received the overlordship over Lauenburg, Blankenburg, Hitzacker, Lüchow, Dannenberg\n\nAs the two oldest sons left no Issue the Dynasty continued with Wilhelm's son Otto the child. He had been named as Heir by his uncle Heinrich, but Heirnich's daughters married to the Margrave of Baden and the Duke of Bavaria made claims to the allodial lands, and asked for the help of the Emperor, Friedrich II, who had an interest in reducing the powers of the Guelf family. The matter was resolved in 1235 when Otto renounced any claims to Bavaria and the Palatinate, and gave Lüneburg to the Empire. Conversely Friedrich II. renounced any claims to Brunswick and united Brunswick and Lüneburg into an imperial fief with the rank of duchy, which he conferred on Otto. This put an end to the feud between the Guelf's and the Hohenstaufens and permanently settled the legal situation of the Guelfs in the Empire.\n\nDuchy of Brunswick and Lüneburg\n\nIn 1235 Otto the child was given Brunswick and Lünenburg as new created Duchy of Brunswick and Lüenburg by Emperor Friedrich II. which ended the feunds between the Guelf's and the Hohenstaufen's.Ottopromoted hisresidenceBrunswickconfirmationbythe cityrights forthe citizens of theold townin 1227(\"Ottonianum\"). In 1241 he confirmedthe pre-existing rightsof Hanover. After the death ofOtto his oldest son Albrechtreceivedthe territory.ButDukeAlbrecht I.could not prevailagainst hisbrother Johann, so that there was adivision of the inheritanceof the territoryin 1267.\n\nAlbrecht got the lands around Brunswick and Wolfenbüttel with Gifhorn and Helmstädt, the Eichsfeld, Grubenhagen, the lands between Deister and Leine (Kalenberg), the Oberwald (Göttingen)\n\nJohann got Lüneburg and Celle, Lichtenberg, Twiflingen, Hanover. He was succeeded by his only son Otto the Strong, who in turn had four sons; two were made clerics and the other two ruled jointly at first, then after the death without issue of one, the other, Wilhelm, ruled alone. At his death in 1369, the inheritance (increased meanwhile with the counties of Lüchow, Dannenberg, Wölpe, and the castles of Hallermund, Bleckede, Hitzacker and Neubrück) became the subject of a long-running dispute. Wilhelms's Elisabeth, and her son Albrecht of Saxony claimed the inheritance in spite of the rights of the Guelf agnates. The Emperor considered that the fief should return to the Emperor. In 1355 he had invested Albrecht of Sacony with the eventual fief. The same year, Wilhem had signed an agrement with his cousin Magnus of Brunswick to name a son of Magnus, Ludwig, as his heir and promise him his other daughter Mechthild. Magnus himself promised to leave Brunswick to his son Ludwig, so that the two halves of the Welf inheritance should be united again, and should Ludwig predecease Wilhelm of Lüneburg, the claims would be transferred to another son of Magnus. When Ludwig died in 1367, his brother Magnus Torquatus was appointed heir. The disputed dragged on until 1389 when the Saxon family agreed to abandon its claims in exchange for an Erbverbrüderung giving reciprocal claims in case of male-line extinction of either family:\n\nDuke Albrecht was the ancestor of the first House of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. He in turn had six sons from which three where clerics and the other three, Heinrich, Albrecht, Wilhelm, ruled jointly for a while and then split their inheritance at an unknown date which is assumed to be 1286\n\nHeinrich received Grubenhagen, Salzderhelden, Eimbeck, half of Hameln, Catlenburg, the castles and cities of Herzberg, Scharzfeld, Bodenstein, Osterode, Duderstadt, the mines and forests of Clausthal\n\nAlbrecht received Oberwald with Göttingen and Münden, the palatinate of Grona and the castles of Niedeck, Friedland, Brackenberg, Sichelstein, and also Uslar, Nordheim, and the territory between the Deister and the Leine\n\nWilhelm received the fortress and city of Brunswick and Wolfenbüttel, Asseburg, Scheningen, Harzburg, Gandersheim, Staufenburg and Seesen. He died in died in 1292 without issue and his brothers argued over the inheritance, with the larger share going in the end to the Göttingen line.\n\nThe Grubenhagen line\n\nThe founder of the line Heinrich left four sons, the last of which was a cleric. The three other sons divided the inheritance after a period of joint rule: Heinrich II receiving possessions around the Eichsfeld, Ernst the region around Eimbeck, and Wilhelm the castle and region of Herzberg. Wilhelm died unmarried, Heinrich II's line ended with his son Otto in 1398, so that Ernst's line was the only one to continue. Ernst's three sons Albrecht II, Johann and Friedrich ruled jointly, with the eldest effectively in charge. Johann died without children, Friedrich's only son Otto died in 1452 without issue, and the line continued with Albrecht II, whose residence was Salzderhelden, and his only son Erich. In 1402, Erich reached an agreement with his uncle Friedrich that each line would keep its lands undivided. Erich left three sons Heinrich, Ernst and Albrecht, who were first under the guardianship of their cousin Otto, then ruled jointly. In 1463 Heinrich died leaving a young son Heinrich, and Ernst ceded the government and guardianship of young Heinrich to his brother Albrecht. In 1481 Albrecht and his nephew Heinrich divided the lands, with Albrecht taking Herzberg and Heinrich Salderhelden, and Grubenhagen divided equally. Heinrich died without issue in 1526 and the Grubenhagen inheritance was once again reunited in Albrecht's line.\n\nAlbrecht left in 1486 three sons, two of which, Philipp and Erich, survived to rule jointly until Erich became bishop of Paderborn and Philipp ruled alone. He became a Protestant in 1534 and died in 1551 leaving four sons. Although no known law of primogeniture was introduced, only his eldest son Ernst succeeded; he died without issue in 1567 and his two brothers Wolfgang and Philipp divided the inheritance, and each died without issue (in 1595 and 1598 respectively), ending the Grubenhagen line.\n\nJulius of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel claimed the whole inheritance and seized it, but the Celle line sued in the Reichshofrat, being closer in degrees (15 against Julius's 16 degrees) and being the senior line. A ruling in 1617 forced Julius to cede the inheritance.\n\nThe Göttingen line\n\nAlbrecht the founder of the line, initially had his residence at Göttingen, then moved to Dankwarderoda. He made a pact in 1292 with his cousin Otto of Lüneburg, providing for reciprocal rights of guardianship for the children of the other until the age of 12, and resolution of disputes between them by a council of their vassals. His sons Magnus and Ernst divided the inheritance in 1345:\n\nErnst received Göttingen, founding a line of Göttingen that ended with Otto in 1463 who ceded in 1442 his lands with the exception of Uslar to his cousin Wilhelm of Brunswick.\n\nMagnus received Brunswick and Wolfenbüttel: his sons were Magnus II Torquatus and Ludwig, and Ludwig (as explained above) was intended to inherit Lüneburg but died too soon, and the long-running dispute over Lüneburg ended only to the advantage of Magnus II's sons Friedrich, Bernhard, Heinrich and Otto. These brothers had made an agreement in 1374 providing for the rule of an undivided Brunswick by the eldest brother Friedrich, to be followed by his brothers one after the other, and only at the death of the last would the eldest son of Friedrich succeed. This was not lineal primogeniture, but a form of seniorat (similar to the one in the house of Württemberg in 1482). When the brothers received Lüneburg in 1389, it was given to the two younger brothers Bernhard and Heinrich to rule jointly. In 1394 the brothers agreed never to divide Brunswick-Lüneburg. But these agreements were not enforced: at the death of Friedrich in 1400 without issue the two brothers Bernhard and Heinrich divided the lands in 1409: Bernhard as the eldest divided, and Heinrich chose. Heinrich took Lüneburg, leaving Brunswick, Hanover, Everstein, and the territory between Deister and Leine to Bernhard, with the cities of Brunswick and Lüneburg remaining in common. In 1415 they returned to joint rule, but in 1428 a final partition was carried out, this time with Bernhard receiving Lüneburg and the sons of Heinrich taking Brunswick, Calenberg and Hanover.\n\nThe second House of Brunswick-Wolffenbüttel\n\nHeinrich, the founder of the line, left two sons who shared the inheritance in 1432: Wilhelm took Calenberg and Heinrich took Wolfenbüttel (he died in 1473 without issue). Wilhelm increased his holdings, inheriting from the Göttingen line in 1442. Wilhelm left two sons who prepared to divide the inheritance but one died soon and the survivor, Wilhelm the younger, kept all the lands. He in turn had two sons, between whom he arranged a partition before abdicating in their favor in 1495: the older, Heinrich, drew the partition, the younger son Erich chose. Erich took Calenberg and Göttingen, Heinrich received Wolfenbüttel. The Calenberg line ended with Erich's son Erich II in 1584.Heinrich zu Wolfenbüttel had six sons. They made a pact to avoid partition and let the eldest brother rule for the other, and the four younger brothers received ecclesiastical benefices, but later Wilhelm, the second oldest brother, asked for a partition; in response the older brother locked him up for 12 years. This seemed sufficient to persuade Wilhelm to come to an agreement, the \"Pactum Henrico-Wilhelminum\" of 1535, which instituted indivisibility and lineal primogeniture, with monetary pension for younger brothers and dowries for daughters. From this point on, primogeniture was observed in the house of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel. Heinrich, a stalwart of the Catholic party, was succeeded by his protestant son Julius, who confirmed primogeniture in his testament of 1582, approved by the emperor on 13.09.1582. Julius was followed by his son Heinrich Julius and the latter's son Friedrich Ulrich, the last of the second house of Brunswick who died in 1634.The inheritance naturally passed to the Lüneburg branch; but it had split in three branches: Harburg (Wilhelm and Otto, childless grandchildren of Otto of Harburg and Metta von Campen), Dannenberg (the brothers Julius Ernst and August the younger) and Cella (the brothers August the elder, Friedrich and Georg). The Harburg line was not a major player because of its lack of issue. The Dannenberg and Cella lines fought over the way in which to divide the inheritance: August zu Dannenberg demanded the whole inheritance, or at least division by lines (in stirpes, making two equal shares); Georg zu Cella demanded division in capita (making 5 lots, 2 for Dannenberg and 3 for Cella). Ultimately, in 1635 and 1636, the division went as follows: Harburg received the county of Hoya and Reinstein-Blankenburg, Dannenberg received Wolfenbüttel, Cella received Calenberg. The university of Helmstädt and the mines of the Harz remained joint property.\n\nThe second House of Lüneburg\n\nThe founder of the line Bernhard left the government to his sons Otto and Friedrich, who ruled jointly even after his death until Otto died without issue. Friedrich the Pious abdicated in 1457 to retire in a convent in favor of his sons, but both sons Bernhard II. (who had no Issue) and Otto the Magnanimous died before their father. As only Otto left a minor child Heinrich, Bernhard returned from his retirement to rule again until his death in 1478, leaving the whole duchy to his minor grandson Heinrich under the guardianship of the council and magistrates of Lüneburg.\n\nDuring his reign Heinrich increased his possessions somewhat, and obtained eventual rights to Hoya (Sept 1501) and Diepholz (1517). But his territories were devastated by the Hildesheim feud (Hildesheimer Stiftsfehde), which raged from 1519 to 1523 between the bishop of Hildesheim aided by the Duke of Lüneburg on one hand, the nobility of Hildesheim aided by the bishop of Minden and the dukes Heinrich of Wolfenbüttel and Erich of Calenberg on the other hand. Heinrich also took sides with king François I of France in the imperial election of 1519, and after Karl V. was elected he was put under the ban of the Empire and had on 22.07.1522 to go in exile in France, leaving his sons Otto and Ernst to rule. In 1527 Ernst secured from his brothers Otto and Franz renunciations to the rule of the duchy in exchange for Harburg (for Otto) and Gieffhorn (for Franz, who died childless in 1549). Otto's line of Harburg is descended from his marriage to Metta von Campen. Ernst, who was a nephew of the Elector of Saxony at whose court in Wittenberg he had learned Luther's doctrine, introduced the reformation in Lüneburg (in spite of his father's unexpected return from France and attempt to regain the government of the duchy). When Ernst died in 1546, he left a number of sons, for whom the Emperor appointed the Elector of Cologne and the count of Schaumburg as guardians, who in 1555 turned over the duchy to the eldest son Franz Otto; he died in 1559 without issue, at which time only two brothers remained, Heinrich and Wilhelm. They initially agreed to rule jointly for 5 years, but the younger brother Wilhelm was doing all the work, and Heinrich was only getting married while Wilhelm had three sons; on 13.09.1569 Heinrich agreed to renounce his rights except upon extinction of his brother's line or of the Brunswick line, in exchange for Dannenberg as indemnity (augmented in 1592 with Hitzacker, Lüchow and Werpke), a lump sum of 4000 Thaler and an annual payment of 500 Thaler. The agreement was approved by the estates and by the emperor.\n\nHeinrich zu Dannenber's line in 1634 inherited Wolffenbüttel when this line became extinct and became the Ducal House of Brunswick-Wolffentbüttel and in 1814 Duke of Brunswick.\n\nWilhelm's line became later the Electoral and Royal House of Hannover.\n\nThe third House of Brunswick, Principality of Brunswick-Wolffenbütel from 1634\n\nWhen in 1634 the line of Brunswick-Wolffenbüttel became extinct in the male line the apanaged line of Dannenberg succeeded with Duke Julius Ernst as reigning Fürst As he had no male Issue he ceded his rights to his younger brother August who those became the sole ruler in 1635.

However, Rudolf August was devoted to his studies and the hunting. He createf a comprehensive library and had been appointed in 1663 by his father to \"Jägermeister\" . However, even before his accession , he proved that he wants to help the citizens. According to regulation by him of 24.12.1660 he released the Calvördern to obtain the necessary construction and firewood from the Calvörder forest. In 1667 , a year after he took office , he appointed his younger , power-conscious brother Anton Ulrich as governor . Rudolf August withdrew more and more from government transactions to which he gave to his brother . 1671 succeeded Rudolf August and Anton Ulrich to occupy the city Brunswick after about three weeks of siege. Thus ended the era of the independent city of Braunschweig . In 1685, he appointed his brother Anton Ulrich and equal co-regent . In 1650, he married Countess Elisabeth Christiane of Barby. The couple had three daughters, one of whom died before their first birthday . To ensure the family inheritance he agreed to the marriage of his daughter Christine Sophie with her cousin August Wilhelm the son of Anton Ulrich . August Wilhelm therefore followed in 1714 his father, Anton Ulrich, who had in 1704 , assumed the sole rule after the death of Rudolf August. Fürst Rudolf August themselves married in the 1681 a few weeks after the death of his first wife in morganatic marriage, just eighteen years old Rosine Elisabeth Menthe, daughter of a barber and surgeon . The marriage remained childless. During his reign of thirty-eight Rudolf August developed a construction boom .
