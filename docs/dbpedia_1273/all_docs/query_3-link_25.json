From 1868 Ebeling was professor of music at the Caroline-Gymnasium in Stettin, where he died in 1676, the year of Paul Gerhardt’s death. Among Ebeling’s works may be mentioned Pauli Gerhardi Geistliche Andachten. 1666-1667. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nEBELING, Johann Georg (1620-1676), like Johann Crüger (q. v.), one of the “singers of Paul Gerhardt,” was born in Lüneburg in July, 1620. He became cantor of St. Nicholas Church, Berlin, in 1662, and director of music at the College of St. Nicholas (Schulkollege am grauen Kloster) there, succeeding Johann Crüger. In 1668 he was appointed Professor of Music at the College of St. Charles (Caroline - Gymnasium), Stettin, where he died in 1676, the same year in which Paul Gerhardt died. His chief publication is Pauli Gerhardt Geistliche Andachten, 1666-67. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n57, 377\n\nEber, Paul, 1511-69\n\nPaul Eber was born November 8, 1511, in Kitzingen, where his father was a tailor. In 1523 he entered the gymnasium in Ansbach. But his health failed and he was compelled to go home. On the way home he was thrown from his horse and, being dragged by the stirrup for a great distance, he suffered injuries which made him a cripple for life. From 1525 to 1532 he remained in the gymnasium of Nürnberg, and here, under the guidance of able teachers, he laid the foundation for his extensive learning. In 1532 he entered the University of Wittenberg. After a few years of study he was appointed tutor in philosophy. In 1544 he was made professor of Latin, and in 1557 professor of Hebrew and also court preacher. The following year he was elected general superintendent or bishop of Saxony. He died in 1569. Eber was a very intimate friend of Melanchthon, who frequently asked his advice on matters of importance. On this account Eber was jokingly called “Philippi Repertorium.” Luther, also, placed great confidence in Eber’s ability. When he in a conversation with his friends dwelt upon the distress and trials which would befall Germany at his departure, he turned to Eber and said: “Your name is Paul. Therefore I admonish you to follow Paul’s example and to put forth all effort to keep and defend the doctrine which St. Paul has given us.” In 1560 Melanchthon died, and Eber suffered much unpleasantness because he, like Melanchthon, was suspected of leaning towards Calvinism on the doctrine of the Lord’s Supper. At the colloquium of Altenburg, in 1569, during the synergistic controversies, the assertion was made that the Wittenberg theologians ought not to be accepted into communion nor be permitted to serve as sponsors. Eber returned to his home grievously hurt and sick at heart. Shortly after this his wife died. Scarcely half a year afterwards Eber followed her. The principle according to which he regulated his life was expressed in the 105th verse of Psalm 119: “Thy Word is a lamp unto my feet and a light upon my path.” Paul Eber ranks second to Luther as hymn-writer of the Wittenberg school. He wrote in all 17 hymns. A number of these were written especially for his children and set to Lutheran melodies. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nEBER, Paul (1511-1569), son of Johannes Eber, master tailor at Kitzingen, Bavaria, was born at Kitzingen, November 8, 1511. He was sent in 1523 to the Gymnasium at Ansbach, but, forced by illness to return home, was thrown from his horse and dragged more than a mile, remaining as a consequence deformed for life. In 1525 he entered the St. Lorenz School at Nürnberg and on June 1, 1532, he matriculated at the University of Wittenberg, his teachers being Luther and Melanchthon. In 1527 he became tutor in the Philosophical Faculty and four years later was appointed regular professor, first of Latin and then of Physics. In 1557 he was appointed professor of Hebrew and preacher of the Castle Church at Wittenberg. He acted as Melanchthon’s secretary at the Colloquy at Worms, but he left for Wittenberg at Christmas. On September 4, 1558, he succeeded Bugenhagen as municipal preacher and general superintendent of the electoral circuit. In 1559 he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity from the University of Wittenberg. He died at Wittenberg December 10, 1569. Paul Eber, next to Luther, was the best poet of the Wittenberg school. His hymns, some of them written for his own children to sing to Luther’s melodies, are distinguished for their childlike spirit and beautiful simplicity. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n238, 257, 530\n\nEccard, Johann, 1553-1611\n\nThe melody, which is of secular origin, was arranged for church use by Johannes Eccard, born 1553 in Mühlhausen. He was a noted church musician. After working for some time in his native city, he moved to Königsberg, and finally became “kapellmeister” in Berlin. He died in 1611.

He was educated at King William’s College, on the Isle of Man, and at Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated in 1849. The following year he was ordained and appointed assistant pastor of Easebourne. After serving in a number of places, he was, in 1876, appointed to the rectorship of Barnes and in 1886 to the pastorate of White Rodney, in which place he remained until his death in Torquay, June 15, 1893. Together with Wm. Walsham How, Ellerton edited Church Hymns, 1871, and in 1881 he published Notes and illustrations of Church Hymns. As early as 1859 he had published Hymns f or Schools and Bible Classes. He has written in all about 50 hymns and 10 or more translations from the Latin. Nearly all his hymns are in common use and a good number of them are very popular. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nELLERTON, John (1826-1893), son of George Ellerton, was born in London on December 16, 1826. He was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge, and graduated (B. A. ) in 1849 and (M. A. ) in 1854. After Ellerton took holy orders, he was successively Curate of Eastbourne, Sussex, 1850; Brighton, and Lecturer of St. Peters, Brighton, 1852; Vicar of Crewe Green and Chaplain to Lord Crewe, 1860; Rector of Hinstock, 1872; of Barnes, 1876; and of White Roding, 1886. Ellerton’s prose works include The Holiest Manhood, 1882, and Our Infirmities, 1883. He was editor of Hymns for Schools and Bible Classes, Brighton, 1859, and coeditor of the S. P. C. K. Church Hymns, 1871. In 1881 Ellerton published his Notes and Illustrations of Church Hymns in a folio edition. Although in general the notes are full and accurate, those on the older hymns are too general; while they are useful for the general reading public, they are a disappointment to the hymnologist. John Ellerton wrote about 50 original hymns and translated about ten from the Latin. He died at Torqual in 1893. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n597\n\ntr. 267\n\nElliott, Charlotte, 1789-1871\n\nCharlotte Elliott was born March 18th, 1789, in Westfield Lodge, Brighton. The first thirty-two years of her life were spent mostly at Clapham. Later she moved to Brighton, where she remained until her death, September 22, 1871. Her acquaintance with Dr. Cesar Malan, of Geneva, had great influence upon the development of her spiritual life. She had a very weak constitution, in fact, from 1821 on she was an invalid, but just the same she managed to keep up considerable literary activity. She wrote about 150 hymns, of which many were printed in her brother’s hymn collection entitled: Psalms and Hymns for Public, Private, and Social Worship (by The Rev. H. V. Elliott, 18351848). The Invalid’s Hymn Book, originally edited by Miss Kierman, was revised in 1834 by Miss Elliott and appeared in many editions, to which she contributed in all 112 hymns. She also published Hours of Sorrow Cheered and Comforted, and several other minor works. She has few equals in the art of writing for the sick and the sorrowful. (See also under No. 447.) [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nELLIOTT, Charlotte (1789-1871), was the daughter of Charles Elliott, of Clapham and Brighton, England, and the granddaughter of the Rev. Henry Venn, an eminent Church of England divine. She was born March 18, 1789, and developed, at an early age, a passion for music and art. She was unusually well educated. At the age of thirty-two she became an invalid and remained such, at times suffering great pain, until her death on September 22, 1871, at Brighton. She was a member of the Church of England. Her hymns have in them a tenderness and sweetness born of much suffering and resignation. Although an invalid, she devoted her life to writing. Her Invalid’s Hymn Book was published in various editions from 1834 to 1854 and contained altogether 115 of her hymns. Other poetic works written by her and containing hymns were: Hours of Sorrow, 1836; Hymns for a Week, 1839; Thoughts in Verse on Sacred Subjects, 1869. Some of her hymns were printed in her brothers somewhat important Psalms and Hymns for Public, Private, and Social Worship, 1835. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n319\n\nElliott, Julia Anne (Marshall), ?-1841\n\nJULIA ANNE ELLIOTT, daughter of John J Marshall, was married, 1833, to the Rev. H. W. Elliott (a brother of the poetess Charlotte Elliott). She died in 1841. Her hymns, 11 in number, were printed in Rev. H. W. Elliott’s Psalms and Hymns in 1835, first anonymously; her initials were added in the later edition of 1839. Her hymns are marked by deep religious spirit and fine poetic taste. This hymn has as its first line in Elliott’s Psalms and Hymns: “Great Creator, who this day.” [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nELLIOTT, Julia Anne, née Marshall (?-1841), daughter of John Marshall of Hallsteads, Ullswater, on a visit to Brighton with her father, met and afterwards, in 1833, married the Rev. Henry Venn Elliott, brother of Charlotte Elliott. She contributed, anonymously, eleven hymns to her husband’s collection, Psalms and Hymns, 1835. In later editions her initials were added. She died in 1841 shortly after the birth of her fifth child. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n14\n\nElven, Cornelius, 1791-1873\n\nCornelius Elven was born 1797 in Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk, where he lived and labored throughout his life. He was pastor of the local Baptist congregation of that place for fifty years. He was an intimate friend of C. H. Spurgeon, who valued his friendship very highly and for whom Elven frequently preached. After the death (1873) of Mr. Elven, Spurgeon often referred to him and praised him highly as an able and faithful servant of the Lord, an intensely fervent and sincere preacher filled with the fire of the Spirit. The melody (St. Cross) was composed by J. B. Dykes. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nELVEN, Cornelius (1791-1873), was born in St. Edmunds, Suffolk, where he lived and labored throughout his life. He was a pastor of the Baptist Church at Bury St. Edmunds for fifty years. When he took his charge, it numbered only forty members, but increased to more than 600. He was a very good friend of C. H. Spurgeon, who valued his friendship very highly and said of Elven that he was a faithful servant of the Lord, and an intensely fervent and sincere preacher, filled with the fire of the spirit. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n455\n\nElvey, George Job, 1816-93\n\nThe melody (Urswicke) was composed by Sir G. J. Elvey, Mus. Doc., born 1816, England, died 1893. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nELVEY, George Job (18161893), was born in Canterbury, England, on March 27, 1816, and baptized in the Presbyterian Chapel there. He was educated as a chorister at the Cathedral School and later studied under Dr. Crotch at the Royal Academy of Music in London. When Elvey was only nineteen, he was appointed organist and master of the boys at St. George’s, Windsor, after which his well-known tune is named. In 1838 Elvey graduated from Oxford as Bachelor of Music and two years later was granted the Doctorate. As organist of St. George’s for forty-seven years, Elvey had charge of the music for many important events connected with the royal house. He was knighted in 1871 after his composition of a Festival March for the wedding of Princess Louise. Elvey died at Windlesham, Surrey, December 9, 1893, and was buried outside the west front of St. George’s Chapel.

In 1652 she was married to her father’s chaplain, Ambrosius Hardenbeck, who later succeeded his father-in-law as pastor at Bergen’s Cathedral Church and died as provost. In 1678 Dorothe Engelbretsdatter published “Siælens Sang-Offer, indholdende gudelige Sange paa de fornemste Fester”, which was reprinted many times, even as recently as 1782, partly in connection with her “Taare-Offer, gudelige Siæle til Underviiszning” (translated in 1727 into Swedish by “a prominent woman”), a versified rendering of Pastor Peder Møller’s devotion book “Trøst- og Taarekilde” (1677-79), which dealt with the tearful, the exasperating, the kissing, and the anointing Mary Magdalene. In 1690 she published in addition “Tvende ny aandelige Psalmer”, the morning hymn: “Nu er det Tid at vaage” and the evening hymn “Dagen viger og gaar bort” (Psalmebog for Kirke og Hjem Nr. 74); in 1698 “Et christeligt Valet fra Verden og Længsel efter Himmelen” and 1705 “Tvende meget smucke ny Psalmer”: “Om nu mit Hoved end svemmed i Vand” and “De, som er til Guds Rige fød”. She died in Bergen February 19, 1716, after having lost her husband and all her 9 children, difficult experiences, which partly gave her poetry a darker character. Her contemporaries set great praise on the Norwegian poetess’ spiritual poems, and Kingo wrote: “Get now hence, ye nine most famous goddesses, to bow low before one of the women of the North!” “But,” N. M. Petersen says: “the honor faded long ago. Her gentle biblical hymns are without enthusiasm, and her occasional verse which should be cheerful or even satirical, is tasteless”. Dorothe Engelbretdatter’s thoughts are often trivial, and her preference for foreign words has made the greatest part of her “Sangeoffer” distasteful to later times.\n\n[Kirke Leksikon for Norden, Dr. Fredrik Nielsen, Aarhus: Jydsk Forlags-Forretning, 1900, translated by MED]\n\n479\n\nEnglish sources\n\n126, 269\n\nEnglish sources\n\n145, 183, 223, 228, 281, 574\n\nErbaulicher … Christenschatz, Basel, 1745\n\n199, 222, 240\n\nEssay on the Church Plainchant, 1782\n\n407\n\nEtlich Cristlich lider, Wittenberg,1524\n\n227, 241, 374, 378, 392\n\nEugenie, Princess of Sweden, 1830-89\n\n61\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Hymn-Book, 1912\n\ntr. 405, 564\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Hymnal, 1880, st. 3\n\ntr. 190\n\nEvangelical Lutheran Hymnary, 1996\n\n179, 330, 471\n\ntr. 490, 585\n\nsetting: 537\n\nEwing, Alexander, 1830-95\n\nThe melody (Ewing) is composed by Lieut.-Colonel Alexander Ewing, born 1830, Scotland; died 1895.

Alfred Gatty, D. D., vicar of Ecclesfield, and subdean of York Cathedral. (She was well known for her writings for the young; died at Bath, 1885. ) He studied music at Heidelberg; was associated with the Haydn Society of Aberdeen, and the Harmonie Choir under William Carnie. He died at Taunton in 1895. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n534\n\nF. B. P., 16th century\n\nThe only mark of authorship [of this hymn] is “F. B.

[Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\n539\n\nFaber, Frederick William, 1814-63\n\nFrederick William Faber was born June 28, 1815, in Yorkshire, England. The family descended from the Huguenots. His parents died while he was yet young. Faber was educated at Balliol College, Oxford, where he received his degree of bachelor of arts in 1836. He was for a time Fellow at University College. After taking the theological examination he became rector of Eton, Huntingdonshire, 1843. Here he came under the influence of Cardinal Newman, and joined the Catholic Church in 1846. When he came to London in 1849, he organized an order called The Oratorians, or Priests of the Congregations of St. Philipp Neri. Here he labored until his death, in 1863. His hymns, 150 in number, were published after he had joined the Catholic Church. A few of his hymns are justly held in high esteem. Among these may be mentioned the four which have been taken up in The Lutheran Hymnary. His Hymns were published in one volume in 1862. Faber was an idealist. He is spoken of as a pious and amiable personality. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\n419\n\nFalckner, Justus, 1672-1723\n\nJustus Falckner, born November 22, 1672, in Langenreinsdorf, Saxony, was the fourth son of Daniel Falckner, a Lutheran preacher of the same city. Justus studied theology in Halle under A. H. Francke. Having completed his studies he, however, shrank from entering the ministry, fearing the heavy responsibilities attached to the office. Together with his elder brother, Daniel, who had lately returned from America, Justus, at Rotterdam, in 1700, became engaged in real estate business in Pennsylvania. The following year they sold 10,000 acres of Pennsylvania land to the preacher, Andreas Rudman, and other Swedes in the Manatawny district. This acquaintance with Rev. A. Rudman led to Falckner’s decision to enter the ministry. On November 24, 1703, he was ordained in the Swedish Wicacoa church in Philadelphia. The officiating pastors were Rudman, T. A. Björk, and Anders Sandel. He was called to the pastorate among the Dutch pioneers of the Manatawny district, near New Hannover, ‘but shortly after he was appointed to take Rudman’s place in the Lutheran congregations of New York and Albany. He labored there zealously and faithfully. In addition to these congregations he served temporarily the three congregations in New Jersey and two (Loonenburg and Neuburg) in New York state.\n\nThe records state that the New York charge became vacant. It is not definitely known whether this was due to Falckner’s death or to his removal to some other charge. Michael Knoll, who became pastor in New York 1732, expressed the opinion that Falckner died in the year 1723. But from the ministerial records of the congregation it seems rather probable that he withdrew to another charge in New Jersey, where the work would be less strenuous.\n\nJustus Falckner was the first Lutheran pastor to be ordained in America. Likewise, the catechism prepared by him is the first Lutheran book to be published on this continent. It was written in the Dutch language and published in New York in 1708 under the title: Grondlycke Onderricht, etc., and has a supplement of three hymns translated from the German. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nFALCKNER, Justus (1672-1723), born on November 22, 1672, at Langenreinsdorf, Crimmitschau, Zwickau, Saxony, was the son of a Lutheran pastor. He studied theology under A. H. Francke at the University of Halle. As he had a feeling of inadequacy for the ministerial office, he turned to a secular calling instead, and on April 23, 1700, accepted the power of attorney for the sale of Penn’s lands in Pennsylvania. It was a Swedish pastor, Andrew Rudmann, who persuaded him to accept the call to the Lutheran Church in New York. Falckner was ordained to the ministry in the Swedish Church at Wicaco, Philadelphia, on November 24, 1703, the first Lutheran clergyman ordained in America. He became pastor of the Lutheran congregations at New York and Albany, where he had a parish extending over two hundred miles. He also ministered to three congregations in New Jersey. In 1704 Falckner published a catechism, Grondelycke Onderricht, which was the first Lutheran book to be published on this continent. He died in 1723. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n217\n\nFawcett, John, 1740-1817\n\nJohn Fawcett, Baptist preacher of England, was born January 6, 1739 (or 1740), in Lidget Green, near Bradford, Yorkshire. At the age of 16 he came under the influence of Whitefield and joined the Methodists, but three years later he became a member of the Baptist church of Bradford. In 1765 he was ordained to the ministry and was installed in the Baptist congregation of Wainsgate, Yorkshire. Seven years later, in 1772, he was called to London to succeed the famous Dr. J. Gills of Carter’s Lane. He accepted the call. After delivering his farewell sermon to the congregation at Wainsgate, six loads of household goods were brought up near the church preparatory to his leaving for London. But the congregation was not ready to bid him farewell. Men, women, and children thronged about their pastor and his family and wept. Fawcett and his wife also were moved to tears at the sight. Finally his wife said, “O John, I cannot endure this; I do not understand how we can leave this place.” “No, you are right,” he replied, “neither shall we leave.” Then all their belongings were unpacked and put in their old places. It has been thought that Fawcett upon this occasion wrote the famous hymn, “Blest be the tie that binds,” which is such a favorite in Reformed circles. In 1777 the congregation built a new church near Heddon Bridge, and about the same time he opened a school in Brearly Hall, where he lived. In 1793 he was offered the position of president of the Baptist academy at Bristol, but declined. In 1811 he received his diploma of doctor of theology from America. He died in 1817, at the age of 78. Dr. Fawcett wrote many treatises on theological themes, and a large number of hymns and spiritual songs. The greater number of his hymns are found in the collection, Hymns adapted to the Circumstances of Public Worship and Private Devotion, Leeds, Wright and Son, 1782, in all 166 hymns. About 20 of these are in general use. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nFAWCETT, John (1740-1817), was born on January 16, 1740, at Lidget Green, Yorks, England; first joined the Methodists through Geo. Whitefield’s influence, but then became a Baptist and was ordained to the ministry in 1765 at Wainsgate and afterwards served a church at Hebden Bridge, Yorks, where he labored for the rest of his life, although he received some very important calls, one to succeed the famous Dr. J. Gill at the Carter Lane Church, London; another to become president of the Baptist Academy at Bristol. He was author of a number of religious prose works, including a devotional commentary on the Bible, and a large amount of sacred poetry. His Hymns adapted to the Circumstances of Public Worship and Private Devotions, 1782, contains 166 of his hymns. He died at Hebden Bridge in 1817.

Ill health forced him to resign this large charge. He then served our church at Collinsville, Illinois, for thirteen years, and spent the last thirteen years of his life as pastor in Boston, Massachusetts. He published his Lutherbuch and contributed articles and poems to Der Lutheraner, and other German language periodicals.

At an early age he was converted to Christianity at Aqulleia; received his education at Ravenna and Milan. While a student at Ravenna, where he excelled in oratory and poetry, Fortunatus almost became blind. He recovered his sight, as he believed, miraculously, by anointing his eyes with some oil sent by a friend, Gregory of Tours, which the latter had taken from a lamp that burned before the altar of St. Martin of Tours in a church of Ravenna. This induced Fortunatus to make a pilgrimage (565) to the shrine of St. Martin at Tours, and this pilgrimage resulted in his spending the rest of his life in Gaul. Possessed of a pleasing personality, fond of high living, endowed with poetic gifts, he was popular in all circles. In Gaul he formed a romantic but platonic friendship with Queen Rhadegunda, the daughter of Bertharius, king of the Thuringians, and the wife, though separated from him, of Lothair I (Clothaire), king of Neustria. Rhadegunda had left her throne to found the convent of St. Croix at Poitiers. She induced Fortunatus to enter the service of the Church. To her and Agnes, Rhadegunda’s former maid and appointed by her head of the convent, he composed the most extravagant poetic effusions. After Rhadegunda’s death Fortunatus was made bishop of Poitiers in 599. A quarto edition of Fortunatus’s Works was published in Rome in 1786. This work includes his Life of St. Martin of Tours. Fortunatus wrote many hymns; however, his Hymns for all the Festivals of the Christian Year is lost. Many of his hymns are to the Virgin. Indeed, Fortunatus was the first of the Christian poets to begin that worship of the Virgin Mary which rose to a passion and sank to idolatry. He was one of the last who, amid the advancing tide of barbarism, retained anything of the old classic culture.

His father, an attorney and councillor of the city, died two years later, and the son was adopted by the city judge, Adam Tielckau, who was married to his aunt, and who provided for his education. Johann first attended the school at Guben and later the gymnasium at Cottbus, but he had to leave the latter city on account of the Thirty Years’ War. He then continued his studies at Stettin and Thorn, until 1638, when he enrolled as a student of law in the university of Königsberg, the only German university which continued its work somewhat unhindered during the years of the great war. In Königsberg, Franck also developed his poetic talent under the guidance of the pious and prominent professor, Simon Dach. He enjoyed the companionship of Heinrich Held, who also became a hymn writer. He likewise associated with a number of other Christian young men, who kept aloof from the common excesses of student life. In 1640 he returned to Guben at the earnest request of his mother. Here he later entered the law profession and very soon became well and favorably known on account of his poetic and professional ability. He was first elected alderman, then burgomaster, and, finally, a member of the landtag. Franck died in 1677. Two hundred years later a memorial was erected to him in the form of a marble tablet set into the wall of the principal church of the city.\n\nAs a writer of hymns Franck is ranked next after Paul Gerhardt during this period. Of his 110 hymns, which are more subjective than Gerhardt’s and the earlier Lutheran hymns, over one half are in common use. The present hymn, together with “Jesus, priceless treasure” (Jesus, du min Glæde; Jesu, meine Freude) and “Lord, to Thee I make confession” (Herre, jeg har handlet ilde; Herr, ich habe missgehandelt) have been translated into many languages, and are always mentioned among the best church hymns. Franck’s hymns have not the objective character so prominent in the earlier Lutheran church hymns. But they breathe a deep desire for union with Christ, deep piety, and pure, Christian sentiment, and they are characterized by marked pathos and lyric beauty. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nFRANCK, Johann (1618-1677), was the son of Johann Franck, an advocate and councilor at Guben, Brandenburg, where Johann Franck, Jr., was born on June 1, 1618. After his fathers death in 1620, Johann was adopted by his uncle, the town judge Adam Tielckau, who sent him for his education to the schools at Guben, Cottbus Stettin, and Thorn. In 1638 Franck matriculated as student of law at the University of Königsberg, the only German university left undisturbed by the Thirty Years War Here his religious spirit, his love of nature, and his friendship with such men as Simon Dach and Heinrich Held, preserved him from sharing in the excesses of his fellow-students. The former, a pious and prominent professor of poetry, guided the development of Franck’s poetic talent. Upon his mothers request Franck returned to Guben in 1640 to be with her in those times of war during which Guben frequently suffered from the presence of both Swedish and Saxon troops. In May, 1645, Franck commenced practice as a lawyer and very soon became well and favorably known on account of his poetic and professional ability. In 1648 he was elected burgess and councilor and in 1661 burgomaster. In 1671 he was appointed the deputy from Guben to the Landtag (Diet) of Lower Lusatia. His hymns were published as Geistliche Sion, Guben, 1674. On the bicentenary of his death, June 18, 1877, a monumental tablet to his memory was affixed to the outer wall of the Stadtkirche at Guben. Johann Franck is ranked next to Paul Gerhardt as a hymn-writer of his period. Of his 110 hymns, which are more subjective than Gerhardt’s and the earlier Lutheran hymns, over one half are in use. Franck marks the transition from the obiective form of church song prevalent till his time, to the more individual and mystical type His leading idea is the union of the soul with its Savior.

It is supposed that Salomo studied in Jena, after which he occupied a position in Zwickau. In 1689 he served as administration secretary of Arnstadt, and from 1697 and on he held a similar position in Jena. In 1702 he was appointed consistorial secretary, librarian, and curator in his native city, where he died July 11, 1725. Salomo Franck was a member of the so-called “Fruitbearing Society” and author of a series of poems, mostly occasional songs, long since forgotten. His hymns, on the other hand, rank among the best of his time. They are churchly and pervaded by a spirit of deep piety and are characterized by their beautiful forms of expression. Of his 330 hymns a large number are still in use in Germany and in other lands. They are published in his Geistliche Poesie, Weimar, 1685, and in his Geist- und Weltliche Poesie (Vol. I, Jena, 1711; Vol. II, Jena, 1716). At least 8 of his hymns have been translated into English; some of these have received several renderings.

He held several governmental appointments during his life. He also had severe family affIictions to bear. He died at Weimar, July 11, 1725. Franck also wrote much secular poetry. He was a member of the famous Fruit-bearing Society. As a hymn-writer he is distinguished for his ease, correctness, and adaptation to popular understanding and to congregational singing.

During his early years, while under the instruction of his pious mother, the story of the last judgment so impressed him that he often lay awake during the night weeping as he thought of the torments which the condemned had to undergo. At the age of 12 years he was sent to his grandfather, Polenius of Eimbeck, who was a minister. Here he was given intensive training in Bible study and in memorizing hymns, a work which bore good fruit in his later years. During the year 1689, at the university of Jena, he was led by one of his colleagues to study the writings of Luther, Arndt, and Spener. Their works had a decisive influence upon his development. The fame of Francke’s preaching spread also to Jena and, during Easter of 1691, Freylinghausen and some of his friends went to Erfurt to hear him. Francke’s and Breithaupt’s sermons made a deep impression upon him, and he decided to accept an offer from Breithaupt, to reside with him and take employment as family tutor.\n\nThe following year he went with Francke to Halle to complete his studies, and towards the close of 1693 he returned to Gandersheim, where he served for some time as preacher and tutor. In 1695 he became Francke’s assistant at Halle. Here he preached at the vesper services, conducted midweek meetings, taught classes in the orphanage school, and delivered lectures on homiletics to the students. He served in this position without salary until 1715. Francke had to use all his income for the support of his institutions of mercy. But when Francke, in 1715, was called to the pastorate of Ulrichskirche in Halle, Freylinghausen became his successor as pastor for the suburb of Glauka. He was now married to Francke’s only daughter. He had been her sponsor, and she was even named after him, Johanna Anastasia. After Francke’s death he became his successor at the Ulrichskirche and the director of the orphanage “pädagogium.” No one was better qualified to continue Francke’s work. Under his management the “institutions” flourished as never before. But his physical strength was waning. In 1725 he suffered a stroke, which later recurred several times. In 1737 his tongue became paralyzed, so that he could no longer preach. He died February 12, 1739.\n\nFreylinghausen’s essential importance lies in the fact that he was the most eminent hymn writer of the pietistic movement. He wrote 44 hymns. They are all characterized by true Christian feeling, sound, vigorous piety, borne out of deep Christian experience. They are Scriptural and clear, with a rich variety of rhythm, melody, and meter. “Many of his hymns,” says Dr. P. Lange, “are especially marked by confessional purity, sincere feeling, clear thought, and beauty of expression.” He materially aided the cause of church song by compiling and editing large collections of hymns, and by gathering and composing melodies. It was especially through the latter that the pietistic hymns were given their unique character, so very different from the spirit of the choral. Many of these melodies are not suitable for church use. Freylinghausen’s Geistreiches Gesangbuch, containing the best pietistic hymns, besides many older hymns, was published 1704, in Hamburg, and later appeared in many editions. The first edition contains 683 hymns and 173 melodies. Neues Geistreiches Gesangbuch has 815 hymns and 153 melodies. These two collections were combined and published in 1741, by G. A. Francke. The combined volume contained 1,582 hymns and 600 melodies.

In 1695 he became August Herman Francke’s assistant at Glaucha, and when Francke became pastor at St. Ulrich’s, in Halle, 1715, Freylinghausen became his colleague. In the same year he married Francke’s only daughter, Anastasia, whose sponsor he was. After Francke’s death in 1727, he succeeded him as pastor of St. Ulrich’s and Director of Francke’s Institutions. He died February 12, 1739. He published the Geistreiches Gesangbuch, 1704, and Neues Geistreiches Gesangbuch, 1704. He himself composed twenty-two melodies.

His father was Andreas Fritsch, mayor of the town, and his mother was Esther, née Hesse. Ahasverus was the eighth of eleven children. His early youth was spent during the turbulous period of the Thirty Years War. When he was only two years old, his parents had to flee to Voigtland, as their native town was burned. During his youth Fritsch fled from robbers, plunderers, and soldiers; he hid in graves, cellars, and bushes; often he was robbed of the very clothes he was wearing. When he was fourteen, Fritsch lost his father. Nevertheless, his mother sent him to the Gymnasium at Halle. Here he worked manually and intellectually for six years until July, 1650, when he went to Jena and studied under the learned jurist J. Georg Adam Struve. Poverty greatly interrupted his education, but Fritsch finished his course in 1654. In 1657 he became the tutor of the young Count Albert Anton von Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt. He was greatly admired by the count’s family and received various preferments. In October, 1661, he was made a Doctor of Law by the University of Jena. Later he became chancellor of the university and president of the consistory of Rudolstadt. In February of 1662 he married, and his wife. Dorothea Maria, bore him four sons and five daughters. Seven of the children outlived him. Fritsch was a good statesman and the editor of two hymn-collections and a writer on antiquarian, legal, and other subjects. The hymn “Liebster Immanuel, Herzog der Frommen,” is ascribed to him. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n107, 446\n\nFüger, Caspar, d. 1592\n\nFÜGER (Fuger, Fugger), Caspar(?).

He first attended school in Meissen. After having completed his theological studies at the University of Leipzig, he served for a time as his father’s assistant. The story is told that he had to make use of his sermon manuscript in the pulpit, as he could not depend upon his memory. This aroused dissatisfaction and criticism, because the practice of using sermon manuscripts was not in accord with the traditions of the Lutheran Church. Gellert then sought another vocation and resumed his studies at the university. He received his master’s degree in 1744, and the following year was appointed lecturer in the faculty of philosophy, and in 1751, extraordinary professor of philosophy. He lectured on poetry, rhetoric, and moral philosophy. In 1761 he was offered a position as ordinary professor, but declined, since he did not feel strong enough. He always suffered from a weak constitution, and in his later years suffered much from hypochondria. Gellert died in Leipzig December 13, 1769.\n\nAs a teacher and as a man, Gellert was highly esteemed and loved by the students, both on account of his exceptional ability and on account of the keen interest which he showed toward his pupils, among whom were Goethe and Lessing. As an author and hymn writer, he gained considerable fame. His Fables (first series, 1746, second, 1748), spirited and humorous, won him universal recognition and gave him a place among the German classics. He ranks high also as a writer of hymns. He is, indeed, not free from the rationalistic, moralizing tendencies of his age; yet in general his hymns are Scriptural and characterized by deep Christian piety and pathos, in spite of the fact that many of them are more didactic than lyric. He always prepared to write his hymns through fervent prayer. His Geistliche Oden und Lieder mentioned above appeared in many editions, and many of these hymns have been translated into English and other languages. Fifteen of Gellert’s hymns were translated by Birgitte Boye for Guldberg’s Hymnal. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nGELLERT, Christian Fürchtegott (1715-1769), the son of a Lutheran pastor, was born at Hainichen in the Saxon Harz on July 4, 1715. After preliminary schooling at Meissen, he entered the University of Leipzig to pursue theological studies. After his graduation Gellert became an assistant to his father. However, he was forced to turn to some other profession since he had a poor memory and the use of a manuscript in the pulpit was not tolerated in the Lutheran Church in his day. Consequently he became the domestic tutor of the sons of Herr von Lüttichau in 1739, but two years later returned to Leipzig to superintend the studies of a nephew at the university and to resume his own studies. Gellert graduated in 1744 (M. A. ) in the faculty of Belles Lettres. The following year Gellert became private tutor or lecturer in the philosophical faculty. As a professor Gellert was most popular with his students, among whom were Goethe and Lessing. He took a warm interest in his students personal conduct and welfare. His lectures were much favored, not only because of their charm of style, but also because of their substance and high moral tone. Gellert’s Fables, spirited and humorous, won him fame and universal recognition as a German classicist. In 1751 he was appointed extraordinary professor of philosophy, and in this capacity he lectured on poetry, rhetoric, and moral philosophy. Ten years later he was offered an ordinary professorship, but declined because of ill health, having had a delicate constitution since childhood. After 1752 Gellert suffered greatly from hypochondria and died at Leipzig on December 13, 1769. [Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n353\n\nGeneral Selection of Spiritual Songs, Lynchburg, 1811\n\n306\n\nGerhardt, Paul, 1607-76\n\nPaul Gerhardt was born March 12, 1607, in Gräfenhaynichen, a village between Halle and Wittenberg. His father, Christian Gerhardt, who was mayor of the village, died before Paul had reached maturity. Paul Gerhardt’s youth was spent under the stress and suffering of the Thirty Years’ War. Otherwise there is little of note to relate from his early life. From 1622-1627 he attended school at Grimma. On the 2nd of January, 1628, he began the study of theology at the university of Wittenberg. This was in his twenty-first year. There is reason to suppose that he remained in Berlin until the first part of the year 1642; but there is very little reliable information on this period of his life. Germany was desolate and depopulated, and many of the younger theologians had to wait a long time before they could enter the active ministry. Thus Paul Gerhardt served for a number of years as family tutor in the home of Andreas Berthold, an attorney in Berlin. In the Christian atmosphere his gift of song began to develop and bear fruit. Many of his hymns were published in 1648 in Johann Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica. Crüger was cantor and director of music in the church of St. Nicholas, where Gerhardt frequently preached. In 1651 he was called to Mittenwalde, a little town near Berlin, and entered upon his duties there the following year. Four years later he married Anna Maria Berthold. Their first child—a daughter—died in infancy. His office in Mittenwalde brought him only a scant income. Further, he experienced much unpleasantness from his colleague, deacon Allhorn, who was jealous of Gerhardt because he had been selected to the office of provost in preference to himself. Hence, Gerhardt gladly accepted the call from Berlin, in 1657, to become third assistant pastor of the church of St. Nicholas. His activity in Berlin gave him an opportunity to unfold his unusual gifts. He continued to write hymns. He was recognized as the most popular preacher in the city and gathered large audiences at his services. He also became famous for his philanthropy. He gave assistance to all the needy who came to his door. He was of a kindly temperament and bore up cheerfully under all trials. But he was also a most conscientious minister in matters of doctrine and confession.\n\nAt this time Prussia was ruled by Elector Friedrich Wilhelm the Great. The majority of the people were Lutherans, but the ruler himself was a Calvinist. There was bitter opposition between the ministers of the two churches, and they condemned each other’s doctrine in the most violent terms. Gerhardt, although as faithful and ardent a Lutheran as any one, used more moderate language, for which he gained the respect and esteem of many of the leaders among the Reformed, among whom may be mentioned Duchess Louise. The elector arranged conferences between the leading men of both parties in an attempt to bring about more unity or at least greater tolerance; but this did not bring the desired results. He became impatient and issued an edict forbidding the ministers to attack each other’s doctrine and confession, and later he required all the Lutheran ministers to sign a document compelling them to follow the order of the edict. No Lutheran minister who wished to remain true to his confession could agree to this. Several were thus compelled to leave their charges. Gerhardt, who was sick at the time, summoned the ministers of Berlin to his bedside and admonished them to stand firm and not to yield to the demands of the elector.\n\nOn the 9th of February, 1666, Gerhardt was called before the consistory and asked to sign the famous document. He was given one week’s time to consider the matter; but even before the meeting adjourned he declared that his decision in the matter would not be changed. Following this announcement, Gerhardt was deposed from his office. This caused great consternation and sorrow among his towns-people. Gerhardt, however, retained his calmness of mind and referred to the incident as his “Berlin martyrdom.” The matter became more serious when the authorities prohibited him even from conducting private meetings for worship in his own house. This grieved him very much. But other sorrows followed fast. At an earlier period he had lost three of his five children. During this time of trial one of his sons also died and his wife became seriously ill.\n\nThe Lutherans of Berlin disliked very much to see their beloved pastor deposed in this manner. Many petitions were sent to the elector by the citizens, by the laborers, by the town council, and even by the wife of the elector. The elector assumed a more favorable attitude towards Gerhardt, and January 9, 1667, he ordered him reinstated. But this did not make matters very much better. The messenger who brought in the news brought also an oral greeting from the elector, which expressed his conviction that Gerhardt, who was known for his moderation, would be able to appear and preach in harmony with the before mentioned edict of the elector. To agree to this would be just as binding upon his conscience as though he had signed the edict. This he expressed in writing to the magistrates as follows: “Whatever is done with a bad conscience, it is an abomination in the eyes of God and brings no blessing, but rather a curse upon the doer; neither I myself nor my congregation will be served in this manner.” Then, in 1667, the elector appointed a successor; but this preacher could not take up the work until the latter part of the following year, and until that time Gerhardt received the income from the office. After this he was supported by a number of charitable members of his congregation. His wife died at Eastertide, 1668. Only a son, six years of age, now remained with him. In May, 1669, he was called to the office of archdeacon of Lübben. He labored here for seven years with great success. Gerhardt died June 7, 1676. Here, in the latter period of his life, he found much comfort in the eighth verse of the hymn composed by himself: “Warum sollt’ ich mich denn grämen,” “Døden kan os ikke døde,” “Death cannot destroy forever” (L. H. 342, 4).\n\nDeath cannot destroy forever: From our fears, Cares and tears, Soon shall it deliver. Doors of grief and gloom it closes, While the soul, Free and whole, With the saints reposes.\n\nA life-size painting of Gerhardt has been placed in the church of Lübben. The painting has this inscription: Theologus in cribro Satanae versatus (A theologian sifted in the sieve of Satan). Paul Gerhardt was an excellent pastor and one of the best, if not the best one, of the hymn writers of Germany. In the upbuilding of the German-Protestant Church Paul Gerhardt ranks second only to Luther as a hymnist. Wackernagel says: “In regard to their spiritual value, the hymns of Paul Gerhardt may be viewed from two opposite angles. His poems seem to reflect the transitional character of his times. His own subjective spiritual life began to assert itself besides giving expression to the Christian consciousness of the congregation. Thus he may be regarded as the last and at the same time the best of those poets who were rooted in confessional Christianity. Gerhardt concludes the list of ‘church poets’.” In conclusion we quote the following from Rudelbach: “Together with Paul Gerhardt, who on account of his faithfulness toward the Lutheran confession suffered himself to be deposed from office, all Lutheran Christians join in song, whether it be his hymns for children or his Christmas hymns—which in spirit rank beside those of Luther—or the hymns of sorrow and comfort at the cross of Christ, or hymns of prayer for the Holy Spirit, or when he appears on the side of God as the soldier of Christ and joyfully brings to others the comfort which the Lord has given unto him, or when he meditates upon Christian life, its beginning, progress and end, as it rests in the hand of God.”\n\nPaul Gerhardt possesses a certain poetic richness, which by no means can be referred to his poetic individuality alone. It finds its fullest explanation only in the sincere Lutheran spirit with which he was imbued. It is by no means the case, as some of the modern writers have thought, that he was lacking in traditional Lutheran force; indeed, as the Thirty Years’ War, which in its campaigns and results brought so much suffering, produced many spiritual heroes, who took on the armor of the Lord; thus also Gerhardt, who himself had experienced many sufferings, took the harp of Zion and sang with a loud voice as follows:\n\nNot fire, nor sword, nor thunder, Shall sever me from Thee; Though earth be rent asunder Thou’rt mine eternally: Not hunger, thirst, nor danger, Not pain, nor pinching want, Nor mighty princes’ anger, My fearless soul shall daunt.\n\nNo angel, and no gladness, No throne, no pomp, no show, No love, no hate, no sadness, No pain, no depth of woe, No scheme of man’s contrivance, Though it be great or small, Shall draw me from Thy guidance— Not one of these, nor all! [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nGERHARDT, Paul (1607-1676). In the Lutheran church at Luebden in Germany there hangs a life-size painting of Paul Gerhardt. Beneath it is the inscription: “Theologus in cribro Satanae versatus” (A divine sifted in Satan’s sieve). That inscription may be said to epitomize the sad life-story of Germany’s great psalmist. Paul Gerhardt was born on March 12, 1607, in Gräfenhaynichen, a village between Halle and Wittenberg. His father was Christian Gerhardt, mayor of the village. He died before Paul reached maturity. During his youth Paul experienced much suffering because of the Thirty Years War that was raging. From 1622 to 1627 he attended school at Grimma. On January 2, 1628, he began the study of theology at the University of Wittenberg, where he remained until at least April, 1642, and then went to Berlin, where he became family tutor in the home of Andreas Barthold, an attorney. Here in a Christian atmosphere his gift of song began to develop and bear fruit. Many of Gerhardt’s hymns were published in 1648 in Johann Crüger’s Praxis Pietatis Melica (q. v.). In 1651 Gerhardt was called to Mittenwalde as provost. When he started his duties of his first settled position, Gerhardt was forty-four years old. Four years later he married Anna Maria Berthold. Their first child, a daughter, died in infancy. The income of the family was sparse. Gerhardt also experienced unpleasantness because of the jealousy of a colleague. In 1657 Gerhardt accepted a call to be third assistant pastor of the Church of St. Nicholas in Berlin. Here he continued to write hymns. Gerhardt was recognized as the most popular preacher in the city. Later he became known also for his philanthropy. At this time there was bitter opposition between the Lutherans and the Calvinists. Since Gerhardt was not as violent as others in condemning the opposition, he gained the respect and esteem of many of the leaders of the Reformed group, including the Duchess Louise. The elector Friedrich Wilhelm the Great, a Calvinist, arranged conferences between the leading men of both parties. But all such attempts failed, and finally the elector issued an edict forbidding ministers to attack each others doctrine and confession. Later he required all the Lutheran ministers to sign a document compelling them to follow the order of the edict. No Lutheran minister who wished to remain true to his confession could agree to this. Gerhardt believed that signing the document would be to compromise the faith. He was sick at the time, but nevertheless he summoned the Lutheran ministers to his bedside and admonished them to stand firm and not to yield to the demands of the elector. On February 9, 1666, Gerhardt was called before his own consistory and asked to sign the famous document. He was given a week in which to consider the matter, but he immediately said that he would not sign. Gerhardt was then deposed from office and even prohibited from conducting private meetings for worship in his own house. Gerhardt called this his Berlin martyrdom. Just before this unfortunate occurrence he had lost three of his five children, and now a son died, and his wife was seriously ill. Petitions from citizens, laborers, the town council, and even from the wife of the elector led the elector to reinstate Gerhardt on January 9, 1667. But the elector had done this with the understanding that Gerhardt would preach in harmony with the aforementioned edict. Under such a condition Gerhardt refused. In the same year the elector appointed Gerhardt’s successor. As he did not take up his work until late in 1668, Gerhardt received the income from the office until then. After that he was supported by charitable members of his congregation. Gerhardt’s wife died at Eastertide, 1668. Now only a son, aged six, remained. In May, 1669, Gerhardt was called to the offlce of archdeacon of Lübben. Here he labored for seven years with success until his death. Paul Gerhardt was an excellent pastor and one of the best, if not the best, of the hymn-writers of the Lutheran Church in Germany. He wrote 133 hymns in all. Not even the hymns of Martin Luther are used so generally throughout the Christian world as are those of Gerhardt. More of the beautiful lyrics of this sweet singer have found their way into the English language than the hymns of any other German hymn-writer, and with the passing of years their popularity increases rather than diminishes. In Gerhardt’s hymns is found the transition to the modern subjective note in hymnody. He died at Lübben, June 7, 1676.

He was born in Constantinople and was a member of a noble family. He became Bishop of Cyzicus and later took part in the Synod of Constantinople (712), which adopted a resolution favoring Monothelitism (Monothelites, a sect which taught that Christ had two natures, but one will, the divine). But St. Germanus later condemned this doctrine. In 715 he was made patriarch of Constantinople. Despite vigorous opposition to the contrary, he was removed from this office in 730 by the iconoclastic emperor, Leo the Isaurian. Shortly afterwards he died at the age of 100 years. A number of his hymns have been translated into English by Dr. J. M. Neale. Among these the present hymn was included in his Hymns of the Eastern Church, 1862. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nSt. Germanus of Constantinople, (634-734), was born in Constantinople of a patrician family. He was ordained there and subsequently became the Bishop of Cyzicus. He was present at the Synod of Constantinople in 712, which restored the Monothelite heresy, but in after years he condemned the heresy. In 715 he was made the Patriarch of Constantinople. In 730 St. Germanus was driven from that see, not without blows, for refusing to yield to the Iconoclastic Emperor, Leo III, the Isaurian.

He died there in poverty in 1796. Giardini composed a great number of operas, quartets, concertos, sonatas, and other pieces.

He studied in Leipzig, where he afterwards was appointed teacher at the Thomas-Schule. During the disputation of 1519 between Eck, Luther, and Carlstadt, Graumann served as a loyal Catholic on Eck’s side. But this disputation brought on him a doubt as to the correctness of his position, and this for two reasons: he was struck by the fact that Luther always supported his opinions with references to the Holy Scriptures; in the second place, he was moved by Luther’s strong appeal to the dictates of conscience rather than by Eck’s cleverness in the art of disputation. As Graumann often had occasion to preach, his sermons from now on became more and more Lutheran. In 1520 he was appointed rector of the Thomas-Schule. But he nourished a strong desire to leave Leipzig and go to Wittenberg, all the more now because his activities in the interest of the Reformation had brought on strained relations with the Catholic duke, George of Saxony. In 1522, after having found one who could take his place as rector of the Thomas-Schule, he went to Luther and Melanchthon at Wittenberg.\n\nThe following year he was made a preacher in the Bavarian town of Würtzburg am Main. There he served for two years, until 1523, when the Peasants’ War broke out and spread into those parts. Graumann moved to Nürnberg. But Luther, the same year, induced him to go to Königsberg, where he assisted John Briesmann in furthering the cause of the Reformation in the province of Count Albrecht of Brandenburg. Graumann also reorganized the school system of Brandenburg. The count appointed him preacher in the Altstädt church of Königsberg. There he not only gathered a large number of hearers, but he showed that he was fearless in his proclamation of the Gospel truths, and braved even the risk of incurring the displeasure of the count. It came about in this manner. Anabaptist doctrines had gained favor with many congregations and preachers, and, although their leader was an intimate friend of the elector, still Graumann sharply attacked him. The count decided that the two parties should meet for a public disputation, and the victorious doctrine should be given the right of way in the land. At the disputation Graumann was victorious. No matter how cleverly the Anabaptists advanced their proofs, Graumann, with clear and direct Scripture statements, refuted all their arguments and silenced all his opponents. In that manner the province was saved from the Anabaptist domination. Graumann died in the year 1541 from a stroke of paralysis at the age of 54. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nGRAMANN (Graumann), Johann (Poliander) (1487-1541), was born in Neustadt, in the Bavarian Palatinate, on July 5, 1487. After he finished his studies at Leipzig (M. A. 1516; B. D. 1520), he was appointed rector of the St. Thomas’s School in Leipzig. In 1519 he attended the disputation between Eck, Luther, and Carlstadt as the amanuensis of Eck. After the disputation Gramann espoused the cause of the Reformation, because he noticed that Luther supported his opinions with references to Scripture, and he was moved by Luther’s strong appeal to the dictates of conscience, rather than by Eck’s cleverness in the art of disputation. He decided to leave Leipzig because of strained relations with the Catholic duke, George of Saxony, and went to Wittenberg to join Luther and Melanchthon. In 1523 he was appointed preacher at Würzburg. At the outbreak of the Peasants War in 1525, he went to Nürnberg and was appointed preacher to the nunnery of St. Clara in that city. Upon Luther’s recommendation he was called by the Margrave Albrecht of Brandenburg to come to the Margrave’s province and to assist the cause of the Reformation there. In this work he assisted John Briesmann. Gramann became pastor of the Altstadt church in Königsberg in October, 1525. Later he incurred the displeasure of the count by opposing the Anabaptists, who had gained favor with the count and the people of the congregation. In a public disputation ordered by the count, Gramann successfully refuted the Anabaptists on the basis of Scripture and saved the province from this false doctrine. He also opposed the Schwenckfeldians and was active in organizing the evangelical schools of the province. Gramann died at Königsberg on April 29, 1541.

Grant ranks high as a writer of hymns. His hymns are characterized by grace and beauty of style, and intense religious feeling. The two hymns which have been included in The Lutheran Hymnary are sung wherever the English language is used. [Dahle, Library of Christian Hymns]\n\nGRANT, Sir Robert (1779-1838), the second son of Charles Grant, M. P., and a director of the East India Company, was born in Bengal, India. When Robert was six years old, the family moved to London. He was educated at Magdalen College, Cambridge, and called to the English Bar in 1807. In 1826, as his father had been Grant became M. P. for Inverness. While in Parliament, he introduced a bill to remove restrictions imposed upon the Jews. The historian Macaulay made his maiden speech in Parliament in support of this measure. In 1831 Grant became a privy councilor, in 1832 Judge Advocate General, and two years later was appointed Governor of Bombay, being knighted at the same time. Grant died at Dalpoorie Western India, where a medical college bearing his name has been erected as a memorial to him. Grant wrote twelve hymns; they were published posthumously by his brother, Lord Glenelg, in 1839 under the title Sacred Poems.

His great-grandfather, Alexander Greig, emigrated from Scotland to Norway after the battle of Culloden (1745) and changed his name to Grieg. His father was British consul at Bergen. He married Gesine Judith Hagerup a descendant of Kjeld Stub, from whom Edvard inherited his musical talent. At the advice of Ole Bull, Edvard was sent to the Leipzig Conservatory at the age of fifteen. He studied under Plaidy, Wenzel, Moscheles, E. F. Richter, Hauptmann, and Reinecke. From Leipzig he went to Copenhagen, where he studied under Niels Gade and Emil Hartmann. From 1864 on he was active at Copenhagen and Christiania, conducting, composing, and teaching. He married his cousin Nin Hagerup in 1867. An excellent vocalist, she helped gain favor for his songs. When Franz Liszt became interested in Grieg, the Norwegian government gave him financial aid to go to Rome, and Liszt’s advice helped him to persevere in his efforts to use his genius in the interest of Northern music. Grieg did for Norway what Chopin did for Poland, Liszt for Hungary, and Dvorak for Bohemia: He created a new national art. He died suddenly Sept. 4, 1907, while boarding a steamer which was to take him to London to fill some concert engagements.

Grigg is said to have begun the writing of hymns at the age of 10 years. The hymn was published by the author in 1765 as one of his Four Hymns on Divine Subjects wherein the Patience and Love of our Divine Savior is displayed. It has later been revised by many, among whom may be mentioned Benjamin Francis in Rippon’s Baptist Selection, 1787. The melody (Federal Street) was composed by Henry Kemble Oliver (b. 1800 in Mass.; d. Boston, 1885).\n\nJoseph Grigg, born 1728, was a son of poor parents and was educated for mechanical pursuits.—In 1743 he gave up this work and became assistant pastor to Rev. Thomas Bures of Silver Street Presbyterian Church in London. When Pastor Bures died, in 1747, Grigg retired from the ministry, married a wealthy lady, and went to reside in St. Albans. He died October 29, 1768, in Walthamstow, Essex. Grigg wrote a number of religious treatises, and several of his hymns are found among these. His hymns were published in 1861, under the title, Hymns on Divine Subjects, edited by D. Sedgwick, London. The present hymn, together with “Behold a stranger at the door,” have gained great favor and are extensively used.

[Handbook to the Lutheran Hymnal]\n\n140\n\nGrundtvig, Nicolai Frederik Severin, 1783-1872\n\nNikolai Fredrik Severin Grundtvig was born September 8, 1783, in Udby, near Vordingborg, Denmark. His father, grandfather, and great-grandfather were ministers. Through his mother he descended from the famous Hvid family. His father was one of the very few ministers of Denmark who did not join the rationalist ranks, but remained true to the Gospel of Christ. In the childhood home the ruling spirit was that of the good old orthodox piety, and Luther was his hero; but in the church and school the doctrine of reason reigned supreme, so that as Grundtvig grew up he was bound to be influenced by it At the age of nine he was sent to a minister in Jylland to be educated. Here he read Saxo’s works, Snorre, Holberg’s historical writings, and all sorts of old folklore. Suhm’s book on Odin and Heathen Mythology especially awakened his interest for Northern mythology. He read aloud to the workmen in the shoe shop in the house where he resided. In that way he became familiar with the old Danish popular stories and fables. He began even then to write poetry. After two years’ study he passed the examen artium, 1800—the same year as Oehlenschlager—and three years later he took the examination for the office of the ministry. During the last year of his study he grew wholly indifferent toward religion. He says himself that he ended his academic career without spirit and without faith. But he had also received impressions in another direction. His cousin, Henrik Steffens, lectured on natural philosophy and poetry, among other subjects, also Goethe, “the only class he truly appreciated.” Steffens showed him the importance of history and gave him a poetic insight into the beauty and glory of true Christianity as contrasted with a Christianity based on reason. The idea of a connection between the various periods of history and of Christ as the central fact of all history made a profound impression upon Grundtvig. He gained greater clearness on this subject during his three-year service as family tutor in Langeland. In his spare time he read Shakespeare, Goethe, Schiller, Fichte, Schelling, and others, and studied Old Norse language and literature. In 1807 he wrote his first theological treatise on Religion and Liturgics, in connection with certain proposed changes in the liturgy of the Danish church. His intense study of this romantic literature and also an unfortunate experience in love affairs stirred the chords of his heart. He also passed through another crisis during this time which brought him to a deeper appreciation of Christianity and history. Oehlenschlager’s Nordiske Digte and Vaulunders Saga aroused Grundtvig’s interest in the ancient glory of the people of the Northern countries, and from now on he wrote several articles on the Edda Sagas and on Old Norse Mythology. In 1808 he returned to Copenhagen where he sought a professorship at the university. In the meantime he was appointed teacher of history in one of the Copenhagen schools. During the same year he published Northern Mythology or the Religion of the Eddas. In 1810 Scenes from the Northland; Life among the Giants. The first represents the romantic conception of mythology as the poetic-symbolic garb of thought given to the popular view of life. It marks a turning-point in mythological research. In the second work Grundtvig desired to stir up his indifferent generation to a realization of the glory of the past. Both were the products of his enthusiasm for the ancient glory of the Northern countries, a characteristic which never left him. As he busied himself with history and mythology his attention was more and more drawn towards true historic Christianity, and his relation of opposition to rationalism became more pronounced. Then, in 1810, he delivered his famous probational sermon in Copenhagen. His text was Why Has the Word of God Departed from His House? In this sermon he violently attacked the spirit of the times which had put the thoughts and commandments of men in place of the saving Gospel of Jesus Christ. This sermon was printed and caused a great stir. The clergymen of the capital sent in a protest against it, and Grundtvig was called to appear before the consistory of the university. The government board of justice (kancelli) decided that he should receive a reprimand, because, by having his sermon printed, he had betrayed a vain desire for publicity. But all this only served to force Grundtvig deeper and deeper into the study of Christianity. He was now more determined than ever to keep aloof from the popular philosophy of Schelling. In a little volume of poems, New Year’s Eve, 1811, he tells the story of his experiences, how he had learned to distinguish poetry and philosophical research from the truly religious, and that he now had arrived upon true Christian ground and had come to a personal faith in Christ. The spiritual struggle which he had gone through had so far undermined his health that he now sought relief by going home to his father’s parsonage. In the dedication of New Year’s Eve he announces his future program as follows:\n\nHvad er Kløgt, og hvad er alt paa Jord mod det rene, klare Guddomsord! Derfor skal min Sang nu ene tone til hans Pris som steg fra Himlen ned, som os vilde med vor Gud forsone, skjænke os en salig Evighed.\n\nHe who had “thought it possible to approach God with giant strides, and not through humble penitence”; he who had “dreamt of accomplishing heroic deeds for the glory of his faith”; he who “had, indeed, been deeply stirred with enthusiasm for Christianity as the greatest spiritual power in the world,” but “who had not yet beheld the cross”; he “who had spurned the thought of becoming a village pastor” —now desired nothing more than to become his father’s assistant. This was granted to him in 1811. In the tranquillity of his childhood home he regained his peace of heart. In 1812 he published A Short Summary of World’s Events, which drew much attention and considerable discussion. After his father’s death he returned to Copenhagen, where he led a lonely life among his books and a few friends, among whom may be mentioned the poet Ingemann. At times he was given an opportunity to preach. His sermons always dealt with the contrast between faith and unbelief, between the world and the Church. Hence, he was called a fanatic and mysticist, and one by one the churches were denied him. Finally, only the Fredriksberg church remained open to him. Here, in 1816, he delivered a series of Biblical Sermons. At the same time he carried on his literary efforts on a large scale. Among other publications should be mentioned, Bible Chronicle, Roskilde Poems, and Roskilde Saga, Little Songs, besides editing the periodical Dannevirke from 1816 to 1819. In this latter publication he continued his attacks upon the rationalistic philosophers of his time and pointed to history as the great and all-embracing proof of the truth of Christianity. This thought he developed more fully in Survey of World Events, especially during the Lutheran era, published 1817. In 1818-1822 his translations of Saxo and Snorre appeared. He also found time to study English language and literature, and in 1820 he published a free translation of Beowulf. Without application Grundtvig was called to the pastorate of Prestø, south Sjælland, 1821, but it was his firm desire to labor in the capital city, “that city, from which unbelief was spreading over the land and from which all good movements ought to go out.” At his own urgent request he was appointed assistant in Our Savior’s Church, Kristianshavn, 1822. It appeared during that period that the dawn of a new day had come in Europe. The war of independence in Greece heralded a new era. And Grundtvig, who “felt the powers of a new morn,” wrote New Year’s Morn, 1824, which has been mentioned as “a mighty poem.” In the prelude he sent the following greeting to the peoples of the North:\n\nGuds Fred, hvor I bygge Paa Mark og paa Fjeld, I Bøgenes Skygge, Ved Elvenes Væld! Guds Fred over Skoven, Hvor Stammene staa. Guds Fred over Voven, Hvor Snækkene gaa, Som ankre, som flage Paa festlige Dage, Som end tone Fædrenes Flag.\n\nGuds Fred, som den fandtes I Fædrenes Barm, Guds Fred, som den vandtes Ved Frelserens arm, Guds Fred, som den troner, Hvor Kjærlighet bor, Guds Fred, som den toner I Hytter av Jord, Som selv jeg den nyder, Tilønsker og byder Jeg Brødre og Frænder i Nord.\n\nDuring the summer of 1825 Professor H. N. Clausen published his The Constitution, Doctrine, and Ritual of the Catholic and the Protestant Churches. A few weeks later Grundtvig issued Kirkens Gjenmæle (The Reply of the Church), in which he charged Clausen with false doctrine and demanded that he either retract or resign from his position as teacher. This article caused an extraordinary sensation. It appeared in three editions within a short time. Clausen, however, did not enter into arguments with Grundtvig, but took occasion, from the virulent expressions in the article, to sue him for libel. Grundtvig was found guilty and had to pay a fine and the costs of the trial. Even before the judgment was announced he resigned from his office, in 1826. In memory of his pastoral work he published Christian Sermons and Sunday Book.\n\nBut during this time Grundtvig’s “views on the Church” took definite form. He took a firm stand on the baptismal confession of faith. For over a thousand years the Christian congregation had required that all who desired to become members should make this good confession, i. e., the renunciation and the confession. Hence, he reasoned this must be the sum and substance of all Christianity, and the requirements for admission to the Christian congregation must have been laid down by Christ Himself. Thus, the confession is a word from the Lord’s own mouth; Baptism as the life-giving sacrament, and the Lord’s Supper as the life-sustaining, furnish the fountain of all Christian life.,, In close connection lies his conception of the living (oral) word and the dead (written). Spiritual life can be transmitted only by means of the “living” word; Jesus Christ, the Word who became flesh, still lives in His congregation, in His institutions, and in the words of the sacraments. The Holy Scriptures are an indispensable book of information, but they are only a description of Christ and His work, they do not bring us Christ Himself. Together with Rudelbach he had, in 1825, founded the Theological Monthly, and through a series of essays in this magazine he now sought to develop and establish his views on the Church. During the years 1829-1831, being furnished an allowance from the Danish king, he made several trips to England for the purpose of studying the old manuscripts of Anglo-Saxon literature, which, up to that time, had not been published. In fact, Grundtvig’s work gave impetus to the work of their publication. But these visits to England had great influence upon Grundtvig in another line. He was deeply impressed by the spirit of liberty enjoyed by the people of England. It taught him “with respect of freedom, as well as all other human agencies, to emphasize realities. with deep disdain for the empty theories of quill-drivers and bookworms.”\n\nHis desire now was to work for the development of a free and vigorous civil life. In 1832 he published Northern Mythology or Emblematic Language, one of the most brilliant books in Danish literature. He considers the myths as emblematic, figurative representations of the moral views of the people, and that “they are prophetic of the future of the nation.” In a series of essays he draws a comparison between the moral views of the Greeks and those of the peoples of the Northern lands. In 1829 he published A Handbook of History According to the Best Sources.\n\nHis historical lectures in Borch’s College, 1838, made a great sensation and were heard by a large circle of influential men. But Grundtvig was in close touch with his age also in another connection. He was, indeed, without regular employment as pastor until 1839, but not without pastoral work. In March, 1832, he wa"
