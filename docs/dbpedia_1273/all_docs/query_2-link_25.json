        "text": "The authors of both the first and third Gospels, by insisting on both Jesus’ divine paternity and his Davidic descent, pose a conundrum: if Jesus was not Joseph’s biological son, in what sense is he the Davidic Messiah? Most modern scholars assume that Joseph must have adopted Jesus in some form or another, thus giving him Davidic status, and many even point to such adoption as a ‘Jewish custom’. This article examines this assumption and shows that adoption was unknown in Jewish law of the period. Furthermore, such adoption was well known in Roman law, especially among the aristocracy. In the case of such emperors as Augustus, whose adoptive fathers had been deified posthumously, this gave them the status of divi filius, ‘son of god’. The inclusion of such a Roman concept into the Gospels may be an indication of the Gentile, rather than Jewish, cultural backgrounds of the evangelists.\n\nThis paper considers how Roman legal and social approaches to new citizens informed aspects of Palestinian rabbinic halakhah regarding converts. This discussion focuses on legal relations between converts and their offspring who were born (or even conceived) prior to their parents’ conversion, including those who joined Israel with one or both parents. According to tannaitic sources, even if they converted together, family ties between children and their father were severed upon his conversion, so they were no longer deemed his heirs. Striking parallels between Roman law regarding new citizens (such as Gaius, Institutes, 1.93-94; 3.19-20) and nearly contemporaneous tannaitic material on the status of converts seem to reflect an internalization of specific features of the legal status of new Roman citizens that were then applied to converts in tannaitic halakhah: 1) Fathers who became new Roman citizens or Israelite converts effectively ceded authority over any children who were born (or conceived) prior to acquiring their new status. 2) Roman legislation associates a father’s loss of paternal authority upon gaining citizenship with his children’s loss of status as heirs, much like tannaitic texts. 3) If a couple is granted citizenship or become converts while the wife is pregnant, that child is then born as a Roman or Jew, respectively, although all legal ties with the father are severed. These examples signal that, in both legal corpora, a father (and, by extension, his children) pays an economic price for becoming a “citizen.” Although rabbinic and Roman law articulate these regulations somewhat differently and focus on distinctive legal concerns, the correspondence between these two legal frameworks is too strong to be mere coincidence, especially since this subject has no biblical antecedent. This case leads us to examine once more the relationship between Roman and rabbinic law and to consider the possibility that tannaitic literature viewed converts as “new citizens” in Israel.\n\nIn the question, &quot;How do the scribes say the messiah is David&#39;s son?&quot;, Jesus challenged a specifically scribal messianic expectation and refused to associate himself with it. On the other hand, he embraced the characterization &quot;David&#39;s son&quot;, with its overtones of Solomonic wisdom and especially of exorcistic and therapeutic skill. The question itself represents Jesus&#39; attempt to evade the charge that he had messianic pretensions. His reputation as &quot;David&#39;s son&quot;, however, and his activity in the Temple, made it impossible for him long to forestall the coalition of opponents who believed that he had such pretensions and that they were dangerous."
