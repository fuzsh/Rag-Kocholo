        "text": "Although several scholars have explored the issue of commercial and artistic relationships between Nuremberg and Breslau, the multidimensional phenomenon of artists’ mobility between the banks of the Pegnitz and the Oder in the 15th and the 16th centuries has received little attention. Taking into account the vast number of networks – especially commercial, family, ecclesiastical, and monastery ties – that determined and facilitated the migration in question, especially among painters and goldsmiths, it turns out that the presence of numerous merchants in Breslau who were originally from Nuremberg had little impact on this particular mobility. Nevertheless, almost every case of artists’ mobility discussed was anything but coincidental, taking place within the framework of dense networks. Moreover, it becomes clear that the social position of artists from particular crafts was closely related to their mobility – more affluent and appreciated by their patrons, goldsmiths migrated more frequently than painters.\n\nThe culture at the ducal court of Sigmund and Albrecht IV of Bavaria-Munich was characterised by a coexistence of traditional as well as novel concepts and interests, which were expressed in the dukes’ artistic, architectural and literary patronage. Apart from examining the orthodox means of aristocratic self-aggrandizement like jousting, clothes, decorative arts and precious, exotic objects, this thesis discusses ‘innovative’ tendencies like the forward-looking application of retrospective motifs, historicising styles as well as the dukes’ genealogy, the ducal government’s imprint on the territory and the aesthetic qualities of the landscape. The study of a selection of buildings and works of art with the methodologies of the stylistic analysis, iconology and social history emphasises the conceptual relations between the ducal court’s various cultural products, which were conceived as ensembles and complemented each other. The elucidation of their meanings to contemporaries and the patrons’ intentions is substantiated with statements in contemporary written sources like travel reports, chronicles and the ducal court’s literary commissions. The principal chapters explore three thematic strands that are idiosyncratic for the culture at the court of Sigmund and Albrecht IV between 1460 and 1508, because they were consistently realised in several buildings and works of art. The first chapter provides an overview of the history of Munich, the Duchy of Bavaria and the Wittelsbach dynasty. The second chapter explores the princely self-conception at the threshold of the Late Middle Ages and the Early Modern Era by considering the application of clothes, decorative arts, knightly skills, exotic animals, and monuments of the patrons’ erudition as means of social communication and differentiation. The third chapter considers the dukes’ awareness as well as ‘manipulation’ of their genealogy and history as a forward-looking means for legitimating and realising their political objectives. It also examines the symbolism and origins of historicising motifs in art and architecture like the Church of Our Lady’s bulbous domes that acted as markers of the ducal sepulchre. The fourth chapter scrutinizes the impact of the dukes’ government and artistic as well as architectural patronage on their territory. It also considers emergence of poly-focal panoramic views from the interiors of castle and palaces into the surrounding countryside by examining the origins of this phenomenon and the perception of the landscape’s aesthetic qualities.\n\nIn the history of Breslau (Wrocław) art, the sixteenth century is marked by an increased interest in currents flowing mainly from Italy, the Netherlands and Rudolfian Prague, as well as growth in the number of recorded migrations of artists. These should not, however, obscure the fact that the commercial, familial and ecclesiastical ties connecting Breslau and Nuremberg, established in the thirteenth and tightened in the fifteenth century, which after the Hussite Wars had become an important catalyst of artistic migrations and played a significant role in the shaping of the Late Gothic art in Silesia, did not break in the early modern period. On the contrary, those bonds and networks solidified, became part of daily life, and at the same time remained an important factor, albeit not the sole one, in the process of migration of artists, especially goldsmiths and painters, between Breslau and Nuremberg. Undoubtedly, this process rested on two basic pillars: extensive family networks of the migrant artists and the support of wealthy patrons. Economic and political relationships between both cities seem to be important in this process too, but they were nevertheless secondary. The role of guild regulations should also not be overlooked, as the lack of strict control helped some artists to spread their wings, whereas restrictions provided the more talented and self-confident painters with an incentive for migration. Nonetheless, Breslau guild regulations did not prevent foreign artists from arriving and staying in Silesia. Finally, the exchange of artists and some artistic inspirations between Nuremberg and Breslau in the sixteenth century was undoubtedly influenced by the same political, social and confessional processes which both cities, governed by influential, wealthy and Protestant middle class, had to face."
