March

2nd - Destination of convoy changed to Bombay and Colombo. Detached from DM3 and took passage to Colombo with designated mercantiles.

4th - On arrival at Colombo detached from DM3 to join ships of East Indies Squadron.

7th - Sailed from Colombo for Trincomalee. (Vice Admiral Somerville arrived at Colombo at 0800/26/3/42 and assumed command of the Eastern Fleet. His first task was to evaluate his assets. These he found to be a mixed collection of old and new and without fleet battle training. His immediate decision was to split his Fleet into two Forces, a fast force, Force A and a slow force, Force B)

26th - Sailed from Ceylon in company with battleships RESOLUTION, REVENGE and ROYAL SOVEREIGN, forming the 3rd Battle Squadron, to carry out tactical and gunnery exercises at Addu Atoll.

28th - (Somerville was informed that a Japanese attack against Ceylon was to be expected on or about 1/4/42. Somerville, now on board his flagship battleship WARSPITE resolved to take the fleet to sea to meet the threat. All ships of the Eastern Fleet were therefore ordered to RV to the south of Ceylon)

29th - Sailed from Addu Atoll in company with battleships RESOLUTION, REVENGE, ROYAL SOVEREIGN and aircraft carrier INDOMITABLE.

31st - Off the south coast of Ceylon Force A and B of the Eastern Fleet RVed at 04.40N 81,00E. RAMILLIES formed part of Force B which also included battleships RESOLUTION, REVENGE and ROYAL SOVEREIGN, aircraft carrier HERMES, cruisers CALEDON, DRAGON and Dutch cruiser HNethMS HEEMSKERCK and destroyers ARROW, DECOY, FORTUNE and SCOUT, HMAS NORMAN and VAMPIRE and the Dutch HNethMS ISAAC SWEERS. The Fleet then commenced patrolling off the south of Ceylon, sweeping east during the day and west during the night.

April

2nd - (Late in the evening, without any sighting of the Japanese being reported and with several of his fleet requiring replenishment, including the R Class battleships, Somerville decided to withdraw his fleet to Addu Atoll)

At 2100 hours the fast group, Force A withdrew first, immediately followed by Force B, less HERMES and VAMPIRE which went to Trincomalee.

4th - At 1500 hours as Force B arrived at Addu Atoll. (At 1005 hours a Catalina of 413 Sqdn. located and reported the Japanese Fleet 360 miles 155° from Dondra Head)

5th - At 0700 hours Force B sailed from Addu Atoll

6th - At 0700 hours Force A and B combined. The combined Fleet then set course SE for the estimated position of the Japanese Fleet.

At 1800 hours course was reversed to the NE.

7th - (In the early hours the Admiralty signaled Somerville that their policy of discouraging the Japanese from entering the Indian Ocean in force had failed and they further realized that the Eastern Fleet was inferior in all respects to the Japanese Fleet. The R Class battleships were in this respect considered more of a liability than an asset. Therefore Somerville was given discretion to withdraw them to Africa). The Fleet then sailed for Addu Atoll by a circuitous route.

8th - The Fleet arrived back at Addu Atoll. (For details of Indian Ocean operations in 1942 see OPERATION PACIFIC by E Gray).

9th - Sailed from Addu Atoll in company with battleships RESOLUTION, REVENGE and ROYAL SOVEREIGN.

14th - Arrived at Kilindini. Since RAMILLIES had enjoyed a rather easier life than her sisters and was therefore in better condition, she was nominated to replace MALAYA for Operation IRONCLAD, an operation to capture the French naval base at Diego Suarez in Madagascar.

16th - Sailed from Kilindini.

22nd - Arrived at Durban where Rear Admiral E N Syfret hoisted his flag as FO Commanding Naval Force F for Operation IRONCLAD.

28th - Sailed from Durban escorting invasion Convoy Z, the fast convoy, in company with ILLUSTRIOUS and cruiser HERMIONE screened by destroyers LAFOREY, LIGHTNING, LOOKOUT and 3 other destroyers.

May

3rd - The Fast and Slow convoys joined, and the force was joined by aircraft carrier INDOMITABLE escorted by destroyers HMAS NIZAM and NORMAN. NIZAM and NORMAN then detached and returned to the Eastern Fleet that was providing distant cover for Operation IRONCLAD.

5th - At 0430 hours the first troop landing took place in Courrier Bay and RAMILLIES provided naval gunfire support during the landings. Formed part of the landing covering force which also included ILLUSTRIOUS, INDOMITABLE, HERMIONE and 7 destroyers.

6th - Early in the morning the attacking force that was moving east towards Antsirane was held up by Vichy resistance. Following a conference on RAMILLIES, the land commander, General Sturges asked if it would be possible to land a small force in the enemys rear. The suggestion was quickly acted upon. The destroyer ANTHONY was called alongside RAMILLIES and 50 Royal Marines from RAMILLIES, under Captain M Price RM transferred to ANTHONY.

At 1545 hours ANTHONY cast off and proceeded at high speed around Cape Amber heading for the Oronjia Pass at the entrance to Diego Suarez harbour. RAMILLIES and her escorting destroyers then set off after ANTHONY.

7th - At 0800 hours, in the dark, ANTHONY steamed through the Oronjia Pass and at 0850 hours she landed the Marines on the quay at Antsirane. Their effect on the garrison was such that the main Army attack from the west was completely successful and by 1500 hours the Army was able to report the complete occupation of the town.

At 1040 hours off the Oronjia Peninsula RAMILLIES, DEVONSHIRE and HERMIONE in line ahead, screened by 4 destroyers opened fire on the Vichy defences.

At 1050 hours fire was checked when it was learned that the defences had surrendered.

8th - Entered Diego Suarez Bay with other units of the fleet. (Operation IRONCLAD - see RELUCTANT ENEMIES and Naval Staff History)

29th - At 2230 hours a Yokosuka E14Y "Glen" floatplane from the Japanese submarine I-10 on a reconnaissance mission glided over Diego Suarez harbour and made as if to land between RAMILLIES and cruiser FROBISHER which was anchored close to RAMILLIES. Although RAMILLIES had her AA guns manned, she did not open fire because the aircraft might be French and they might have hit FROBISHER. Just as it appeared the aircraft was about touch down she opened her throttle and flew out of sight behind a hill. The whole episode lasted little over a minute. It was assumed that the aircraft was hostile and had come from an enemy warship. Therefore the decision was taken to move position. (The aircraft had been launched from the Japanese submarine I-10 which in company with I-16 and I-20 had arrived off northern Madagascar earlier in the day. After returning to I-10 and reporting their findings, Captain Ishizaki ordered a midget submarine attack on RAMILLIES and FROBISHER for 0230 hours on 31 May )

30th - After raising steam RAMILLIES and FROBISHER weighed anchor, FROBISHER put to sea and RAMILLIES steamed around the harbour. An air search to a depth of 200 miles was carried out which sighted nothing, and RAMILLIES anchored in another position close to tanker MV BRITISH LOYALTY (6993 tons).

At 1710 hours, about 9 nautical miles east of Diego Suarez, I-20 launched midget submarine M-20b.

At 2025 hours M-20b fired one of her two 450mm Type 98 torpedoes with a 350kg warhead at RAMILLIES. The torpedo hit and holed the bulge and bottom plating, opening a 30-foot by 30-foot hole in the port bulge forward of A turret. The electrical system was damaged and power lost all over the ship. The six-inch armor belt above the site of the explosion was displaced and the forward magazines and shell rooms (15-inch main calibre and 4-inch AA) flooded.

At 2120 hours M-20b fired her other torpedo at RAMILLIES. But following the first hit on RAMILLIES, the BRITISH LOYALTY, a motor ship, was able to weigh anchor and start to move her berth. As she was going astern she was hit by the second torpedo that was meant for RAMILLIES and seriously damaged. The crew of RAMILLIES worked to control the flooding, following which she weighed anchor and moved to a narrow arm of the harbour, and moored with her bows to seaward in order to present the least possible target to any further attack.

(The crew of the submarine, Lieutenant Saburo Akieda and Petty Officer Masami Takemoto, beached their submarine at Nosy Antalikely and proceeded towards a pick-up point near Cape Amber. They were informed upon when they bought food at a village and both were killed in a firefight with Royal Marines three days later).

(The Japanese issued a communiqué, claiming that they had sunk a cruiser of the FROBISHER class and torpedoed a battleship of the QUEEN ELIZABETH class which had been left sinking. The Admiralty were able to counter this with complete truth, by saying that no cruiser of the FROBISHER class had been sunk and that no battleship of the QUEEN ELIZABETH class had been at Diego Suarez)

31st - Work carried out to lighten the bows by moving anchors and cable aft, shoring up the damaged bulkheads and counter flooding.

June

1st - Work continuing to make her seaworthy.

2nd - At 1900 hours sailed from Greenock for the Normandy beachhead on Operation NEPTUNE in company with battleship WARSPITE, Monitor ROBERTS, cruisers MAURITIUS, ARETHUSA, FROBISHER, DANAE and Polish ORP DRAGON and escorting destroyers. RAMILLIES sailed with a reduced ships complement so that only two of her four 15 inch turrets could be manned at any one time. This was designated Bombarding Force S and was to have sailed directly to their bombarding stations off the beachhead. However due to bad weather the operation was postponed for 24 hours so they made for Portsmouth.

6th - At 0530 hours NE of Sword Beach, approximately 11 miles west of Le Havre (at this time Le Havre was cut off from the invasion fleet by a smoke screen) RAMILLIES opened fire on the Benerville Battery at a range of 24000 yards. (The Benerville battery consisted of 4 x 150mm guns, three in casemates and one in an open pit open). Almost simultaneously with opening fire, the bombarding force was attacked by the German 5th Torpedo Boat Flotilla of T28, FALKE, JAGUAR and MÖWE which fired 18 torpedoes and made off. Torpedoes were seen approaching RAMILLIES and she turned away from them. They passed between RAMILLIES and WARSPITE, narrowly missing both, but one went on to hit and sink the Norwegian destroyer HNoMS SVENNER at 0535 hours. (The 5th TB flotilla had sailed from Le Havre at 0440 hours with orders to attack landing craft that had been sighted off Port en Bessin. But on breaking through the smoke screen they were confronted by the bombardment line of battleships, monitor and cruisers. On seeing the overwhelming force they fired their torpedoes and returned to Le Havre at speed). After 48 rounds, a hydraulic valve in A turret failed and the gun crew immediately transferred to B turret. In the evening, ran out of 15 inch ammunition and sailed for Portsmouth.
