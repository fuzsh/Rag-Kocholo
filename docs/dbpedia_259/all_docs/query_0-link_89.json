God Bless\"\n\nDouglas Branham of Austin Texas\n\n\"Irving,\n\nTe extrañamos tanto, ha pasado ya tanto tiempo pero el dolor de aquel dia sigue presente, recuerdo cuando nos estabas imitando a todos nos reíamos hasta casi hacernos pipi jaja.. nunca te olvido primito siempre estas en mis pensamientos y en cada paso que doy asi como Enriquito, siempre van a estar en mi corazón por el resto de mi vida... espero que el día en que nos reunamos podamos reír como aquel día... te amo con todo mi corazón y daría lo que fuera por volverte a ver aunque sea un segundo...\n\nBesos al cielo mi Irvingcito adorado...\"\n\nKaren López Medina Prima of Ciudad de Mexico\n\n\"11-14-2016\n\nIrv,\n\nI still think of this day as the first hardest day of my entire life. I still find it hard to believe that it's been 13 years since we were notified that you were killed in Iraq. It seems like it was just yesterday that this horrible nightmare began. I often think of getting that phone call from daddy that changed all of our lives forever. We have changed and will never be the same that we were on November 13, 2003 (the day before you were called to be with God), this last 13 years have been painful but I often find comfort in knowing that one day we will be reunited. I miss you so much little brother. I often reminisce about our trips to Disney and how we talked on the phone almost everyday. You were always a positive person and would always find a way to put a smile on our face. I love you so much Irving!!! Please continue to watch over us. Rest In Peace my angel\"\n\nJenny, A Loving Sister\n\n\"Otro año Irving desde esa tarde terrible en que nos dieron la noticia de tu muerte. Ya son trece años y no puedo arrancar de mi mente ese dia, aunque trato de pensar menos en esos momentos tristes, y pienso mas en recordar todo los bonitos recuerdos que vivi cuando estabas con nosotros.

My fondest memory of you was when we dated for a brief time and we were out in front of the school hanging out and you taught me how to say I love you in Spanish, Te Amo...I will never forget that day and although our dating relationship was short lived, you were always such a great friend with a big heart! You are missed every day! Te Amo my friend...Te Amo!!!\"\n\nApril LaBagh of St. Pete, FL\n\n\"I didn't know him very much, but I was sure he was a very great man. As is with all troops that give the ultimate sacrifice for this nation. I still vividly remember the Wake ceremony, when I was very, very young. I was too young to comprehend what death really meant and what it meant to truly serve your country.\n\nWhat he has done has inspired me to one day serve, as well. To return the service he has given to me and the rest of the American people. It is an honor to attend the 10 year anniversary since that tragic day. Thank you for your service, you will never be forgotten in the hearts of our family, your friends, and every comrade you've served with.\"\n\nRobert Artiga of Leonardtown, Maryland\n\n\"hey brother wanted to write you to let you know that your still in my thoughts everyday. i miss you so much brother i still remember are plans to get out at the same time and hang out. brother you are gone but will never be forgotten love you brother\"\n\nwilliam moon of houston Texas\n\n\"Love.

I remember you coming over all the time to see Sara and playing basketball and soccer with me outside. I remember a bunch of us went and played baseball in the field by the school and you graciously bought me ice cream after we all played soccer together. That was such a fun day. You also showed me some soccer tricks! You were always a great soccer player!!\n\nI remember your smile and warm conversations with me. You were always a true friend to my family and I know I will see you again some day.\n\nI still have your poster that says \"People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf.\"\n\nI look at it every night and it reminds me of you and to be ever thankful for all of the many patriots that made this country what it is!!

With the 10th year anniversary of his death, I want to present my parents with a scrapbook of various pictures, quotes and other stuff that my brother did or said that might have made a small difference in someone's life. Please if you have any memories that you want to share with me so that I can put it in the scrapbook, I would truly appreciate it. Although it will be hard working on this project I think it could be therapeutic as well. I still can't believe that my little brother has been gone almost 10 years because it still feels like yesterday. I miss him so much but I hold on to my faith and know that one day I will see him again. Thank you in advance to those that can and will share a special moment that they might of had with my brother.\"\n\nJenny Medina-Celestin of Arlington, VA\n\n\"Hey Medina, today...I took the big step of trying to close some sad memories that I have of your death and I got a tattoo with your name, for what you did...there are no tattoo's, or words to express how deeply proud I am to still call you my friend!

I love you my little brother. How I wish that you could be here with us, to make us smile with your amazing sense of humor.

I was just reading all the messages below and it's really touching the way they remember you. I, unfortunately, didn't have the opportunity to get to know you more, but I have heard so much about you. When someone in the family talks about you, they do it in such a joyful and happy way that surprises me and makes me realise how special and unique you were for them. Everyone does it that way, both my parents, both your parents, Ivan, Jenny, and as I have read so far, everyone who was ever related to you does it that way. I wish I could have known you a little bit more, you are still very special for all down here, and I really admire you for making all these people happy in some way. Even almost nine years after your depart, you're becoming someone's hero, and that someone is me. Thank you for doing everything you did to all those who now remember you in that way, because even it has been only by the stories I've heard, you have taught me how someone can make the difference in his/her family. Thank you for that. Receive a hug from me and mom.\"\n\nCristian, cousin of Mexico City\n\n\"ONCE AGAIN VETERANS DAY ITS ABOUT TO COME,AND EVEN THOUGH YOU ARE NOT WITH US I KNOW THAT YOUR FAMILY ITS SO PROUD OF YOU,NOT TOO LONG AGO I WAS AT YOUR GRAVE IT TOOK A WHILE BEFORE I COULD BE THERE ITS JUST THAT ITS HAS BEEN SO HARD FOR ME, I WAS RIGHT BEHIND YOU WE TRIED SO HARD TO SAVE YOU BUT UNFORTUNALETLY WE COULD NOT SAVE YOU .

One of the first troops to sacrifice all during OIF. The real OIF. We didn't have the vehicles, gear, knowledge, or training to protect ourselves from IEDs.

First of all thousands of families would not be grieving the loss of their loves. Although, you were not killed on 9/11/01, I believe that you would still be alive if this day never happened. I would be a sister-in-law, an auntie and most important a big sister. I miss you so much and wish that I could take daddy's and mom's pain away. Rest In Peace my Guardian Angel\"\n\nJenny, A Loving Sister of Arlington, VA\n\n\"10 September 2011\n\n10 years ago you were in Basic Training in Fort Sill, OK. You were training to defend our country but never in our wildest dreams did we think that the next day, your training would be put to a test. Our country would come under attack and you and the other trainees would prepare yourselves to defend our country. On September 11, 2001 you were made aware of the attacks and were given a chance to call home. You wrote me a letter on that day and told me that you were ready to defend our Nation. As a fellow Soldier and as your sister I was proud to have you on our team. I know that you were a great Soldier that you would have made a great leader to others but your life was taken way too soon. You excelled in the short time that you were in the Army. I am proud to call you my little brother and my brother in arms. As I reflect back on the last 10 years I cant help but to think of what life would be like if you were still here. I miss you more than anyone can ever imagine but I find strength in knowing that you are resting in Heaven's high. You are my hero because I believe that it takes a courageous person to serve our country. You didn't find a way to hide from your commitment to serve our country. I will always admire your positive outlook on life. I miss you dearly my little brother! Rest In Peace!\"\n\nJenny, A Loving Sister of Arlington, VA\n\n\"You hear things about what are you going to remember this Sept 11th as we mark the 10yr anniversary of the bombings and you came to my mind. I thought about you and all the other people who lost their lives because of that day. Even though you didn't die on that day, your life was still sacraficed because of that day and what happened that caused you to be over there in the first place, so on 9/11 I'm going to remember you and our friendship and the great memories and the sacrafice you made. I'm going to remember the people who lost their life on that day and the men and women who have sacraficed their lives to save those who needed help and for the men and women in our armed forces who lost their lives and I'm going to pray for them and their families that they may have peace in their hearts instead of pain and that they will celebrate the life instead of mourning the loss and they will know their loved ones are in a better place even though it's not here on earth with us. I want you to know how proud I am of you and how greatful I am for having the chance to know you and be part of your life. You will forever be in my heart and always in my memories.

We were all honored to attend a memorial service for Irving at the FOB that we lived in, a memory that I often think about. I for one will never forget you Spc.

Whenever my tears come out I try to see it from my husband's view. He wanted to be a soldier... He wanted to be where he was needed as a soldier... He always volunteered... When the war started he was in Alaska building roads and almost every phone call he told me he want to be in Iraq and fight with his camerads. He got his wish... And with his death he got more wishes fulfilled... he never wanted to be old (he died with 32)... he never wanted to retire... and he never wanted to be wounded or crippled that he can't do his job no more... and he wanted to be with his loving grandmother (who died in 2001)... He got all his wishes and that should make me happy, shouldn't it.\n\nIt was his choice to be a soldier and it was my choice to marry him. I'm greatfull for all the help I get from the US Army, because I don't take this for granted and will never do... Money or other material things like medals won't bring my husband back anyway.\n\nThe biggest treasure I have are my memories and they are wonderful.\n\nKeep Irving in your memories and make him live through them, because believe me, he is with you every day as a guardian angel.\"\n\nBeate Medina (wife of SSG Oscar D.

Te Quiero Mucho!!\"\n\nJenny Medina, A Loving Sister of Clermont, FL\n\n\"To The Family of Spc Irving Medina,\n\nFirst off, I would like to convey my condolences for the loss of Irving. Please know that not only is his country proud of him, but so am I. I will explain further. I am an ex-soldier, and hold each and every soldier who has fought and is fighting for us in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as those still stateside very dear to my heart.\n\nI heard of a website called www.herobracelets.org. This is a small advertising agency in Austin, TX who makes Memorial bracelets in honor of our fallen soldiers. They make a donation for every bracelet sold to The Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund in New York, NY. I have been very touched by the war in Iraq, and even though I support it, I still grieve for the loss of so many men and women who have given their lives for their country and for the citizens of Iraq and Afghanistan. I am too old to go back in the Army, so I was in search of a way I could honor a soldier in a personal way. I quickly ordered one of the Memorial bracelets for myself. While you can specify the name of any fallen soldier, and from any branch of the military, my only specification was that it be a U.S.Army soldier's name on a bracelet I purchased. I got my bracelet a couple days ago, and it has Irving's name on it. I will wear this bracelet in Irving's Honor until each and every soldier comes home, and then as long as it will last. Irving and I are not related, but we have some things in common, and I would like to share those with you. I was about Irving's age when I finished my enlistment in the U.S.Army. I served with the 101st ABN, B Trp, 2/17th Cavalry, Fort Campbell,KY. I also attained the rank of Specialist 4, the same rank as Irving. Irving's family and mine are about the same size, and there is a set of twins in my family as well. Irving was about the same age as my little brother (twin to my sister) when my little brother brother passed away, after an auto accident. Irvings twin brother, Ivan shares that same name with my Dad, a retired U.S.Army MSGT from Fort Hood, TX.\n\nOnly The Good Lord only knows why he took Irving so early, but I know that Irving did not die in vain. I have read all about Irving in letters from Family and Friends posted on Memorial websites, and I feel as though I know Irving, in a small way at least. I believe Irving is in Heaven as I type this, looking down on us all, along with my little brother and everyone who has passed before them.\n\nI know nothing can take away the pain from the loss of a son, or brother, but please know that this ex-soldier is keeping your whole family, and Irving in my prayers, as well as each and every member of our Military. I just want you all to know that I am proud to wear this bracelet on my arm, with Irving's name on it. Irving will not be forgotten, and he is indeed a HERO!\n\nGod Bless You all!\n\nPatrick Bickel\n\nHuntsville, TX\n\nEmail: texxasco@cox.net\"\n\nPatrick Bickel of Huntsville,TX\n\n\"Irv,\n\nI just wanted to wish you a Happy New Year in Heaven.

I keep your family in my prayers and though I know the pain never seems to go away, I hope that you will find comfort in knowing that Irving is in a better place now and his memory will never be forgotten. Words cannot express the way it feels to loose a brother, I just wanted to say to Ivan that I am so sorry for your lose and your brother passed as a true American Hero. God Bless you and your family.\"\n\nAndre Cherry Jr. of Encinitas, CA\n\n\"To the Medina Family,\n\nI was so saddened by the recent news of the death of your son, Irving. I went to high school with him and his twin brother, as well as my twin brother. I know the feeling of having a twin brother not being close to home. It is a terrifying experience, especially after something as terrible as this happens. Words cannot describe the pain and sorrow that I feel. I believe in the words of an old friend who told me \" You don't idolize the actions of a person, you admire their character\". Irving was a person who gave more to others than he did to himself. He was generous, altruistic, and out-going, teaching children how to play sports and read books. His death is a testament to his character; to give up something for the greater good of others. I only wish this world could be filled with more unsung heroes such as this young man who I will miss greatly. To the family and friends of Irving, I send you my warmest prayers and my dearest thanks for giving me the opportunity to have known such a wonderful and loving person during my youth. God bless you all and rest in peace, Irving.\"\n\nDaniel Guilfoyle of Middletown, NY\n\n\"July 14, 2004\n\nIrving,\n\nToday as we celebrate your twins 23rd b-day please know that we are celebrating yours too.

I miss you so much! Today I will let 23 balloons fly to the sky so that you can get my present, I am sorry that I can't be there for the family, I promised you that I would be there to support them on the hardest days of our lives but I hope that you know that my heart is with them. Ivan, mommy and daddy sound so sad and that hurts me so much, to know that I can't make the pain stop. I wish that I could do something to keep them from hurting.\n\nI know that one day we will all be reunited in heaven and I hope that we can be the same family that we have been the last 23 years. Irving I am so sorry that I couldn't protect you as your big sister, I hope that you can help Ivan, mommy and daddy on this day. Sara and Frank and some of your other friends are coming over to spend some time with Ivan and the family, GOD, how I wish that I could be there with them. I love you and miss you so much, there are no words to describe the pain and emptiness that I feel inside. My heart aches on this 14th of July 2004 as for not only we celebrate yours and Ivan's b-day but today it's also 8 months since you were taken to heaven.\n\nIrving I will never stop loving you and I will never forget you and if I ever do have kids, I will make sure that they know what a GREAT uncle you would have been.

I am Ivan Medina A veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Irving was my twin brother. On behalf of my family and myself, I would like to thank everyone that is making a great effort to keep my brothers memory alive. To our community thank you for everything you guys have done for us. I was a very lucky guy for not only growing up with Irving but I had the pleasure of being not just being his brother but also being his twin. Being a twin is a gift from God that most people dont get to share. Although there are many times you wish you were not a twin, the rewards are a lot and they are great. Irving was the defender of the family and friends. Many people got to know that he had a short fuse if you mess with his love ones. Irving was a genuine person. His laugh and smile would bring a smile on your face. His kindness would bring hope that life will bring better days. His positive attitude made people realized that no matter what happens you must look at life in a positive way. His loved for soccer made people see what dedication was about. He volunteered to teach little children soccer, so they too could see the wonderful part of the sport. Irving and I werent born in the United States but we grew up here in Goshen, New York and this is our home and our homeland. Irving joined the army to give something back to his homeland. Even though he wasnt born here, he loved America like any American. Like one of his friends said at Irvings Memorial Services. Most of us did not join the army because we wanted to become killers, we joined the Army out of love, for our freedom, out love for our country and out of love for the way of life that we all enjoy. This is very true about military. In Iraq Irving befriended many Iraqi children. The children saw a great person in my brother. My brother saw the future of Iraq in the children and knew how innocent and precious they were. Irving believed no child should live in a war zone and that they have the right to be children. The time will come and go and my brother will not be back But he left wondering memories to all those he came in contacted with. He used to say, Just let time do its own thing, and Everything will fall into place. He wrote in many letters to friends I am such a lucky person that I have such great family and friends. And I just want to look back and say yeah, I made a difference in this world. Well Irving you made a difference and we cant thank you enough for it. We miss you and love you always. I am thankful to God for the time I had to share with you. Like you wrote to me in letters The house is not the same with you; I am proud of you and miss you. Irving I am the proudest twin brother and I love you and will always miss you until like you said in our last conversation until we meet again. Thank you everyone.\n\nIvan E.

As I read your letters over and over again, I came across one that you wrote to Phil asking him to please take care of me, I wanted to say thank you for always looking out for me. It's been over 5 months since GOD called you home, it has been the hardest 5 months of my entire life. I sit back and think about you coming home and how it's all a big mistake but then I am awaken by this nightmare that I live through everyday, everyday without your smile, without hearing your voice. I miss you more than words can say, and I am sorry for not having been there for you when you most needed me. I think about why this had to happened to you and I still can't find the answer and I guess I'll never will, I just wish that you were here with us, to brighten our lifes with your beautiful smile.\n\nR.I.P.\n\nMY HERO, MY GUARDIAN ANGEL.\"\n\nJenny Medina, A Loving Sister of Coral Springs, FL\n\n\"Specialist Medina, goodbye soldier and thank you.

Pensaba que estarias haciendo en Fort Riley ahora que regresaste. Cuando vi tu nombre en la pagina de Fort Riley de la gente que habia caido no podia creer que eras tu, pues en esa foto te ves totalmente diferente. Hasta ahora me resisto a creer de lo que te paso. Pero tengo que aceptarlo. Descansa en paz Irving. Fuiste un buen amigo y muy buena gente.\n\nIrving I cant believe this happened to you. But I have to accept it.

I am his sister's, boyfriend (soon-to-be-fiance), and I already consider the Medina's, my family. I was looking so much to Irving's homecoming, which would have been only a few months from now (February). I want to say that I am so proud of Irving, for he is a better man than I could ever hope to be. He gave the ultimate sacrafice, protecting the very freedoms that we all take for granted. May God bless his soul and take him in with open arms into his kingdom. I am so Proud of you Irving, your memory will always live on forever. I wrote this poem to you, based on my conversations with Jenny.\n\nNever Did I Imagine\n\nNever did I Imagine,\n\nThat we wouldn't meet again,\n\nOr that the last time we spoke,\n\nIt would be the very end.\n\nI wrote to you in my last letter,\n\nhow proud I was of you,\n\nYour death was so unexpected,\n\nand the letter never made it through.\n\nWhen I told you, you were my hero,\n\nI was speaking from my heart,\n\nYou were always so close to me,\n\nthough we were thousands of miles apart.\n\nYou always knew the right words to say,\n\nto bring a bright smile to my face,\n\nNow I can't imagine, that every holiday,\n\nat the table, ther'll be an empty space,\n\nOnly months were left, until the day,\n\nthat you were set to come home,\n\nBut God called you up to heaven,\n\nfor reasons, to us, unknown.\n\nBefore I close my eyes at night, I pray,\n\nI wake from this horrible dream,\n\nThat once again, we all can be,\n\nThat dynamic, sister, and twin brother team.\n\nWe played all day, and laughed at night,\n\nSinging silly little melodies,\n\nFor twenty-two years, you filled my life,\n\nWith, so many wonderful memories.\n\nYou touched the lives of so many,\n\nthey all came to say goodbye,\n\nI could feel you looking down at us,\n\nyour smile, shining through the sky.\n\nWe trust in God, and know that, now,\n\nyou are in a better place,\n\nFor, you're at peace, now, in God's arms,\n\nhis Kingdom, and in his grace.\n\nNever did I imagine,\n\nI would visit you at your grave,\n\nAlthough I'm sad, I am so proud,\n\nof the ultimate sacrafice you gave.\n\nYou stood up tall, and were so brave,\n\nI hear you fought so gallantly,\n\nYour tragic death, is a constant reminder,\n\nthat freedom isn't free.\n\nI miss you so, and can't quite find,\n\nthe words that express my sorrow,\n\nI talk to you, and ask for strenth,\n\nto cope with the days to follow.\n\nLittle brother, although it's hard,\n\nI know that I must now say goodbye,\n\nBut soon oned day, I promise that,\n\nWe'll reunite in Heaven's High.\n\nIrving, we will all miss you. We are all proud of you, and the sacrafice you gave. May God bless Jenny and the rest of your family, and give them the strength that they will need in the days and months to follow. I know that you are watching over all of us now, and I want you to know that I will watch over and look out for your family now, so you can rest in peace. Again, God Bless You, Now and Forever.

A very appreciative fellow American,\"\n\nLeo Titus of Grayslake, Illinios\n\n\"Irving Medina was the closest person to me outside of my immediate family for the past few years. He saw me through the good times, bad times, everything. He was such a REAL person, such a wonderful friend and boyfriend. He was the most honorable man Ive ever known in my life. He was so selfless, loving, generous, hardworking, and just a wonderful wonderful man. I could talk about him lovingly for hours and not even scratch the surface of how great of a person he was.\n\nWe were eachother's first love and this man taught me what REAL love is. I will never ever forget him and always keep his memories alive in my heart.\n\nThank you Irving for being such an amazing man, I will always love you and miss you forever.\n\nI am so priveledged to have known you, Irv,and I can see how you became the man you were because you have such a great family who I love tremendously. My condolences go to the entire Medina and Polanco family, may God be with you every step of the way, each minute of each day. I love you all and God bless you.\"\n\nSarah Donofrio of Pine Bush, NY\n\n\"UN AGRADECIMIENTO A TODAS LAS PERSONAS QUE EN SU MOMENTO BRINDARON TODO SU APOYO A NUESTRA FAMILIA A MI HERMANO A ANALY A JENNY E IVAN CUANDO TUVIMOS LA DESGRACIA DE PERDER A IRVING PERO EL NO SE A IDO DE NOSOTROS PORQUE SIEMPRE ESTA PRESENTE EN NUESTROS CORAZONES TE QUEREMOS MUCHO MI NIÑO Y RECUERDA QUE SOLO TE ADELANTASTE UN POQUITO PERO ALGUN DIA NOS VOLVEREMOS AVER DIOS ESTE CONTIGO\"\n\nFAMILIA MEDINA of MEXICO CITY\n\n\"To the Medina family,\n\nI knew the Medina twins very well. I grew up with them when they went to Goshen High School. They were the only other pair of identical twins in the school besides me and my identical twin brother. However, the Medinas were indistinguishable. I wish to change that last statement. Irving has now distinguished himself as a hero because of his courage, valor, and strength. I was honored to be his friend. I don't know what I would do if I were to lose my identical twin brother like that. My heart goes out to the Medina family, especially Ivan. I wish to end with a prayer from the 23rd Psalm, in Spanish:\n\n\"Aunque ande en la valle de sombra de muerte, no temere mal alguno, porque tu estaras conmigo, tu vara y tu cayado, me infundiran aliento.\" Vaya con Dios, Irving.\"\n\nMatthew R. Guilfoyle of Albany, New York\n\n\"Thank you for all of your support. I am SPC Medina's sister and want to thank everyone that's kept us in their prayers. It's hard loosing a brother like Irving but I know that someday we will see each other again. Irving was proud of to serve his country. He is missed by mom, dad, twin brother , Big sister (me) and many friends.\"\n\nSGT Jenny Medina of Coral Springs, Florida\n\n\"To the family and friends of Spc. Irving Medina:\n\nMay God's grace be with you during your time of grief. Please know that our thoughts and prayers are with you and we feel your loss and share in your sorrow. Bless Irving for the sacrifice he has made to make a better life for the rest of us.\"\n\nThe Ford Family of Wells, Nevada"
