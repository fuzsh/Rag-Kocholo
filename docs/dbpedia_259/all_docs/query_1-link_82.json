        "text": "The staff had chosen to stay.\n\nThe city was being evacuated.\n\nA wedge of black planes, stubby wings and misshapen bodies moving in stark defiance of physics, roared overhead, tongues lolling and dribbling oily saliva through the gaping maw formed by the missing jaw.\n\nChubby bombs, slick with ichor from whatever monstrosity birthed the implements of destruction, jostled and banged together under downward-swept wings, waiting to be released into the streets below.\n\nRain poured in great sheets from the storm above, blue flashes of lightning bridging between clouds, casting in stark relief the silhouettes of the army that was making landfall.\n\nCannonfire erupted in blue flares, pushing rain away from muzzles, the black dots of artillery in flight fading into invisibility in moments until, in the distance, red flashes rose, being smothered in the rain.\n\nSirens wailed into the darkness, aged air raid horns warbling in ways not heard in decades, the two-tone howls adding to the auditory hellscape.\n\nSlowly, the slumbering vessel woke.\n\nThe park burned. Bombs exploded in mid-air, showering the grass and trees with burning thermite, which created blazing torches of the mature pines and oaks, maples splintering with gunshot cracks and pops as the sap was overheated by the flames, evaporating, steaming, and shattering hardwood and softwood alike.\n\nThe stone memorial stood tall, scorched black from a near-miss.\n\nPonderously, great cannons swung outwards, museum staff using hand cranks and muttered curses as two gunhouses swung in unison, great black barrels rising to the directions called in from the spotting top.\n\nNo smoke rose from the massive stack. No light gleamed from portholes or windows.\n\nBut, even drowsy and groggy, rudely awakened by the carnage and explosions, her voice was unmistakable.\n\nThe blast was tremendous. Windows shattered as the pressure wave tore past, splintering into millions of glimmering shards that rained into the streets.\n\nThe Rain stopped, hammered back and away in a colossal body blow, allowing five fireballs, each the size of a large mansion, to merge and rise above the guns.\n\nThe beach where a group of the monstrosities had beached themselves, ichor-blighted flesh cracked and oozing as flippers hauled blubbery bodies towards the streets of the city, evaporated into a storm of fire and flying steel.\n\nBreeches opened, the acid stink of cordite wafting upwards as huge shells were shoved home, rammers protesting after decades of quiescence. Torso-sized bags of powder soon followed, before the breeches slammed shut with a sense of finality, hydraulics hissing as shore-fed electrical power was diverted to elevation.\n\nThe second volley felt even more powerful, the explosion of nearly a tonne and a half of powder causing aged hull plates and structural members to groan and complain, even as pale fingers adjusted telemetry constantly, the turrets smoothly rotating as the crew focused on reloading.\n\nThe Girl stood in the spotting top, binoculars glued to her eyes as the cannons spoke once more, throat dry as she continued to report as best she could, a squadron of the sea-borne beasts turning to move towards the moored leviathan, a brace of small shells spattering like hailstones against aged but solid armour.\n\nWaterspouts rose around the immobile titan, as the cannons moved, a pall of thick, acidic smoke covering the moorings as there was no wind to pull the cordite haze away.\n\nThe fourth barrage caught one of the necrotic whale-like monsters square in the middle, the colossal shroud of shell splashes around its form only masking the abberation's death throes as it split in half, chitin and gore flung hundreds of metres as the aged artillery continued to operate at the hands of volunteers.\n\nThe stone and concrete pier, jutting outwards into the natural bay, afforded protection by limiting angles of attack. Torpedoes only had a tiny window of opportunity to fire, and, even through the caustic haze, movement was easy to spot and light up with all available weapons.\n\nThe steam whistle mounted to the smokestack hissed, then roared, wordless defiance that caused the skies to tremble, a white plume rising into the air as shells rose over the low headland, shattering against armour plate and leaving foul scorch marks on the metal decking, carrying away oaken planks in flurries of splinters.\n\nThen the larger shells arrived, striking telling blows against hull and upper works alike. Craters were raised against the belt, the cruiser-weight volley biting in a few inches before being defeated by the war-hardened steel.\n\nThe guns continued to spit fire and thunder, even as torpedoes were launched and planes redirected; chitin and ichor pulsing at the anticipation.\n\nA lone Titan, beset by hyenas, refused to yield.\n\nThe drone was barely more than a quadrotor that could be bought at nearly any electronics shop in the world, but it had a wireless camera pre-mounted, intuitive controls, and a cheap thermal imager.\n\nThe pillars of smoke it flew through were too thick for the normal camera, corrosive black soot clinging to the plastic frame as heat rose in shimmering waves, batting the hapless copter around in the turbulence as it fought to get closer to the epicentre of the raging battle.\n\nThe drone's motors whined in protest, surveying the damage as it dutifully recorded the battle raging below; Explosions created bright flares within the smoke, visible in both the Infrared and conventional cameras, pillars of smoke and dust rising as entire buildings slowly crumbled, raising massive grey plumes of pulverised concrete and ash; it took time, but eventually the tiny machine broke through into the eye of the storm, allowing its cameras to work properly once more.\n\nAnd yet, the buildings, billions of dollars worth of infrastructure and construction that had formed a familiar skyline for years, were little more than collateral damage to the ceaseless shelling that continued to pound away at the coastal museum.\n\nLimned with blue flame, black shells arced over the ruined pier and breakwater, stone crumbling to reveal the steel-reinforced concrete underneath, gaping holes blasted into even the reinforced materials from where torpedoes had hammered into the barricade.\n\nThe aged leviathan was dying. Gouges and pockmarks marred nearly every inch of armour, gaping rents and smoking holes torn into the superstructure where explosive shells had punched into lighter steel and detonated. Fires raged uncontrolled from stem to stern, toxic smoke from paint burning raising a great black pillar even through the driving rain that covered the city. Secondary guns had been unseated from their mounts, damaged gun barrels left pointing skyward or drooping like dead flowers, even as the expanding blaze chewed deeply into exposed hydraulics, creating pools of flame that spread and clung to anything in reach.\n\nAt some point, the anchor chains had been cut, torn steel and deep wounds still billowing steam and smoke, obscuring the immense cannons that continued to respond to threats, the close range becoming a vicious knife fight in the centre of an inferno.\n\nThe drone, buffeted by the thermal updrafts in the growing firestorm, would only transmit as a shell went high, punching through a window in the forward spotting top, spraying the inside of the highest point of the warship with flying glass, before passing through the thin steel of the back wall and exploding in midair above the funnel, shrapnel and shell splinters spraying over the burning structure.\n\nThe water was black with ichor and floating chunks of chitin, the burning ruin of a half-dozen warships slowly sinking into the shallows, even as the scarred gunhouses turned slowly, half-blinded yet still seeking new targets.\n\nThe drone's vantage allowed it to see over the headland, smoke, rain, and the thunder of another building crumbling, to see the massed fleet. A dozen whale-like beasts had gathered in a loose circle around a trio of smaller beings, blurred and indistinct as a hulking mass rose from the waters, towering over the flotilla surrounding it.\n\nHunching forwards to support its tremendous bulk with forelimbs that vaguely resembled a gorilla, pulsating tubules extended from the metres-wide shoulders and upper back of the beast, black sputum and silt being ejected in foul gouts until the twitching lengths were cleared, rising in a pattern similar to a battery at Salute.\n\nAnd then it moved, cradling one arm close to its bulky torso, shielding whatever it carried from view as it lurched towards the wounded fortress that had so stymied its fleet. Each movement was followed by a deep groan of metal rubbing on metal, flesh protesting, and the thunderous splash of tons impacting water.\n\nIt did not go around the headland, instead lurching ashore and dragging its malformed, gargantuan body behind it, rounded nodule of a head barely emerging from between its overmuscled shoulders, exposed white teeth open as smoke and embers chuffed outwards with each animalistic breath, a second row of teeth undulating behind the gums of its gaping maw, snapping at masonry as it shouldered its way through the burning ruin of a brick warehouse, the monstrosity large enough that its head cleared the roof of the building.\n\nOne of the turret-like tendrils on the hulk's back turned, aiming towards the tiny drone as the Dreadnought's guns swung towards the headland, preparing to fire as the hulking monstrosity swept its free arm to the side, clearing a path as, with surprising gentleness, it lowered its left arm, placing a woman on the torn asphalt.\n\nStanding tall and regal, bone-white skin and black horns prominent, a pulsating cord extended from the back of her neck towards the gargantua that had carried her, wet hair hanging limp to below her knees as she strode over the rubble, stopping at the edge of the headland to stare at the defiant torch whose working guns were already pointed at her and her creature. Listing heavily, burning, and unmoved by the appearance of the apparent leader of the sudden assault, an echoing clunk and faint whine of hydraulics and electric motors could be heard through the crackling flames, the silent and empty turrets aft of the torn and ruined superstructure turning to settle on their target.\n\nSilently, the apparition raised a hand, a ripple of command extending outwards as the colossal beast attached to her roared, flame and ash erupting from its mouth as the cannons mounted to its body opened fire; the blast wave and eruption of flak from lighter weapons knocking the drone from the sky in a hash of static as the dying colossus replied in kind, all ten cannons responding in a rippling flash and roar that was rewarded in a bellow of pain.\n\nI came across this and I am liking it so much.\n\nI presume that after the rescue from the ice, the captains chair has been cleaned and the leather reconditioned carefully by a sailor frequently, with firm instructions not to disturb the blood stains. And after the ship became a museum, the curators did the same.\n\nMuch like the Conte di Cavours of the Italian Navy, she's been lengthened, upgraded her powerplant, been up-gunned (which was a significant fraction of her five years in refit), increased armour thickness in all aspects, and rejected casemates in favour of dual-purpose secondary mounts, combined with an abundance of lighter stuff to throw at planes and destroyers alike.\n\nShe must have been built with five twin turrets. The Conti de Cavours were lengthened by grafting an extended bow structure over the existing bow, not even by cutting the bow off and putting a new one on. There is absolutely no way that a battleship will be cut through the mid-section and lengthened by the 75 feet or so that is the minimum to fit another turret and barbette in. The costs and time would close to what would be needed to build 1 1/2 to 2 new battleships. The closest would be a bell-lift rebuild, where the ship's bell is lifted with a crane, the old hull slid out, a new hull slid in, and the bell lowered into place.\n\nA few submarines have had a hull plug put in after they were built. HMS Zubian was done by mating one half of HMS Zulu with half of HMS Nubian. A few destroyers, including the recent Arleigh Burke class, have had a plug designed into new ships before construction to lengthen them.\n\nThe rest sounds reasonable, if expensive. The deck armor is easy to upgrade. The up-gunning would probably have been accomplished by building new turrets and dropping them in the barbettes. Casemates naturally go, and DP secondaries are easy. Improving the belt armor would be a pain in the neck, and require manufacturing new belt armor plates, which is a significant proportion of the cost of the hull and takes years for the face hardening. In addition, it's likely that she would have hull bulges installed to improve torpedo protection and restore flotation after adding the extra weight, with improved machinery compensating for the speed loss.\n\nYes, but we are also talking about a (very) extensive rebuild (as had been mentioned, this 'upgunning' also took most of the refitting) and I don't think it's improbable to say that if they did do extensive rebuilding that they wouldn't have also taken that into consideration to rebuild the turrets so that they could fit in another gun within a turret as well. I am Not sure how it would have all worked exactly, but I don't think it to be impossible to do so with such extensive refitting happening already.\n\nAbsolutely not. You've already got two heavyweight Sumo wrestlers into a small telephone booth, now you're asking to take them out and shove three super-heavyweight Sumo wrestlers into the same telephone booth without making the booth larger.\n\nSee here for a discussion of ship design process: Designing a Ship by Stuart Slade\n\nThe critical dimension is the diameter of the roller path in the barbette. This is just on the inside of the barbette, near the top, and the entire weight of the turret rotating assembly hangs on it, all 750-1200 tons. It can't be made bigger, because that would require the barbette diameter to be made bigger. Since the size and weight of the barbette and turret assembly controls the structural loading around the barbette, and the buoyancy controls the beam at the barbette, it is fixed. The first things that happen in the serious design phase is that the number, size, and spacing of the barbettes are set, and the rest of the ship filled in around them. To redesign the barbette means an entirely new ship.\n\nIn June 1938, the Bureau of Construction and Repair sent the Iowa design to the General Board with a barbette diameter of 37'3\" based on a entry in a table BuOrd sent them for the turret. They didn't tell BuOrd, so BuOrd went ahead with the 39' diameter design. The difference was discovered in November 1938, long before the first steel was even smelted, much less cut. After a lot of recriminations and finger pointing, the choice was between using the 16\"/45 gun or doing a turret redesign to fit the smaller barbette diameter. There was pretty much no momentum for a larger barbette, because it simply wouldn't work without redoing the whole thing from the start.\n\nSo now the barbetter roller path diameter is fixed. There needs to be enough space for each gun. Next to each gun needs to be a hoist for the powder and a hoist for the shells. On each side of the gun needs to be enough room for a person to get through to do maintenance, plus the elevating gear and motor. Some space can be saved by using the same hoist to serve two guns by putting it between them, but then the rate of fire drops by at least 50%. The muzzles of the guns can't be too close, as in the New Mexico class, because the muzzle blast will destabilize the shells and cause random flyers. And since the barbette diameter is already trying to be as small as possible, since it's a critical dimension, no one will make a spacious turret to add an extra gun in the future.\n\nIn essence, when rebuilding a ship, the navy is stuck with the same citadel structure. The main battery barbettes are fixed, and the only option is to pull a turret and leave it off. While at the same time putting ballast into the barbette hole to make up the missing weight, as the IJN had to use concrete for Hyuga and Ise. The boilers in the machinery spaces can be pulled and replaced, and frequently were. The turbines can also be replaced, although that was much less common. For ships with an external belt, pretty much all but the USN fast battleships, the belt armor is certainly fixed and won't be changed. Since the weight of the belt is so much, then adding more starts hitting the weight & balance calculations. It's also face-hardened armor, so making it thicker means making new armor plates. Deck armor is homogenous, so an extra inch or two can be laminated on top or bottom, even if it isn't as effective as a single combined thickness.\n\nEssentially, absent the pressure of the Washington treaty, most of the rebuilding wouldn't have happened because they were not economic. The coal burners may have had new boilers put in to convert to oil burning, and the secondaries moved from casemates. A lot of the effort would have simply gone into building a new ship. Rebuilding as it was cost something like 25% to 50% of a new ship anyway, without being fancy as described above. Trying to change the main guns, or the belt armor, or the barbettes, gets up into the range of simply building a new hull and reusing the name. The rebuilds already took three to four years too.\n\nI think That depends more on a 'Ship of Theseus'— is it still the same ship or not if you change the barbette and thus change the stuff mentioned above? Indeed the cost consideration would mean being preferable (or equal to) building a new ship. There are some ship designs throughout history that were (mostly as a result of the treaty) designed with a barbette necessary to swap out the current turrets for bigger guns. I can see that the 5-dual guns was a design favoured by the Royal Navy…\n\nBut at the same time I also hold some skepticism as to whether or not that this Canadian Queen Elizabeth sub-class (from what I assume) would have been designed so radically different, to the extent of adding on an entire extra turret (likely 15-inch). Ultimately it is up to the author how this came to be and to what it looks like and I ain't opposed to it having that extra turret, but the impression I had was that it originally had those 8 turrets (being based off of the QE design, that is.)\n\nThere is a way of swapping out for bigger guns without changing the barbette. The answer is to reduce the number of guns. The Scharnhorst class would trade a three-gun 28cm turret for a two gun 38 cm turret. The Mogami class did trade the 15.5cm three-gun turrets for 20 cm two-gun turrets, with the original turrets going to the Yamato's as secondaries. The US Standard classes of battleships all had almost identical barbette diameters, so changing from the three-gun 14\" turrets on the earlier ones to the two-gun 16\" on the Colorado class was easy. From a size and weight perspective, a two-gun 18\" turret will fit in the same hole as a 16\" three gun turret. A two-gun 16\" turret will fit in the same place as a three-gun 14\" turret. The question is whether to have 12 smaller guns or 8 big ones, or to have 6 big vs. 9 small.\n\nIn order to change the barbette, it's time to go back to the bell-lift rebuild. Which is really a new ship, and the only reason for that is because of treaty restriction preventing the building of new ships. Which, as the Washington and London treaties prohibited, would also prevent the regunning, because the people negotiating the treaties were not stupid. No Ship of Theseus problem here, just treaty cheating.\n\nThe problem is one of the Author's making. The text says that Lady has 10 guns, and was based on the QE class. It is simply impossible for an additional barbette to be added during a rebuild. That leaves designing in a hull plug and adding a fifth turret when she was first built, plus a reduction of speed of perhaps 2 knots. An alternative is leaving it with four turrets, but going to two three-gun and two two-gun. But that means a bigger barbette, more design work than the hull plug, and essentially a different class. Plus the RN, before the Nelson class, absolutely disliking three guns in one turret.\n\nSo the discussion was how this came to be. Most of my posting has been about how adding it during a rebuild wouldn't work, and the reasons why. The simplest solution would be a quick edit of the posted story to return it to 8 guns, but that is up to the author. As is the author's decision to say it happened during rebuild, because it's their story and they make the choices.\n\nThe Secret is simple.\n\n\"National Dickwaving Pride\"\n\nIn a World Where Canada approves the Purchase of 3 State-of-the-art battleships in 1912, and points at the progenitor of what became the Fast Battleship Concept as their first, second, and third choice, you then run into the fact that A: At the time Canada had no shipyards big enough to build said battleships, and B: With World War I right around the corner and tensions high in Europe, The earliest the three sisters would be Laid Down is 1915.\n\nIn this situation comes the fact that Naval Designers would be encouraged to submit design modifications within reason, both for the intended role of \"Showing the Flag in all three oceans the nation borders\", meaning the modified design would be required to handle arctic transits barring catastrophe or curse, and 'Implementing innovations from other designs that may improve the longevity of the design'\n\nFunctionally \"Make these things as advanced as possible because we're not getting any more, ever.\"\n\nDescribing the end result as \"The Unholy Offspring of a Queen Elizabeth and Nevada-class\" Isn't too far off, as the revised design with adjusted beam and structure to accomodate a 3-2-2-3 A-B-X-Y Turret configuration was submitted and verified long before steel was allocated to construction.\n\nThen World War I kicked off, and Canada went from 'Quiet Colony with 6 million people' to \"Holy Shit these guys are scary when motivated, to the point that the Boche are calling them Sturmtruppen', and people in the know start getting antsy about the fact that the nascent nation is getting three modified battleships and infrastructure improvements to service, maintain, and upgrade them.\n\nWhich caused a whole lot of tension for a variety of reasons, and thus the stipulation that the Three Sisters would be the first, and Last, Battleships Canada would own.\n\nSo, in order to maintain the presence of them as both armed projection as well as prestige pieces, upgrade programs would be heavily invested in.\n\nIncluding the BL 15\" Mark II.\n\nWhich took a few years to fully develop and make, because going from Wire-wound to single-casting was the primary impetus into the study of the longer, higher-velocity, and slightly lighter guns, and it turns out that comprehensive refits are a loophole neither Washington or London's Naval treaties closed.\n\nIn this case, \"Upgunning\" is a technical misnomer; it's more accurately \"upgrading the guns with minor alterations to the turret\"\n\nSo, in order to put paid to the lovely debate up thread (And I mean that seriously; the technical discussion upon 'How to design and wrangle warships' is both very information-dense and very fascinating), I'm going to say this nice and clear.\n\nThe modified design already accounted for the novel (By Royal Navy Standards) use of three-gun turrets and the increased barbette dimensions during initial construction, instead of being a post-facto modification.\n\nThe Retrofit taking five years was a combination of factors, including a comprehensive replacement of the powerplant and turbines, removing the original bow and extending the replacement to reduce water shipping in heavy seas, re-building the superstructure, and sourcing components from Domestic facilities instead of shipping them from English or American manufacturing, even if it meant building said manufacturing facilities from first principles.\n\nThis has resulted in a Battleship that is in that awkward position where they're too slow to escort carriers easily, too fast to trundle along with a standard gunline, and just a little awkward internally due to design decisions and political motivations in the vein of national pride overriding more-sensible decisions. I have tried to show this by pointing out that while a reasonably successful brawler and stupendously durable, The Lady's been cursed with enduring far more punishment than her contemporaries, and has a reputation for being a charnel house as a result.\n\nI did not want to make a 'platonic ideal of a warship' for this story.\n\nI wanted an oddball, borderline one-off design, because much like how the Three Queen Elizabeths that got comprehensive retrofits had iterative improvements upon each prior retrofit (Seriously, Warspite kept her casemates while QE and Valiant went straight for 10 4.5\" guns per side in dual-purpose mounts), the Lady's own retrofit was as much a learning experience as it was an attempt by a growing-in-prominence middle power to revitalize a then-fifteen year old hull, without the fundamental experience three centuries of Naval Tradition would bring to ensuring the refit went as planned.\n\nDescribing the end result as \"The Unholy Offspring of a Queen Elizabeth and Nevada-class\" Isn't too far off, as the revised design with adjusted beam and structure to accomodate a 3-2-2-3 A-B-X-Y Turret configuration was submitted and verified long before steel was allocated to construction.\n\nThis makes sense, and is doable in the early design and construction phase. The effect of going from a 2-2-2-2 to a 3-2-2-3 layout would be a slightly larger beam at the A and Y turrets, resulting in a fatter ship and the loss of 1-2 knots of speed. So she'll be at 22 or 23 knots, compared the stepsisters' 23-24 knots. Only issue would then be getting a slot on the British slipways, but that's doable.\n\nIncluding the BL 15\" Mark II.\n\nMakes sense. That gun is a hair over a meter longer, but should be three tons lighter. Since it's a new design, the position of the trunions can be set for the ship so the balance point is proper on the turrets.\n\nIn this case, \"Upgunning\" is a technical misnomer; it's more accurately \"upgrading the guns with minor alterations to the turret\"\n\nMake that major alterations to the turrets. As is, they have an elevation of 20 degrees, but were limited elsewhere in the fire control system to 15 degrees. Historically, the QEs got upgraded to 30 degree elevation, which greatly extended their range. Along with the new guns of the same caliber, I would suggest increasing the elevation to 35 or even 40 degrees, to make them a true long range threat. It'll take a bit longer and cost more, but there are new guns going in anyway.\n\nThe Retrofit taking five years was a combination of factors, including a comprehensive replacement of the powerplant and turbines, removing the original bow and extending the replacement to reduce water shipping in heavy seas, re-building the superstructure, and sourcing components from Domestic facilities instead of shipping them from English or American manufacturing, even if it meant building said manufacturing facilities from first principles.\n\nDoing the bow the right way. Re-boilering and the turbines should be able to push her to 24-25 knots. The question is whether torpedo blisters will be added for stability and protection, at the cost of speed, and how much topweight will be added. Blisters will help a lot with the topweight too.\n\nThis has resulted in a Battleship that is in that awkward position where they're too slow to escort carriers easily, too fast to trundle along with a standard gunline, and just a little awkward internally due to design decisions and political motivations in the vein of national pride overriding more-sensible decisions. I have tried to show this by pointing out that while a reasonably successful brawler and stupendously durable, The Lady's been cursed with enduring far more punishment than her contemporaries, and has a reputation for being a charnel house as a result.\n\nThey'll be on the Arctic convoys to protect them if the Twins or Tirpitz come out to play. Then sent to Mediterranean for shore bombardment at Mers-Al-Khabir. In the Pacific, she'll be sent to Island Hating Duty, along with the rebuilt standards, as well as invasion fleet defense. For these tasks, high speed isn't really needed. The arctic convoys will need the capability to retain a decent speed in heavy weather, since Force 6+ seas start slowing down all ships depending on hull design, bow, and installed power. It doesn't matter if a ship can do 29 knots in flat water, it matters if it can maintain 20 knots in 40 foot seas. You're right, very awkward for assignments one the thread of North Atlantic surface raiders is gone.\n\nSo, in order to put paid to the lovely debate up thread (And I mean that seriously; the technical discussion upon 'How to design and wrangle warships' is both very information-dense and very fascinating), I'm going to say this nice and clear.\n\nThank you."
