        "text": "\"I remember nearly 20 years ago (today being 13 Nov 2023) getting the news from SFC Braxton. I was working in Dallas, TX awaiting to rejoin the military. I vividly remember the heat rushing through me as I heard the heartbreaking news of your passing. I remember studying together for the SGT board, the time your arm was broken and you came to work after taking too many pain killers, the time we spent in a foxhole as your AG on the M60 and how I nearly cried laughing when it jammed in training and how you worked frantically to get it operational again, when you would call cadence and sing the Yogi (or Jogi) cadence, and the times we went out together...you were a great friend. In 2013, I began a career in Counter-Improvised Explosive Devices (C-IED) and did that for nearly a decade. I spoke of you often, honoring your sacrifice and memory. I have periodically seen these postings but never found the words to post. I developed curriculum for the Army that is still being used today to enhance the readiness for other Soldiers. I took the job personal, desperately working to ensure others would not meet the same fate. I'm thankful for all you did for your country, your family, and for protecting future Soldiers. You are one of our nation's heroes. You are my hero. Thank you for always being the tip of spear in all that you did all while being full of life with a full smile while you did it. May you rest well my friend.\"\n\nCory Durbin of Manhattan, KS\n\n\"I was watching videos of homecomings and they always made me cry then I came across yours of Frank Martinez and balled like none other of them. I too served. I came home but my heart really goes out to those who made the ultimate sacrifice like Frank. I salute you and your family for the sacrifice that Frank made for our country. I pray the God bless you and your family!\"\n\nBryon Franklin of Dallas, Texas USA\n\n\"It has been many years since you have been gone but you have always lived in my memory. Thank you SGT Martinez for all that you have done for us! We miss you very much.\"\n\nAga Fisher of Tampa, FL\n\n\"My man, I remember you from AIT at Ben. Those days were the best. You were in a different class as you were a H and I was a B. Many times we did PT together and Korea too. You were in the PSBs and I was in an S1 up at Howze. I remember you fondly. I too would end up at Bragg, after Korea.That was in 96 and again, I was in an S1. You were on the hill with Tagorda and them. Tagorda, I also remember. After all of that time at Bragg, you stayed and I left back to Korea and then the MDW for a few years. All of a sudden an event called 9/11 would forever shape our lives. I experienced it first hand as I was stationed at Myer at the time. At any rate, A few weeks later I was called by MSG Schipper (my former Drill Sergeant at Ben) from branch. It was time to PCS. He informed me that he could get me a sham jump slot in Corps. I told him to send me to the 75th. I had gotten an article 15 and was still on track to Corps. Due to a SNAFU from the 15,as I was PSCing, I was sent back to Division. While in replacement I was interviewed by a couple E7s, and was due to go up on the hill. Because of my AR15 that I thought was valid and found out that afternoon that it was not, I was wearing SPC rank. From what I understand, it was I who was supposed to be in your spot that day. I remember when I was told that I was going back on the street. I did not think much of it then. It all hit me the day that you died, in November 2003. I was in ADSO, at the time. It is a guilt that I will forever carry. I know that you would show up at a 30 year reunion of Ben classmates. I am sure that you know Ben is gone. I think about you then and the others from that time. I choose to remember us that way. We were kids there and men, when you died. I miss you brother. It's my fault that you are gone. It should have been me.\"\n\nEJP of SGPA\n\n\"In order to truly understand the passion and dedication this phenomenal soldier had for the uniform and service to the nation you would have to go back to his teenage years during his time as a Cadet in Puerto Ricos Humacao Cadet Squadron of the Civil Air Patrol. The values and the discipline that were instilled on us at such a young age is what drove him to be one of the best soldiers to serve in the greatest military this world has ever seen.\n\nNunca te olvidaremos Martínez! Rest easy my brother.\"\n\nALFREDO LABOY II, Colonel, USAF of Humacao, Puerto Rico\n\n\"Hey Frankie your Bday in heaven coming soon.

I was assigned to the 82nd MP Co and occasionally bumped into him and like all ways joked and clowned around.I learned of his pass while also serving in iraq in 2003.

I was in Korea when I received the news of SGT Martinez' passing and what a sad day it was. SGT Marinez was such a sweet person...I remember going to room to see what correspondence courses he had completed or just visting--before leaving, I would always ask him to give me one of his bamboo stalks that he was growing; I know he had to have at least 4 or 5 in his room and each time I would leave empty handed--he probably thought that I was just joking around with him. I also remember the time that we all had our routine 12 mile ruckmarch in Area J-SGT Martinez went above and beyond the call of duty, he ensured that he made/went over the rucksack weight requirement by adding weights, among other thing to his sack; he definitely gave 110%.....he was a true Airborne warrior and will be deeply missed.

I think having to tell all of our soldiers that day in Iraq that you were gone still remains the hardest thing I have ever done in my life. I read all these comments and see all the soldiers that we served with in the SSB, all the soldiers that you had a positive influence on and it brings back all the memories. You sneaking out a canteen of beer to the field for me on my 21st birthday, you having to wake me and Partins * up after we had missed formation again, all the things you could make with 550 chord.

You made sure my parents were good. You went and got me BLUE powerade held the washcloth over my forehead.I remember coming back from Jacksonville and B-Note called me saying stop by the office before I left. And there was DW and Tejeda and B-Note waiting on me. I still cry replaying that moment in my head Blake telling me you were gone. All I felt was hurt and pain. You were my friend my big brother!! I remember your laugh,you always making sure your soldiers were okay. Remember teaching how to drive the LMTV lol how nervous you were because you said I was too short to see the road!!!

Love Your Little Bit!!!!\n\nKnight\"\n\n\"5/26/09 My Dearest Frankie, Yesterday was Memorial Day and you were heavy on my heart. I thanked God for letting our lives hear on earth link. We remembered the day with a bbq and said a special prayer thanking you and all your fallen commrads for the ultimate sacrifice you gave. I went thru the box of your belongings they sent back from IRAQ. Wearing your uniform, looking at your pictures, reading our letters, and holding your dog tags in my hand made me feel extremly close to you; as if you were there beside me. My precious stepdaughter came into the room Alyssa 9 yrs old and asked me if I was ok; I said let me tell you about a HERO his name was Francisco Jimenz Martinez and he gave his life for your and my FREEDOM.\"\n\nJamie Fotch of Garner, NC\n\n\"Marty,\n\nWhere to begin? All of these years later and the pain is still fresh in my heart. You were one of the first people I met when I got to my new home in the 82D. You were always willing to do what it took to help out and get the job done. You were always willing to come pick us up when me and the guys had too much to drink. I remember when I got hurt on Luzon DZ...you were the one that found me out there in the middle of the night, get the medic and carry both of our equipment out of there. You said, \"Dammit Partin, now I'm gonna have to carry your stuff back.\" I still use the vacuum seal packing technique that you taught me. I think of you often and I will never forget you. I will come visit you one day in Puerto Rico.\n\nYour Brother in Arms\"\n\nDaniel Partin of Turlock, Ca\n\n\"I remember Marty as a dedicated Paratrooper; he was true to the cause. A Soldiers Soldier. SGT Martinez and I served in B-CO 82 ABN, I served as his SQ LDR and then as his PLT SGT. I remember whenever we had long days at work leading to a late night ABN operation and I'd ask him how he was doing he would say \"Sarge the longest day has and end never one to snivel, and always one that leaders could count on to make stuff happen. AKA Heavy Drop he had a never quit attitude that was contagious. On behalf of all paratroopers. ABN ATW!

Your 33rd birthday just came and passed... I called your mother (what a wonderful woman). The 5 year anniversary of your passing is a month away and I will be sure to call and console her that day too. My Baby Girl Kyra will be a year old soon... I am busy planning her 1st Birthday. Her due date was originally Nov 1st and when I went over I begged God not to let her be born on the aniversary of your death and she held out until Veteran's Day to honor you! I know you met her in Heaven and played with her before she came to me and I know you told her to \"Love your Mother\". You would have made a wonderful Father and I hate that death cheated you of that. Siempre tu amor, Jamie Lee\"\n\nJamie Fotch of Raleigh, NC\n\n\"Frankie,\n\nMy closest friend. I am now getting my heart and soul online in dealing with your death. It has taken me this long to actually speak your name without losing mind. 1SG King, now SGM King, was in a gut wrenching mood that entire day as he walked by me. That evening, he gathered everyone together and told us what happened. Those words have been with me for the past five years.(SSG Francisco Martinez was KIA) My soul dropped, and I lost my bearing. As I am typing these words, the tears are starting to fall all over again. I know that it would be the same if you were still here, and I was the one gone. I miss you so much, bro. The world is not the same. I have written many poems in your memory. Every anniversary, I pour some out for you. We will always have good conversations as we remember the times we had.

He picked me up from the 82nd Replacement to head over to my new family at the B company. One of the first things he said, or rather yelled to me was \"Hurry up and get your bags in the truck. Let's go, let's go private, it's raining! Come on, MOVE IT ATE UP!\" and I thought, \"Here we go...and they told me I'd be done with this crap after basic...\". Well, that was just Heavy Drop for ya, always high speed. It turned out that I'd just met one of the most loyal NCOs and friends I'd ever know. He later ended up as my direct supervisor in the office. Even there, he was a hero and I always thought that if I were to become an NCO that's the kind I'd need to be. He'd never let you work harder than him and if you had a problem, he made it his. He was a stern and demanding NCO but always fair and he never let you forget that he was also a friend and a brother. When it came to defending one of his soldiers he was afraid of no one, enlisted or commissioned. He'd often left me stunned speechless when he'd get right in an officer's face, inches from a article 15 I'm sure, practically yelling something like \"It's my soldier, my problem, I'll handle it!...sir\". That's someone the army and the world didn't do well to lose. Our loss has never been easy for me to deal with, no matter who I talk to about it, and I still tear up in his memory to this day. I've never met his family but if any of them ever need anything or just want to talk to someone who knew and worked with Frankie, my phone is (315) 806-8183. I would do anything I am capable of to help. Even if it's just to create a smile. Marty did that for us many, many times. To Terrence, my old friend SSG Arthur, and anyone else who feels somehow accountable for Francisco's passing, just remember the last thing he said, \"God has bigger things for this man\". I know that it might not help much but it just wasn't your place to choose my friends. So, please don't hold any blame on yourself. No one else does and certainly Marty never would.

Last time I saw you brother was PR then we had a conversation when I got commision as an officer and you were recently promoted to NCO we were so proud of each other was just like basic again, we were able to catch up on events over that past years.

I know (CHUITO) is with you standing at your side, as well as other brothers in arms. your time here with us was brief yet more than rewarding and appreciated.

May God continue to comfort you and we will all see SSG Martinez in the Promised Land.

You were my jump buddy on my first jump as a bulldog. Man I miss those times. Sweating the tape after a PT test. So many nights I sit around and think about the future. I feel like it is my fault. You were scheduled to go with Alpha FAST, and I begged and begged until they switched us. If you were in Afghanistan instead of Iraq, you would still be here. I have so much pain in my heart for you and your family. Nothing has went right since you have been gone. Maybe it's my way of killing myself for your death. It has been years past since you left us, but I still can't seem to let it go. I guess you should know that I changed my MOS to Mortuary Affairs. I feel it's the least I can do. I felt so helpless when the casualty phone rang, and they stated your name. I dropped the phone and instantly fell to pray. I miss you man. You will always be my airborne buddy.

We met in AIT, then went to Korea and Bragg together. Those were some great years, buddy. We lost touch over the years after, but I still think of the good times roommate, and you're still my best friend. I look at our talent show video and old photos from time to time and reminisce on the good times. Thanks for the spanish lessons! Your family should know that you loved them and spoke of them often, especially your mother. I will deliver some photos and videos of you to your family that I still have.

Not a day goes by that you are not on my mind! Every time I think of you our song comes on Here Without You/3 Doors Down. You know the one! I use to picture you listening to it in Iraq and thinking of me back here in the US, now I thinking of you in Heaven while I am back here on earth. Is this song playing on the radio a sign from you to let me know your still there?

All our hopes and dreams were shattered on November 4th when God called one of his soldiers home. I am so glad we talked that morning. One of your sergeants told me the last words you said were that god has bigger things for this man. I have a new hope and dream that I will see you in Heaven as you open the pearly gates for me.(from your CD) I know now that you are a warrior in Gods Army watching over us and protecting us.
