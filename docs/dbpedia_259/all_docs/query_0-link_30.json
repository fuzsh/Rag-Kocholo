        "text": "In 1908, the United States Fleet, then on a voyage around the world, arrived in Australian waters and visited Australian ports. A great impression was made on the people by this “great White Fleet” as it was popularly known. Furthermore the sight of these ships and of the American sailors gave a stimulus to the desire of the Australian people for a navy of their own.\n\nThe Prime Minister voiced the feelings of his countrymen when he said, during the visit of the Fleet:\n\nBut for the British Navy there would be no Australia. That does not mean we should sit still under the shelter of the British Navy—-those who say we should sit still are not worthy of the name of Briton. We can add to the squadron in these seas, from our own blood and intelligence, something that will launch us on the beginning of a naval career, and may in time create a force which shall rank among the defences of the Empire. . . .\n\nThat “something” which the Prime Minister visualized was a naval squadron which was to form the first unit of a Royal Australian Navy. It was to be manned as far as possible by Australian officers and seamen; in time of peace it would be under the exclusive control of the Commonwealth Government; its regulations would closely parallel the King’s Regulations governing the Royal Navy; and the standards of training, discipline, and efficiency would be equal to those of the parent Navy. Furthermore there would be frequent interchange of officers and men between the two services. The squadron was to consist of:\n\n1 armored cruiser (battle cruiser) (Australia)\n\n3 cruisers (Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane)\n\n6 destroyers, three submarines, and necessary auxiliaries.\n\nThis decision to create her own Navy, and the general details of the plan agreed upon with the Admiralty, met with general approval in Australia. Two of the destroyers, built in England, made the passage out and a third built in England was fabricated, shipped out and reassembled at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard in Sydney, the experience thus gained enabling Australian shipwrights to build three more. The battle cruisers, two light cruisers (Sydney and Melbourne), and the submarines were built in England, but later two light cruisers were built at Cockatoo.\n\nAll this construction took some years to complete, and meanwhile other important factors such as the location of bases, the setting up of training establishments, the enlistment of personnel, and the creation of a naval administration needed attention.\n\nFinally, in 1911, at the Imperial Conference held in London in that year, the status and standards of the future Royal Australian Navy were agreed upon as follows:\n\n(1) While in Australian waters the naval forces were to be controlled by the Commonwealth government.\n\n(2) Officers and men would be interchangeable with the Royal Navy.\n\n(3) R.A.N. ships would fly the White Ensign, and the Australian jack at the jackstaff. (This gave the ships international status as vessels of war.)\n\n(4) Seniority, whether the officer is R.N. or R.A.N., was to be determined solely by date of commission.\n\n(5) Service in either Navy would count equally in all respects for pay, promotion, retirement, etc.\n\n(6) In war, R.A.N. ships automatically became an integral part of the Royal Navy.\n\nThus, on the outbreak of war with Germany in 1914, the unit was nearing completion, the main details of naval administration had been settled, the Naval Board was functioning, the R.A.N. naval college (located at Jervis Bay on the coast south of Sydney), and the training ship Tingira were in commission, the building yard at Cockatoo Island had been taken over by the Commonwealth government, and some work had been carried out on the proposed naval bases at Fremantle and at Western Port, near Melbourne. The squadron itself, on arrival from England, had been officially and popularly welcomed to Australia on its entry into Port Jackson in October, 1913, and had since visited other Australian ports in the course of training.\n\nAt this time, the permanent members of the R.A.N. totaled some 3,000 and an additional 850 officers and men had been lent by the Admiralty. At Jervis Bay College, 60 cadet-midshipmen were being trained for commissioned rank, among them Captain H. B. Farncomb and Commodore J. A. Collins, currently the two senior officers now on the active list.\n\nAt this critical juncture it will be seen that Australia was assuming her share of Imperial responsibility by building up her citizen army and by fostering the efficiency of her naval squadron. The R.A.N. was her own creation; no other British Dominion had undertaken such a responsibility and it was, too, in many ways an experiment, the success of which was essential to the prestige of the Commonwealth.\n\nDuring the course of World War I, the success of the venture was abundantly proved and the wisdom of the new enterprise fully justified. It will be sufficient here to refer only to the principal events and occasions in which the R.A.N. took part.\n\nThe presence of the battle cruiser Australia is known to have deterred the Commander of the German East Asia Squadron (Vice Admiral Count von Spee) from seeking action with her and it probably also determined his subsequent course of action. He was thus forced to conform his movements to those of his enemy, and was reduced to carrying on a cruiser war in the Pacific Ocean, and eventually seeking touch with Germany around Cape Horn. The capture of the German colonies in New Guinea was effected by the R.A.N. in conjunction with Australian military forces; the escorting of the Anzac Expeditionary Forces across the Indian Ocean was shared in by Australian warships in the course of which operations H.M.A.S. Sydney destroyed the German cruiser Emden: the Australian submarine A.E.2 was the first British submarine to make the passage of the Dardanelles into the Sea of Marmora, but received such damage that her crew were obliged to sink her, and were made prisoners; in 1917-18 the Australian destroyer flotilla was actively engaged in the Adriatic; Australia’s battle cruiser, after the Battle of Coronel, was based on Rosyth and was continuously engaged for nearly four years in the North Sea, and Melbourne and Sydney were similarly employed; eleven volunteers from the R.A.N. took part in the raid on Ostend and Zeebrugge and in general nearly every ship was consistently and actively engaged in waters far distant from the Commonwealth.\n\nNor were Australia’s own seas immune from enemy action. Rumors of raiders, some of which proved to be more than rumors, the discovery of mine fields on the main coastal highway, and many reports of enemy aircraft imposed on the naval authorities a whole series of necessary countermeasures ranging from patrols to mine sweeping, and widespread security measures afloat and on shore. In addition, the examination services at each port, port war signal stations, harbor patrols, dock defenses, and other activities were carried out.\n\nThe R.A.N. Naval Brigade provided a unit known as the R.A.N. Bridging Train which served with distinction in the Dardanelles campaign and in Egypt. Transports, hospital ships, and dockyard were another important war activity of the R.A.N., which had thus fully justified itself and its creators as the first Dominion Navy.\n\nWhen the German High Seas Fleet surrendered to the Grand Fleet, H.M.A.S. Australia at the head of her squadron led the capital ships of the British port line, the light cruisers Melbourne and Sydney also being present.\n\nWhen the Australian flagship finally sailed from British for Australian waters, the then Prince of Wales (now Duke of Windsor) and the First Sea Lord inspected the ship’s company at Portsmouth. In welcoming the Prince, the High Commissioner for Australia (Sir Joseph Cook) said:\n\nOur Navy has been proud to serve the Empire and our Allies, not only as part of the Grand Fleet in the North Sea, but in every part of the world. In this way it has fulfilled the purpose of its creation, to share the burdens and sacrifices as well as the privileges of a free Imperial community.\n\nAdmitted as equals into the parent Navy, their efforts had been to show that honor fully deserved. They had saved their own country from a possible if not probable attack by von Spee’s ships; they had protected the trade routes, guarded other Dominions, colonies, and protectorates, and served in the five oceans of the globe. The hopes expressed when the service came into being had been fulfilled. Not only its deeds, but its true significance were discovered and realized by the Australian people—it had become the symbol of its country’s pride and the proof of the traditional battle cry of her people: “Australia will be there.”\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy Between Two Wars\n\nAs with the navies of other nations, the Royal Australian Navy was considerably affected by two major factors during the period which separated the first and second World Wars: The Washington Conference of 1921, and the world economic depression of the 1930’s. The first of these set a limit to naval strengths and programs by agreement; the second set almost as rigid restrictions through the demands for economy.\n\nConsequent upon the Washington conference, all warship and naval base construction was, for a time, suspended. The personnel of the R.A.N., which totalled 5,250 in June, 1919, was 4,843 in 1921; by 1923 it had been reduced to 3,500. The Commonwealth’s only battle cruiser, H.M.A.S. Australia, was dismantled and sunk, off Sydney Heads, on April 12, 1924, in accordance with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty, and from 1921 to 1923, the number of R.A.N. ships in commission was reduced from 25 to 13. Work on the light cruiser Adelaide, under construction in Sydney, was continued, and she was commissioned in August, 1922.\n\nIn 1925, however, the Australian Naval Board, faced with the obsolescence of most of its cruisers, decided to acquire from Britain two new cruisers of 10,000 tons each (the maximum size for new construction under the Washington treaty). In addition, submarines were to be obtained from Britain, and a seaplane carrier to be built in Australia.\n\nThe first of these moves had its outcome in 1928 with the commissioning of H.M.A.S. Australia and Canberra—the heavy cruisers which were to do such outstanding work in the coming war. Early in 1929 the submarines Oxley and Otway reached Australia. But, as these were only a portion of the number originally intended, their maintenance in the highest state of efficiency was difficult in Australia, where they were a small specialized unit. The British Government therefore agreed to take them over as a gift, maintaining them at its expense. They reverted to the Royal Navy in April, 1931.\n\nMeanwhile, the seaplane carrier, H.M.A.S. Albatross, built at Cockatoo Dock, Sydney, was commissioned in January, 1929. Ultimately she was handed over to the Royal Navy, in part consideration for the cruiser Hobart.\n\nIn 1930, for reasons of economy, the Royal Australian Naval College (for training of Cadet Midshipmen) was transferred from Jervis Bay to the Flinders Naval Depot area. The college had first opened at Geelong in 1931, transferring to Jervis Bay two years later.\n\nBy February, 1932, the Permanent Forces personnel of the R.A.N. stood at 3,117; plus 131 members of the Auxiliary Service, and 5,446 in all sections of the Reserves.\n\nBut further expansion was at hand. In 1933, the British Government made a gift to Australia of the destroyers Stuart (flotilla leader) Vampire, Vendetta, Voyager, and Waterken. When they commissioned in Britain as H.M.A. ships, in October, 1933, they were far from new. But they were destined to form the “scrap iron flotilla” (in Germany’s contemptuous phrase) which did such yeoman service in the Mediterranean in the early stages of the war against the Axis.\n\nWithin six years of receiving these destroyers, Australia increased her cruiser strength by the addition of three new 6-inch units. The namesake of H.M.A.S. Sydney commissioned in Britain in September, 1935, and H.M.A.S. Hobart in September, 1938. The Perth did not commission as a H.M.A. ship until June, 1939, and the war broke out when she was on her way to Australia.\n\nThe Royal Australian Navy in the Present War\n\nOperational.—One of the earliest actions taken by the Commonwealth Government was to place the Australian Naval Forces at the disposal of Great Britain. Since then, the Royal Australian Navy has been represented by ships or men, or both, on all the world’s seaways—Egypt, The United Kingdom, Libya, Somaliland, the Persian Gulf, West Africa, Greece, Crete, Cyprus, Syria, Malta convoys, North Africa, Russia, the Battle of the Atlantic, the invasion of Normandy, Sicily, Italy, the Aegean, Malaya, Singapore, Sumatra, Java, Timor, Madagascar, the Bay of Bengal, Papua, the Solomon Islands, and New Guinea.\n\nThis is one war, not two; the war at sea knows no boundaries. An illustration of this is provided by the fact that, although the outbreak of war with Japan concentrated most of Australia’s ships and men in the Pacific, there still were several hundred Australian naval personnel serving on loan to the Royal Navy, apart from those in ships attached to the Eastern Fleet.\n\nThe summaries given below outline the operational history of the Royal Australian Navy in the present war, under the following headings:\n\n(1) Prior to Japan’s entry into the war; (2) since December 7, 1941; (3) the story of Australian naval personnel serving in ships of the Royal Navy, and of Australian- manned ships which have served in the Mediterranean and with the Eastern Fleet since Japan entered the war.\n\nPrior to Japan’s Entry into the War\n\nMiddle East.—By Christmas, 1939, H.M.A. destroyers Stuart, Vampire, Vendetta, Voyager, and Waterhen had reached the Middle East; and the last of them did not leave there until October, 1941. (H.M.A.S. Waterhen was sunk in June, 1941.) H.M.A. cruiser Sydney was in that area from May, 1940 to January, 1941; H.M.A. cruiser Hobart from May, 1940 to December, 1941; H.M.A. cruiser Perth from December, 1940 to July, 1941; H.M.A. escort vessel Yarra from September, 1940, to December, 1941; and H.M.A. escort vessel Parramatta from August, 1940, until she was sunk in November, 1941.\n\nThe following are the major actions and some other activities in which those ships participated during that period. In most cases the work was done in collaboration with R.N. ships:\n\nBombardments of Bardia (H.M.A.S. Sydney and Stuart, June, 1940; Stuart, Vendetta, and Waterhen, August, 1940; Voyager and Waterhen, April, 1941).\n\nSinking of Italian destroyer Espero by H.M.A.S. Sydney (June, 1940);\n\nBattle of Calabria (July, 1940); H.M.A.S. Sydney, Stuart, Vampire, and Voyager participated.\n\nSinking of Italian cruiser Bartolomeo Colleoni (July, 1940); she was put out of action by H.M.A.S. Sydney and sunk by torpedoes of R.N. destroyers Ilex and Hyperion.\n\nEvacuation of Berbera (August, 1940). H.M.A.S. Hobart covered the evacuation and then bombarded the town.\n\nBombardment of Rhodes (September, 1940); H.M.A.S. Sydney.\n\nIn October, 1940, H.M.A.S. Vampire, Voyager, and Waterhen were among the first arrivals at the advanced base at Suda Bay, Crete.\n\nIn December, 1940, H.M.A.S. Sydney was one of the striking force in the Straits of Otranto and in the bombardment of Valona.\n\nBattle of Matapan (March, 1941); H.M.A.S. Perth, Stuart, and Vendetta participated.\n\nBombardment of Solum (April, 1941); H.M.A.S. Stuart.\n\nThe majority of the R.A.N. ships then in the Middle East participated in the evacuations of Greece and Crete.\n\nAn outstanding contribution of H.M.A. ships to the work in the Mediterranean was their pioneering of the “Tobruk Ferry Service,” which H.M.A. destroyers inaugurated carrying supplies from Mersa Matruh and Alexandria to the besieged troops at Tobruk. It was on this service that the Waterhen and Parramatta were lost.\n\nIn the Persian Gulf, in August, 1941, H.M.S. Kanimbla (Australian-manned) and Yarra helped to immobilize Iranian warships in the Karun River, and captured several Axis merchant ships at Bandar Shapur.\n\nThe R.A.N. was again represented at the landings in North Africa, Sicily and Italy.\n\nAtlantic.—Apart from the work done by individual Australian personnel on loan to the Royal Navy, the Atlantic was the scene of H.M.A.S. Australia’s activities. The most interesting incident in which she was involved was the operation off Dakar (July and September, 1940). In the second phase of that undertaking, she put out of action a Vichy French Fantasque class destroyer. Before leaving Dakar, the Australia herself was slightly damaged.\n\nIndian Ocean.—In March, 1941, H.M.A.S. Canberra, on patrol with H.M.S. Leander, intercepted the German raider supply ship Coburg and the tanker Ketty Brovig, whose crews scuttled their ships to prevent capture.\n\nIn November of the same year, the Sydney sank, and was sunk by the German surface raider Steiermark. As there has been no trace of the Sydney’s 645 officers and men, the story of the action had to be reconstructed from accounts given by the raider’s survivors, 317 of whom reached Australia. Apparently the action was fought about 300 miles off the West Australian coast. Darkness came with both ships on fire. The enemy abandoned their vessel, which subsequently blew up and sank. From their boats, the Germans saw the Sydney disappear over the horizon. She was then on fire amidships, and that was the last seen of her.\n\nJapan’s Entry into the War\n\nWhen Japan struck, it soon became clear that Australia was in grave danger not only of heavy attacks but even of invasion. From these dangers she has been preserved, partly by her own exertions but chiefly by the great, unparalleled and magnificent achievement of the United States which embarked upon two major strategic plans.\n\n(1) To maintain and to strengthen U. S. communications with the Australian seaboard;\n\n(2) To utilize Australia as a major base from which to conduct the forthcoming campaign in New Guinea waters for the recovery of the Philippines.\n\nWhen Japan commenced hostilities, the Royal Australian Navy was already represented in the Singapore area by the destroyer Vampire and four Australian minesweeping vessels. Three days later, the Vampire was on the destroyer screen of H.M.S. Prince of Wales and Repulse when they were sunk by Japanese torpedo bombers off Malaya. The Vampire picked up 225 survivors.\n\nOn the night of January 26, 1942, the Vampire, with H.M. destroyer Thanet, engaged in an enemy cruiser and three destroyers off the eastern coast of Malaya. One Japanese destroyer was sunk and another driven ashore. H.M.S. Thanet was lost in this action. The Vampire herself was sunk by Japanese aircraft in the Bay of Bengal in April, 1942.\n\nMeanwhile, during January, the R.A.N. forces in the Singapore-Malaya area had been strengthened by the arrival of H.M.A. cruiser Hobart, H.M.A. escort vessel Yarra, and three more Australian minesweeping vessels.\n\nIn the weeks which followed, the Australian minesweeping vessels, in particular, did valuable work. Their duties ranged from the rescuing of shipwrecked crews to anti-submarine patrols and the escorting of fleeing merchant ships. Throughout the evacuation of Sumatra and Java they carried out similar tasks and did valuable demolition work.\n\nThe Battle of Java Sea was fought on February 27, and on the following night H.M. A cruiser Perth (with U.S.S. Houston) was sunk by Japanese ships in Sunda Strait. On March 4, the Yarra was sunk after a brief but heroic action against three Japanese heavy cruisers and four destroyers. A small motor minesweeper and two merchant ships in company with the Yarra also were destroyed.\n\nTwo days earlier, the last R.A.N. personnel were evacuated from Java. The seven Australian minesweepers were the last Australian ships to leave, and they reached their home waters safely.\n\nTasks of the Royal Australian Navy\n\nConvoy duties.—The development, first of Japan’s and later of the United Nations’ offensive in the Southwest Pacific placed a dual task upon Australia’s Navy: On the one hand, Australian ships, with those of Britain and America, had to play their part in maintaining the long lines of communication between Australia and her Allies, and in the task force operations for the recapture of strategic islands. On the other hand, Australia’s own 12,000-mile coastline and the sea supply lines to Darwin, Torres Straits, New Guinea, and Papua had to be patrolled.\n\nIf the first of these tasks has been the more spectacular, the second has been none the less vital; and, at least, in its earlier stages, equally difficult. Before United States surface units reached the New Guinea area, the R.A.N. carried on surface escort work in these waters unaided.\n\nIn January, 1942, H.M.A. ships escorted the first large-scale reinforcements, with supplies, to Papua. They also escorted A.I.F. transports to such points as Dutch Timor and Ambon.\n\nThe establishment of an advanced operational base at Milne Bay was the keystone of the movement to drive the Japanese from the northern shores of New Guinea. From Milne Bay the smaller units of the R.A.N., particularly the Australian minesweeping vessels, carried the Allied advance to Por- lock Harbor, Oro Bay, and Buna, frequently in the face of enemy air attacks.\n\nThe tanks and artillery which set the seal of success on that phase of the Allied campaign were carried in Australian and Dutch merchant ships, escorted by A.M.S. vessels. The small warships themselves carried from Milne Bay the troops who made the flank attack at Cape Endaiadere.\n\nMuch of the success of that north coast drive was due to the work of the R.A.N. survey ships, which, working ahead of the advancing forces, charted their way through reef-studded waters.\n\nMeanwhile, the wisdom of convoying on the eastern coast of the Australian mainland itself had been emphasized by sporadic visits by Japanese submarines to the route linking Australia’s main industrial centers with the battle front. The fact that there have been no enemy submarine attacks in Australian coastal waters since June, 1943, is an illustration of the development of the Australian Navy’s anti-submarine work, and of the collaboration of the Royal Australian Air Force.\n\nJust as Japan’s failure to maintain her sea communications has been a strong factor in the turn of the tide of war in the Pacific, so the maintenance of the sea lanes from Australia to the scene of the fighting has been a vital contribution to the achievements of the American land and air forces. It is a task which will not diminish as the spearheads of the Allied attack continue to advance.\n\nTask Force work.—While this work was in progress, larger units of the Royal Australian Navy had been assigned to the Task Forces operating under the general control of the United States Commander of Allied Naval Forces, Southwest Pacific.\n\nApart from their unending duty of policing the transocean routes within the area, these ships have taken part in practically every one of the series of amphibious operations which have marked the steady driving back of the Japanese in the Southwest Pacific and the reoccupation of strategic points by the Allies. In many instances, the Task Force was under the command of a Royal Navy Flag officer, on loan to the Royal Navy, and wearing his flag in the Australian flagship. Until June, 1942, the officer concerned was Rear Admiral J. G. Crace, C.B., who was then succeeded by Rear Admiral V. A. C. Crutchley, V.C., D.S.C. In June, 1944, Rear Admiral Crutchley was succeeded by Commodore J. A. Collins, C.B., R.A.N. Commodore Collins is the first graduate of the Royal Australian Naval College to become a Commodore First Class, and the first graduate of the College to command the Royal Australian Naval Squadron.\n\nService with the Royal Navy.—From its earliest days, Australia’s Navy has regarded itself virtually as an integral part of the Royal Navy, seeking to build its own history on the rich traditions and heritage of the Mother Service. A country with a population as small as Australia’s could not, of itself, maintain a Navy large enough to completely defend herself. Yet the defense of the Empire in general is a direct contribution to the defense of Australia’s own shores; and, no matter who the enemy may be, those shores cannot always be most logically defended in Australian waters. Hence Australian ships and sailors must be able to work in close collaboration with others. What better storehouse of knowledge and experience could there be than the Royal Navy? Sound reasoning and filial sentiment alike dictate that course.\n\nThus, for many years, the Royal Australian Navy has followed a system whereby a certain number of its permanent officers gain experience in the Royal Navy’s big fleets, while, in exchange, a proportionate number of Royal Navy officers bring their experience and training to units of Australia’s fleet.\n\nThis system was carried a step farther as soon as the present war broke out, when the Admiralty accepted the Australian Naval Board’s offer to contribute personnel on “outright loan” to the Royal Navy, for service outside Australia. Under what was termed the “Yatchtsman’s Scheme,” volunteers were divided into two age groups. Those over 30 were required to pass the navigation tests for the Yachtmaster’s Certificate, and were granted commissions before leaving Australia. Those under 30 reached the United Kingdom as ratings, were trained in craft ranging from destroyers downwards, and were then sent to a shore establishment (H.M.S. King Alfred) to complete courses for their commissions.\n\nThe first batch of volunteers under the “Yatchtsman Scheme” left Australia for Britain in January, 1940, and the last group enlisted under that system sailed in February, 1942. Since then, a few have returned to Australia, being replaced by men who saw service, or received their preliminary training, in Australian ships or establishments.\n\nIn June, 1944, there were approximately 500 Australians serving on loan with the Royal Navy, of whom more than 400 were members of the Royal Australian Naval Volunteer Reserve.\n\nA wealth of experience in a wide variety of duties prepared the Australians for their parts in the Navy’s vital role in the invasion of Europe. History has shown that the most difficult phases of any invasion movement are the passage of troops and material across the water, and their transference from ship to hostile shore. For the Australians—as for all men of all services—D-Day represented the climax of years of arduous training and still more arduous actions.\n\nThe fact that the Australians were serving, not in groups, but as individuals scattered throughout the vast Armada, meant that they had representatives in practically every phase of the Navy’s invasion duties. There were Australians in the minesweepers whose long task commenced nearly 24 hours before the first landings; in the cruisers and destroyers which bombarded the enemy shores or escorted convoys across the Channel; in the first wave of landing craft to reach the Normandy beaches, and in the subsequent waves which poured in reinforcements of men and material. Australia was strongly represented in the flotillas of motor torpedo boats and other fast craft which helped to screen the convoys and to fight the battle which thwarted the attempts of enemy surface vessels to penetrate to the invasion area.\n\nThose who were in United Kingdom waters, and others who earlier returned to Australia, gained wide experience in the implementing of that sea power which has paved the way to final victory.\n\nMeanwhile, another section of the Royal Australian Navy has been doing sterling work far from Australian waters. The Australian shipbuilding program included a number of Australian minesweeping vessels built for the Royal Navy. Eight of these, manned by Australians, were temporarily attached to the Commander in Chief of the Levant during that phase of the Mediterranean campaign which culminated in the Allied occupation of Sicily.\n\nThe ships involved were: H.M.A.S. Cairns, Cessnock, Gawler, Geraldton, Ipswich, Lismore, Maryborough, and Wollongong. They served in close collaboration with the Royal Navy in convoying transports and landing craft, and in general patrol duties, as well as in providing anti-submarine screens for the Sicilian campaign.\n\nIn April, 1944, although the Royal Australian Navy was heavily involved in the fighting in the Southwest Pacific, it also was well represented in the Royal Navy’s Eastern Fleet. Some of them were in the cosmopolitan force which on May 17 appeared off the southern coast of Java to screen aircraft carriers for the successful bomber attack on the Japanese-held naval base at Surabaya.\n\nShipbuilding Program\n\nThe R.A.N. commenced this war with a small but well-balanced fleet, comprising two 8-inch cruisers; four 6-inch cruisers; five destroyers; one survey vessel; one fleet auxiliary; one depot ship.\n\nObviously, such a force was not sufficient to meet the demands of a war which called not only for the policing of Australia’s own waters, but for active participation in the general war at sea. Three methods of expansion were adopted:\n\n(a) Conversion of merchant ships for naval use (as armed merchant cruisers—later converted to landing craft, infantry, auxiliary minesweeping vessels, store carriers, and other miscellaneous craft);\n\n(b) The construction of new ships in Australia —tribal class destroyers, frigates, Australian minesweeping vessels, boom defense vessels, “Fairmile” patrol boats, and miscellaneous craft;\n\n(c) The acquisition of ships from the Royal Navy—the 8-inch cruiser Shropshire was Britain’s gift to Australia to replace H.M.A.S. Canberra, when the latter was lost by enemy action; 20 of the Australian-built Australian minesweeping vessels were constructed for the Royal Navy; six destroyers (4 N-class and 2 Q-class) are manned by Australians, whose pay is borne by the R.A.N., but all other expenses are borne by the Admiralty.\n\nThe largest warships built in Australia during this war are three Tribal class destroyers. Of these, H.M.A.S. Arunla and Warramunga already have seen considerable action against Japanese positions in the Southwest Pacific. The third (bearing the name H.M.A.S. Bataan in complement to the United States forces) is now fitting out.\n\nMore recently, the construction of frigates has been undertaken in Australia.
