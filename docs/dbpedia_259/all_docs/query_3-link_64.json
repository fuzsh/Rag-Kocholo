        "text": "Air War in the Spanish Civil War 1936-39\n\n1936\n\nJuly 1936\n\nThe Spanish Civil War started on 17 July.\n\nFuerza Aérea de la República Española - Republican Air Force\n\nInitially, the Republican Government had more than half of the Breguet XIXs of Grupo No 31 and all of the Nieuport 52 C1s of Grupos de caza No 11 at Getafe (near Madrid) and No 13 at El Prat de Llobregat (near Barcelona), while the Fokker F.VII 3ms and L. A. P. E. Douglas DC-2s and all training aircraft were at Cuatro Vientos, Los Alcázares and Alcalá de Henares. Most of the Aeronáutica Naval aircraft, the 27 Vickers Vildebeests, seven Dornier Wal and nearly 30 Savoia S-62 seaplanes, twelve old Martinsyde F.4 fighters and seven Hispano E.30 trainers, remained loyal to the government at the San Javier, Barcelona and Mahón bases.\n\nThe third fighter unit, Grupo de Caza No 12, based at Armilla (near Granada), had been disbanded a few days before the military uprising. One of its escuadrillas, commanded by capitán José Méndez Iriarte, was posted to Madrid. The other unit, led by capitán Joaquín Pérez y Martínez de la Victoria, sent its aircraft to the Parque Regional de Aviación (depot) at Tablada airfield, near Seville.\n\nAs for military pilots in Spain, some 215 (38 per cent) chose to side with the Republic Government and around 175 (30 per cent) rebelled, whereas the rest, about 185 (32 per cent), were neutral and did not serve either side.\n\nAs for personnel, in Madrid those who supported the Republican government included Grupo No 11 CO, capitán Manuel Cascóon Briega, and two capitanes jefes de escuadrilla (squadron commanders), Avertano González Fernández-Muñiz and José Méndez Iriarte. Other Republic supporters were teniente Francisco Márquez Yanguas and suboficiales Antonio Andrés Pascual, Gonzalo García San Juan, Andrés García La Calle and Manuel Aguirre López and cabos Jesús García Herguido, Roberto Alonso Santamaría and Rafael Peña Dugo. They were subsequently joined by tenientes Luis Iglesias Gracia and Ramón Puparelli Francia. Upon the outbreak of the conflict these pilots defended the vast central front, as well as the north of Spain, and they were soon reinforced by volunteer pilots and foreign mercenaries.\n\nTotally about 60 of 135 acquired Ni-H.52 fighters remained in service in government-held areas.\n\nThe central aeronautical organs, such as the Dirección General de Aeronáutica, the Oficina de Mando (Headquarters) and the Jefaturas de Aviación (Aviation Command Offices), remained loyal to the Madrid authorities. As regards territorial scope, out of the four large units, the three Escuadras Aéreas and the Fuerzas Aéreas de África, the main core of the 1a Escuadra in Madrid and the 3a Escuadra in Barcelona, proved loyal to the government. The Servicio de Instruccíón y Material (Training and Materiel Service), the Aeronáutica Naval and L. A. P. E. also remained loyal to the government and elements of them formed the basis of the 2a Escuadra, based at Los Alcázares, Murcia while part of their air equipment served to reinforce the 1a and 3a Escuadras.\n\nThe L. A. P. E. operated Douglas DC-2s, Fokker F.VII 3ms and Ford F.5s from Barajas airport, Madrid. The DC-2s, the most modern and fastest aircraft in Spain at the time which out-paced the Aviación Militar Nieuport 52 standard fighters, were immediately militarized and fitted with bombsights and even defensive machine gun positions, to be fired through the side windows. Most of the companys pilots, led by teniente Joaquín Mellado Pascual, were retired military pilots, supernumeraries or reserve pilots and therefore all of them experienced in the military use of transport aircraft. These civil aircraft, once militarised by the Republican government, carried out important long- range bombing sorties on the rebel air bases in North Africa, Seville, León or Logroño, as well as liaison flights to the northern coast of Spain, landing in Asturias and Santander.\n\nThe 3a Escuadra de Aviación was at El Prat de Llobregat air base in Barcelona, where the commanding officer was teniente coronel Felipe Díaz Sandino, a senior officer with a sound Republican record. Grupo de caza No 13, with a single Nieuport 52 escuadrilla, was based there with about six Breguet XIX reconnaissance aircraft of the escuadra staff. Díaz Sandino neutralised his second-in-command, comandante Castro Garnica, and some other officers who supported the coup, and allowed the popular militias entry into the base. These militias were under the command of retired infantry comandante Alfonso de los Reyes González de Cárdenas, whom Díaz Sandino appointed second-in-command of the base. With the few Breguet XIXs serviceable, they bombed the barracks of the rebel forces, and this contributed to their prompt surrender.\n\nPilots loyal to the Republic at Grupo No 13 included capitán Francisco Ponce de León y Díaz de Velasco and oficiales subalternos Amador Silverio Jiménez and Adonis Rodríguez González, as well as sargentos José Cabré Planas, Jesús García Herguido, Fernando Roig Villalta, Alfonso Jiménez Bruguet, Emilio Villaceballos García and Jaime Buyé Berni. These men, together with the Ni-H.52s of the escuadrilla, covered the Aragon. Three pilots, Ponce de León, sargento Emilio Villaceballos and teniente Amador Silverio Jiménez, were even deployed to airfields in the north, the latter two aviators flying Ni-H.52s to Bilbao to cover the Bay of Biscay front.\n\nAt Los Alcázares airfield at Mar Menor, where the Escuela de Tiro y Bombardeo Aéreo (Aerial Gunnery and Bombing School) was based, there was a Ni-H.52 flight available for gunnery practice. Its CO was teniente Aurelio Villimar Magdalena, and he was supported by teniente Antonio de Haro López and sargentos pilotos José Jiménez Resino, Augusto Martín Campos, Ángel López Pastor and cabo Rafael Robledano. These resources were sufficient to cover the eastern and central Andalusian fronts, and also to detach elements to the two airfields at Guadix, in Granada, and El Rompedizo, in Málaga.\n\nThe Aeronáutica Naval - the Escuela de Aeronáutica and the aero naval Workshops were located on the quayside at Contradique, Barcelona. The regular officers of the Cuerpo General de la Armada were all in favour of the coup and for that reason they allowed the arrival at the base, by air, of general Manuel Goded Llopis, who had been posted there to command the rebel forces in Barcelona. This general, who was in Palma de Majorca, left the Mahón naval air station for Barcelona in a Savoia S-62 seaplane and took command of the headquarters of the 4a División Orgánica. Once he had left the naval air station, the junior officers posted there arrested their seniors and took control. It was then that the Escuadrilla Escuela seaplanes, the Savoia S-62s, Macchi M-18s and Dornier Wal operated in close support with the Aviación Militar Breguet XIXs, until the capitulation of Godeds forces.\n\nAs for the Marina de Guerra air arm located at the Base Aeronaval at San Javier and also at the Mar Menor, in Murcia, there was an Escuadrilla de Combate y Acompañamiento equipped with Martinsyde F 4 Buzzard fighters. Although outdated, these aircraft - 20 of which had been supplied to Spain in the early 1920s - would be briefly used during the early days of the military uprising. This unit was led by oficial tercero Carlos Lázaro Casajust, who commanded auxiliares (NCOs) Javier Jover Rovira, Herminio Moro Álvarez and Manuel Mora Deutú. Additional fighter pilots, although serving within army Ni-H.52 escuadrillas, subsequently joined the naval air arm. They were auxiliares Luis Alonso Vega, Carlos Colom Moliner, Tomás Baquedano Moreno, Eduardo Guaza Marín and Antonio Blanch Latorre.\n\nA Nieuport fighter patrulla was established within Escuadrilla Y-2 at Los Alcázares. Teniente Aurelio Villimar assumed command of the unit and it included sargento Fernando Romero Tejero.\n\nAurelio Villimar was subsequently relieved by teniente Alarcón.\n\nDuring the first phase of the civil war the government fighter force was poorly utilised, being dispersed in small flights of two or three aircraft only. Because of this policy equipment soon became worn out, resulting in serious losses that decimated the ranks of the Republican fighter pilots.\n\nIn July, Isidoro Jiménez García was promoted to capitán.\n\nOn 20 July the newly appointed Prime Minister of the Spanish Republic, José Giral, approached the French government for aeroplanes to help it eradicate the threat posed by the Nationalists. The Spanish Aviación Militar was already primarily equipped with French-designed machines such as the Hispano-Nieuport Ni-H.52 sesquiplane fighter, numerous examples of which had been built under licence in Spain from 1929, and the Breguet XIX reconnaissance bomber. France quickly prepared to send more modern aircraft to its neighbour, these being primarily Potez 540 twin-engined bombers and Dewoitine D.372 monoplane (parasol) fighters.\n\nWhen the civil war broke out cabo José Riverola Grúas was posted to the Wal-equipped Grupo de Hidros No 6 at Los Alcázares airfield, in Murcia. Having logged many flying hours, he was promoted to sargento mecánico and took a pilots course at La Ribera.\n\nAt the outbreak of hostilities cabo Leopoldo Morquillas Rubio was on leave in Madrid, but he volunteered for duty at Getafe airfield.\n\nThe shortage of flying personnel prompted him to apply for a commission as an air gunner-bombardier, and he duly flew sorties in Breguet XIXs and Potez 540s over the sierra and to the outskirts of Madrid. During this period Morquillas flew with pilots Arcega, Areán, Cremades, Cascón, Jiménez, Hortelano, Lurueñba, Peña, Ramos, Ricote, Salvoch and sargento Vicente Valls Bort.\n\nHe was shot down three times (once on 28 October 1936), twice while flying Breguet XIXs and once in a Potez 540.\n\nThe start of the civil war caught Chindasvinto González García on leave in Madrid, and he joined his unit on 18 July. Ten days later he was posted to Getafe airfield, from where he operated as a sargento mecánico with the Escuadrilla Mixta de Breguet XIX y Nieuport 52 led by capitán Juan Quintana Ladrón de Guevara. The unit moved first to Don Benito airfield and then to Herrera del Duque for operations on the Extremadura front.\n\nGerardo Gil Sánchez, who was born in Madrid in 1911, joined the service in July 1928 and graduated from the Escuela de Mecánicos at Cuatro Vientos in December 1930. He was subsequently posted as a cabo mecánico to the Escuadrilla de Hidros of the Fuerzas Aéreas de África based at El Atalayón. By the outbreak of the civil war Gil had been posted as a cabo mecánico de vuelo (flight engineer) to the Destacamento de Hidros of Grupo No 6 at Pollensa, on Majorca. With the island a Nationalist stronghold, Gil was forced to escape in a motorboat on 19 July, being picked up by a Wal flying boat of the Barcelona-based Aeronáutica Naval.\n\nIn July 1936, sargento piloto Manuel Aguirre López was posted to the 2a Escuadrilla of the Grupo de Caza No 12. Commanded by capitan Jose Méndez Iriarte, the unit was transferred to Getafe, and after the outbreak of war Aguirre took part in aerial combat over the Sierra and Talavera fronts.\n\nFuerza Aérea Nacionales (Arma de Aviación) - Nationalist Air Force\n\nFollowing the coup, the Nationalists had nearly half of the Breguet XIXs at the León, Logroño, Seville and Africa air bases; nine Dornier Wal flying boats in Africa and Pollensa; five Savoia S-62s at Marín, Pontevedra; three military Fokker F.VII 3ms in Seville and Africa, and a Douglas DC-2 - although there was not a single operational fighter, they would soon have three Nieuport 52 C1s that landed in error at Armilla air base, Granada and another one which changed sides from Madrid to Burgos and some others which were gradually finishing overhaul at the Parque Sur de Aviación (South Aviation Maintenance Park) at Tablada, Seville. This made a total of about 100 aircraft available to the rebels.\n\nThe 2a Escuadra in Seville and the Fuerzas Aéreas de África in Tetuán, joined the rebels, as did the Grupos de Reconocimiento Divisionarios No 21 in León and No 23 in Logroño, which then became part of a new body called Fuerzas Aéreas del Norte.\n\nThe 2a Escuadra in Seville and the Fuerzas Aéreas de África remained under a single high command, which was entrusted to general Alfredo Kindelán, who was appointed chief of the Nationalist Servicios del Aire.\n\nThe monarchist journalist Luis Bolín journeyed to Rome on 19 July to ask Mussolini for transport aircraft to assist the Nationalist cause, while Franco was in contact with the Italian Consul in Tangier.\n\nAt first the rebels' requests were brushed aside, Mussolini simply scribbling 'NO' at the bottom of a telegram from Franco requesting 12 bombers or civilian transports, while on another the dictator remarked dismissively, 'FILE'. However, as the telegrams from Tangier streamed in, and Russian support of the Left appeared unlikely, Mussolini's interest in the developments in Spain grew, especially when Franco offered the flattering promise to emulate Italian Fascism in his country. On 25 July, Mussolini ordered the transfer of 12 SIAI S.81 tri-motor bombers by air and the shipping of 24 CR.32 fighters to Spanish Morocco to aid the Nationalists. In order to disguise the supply of these aircraft, the deal between Italy and the Nationalists was listed as a 'private sale'. During the evening of 27 July, arrangements were made for the despatch of the 12 S.81s. They were to be assembled at Elmas military aerodrome near Cagliari, in Sardinia, prior to being flown to Spain. As part of this ruse, Italian pilots and ground personnel were enrolled on a voluntary basis into the Tercio Extranjero (the Spanish Foreign Legion) with false identities.\n\nAfter a meeting on 25 July, Adolf Hitler authorised German help to the Nationalist cause under the codename Untemehmen Feuerzauber (Operation Magic Fire).\n\nAs part of this, a fleet of Ju 52/3ms under the command of Generalleutnant Helmuth Wilberg was to take General Francos forces from Tetuán in Spanish Morocco to Seville. Wilberg was to establish a new, highly covert Special Staff to be known as Sonderstab W after its leader.\n\nThe initial German help to the Nationalists were in the form of military technicians, 20 pieces of artillery, ammunition, 20 Ju 52/3ms and six Heinkel He 51s (which received the type identification number 2).\n\nOn 27 July, the pilots of the Luftwaffe's fighter units, the He 51-equipped I./JG 132 Richthofen at Döberitz and the Ar 65- and Ar 68-equipped I./JG 134 Horst Wessel at Dortmund, received an appeal for volunteers to join a mysterious expeditionary force destined for an unidentified foreign country. In some cases, however, word seems to have got out, as in the case of Oberleutnant Hannes Trautloft. Trautloft was actually serving with 9. Staffel of II./JG 134, which had located to Köln-Butzweilerhof following the occupation of the Rhineland. He recalled:\n\nOn 28 July 1936, whilst serving as an oberleutnant with 9./JG 134 at Köln, I received a telephone call from my Kommandeur, Hauptmann Horst Dinort. His first question was Are you engaged to be married? I stated that I was not. He then swore me to secrecy and began to explain to me about the situation in Spain and the need for well-trained pilots in that country. Before he even had the chance to ask me if I would be prepared to go there, I said to him I volunteer!\n\nDinort then told me to get ready to travel to Dortmund within the next two hours, where I would receive orders directly from a Geschwaderkommodore. He also ordered me to maintain absolute discretion about the whole thing, for it would not be easy to explain to my comrades what I was doing when they saw me hurriedly packing my bags!\n\nInitial pilots were Oberleutnant Hannes Trautloft of 9. Staffel of II./JG 134, Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel and Leutnant Wolf-Heinrich von Houwald, both also from III./JG 134, and Oberleutnant Kraft Eberhardt, Leutnant Gerhard Klein and Leutnant Ekkehard Hefter. During a farewell inspection along with the rest of the group by General Erhard Milch and Generalleutnant Wilberg, they were told not to enter combat under any circumstances at their eventual destination - the role of the Heinkel pilots would be purely to protect and defend the Junkers transports that would be ferrying troops.\n\nAt the Petersen Dock in Hamburg, the pilots and other personnel of the volunteer group boarded the Woerman Line cargo vessel SS Usaramo, onto which they assisted with the loading of 773 crates of equipment. According to Trautloft, I would quickly learn that our aircraft were stowed in disassembled components.\n\nAround midnight on 31 July, the Usaramo sailed from Hamburg bound for Cádiz, in southern Spain.\n\nGerman military aid was proving crucial to the success of the Nationalist war effort. The first ten Ju 52/3ms donated to Franco had arrived in Spanish Morocco, and they were put to immediate use ferrying badly needed troops and ammunition from the Ejército de Africa over the Straits of Gibraltar to the mainland. Their presence greatly accelerated what became known as the puente aéreo, which was the first large-scale airlift in history. Between 29 July and 5 August, these aircraft flew 1500 men, including six assault battalions, from Morocco to Seville, and in all 10,500 men were transferred to Spain from North Africa in July and August 1936.\n\nIn July, Julio Salvador Díaz-Benjumea was sent to Gancedos squadron, at Tablada, and moved with them to Algeciras and Malaga on the morning on 18 July.\n\nSalvador then began flying in Nieuport 52s, and quickly moved to Burgos with Ramón Alvarez Senra.\n\nCapitán Gancedo, teniente Arija, teniente Fernandez Tudela and teniente Valiente and an aero club pilot, Manolo Camino, (who was killed in a flying accident on 1 August), flew their Ni-H.52 into Seville in the end of July.\n\nThe Seville fighters sometimes operated from Cordoba, in an attempt to avoid frequent attacks by the Government Air Force.\n\nIn Africa, Luis Rambaud Gomá and Manrique Montero Mera took on the task of protecting the aircraft used in the air lift and they waited until the sea convoy had crossed (5 August), before transferring to the Peninsula.\n\nAviación del Tercio\n\nAt 05:35 on 30 July, twelve unmarked S.81, commanded by Tenente Colonnello Ruggero Bonomi (Francesco Federigi), took off from Elmas in Sardinia for Nador (Melilla) in Spanish Morocco. The route of the flight ran over the Mediterranean Sea and then along the African coast without refuelling stops. The formation was divided into four groups with three airplanes in each. A Cant Z.506 with General Giuseppe Valle was accompanying the bombers along the way and soon signalled strong wind at high altitude. For about an hour the airplanes were flying 1,000 m above the sea. When the wind eased, the bombers climbed to 4,200 m. The sky was overcast, the clouds were driven by wind called libeccio and individual groups of airplanes lost contact with each other. The airspeed dropped much below the planned and fuel consumption was higher than planned. Low cloud base hampered positioning and observation of two ships along the route which were to facilitate it. After five hours of flight the airplanes reached the traverse of Oran.\n\nAt 10:30, the airplane of Tenente Angelini separated from the group led by Maggiore Altomare. After having run out of fuel Angelinis Savoia without radio contact turned towards the Algerian coast. A moment later the airplane plummeted into the sea 80 km north of Oran; the crew was killed. (At 11:29, a passenger aircraft of Belgian SABENA spotted the floating wreckage, three survivors were also visible. The Belgians sent a SOS signal but the rescue did not come on time.\n\nThe remaining aircraft managed to reach the African coast, but two more Savoias were lost. The bomber of Capitano Ferrari landed without damage on the right bank of the Muluya (Moulouya) river on the beach near its estuary. The landing site was located 3 km away from the border of Algeria and Spanish Morocco, but sadly on the side of the French colony. The bomber was captured by local authorities. The captured aircraft, serial number MM20467 was returned to the Italians in October of 1938. It was temporarily registered as civil I-MARU for the ferry flight to Italy. The third bomber of Tenente Mattalia crashed during emergency landing at Zaida (Saidia), also near the Algerian border. This crash was caused by the lack of fuel. Mattalia and three other crewmembers were killed in the crash.\n\nBonomi landed as the first at Nador airfield around 11.45 with the remaining eight following him.\n\nUpon landing the crews were enrolled into the Tercio Extranjero and thus becoming the Aviación del Tercio with the nine S.81s.\n\nThe bombers were in turn subordinated to the head of the Nationalist air forces, general Alfredo Kindelán y Duany, who took his orders from the commander of the African Army, general Franco.\n\nOperations\n\n18 July 1936\n\nThe best-equipped Aviación Militar air units were at the Getafe, Cuatro Vientos and Alcalá de Henares air bases in Madrid. Based there were the 1a Escuadra de Aviación, the Escuela de Observadores, service units and the Escuela de Vuelo ? Combate. The commanding officers of the first two air bases, tenientes coroneles Antonio Camacho Bemítez and Francisco León Trejo, were loyal to Republican authority, whereas the third, comandante Rafael Gómez Jordana de Sousa, who was with the rebels, was not in Madrid at the time of the coup, but on summer leave. Camacho Benítez and León Trejo, with decisiveness and energy, managed to neutralize the group of officers, NCOs and a few other individuals, who were involved in the military uprising, either by expelling them from the air base or by sending them home as detainees, thus stopping them from taking any decisive action for the coup.\n\nThus, in the Spanish capital, it was the government aircraft that bombed the barracks of the rebel Ejército de Tierra units at Carabanchel, La Montaña, Getafe and Leganés, consequently preventing the rebel forces taking to the streets of Madrid and seizing the administrative and communication areas. In conjunction with these air strikes, the peoples armed militias or the police forces loyal to the government eventually managed to enter the barracks and capture the rebels.\n\nOne of the rebel officers at the Getafe air base, the then capitán piloto ingeniero aeronáutico José Gomá Orduña, offered a very accurate description of the decisive action of the government aviation in Madrid to crush the coup. Gomá states that the situation facing a quartered garrison, standing alone for hours, even days, waiting for other forces to arrive and act together, was utter suicide. He recalls that even without the arrival of the expected reinforcements, if rebel airmen had flown aircraft over Madrid, the troops would have eventually poured into the streets. He wrote:\n\nImmediately after the flights over La Montaña barracks, disaster struck. The role of aviation was decisive. One has to admit that, even though with aviation deployed against them, if the [rebel] ground forces had launched an assault, Madrid would not have remained red, because the aviation would have not stopped an attack by dropping 10-kilogram bombs. But aviation simply had the threat of stopping the plan, thus gaining Madrid for the Republic.\n\nSargento Jesús García Herguido of the Grupo de Caza No 13 flew his first mission of the war when he flew a bombing mission from Prat de Llobregat with a Breguet XIX.\n\n19 July 1936\n\nThe figurehead of the revolution, general José Sanjurjo was killed when his aircraft crashed on take-off from Portugal, and this and other reasons led to general Francisco Franco, who outranked general Emilio Mola, become the preferred leader of the rebellion.\n\nOn the same day, general Franco flew from the Canary Islands to Tetuán and took command of the army in Africa.\n\nAt 23:00, Tablada was bombed by Fokker VIIs.\n\n20 July 1936\n\nAt 06:00, Tablada was bombed by DC-2s.\n\nDuring the night of 19-20 July, the Nationalists made use of the 1st fighter force, which was being maintained at constant readiness, but the DC-2 attack was so sudden that the defenders did not have time to take off. Three hours later, the first Nationalist Fokker VII arrived bringing legionaries, and this received a cool reception, despite the fact that it had come from Africa.\n\nSargento Jesús García Herguido of the Grupo de Caza No 13 flew a bombing mission from Prat de Llobregat with a Breguet XIX when he targeted the rebel-held San Andrés Barracks in Barcelona.\n\nJuan José Armario Álvarez flew his first operational sortie when he bombed the Atarazanas barracks while flying an S.62.\n\nThe first fighter operations in the south began at Tablada, with aircraft supplied by the Parque Regional (now Maestranza Aerea). On the same day brigada Ramón Senra Àlvarez was instructed to take Nieuport aircraft No 66 to Tetuan, and while he was there capitán Manrique Montero suggested that they should join forces to try and form a fighter squadron. Senra would not fall in with this suggestion as he had orders to return to his base at Tablada.\n\n21 July 1936\n\nOn the morning, teniente Julio Salvador Díaz-Benjumea intercepted a Breguet XIX with a Getafe serial number. This aircraft from Pamplona, which had landed at Burgos, had been sent by general Mola to liaise with general Franco. The pilot, capitán Ángel Salas Larrazábal, had to extend his journey to Tetuan, which brought him the unexpected satisfaction of meeting Franco sooner than he had hoped.\n\nSargento Andrés García La Calle of 2a/11 (Ni-H.52) claimed a damaged Breguet XIX.\n\nThe Nationalists in Granada, which was and would continue to be isolated for a long time, received reinforcements in the form of a patrol of three Nieuport Ni-H.52s from the Getafe group. Unfortunately, these were sent there without knowledge of the fact that the aerodrome had changed hands only a few hours before. The three pilots, teniente Juan Prieto, sargento Gerardo Marin and cabo Laurentino Lozano were all taken prisoner.\n\n22 July 1936\n\nDuring the first advance on Villareal, a single Breguet flown by Ángel Salas succeeded in disrupting a counter-attack by Government troops.\n\n23 July 1936\n\nTeniente Narciso Bermúdes de Castro (Ni-H.52) claimed a Ni-H.52 at Píñar while operating from Granada.\n\nHe was flying one of the three Ni-H.52s captured at Grenanda on 21 July, when they landed there by mistake.\n\n25 July 1936\n\nCabo Roberto Alonso Santamaría of Grupo de Caza No 11 forced a Breguet XIX to land at Grajera airstrip. At the time he was flying a Ni-H.52.\n\nSargento Andrés García La Calle of 2a/11 (Ni-H.52) claimed his first victory when he claimed a Breguet XIX.\n\nA Breguet XIX heading from enemy territory landed at Getafe airfield. Coded 1-12, the aircraft belonged to 1a Escuadrilla of Grupo No 1 of the Fuerzas Aéreas de Africa, based at Tetuán. Sargento Félix Urtubi Ercilla had flown it across half the Iberian peninsula. The aircraft was also carrying the body of teniente Juan Miguel de Castro Gutiérrez, an Observador de Aeroplano from Grupo de Regulares No 1 based at Ceuta and Melilla. Urtubi Ercilla told journalists in Madrid:\n\nWe left Tetuán at 0600 hrs today. We were ordered to strafe and bomb the government column travelling from La Línea. There were three aircraft. At an altitude of 1000 ft over the Straits of Gibraltar I turned to the teniente and shot him four times - in the forehead, in the chest and through the mouth. I didnt give the traitor time to look at me in dismay and cry No! No!\n\nUnder the circumstances I was ready to flee to Valencia or Barcelona, cities which, according to the reports available in Morocco, had remained loyal to the Republic. I was ready to jump into the sea if the teniente was only wounded and reacted, but, as I suspected, he was dead. I flew into the darkness and made for here. I was ready to do anything. Id rather die than surrender to the traitors to the government.\n\nWith very little fuel left I landed at Getafe, and when the officers pointed their guns at me, I put mine to my temple and asked if Madrid was in Republican hands? If not Id have shot myself rather than surrender. The officers were so moved they embraced me. Then I handed over the corpse of the teniente, whose name I dont know. He wasnt carrying any documents.\n\nThis account is confirmed by sargento piloto Andrés García La Calle. When Urtubi Ercilla saw capitán Antonio Urzáiz Guzman - reputed to be a monarchist - on the tarmac at Getafe he thought that Madrid was in rebel hands. Although Urzáiz Guzman had indeed taught King Alfonso XIIIs children, he was a staunch defender of the Republican regime.\n\nUrtubi Ercilla was promoted to the rank of alferez and posted to Grupo de Caza No 11.\n\nWhile returning from a liaison mission in Africa, teniente Miguel Guerrero García (Ni-H.52) shot down a Málaga-based Dornier Wal over the Straits of Gibraltar.\n\nGuerrero was the Nationalist pilot who recorded the greatest number of victories during the opening stages of the war.\n\n27 July 1936\n\nThe first aerial combat in the North involved Ángel Salas. Over Somosierra, he had to fight off a Ni-H.52 attacking the Breguet XIXs he was escorting. His Dragon Rapide received two direct hits, but Salas continued to fly this machine until the middle of August, when a mixed Dragon-Fokker group was formed.\n\nTeniente Alarcón of the fighter patrulla of Escuadrilla Y-2 flew Ni-H.52 3-87 to Guadix, accompanied by sargento Fernando Romero Tejero in 3-24.\n\nAlarcón crashed on landing, suffering slight leg injuries. When replacement aircraft 3-42, flown by sargento Ángel López Pastor, arrived overhead Guadix, it was attacked in error by Romero Tejero! Fortunately, López Pastor escaped unscathed.\n\n28 July 1936\n\nAfter the arrival at Burgos of two Nationalist fighters from Tablada airfield, Seville, there was the first combat between Ni-H.52s from both sides of the conflict, over the Sierra de Guadarrama. Aircraft 3-43, flown by teniente Julio Salvador, hit another aircraft with machinegun fire and the republican aircraft fled, conspicuously hit, towards the Santillana dam.\n\nTeniente Salvadors aircraft, suffering from a faulty engine, had to land at the airfield of Los Negredos.\n\nIt is possible that Salvadors victim was teniente Francisco Márques Yanguas Benavides, who according to an official order of the republican Subsecretaría de la Aviación was killed on this day. Márques Yanguas was a fighter pilot of the former Grupo No 12 at Granada and he had flown to Getafe with capitán Méndez Iriarte's Escuadrilla. On 5 May 1938, Márques Yanguas was posthumously promoted to mayor de Caballeria.\n\nSargento Andrés García La Calle of Grupo No 11 at Getafe crash-landed Ni-H.52 11-33/3-58 on the Madrid sierra, where it was profusely photographed and presented by both sides as a shot down enemy.\n\nSargento Fernando Romero Tejero of the fighter patrulla of Escuadrilla Y-2 flew Ni-H.52 3-24 to Andújar airfield, in Jaén, to escort two Breguet XIXs.\n\nWhile based there he took off to intercept enemy aircraft, but engine failure caused him to force-land. Emerging from his wrecked fighter with both leg and eye injuries, Romero Tejero was admitted to hospital at Andújar and subsequently sent back to Los Alcazares on 30 July.\n\n29 July 1936\n\nGrenada-based, teniente Miguel Guerrero García (Ni-H.52) claimed a Vildebeest at Iznájar.\n\n30 July 1936\n\nSargento Andrés García La Calle of 2a/11 (Ni-H.52) claimed a Breguet XIX.\n\n31 July 1936\n\nBoth the Nationalist and Republican sides operated over Somosierra and two Nieuport Ni.52s fought with each other inconclusively at 08:30. Andrés García La Calle reported:\n\n\"On a surveillance flight over the south side of Somosierra, i.e. quite inside our territory, I caught a Nieuport by surprise, flying much lower than me...he didn't even see me. I calmly aimed, pulled the trigger and...no result...I aimed again, made a \"mortal\" pass but the machineguns kept on jammed. The other Nieuport, unperturbed despite his critical situation, kept on turning and climbing, always a perfect target...my opponent did not realise he should be \"dead\" by now and kept on climbing towards me...it came to my mind that I was unarmed but he was not...so, before giving him a chance to shoot at me... I turned away in a violent dive.\"\n\nLa Calle's opponent must have been capitán Ángel Salas, who wrote in his logbook:\n\n\"I fought another Nieuport, which fled as I reached his height.\"\n\nGrenada-based, teniente Miguel Guerrero García (Ni-H.52) claimed a Vildebeest at Iznalloz.\n\nTeniente Fernandez Tudela (Ni-H.52) was shot down at Córdoba by a Republican Douglas.\n\nAugust 1936\n\nBy August 1936 Spain was broadly cut in two, with general Mola's Ejercito National del Norte controlling much of the north from Pamplona and Saragossa in the east, over to León, Lugo and La Coruña in the northwest (excepting the Basque coastal area and hinterland around Gijon, Santander and Bilbao), to Teruel, Segovia and Cáceres in the south, while general Franco was gaining territory by advancing from the south and pushing on towards Córdoba. The rest of Spain, bar a few isolated Nationalist strongholds, was Republican.\n\nThe Nationalist goal was Madrid, symbolic, but held firmly by the Republicans. If Madrid could be taken, the Republican infrastructure would splinter and eventually collapse. To do this, Franco, with his forces now on the ground, intended to march his Legionnaires and Regulares north from Seville to Mérida and connect with Mola, before clearing Badajoz of enemy forces and establishing a link with Portugal, through which supplies would be brought. Following that, the way would be open for an advance on Madrid. Republican and Nationalist forces clashed seriously for the first time in the south on 5 August at Almendralejo, resulting in the Nationalist advance being halted and then coming under attack by Republican aircraft.\n\nHowever, the Republicans suffered from heavy casualties, as well as desertions, and fell back, allowing Franco's forces to resume their march and eventually hook up with Mola just north of Mérida. The general eastward advance on Madrid along the valley of the Tajo resumed on 20 August under the overall command of coronel Blanco Yagüe, a veteran of the Rif War.\n\nIn late August, an international agreement of non-intervention was drawn up and subscribed to by 27 nations, including France, Great Britain, Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union. Signatories were legally prevented from supporting either side in the Spanish conflict through the provision of military equipment. Apart from Great Britain, whose special economic and strategic interests in Spain and the Mediterranean forced it to observe strict neutrality in its dealings with the Nationalist and Republican regimes, the agreement was duly ignored by the remaining four signatories.\n\nGround Operations\n\n16 August 1936\n\nThe Spanish Republican Army landed on the coast of Majorca, under heavy bombardment by Italian aircraft. Capitán Alberto Bayo established a small base on the coast.\n\nFuerza Aérea de la República Española - Republican Air Force\n\nIn August, a number of Breguet XIXs were moved south to Andújar and Herrera del Duque to provide air cover to the Republican units retreating from Franco's columns advancing on Madrid.\n\nTwin-engined French Potez 540 bombers arrived at El Prat de Llobregat, in Barcelona, in early August, where they equipped the international Escadre Espana.\n\n14 Dewoitine D.372 parasol-winged fighters arrived in mid-August.\n\nIn August, sargento Andrés García La Calles fighter patrulla, made up of a Hawker Spanish Fury and two Nieuport Ni-H.52s flown by cabos Roberto Alonso Santamaría and Rafael Peña Dugo, moved to the Herrera del Duque and Don Benito airfields at Extremadura. The unit was commanded by teniente Ramón Puparelli Francia.\n\nLater in the month the unit was sent to Talavera de la Reina airfield, in Toledo.\n\nBecause of the overwhelming number of enemy CR.32s in the area, government pilots refused to fly alone from the late summer of 1936. Although the Jefatura de Aviación did not agree to their operating in groups, the pilots indiscipline was not punished.\n\nOn 2 August, two Ni-H.52s flew from El Prat de Llobregat to the forward airfield at Sariñena, in Huesca, escorting four Breguet XIXs during the flight. The Nieuports and their pilots, teniente Amador Silverio Jiménez and sargento Jesús García Herguido, remained at this location for some time.\n\nFellow Grupo de Caza No 13 pilots sargentos Fernando Roig Villalta, José Cabré Planas, Jaime Buyé Berni and Emilio Villaceballos were flown to Sariñena in Breguet XIXs, as was unit CO alférez Alfonso Jiménez Bruguet, and they all flew sorties in the Nieuports from the airfield. Jiménez pilots, most of whom were officially still sargentos, were promoted to alférez by the Catalan Generalitat authorities, whose Consejero de Defensa (Secretary of Defence) was teniente coronel de Aviación Felipe Díaz Sandino. These promotions were officially confirmed on 31 August according to a decree dated 27 September.\n\nThe Escuadrilla Mixta, based at Sariñena, was unofficially called Alas Rojas. This name was displayed on some of the units vehicles, and it was also the title of the newspaper published at the Republican airfield.\n\nOn 14 August capitán Isidoro Jiménez García was deployed to Sariñena to lead a three-aircraft Breguet XIX patrulla.\n\nShortly thereafter he became CO of the mixed Breguet XIX/Ni-H.52 Escuadrilla Mixta Alas Rojas, which also included some de Havilland DH 84 Dragons and DH 89 Dragon Rapides within its ranks.\n\nChindasvinto González García was promoted to sargento mecánico in August 1936.\n\nFrom Barcelona Gerardo Gil Sánchez was posted to Los Alcázares and, on 25 August, he joined the Escuela de Pilotos at La Ribera.\n\nFuerza Aérea Nacionales (Arma de Aviación) - Nationalist Air Force\n\nWhen the revolt started, capitán Joaquín García Morato y Castaño was in London on vacation. He returned across France, to Burgos in a light civil aircraft on 1 August. He immediately joined the Nationalist air force and was transferred to Tablada 24 hours later. Given a Ni-H.52 fighter, Morato flew to Córdoba on 3 August with orders to defend the city.\n\nAt Córdoba he replaced teniente Timoteo Valiente, who had joined the forces at Córdoba only the day before.\n\nUntil 7 August, Morato operated on his own in Córdoba and then, for the following two days, he joined with capitán Gancedo who was in command of the Nieuports at Seville.\n\nOn 14 August, Morato he returned the Nieuport to teniente Valiente and joined the Heinkel He 51 squadron which was being formed in Seville. Valiente was able to make little use of this machine, for on August 15th he was involved in an accident which prevented him from flying in fighter aircraft again.\n\nA small fighter squadron was formed in Burgos and for a brief period it was under the command of capitán Chamorro, although he soon went on to pilot Dragon Rapides and an Airspeed Envoy, in which he was killed whilst escorting General Mola. Pilots who flew with this squadron included Julio Salvador, Miguel Guerrero García, Martín Campos and Ramón Alvarez Senra, tenientes Miguel García Pardo and Ramiro Pasual, and occasionally capitán Ángel Salas.\n\nIn the middle of August, Ángel Salas collected the only Fokker XII to arrive in Vitoria, and ferried this to the Dragon-Fokker Group in Burgos.\n\nHe then flew to Saragossa with a Nieuport 52.\n\nDuring the succeeding days Salas operated at Teruel and Ramón Alvarez Senra at Huesca.\n\nOn 27 August, Captain Ángel Salas took off from Aragon in a Nieuport aircraft, eventually arriving at Olmedo. He had written to Joaquín García Morato, from Saragossa hospital, asking if he could occupy the vacant place in the He 51 squadron. Morato had replied to the effect that the situation, so far as the He 51s were concerned, was not very hopeful, but that he had heard some Fiat fighters were due to arrive in Seville, and suggested that it might be better for him to try to get one of these machines allocated to him.\n\nIn fact, Salas went to Cáceres, where for some days he acted as a machine-gunner in Ricardo Guerrero's squadron of Ju 52/3ms, and from there he went to Seville in company with Julio Salvador.\n\nAviación del Tercio\n\nAt dawn on 14 August 1936, the Italian freighter Nereide entered the port of Melilla, on the Mediterranean coast of Spanish Morocco. This important town had been occupied four weeks earlier by Nationalist forces led by general Franco himself. The vessels cargo consisted of 12 CR.32s, which had been embarked in the Italian port of La Spezia a week earlier.\n\nAs well as spare parts for the Fiat fighters, the ship had also transported 18 volunteers from the Regia Aeronautica to North Africa, their passports bearing false details. Amongst them were the first 12 Italian fighter pilots to arrive on Spanish territory. They were led by Capitano Vincenzo Dequal (Paride Limonesi) of the 1o Stormo CT and his flight leaders were Tenente Vittor Ugo Ceccherelli (Vaccarese), also of the 1o Stormo CT, Tenente Ernesto Monico (Preti) of the 4o Stormo CT and Sottotenente Giuseppe Cenni (Vittorio Stella) of the 1o Stormo CT. The remaining enlisted pilots were Sergente Maggiore Giuseppe Avvico (Nannini) the 4o Stormo CT, Sergente Maggiore Bruno Castellani (Ribaudi) of the 6o Stormo CT, Sergente Maggiore Sirio Salvadori (Salvo) of the 4o Stormo CT, Sergente Angelo Boetti (Ilacqua) of the 1o Stormo CT, Sergente Adamo Giuglietti (Guglielmotti) of the 1o Stormo CT, Sergente Giovanni Battista Magistrini (Marietti) of the 1o Stormo CT, Sergente Vincenzo Patriarca (Boccolari) of the 4o Stormo CT and Sergente Guido Presel (Sammartano) of the 6o Stormo CT. The groundcrew consisted of just three aircraft riggers and three mechanics.\n\nAfter being welcomed by Spanish officers and the local Italian Consul, the pilots and groundcrew were immediately enrolled into the Tercio Extranjero with their equivalent ranks.\n\nThe CR.32s were assembled at Nador (Melilla) over the course of several days and eventually transferred by air to Tablada (Seville), in southern Spain.\n\nThe 12 CR.32s were integrated into the Aviación del Tercio and these, the first fighter unit of this force became the Primera Escuadrilla de Caza de la Aviación del Tercio (1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio) and was commanded by Capitano Dequal.\n\nThe new squadron's initial operations consisted of patrols and single sortie missions as dictated by the particular operational requirements and limited efficiency of its aircraft. The CR.32 pilots struggled at first to have an impact on their Republican counterparts because only two of the dozen Fiat fighters in-theatre boasted compasses following a supply oversight in Italy! Unfamiliarity with Spanish terrain and inadequately detailed maps further compounded the units navigational problems when in the air, and the end result was pilot disorientation culminating in emergency landings and damaged aircraft.\n\nInitially, the CR.32s were assigned defensive duties, patrolling overhead Nationalist forces in Andalusia and protecting them from aerial attack, as well as escorting S.81 bombers. The Italian biplanes also provided air cover for the infantry columns of the African Army that had been transported to Spain in the Ju 52/3ms. These troops were particularly vulnerable to attack from the numerically superior Republican air force in the early weeks of the war as they advanced north, occupying western Extremadura. The African Armys next target was the Spanish capital, Madrid, which it intended to occupy so as to claim international recognition in favour of a new Nationalist administration.\n\nBy the end of August, after the first 12 CR.32s, and their pilots, had reached Melilla, three more had been sent to Majorca and nine were offloaded in the port of Vigo de Galicia, on Spains Atlantic coast, from the Spanish ship Ebro. The latter had been renamed Aniene in Italy so that it could run contraband under a flag of convenience.\n\nThe nine CR.32s delivered to Vigo de Galicia were unloaded on the night of 27 August, although the presence of a British naval vessel in the port at the same time meant that this operation could not be completed in secrecy. Nine pilots under the command of Tenente Dante Olivero (from 6o Stormo) were also on board Aniene, and each of them had a false identity. Amongst the aviators were Sottotenente Adriano Mantelli (Arrighi) and Sergenti Brunetto di Montegnacco (Antonio Romualdi), GianLino Baschirotto (Edoardo Giri) and Raffaele Chianese, while five groundcrew provided technical support. The men and their machines then travelled by train southwards along the Vigo-Orense-Salamanca-Caceres-Seville route, which was controlled by Nationalist forces that had recently occupied the eastern Extremadura to unite the occupied zones of southern and north-western Spain. The reassembly of the nine aeroplanes, which were destined for the Segunda Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio (2a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio), commenced after the three-day journey had ended in Tablada on 30 August.\n\nThe three CR.32s sent to Majorca were unloaded from the Italian steamer Emilio Morandi at Palma de Mallorca during the night of 27-28 August. The ship docked at 20:30 and during the night, the personnel and aircraft were transferred to Son San Juan airfield. Two of the pilots to the aircraft were Capitano Giuseppe DAgostinis and Sergente Guido Carestiato.\n\nDuring the latter half of August 1936, Nationalist troops continued with their advance through Extremadura and New Castile in the direction of Madrid. Accompanying them was a flight of CR.32s from 1a Escuadrilla under the command of Tenente Ernesto Monico, these aircraft being sent to Cáceres for the defence of the local airfield and general Francos General Headquarters, which had recently been established in the city.\n\nSonderstab W\n\nSS Usaramo with the first contingent of German volunteers arrived at the roadstead off Cádiz on 6 August before docking the next day. They were sent by train to Seville. Hannes Trautloft recalled:\n\nThe next morning we found ourselves at Seville airfield [Tablada], a frequent target for Red airmen. On 9 August we started the job of rebuilding our six He 51s - a real piece of teamwork involving pilots and ground personnel. The Spanish personnel were quite surprised to witness us work with such energy, but we really were getting quite impatient and wanted to get our machines into the air as soon as possible.\n\nConditions at Tablada were rudimentary. Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel recorded of this initial period:\n\nOur single-seaters had to be put together rapidly, as we wanted to strike out as soon as possible to the Front. Breaking open crates, raising aircraft fuselages, attaching wings, fixing bracing struts - that was our first occupation. In doing so, we established friendships with the Spanish pilots [Joaquín García] Morato, [Julio] Salvador, [Luis] Rambaud and others, and with the Spanish mechanics. Many beads of sweat flowed.\n\nOn 10 August, the first He 51 was fully assembled and ready for operations.\n\nThe German pilots at Tablada were able to put on a display patrol to both test the re-assembled Heinkels and to impress their Spanish comrades with the performance of their aircraft. In accordance with their instructions they were not authorised to enter combat, and so the first few days were spent training five rebel Spaniards selected from the first group of 18 fighter pilots to join the Nationalist side; capitán Luis Rambaud and Joaquín García Morato and teniente Miguel García Pardo, Ramiro Pascual and Julio Salvador.\n\nEventually, the German pilots requested that they be allowed to engage in combat operations, and this permission was granted by general Alfredo Kindelán y Duany, the commander of what was now viewed as the Nationalist air forces. Of this time Herwig Knüppel recorded:\n\nAfter some seven days of strenuous work, with our toothbrushes and shaving gear stashed in the stowage compartment of our He 51s, we flew via Salamanca and the Sierra de Gredos to our small combat airfield of Escalona del Prado, near Segovia.\n\nThere, on the northern perimeter of the Guadarrama hills, we were located together with an Escuadrilla de reconocimiento, with whom we soon established a warm friendship. The aircraft stood in the open, replacement parts, ammunition and fuel and oil laying protected from the sun under tarpaulins at the edge of the forest. We ourselves likewise lay to some extent protected from the full glare of the sun and slept when we were not flying, or else had language tuition with the Spanish crews.\n\nWolf-Heinrich von Houwald also recorded his observations of early conditions in Spain:\n\nWe arrived at Salamanca, the second stopping place on our way to Escalona - a small town close to the Madrid Front. Salamanca was the first combat airfield I saw. We took a big chance in actually finding it because everything, including the aircraft, was very well camouflaged. We refuelled and took off for Escalona, an airfield that we heard was incredibly small and hard to find. It lay so close to the front that it was quite probable that we would engage the enemy. Nevertheless, we found it after half-an-hour and landed. The airfield was so poor that we were worried whether our Spanish comrades would be able to fly our aircraft from there.\n\nNext day I had a most annoying experience. Full of enthusiasm and idealism, five Spaniards proudly climbed into our aircraft. They did not want foreigners to fight for them while they had to stay on the ground with nothing to do. But as they returned, my aircraft crashed on landing. Fortunately, the other Heinkels managed to land safely. From now on, without an aircraft, I had to stay on the ground while the others each shot down two or three enemy in short order. I had nothing better to do than to wait for new aircraft to come from home. I kept thinking that they would arrive too late because the Rojos would be forced to surrender in front of Francos massive offensive.\n\nThe small cadre of Spanish pilots working with the Germans had formed themselves loosely into what they called the Escuadrilla Rambaud. After the losses suffered on 23 August, the Escuadrilla was disbanded in the end of the month.\n\nOf the time at Escalona del Prado, Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel wrote:\n\nA fighter pilot must always be ready for action. We flew other pilots back in a Ju 52 in rotation in order to fetch aviation fuel for our next flights over the front. Our mechanics worked untiringly to maintain the engines and machine guns. We  as the Kette Eberhardt  flew four to five times daily to the front, with a view of the buildings of Madrid lying in the distance in the haze of the sun. Eberhardt, Trautloft and I proudly called ourselves the Jäger from Guadarrama.\n\nOperations\n\n1 August 1936\n\nGrenada-based, teniente Miguel Guerrero García (Ni-H.52) claimed a Breguet XIX.\n\nNationalist pilot Manuel del Camino Parladé was killed during a test flight at Tablada, Sevilla, in a Ni-H.52.\n\n2 August 1936\n\nTeniente Ramón Puparelli Francia flew a reconnaissance mission over the San Rafael-Ávila, Navacerrada and Alto del León roads in a Breguet XIX, dropping bombs on the pine forests.\n\n3 August 1936\n\nOver Córdoba, at the controls of a Nieuport Ni.52, capitán Joaquín García Morato threw a Republican formation of Breguet XIXs escorted by a solitary Ni-H.52 into total confusion and forced it to withdraw.\n\nThe Escuadrilla Mixta, based at Sariñena performed its first sortie when Ni-H.52s escorted Breguet XIXs sent to attack targets in the La Zaida area of the Aragon front.\n\nTeniente Ramón Puparelli Francia bombed an Nationalist battery at Alto del León.\n\n4 August 1936\n\nSargento Jesús García Herguido from the Escuadrilla Mixta at Sariñena used his Ni-H.52 to shoot down a Nationalist Breguet XIX flown by capitán Eduardo Prado Castro, CO of an escuadrilla of Grupo No 23 detached to Saragossa. The aircraft made a forced-landing and both crewmen escaped unhurt. The resulting communique issued by the Consejero de Defensa de la Generalitat reported:\n\nLate this evening four Fascist aircraft from Andalusia tried to attack the advanced forces at La Zaida by taking advantage of todays stormy weather, which reduced visibility. A fighter aircraft of the Republic forces, flown by oficial señor Herguido, who was returning to base, engaged the four rebel aircraft and brought one down in flames. Aviator Herguido chased the other three beyond Saragossa, where he lost them. Returning to base, and over Saragossa, he noticed strong concentrations of rebel forces on the Paseo de la Independencia, which he strafed. Our airman returned safely to base.\n\n6 August 1936\n\nCabo Rafael Peña Dugo of the Grupo de Caza No 11 (Ni-H.52) attacked friendly Ni-H.52s that had taken off from Barajas. Sargento Andrés García La Calle suffered a buttock wound, but escuadrilla CO, capitán José Méndez Iriarte, crashed in enemy-held territory and was killed.\n\n7 August 1936\n\nSargento Arístides García López flew a Breguet XIX that still bore Republican tricolour markings on the Granada front and he was shot down in error by a Ni-H.52.\n\nFortunately, García López and his observer/rear gunner escaped unhurt.\n\n8 August 1936\n\nRepublican fighter pilots Antonio Andrés Pascual and Avertano González Fernández-Muñiz were shot down and killed in combat in the Madrid area.\n\n9 August 1936\n\nTeniente Miguel García Pardo claimed his first victory against a Breguet XIX over Sierra de Guadarrama\n\n12 August 1936\n\nCapitán Joaquín García Morato claimed his first victory when he shot down a Vickers Vildebeest bomber which was opposing General Varela's advance on Antequera.\n\nIt seems that it was part of a formation of three Vildebeests escorted by Ni-H.52s, which didnt suffer any losses.\n\n13 August 1936\n\nSargento Fernando Romero Tejero of the fighter patrulla of Escuadrilla Y-2 took off from Guadix with a Ni-H.52 and shot down two Nationalist Breguet XIXs. The first crashed at Venta Navas and the second at Pinos Puente.\n\nUpon returning home, Romero Tejero was congratulated by both the local committee and the CO of Los Alcázares airfield, comandante Ortiz, who was making a tour of inspection at the time.\n\n14 August 1936\n\nRepublican fighter pilot José Cabré Planas was shot down and in killed in combat in the Aragón area.\n\n17 August 1936\n\nJulio Salvador Díaz-Benjumea claimed his first victory when he claimed a Potez 54 over Santa Cruz de Mudela.\n\n18 August 1936\n\nJoaquín García Morato claimed a Potez 540 and a Nieuport flying in a Heinkel He 51B.\n\nJulio Salvador Díaz-Benjumea claimed one Ni-H.52 and two Breguet XIXs over Merida flying in a Heinkel He 51.\n\n21 August 1936\n\nThe first aerial encounter between CR.32s and Republican aircraft came during the day over the city of Córdoba, in southern Spain, which had fallen into Nationalist hands the previous month. The rebel troops had subsequently come under repeated attack from the air by Republican aircraft, so a flight of three Fiat fighters was sent on detachment from Seville with orders to defend the city. The CR.32s were led by Tenente Vittor Ugo Ceccherelli and included Sergente Boetti and Sergente Salvadori.\n\nIn the evening, during the fifth scramble of the day, Tenente Ceccherelli single-handedly engaged two Republican Ni-H.52s. The Italian pilot duly succeeded in shooting down one of the fighters, expending 172 7.7 mm rounds.\n\nThe Ni-H.52 was flown by capitán Antonio Martin-Luna Lesundi, the commander of 2. Escuadrilla Lafayette. The airplane crashed near Talavera in the vicinity of Seville.\n\nTwo CR.32s were damaged during landing at the provisional aerodrome at Córdoba. The airfield was very dusty, the dust risen by landing airplanes blinded the pilots. Tenente Ceccherelli collided with a Breguet XIX. The other damaged airplane was the CR.32 of Sergente Boetti. However, all three airplanes needed repairs because the guns had jammed in Sergente Salvadoris fighter. This one flew back to Seville, the remaining two were transported by road.\n\n23 August 1936\n\nThe Escuadrilla Rambaud first action took place during the day, when three He 51s escorted Spanish-flown Ju 52/3ms sent to attack Getafe airfield on the southern outskirts of Madrid. It had been intended that the Spanish pilots fly some of the newly-arrived Fiat CR.32s that were due in Spain at any moment from Italy, but these had been delayed. In view of the depth of penetration of enemy airspace, it was decided that the Heinkels should be used instead. Furthermore, at this early stage of the conflict it was considered to be too risky to send German airmen flying over the Spanish capital.\n\nUnder a strong midday sun, and despite dense anti-aircraft fire over the capital, the mission was a success. Upon returning home, capitán Luis Rambauds He 51B, which had received a hit in the undercarriage, and teniente Ramiro Pascuals He 51B were damaged on landing on the short runway at Escalona, 40 km south-west of Madrid.\n\nThe Spanish pilots had some problems with the He 51 when bringing the aircraft in to land since the fighter had a tendency to bounce and veer once on the ground. One of the damaged He 51Bs on this date suffered a broken propeller for which there was no replacement. Later, the resourceful German mechanics repaired the propeller using what was on hand at Tablada, and the aircraft was ready for operations once again.\n\nWith a sense of increasing frustration, the German contingent demanded of general Alfredo Kindelán y that they, and they only, should be allowed to fly the Heinkels. Thus the Escuadrilla Rambaud was disbanded in the end of the month.\n\nÁngel Salas over the Teruel front Salas attacked and destroyed a light aircraft.\n\nThis was his first victory during the war. The following day he was admitted to hospital suffering from exhaustion, after completing 50 operational sorties totalling 116 flying hours (a figure which was bettered only by Ureña with 180 hours, 24 combat sorties and 101 transport missions), which had been amassed within four weeks.\n\nTwo SM.81s bombed the army and militia at Navarmoral de la Mata. The raid contributed to the seizure of the town by the Nationalists commanded by mayor Tell.\n\n25 August 1936\n\nOn the afternoon, the German fighters made their operational debut in support of the drive on Madrid. A patrol comprising Oberleutnant Kraft Eberhardt (now in nominal command of the German fighter force) , Oberleutnant Hannes Trautloft and Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel took off. The Spanish heat made conditions somewhat unusual for aerial combat, and as Trautloft recorded I sat in my aircraft in shorts and a T-shirt - my tennis clothes! Knüppel recalled:\n\nIt was once again a sunny day with a clear blue sky. Catalonia lay beneath us, with its superb Guadarrama forested hills, on whose heights battles were being fought on the Puerto de Somosierra, Navicicerada and on the pass road from León. In the northwest, beyond the hills, lay Segovia, and in the southwest, the mighty rectangle of the Escorial, with its imposing walls, domes and towers, while in the south, in the haze of the summer day, Madrid. We were flying on our way to the west. Suddenly, Oberleutnant Eberhardt gave the signal for attack.\n\nEberhardt had spotted three Republican Breguet XIXs about two kilometres away over the outskirts of Madrid, flying towards, and about 500 metres below, the Heinkels. With his hands shaking from excitement, Trautloft switched on his gunsight, entered into a dive from the sun, closed to within 30 metres and opened fire with his MG 17s:\n\nAs I approach I see the gunner aiming his gun at me and then the muzzle lights up as he opens fire. It all looks rather harmless. With my first burst, the gunner disappears - his machine gun points vertically towards the sky. The Red now pushes over into a steep dive. My second burst is brief, but on target, because all of a sudden the Breguet rears up, rolls over, roars towards the earth in a steep, uncontrolled dive and smashes into the ground north of the village of Comenar.\n\nTrautloft had claimed what is believed to be the first aerial victory by German forces in Spain. Knüppel was forced to break off his attack when his guns jammed but Eberhardt claimed the second Breguet. When the Heinkels landed back at Escalona del Prado, Eberhardt and Trautloft each lodged a claim for a Breguet shot down, and celebrated the occasion wildly with their mechanics.\n\nThe Italian SM.81s conducted a raid in the region of Navarmoral de la Mata in support of Nationalist troops moving towards Oropesa.\n\n26 August 1936\n\nDuring a mission to Madrid, Oberleutnant Kraft Eberhardt and Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel claimed a Breguet XIX each. Knüppel recalled:\n\nNow, full power and attack! I head for one of the enemy Aufklärer, a Breguet 19. I have him in my cross-wires and open fire. He dives away beneath me. I make yet another attack  l his engine stops and his observer stops firing. He crashes close behind the enemy line. In my great joy over this aerial victory, I perform a loop. But already an enemy fighter, a French parasol monoplane, is sitting on my tail. Just as I was about to turn onto him, he shot upwards. I was unfortunately unable to catch him, as his aircraft climbed better and was faster.\n\nThree SM.81s attacked Toledo, their target was the local ammunition factory.\n\n27 August 1936\n\nTenente Vittor Ugo Ceccherelli and Sergente Giovanni Battista Magistrini had been sent to the southern city of Granada to defend it from attack. Scrambling on his own, Sergente Magistrini shot down a Ni-H.52 that had been escorting Breguet XIX bombers heading for the city.\n\nThis was the second CR.32 victory in Spain.\n\nThe Republican pilot seems to have been teniente Antonio de Haro López, who reportedly was killed in combat in the Guadix area.\n\nOberleutnant Herwig Knüppel accounted for a Ni-H.52, possibly from the Republican Grupo No 11 at Getafe.\n\nItalian SM.81s attacked Malaga.\n\n28 August 1936\n\nAt noon, the first Fiat, marked Black 1, which had arrived at Palma de Mallorca the previous evening was ready to fly, and Capitano Giuseppe DAgostinis took off for a test flight.\n\nAt 12:30, Sergente Guido Carestiato took off in the same aircraft and headed to Cala Morlanda, where six Republican SIAI S.62s were riding at anchor. Carestiato fired on all of them and destroyed two; \"S-5\" of Enrique Pereira and \"S-30\" of Antonio Orejuela. As he was returning home, he saw another S.62 flying over the bay and he intercepted and shot it down. Carestiato landed at Son San Juan after just ten minutes with his aircraft slightly damaged by ground fire.\n\nAfter an hour, the Black 1 took off again with DAgostinis in command. DAgostinis attacked the seaplanes, which in the meanwhile had been pulled ashore, then, as he was returning home, spotted two more S.62s while taking off from Puerto Cristo Bay. He attacked one, which was forced to ditch. Capitano José Maria Freire and Capitano Fernando Beneito flew this aircraft and Freire was killed. The aircraft was claimed as destroyed but in fact, it was only damaged, and was later recovered by the Republican merchant ship Mar Negro. The second S.62 managed to escape since DAgostinis had run out of ammunition.\n\nThe following days, the three CR.32s were strafing troops, trucks and boats, avoiding ground fire flying at 2000 m, then, after spotting the targets, going away, and returning to strafe at low level with sun behind them.\n\nAlthough DAgostinis was the CO, his personal aircraft wasnt no. 1 (this was used by Guido Carestiato) but no. 4 (perhaps in honor to the 4o Stormo). On the starboard side, this aircraft had a personal insignia; a shield with an armored reddish cat (after his nom de guerre and his reddish hair) wearing a sword, in a cartouche appeared the motto: OCIO CHE SGRAFA! (Venetian dialect  Look out, hell scratch you!).\n\nItalian SM.81s attacked Malaga.\n\n29 August 1936\n\nOberleutnant Kraft Eberhardt claimed an unconfirmed Potez 540 over the Sierra Guadarrama.\n\nIt seems that Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel and Oberleutnant Hannes Trautloft were involved in (inconclusive) combat with Potez 540s over the Sierra Guadarrama during the day and they reported that during their first pass, they had their windscreens smeared with oil from the shot-up Potez, forcing them to break off their attacks. They were also set upon by a Dewoitine D.372 fighter.\n\n30 August 1936\n\nSergente Guido Presel of the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio took off from Tablada as the lone escort for a Ju 52/3m that was heading for Nationalist northern Spain. As the pair neared Badajoz, on Spains border with Portugal, Republican Fury 4-2 flown by alférez Félix Urtubi Ercilla from Grupo de Caza No 11 (on detachment to the Don Benito airfield) suddenly attacked the Junkers tri-motor. Presel immediately engaged the British fighter, whose pilot broke off his pursuit of the Ju 52/3m and concentrated on the Italian aircraft instead. What followed was a closely fought engagement between two evenly matched biplane fighters flown by determined and well-trained pilots.\n\nConcentrating on each other, both men neglected to keep an eye on their fuel, or their location. The engine in Urtubi Ercillas aircraft fell silent first, and he was forced to land near Alburquerque, which was controlled by the Nationalists. Disguising himself as a peasant holding the halter of a donkey, he then had to walk for a week to reach Republican territory, keeping away from main roads and populated areas as much as he could. His intact Fury was recovered by Nationalist forces and pressed into service.\n\nPresel, meanwhile, had lost sight of the Ju 52/3m during the fight, and lacking a compass in his CR.32, he found himself alone over unfamiliar territory. With the engine of his aircraft running on vapours, Presel had little choice but to make an emergency landing on Portuguese soil, damaging the undercarriage of the CR.32 in the process. Fortunately for him, the Portuguese government supported the Nationalist cause, so the aircraft was quickly recovered and Presel returned to Tablada.\n\nTenente Ernesto Monico and Sergente Maggiore Bruno Castellani of the 1a Squadriglia were bounced by a flight of three D.372 fighters flown by French pilots from the Republican Escuadra España between Talavera de la Reína and Oropesa whilst returning from a reconnaissance flight over the enemy airfields at Getafe and Cuatro Vientos. Tenente Monicos CR.32 quickly caught fire and the pilot took to his parachute and his aircraft crashed near Las Herencias. Sergente Maggiore Castellani force-landed near Villanueva de la Serena and returned to friendly territory on foot. Monico was not so fortunate, being taken prisoner by militants retreating towards Talavera. Declaring his proper nationality shortly after his capture, he requested to see the Italian ambassador in Madrid. This was refused, however, and Monico was executed shortly thereafter. According to Republican sources he was subsequently shot dead while trying to escape. Monico was the first Italian pilot to lose his life in action during the Spanish Civil War and he was posthumously awarded Italy's highest military decoration, the Medaglia doro al valor militare. When his fate became known some days later, on 4 September, the inscription MONICO ! PRESENTE (Monico is Present) was applied to all the CR.32s flown by both Tercio fighter units.\n\nThe three He 51Bs flown by Oberleutnants Kraft Eberhardt, Herwig Knüppel and Hannes Trautloft chased three Potez 540 deep over enemy territory, Trautloft angrily expended almost all of his ammunition from just 50 metres away and behind. In response, the bomber simply went into a steep glide, again spraying oil all over the Germans windscreen and severely limiting his ability to see anything. Eberhardt and Knüppel were similarly frustrated. Lessons were being learned, for as Trautloft noted:\n\nFrom this range we can't possibly have missed. We suspect that the pilots seat in the Potez bomber is armoured. Therefore in future we shall have to attack from the front.\n\nI attempt an attack from the front in an effort to knock out the pilot. But he has, meanwhile, got a good lead and my machine just is not fast enough. In addition we are almost out of ammunition, so there is nothing else for it but to break off our attack.\n\nThere was perhaps cold comfort for the Germans since the bombers did, in fact, come down, and all three pilots were credited with the destruction of a Potez.\n\nOn a later mission the same day Oberleutnant Hannes Trautloft (again flying in his tennis gear) was bounced by an enemy fighter (probably a Dewoitine D.371) whose machine gun fire raked the right wing of his Heinkel (2-4), sending it into a spiral dive. With his controls shot away, Trautloft decided to parachute, and opened his parachute at about 8000 ft. The attacking Republican fighter attempted to return for a second pass and open fire at the vulnerable German airman, but Kraft Eberhardt and Herwig Knüppel chased him away. Trautloft recalled:\n\nIn spite of these encouraging results against the Potez, it was clear that our aircraft were not superior enough for us to feel completely safe from the enemy. In fact, on 30 August, I was, for my part, shot down and had to bail out. I was lucky that I was not wounded and that I landed behind Nationalist lines. However, Francos troops were, of course, not only surprised to see a tennis player landing in their positions by parachute, they were also very suspicious of me. I did not speak Spanish very well and I suppose they thought that I could have been a foreign volunteer for the Red Army. I proved to them that this was not the case by showing them my passport. In it was written Este aparate y su piloti Don. Hannes Trautloft, estan al servicio del Ejercito Nacional del Norte. After having carefully read these lines, the Spanish officer shook my hand and I was treated in a very friendly fashion.'\n\nIt is possible that Trautloft had been attacked and shot down by teniente Ramón Puparelli Francia of the Grupo de Caza No 11, who claimed a He 51 during the day and this is the only known Republican claim this day.\n\nWhile flying Hawker Spanish Fury 4-1 from Talavera de la Reina, sargento Andrés García La Calle of Escuadrilla Mixta claimed a Ju 52/3m.\n\nItalian SM.81s attacked Malaga.\n\n31 August 1936\n\nSargento Andrés García La Calle (Hawker Spanish Fury 4-1) lead a fighter patrulla of two Ni-H.52 from capitán Juan Quintana y Ladrón de Guevaras Escuadrilla Mixta, based at Talavera de la Reina. The two Ni-H.52s were flown by cabos Roberto Alonso Santamaría and wingman Rafael Peña Dugo.\n\nOver Talavera de la Reina, southwest of Madrid, La Calle shot down a CR.32 while Alonso Santamaría and Peña Dugo shot down a second CR.32.\n\nBoth Roberto Alonso Santamaría and Rafael Peña Dugo were promoted to alférez after this success.\n\nDuring the night of 31 August/1 September three S.81s were alternately bombing Malaga for five hours. The targets were the ships anchored in the harbour. The destroyer Churruca was damaged.\n\nSeptember 1936\n\nGround Operations\n\n4 September 1936\n\nNationalist forces occupied Talavera and its local airfield some 60 miles to the south-west of Madrid just as a new Republican Government was being formed in the capital city. Socialist Francisco Largo Caballero duly became prime minister, heading a cabinet that included communist ministers for the very first time.\n\n5 September 1936\n\nThe Basque city of Irún was taken by the Nationalists.\n\nThe Spanish Republican Army re-embarkation from Majorca began and the Republicans held the beaches until September 12, when the last ship steamed off in retreat, leaving the island in Nationalist hands.\n\n13 September 1936\n\nThe Basques surrender San Sebastián to the Nationalists.\n\n29 September 1936\n\nThe Fascist junta in Burgos declared Franco Generalísimo.\n\nFuerza Aérea de la República Española - Republican Air Force\n\nAndrés García La Calle record in the Talavera battles was outstanding, and he was promoted to alférez on 3 September 1936.\n\nIn September, Juan Comas Borrás was sent to the Escuela de Pilotos at San Javier for a refreshment course.\n\nOn 6 September, six French Loire 46 C1s were flown across the Spanish border from Toulouse-Montaudran to Barcelona. Some of their French pilots duly joined the Escuadra España.\n\nThe first 33 Soviet bomber pilots, who arrived on 10 September 1936, flew combat missions in Potez 540s with mixed crews. They were ironically nicknamed Protezy (prosthesis)!\n\nManuel Aguirre López was transferred with his Ni-H.52 3-74 to Andújar and the 1a Escuadrilla of the re-established Grupo No 21. This was a mixed unit, equipped with Breguet XIX bombers and Nieuport fighters.\n\nMiguel Zambudio Martínez joined the Republican air force in September 1936. He enrolled in the pilots course at the Escuela de Vuelo y Combate at Alcalá de Henares, from where he moved to Santiago de la Ribera for elementary and fighter pilot training. By this time Zambudio had already flown the DH 60 Moth Major, Hispano-Suiza E-34, Breguet XIX, Miles Hawk, Caudron C.600 Aiglon, Fleet 10, Morane-Saulnier MS.230, GL.32, Koolhoven FK.51, Avro 626 and Ni-H.52.\n\nReturning to Getafe in late September, Chindasvinto González García served as a flight engineer for the DH 89 Dragon Rapide flown by teniente Miguel Kiriguine - a White Russian whose name has also been rendered in Spanish records as Kriguine, Kryguine and Kringuin. González flew with Kiriguine on liaison missions between Los Alcázares and Alcalá de Henares.\n\nFrancisco Viñals Guarro volunteered for flying training.\n\nAlthough born in Germany, Walter Katz held Spanish nationality. As a volunteer with a private pilots license, he was readily accepted as a military pilot in September 1936 and posted to the 1a Escuadrilla of the Grupo No 21, equipped with Breguet XIXs. The unit was deployed to Andújar to fly reconnaissance and bombing missions over the Cordoba front. Sorties were also flown over the Nuestra Señora de la Cabeza sanctuary, in Jaén, where the provinces rebel Guardia Civil forces were besieged under the command of capitán Santiago Cortés.\n\nKnown Soviet aviators arriving in Spain in September 1936\n\nArrival Name Nom de guerre Rank Role Born Comment Departure 1936-09-??

Kopets, Ivan Jose I-15 pilot 1937-06-17\n\nFuerza Aérea Nacionales (Arma de Aviación) - Nationalist Air Force\n\nOn 2 September, when Huesca was about to fall into Republican hands, the Nationalists hastily transferred two Ju 52/3m escuadrillas of the Escuadra B and comandante Juan Antonio Ansaldos Grupo Dragon to the Aragon front, where they flew several sorties against advancing Republican troops.\n\nAviación del Tercio\n\nAs a result of the events of 31 August and Republican air superiority the Aviación del Tercio was reorganized into two Escuadrillas; the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio (CO Capitano Vincenzo Dequal, who also was overall commander of the fighters) and the 2a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio (CO Tenente Dante Olivero).\n\nFrom mid-September the 1a Escuadrilla had the nickname La Cucaracha - The Cockroach, probably after the song of the same title.\n\nTenente Colonnello Ruggero Bonomi, who was the commander of the entire Italian group, ordered flying in formations of no fewer than six airplanes, usually amounting to 8-12 fighters. Initially he recommended patrolling over the front in small groups. During the escort flights three CR.32s were to fly with the bombers and the remaining were to patrol above in vertical distances of 1,000 m between each other. The Republicans flew by ones or in pairs so the new Italian tactics quickly brought excellent results. Between 18 August and 4 November 1936 the Italian pilots claimed 75 enemy aircraft shot down (during September, CR.32 pilots were credited with the destruction of 35 enemy aircraft and three probables).\n\nOn 6 September, capitán Joaquín García Morato became flight leader of the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio and also flew the CR.32 for the first time following brief instructions on the ground from Sottotenente Adriano Mantelli.\n\nCapitán Morato was the first Spanish pilot to try the Fiat CR.32.\n\nThree new CR.32s were delivered to Palma de Majorca on 7 September, thus doubling the number of Fiat fighters on the island. They formed the Squadriglia Mussolini, led by Capitano Giuseppe DAgostinis. Later they became part of the 130a Squadriglia of the Aviazione delle Baleari. The aircraft were then used to defend the Nationalist-controlled island from Republican air attacks.\n\nOn the morning of 9 September capitán Joaquín García Morato led Italian pilots Sergente Raffaele Chianese and Sergente Achille Buffali from Tablada to the airfield at Cáceres, in Extremadura, from where they could support the Nationalist advance towards Madrid.\n\nIt is possible that capitán Morato already at this time was serving as a flight leader in the 2a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio since it is known that he served in this role during September-December 1936.\n\nDuring the second week of September, capitán Ángel Salas and Julio Salvador arrived at Tablada, offering to serve with the Italians in the Aviación del Tercio on recommendation from capitán Joaquín García Morato who was at this time already serving in the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio.\n\nInitially they were unwilling to accept them, but after Salas had given them a demonstration of his flying ability, including some manoeuvres, which even the Italians, had not attempted in the Fiats, they were finally convinced.\n\nBy this time, Capitano Vincenzo Dequal commanded both Escuadrillas of the Aviación del Tercio and capitán Salas was accepted into the 2a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio\n\nOn 20 September, Ángel Salas and Julio Salvador Díaz-Benjumea joined the forces in Cáceres, where they continued to operate with the Fiat squadron.\n\nOn 25 September, the squadron moved from Cáceres to Talavera (Gamonal aerodrome) to be better located to participate in the advance on Toledo.\n\nOn 29 September, 12 CR.32s arrived at Cadiz, accompanied by 11 pilots that were destined to form the 3a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio. The unit was headed by Capitano Carlo Alberto Maccagno (Alfredo Pecori), who was transferred to Spain in early October from the 4o Stormo CT.\n\nSonderstab W\n\nOn 23 September, the German Jagdstaffel was ordered briefly to Ávila in the first of what would become many temporary relocations to support the Nationalist ground offensives. They were then quickly relocated north to the Basque town of Vitoria, on the Bilbao front, where the Republicans continued to hold ground on the coast.\n\nOn 29 September, they were ordered back to Ávila.\n\nAt the end of September, nine Heinkel He 51 fighters arrived. This was a second batch He 51s and the Germans then handed over to the Nationalists the three He 51s from the first batch that were still operationally serviceable. These three aircraft were flown for some days by Joaquín García Morato, Ángel Salas and Julio Salvador, being alternated with Fiats.\n\nThe German Ju 52/3ms transferred 9700 men from North Africa to Spain in September.\n\nBack in Germany, Sonderstab W had arranged for further shipments of war materiel to Spain, including millions of rounds of ammunition, 2000 hand grenades, 86 tons of bombs, signals equipment and field wire and 45 trucks. For air support, a further 36 He 51s had been assigned - 24 for the Nationalist air force and 12 as reinforcements for Oberleutnant Kraft Eberhardts Staffel, as well as three more Ju 52/3m bombers, a twin-engined He 59 float-equipped biplane and single-engined He 60 floatplane for maritime patrol operations, a Heinkel He 50 bomber/reconnaissance aircraft and a pair of Henschel Hs 123s. These latter aircraft, being sent with pilots and specialist maintenance crews, were intended for testing in field conditions. Crucially, also creeping in to the German plans was the decision to send three prototypes of the new Messerschmitt Bf 109, essentially for testing and evaluation.\n\nOperations\n\n1 September 1936\n\nOberleutnant Hannes Trautloft claimed a Ni-H.52 during the day.\n\n2 September 1936\n\nJoaquín García Morato shot down a Nieuport.\n\nAlférez Jesús García Herguido of Grupo de Caza No 13 strafed the enemy airfield at Huesca, landed, saluted the astonished enemy airmen that ran up to his fighter with a tight fist and then took off again! The prank was recorded in a communique from Barcelona, which noted The advance on Huesca goes on. A loyal aeroplane landed on the enemy airfield. It took off again safely.\n\nTeniente Ramón Puparelli Francia of Grupo de Caza No 11 targeted the village of San Rafael, in Segovia, flying in a Breguet XIX.\n\nLater teniente Puparelli accompanying capitán Manuel Cascón, in a D.372 and claimed a He 51 over the Madrid front. This earned Puparelli promotion to capitán, and he was also made CO of all Republican fighter units on the Madrid front.\n\nSargento Manuel Aguirre López of 2a/12 (Ni-H.52) claimed a CR.32 shot down.\n\nAguirre was rewarded for his success with promotion to alférez a little over three weeks later.\n\nWhile flying Hawker Spanish Fury 4-1 from Talavera de la Reina, sargento Andrés García La Calle of Escuadrilla Mixta claimed a Ju 52/3m.\n\n5 September 1936\n\nLeutnant Wolf-Heinrich von Houwald claimed one Ni-H.52 and Breguet XIX during the day while Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel claimed a second Ni-H.52.\n\n6 September 1936\n\nOberleutnants Kraft Eberhardt and Herwig Knüppel claimed a Potez 540 each.\n\n11 September 1936\n\nAt dawn, the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio took off from Cáceres with the orders to intercept Republican aircraft in the Talavera area.\n\nHere three CR.32 led by Capitano Vincenzo Dequal and with Sergente Maggiore Giuseppe Avvico and Sergente Vincenzo Patriarca intercepted Breguet XIXs escorted by some Nieuport Ni-H.52s. Dequal and Avvico each claimed one Breguet while Sergente Patriarca claimed one of the Nieuports. The Ni-H.52 was flown by British pilot Brian Griffin of the Escuadra Internacional, who was killed. Francisco Portillo Ortega flew the Breguet claimed by Dequal and he escaped back to Republican lines but the observer was killed.\n\nIn the morning, capitán Joaquín García Morato and Sergente Raffaele Chianese claimed a Ni-H.52 each. These were flown by French pilots Captain Jean Labitte and Sergeant Abel Guidez, who had enrolled in the Escuadra España from the reserve corps of the Armée de lAir. Both pilots survived to return to their unit.\n\nThis was capitán Moratos fifth victory, and his first with the CR.32.\n\nDuring the day, Sergente Achille Buffali of the 2a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio shot down a Ni-H.52 flown by Spaniard alférez Jesús García Herguido of the Escuadrilla Mixta. Although wounded in the engagement, Herguido managed to return to Republican territory.\n\nIn the afternoon, Sergente Giovanbattista Magistrini of the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio shot down a Ni-H.52 flown by British pilot Claude Warsow of the Escuadra Internacional, who was killed.\n\n12 September 1936\n\nNationalist pilot Francisco Cuesta was killed when he was brought down by small arms fire at La Granja, near Segovia, while flying a Ni-H.52.\n\n13 September 1936\n\nA patrulla of Aeronáutica Naval Vickers Vildebeests arrived at Getafe from Los Alcázares to reinforce the surviving Breguet XIXs of Grupo No 31. Heading for the Talavera de la Reína front, and escorted by two Ni-H.52s flown by teniente Félix Urtubi Ercilla (a former Nationalist pilot) of the Grupo de Caza No 11 and auxiliary naval pilot Carlos Colom Moliner, the Vildebeests were intercepted at dawn by three CR.32s led by capitán Joaquín García Morato and including Sergente GianLino Baschirotto and Sergente Vincenzo Patriarca.\n\nThe bombers managed to escape but Baschirotto quickly shot down one of the Ni-H.52s. The Republican pilot, teniente Félix Urtubi Ercilla, crashed on the Nationalist side and his body was never recovered nor was the wreckage of his aircraft ever found. Urtubi Ercilla was posthumously promoted to capitán.\n\nPatriarca, meanwhile, got involved in combat with a second Ni-H.52 with which he collided. The Republican pilot, Aeronáutica Naval pilot Colom Moliner, was killed and the charred remains of his body were recovered and identified by his squadron mates. Patriarca, however, managed to parachute. As soon as he landed he was captured by Republican troops and was only saved from a summary execution by showing his American passport. He was later trailed and sentenced to death. Because of the uproar occasioned by the capture of an American citizen, the US State Department successfully applied pressure to the Republican government and Patriarca was released and sent back to the U.S. in November 1936.\n\nPatriarcas CR.32 was the only lost in combat during September-October 1936.\n\nLegend soon had it that it was Félix Urtubi Ercilla who collided with the aircraft flown by Patriarca (perhaps due to his illustrious past). Following the release of a brief communique, government war correspondents asked for the name of the airman involved to be released so that all the Spanish people can engrave it on their hearts.\n\nThe following day Republican newspapers named teniente Félix Urtubi Ercilla, and they attempted to give more details of the combat that had ended in his death. El Noroeste contained a reasonably accurate version of events:\n\nFive enemy aircraft - two tri-motors and three fighters - were sighted over the Navalmoral road, but the tri-motors quickly turned tail in the presence of a loyal fighter pilot, who opened intense machine gun fire. He hit one of the tri-motors and then, when the latter vanished, began a hair-raising pursuit in the clouds, trying to hunt down the three enemy fighters. The loyal fighter pilot hit another enemy aeroplane, which also escaped, but he then pounced on a third enemy aeroplane and almost broke it in two. It was a dreadful clash. The enemy pilot parachuted from his aircraft. Our fighter also crashed. Our brave pilot succumbed to his injuries. Teniente Félix Urtubi is the name of our hero.\n\nBut the dead Republican pilot was not Félix Urtubi Ercilla. The remains were those of Aeronáutica Naval pilot Carlos Colom Moliner. This was made clear in the Madrid evening newspaper La Voz on 16 September. Under the heading Urtubi or Colom? the paper reported:\n\nToday, we have been visited by two comrades from the Aeronáutica Naval who asked us to partially correct the information in the Madrid press on teniente Urtubis alleged death. The corpse of the airman recovered from the Toledo field is that of auxiliar naval Carlos Colom. The fact that Urtubi was also flying at the same time over the same spot and on the same mission created all the confusion.\n\nBoth airmen fought courageously, as we reported yesterday. It is thought that Carlos Colom succumbed when he attacked the enemy aeroplane with his aircraft. There is no news of Urtubis whereabouts. We hope that he will be found safe. Whatever happens, Félix Urtubi and Carlos Colom have written a new and heroic page in the feats of loyal aviators.\n\n14 September 1936\n\nThe CR.32 of Tenente Dante Olivera (CO 2a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio) crashed at Tablada airfield and the pilot was killed.\n\n15 September 1936\n\nCapitán Ángel Salas led his first war sortie in a Fiat CR.32. This was to strafe Andújar aerodrome, which had been the base for the first bombing attack on Santuario de la Cabeza. According to the Nationalist communiqué three aircraft were damaged by fire, one was destroyed and eight more holed by machine-gun fire. The Air Force bulletin announced only the destruction of two Breguet XIXs by the Fiats.\n\nGiuseppe Cenni claimed two aircraft destroyed on the ground at Andùjar airfield.\n\nThe German Heinkels flew, for the first time, a mission in direct support of friendly ground forces advancing along the Tajo valley, when they were called upon to conduct a low-level strafing mission against Republican infantry. For this operation the group was relocated south, to Navalmorales, not far from the walled city of Ávila between the Sierra de Gredos and the Sierra de la Paramera. Oberleutnant Herwig Knüppel recalled:\n\nWe flew daily to-and-fro between Cáceres, Navalmorales and Talavera and accompanied the Spanish columns in the Tajo valley as they advanced on Madrid. It was here that Trautloft and Houwald brought down some enemy light bombers. This was greeted in especially lively fashion by the brave Moroccans of the Spanish Foreign Legion. At Navalmoral forward airfield, the Morros supplied us with tea and mutton when, after our first flight to the front in the Talavera region, we made an interim landing there for breakfast.\n\nStarting from here, we also escorted the first Spanish Ju 52 bombers to the Front. In this way, we took part in the capture of Maquedas. This village, and road nodal point, was especially heavily defended by the enemy. The road from Madrid to Maquedas was choked with trucks and cars, taxis and various other types of vehicles, in which enemy troops had been brought up. Some bombs dropped by our Spanish comrades into these columns caused the enemy to panic so that that village was soon captured and enemy troops hastily driven away to the east.\n\nDuring the day there was further air combat in the Tardienta area involving Nieuport fighters from both sides. Escuadrilla Alas Rojas (Grupo de Caza No 13) teniente Adonis Rodríguez González and alféreces Jesús García Herguido and Fernando Roig Villalta took off from Sariñena and headed for the front in their Ni-H.52s. Once on patrol, the aircraft were bounced by three enemy fighters and teniente Rodríguez was wounded. Force-landing near Tardienta, the Republican pilot was helped by militiamen to a field hospital. On the Nationalist side, a three-strong Breguet XIX patrulla that was attacked by Herguido and Roig was forced to land at Tardienta frontline airfield.\n\nBoth the Consejeria de Defensa communiqué in Barcelona and the press coverage of this combat were remarkable. According to the first communiqué, In the Tardienta area our airmen scored a great success by shooting down three enemy aeroplanes. The second communiqué added details:\n\nIn the Huesca area rebel forces have carried out strong attacks, escorted by their aircraft which have been battered. Three of our fighter aircraft have shot down two enemy bombers and one fighter.\n\nA third communiqué admitted that it was the enemy Ni-H.52s - three actually - that had attacked the friendly aircraft:\n\nA republican Aviation patrulla was attacked by six enemy aeroplanes when it was returning from Huesca. Our airmen forced an enemy aircraft down and it was captured by the Tardienta militias. Both the aircraft and the aviator are foreign.\n\nThe Catalan press published additional details:\n\nOur airmen chased a rebel bomber and forced it down at the village of La Zaida. The pilot was taken prisoner and the aircraft was captured intact by our troops, together with all the crew.\n\nAs we have seen, however, the outcome of this clash was quite different from the official version. Teniente Adonis Rodríguez was the captured foreign airman referred to by the communiqué! Coronel Felipe Díaz Sandino, Consejero de Defensa of the Catalan autonomous government, seemed well versed in the techniques of propaganda and disinformation.\n\n16 September 1936\n\nCapitán Joaquín García Morato and Sergente GianLino Baschirotto claimed a shared Potez 540 near Navalcarnero. The damaged Republican bomber crash-landed behind its own lines and only the wounded pilot survived. Morato claimed an additional Potez 540.\n\nSottotenente Franceschi became disorientated whilst fighting Republican aircraft and landed in enemy territory close to Don Benito, in Extremadura. He was killed a short while later in a shoot-out with a militia patrol. Franceschis CR.32 was captured intact, and after being thoroughly evaluated by the Republicans, it was lost in a landing incident at Los Alcazares airport, near Cartagena, in November.\n\nSergente Raffaele Chianese of the 2a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio downed a D.372 near Talavera that was piloted by British pilot Keith Lindsay of the Escuadra Internacional. The injured pilot managed to return to the Republican side.\n\nA short while later during the same sortie Chianese downed a militarised, red-painted. Miles M.2 two-seat single-engined monoplane that was being used as a makeshift reconnaissance aircraft - both crewmembers were killed.\n\nSottotenente Adriano Mantelli of the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio shot down a Breguet XIX near Talavera de la Reína.\n\nWhile flying Hawker Spanish Fury 4-1 from Talavera de la Reina, alférez Andrés García La Calle of Escuadrilla Mixta claimed a CR.32.\n\n17 September 1936\n\nOn a mission to engage enemy bombers attacking a Nationalist column, a lone Republican D.372 fighter, accompanied by a single Hawker Fury, bore in on the German He 51s and forced them to scatter. The Heinkels were only rescued once a second Kette of three aircraft arrived and finally the Republican fighters pulled away. This, together with the failed attacks against the Potez bombers, had been a stark warning to the Germans, who recognised that they could not in any way assume that they had air superiority while flying the He 51.\n\nOberleutnant Herwig Knüppel claimed an unconfirmed Ni-H.52.\n\n18 September 1936\n\nA patrol of Fiat CR.32s led by Vincenzo Dequal took off from Caceres. The fighters were tasked with protection of friendly troops near Casar de Escalona. The CR.32s were flying at 4,000 meters when five enemy fighters were spotted. Their pilots, seeing the Italians headed for clouds for rescue. The CR.32s flew above the clouds and soon gained the opportunity to attack. Sottotenente Adriano Mantelli (1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio) shot down a Dewoitine D.372 of the Escuadra Internacional flown by British pilot Edward Hillman, who escaped back to Republican territory.\n\n20 September 1936\n\nJoaquín García Morato claimed a Hawker Fury over Santa Olalla, but in fact, no Fury was destroyed in combat.\n\nFour CR.32s encountered three bombers escorted by a single fighter. Three fighters rushed for the enemy while Sergente Angelo Boetti, having problems with the engine stayed behind. In the meantime, a new group of Republican fighters arrived and immediately became interested in the lonely Fiat. Despite problems with the airplane Boetti managed to outmanoeuvre the enemies but run out of fuel and made a forced landing near Villanueva de la Vera.\n\n22 September 1936\n\nDuring the morning, three CR.32s led by Capitano Vincenzo Dequal spotted a formation of four Republican Breguet XIXs escorted by three French-built parasol monoplane fighters. After an aerial duel that lasted 15 minutes, Sergente Brunetto di Montegnacco (probably CR.32 NC 183) managed to get on the tail of an enemy fighter, which he identified as a Loire 46 C1, and shot it down near Maqueda. The pilot of the latter machine, 27-year-old British engineer Edward Downes Martin from the Escuadra Internacional, lost his life.\n\n23 September 1936\n\nThe castle of Espejo was bombed by S.81s from the Aviación del Tercio.\n\n25 September 1936\n\nDuring a morning patrol, Capitano Vincenzo Dequals flight of four CR.32s intercepted six enemy fighters that were attacking a pair of Ju 52/3ms. Thanks to the Italian pilots intervention, the opposing fighters were dispersed. Following a short duel, Sergente Brunetto di Montegnacco (probably CR.32 NC 183) shot down a Loire 46 C1 near Villamiel de Toledo, the enemy fighter crashing to the ground with a Frenchman by the name of Maxime Hantz (from Alsace) still strapped into the cockpit. Hantz was 40-year-old veteran of World War 1 (he had served as pilot in lescadrille 521 and lescadrille 523), who had joined the Republican Escuadra España as a mercenary.\n\nDuring that same combat Sergente Guido Presel was credited with the destruction of two Dewoitine D.372 fighters. One of the pilots to be shot down was Frenchman René Issard, who was also a member of the Escuadra España. He suffered injuries as he crash-landed his fighter in friendly territory between Talavera and Madrid.\n\nCapitán Joaquín García Morato claimed a Breguet XIX in the Bargas area.\n\nDuring the day, Sergente GianLino Baschirotto claimed a shared Potez 540 together with capitán Ángel Salas near Barciencie and Villamiel. The Potez crashed vertically into the ground near Rielves, killing the crew of seven.\n\nThe Republican aircraft, a Potez 540 c/n 4219, which was named Aqui le espero (I will wait for you here), was flown by capitán Joaquín Mellado Pasqual (CO of the Grupo Potez) and teniente Moreno (who had been involved in the assassination of Calvo Sotelo). It had taken off from Getafe (Madrid) on an attack mission near Toledo.\n\nThis aircraft had gained some distinction three days before when it bombed the Canarias in Galician waters. It had also been involved in incidents across the whole of Spain from Asturias to Málaga. Mellado had, from the very beginning, been the most active pilot on his side, performing outstanding service at Seville, Madrid and in the Sierra.\n\nPotez 540 c/n 4219 had been flown from Toulouse-Montaudran to Barcelona on 8 August 1936.\n\nPotez 540 (c/n 4219) claimed by Ángel Salas and GianLino Baschirotto on 25 September 1936.\n\nPhoto kindly provided by AEROPORTO di GORIZIA \"il QUARTO STORMO ed i PILOTI\".\n\nSottotenente Giuseppe Cenni claimed some fighters damaged over Maqueda-Torrijos.\n\nThe castle of Espejo was bombed by S.81 from the Aviación del Tercio.\n\n26 September 1936\n\nSottotenente Giuseppe Cenni claimed a Breguet XIX and a Potez 540 as a shared with Sottotenente Adriano Mantelli over Bargas. The Potez 540 was from the Escuadra Internacional and came down in Republican territory with five of its six crew members wounded.\n\nSergente Guido Presel of the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio downed a D.372 during an evening patrol.\n\nThe German pilots accounted for the destruction of three enemy aircraft - a Vickers Vildebeest for Leutnant Wolf-Heinrich von Houwald and a Breguet XIX each for Oberleutnants Ekkehard Hefter and Alfons Klein.\n\nNationalist Ju 52/3m 22-64 from 2-E-22 flown by capitán Eustaquio Ruiz de Alda was shot down over Toledo and surviving crewmen murdered and their bodies mutilated.\n\nSome authors have attributed this victory to French pilot Jean Dary. According to Andrés García La Calle, alférez Rafael Peña Dugo, who had by now distinguished himself as a fine shot, downed the tri-motor. Everything seems to point to the conclusion that Dary, who also claimed two Ju 52/3ms in head-on attacks, was a member of the attacking Republican patrulla, however. The victory should, therefore, have been attributed jointly to the entire D.372 patrulla.\n\nIt also seems that while flying Hawker Spanish Fury 4-1 from Talavera de la Reina, alférez Andrés García La Calle of Escuadrilla Mixta claimed a Ju 52/3m during the day but this is perhaps a share in the above aircraft.\n\n27 September 1936\n\nSergente Raul Galli of the 1a Escuadrilla de Caza del Tercio shot down a Dewoitine D.372 "
