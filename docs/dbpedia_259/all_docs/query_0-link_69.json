        "text": "24 September 1935\n\nThe modified Leander class cruiser HMAS SYDNEY, (Capt. Fitzgerald, R.N.), was commissioned.\n\nHMAS SYDNEY was laid down in the Swan Hunter and Wigham Richardson Yard, at Wallsend-on-Tyne, England, on 8 July 1933, as HMS PHAETON, and launched 22 September 1934, after having been purchased for the RAN, as HMAS SYDNEY. Mrs. S.M. Bruce, (wife of the Australian High Commissioner), performed the launching ceremony.\n\n31 October 1935\n\nHMAS SYDNEY, was ordered to join 2 Cruiser Squadron in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean Fleet was strengthened as a result of the Abyssinian Crisis.\n\n22 January 1936\n\nHMA Ships AUSTRALIA and SYDNEY (cruisers), fired a 21-gun royal salute at sea on the accession to the throne of Edward VIII.\n\n11 March 1936\n\nHMAS SYDNEY (cruiser) joined HMAS AUSTRALIA in Admiral Sir Max Horton's 1 Cruiser Squadron based at Malta.\n\n14 July 1936\n\nHMA Ships AUSTRALIA and SYDNEY, (cruisers) were attached to the Mediterranean Fleet during the Abyssinian crisis once more.\n\n11 August 1937\n\nHMAS SYDNEY arrived in her home port (ie Sydney, NSW) on her maiden voyage after her detachment in the middle east with the R.N. has ended.\n\n03 September 1939\n\nThe Declaration of war on Germany was issued. The Imperial war telegram was received in Canberra at 21:50 local time. It read; \"Total Germany, repeat, total Germany\". At 21:15 in a radio broadcast, Prime Minister Robert Menzies announced; \"It is my melancholy duty to inform you officially, that in consequence of a persistence by Germany in her invasion of Poland, Great Britain has declared war upon her and that as a result, Australia is also at war\".\n\nThe strength of the RAN at the commencement of hostilities in WWII was:\n\n2 heavy cruisers, HMA Ships AUSTRALIA and CANBERRA;\n\n4 light cruisers, HMA Ships SYDNEY, HOBART, PERTH and ADELAIDE;\n\n5 destroyers, HMA Ships STUART, VAMPIRE, VOYAGER, VENDETTA, and WATERHEN;\n\n2 sloops, HMA Ships SWAN and YARRA;\n\n1 survey vessel, HMAS MORESBY;\n\n2 armed merchant cruisers HMA Ships MANOORA and WESTRALIA.\n\nThree liners, MORETON BAY, ARAWA, and KANIMBLA, were converted into armed merchant cruisers and manned by Australians, but operated as units of the RN. Eight smaller vessels were requisitioned and equipped as minesweepers.\n\nThe permanent naval forces totaled 5440 and the reserve naval forces totaled 4819 personnel.\n\n06 September 1939\n\nRates of pay in the RAN were:-\n\nOrdinary Seaman 2nd Class, (under 17 years of age), 1/9d per day;\n\nAble Seaman, 7/- per day;\n\nChief Petty Officer 11/- per day.\n\nRates for tradesmen were at a higher scale:-\n\nChief Mechanician 1st Class, Chief Engine room Artificer, and Chief Shipwright 1st Class, 14/6d per day.\n\nA marriage allowance of 4/6d for the wife, and 3/- for the first child, 2/- for the second, and 1/6d for the third and all others, was also paid.\n\n08 September 1939\n\nThe British Admiralty asked Australia to send a cruiser and five destroyers for service beyond the Australia Station. The five destroyers, HMA Ships VAMPIRE, VOYAGER, VENDETTA, WATERHEN and STUART were sent to Singapore for intensive training. The cruiser was not to proceed further west than Suez. Later, a request to send all of the ships to the Mediterranean was agreed to.\n\n06 October 1939\n\nThe Australian Government agreed to the detachment of 2 cruisers and 5 destroyers of the RAN for service abroad. A proviso in the agreement stipulated that the ships were to be returned if a threat in the Far East developed.\n\n16 November 1939\n\nCaptain J. A. Collins, R.A.N. was appointed commander of HMAS SYDNEY after reliving her temp commander T. J. N. Hilken, R.N.. Capt. Collins was the former Cruisers Gunnery Officer and then became the Cruisers XO, he was the first Australian to Command the Cruiser with all her Captains up to this point being RN.\n\n07 December 1939\n\nThe Australian War Cabinet considered a memorandum from Vice Admiral Sir Ragnar Colvin, the British First Naval Member and Chief of Naval Staff, which advocated that HMA Ships CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, and SYDNEY, (cruisers), be assigned to protect convoy US-1, (11 fast liners carrying 13,500 Australian and New Zealand troops), from Fremantle to the Cocos Islands.\n\nThe Australian Government would not agree to such a depletion of naval forces in Australian coastal waters.\n\n21 December 1939\n\nA cartoon in the Australian Newspaper \"The Bulletin\", depicted a cruiser with a badly crumpled stern passing the flagship and the Admiral turning to the Flag Captain:- \"Send for her Captain Prendercast. I'll teach him to play boomps a daisy\". The cartoon alluded to HMAS SYDNEY, colliding with a wharf at Fremantle some weeks previously after arriving at her new War Station.\n\n10 January 1940\n\nThe first Australian and New Zealand troop convoy of the Second World War US-1, sailed from Sydney for the Middle East. The escort consisted of HMA Ships CANBERRA and SYDNEY, (cruisers) and HMS RAMILLIES (battleship).\n\n17 January 1940\n\nThe first Australian and New Zealand troop convoy of the Second World War, US-1, sailed from Fremantle.\n\nShips in the convoy were:- STRATHAIRD, STRATHNAVER, OTRANTO, SOBIESKI, ORION, ORFORD, DUNERA 11, EMPRESS OF JAPAN, EMPRESS OF CANADA, ORCADES, and RANGITARA. Escort ships were; HM Ships RAMILLIES and KENT, and the French cruiser SUFFREN.\n\nAustralia had refused a request to involve HMA Ships CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA, and SYDNEY, (cruisers), for fear of depleting defences in local coastal waters.\n\n22 May 1940\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY, arrived at Aden, en-route to the Mediterranean. During the ship's passage from Sydney, she had struck, and cut in half, a whale, this was seen as something of a act of extreme bad luck to those that may have been superstitious on board ship.\n\n26 May 1940\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY joined 7 Cruiser Squadron operating in the Mediterranean.\n\n10 June 1940\n\nItaly entered the war on the side of Germany. An officer in HMAS SYDNEY at the time of the announcement being made was reported as commenting, \"The news came like the proverbial bomb in our midst\".\n\n11 June 1940\n\nHMAS SYDNEY, with HMA Ships STUART, VAMPIRE, and VOYAGER (destroyers), sailed at 01:00 westward from Alexandria, Egypt\n\n21 June 1940\n\nHMA Ships SYDNEY, (cruiser) and STUART (destroyer) supported a combined British and French Squadron in the bombardment of Bardia. During the action SYDNEY'S Seagull amphibian aircraft was shot down by three Italian fighters and crashed on landing. The pilot, Flight Lieutenant. T. McB. Price, R.A.A.F., was awarded the DFC for this action.\n\n25 June 1940\n\nFrance capitulated. Admiral A. B. Cunningham concentrated the Mediterranean Fleet at Alexandria to contain the French Squadron in the port. RAN ships with the Mediterranean Fleet were HMAS SYDNEY (cruiser) and HMA Ships STUART, VAMPIRE, VENDETTA, VOYAGER, and WATERHEN, (destroyers that were nicknamed by the German's as the 'Scrap Iron Flotilla' due to their age).\n\n28 June 1940\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY participated in the sinking of the Italian destroyer ESPERO in the central Mediterranean.\n\n04 July 1940\n\nHMAS SYDNEY, engaged in the removal of the French fleet from the Mediterranean, records in her war diary, \"Situation with French very critical\".\n\n07 July 1940\n\nHMAS SYDNEY, was straddled by a stick of bombs while operating with the Mediterranean Fleet. The C-in- C, Admiral A. B. Cunningham, recorded in his journal: \"On this day I saw the SYDNEY, which was in company, disappear in a line of towering pillars of spray as high as church steeples, to emerge unharmed\".\n\n08 July 1940\n\nHMAS SYDNEY, (cruiser), came under air attack whilst preparing for the Battle of Calabria.\n\n09 July 1940\n\nHMA Ships SYDNEY, (cruiser), STUART, VAMPIRE, and VOYAGER, (destroyers), participated in the Battle of Calabria. The signal, \"Enemy battle fleet in sight\", was hoisted for the first time in the Mediterranean since the Napoleonic Wars.\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY, (Capt. J. A. Collins, R.A.N.), returned from the fleet action in the central Mediterranean to Alexandria, was immediately readied for sea again, after being refuelled, ammunitioned, and having a bottom clean.\n\n18 July 1940\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY, (Capt. J. A. Collins, R.A.N.), with HMS HAVOCK, (destroyer), left Alexandria to protect four destroyers which were to hunt down Italian submarines, (HM Ships HYPERION, ILEX, HERO, and HASTY), and to intercept Italian shipping in the Gulf of Athens.\n\n19 July 1940\n\nThe cruiser, HMAS SYDNEY, (Capt. J. A. Collins, R.A.N.), sank the Italian ship BARTOLOMEO COLLEONI, (cruiser), off Cape Spada, Crete. BATOLOMEO COLLEONI, and her sister ship GIOVANNI DELLE BANDA NERE, were sighted by the HM Ships HASTY and HERO, (destroyers), 20 miles south of the SYDNEY. The destroyers turned north with the enemy in pursuit. HASTY signalled HERO: \"Don't look now but I think we are being followed\". Fifty minutes later SYDNEY opened fire at extreme range. By 09:20, the battle was over, with BARTOLOMEO COLLEONI sinking, and GIOVANNI DELLE BANDA NERE withdrawing damaged.\n\nThe following gallantry awards were gazetted for the action:-\n\nCB\n\nCapt. J. A. Collins, R.A.N.\n\n(seriously wounded 1944 on bridge of HMAS Australia during Kamikaze Attacks which all but crippled the ship and killed her captain and a large majority of her officers with the remainder also wounded badly)\n\nDSO\n\nCdr.

Enlisted RAN 1916 worked his way up through ranks 'highly respected and well liked by all hands' (J. A. Collins words not mine).\n\nServed on HMA Ships Australia, ANZAC, Adelaide, Australia (new cruiser part of her commissioning crew replacing the old \"Aussie\" as the crew called her), HMAS Albatross, then joined HMAS Sydney in UK as part of her commissioning Crew in 1934, HMAS Adelaide (1937) and finally back to HMAS Sydney in June 1939).\n\nDSC\n\nLt.

Admiral A. B. Cunningham saw the cruiser veiled in spray and signalled: \"Are you all right?\" Collins replied: \"I hope so\".\n\n28 July 1940\n\nHMAS SYDNEY and HMS NEPTUNE (cruisers) sink the Italian tanker ERMIOMI in the Aegean Sea.\n\n04 September 1940\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY and HM Ships DAINTY and ILEX, (destroyers), bombarded Italian airfields at Scarpanto.

HMAS VAMPIRE, (destroyer), picked up one officer and twenty-one ratings from the destroyer.\n\n28 October 1940\n\nItaly invaded Greece, and Greece joined the Allies. HMA Ships SYDNEY, (cruiser), STUART, VAMPIRE, VENDETTA, VOYAGER, and WATERHEN, (all destroyers), were deployed to escort supply convoys to Greece.\n\n06 November 1940\n\nHMAS SYDNEY and HMS AJAX, land troops and equipment at Suda Bay, Crete.\n\n07 November 1940\n\nHMA Ships SYDNEY (cruiser), VAMPIRE and WATERHEN, (destroyers) land troops and stores at Suda Bay Crete.\n\n11 November 1940\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY, joined in a raid into the Straight of Otranto, with HM Ships ORION and AJAX, (cruisers), NUBIAN and MOWHAWK, (destroyers), as a subsidiary raid to the Battle of Taranto.

The raider escaped before HMAS ARAWA could close with her.\n\n05 February 1941\n\nHMAS SYDNEY, arrived in Fremantle Western Australia her Australian War Station after completing her passage back from the Mediterranean.\n\nHMAS SYDNEY arrived in her namesake city and Home Port Sydney NSW, to an enthusiastic and deliriously happy welcome home march and party. The Governor-General Lord Gowrie, thanked the men on behalf of King George VI, and Sydney's Lord Mayor unveiled a plaque on the quarterdeck of the Cruiser commemorating the victory over the Italian cruiser BARTOLOMEO COLLEONI. Every man in the crew received a replica of the plaque that was on board at that time (this plaque was on board when sunk but its unknown if it was taken down or in place at its location).\n\n24 February 1941\n\nThe Admiralty informed the Australian Government that \"in the event of war in the Far East in the near future no major redistribution of forces is intended other than to send one battle-cruiser, one aircraft carrier, and one cruiser, from Gibraltar to the Indian Ocean and return those Dominion cruisers now serving with Imperial forces to their Dominions\".\n\n19 April 1941\n\nThe German raiders HSK ATLANTIS and HSK KORMORAN rendezvous in the Indian Ocean. On leaving the rendezvous HSK KORMORAN changed her 'disguise' to the Dutch Flagged Merchantman STRAAT MALACCA.\n\n15 May 1941\n\nCapt. J. Burnett, R.A.N. took over command of HMAS SYDNEY from Capt.

Collins, C.B., R.A.N. appointed Assistant Chief of Staff to the C-in-C China Station.\n\n20 September 1941\n\nHMAS SYDNEY was damaged by heavy seas in the Great Australian Bight. A turret was jammed to port, and the training gear was damaged - it is still hotly debated as to weather this may have been a factor in her loss or could explain her closing in the way that she did.\n\n22 October 1941\n\nCapt. J. Burnett, R.A.N., informed the crew of HMAS SYDNEY, that a German raider was operating in Australasian waters. The identity of the raider, STIERMARK, (the original name of the KORMORAN), was known to the Australian Naval Board on 17 October 1941. Captain Burnett concluded his address with an exhortation to his crew that he expected every man to be up to the highest pitch of training.\n\n11 November 1941\n\nHMAS SYDNEY departs as escort to the transport ZEALANDIA bound for Singapore.\n\n17 November 1941\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY handed over the escort of the troop ship ZEALANDIA, to HMS DURBAN in Sunda Strait and turns around to commence her return cruise to Fremantle Aust.\n\n19 November 1941\n\nThe cruiser HMAS SYDNEY is lost with all hands in an engagement with the German raider HSK KORMORAN approximately 130 miles off the coast of WA. The full circumstances of the cruiser's loss are still not known.\n\nHSK KORMORAN sank soon after the battle, but her captain and 314 other crewmen survived.\n\n26 November 1941\n\nCapt. Theodor Detmers claimed the last signal hoisted by HMAS SYDNEY was the two flags IK:- \"You should prepare for a hurricane or a typhoon\". The signal was not understood.\n\n27 November 1941\n\nThe sloop HMAS PARRAMATTA, (Cdr. J. H. Walker, R.A.N.), was torpedoed and sunk by the German submarine U-559, while on passage to Tobruk. Of the ships complement of 162, there were only 24 survivors.\n\n21 were picked up by HMS AVON VALE (destroyer), while another three managed to swim ashore to the Libyan coast and were rescued by advancing British troops.\n\nHMAS HEROS recovered a Carley type lifefloat and two lifebelts, 160 miles north-west of Carnarvon, WA.\n\nThey were believed to be from HMAS SYDNEY.\n\n28 November 1941\n\nThe Commanding Officer of the German raider KORMORAN, (Capt. T. Detmers), was interrogated at Carnarvon Western Aust. Only hours earlier HMAS HEROS found a Carley float from HMAS SYDNEY. The float had been badly damaged by shell fire, and was the only substantial wreckage ever recovered from SYDNEY. The float is now on permanent display in the Australian War Memorial, Canberra.\n\n29 November 1941\n\nAdmiral A. B. Cunningham, C-in-C, Mediterranean, signalled: \"I deeply deplore the loss of HMAS PARRAMATTA.\n\nThis fine little ship had built up for herself a splendid standard of efficiency and achievement fully in accord with the record of the Australian ships in the Mediterranean\".\n\n30 November 1941\n\nThe Australian Naval Board announced that six boats and two rafts, carrying a total of 315 German survivors from the raider KORMORAN, had been either picked up at sea, or found on the WA coast. On the same day the Prime Minister, Mr. J. Curtin, announced the loss of HMAS SYDNEY to the Country.\n\n01 December 1941\n\nAn RAN interrogation team, consisting of Capt. Farquar-Smith, R.A.N., Cmdr. Dechaineaux, R.A.N. (KIA HMAS Australia when Collins is wounded), Cmdr. Ramage, R.A.N., and Lt. Cmdr. Salm Royal Netherlands Navy, questioned prisoners from the German raider HSK KORMORAN. Capt. H. B. Farncomb, R.A.N. conducted a separate inquiry into the loss of HMAS SYDNEY.\n\n06 February 1942\n\nA Carley float containing the remains of a corpse was discovered off Christmas Island. The body was brought ashore and buried in the European Cemetery at Flying Fish Cove. It was believed at the time that the float and the body were from the cruiser HMAS SYDNEY, sunk the previous November, but the evidence could not be verified. Christmas Island was taken over by the Japanese in March 1942 and the Carley float and all records concerning it and the body were destroyed during the war. A search conducted by the RAN for the grave site in the late 1990's failed to find the grave and thus the mystery remains.\n\n11 January 1945\n\nTwenty German POW's escaped via a tunnel from the officers' POW camp at Dhuringle in Victoria Aust.\n\nOne of the escapees was Capt. Theodore Detmers, who was the Commanding Officer of the raider KORMORAN.\n\nDetmers was recaptured on 20 January 1945, some 32 km from the camp. He was sentenced to 28 days solitary confinement in the camp's 'Cooler'.\n\n02 November 1945\n\nCapt. Theodore Detmers, of the German raider KORMORAN, informed the Commandant of his Australian POW camp, of the whereabouts of film taken in the German raider at the time of the sinking of HMAS SYDNEY.\n\nThe film was not found despite extensive efforts made to locate it both now and after the war.\n\n24 August 2001\n\nA team of RAN and RAAF personnel were deployed to Christmas Island, to conduct a search of the Old European Cemetery, to find the remains of a sailor buried there in February 1942. The remains floated ashore in a Carley float in early February 1942, and are believed to have come from HMAS SYDNEY. Despite an extensive search of a portion of the cemetery, no remains were found, and the search party departed on 7 September 2001.\n\n18 November 2001\n\nA memorial to HMAS SYDNEY which was sunk in the action with the German raider HSK KORMORAN was dedicated at Mount Scott in Geraldton Western Australia. The memorial consists of a dome formed by 645 interlocking metal seabirds, one for each of SYDNEY's complement. The memorial dominates the Geraldton skyline, and has sweeping views of the Indian Ocean where the wreck of SYNDEY still lies.\n\n16 March 2008\n\nThe wreck of HMAS SYDNEY is located and identified."
