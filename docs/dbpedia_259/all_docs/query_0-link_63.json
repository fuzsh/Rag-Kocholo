She was transferred along with 9 other Canadian built Flower Class Corvettes in May 1941 to the RCN.\n\nLosses\n\nMV ALTSANDRO PODESTA (FI 633 grt) The cargo ship struck a mine in the Med Sea off the north coast of Sardinia and sank.\n\n[NO IMAGE FOUND]\n\nU.62 sank trawler CASTLETON (UK 211 grt) off the Orkneys with the loss of ten crew.\n\n[NO IMAGE FOUND]\n\nMV CRUZ (or CRUX) (Nor 3828 grt) Crew: 30 (0 dead and 30 survivors) Cargo: 6300 tons of patent fuel Route: Cardiff - Milford Haven - Rio de Janeiro Sunk west of Gibraltar. At 0228 hrs the CRUX, detached from convoy OG-34 the day before, was hit by one torpedo from UA about 300 miles west of Cape St. Vincent. The torpedo struck on the starboard side, abaft the engine room and caused her to sink with a heavy port list after 10 mins. The crew abandoned ship in two lifeboats and was questioned by the Germans. 20 mins after the crew left the ship, a southbound ship passed by very near, but did not see them in the dark. They did not use their flashes to make themselves known, because they thought that the U-boat was still near them. The survivors were picked up by the British steam merchant BRUTUS the following day.\n\nMV CYGNUS (Ex-Nor (Ger) 1334 grt) The cargo ship was torpedoed and sunk west of Hådyret, Norway by Sub SNAPPER. Some sources say this ship was sunk July 3.\n\nMV DIMITRIS (Gk 5254 grt) Crew: unknown, all rescued Cargo: 9028 tons of cereals Route: Argentina - Liverpool Sunk in the SW Approaches.

Fr sub RUBIS, which departed Dundee on the 20th, laid mines in Trondheimsfjord in minelaying mission FD.20. FS.205 departed the Tyne, escort sloops LOWESTOFT, STORK, WESTON and patrol sloop SHELDRAKE. DD AMAZON was in the convoy and as she could not steam more than 15 knots was not considered an escort. The convoy arrived at Southend on the 28th.\n\nMT.96 departed Methil, escort DD VIMERIA and sloop LONDONDERRY. The convoy arrived in the Tyne the next day.\n\nNorthern Waters\n\nBB VALIANT and DDs FORESTER, FORESIGHT, ESCORT departed Scapa for Gib where they arrived on the 30th. DD ASHANTI departed Scapa to search for a Gladiator of 804 Sqn which crashed 2 miles SE of Pentland Skerries. The search was unsuccessful and the DD returned to Scapa . Temporary Lt (A) H.C.

DD MASHONA departed Scapa for Rosyth.\n\nWest Coast UK\n\nDDs FERNIE and ATHERSTONE arrived in the Clyde.\n\nMed- Biscay\n\nFr sub NARVAL of SubDiv11, refusing to be demilitarised at Bizerte, arrived at Malta to join British forces. RM sub GLAUCO attacked an allied steamer off Cape Corbelin in the Med.\n\nIndian Ocean\n\nRM sub GUGLIEMOTTI ran aground on a shoal in the Red Sea. The grounding left GUGLIEMOTTI badly damaged, but she was soon salved.\n\nWestern Desert\n\nItalian forces in Tripolitania—facing French troops based in Tunisia began a steady redeployment East to reinfirce the forces in Cyrenaica built around the Italian 10A. This, coupled with the steadily degrading equipment of the British forces led General Archibald Wavell to order an end to raiding and placed the defence of the Egyptian border to a small screening force to be known as Selby Force\n\nM11/39 was the heavy component of the soon to be formed Libyan Tank Command. These examples were captured by the 6 Aus Div at Bardia january 1941. This medium tank was strongly influenced by 1938 British designs, like the Matilda I and Cruiser I.\n\nMalta\n\n37 civilians are reported killed and at least 57 wounded in air raids, after a failure of the radar and early warning system. The high casualty toll followed a complete absence of air raid alerts. Damage to a radio mast in severe overnight storms prevented the detection of approaching enemy formations, with the result that no warnings were sounded.\n\n27 June 1940\n\nKnown Reinforcements\n\nAllied\n\nBar Class Boom defence vessel BARCOTE\n\nLosses\n\nSub CONSOLE GENERALE LIUZZI (RM 1148 grt) was forced to the surface by DC attacks then scuttled in combat with DDs DAINTY, DEFENDER, ILEX sth of Crete.

The DD was ordered to return to Alexandria and HOSTILE and STUART departed to join the hunt. From the CONSOLE GENERALE LIUZZI and sub UEBI SCEBELI, which was sunk by the same group on the 29th, 10 officers and 72 ratings were rescued.\n\nSteamer KOLN (Ger 7881 grt) was lost in stranding near Gavle Sweden, after the ship broke in two.\n\n[NO IMAGE FOUND]\n\nU.47 sank Tkr LETICIA (NL 2580 grt) Crew: 32 (2 dead and 30 survivors) Cargo: 2568 tons of fuel oil Route: Curaçao – Trinidad – Falmouth Sunk in the SW Approaches 160 miles sw of Fastnet. At 1705 hrs the unescorted and unarmed Leticia was attacked by U-47 with gunfire. Prien showed his exceptional skills when the U-boat was only spotted astern when it opened fire from a distance of about 300 meters. The shelling killed the second engineer, seriously wounded the second mate in the left leg and slightly wounded the master on the right hand. Prien ceased fire after 20 mins when the tkr stopped to allow the crew to abandon ship in both lifeboats, but a crewman fell overboard and drowned during the transfer. After the lifeboats got clear the U-boat recommenced shelling the ship until she sank at 1811 hrs. The 3rd engineer, 4th engineer and a stoker had failed to leave the ship and jumped overboard from the stern. They were picked up by U-47, given dry clothing and schnaps and placed in one of the lifeboats after being questioned. The 3rd engineer had been asked to verify the ship name, as the Germans thought she was either the \"Lucita\" or \"Liseta\". First aid materials, some sausages and wine were given to the survivors before the U-boat departed. Not all acts of humanity were by the allies, and \"Papa\" Prien exemplified the finest traditions of the lore of the sea on many occasions. At sunset HMS HAVELOCK and HMS HURRICANE spotted the lifeboats sailing for the coast of Ireland and the latter picked up the master and 29 crew members. They were landed at Plymouth in the evening of 30 June.\n\nsteamer LENDA (Nor 4005 grt) Crew: 8 (1 dead and 27 survivors) Cargo: 1921 standards of timber Route: Halifax - Hull Sunk in the SW Approaches. At 0338 hrs the unescorted LENDA was missed by U-47 with one torp. Then the U-boat began shelling the ship for the next 20 mins until she caught fire. The crew abandoned ship in the starboard lifeboat, because the port lifeboat had been damaged by the shelling. The boat stayed near the ship for a while in the hope to find the first mate who was missing. The ship was on fire aft and amidships and the sea entered through holes at the waterline on the port side, so the U-boat left her in this sinking condition. But at dawn, some of the crew reboarded the vessel and they found the first mate dead on the port side of the upper bridge. A workboat was lowered and eight of the men transferred to it, whereupon both boats left and headed for the south of Ireland, just before two explosions were heard, followed by a tall column of fire which appeared to come from the engine room. The LENDA remained afloat for a while on her cargo, but finally sank about 160 miles sw of Fastnet, Ireland. The survivors were picked up in the afternoon by HMS HURRICANE and HMS HAVELOCK and taken to Plymouth on 30 June.\n\nUBOATS\n\nDepartures\n\nWilhelmshaven: U-99\n\nAt Sea 27 June 1940\n\nU-25, U-26, U-28, U-29, U-30, U-32, U-34, U-38, U-43, U-46, U-47, U-48, U-51, U-52, U-61, U-62, U-65, U-99, U-102, UA.\n\n20 boats at sea.\n\nOPERATIONS\n\nNorth Sea\n\nCL BIRMINGHAMwas boiler cleaning and refitting at Rosyth from 27 to 30 June.

The only Allied access route to the Island will now be from the Eastern Mediterranean. This will require any supplies from the UK travelling the long sea route round the southern tip of Africa.\n\nThe Island is currently in urgent need of 100,000 sandbags, 5000 tons of goat fodder, 500 tons of coke and 6000 of coal, and medical stores. The War Office has asked the CinC, Middle East, if he can spare these supplies until replacements can be sent via the Cape.\n\nWithin the next six months, it is anticipated that the Island will need a further 23000 tons of supplies for the Army, 10000 tons for the Dockyard and 2000 for the RAF. The relevant ministries in the UK will be notified of the exact requirements, which will be prioritised according to urgency.\n\n1306-1358 hrs Air raid alert. Two formations of 3 enemy a/c approach the Island at 15000 ft and attack Marsa, Delimara and HMS TERROR.

Five He 111s from I./KG 27 take off from Merville shortly after 2230 hours and head for the Bristol Aeroplane Company at Filton and the Bristol docks but the flight is aborted and the bombers return to France. At the same time, one Heinkel He 111 from III./KG 55 leaves the airfield at Villacoublay and succeeds in making it to the Bristol Aeroplane Company at Filton and dropping its load.\n\nA Heinkel 115 crashed into the sea thirty miles off Whitby due to engine failure during a minelaying sortie at 02.15. The crew were rescued from their dinghy, after 28 hours adrift and landed at Grimsby.\n\nEast Hull was to have the first daylight raid in the country, a lone raider, apparently undetected until too late to give a warning, flew over the City from west to east, made a few sporadic attacks on barrage balloons and then dropped sixteen HEs near the Saltend oil depot. The majority of the bombs fell outside the depot, but pieces of shrapnel from one bomb pierced the side of a tank holding about 2,500 tons of petrol, which caught fire. The flames licked the outside of the tank, bringing the temperature of the petrol inside to a dangerous degree, and burning petrol began to flow to a number of adjacent tanks. Water was sprayed on the adjoining tanks to cool them until the arrival of sufficient stocks of foam arrived to quell the fire. Before this was accomplished, quantities of petrol had been drawn off, they saved more than 2,000 tons of petrol in the affected tank. Five George Medals were awarded for bravery during this incident.\n\nA Heinkel He 111 crashed into the sea off Hull at 17.00, following the bombing of the oil tanks there. It was shot down by aircraft of RAF No 616 Squadron. The crew took to their dinghy and were rescued by the destroyer HMS 'Black Swan' and landed at Harwich.\n\nA Heinkel He 59 landed on the sea eight miles east of Sunderland after being badly damaged by Spitfires. The crew of four were picked up in their dinghy by a cruiser's sea boat. The aircraft was beached and examined for armament. This was possibly the first British violation of a white painted, Red Cross marked aircraft which was on a genuine search and rescue mission. The aircraft's markings were clearly visible and seen by the RAF pilots concerned, who also commented on the fact that no return fire or armament was discernible. After this attack, the Germans camouflaged and re-armed He 59s. By the end of 1940, forty of their air/sea rescue planes had been lost, twenty-five of them shot down by the RAF.\n\nGERMANY: General Göring gives final instructions to the Luftwaffe on its upcoming battle with Britain. He states that the air force is;\n\n\"...to attack the enemy air force by day and night, in the air and on the ground, without consideration of other tasks\".\n\nFighter and bomber forces are assigned to the three Luftflotten tasked with destroying the British Air Force. Luftflotte 2 and Luftflotte 3 will operate from France and the Low Countries while Luftflotte 5 will conduct missions from Norway.\n\nGerman Major General Alfred Jodl writes a memorandum stating that if a strike on Britain fails, the next best place to defeat Britain is in the Mediterranean. He later noted in his diary that the United Kingdom was certain to fall in time, regardless of the fact whether an actual invasion was necessary.\n\n.\n\nJune 30 1940 (continued)\n\nNORTHERN EUROPE: Work on the aircraft carrier 'Graf Zeppelin' slows to the point that the fighter group assigned to it, Tragergruppe 186 is incorporated into a working Geschwader, JG 77, with II(J)./TrGr 186 becoming III./JG 77. Major Heinrich Seeliger is posted as Gruppenkommandeur. The Gruppe prepares to move to Berlin where its pilots will be given captured French Hawk 75s to use in defense of the capital. Many pilots are not happy with the aircraft allocated them. Later in the war, in Italy, the II Gruppe is given Macchi C.205s to fly for a brief period, making them the only Jagdgeschwader to fly two different types of foreign fighters operationally in combat.\n\nWESTERN FRONT: Franco-German-Italian Armistice Commission begins session at Wiesbaden. Surrender of 220,000 French troops cut off in underground fortresses of Maginot Line. With the fighting ended in France, many German prisoners of the French are released from captivity.

Also finding freedom is Oberst Alfred Bülowius, the Kommodore of the 1st Instruction-Squadron who was captured earlier in June.\n\nFighters from LG 2 intercept one of the first RAF bombing raids across the Channel since the French surrender, shooting down three Blenheims out of nine from RAF No. 107 Squadron that are sent to attack Merville. Two destroyed bombers are credited to Oblt. Herbert Ihlefeld and a third to Obfw. Erwin Clausen. The Blenheims succeed in shooting down Uffz. Rauhut during this action.\n\nGerman forces occupy the island of Guernsey, the largest of the four Channel Islands and prepare the area for the Luftwaffe to fly sorties against England in the coming invasion.

Lookouts on the convoy commodore's ship had however sighted the U-boat shortly before it dived, and the sole escort, Corvette GLADIOLUS, went to investigate the contact. At 0118 hrs on 1 July the surfaced U-boat torpedoed the ZARIAN (which was damaged but did not sink), causing the corvette to return at full speed. U-26 would normally have made a run for it but was unable to outrun the escort on this occasion due to problems with the diesel engines. She was forced to to dive. The Asdic operators on GLADIOLUS got a firm contact at a range of 1200 yds and began dropping DC patterns only 10 mins after ZARIAN was hit. U-26 had dived to 80m and suffered severe damage; one of the aft ballast tanks flooding uncontrollably and causing the U-boat to sink by the stern to a depth of 230m (755ft), well beyond its safe dive limits. The corvette made four more attacks, using up nearly all available DCs. She then stopped amidst a large patch of diesel oil and waited for the U-boat to surface while calling for assistance. It is nearly impossible for a single escort, armed only with DCs to achieve a viable battle solution (with modern ASW ahead throwing weapons the normal ratio is about 6 escorts to a single sub) With the starboard electric motor and one compressor out of action, U-26 was finally forced to surface after 6 hrs, only 800 yards from the corvette, but remained unseen and managed to escape undetected. She was likley to make her escape at this point. At 0815 hrs that morning, a Sunderland Mk.I (10 Sqn RAAF) sighted the fleeing U-26 and dropped four 250 lb ASW bombs as it dived, forcing the U-boat to surface again almost at once. The Sunderland attacked again, dropping a second stick of four bombs that detonated about 40m (130ft) away. HMS GLADIOLUS had sighted a cloud of smoke from the U-boat diesels simultaneously with the a/c and made for it at top speed, but HMS ROCHESTER which was by now on the scene as a reinfocement arriving from the dispersed convoy OB 174, was faster. Unable to dive, the crew of U-26 prepared the boat for scuttling and began to abandon ship, when the sloop approached, firing over their heads in an attempt to discourage them from scuttling. The Boat did sink and the German crew taken prisoner\n\nU-26 under attack by a Sunderland flying boat from 10 sqn RAAF 1 July 1940\n\nDD VANSITTART, escorting tug SALVONIA to meet ZARIAN in the SW Approaches , attacked and sank Type VIIB U.102 (DKM 753 grt) with the loss of all 43 crew . U.102 was on her first war patrol, had attacked a convoy on 30 June off North Channel, and was not heard from again, believed lost, cause unknown. However recent investigation has now attributed her loss to DC attacks by VANSITTART.\n\nBefore being sunk U.102 sank the MV CLEARTON (UK 5219 grt) Crew: 34 (9 dead and 25 survivors) Cargo: 7320 tons of cereals Route: Rosario - Freetown - Manchester in the SW Approaches.

Sunderland a/c of 228 and 230 Squadrons operating 12 hour naval patrols over wide area covering Greek coast, south Italian coast and Sicily under direct instructions from Middle East and HQ Mediterranean.\n\nJuly 3 Wednesday\n\nUNITED KINGDOM: Due to heavy losses from the Luftwaffe the British suspended all traffic through the English Channel. Meanwhile, the British decided that harbors on the Channel coast and German shipping should be the primary targets of bombing. There have been some suggestions, supported by Admiral Pound, the First Sea Lord, that the British Fleet should be withdrawn from the eastern Mediterranean. The idea is rejected by Churchill. The British government and Admiralty are also worried by the status of the French navy and fear that it will fall into German hands.\n\nOperation Catapult: At dawn, the British Royal Navy boarded two French battleships, nine destroyers, and a number of other smaller warships that were docked at Plymouth and Portsmouth, England. 3 British and 1 French sailors were killed. British forces seize 59 major French warships in British harbors, including battleships \"Courbet\" and \"Paris\" and giant submarine \"Surcouf\".\n\nGerman Luftwaffe aircraft bombed Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom.\n\nAfter the dock raids from the day before, Fighter Command's orders a standing patrol to be flown from one airfield in each sector, creating a protective grid over the Channel. Despite this new policy, shortly after 1500 hours, three Ju 88s of II./KG 51 attack the Portishead docks in Bristol again. Another flight of Do 17s from KG 77 attack areas near Kent. Seven Dorniers are shot down by British fighters.\n\nOver No. 13 EFTS at Maidenhead, a single Dornier Do 17 dives out of the clouds and attacks. Six Tiger Moths are destroyed on the ground along with twenty-five severely damaged.\n\nThe self-propelled bucket dredger 'Coquetmouth' (447t) struck a magnetic mine and sank ½ mile off Amble Harbour entrance, with the loss of 3 lives. She used to keep Amble Harbour dredged, moving 900 tons of sand each day.\n\nMEDITERRANEAN: Battle of Mers-el-Kébir: At 0545 hours, Vice Admiral James Somerville and his British Royal Navy Force H arrived off of Mers-el-Kébir, Algeria where a powerful fleet under French Admiral Marcel Gensoul resided. Vice Admiral Somerville offers French Admiral Marcel Gensoul (a known Anglophobe, loyal to the Vichy government) four alternatives for his fleet; join the Royal Navy; be interned in British ports, be decommissioned in the West Indies or USA, or sink the warships in Mers-el-Kebir harbour. At 1756 hours, after Gensoul refused to surrender, the British fleet opened fire for 10 minutes. The magazine of French battleship \"Bretagne\" was hit, sinking her, taking down 977 French sailors. Battleship \"Provence\", battleship \"Dunkerque\", and destroyer \"Mogador\" were damaged. In total, 1,297 French sailors were killed and 350 were wounded. After the battle, French battleship \"Strasbourg\", carrier \"Commandant Teste\", and four destroyers escape from Mers-el-Kébir following the attack and evade the British blockade. 6 French cruisers and 4 destroyers leave Algiers on the news. They rendezvous and escape to Toulon, France, arriving on 4 July, despite bombing attacks by Fairey Swordfish from British aircraft carrier HMS \"Ark Royal\".\n\nBritish Navy Vice Admiral Sir Andrew Cunnigham demanded the French warships under French Admiral René-Émile Godfroy, docked at Alexandria in Egypt, to surrender. Negotiations continue all day and the French ships (battleship \"Lorraine\" and 4 cruisers) are not attacked. Negotiations would continue until 7 Jul 1940.\n\nGERMANY: General Franz Halder, the German Army Chief of Staff, asked his staff to consider a \"military blow\" in the east, to keep the Soviet armed forces at arm's length.\n\nWESTERN FRONT: Upon hearing the news of British attacks on French warships, six French cruisers and 4 destroyers left various ports in Algiers for Toulon, France. They were attacked by British Swordfish carrier aircraft from HMS \"Ark Royal\" en route, but they would arrive at Toulon on 4 Jul 1940.\n\nNORTH AFRICA: The British founded the Long Range Desert Group under the command of Acting Brigadier Ralph Bagnold with purpose of long range reconnaissance patrols behind the Italian lines, into Libya, to gather intelligence.\n\n. .\n\n3 July 1940\n\nKnown Reinforcements\n\nAxis\n\nTorpedoboote 1935 T-9\n\nAllied\n\nFlower Class Corvette CHILLIWACK\n\nHMCS Chilliwack, circa 1942.\n\nLosses\n\nSteam barge BIJOU (UK 98 grt) was sunk by the LW at Mistley Quay, near Harwich.

They are Vichy, a Pro-Axis neutral, losses are therefore assigned to Axis losses. Whether it was necessary to treat them as enemy ships is an entirely different matter. \"Catapult\" commenced on July 3 1940. Early in the day all Vichy warships in British territorial waters were boarded and impounded by the RN (Operation Grasp); this amounted to 2 BBs, 4 Cruisers, 8 DDs, some subs, and numerous support vessels and smaller craft which had fled when the collapse of France seemed inevitable. This part of the operation went relatively smoothly, however resistance did occur on the Vichy sub SURCOUF.\n\nLater in the day \"Fe H\", with BC HOOD as flagship, drew up outside Mers-El-Kebir. A three-point ultimatum was sent to Ad Gensoul, the Vichy commander, giving him the following options.\n\nBring out your ships and join the RN.\n\nTake the fleet to a British port with a reduced crew from where they (the crews) would be repatriated.\n\nSail the fleet to a French, West Indian, or an American port and decommission the fleet there.\n\nGensoul decided not to act on this and, in an effort to buy time and ready his ships to fight, he opened a dialogue with the British officer sent to communicate with him. However Somerville soon became aware of Gensoul's vacillation and a 4th option was added \"scuttle your ships where they lie.\"\n\nAt just past 1pm the British decided to act and Swordfish planes from CV ARK ROYAL mined the harbour entrance. This action angered Gensoul who felt the British had acted in bad faith. However, despite the heightened tension outwardly all remained calm until 4:46 pm when Somerville received a signal from the Admiralty which brought matters to a head. The signal ordered Somerville \"to settle matters quickly\" as Vichy reinforcements were on their way. Somerville wasted no time. At 5:15 pm he signalled to BC DUNKERQUE that if his proposals were not met by 5:30 pm he would have to act and destroy their ships. The Vichy failed to respond. Capt Holland's negotiations had failed. Action stations sounded as the first salvo from the Hood's 15\" guns smashed into the side of the BB BRETAGNE (Vichy 23936 grt) causing fatal damage which consigned it to the depths along with 977 of its crew. Some ships of the French sqn were by this stage also beginning to get under way, contre Torpilleur DD MOGADOR was struck by a 15 \" shell which detonated her DCs and blew off 100 feet of her stern, killing 38 crew. MOGADOR sank in the channel, but was later salved.\n\nBRETAGNE about 20 mins before she blew up. MOGADOR after suffering her damage. Neither ship returned to service under Vichy. PROVENCE was also immobilised until after she joined the allies.\n\nFor 15 mins Fce H's guns ranged down on the fleet and the harbour causing a large amount of damage. The French had been badly mauled. Apart from the sinking of the BRETAGNE, BC DUNKERQUE was struck 4 times with heavy calibre shells, including a hit on her power supply, killing 5 officers and 41 ratings. BB PROVENCE was hit and had two turrets knocked out. She was beached to avoid capsizing. Gensoul then signalled a cease-fire to which Somerville replied \"unless I see your ships sinking I shall open fire again.\" As a precaution Somerville then pulled \"Fce H\" out of the range of the French guns. He assumed that his mines would stop any breakout by the remaining Vichy ships. However the Vichy BC STRASBOURG saw an opportunity and at full speed it picked its way through the wrecks and mines of the harbour and escaped Mers-El-Kebir. An immediate pursuit by the Hood along with a/c from the ARKROYALl began. However, Somerville felt the absence of these vessels left the remaining blockading ships too vulnerable and the pursuit was soon called off. The STRASBOURG made it to Toulon and remained in Vichy French hands. Despite this setback the Vichy squadron had effectively been neutralised but at high cost in human lives.\n\n2 Swordfish from ARK ROYAL were damaged attacking STRASBOURG. They landed in the sea and their crews were rescued by DD WRESTLER. The carrier was screened by DDs FEARLESS, FORESIGHT, and ESCORT for these operations. As the evening wore on, Contre Torpilleur DDs LE TERRIBLE and VOLTA attacked DDs FOXHOUND and FORESTER without damage to either side. Sloop RIGAULt DE GENOUILLY was damaged by gunfire from CL ENTERPRISE. A crew were killed and an a/c from 803 Sqn was lost lost when their Skua was shot down by a Vichy fighter.\n\nAnother Skua of 803 Sqn was lost when force landed into the sea near ARK ROYAL. The crew were rescued by DD FORESIGHT.\n\nAfter the bombardment, Force H drew away leaving DD WRESTLER to watch the port, but the threats posed by BC STRASBOURG and the Vichy DDs leaving port forced WRESTLER to withdraw. Two Swordfish of 818 Sqn were badly damaged and force landed after attacking the STRASBOURG force and one Swordfish was lost shadowing STRASBOURG. Their crews were safely picked up. WRESTLER picked up the two crews of 810 Sqn. After the Mer el Kebir battle, Adm Gensoul was replaced by Adm Estava.\n\nAt Alexandria Admiral Cunningham, excercising exceptioonal diplomacy in a very difficult situation was able to open a successful dialogue with his friend, and French counterpart, Admiral Godfroy. Despite orders from Churchill for results to be achieved by nightfall, he held the negotiations over till the next day, July 4, and a settlement was reached. Godfroy's eleven ships were immobilised in Alexandria harbour with the draining of their oil supplies and the handing over of their breech blocks to the French consulate at the port. These ships eventually rejoined the allies\n\nThe Vichy Government was understandably not happy at the turn of events at Mers-El-Kebir and other ports, but neither were they in a position to side with the enemy. Vichy was an unhappy and isloated regime, friendless and weak. For the RN it was a particularly distasteful experience. The British had killed 1200 sailors who, just 2 weeks earlier, had been their allies and in addition they seized, immobilised, or sunk a large part of the Vichy navy. Many French citizens who had previously supported the British, felt betrayed and alienated. Petain broke off diplomatic relations with Britain and two days later the French captured three British merchant ships in retaliation. Further skirmishes between the former Allies occurred for the next week the two most notable of which were the bombing of Gibraltar by the FAF and the torpedoing of the BB RICHELIEU at Dakar. The action seemed justified at the time, a functional French fleet in Axis hands was simply too great a risk for the British.\n\nUltimately the action at Mers-El-Kebir was a tragedy but the action had served its purpose. None of thge ships that were damaged were ever able to return to service in an active sense for the Vichy, and the action gave clear warning to all the wavering neutrals as to what Britain was prepred to do if backed into a corner as the Vichy had attempted. The French navy could no longer fall into the hands of the Axis powers and pose a threat to Britain at a time when she was most vulnerable."
