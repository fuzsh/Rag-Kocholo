        "text": "Organizations Involved in Holocaust Rescue\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere were hundreds of rescue organizations involved in the rescue of Jews and other refugees during the period of the Holocaust. These organizations were located throughout Nazi occupied Europe, neutral Europe, Asia, Australia, and the free world.\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of this list is to compile a complete database of organizations that were involved in the rescue, relief, and aid of Jews and other victims of the Nazis and their collaborators. This list covers organizations that were in operation between 1933 and 1945.\n\nThis list includes mostly secular organizations involved in rescue, however, religious affiliated organizations founded principally for rescue and relief activities are included in this list. For example, the American Friends Service Committee (AFFSC), USA, The Unitarian Service Committee (USC), USA, Christian Friendship (Amitié Chrétien) and CIMADE, France.\n\nWe have not included Jewish rescue organizations in this compilation list. We have created a separate website that documents and lists the major Jewish rescue organizations and their memberships. It can be accessed at: www.jewishholocaustrescuers.com/Organizations.html.\n\nThis list is organized alphabetically.\n\nThe list includes organizations that operated in Axis countries: Germany, Austria, Japan, Bulgaria, Hungary, etc. It also represents rescue organizations in Nazi occupied countries: Belgium, Denmark, Czechoslovakia, Finland, France, and Luxembourg. Neutral countries: Portugal, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden and Turkey. The free world, countries including: Australia, Canada, Great Britain, and the USA.\n\nThis compilation list of organizations is a work in progress. We will be adding more organizations in the future. In addition, we will be adding and expanding the descriptions of these organizations. Many of the individuals who worked in rescue and relief organizations were members of numerous organizations and can be found in other sections of this rescue website. Please see other sections, including Rescue by Country, Rescue by Governments and Leaders, Diplomatic Rescue, Rescue by Religious Organizations, and Jewish Rescuers.\n\nOrganizations Involved in the Rescue and Relief of Jews\n\nA-B C-D E-H I J-N O-R S T-V W-Z\n\nNote: +arrested; †tortured; *killed; ●Righteous Among the Nations (honored by the State of Israel)\n\nclick here for key to abbreviations of organization names"
