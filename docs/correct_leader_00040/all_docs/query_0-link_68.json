        "text": "The chair will be embedded in the research line Creating Value-Based Health Care, headed by Professor Silvia Evers and Dr Peter Schröder-Bäck. CAPHRI and NIVEL have been collaborating intensively in the area of research for many years. This alliance includes cooperation within the framework of the national CaRe research school.\n\nDe Jong will focus her research at evaluation of health care policy, (un)intended consequences of health care policy and the health insurance system. Organising a sustainable health care system with good accessibility and with good quality of health care is one of the biggest challenges that countries are faced with. Therefore, research that studies the structure, organisation, functioning and effects of health care is important.\n\nCAPHRI and NIVEL will be combining their knowledge and expertise in this new chair, while collaborating on various joint research projects. This is expected to yield more publications and greater social impact, while facilitating future acquisition efforts.\n\nDe Jong has graduated in Science and Policy at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. In 2008 she defended her PhD thesis ‘Explaining medical practice variation. Social organization and institutional mechanisms’ (cum laude) at Utrecht University, the Netherlands. Since 2009 she is Programme coordinator ‘Health Care System and Governance’ at NIVEL, leading a multidisciplinary research team. Apart from that, she is president of the section on Health Services Research of the European Public Health Association EUPHA and member of the executive council of EUPHA."
