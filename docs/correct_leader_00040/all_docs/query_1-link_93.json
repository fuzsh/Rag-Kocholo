        "text": "“Any museum which thinks it can incorporate or grasp the best texts and productions of modern artistic practice, believing the world is still organized in a center/periphery model, simply does not understand the contradictory tensions which are in play,” reasoned Stuart Hall around twenty years ago.[6] More recently, Sternfeld called for a “deprovincialization” of the museum by reflecting back its provincial character to the current state of the debate on museums in Europe and North America. It is a possibility for museums to no longer just create their own distorting mirror, but to redesign themselves in difference and negotiation.[7]\n\nThis has gained momentum, most recently since the summer of 2020, when the uncertainty, pain, and disruption caused by systemic racism and ignorance was ferociously amplified through the global protests of the murder of George Floyd. At the time, many “Western” cultural institutions aligned themselves in solidarity with the cause. The big question is now: Through which processes can this understanding, acknowledgement, and solidarity be turned into sustainable structural shifts?\n\nEuropean museums have to ask themselves fundamental questions. How inclusive are we, how diverse? What does inclusivity and diversity even mean? How do we commit to concepts such as “decolonization” and “globality”? How “radical” can or should we be, and what is “radical”? Will we find sensitive ways to redistribute resources? Are we able to tackle these tasks and challenges from within the institution? How can we better reflect the societies of which we are a part? Are we capable of sharing or even giving up power?\n\nMany museums are beginning to have conversations about these questions, creating thoughtful exchange, but also discomfort. They are trying to learn how to deal with that discomfort and how to turn it into productive and transparent processes. “It (the museum) must make its own disturbance evident so that the viewer is not entrapped into the universalized logic of thinking, whereby because something has been there for a long period of time and is well funded, it must be ‘true’ and of value in some aesthetic sense. Its purpose is to destabilize its own stabilities,” as Hall also once pointed out.[8]\n\nA crucial aspect of this “destabilization” is that museums are beginning to understand that concepts such as diversity, inclusion, migration, decolonization, digitization, and globalization are not a matter of “us” and “them,” but concern everyone, albeit of course in very different ways. It also includes an understanding that this is not a current moment or trend which can be “solved” by an exhibition, conference, panel, or performance before moving on to “the next hot topic.” Sustainable changes which go deep enough to cause real shifts therefore should be the goal. Museums do not need to be instantly successful in this respect. Only those museums which acknowledge failure, and regard failure as productive, will succeed in repositioning themselves in the long run. It might and maybe should take years of thinking, working, experiencing, talking, and growing. Benédicte Savoy once called museums time machines, as different times meet in these spaces. For example, the visitors’ time as well as the time of the museum itself—in the sense of the time when objects entered the institution, which happened at certain times and under certain circumstances, and which were usually favorable for the museums.[9] For Savoy, the latter is invisible time, which is becoming increasingly indispensable to make visible. To make that happen, European museums have to acknowledge these “favorable circumstances” which led to very one-sided ideas of art history. As Claire Bishop suggests, “This doesn’t mean that they (museums) subordinate art to history in general, but that they mobilize the world of visual production to inspire the necessity of standing on the right side of history.”[10] Of course, it remains debatable what the “right” side of history is. But it certainly includes one thing: The fact that the most varied art histories already exist, along with not one, but many canons. This is also reflected in this issue of Stedelijk Studies, where key concepts of these histories, such as “modernity/modernism” and “decolonization,” are being interpreted by the contributing authors in different ways.\n\nModernism, as an expression and reflection of “Western” metropolitan cultures of the past century, determined the hierarchies of a supposed art historical canon. This universalizing idea of Modernism either expected any “non-Western” artistic production to accord to it or merely perceived it as a mimicry of Western counterparts. Consequently, this negated the emergence of Modern art beyond Euro-America. In recent years the idea that there have been multiple Modernisms around the globe has slowly emerged within “Western” perceptions of art history. There have been and still are numerous efforts to define a corrective towards the Eurocentric historiography. This includes the acknowledgement of the interdependences between modernism and colonialism, as well as how such interdependences intersect with other concerns of critical discourses. In accordance with that, there are also highly varied, more specified definitions of these modernisms. One aspect which might unify those various definitions could be called “global Modernisms,” which describes the idea of the transnational entanglement of Modernist arts, meaning any art that is not “pre-modern,” “early modern,” or “traditional” in their respective contexts. Another approach is the idea that modernity and hence also “Modern art” is a specific genealogy of “Western” civilization, which in turn regards thought concepts outside of it as independent totalities which cannot be reduced to the history of modernity.\n\nThe definition of decolonization as a concept is similarly complex and multilayered. It greatly depends on the contexts it is associated with—visual arts, design, education, etc. The various ways in which the contributors use it in this issue of Stedelijk Studies are therefore merely a glimpse of a reflection of what decolonization should, could, can, or will be. The acknowledgement of abusive racist global and local systems and networks, however, is the ultimate bottom line. As a result, what ideas of decolonization do have in common is that these are about unlearning, changing, or even building new structures; about recentering, sharing power, and redistributing resources.\n\nLike the museum, Stedelijk Studies is also in a transition phase. The process of compiling this edition was accompanied by many thoughts on how the journal can begin to adapt to the shifts within the debates and within the institution. This included the consideration to open up in various directions; in terms of the assembled contributors, by moving beyond the until now strictly academic and mainly white European background, but also in terms of the format of texts. One idea in this respect was to consider different kinds of academic writing, as authors who are not part of the academic system certainly can be experts who provide excellent new insights. The goal was a greater accessibility of the produced content. This inherently leads to questions with regard to the very nature of academic research. Who defines its standards, and which tools measure its quality? What about the necessity to be aware of universalizing ideas regarding these standards, given that they are closely connected to “Western” definitions of academia? Of course, the realities of writers in highly varied contexts can—or perhaps rather should—influence their individual ideas about and perspectives towards academic methodologies. It is important to consider how the most diverse possibilities of access to knowledge production determine whether someone can (or wants to) rise to the academic standards determined from a specific perspective.\n\nWith this issue, we aimed for a varied set of contributions which we deemed reflective of the current discourse as much as of the history and present of the Stedelijk Museum. While this issue gathers texts that do exactly that, there are also aspects, such as more international perspectives on the decolonization of museum exhibition practices and collection strategies, which could have been addressed more comprehensively. This also applies to the idea of incorporating contributions from design perspectives, given that the museum owns considerable design collections. Part of these processes is that they have an unknown, uncontrollable facet. In particular in a process like this one, where contributions were invited through an open call. In addition, we should acknowledge that, while wanting to open up the academic sphere, it was not yet possible to change the common rule that contributors are not compensated for their writing. This, however, is a set goal to come. Unpaid labor is a strange luxury that many important voices from various perspectives do not want to and should not afford. We failed to adjust a system reiterating already existing hierarchies and inequalities—a filter which led to a preselection of those who submitted suggestions in response to the call. As a result, not all the topics that could have been possible are being addressed here. This failure is neither a problem nor a fault, it rather reflects the realities out there. Still, it is clear that this system urgently needs to be changed. Putting together this Stedelijk Studies issue therefore has been part of a learning and changing process which is not finished yet and will continue to be reflected in future issues that will be published.\n\nThe contributions to this issue touch upon four main aspects concerning the 125-year-long history of the Stedelijk Museum and its twenty-first-century challenges: collections, key studies of other museums as references or examples, (historic) exhibitions at the museum, and the topic of collaboration.\n\nIn his essay “[Re]collections, [De]collections, and the People Curatorial,” Ali As’ad examines the different collecting strategies of the Palestinian Museum in Birzeit. As’ad looks at how the museum, before it aimed to build a permanent collection, initially sought to preserve the Palestinian community’s cultural memory by digitally collecting experiences, interactions, and memories. He outlines how the museum used a collecting strategy of “lock, stock and barrel” by borrowing objects from personal or semi-institutional collections, and conserving, digitizing, and uploading them to an open-access platform. As’ad argues that this methodology of digital collecting distinguishes the museum from being “just” a Kunsthalle­­—an institution which organizes temporary exhibitions, but does not itself collect. Furthermore, he states how, by acknowledging everyday objects as valuable cultural resources, the Palestinian Museum claimed a museological historiography from its peoples, a “history from below.” According to As’ad, the Palestinian Museum thus established a “people curatorial” through the material participation and digital accumulation of peoples. For him, the “people curatorial” offers a different semantic model of a museum in the twenty-first century and additionally reflects a continuous commitment to restitution.\n\nNajiba Yasmin explores in her essay “In All Fairness: An Exploration of Ethical Collaborative Practices” how establishing ethical collaborations requires ongoing processes of collective (un-)learning. As a key study she uses aspects of the mediation program of the exhibition Chagall, Picasso, Mondrian and Others: Migrant Artists in Paris, which took place at the Stedelijk Museum from September 2019 to February 2020. Yasmin reflects on how the Salon, a concluding part of the exhibition and audio tour, which were both conceived by a team of People of Color (POC), revealed how obvious power relations as much as informal hierarchies still remained in place. While the museum aimed at including non-homogenous perspectives which actually make up the Dutch audience, Yasmin points out the importance of being careful in regards to how this aim was and is still exercised. By carving out the complexities of inviting POC creative professionals as collaborators of the museum, she argues for the establishment of a fair practice of collaborations by, among other things, shifting power, acknowledging privilege, identifying access barriers, and understanding the broader museum context, also through feedback mechanisms and aftercare processes. Yasmin is courteous not to mention it by name, but exactly in this regard something went wrong in the “Migrant Artists in Paris” project. We learned from her essay, and now we have to put into practice her excellent insights.\n\nWhere most museum collections have historically been very white and male, and many Dutch museums are late to the task of collecting outside of the safety of their Eurocentric bubble, curators are faced with a number of difficulties in their job of diversifying the collection and presenting artworks in a context befitting of our evolved understanding of colonial and social injustice. Fabienne Chiang’s essay, “After(-)Images: Problematizing Collections of Early Documentary and Anthropological Photography in the Art Museum in the Postcolonial Age,” looks into the difficulties experienced by the photography curator in particular. Touching on subjects such as the power dynamics between individuals depicted in the photographs and those behind the camera and the geographic and racial division of early photographs collected by institutions in the Netherlands—art museums such as the Stedelijk Museum, as well as ethnographic institutions—raises questions about how this distinction of the past affects our present, and ultimately about possibilities and difficulties in working together with ethnographic institutions in the pursuit of diversifying presentations.\n\nIn her essay “Space, Movement, and Body: Marlow Moss,” Gülce Özkara focuses on a particular case: an abstract painting from 1953 by Marlow Moss in the collection of the Stedelijk Museum. Moss encountered the work of Piet Mondrian in Paris in the late 1920s. They wrote letters to one another to exchange ideas and develop their theory. Moss created a spatial dynamic with distinctive double and truncated lines. Despite Mondrian’s apparent indifference to Moss’s theories, he quickly adopted this innovation from her. Özkara attempts to define Moss as much as possible in her own right, and her essay reflects on the interrelation between space, gender, and body in neoplastic aesthetics. She asks the following questions from a feminist point of view: How can engaging with geometric abstraction reveal that space and gender are related? How can feminist concepts of space disrupt the patriarchal spatial systems? What is the relationship between space and social identities?\n\nIn “Revisiting Wim Beeren’s European Utopia: Wanderlieder Thirty Years Later,” Joanna Mardal looks back on Wanderlieder, an exhibition held at the Stedelijk Museum in 1991–1992 and organized by Stedelijk director Wim Beeren. This project brought together artists from Eastern and Western Europe at the end of the Cold War. How did Beeren approach the question of East and West, and to what extent was the exhibition an effective answer to the changing Europe of the early 1990s? Mardal indicates how the exhibition was relevant both in its historical context, two years after the collapse of the Berlin Wall, and now, in times of European crisis and with new Eastern European tensions and increasing right-wing nationalism. Mardal’s article is the first to reflect on Wanderlieder from a twenty-first-century perspective, discussing the exhibition and its contemporary critical reception in the light of more recent literature on post-communism (Groys) and the European Union (Van Middelaar and Judt). It gives a brief analysis of a number of relevant artworks that have not made (Western European/American) art history books and returns to an exhibition that was optimistic about the future of Europe, albeit from a much less hopeful perspective in the year 2021.\n\nApart from the essays which comprise this eleventh issue of Stedelijk Studies, we decided to add one afterthought and an artistic contribution—submissions which were not part of an exhaustive peer review process but still help to reflect in different ways on the topics and concerns raised by the papers in this issue. The reason to include an addendum in addition to the other content comes from the aforementioned approach that we regard the repositioning of Stedelijk Studies as an ongoing process. These postscripts are therefore not only reflecting back but are also leading to possible future ideas and formats that might constitute upcoming editions of the journal.\n\nThe addendum, by Deiara Kouto and Anne Bielig, contemplates the inherent racist structures of cultural institutions and lays out the possibilities of anti-racist curatorial and scientific work in the arts sector. Their study of various methods to do so furthermore provides the context for a very honest presentation of the ambivalences and struggles young artists and scholars of Color must face when it comes to collaborations with cultural institutions and submissions to journals just like this one."
