        "text": "The department of Quantum and Computer Engineering (QCE) is one of the six departments in the faculty of Electrical Engineering, Mathematics and Computer Science (EEMCS) at Delft University of Technology. The QCE department research focuses on Computer and Network Architectures, with the ambition to keep its role as one of the top European research groups and to become one of the top research groups worldwide.\n\nComputer Architectures\n\nThe research on Computer Architectures targets the invention, design, prototyping and demonstration of disruptive computing accelerators/engines by making use of unique features of emerging devices (quantum bits, memristors, spintronics, graphene, etc.), while mainly targeting energy-constrained low-granularity computing for a wide range of edge applications, including AI, such as personalized healthcare, smart environments and drones. QCE research adapts a holistic approach in which it addresses the whole computing engine design stack (i.e., technology, circuit design, architectures, compilers, algorithms and applications) in order to maximize the computing efficiency, the main focus is on the middle layers (circuit design, architectures and compilers). This research goes hand in hand with the research on the dependability aspects of such designs such as testability and design-for-testability, reliability, security, etc. QCE has two research sections performing research on Computer Architectures:\n\nComputer Engineering (CE) focusing on architectures related to neuromorphic computing, approximate computing, computation-in-memory, spin-wave computing, new hardware architectures for Artificial intelligence, big-data architectures, hardware dependability.\n\nQuantum Circuits, Architectures and Technology (QCAT) focusing on quantum computing, including the development of materials and integration techniques for quantum and classical components, the design of the electrical interfaces for quantum bits using Cryo-CMOS circuits/systems, and quantum architectures; it operates in close collaboration with QuTech."
