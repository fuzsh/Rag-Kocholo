        "text": "The short- and longer-term effectiveness of a brief, multidisciplinary itch-coping group training scheme in adults with atopic dermatitis was evaluated. Clinical severity scores (Eczema Area and Severity Index) and validated self-report measures were obtained in a waiting-list control condition (n=30) and a treatment condition (n=61) at pre- and post-treatment and in the treatment condition at 3- and 12-month follow-ups. Relative to the control condition, all post-treatment measures showed improvements in terms of enhanced skin status, reduced itching and scratching and improved itch-coping patterns. In the treatment condition, the changes were sustained or further improved at both follow-ups. Also, the dermatological healthcare use was significantly reduced during the follow-up periods, in terms of fewer visits to the dermatologist and decreased use of topical corticosteroids and itch-relieving medication (histamine antagonists). The brief multidisciplinary itch-coping programme in adults with atopic dermatitis considerably reduced itch-scratching patterns, improved their skin status and reduced the use of dermatological care, both in the short and longer term."
