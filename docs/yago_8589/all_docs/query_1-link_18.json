        "text": "Perennially ripe for rediscovery, Julien Duvivier (1896-1967) was a prolific if uneven filmmaker with a five-decade career that included a short stint in Hollywood and encompassed a variety of genres.\n\nThe critic André Bazin considered Duvivier a pillar of French “poetic realism” (along with Jacques Feyder, Marcel Carné and Jean Renoir); Bazin’s disciples at Cahiers du Cinéma deemed Duvivier hopelessly square, although at least one, Claude Chabrol, later revised his opinion, pronouncing Duvivier “an auteur who didn’t declare himself.”\n\nOriginally an actor, Duvivier began his career in silent cinema, but, as evinced by “Julien Duvivier in the Thirties,” Criterion’s new four-DVD set in its invaluable Eclipse series, his strongest period was the transition to sound. Three of the set’s films, “David Golder” (1930), skillfully adapted from Irène Némirovsky’s precocious best seller; “Poil de Carotte” (“Redhead,” 1932), a sensitive story of an unloved child; and “La Tête d’Un Homme” (“A Man’s Head,” 1933), an atmospheric policier based on one of Georges Simenon’s early Inspector Maigret novels, all starring the protean, unglamorous Harry Baur, are exceptional.\n\nThe fourth, “Un Carnet de Bal” (“A Dance Card,” 1937), in which a young widow goes in search of her youthful suitors, has aged poorly, although it was — along with the exotic crime drama “Pépé le Moko” (1937), Duvivier’s greatest success — a popular hit in France and winner for best foreign film at the 1937 Venice Film Festival. (Janet Flanner, The New Yorker’s French correspondent at the time, called it “one of the grandest films Hollywood never made” — unlike “Pépé le Moko,” which was Americanized as “Algiers” in 1938.)\n\nThe great rediscovery of the Criterion set is “David Golder,” a controversial but not unsympathetic portrait of a ruthless immigrant Jewish financier (Baur). More an attack on French hypocrisy than an exercise in anti-Semitism, the movie is fluid, lyrical and inventive — as remarkable a sound debut as its source was for a first novel. Duvivier orchestrates an accomplished synthesis of Germanic lighting and Soviet montage, while providing an American-style narrative drive that builds to an extraordinary ending in which the disillusioned and dying Golder returns to his native Russia.\n\n“Poil de Carotte,” a sound remake of a 1925 silent film, is utterly different in style and tone, although also impressive in its use of music and overlapping sound, and distinguished by its performances (notably by the 12-year-old Robert Lynen, later a martyr of the French Resistance, as the rejected “carrot top”). Shot on location in a rural district of south-central France, it coincides with Renoir’s plein-air talkies.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
