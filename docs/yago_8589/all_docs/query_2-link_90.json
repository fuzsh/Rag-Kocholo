        "text": "In a mountain village in the Upper Valais, a man has just lost his wife. He remains alone with his two children, Jean, aged ten, and Pierrette, aged five. But soon, the father marries again, to a widow from the village, herself the mother of the little Arlette. Warned belatedly and still in shock at the death of his mother, Jean does not accept his stepmother's authority and sees Arlette as an intruder ."
