I find the country to be extremely underrated compared to its neighbors and the festival was nothing short of amazing.\n\nThis shot below is a stage where, what would end up being one of my favorite artists, appeared and gave a hell of a performance. A Portuguese artist which names escapes me (will upload tons of video) at the moment, it was great to see that I could actually understand her being that I just came back from Brazil.\n\nOne of my first views of the city of Ghent when I first arrived in Belgium. This picture alone I think describes the simplicity and the beauty of the city.\n\nThe drummers absolutely “tore the house down”!"
