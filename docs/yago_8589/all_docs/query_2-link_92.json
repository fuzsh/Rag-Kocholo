        "text": "PARIS, March 5—Charles Spaak, co‐author of the script Id the film “Grand Illusion” and more than 100 others, many of Ahem classics of the French cinema before World War II, died yesterday after an arterial operation at St. Roch Hospital in Nice.\n\nThe Belgian‐born writer, brother of the late statesman Paul‐Henri Spaak, was 71 years old. He had been retired at his villa Les Quatre Saisons at Vence.\n\nProlific and Distinguished\n\nA prolific screenwriter, who worked on scripts with some of France's top directors such as Jean Renoir, Jacques Feyder, Julien Duvivier and Andre Cayette, Mr. Spaak was perhaps best known for his naturalistic and credible approach to characterizations. Among his most memorable scripts are “La Kermesse Hdroique” (“Carnival in Flanders”), the 1936 impious farce about the effects, romantic and otherwise, of a 17thcentury invasion of a Flemish town by Spaniards.\n\nPerhaps even more distinguished was his work on the script of “La Grande Illusion,” the World War I drama directed by Jean Renoir, a now classic film exemplary of the finest to come out of the bustling French film industry of the nineteenthirties.\n\nAmong Mr. Spaak's many other screenplays are adaptations of Dostoyevsky's “The Idiot” (1948), “The Eternal Husband” (1949) and “Crime and Punishment” (1958); “Justice Is Done” and “We Are All Murderers,” both directed by Mr. Cayatte, and the adaptation with the director Marcel Carrie of Emile Zola's novel “Therese Raquin,” which was released here in 1958 as “The Adulteress.”\n\nMr. Spaak, who served a term as president of the French screenwriters' guild, held a doctor of laws degree from the University of Brussels.\n\nHis services were recognized by the French Government, which made him a Knight of the Legion of Honor.\n\nMr. Spaak came from a distinguished Belgian family. PaulHenri was Premier of Belgium. His father, Paul, was director of Belgium's leading theater, the de la Monnaie in Brussels. And his daughter Catherine is a prominent motion picture actress.\n\nMr. Spaak leaves his wife and two daughters."
