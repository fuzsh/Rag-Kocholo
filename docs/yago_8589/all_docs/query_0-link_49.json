        "text": "If you want a compelling insight into the collaborationist mentality of Nazi-occupied France, there's Marcel Ophüls's great 1969 documentary The Sorrow and the Pity, currently on re-release, and Henri-Georges Clouzot's poison-pen thriller Le Corbeau (1943). But surely this sprightly French costume comedy from 1935 by Jacques Feyder, presented by the British Film Institute in a lovingly detailed restoration, outdoes them all, giving the most vivid if inadvertent glimpse of Pétainisme in the making.\n\nThe Flemish town of Boom in 1616 is occupied by the Spanish, and in a craven attempt to persuade them to go away, the cringing mayor persuades his wife and other womenfolk to meet the occupying army at the city's precincts and pretend that he has died, humbly requesting that they should therefore move on out of respect for her widowed state and the town's general mourning.\n\nBut the army captain is having none of it, and instead charms Madame Burgomaster (Françoise Rosay) with gallantry that she certainly isn't getting at home. Apart from the sexual thrill, she sees an advantage in conceding to his authority: he can allow her daughter to marry the artist Breughel - a match her pompous husband has tried to forbid. Soon the whole town has succumbed to the charm of their guests.\n\nSo a foreign invader is welcomed - et alors? The cunning female strategy of collaboration has preserved the town in the long run and given everyone a much-needed holiday from the rule of their puffed-up lords and masters. This movie is half genial comedy, half proto-Vichy manifesto. It's difficult to tell, 69 years later, which half is more important."
