        "text": "The Flanders, Riverside and Northampton Community Association is planning a carnival at Southampton Town’s Ludlam Avenue Park in Riverside.\n\n“We signed the contract and we have our location. Now we just need town approval on the special event permit,” said FRNCA president Ron Fisher, who plans to meet with town officials this week.\n\nThe carnival is expected to take place from Wednesday, Aug. 10, to Saturday, Aug. 13, he said.\n\nFRNCA’s search for a carnival location took them from Big Duck Park to the Truth Community Church grounds and to Phillips Avenue Elementary School, all of which fell through, before settling on Ludlam Avenue.\n\nFRNCA plans to hold a blood drive and school supply drive in conjunction with the carnival. Those who donate school supplies will get $5 off admission.\n\nMr. Fisher said FRNCA recently received an anonymous matching donation of up to $2,000, based on how much money FRNCA raises.\n\n“What the anonymous donor requested is that FRNCA set up a crowdfunding campaign in which the community can raise funds from within, and this donor will match dollar for dollar what residents raise up to $2,000.”\n\nDonations to that fund can be made at the following website: http://www.plumfund.com/community-crowdfunding/FRNCA.\n\nPhoto Caption: The carnival will be held at Ludlam Park in Riverside.
