        "text": "Carnival of the Animals, composed by Camille Saint-Saens is one of the greatest delights of childhood…at least for an adult looking back on childhood.\n\nA host of clever people (including Ogden Nash, John Lithgow, and Jack Prelutsky) have written verses to go with the music (though, sadly, none which I have found so far can actually be SUNG with the music, maybe someday) and then have worked with illustrators to create wonderful pictorial representations of the works, including:\n\n*\n\nCarnival of the Animals\n\nMusic by Camille Saint-Saens\n\nPoems by John Lithgow\n\nIllustrated by Boris Kulikov\n\nJohn Lithgow reads some of his verses:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fh82uWIyIBk\n\n*\n\nThe Carnival of the Animals\n\nPoems by Jack Prelutsky\n\nComposed by Camille Saint-Saens\n\nIllustrated by Mary GrandPre\n\n**********************\n\nCarnival of the Animals wiki:\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Carnival_of_the_Animals\n\nThe whole orchestral work heard on YouTube:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjaBGAfWGSU\n\nThis video post includes a wonderful essay about the work and its components.\n\n**********************\n\n*\n\nMy favorite recording with narration for “Carnival of the Animals” is by Leonard Bernstein:\n\nLeonard Bernstein’s narration takes the listener through the piece, section by section and discusses how Saint-Saens put the music together. Mr. Bernstein does not talk down to the child listener, but engages in a real discussion. Knowing the thought process, instrumental choices, and musical allusions used by Saint-Saens, brings “Carnival of the Animals” alive, making the listening all the more fun and exciting.\n\nPreview or purchase the recording here:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Bernstein-Favorites-Childrens-Classics/dp/B001BKLNY0/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1343222071&sr=8-3&keywords=bernstein+children%27s+classics\n\n*\n\nAnother terrific recording:\n\n*\n\nDelightfully, I just found a recording of Carnival of the Animals which includes the inventive poet Ogden Nash’s verses, narrated by none other than Noel Coward:\n\nLink to purchase or preview the verses, here:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/The-Carnival-Animals-Saint-Sa%C3%ABns-Narrated/dp/B007RXTN7Y/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1335895074&sr=8-2\n\nSomeone ought to illustrate THESE!\n\n***********************\n\nI have a little fantasy to someday put all these items together, the picture books, orchestral recording, and Bernstein’s narration to read each poem, narration information and view each animal’s illustrations by various artists, sauntering through the zoo section by section.\n\n**********************\n\n*\n\nBehold the Bold Unbrellaphant (and other poems)\n\nPoems by Jack Prelutsky\n\nUnderscore Music by Lucas Richman\n\nIllustrated by Carin Berger\n\n*\n\nBehold the Bold Umbreallaphant (Poems by Jack Prelutsky, Music by Lucas Richman)\n\nCarnival of the Animals (Poems by Jack Prelutsky, Music by Camille Saint-Saens)\n\nPerformed by the San Diego Symphony Orchestra\n\nClick here to preview the tracks:\n\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Behold-Bold-Umbrellaphant-Jack-Prelutsky/dp/B005ZOGCHG/ref=sr_1_1_digr?ie=UTF8&qid=1347301466&sr=8-1\n\n**********************\n\nOn a related note, Ogden Nash wrote some animal verses (alas, are they the same?) that have been set to music by Vernon Duke and in another volume, illustrated by Etienne Delessert (making for an exquisite, but as yet unexplored, “singable” opportunity):\n\n*\n\nOgden Nash’s Musical Zoo\n\nPoems by Ogden Nash\n\nMusic by Vernon Duke\n\nIllustrated by Frank Owen\n\n*\n\nOgden Nash’s Zoo\n\nPoems by Ogden Nash\n\nIllustrated by Etienne Delessert\n\n(See “Ogden Nash’s Musical Zoo” for tunes by Vernon Duke)\n\n**********************\n\nA very clever set of animal songs, written by the British song-writing team Michael Flanders and Donald Swann (and at least one of the songs,\n\nThe Hippopotamus Song, has been found to be illustrated,):\n\nThe Bestiary of Flanders & Swann (vinyl album cover shown)\n\nWords and Music by Michael Flanders and Donald Swann\n\nThe Hippopotamus Song has become one of my favorite Singable Picture Book songs,\n\n*\n\nThe Hippopotamus Song\n\nWords by Michael Flanders\n\nMusic by Donald Swann and Michael Flanders\n\nIllustrated by Nadine Bernard Westcott\n\nISBN: 0-316-28557-9\n\nThis book features printed sheet music\n\n**********************\n\nRelated Posts\n\n*\n\nJOHN LITHGOW\n\nThe Singable Picture Books of John Lithgow\n\nhttps://singbookswithemily.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/the-singable-picture-books-of-john-lithgow/"
