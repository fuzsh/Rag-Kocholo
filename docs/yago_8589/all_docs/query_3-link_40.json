        "text": "We don’t know about you, but our mind is always focused on the weekend. It can never come soon enough—which is why we’re already thinking about what new restaurants we want to try or where we can drive for the day. Whether you’re looking to scope out the latest museum exhibitions or watch a movie outdoors, you’ll find plenty of things to do in L.A. this weekend.\n\nWe curate an L.A. weekend itinerary of the city’s best concerts, culture and cuisine, every week, just for you.\n\nThe Ford screens a trio of nature-inspired Hayao Miyazaki films at its open-air theater, including Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away and Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind.\n\nSabrina Carpenter’s sixth studio album, Short N’ Sweet, is set to drop this Friday. And Angelenos will get to celebrate the much anticipated new record with a visit to this exclusive pop-up experience, courtesy of Complex L.A. at 433 North Fairfax Avenue. Friday, August 23 through Sunday, August 25 from 11am to 7pm, folks can shop exclusive merchandise inspired by and dedicated to the 25-year-old singer and actress. From T-shirts to tanks, hats, totes, CDs and vinyl records, the roster of products on offer run the gamut in terms of style and genre, but each one pays homage to the artist behind the hit “Espresso.”\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe midnight snacker’s greatest fantasy is just a car ride away. One of America’s largest Asian food markets spans the course of Santa Anita Park’s front Paddock Gardens during the summer. Come hungry and come caffeinated—this lively market, complete with over 250 Asian street food and booze peddlers, live music, artists, games, and beyond, won’t put itself to bed until nearly midnight.\n\nWant to peer through the eyepiece of Mt. Wilson’s historic telescopes? Your best and most economical bet just might be one of the Talks & Telescopes events. These monthly Saturday night astronomy lectures are followed up with a few hours of stargazing on portable telescopes on the grounds as well as the 60 and 100-inch telescopes for only $50 (a fraction of the price of the observatory’s late-night stargazing sessions).\n\nAdvertising\n\nFans of Tim Burton will not want to miss this one: Warner Bros. and Fever have teamed up to launch Beetlejuice Beetlejuice: The Afterlife Experience, a new immersive activation set to debut on August 23 in celebration of the September release of the much-anticipated sequel to the iconic 1988 horror comedy. The 70-minute experience, which is billed as appropriate for all ages, will take over suite 201 of Ovation Hollywood.\n\nHilltop sunset views and rising bands combine to make this Getty tradition a worthy destination for Angelenos on both sides of the 405. This year’s lineup of free Saturday night shows wraps up with Woods. Tip: Avoid the traffic and the crowds and arrive early, preferably after 3pm when the parking price drops to $15 (though it’s $10 if you wait until the show starts). You’ll get to visit the exhibits, which stay open until 8pm on Saturdays, and beat the dinner rush.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFeeling like you and your four-legged friend are attached at the hip? Spend even more quality time together during this dog-friendly series at Palos Verdes’ South Coast Botanic Garden. One Sunday a month (usually the last one of the month), you can roam the gardens’ 87 acres with your fur baby. Nearly all of the paths are open to pups, except for the rose garden and a couple of other small areas. You’ll find plenty of water stations set up across the grounds, as well as an optional obedience class for purchase. You—the human—will need a reservation, while your best friend—the pup—will need to remain on their leash at all times, including in the parking lot.\n\nSupport under-the-radar Black-owned restaurants with Black Restaurant Week’s return to Los Angeles. For 10 days straight, this celebration of African-American, African and Caribbean cuisines highlights participating restaurants across the city who’ll all be offering prix-fixe plate specials. Find the full list of participating L.A. spots here.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWell, well, well, what have we here? The Nightmare Before Christmas’s bug-stuffed sack is once again taking over the Halloween duties at Disneyland for Oogie Boogie Bash, an after-hours, specially ticketed seasonal event at Disney California Adventure Park.\n\nFor those who still remember an embarrassingly large majority of the lyrics to “Rollin’” and “Nookie” comes this nostalgic nu-metal tour. The Loserville Tour includes a headlining set from Limp Bizkit, plus support from Bones with Eddy Baker & Zavier Wulf, N8NOFACE, Corey Feldman and Riff Raff. Of course it’s going down in San Bernardino.\n\nAdvertising\n\nBefore the corner of Fifth Street and Arizona Avenue gets frosty for Ice, you’ll now find a roller rink set up. From August 10 to October 14, Roll @ Santa Monica will let you lace up a pair of rental skates for a two-hour session.\n\nLike a family-friendly version of its Roaring Nights series, spend an evening at the L.A. Zoo on select Friday nights for a mix of musical performances, dance parties, educational talks and twilight animal viewing opportunities. The carousel will be open during the series, and so too—for those 21 and over only—will be a cash bar.\n\nAdvertising\n\nEach summer, Bard fanatics watch their favorite works come to life at the historic Old Zoo in Griffith Park. Independent Shakespeare Co. puts on a series of lively productions each week, inviting audiences to take a seat on the grass (read: bring a picnic blanket) and enjoy performances like this season’s headliner: As You Like It. With construction resuming on the main lawn, this summer’s show will move back to the dell at the top of the Old Zoo—meaning available space is smaller and reservations are required.\n\nEveryone’s favorite NPR member station has a hand in a slew of summer concert slates at public plazas and beloved museums, and this summer’s schedule is particularly packed. Familiar KCRW DJs and local buzz bands will be providing free, open-air tunes on select nights through September at CAAM, Descanso Gardens, Century Park, the Autry and KCRW’s Santa Monica headquarters.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe Music Center offers a free, joyous mash-up of music and dancing all summer long, with different themes (samba, Bollywood and reggaetón, among them) and free dance lessons plus live DJ sets. Head to the Music Center plaza and join in the fun—no dance experience required.\n\nEvery Sunday you can find dozens of food vendors at this market at ROW DTLA, with a mix of much-loved pop-ups and future foodie stars. Look out for the market’s Ice Cream Alley through September 1, which includes sweets vendors Moom Maam, Kinrose Creamery, Nobuko Shave Ice and Happy Ice, plus pop-ups from 626 Ice Cream, Sad Girl Creamery and El Churro Panzon.\n\nAdvertising\n\nInitially a dreadful 1930s propaganda film about the absolute horrors of the devil’s lettuce, Reefer Madness has since morphed into an ironically pro-marijuana piece of pop culture—most notably with the 1998 L.A. premiere of this acclaimed musical satire by Kevin Murphy and Dan Studney, as well as its 2005 film adaptation. Now some fuzzy number of years later, the production has been reignited in L.A. at the former King King space on Hollywood Boulevard.\n\nNow one of L.A.’s most treasured summer traditions, Barnsdall Park’s wine tastings are back after a five-year hiatus. Perched atop Olive Hill on the west lawn of the historic Hollyhock House (which you can tour during the evening for an additional $25), the Barnsdall Friday fund raisers include fine selections of boutique wines provided by Silverlake Wine with a spectacular sunset and 360-degree views of the city.\n\nAdvertising\n\nSee a free salsa concert every second Friday of the summer during this series at LA Plaza de Cultura y Artes. This year’s lineup includes Rumbankete, Gabrielito y La Verdad, Son Mayor, Son Miron and Club Mambi—all featuring Super DJ Robby.\n\nNature lovers rejoice! Spend a day at the Natural History Museum’s Butterfly Pavilion, which will open from March 17 through August 25 with up to 30 butterfly and moth species and an assortment of California plants. The seasonal outdoor exhibit allows for adults and children alike to witness nature up close—we’re talking having bufferlies take flight and land on your arms or shoulders. Prime time for these unique butterfly flight experiences are between 10 and 11am each morning.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWalk through a pavilion of fluttering butterflies and peep a chamber with pupae and caterpillars at South Coast Botanic Garden’s seasonal exhibition. For an extra $6, you can pick up a flower vial or ring filled with nectar to attract and feed butterflies.\n\nIt isn’t summer in L.A. until the first cemetery screening brings hoards of movie-lovers to Hollywood Forever, toting folding chairs, picnic blankets, snack spreads and lots of booze. Each year, Cinespia brings classic cult favorites to the hallowed resting place of such Hollywood greats as Rudolph Valentino and Bugsy Siegel.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe masters of alfresco rooftop movie viewing have returned for another season of screenings in Downtown L.A., with nearly-nightly showings this spring.\n\nEvery Sunday during the summer at sunset, both hotel guests and vistors at the Fairmont Miramar can slip into something waterproof and enjoy a flick around the Santa Monica hotel’s luxurious pool. You’ll find a mix of nostalgic favorites and more recent releases on the Hulu-curated schedule. Eats and libations will be available for purchase from the FIG Restaurant menu, and though seating is free for hotel guests, visitors will have to secure a reservation; tickets total to about $60 with tax, tip and fees, but that includes a $45 food and drink credit plus complimentary popcorn.\n\nAdvertising\n\nFor more than 50 years, this venue has drawn theatre aficionados to its storied, open-air stage for engaging productions in a magical setting. The 299-seat amphitheater in Topanga Canyon hosts audiences of all ages for plays from a wide range of genres, like Shakespearean classics and folktales. This season, catch highlights such as William Shakespeare’s The Winter's Tale and A Midsummer Night’s Dream, as well as Wendy’s Peter Pan, Tartuffe: Born Again and The Hispanic/Latino/Latina/Latinx/Latine Vote.\n\nLet the wild rumpus start at this celebration of beloved children’s author and illustrator Maurice Sendak. The Skirball Cultural Center will be displaying more than 150 sketches, storyboards and paintings from the Where the Wild Things Are creator.\n\nAdvertising\n\nBest known for her rhinestone-studded paintings of Black women, collages of old Jet Magazine spreads and revisions of historic paintings, Thomas’s large-scale works (80 of them from the past two decades) are on display at the Broad in this transportive exhibition.\n\nThis major Ed Ruscha retrospective includes his meticulous photos of L.A. streets and a reconstruction of his Chocolate Room (which, yes, is a room made out sheets upon sheets of chocolate).\n\nAdvertising\n\nIt’s more than just the low clearance: This exhibition at the Petersen explores the custom paint, engraving, upholstery and, of course, the gravity-defying suspension of the lowrider scene. In addition to iconic cars, the exhibit spotlights influential artists in the Chicano lowrider art scene.\n\nSee large ceramic and bronze sculptures at LACMA plus a few more sculptural pieces and collaborative video works at CAAM during this crosstown exhibition of Black feminist artist Simone Leigh.\n\nAdvertising\n\nLocal illustrator Dave Pressler, who was behind the Nickelodeon series Robot and Monster, leads and curates this family-friendly, lighthearted show at Gabba Gallery, which features works from Pressler and about 50 other artists.\n\nMove through a suite of sci-fi installations that depict a world overcome by rising seas and unchecked capitalism in this exhibition from Josh Kline. The MOCA Grand Avenue show includes a mix of sculpture, photography, moving images and ephemeral materials.\n\nAdvertising\n\nTwo documentarians of Chicano culture—iconic black-and-white photographer Estevan Oriol and the former Teen Angels magazine—put the spotlight on L.A.’s art, lowrider and tattoo culture in this Beyond the Streets exhibition.\n\nSee exploratory pencil-drawn line illustrations from the famous French fashion designer’s archive at this OCMA exhibition.\n\nAdvertising\n\nSee works from seven contemporary artists (Eliseo Art Silva, Allison Hueman, Anthony Francisco, Maryrose Cobarrubias Mendoza, Christine Morla, Maria Villote and Junn Roca) who address issues related to Filipino culture and the Filipino-American experience during this exhibition at the Forest Lawn Museum.\n\nThis interactive Grammy Museum exhibition is put on in collaboration with HYBE (the South Korean entertainment company behind some of the biggest K-pop bands in the world) and will explore the power and history of the genre, with outfits and items from the likes of BTS, SEVENTEEN, TOMORROW X TOGETHER, ENHYPEN and LE SSERAFIM. Just note that tickets to the exhibition—which require a timed reservation—cost an additional $20 on top of regular museum admission.\n\nAdvertising\n\nHollywood’s Japan House has tapped artist Sebastian Masuda to dive into the roots of all things cute and colorful with this exhibition on Japanese kawaii culture. The free show includes multiple pieces and installations from Masuda.\n\nSee 1930s-to-50s concept cars plus artwork from Ed Ruscha, Andy Warhol and David Hockney at this Petersen exhibition.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe GRAMMY Museum celebrates hip-hop’s 50th anniversary with interactive DJing, rapping and sampling stations and instantly recognizable artifacts like LL Cool J’s red Kangol bucket hat and the Notorious B.I.G.’s red leather pea coat.\n\nTake an acid-blood trip through space with this stripped-back but searing Alien reboot.\n\nAdvertising\n\nThe #BookTok smash becomes a cathartic and nuanced abuse drama starring a bang-on-form Blake Lively.\n\nMinari’s Lee Isaac Chung goes from indie to windy with this helter-skelter tornado movie.\n\nAdvertising\n\nNicolas Cage is a living nightmare in the most chilling supernatural horror since Hereditary.\n\nRyan Reynolds’ snarky superhero strains to propel this yappy but hardly snappy threequel."
