        "text": "In lieu of an abstract, here is a brief excerpt of the content:\n\nPART FOUR 1925-1929 Therefore, dream and the fantastic are nicely externalized by music (Moussorgsky) and even better so by cinema (Charette fantome). Cinema, dream, and music form, then, a kind of Trinity: three states in one. And I have to admit, inspired by all this, that the cinema, as the translator of dream, may one day become a true optical music that transcends the scenario and causes the subtlest emotion to blossom in the self, through the rhythm and visual song ofimages alone—without any wordplay. That is a form of cinema, if not cinema at its best. PAUL RAMAIN was a cinema enthusiast who founded one of the earliest cine-clubs outside Paris, in Montpellier. He also passed himself off as a doctor of psychology, although he apparently had no formal training. 1 Midsummer Night's Dream apparently was a working title for what became Clair's Le Voyage imaginaire (1926). 2 Ramain is creating a neologism by splicing ''hypnotic\" with \"photogenic.\" JACQUES FEYDER, \"Visual Transpositions\" From \"Transpositions visuelles,\" Cahiers du mois 16/17 (1925), 67-71. THE CINEMA has scarcely gotten beyond infancy. It is still in its period of formation, that of \"essays,\" various experiments, tentative trials and errors, and also the most exciting efforts—those in which it sees opening ahead all the paths of virtual conquest and mystery, rich in possibilities. In the meantime, it can be pardoned for not always being entirely itself. Yet just as we demand that painting be above all pictorial, literature literary, and theater theatrical, so we are right to insist that the cinema above all be cinematic. The character or individuality of an art is comprised of an ensemble of means, techniques, and possibilities which constitute its own unique property. In the current state of the art and of visual technique, film still cannot escape completely from the influence, suggestions—and snares—that the other arts in general and literature in particular impose upon it each step of the way. Until the new order of things arrives, then, we have two kinds of scenarios : those composed directly for the screen and those drawn from theatrical dramas or novels. The future will see more and more cineastes worthy of the name adopting the former to the detriment of the latter. For two reasons, however, this first source of visual interpretation is temporarily impossible. In our age of literary overproduction, where bad books are almost as numerous as bad films, a well-launched book can easily sell its 150,000—200,000 copies. It's a publicity campaign, in effect, for a film of the same title. Producers are fond of saying that a film drawn from a celebrated book attracts many more people than does one drawn from an orig364 SELECTED TEXTS inal scenario, whose author may die unknown—unrecognized—however inspired he may be. That's an error of judgment from which the public will recover long before the producers do. The visual education of the spectator is proceeding slowly but surely. His revolt will be all the more sudden the less he believes in production company publicity. When that day comes, the cinema will take an enormous step forward and perhaps witness the collapse of the exhibition circuits of our cinema shopkeepers. The second important reason why we don't create original scenarios in France is that, ever since the death of Louis Delluc [March 1924}, we have not had any genuine scenario writers. Who could we compare with C. Gardner Sullivan and Jack Hawks, the authors of The Aryan [1916}, Civilization [ 1916], Those Who Pay [ 1917], and Blue Blazes Rawden [ 1918], with Jeannie MacPherson and Francis Marion, all claimed by America, or with Hans Janowitz, Hans Kraely, Thea Von Harbou, and Carl Mayer who do Germany proud?1 The dramatists and novelists who could give us some powerful and original work have no sense of the cinema; they have neither seriously investigated its limitless possibilities nor studied the technical resources for those possibilities. They all ought to submit to a reeducation and serve an apprenticeship in visual composition; but, because of their age and intellectual rigidity, none would even consider that. Now, certain modern writers—Pierre Mac Orlan, Alexandre Arnoux, Jules Romains, Georges Duhamel, Joseph Delteil, Andre Obey, Marc Elder2 —have come strongly under the influence of this new art form; but that influence has not gone beyond the point of the literary development of this or that page.3 It still has not provoked a..."
