        "text": "A hundred years ago this week, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg was in turmoil. Its ruler, Grand Duchess Marie-Adelaide, had abdicated under intense pressure, making way for her sister, the new Grand Duchess Charlotte, to become the nation’s new ruler and to try to preserve the monarchy. Today, we’ve got a look at jewels worn by both women — a rare example of a pair of sisters who both served as heads of state of their country."
