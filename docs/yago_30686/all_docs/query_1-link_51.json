        "text": "She began acting in theater productions at a young age. Her first film was in 1906 for \"Cines\" of Rome, in what is considered the first film adaptation of Shakespeare's \"Otello\", directed by Mario Caserini, her husband. She was the interpreter of \"Romeo e Giulietta\" in 1908 and then in other thirteen films until 1909. One of these films was \"Macbeth\", directed by her husband. From 1910 to 1927 she starred in 65 films, many of which are always directed by her husband, as \"Lucrezia Borgia\", whose interpretation gave her more notoriety. Filming theatrical activity immediately after leaving the film career.\n\nBorn in Trieste, Franca started her career winning a beauty contest, \"Miss Trieste\", in 1927. Eager to pursue a film career, Franca moved to Turin, where she tried without success, and finally moved to Rome where she started her brief career. She debuted in 1930 with the short film Arietta Antica, and then starred in Resurrection by Alessandro Blasetti, the first Italian sound film, thus becoming the first Italian actress to have spoken in a film. Franca is best known for the role of Mariuccia in Mario Camerini's What Scoundrels Men Are!, starred alongside Vittorio De Sica; at the height of her success, Franca decided to marry the film director Mario Sequi, retiring from cinema.\n\nIsa Miranda was one of the most significant actresses in Europe from the 1930s-'50s. Her remarkable talent expressed itself both in cinema and theater. She reached international popularity in the 1930s, especially in France, Germany and Austria, and became the only international movie star produced by the fascist cinema. In the 1950s, when her film career began declining, she played on stage in Italy, the US (\"Mike McCauley\", 1951), France (\"Le serpent à sonettes\", 1953) and England (\"Orpheus Descending\" by Tennessee Williams, 1959), receiving positive reviews everywhere. In the 1960s she started a TV career in England, appearing in many made-for-TV movies. She was a versatile actress, exceedingly sensible, a charming woman, and unjustly forgotten at the end of her life even by those who should have remembered her.\n\nShe was born in Buenos Aires with the name of Maria Esther Beomonte in 1916. She moved to Italy when she was 16 years old and she started her career with the movie \"L'arcobaleno\" (\"The rainbow\"). She very quickly became one of the most popular and successful actresses of the 30s and the 40s, she was the prototype of the typical girl of Rome's bourgeoisie and she worked with the most important Italian directors of her time (Alessandro Blasetti, Mario Camerini, Ferdinando Maria Poggioli, etc.). In the 50s she left the big screen and she became an appreciated internal decorator. She released an autobiography at the end of the 90s. Maria Denis died the 15th of April 2004 in Rome.\n\nLuisa Ferida started as a stage actress and first appeared in films with La Freccia d'oro (1935) in a supporting role but because of her photogenic looks and talent as an actress, she soon graduated to leading parts at the end of the thirties. In 1939, whilst working on Der geheimnisvolle Rächer (1939) directed by the celebrated Alessandro Blasetti, she met Osvaldo Valenti. The pair became romantically involved and had a son. Valenti had been linked with many Fascist officials and personalities for years, and this is the reason why he featured on the partisans' hit list. He was finally arrested in Milan, alongside a pregnant Ferida in April 1945. They were both sentenced to be executed and shot immediately in the street.\n\nEnigmatic, dark-haired foreign import Alida Valli was dubbed \"The Next Garbo\" but didn't live up to postwar expectations despite her cool, patrician beauty, remote allure and significant talent. Born in Pola, Italy (now Croatia), on May 3, 1921, the daughter of a Tridentine journalist and professor and an Istrian homemaker, she studied dramatics as a teen at the Motion Picture Academy of Rome and Centro Sperimentale di Cinematografia before snaring bit roles in such films as Il cappello a tre punte (1935) [\"The Three-Cornered Hat\"] and I due sergenti (1936) [\"The Two Sergeants\"]. She made a name for herself in Italy during WWII playing the title role in Manon Lescaut (1940), won a Venice Film Festival award for Piccolo mondo antico (1941) [\"Little Old World\"] and was a critical sensation in Noi vivi (1942) [\"We the Living\"]. She briefly abandoned her career, however, in 1943, refusing to appear in what she considered fascist propaganda, and was forced into hiding. The next year she married surrealist painter/pianist/composer Oscar De Mejo. They had two children, and one of them, Carlo De Mejo, became an actor. She divorced in 1955, then she came back to Italy,\n\nFollowing her potent, award-winning work in the title role of Eugenia Grandet (1946), she was discovered and contracted by David O. Selznick to play the murder suspect Maddalena Paradine in Alfred Hitchcock's Der Fall Paradin (1947). She was billed during her Hollywood years simply as \"Valli,\" and Selznick also gave her top femme female billing in Carol Reed's classic film noir Der dritte Mann (1949), but for every successful film--such as the ones previously mentioned--she experienced such failures as Die Glocken von Coaltown (1948), and audiences stayed away. In 1951 she bid farewell to Hollywood and returned to her beloved Italy. In Europe again, she was sought after by the best directors. Her countess in Luchino Visconti's Sehnsucht (1954) was widely heralded, and she moved easily from ingénue to vivid character roles. Later standout films encompassed costume dramas as well as shockers and had her playing everything from baronesses to grandmothers in such films as Augen ohne Gesicht (1960) [\"Eyes Without a Face\"], Jacky, wer bist du? (1960), Edipo Re - Bett der Gewalt (1967) [\"Oedipus Rex\"], Tendre Dracula (1974), 1900 (1976), Suspiria: In den Krallen des Bösen (1977), La luna (1979), Feuertanz - Horror Infernal (1980), Aspern (1982), Ein Sommer am See (1995) and, her most recent, Semana Santa (2001)."
