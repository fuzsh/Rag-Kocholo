        "text": "Prince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta, who has died aged 77, was, for many years, embroiled in an angry feud over his claim to the non-existent throne of Italy, which had been abolished at the end of the Second World War after a popular referendum in which republicans argued that the Royal Family had been discredited by its links with the Fascist dictatorship of Mussolini.\n\nThe king, Umberto II, who had reigned for just 27 days, was sent into exile with his immediate family, and lived out the rest of his life on the Portuguese Riviera. Yet small but vocal pockets of royalists continued to campaign to restore the monarchy.\n\nWhen Umberto died in 1983 the royalist mantle, and headship of the House of Savoy, was claimed by his only son, Victor Emmanuel. As time went on, however, Victor Emmanuel’s claims were disputed by Prince Amedeo, 5th Duke of Aosta, his third cousin. Both men were descended from the 19th-century King Umberto I, and although he was not directly descended from Umberto II, Amedeo had the distinct advantage of living in Italy.\n\nThe grounds of the dispute go back to December 1969 when Victor Emmanuel unilaterally declared himself King of Italy, claiming that by agreeing to submit to a referendum on his place as head of state, his father had effectively abdicated.\n\nHe was said, however, to have taken this action after Umberto called for Amedeo to visit him in Portugal to name him his heir after father and son fell out over Victor Emmanuel’s plans to marry a commoner – the Swiss biscuit-manufacturer heiress and champion water-skier, Marina Doria.\n\nIn the years that followed, Victor Emmanuel, who married Ms Doria secretly in Las Vegas in 1971, proceeded to add several more blots to the family escutcheon. In 1989 he was indicted on charges of having shot and mortally wounded a 19-year-old German while on board a yacht in Corsica. He was subsequently acquitted of manslaughter by a French court. His name was also found on a list of people allegedly belonging to the secretive P2 Masonic lodge, membership of which is illegal under Italian law.\n\nIt did not help his reputation in Italy that Victor Emmanuel lived in exile, mainly in Switzerland. In 2002, however, after Italy’s parliament approved constitutional changes, he returned to Italy with his son Emmanuel Filiberto.\n\nBut Victor Emmanuel continued to cause embarrassment. In 2003 he said the laws against the Jews, signed by his grandfather King Victor Emmanuel III, were “not that terrible’’. In 2006 he served time in a Potenza jail on charges of involvement in illegal gambling and prostitution, and accepting envelopes full of cash, which he claimed were contributions to a noble order. He was eventually acquitted.\n\nSuch antics, and his decision to pledge allegiance to the Italian republic, led the Council of Senators of the Kingdom, a private royalist association created in 1955, to declare Amedeo the real heir to the throne.\n\nThe conflict between the cousins reached a climax on May 21 2004 at a soirée held at the Zarzuela Palace near Madrid to celebrate the wedding of Spain’s then royal heir apparent, Felipe, Prince of Asturias. In full view of the royal guests Victor Emmanuel punched Amedeo twice in the face, causing him to stumble backwards down some steps.\n\nAmedeo needed first aid for a face wound and was reportedly saved from worse injury by the intervention of the former Queen Anne-Marie of Greece, who prevented him from tumbling any further.\n\nIn July 2006 Amedeo declared himself head of the House of Savoy and Duke of Savoy, and from his castle in Tuscany took to selling wine with labels bearing the royal crest, causing a furious Victor Emmanuel to declare his membership of the House of Savoy cancelled “because of his gravely injurious behaviour towards the honour of our royal person”.\n\nThe affair seemed to have reached some sort of conclusion in 2010 when a court in Arezzo ruled that the royal title could be used only by Victor Emmanuel and his heirs. The court ruled that Amedeo’s use of the Savoy name had been “unmerited”, ordered him to bring his “harmful conduct” to an immediate end, and to pay his cousin some 200,000 euros in compensation, as well as costs.\n\nYet the dispute continued to rumble on, flaring up again last month when Victor Emmanuel announced that he had abolished a medieval law that restricted succession in his royal line to male heirs in order to invest his 17-year-old granddaughter Vittoria Cristina Chiara Adelaide Maria, a burgeoning “influencer”, with the right of succession to her father Emmanuel Filiberto.\n\nThe decision was immediately denounced by Amedeo’s son and heir, Prince Aimone, as “illegitimate”, but Emmanuel Filiberto was having none of it: “They were thinking that me, not having any sons, they would finally have what they were waiting for... They got screwed.”\n\nMany Italians remain at a loss to explain why feelings run so high over claims to a throne that does not exist and for which there is little popular support, but royal experts say that only heirs to the throne control the orders that distribute noble titles in exchange for lucrative payments.\n\nAmedeo Umberto Costantino Giorgio Paolo Elena Maria Fiorenzo Zvonimir di Savoia was born on September 27 1943 at Villa della Cisterna in Florence, the only child of Prince Aimone, 4th Duke of Aosta, and Princess Irene of Greece and Denmark. From May 1941 Prince Aimone had been designated King of the Independent State of Croatia, taking the name Tomislav II, though he later refused to assume the kingship in protest at Italy’s annexation of the Dalmatia region, and remained “king-designate”.\n\nAmedeo, who was given the courtesy title Duke of Apulia, was named in honour of his uncle, Amedeo, 3rd Duke of Aosta, who in 1937 had been appointed Viceroy of Italian East Africa and commander-in-chief of Italian forces in the region by Mussolini, but had ended up interned in a British prisoner-of-war camp in Nairobi where he died in 1942, reportedly of tuberculosis and malaria.\n\nOnly three weeks before Amedeo’s birth, Italy surrendered to the Allies, and after Germany launched its counter-invasion, in July 1944 Amedeo, his mother, aunt and two cousins were sent to an internment camp in Austria. After the camp was liberated in May 1945 they returned to Italy.\n\nTwo years later, however, Prince Aimone left Italy for Buenos Aires, where he died unexpectedly in January 1948. The four-year-old Amedeo duly succeeded as Duke of Aosta, Prince of Cisterna and Belriguardo, Marquis of Voghera and Count of Ponderano.\n\nHe studied at the Collegio alla Querce in Florence and at Seaford College in England, then at the Collegio Navale Morosini in Venice and the Naval Academy in Livorno. He became an officer in the Italian navy, serving on exercises in the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. He also took a degree in Political Science at the University of Florence.\n\nFrom the 1970s he became involved in agricultural activities on his estates in Tuscany, including wine production.\n\nAmedeo was a Knight of the Supreme Order of the Most Holy Annunciation, a Grand Cross of the Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus, and a Knight of Honour and Devotion of the Sovereign Military Order of St John of Jerusalem.\n\nIn 1964 he married Princess Claude of Orléans, daughter of the Orleanist claimant to the French throne, with whom he had two daughters and a son. The marriage was dissolved and annulled, and in 1987 he married, secondly, Silvia Paternò di Spedalotto, daughter of the 6th Marquis of Reggiovanni. They had no children, although he had another daughter, born out of wedlock, with Kyara van Ellinkhuizen.\n\nHe is succeeded as Duke of Aosta by his son, Prince Aimone, Duke of Apulia, born in 1967.\n\nAmedeo, Duke of Aosta, born September 27 1943, died June 1 2021"
