        "text": "On 23 March 1732 at Versailles the sixth child and fourth daughter of King Louis XV of France and his wife Maria Leszczyńska was born. She was named Marie Adélaïde, in homage to her paternal grandmother Marie Adelaide of Savoy.\n\nFrom the death of her elder sister, Louise Elisabeth, in 1759, until the death of her father in 1774, Adélaïde was the oldest Daughter of France and among the most influential women during the reign of her father Louis XV and nephew Louis XVI.\n\nShe should have been raised and educated at the Abbey of Fontevraud together with her sisters, but was allowed to remain at Versailles after a tearful plea to her father. She was then placed under the care of Marie Isabelle de Rohan, Duchess of Tallard.\n\nAlthough Adélaïde was attractive and considered the most beautiful of her sisters – she possessed a ‘striking beauty of the Bourbon type characterised by elegance’, with ‘large dark eyes at the same time passionate and soft’ – she did not pay much attention to her appearance, which usually appeared unkempt. For this reason, her father nicknamed her Loque, which means ‘shreds’.\n\nMadame Campan, a reader of the princesses, revealed that Adélaïde had the ‘most insatiable desire to learn‘. She learned to play ‘all instruments, from the horn to the Hebrew harp‘. She studied calculus, English, painting, lathework and watchmaking (that’s where her nephew Louis XVI got his passions from!), as well as Italian and music.\n\nDuring her teenage years, Adélaïde fell in love with a guardian after observing him while carrying out his duties. She then anonymously sent him a snuff box with the message: ‘You will treasure this, you will soon know who it comes from‘. When King Louis XV heard the news and recognised his daughter’s handwriting, he offered the guardian ‘a gift’: he would be granted an annual pension of four thousand dollars on condition that he ‘move immediately to a place far from the Court and stay there for a long time‘.\n\nWhen Adélaïde reached the right age to marry, Charles III of Spain was proposed to her but, after seeing his portrait, she refused to marry him. Prospects with Prince Franz Xavier of Saxony and the Prince of Conti also never materialised because Adélaïde preferred to remain unmarried rather than marry a man who was not a monarch or heir to the throne.\n\nDominant and ambitious as she was, Adélaïde became the leader of the four unmarried sisters, among whom she was the only one with political ambitions. She and her brother Louis, the heir to the throne, were part of the Court’s Dévot party, which argued strongly against Louis XV’s main mistress, Madame de Pompadour, who strongly promoted an alliance with Austria.\n\nWhen Madame de Pompadour’s health began to deteriorate, Adélaïde became closer to her father. Their closeness, however, sparked rumours that the two might have had an incestuous relationship and that Adélaïde was the real mother of Louis de Narbonne. These accusations, however, were never confirmed.\n\nDuring the latter part of Louis XV’s reign, Adélaïde and her sisters were described as bitter old hags who had nothing better to do than gossip and knit in their rooms. In addition, they rarely dressed appropriately, wearing only paniers covered by a coat when they left their rooms.\n\nThe death of the heir to the throne and beloved brother Louis in 1765 shocked Adélaïde. Two years later, following the death of the dauphin’s consort, Marie Josephine, Adélaïde became an influential figure for her nephew, the new King Louis XVI, in the first years of his reign.\n\nAdélaïde, who had become the highest-ranking woman in all of Versailles, lost her position with the arrival of King Louis XVI’s wife, Marie Antoinette, whom she despised. She was the first to call the new Queen of France ‘L’Autrichienne‘ or ‘The Austrian Woman’, a nickname that would stick to Marie Antoinette for the rest of her life.\n\nThe Mesdames did not get along with Marie Antoinette. When the queen introduced the new custom of informal family dinners, as well as other customs that undermined formal court etiquette, there was an exodus of the old court nobility in opposition to the queen’s reforms, who gathered in the Mesdames’ salon. The Austrian ambassador Mercy reported that their salon was a centre of intrigue against Marie Antoinette, where the Mesdames tolerated poetry satirizing the queen.\n\nWhen Marie Antoinette, referring to the growing opposition to the monarchy, pointed out to Adélaïde the behaviour of the ‘shocking French’, Adelaide replied: ‘I think you mean shocked’, implying that Marie Antoinette’s behaviour was shocking!\n\nThe French Revolution forced Adélaïde and her only remaining sister, Victoire, to leave their homeland, moving to Turin, Rome and then Naples. They stayed at the Royal Palace of Caserta, where Marie Antoinette’s sister, Marie Caroline, was Queen. Talking about their stay, the queen commented: ‘I have the awful torment of harboring the two old Princesses of France with eighty persons in their retinue and every conceivable impertinence… The same ceremonies are observed in the interior of their apartments here as were formerly at Versailles‘.\n\nAdélaïde and Victoire then left Naples for Corfu, before settling in Trieste, where Victoire died of breast cancer. Adélaïde died a year after Victoire’s death, on 27 February 1800, in Trieste. She was 67 years old. Their remains were transported to France by Louis XVIII at the time of the Bourbon Restoration and were laid to rest in the Basilica of Saint Denis in Paris."
