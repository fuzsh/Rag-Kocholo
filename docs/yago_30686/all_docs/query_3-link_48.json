        "text": "A hundred years ago, former Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde died at the tender age of 29 at Hohenburg Castle in Bavaria. Five years earlier, she had abdicated in favour of her younger sister, Charlotte, triggering a constitutional crisis that could have seen Luxembourg become a republic.\n\nMarie-Adélaïde Thérèse Wilhelmine of Nassau was born on 14 June 1894 at Berg Castle, still the seat of the Grand-Ducal family although the château the future monarch was born in was later demolished and replaced with the current residence.\n\nShe was the oldest child of Guillaume IV and his wife Maria Ana of Braganza, and the first sovereign born in Luxembourg since John the Blind in 1296. She was also the first female monarch since Duchess Maria Theresa ruled Luxembourg from 1740-80.\n\nAs a father of six girls, Guillaume IV in 1907 removed a male cousin from the order of succession and proclaimed 13-year-old Marie-Adélaïde crown princess. She succeeded her father at just 17 years old on 25 February 1912, although her mother continued to act as regent until Marie-Adélaïde’s 18th birthday later that June.\n\n“Consider it, gentlemen, as a happy moment for the future of the country, the fact that the Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde is the first of our sovereigns to have been born on grand ducal soil, the first to have been raised there, and who, from her earliest childhood has breathed the air of our native land and learnt the ideas, the aspirations, and the traditions of the people to whom she has been called to reign over,” said Auguste Laval, the president of the Chamber of Deputies, in a speech at the time.\n\nDuring her swearing-in ceremony on 18 June 1912, Grand Duchess Marie-Adélaïde declared her interest in both political and social affairs: “It is the desire to judge in accordance with the requirements of justice and fairness that will inspire all my actions. Law and the general interest alone will guide me,” she said, adding: “Growing economic inequality between men is the serious concern of our time.”\n\nA devout Catholic, she believed she was sovereign “by the grace of God” and took an active part in government and political life. Unlike today, the constitution granted the monarch extensive political powers. Already on the day of her accession to the throne she refused to sign a law reducing the role of Roman Catholic priests in the education system, although she eventually relented.\n\nThe Grand Duke now no longer has the right to refuse signing a bill into law.\n\nLeft-wing and more secular political parties - the social democrats and liberals who were the majority in the Chamber of Deputies - objected to her active intervention in the running of the country.\n\nIn late 1915, for example, she dissolved parliament over the deadlock caused by a conservative minority government. Her actions were in keeping with Luxembourg’s constitution - and elections were held shortly thereafter - but they were regarded as unconventional and viewed as a coup d’état by socialists and liberals.\n\nGerman ties and WW1\n\nJust two years after she became Grand Duchess, German soldiers on 2 August 1914 invaded the neutral territory of Luxembourg, created by the Treaty of London in 1867.\n\nThe neighbours were closely tied economically and in political circles. Luxembourg had a tariff union with Germany, the Zollverein, the German railway network extended into Luxembourg, and German investors funded much of the Grand Duchy’s steel industry. Many of Luxembourg’s politicians had studied in Germany, too.\n\nGermany invaded on the pretext of safeguarding its railway. Marie-Adélaïde and the government formally protested against the violation of Luxembourg’s neutrality, but ultimately did not fight back, sparing the country from military conflict.\n\nWhile she and her sisters volunteered with the Red Cross in Luxembourg, caring for both French and German soldiers, Marie-Adélaïde also received Kaiser Wilhelm II at her palace. Some accounts suggest she had only learnt of his visit when he was already on his way, and was advised by her prime minister to receive the Kaiser.\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm, the Kaiser’s son, was allowed to establish temporary military headquarters in the city, and in 1918 Marie-Adélaïde sanctioned her sister Antonia’s marriage to Bavaria’s crown prince, who had served in the German army during the war.\n\nCrown Prince Wilhelm, the Kaiser’s son, was allowed to establish temporary military headquarters in the city, and in 1918 Marie-Adélaïde sanctioned her sister Antonia’s marriage to Bavaria’s crown prince, who had served in the German army during the war.\n\nRationing and price hikes, and a flourishing black market, fuelled social inequality and tensions between cities and the countryside during the occupation. The first two trade unions were founded in 1916 and a steel strike harshly suppressed by the German army the following year.\n\nAbout 3,000 Luxembourgers joined the French Foreign Legion during the war, including François Faber who had won the Tour de France in 1909. Others were involved in espionage for the British.\n\nWomen’s vote in post-war referendum\n\nAmerican troops reached Luxembourg City on 21 November 1918. The country’s government was considered “gravely compromised” and Luxembourg was forced to sever its ties with Germany.\n\nUnrest spilled over into rebellion in the capital in January 1919, and France sent troops to Luxembourg to restore order. Liberals and socialists called for Luxembourg to be made a republic, abolishing the monarchy.\n\nUnder intense local and international pressure, the then 24-year old Grand Duchess abdicated on 14 January and was succeeded by her younger sister Princess Charlotte. The constitutional powers of the sovereign were clipped significantly in the wake of the crisis, but the government finally announced a referendum on the future of the monarchy itself.\n\nUnder intense local and international pressure, the then 24-year old Grand Duchess abdicated on 14 January and was succeeded by her younger sister Princess Charlotte. The constitutional powers of the sovereign were clipped significantly in the wake of the crisis, but the government finally announced a referendum on the future of the monarchy itself.\n\nMen and women aged 21 or older were entitled to vote in the referendum and on 28 September 1919 some 80% of the more than 90,000 citizens casting their ballot voted for the monarchy.\n\nSome cynics believe that much support for the royals came from women, who had been granted the right to vote in May 1919, just months before the referendum.\n\nWomen were also allowed to run for office for the first time, and four women ran in the 1919 general elections, including Luxembourg’s first female MP, teacher Marguerite Thomas-Clement.\n\nIn the European context, Luxembourg granted women the right to vote after Austria and Germany, who both did so in November 1918, but before Belgium (restricted women’s vote in 1919, and equal voting terms in 1948), France (April 1944) and the UK (restricted women’s vote in 1919, and equal terms in 1928).\n\nComfort in her religion\n\nMarie-Adélaïde following her abdication left Luxembourg and travelled Europe, eventually entering a Carmelite convent in Modena in Italy in 1920. She later became a nun in Rome, but had to leave the convent due to ill health.\n\nThe former grand duchess never married and had no children.\n\nShe died on 24 January 1924 of influenza at Schloss Hohenburg in Bavaria, a residence owned by the grand ducal family where her mother, Maria Ana, also lived. Marie-Adélaïde was just 29 years old. Her remains were interred in Notre Dame Cathedral in the Grand Ducal crypt in 1947.\n\nHer sister, Charlotte, would become one of Luxembourg’s most-revered and beloved monarchs, leading the country through the Second World War from exile."
