        "text": "31 July 2024\n\nJ. C. Nattes, Versailles, Paris, and St Denis (1810), ‘Bridge of the Hôtel Dieu, with the Church of Notre Dame’\n\nThis year’s Olympic Games have put the spotlight of world attention on the iconic cityscapes of Paris. British fascination with the French capital is already attested by the early nineteenth-century illustrated books in Emmanuel’s collection. One of the interests in these books now is that the Paris they record – and the perceptions of it – are not the city as it would be re-fashioned later in the century and is broadly still. There is, of course, no Eiffel Tower (1889) and no Sacré-Coeur (1876-91). Even the Arc de Triomphe, though begun in 1806, took 30 years to build. Construction of the great boulevards of the Second Empire (1852-70), which flattened large areas of the old Paris, were still in the future. So too were the new green spaces – Bois de Boulogne, Bois de Vincennes etc – which Napoleon III ordered to be made at the four compass points, because he wanted Parisians to have the green spaces that he remembered from his exile in London, especially Hyde Park. The Emperor gave orders that Paris be beautified, and it was.\n\nIllustrations of Paris produced rather earlier in this country therefore have a different focus. Some dwell on customs and characteristics, on street life. Some are interested in recording the jumbled and quaint in ancient buildings and streetscapes. As so often, the focus is on the picturesque, and books that are concerned with ‘views’ of the significant buildings of the old Paris will present them with some picturesquely decayed and shabby aspects.\n\nThe frontispiece to David Carey’s Life in Paris (1828), with illustrations by George Cruickshank, is a revealing cartoon of British perceptions of the French and hence of their capital.\n\nD. Carey, Life in Paris (1822). Frontispiece\n\nAt the top is a balloon because ‘their light ascending spirits are appropriately figured by a Balloon'. There are song, music and dancing, to which the French are ‘very partial’, and then a duel, under the heading of ‘Honour’, about which the French are reported to be very touchy. Glory is inscribed on a flag because the French think no one possesses it except them. Politeness is signalled by two obsequious figures. Below is Love, with a blindfolded Cupid behind an amply endowed barmaid in a café. Beneath are some gamblers because ‘the vice of gambling pervades all classes in France’. Two French women bear up industry, which the male figures neglect.\n\nThe sub-title to Carey’s book summons up a kind of British engagement with ‘abroad’ that is perhaps still alive in mass tourism: it comprises ‘the Rambles, Sprees, and Amours of Dick Wildfire … and his Bang-Up Companions … with the Whimsical Adventures of the Halibut Family, including Sketches of … Eccentric Characters in the French Metropolis’. The sub-title of William Combe’s Dr Syntax in Paris, ‘or A Tour in Search of the Grotesque’ (1820) indicates that this is a spin-off from the hugely popular satires that spoofed the contemporary fad for the picturesque, but here the gullible doctor is a tourist in Paris, where Mrs Syntax has a fit of the vapours while visiting the tourist attraction of the catacombs.\n\nW. Combe, Dr Syntax in Paris (1820), ‘Dr Syntax visits the Catacombs’\n\nFor armchair travellers, or those who wanted a reminder of their time in Paris, there were books with plates of exceptional accomplishment and beauty. The Versailles, Paris and St Denis (1810) of John Claude Nattes, a French topographical draughtsman and water colour artist based in London until 1822, gives many insights into the topography and social history of Paris at the start of the nineteenth century.\n\nNattes is especially fond of views from under the bridges of Paris, allowing close-ups on ordinary activities from out of the ordinary perspectives.\n\nNattes, Versailles, Paris, ‘From under the arch of St Michel’s bridge’\n\nNattes, Versailles, Paris, ‘The washing place belonging to the Hospital of L’Hôtel Dieu’\n\nThis is a very much less spruce, polished and finished Paris than that of modern expectation and all the more interesting for that.\n\nNattes, Versailles, Paris, ‘From one of the arches of Notre Dame’\n\nNattes, Versailles, Paris, ‘View drawn from under the Arch of Givry’\n\nOther publications present the customs and costumes to be seen on Paris streets.\n\nA Tour through Paris (1828) does this in aquatints with particularly skilful and vibrant colouring.\n\nSams, A Tour through Paris (1828), ‘Dancers on Stilts in the Champs-Elysées’\n\nSams, A Tour through Paris, ‘The Office of Nurses’\n\nOne plate features the historic institution of the Office of Nurses (i.e. wet nurses). The English commentary tuts that ‘this is a market for human milk … where so many women are seen flocking with full breasts, in order to supply children to whom they are strangers’. What was founded by Louis XIV as a philanthropic project has been turned into a profitable business controlled by men. Nurses sleep in one large dormitory between the cradles of the two babies that each nurse sustains at any one time. A plate of itinerants on the boulevards includes, on the left, a dealer in tisane with his stove on his back, and a blind man with his dog. Another plate shows the ceremony in which disgraced soldiers are cashiered in the Place Vendôme.\n\nSams, A Tour through Paris, ‘Itinerants on the Boulevards’\n\nSams, A Tour through Paris, ‘Military Degradation in the Place Vendôme’\n\nBy 1839, in his Picturesque Architecture in Paris, Thomas Shotter Boys (1803-74) accomplishes an early triumph of lithography technique, achieving cool, transparent, graduated tints, subtle in colouring. King Louis Philippe sent Boys a ring in token of his admiration for this book.\n\nShotter Boys, Picturesque Architecture (1839), ‘Notre Dame’\n\nShotter Boys, Picturesque Architecture, ‘Hôtel de Cluny’\n\nThe image of Notre Dame is especially interesting in setting the cathedral in the same picture with buildings festooned with drying washing and with the banks of the Seine cluttered with everyday trade and activity. The image of the Hôtel de Cluny notes that it has ‘been recently bought by the French Government to preserve its remains as a national monument’.\n\nSimilarly subtle in colouring, the image of the Rue Notre Dame is a record of streets in the old Paris, long replaced (note the boots for sale outside a shop).\n\nShotter Boys, Picturesque Architecture, ‘Rue Notre Dame’\n\nShotter Boys, Picturesque Architecture, ‘St Etienne du Mont, with the Pantheon’\n\nThe plate of the Church of St Etienne du Mont and the Pantheon by moonlight is a rare attempt at a nocturnal cityscape, which inevitably seems to anticipate the later characterization of Paris as the ‘City of Light’.\n\nBarry Windeatt, Keeper of Rare Books\n\n31 July 2024\n\nAs I sit to write this blog entry, we are in the hottest spell so far this year. There is not a cloud in the sky and the weather is perfect for being outside or taking a dip in our refurbished swimming pool. Instead, I am in a hot office writing a garden blog.\n\nWe seem to have got through the height of the garden party season and navigated through the wedding season. Pressure is off a little now but that just means catching up on so many of the jobs we have been putting off. It really is hedging season now. It is usually best to wait until August to cut the hedging as many of the birds have flown the nests by this point. August is a great month for beech hedging. We have recently finished trimming the box hedging in New Court. It remains to be seen how many more times we can keep cutting this hedge as the box moth caterpillar damage seems to get a little worse each year. The next 12 months will be critical to how long we keep these hedges. It will be a massive shame to lose them, but we are one of the few college gardens who have not ripped theirs out yet. I fear it is only a matter of time.\n\nWe are entering the stage when our Garden Department apprentices have almost completed their time with us. Izzie Hare has just passed her final Level 2 Horticulture exam. This is a considerable achievement having only been with us for almost two years. Izzie will leave us at the end of August, and we are now looking to replace her with the next intern apprentice. Horticultural education is very important, and it was so pleasing to deliver what was promised and get Izzie at the point at which she can evolve in the industry as a professional gardener. We all wish her the very best of luck in the future and will miss her enormously.\n\nOur other trainee, Emily McCullen has also nearly finished her one-year placement with us. Emily leaves in early September, having completed her ‘Work and Retrain as a Gardener’ (WRAG) Scheme placement with us in the Emmanuel College gardens. Again, we are looking to recruit for the next WRAG Scheme placement. One year really does go fast. It only seems a matter of weeks ago that Emily started with us. At the time of writing, Emily has completed her RHS Level 2 qualification but has not had the results through. We have every confidence in her that she has passed. Again, we wish Emily all the best in the future.\n\nIn other news, we have almost completed the Community Garden. The social gardens have been transformed and will give students, staff and Fellows a wonderful space to work and grow in. It really is very exciting indeed. Watch this space for more news.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n31 July 2024\n\nL’Estrange family tombstones in the church of St Mary the Virgin, Old Hunstanton\n\nJohn Venn’s Alumni Cantabrigienses, the comprehensive listing of all known Cambridge University men, contains the following entry: Roger Lestrange. Matric pens. from Emman. Mich 1601. Son of Sir Nicholas (1580) and Mary Bell. Drowned ‘at Emmanuel’ while at Cambridge. Brother of Hamon (1601). (Blomfield, x. 115). The sensational statement that a student drowned here – presumably in the Paddock pond! – naturally begs investigation, but in fact the entire entry is open to question.\n\nThe L’Estrange family, anciently settled at Hunstanton Hall, Norfolk, sent many of its sons to Cambridge. Emmanuel’s admission register contains no record of Roger, though, because for some reason the names of the 1601 entrants were not entered. Coincidentally, the university matriculation books were not maintained during this period, either, due to the laxness of the Registrary, Thomas Smith. The lists of matriculands sent to Smith every year by the praelectors of each college have survived, though, and these record a ‘Roger Straunge’ matriculating from Emmanuel at Michaelmas 1601. His parentage is not stated.\n\nVenn’s identification of this Roger as the son of Sir Nicholas L’Estrange is presumably based on: (1) the fact that the family name was often spelled Straunge or Strange; (2) the perennial popularity of the name ‘Roger’ within the L’Estrange family; (3) information contained in Francis Blomfield’s History of the County of Norfolk, judging by the footnote. On inspection, however, it turns out that the L’Estrange section in that multi-volume tome does not mention Roger; indeed, it represents Sir Nicholas as having only one son: his heir, Hamon, who was admitted to Queens’ College in 1601.\n\nOther nineteenth-century printed histories and pedigrees, however, state that Sir Nicholas had three sons: Roger, Henry, and Hamon, the elder two dying without issue. One source adds that they died during their father’s lifetime, and that Hamon, in consequence, inherited the lordship of Hunstanton from his father upon the latter’s death. This version of events is supported by the usually reliable History of Parliament Online. A problem arises, then, because Sir Nicholas died in December 1591, a decade before Roger was admitted to Emmanuel. Unless the sources are wrong, and Roger and/or Henry were in fact younger brothers of Hamon, the ‘Roger Straunge’ admitted to Emmanuel in 1601 cannot have been the son of Sir Nicholas L’Estrange.\n\nRoger could, of course, have belonged to a cadet branch of the family, but whatever his standing, it is the case that none of the numerous L’Estrange memorials in Old Hunstanton church commemorates him. His dramatic demise is not recorded in Emmanuel’s archives, either. It was not until December 1913, when John Venn sent Emmanuel’s Bursar details of the intriguing entry he was preparing for Roger, that the college became aware of the young man’s existence. The Bursar forwarded the missive to the Master, with a jocular covering note: ‘Venn, supplementing our broken record for 1601, gives one Roger Straunge as admitted to Emmanuel in this year. Shall we drag the pond?’.\n\nVenn’s statement about Roger’s drowning ‘at Emmanuel’ is presented as a quotation, but of what, or whom, has proved impossible to trace. The source’s reliability cannot, therefore, be evaluated. Swimming had been strictly forbidden to Cambridge students by a Heads of House order of 1571, on pain of public whipping and (for a second offence) expulsion. If Roger Straunge voluntarily entered Emmanuel’s pond, then, it was in defiance of this decree. His true fate, like his identity, seems likely to remain a mystery.\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n26 June 2024\n\nAt last, the good weather has arrived. The endless weeks of rain and wind, together with the grey skies, are hopefully behind us, as we cling on to what now feels like summer. The Garden Department’s busiest times are hopefully just over the horizon too.\n\nIt can be a relentless few weeks, preparing for garden parties, May Ball preparations (and repairs) and graduations. Yes, the work is hard and the hours long. It is a time, however, to showcase the gardens to as many eyes as possible. I have received many fine comments about the beauty of the gardens this year. Of course, I am very grateful, but this is a team effort made up of many pairs of hands, both past and present. It has been a challenging growing season because of the weather but, I must admit, the gardens look splendid.\n\nI was working on this last Sunday, watering our plants (the sides that most people don’t see behind the scenes), and the peaceful nature of the site was at its best. Many students had gone home, and the gardens were still vibrant. The birds were my company and my morning’s soundtrack was enough to keep me enthused as I worked the weekend. This is the time I enjoy most in the gardens at Emmanuel. It almost feels like it’s my own garden at times like this. Just me, nature and the gardens. For those that are left here on site for the summer, please do enjoy the gardens in these quieter times. It is so good for one’s own mental health.\n\nMental health and gardening are always at the forefront of my thinking. Last week we had a soft launch of the new Emmanuel College Community Gardens. Although the project is not quite complete, it was nice to get together to celebrate our achievements so far. This will be a good stress reliever when the project reaches its final stages. It will give students, staff and Fellows a space within the college grounds that they can take ownership of. A place that they can nurture. A place that they can decide what to grow (and keep). A place that is non-hierarchical and a place to come together. A place to learn (through successes or failures). A place to contemplate. A place to share.\n\nThe community gardens will continue to be built over the remainder of the summer and will be fully functional from next academic year. There will be more correspondence over the next few weeks and months but please do get in contact with me with any questions you may have.\n\nThe rest of the summer will be made up of garden tours, continued maintenance and, later in the summer, we will turn our attention to recruiting the next cohort of training vacancies in the Garden Department. Emily will finish her one-year placement in September, and we are busy prepping Izzie for her end point assessments of the Cambridge University Apprenticeship in July. Izzie will remain with the Garden Department until December, drawing and ending her two-year placement. We also continue to support Danny Dudd with his work experience whilst studying his T Levels in Horticulture at Shuttleworth College.\n\nInvesting in the future of the next generation of gardeners is essential, giving career builders the next step in a fruitful (no pun intended!) career.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n26 June 2024\n\nD is for … Doves\n\nOur archives contain a series of title deeds recording the changes in ownership of the college site between 1545 (a few years after it had ceased to house the Dominican monastic order) and 1584, when Emmanuel College was founded. All these documents, in their recital of the premises’ appurtenances, include a reference to a dove-house. This building, of uncertain location, continued in use after 1584 as it served an important function: the provision of fresh meat throughout the year. The first reference to it in the college accounts is dated 1594, when 28s 7d was spent on ‘New tiling, lathing, and mending the duffhouse’. These renovations lasted a couple of decades, but thereafter the building required regular maintenance. In 1614 the college laid out 16s 10d on ‘Tyling, claying & mending the duvhouse’, and minor repairs were needed in 1621, 1628 and 1633. We know the building had fenestration, for in 1630 a shilling was spent on ‘2 new latices for the pigeon-house’ and in 1635 the ‘glasse’ had to be mended. Substantial improvements were required in 1636, when a builder named Rively and his labourer were paid 19s 6d for ‘9 dayes worke about the dovehouse’, and yet more repairs were carried out by the same builder two years later. Following the outbreak of the English Civil War, student numbers at Emmanuel shrank drastically and the dove-house was evidently abandoned, for it is not mentioned after 1638. In the late-nineteenth century a dovecote was set up in Chapman’s Garden, which at that date was only accessible via the set of Arthur Chapman, Fellow of Emmanuel from 1862 until his death in 1913. Populated with white fantails, Chapman’s picturesque dovecote features in several late-Victorian and Edwardian photographs.\n\nD is for … Dr Who\n\nOn Wednesday 17th October 1979, Emmanuel was briefly transmogrified into St Cedd’s College, Cambridge, an institution harbouring an incognito Time Lord named Professor Chronotis. This scenario sprang from the fertile imagination of the well-known sci-fi writer and Cambridge graduate Douglas Adams, who was at that time script editor for the Dr Who show. The 1979-80 college Magazine records, under Gifts and Bequests: ‘B.B.C. TV kindly donated £100 to the College following their successful filming of a Dr Who episode on College premises’. Unfortunately, no paperwork survives in the archives to indicate why, or how, Emmanuel was selected as a suitable location. The filming took place in Front and New Courts (exteriors only). The photograph reproduced above has been provided by Dr Alan Baker, Senior Tutor in 1979, who can be seen standing on the steps to C staircase. The Emmanuel students’ newsletter, under the headline ‘Dr Why?’, noted the ‘production of another epic Dr Who episode in the College grounds’, but queried why P3 had been selected as the Professor’s room, concluding: ‘Perhaps it was the rumour about frequent sightings of “alien” life forms and the strange knocking noises in the night’. Alas, many years were to pass before Emmanuel’s moment of glory was seen by the paying public, as a technicians’ strike prevented this particular Dr Who serial (‘Shada’), from being finished. Such footage as existed was eventually released on VHS, followed by, in 2017, a DVD version in which the missing sections had been completed using animation, dialogue being dubbed by the original cast. When the DVD was played to an audience in the Queen’s Building a few years ago, the advent of the ‘baddie’, clad in silver lamé and billowing white satin, provoked howls of laughter from undergraduates and nostalgic smiles from anyone ancient enough to remember the 1970s.\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n29 May 2024\n\nThe weather has continued to play havoc with the gardens in the last month. The wet weather continues, and the growing season is rapid. It seems like a period when we are chasing our own tails a bit. No sooner have we completed maintaining an area within college, it grows as your back is turned.\n\nThe last few weeks have been tricky. The quiet period for exams stops us doing exactly what we want to do in a time when the growing season keeps us on our toes the most. The good thing about the wet weather is at least we have not had to rush around watering the plants, trying to keep them alive.\n\nThe team has been stretched this year trying to complete some small projects, such as the landscaping for the swimming pool and the Community Garden. This has meant that it is all hands on deck at this time.\n\nAs gardeners, we must remind ourselves to enjoy the gardens too. We have been delighted with the planting beds around the new buildings this year. They have really started to establish themselves nicely and look as if the plants have been there for a while. It is exciting to see the plants fill out and give us such a good show. It is always a relief when this works, rather than just being an imagined idea.\n\nThe tennis courts on the Paddock have remained popular and it is nice to see so many people enjoying the gardens when the sun occasionally comes out.\n\nThe Community Garden building will continue after the quite period ends, and we will work at this across the remainder of the summer, so that the students can take full advantage from next academic year. It is an exciting prospect and I hope that the areas get some good use soon enough. There will be a trial for some hot composting bins in this area. This will give the students the opportunity to dispose of food waste such as vegetable peelings to be turned into compost. We have also installed water butts for rainwater harvesting, so we are looking at a greener approach to sustainable gardening.\n\nIt is also the time of year for starting to fill the borders from our own nurseries from the Garden Department. We do spend a lot of time and effort across the year taking cuttings and growing items from seed. It is great to be able to use our own plants to produce more. This cuts down on extra plastic use for pots, air miles for distances the plants must travel, and time taken to collect the plants off site. We use our own compost produced here in college to pot on the plants, so sustainably we feel we are heading in the right direction.\n\nThe meadows also look fantastic. The wildflowers are starting to really grow well, and we should get an excellent display this year. Some of the wildflowers in North Court have grown as a result from us harvesting the wildflower seeds from the bales of hay, donated to us from King’s College. Each bale of hay contains around 1.5kg of wildflower seed. This is another example of how working collegiately can benefit us all.\n\nAll we need now is some sunshine.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n29 May 2024\n\nC is for … Chaderton\n\nLaurence Chaderton, the first Master of Emmanuel, was a most remarkable man. His father Thomas, a minor landowner from Oldham, was a Roman Catholic, who cut off his son with the proverbial shilling when the young man embraced the Protestant faith. By the time Laurence became Master here, in 1584, he was one of the most renowned preachers of his day, possessing a ‘wonderful zeal for winning souls’. On one occasion, after a two-hour sermon, his enthralled congregation were said to have begged: ‘for God’s sake sir, go on!’. Sir Walter Mildmay thought so highly of him that his founding of Emmanuel College was contingent on Chaderton’s accepting the mastership. This he did, despite having received an offer of a more lucrative ecclesiastical appointment, and for 38 years he administered the college with ‘fidelity, prudence, and industry’. Even after relinquishing the mastership in 1622, when he was in his eighties, he continued to play an active role in college affairs. Widely respected and loved for his ‘active and fearless, and yet kindly and liberal’ spirit, Chaderton was sought out by many distinguished visitors to Cambridge, including King James I & VI and his son, Prince Charles. The King went further, by appointing him one of the authors of the 1611 Authorised Version of the Bible; he helped translate the section from 1 Chronicles to the Song of Solomon. Chaderton died in November 1640, at the great age of either 101 or 104 (he gave differing accounts of his year of birth, but either way his tombstone inscription is incorrect). According to his daughter, Elizabeth, he remained astonishingly robust until suffering the fall that brought on his death. He was buried in the original college chapel, and re-interred in the new one after its consecration in 1677.\n\nC is for … Chalice\n\nAbove the shop frontage of 21 St Andrew’s Street, Cambridge, directly opposite the junction with Emmanuel Street, a fine sculpted stone panel can be seen. It shows our college coat of arms, with the name ‘Emmanuel’ above and a carving of a goblet below, along with the words ‘The Chalice’. This tenement came to Emmanuel in 1585, one of several similar gifts and bequests bestowed upon the new college by generous benefactors. Most of these donors were what we would now call Puritans, who approved of the college’s founding ethos, but this was not the case with the owner of the Chalice. It was bequeathed to the college by Henry Harvey, Doctor of Laws, Master of Trinity Hall, Canon of Ely, and a prominent University man. In negotiating the political upheavals of the mid-sixteenth century, Harvey’s religious views embraced a degree of flexibility that the Vicar of Bray might have admired. As it seems unlikely, however, that he was ever a genuinely enthusiastic Puritan, his bequest of the Chalice to Emmanuel College would seem to be a mark of his personal regard for either Sir Walter Mildmay or Laurence Chaderton. All that can be said for certain, though, is that Doctor Harvey had helped with the complex legal procedures attaching to Mildmay’s acquisition of the college site in 1584. The title deeds to 21 St Andrew’s Street are held in our archives. They date back to 1295, but the earliest document in which the tenement is named ‘Chalice’ is a conveyance of 1578, which calls it a ‘messuage or ynne called the Challyce’. Later converted to a mixture of residential and retail occupancy, the property was completely rebuilt in 1895.\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n1 May 2024\n\nNew and Rare Beautiful-Leaved Plants (1870), ‘Rhapis flabelliformis’\n\nIn this country we like to think of ourselves as a nation of gardeners – by which we mean all those who busily and lovingly tend their town and suburban gardens, which are mostly modest in extent. But one, now largely forgotten, Victorian journalist and writer on horticulture had a key role in laying the foundations for this cult of small-scale ‘do-it-yourself’ gardening, and some of his many works are in Emmanuel’s collection of illustrated books.\n\nJames Shirley Hibberd (1825-1890) was born in Stepney, son of a sea-captain who had served under Nelson; he was apprenticed to a bookseller but moved into horticultural journalism, publishing as ‘Shirley Hibberd’. As he struggled to grow flowers, fruit and vegetables in his garden in Stoke Newington, despite the polluted, soot-laden London air, Shirley Hibberd noticed that the horticultural press of the day was directed at country house owners, their head gardeners, and the nursery men who supplied them. These professional garden writers ignored the possibility of gardening in towns and suburbs. By contrast, Shirley Hibberd saw gardening as open to all, and lambasted the Royal Horticultural Society for taking no account of the working-class amateur gardener. Shirley Hibberd saw a gap in the market for advice and self-help publications for amateur gardeners wanting to make something of their small urban gardens.\n\nFor this market Shirley Hibberd produced a stream of books and started three gardening magazines, including Amateur Gardening in 1884, which is still being published today. Titles included Rustic Adornments for Homes of Taste, The Rose Book, The Amateur’s Flower Garden. His The Fern Garden (1869) was particularly successful, promoting the Victorian predilection for these graceful plants. Other popular works included The Amateur’s Green House and Conservatory and Field Flowers, a month by month guide to the blooming of wild flowers.\n\nThe Fern Garden (1869), ‘Asplenium viride’\n\nThe Amateur Greenhouse (1880), ‘Begonia diversifolia’\n\nBeing self-taught himself, and unimpressed by experts, Shirley Hibberd was a natural at writing for amateur gardeners, soon becoming a household name and a leader of fashionable taste in the modest garden. Anticipating today’s TV gardeners, Shirley Hibberd drew on trial and error in the renovation of his own Stoke Newington garden to demonstrate for readers the creation of a rockery or a fern garden, or how to secure a succession of colour, or a succession of fresh fruit and vegetables in times before refrigeration. His advice was practical: for his amateur readership he did not recommend the Victorian craze for ‘carpet’ bedding of massed annuals – it was too expensive and labour-intensive – instead preferring herbaceous perennials and shrubs.\n\nIn several of his most striking publications Shirley Hibberd emphasized the beauty of foliage in its own right, although he saw gardens as essentially artificial creations and (unlike the inane modern fad) he had no wish to recreate a meadow inside a garden. His The Ivy: Its History, Uses and Characteristics (1872) was among the first to make a study of ivy and promote its beauty for garden use. Like other of his books, the binding and illustration aimed to match the beauty perceived in the subject.\n\nThe exquisite binding of ‘The Ivy’ (1872), and the title-page, showing an ivy-covered Conway Castle\n\nShirley Hibberd had himself collected 200 varieties of ivy.\n\nThe Ivy: Frontispiece showing five varieties of ivy, and a plate showing six further varieties\n\nIn his study of New and Rare Beautiful-Leaved Plants (1870) the 54 striking coloured plates do justice to their subject.\n\nBeautiful-Leaved Plants (1870), ‘Musa vittata’ and ‘Maranta illustris’\n\nTheir purpose is to inform and encourage the amateur gardener to experiment with new foliage effects in the urban garden.\n\nBeautiful-Leaved Plants, ‘Draecena terminalis’ and ‘Alocasia lowii’\n\nIn some of his enthusiasms Shirley Hibberd anticipates the present: he advocated a green belt around London; he fretted over the survival of wild flowers; he kept bees; he advocated systems whereby each household collected rainwater for domestic water supply; for a while he espoused vegetarianism (but lapsed). Apart from one surviving small park that he designed at Islington Green, all of Shirley Hibberd’s London gardens have been built over, but his legacy is the continuing and absorbing cult of amateur gardening in the modest plots gardened by most people.\n\nBarry Windeatt, Keeper of Rare Books\n\n30 April 2024\n\nAs I write this latest edition of my blog, the sun is shining and there is not a cloud in the sky. This feels like a welcome relief from the months and months of grey, wet weather that the Garden Department has had to endure. Reports say that there has not been a full dry week since September 2023. I can quite believe this. It has been the wettest period in my 35 years plus career. Let’s hope for a better late spring and summer.\n\nThe Garden Department has been extremely busy this year, more than ever. We have been trying to juggle several projects and still maintain the beautiful grounds that we are blessed to work in.\n\nOne of the largest projects that we are undertaking is the building of the new College Community Garden. These are being built at the rear gardens of Park Terrace, the idea being that this will become a non-hierarchical space to build a community of gardeners. The long-standing health benefits are widely reported and should help those that are wishing to undertake a gentle pastime to include growing vegetables and cut flowers.\n\nThe gardens will be available, within time, to the Emmanuel community, whether students, staff or Research Fellows staying with us. There will be a selection of raised beds along with composting solutions to help with food waste.\n\nIt is unfortunate that we must delay the building of this garden while the quiet period is on, along with the exams. We hope to have a soft launch towards the end of May, when some of the work will be complete. We will continue to build over the summer and should be up and running fully at the start of the new academic year.\n\nWe have also marked out two tennis courts on the Paddock. This sees the return of tennis to the Paddock after a break of at least four years due to building works. I have put only two courts up, specifically with the intention of an area to play a little light social tennis. They are to be used as a facility to relieve such pressures of exam stress and encourage students to get out of their rooms and take a short break. If serious tennis is required, then we have some fantastic facilities at the college sports ground on Wilberforce Road. Tennis bookings will soon be available to book via the college CASC booking system.\n\nThe rest of the gardens are really starting to come alive. The vegetation around the pond is growing fast, the mini meadows at the front gardens of Park Terrace are thriving, the spring meadows on the Paddock have been magnificent and the lawns are looking lush and green. Warmer weather is forecast this week so please get out and enjoy the gardens whenever you can.\n\nWe have been busy in the greenhouse growing plenty of seeds to be planted out later into the borders. The window boxes in Front Court will return in May too.\n\nKind regards.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n26 March 2024\n\nMayer, ‘Views’: Jerusalem, with the Church of the Holy Sepulchre\n\nIn Holy Week, thoughts turn to the Holy Land, and never more so than this year. Emmanuel’s collection of illustrated travel books from the late eighteenth and earlier nineteenth centuries contain only limited images of the area, which was just becoming an object of curiosity to more intrepid spirits, interested in travelling wider than Europe in search of the picturesque. The splendid exception is Views in Egypt, Palestine, and other parts of the Ottoman Empire (1804) by Luigi Mayer (1755-1803). Italian-born, of German ancestry, Mayer was commissioned by Sir Robert Ainslie Bt, British Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire (1776-1792), to record landmarks and landscapes throughout the Ottoman possessions. (Ainslie presented Mayer’s original paintings to the British Museum).\n\nAs the nineteenth century wore on, advances in communications and much improved opportunities for tourism resulted in an enormous increase in the numbers visiting the Holy Land. A special interest of Mayer’s ‘views’ is that they record some of the sites famous from Biblical accounts as they still were before this onslaught. Mayer presents the Holy Places in a picturesque dilapidation, as they had apparently remained during the long centuries of the Ottoman Empire’s decline.\n\nMayer’s street scenes in Jerusalem can thus appeal to the age’s much wider taste for the melancholy inspired by the prospect of ruins, as well as recording the current state of places mentioned in the Bible’s narrative of events in Holy Week.\n\nPillar to which was affixed the sentence passed on Our Saviour\n\nRemains of a Tower on Mount Zion\n\nFor Christian pilgrims to Jerusalem the most important site has always been the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, built over the site of Christ’s crucifixion on Mount Calvary. Inside the Church, pilgrims visited the site of the cross and the sepulchre, as well as the places where, it was believed, Christ was nailed to the cross and where his body was later anointed by Joseph of Arimathea and Nicodemus. Mayer’s views catch the gloom of these interiors, lit by candles.\n\nEntrance of the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre\n\nTomb of Joseph of Arimathea\n\nThis is also so of the reputed sepulchre of the Virgin Mary near the Garden of Gethsemane, over which a church had been erected by St Helena, mother of the Emperor Constantine. Pilgrims descended into the subterranean church to where the Virgin’s tomb stood in a chapel hewn out of the rock. Her tomb was venerated by local Muslims, who helped defray the cost of the eighteen lamps kept constantly burning in front of the Virgin’s tomb. Here, as in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, only the thresholds of the most sacred shrines are depicted.\n\nTomb of the Virgin Mary\n\nThe Pool of Bethesda, Jerusalem\n\nMuch less frequented was the Pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem, where Jesus bid a paralysed man ‘Rise, take up thy bed and walk’ and so he did (John 5: 8-9). At what was believed to be the site in Mayer’s day any springs of water had dried up and the site was overgrown.\n\nAt Bethany was the home of the sisters Martha and Mary, whose brother Lazarus Christ raised from the dead after four days (John 11: 1-45), a miracle that prefigured his own resurrection. Mayer also illustrates some subterranean tombs at Bethany, by implication the site of the miracle.\n\nThe Village of Bethany and the Dead Sea\n\nSepulchral Chamber near Bethany\n\nAlso illustrated are scenes at Bethlehem, where a church had been built over the supposed site of Jesus’ birth. There was a subterranean chapel of the Nativity, with a further chamber exhibiting the manger, along with a handy shelf upon which the Three Wise Men were believed to have deposited their gifts. A nearby cave contained a vault ‘where they say’ were buried the Holy Innocents, the children murdered by Herod. Also to be seen was the grotto ‘in which they report’ St Jerome remained for fifty years – rather understandably since he twice translated the Bible into Latin there.\n\nPrincipal Street of Bethlehem\n\nSubterranean Church of Bethlehem\n\nAs Mayer travels around sketching and painting, he also records ruins, reputedly from Old Testament times, in states of picturesque decay, such as the tomb that Absolom had reportedly built for himself, or the supposed tomb of Rachel, the wife of Jacob, although in his accompanying commentary Mayer sniffs that she was certainly never buried in a building so relatively modern.\n\nSepulchre of Absolom\n\nSepulchre of Rachel\n\nIn Mayer’s record of the picturesque, stones are tumbled and vegetation sprouts from ruins. Outside, vistas recede, while in dim interiors gleam spots of light in a religious glow. It is an intriguing snapshot through western eyes of places familiar from the Old and New Testaments at the end of the eighteenth century.\n\nBarry Windeatt, Keeper of Rare Books\n\nexplore Curiosity\n\n28 February 2024\n\nA curious public inspects the curiosities in the museum at Trinity College Dublin; W. B. Taylor, History of the University of Dublin (1819)\n\nEmma Connects has just passed its one hundredth edition since it was created in order to reach out to Emmanuel members during the isolation, and perhaps loneliness, of the first lockdown. Soon it will be four years since the first Rare Book blog appeared in April 2020, describing a book published in 1665, the year of the Great Plague, that recommended ‘It is advisable that all needless Concourses of People be prohibited …’ This is the sixty-fourth of these Rare Book blogs since that beginning, although they have barely scratched the surface of the College’s rare book collections. The positive outcome of what began prompted by adversity is that the interest and beauty of Emmanuel’s illustrated books – many now quite fragile to handle – can be appreciated by a much wider readership than ever before.\n\nWhat never ceases to impress is the sheer energy of curiosity represented by those who created these books and those who collected them. Two books written by intrepid women make this point. The title page of Narrative of a Residence at Tripoli in Africa (1816) gives the author as Richard Tully, but the introduction at once acknowledges that the memoir is that of his sister, recalling experiences from thirty years earlier, when Tully was the British Consul at Tripoli, and his young daughters grew up speaking Arabic and on terms of close friendship with the family of the Bashaw, or ruler, of Tripoli.\n\nMiss Tully, Narrative of a Residence at Tripoli: Officers of the Grand Seraglio Regaling\n\nFanny Parks published extensive journals of her time and travels in India as the wife of a British official in Wanderings of a Pilgrim in Search of the Picturesque, during four-and-twenty years in the East (1850), but in a self-effacing gesture her name appears on the otherwise-English title page only in Urdu script. She is a sympathetic admirer of Indian culture and customs, sometimes allowing herself to criticize such English ways as the legal position of married women.\n\nFanny Parks, Wanderings of a Pilgrim: Grass-Cutter and Gram-Grinder; A Bengali Woman\n\nThomas McKenney and James Hall’s, History of the Indian Tribes of North America (Philadelphia, 1848-50) was based on portraits commissioned by McKenney of Native Americans who came to Washington to negotiate treaties. McKenney was Superintendent of Indian Trade and hoped to preserve ‘whatever of the aboriginal man can be rescued from the destruction which awaits his race’. With the advantage of hindsight, it is hard not to see that doomed dignity in the solemn composure of these portraits.\n\nMcKenney and Hall, History of the Indian Tribes: An Osage Woman; A Chippewey Chief\n\nBut the customs and costumes of countries much closer to home might prompt just as much curiosity. Both A Sporting Tour through France (1805) by Colonel Thornton and Sketches in Flanders and Holland (1816) by Robert Hills find space, in books largely devoted to views of landscape and architecture, to include studies of figures in local costume in the Low Countries or engaged in their trades on the streets of Paris.\n\nThornton, A Sporting Tour: (clockwise) Itinerant Musicians, Shoe Black, Washerwomen, Hot Chestnut Seller\n\nHills, Sketches in Flanders\n\nThere are also a wealth of illustrated books presenting a wry, serio-comic take on the life of the well-to-do, which often includes a spell at university (more usually Oxford than Cambridge), where comic misdemeanours can be illustrated, as in this plate drawn and engraved by Robert Cruikshank, showing an undergraduate hoisting a ‘fair nun of St Clement’s’ up to his room in a basket, only to succeed in dropping her on to a passing proctor. (He is sent down).\n\nWilliam Westmacott, English Spy: ‘Oxford Bull-Dogs detecting brazen smuggling’\n\nW. Sams, The Tournament\n\nSuch illustrations perhaps appeal both to the curiosity of those who haven’t been to college and to the nostalgia of those who have. A new nostalgia is also stirring for a re-imagined version of a ‘Gothick’ medieval past where valiant knights rescue swooning damsels from unwelcome oppressors, as in the illustrations to a truly dreadful book-length poem, The Tournament, or, Days of Chivalry (1823).\n\nAnother spur to curiosity for illustrated books probably lay in how so many of the early readers of such illustrated books – both men and women – will themselves have been taught to draw and paint as part of a polite education. Many of the flower books in the College’s collection present both a coloured and uncoloured version of each flower, with the latter available to be coloured by the owner.\n\nMiss J. Smith, Studies of Flowers from Nature: ‘Dahlia’ coloured and uncoloured versions\n\nSuch books are directed at purchasers who may well have had a trained eye for painting in water colours every sort of subject from flora and fauna, but especially flowers and birds.\n\nThomas Martyn, Aranei; or A Natural History of Spiders (1793), frontispiece\n\nEdouard Travies, Les Oiseaux: scenes varies, etudes a l’aquarelle (1857): Bird of paradise\n\nCuriosity goes along with innovation in the superb illustrations of clansmen in their tartans in McIan’s The Clans of the Scottish Highlands, 2 vols. (1845-57).\n\nR.R. McIan, Clans of the Scottish Highlands: ‘Sutherland’, and Frontispiece to Volume 2\n\nFor although the pictures of clansmen are hand-coloured lithographs, the two magnificent heraldic title pages are successful early examples of colour printing. ‘Printed in colors’ (sic) it says modestly in very small type at the foot of the page, but this is part of a transition to a whole new future in the production of illustrated books.\n\nBarry Windeatt, Keeper of Rare Books\n\n28 February 2024\n\nFebruary has almost gone. Most of it was disrupted by the rain again, with just the odd exception in the form of a sunny break in the clouds. I think 2023 and the start of 2024 is one of the dampest gardening seasons that I can remember in 30+ years of gardening. For some, it has been a welcome spell compared with the previous seasons’ long hot spell. I suppose that, as a gardener, you must be careful what you wish for. On the plus side, the temperatures have been on the mild side. There have been good signs of early spring growth. We have even had to make an early start to our grass cutting schedule as the grass has put on significant growth.\n\nFebruary is always a busy month in the Emmanuel gardens. It is the phase where we are preparing for the coming seasons ahead. We have been busy maintaining all the college benches during the wet spells. Every year there seem to be more benches to maintain as, unfortunately, the number of memorials has not slowed down.\n\nIt is also time to start repairing some of the many pathways throughout college as they get worn and damaged through the winter periods. The Garden Team have been busy making a start on these repairs.\n\nThis task has been made a little easier this year due to the garden department’s latest addition. The department welcomes Martin Place to join our fantastic team. Martin joins us as our Landscape Gardener and has brought with him his 25+ years of invaluable experience. Prior to joining Emmanuel, Martin had been proprietor of Saunders Landscapes, which had an excellent reputation in the industry. We will tap into Martin’s skills to help upscale the rest of the garden staff.\n\nMartin will be very busy in the next few months as we have lots of exciting projects on the horizon. I am delighted to announce that, after many months of hard work and an untimely delay, we have eventually had confirmation of the funding required for the Emmanuel College Community Garden. We will be shortly making a start on the building of this, with hopefully some of it being ready to use this year.\n\nWe are also busy trying to re-landscape the swimming pool area after several months of construction left the grounds in a bit of a mess.\n\nOver the next few months, the Gardening Department will be collaborating much more with the college sports ground. I am keen to work with our excellent Groundsman, Mark Robinson, in a closer partnership, which I think will benefit both the sports ground and Emmanuel gardens. I am keen for college sport to return to its pre-Covid days and will be working with Mark to ensure we are heading in the right direction.\n\nThe Emmanuel gardens themselves are starting to wake up. The earliest signs of spring bulbs are poking through. It always gives us gardeners a sign of hope for warmer days to come.\n\nIn March (on Monday 11th), we are delighted to welcome Charles Dowding back to his old college to give us a Masterclass and an evening talk regarding his now famous ‘No Dig’ philosophy. It’s not every day a celebrity horticulturist comes to Emmanuel, so the department are very excited. There are just a few spaces left if you want to join us. Booking is through Emma Experience and Daniel McKay.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n28 February 2024\n\nThe London Overground map is undergoing a revamp. Its wandering orange lines will be replaced by new colours and names denoting the six segments that make up the system. The route between Stratford and Clapham Junction/Richmond has been designated the ‘Mildmay Line’, sparking considerable interest among Emma Members.\n\nThe route’s name commemorates the Mildmay Mission Hospital, founded in 1877. Since 1988, it has been a specialist centre for patients with HIV. The hospital was one of many charitable organisations set up by Canon William Pennefather and his wife Catherine, who lived in an area of Newington Green known locally as the Mildmay estate. This quarter had been developed for housing in the mid-nineteenth century, and the ubiquity of ‘Mildmay’ in the resulting nomenclature – Street, Road, Avenue, Grove, Park – is a sure indication that the land had formerly belonged to a family of that name.\n\nHenry Mildmay’s signature in the college admission book; Thomas Mildmay, admitted on the same day, was his cousin\n\nHenry Mildmay, born c.1594, was a grandson of Emmanuel’s Founder, Sir Walter Mildmay. Admitted to Emmanuel in 1610, he continued to take an interest in college affairs after graduating. In 1627, for example, he opposed the royal mandate suspending the unpopular De mora statute that forced Emmanuel Fellows to leave after ten years and become beneficed clergymen. Henry offered to present the college with ‘five or six’ benefices to which its Fellows could be appointed, on condition that the suspension was revoked. The King agreed, but cannily insisted that the college got the benefices first. Henry failed to deliver.\n\nKnighted in 1617, Sir Henry was MP for Maldon from 1621 and held several important official posts, including Master of the King’s Jewel House. His rapacity regarding the perks of office was notorious. Originally a royalist, he switched allegiance during the Civil War and attended Charles I’s trial, although he stopped short of signing the King’s death warrant. He was nevertheless sentenced to life imprisonment at the Restoration; his estates were forfeit, and he was exiled to Tangiers, where he died in 1668. Given his cupidity, Sir Henry had naturally sought a wealthy bride. The lucky lady was Anne, daughter and co-heiress, with her sister Margaret, of William Halliday, a vastly wealthy London alderman. Henry enlisted the help of the King, no less, to coerce the girl’s suspicious father into permitting the betrothal, which took place in 1619.\n\nWilliam Halliday had a house and copyhold estate in the village of Newington Green, and it was this property that became known as the Mildmay estate. Exactly when the Mildmays acquired full possession of the land is unclear. Sources state variously that it was after Halliday’s death (1624), or his widow’s death (1646), or Anne Halliday’s death (1657). The estate had presumably been divided between the sisters, as Margaret Halliday bequeathed her Newington copyholds to her nephew, Henry Mildmay junior, in 1673.\n\nHenry Mildmay junior’s admonition for ‘striking of Clerk’ (either John Clarke or Samuel Clarke, sizars)\n\nHenry junior followed his father to Emmanuel, being admitted in 1651. The apple may not have fallen far from the tree, as he was ‘admonished’ in December 1652 for hitting another student (the only founder’s kin to receive this formal censure) and was later accused by his elder brother William of having cheated him out of his inheritance. The Mildmay estate in Newington remained in the hands of Henry junior’s descendants until its sale in the late 1850s.\n\nSurviving documentation suggests that, against all the odds, the marriage between Sir Henry Mildmay and his ‘so good a wife’ Anne Halliday was a happy one. Parents to six children, they founded their own ‘Mildmay line’, and gave their name to a little corner of north London. Something to ponder when rattling between Dalston Kingsland and Canonbury…\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n31 January 2024\n\nJanuary has come around fast and the Christmas holidays seem a distant memory. On returning to work, we had to pick up where we left off and the first job back always means recycling the Christmas trees. The season’s unfavourable weather also continued with what has seemed like one named storm after another, after another and another. The Garden Department longs for some spring-like days and some apricity from the winter sun.\n\nUnfortunately, just before Christmas, the department had to say goodbye and good luck to one of our staff members, Andrew Luetchford. We wish Andrew the best and thank him for all his hard work, but also look forward to recruiting and welcoming someone new. Watch this space.\n\nThe myth that gardeners are not busy in the gardens at this time of year could not be further from the truth. There are multiple tasks that need completing in the winter months – a long list of pruning schedules that roll out almost until the spring. It is a time for pruning and tying in the climbers, such as wisteria and climbing roses, and with the help of the Maintenance Department, we added brand new climbing supports to our new buildings. The supports look great and will give good support to the climbing plants on those buildings to help soften the landscape.\n\nWhen the sun does shine in the winter, it enhances the beautiful fragrances from some of our winter shrubs. Some of the highlights come from the winter border in the Fellows’ Garden. The colours and fragrances at this time of year can be wonderful, including the Chimonanthus praecox (Wintersweet), Hamamelis (Witch hazel) and the winter flowering Viburnums (Viburnum x bodnantense). The smell from the Sarcococcas (Sweet box or Christmas box) can be heavenly as you brush past them.\n\nIt is also a time to start to work our way through preparing the herbaceous borders. The foliage is left as long as possible to provide some winter protection for the insects, but there must be a systematic plan as we go forward to manage the borders. A comprehensive approach through mass and void analysis helps determine which plants we need to be split and divided through the season, and if indeed any replacements are required.\n\nOnce the borders are managed then mulching can begin to take place and adding a rich organic matter to the borders will help replace spent nutrients, lock in moisture and help with weed suppressing as the soil temperatures rise. This is a good practice annually and most of the mulch will come from our home-grown compost.\n\nSomething to look forward to this year is the college spending some time with celebrity gardener Charles Dowding. Charles is an Emma alumnus and is infamous for his ‘no dig’ theories. Charles will be visiting the college on 11th March and giving a talk in the Queen’s Theatre – this is something that has got the Garden Department very excited. Look out for more information about this shortly.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n31 January 2024\n\nR. Ackermann, History of the University of Cambridge (1815), ‘Pembroke Hall etc., from a window at Peterhouse’\n\nVisitors viewing the richly illustrated books in Emmanuel’s Graham Watson Collection often wonder why such a flowering of hand-coloured books and prints occurs in Britain at this time, roughly the first three decades of the nineteenth century. Breakthroughs in the technical processes of aquatint and lithography are the key contributing factor. But another major influence was the entrepreneurial genius of Rudolph Ackermann (1764-1834), a passionately Anglophile German immigrant publisher. His publication of a series of lavishly illustrated histories of Oxford, of Cambridge, and of historic public schools, were shrewdly pitched to appeal to an elite market among their alumni, but they were also so beautiful that they continue to shape perceptions of those places.\n\nR. Ackermann, History of the University of Oxford (1814), ‘View of Oxford, taken from New College Tower’\n\n‘Oxford, High Street, Looking West’\n\nAfter an early career as a coach-builder and designer in Germany, Ackermann arrived in London in 1787, initially to pursue the same business. But by 1797 Ackermann had opened ‘The Repository of Arts’, a shop in the Strand famous in its day for pictures, prints, illustrated books, as well as paper, paints and artists’ materials aimed at the burgeoning market of amateur artists. These elegant premises became a fashionable haunt for those who wanted to be seen to have sophisticated tastes, not only in art but in fashion and décor. Tea and lectures were available. From 1809 Ackerman published a monthly magazine, The Repository of Arts, Literature, Commerce, Manufactures, Fashion and Politics, full of articles and illustrations of fashion, furniture and social news. During its twenty-year run, The Repository published over 1400 hand-coloured plates. The fashion plates, sometimes with dress-making patterns, were immensely influential on women readers.\n\nFrom publishing prints there was a logic in Ackermann’s move into publishing illustrated books, such as his sumptuous three-volume Microcosm of London (1808-1810), containing 104 hand-coloured aquatints, with outside and inside scenes of London landmarks and institutions. The plates are often revealing of current social practices, such as visitors to an exhibition of watercolours, or a ‘speech day’ event at the Blue Coat School, where two scholars – known as ‘Grecians’ and destined for Oxford or Cambridge – were required to recite orations ‘in praise of this institution, one in Latin and the other in English’.\n\nMicrocosm of London (1808-1810), ‘Exhibition of the Society of Painters in Water Colour, Old Bond Street’\n\nMicrocosm, ‘The Great Hall, The Blue Coat School’\n\nLike the Microcosm of London, Ackermann’s history of the public schools has a profusion of plates highlighting picturesque views of ancient buildings, so it is valuable that just one plate for each school actually provides a record of the educational process in these institutions, and a surprising one to modern eyes in terms of ‘class size’.\n\nHistory of the Colleges of Winchester etc. (1816), ‘Eton College, School Hall’\n\n‘The Merchant Taylors’ School Room’\n\nIn each of the schools, the plates show instruction of large groups of pupils by a number of teachers taking place within one very large, hall-like room. The competing noise must have been both a distraction and perhaps a training in concentration.\n\n‘Harrow School Room’\n\nHistory of Rugby School (1816), ‘Great School Room’\n\nWith a sixth sense for trends, Ackermann also catered to the fashionable taste for appreciation of picturesque scenery, and for books that allowed the armchair traveller to view landscapes with picturesque qualities and their inhabitants (including the clans of the Highlands). He published armchair tours of the picturesque beauties of the Rhine, and the Seine, and the coast of Ireland.\n\nA Picturesque Tour of the Seine (1821), ‘Andeli’\n\nIllustrations of the Landscape and Coastal Scenery of Ireland (1835), ‘Gap of Dunloe, Killarney’\n\nFurther afield, Ackerman published a picturesque tour of the Ganges, and a history of Madeira with delightfully quirky illustrations.\n\nA Picturesque Tour along the Rivers Ganges and Jumna (1824)\n\nA History of Madeira (1821), Getting about on Madeira by Hammock-Mobile\n\nIn none of these books were the texts written, or the illustrations drawn, engraved or coloured by Ackerman himself, but he employed the best artists and engravers of the day. This included publishing the cutting political and satirical caricatures of Thomas Rowlandson, as well as the more fastidious genius of Augustus Pugin, whose book of idiosyncratic designs for furniture in the ‘Gothick’ taste was published by Ackermann. Always the innovator, Ackermann’s shop on the Strand was illuminated by gas lighting, on which Ackermann published a book, and his own promotion of gas lighting furthered its wider acceptance at the time.\n\nAugustus Pugin, Gothic Furniture, ‘Gothic Bed’\n\nF. Accum, A Practical Treatise on Gas-Lighting (1816), illustrating gas-lighting machinery\n\nHe expanded into Latin America, where he supported the liberation movements, and published 100 books in Spanish (but this proved unprofitable and he burned his fingers). Perhaps akin to an obsession with cars in modern times, Ackermann’s engagement with carriage design never left him: in one year he designed both the carriage in which the Pope rode to Napoleon’s self-coronation as Emperor, and the elaborate hearse and the emblems on the coffin for the state funeral of Admiral Lord Nelson. With his inventiveness, his eye for design, and his sheer flair for business, Ackermann may be seen as a pioneer of modern publishing and illustration – and the fruits of that can be seen in the illustrated books in Emmanuel’s Graham Watson Collection that Ackermann and others published.\n\nBarry Windeatt, Keeper of Rare Books\n\nImages: Clare Chippindale\n\n31 January 2024\n\nA snowy scene on the Cam in 1955, featuring the Emmanuel 3rd Boat\n\nThe recent blog featuring a photo of the Paddock after the Whitsun snowfall of 1891, prompted John Harding to recall the even more unseasonal snowstorm that swept over Cambridge in the first week of June, 1976. This event was fixed in his memory as he was due to perform in outdoor theatricals at Clare College. It was a case of ‘the show must go on’, despite the perishing cold and consequent meagre (but not, as the cast had hoped, completely non-existent) audiences.\n\nFor Cambridge students, snow and ice caused only the usual problems before the mid-nineteenth century: travel difficulties and the risk of catching chills. Once sport became a feature of student life, however, a new dimension of anxiety was born. The Emmanuel College Magazine, which began in 1889, contains annual reports from the Emma sporting clubs, many of them lamenting the effects of icy weather. In Lent Term 1898, for instance, rain and sleet blighted an athletics club fixture involving Hertford College, Oxford, and a similar competition against Brasenose in 1906 had to be cancelled altogether ‘owing to snow’.\n\nRowing was perhaps the sport most vulnerable to severe winter weather. The Emmanuel boat club report for Lent Term 1895 informed readers that after the Cam had frozen in early February, no rowing was possible for a ‘full fortnight’ and the bumps were subsequently cancelled. The weather in Lent Term 1910 was equally frigid, as noted in the diary of Winthrop Bell, a graduate student from Nova Scotia, who rowed in the college’s 2nd boat. He paints a vivid picture of the miseries, and in his case, dangerous consequences, of winter boating. In late January the oars were ‘frozen’ and there was ‘Ice on river – solid below Ditton’. The weather continued ‘wretched’, and in February Winthrop developed pleurisy. After having several pints of fluid drained from his lungs, a ‘rather nasty job’, he quit Cambridge on medical advice, and transferred to a German university.\n\nSkating on the Paddock pond, January 1926\n\nThe silver lining of sub-zero temperatures, of course, is that ice-skating becomes possible. A photo showing skaters on the Paddock pond in January 1926 would give a modern health & safety officer a conniption, as Emmanuel’s resident pair of swans (who no doubt took a dim view of the proceedings) can be seen swimming on open water near the pond outfall, an indication that the ice was not very thick. Another patch of slushy water is visible against the northern bank, with sweepers standing perilously close. The ‘severe frost’ that produced these conditions prevented any rowing practice and curtailed the Emmanuel golf club’s activities, as noted in the Magazine. A cold snap in 1942 resulted in stretches of water at the Milton sewage works freezing solid. This attracted many keen skaters, including Charles Gimingham, a first year-Nat Sci student at Emmanuel, who recorded in his diary for 17 January: ‘…grand piece of ice…hundreds of people - but room for them all. Major crisis when one’s skates heel slipped and I bust a bolt fitting it - But half hour experimentation on the bank fixed it and the rest was grand.’\n\nIce on the pond, 1981-2, © Sarah Gill\n\nA spell of bad weather towards the end of Michaelmas Term 1980 forced the boat club crews to row during ‘blizzards’ while competing in the Clare Novices. The winter of 1981-82 was much worse, and it is very surprising that the sporting clubs’ reports in the Magazine make no mention of the prolonged snowy and icy conditions. An atmospheric photograph taken that winter by Sarah Gill (née Doole), shows several people skating, or at any rate shuffling, on the frozen Paddock pond at dusk.\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n20 December 2023\n\nIn some fascinating Victorian scrap-books kindly presented to Emmanuel Library by Hugh Pearson (matric. 1987) there are mementos of travels in the form of prints of stately homes (Chatsworth, Goodwood, Lowther, Trentham) and of various foreign resorts (in France, Italy, the Rhine) that have been carefully stuck on to the album pages. There is also a collection of recipes that rather implies the compiler’s single-minded devotion to the traditional British pudding and its tastes and ingredients (with never a mention of chocolate). And there are Christmas and New Year cards, probably from the 1870s onwards, arranged and fastened on the scrapbook pages. All these cards are modest in size (often 10 x 8 cms), on a single flimsy piece of paper: they are not folded cards that stand up. There was a fashion for these greetings to be surrounded by paper borders pierced and patterned to resemble lace.\n\nThe familiar iconography of Christmas is already established here. There are snowscapes bristling with holly and holly berries, and robins are ubiquitous and unavoidable.\n\nSo much of this is still going strong today, and it is usually claimed that it was the Prince Consort who, by introducing various German Christmas customs into the Royal Family’s Christmas, thereby caused those customs to become fashionable, imitated, and duly established in the British Christmas. Those readers of this Victorian scrapbook who enjoyed looking back over the collection of past Christmas cards might also enjoy the ‘Prince Albert Pudding’ for which the album supplies a recipe. Note that, like many of the pudding recipes compiled in the scrapbook, this does entail a serious amount of boiling.\n\nPrince Albert Pudding\n\n½lb (half a pound) of flour; ½lb of butter; beat up well ½lb of loaf sugar sifted, ½lb of raisins chopped fine, 5 eggs, the whites whipped to a stiff froth, a little candied lemon peel.\n\nSteam it 3 hours. Served up with custard sauce.\n\nSome of the Christmas and New Year cards largely consist of some lines of rhymed seasonal greetings, with the text displayed in an ornamental border. The greetings tend to the earnest and uneffusive.\n\nThose high-minded Victorians who sent and appreciated receiving such greetings cards might also appreciate the sobering implications of ‘Half-Pay Pudding’, for which the scrapbook’s recipe rules out all light nonsense but the essentials.\n\nHalf-Pay Pudding\n\n¼lb of raisins, ¼lb of currants, ¼lb of chopped suet, ¼lb of flour, ¼lb of breadcrumbs, ¼lb of sugar. Pinch of salt. Without eggs. Boil for 4 hours.\n\nMany cards feature a lift-up flap, where part of the design is hinged to lift up and reveal a Christmas or New Year greeting printed underneath.\n\nBut at least in the selection preserved by this scrapbook, references to the Christian significance of Christmas are understated or absent altogether, and this example is an exception.\n\nThe figure of the evangelist, holding book and quill, lifts up to reveal underneath an intricate design of text and ornament, where the Gospel text of the message from the angels (above) to the shepherds (below) appears in red text on ribbons woven clockwise into the design. The makers of this scrapbook who also preserved a recipe for ‘Paradise Pudding’ seem intent on catering to a more material experience of heavenly sweetness.\n\nParadise Pudding\n\nSix oz (ounces) of breadcrumbs, six oz of sugar, six oz of currants, six apples grated, six oz of butter beaten to a cream, six eggs, a little lemon peel chopped, and nutmeg.\n\nBoil in a shape, 3 hours. Serve with wine sauce.\n\nAs with Christmas cards today, depictions of wintry scenes on Victorian cards are implicitly celebrating Christmas as a refuge and respite from mid-winter cold, as in this sentimental snow-scene of small children warming themselves around a rustic’s blazing fire – a flap is hinged to lift up and reveal a Christmas greeting underneath.\n\nFeasting at mid-winter on rich foods was a traditional defiance of the time of least light, most gloom, and dismal cold. The scrapbook includes no fewer than three different recipes for Christmas pudding, attributed to Mrs Bond, Mrs Fendall, and Mrs Sutton.\n\nMrs Sutton’s Christmas Pudding 1879\n\nChop very fine, 1½lb of suet, 2lb of raisins, 1lb of currants; 1lb of flour; ½lb of mixed peel; ½lb of moist sugar; ¼lb of breadcrumbs; 2 Captain biscuits grated; 1 rind of lemon grated; 1 tablespoon of mixed spice; 1 teaspoon of salt; 6 eggs. Mix with ½ pint of milk and a large glass of brandy. Boil for 6 hours.\n\nThere are predictably different twists on ingredients and quantities, with Mrs Fendall adding sultanas, chopped apples, orange peel, chopped almonds and making it two glasses of brandy as well as one of sherry. The recipes also differ over their recommended boiling times, which range between five and eight hours.\n\nOne curious aspect to us of these Victorian greeting cards is that there are almost as many New Year cards as Christmas cards in the collection – whereas sending a separate New Year card has become rather unusual – and that so many of the cards are not ‘Christmassy’ at all but feature posies of flowers.\n\nBut there was a whole language of meanings expressed through flowers and depictions of flowers, a language now barely remembered. The readers of this scrapbook who enjoyed the sweet confection of ‘Princess Louise Pudding’ would not have been aware of the venturesome extramarital love-life of Queen Victoria’s artist daughter, Princess Louise.\n\nPrincess Louise Pudding\n\n1 pint of milk poured over ½ pint of grated bread, the rind of a lemon grated; 3 oz of sugar; the yolks of 2 eggs well beaten. Mix all well & bake in a pie dish for ¾ of an hour, then cover the top with a thin layer of jam. Whisk the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth with 3 oz of powdered loaf sugar, and the juice of ½ the lemon, and put over the jam. Bake 5 minutes.\n\nBut they evidently enjoyed the scrapbook page where a rose on a hinged flap lifts up to reveal the ringleted sweetheart underneath.\n\nThe verse below reads: I wish I were a little bee, | To improve each shining hour. | I’d gather HONEY all the day | From such an … opening flower’.\n\nA merry Christmas and a happy new year to all our readers! Very best wishes also to Dr Helen Carron, who has produced all the images for these blogs since their inception during the first lockdown, and who retires this month as College Librarian after 26 years of devoted service to the College Library and to generations of its student users.\n\nBarry Windeatt, Keeper of Rare Books\n\n20 December 2023\n\nView of the College Gardens, 1891\n\nThis intriguing photograph, showing the Paddock under a fairly substantial dusting of snow, bears a one-word endorsement: ‘1891’. It might be supposed, then, that it was taken either in the very cold January of that year, or else in early March, when many parts of England suffered exceptionally severe blizzards. On closer inspection, it is apparent that the photo must date from much later in the year.\n\nFor one thing, the striped lawn indicates very recent mowing, which is not a normal feature of winter or early spring horticulture. For another, several circular beds of flowering tulips are visible. The deciduous tree to the left of the pond, moreover, is in full leaf, accompanied by what looks like blossom. A 1937 tree-plan of the college grounds identifies it as a horse chestnut, which normally flowers in May. True, the elms in front of the Hostel are still bare, but that tree comes into leaf rather late.\n\nMeteorological records show that after an extremely warm spell in early May 1891, a sudden and dramatic change in the weather pattern resulted in snow and hailstorms afflicting much of the country on the 17th of that month (Whit Sunday). On the following day, eastern England experienced a particularly heavy fall of snow, some parts of Norfolk having as much as seven inches. A thaw set in within a day or two, so it can be safely assumed that this snowy photo of the Paddock was taken during the Whitsun weekend. The college sporting clubs’ reports in the 1891 Magazine make no mention of the mid-May snowfall, doubtless because of its brevity, but they do record that no rowing or football had been possible for much of January, ‘owing to the long spell of frost’.\n\nThe ‘Whitsun’ photographer may well have been Alfred Rose, Emmanuel’s Bursar, who was an enthusiastic amateur snapper. His plate-glass negatives, which are an invaluable visual record of the late-Victorian and Edwardian college, are preserved in the college archives. The photo is evidence that the freak Whitsuntide weather had taken Emmanuel’s residents by surprise, as many of the Hostel windows are wide open. Incidentally, the building adjoining the Hostel was the remaining portion of the straggling range of stables and outbuildings, including a coach house, that had for many years run along the college’s eastern boundary. The single-storey gabled projection is marked as ‘Engine’ on a plan of the college dated 1885, so it was presumably a boiler house; a coal yard was situated nearby. This building and the rest of the outhouses were all demolished in 1893, when the Hostel was extended.\n\nIt is interesting to note the steep drop of the ornate iron palings into the western end of the pond. Unlike the railings that ran along the Front Slips, they were not sacrificed to the war effort in the 1940s but remained in situ for another decade. The high fencing beside the path on the right of the pond is probably designed to deflect tennis balls, as the southern part of the Paddock was always marked out for lawn tennis in Easter Term. The protection provided by the fence was no doubt appreciated by the pair of swans that were the pond’s most important residents. The small white shape that can be seen near the pond outfall may be one of these birds. The monkey-puzzle tree, near the chapel, although appearing to be a youngish specimen in 1891, does not appear on the 1937 tree-plan, and the horse-chestnut tree, mentioned earlier, was felled in 1952. The fate of the elms needs no elaboration.\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n30 November 2023\n\nRobert Fuller signs for his final salary payment, October 1727\n\nEmmanuel is almost unique among Cambridge colleges in having in its archives a disciplinary, or ‘admonition’ book, dating from the earliest days of the college. Most of the miscreants who feature in it are students, but two entries involve a college Fellow, the Revd Robert Fuller.\n\nA native of King’s Lynn, Fuller was a graduate and, from 1719, Fellow of Emmanuel. He was ordained four years later. The first intimation of his contrariness is an entry in the admonition book dated 24th August 1725: Mr Fuller, Sen[ior] Fellow, & Dean of the College was Admonish’d by the Master in the presence of all the Fellows then in College for great offences that he was guilty of’. While it is startling to see a formal censure being applied to a member of the fellowship, the fact that Fuller was also dean does not exacerbate the scandal, as the office was held in annual rotation by Fellows who were in holy orders.\n\nWhat might Fuller’s unspecified offences have been? He was frequently absent from college, as the exeat book attests, although his trips were generally of short duration. In the early years of his fellowship he preached regularly at Holy Communion services in Emmanuel’s chapel, but ceased to do so in May 1725 - doubtless evidence of a deteriorating situation. In February 1726, six months after Fuller’s first admonition, the college passed an order that ‘whoever misses his turn of visiting as appointed by the Dean shall forfeit the sum of five shillings to be deducted out of his stipend… and applied to the use of the Poors Bag’. Two months later, Fuller was fined under the terms of this somewhat opaque order.\n\nMatters finally came to a head on 11 November 1726, when Fuller was summoned to ‘appear before the Master & Senior Fellows & Dean, and the Master proceeded to Admonish him for his irregular behavior & notorious neglect of duty. Upon this Admonition, he behav’d himself in a very insolent outrageous manner: & upon the Master’s testimony that he admonished him according to the direction of the statutes; he reply’d A fart for your Admonition & used other contemptuous language’.\n\nFollowing this unedifying scene, Fuller appears to have gone out of residence almost immediately. The college statutes laid down that a Fellow could be deprived of his office after two (unheeded) admonitions, but in the event Fuller jumped before he could be pushed. A curt entry in the exeat book records that in June 1727 his name was ‘cut out’, a marginal note adding: ‘Marry’d June 11th 1727’. As Fellowships were forfeited upon marriage, Fuller’s college career was thus abruptly terminated. He returned to Emmanuel to collect his final instalment of wages at the Michaelmas 1727 audit, and doubtless never set foot in the place again.\n\nRobert Fuller’s armigerous gravestone\n\nWhat Fuller did for the next few years is unknown, but in June 1732 he was appointed Rector of Water Newton, Huntingdonshire. He died there some three years later, aged 39, and was buried in the chancel of the church. His gravestone records that he was formerly a Fellow of Emmanuel. Jane, his widow, shares his grave, and their daughter and ‘heiress’ Jane, who died in 1805, lies next to them. There are also nearby memorials to two other probable daughters of Robert and Jane: Easter Fuller (d.1759) and Mary Edwards, nee Fuller (d. 1801). It is to be hoped that the Revd Robert conducted himself in a more seemly fashion at Water Newton than was the case at Emmanuel – although it would be fascinating to know his side of the story!\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n30 November 2023\n\nThe garden team have endured an extremely wet and mild autumn so far. The mild temperatures have meant that the leaves are still hanging on the trees, meaning that the team are playing catch-up this year.\n\nLeaf clearing is always the biggest task of the year for the team; it usually takes about three months of solid clearing to get the job done. Many leaves that we collect are then composted on site. The ability to be able to compost debris is a fantastic way of gardening sustainably. The more we compost on site means the less we must pay to be taken off site. The more composting we do, the less compost we must buy later.\n\nThe garden team can produce our own blend of compost to be used in the greenhouse for growing our plants and seedlings. We can also produce enough compost to dig back into the borders and to use as a mulch to feed our trees with. In turn, this reduces the need for artificial fertilisers and gives us a much more organic approach to gardening. Are the months of hard work worth it? We think so.\n\nThe beauty, though, of working in the gardens at this time of year is the wonderful autumn colours of the leaves. On a clear and sunny day, the leaf colours pop. The ginkgo tree in the Fellows’ Garden gives off a wonderful golden hue in the late afternoon sunshine. This is something that I can see daily from my office daily. What a treat!\n\nOther areas of beauty include Chapman’s Garden. The colours from the Dawn Redwood, the tulip tree and the sweet gum tree looked magnificent. The Oriental plane tree in the Fellows’ Garden is always the last to fall. We will still be clearing the leaves on that right up to Christmas, and maybe beyond.\n\nThe Head Groundsman at the sports ground, along with myself, took delivery of a new piece of machinery recently. The college purchased a new Verti drainer to enable us to aerate all the college grounds and lawns. This should help improve the drainage and allow for better grass root growth in general. This is something that will hopefully help us return tennis to the paddock in the future.\n\nOther jobs over the past month have included bulb planting, with additional shrub planting under the walnut tree by the library entrance. As a result of less traffic in the library car park, we were able to plant extra plants to tidy the area, hopefully without being driven over. This was the case in the past and hopefully the plants can correctly establish this time around.\n\nThe main project on my mind now, though, is drawing up some plans for the proposed Community Garden at the rear gardens in Park Terrace. We are very much at the early stage of this project, which will enable students, Fellows and staff the opportunity to have a space to garden within the grounds for general well-being. Watch this space for more details in 2024.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n1 November 2023\n\nOctober came and went in a flash. Although technically autumn, the temperatures remain mild compared with the average temperatures for this time of year. October also saw some significant rainfall. Although it wasn’t a consistently wet month, the rainfall, when it did come, was extreme.\n\nIt has felt that the gardening calendar year has been having a go at redressing the balance from the drought year of 2022. The grass (and weeds) has continued to grow and the window boxes that were put out in May continue to flourish with the bright pink flowers. It has been a funny year but a welcome one.\n\nOctober is a time when it is perfect for major lawn renovation. This month sees the Front Court lawn undertake some needed TLC. It is the month that the whole team ascend the Front Court lawn to scarify, top dress, aerate and re-seed the lawn. I am always amazed at how much thatch (dead and living material that lies between the soil and the top level of the grass shoots) is removed from the lawn. A scarifying machine is passed over the lawn to remove the thatch in multiple directions and rakes out several cubic meters of debris. The process allows for better drainage. The team also aerates the lawn to relieve compaction from the summer months before top dressing with a sand/loam mix. The top dressing is distributed and levelled before the final task is to overseed.\n\nThe final appearance always looks extremely harsh, but the lawns soon bounce back to good health. It will need a few weeks to recover before we add organic fertiliser to help carry the lawn through the harsh winter months until the spring, when the grass will start racing away again.\n\nOctober has also seen the department busy bulb planting for the spring bulbs. Most of our efforts have taken place on the new build planting beds. Front Court lawn quadrants have seen the amaranthus and geraniums replaced by the new tulip bulbs for the spring - we will be excited to see the results of our labour then.\n\nSeptember and October have also seen the Garden Team prepare the wildflower meadows for the spring. Extra yellow rattle and wildflower seeds have been sown in the Park Terrace meadows and the North Court meadows. Yellow rattle needs a period of harsh and cold weather to help with germination. The yellow rattle helps reduce the grass dominance and creates more space for other wildflowers to develop.\n\nOur usual job of leaf clearing in October has been somewhat delayed this year. Due to the mild weather, the trees have been very happy to hold onto their leaves. The significant leaf drops tend to come after a heavy frost but, so far this year, we have only seen a one-night frost. Please spare a thought for our gardeners during this time of leafing season. We have many more weeks and months ahead of us, tirelessly repeating the monotonous task which is extremely hard work. Please give the team a smile and thank them if you see them. They will all appreciate a welcome comment.\n\nThis will be our task for the next few months ahead, although we do have some additional planting to look forward to (mainly in the new build areas) and, of course, some more bulb planting.\n\nBest wishes.\n\nBrendon Sims, Head Gardener\n\n1 November 2023\n\nBarnwell Hostel, from Midsummer Common\n\nThis year marks the 70th anniversary of the college’s acquisition of Barnwell Hostel. Purchased rather hurriedly as a stop-gap measure to help meet the college’s urgent need for more student accommodation, it turned out to be an excellent long-term investment.\n\nAt the end of 1952, the college learned that 43 Newmarket Road, a recently-vacated nurses’ hostel, was for sale. Erected in about 1907 on land owned by Jesus College, the property comprised a three-storey, ten-bedroom house, set in a large garden. The surveyor’s report commissioned by Emmanuel suggested that while the hostel was structurally sound, its ‘rather bleak nature, together with its situation, do not make it very attractive for normal residential or hotel use’; in other words, it might be got cheaply. The sale went through in June 1953 and the first Emmanuel students (all Freshmen) were installed at the beginning of Michaelmas Term. A married couple occupied the Warden’s flat as caretakers.\n\nRichard Tyler’s unadopted design for Barnwell Hostel, 1959\n\nIt was soon realised that the site offered considerable potential for further development, and in 1959 the college engaged Bird & Tyler, architects, to design a new complex. Richard Tyler’s initial drawings, which envisaged the demolition of the Edwardian house and the creation of a three-sided court, were presumably in accord with his original brief. The college soon decided, however, that the existing building should be retained, so only the proposed L-shaped block was erected.\n\nTyler expounded his designs in the 1961/62 college Magazine: ‘As one comes into ‘A’ staircase one looks straight over Midsummer Common to the river through the tall bay window which runs from ground to roof…Staircase C also has a tall window running up two storeys, so that those who are young enough to bound up the first flight of stairs can enjoy the sensation of continuing into space beyond it’. Eschewing ‘pallid and off-white schemes’, Tyler chose natural wood fittings and ‘strong, clear colours’. The furnishings, which were ‘unaggressively up to date, designed for hard wear and the minimum display of dirt’, included flecked woollen upholstery and plaid curtains ‘where red merges into copper and green into blue’. Six extra-long beds were provided with Boat Club members in mind!\n\nNot everyone shared the architect’s enthusiasm for the new block. A nearby resident complained bitterly to the Bursar of his shock at finding ‘a large building of no architectural merits at the bottom of one’s garden’. His principal grievance, however, was the severe impairment of his ITV signal. The college’s polite-but-firm response was that things would probably improve when the scaffolding was removed, but that, in any event, it had fulfilled all the council’s planning conditions.\n\nBarnwell’s name plate\n\nCupola and weather vane\n\nIn November 1960, the college’s governing body agreed that 43 Newmarket Road and the new block were to be collectively known as ‘Barnwell Hostel’. John Reddaway, Fellow and later Bursar of Emmanuel, suggested that Will Carter, an acclaimed Cambridge craftsman, be engaged to carve a name plate for the Hostel’s boundary wall. After this ‘beautiful slate slab’ was vandalised in 1963, it was affixed, following restoration, to the south elevation of the Edwardian building, at a height which would be ‘out of reach to the smaller hooligans’.\n\nIn recent decades, the former caretaker’s flat has been reserved for married graduates, but it was only in 2013 that the entire hostel became a ‘graduate colony’. Given Barnwell’s peaceful ambience and semi-pastoral location, it is not surprising that the accommodation is rated highly by students. Although the building’s design is primarily functional, the panoramic staircase windows and eye-catching copper cupola (surmounted by a weather vane sporting the Emma lion) undoubtedly add a touch of distinction.\n\nAmanda Goode, College Archivist\n\n1 November 2023\n\nJames Barbut, Les Genres des Insectes de Linne (London, 1781)\n\nNow that we’ve said goodbye to the sight of butterflies for another year, the colour-plate images of their beauty in eighteenth- and nineteenth-century illustrated books – such as those in Emmanuel’s Library – are a potent reminder of their significance for so many past collectors and artists, and for those skilful individuals who managed to be both naturalists and artists. Across many cultures, the butterfly’s emergence from the chrysalis, and its ultimate derivation from a caterpillar, has symbolised transformation and rebirth, the triumph of spirit over the material and, in Christian tradition, the hope of resurrection. Yet there is always a painful sense too that the butterfly’s exquisite beauty is so evanescent.\n\nEven the selection of illustrated books about insects in Emmanuel’s collection can represent the passionate interest, even ruinous obsession, of what we would now describe as amateur collectors of insect specimens. The earliest in our collection is Eleazer Albin (d. 1742?), possibly a German immigrant but by 1708 living in Piccadilly with his family. Initially a teacher of painting in watercolours, he became fascinated by natural history and published illustrated books on English insects, birds, and ‘spiders and other curious insects’. Albin prided himself on drawing specimens from life: his A Natural History of English Insects (1720) is ‘curiously engraven from the life: and (for those who desire it) exactly coloured by the author’. Albin’s illustrations of caterpillars munching on their favourite plants, attended by the moths that they become, are both elegant and skilful.\n\nEleazer Albin, A Natural History of English Insects (1720)\n\nThe text observes that the caterpillars who feed on the marsh plant fall off so often that they have developed a powerful backstroke to get them back to the plant stem. Albin acknowledges the participation of his daughter Elizabeth in drawing and painting for his A Natural History of Birds (1731-8), and appeals to fellow enthusiasts for more specimens: ‘Gentlemen … send any curious birds to Eleazar, near the Dog and Duck in Tottenham Court Road ... '\n\nAlbin, English Insects\n\nMoses Harris, The Aurelian (1766)\n\nAnother who combined skills as an artist and engraver with interest in natural history was Moses Harris, whose The Aurelian: or Natural History of English Insects appeared in 1766. Some of his illustrations are very accurately observed, and evidently coloured by Harris or under his close supervision. Stemming from his work as a colourist, Harris also propounded a system of colours through his ‘colour wheels’ that demonstrated how a range of colours may be made from red, yellow and blue.\n\nThe Cork-born Edward Donovan (1768-1837) rarely ventured outside London, yet he published on insects from across the world. Donovan was both artist and engraver, and (with a team of employees) also a colourist – as well as an ardent student of the natural world. As well as a sixteen-volume Natural History of British Insects (1792-1813), he published An Epitome of the Natural History of the Insects of China (1798).\n\nEdward Donovan, Insects of China (1798), ‘Papilio Hyparete’, ‘Found near Canton’\n\nDonovan, Insects of China, ‘Papilio Pryanthe’, ‘Papilio Philea’\n\nDonovan also produced the first book on The Insects of India and the Islands in the Indian Seas (1800) and was the first to deal with the insects of Australia in his Insects of New Holland (1805).\n\nDonovan, Insects of China, ‘Phalaena Bubo … Zonaria … Pagaria’\n\nDonovan, Insects of India and Adjacent Islands (1800), ‘Papilio Ulysses’, ‘Dutch Spice Islands’ [Indonesia]\n\nSo how did Donovan do all this from his home in London? He was an avid collector and purchaser of specimens brought back by travellers – so much so that he even started his own Museum and Institute of Natural History, open to the public on payment of one shilling and displaying hundreds of cases of his specimens. Alas, the venture did not pay off, and Donovan’s pursuit of costly purchases of specimens so impoverished him that he eventually died penniless, leaving his large family destitute.\n\nMore successful in worldly terms was John Westwood (1805-1893), whose earlier amateur interests in both insects and in illustration later led to his becoming one of the first entomologists with an academic position at Oxford.\n\nJohn Westwood, Oriental Entomology, ‘Papilio Icarius’, ‘Assam’; Butterflies ‘From the Torres Straits Islands’\n\nBut again, these splendid illustrations to his Cabinet of Oriental Entomology (1848) – ‘being a selection of some of the rarer and more beautiful species of insects, native of India and the Adjacent Islands' – are based on specimens in the collections of other naturalists.\n\nWestwood, Oriental Entomology, Butterflies from modern-day Bangladesh\n\nThis was a collaborative fraternity of students of natural history, and Westwood collaborated with Edward Doubleday (1810-1849) on his Genera of Diurnal Lepidoptera (1846-50).\n\nWestwood, Oriental Entomology, Butterflies found in the Himalayas\n\nEdward Doubleday, Diurnal Lepidoptera, ‘Pavonia Rusina, Pavonia Ajax’\n\n‘He had a butterfly mind’ is one of the less positive associations of butterflies, hardly shared by the extraordinary application of these various artists who were also students of natural history. Their lasting accomplishment in recording their butterflies is a kind of defiance of the evanescence of their subject.\n\nBarry Windeatt, Keeper of Rare Books\n\nImages by Helen Carron, College Librarian\n\n5 October 2023\n\nMrs Edward Bury, A Selection of Hexandrian Plants (1834), ‘Crinum augustum’. Bury was the artist but Robert Havell engraved and coloured the plates.\n\nIn any collection of nineteenth-century illustrated books such as Emmanuel is fortunate to possess, there will be ‘flower books’. A significant number of such books of botanical illustration are the work of largely unsung women artists, who display extraordinary painterly skills – as well as a reverent attention to nature – in so patiently recording their observations of plants and flowers. Often published anonymously and frequently sidelined, their work quietly advances a wider knowledge of botany, enlisting beauty in the greater understanding of nature (and in many cases also educating their readers in how to paint the same flowers and foliage for themselves).\n\nThe stunningly large and brilliantly coloured lilies of Priscilla Bury’s Hexandrian Plants (1834) reflect contemporary excitement among plant collectors at such exotic new plant imports blooming in their hothouses in and around Liverpool in the 1830s. At much the same time, the Irish botanical artist Catherine Teresa Cookson (of whom little is otherwise known) catered to such a taste for exotic flora in her Flowers drawn and painted after nature in India (c.1835).\n\nCatherine Teresa Cookson, Flowers drawn … in India (c.1835), ‘A View taken in INDIA, of the LOTUS growing in water’\n\nCookson, ‘The White Plumieria’\n\nBut the impetus to teach a book’s users how to undertake botanical illustration for themselves will tend necessarily to focus on more accessible flora. The splendid illustrations in Studies of Flowers from Nature (1818-1820) by ‘Miss Smith’ are accompanied on the facing page by helpful instructions on the particular paint colours to be used in copying the image. A second set of flowers drawn only in outline is also included for colouring in. Like a number of other female botanical illustrators, Miss Smith dedicates her book to a female patron, George III’s daughter Princess Elizabeth, herself an accomplished artist. Miss Smith has never been identified but may have been a teacher in a girls’ boarding school near Doncaster.\n\nMiss Smith, Studies of Flowers from nature (1818-1820), ‘Camellia’\n\nAnne Everard, Flowers from Nature (1835), ‘Purple foxglove’\n\nAnne Everard’s Flowers from Nature … with Instructions for Copying (1835) also accompanies its thirteen hand-coloured lithographed plates with precise directions. For the purple foxglove: ‘Damp the paper with warm water and shade the corollas with a mixture of Prussian Blue and Lake; put a wash of carmine over them, and when nearly dry another of cobalt …’ (and so on for another eight lines of print).\n\nSome women artists left their drawing and painting to be engraved or lithographed by men, as with Margaret Lace Roscoe’s Floral Illustrations of the Seasons (1831), ‘From Drawings by Mrs Edward Roscoe’.\n\nMargaret Roscoe, Floral Illustrations of the Seasons (1831), ‘Colchicum byzantinum’\n\nBut other women artists engaged in, and hence controlled, the whole process themselves, as is shown by two illustrated books themed around the flowers that are mentioned by celebrated poets. In her The Flowers of Milton (1846) Jane Elizabeth Giraud is building on the success of her The Flowers of Shakespeare a year before.\n\nHer method was to draw the originals, then have them lithographed, and finally hand-colour the lithographs herself.\n\nJane Elizabeth Giraud, The Flowers of Milton (1846), illustrating lines from Milton’s ‘Lycidas’ that mention the musk rose, woodbine, cowslip and daffodil\n\nElizabeth Bartlett, The Flowers of Scott (1852), illustrating lines from Sir Walter Scott’s ‘Marmion’ mentioning the water flag and rush\n\nIn Elizabeth Bartlett’s The Flowers of Scott (1852), thirty-five lithographic plates illustrate flowers that occur in the poems of Sir Walter Scott, and Barlett indicates on each plate that she has both drawn and lithographed them (‘E.B. delt. et lith.’).\n\nAnonymous publication by women artists is well exemplified by Ten Lithographic Coloured Flowers by a Lady (Edinburgh, 1826-1832). This is actually forty fine plates published in four sets of ten. The list of subscribers – headed by the Duchess of Hamilton and the Lord Provost of Edinburgh – is entirely Scottish, but the ‘Lady’ artist remains anonymous to this day.\n\nTen Lithographic Coloured Flowers by a Lady (1826-32), ‘Primula auricula’\n\nRebecca Hey, The Spirit of the Woods (1837), ‘Mountain Ash’\n\nIn Rebecca Hey’s The Spirit of the Woods (1837) the title page makes no mention of Mrs Hey by name, although the preface refers to its author as female. There are 26 hand-coloured plates, presenting what is one of the early encyclopaedias of wild trees. Her earlier The Moral of Flowers (1833) acknowledged that the drawing and engraving had been done by men, but here are emphasized ‘the drawings for the illustration of the work, which the author herself has ventured to execute from nature and which she trusts will be found botanically correct’.\n\nA prolific woman author and illustrator on botanical subjects was Jane Loudon (1807-1858), although before she started on that career she had already published, aged only 20, a novel that is sometimes seen as a pioneer and precursor of science fiction: The Mummy! A Tale of the Twenty-Second Century (1827). (Reader, it’s a reincarnation of the Pharoah Cheops, not a dystopian matriarchy). Having reviewed The Mummy! John Claudius Loudon, the celebrated (and much older) Scottish garden designer, horticulturalist and author sou"
