Where would these 8 kids marry?\n\n@isabella @Emperor Constantine @Valena @alexmilman @VVD0D95\n\nI can not see how the mainline Bourbons can keep the crown, unless Louis Philippe listened to his wife instead of his sister Adelaide (maybe the latter was out of Paris for some reason during the July Revolution?) and so he became Regent for young Henry V.\n\nIn this scenario Henry V would marry without any doubt Clementine of Orleans who is the daughter of Orleans closest to his age (the age difference with Louise and Marie, respectively 8 and 7 years older than him, is too big for work when exist a better alternative) and that match will replace the planned one between Louise and Chartres (unless Chartres match to Louise of Artois will go on for keeping Louise in France as often French princesses do not like leaving France)...\n\nIf Leopold still became King of Belgium here is pretty likely who Louise d’Orleans will marry him a Leopold need a Catholic wife (still is pretty likely who Louise’s brother Ferdinand will be chosen as King of Belgium here as Louis Philippe can not be at the same time King of Belgium and Regent of France).\n\nExcept it would just underline the fact that France is isolated. By wasting someone they can use to build a foreign alliance on marriage to a girl a decade older than him. France needs alliances post-Restauration. Henri V marrying internally will simply point out to the rest of Europe how weak France's king is. That the only person willing to give him a wife is his cousin.\n\nLouise is the wrong choice without any doubt, but as Charles X will surely lose the crown and the only way under which Henry V can inherit the crown is under a regency of Orleans (or with his mother Caroline as main regent but still heavily dominated by Orleans) a match between Henry and the youngest daughter of the regent (just three years older than him and so in her best childbearing years when Henry will reach the age for the wedding) is almost inevitable for stabilizing Henry’s throne, as that will appease the liberals...\n\n@VVD0D95 and I were discussing a scenario where Charles X either dies BEFORE Louis XVIII or at least before whatever popularity Charles had wears off. Leading to Angoulême becoming king peacefully.\n\nThat was not what I deduced from the starting question (who implied a POD pretty close to 1830)... With Louis XIX on the throne then Louise d’Artois will marry Chartres (as they were planning for many logical reasons) and Henry V a Catholic princess, likely Archduchess Maria Beatrix of Este (who in OTL he would have liked to marry)...\n\nUnder this scenario you are giving me now I guess Orleans will most likely become King Louis Philippe I of Belgium.\n\nFor Ferdinand II of Two Sicilies I think who a possible second wife is Clementine of Orleans/Belgium (Louise of Artois is Ferdinand’s own niece). Victor Emmanuel of Savoy will marry as OTL Archduchess Adelaide (as that bench of Savoy used marry their heirs to Archduchesses). Louise and Marie are a little more complicated...\n\nThat was not what I deduced from the starting question (who implied a POD pretty close to 1830)...

I know Angoulême wasn't exactly a fan of Fernando but he's one of the few Catholic kings available\n\nExactly. First option is almost ASB, second and third will give us very different scenarios. I tried to suggest matches fir both situations (in which I see either Orleans or his heir as King of Belgium)\n\nAs one of the only people on this site that's done extensive research on the July Revolution, I can say that option one is NOT nearing ASB territory. If Charles X had taken preparations beforehand (ie disarming but not disbanding the National Guard, instead of the opposite; deploying the Army and the Royal Guard across Paris and the Île-de-France instead of believing that most of the country would support his Ordinances), then I think he could have pulled of his plans. It wouldn't be a happy situation, but it could have limped along until Charles X's death and Louis XIX's accession. Angoulême took more after Louis XVIII than his father, so he'd likely reverse his father's more controversial decisions."
