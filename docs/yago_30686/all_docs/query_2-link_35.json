        "text": "The connection between the Sanctuary of Oropa and the House of Savoy go back a long way and it would seem that a stately apartment was at the disposal of the royal family from the first half of the 17th century. The current apartments date back to the first half of the 18th century, which is witnessed by the portraits of the King of Sardinia Carlo Emanuele III (1701-1773), of his son and successor Vittorio Amedeo III (1726-1796), and their consorts, the first Savoyard sovereigns to use the apartments on the occasion of their visits to Oropa\n\nOn the walls of the salon, which is appointed with furniture from 18th C., there are portraits of all the other Kings of Sardinia and of Italy up until the last King, Umberto II. Above the fireplace in the salon, there is a painting from 1807 of the Madonna of Oropa represented with the historical jewels which once adorned the Sacred Statue"
