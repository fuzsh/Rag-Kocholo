        "text": "by Scott Mehl Â© Unofficial Royalty 2016\n\nKing Umberto I of Italy (Umberto Ranieri Carlo Emanuele Giovanni Maria Ferdinando Eugenio) was born March 14, 1844, in Turin, Kingdom of Sardinia, now in Italy. the eldest son of the future King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy and Archduchess Adelheid of Austria. He had seven siblings:\n\nMarie Clotilde (1843 â 1911) â married Prince NapolÃ©on Joseph Bonaparte, had issue\n\nPrince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (1845 â 1890) â later King Amadeo I of Spain â married (1) Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo, had issue; (2) Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, had issue\n\nPrince Oddone, Duke of Montferrat (1846 â 1866) â unmarried\n\nPrincess Maria Pia (1847 â 1911) â married King LuÃ­s I of Portugal, had issue\n\nPrince Carlo Alberto, Duke of Chablais (1851 â 1854) â died as a child\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele (born and died 1852) â died at birth\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Geneva (born and died 1855) â died as an infant\n\nUmberto was just five years old when his father became King of Sardinia, and he was then styled Prince of Piedmont. He was educated privately, with some of the most prominent statesmen and artists among his tutors. After turning 14, he began his military career with the Sardinian forces and participated in the Italian Wars of Independence. In 1861, Umberto became heir to the throne of the newly unified Kingdom of Italy.\n\nDue to the infighting within the Italian states during the wars, many other royal houses did not look kindly upon the House of Savoy and were unwilling to establish any relations with them. The House of Savoyâs conflicts with the Pope did not help when it came time to find an appropriate royal Catholic bride for Umberto.\n\nIn 1867, in an attempt to ease the tense relations between Austria-Hungary and Italy, an engagement was arranged with Archduchess Mathilde of Austria. She was the daughter of Archduke Albrecht, Duke of Teschen, and Princess Hildegard of Bavaria. However, before the marriage could take place, Mathilde died as a result of an accident. While smoking before going to the theater, she had tried to hide the cigarette from her father and caught her dress on fire, suffering severe burns. She died several days later.\n\nOn April 22, 1868, Umberto married his first cousin, Princess Margherita of Savoy (their fathers were brothers). She was the daughter of Prince Ferdinando of Savoy, Duke of Genoa, and Princess Elisabeth of Saxony. Umberto and Margherita had one son:\n\nKing Vittorio Emanuele III of Italy (1869 â 1947) â married Princess Elena of Montenegro, had issue\n\nWhen his father died on January 9, 1878, Umberto became King of Italy. Unpopular with the Italian people, Umberto was soon the target of an assassination attempt. While touring the kingdom with his wife in November 1878, an anarchist, Giovanni Passannante, attacked him with a dagger. Umberto was unharmed, but the Prime Minister who was accompanying the royal couple was severely wounded. A second assassination attempt would take place in April 1897, when Pietro Acciarito, an unemployed ironsmith, unsuccessfully attempted to stab Umberto.\n\nIn May 1898, workers organized a strike in Milan to protest against rising food costs in Italy. Wheat harvest in Italy had greatly diminished, and the cost of importing grain from America had risen due to the Spanish-American War. Despite attempts by the government to maintain the price by lowering the tariffs, it was too late and not enough. What began as a somewhat peaceful strike soon turned violent. In an attempt to control the crowds, the son of the Milan mayor was shot and killed. Soon, more workers were striking, and riots broke out. The government brought in General Fiorenzo Bava-Beccaris, one of the leaders in the Italian Wars of Independence, to restore order. All came to a head on May 7, when Bava-Beccaris ordered his troops to fire on the demonstrators. Nearly 100 people were killed and several hundred were wounded. A month later, King Umberto awarded the General with the Great Cross of the Order of Savoy, which brought further uproar among the Italian people. It would lead to a tragic end for the King.\n\nOn July 29, 1900, while in the city of Monza, King Umberto I was shot four times and killed, by Gaetano Bresci, an anarchist who claimed he was avenging the deaths that occurred in the Bava-Beccaris massacre, and the insult of rewarding General Fiorenzo Bava-Beccarisfor his actions. King Umberto I was buried in the Pantheon in Rome. His son King Vittorio Emanuele III had a chapel monument, the Expiatory Chapel of Monza, built on King Umberto Iâs assassination site.\n\nUnofficial Royalty: Assassination of Umberto I, King of Italy\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was born Prince Vittorio Emanuele Maria Alberto Eugenio Ferdinando Tommaso of Savoy on March 14, 1820, in Turin, the eldest son of Carlo Alberto, 7th Prince of Carignano, the future King of Sardinia, and Maria Theresa of Austria, Archduchess of Austria, Princess of Tuscany. He had two younger siblings:\n\nPrince Ferdinando of Savoy, Duke of Genoa (1822 â 1855) â married Princess Elisabeth of Saxony, had issue, including the future Queen Margherita of Italy\n\nPrincess Maria Cristina of Savoy (1826 â 1827) â died in childhood\n\nIn 1831, his father succeeded a distant cousin, becoming King of Sardinia. Vittorio Emanuele accompanied his father to Turin, where he underwent a very strict regimen of education and physical activities. Soon, he began his military career, attaining the rank of Colonel and commanding his own regiment. He later was elevated to the rank of General.\n\nOn April 12, 1842, at the Palazzina de caccia di Stupinigi, Vittorio was married to Archduchess Adelheid of Austria. She was the daughter of Archduke Rainer Joseph of Austria and Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. Vittorio and Adelheid were first cousins, as his father and her mother were siblings. They were also first cousins once removed through their mutual descent from Leopold II, Holy Roman Emperor. Adelheid died on January 20, 1855, just twelve days after giving birth to their youngest child.\n\nThe couple had eight children:\n\nMarie Clotilde (1843 â 1911) â married Prince NapolÃ©on Joseph Bonaparte, had issue\n\nKing Umberto I of Italy (1844 â 1900) â married Princess Margherita of Savoy, had issue\n\nPrince Amedeo, Duke of Aosta (1845 â 1890) â later King Amadeo I of Spain â married (1) Maria Vittoria dal Pozzo, had issue; (2) Princess Maria Letizia Bonaparte, had issue\n\nPrince Oddone, Duke of Montferrat (1846 â 1866) â unmarried\n\nPrincess Maria Pia (1847 â 1911) â married King LuÃ­s I of Portugal, had issue\n\nPrince Carlo Alberto, Duke of Chablais (1851 â 1854) â died as a child\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele (born and died 1852) â died at birth\n\nPrince Vittorio Emanuele, Count of Geneva (born and died 1855) â died as an infant\n\nIn 1847, 27-year-old Vittorio Emanuele met 14-year-old Rose Vercellana when her father became the commander of the royal garrison at the Royal Castle of Racconigi, the hunting estate of the royal family of Sardinia. She soon became his mistress. At that time, Vittorio Emanuele had been married to his wife Adelheid of Austria for seven years and five of their eight children had been born.\n\nVittorio Emanueleâs many other relationships were brief but his relationship with Rosa lasted the rest of his life. Their early meetings were very secret because Vittorio Emanueleâs father Carlo Alberto, King of Sardinia was against the affair and because it was illegal to have sex with minors. Eventually, Rosa was given a home on the grounds of the Palazzina di caccia of Stupinigi (the hunting residence of Stupinigi), closer to Turin, the seat of government.\n\nRosa and Vittorio Emanuele had a daughter and a son, born when Rosa was fifteen and eighteen:\n\nVittoria Guerrieri (1848 â 1905), married (1) Giacomo Filippo Spinola, had three children (2) Luigi Domenico Spinola, brother of her first husband, had one daughter (3) Paolo de Simone, no children\n\nEmanuele Alberto Guerrieri, Count of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda (1851 â 1894), married Bianca Enrichetta de Lardere, had two sons\n\nFollowing a massive defeat by the Austrian forces, Vittorio Emanueleâs father abdicated on March 23, 1849, and he became King of Sardinia as Vittorio Emanuele II. He became a driving force behind the âRisorgimentoâ, the Italian unification movement.\n\nOver the next twelve years, Vittorio Emanuele led the drive toward a unified kingdom. Under the leadership of Giuseppe Garibaldi, a noted general and politician, the Sardinian forces soon gained Sicily and Naples. He then led his forces against the Papal army, driving the Pope into Vatican City. This resulted in the Pope excommunicating Vittorio Emanuele from the Roman Catholic church. Garibaldi soon conquered the Kingdom of Two Sicilies but was stopped from attacking Rome as it was under protection from the French. With all the newly acquired lands, on March 17, 1861, Vittorio Emanuele was proclaimed the first King of the new, united Kingdom of Italy.\n\nAfter the death of Vittorio Emanueleâs wife Adelheid in 1855, his relationship with Rosa Vercellana continued, despite his numerous other lovers, and became more public. Although the relationship caused much scandal and hostility at court, Vittorio Emanuele did not yield to any pressure. In 1858, Vittorio created Rosa Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, recognized their two children, and gave them the surname Guerrieri. A year later, Vittorio Emanuele purchased the Castle of Sommariva Perno (link in Italian) for Rosa. Although Rosa was despised by the nobles, she was loved by the common people for her peasant origins.\n\nWhen Vittorio Emanuele fell seriously ill in 1869 and feared he was dying, he married Rosa in a religious ceremony on October 18, 1869. However, Vittorio Emanuele did not die. The marriage was morganatic, a marriage between people of unequal social rank in which the position or privileges of the higher-ranked spouse are not passed on to the other spouse or any children. Rosaâs children had no succession rights and she did not become Queen of Italy, instead, she retained her titles Countess of Mirafiori and Fontanafredda, which the Vittorio Emanuele had given her in 1858. So that Rosa would have marriage civil rights, a civil marriage was held on October 7, 1877, just three months before Vittorio Emanueleâs death.\n\nIn 1870, allied with Prussia, the King capitalized on Prussiaâs victory over France in the Franco-Prussian War and captured Rome after the French forces withdrew. On September 20, 1870, Vittorio Emanuele entered Rome, established the city as the new capital of Italy, and took up residence at the Quirinal Palace in Rome, Italy.\n\nThe remainder of his reign was more peaceful. The King focused on building up the new Kingdom, both financially and culturally, further cementing his legacy as âFather of the Fatherlandâ (Padre Della Patria), a title given to him by the Italian people. King Vittorio Emanuele II of Italy died at the Quirinal Palace on January 8, 1878. He is buried in the Pantheon in Rome.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Following her grandfatherâs assassination in 1913, Helenâs father became King of the Hellenes. However, he would be forced from the throne in 1917. The family settled in Switzerland, while Helenâs brother Alexander was chosen to replace his father.\n\nIn 1920, while the Greek royal family was in exile, Queen Marie of Romania and her daughters visited them. This resulted in the engagement of Helenâs brother, the future King George II of the Hellenes, and Princess Elisabeta of Romania. The group was soon joined by the future King Carol II of Romania who was returning from a trip around the world, intended to separate him from his first (and former) wife, Zizi Lambrino. After traveling together to Romania for the engagement announcement, Helen and Carol returned together to Switzerland and became closer on the journey. After returning, Carol asked Helenâs father for her hand in marriage, and their engagement was announced in November 1920. They married on March 10, 1921, at the Metropolitan Cathedral of the Annunciation in Athens, Greece, and following a honeymoon, returned to Romania.\n\nThe couple had one son:\n\nKing Mihai of Romania (1921 â 2017) â married Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma, had issue\n\nThe couple had apartments at Cotroceni Palace but lived at the ChÃ¢teau de Foisor on the grounds of PeleÈ Castle, and later moved to a house in Bucharest. The marriage was not a happy one. Helen was very proper and aristocratic, while Carol preferred spending his time partying with his friends, and in the company of other women. Within a few years, Carol began an affair with Magda Lupescu, and in 1925 he renounced his rights to the throne and left the country. Helen was given the title Princess of Romania.\n\nIn July 1927, King Ferdinand died, and Helenâs son Mihai ascended the throne at just five years old. Despite being the mother of the King, Helen had no official position, nor was she a member of the Regency Council. At the end of that year, Carol asked Helen for a divorce, which she initially refused. However, she later gave in to the advice of the government, and the couple was formally divorced on June 21, 1928.\n\nIn June 1930, Carol returned to Romania following a coup organized by Prime Minister Iuliu Maniu. The parliament voided his previous renunciation of the throne, and he was proclaimed King. Helen remained at their home in Bucharest with her son, while there was a significant discussion, both publicly and within the government, about annulling the coupleâs divorce. Helen was told that since the 1926 renunciation was voided, she had technically become Queen of Romania when her father-in-law died in 1927. However, when presented with a decree from the government to confirm Helen as Her Majesty The Queen of Romania, Carol refused, insisting that she should be styled Her Majesty Helen.\n\nWhile Helen considered the annulment of their marriage, Carol was adamantly against it. Faced with harsh treatment from Carol â guards placed around her home, visitors harassed â Helen left Romania and traveled to her motherâs home in Italy. After she returned in 1932, King Carol began a media campaign to damage her reputation. The government finally interceded, announcing that she would be permitted to live in Romania for six months each year and take her son abroad for one month. They also confirmed her civil list payment. Despite all of this, she was expected to remain abroad. She purchased a home in Italy and in 1934 moved into Villa Sparta â her motherâs former home â along with her brother Paul and two sisters. She remained there for ten years, only seeing her son for a month or two each year.\n\nIn 1940, Carol was forced to abdicate and Mihai returned to the throne. Helen was called back to Romania and given the formal title Her Majesty the Queen Mother of Romania. Helen served as a close advisor to her son and encouraged him to stand up to Prime Minister Ion Antonescu who had established himself as dictator.\n\nDuring World War II, she devoted herself to caring for the wounded, and in 1942 she played a major role in stopping Antonescuâs plans to deport the Jews. For this, she was later awarded the status Righteous Among the Nations (in 1993, nearly eleven years after her death). By 1947, Romania was under Communist control, and Helen and King Mihai were treated very harshly. When they traveled to London for the wedding of Helenâs cousin Philip Mountbatten to Princess Elizabeth of the United Kingdom, many in the Romanian government hoped that they would not return. Despite being urged to remain in London, the two returned to Romania on December 21, 1947. Within days, King Mihai was forced to relinquish the throne, with threats of mass executions if he did not agree to abdicate. The country was proclaimed a republic and Mihai and Helen left Romania on January 3, 1948.\n\nThey settled in Switzerland, where they found themselves in poor financial circumstances. They had most of their assets and properties seized by the Romanian government and had been stripped of their citizenship. Helenâs biggest concern was the upcoming marriage of her son to Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma. Due to Anneâs Catholicism, most of her family refused to attend as the Pope would not sanction the marriage. Instead, Helenâs brother, King George II of the Hellenes, arranged for the couple to marry in Athens in June 1948.\n\nHelen then returned to Villa Sparta in Italy, often hosting her son and his growing family, as well as her sister Irene and her son. She often traveled to England and Greece to visit family and participated in the Cruise of the Kings in 1954, hosted by her brother, King Paul of the Hellenes, and sister-in-law, Princess Frederica of Hanover. Helen also indulged her love of Renaissance painting and architecture, spending much time visiting museums and exhibits. Her love of gardening also led to a romance with the twice-widowed King Gustaf VI Adolf of Sweden, who reportedly proposed marriage but Helen declined. Always struggling financially, Helen was forced to sell off many of her remaining assets and eventually had to give up Villa Sparta.\n\nIn 1979, now facing the effects of age and financial difficulties, Helen left Italy and settled in a small apartment in Lausanne, Switzerland. She later moved in with her son and his family. On November 28, 1982, Princess Helen of Greece, Queen Mother of Romania, died in Lausanne. She was initially buried at the Bois-de-Vaux Cemetery in Lausanne. Helen was reburied at the new Archdiocesan and Royal Cathedral at Curtea de ArgeÈ on October 19, 2019.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He had five younger siblings:\n\nPrincess Elisabeta, Queen of the Hellenes (1894-1956), married King George II of Greece, no issue\n\nPrincess Maria, Queen of Yugoslavia (1900-1961), married King Alexander I of Yugoslavia, had issue\n\nPrince Nicholas (1903-1978), married (1) Ioana Doletti, no issue (2) Thereza Lisboa Figueira de Mello, no issue\n\nPrincess Ileana, Archduchess of Austria (1909-1991) â married (1) Archduke Anton of Austria-Tuscany, had issue; (2) Dr. Stefan Issarescu, no issue\n\nPrince Mircea (1913-1916), died from typhoid fever at age 3\n\nKing Carol II was the first King of Romania to be born in Romania, and the first member of the Romanian royal family to be brought up in the Orthodox faith. His predecessors were both born in Germany and had been permitted to remain members of the Roman Catholic church.\n\nFrom a very early age, Carol was raised primarily by his great-uncle and great-aunt, King Carol I and Queen Elisabeth. The King felt that Carolâs parents were unable to raise their son properly. Ferdinand and Marie were young, and Marie had already had several affairs which contrasted with the strict moral attitudes of King Carol I. The result was a virtual tug-of-war between Carolâs parents and the King and Queen, which left him, according to one historian, âboth spoiled and deprived of love.â\n\nDespite the Kingâs efforts to raise Carol in his own militaristic image, the young prince soon found that he preferred to spend his time chasing women and partying with his friends. By the time he was 19, he had already fathered two illegitimate children. In 1913, the King had him commissioned in the Prussian Guards, hoping to curb his hedonistic lifestyle. He later took his seat in the Romanian Senate upon reaching his maturity.\n\nOn August 31, 1918, Carol married Joanna âZiziâ Lambrino, the daughter of a Romanian general, at the Cathedral Church of Odesa, Ukraine, Russia. The marriage had not been sanctioned by the King, nor was it welcomed by the Romanian people. The marriage was annulled seven months later, but the couple continued to live together, and the following year, in January 1920, they had a son â Mircea Gregor Carol Lambrino (later known as Prince Mircea Grigore Carol of Romania).\n\nThe following year, on March 10, 1921, Carol married his second cousin, Princess Helen of Greece, the daughter of King Constantine I of the Hellenes and Princess Sophie of Prussia. They had one son:\n\nKing Mihai of Romania (1921 â 2017) â married Princess Anne of Bourbon-Parma, had issue\n\nThe marriage had been arranged to help form an alliance between Romania and Greece, however, it was never a happy one, and the two of them were horribly mismatched. Helen was very aristocratic and refined, while Carol continued his partying ways and indulged in numerous affairs. In 1925, he began a relationship with Elena âMagdaâ Lupescu. She was the daughter of Jewish parents but had been raised Roman Catholic, as her mother had converted in her youth. Her father had converted to Orthodoxy. Magda had married a Romanian army officer in 1919 but was later divorced. It is speculated that she was still married when she first met Carol in 1923, but this is uncertain. Other sources state her divorce took place in 1920.\n\nCarol made no efforts to hide his affair, and it quickly caused great controversy in Romania. Knowing that the Romanian constitution barred him from marrying her, on December 28, 1925, Carol renounced his rights to the Romanian throne. Once ratified by the parliament, this left his young son Mihai as heir-apparent.\n\nOn July 20, 1927, King Ferdinand died, and Mihai became King of Romania at just six years old. Several months later, Carol asked Helen for a divorce. After initially refusing, she was later advised to agree and their marriage was formally dissolved on June 21, 1928.\n\nIn early June 1930, Carol quietly returned to Romania to negotiate with the Prime Minister for his return to the throne. On June 7th, following a coup, Carolâs early renunciation was voided, and he was restored as King of Romania, replacing his young son. Despite taking an oath to uphold the 1923 Constitution, King Carol had no intention of doing so. From the beginning, he attempted to increase his powers, intending to establish a dictatorship. In a reign riddled with political in-fighting, Carol often pitted the political parties against each other, for his own gains.\n\nAfter discovering a plan to bring the anti-Semitic party into power, King Carol suspended the constitution on February 10, 1938, proclaiming martial law and suspending civil liberties. He dismissed the Prime Minister and appointed the head of the Romanian Orthodox Church as his replacement. With the fear of impending war, King Carol tried to play both sides of the fence. He appealed to Britain for help, offering to place Romania under their economic influence, while also visiting Hitler in Germany, attempting to improve relations between the two countries. At the onset of war, Carol declared neutrality, violating both the 1921 treaty with Poland and the 1926 treaty with France. It wasnât until May 1940, seeing that France was losing the battle, that Carol aligned with the Axis powers.\n\nThe following month, he was forced to cede several regions to the Soviet Union, knowing that the Romanian forces were no match for the Red Army. Further land was lost in August 1940, as a result of the Second Vienna Award. With no support from the Romanian people, and the Romanian forces refusing to follow his orders, King Carol II was forced to abdicate on September 6, 1940, in favor of his son, Mihai.\n\nCarol went into exile, settling in Mexico with Magda Lupescu. They bought a home in Mexico City, where he attempted to organize a movement to overthrow General Antonescu. Several attempts to regain the throne failed, as he had no political support.\n\nCarol and Magda moved to Brazil in 1944, where they married on June 3, 1947. They soon moved to Estoril, Portugal, where he would live in exile for the remainder of his life. King Carol II died suddenly of a heart attack on April 4, 1953, in Estoril, Portugal. His remains were placed in the Royal Pantheon of the House of Braganza at the Monastery of SÃ£o Vicente de Fora in Lisbon, Portugal. His wife Magda was also buried there when she died 24 years later. In 2003, their remains were brought back to Romania and buried in a chapel outside the Curtea de ArgeÅ Monastery in ArgeÅ, Romania. His son, the former King Mihai who had not seen his father since 1940, did not attend.\n\nRomania Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\nKingdom of Romania Index\n\nRulers of Romania\n\nRomanian Royal Dates\n\nRomanian Royal Burial Sites\n\nProfiles: Romanian Kings and Consorts\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

He was the younger of the two sons and the fifth of the eight children of King Frederik III of Denmark and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg.\n\nGeorge had seven siblings:\n\nKing Christian V of Denmark (1646 â 1699), married Charlotte Amalie of Hesse-Kassel; had issue\n\nAnna Sophie (1647 â 1717), married Johann Georg III, Elector of Saxony; had issue\n\nFrederica Amalia (1649 â 1704), married Christian Albert, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp; had issue\n\nWilhelmina Ernestina (1650 â 1706), married to Karl II, Elector Palatine\n\nUlrika Eleonora (1656 â 1693), married King Karl XI of Sweden, had issue\n\nFrederik (1651 â 1652), died in infancy\n\nDorothea (1657 â 1658), died in infancy\n\nGeorge was educated by the Hanoverian statesman Baron Otto Grote zu Schauen and then later by Danish Bishop Christen Jensen Lodberg. From 1668 â 1669, George undertook the traditional Grand Tour and visited France, England, Italy, and Germany. After the death of his father in 1670, he returned to Denmark, when his older brother succeeded to the throne as King Christian V. In 1674, George was briefly a candidate for the Polish throne, however, from the outset, there was little chance of success because George was a staunch Lutheran and would not convert to Catholicism.\n\nOn July 28, 1683, at the Chapel Royal in St. Jamesâ Palace in London, England, George married Anne of England (the future Queen Anne), the youngest of the two surviving daughters of James, Duke of York (the future King James II of England) and his first wife Anne Hyde. Even though the marriage was arranged, the marriage was happy and they were faithful to each other. The coupleâs London residence was a set of buildings at Whitehall Palace in London, England, called the Cockpit-in-Court.\n\nAnne became pregnant a few months after the wedding, but she gave birth to a stillborn daughter in May 1684. Anneâs obstetrical history is tragic. She had 17 pregnancies with only five children being born alive. Two died on the day of their birth, two died at less than two years old within six days of each from smallpox, and one died at age 11. Anne suffered from what was diagnosed as gout and had pain in her limbs, stomach, and head. Based on these symptoms and her obstetrical history, Anne may have had systemic lupus erythematosus which causes an increased rate of fetal death.\n\nStillborn daughter (May 12, 1684)\n\nMary (June 2, 1685 â February 8, 1687), died of smallpox\n\nAnne Sophia (May 12, 1686 â February 2, 1687), died of smallpox\n\nMiscarriage (January 21, 1687)\n\nStillborn son (October 22, 1687)\n\nMiscarriage (April 16, 1688)\n\nPrince William, Duke of Gloucester (July 24, 1689 â July 30, 1700)\n\nMary (born and died October 14, 1690)\n\nGeorge (born and died April 17, 1692)\n\nStillborn daughter (March 23, 1693)\n\nMiscarriage (January 21, 1694)\n\nMiscarriage of daughter (February 17 or 18, 1696)\n\nMiscarriage (September 20, 1696)\n\nMiscarriage (March 25, 1697)\n\nMiscarriage of twins (early December 1697)\n\nStillborn son (September 15, 1698)\n\nStillborn son (January 24, 1700)\n\nGeorge was naturalized as an English subject in 1683, invested as a Knight of the Garter in 1684, and created Duke of Cumberland, Earl of Kendal, and Baron Wokingham in 1689. Prince George played no part in politics and had no real ambitions. His uncle by marriage, King Charles II, famously said of George, âI have tried him drunk, and I have tried him sober, and drunk or sober, there is nothing there.\n\nUpon the death of King Charles II in 1685, Georgeâs father-in-law the Roman Catholic Duke of York came to the throne as King James II. Anne and George became the center of Protestant opposition against the new king. On November 5, 1688, William III, Prince of Orange landed in England with an invasion army. Married to Anneâs elder sister Mary, William III, Prince of Orange was the only child of Mary, Princess Royal, the eldest daughter of King Charles I of England, so he was third in the line of succession at that time. The Glorious Revolution resulted, James fled to France, and Anneâs sister and brother-in-law became joint monarchs, King William III and Queen Mary II\n\nOn December 28, 1694, Anneâs sister Queen Mary II died of smallpox. She was just 32 years old. King William III continued to reign alone for the remainder of his life. As William and Mary had no children, Anne was now the heir presumptive to the throne and her son William was second in the line of succession.\n\nOn July 24, 1700, Anneâs son Prince William, Duke of Gloucester celebrated his eleventh birthday at a party held at Windsor Castle. Jenkin Lewis, his servant, reported, âHe complained a little the next day, but we imputed that to the fatigues of a birthday so that he was much neglected.â In the evening, William complained of a sore throat and chills. Two days later, he was no better and had developed a fever and was delirious. The doctors suspected smallpox, but no rash appeared, so they used the usual treatments of the time, bleeding and blistering, which no doubt, made Williamâs condition worse. William died on the morning of July 30, 1700, at Windsor Castle, probably of pneumonia. His body was taken to the Palace of Westminster where it lay in state in his apartments. William was interred in the Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey during the evening of August 7, 1700. His uncle, King William III wrote to the Duke of Marlborough, that Williamâs death was âso great a loss to me as well as to all of England, that it pierces my heart.â\n\nAnne and her husband George were devastated. This death and the failure of the Protestant Stuarts to produce heirs meant the end of the Protestant Stuart dynasty as the legitimate descendants of King Charles I were either childless or Roman Catholic. The Act of Settlement 1701 secured the Protestant succession to the throne after Williamâs sister-in-law and heir presumptive Princess Anne. The act excluded the former King James II (who died a few months after the act received royal assent) and the Roman Catholic children from his second marriage and also excluded the descendants of King James IIâs sister Henrietta, the youngest daughter of King Charles I. Parliamentâs choice was limited to the Protestant descendants of Elizabeth Stuart, Electress Palatine, the only other child of King James I not to have died in childhood. The senior Protestant descendant was Elizabethâs youngest daughter Sophia, Electress of Hanover. The Act of Settlement put Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant heirs in the line of succession after Anne.\n\nOn February 20, 1702, King William III went riding on his horse at Hampton Court Palace. The horse stumbled on a molehill and fell and broke his collarbone. It was set by a surgeon, but instead of resting, William insisted on returning to Kensington Palace. A week later, the fracture was not mending well and Williamâs right hand and arm were puffy and did not look right. His condition continued to worsen and by March 3, William had a fever and had difficulty breathing. King William III died on March 8, 1702, and was succeeded by his sister-in-law and cousin Anne. Queen Anneâs coronation took place on St Georgeâs Day, April 23, 1702. Despite being only 37 years old, Anne was so overweight and infirm that she had to be carried in a sedan chair to Westminster Abbey. At the coronation, Anneâs husband Prince George paid homage to her. He was the first husband of a reigning queen to do so and it was not to be repeated until Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh paid homage to his wife Queen Elizabeth II at her 1953 coronation.\n\nIn March and April 1706, George became seriously ill but seemed to recover. He spent much of the summer of 1708 at Windsor Castle with asthma that was so bad he was not expected to live. Prince George died on October 28, 1708, at Kensington Palace in London at the age of 55. Queen Anne deeply grieved for him. She was desperate to remain with Georgeâs body but reluctantly left after persuasion from her childhood friend and favorite Sarah, Duchess of Marlborough. George was buried privately at midnight on November 13, 1708, at Westminster Abbey in a vault under the monument to George Monck, Duke of Albemarle in the Henry VII Chapel. Charles II, William III, Mary II, and Georgeâs wife Anne were also buried in this vault.\n\nHouse of Stuart Resources at Unofficial Royalty\n\nUnited Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Index\n\nHouse of Stuart Index\n\nCoronations after the Norman Conquest (1066 â present)\n\nHistory and Traditions: Stuart Weddings\n\nHouse of Stuart Burial Sites\n\nHouse of Stuart Christenings\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Anneâs mother died of breast cancer in 1671, when Anne was 6 years old. At that time, Anne and her elder sister Mary were declared âchildren of the stateâ and their education became the responsibility of their uncle King Charles II. The two sisters were moved away from their fatherâs Catholic influence and given their own household at Richmond Palace on the River Thames under the care of Sir Edward Villiers and his wife Frances. The Villiers daughters were educated with Mary and Anne, and the girls had lessons in religion, French, drawing, music, and dancing.\n\nIn 1673, Anneâs father James made a second marriage with the Catholic 15-year-old Maria Beatrice of Modena. Anne was only seven years younger than her stepmother and James told his daughters that he had provided them with a new playmate.\n\nAnne had seven half-siblings via her fatherâs second marriage with Maria Beatrice of Modena, but only two survived childhood:\n\nCatherine Laura Stuart (1675 â 1676)\n\nIsabel Stuart (1676 â 1681)\n\nCharles, Duke of Cambridge (born and died 1677), died of smallpox\n\nElizabeth Stuart (born and died 1678)\n\nCharlotte Maria Stuart (born and died 1682)\n\nJames Francis Edward, Prince of Wales âthe Old Pretenderâ (1688 â 1766), married Mary Sobieski, had issue\n\nLouisa Maria Teresa Stuart (1692 â 1712), died of smallpox\n\nAround 1671, Anne first met Sarah Jennings who eventually became her great friend and very influential adviser. Sarah and Anne became closer friends when Sarah was appointed a maid of honor to Maria Beatrice of Modena, Anneâs stepmother. Sarah married John Churchill, the future 1st Duke of Marlborough. During Anneâs reign, John Churchill served Anne as a general in the War of the Spanish Succession. Anne had Blenheim Palace built for John Churchill in Oxfordshire as a reward from a grateful nation for the dukeâs military victories against the French and Bavarians during the War of the Spanish Succession, culminating in the 1704 Battle of Blenheim. Sarah fell out of favor with Anne in 1711 and Abigail Masham, a cousin of Sarah, became Anneâs favorite and remained so until Anneâs death. Among the more famous descendants of the Marlboroughs are Sir Winston Churchill and Diana, Princess of Wales.\n\nIn December of 1680, George, The Hereditary Prince of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg (the future King George I) made a three-month visit to his future kingdom of Great Britain and rumors were flying that he would become the husband of his second cousin Princess Anne, the future Queen Anne, whom he later succeeded. However, on July 28, 1683, at the Chapel Royal in St. Jamesâ Palace, Anne married the Protestant Prince George of Denmark, son of King Frederik III of Denmark and Sophie Amalie of Brunswick-LÃ¼neburg and brother of King Christian V of Denmark. Even though the marriage was arranged, the marriage was happy and they were faithful to each other. The coupleâs London residence was a set of buildings at Whitehall Palace called the Cockpit-in-Court.

Anne and her elder sister Mary, who had married their first cousin Willem III, Prince of Orange, were Jamesâ only surviving children and were first and second in the line of succession followed by William who was third as the only child of King Charles Iâs eldest surviving daughter Mary, Princess Royal. King James II was now set on restoring Catholicism to England. He issued a Declaration of Indulgence removing restrictions that had been imposed on those that did not conform to the Church of England. England might have tolerated King James II knowing that his heirs were the Protestant daughters of his first wife Anne Hyde, Mary and Anne. However, on June 10, 1688, Jamesâ second wife Maria Beatrice of Modena, who had no surviving children, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward. Immediately, false rumors swirled that the infant had been smuggled into the queenâs chambers in a warming pan.\n\nOn November 5, 1688, Willem III, Prince of Orange, the nephew and son-in-law of King James II, landed in England vowing to safeguard the Protestant interest. He marched to London, gathering many supporters. James panicked and sent his wife and infant son to France. He tried to flee to France about a month later but was captured. William had no desire to make his uncle a martyr, so he allowed him to escape. James was received in France by his cousin King Louis XIV, who offered him a palace and a pension.\n\nBack in England, Parliament refused to depose James but declared that having fled to France, James had effectively abdicated the throne and that therefore the throne had become vacant. Jamesâs elder daughter Mary was declared Queen Mary II and she was to rule jointly with her husband Willem, who would be King William III. This overthrow of King James II is known as the Glorious Revolution. James was determined to regain the throne and landed in Ireland with a French force in 1689. He was defeated by his nephew William at the Battle of the Boyne on July 1, 1690, and was forced to withdraw once again to France where he lived in exile for the rest of his life. William and Mary were crowned at Westminster Abbey on April 11, 1689.\n\nOn December 28, 1694, Anneâs sister Queen Mary II died of smallpox. She was just 32 years old. King William III continued to reign alone for the remainder of his life. As William and Mary had no children, Anne was now the heir presumptive to the throne and her son William was second in the line of succession.\n\nOn July 24, 1700, Prince William, Duke of Gloucester celebrated his eleventh birthday at a party held at Windsor Castle. Jenkin Lewis, his servant, reported, âHe complained a little the next day, but we imputed that to the fatigues of a birthday so that he was much neglected.â In the evening, William complained of a sore throat and chills. Two days later, he was no better and had developed a fever and was delirious. The doctors suspected smallpox, but no rash appeared, so they used the usual treatments of the time, bleeding and blistering, which no doubt, made Williamâs condition worse. William died on the morning of July 30, 1700, at Windsor Castle, probably of pneumonia. His body was taken to the Palace of Westminster where it lay in state in his apartments. William was interred in the Henry VII Chapel at Westminster Abbey during the evening of August 7, 1700. His uncle King William III wrote to the Duke of Marlborough that Williamâs death was âso great a loss to me as well as to all of England, that it pierces my heart.â\n\nAnne and her husband George were devastated. This death and the failure of the Protestant Stuarts to produce heirs meant the end of the Protestant Stuart dynasty as the legitimate descendants of King Charles I were either childless or Roman Catholic. The Act of Settlement 1701 secured the Protestant succession to the throne after Williamâs sister-in-law and heir presumptive Princess Anne. The act excluded the former King James II (who died a few months after the act received royal assent) and the Roman Catholic children from his second marriage. It also excluded the descendants of King James IIâs sister Henrietta, the youngest daughter of King Charles I. Parliamentâs choice was limited to the Protestant descendants of Elizabeth Stuart, Electress Palatine, the only other child of King James I not to have died in childhood. The senior Protestant descendant was Elizabeth Stuartsâs youngest daughter Sophia, Electress of Hanover. The Act of Settlement put Sophia of Hanover and her Protestant heirs in the line of succession after Anne.\n\nOn February 20, 1702, King William III went riding on his horse at Hampton Court Palace. The horse stumbled on a molehill and fell and broke his collarbone. The collarbone was set by a surgeon, but instead of resting, William insisted on returning to Kensington Palace that evening. A week later, it was discovered that the fracture was not mending well and Williamâs right hand and arm were puffy and did not look right. His condition continued to worsen and by March 3, William had a fever and had difficulty breathing. King William III died on March 8, 1702, and was succeeded by his sister-in-law and cousin Anne. Queen Anneâs coronation took place on St Georgeâs Day, April 23, 1702. Despite being only 37 years old, Anne was so overweight and infirm that she had to be carried in a sedan chair to Westminster Abbey. At the coronation, Anneâs husband Prince George paid homage to her. He was the first husband of a reigning queen to do so and it was not to be repeated until Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh paid homage to his wife Queen Elizabeth II at her 1953 coronation.\n\nDuring Queen Anneâs reign, England was engaged in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which England, Austria, and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain. On March 6, 1707, the Acts of Union were passed. England and Scotland were united into a single kingdom called Great Britain. Anneâs husband, Prince George died at age 55 on October 28, 1708, at Kensington Palace and was buried at Westminster Abbey. Anne deeply grieved for her husband and wrote to his nephew King Frederik IV of Denmark, âthe loss of such a husband, who loved me so dearly and so devotedly, is too crushing for me to be able to bear it as I ought.â\n\nQueen Anne suffered a stroke on July 30, 1714. She died at Kensington Palace on August 1, 1714, at the age of 49 after suffering another stroke. Her remains were buried at Westminster Abbey in a vault under the monument to George Monck, 1st Duke of Albemarle in the Henry VII Chapel. Charles II, William III, Anneâs sister Mary II, and Anneâs husband George of Denmark were also buried in this vault. Anne had become so obese that her coffin was much larger than the other coffins in the vault as can be seen in the drawing below. Electress Sophia of Hanover, the heir to the throne according to the Act of Settlement, had died on June 8, 1714, just six weeks before the death of Queen Anne, and so Sophiaâs son became King George I and started the Hanover dynasty.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.

Mary was born at St. Jamesâ Palace in London, England on April 30, 1662. Her elder brother Charles lived for only six months and had died before Mary was born. Except for the short time one or more of her three younger brothers were alive, Mary was second in line to the throne after her father, brother of King Charles II.\n\nMary had seven siblings, of whom only Mary and her sister Anne survived childhood:\n\nCharles, Duke of Cambridge (1660 â 1661), died of smallpox at seven months\n\nJames, Duke of Cambridge (1663 â 1667), died of the bubonic plague or smallpox at age 3\n\nQueen Anne of Great Britain (1665 â 1714), married Prince George of Denmark, no surviving issue\n\nCharles, Duke of Kendal (1666 â 1667), died in infancy\n\nEdgar, Duke of Cambridge (1667 â 1671), died at age 3\n\nHenrietta Stuart (born and died 1669), died in infancy\n\nCatherine Stuart (born and died 1671), died in infancy\n\nMary was christened in the Church of England on May 9, 1662, at the Chapel Royal in St. Jamesâ Palace. Her godparents were:\n\nThe Duchess of Buckingham (born The Honorable Mary Fairfax, wife of George Villiers, 2nd Duke of Buckingham)\n\nThe Duchess of Ormonde (born Elizabeth Preston, wife of James Butler, 1st Duke of Ormonde)\n\nPrince Rupert of the Rhine, her fatherâs first cousin\n\nMaryâs mother and father converted to Roman Catholicism, but on the orders of King Charles II, Mary and her sister Anne were brought up in the Church of England. Maryâs mother died of breast cancer in 1671 when Mary was 9 years old. At that time, Mary and her younger sister Anne were declared âchildren of the stateâ and their education became the responsibility of their uncle King Charles II. The two sisters were moved away from their fatherâs Catholic influence and given their own household at Richmond Palace on the River Thames under the care of Sir Edward Villiers and his wife Frances. The Villiers daughters were educated with Mary and Anne, and the girls had lessons in religion, French, drawing, music, and dancing.\n\nIn 1673, Maryâs father James made a second marriage with the Catholic 15-year-old Maria Beatrice of Modena. Mary was only four years younger than her stepmother and James told his daughters that he had provided them with a new playmate.\n\nMary had seven half-siblings via her fatherâs second marriage with Maria Beatrice of Modena, but only two survived childhood:\n\nCatherine Laura Stuart (1675 â 1676)\n\nIsabel Stuart (1676 â 1681)\n\nCharles, Duke of Cambridge (born and died 1677), died of smallpox\n\nElizabeth Stuart (born and died 1678)\n\nCharlotte Maria Stuart (born and died 1682)\n\nJames Francis Edward, Prince of Wales âthe Old Pretenderâ (1688 â 1766), married Mary Sobieski, had issue\n\nLouisa Maria Teresa Stuart (1692 â 1712), died of smallpox\n\nIn 1677, when Mary was 15 years old, it became apparent that Catherine of Braganza, the wife of King Charles II, would not provide a Stuart heir. In addition, Maria Beatrice of Modena had two miscarriages and two daughters, one who had died in infancy and one who was sickly and not expected to survive. Maryâs marriage became a matter of dynastic importance for the House of Stuart. The bridegroom her uncle chose for her was William III, Prince of Orange, her first cousin. William was the only child of Maryâs paternal aunt Mary, Princess Royal and Willem II, Prince of Orange who had died of smallpox a few days before his sonâs birth. William was fourth in line to the English throne after his uncle James and his cousins Mary and Anne.\n\n15-year-old Mary and 27-year-old William were married on November 4, 1677, in Maryâs bedchamber at St. Jamesâ Palace with only the closest relatives attending. The bride was miserable, the groom acted with cool correctness, the father of the bride was grimly resigned to the marriage, and the stepmother of the bride, who was very pregnant, was in tears at the prospect of losing her stepdaughter. The brideâs aunt Catherine of Braganza tried to comfort Mary saying, âWhen I came to England I had not even seen the King,â to which Mary replied, âMadam, you came into England, but I am going out of England.â Maryâs sister Anne and her governess Lady Frances Villiers were unable to attend as they were both ill with smallpox. Only the bride and groomâs uncle, King Charles II, was his usual cheerful and tactless self. Upon closing the curtains around the marital bed, Charles remarked, âNow nephew, to your work! Hey! St. George for England!â\n\nWilliam and Mary made a formal entry into The Hague, the seat of Williamâs Dutch Republic, on December 14, 1677. Mary soon became pregnant but suffered a miscarriage which may have prevented any future successful pregnancies. It is suspected that she had at least two more miscarriages. Her inability to have children was Maryâs greatest unhappiness. Despite their physical mismatch, Mary was quite tall (5 feet 11 inches; 180 cm) and towered over the undersized and asthmatic William (5 feet 6 inches; 167 cm), William adored Mary and Mary was devoted to William. Unlike his uncles, Charles II and James II who had many mistresses, William reputedly had only one mistress, Elizabeth Hamilton, Countess of Orkney.\n\nIn 1685, William and Maryâs uncle King Charles II died without any legitimate children despite having at least 14 illegitimate children. Maryâs father, who had converted to Roman Catholicism, succeeded his brother as King James II. Mary and her younger sister Anne were Jamesâ only surviving children and were first and second in the line of succession followed by William who was third as the only child of King Charles Iâs eldest surviving daughter. King James II was now set on a course of restoring Catholicism to England. He issued a Declaration of Indulgence removing restrictions imposed on those that did not conform to the Church of England. England might have tolerated King James II knowing that his heirs were the Protestant daughters of his first wife Anne Hyde, Mary and Anne. However, on June 10, 1688, Jamesâ second wife Maria Beatrice of Modena, who had no surviving children, gave birth to a son, James Francis Edward. Immediately, false rumors swirled that the infant had been smuggled into the queenâs chambers in a warming pan.\n\nOn November 5, 1688, William III, Prince of Orange, the nephew and son-in-law of King James II, landed in England vowing to safeguard the Protestant interest. He marched to London, gathering many supporters. James panicked and sent his wife and infant son to France. He tried to flee to France about a month later but was captured. William had no desire to make his uncle a martyr, so he allowed him to escape. James was received in France by his cousin King Louis XIV, who offered him a palace and a pension.\n\nBack in England, Parliament refused to depose James but declared that having fled to France, James had effectively abdicated the throne and that therefore the throne had become vacant. Jamesâs elder daughter Mary was declared Queen Mary II and she was to rule jointly with her husband William, who would be King William III. This overthrow of King James II is known as the Glorious Revolution. James was determined to regain the throne and landed in Ireland with a French force in 1689. He was defeated by his nephew William at the Battle of the Boyne on July 1, 1690, and was forced to withdraw once again to France where he lived in exile for the rest of his life.\n\nWilliam and Mary were crowned at Westminster Abbey in London, England on April 11, 1689. Since they were joint sovereigns, a duplicate coronation chair and a duplicate set of regalia were required for the coronation ceremony. At previous coronations, monarchs had sworn to uphold the laws made by their ancestors. However, William and Mary swore to rule according to âthe statutes in Parliament agreed upon and laws and customs of the sameâ and promised to uphold the Protestant reformed religion.\n\nOn December 16, 1689, Parliament passed the Bill of Rights 1689 which limited the powers of the monarch and set out the rights of Parliament. The Bill of Rights 1689 along with the Act of Settlement 1701 are still in effect in the United Kingdom and Commonwealth realms although both have been amended by the Perth Agreement 2011 which took effect on March 26, 2015. The Bill of Rights also confirmed the succession to the throne. Following the death of either William or Mary, the other was to continue to reign. Next in the line of succession would be any children of the couple, to be followed by Maryâs sister Anne and her children. Last in the line of succession stood any children William III might have had from any subsequent marriage. Beginning in 1690, William was often on military campaigns in Europe and left Mary to reign. She was not keen on assuming such power but did so with the advice of a nine-member Cabinet Council.\n\nWilliam and Mary left a legacy in the United States. In 1693, William and Mary granted a royal charter to found the College of William and Mary, now in present-day Williamsburg, Virginia. It is the second oldest university in the United States after Harvard University and the only university in the United States with a royal charter. The College of William and Mary educated American Presidents Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and John Tyler, and other key figures important to the development of the United States as a nation, including Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall, Speaker of the House of Representatives Henry Clay, sixteen members of the Continental Congress, and four signers of the Declaration of Independence. Another alumnus of The College of William and Mary is this writerâs son.\n\nIn early December 1694, Mary became ill. Smallpox was spreading through London and it was feared that Mary might have contracted the disease, a disease that had previously killed both of Williamâs parents. Mary was in a weakened state having been upset about Williamâs latest illness and the sudden death of John Tillotson, Archbishop of Canterbury. One morning when Mary awoke, she felt particularly ill and noticed a rash on her arms. Eventually, the doctors confirmed that Mary was suffering from smallpox, which she accepted with an attitude that surprised all around her. The first thing Mary did was to send away everyone who had not had smallpox. William, who had survived the disease, had a bed put in Maryâs room and oversaw her medical care.\n\nPrayers were said for Mary in all the churches on Christmas Day 1694. Mary said that she had slept well and felt better. The rashes seemed to have disappeared and the doctors were hopeful that perhaps it had been measles. However, when Mary was examined in the evening, the nine doctors attending her discovered that the rashes had turned inward and sunk into her skin, which was not a good sign. Mary had an uncomfortable night and her throat was hemorrhaging. The desperate doctors tried all sorts of remedies: bleeding Mary, applying hot irons to her forehead, and giving her various potions. Mary was told that she was dying. The usual unemotional William broke down and burst into tears. Mary begged him to control himself and not to make her suffer by seeing him so upset. She told him that she was ânot so badâ to which William replied, âthat if God caused this blow to fall, it would be all over for me.â\n\nDr. John Radcliffe, the renowned doctor, examined Mary on December 27. He confirmed that Maryâs condition was hopeless. Mary received Communion and tried to pray, but she was too weak, and in a whisper, asked others to pray for her. In the evening, Mary was much weaker. She tried to talk to William, but the effort was too much for her. William approached her in tears and Mary motioned him away. Soon she lapsed into unconsciousness. In the early morning of December 28, 1694, Mary peacefully died. She was just 32 years old. William was terribly grief-stricken, collapsed at Maryâs bedside, and had to be carried, nearly insensible, from the room. For a few days, it was feared that William too would die.\n\nMary lay in state in the Banqueting Hall of Whitehall Palace. Despite the cold weather, large crowds lined up to file past their Queen and pay their respects. On March 5, 1695, in a heavy snowstorm, the funeral procession traveled the short distance from Whitehall Palace to Westminster Abbey. The King was not present, according to custom, but all members of both Houses of Parliament, all wearing black, attended the funeral. The noted English composer Henry Purcell specially composed Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary.\n\nYouTube: Purcell â Music for the Funeral of Queen Mary\n\nQueen Mary II was buried in a vault under the monument to George Monck, Duke of Albemarle in the Henry VII Chapel of Westminster Abbey. Charles II, Maryâs husband William III, Maryâs sister Anne and her husband George of Denmark were also buried in this vault. A joint monument for William III and Mary II was designed but never constructed. An inscription on the floor marks her grave. William reigned alone until he died in 1702 when he was succeeded by Maryâs sister Anne.\n\nThis article is the intellectual property of Unofficial Royalty and is NOT TO BE COPIED, EDITED, OR POSTED IN ANY FORM ON ANOTHER WEBSITE under any circumstances.
