        "text": "A pseudonym is a fictitious name used to conceal someone’s real name. The word pseudonym literally means “false name” and comes from the Greek word pseudōnymos meaning “having a false name” or “under a false name.” You may be surprised to know that the names of your favorite authors, actors and musicians are, in fact, pseudonyms. Some tweak their names or go by nicknames while others create whole new personas. The pseudonym of an author is also known as a pen name and the pseudonym of an actor is a stage name or screen name. A pseudonym can also be an alias used by people or groups.\n\nYou've probably heard of a eulogy. However, did you know there was a whole section of poetry dedicated to lamenting the dead? This is called an elegy. Learn more about what an elegy is and how it's been used to create beautifully crafted elegy poem examples."
