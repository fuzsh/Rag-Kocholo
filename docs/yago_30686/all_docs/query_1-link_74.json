        "text": "Maria II (April 4, 1819 – November 15, 1853) was Queen of Portugal from 1826 to 1828, and again from 1834 to 1853. One of the two surviving children born when future King Pedro IV was still heir apparent to Portugal, she inherited Portuguese titles and was placed in the line of succession to the former Portuguese throne, even after becoming a member of the Brazilian imperial family, from which she was excluded in 1835 after her definitive ascension to the Portuguese throne.\n\nBirth\n\nMaria II was born Infanta Maria da Glória on April 4, 1819 in the Palace of São Cristóvão in Rio de Janeiro, Kingdom of Brazil. She was the eldest daughter of Prince Dom Pedro de Alcântara, future King of Portugal as Pedro IV and first Emperor of Brazil as Pedro I, and his first wife Archduchess Caroline of Austria, herself a daughter of Franz II, Holy Roman Emperor and his second wife, Maria Theresa of Naples and Sicily.\n\nInfanta Maria da Glória was titled Princess of Beira upon her birth. Born in Brazil, Maria was the only European monarch to have been born outside of Europe, though she was still born in Portuguese territory.\n\nHer father, Infante Pedro of Portugal, living in Brazil after the Portuguese Royal Family escaped there in the wake of the Napoleonic Wars, was acclaimed Emperor Pedro I on his 24th birthday, which coincided with the inauguration of the Empire of Brazil on October 12. He was crowned on December 1 in what is today known as the Old Cathedral of Rio de Janeiro.\n\nSuccession crisis\n\nThe death of Maria’s grandfather, King João VI of Portugal in March 1826 sparked a succession crisis in Portugal. Before his death, the king had nominated his favourite daughter, Dona Isabel Maria, to serve as regent until “the legitimate heir returned to the kingdom” — but he had failed to specify which of his sons was the legitimate heir: the liberal Emperor Pedro I or the absolutist, exiled Miguel. However, Infante Miguel, had been exiled to Austria after leading a number of revolutions against his father and his liberal regime.\n\nMost people considered Pedro to be the legitimate heir, but Brazil did not want him to unite Portugal and Brazil’s thrones again. Aware that his brother’s supporters were ready to bring Miguel back and put him on the throne.\n\nThe Emperor was proclaimed King on March 10, 1826, and succeeded his father on the Portuguese throne as King Pedro IV.\n\nAware that a reunion of Brazil and Portugal would be unacceptable to the people of both nations. Pedro decided for a more consensual option: he would renounce his claim to the Portuguese throne in favor of his eldest daughter Maria (who was only seven years old). His abdication on May 2 was conditional: Portugal was required to accept the Constitution which he had drafted and Maria II was to marry his brother Miguel (her uncle) who would accept the liberal constitution and act as a regent until his niece reached the age of majority.\n\nMiguel pretended to accept, but upon his arrival in Portugal, he immediately deposed Maria II and proclaimed himself King of Portugal on June 23, 1828. Then began the Liberal Wars that lasted until 1834. King Miguel abrogating the liberal constitution in the process. During his reign, Maria traveled to many European courts, including her maternal grandfather’s in Vienna, as well as London and Paris.\n\nAfter a three-year civil war, Miguel I was forced to abdicate at the Concession of Evoramonte (May 26, 1834). Miguel embarked on June 1, 1834 on a British warship from Sines bound for Genoa; he lived in exile first in Italy, then in England, and finally in Germany. He never returned to Portugal.\n\nMaria was thereupon restored to the throne, and obtained an annulment of her betrothal. Soon after her restoration to the throne, her father died from tuberculosis.\n\nOccupying the Portuguese throne, Maria II was still heir presumptive to her brother Emperor Pedro II of Brazil as Princess Imperial of Brazil, until her exclusion from the Brazilian line of succession by law no. 91 of October 30, 1835.\n\nQueen Maria II married Auguste, Duke of Leuchtenberg, son of Eugène de Beauharnais and grandson of the Empress Josephine of France, on 26 January 26, 1835, at the age of fifteen. However, he died only two months later, on March 28, 1835.\n\nOn April 9, 1836, Maria married the cultured and able Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg and Saalfeld, eldest son of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his wife Princess Maria Antonia Koháry de Csábrág et Szitnya, heiress to the House of Koháry.\n\nIn accordance with Portuguese law, he had a right to be King of Portugal through jure uxoris as the husband of Queen Maria II. However, according to the law he would not be proclaimed King until the birth of their first child and heir, Pedro. He was Co-sovereign as King Fernando II rom the birth of their first son in 1837 to her death in 1853.\n\nIn 1842, Pope Gregory XVI presented Maria with a Golden Rose.\n\nMaria’s reign saw a revolutionary insurrection on May 26, 1846, but this was crushed by royalist troops on February 22, 1847, and Portugal otherwise avoided the European Revolution of 1848. Maria’s reign was also notable for a public health act aimed at curbing the spread of cholera throughout the country. She also pursued policies aimed at raising the levels of education throughout the country.\n\nDeath\n\nFrom her first pregnancy at the age of eighteen, Maria II faced problems in giving birth, with prolonged and extremely difficult labor. An example of this was her third gestation, whose labor lasted 32 hours, after which a girl was baptized in articulo mortis with the name of Maria (1840).\n\nAt 25 years of age and in her fifth gestation, Maria II became obese and her births became even more complicated. In 1847, the fetal distress that preceded the birth of her eighth child – the Infante Augusto, Duke of Coimbra – brought to the world a child “quite purple and with little breathing”.\n\nThe dangerous routine of successive pregnancies, coupled with obesity (which eventually caused her heart problems) and the frequency of dystocic births (worrisome, especially as a multiparous woman) led doctors to warn the queen about the serious risks she would face in future pregnancies. Indifferent to the warnings, Maria II merely replied: “If I die, I die at my post.”\n\nOn November 15, 1853, thirteen hours after the onset of labor of the stillborn Infante Eugénio, her eleventh child, Maria II died at the age of 34.\n\nQueen Maria II was succeeded by her eldest son as King Pedro V of Portugal. As the eldest son of Queen Maria II and King Fernando II, Pedro was a member of the House of Bragança. As heir apparent to the throne he was styled Prince Royal and was also the 23rd Duke of Braganza (Duque de Bragança.\n\nPedro V, along with his brothers Fernando and João and other royal family members, succumbed to typhoid fever or cholera in 1861.\n\nMaria I (December 17, 1734 – March 20, 1816) was Queen of Portugal from February 24, 1777 until her death in 1816. Known as Maria the Pious in Portugal and Maria the Mad in Brazil, she was the first undisputed Queen Regnant of Portugal and the first monarch of Brazil.\n\nMaria was the eldest daughter of King José I of Portugal and Infanta Mariana Victoria of Spain, the eldest daughter of King Felipe V of Spain and Queen Elisabeth Farnese.\n\nKing João V appointed his granddaughter Maria as the Princess of Beira on the day of her birth.\n\nMaria’s grandfather João V died on July 3, 1750. Her father, Prince José, then succeeded to the throne as King José I. As José’s eldest child, Maria became his heir presumptive and was given the traditional titles of Princess of Brazil and Duchess of Braganza.\n\nOn June 6, 1760 Maria married her uncle Pedro of Portugal. Maria and Pedro had six children: José, João Francisco, João (later King João VI), Mariana Vitória, Maria Clementina, and Maria Isabel. Only José, João, and Mariana Vitória survived to adulthood. Maria also delivered a stillborn boy in 1762.\n\nKing José died on February 24, 1777. His daughter, Maria, then became the first undisputed queen regnant of Portugal. With Maria’s accession, her husband became nominal king as Pedro III, but the actual regal authority was vested solely in Maria, as she was the lineal heir of the crown. Also, as Pedro’s kingship was jure uxoris only, his reign would cease in the event of Maria’s death, and the crown would pass to Maria’s descendants.\n\nUpon ascending the throne, Maria dismissed her father’s powerful chief minister, Sebastião José de Carvalho e Melo, 1st Marquis of Pombal, who had broken the power of the reactionary aristocracy via the Távora affair, partially because of his Enlightenment, anti-Jesuit policies. Noteworthy events of this period include Portugal’s membership in the League of Armed Neutrality (July 1782) and the 1781 cession of Delagoa Bay from Austria to Portugal. However, the queen suffered from religious mania and melancholia and this would take a toll on her health.\n\nThe early part of Maria’s reign witnessed growth in Portugal’s economy. Maria had a number of national buildings constructed and renovated, leading to the completion of the Palace of Queluz and the inauguration of the Palace of Ajuda and other new monuments. The death of her husband in 1786, followed by the deaths in 1788 of her eldest son José and her confessor Inácio de São Caetano, caused the queen to develop clinical depression. Her second son, João, then served as prince regent.\n\nIn February 1792, Maria was deemed mentally insane and was treated by Francis Willis, the same physician who attended the British king George III. Willis wanted to take her to England, but the plan was refused by the Portuguese court. Potentially as a result of Willis’ more advisory role in Maria’s care, rather than the hands-on care of King George III, Willis deemed the queen incurable. Maria’s second son, João, now Prince of Brazil, took over the government in her name, even though he only took the title of Prince Regent in 1799. When the Real Barraca de Ajuda burnt down in 1794, the court was forced to move to Queluz, where the ill queen would lie in her apartments all day. Another potential cause of her mental illness was her incestuous ancestry, this is substantiated by two of her sisters who had similar conditions.\n\nWith Napoleon’s European conquests, Maria and her court moved to the Portuguese colony of Brazil in 1807. After Brazil was elevated to a kingdom in 1815, Maria became Queen of the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves.\n\nIn 1816, she died at the Carmo Convent in Rio de Janeiro at the age of 81. After her death, the prince regent was acclaimed as King João VI. Maria’s body was returned to Lisbon to be interred in a mausoleum in the Estrela Basilica (Portuguese: Basilica da Estrela), which she had helped found.\n\nMaria is a greatly admired figure in both Brazil and Portugal due to the tremendous changes and events that took place during her reign. In Portugal, she is celebrated as a strong female figure. Her legacy shines at Portugal’s Queluz Palace, a baroque-roccoco masterpiece that she helped conceive. A large statue of her stands in front of the palace, and a pousada near the palace is named in her honour. A large marble statue of the queen was erected at the Portuguese National Library in Lisbon by the students of Joaquim Machado de Castro.\n\nCatherine of Braganza (November 25, 1638 – December 31, 1705) was queen consort of England, of Scotland and of Ireland from 1662 to 1685, as the wife of King Charles II.\n\nCatherine was born at the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa, as the second surviving daughter of John, 8th Duke of Braganza and his wife, Luisa de Guzmán. Following the Portuguese Restoration War, her father was acclaimed King John IV of Portugal, on December 1, 1640.\n\nWith her father’s new position as one of Europe’s most important monarchs, Portugal then possessing a widespread colonial empire, Catherine became a prime choice for a wife for European royalty, and she was proposed as a bride for Johann of Austria, François de Vendôme, duc de Beaufort, Louis XIV and Charles II.\n\nThe consideration for the final choice was due to her being seen as a useful conduit for contracting an alliance between Portugal and England, after the Treaty of the Pyrenees in 1659 in which Portugal was arguably abandoned by France. Despite her country’s ongoing struggle with Spain, Catherine enjoyed a happy, contented childhood in her beloved Lisbon.\n\nNegotiations for the marriage began during the reign of King Charles I, were renewed immediately after the Restoration, and on June 23, 1661, in spite of Spanish opposition, the marriage contract was signed. England secured Tangier (in North Africa) and the Seven Islands of Bombay (in India), trading privileges in Brazil and the East Indies, religious and commercial freedom in Portugal, and two million Portuguese crowns (about £300,000).\n\nIn return Portugal obtained British military and naval support (which would prove to be decisive) in her fight against Spain and liberty of worship for Catherine. She arrived at Portsmouth on the evening of May 13-14,1662, but was not visited there by Charles until 20 May 20, The following day the couple were married at Portsmouth in two ceremonies – a Catholic one conducted in secret, followed by a public Anglican service.\n\nOwing to her devotion to the Roman Catholic faith in which she had been raised, Catherine was unpopular in England. She was a special object of attack by the inventors of the Popish Plot. In 1678 the murder of Edmund Berry Godfrey was ascribed to her servants, and Titus Oates accused her of an intention to poison the king.\n\nThese charges, the absurdity of which was soon shown by cross-examination, nevertheless placed the queen for some time in great danger. On November 28, Oates accused her of high treason, and the English House of Commons passed an order for the removal of her and of all Roman Catholics from the Palace of Whitehall.\n\nSeveral further depositions were made against her, and in June 1679 it was decided that she should stand trial, which threat however was lifted by the king’s intervention, for which she later showed him much gratitude.\n\nShe produced no heirs for the king, having suffered three miscarriages. Her husband kept many mistresses, most notably Barbara Palmer, whom Catherine was forced to accept as one of her Ladies of the Bedchamber. By his mistresses Charles fathered numerous illegitimate offspring, which he acknowledged.\n\nCatherine is credited with introducing the British to tea-drinking, which was then widespread among the Portuguese nobility.\n\nAt Charles’ final illness in 1685, she showed anxiety for his reconciliation with the Roman Catholic faith, and she exhibited great grief at his death. When he lay dying in 1685, he asked for Catherine, but she sent a message asking that her presence be excused and “to beg his pardon if she had offended him all his life.” He answered, “Alas poor woman! she asks for my pardon? I beg hers with all my heart; take her back that answer.\n\nCatherine remained in England, living at Somerset House, through the reign of James and his deposition in the Glorious Revolution by William III and Mary II. She remained in England partly because of a protracted lawsuit against her former Lord Chamberlain, Henry Hyde, 2nd Earl of Clarendon, over money that she claimed as part of her allowance and that he claimed was part of the perquisite of his office. Catherine’s fondness for money is one of the more unexpected features of her character: her brother-in-law James, who was himself notably avaricious, remarked that she always drove a hard bargain.\n\nInitially on good terms with William III and Mary II, her position deteriorated as the practice of her religion led to misunderstandings and increasing isolation. A bill was introduced to Parliament to limit the number of Catherine’s Catholic servants, and she was warned not to agitate against the government.\n\nShe finally returned to Portugal in March 1692. In 1703, she supported the Treaty of Methuen between Portugal and England. She acted as regent for her brother, Pedro II, in 1701 and 1704–05. She died at the Bemposta Palace in Lisbon on December 31, 1705 and was buried at the Monastery of São Vicente de Fora Lisbon\n\nCarlos I (September 28, 1863 – February 1, 1908), known as the Diplomat and the Martyr was the King of Portugal from 1889 until his assassination in 1908. He was the first Portuguese king to die a violent death since Sebastian in 1578.\n\nCarlos, King of Portugal\n\nCarlos was born in Lisbon, Portugal, the son of King Luís and Queen Maria Pia, daughter of King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy and his wife Archduchess Adelaide of Austria, daughter of Archduke Rainer of Austria and his wife Princess Elisabeth of Savoy. and was a member of the House of Braganza. He had a brother, Infante Afonso, Duke of Porto. He had an intense education and was prepared to rule as a constitutional monarch. In 1883, he traveled to Italy, the United Kingdom, France and Germany, where he increased his knowledge of the modern civilization of his time. In 1883, 1886 and 1888, he ruled as regent as his father was traveling in Europe, as had become traditional among the Portuguese constitutional kings. His father Luis I advised him to be modest and to study with focus.\n\nMaria Pia of Savoy, mother of King Carlos\n\nDom Carlos had quite a few choices in selecting a royal spouse. His main options were the Archduchess Marie Valerie of Austria, Princess Mathilde of Saxony, Princess or Princess Victoria of Wales. Another bridal candidate was Viktoria of Prussia daughter of German Emperor Friedrich III. However, Don Carlos was Catholic and any Prussian princess would have been Protestant therefore the issue of religion presented an insurmountable problem, and the pressure of British diplomacy prevented the marriage.\n\nHe then met and married Princess Amélie of Orléans, eldest daughter of Philippe, comte de Paris, pretender to the throne of France, and his wife, Princess Marie Isabelle d’Orléans. At first, the marriage was not popular, however, Amélie and Don Carlos came to live quite harmoniously with each other.\n\nPrincess Amélie of Orléans\n\nOn February 1, 1908, the royal family returned from the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa in Vila Viçosa to Lisbon, where they spent time hunting in Alentejo in the hunting season during the winter. They travelled by train to Barreiro and, from there, they took a steamer to cross the Tagus River and disembarked at Cais do Sodré in central Lisbon. On their way to the royal palace, the open carriage with Carlos I and his family passed through the Terreiro do Paço fronting on the river.\n\nThere were only a few people in the Terreiro do Paço as the carriage rounded the eastern part of the square and the first shot rang out. As reported later, a bearded man had walked out into the road after the carriage had passed; he removed a Winchester carbine rifle hidden under his overcoat, knelt on one knee and fired at the King from a distance of about 8 metres (8.7 yd). The shot struck the king’s neck, killing him instantly.\n\nPrince Royal, Luís Filipe of Portugal\n\nThe assassins then turned their attention to the Prince Royal, Luís Filipe, who had stood to draw and fire a hidden revolver but was hit in the chest. The bullet (from a small-caliber revolver) did not exit his sternum nor was it fatal; the prince reportedly fired four quick shots at his attacker, who fell from the carriage step. However, when Luís Filipe stood up he became more visible to the attacker with the rifle; the prince was struck by a large-caliber shot which exited from the top of his skull.\n\nLuís Filipe lived for another twenty minutes. Manuel survived the attack, having only been shot in the arm, while the queen was unharmed. Had automatic ascension to the throne been the law, Luís Filipe would have been one of the shortest-reigning monarchs in history, with a reign of just twenty minutes.\n\nThe queen alone escaped injury. The two assassins were killed on the spot by police and bodyguards; an innocent bystander was also killed in the confusion. Several days later, the younger son, Prince Manuel, was proclaimed king of Portugal; as Manuel II and he was the last of the Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha dynasty and the last king of Portugal as well."
