        "text": "Well, technically Nappy could win in Russia if he didn't go and invade but rather let the Russian impale themselves in Poland, but that's not the answer to the question...\n\nIf Nappy II reached marriage age, and assuming Napoleonic victory in the continent. I'm going to hedge my bets and say it would not be with a French or Spanish Bourbon (not even going into the Sicilian Bourbons either). I'm sure the Bourbons would be pissed at the imperial house that not only deprived said family from two thrones but reduced them to just an island off the boot of Italy.\n\nThen again, if a Bourbon marriage, then it would have to be the only ones who benefited from said marriage, in this case, the Parmese Bourbons who was to be guaranteed the throne of Northern Lusitania (I'd prefer calling it Lusitania but I digress.) Maria Antonia is a likely candidate for this role.\n\nKinda want to avoid keeping it in the family, kind of anathema if you ask me. But the other possibilities are all well and good though.\n\nWhat about Princess Maria Cristina of Savoy/Sardinia? She was born in 1812 and would be of the right age. Would the Sardinians and Napoleon even consider such a match?\n\nProbably but highly unlikely. The Sardinians would also have beef with Napoleon since they lost Piedmont and Savoy to them. The only reason I wouldn't say it would be impossible is because I see Victor Emmanuel I (Maria Christina's father) as a pragmatic reactionary (not unlike Louis XVIII, if Louis XVIII was actually a reactionary and not a conservative).\n\nHowever at the same time Victor Emmanuel I, if he doesn't abdicate as per OTL, is still going to die in a few years time, and the throne will pass to ultra-reactionary Charles Felix, who would probably be opposed to anything involving Napoleon, and I can imagine her uncle cutting that marriage off.\n\nWhat about, and this is very much unlikely, Louise d'Orléans, OTL Queen of the Belgians? She's the right age and it could be a way to reconcile a branch of the Bourbons with the Napoleonic empire. Louis-Philippe always struck me as willing to do anything for power. Some kind of marriage deal (restoration of some of the d'Orléans estate in return for their renunciation of the throne in favor of the Bonapartes and a royal marriage) seems like something up his alley.\n\nIf not, I guess it would be between a Bavarian Princess and an Austrian Archduchess.\n\nWhat about, and this is very much unlikely, Louise d'Orléans, OTL Queen of the Belgians?

Some kind of marriage deal (restoration of some of the d'Orléans estate in return for their renunciation of the throne in favor of the Bonapartes and a royal marriage) seems like something up his alley.\n\nIf not, I guess it would be between a Bavarian Princess and an Austrian Archduchess.\n\nAs you said, it's still very unlikely, but more likely than the Sardinian match. Louis-Philippe probably was a guy who was willing to do anything for power. So it is feasible to see the Orleans match with Napoleon II. Now whether or not it would be beneficial in the long run however, I do not know.\n\nFrankly, it's a toss up between the following:\n\n- Louise d'Orleans (OTL 1812-1850): daughter of Louis Philippe III, Duke of Orleans. OTL Married Leopold of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha/Leopold I of Belgium\n\n- Mathilde Karoline von Wittelsbach (OTL 1813-1862): daughter of Ludwig I, King of Bavaria. OTL Married Ludwig III, Grand Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt\n\n- Theodelinde von Wittelsbach (OTL 1816-1817): daughter of Ludwig I, King of Bavaria. OTL died in infancy\n\n- Maria Theresa von Habsburg-Teschen (OTL 1816-1867): daughter of Charles, Archduke of Austria and Duke of Teschen. OTL Married Ferdinand II of the Two Sicilies.\n\n- Hermine von Habsburg-Lorraine (OTL 1817-1842): daughter of Joseph, Archduke of Austria and Palatine of Hungary. Unmarried OTL.\n\nFor the sake of argument lets say Napoleon wins in Russia (manages to draw the Russians into a battle and crushes them), forces Alexander back into the continental system and eventually makes a permanent peace with the United Kingdom. France dominates the continent. In such a scenario who would be the most likely bride for the King of Rome, Napoleon's heir? A Bonaparte first cousin? Another Habsburg Archduchess? One of the German Princesses (Bavaria or Saxony being the most likely)? A Russian Grand Duchess? Or even one of Napoleon's former enemies, like an Iberian Infanta or a Princess of Sardinia/Sicily? Or even someone I haven't thought of?\n\nI can see a Russian bride being one of the conditions of a peace agreement. That is the exact way he married Marie-Louise, and one of Napoléon's long-term goals would be a stable Franco-Russian alliance as a basis of stability in Europe. Marrying yet another Hapsburg would be a bit consanguine (something even the Hapsburgs had stopped to do for about one century ;-) ) and Prussia is essentially destroyed as a state, so the Hohenzollerns are out. Spanish and Sicilian ideas are fun but maybe too Bourbon (but that would make for a fun royal competition in France if the legitimist line of Artois eventually dies out, between the Spanish Bourbons, the Orléans, and the Bourbonapartes). Bavaria is an interesting possibility but maybe too minor, and already dependent enough on Napoléon.\n\nAs you said, it's still very unlikely, but more likely than the Sardinian match.

Unmarried OTL.\n\nI'd say Hermine would be to low ranking but Archduke Karl's daughter could be interesting. Napoleon did have respect for him as a general so an alliance of their children could fit in his thinking. But of the Bavarians I'd say Mathilde is more likely.\n\nI can see a Russian bride being one of the conditions of a peace agreement.

Bavaria is an interesting possibility but maybe too minor, and already dependent enough on Napoléon.\n\nWhat about an ATL Portuguese Infanta? While Joao and his wife did detest each other, a short reconciliation could be possible and their last child was born in 1806, so not impossible to consider. I can see Britain demanding the restoration of Portugal as a term in peace negotiations and Napoleon might be willing to do so , if only to get Britain out of Spain. A marriage concession could be a possible demand of the Emperor.\n\nOr, if the POD was no deposition of the Borbóns of Spain, then a Spanish bride could be a good choice. Have Fernando VII remarry and produce a daughter. She'd be of an age to marry the King of Rome.\n\nThese four will have my support if you can prove that butterflies wont affect them.\n\nWhat about Grand Duchess Elizabeth Alexandrovna of Russia? She is the younger child of Alexander I of Russia and his wife, Elizabeth Alexeievna (Louise of Baden) In OTL she died in 1808, but if Napoleon won and had a French doctor care for his Russian hostage, spots the signs of an infection and treats the young duchess; in OTL the infection was just blamed on teething.\n\nOr Princess Vilhelmine Marie of Denmark? The youngest daughter of Frederick VI of Denmark, who made Denmark the most loyal ally of Napoleon, it would seem a fitting gesture to make a loyal ally's daughter Empress.\n\nCan't see Alexander giving his daughter as a hostage. But a Surviving Elizabeth or an ATL sister (after all her mother was still young enough to have another child, one that could survive to adulthood) would make an interesting match.\n\nAs for Vilhelmine, I'd considered her as well but she did die childless and was a Protestant. Napoleon wasn't that religious but I think he would recognize the importance of a Catholic bride. Vilhelmine would have to convert.\n\nI like an ATL Grand Duchess of Russia or Iberian Infanta the best. Both are ranking enough to be considered \"worthy\" of the Emperor's son and any of them could cement either an alliance (Spain) or peace (Russia and Portugal). Plus they have the added benefit of having no close relation to Napoleon II, avoiding inbreeding.\n\nCan't see Alexander giving his daughter as a hostage.

If he is defeated by Napoleon, he will be at the mercy of him and his demands.\n\nAs for Vilhelmine, I'd considered her as well but she did die childless and was a Protestant. Napoleon wasn't that religious but I think he would recognize the importance of a Catholic bride. Vilhelmine would have to convert.\n\nTo be crowned as Empress of the French Empire, I think Vilhelmine, will be happy to convert.\n\nI like an ATL Grand Duchess of Russia or Iberian Infanta the best.

She may be from a small Ducky, but she is the right age & the maternal niece of Tsar Alexander I.\n\nShe is a good candidate, apart from being a liberal-minded woman, who was very interested in politics, this could alienate her with her imperialistic father-in-law."
