        "text": "Ora telegrams from London, which we published this\n\nmorning, announce the death of Victor Emmanuel,\n\nand the proclamation of Prince Humbert as King of\n\nItaly. The following short biographies of these two\n\nmen are taken from \" Men of the Time \" :\n\nVICTOR EMMANUEL.--\" Victor Emmanuel, King of\n\n! Italy, son of Charles Albert, King of Sardinia,\n\nand of Queen Theresa, daughter of Grand Duke\n\nI Ferdinand of Tuscany, was born March 11, 1820,\n\nj and received at his baptism the names Marie-Albert\n\ni Eugene - Ferdinand - Thomas-Victor-Emmanuel. He\n\nwas carefully educated in science and military tactics,\n\nand married in April 12, 1842, ? the Archduchess\n\nAdelaide of. Austria, who died January 20,\n\ni 1855. He took an active part, as Duke of Savoy,\n\nin the events of 1848, accompanying his father\n\nto the field, and behaving with great bravery at the\n\nbattles of Gotto and Novara. On the evening after\n\nthe latter (March 24, 1840), Charles Albert signed his\n\nabdication in the Bellini Palace, Little was then\n\nknown of his son and successor, who assumed the title\n\nVictor Emmanuel II., except that he was a dashing\n\nhunter, somewhat haughty, and a reputed opponent of\n\nLiberalism. He succeeded in obtaining from Austria\n\nterms less humiliating than those imposed on his\n\nfather, but the treaty of peace was not signed till\n\nAugust, 1849. On mounting the throne of Sardinia\n\nhe endeavoured to reorganize the finances, the army,\n\nand the system of public instruction, concluded with\n\nEngland several treaties of commerce, established\n\nrailways, and promoted free trade. He indignantly\n\nrefused the offer made by Austria for the cession of\n\nParma, provided he would abolish the Constitution.\n\nGenoa having revolted, and expelled his garrison, he\n\nsent an army against it, recovered his former rights,\n\nand his efforts for the prosperity of his kingdom were\n\ngenerally successful. He had, however, one great\n\nstruggle throughout his reign with the court and\n\nclergy of Rome. Guided by Count Cavour, he con-\n\nfiscated much church property, and took away many\n\nclerical privileges. He concluded, in January, 1855,\n\na convention with France and England, to take part in\n\nthe war against Russia, and dispatched to the\n\nCrimea an army of 17,000 men, under General De La\n\nMarmora, which distinguished itself by a victory on\n\nthe banks of the Tchernaya. Sardinia took part in\n\nthe Conference of Paris, where her ambassador laid\n\nbefore the representatives an able paper on the state of\n\nItaly. In 1.55 the King lost his mother, wife, and\n\nbrother, and was brought to the verge of the grave by\n\nfever. After his recovery, he visited France and\n\nEngland, where he was received with great enthusiasm,\n\nand was created a Knight of the Garter and Grand\n\nCross of the Legion of Honour. In the early part of\n\n1859. the King, whose relations with Austria had been\n\nfor a long time the reverse of friendly, announced in\n\nthe Chamber that a storm was impending, and Count\n\nCavour detailed the grievances of Sardinia against\n\nAustria in a diplomatic circular. Lord Derby's\n\nGovernment used its best endeavours to avert a war\n\nwhich seemed imminent, but without effect. Austria\n\nsummoned Sardinia to disarm, but in vain, and the\n\nAustrian army crossed the Ticino. The Emperor of\n\nthe French dispatched a powerful army to Italy, and\n\nhaving assumed the command, joined the Sardinian\n\nforces, and defeated the Austrians at Montebello,\n\nMay 20 at Palestro, May 30, 31 at Magenta,\n\nJune 4 and at Solferino, June 24, the Emperor and\n\nthe King being present in person. The Austrians\n\nwere expelled from Lombardy, the princes from Naples,\n\nTuscany, Parma, and Modena; and the Treaty of Villa\n\nFranca, concluded July 11, confirmed by the treaty of\n\nZurich, November 10, terminated the war and established\n\nVictor Emmanuel as King of Italy. The Parliament,\n\nassembled at Turin, March 17, 18.1, formally\n\nestablished the title, which was recognized by England\n\nMarch 30, and by France June 24. A treaty for\n\nthe transfer of the seat of government from Turin to\n\nFlorence, and the evacuation of Rome by the French\n\nin two years, was signed September 15, 1864. The\n\nCourt was transferred to Florence in 1865, and the\n\nFrench army was withdrawn from Rome in 1867. In\n\nW66 the King of Italy, making common cause with\n\nPrussia, by a treaty signed May 12, declared war\n\nagainst Austria. The Italian army was defeated by the\n\nAustrians at Custozza, June 24, and the Italian\n\nfleet sustained a reverse off Lissa, July 20 ; but in\n\nconsequence of the success of the Prussians, peace\n\nwas signed at Vienna October 3, by which Venice and\n\nthe territory of Venetia were ceded to Italy, and\n\nVictor Emmanuel made his public entry into Venice\n\nNovember 7. In September, 1873, \"King Victor\n\nEmmanuel visited the Emperor of Austria\n\nat Vienna, and the Emperor of Germany at Berlin.\n\nHis family consists of the Princess Clothilde. Marie I\n\nTherese Louise, born March 2, 1843, and married\n\nJanuary 30, 1859, to Prince Napoleon; Prince Hum-\n\nbert Reuter Charles Emmanuel Jean Marie Ferdinand\n\nEugene, heir-apparent, and Prince of Piedmont, born\n\nMarch 14, 1844 ; Prince Amadeus Ferdinand Marie,\n\nDuke of Aosta (formerly King of Spain), born May\n\n30, 1845, and Princess Maria Pia, born October 16,\n\n1847, and married October 6, 1862, to Louis I., King\n\nof Portugal.\""
