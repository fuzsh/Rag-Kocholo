For the official currency of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, see Maltese scudo.

The lira (Maltese: lira Maltija, plural: liri, ISO 4217 code: MTL) or pound (until ca. 1986 in English, code MTP) was the currency of Malta from 1972 until 31 December 2007. One lira was divided into 100 cents, each of 10 mils. After 1986 the lira was abbreviated as Lm, although the original Â£M sign continued to be used unofficially. In English the currency was still frequently called the pound even after its official English language name was changed to lira.
