However, these are only theoretically non-decimal, as in both cases the value of the main unit is so low that the sub-units are too small to be of any practical use and coins of the sub-units are no longer used.\n\nThe official currency of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta, which retains its claims of sovereignty under international law and has been granted permanent observer status at the United Nations, is the Maltese scudo, which is subdivided into 12 tar√¨, each of 20 grani with 6 piccioli to the grano.\n\nAll other contemporary currencies are either decimal or have no sub-units at all, either because they had been abolished or because they have lost all practical value and not used."
