At its peak, Krak des Chevaliers (a castle in the west of Syria and north of Lebanon) housed a garrison of around 2,000. Such a large garrison allowed the Hospitallers to extract tribute from a wide area. From the 1250s the fortunes of the Knights Hospitaller took a turn for the worse on 08th April 1271, Krak des Chevaliers was captured by the Mamluk Sultan Baibars after a siege lasting 36 days, and then purportedly only by way of a forged letter claiming to be from the Hospitallers' Grand Master that caused the Knights to surrender.\n\nAuger de Balben [or Auger, dit de Balben].......................1159 - 1162\n\nArnaud de Comps.................................................1162 - 1163\n\nGilbert d'Aissailly..................................bf. 19 Jan 1163 - 1170\n\nGaston de Murols................................................1170 - 1172\n\nGérard Joubert de Syrie.........................................1172 - Oct 1177\n\nRoger I des Moulins.............................................1177 - 01 May 1187\n\nBorrell (Provisor et custos)...........................................1188\n\nErmengard d'Asp.................................................1188 - 1190\n\nGarnier de Naplous [Nablus].....................................1190 - af.

It is noted today for it's very well-preserved castle and other early buildings. One might also mention in passing that this is the general region which created the lager beers which have formed much of the basis for modern American beers - the city of Ceské Budejovice (Budweis) is just 35 miles (55 km.) to the southeast. Bavor IV donated the castle and environs to the Order of St. John Hospitallers (the Knights of Malta) at some point between 1382 and c. 1410. The Order, which had maintained a chapter house in the town since 1234, held the locale until it's own dissolution at the end of the 18th century (c. 1400-1798). Strakonice was later took by Bohemia (Austria-Hungary) in 1798.\n\nPhilibert de Naillac.....................................06 May 1396 - 1421\n\nLieutenant; appointed by Pope in Rome.\n\nRiccardo Caracciolo Rossi dei conti di Gerace..........Apr 1383 - 18 May 1395\n\nBartolomeo Carafa della Spina..............................1395 - 25 Apr 1405\n\nNicola Orsini di Campodifiore..............................1405 - 1409\n\nAntonio I di Fluviano de Riviere.........................01 Jul 1421 - 26 Oct 1437\n\nJean II Bonpar de Lastic.................................06 Nov 1437 - 19 May 1454\n\nJacques de Milly (or Jobert de Milly)....................01 Jun 1454 - 17 Aug 1461\n\nPedro Ramon Zacosta [Pietro Raimondo Zacosta]............24 Aug 1461 - 21 Feb 1467\n\nGianbattista Orsini......................................28 Feb 1467 - 08 Jun 1476\n\nFull name: Giovanni Battista Orsini dei conti di Gravina.\n\nPierre III d'Aubusson....................................17 Jun 1476 - 03 Jul 1503\n\nEmeric de Amboise [Aimery d'Amboise, dit Chaumont].......10 Jul 1503 - 13 Nov 1512\n\nGuy de Blanchefort.......................................22 Nov 1512 - 24 Nov 1513\n\nFabrizio Del Carretto dei marchesi del Finale............15 Dec 1513 - 10 Jan 1521\n\nMalta Era 1530-1798\n\nPhilippe de Villiers de l'Isle Adam......................22 Jan 1521 - 22 Aug 1534\n\nAfter six months of siege and fierce combat against the fleet and army of Sultan Suleiman the Magnificent, the Knights were forced to surrender in 1523 and left Rhodes with military honours.

When De Poincy was appointed governor of the French colony on St. Kitts in 1639 he was a prominent Knight of St. John and dressed his retinue with the emblems of the Order. In 1651, the Knights bought from the Compagnie des Îles de l'Amérique the islands of Sainte-Christophe, Saint Martin (1651-1665) and Saint Barthélemy (1653-1667). The Order's presence in the Caribbean was eclipsed with De Poincy's death in 1660. He had also bought the island of Saint Croix (1651-1665) as his personal estate and deeded it to the Knights of St. John. In 1665, the order sold their Caribbean possessions to the French West India Company, ending the Order's presence in that region. Tortuga, an island lying off the north coast of Haiti was a major pirate base for nearly a century (1629-1725). This island was more-or-less the center of operations for the loose-knit buccaneer network known as the \"Brethren of the Coast\", which reached the zenith of its power under Henry Morgan, 1667-1672. Tortuga came nominally to the Knights of St. John from 1653 to 1667 and was later took by France.\n\nGregorio Carafa dei principi della Roccella..............02 May 1680 - 20 Jul 1690\n\nPierre-Adrien de Wignacourt..............................27 Jul 1690 - 04 Feb 1697\n\nRamon III Perellós i de Rocafull.........................05 Feb 1697 - 10 Jan 1720\n\nFull name: Ramon Rabassa de Perellós i de Rocafull Híjar i Vives de Boíl, dels senyors de Benetússer i Barons de Dosaigües.\n\nMarc'Antonio Chigi Zondadari dei marchesi di San Quirico.14 Jan 1720 - 16 Jun 1722\n\nAntónio Manuel de Vilhena , dos condes de Vila Flor......19 Jun 1722 - 12 Dec 1736\n\nRaymond III Despugh......................................16 Dec 1736 - 15 Jan 1741\n\nFull name: Ramon Despuig y Martínez de Marcilla de los condes de Montealegre [Ramon Despuig i Martínez de Marcilla Rocabertí de Dameto i Ram de Montoro, dels comtes de Montenegro i Montoro].\n\nManuel I Pinto da Fonseca................................18 Jan 1741 - 24 Jan 1773\n\nFrancisco Ximenez De Tejada..............................28 Jan 1773 - 09 Nov 1775\n\nFull name: Francisco Ximénez de Tejada de los señores de Sobrarbe y condes de Aragón [Francisco Antonio Ximénez de Tejada y Eslava López de Mirafuentes y Vicuña Zozaya, de los señores de Sobrarbe y condes de Aragón].\n\nEmmanuel II de Rohan-Polduc..............................12 Nov 1775 - 13 Jul 1797\n\nFull name: François-Marie-des-Neiges-Emmanuel de Rohan, comte du Polduc, seigneur de Henleix.\n\nThe decree of the French National Assembly Abolishing the Feudal System (1789) abolished the Order in France, as well as the dues which have been substituted for them, under whatever denomination they are known or collected (even when compounded for), possessed by secular or regular congregations, by holders of benefices, members of corporations (including the Order of Malta and other religious and military orders), as well as those devoted to the maintenance of churches, those impropriated to lay persons and those substituted for the portion congrue, are abolished [The Decree Abolishing the Feudal System, August 11, 1789, J.H. Robinson, ed., Readings in European History 2 vols. (Boston: Ginn, 1906), 2: 404-409]. The French Revolutionary Government seized the assets and properties of the Order in France in 1792.\n\nFerdinand Joseph Freiherr von Hompesch zu Bollheim.......17 Jul 1797 - 26 Aug 1798\n\nFull name: Ferdinand Joseph Hermann Freiherr von Hompesch zu Bollheim. He abandons Malta on 22 Jun 1798, abdicates on 06 Jul 1799. In 1798, Napoleon Bonaparte occupied the island for its strategic value during his Egyptian campaign. Because of the Orders rule prohibiting them to raise weapons against other Christians, the knights were forced to leave Malta. Although the sovereign rights of the Order in the island of Malta had been reaffirmed by the Treaty of Amiens (1802), the Order was unable to return to Malta. In 1577, the German Bailiwick of Brandenburg became Lutheran, but continued to pay its financial contribution to the Order until the branch was turned into a merit Order by the King of Prussia in 1812. The \"Johanniter Orden\" was restored as a Prussian Order of Knights Hospitaller in 1852.\n\nNote: There is really little to be said about Hompesch except that he was undoubtedly the worst Grand Master the Order ever had. The situation of Malta vis-à-vis events in Europe had become steadily more ominous over the previous decade (Rohan had ordered the building of Fort Tigné as yet another part of the protective ring around Valletta) and it was certain that Revolutionary France had its eye on the island. In addition a rather small number of French Knights clearly sympathized with the new regime and worked against the interests of the Order (it should be noted that the vast majority, however, were the most valiant defenders of the Island  in the final siege the Spanish Knights actually remained neutral because Spain was then allied to France). Hompesch, elected because of his diplomatic skills, absolutely refused to believe in a French attack and made no preparations to meet it (even though he was given very reliable reports that one was coming  he preferred to believe it was sailing straight to Egypt). With a motivated force of defenders, ample supplies and a strategy of holding the impregnable city of Valletta while leaving the rest of the island to the French invaders, Napoleons forces would have found themselves in severe trouble. The fortifications of Valletta were surely the most formidable of Europe  fully equipped with some 1400 cannon they would have been extremely difficult for the French army to overwhelm. In addition, Malta only had to hold out for a relatively short time because the British fleet under Admiral Nelson was actively hunting for Napoleons expeditionary force. The French forces had appeared off Malta on 09 June 1798, began landing on the 10th and, on the 12th, after Hompeschs inaction insured its success, accepted the surrender of the Grand Master. Had Valletta held out just a few weeks the situation would have been entirely different: Napoleon was under orders not to risk the Egyptian Expedition if Malta resisted, and the possibility of his fleet being attacked by the British was an ever present danger. In fact, less than two months later, on 01st August, Nelson inflicted a crushing defeat on the French at the Battle of the Nile, sinking or capturing all but two of the French warships (including the huge French 100, LOrient, which blew up taking all the great treasures Napoleon plundered from the Order to the bottom of Aboukir Bay). Had Nelson been able to do this earlier, while Napoleon was tied down attempting to take Valletta, he would have marooned Napoleon and his troops, thus changing European history. In any case, the French garrison on Malta did not last very long: the Maltese revolted in September 1799 and with British help the French surrendered a year later. The island remained a British possession until Malta became independent on 21 September 1964 (it became a republic on 13 December 1974).\n\nThomas di Contara......................................................1798 d. 1805\n\nSiege of Malta 1798-1800: On 19 May 1798, a French fleet sailed from Toulon, escorting an expeditionary force of over 30,000 men under General Napoleon Bonaparte. The force was destined for Egypt, Bonaparte seeking to expand French influence in Asia and force Britain to make peace in the French Revolutionary Wars, which had begun in 1792. Sailing southeast, the convoy collected additional transports from Italian ports and at 05:30 on 9 June arrived off Valletta, the heavily fortified port-city on the island of Malta. Grand Master Ferdinand von Hompesch zu Bolheim, refused Bonaparte's demand that his entire convoy be allowed to enter Valletta and take on supplies, insisting that Malta's neutrality meant that only two ships could enter at a time. On receiving this reply, Bonaparte immediately ordered his fleet to bombard Valletta and on 11 June General Louis Baraguey d'Hilliers directed an amphibious operation in which several thousand soldiers landed at seven strategic sites around the island. The French Knights deserted the order, and the remaining Knights failed to mount a meaningful resistance. Approximately 2,000 native Maltese militia resisted for 24 hours, retreating to Valletta once the city of Mdina fell to General Claude-Henri Belgrand de Vaubois. Although Valletta was strong enough to hold out against a lengthy siege, Bonaparte negotiated a surrender with Hompesch, who agreed to turn Malta and all of its resources over to the French in exchange for estates and pensions in France for himself and his knights. Bonaparte then established a French garrison on the islands, leaving 4,000 men under Vaubois while he and the rest of the expeditionary force sailed eastwards for Alexandria on 19 June. On 02 September, this anger erupted in a popular uprising during an auction of church property, and within days thousands of Maltese irregulars had driven the French garrison into Valletta. Valletta was surrounded by approximately 10,000 irregular Maltese soldiers led by Emmanuel Vitale and Canon Saverio Caruana. The Maltese were armed with 23 cannon and a small squadron of coastal gunboats. Although there was intermittent skirmishing between the garrison and the Maltese, the fortress was too strong for the irregulars to assault. Late in September, a British convoy consisting of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. In mid-September, a squadron of Portuguese ships also had arrived at the island. They included the Príncipe Real, Rainha de Portugal, São Sebastião and Afonso de Albuquerque, and the British ship HMS Lion, all under the command of Tomás Xavier Teles de Castro da Gama, Marquess of Niza. This force had been sent from the Tagus to augment Nelson's fleet, and after a brief stay off Malta continued to Alexandria. The Portuguese ships returned to the blockade of the island in October. Late in September, a British convoy consisting of 13 battered ships under Captain Sir James Saumarez appeared off the island. Survivors of the Battle of the Nile, they were in urgent need of repair and unable to directly assist in the siege. On 12 October, the British ships of the line HMS Alexander under Captain Alexander Ball, HMS Culloden under Captain Thomas Troubridge and HMS Colossus under Captain George Murray joined Niza's ships off Malta, marking the formal start of the blockade. On 24 October, after a ten day passage from Naples, Nelson joined the blockade squadron in HMS Vanguard accompanied by HMS Minotaur. On 28 October, Ball successful completed negotiations with the French garrison on the small island of Gozo, the 217 French soldiers there agreeing to surrender without a fight and transferring the island. 1799 was a frustrating year for the British and Maltese forces deployed against Malta, as efforts to secure sufficient forces to prosecute the siege were repeatedly denied. The British blockade continued to prevent French efforts to resupply Valletta during the early summer of 1800, and by August the situation was desperate: no horses or pack animals, dogs, cats, fowls or rabbits still lived within the city, the cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply. On 03 September, with his men dying of starvation and disease at the rate of more than 100 a day, Vaubois called a council of his officers at which they unanimously decided to surrender. The next day, envoys were sent to the British and in the afternoon General Pigot and Captain Martin signed the agreed terms with Vaubois and Villeneuve. The Maltese were excluded from negotiations entirely, although their commander, Alexander Ball, subsequently became the first Governor of Malta. The terms of the surrender were absolute: the island, its dependencies, fortifications and military supplies and ships were all turned over to British control. The capture of Malta returned control of the central Mediterranean to Britain and was an important step in the invasion and liberation of Egypt from French rule in 1801. An essential condition of the Treaty of Amiens in the same year, which brought an end to the French Revolutionary War, was that Malta be evacuated by the British. Russian Tsar Alexander I had a long standing claim to the island as titular head of the Knights of St. John, and demanded that it was turned over to Russian control before agreeing any alliance with Britain. Prime Minister William Pitt the Younger flatly refused, and the Napoleonic Wars with France began soon afterwards, in part due to the failure of Britain to comply with this tenet of the treaty. The island subsequently remained in British hands until its independence in 1964."
