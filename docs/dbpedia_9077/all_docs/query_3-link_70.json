On the new night, the ATMs of both countries began to issue a single European currency.\n\nBy the end of January, the Maltese lira and the Cyprus pound will be held in parallel with the euro. In Malta, it will be possible to change the euro free of charge until the end of March, and in Cyprus, the exchange of national currencies will continue until the end of June."
