        "text": "Maltese scudo\n\nThe scudo (plural scudi) is the official currency of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta and was the currency of Malta during the rule of the Order over Malta, which ended in 1798. It is subdivided into 12 tari (singular taro), each of 20 grani with 6 piccioli to the grano.\n\nThe loss of Malta in 1798 interrupted the issuing of the Order of St John’s coin. Minting of its coins was not resumed until 1961, since which time the Order has regularly issued new coins as part of its monetary system: 1 Scudo = 12 Tarì = 240 Grani.\n\n1 scudo = 1s 8d (British)\n\n1 scudo = 8c 3m (Maltese)\n\n1 scudo = 19.1 cents (Euro)\n\n1 scudo = 12 tari\n\n1 taro = 1⅗d (British)\n\n1 taro = 6.4m (Maltese)\n\n1 taro = 1.6 cent (euro)\n\n1 grano = ⅓ farthing\n\n12 grani = 1 cent (euro)\n\nDuring the British rule the pound was valued at 12 scudi of the local currency. This exchange rate meant that the smallest Maltese coin, the grano, was worth one third of a farthing (1 scudo = 12 tari = 240 grani). Consequently, ⅓ farthing coins were issued for use in Malta until 1913, alongside the regular British coinage.\n\nThe rate of conversion of the present Order of St John scudo with the Euro is: 1 Scudo = 0.24 Euro; and 1 Tarì = 0.02 Euro. The Order’s new coins after Malta were minted in Rome (1961), Paris (1962) and Arezzo (1963), and was transferred to the Order’s own Mint in 1964.\n\nBritish\n\n1£ = 20s = 240d\n\n1s = 12d\n\nhalf crown = 2s 6d\n\n1crown = 5s\n\nMoney was divided into pounds (£) shillings (s. or /-) and pennies (d.). Thus, 4 pounds, eight shillings and fourpence would be written as £4/8/4d. or £4-8-4d.\n\nThere were:\n\n20 shillings in £1 – a shilling was often called ‘bob’, so ‘ten bob’ was 10/-\n\n12 pennies in1 shilling\n\n240 pennies in £1\n\nPennies were broken down into other coins:\n\na farthing (a fourth-thing) was ¼ of a penny\n\na halfpenny (hay-p’ny) was ½ of a penny\n\nthree farthings was ¾ of a penny\n\nBritish Grain (Habba) ⅓ farthing\n\nOther coins of a value less than 1/- were\n\na half-groat (2d) 6 x 2d = 1/-\n\na threepenny bit (3d) made of silver 4 x 3d. = 1/-\n\na groat (4d) 3 x 4d = 1/-\n\nsixpence (silver) – often called a ‘tanner’ 2 x 6d = 1/-\n\nCoins of more than 1/- but less than £1 in value were\n\na two shilling piece (called a florin) 10 x 2/- = £1\n\na half-crown ( 2/6d) 8 x 2/6d = £1\n\na crown (5/-) 4 x 5/- = £1\n\nten shillings (a half-sovereign) 2 x 10/- = £1\n\na half-guinea (10/6d) 2 x 10/6d = £1/1/-\n\nA £1 coin was called a Sovereign and was made of gold. A paper pound often was called a ‘quid’.\n\nCoins of more than £1 were\n\na guinea (£1/1/-)\n\na £5 coin\n\nMaltese to British"
