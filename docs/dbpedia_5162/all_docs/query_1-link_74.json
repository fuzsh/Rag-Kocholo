        "text": "Aged 39, Andrés Orozco-Estrada is one of the most interesting and sought-after conductor personalities of the younger generation. He has long been a regular guest of the world’s great orchestras, performing with the Vienna Philharmonic, the London Philharmonic and the American orchestras in Philadelphia, Cleveland and Chicago; in May 2017 he makes his debut with the Berlin Philharmonic. Since the 2014/15 season Orozco-Estrada has been chief conductor of the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra and Music Director of the Houston Symphony. Born in Medellín in 1977, he moved to Vienna at the age of 19 to study conducting, and still lives there today. Orozco-Estrada also has an impressive discography, including Stravinsky’s Firebird and Sacre du Printemps, and most recently he released the first CD of his Richard Strauss cycle (including Heldenleben and Macbeth), all with the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra.\n\nwww.orozcoestrada.com\n\nOriginally from Colombia, the soprano Juanita Lascarro began her vocal training in her native city of Bogotá and continued it at the Cologne Music Academy. Since 2002 she has been an ensemble member at the Frankfurt Opera, where she has performed mainly the great Mozart roles, but also Handel, Puccini and Strauss as well as the title roles in Donizetti’s Lucia di Lammermoor and Berg’s Lulu. She has also appeared in operas by Zemlinsky and Henze, in Martinů’s opera Greek Passion and in Leoncavallo’s La Bohème. Regular guest performances have taken her to the opera houses in Vienna, London and Barcelona; at the Deutsche Oper Berlin she sang the role of Daphne (Strauss). At the same time, Juanita Lascarro is a sought-after concert performer whose repertoire ranges from Handel oratorios to Strauss’ Four Last Songs to Kurt Weill. Together with the Twelve Cellists of the Berlin Philharmonic she has sung Bachiana Brasileira No. 5 by Villa-Lobos in Berlin, London and Salzburg.\n\nwww.juanita-lascarro.de\n\nDr. Ralf Kleindiek (SPD) is known for his poised and unpretentious disposition. Having been appointed Undersecretary of State at the Federal Ministry for Family Affairs, Senior Citizens, Women and Youth by the former Federal Minister of Family Affairs Manuela Schwesig on January 8, 2014, he now serves under the new Minister, Dr. Katarina Barley, and has represented the ministry with speeches on numerous podiums and platforms, winning general sympathy. Born in Hameln, Kleindiek studied law in Gießen and subsequently worked at the Federal Ministry of the Interior, in various positions at the Federal Ministry of Justice, and as a State Councilor at the Hamburg Authority for Justice and Equal Opportunities. His departure was unfortunate for Hamburg, but practical for him: the Undersecretary of State lives in Brandenburg with his family, so his commute became significantly shorter. In an interview with the Foundation for German-Russian Youth Exchange last year, he said: “Youth politics must be international; they depend on the mutual experience of young people in different countries.” Now if that isn’t the perfect attitude for a patron at the festival Young Euro Classic…\n\nAfter completing her studies at the Central Conservatory of Music in Beijing and further studies in Graz, the Chinese percussionist Shengnan Hu moved to Berlin, where she completed a performance degree at the Hanns Eisler Academy of Music with distinction in 2011, having studied with Rainer Seegers, Franz Schindlbeck and Li Biao. She then moved on to the Mozarteum in Salzburg, where she was a master student of the percussionist Peter Sadlo.

After the end of the GDR, he was active in leftist youth organizations and joined the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) in 1992. He spent the 1990s studying law at the Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin’s law school, where he earned a doctorate, and working for the PDS as a local politician. In December 2005 Klaus Lederer was elected chair of the Berlin Left Party, a position he held until December 2016. From 2003 to January 2017, Dr. Lederer was a member of the Left Party parliamentary group in the House of Representatives, Berlin’s state legislature, and was its spokesperson on legal policy. Dr. Klaus Lederer has been Mayor and Senator for Culture and Europe in Berlin since December 2016.\n\nChristoph Eschenbach has been closely associated with the Schleswig-Holstein Music Festival for almost two decades. Time and again, the pianist and conductor has rehearsed and performed fascinating programmes with the Festival Orchestra, whose chief conductor he has been since 2004 – their tours have regularly included Young Euro Classic. From 2010 to 2017 Eschenbach has also been the director of the National Symphony Orchestra and the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington DC. The 76-year-old continues to appear on all the world’s major concert stages. During the 2016/17 season, he conducts the Bamberger Philharmoniker, the NDR Elbphilharmonie Orchester, the SWR Symphony Orchestra and the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester Berlin.

In 2015 his first CD was released, featuring the Cello Sonatas by Johannes Brahms.\n\nThe Chinese-American pianist moved to the USA in 1999 to study at the Manhattan School of Music and subsequently at the Curtis Institute of Music with Gary Graffman and at New York’s Juilliard School with Yoheved Kaplinsky, Joseph Kalichstein and Robert McDonald. In 2016 she added a Master of Business Administration from the Columbia Business School.

As Ballet Director and Artistic Director of the Hamburg Ballet, he turned this company into one of Germany’s leading ones. John Neumeier won international acclaim for his combination of traditional ballet with new, contemporary forms. One of John Neumeier’s passions is the support and education of young talent. In 1978, he founded the Ballet School of the Hamburg Ballet. In 2011, John Neumeier took on the position of Artistic Director of the newly-founded National Youth Ballet. John Neumeier has been awarded the German Federal Cross of Merit twice and was named a Chevalier of the Legion of Honor in 2003. He already choreographed a ballet for Young Euro Classic in 2012, and in 2013 and 2014 the National Youth Ballet appeared at the Konzerthaus in two of his choreographies as well.\n\nwww.johnneumeier.org\n\nSomething to be proud of: Dietmar Bär, who plays the character of Freddy Schenk in the Cologne Tatort crime series, was voted the most popular TV investigator in Germany in 2014. He has played the Detective Inspector in over 60 cases since 1997 and won the German Television Award in 2000. Together with Klaus J. Behrendt, he received the Order of Merit of North Rhine-Westphalia in 2015 from Prime Minister Hannelore Kraft. Dietmar Bär, a native of Dortmund, considers it of extreme importance to remain close to his people. As often as he can, the ardent fan of Borussia Dortmund mixes with the fans in the stadium in his black and yellow jersey. His daily life, however, is rather different from the rough big guy with an insatiable appetite for “currywurst” he plays in the Tatort series. Dietmar Bär loves to read, listens to all kinds of music and has developed into a gourmet with vegetarian preferences: “I am too old for cheap wine and bad food.” However, he is not too old for the various social causes he supports: Bär is a founding member of “Tatort – Straßen der Welt e.V.” which supports children’s rights in the Philippines, in Swaziland and Germany. And he supports Young Euro Classic not only as an evening patron, but also as a member of the German Association of Friends of European Youth Orchestras e.V.\n\nThe conductor Patrick Lange launched his international career from Berlin. Here, he was First Conductor at the Komische Oper starting in 2008 before filling the vacant position of General Music Director from 2010 to 2012, with the title of chief conductor. During this time, he conducted important premieres, such as Wagner’s Meistersinger, Dvořák’s Rusalka and Mozart’s Idomeneo. At the same time, Lange made his debut at the Vienna State Opera in 2010, where he has returned regularly ever since, most recently in 2016, when he led Puccini’s Tosca and Tchaikovsky’s Eugene Onegin. He has appeared in Dresden and Hamburg and at the opera houses in Zurich, London, Paris, Seoul and Toronto. Most recently, the 36-year-old conducted a new production of Lulu at the Weimar Opera.

Previously, the comic-strip artist from Soest, Westphalia had already found enthusiastic fans for his chronicles of gay life, for example Silvestertuntenball and Sahneschnittchen. These were followed by volumes such as Superparadise (about Aids) and Sie dürfen sich jetzt küssen (about gay marriage). With an overall circulation of almost seven million books, Ralf König became the world’s most popular author of explicitly homosexual stories. His works have been translated into more than a dozen languages, most recently into Catalan, Gaelic and Polish. The artist, who is 56 today, found another focus for his work in Dschinn Dschinn (2006), which deals with radical Islamism. The same year, he also became noted for his comments on the controversy about the Danish Mohammed caricatures.\n\nwww.ralf-koenig.de\n\nAs a teenager, Gregor Burgenmeister performed as a pianist himself. After graduating from school, however, he decided to leave music-making to others and to turn to another art form instead: film. From then on, his path took him to stations as programmer at the Hamburg Film Festival, as an editor at Studio Hamburg and to various positions in film and television productions. There he learned something essential for a young media professional: how to tell fascinating stories well. It was not least his youthful passion for music that moved him to turn back to the music business professionally. And so, undaunted by the crisis confronting all print media, he founded the monthly magazine concerti in Hamburg in 2005, telling exactly those fascinating stories about classical music and offering extensive calendar listings. In fact, concerti began its development into Germany’s leading classical music magazine from a simple and plausible point of departure: “I wanted it for myself. I was missing such a magazine.”\n\nThe musical world of the Swedish violinist Hugo Ticciati is characterized by infinite curiosity. The 37-year-old brother of the designated chief conductor of Berlin’s DSO, Robin Ticciati, includes literature, philosophy, spirituality and meditation in his programmes, just like dance and kinetic painting. He performs the classical violin concertos, but also delves into contemporary music with verve. Ticciati has works by Takemitsu, Shchedrin, Glass and Lera Auerbach in his repertoire and has also given works by Albert Schnelzer, Sergey Yevtushenko and Tobias Boström their world premieres recently. He is a passionate chamber musician, working with the percussionist Evelyn Glennie, pianists Angela Hewitt and Olli Mustonen and the trombonist Nils Landgren, for example. In addition, Hugo Ticciati is the artistic director of the O/Modernt Kammarorkester, which is in residence at Stockholm’s concert hall Musikaliska.\n\nwww.hugoticciati.com\n\nLike Hugo Ticciati, the British cellist Matthew Barley, born in 1965, is a musical wanderer between worlds, switching effortlessly between classical and improvisation, electronic sounds and pedagogical projects. He has worked with such different artists as Jon Lord (of Deep Purple), Sultan Khan, Django Bates and jazz pianists Julian Joseph and Nikki Yeoh. Barley has performed world premieres of numerous cello works, including some by Detlev Glanert, John Metcalfe, John Woolrich and James McMillan. In 2013 he dedicated himself to Benjamin Britten’s centennial, giving about 100 performances and workshops in the process. In 1997 the cellist founded his ensemble “Between the Notes”, with which he has implemented more than 60 education projects with young musicians. Together with his wife, the violinist Viktoria Mullova, and “Between the Notes” he recorded the CD Through the Looking Glass in 2000, featuring pieces from Alanis Morisette to Miles Davis and George Harrison.\n\nwww.matthewbarley.com\n\n“Poultry farming and boy scout camps” – that is how Jo Schück’s journalistic career began as a reporter for the local newspaper Bergsträßer Anzeiger in Lorsch in Southern Hessen. His search for “Culture and Politics” then led him to Zeit Online, Hit Radio FFH (Frankfurt) and SBS Radio in Sydney. After the Australian capital, he moved to the German one: in 2004 he became a reporter and presenter for Radio Fritz by RBB (Berlin/Potsdam). After an internship with the ZDF, he gained a foothold in its political department, moderating at first for digital TV. When zdf.kultur was founded two years later, Jo Schück was one of its main moderators. In parallel, he provided political documentaries as an author and presenter for the ZDF’s main programme. “Culture and Politics” – since 2014 he has united his two passions in one feature: as the moderator of aspekte on ZDF, together with Katty Salié. Jo Schück lives in Berlin with his family. He studied journalism, philosophy and business administration in Mainz and in Sydney.\n\nThe 26-year-old Hungarian trumpet player Tamás Pálfalvi is making a name for himself as one of the most innovative and creative trumpet players of our times. His first-rate technique, stage presence and dramaturgical skills brought him a first prize at the Fanny Mendelssohn Encouragement Award in 2015. The resulting debut album Agitato with the Franz Liszt Chamber Orchestra combines works by Vivaldi, Telemann and Handel with contemporary composers such as Ligeti, Kagel and Dubrovay – as a matter of course. Pálfalvi would like to expand both the trumpet repertoire and playing technique. He pursues these goals not only by championing new composers, but also by transcribing historical repertoire. Pálfalvi has performed in New York and Tokyo, in Hong Kong, London and Beirut, and with conductors including Christoph Eschenbach, Matthias Pintscher, Peter Eötvös and Zoltán Kocsis.\n\nTamaspafalvi.com\n\nThe violinist Matthias Well, Maria Well’s younger brother, is the winner of several regional, state and federal prizes at the German competition “Jugend musiziert”. As early as 2011 he founded the music group “nouWell cousines” together with several other family members.

Together with Sinem Altan and Özgür Ersoy, she founded Ensemble Olivinn. She also appears as a soloist in the award-winning fairy-tale concert series Kologlan.

Regardless of whether he plays the kettledrum or the darbuka, Salsa or traditional Turkish folklore music, drumset or vibraphone he feels secure to play all kinds of music styles. Nevertheless he is constantly engaged in searching new ways of improving himself and to combine his wide interest in various music styles and instruments. He worked, among others, with Nils Landgren, Robyn Schulkowsky, Steve Hackett (Genesis), Karat, Keiko Abe, Jacob TV, Moritz Eggert and performed with a variety of ensembles and orchestras in Germany, Europe and Asia. From 2010 to 2016 he was studying drums and classical percussion at the Academy of Music and Theatre (HMT) Rostock.

Even as a young girl, she won first prizes as a pianist and composer in Turkey and Germany; she was accepted at the Music Academy Hanns Eisler as a junior student at the age of only 11. Later, she initiated the concert series “Yenilige Dogru – On the Road towards Novelty”, which later resulted in the founding of her ensemble Olivinn, which moves freely between European classical music, Turkish folk music and contemporary sounds. Sinem Altan’s activities are uncommonly broad-ranging: she has been composer-in-residence at the Neukölln Opera; she has set several stories about Keloglan, the Turkish equivalent of Till Eulenspiegel, for the Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin (RSB); and for the Amsterdam Opera she composed a new version of Verdi’s Aida including a gospel choir and oriental percussion.

She came to international attention with the drama production Das Wunder von Berlin, which was nominated for an international Emmy, and proved her great versatility in the political drama Die Spiegel Affäre, among others. A passionate actress who lives for her profession, she is also found on the theatrical stage – after all, that is where her career started: she gathered her first experience during her student days. Since then, she has also appeared at the Salzburg Festival, as an ensemble member at the Basel Theatre and at the Renaissance Theatre in Berlin. Her social engagement includes chairing the board of the award-winning project Findelbaby and being elected to the supervisory board of the Welthungerhilfe (World Hunger Foundation).\n\nThe Russian conductor, who was born in Leningrad in 1957, has been a regular visitor to many of Berlin’s orchestras for many years.

He studied archaeology and history and modestly recounts: “Even if it sounds somewhat immodest, I somehow knew I would make my way in archaeology from my very first semester.” And he was proven right. After receiving his doctorate and post-doctorate degrees in Munich, he became the director of the German Archaeological Institute in Berlin for thirteen years and then its president for another five years. He led numerous excavations in the Middle East and South-Western Asia and especially in Russia, with a focus on Siberia. His research has won several awards.

For 14 years he played Berlin’s inspector Felix Stark on the popular Tatort series, side by side with Dominic Raacke (aka Till Ritter). He gave that role up three years ago – and unlike some others, Aljinovic hung up his handcuffs like a gentleman, without lamenting the fact in the yellow press. After many years of Tatort and many movies, for example with Otto Waalkes, the versatile actor, who can be as silly and playful as he is mindful and profound, is known to almost everyone in Germany. Calm and mindful describes the person Boris Aljinovic well – and gifted with a subtle sense of humour. No wonder: Aljinovic originally wanted to draw comic strips for a living. At the moment, the 50-year-old has taken up stage acting again, produces successful audio books – and prefers to fight wind and waves, often all alone on his sailboat for months, instead of imaginary crooks.\n\nThe young Romanian conductor Gabriel Bebeselea graduated from the Music Academy in Cluj-Napoca with a bachelor’s degree in conducting in 2010, followed by a master’s degree from the Bucharest Music University in 2012.

After the British voted for Brexit, the European capital then had to survive the “Krexit” as well in 2016: Rolf-Dieter Krause, the ARD’s “Mr. Europe” for decades, retired amidst well-earned accolades. “Factually competent, analytically critical, clearly expressive,” the Medium Magazin described him when naming him “Journalist of the Year” in 2012.

In 1990 he finally landed where he belonged: in Brussels. With refreshing openness, he recounts: “At the time, I had no particular views on the European Community. I was simply young and curious.” After an intermezzo as a Deputy Studio Director in Bonn and Head of Programming for the WDR TV in Cologne in 2000, Brussel welcomed him back in 2001 – for 15 years, the rest of his professional life.\n\nThe personal and artistic biography of Cem Mansur could hardly be more cosmopolitan: the British and Turkish citizen was born in Istanbul in 1957 into a multi-national and multi-lingual family.

The chairman of the Musica Group, which consults about the music programmes of the European culture channel ARTE, is also a member of the administrative board of the German Theatre Association and the initiator and editor of numerous television productions in the fields of theatre and music, including theatre films, the ARTE Lounge, The Most Beautiful Operas of All Times and L’Epoque – Epochs of Music. He has been associated with the ZDF for more than 30 years, having started there as a freelancer during his student days. Those took place in Mainz: ethnology, journalism and German literature – a humanist and culture vulture. When the ZDF Theatre Channel was founded in 1999, Wolfgang Bergmann became its associate director, shortly thereafter its director. Ten years later, he restructured the ZDF Theatre Channel into ZDF Culture. In addition, Wolfgang Bergmann was also the founding director of the Academy of Performing Arts in Baden-Württemberg before being appointed coordinator for ARTE within the ZDF in 2012.\n\nNils Landgren is doubtlessly one of Europe’s most successful jazz musicians. Fans and observers of the 61-year-old Swede are already wondering whether his days might have more than 24 hours. Critics have nominated him as the hardest working man in show business. When “Mr. Redhorn,” the man with the red trombone, is not touring with his legendary band Funk Unit or other projects bearing his name, he works as a producer and talent scout or is found passing his know-how on to his students. In the German capital, he has made a name for himself as the artistic director of the JazzFest Berlin. It is not least his versatility which is admired in this musician, who began playing drums at the age of six and discovered the trombone for himself at 13: apart from hardcore jazz, he is devoted to Swedish folk music – or he might record romantic and idiosyncratic Christmas songs, as he did on his album Christmas With My Friends. In cooperation with Doctors without Borders, Nils Landgren’s Funk Unit supports a music education project for children and teenagers in one of the largest slums of Kenya’s capital city of Nairobi. After leading the successful “Classic meets Jazz” projects at Young Euro Classic for three years running, Nils Landgren returns in 2017 for its fourth edition.\n\nwww.nilslandgren.com\n\nOriginally from Tbilisi (Georgia), the pianist Giorgi Mikadze first performed in public at the age of twelve. While still in school, he discovered his love for jazz; during his student days at the Tbilisi State Conservatory he founded his first quartet. After graduating in 2010, he received a scholarship to Berklee College in the USA; he has performed at the jazz festival there, in Montreux and at the Black Sea Jazz Festival in his homeland. He has performed with renowned colleagues such as Roy Hargrove, Dave Liebman, Lee Ritenour, Chris Potter, Matt Garrison, Tia Fuller and Patti Austin. Only recently, Mikadze released an album with Jack DeJohnette, the drummer of the Keith Jarrett Trio. During the spring of 2017 the jazz musician was a fellow at the progressive 18th Street Arts Center in Santa Monica, California. As a composer, he attempts to translate the micro-tonality of Georgian folk music into jazz in an innovative manner.\n\nwww.giorgimikadze.com\n\nLizi Ramishvili, still only 20 years of age, began taking cello lessons as a child in her native city, the Georgian capital of Tbilisi. In the meantime, she has become a student of the Kronberg Academy in the Taunus, Germany, where she studies with Frans Helmerson, and since 2017 at the Haute Ecole de Musique in Geneva, Switzerland. Lizi Ramishvili already looks back on numerous performances, including a solo recital at New York’s Carnegie Hall, a concert with pianist Khatia Buniatishvili and her appearance in a Prokofiev Concerto at the Rostropovich Festival in Moscow. Invitations also took the cellist, who has held a Rostropovich Scholarship for several years, to the Augsburg Mozart Festival, the festival Energy for Life in Vienna, to Beirut and Sochi in Russia.\n\nThe Ensemble Basiani was founded in 2000 under the patronage of the Catholic Patriarch of Georgia. In 2013 it was given the status of a State Ensemble of Georgian Vocal Folk Music. Its name refers to the city of Basiani in the former southwest of Georgia (part of modern Turkey), where an important battle in 1203 AD strengthened Georgian dominance in the region. The Ensemble Basiani draws upon the rich experience of its members, most of whom grew up with vocal music since their earliest childhood. The (male) singers have made it their mission to revive the heritage of traditional Georgian polyphony. They have been invited to renowned festivals in St. Petersburg, Aldeburgh and Kilkenny, to Amsterdam, Lisbon and to New York’s Lincoln Center. The Ensemble Basiani Trio, which appears in Berlin, consists of the upper-voice singer, Sergo Urushadze, the middle voice of Paata Tsetskhladze, and the bass Zurab Tskrialashvili – all of them members of the ensemble for many years.\n\nBassist Ellen Andrea Wang (b. 1986) has distinguished herself as an inventive artist, blending genres in new and unprecedented ways. Her music tastefully blends jazz and pop elements, balancing the lyrical with the rough, the acoustic with the electric, and creating an urban unique sound with a traditional configuration of bass, vocals, drums and piano. Wang is also the founder of the critically acclaimed indie jazz band Pixel. She has toured with Manu Katché’s band and Marilyn Mazur and performed with Sting in 2016. She received the Kongsberg Jazz Festival’s Great Musician Award in 2015, awarded to a musician with a leading position on the Norwegian jazz scene. The Ellen Andrea Wang Trio, founded in 2013, includes some of Norway’s most talented musicians. “A commanding presence in any ensemble she plays in, her soft tone and vocal precision are always counterbalanced with heavy and assertive grooves from her double-bass, interlocking with drummers, jazz, pop and groove alike.” (The Guardian, 2016)\n\nEva Klesse has been hailed as a “shooting star of the European Jazz scene”; one reviewer called her debut album Xenon “the dream debut of a dream band”. The musician from Werl, Germany, trained as a jazz percussionist in Leipzig, Weimar and Paris and subsequently for two years at the New York University. Although she is officially still a student at the Leipzig Academy, the 31-year-old has long formed part of various formations. Apart from the Eva Klesse Quartet, for which she composes herself, these include the Jorinde Jelen Band, the Julia Hülsmann Octet, the Quartett Trillmann and the Trio No Kissing. Her debut album Xenon quickly won the 2015 Echo Jazz in the category “Newcomer of the Year”. Her second album, Obenland, followed in 2016 to equal acclaim.\n\nWhen Björn Atle Anfinsen was 6 years old, he heard Maynard Ferguson on CD. It made him start playing the trumpet. With parents who are classical musicians and great interest in other music such as hard rock, funk, jazz, he got a wide music taste at a young age. In 2014 Björn Atle Anfinsen received the youth scholarship of Gävle Jazzclub and was named Best Soloist at the Swedish Jazz Final in Stockholm; two years later he and his band won the Best Band Award. In 2016 he began studying with Patrik Skogh at the Royal College of Music in Stockholm. During the past year, he has had the opportunity to play with some of Sweden’s best jazz musicians, such as Magnus Lindgren, Robert Ikiz, Nils Landgren, Svante Thuresson, Lill Lindfors, Peter Asplund, and others. In spring 2017, Björn Atle Anfinsen released his first single, Långdans Från Sollerön, and the autumn will see his debut EP on Stockholm Jazz Records, with drummer Robert Ikiz. As a composer, he strives for a mix of modern jazz and the Middle East, with a touch of electronic music.\n\nHow impolite! “He is a man in his prime, running slightly to fat and slowly losing his hair” – thus the Radio Berlin-Brandenburg (rbb) introduces one of its best and most high-profile moderators on its website: Jörg Thadeusz has enough self-irony to grin and bear it with good humour. After all, he recalls, he originally began in radio because in his youth “the most exciting women were interested in guitarists, javelin-throwing athletes and potheads”. If he works only with his voice, his female listeners “might think I’m a guitar-playing, stoned javelin thrower”. Actually, he isn’t anything of the kind, but one of Germany’s best moderators, now present on all wavelengths and channels in sound AND sight, recipient of many awards, “quick-witted and charming too” – that is how the introductory sentence on the rbb website ends. Jörg Thadeusz currently covers the national elections with a new journalistic format entitled “Fahrbereitschaft” (starting on August 15, Tuesdays at 10:15 pm on rbb-TV).\n\nThe British conductor James Judd is the quintessential musical cosmopolitan. At the moment, he is not only chief conductor of the Asian Youth Orchestra, but also leads ensembles in New York, Israel and Korea. Starting in the autumn of 2017, the Slovak Philharmonic in Bratislava will be added to the list. Previously, the conductor worked for many years in New Zealand and Florida. In addition, the 67-year-old dedicates a major part of his time to pedagogical work with young musicians, whether at the Juilliard School in New York, the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia or the national youth orchestras of New Zealand and Australia. Among Judd’s performances in recent years, a performance of Britten’s War Requiem in Bucharest, Orff’s Carmina Burana in the desert at Masada and two concerts opening the Opera House in Dubai stand out. Judd was also involved in three performances during the festival commemorating the 100th birthday of Yehudi Menuhin at Berlin’s Konzerthaus in the spring of 2016.\n\nwww.jamesjudd.net\n\nThe Russian violinist Vadim Repin began his international career when he was still a teenager: at the age of eleven, he gave his debut in Moscow and St. Petersburg in 1982, at the age of 13 his debuts in Berlin, Tokyo and Helsinki followed, and at 14 he first performed at New York’s Carnegie Hall. Ever since, Repin, a native of Novosibirsk in Siberia, has been among the elite of violinists, performing at all the world’s great concert halls, from Mexico City to Madrid, in Amsterdam, Seoul, Taipei and Bangkok. Beyond the classical violin repertoire, Repin also champions new works. Thus, he performed the world premiere of the film music for the silent movie Love (with Great Garbo) of 1927 at London’s Royal Festival Hall in February 2016, written for him by Aphrodite Raickopoulou. For the Trans-Siberian Arts Festival in Novosibirsk, which he founded in 2014, he has commissioned violin concerti from Benjamin Yussupov and Lera Auerbach. Vadim Repin plays a Stradivarius built in 1733.\n\nwww.vadimrepin.com\n\nAs a journalist, Patricia Schlesinger was a reporter, editor and moderator of the ARD show Panorama at the North German Radio (NDR). She headed the ARD Studio for Southeast Asia in Singapore and was its correspondent for the USA in Washington. After returning to Germany, she became the head of the programming areas Culture and Documentaries for NRD Television. Since 2016 she has been the Intendant (General Director) of the Rundfunk Berlin-Brandenburg (rbb). Patricia Schlesinger’s productions have won numerous awards – including the German Film Prize, the Grimme Prize and the Television Prize, an Emmy Award and an Oscar. Patricia Schlesinger is a board member of the Free University Berlin, a member of the board of the Acting Academy “Ernst Busch” and a member of the German Committee for UNICEF. She is married and has one daughter.\n\nThe conductor Ingo Metzmacher needs no special introduction in Berlin. He left a permanent impression a the latest during his tenure as chief conductor of the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester (2007-2010), leading thematic concert cycles dedicated to “The German Soul” or “1909” and introducing moderated Casual Concerts. The 58-year-old Metzmacher commands a huge concert and opera repertoire, with particular focus on 20th-century and contemporary music. Works by Karl Amadeus Hartmann, Hans Werner Henze and Wolfgang Rihm are included, just like Olivier Messiaen, Luigi Nono and Edgard Varèse. At the same time, Metzmacher also champions romantic rarities by Schubert, Humperdinck and Pfitzner. He led a new production of Wagner’s Ring at the Geneva Opera in 2013/14. This spring, the festival KunstFestSpiele Herrenhausen takes place under Metzmacher’s artistic direction for the second time.\n\nwww.ingometzmacher.com\n\nThe French pianist Jean-Yves Thibaudet is not only at home in all the world’s famous concert halls, but also a regular guest in Berlin. Most recently, he appeared here as the soloist in Messiaen’s Turangalîla Symphony at the Musikfest Berlin and performed piano works by Gershwin and Qigang Chen with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester in November 2016. This illustrates the enormous range of the pianist’s repertoire, including Saint-Saëns, Schumann and Grieg as much as Tchaikovsky, Khachaturian, Duke Ellington and Bill Evans. This season, Thibaudet toured through China with the West Australian Symphony Orchestra. At the same time, he was Artist in Residence at the Orchestre National de France, the Vienna Symphony Orchestra and the Colburn School in Los Angeles, where he performed as a soloist and chamber musician and gave master classes. In addition, Thibaudet has a passion for film music, most recently recording Aaron Zigman’s music for Wakefield (2016). He also performed the solo parts in the soundtracks to Atonement (2007) and Extremely Loud & Incredibly Close (2012).\n\nwww.jeanyvesthibaudet.com\n\nThe direction he would go in was clear even before he began his studies – literally: definitely south! He began with a year of community service in Bolivia. Then Andreas Wunn studied political sciences in Berlin and – hungry to see the world – in Tokyo. Full of these impressions, he began his ZDF career in 2002, working as a reporter in the foreign policy department, then moderating the show heute in Europa and, as a substitute, the auslandsjournal. After five years, he became managing editor of the main editorial office, and thus took on the management of all the ZDF information shows. In the meantime, he has been Managing Editor of the ZDF Morgenmagazin since the end of 2016. Before that happened, however, he had to give in to his longing for faraway places one more time: for six years, he was the South American correspondent, heading the ZDF studio in Rio de Janeiro. There he reported on the saving of 33 Chilean mine workers in the Atacama dessert, the football World Cup in Brazil in 2014 and the Olympic Games in 2016. His book Brasilien für Insider became a SPIEGEL bestseller, which is hardly a surprise, given his conviction that “Despite its many social problems – Rio de Janeiro is the most beautiful city in the world to me.” So it all works out: his wife, after all, is Brazilian.\n\nThe Portuguese conductor Pedro Carneiro, born in the capital of Lisbon in 1975, has pursued a double career in music. On the one hand, he is an internationally celebrated percussionist who performs at all the major concert halls between the USA, Japan and Australia. More than 100 world premieres demonstrate his special position as a member of the musical avant-garde, as do his collaborations with the Arditti Quartet, the Tokyo String Quartet and the Chilingirian Quartet. The percussionist has a special love for improvisation, often in combination with live electronics or other innovative technologies. On the other hand, Carneiro has launched a career as a conductor during recent years. The Portuguese Chamber Orchestra (Orquestra de Câmara Portuguesa) was founded at his initiative and has its own concert series at the Centro Cultural de Belém in Lisbon. Not least, the Portuguese multi-talent composes orchestral and chamber music and directs the percussion festival “Bang Crash Splash!” in Lisbon.\n\nwww.pedrocarneiro.com\n\nAnyone appointed to a chair at the Collège de France has lifetime tenure. The Parisian Bénédicte Savoy thus reached the pinnacle of French university careers last year. She completed her doctoral dissertation in 2000 on Napoleon’s art theft in Germany. And since 2003 she has been teaching at Berlin’s Technical University, first as a junior professor, then, for the past eight years, as an honorary professor of modern art history. She has certainly found the subject of her dreams. There is hardly a prize she has not won, hardly a membership in an influential committee she has not been offered. Thus, to name but one example, she is a member of the Berlin-Brandenburg Academy of Sciences. She miraculously finds the energy to do justice to all these positions, all with her signature charm. Having received the Leibniz Prize of the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG) last year, she has now also reached the German pantheon of researchers, and continues to focus particularly on support for young scientists.\n\nThe French conductor Fabien Gabel began his musical career as a trumpet player. He studied at the conservatory of his native Paris, later moving on to studies with Reinhold Friedrich at the Karlsruhe Music Academy. Starting in 2002, Gabel turned exclusively to conducting; in 2003 he made his debut at the helm of the Orchestre National de France. He has returned there regularly ever since and also guest-conducts with other renowned orchestras in Europe and the USA, for example the Orchestre de Paris, the BBC Symphony, the Toronto Symphony and Detroit Symphony Orchestra. In Germany, Gabel has appeared with the Staatskapelle Dresden, the Frankfurt Radio Symphony Orchestra and most recently with the Deutsches Symphonie-Orchester at the Philharmonie in Berlin, where they performed works by Berlioz, Ravel, Dukas and Florent Schmitt in December 2016. In 2015 the 41-year-old conducted the premiere of Bizet’s opera Carmen at the Oslo Opera; furthermore, he recorded a CD of French opera arias together with the mezzo-soprano Marie-Nicole Lemieux.\n\nwww.fabiengabel.com\n\nThe Franco-Russian violinist Alexandra Soumm’s life trajectory took its course from her native city of Moscow to Vienna to Paris, where she lives today. The First Prize at the 2004 Eurovision Contest in Lucerne brought her first success at the age of 15. In the meantime, she has worked with many renowned conductors, including Herbert Blomstedt, Neeme Järvi, Leonard Slatkin, and Thomas Sondergard. She has been invited to the great orchestras in London and Paris as well as Israel, Tokyo, Detroit and Los Angeles. Alexandra Soumm is a passionate chamber musician, participating in master classes in the USA, Venezuela and Brazil, Israel and Japan. The violinist also founded the non-profit organisation “Esperanz’Arts” in 2012, which aims to make classical music available to people in schools, hospitals and prisons.\n\ncami.com\n\nMichael Müller was born in Berlin in 1964 and attended the Secondary School of Economics and Administration after graduating from Middle School. He completed a commercial apprenticeship in 1986. Together with his father, he ran an independent printing house in Berlin’s Tempelhof district until 2011. At the early age of 17, Michael Müller joined the SPD and became an active local politician. From 1989 to 1996 he was a member of the Tempelhof Municipal Council, ultimately becoming chairman of his faction. He has been a member of Berlin’s State Parliament since 1996, elected directly in his district of Tempelhof-Schöneberg since 2001. From 2000 to 2004 he was Chairman of the SPD in Tempelhof-Schöneberg. From June 2001 to November 2011, Michael Müller was Chairman of the SPD Faction in Berlin’s State Parliament. From 2004 to 2012 and again since 2016 he has also been the SPD’s State Chairman. In December 2011 Müller became Senator for Urban Development and the Environment and one of two deputies to the Governing Mayor of Berlin. Michael Müller was elected Governing Mayor in December 2014 and again in December 2016. He is married and has two children.\n\nDuncan Ward already looks back upon an astounding range of musical experience. At 12, he composed his first musical, Alice in Wonderland – and conducted it with his own orchestra at his school in the British county of Kent. Soon after, he founded his own band, “The Grasshoppers”, accompanied silent movies at the piano, became a member of the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain, and was proclaimed “Composer of the Year” at the BBC Competition in 2005. In 2012 Ward became the first conductor to join the Orchestra Academy of the Berlin Philharmonic, as well as Simon Rattle’s assistant. He conducted members of the Philharmonic and its Academy in numerous concerts featuring music by Webern and Boulez and – on the occasion of the centennial in 2013 – Britten, among others. This season brings his debuts with the Orchestras of the Bavarian Radio and the MDR Radio Leipzig, the Vienna Radio Symphony Orchestra and the Ensemble Intercontemporain in Paris. Duncan Ward conducts the Ensemble Modern at world premieres of works by Isabel Mundry and Manfred Trojahn.\n\nwww.duncan-ward.co.uk\n\nSophie Pacini, a 26-year-old native of Munich, made her concert debut at the age of nine, playing Haydn’s Concerto in D-Major. At the age of ten, she began studying with Karl-Heinz Kämmerling in Salzburg, adding further studies with Pavel Gililov later. One important supporter was Martha Argerich, whom she played for spontaneously at an Italian hotel, whereupon the prominent pianist invited her to her festival in Lugano in 2010. Sophie Pacini has performed at the Ruhr Piano Festival, at the Lockenhaus Chamber Music Festival and the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Festival. This season, the daughter of an Italian professor of literature has been invited as a soloist with the Gewandhaus Orchestra Leipzig, the Bournemouth Symphony and the Tonhalle Orchestra Zurich. She also released her fourth CD featuring works by Beethoven and Liszt; her previous solo albums covered Schumann, Liszt and Chopin, and she also released a CD with piano concertos by Mozart and Schumann. In 2014 Sophie Pacini won an Echo Classic Award.\n\nwww.sophie-pacini.com"
