        "text": "Which bands do you think provided the best? These could be solo albums from members but mainly interested in actual bands that came from them, whether they be side projects or spin off bands after the original band finished.\n\nHere's an example:\n\nThe Byrds: Flying Burrito Brothers, CSN(Y), Dillard and Clark, Desert Rose Band, plus loads of great solo albums from McGuinn, Clark, Crosby, Parsons and others.\n\nFun Topic! Here's a few.....\n\nJefferson Airplane: Hot Tuna, Jefferson Starship.\n\nGrateful Dead: Dead & Co., The Other Ones, Phil & Friends, Rat Dog, Old and in the Way.\n\nTalking Heads: Tom Tom Club.\n\nAllman Brothers: Gov't Mule, Great Southern.\n\nYes: actually lead to two simultaneous touring versions of Yes for a while.\n\nGreen River gave birth to both Mudhoney and Pearl Jam, and Pearl Jam itself has some great spinoffs such as Brad, Temple of the Dog and Mad Season.\n\nAlso: Kingfish, Jerry Garcia Band, New Riders of the Purple Sage, Legion of Mary, Bobby & the Midnights, Reconstruction, Garcia & Saunders, Mickey & the Hartbeats, Diga Rhythm Band, Keith and Donna Band, etc\n\nHenry Cow.\n\nFred Frith was in Art Bears, Massacre, Skeleton Crew...\n\nTim Hodgkinson was in The Work, Momes, God...\n\nJohn Greaves was in The Lodge.\n\nChris Cutler was in Art Bears, Cassiber... and together with Dagmar Krause and Lindsay Cooper in News From Babel.\n\nAll excellent albums.\n\nBrilliant and unorthodox!\n\nEven with that very comprehensive list I believe you're still missing a few.\n\n……and Missing Man Formation\n\n(everyone hates Vince)\n\nI thought The Knitters were a very nice spinoff from X. Also Porno For Pyros from Jane's Addiction, especially the 'Good Gods Urge' album. It's funny OP, the Burrito Brothers were the first band that came to mind for me too.\n\nI'd argue for the Grateful Dead the best one they had was Jerry Garcia Band (personally, I prefer them to the Dead).\n\n(Some key names in this extended interrelated spin-off of a spin-off mess, in bold)\n\nThe Homosexuals ->\n\nIci La Ba\n\nSir Alick and The Phraser\n\nL Voag\n\nGeorge Harrassment\n\nL Voag ->\n\nAmos\n\nAmos & Sara\n\nAmos & Co.\n\nAmos & Superslicks\n\nNancy Sesay and The Melodaires\n\nThe Just Measurers\n\nThe Tesco Bombers\n\nThe Aaron Tenecil Singers\n\nComrad’ Oleau\n\nVicki Durango\n\nNarki Brillans\n\nRon Dealo\n\nVic Surf & The Villians\n\nThe Fear Merchants\n\nNapalm Timesavers\n\nKlak Klak Moguls\n\nLepke B. ->\n\nGus Coma\n\nMilk From Cheltenham\n\nLeonard Aspen & Roger Boulding\n\nModern ****\n\nDie Trip Computer Die\n\nXentos ‘Fray’ Bentos ->\n\n1000 Cars Before Zero\n\nPu Pao In Chinese Clothing\n\nPerfect Vacuum\n\n2 Square Y?\n\nUnhappy Fly\n\nFront Line Assembly spawned several successful offshoots. Probably all plugged-into the same electrical outlets of the same studio at different times.\n\nLeigh Nash and Zoe Johnston have flitted around like bees, pollinating that garden a little further out as well.\n\nZappa/The Mothers Of Invention:\n\nLittle Feat (Lowell George, Roy Estrada)\n\nCaptain Beefheart And The Magic Band (not exactly a spinoff, but several Mothers played with Beefheart after leaving the band, plus Frank producing Trout).\n\nGeronimo Black (Jimmy Carl Black, Bunk and Buzz Gardner, Denny Walley)\n\nRuben & The Jets (Motorhead Sherwood, plus Frank produced the first album as well)\n\nFlo & Eddie\n\nGeorge Duke\n\nJean-Luc Ponty\n\nMissing Persons (Terry Bozzio, Patrick O’Hearn, Warren Cuccurullo)\n\nSteve Vai\n\nThe Fowler Brothers\n\nMike Keneally\n\nThe Grandmothers of Invention\n\nProject Object\n\nBanned From Utopia\n\nAdrian Belew (and all of his bands/collaborations by extent)\n\nPatrick O’Hearn\n\nWild Man Fischer\n\nAnd that’s just off the top of my head.\n\nNirvana has branches going for Krist Novocelic including Sweet 75, Eyes adrift, Giants in the Trees and Third Secret. Grohl could be a whole tree in himself, with the Foo Fighters, Them Crooked Vultures, Probot. The Foo Fighter branch then extends to Taylor Hawkins with Chevy Metal, Taylor Hawkins and the Coattail Riders, and The Birds of Satan. Chris Shiflett of the Foo Fighters has a solo career, and Chris Shiflett and the Dead Peasants."
