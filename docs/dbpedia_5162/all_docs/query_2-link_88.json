        "text": "This has been raked over a lot already, so I'll mention some Japanese bands.\n\nYMO (Yellow Magic Orchestra)\n\nI was going to say: Unicorn (Japanese band) - but they still had their original keyboard player for their first album, and she hasn't released a solo album that I know of. However, their classic period membership has all has solo albums. Drummer Koichi Kawanishi didn't write much during their initial period, but has become one of their most prolific songwriters since reformation.\n\nSadistic Mika Band. Again going for the glory years lineup. Note that Mika recorded a solo album in the UK, though this is not well publicised. I had to go to Discogs to check, but all members from all eras of the band appear to have solo albums. This band includes Yukihiro Takahashi who was also a member of YMO.\n\nTama. A difficult band to search on as they share their name with the drum company and the Japanese word for 'ball'. But, I have confirmed solo albums for each member.\n\ndiscogs has one listed from 2013 and a few collobarations with Karl Jenkins\n\nMike Ratledge\n\nso every member from Soft Machine I and II (with Elton Dean and Hugh Hopper) released solo albums"
