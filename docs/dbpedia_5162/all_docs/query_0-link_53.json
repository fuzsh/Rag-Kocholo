Over an hour of outstanding experimental rock music performed by the Henry Cow original lineup: Dagmar Krause (vocals), Fred Frith (guitar, violin, xylophone), Lindsay Cooper (bassoon, flute), Tim Hodgkinson (organ, sax), John Greaves (or Georgie Born) (bass, cello), and Chris Cutler (drums). Henry Cow's natural habitat was the stage and the real-time pressure of public performance, because it was there that the music could live, breathe and evolve. All music taken from the original radio tapes and re-mastered by Bob Drake. The album contains printed inner sleeves with full notes by Frith, Cutler and Hodgkinson, and photos.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nRER HC20\n\n\"Further pieces uncovered since the release of the 18-CD box set that fills in parts of the story still undocumented-even on the bootleg circuit. A further collection of missing pieces uncovered since the release of the 18 CD Henry Cow Box that fills in parts of the story still undocumented (even on the bootleg circuit), Glastonbury, Chaumont, Bilbao and the Lions of Desire contains: The earliest and only known stage recording of the band as it was in June 1972 (Martin Ditcham, Fred Frith, John Greaves and Tim Hodgkinson) at the first Glastonbury Fayre. The recording is quite clean, though the mix heavily favors bass and guitar, which in a way makes it of special interest, both musically and historically. The brief two-week iteration of Henry Cow from April 1978 that featured Fred, Tim, Chris and Phil Minton, and an eclectic program that included a lot of Westbook/Orkhestra materials, none of which has been released before. Taken from a concert in Bilbao in 1977, some otherwise unrecorded compositions from the late Cow repertoire bound into a typical mash up of different compositional snippets. Further unusual extracts from the Chaumont concert in 1976, as well as a brief studio moment captured by a film crew during the recording of Half Awake, Half Asleep, in 1973. This collection supplements the 19-volume Henry Cow Redux Box set released in 2019.

In the chronology, Concerts came between In Praise of Learning (1975) and Western Culture (1978) -- that is, after Virgin had lost interest in releasing any more Henry Cow studio records and before the band quit to make one of its own. It was also the year of the \"merger\" with Robert Wyatt for a series of concerts in which compositions were shared -- the last show, in Rome, was also Robert's last public performance. From its earlier records, the band was known for its rather complex compositional work. This double-LP for the first time gave serious space to the improvisations that accounted for maybe a third of any of its lengthy stage performances.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nRER VHC3\n\n2022 repress. ReR Vinyl present a reissue of Henry Cow's In Praise Of Learning, originally released in 1975. A landmark in the history of European experimental rock, the third \"Cow\" work, originally released on Virgin in 1975, represents the second act of joined forces between Henry Cow and Slapp Happy, and the first fully integrated appearance of Dagmar Krause. In Praise Of Learning is a unique piece of art, showing perfect unity of political content, with rock complexity, extended song form and free noise explorations. An impressive array of new compositions, including Tim Hodgkinson's masterwork \"Living In The Heart Of The Beast\" and Fred Frith's \"Beautiful As The Moon, Terrible As An Army With Banners\". An extraordinary set of music, performed by an amazingly rich line up: Dagmar Krause, Lindsay Cooper, Fred Frith, Tim Hodgkinson, John Greaves, Chris Cutler, Peter Blegvad, Anthony Moore, and guests: the great Mongezi Feza, Geoff Leigh, and Phil Becque.

This was the first time together on record for Fred Frith, Tim Hodgkinson, Chris Cutler, John Greaves, and Geoff Leigh. An extension and fusion of the key influences of Soft Machine and Frank Zappa, the album is packed full of extraordinary tunes, complex but never pompous arrangements, and great improvisations.

ReR Vinyl present a reissue of Henry Cow's Unrest, originally released in 1974. Dating from 1974, and following on from the re-release of Leg End, this is the second in the label's series of vinyl reissues of the original Virgin albums. Geoff Leigh had left the group and Lindsay Cooper joined on bassoon, oboe, flute, and soprano sax. The mix was more \"live\" than Leg End, with the drums much more up front. The first half is highly composed material, with some of the Cow's best loved tunes, like \"Half Asleep Half Awake\" and \"Bittern Storm Over Ulm\". For the second half the material was all written in the studio, using loops, varispeed tapes and electronics, and superimposing live improvisation and composed passages.\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nLP\n\nRER VHC4\n\n2021 repress.

This collection offers a major retrospective of one of Britain's most resilient and elusive bands -- and a redress to the rather over-tidy story told on their five officially released LPs. Like Frank Zappa or Harry Partch, Henry Cow were mavericks, working without compromise at the edge of their field and systematically breaking the rules and conventions that restrained it. In the 40 years since they disbanded, their work has acquired a formidable reputation, leading finally to this definitive collection -- which replaces a chaotic mass of degraded bootlegs with properly mastered, carefully selected and thoroughly annotated lost projects, compositions and performances.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n5CD BOX\n\nRER HC42\n\n$85.00 NOT IN STOCK\n\n\"Dagmar Krause, Fred Frith, Tim Hodgkinson, Chris Cutler, Lindsay Cooper, John Greaves, Georgie Born, Geoff Leigh.

Limited edition. A substantial collection of all-new material that puts the depth and breadth of the work of one of the most controversial and edgy of the British bands of the '70s into an altogether new perspective. Even at 10 discs it still represents only the tip of the iceberg, but even this will oblige the histories to be amended. Henry Cow was a band viewed by almost all its contemporaries as outsiders, but embraced equally on the art fringes of rock, jazz and contemporary music (as evidenced by the festivals and venues at which they appeared) as innovators and mavericks. It was also a band that walked the talk, finessing its way out of a stifling commercial contract with Virgin and then taking control of every aspect of its life and appearances, remaining unfashionably political and evenly divided in gender (band and roadcrew) until the end. The music was extreme, often complex, constantly changing and driven, on the one hand, by an intense dialogue between craft and tight-knit composition and, on the other, radically open improvisation and experimentation - all expressed through a deep root in popular music and rock. These nine CDs embody some extraordinary and prescient music; then there is the DVD, 80 minutes of the 1976 band in performance - the only known video recording in existence, professionally made, multi camera and unseen since its original broadcast. Last but not least, there is a great deal of historical documentation in two 60 page booklets: photographs, posters, memorabilia, facsimiles -- as well as a complete biography and a series of specially written essays, recollections, histories and commentaries on the compositions by all the members of the band, and a few close friends. This 40th anniversary collection comes in two sturdy limited edition boxes, one covering the period between 1971 to 1976 and the other (Vol.2, which includes the DVD) following through to the end in 1978.\" \"Volume 1 of the definitive collection of unreleased recordings, unrecorded compositions, one-off events, radio and concert recordings.

Remixed and re-mastered from the original Swedish radio tapes. Henry Cow were never going to fit in. Their compositions were way too composed and their improvising was way too improvised -- a tendency that only got more extreme as time went on, as these recordings from 1976 and 1977 demonstrate. Stockholm and Göteborg fills in some of the missing history between In Praise of Learning (1975) and Western Culture (1978) and offers music that has not been heard on record until now. First is Tim Hodgkinson's late and fiendishly complicated epic composition 'Erk Gah' (a working title), that took many months of sweat to learn and resolutely eschews any hint of riff, solo or modular assembly. At the other extreme, are the two wide-ranging improvisations built around heady extended instrumental techniques, aleatorics, quotations, more-or-less randomly inserted prepared materials and a blithe disregard for genre rules. Between constantly shifting ground, are a straight-ahead version of Phil Ochs' 'No More Songs' (one of only two covers ever performed by the band), an unreleased composition by Fred Frith, and a version of the 'Ottawa Song' -- a typical live set from that period. Finally, Stockholm is a snapshot of a band of exceptional talents having fun. And it reflects what the studio albums could not -- that Henry Cow's natural habitat was the stage -- and the real-time pressure of public performance -- because it was there that the music could live and breathe. And evolve. Stockholm and Göteborg is the first volume of a 9CD and one DVD set of unreleased material commemorating the band's 40th anniversary.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\n2CD\n\nRER HC5/6\n\n2006 remastered version, replacing the old ESD version. \"Originally released in 1976, this collection offers a snapshot of Henry Cow as audiences would have heard it in the year before.

When the double LP was reissued as a CD, the Henry Cow side of the long deleted Greasy Truckers album was added -- 5 surprisingly accessible but abstract studio pieces recorded in an afternoon in 1973 -- recovering yet another side of the group's rapidly evolving vocabulary. This new edition, repackaged and carefully re-mastered by Bob Drake, completes our definitive edition of the group's officially released recordings.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nRER HC3\n\n\"This is the third in our series of classic re-issues, following on from Leg End and Unrest. In Praise... was produced in 1975 by a new version of Henry Cow after they had merged with cult Euro-popsters Slapp Happy, and then split apart again. The process unleashed on their music the extraordinary voice of Dagmar Krause, as songs became a major component of the music for the first time. From the opening track 'War' -- a Moore/Blegvad composition covered by The Fall on the 1993 'Middle Class Revolt' album -- we are thrown into a black comedy, repeated laughter in odd time signatures, and a great Mongezi Feza trumpet solo. The centrepiece of the album, Tim Hodgkinson's 'Living In the Heart of the Beast', is justly famous; its an extraordinary 20 minute epic which manages to fuse Messiaen-like organ with vast fuzz guitar tunes, complex arrangements and revolutionary lyrics. This is the first time In Praise of Learning has been available on CD in the original mix, and it has been carefully re-mastered -- for many years only a poorly mastered remix was available. This album is essential for fans of Henry Cow, the Canterbury/Soft Machine school, and all those interested in challenging music.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nRER HC1\n\nThe Henry Cow catalog is now available again in the US, via ReR (note that HC1, 3 & 4 are actually old pressings on the now defunct East Side Digital label). Featuring Fred Frith, Chris Cutler, John Greaves, Tim Hodgkinson and Geoff Leigh. \"At last available on CD in the original mix, this is the classic first album from the band who invented a new genre, changed music forever and carved out a permanent place in rock history. Henry Cow were among the first bands signed to Richard Branson's fledgling Virgin label in 1973, on the recommendation of Soft Machine's drummer Robert Wyatt, who described them at the time as 'my favourite band in the world'. The record with the sock on the cover made a huge impact at the time, forging on from where Soft Machine and Frank Zappa had left off. The music was incredibly dense, complex yet melodic progressive rock, with a large dose of wacky English humour.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nRER HC2\n\n\"This is the second in our series of definitive reissues of the original Virgin Albums, dating from 1974. By the time Unrest was made, Geoff Leigh had left the group and Lindsay Cooper joined on bassoon, oboe, flute, and soprano sax. The mix is more 'live' than Legend, with the drums much more to the fore. The first half of the album is fully composed material, with some of the Cow's best loved tunes, 'Canterbury' anthems like 'Half Asleep Half Awake' and 'Bittern Storm Over Ulm'. For the second half the material was written in the studio, using loops, varispeed tapes and electronics, and superimposing live improvisation and composed passages. The compositions are poised half way between classical and rock, with Bartok and Duke Ellington re-figured for rock instruments, and there is still a residual Soft Machine influence, echoed by the gorgeous sound of Fred Frith's fuzz guitar and Tim Hodgkinson's fuzz organ. The abstract grooves laid down by Chris Cutler's drumming, and John Greaves' sprung bass, are the stuff of legend, and Lindsay Cooper adds a unique voice, with her funky bassoon and pungent oboe playing. First heard live on the John Peel show in 1974, this music is classic, historic and still relevant. This re-issue has been carefully 24 bit re-mastered with a new booklet, photos and documentation.\"\n\nArtist\n\nTitle\n\nFormat\n\nLabel\n\nCatalog #\n\nCD\n\nRER HC4"
