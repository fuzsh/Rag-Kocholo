        "text": "January begged for cold music, and though that might otherwise translate to ultra-minimal house or techno, drone or serialist classical, last month we enjoyed a modest chill-- perfect for evocative Scandanavian electronica, clicks and motive rhythmic patterns from percussion fashioned from ice, and introverted avant-pop. One reason things seemed not so chilly was the growing notion that 2007 is going to be a great year for music: Deerhoof, Marnie Stern, Rhys Chatham, and Panda Bear have dropped early hints that the next 11 months are going to be good for anyone who likes their \"rock\" music brilliantly colored and creative. I saw bands in the past month that have very little problem using bits of Boredoms or Slayer or Philip Glass as part of an unspoken promise to take advantage of every impulse, every terabit of cultural data, in the name of making glorious noise (and not necessarily Noise). It could be that information overload has found its time, as minimalism crashes headfirst into instant gratification and ADHD, producing music that's organized into magnificent crystals of movement, but is anarchic as a matter of practice. Or it could just be global warming, but I'll get on with the column before someone ruins the party.\n\n__Live\n\n__\n\nKarlheinz Stockhausen: Hymnen [San Francisco Tape Music Festival, January 28, 2007]\n\nOver three days in January, the annual San Francisco Tape Music Festival (organized by the fine folks at SFSound) attracted the artsy masses with music by such luminaries as James Tenney, Brian Eno, Gyorgy Ligeti, and Stockhausen presented alongside local composers Matt Ingalls, Moe! Staino, and MaryClare Brzytwa. For each show, the lights were turned off as pieces were performed from a mixing board at the center of venue, amongst the surrounding listeners, and though sitting still for an hour in the dark listening to generally pretty alien sounding music might not be your idea of fun, the 360-degree, 20-speaker surround sound turned what might have been an exercise in disorientation into a perfect vehicle for letting your mind run off and into the music (or lots and lots of drugs).\n\nStockhausen's Hymnen (1967) was the finale of the festival, and in light of the recent upswing in highly eclectic DJ mixes, seemed especially relevant. The German composer created Hymnen during the mid-60s, after his groundbreaking electro-acoustic/orchestral works Kontakte, Mixtur and Mikrophonie, wherein he used electronic sound to modulate and/or spur on live classical musicians (though using a fixed score rather than improvisation). With Hymnen, Stockhausen transcribed various national anthems (or \"Hymnen\" in German) for orchestra, and used them as part of a vast bank of sounds and recordings-- including his own speaking voice-- that could in turn by mixed during a performance. The four channels of sound in Hymnen, though clearly denoted on the score, were manipulated in much the same way a DJ \"manipulates\" records; that is, each performance has the potential to be drastically different from any other, as whomever is working the board can choose the emphasize or de-emphasize any of the pre-recorded sounds in a way that unlike collage music, proceeds forward via sonic metamorphosis rather than simple combination. Or, think of it like some abstract version of beat-matching and transition rather than a bunch of noise.\n\nThe board operators for the SFTMA were Ingalls (Regions I & II) and Cliff Caruthers (Regions III & IV), and just like DJs showcasing vastly different sets during any given night, they exploited the possibilities Hymnen gives the performer. Ingalls style was precise and considered, though hardly stationary: the turning band static and sine-like tones that opened the first Region sounded like the onset of a dream. As a cheering crowd appears here, and fragments of one of the anthems there, the roar of a jet engine underneath, it was easy to fall completely under the spell of the music. I looked at the score as Ingalls worked the 20 channels available to him, and wondered how this stuff was possible using what little instruction I saw. After the show, I had the chance to look at the score more closely-- and was even more baffled. The brief melodic cues and anthem transcriptions offered the barest music indications, and I have to suppose Hymnen demands at least as much from its performer as it did the composer.\n\nCaruthers' style was decidedly more \"active\". That is, his hands moved frantically at times, kept completely still at others, rattled the table a bit throughout the second half of the show. Indeed, some of the higher pitched electronic sounds fried the speakers a little, though that could very well have been on the source recordings. In any case, Caruthers made dizzying work of Hymnen. Afterwards, I actually heard one audience member bemoaning the restless panning, as points of Region III bounced from left to right, back to front in a way more suited to Zaireeka than Stockhausen. It seemed pretty cool to me, though sitting right next to the board while everything was happening gave me an added visual stimulant. After it was all over, it felt as if walking into the daylight after a particular jarring, visually and emotionally intense movie. It was kind of hard to believe the outside world was still there.\n\n///\n\n__ Best Record I Heard Last Month__\n\n\"Blue\" Gene Tyranny: Out of the Blue [Lovely Music; 1977; r: Unseen Worlds; 2007]\n\nTyranny (born Robert Scheff) may be better known to some as a writer rather than a musician, as his music critique and analysis has appeared in the All Music Guide, Newmusicbox.com, and liner notes for many CDs. However, the Texas-born composer is also responsible for this amazing record (among many other, varied works) from 1977, an eclectic pop/country/funk/sonic tone poem record that find precisely zero company in any genre I can think of. \"Next Time Might Be Your Time\" is a sweet, country-pop song that reminds me a little of the McGarrigle Sisters French folk-pop records from the mid-70s (especially due to Patrice Manget's vocals), but Tyranny's array of synthesizers give it a feel that I can only describe as nostalgic-futuristic. It's like the kind of country music they should have been playing A Clockwork Orange, except with no irony or dark edge. \"For David K.\" is completely different: Zappa-ish fusion funk, though again featuring deceptively attractive melodies and chord changes. \"Leading a Double Life\" is a gorgeous, almost hymnal ballad that wouldn't sound out of place on a Judee Sill record, while the lengthy \"A Letter From Home\" (\"scored for voices and electro-acoustic instruments\") is like an abstract radio program with narration by Kathy Morton Austin from Tyranny's text (\"in the lighthearted style of a letter from an unnamed friend\"). The personal, modestly sentimental words, interspersed with female soprano refrains and delicate instrumental accompaniment remind me a little of Brian Wilson's \"Mt. Vernon and Fairway\" piece from the Beach Boys' Holland. They share whimsy, but Tyranny's piece is more fleshed out-- and much prettier.\n\n///\n\nWinter Songs\n\nAnders Ilar: Ludwijka [Merck; 2006]\n\nSwedish minimal house producer Ilar released two full-lengths last year: one was the fine Nightwidth compilation of recent singles, and other this limited edition LP of new material. Named after his hometown in Sweden, Ludwijka is gray-ish, cold music, though like a lot of his more straightforward stuff, has a mysterious edge to it. There are beats here, though they're suffocated and muffled-- not completely unrelated to some of Ilar's more straightforward house stuff, though generally more introverted. The source material for the eight untitled tracks (listed only by their place on vinyl, e.g. \"a1\", \"a2\", etc) is actually samples of Ilar's own music, going back to his childhood, so the isolated, insular feel isn't surprising. Nevertheless, even the dead of winter can be evocative: perhaps play this alone, and what seems shadowy and abstract at first becomes mystical, almost precious.\n\nTerje Isungset: Igloo [Simax; 2006]\n\nNorwegian percussionist Isungset makes cold, icy music with cold, icy ice. That is, he fashions his own instruments from ice, recorded in Igloos near the famed \"ice hotel\" in Sweden, collaborates with vocalist Sidsel Endresen, and makes music that is almost too perfect for the dead of winter. The percussive noises and tones are sometimes hollow clicks and pings, like hearing heavy glass cylinders as drumsticks; elsewhere are icicle necklaces being scraped over a dry, metallic surface, or bell-toned gongs and deep mallet percussion-- imagine a bass marimba made from sculpted ice. At times, even with the sparse, usually wordless vocals, things get a bit monolithic. Igloo (released last year in Norway) isn't the kind of the record that beckons my ears with soothing melodies, or even pristine ambience. To a fault, it sounds like winter, but then I'm not sure perfectly encapsulating your environment is actually a criticism in art.\n\n///\n\nReissues Go Last\n\nNews From Babel: Sirens and Silences/Work Resumed on the Tower/Letters Home [ReR Megacorp; 2006]\n\nNews From Babel was a collective from the mid-80s featuring Chris Cutler (Henry Cow, Art Bears), Lindsay Cooper (Henry Cow), and Zeena Parkins (Skeleton Crew, John Zorn, Bj√∂rk), and played music that was very much in the vein of Art Bears progressive art song. In fact, Art Bears' vocalist Dagmar Krause was a frequent guest on their records, recently remastered and reissued as a box set on Cutler's ReR imprint. For anyone into later period Henry Cow, Slapp Happy or AB, this stuff is practically required listening. Furthermore, Cooper's music (Cutler wrote \"texts\") is often more delicate than what you might expect given the immediate history of the players involved. The production is arguably not as adventurous as on the Art Bears records, but Parkins' harp lends the songs a quality unlike anything else in the extended Cutler/Krause/Cooper canon, and there's a strange sweetness in much of News from Babel's music I love. Mind you, this isn't especially evident in the \"Contraries\" single included with first editions of the box (originally from a 1984 7\"), a Krause-sung piece featuring Cutler's subtle marimba very much in the vein of Art Bears' archest (and harmonically most interesting) stuff.\n\nKoenjihyakkei: Viva Koenji! [God Mountain; 1997; r: Skin Graft; 2006]\n\nKoenjihyakkei (or Hundred Sights of Koenji) is a band to end all bands. At least they used to be: Tatsuya Yoshida's (Ruins, Korekyojinn) large-scale planetary rock orchestra-- your usual bass/drums/guitar/keyboard combo augmented by a choir of female sopranos-- played music in the mid-90s that built symphonic cathedrals of sound on top of Ruins' already dizzying, maximum detail shredding. This record (originally issued as II on the seminal Japanese avant-rock label God Mountain) contains some of Yoshida's finest moments, from the dizzying, opera-roar opener \"Grembo Zavia\" to the metallic, piano-killing \"Guoth Dahha\". At the time, I'd never heard music more extreme, though these days bands like Orthrelm and Flying Luttenbachers are moving things forward a few inches-- at least as far as volume and speed. However, try singing along to any of this stuff (especially Aki Kubota's audience-flattening soprano leads), and realize Koenjihyakkei's vocals may never be matched. These days, the band and Yoshida have calmed slightly, opting for more nuanced shades of prog. It's not surprising: Viva Koenji leaves little room for improvement. Note: these guys come to NYC, Chicago, and Toronto in May.\n\nCamberwell Now: All's Well [Recommended; 1992; r: 2007]\n\nCamberwell Now was the band drummer/vocalist Charles Hayward formed in the early 1980s after This Heat fell apart. Also comprised of bassist Trefor Goronwy and Stephen Rickard (using an assortment of field recordings, electronics and various recording fucker), CN would initially seem very much in the vein of This Heat, and while it's true that any band featuring both Hayward's voice and drumming is going to sound at least a little like TH, to my ears, Camberwell Now were more \"refined\". That's hardly to say they were better, as in general the rock noise is toned down in favor of moody, textural sounds. Often, the songs feature no real drumming or riffs at all, rather sounding like music to play while standing alone in an Irish field, or overlooking the ocean from cliffs, such is the general melancholy of the music, and Rickard's subtle use of sounds, both natural and manipulated (in that way, perhaps recalling Art Bears). Still, stuff like \"Daddy Needs a Throne\", \"Working Nights\", and \"Green Lantern\" pounds, albeit with a deceptively light touch (via Hayward's still massively underrated drumming). The new remaster of All's Well collects everything the band recorded, and makes yet another case for the diversity and creativity of English experimental rock in the early 80s."
