Tonight, his eccentrically arranged songs will be performed by musicians and friends from like-minded groups like Henry Cow and Caravan. Featured singer Dagmar Krause is praised for her performances of the music of Brecht and Weill.&quot; (Bimhuis programme, Amsterdam, Netherlands, May 19th, 2011). \r\nhttps://www.bimhuis.nl/en/calendar/comicoperando-2/\r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tckYZT_lywU\r\n\r\nOriginal Italian premiere (March 1st, 2010 with Richard Sinclair) presented here:\r\nhttp://www.dimeadozen.org/torrents-details.php?id=568056\r\nhttps://www.mixcloud.com/latislav-milo%C5%A1-karel/comicoperando-a-tribute-to-the-music-of-robert-wyatt/\r\nhttps://halsprogressiverockblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/comicoperando-tribute-to-robert-wyatt.html\r\nhttps://bondegezou.blogspot.com/2011/05/comicoperando.html\r\nhttps://fabbricaeuropa.net/en/events/comicoperando/\r\n\r\n\r\nThis show was broadcast by Dutch radio VPRO Jazz Live, but sadly, not in its entirety. Some songs and talks with the audience were left out of the broadcasts. I used audience recordings to &quot;reconstruct&quot; the whole show with the best sound available. Even the applause were carefully patched to remove the presenter speech over them.\r\n\r\nA painful editing work was done to make transition between both sources very fluid and seamless. Of course you will notice a difference in sound quality between different sources, but the sound of of the audience source (of great quality I have to say) has been adjusted to match that of the broadcast. Also on some parts of &quot;Maryan&quot; and &quot;O Caroline&quot;, Richard Sinclair sang completely out of time, so I couldn&#39;t resist to attenuate these vocals faults by using other parts of the songs.\r\n\r\nSo here you have the most complete and best quality recording of this great band. I think this is the most successful tribute of Wyatt that I have heard.\r\n\r\nNote: the VPRO recordings are internet broadcasts, so they&#39;re most certainly mp3 sources. But for the editing process, a lossless format is required. So now I share this release on Flac to avoid re-compressing and further quality loss. Don&#39;t complain if you detect it as being &quot;false lossless&quot;, and feel free to encode it to mp3 if you wish.\r\n\r\nBut most importantly, LISTEN to the music and ENJOY IT !\r\n- original uploader (anonymous)",
