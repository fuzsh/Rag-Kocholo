        "text": "CLASSICAL\n\nVarious Composers\n\nPomerania: Music from Northern Germany and Poland (14th-15th Centuries)\n\nEnsemble Peregrina / Agnieszka Budzińska-Bennett\n\nTacet (dist. Naxos)\n\nTACET273\n\nThis is the fourth and (sadly) final volume in the Tacet label’s Mare Balticum series, which celebrates obscure early music from the Baltic region. As on the previous three volumes, which featured music from Denmark, Finland, Sweden, and northern Germany, Agnieszka Budzińska-Bennett leads the Ensemble Peregrina in a survey of forgotten and previously lost works found in various archives around the German-Polish region once known as Pomerania. Some of them have been preserved only incompletely, requiring Budzińska-Bennett to fill in a few musical blanks herself; many have never been recorded before or even heard in centuries. All of the music consists of single sung melodic lines, but this isn’t “plainchant” in the usual sense — it’s discursive, sometimes simple and sometimes elaborate, and occasionally almost ecstatic, in a style that those familiar with the music of Hildegard von Bingen will likely recognize. Like the previous volumes in this series, this one should be considered an essential purchase for any library that collects pre-baroque music.\n\nAdriaen Willaert\n\nAdriano 2 (digital/vinyl only)\n\nDionysos Now! / Tore Tom Denys\n\nEvil Penguin\n\nCreeping forward in time about 100 years, we have this absolutely luscious recording of Adriaen Willaert’s Missa Benedicta es along with a handful of motets and chansons. Willaert was one of the great Franco-Flemish masters, but one who has been relegated largely to the shadows of history in comparison to his more illustrious contemporaries like Josquin and de la Rue. The six-voice male Dionysos Now! ensemble seeks to remedy that with these sonically and musically sumptuous recordings (Adriano 1 was released last year), which not only showcase heartbreakingly beautiful compositions but also a surprisingly rich vocal sound; normally a small-force male ensemble isn’t my favorite, but this one sounds amazing. Sadly for library collections, the Evil Penguin label doesn’t release CDs, but these recordings will be available on vinyl as well as digitally.\n\nMax Stern\n\nRetrospective\n\nVarious Ensembles\n\nIsrael Music Institute\n\nIMI-CD-64\n\nIsraeli composer Max Stern has been focused on producing what he calls “Biblical compositions” for many years. On this collection of works written between 1979 and 2009, he draws on themes both explicitly and implicitly related to the Bible and Bible history: on the more implicit side, there is a suite titled Three Ancient Pieces for flute and guitar (which draws on Davidic musical ideas), while a lovely large-scale work for orchestra titled Song of the Morning Stars celebrates the Biblical account of the creation. Hannah’s Song of Praise sets to music a beautiful text from the Book of Samuel, while the brief cantata Prophecy for the End of Days brings a more somber mood to the proceedings. All of the music is tonal and quite approachable, but departs in marked ways from some of the stylistic conventions of Western European classical music. Fascinating and lovely stuff, for all libraries.\n\nJohann David Heinichen\n\nDresden Vespers\n\nEnsemble Polyharmonique; Wrocław Baroque Orchestra / Jarosław Thiel\n\nAccent (dist. Naxos)\n\nACC 24381\n\nVarious Composers\n\nGloria Dresdensis\n\nDresdner Barockorchester\n\nCPO (dist. Naxos)\n\n777 782-2\n\nWhen the religiopolitical winds changed at the Dresden court with the (Protestant) Elector Prince’s marriage to (the very Catholic) Maria Josepha in 1719, its music had to change as well. Luckily for the court and its newlywed prince, the composer they had on hand was Johann David Heinichen, who was particularly well suited to creating the kind of sumptuous liturgical music that Maria Josepha had come to love in Vienna. This vespers service includes Dixit Dominus and Magnificat settings among other festal pieces, and is performed joyfully and colorfully by the always outstanding Ensemble Polyharmonique. During the same period, secular instrumental and theater music was flourishing in Dresden as well, and the Dresdner Barockorchester was formed 30 years ago to keep alive the flame of that unusually fertile musical time and place. Gloria Dresdensis brings together chamber and orchestral works from Dresden composers of the early- to mid-18th century including G.F. Händel, Antonio Caldara, Johann Adolf Hasse, and Giuseppe Pisendel: sonatas, sinfonias, overtures, and incidental music from an oratorio all rub shoulders on this crowded but consistently delightful program. The playing and the recorded sound are outstanding on both releases.\n\nLeo Sowerby\n\nPaul Whiteman Commissions & Other Early Works\n\nAndy Baker Orchestra; Avalon String Quartet\n\nCedille (dist. Naxos)\n\nCDR 90000 205\n\nAmerican composer Leo Sowerby is best known for his religious music (and has been called, in fact, the Dean of American Church Music). But between 1916 and 1925 he wrote a number of neoclassical and jazz-derived pieces, two of them direct commissions from Paul Whiteman intended to be played by members of his jazz orchestra. These works — Synconata and Symphony for Jazz Orchestra — bracket the program, which also includes two pieces for string quartet and one for piano and strings. All represent world-premiere recordings. The music is not nearly as jazzy as one might expect (particularly given the cover photo of Whiteman and his band). There are elements of jazz here, especially in the Symphony, but this is not jazz; it’s reasonably straight-up art music, and definitely art music of its time and place. This recording will be a fascinating resource for any library supporting the study of American music. For that purpose, the liner notes alone are almost worth the price of the disc.\n\nJAZZ\n\nSylvie Courvoisier; Mary Halvorson\n\nSearching for the Disappeared Hour\n\nPyroclastic\n\nPR 17\n\n“We both have an affinity towards darkening things,” says guitarist Mary Halvorson of her ongoing duo project with pianist Sylvie Courvoisier, “which is great because you can start with a joyous melody and there’s all kinds of room to mess with it. We’re both really open to that.” You hear that happening all over the place on this challenging, complex, and ultimately (though not simply) joyous album. Halvorson’ unique tone and often unsettling approach to effects are on full display here: she’ll be playing a lyrical, clean-toned line that suddenly wobbles off into pitch-altered cartoon weirdness. Courvoisier, similarly, can switch from neoclassical decorousness to spiky atonality and back again at a moment’s notice. Together, they respond to each other’s subtlest gestures quickly and nimbly and always with a sense of clear musical logic, even when improvising in an entirely free style. Highly recommended.\n\nPete Malinverni\n\nOn the Town: Peter Malinverni Plays Leonard Bernstein\n\nPlanet Arts\n\n302124\n\nThis recording was released at a fortuitous moment: a time when the general public’s attention had been turned once again to the music of one of America’s national treasures, composer/conductor Leonard Bernstein (thanks to Steven Spielberg’s reimagined film version of West Side Story). Here pianist Malinverni leads bassist Ugonna Okegwo and the magnificent drummer Jeff Hamilton through a respectful but still adventurous program of Bernstein show tunes including “I Feel Pretty,” “Somewhere,” and “Lonely Town.” (At the end of the album is a Malinverni original, a tribute titled “A Night on the Town.”) Malinverni’s style is an impressive blend of the lyrical and the off-kilter — long lines that evoke Bud Powell will suddenly give way to Monkish rhythmic dysjunction. Hamilton’s brush work is a quiet and subtle highlight, as it always is. For all jazz collections.\n\nPiet Verbist\n\nSecret Exit to Another Dimension\n\nOrigin\n\n82838\n\nI’ll be completely candid here: this isn’t my favorite jazz album of the year, or even the month. But I’m recommending it because I don’t see it as my job simply to share what I like — it’s my job to hip you to good music, and this album is objectively excellent, in terms of both the playing and (even more so) its structure and conception. Bassist Piet Verbist leads a trio that includes guitarist Hendrik Braeckman and drummer Lionel Beuvens, and they play a mixed program of originals and standards that shows off the group’s exceptional skill at arranging, as well as its impressive cohesiveness as a musical unit. Braeckman’s “Map Map” is an unusually complex chart, but wears its complexity lightly; Verbist’s arrangement of Charlie Parker’s “Cheryl” makes the tune entirely his own, and Beuvens’ “Bridge House” is a lovely, floating jazz waltz with a chord progression that stays just on the right side of predictable. Verbist keeps his solos to a minimum — always a wise choice for a bass player.\n\nChris Dingman\n\nJourneys Vol. 1\n\nSelf-released\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nThe meditative pieces on the latest album from vibraphonist Chris Dingman have their roots in his Peace project, which I recommended in 2020. That five-disc set consisted of improvised pieces he played for his father while the latter was in hospice care. Journeys Vol. 1 is also a set of improvisations for solo vibraphone, but these were originally created for his weekly Bandcamp subscription; subscribers helped him to choose which tracks to include on the album. They find him continuing to explore ways in which music can heal and can take you on a journey; they are also informed by his study of other instruments, notably the mbira or thumb-piano. (In fact, once you know to listen for it, you’ll hear that instrument’s influence throughout the album.) As with Peace, the music is certainly soothing and pleasant — but because Dingman is a genuinely brilliant musician, it’s also much more.\n\nFOLK/COUNTRY\n\nThe Pine Hearts\n\nLost Love Songs\n\nSelf-released\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nWhen we think of the music scene in Olympia, Washington, what normally come to mind are the early days of grunge and the thriving local indie label K Records. And indeed, the Pine Hearts’ frontman Joey Capoccia came from the underground punk scene in that area — not that you’ll hear much of that influence in the Pine Hearts’ music. This is gentle, acoustic, folk- and bluegrass-derived pop music of the kind now generally called “Americana.” Guitar and mandolin are the instrumental foundation of these songs, with fiddle and banjo making regular appearances (notably on “Darling Don’t the Sunlight in Your Eyes,” which is not a typo, and “Ocean in Your Veins”); Capoccia’s reedy tenor is at the center, and his tendency to combine poetic lyrics with simple and straightforward melodies is what makes the songs such consistent winners. Very nice stuff.\n\nSarah Borges\n\nTogether Alone\n\nBlue Corn Music\n\nBCM2201\n\nThe title of Sarah Borges’ latest signals its context: this is a straight-up COVID album. She recorded it by remote means, sending voice-and-guitar demos to her producer Eric “Roscoe” Ambel, who then recruited session players who he knew would not only do a good job, but would be able to record their parts effectively at home. What Borges and Ambel have assembled from those disparate parts is an album that not only keenly reflects the anguish of the past two years (“It’s been a while now since I’ve seen my friends/Don’t know when I’m gonna see them again,” she sings) but also, improbably enough, sounds fantastic. Highlights include “Lucky Day,” a particularly hooky slab of country-rock, and “Wouldn’t Know You,” a powerful mid-tempo burner with through-composed harmonies. Borges is always impressive, and this is one of her best efforts so far.\n\nROCK/POP\n\nRhi & Telemachus\n\nDead Silk I & II (EPs; digital only)\n\nTru Thoughts\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nBack in January 2018 I recommended Rhi’s album Reverie, which I hailed as basically a return of classic trip-hop informed by intervening developments in both bass music and R&B. Her latest is actually two releases, each of them billed as a “three-track single” featuring three songs alongside instrumental and a cappella versions, for a total of eighteen tracks across both EPs. Her general modus operandi hasn’t changed much: booming but not crushing basslines; slow tempos; huge sonic spaces; a voice that floats murkily rather than asserting itself in the mix and that declaims quietly rather than emoting. Producer Telemachus sounds like her musical soulmate here, and giving him equal billing seems only fair given how important his particular approach to sound is to these final products. The songs are brilliant and unsettling in equal measure.\n\nPip Blom\n\nWelcome Break\n\nHeavenly (dist. Integral)\n\nHVNLP187CD\n\nOpening with the absolutely perfect “You Don’t Want This,” the sophomore effort from Amsterdam’s Pip Blom builds on the success of their 2019 debut, Boat. This is guitar-based indie rock of a type that would have been called “post punk” in the 1980s and wouldn’t have sounded at all out of place in that decade: a vocal style that evokes the Sundays, and a tight but slightly messy guitar sound that falls somewhere between the Buzzcocks and Wire. The hooks aren’t quite as plentiful across the album as that opening track might lead you to expect, but the songwriting is a consistent pleasure and songwriter/lead singer Pip Blom (after whom the band is named) delivers everything with solid authority. For all pop collections.\n\nBev Lee Harling\n\nLittle Anchor\n\nWah Wah 45s\n\nWAHCD039\n\nBev Lee Harling is a songwriter, singer, and violinist, and this only her second release since 2012. In the intervening period she’s become a mother, and Little Anchor finds her reflecting musically on the adventures of parenthood and all of the joys, frustrations, disappointments, and euphoria that experience can bring (sometimes within the space of an hour). The sound is multi-layered, mostly built on acoustic instrumentation (often her violin, played in a variety of ways) and mutitracked vocals, though electronic beats and samples find their way into the mix too. “Is it OK that I don’t know what I’m doing?” she asks on one song, and on another she pays tender tribute to her recently deceased mother. Nothing here sounds like anything else currently on the market, but it’s all perfectly accessible. In fact, rarely has an album as willfully odd as this one been so effortlessly enjoyable.\n\nThe Living Earth Show & Danny Clay\n\nMusic for Hard Times\n\nEarthy\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nCharles Richard\n\nSonic Earth\n\nGlacial Movements\n\nGM046\n\nI have pretty broad musical tastes, but at every point on the spectrum of those tastes my criteria are very particular. I love reggae, but mainly roots-and-culture reggae from the 1970s; I love punk rock, but it has to be “I’m angry because I want the world to be better” punk rock rather than “no future” punk rock. I love classical music, but mainly classical music written between 1500 and 1820 or so; and so forth. I mention all of that by way of saying that I love ambient music, but it can’t just be wispy and pretty; it must also be interesting. Both of these releases hit that target cleanly. Music for Hard Times is a collaborative project between composer Danny Clark and an ensemble called the Living Earth Show, conceived during the COVID lockdown and designed to answer the question: “Is it possible for us to use the tools of classical art music to make people feel better?”. Your mileage will vary in that regard, of course, but I have a hard time imagining anyone failing to feel better while listening to heart-tuggingly gentle “Book 1, Part 4” or the beautiful but distinctly odd backwards instruments on “Book 2, Part 1.” On a very different tip is Charles Richard’s Sonic Earth LP, an album on which Richard seeks — no joking — to “synthesize the sound of rocks.” Here’s how it works, in his words: “My recording process starts with a prepared mineral stylus that scores the surface of the material. Recording this with a piezo electric contact mic, this long recording serves as the generator. The next stage is to play this recording back into the material via a vibrational surface speaker. This means that the material is vibrating to its own resonance and the surface noise is heard less and what you hear is a cleaner amplified version of the rocks resonance.” What’s the result? Music of serene, floating, and sometimes spooky beauty — music that is not so much about making you feel better as about helping you think about your natural environment in entirely new ways. (And as a bonus, it may also make you feel better.)\n\nWORLD/ETHNIC\n\nDJ Drez\n\nThe Parahamsa Mixes: White Swan Taking Flight (digital only)\n\nWhite Swan\n\nWS-0172\n\nProducer DJ Drez (often in collaboration with his spouse, singer Marti Nikko) has been creating exceptionally groovy music for many years now, in a variety of styles that orbit around hip hop and dub reggae. To call it “club music” wouldn’t be quite accurate; his music generally comes very explicitly from a place of yogic/Hindu devotion, and that’s certainly the case with this new collection of remixes based on tracks from his labelmates at White Swan. “Abundant Jungle” is a slow, syrupy take on Zaire Black’s “Abundance,” while “Radha’s Paint” remixes a track from Stevin McNamara’s album Shakti Guitar and “Govinda Echoes” takes Masood Ali Khan’s “Govinda Gopala” and twists it gently into a dubbed-out space jam. Nikko makes several appearances on the program, and as always her contributions are highlights.\n\nArtikal Sound System\n\nWelcome to Florida\n\nControlled Substance Sound Labs\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nOn their first full-length release, Florida’s Artikal Sound System hit that elusive sweet spot: balancing pop hooks with old-school reggae rhythms, balancing a deep and bassy groove with a clean and modern sound, and balancing serious roots-and-culture messages with laments over romance gone wrong. Their sound is tight and clean and singer Logan Rex has a voice that sounds light at first but shows its core strength as you keep listening. “One with You” delivers a powerful message of unity, and segues nicely into the dancehall groove of “Too Soon,” with its gently anthemic chorus; “Dissolve” is a regretful kiss-off song, and “Cops and Robbers” is a jaunty ska workout with a sharp social message. Rarely do modern reggae albums deliver this nice a blend of thoughtfulness and fun. Highly recommended.\n\nGary Stroutsos & Stevin McNamara\n\nMoonlight Meditations: Instrumental Sound Bath (digital only)\n\nWhite Swan\n\nWS238\n\nI confess that I approached this release with interest, but also with a bit of trepidation. The title led me to be cautious about the depth/density of the musical content, and what looked like a rather casual invocation of yoga concepts in the track titles led me to wonder about its overall seriousness. But I can happily report that this is an interesting and musically satisfying album, one that draws on Indian classical tradition without using it as a shallow scrim of spiritual exotica, and that guitarist Stevin McNamara and flutist Gary Stroutsos (playing a bass flute, which brings an unusual and lovely tonality to the proceedings) create music that is both unique and oddly universal. Or maybe not “universal” but rather “nonspecific.” As the artists themselves put it, this album “doesn’t bridge two worlds; it creates its own.”\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nHenri Hardouin\n\nComplete Four-part Masses, Volume 2\n\nSt. Martin’s Chamber Choir / Timothy J. Krueger\n\nToccata Classics (dist. Naxos)\n\nTOCC0423\n\nI was deeply impressed by these world-premiere recordings of a cappella masses written just before the French Revolution. Henri Hardouin was maitre de chapelle at Rheims Cathedral until the Revolution forced him into hiding (as a priest, he was in serious danger); he remains deeply obscure, and his works are rarely published or recorded. But these Masses are absolutely gorgeous: simple and straightforward in structure, but melodically sweet and imbued with a golden light of devotion. The St. Martin’s Chamber Choir’s delivery is maybe slightly ragged in a few places, but the group performs these works with a hushed intensity and in a reverberant acoustic that showcase the music perfectly. Every library with a classical music collection should consider picking up this disc, as well as Volume 1.\n\nFranz Anton Dimler\n\nThree Clarinet Concertos\n\nNikolaus Friedrich; Kurpfälzisches Kammerorchester Mannheim / Johannes Willig\n\nCPO (dist. Naxos)\n\n555 209-2\n\nAlso from the height of the classical era comes this delightful set of three clarinet concertos written by Franz Anton Dimler, horn player (later double bassist) and composer at the court of Carl Theodor of the Palatinate. These pieces were written near the end of the 18th century, and were probably intended to be played by Dimler’s son, who was a musician in the court at Munich at the time. There are some interesting formal innovations in this music, but the casual listener will be struck primarily by its melodic sweetness with that slight edge of melancholy that is the unique province of the clarinet. Three of the pieces on this outstanding disc represent world-premiere recordings; soloist Nikolaus Friedrich displays consistently lovely tone.\n\nJacob Regnart\n\nMissa Christ ist erstanden\n\nCinquecento\n\nHyperion (dist. Integral)\n\nCDA68369\n\nVarious Composers\n\nJosquin’s Legacy\n\nThe Gesualdo Six / Owain Park\n\nHyperion\n\nCDA68379\n\nThroughout 2021 — the 500th anniversary of the death of Josquin des Prez — I kept expecting a bumper crop of new recordings of music by that towering figure in the Franco-Flemish choral tradition. It never really materialized, though that doesn’t mean there weren’t some fine recordings from that tradition. Jacob Regnart is one of the less fully appreciated inheritors of Josquin’s legacy, a Douai-born composer who flourished at the Innsbruck Court of Archduke Ferdinand II. There he used music (notably these two Easter Masses) to help advance the cause of revitalizing Catholicism in Germany in the wake of the Lutheran Reformation. The music is gorgeous, and this recording should help bring more recognition to Regnart’s significant contribution to the development of Renaissance choral music. Other Franco-Flemish composers who followed in Josquin’s footsteps include Adrian Willaert, Jean l’Héritier, Antoine de Févin, and Antoine Brumel, all of whom are featured on the Josquin’s Legacy collection by the Gesualdo Six, which focuses particularly on the influence Josquin had at the court of Ferrara during the late 15th and early 16th century. There are no Mass settings here; instead, the program explores a wide range of motets; some are lamentations on the deaths of fellow composers, some are Latin texts with political overtones; some are works of Marian devotion. Both of these recordings are by small, all-male ensembles, and both feature a surprisingly rich and creamy ensemble sound. Both are highly recommended to all libraries.\n\nVarious Composers\n\nFresca Barocca\n\nJared Hauser; Christopher Stenstrom; Francis Perry; Polly Brecht\n\nBlue Griffin (dist. Albany)\n\nBGR573\n\nThis is a beautifully recorded and sweetly performed collection of oboe sonatas by Handel, Vivaldi, Geminiani, Telemann, and a dance suite by François Couperin. Playing on what seems to be a mix of modern and period instruments, cellist Christopher Stenstrom, lutenist Francis Perry, and harpsichordist Polly Brecht provide support to the outstanding oboist Jared Hauser, whose lightness of touch and purity of tone are a delight throughout. The quality of the compositions themselves is noteworthy too, of course — Telemann’s wonderful F-major sonata is a particular standout, as is the liltingly beautiful sixth suite from Couperin’s Concerts royaux. This would make a fine addition to any library with a collecting interest in baroque music.\n\nJAZZ\n\nMareike Wiening\n\nFuture Memories\n\nGreenleaf Music\n\nGRE-CD-1088\n\nAs regular readers will have gathered by now, my tastes in jazz run to the straight-ahead: I tend to favor jazz that swings powerfully, that is melodically tight and coherent, and that works within relatively traditional structures. But there are exceptions, and drummer/composer Mareike Wiening’s second album as a leader is one such. It’s not that her music is “out,” at least in any fundamental sense: it swings (mostly), and it follows well-structured chord progressions. But her progressions are intriguingly impressionistic, often following unusual paths that slip and slide and leave you unsure where she’ll go next. She and her sidemen play with such confident communication, though, that you’ll never be left feeling lost or confused; on a tune like “Dance into July” or the aptly titled ballad “An Idea Is Unpredictable,” you can listen with relaxed confidence that no matter where the changes take you, it will be someplace interesting and lovely. As unusual as it is, this is one of my favorite jazz releases of the year.\n\nMathias Eick\n\nWhen We Leave\n\nECM\n\n2660\n\nEven by ECM standards, this is an unusually lovely and lyrical album of contemporary jazz. Norwegian trumpeter and composer Mathias Eick has become a major figure on the scene in recent years, and on his newest album he leads a septet that, unusually, features two drummers and a steel guitar along with violin, piano, and bass. While this could reasonably lead one to expect cacophony or at least gentle chaos, Eick’s arrangements create just the opposite: the music floats and flows, every musician creating something unique but leaving the others plenty of room to move. There’s a deep melancholy here, reflecting events of the past year, but an equally deep joy. Highly recommended to all libraries.\n\nEva Cassidy\n\nLive at Blues Alley: 25th Anniversary Edition (reissue)\n\nBlix Street (dist. ADA)\n\nG2-10218\n\nThis is a remastered reissue of a landmark album, one that was recorded for the purpose of giving the hair-raisingly talented singer Eva Cassidy something that she and her band could sell at gigs to raise extra money. Several months later she had died of cancer; posthumously, her star rose and she became a multi-platinum-selling artist who found a particularly enthusiastic audience in the UK. If you’re not already familiar with her work, this album clearly demonstrates what all the fuss was about: her voice is one of the wonders of nature. On this set she glides, shouts, and croons her way through jazz standards (“Cheek to Cheek,” “Autumn Leaves,” “What a Wonderful World”), blues burners (“Stormy Monday”), R&B (“Take Me to the River”) and pop (jaw-dropping versions of “Bridge Over Troubled Water” and “Fields of Gold”), leaving her personal stamp on every familiar tune. I can’t say enough about how gorgeous her voice is and how beautifully her band supports her. And the remastered sound is amazing.\n\nMichael Bakan; Brian Hall; Longineu Parsons\n\nA History of the Future (digital only)\n\nTribal\n\nTR33\n\nNot normally a big fan of jazz ensembles that don’t include a chordal instrument, I nevertheless found myself really enjoying this unusual set by trio Michael Bakan (drums), Brian Hall (bass), and Longineu Parsons (trumpet, cornet, flute, recorder). As tune titles like “St. James Infirm,” “Creole,” and “New Orleans Twisted” would suggest, the compositions tend to be centered on slippery, second-line rhythms, and structurally they don’t seem to hew very consistently to the usual head-solos-head approach: they’re certainly not unstructured, but there’s a looseness to the arrangements that adds to the general sense of fun and extemporaneity — another way in which the spirit of New Orleans imbues this whole album. For all jazz collections.\n\nFOLK/COUNTRY\n\nValerie Smith\n\nRenaissance\n\nBell Buckle\n\nBBR4042\n\nThere are lots of ways to modernize the bluegrass formula: you can add jazz chord changes, you can add drums and/or electric bass, you can cover pop songs. Or you can do what Valerie Smith does, which is simply use bluegrass instrumentation to accompany rootsy songs that may or may not come from the strict folk or bluegrass tradition, sometimes playing them with that familiar drive and energy and sometimes harnessing the instruments to a more mellow and introspective style. And when you do it with this much skill, the results are consistently impressive — note in particular her take on Jude Johnstone’s gorgeously regretful “On That Train,” and the honky-tonking “Dancing with the Stars.” The intense, bluesy gospel number “The Great I Am” is a highlight, too. Smith’s voice is clear and strong, with a pleasantly grainy edge to it. Highly recommended.\n\nJulie Christensen\n\n11 from Kevin: Songs of Kevin Gordon\n\nWirebird\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nI confess that I had never heard of Kevin Gordon before receiving a copy of this disc for review. But singer/songwriter Julie Christensen has admired her Nashville colleague for years, and now we can all hear why. A graduate of the Iowa Writer’s Workshop program (where he earned a master’s degree in poetry), Gordon is unusually gifted at crafting evocative and thought-provoking lyrics: on “Fire at the End of the World” his verbal cadence and lyrical imagery intensely recall middle-period Tom Waits, while “Gloryland” is a dark-hued condemnation of religious hypocrisy, which Christensen delivers with prophetic intensity. Christensen’s voice is gritty and her intonation occasionally wavers, but the strength of her delivery is undeniable and the arrangements are both rootsy and rocking.\n\nROCK/POP\n\nVarious Artists\n\nSacred Soul: The D-Vine Spirituals Records Story, Volumes 1 & 2\n\nBible & Tire Recording Co.\n\nBTRC018\n\nJuan D. Phipps grew up in Memphis in the 1940s and 1950s, playing music on the sly and swearing he’d never become a preacher like his father. He actually did — but his musical background took him in a slightly different direction. He also started the D-Vine Spirituals label, recording local talent like the Gospelaires, Elizabeth King & the Gospel Souls, the Shaw Singers, and the Pure Heart Travelers and garnering significant local airplay and winning regional competitions. Now 28 of his label’s original 45s are gathered together on these two CDs, and I can promise you they sound different from anything you’ve heard before. This isn’t smooth, tight-harmony gospel music; it’s raw-boned, rocking, occasionally slightly scary gospel music, music that sometimes sounds exactly like 50s and 60s R&B except for the lyrical subject matter. For all pop music collections.\n\nOneiros Way\n\nThe Dawn Is Near (digital only)\n\nDischi del Minollo\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nI keep wanting to say this album is “fun,” but that’s entirely the wrong word. Oneiros Way makes music that explores a dark region between dream pop, trip-hop, synthpop, and shoegaze. Maybe the word “fun” keeps popping into my mind because I love the juddering basslines, or maybe I’m tickled by the group’s occasional language shifts (from Italian to English and back), or maybe it’s the subtle puckishness that emerges from time to time, like with the 6/8 rhythms and synthesized banjo sounds on “Glass Bell” ; I don’t know. I do know that the debut album by this duo, presented only as “Regina” and “Claudio,” contains some of the more engaging pop and pop-adjacent music I heard in 2021.\n\nRobert Görl & DAF\n\nNur noch Einer\n\nGrönland\n\nCDGRON227\n\nLet’s be very clear about this one, though: the word “fun” will not enter your mind while listening to it. That’s partly because the music of Deutsch Amerikanische Freundshaft (DAF) has been edgy and intense throughout the duo’s 40-year on-and-off career, and it’s partly because the circumstances under which this album was created were sad and disappointing. Multi-instrumentalist Robert Görl and singer/lyricist Gabriel Delgado were scheduled to go back into the studio together after a long hiatus, when Delgado died suddenly of a heart attack. Görl moved forward with recording plans, in large part as a tribute to Delgado, but the shape of the project changed: he and Delgado had been digging through the DAF archives and finding previously-unreleased instrumental tracks, to which the latter was planning to add improvised lyrics in the studio. Instead, Görl wrote and recorded his own. The resulting sound is vintage 1980s electro pop, maybe less “pop” than “electro,” with stiff but energetic beats and lyrics that are declaimed more than sung. To paraphrase David Thomas, this is just the sort of thing for people who like this sort of thing. And I do.\n\nBirds of Passage\n\nThe Last Garden\n\nDenovali\n\nDEN366\n\nThis is Alicia Merz’s fifth album under the name Birds of Passage, and her first in three years. As always, her music explores a deep inner space that the reclusive artist shares with the world only in this way. Her voice is hushed, breathy, and multi-tracked, making the words a bit hard to discern; the music itself is similarly soft and layered, often invoking artists like Cocteau Twins and My Bloody Valentine, but with less edge (in the latter case) and less melodic hookiness (in the former). There’s a deeply appealing beauty to it, though, and at her best Mertz demonstrates how much you can do with atmosphere and texture. Highly recommended.\n\nWORLD/ETHNIC\n\nCéu\n\nUm Gosto del Sol (digital only)\n\nUrban Jungle/Warner\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nThe latest from Brazilian singer/songwriter Céu finds her returning to her roots — which is to say, cover versions. This is actually her first cover album, but when she was first getting started as a singer, living in New York and working day jobs, it was performing covers that helped her establish her voice. And now, a couple of decades into a successful career recording her own songs, she’s looking back and interpreting songs by others that have been meaningful to her. They range from the very familiar (“Feelings,” which she manages, against all odds, to make entirely her own, and João Gilberto’s pioneering “Bim Bom”) to songs that only adepts of Brazilian pop are likely to recognize (Ismael Silva’s samba “Ao Romper de Aurora,” Carlos & Jocafi’s “Teimosa”). The settings are all simple but elegant, and largely acoustic, the better to showcase Céu’s delicately gorgeous voice.\n\nDom la Nena\n\nTempo\n\nSix Degrees\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nAnd speaking of delicately gorgeous, check out the latest from another top-notch Brazilian talent. Dom La Nena is a singer, songwriter, producer, and cellist originally from Brazil but currently based in Paris. Her latest album is quiet but complex, both musically and emotionally; there’s a sunniness to her songs, but a gentle melancholy as well. All of the sounds were produced by her, including the percussion parts (which were created by tapping on her cello). On songs like “No Tengas Miedo” the parts are gently but densely layered, whereas on others (notably the butterfly-light “Moreno”) every sound feels like it could blow away at any moment. She writes subtle but lovely melodies and sings them in a slightly breathy voice that never feels in any way insubstantial. Highly recommended to all libraries.\n\nRachel Magoola\n\nResilience: Songs of Uganda\n\nARC Music (dist. Naxos)\n\nEUCD2948\n\nOn her latest album, legendary Ugandan singer and songwriter Rachel Magoola makes a triumphant return to the world stage with a set of songs that are much more serious than they sound at first listen. If you don’t speak Lusoga, Acholi, Gisu, Ateso, or Rukiga (the languages in which she performs on this album), you’d be hard put to hear the anguish that underlies songs like the sweet and sprightly “Bufuubi” or the frantically bumping and horn-driven “Maama Mutesi.” The theme of “resilience” is very important here; it explains how these songs can be simultaneously so celebratory and so concerned with tribulation and hardship. The music itself is a wonderful, uplifting mix of modern and traditional instruments with beautiful call-and-response vocals. I can’t recommend this one strongly enough.\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nPhilip Glass\n\nMaya Beiser x Philip Glass\n\nMaya Beiser\n\nIslandia Music\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nFor those who think Philip Glass’s music is mostly a bunch of endless arpeggios, cellist/arranger/producer Maya Beiser is here to set you straight. On this album she has arranged several of Glass’s piano etudes, the concert pieces Mad Rush and Music in Similar Motion, and selections from his opera scores for multitracked cello, and her arrangements demonstrate not only the complexity of Glass’s music but also his gradual evolution from repetitive minimalism into a sort of neo-Romantic expressivism. Those familiar with her work won’t be surprised by the virtuosity or the richness of her tone, but the inventivenss of her arrangements is also exceptional. A release for all libraries with a collecting interest in contemporary classical music.\n\nŠimon Brixi\n\nMusic from Eighteenth-century Prague\n\nHipocondria Ensemble / Jan Hádek\n\nSupraphon (dist. Naxos)\n\nSU 4293-2\n\nI’m really a sucker for world-premiere recordings of relatively ancient music — I love listening to music and thinking about the fact that it hasn’t been previously heard by anyone currently alive. And when the music is exceptionally beautiful, that makes the experience even more exciting. Šimon Brixi was a member of a distinguished Bohemian musical family (with genealogical connections to the celebrated Bendas); born at the end of the 17th century, he settled in Prague in his early 20s and began studying the law. But he abandoned the law for music and established himself as a church organist and composer. Despite significant regional renown, fewer than 40 of his works have survived. This outstanding recording features a Mass and a Magnificat setting, along with several briefer sacred works. All but the Magnificat are recorded here for the first time; the Hipocondria Ensemble (on period instruments) play with a lovely balance of lightness and solidity, and the singing of soloists Hana Blažíková and Jaromír Nosek is particularly noteworthy. For all collections.\n\nGeorg Benda\n\nPiano Concertos\n\nHoward Shelley; London Mozart Players\n\nHyperion (dist. Integral)\n\nCDA68361\n\nAnd speaking of the Benda family: I’ve been monitoring the Hyperion label’s The Classical Piano Concerto series with great delight ever since it was instituted in 2014. Now on its eighth volume, the series brings us four concertos by Georg Benda, a contemporary of C.P.E. Bach and Johann Stamitz better known today for his theatrical work than for his concert pieces. But pianist Howard Shelley and the London Mozart Players (all playing on modern instruments) make a powerful case here for Benda’s skill and even his importance in the latter arena, demonstrating how he helped build the bridge that linked the end of the baroque era with the beginning of the classical. Playing with relatively small forces (strings only apart from the piano soloist), Shelley and his group demonstrate Benda’s mastery of idiom and his forward-thinking structural ideas, and the entire album is a delight. Highly recommended to all classical collections, along with the previous volumes in the series.\n\nPierre-Gabriel Buffardin\n\nFlute Sonatas & Concerto\n\nLe Petit Trianon\n\nRicercar/Outhere (dist. Naxos)\n\nRIC 428\n\nThese completely delightful chamber works for flute and strings (plus bassoon) come from the pen of celebrated flutist Pierre-Gabriel Buffardin, who is believed to have traded flute lessons for composition training from Johann Jacob Bach, brother of Johann Sebastian. He was a musician in the Dresden court in the early 18th century, and later spent many years in service to the King of Poland. This program features three sonatas and one chamber concerto, all of which showcase Buffardin’s unusually sweet lyricism and are exquisitely played by the Geneva-based ensemble Le Petit Trianon, featuring flute soloist Olivier Riehl. Strongly recommended to all classical collections.\n\nLouis de Caix d’Hervelois\n\nDans le sillage de Marin Marais: Pièces de viole et autres oeuvres\n\nLa Rêveuse\n\nHarmonia Mundi (dist. Integral)\n\nHMM 902352\n\nHenry Purcell\n\nFantazias\n\nChelys Consort of Viols\n\nBIS (dist. Naxos)\n\nBIS-2583\n\nHenry Purcell, one of England’s greatest composers, was only 20 years old when he composed his set of fantasias and In Nomines for an unspecified consort of instruments. He was creating surprisingly old-fashioned music for a young court composer, and it’s possible that these pieces served primarily as compositional exercises for him; nevertheless, they show his budding genius and are exceptionally lovely. The Chelys Consort of Viols makes a strong case both for their significance in Purcell’s oeuvre and for their attractiveness as chamber music. A few years later, across the Channel, the viol was still in fashion as a solo instrument and as a featured element in a “broken” consort (an ensemble of different instruments). In France, Marin Marais was the undisputed king of the viol, and a new recording by the La Rêveuse ensemble features the work of one of Marais’ little-known students: Louis de Caix d’Hervelois. He came into his own in the Regency period of the early 18th century, and wrote for both the five-string pardessus de viole and for the transverse flute, which was just coming into fashion. This program consists primarily of suites written for viol and continuo (the latter played by varying combinations of bass viol, theorbed lute, and harpsichord) plus one suite for traverso and continuo and several brief transcriptions for viol and for solo lute and guitar. This is gentle music, elegant in a rather self-effacing way, but quite inventive and beautifully played. I might have wished for a slightly warmer and more colorful recorded sound, but this is an excellent album overall.\n\nJAZZ\n\nDave Miller Trio\n\nThe Mask-erade Is Over\n\nSummit (dist. MVD)\n\nDCD 784\n\nOne of the things I love about pianist Dave Miller is the way he combines disciplined, fleet-fingered linear technique with a lush, almost orchestral sound. Not as lush as Errol Garner or Bill Evans, and not as linear as, say, Bud Powell, but Miller’s style hovers somewhere on the spectrum between those artists, moving easily along that spectrum, sometimes in the course of a single tune. His latest album (with its somewhat prematurely optimistic title) is a joyful romp through a program of standards including several classic bop tunes (he opens with a thrilling take on Charlie Parker’s “Anthropology”), American Songbook standbys, and a couple of relatively obscure numbers. Bassist Andrew Higgins and drummer Bill Belasco accompany him more than ably, and Belasco’s subtle brushwork is a particular highlight.\n\nGordon Grdina\n\nPendulum\n\nAttaboygirl\n\nABG-1\n\nGordon Grdina is back with a third solo album of pieces for guitar and oud (a fretless lute used in many Middle Eastern cultures). The music is a mix of fully composed and improvised pieces. On some of them you can hear jazzy and even bluesy influences poke through (most notably about halfway through “Benbow Blues”), and on others he explores more Arabic melodic ideas (“Wayward”). But much of the time this music is culturally unidentifiable, functioning as an expression of Grdina’s unique and unbelievably nimble musical mind. It’s not that he doesn’t respect or acknowledge his musical debts, just that he takes his influences and runs with them in a variety of directions, none of which can easily or accurately be pigeonholed as an expression of any one particular musical genre. You’ll find him in the Jazz section because that’s where he’s tended to be in the past, but jazz fans will scratch their heads at this release. And I mean that in a good way.\n\nFutari\n\nUnderground\n\nLibra\n\n202-069\n\nAnd while we’re exploring the misty borders of jazz/no-jazz, let’s check out the most recent release from pianist/composer Satoko Fujii. Futari is the name of her duo project with vibraphonist and marimba player Taiko Saito, and they’ve been working together for some years now as an improvising duo. When COVID forced the cancellation of a planned tour last year, they decided to create music together remotely, by exchanging sound files. Interestingly, this led to a creative process that was still improvisational, and yet allowed the possibility of multiple takes for each musician before the final version was settled upon. How’s the music itself? As gorgeous and complex as one would expect from these two players, sometimes knotty but mostly highly approachable. Saito plays with a bow quite a bit, and some of the album’s most delightful moments (such as the exceptional “Break in the Clouds”) are defined significantly by the contrast between Saito’s floating vibes chords and Fujii’s gentle, pointillistic piano lines. This is a marvelous album overall and would make a welcome addition to any serious jazz collection.\n\nDoug MacDonald\n\nSerenade to Highland Park\n\nDMACMUSIC\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nLeading a trio that also includes bassist Mike Flick and drummer Paul Kreibich, guitarist Doug MacDonald takes us through a lovely set that focuses on standards, and takes a couple of detours into original compositions. MacDonald is showing off his stylistic range here, veering happily from Latin classics (“Manhã de Carbaval,” “Brazil”) to subtly funky blues (“Next Time You See Me”), to fierce midtempo burners (“Dearly Beloved”). He’s also showing off his unusual facility for chord solos, which are everywhere and always fun. Flick and Kreibich give him the best and most solid support any leader could ask for. This is a great album all around.\n\nFOLK/COUNTRY\n\nGeorge Jackson\n\nHair & Hide\n\nSelf-released\n\nGJ-02\n\nThere is hardly a sound more archetypally American than the combination of fiddle and banjo, and on this album fiddler George Jackson celebrates that sound with a variety of A-list banjo players including Jake Blount, Brad Kolodner, and Catherine “BB” Bowness. He plays two tunes with each of them: a traditional number and a tune that he wrote for each banjoist with his or her particular playing style in mind. The result is an absolutely delightful kaleidoscope of tunes that shifts constantly from hardcore Appalachian mountain tonalities to the jazzier realms of newgrass — though it’s sometimes difficult to tell which tune is old and which one is new (except in the case of “Food, Coffee & Kisses,” which sounds a bit like, er, freejazzgrass). Notable here are the sounds of different kinds of banjos played in different styles: resonator-backed instruments played in Scruggs style, open-back banjos played using clawhammer technique, fretless gourd banjos, etc. This is a thoroughly delightful album.\n\nLegendary Shack Shakers\n\nCockadoodledeux\n\nAlternative Tentacles\n\nVIRUS 508\n\nAs someone who grew up buying Dead Kennedys albums, it’s a little disorienting to be reviewing what amounts to a neo-country album released on the Alternative Tentacles label (and one that features former Dead Kennedys frontman Jello Biafra as a guest vocalist, no less). The music veers from relatively traditional bluegrass (“Tickle Yore Innards”) to chugging honky-tonk (“They Won’t Let Me Forget”) to a sort of queasy norteño (“Godforsaken Town”) to rollicking rockabilly (“U-Can-Be-a-Star”). And it does all of that within the first five tracks. Then we get a Texas polka. All of it is delivered with a deceptively loose-sounding tightness, and the lyrics are slyly subversive. Overall, this album is a real hoot.\n\nSUSS\n\nNight Suite (EP; digital only)\n\nNorthern Spy (dist. Redeye)\n\nNS147\n\nThe world’s best (likely the world’s only) country-ambient supergroup is back again, this time with a digital-only EP of what has now become the band’s unique stock in trade: long-form instrumentals that employ classic country-music tropes (gently whining pedal steel, deeply twangy Telecaster licks, etc.) to create gorgeously abstract soundscapes — think of Brian and Roger Eno’s Apollo soundtrack, but wearing cowboy boots rather than a spacesuit. Don’t be fooled, though; this is music of significant sophistication no matter how easy it may be on the ear. My only quibble is that albums like this shouldn’t be EPs — they should be at least 70 minutes long. Once you’re in this mood you don’t want to come up to the surface again after only 19 minutes.\n\nROCK/POP\n\nDeadlights\n\nDeadlights\n\nThatwasmyskull Music\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nWell Wishers\n\nSpare Parts (digital only)\n\nThatwasmyskull Music\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nWell Wishers is the nom de power pop of singer, songwriter, and multi-instrumentalist Jeff Shelton, also known as the frontman for the similarly-inclined Bay Area band Spinning Jennies, who broke up in 2004. Shelton has since released over a dozen albums under the name Well Wishers, and the most recent is a digital-only compilation of outtakes and unreleased tracks spanning a period of ten years. As always, Shelton’s feel for a hook and his love of multi-layered guitars (not to mention his fine voice and skillful harmony singing) create a perfect crunchy-pop listening experience. Interestingly, he’s established a musical side hustle as well: a dreampop/Britpop project called Deadlights. On Deadlights’ eponymous debut album Shelton’s sound is a bit denser and also a bit softer around the edges than his Well Wishers music. There’s a somewhat shoegaze-y vibe here on some of these songs — I sometimes get a lovely whiff of Cocteau Twins mixed with the Sundays — but the pure pop sensibility is still strong and Shelton’s voice is easily recognizable. Both of these albums would make a welcome addition to any library’s pop music collection.\n\nGarza\n\nDaydream Accelerator (digital only)\n\nMagnetic Moon\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nRob Garza is better known as half of the legendary downtempo electronica duo Thievery Corporation, with whom for over 25 years he’s been the architect of a groundbreaking club vibe that fuses elements of Brazilian, lounge, dub, and trip hop sounds. Now breaking out as a solo artist, Garza has put together a wide-ranging album of club and dreampop tunes in collaboration with vocalists including Enemy Planes, Racquel Jones, and EMELINE. None of the music here will shock or startle a Thievery Corporation fan, but Garza is definitely charting his own territory here: you might expect a song titled “We Want Blood” to be somewhat aggro, but in fact it’s gently bumping dream-house; “Talkin” is solid but soft-edged dancehall, while “Swim to Shore” is dubbed-up synth pop with a gently insistent hook. Very nice stuff.\n\nVILIFY\n\nIllusion of Self (digital/vinyl only)\n\nOhm Resistance\n\n63M OHM\n\nThe Ohm Resistance label bills itself as “specialists in subsonic grief-bass programming,” and if that description sounds a bit tongue-in-cheek, well, listen to a few of its releases and you’ll get it. That being said, the new Ohm Resistance release by Berlin-based artist Villify takes a somewhat softer and kinder tack than that of many other musicians on the label’s roster. This is definitely bass music, and it’s definitely dark and moody, but it’s also restrained and very carefully orchestrated. “Road to Eleusis” flirts with a drill’n’bass tempo but keeps the focus on floating chords and ethereal textures, and the title track does something similar, also incorporating unidentifiable shards of vocals; “Ultimate Complexity” brings a somewhat tribal flavor to the proceedings. All of it is deeply enjoyable and only slightly unsettling (and only in the best way). Highly recommended.\n\nBirds of Passage\n\nThe Last Garden\n\nDenovali (dist. Redeye)\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nAlicia Merz is a New Zealander who records — quite sporadically — under the name Birds of Passage. She doesn’t share much with the public about her personal life, but based purely on the evidence of this, her fifth album, she’s not necessarily a life-of-the-party type. Song titles like “It’s Too Late Now,” “Worship My Flaws,” and “Petite mort” give you an idea of what to expect: shimmering soundscapes built out of exceeding subtle chord progressions played by radically fuzzed-out instruments; vocals whispered as much as sung; melodies that pile up as gently and quietly as feathers falling. Hooks? Eh, no. And yet the album is tremendously engaging and richly rewards a close listen.\n\nWORLD/ETHNIC\n\nShjujaat Husain Khan; Katayoun Goudarzi; Shaho Andalibi; Shariq Mustafa\n\nThis Pale\n\nLycopod\n\nLR 002109\n\nThis album was recorded with, in part, a non-musical purpose: to try to come to an understanding of how the United States — where 13th-century Sufi mystic Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi has been the best-selling poet for almost 20 years — could have succumbed to such broad and powerful anti-Muslim sentiment over the past several years. Katayioun Goudarzi (voice), Shujaat Khan (sitar), Shaho Andalibi (ney), and Shariq Mustafa (tabla) decided to make an album consisting entirely of setting of Rumi’s love poems, and the result is this quietly intense and utterly gorgeous recording. The COVID pandemic forced the quartet to record mostly asynchronously, but the production is so fine and the performances so empathic that you would swear they were all in the same room with you. And Goudarzi’s voice is a wonder. Highly recommended to all libraries.\n\nMarcus Gad Meets Tamal\n\nBrave New World (digital & vinyl only)\n\nEasy Star/Baco\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nMarcus Gad hails from New Caledonia, a French protectorate in the South Pacific; for several years now, he’s been engaged in an ongoing collaboration with French producer Tamal. The latest fruit of that collaboration is this outstanding album of music that could loosely be called reggae but that regularly strays far from the usual reggae formulas. “Sunshine,” for example, is written in 6/8, while “Break the Spell” is a sort of hip hop fusion and “Treasure” is more R&B than anything else. Gad’s adopted Jamaican accent provides the only link to reggae tradition in many cases, but it also serves as the continuous thread that holds the album’s many stylistic excursions together. Very nice overall.\n\nJhelisa\n\n7 Keys, Vol. 2 (digital only)\n\nDorado\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nIf you recognize Jhelisa Anderson’s name, there’s a good chance it’s from her 1990s work as a funk-soul diva, releasing acclaimed solo work while also appearing alongside the likes of the Shamen, Massive Attack, Soul Family Sensation, and even Björk. in 2018, after a long hiatus from solo recording, she made an album of drone-based music for meditation titled 7 Keys. Now she’s back with 7 Keys Vol. 2 (the first volume is being reissued simultaneously), and on these two albums she creates tracks at different frequencies designed to activate different chakras (bodily centers of focus during meditation, as outlined in mystical strains of Hinduism). Thus, each track is named according to a particular frequency, and each is built on a single droned pitch, sung by Anderson — though other pitches are often layered quietly around the central one. Beats enter the picture as well, from time to time, and occasional melodic melismas. The result is an album that those so inclined can use as an aid to meditation, but can also serve as deeply relaxing New Age/ambient mood music.\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nThe Overtures: Original Versions\n\nConcerto Copenhagen / Lars Ulrich Mortensen\n\nCPO (dist. Naxos)\n\n555 346-2\n\nBach’s four overtures BWV 1066-1069 (also known as the Orchestral Suites) are most commonly played in late arrangements that include tympani and trumpets. But there is evidence to suggest that the earliest versions were written for strings and minimal winds, with no percussion, and that these elements were added later when Bach was working in Leipzig and had more musicians available to him. This is the premise on which the Concerto Copenhagen’s performance is based; the use of a single musician on each part further pares down the sound. The result is a crisp and sprightly recording and an interesting musicological argument, one that will certainly be of interest to libraries supporting a curriculum in early music practice. For sheer listening pleasure, some will prefer this to more traditional, larger-scale arrangements, but that feeling won’t be universal.\n\nUnknown Composers\n\nMesses anonymes\n\nCut Circle / Rodin\n\nMusique en Wallonie (dist. Naxos)\n\nMEW2097\n\nIn making this world-premiere recording of two 15th-century Masses by unknown Belgian composers, the Cut Circle ensemble (under the direction of Jesse Rodin) made a bold decision: given the supreme rhythmic and contrapuntal difficulty of these works, they would avoid the obvious performing choice (camouflaging potential errors with large vocal forces and a reverberant acoustic) and instead lean into the difficulty, recording in a dry acoustic with only four voices. The result is a breathtakingly impressive and beautiful musical document, one that lays the complexity of the music out for all to hear while also making clear how exceptionally beautiful it is. As they always do, Cut Circle perform with a bracing mix of precision and passion. What a shame that the composers of these Mass settings are unknown; I’d love to hear more from them. For all classical collections.\n\nArvo Pärt\n\nStabat Mater\n\nChor des Bayerischen Rundfunks; Münchner Rundfunksorchester / Repušić\n\nBR-Klassik (dist. Naxos)\n\n900335\n\nArvo Pärt\n\nTabula Rasa\n\nOrchestre de Chambre de Lausanne / Capuçon\n\nErato/Warner Classics\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nEstonian composer Arvo Pärt is celebrated for both his choral and his instrumental music, and these two discs offer an attractive entree into both. Each of these albums features a different version of one of Pärt’s more popular pieces, Fratres, which was originally written for an unspecified combination of instruments but is most often played on violin and piano. Under the direction of violinist Renaud Capuçon, the Lausanne Chamber Orchestra plays a relatively lush 1992 arrangement for strings and percussion, whereas the one conducted by Ivan Repušić is a sparer version that leaves out the violin soloist. Repušić uses Fratres as an introduction to an album that builds through several orchestral pieces before culminating in Pärt’s dramatic setting of the Stabat Mater text, which is sung with hushed intensity by the Chor des Bayerischen Rundfunks. The Capuçon album consists entirely of chamber and orchestral works, including the title composition, the very popular Spiegel im Spiegel, and the less-frequently recorded Für Lennart in memoriam. I find that conductors and musicians who take on this music tend to love it quite intensely, and that love is well in evidence on both of these excellent recordings.\n\nVarious Composers\n\nRoyal Requiem (compilation; 5 discs)\n\nVarious Ensembles\n\nAlpha Classics/Outhere (dist. Naxos)\n\nALPHA 779\n\nCourt composers wrote both sacred and secular music in honor of their royal patrons, and regularly that meant writing funeral music for them. The Requiem (a Mass setting written explicitly for funerary purposes) was one of the most important commissions a court composer could receive, and this five-disc set brings together previously released albums that document such compositions across several centuries. It begins with the 15th-century Requiem d’Anne de Bretagne by the under-recognized Antoine de Févin (performed exquisitely by the Doulce Mémoire ensemble), then proceeds to the mid-18th century with Nicoló Jommelli’s Requiem for Princess Maria Augusta von Thurn und Taxis (a work reputedly written in three days). Then we jump to nearly the turn of the 19th century with Sigismund Neukomm’s and Luigi Cherubini’s Requiems for Louis XVI, which are followed by the setting in honor of Marie Antoinette by Charles-Henri Plantade. With the final disc we jump back to the baroque period with funerary Masses by Gilles Henri Hayne (for Marie de Medici) and Johann Joseph Fux (for Emperor Leopold I’s widow Eleonora of Neubeurg), which bracket Henry Purcell’s Funeral Sentences for the Death of Queen Mary II. This set nicely documents one of the most centrally important manifestations of sacred music across European history, in very fine recordings. Libraries that don’t already own the original issues would do well to pick up this conveniently-packaged box.\n\nJAZZ\n\nAndrew Cyrille Quartet\n\nThe News\n\nECM\n\n2681\n\nHaving seen this group live at the Village Vanguard a few years ago, I can testify to what they’re capable of; drummer/leader Andrew Cyrille plays with an unusual sensitivity and an incredible sonic palette, which makes him a perfect match with guitarist Bill Frisell and bassist Ben Street. Regular keyboardist/synthesist Richard Teitenbaum has been sidelined by health issues, but he is ably replaced on this album by David Virelles, whose pianism in particular brings a new and lovely dimension to the group’s sound. Some of this music is conventionally jazzy (the blues-based Frisell composition “Go Happy Lucky” is particularly delightful), but there’s lots of abstract avant-gardism as well (note in particular the freewheeling title track). Creating abstract avant-gardism of undeniable beauty is the Andrew Cyrille Quartet’s stock in trade, and they do it with aplomb on this remarkable album.\n\nJosh Werner\n\nMode for Titan\n\nM.O.D. Reloaded\n\nMODRL00105\n\nBassist Josh Werner has created something difficult to categorize with his first full solo album. I’m slotting it into the Jazz section because I suspect it’s jazz fans that will find it most interesting, but the music itself is quite unique. Utilizing multitracking and various electronic effects (and the highly varied tones and timbres of sitar bass, seven-string bass, and fretless bass), Werner creates compositions that define large sonic spaces but that are always warm and often groovy even though there’s no percussion and no chordal instruments involved. This is a guy who has worked with artists as diverse as Ghostface Killah, Cibo Matto, CocoRosie, and PopCaan — so it won’t come as a surprise that his influences are widely varied. And with production by Bill Laswell, you know the recorded sound will be rich and deep. Very interesting and very cool.\n\nJacqueline Kerrod\n\n17 Days in December: Solo Improvisations for Acoustic & Electric Harp\n\nOrenda\n\n0093\n\nHarpist Jacqueline Kerrod is classically trained — and extensively so, having begun her studies at age nine — but over the years her approach to the instrument has branched out into a variety of extended techniques and musical styles. Her résumé includes work with artists as diverse as Kanye West, Rufus Wainwright, and avant-jazz legend Anthony Braxton, as well as more traditional classical gigs. On her solo debut, she dives into the world of solo improvisation, alternating between acoustic harp (sometimes treated with mechanical alterations) and an electric instrument (with the addition of electronic effects). The music she creates here is sometimes a bit abrasive and difficult, and sometimes immediately accessible and conventionally beautiful. Interestingly, some of the most lovely tracks are those that are least recognizable as having been produced by a harp; “Glare,” with its extensive use of volume pedals, distortion, and reverb, is one such, as is the pulsing “Strummed I.” The electro-acoustic “Glassy Fingers” and “Broken: In 3” both evoke John Cage’s sonatas and interludes for prepared piano, but with much more melodic interest. All of it is fascinating and well worth hearing.\n\nErrol Garner\n\nSymphony Hall Concert\n\nOctave Music/Mack Avenue\n\nMAC1189\n\nTo celebrate the 100th birthday of legendary pianist and composer Erroll Garner, the University of Pittsburgh (where Garner’s archives are housed) and the Erroll Garner Project have collaborated to created a three-tiered release of commemorative recordings. At the top of the pyramid is this one-disc recording of his concert at Boston’s Symphony Hall in January, 1959. Leading a trio that includes bassist Eddie Calhoun and drummer Kelly Martin, Garner walks us through the history of jazz, looking back to the days of stride and barrelhouse piano on “I Can’t Get Started” and to the bebop era on “Bernie’s Tune,” while (as drummer Terri Lyne Carrington points out in the liner notes) also anticipating pianistic styles to come during the 1960s. His ability to conjure an entire orchestra on the piano is everywhere evident, but nowhere more so than on his bravura rendition of “Dreamy.” This is a magnificent recording that should find a home in every library’s jazz collection. (Those with deeper pockets should consider one of the deluxe box-set versions of this album that are also being made available.)\n\nFOLK/COUNTRY\n\nTwisted Pine\n\nRight Now\n\nSignature Sounds\n\nSIG CD 2121\n\nTwisted Pine apparently used to be a bluegrass band, though I have to say, as a latecomer to this band’s music, that I’m having a hard time imagining it. Yes, singer/fiddler Kathleen Parks definitely plays in a style with roots in Appalachia, and the same for jazzy mandolinist Dan Bui. But flutist Anh Phung is coming more from a Celtic place and also from a jazz place (check her solo on “Amadeus Party”), while Chris Satori’s bass is jazzy/funky all the way down. Which, I guess, is another way of saying that these guys represent the new generation of New Acoustic Music, alongside artists like the Punch Brothers, Nickel Creek, and Crooked Still. The best way to enjoy this thoroughly charming album, though, is to try and forget genre boundaries and just give yourself up to the funky, folky, poppy fun.\n\nFelice Brothers\n\nFrom Dreams to Dust\n\nYep Roc (dist. Redeye)\n\nYEP-2779\n\nIt takes a minute to get used to Ian Felice’s singing — he’s got that Dylan-y tendency to swipe at notes rather than hit them — but that doesn’t really matter much of the time, because some of these songs are practically spoken-word pieces, while others (like “Inferno”) alternate between verses and sung choruses. When these guys do write tunes, they tend to be really nice ones; the Felices have a real way with a melody, and they support the melodies with sturdy roots-folk-rock grooves. And then you notice the topical lyrics (“Tick tock goes the doomsday clock,” etc.) and the wryly absurdist ones (“Once spent over two months stuck in a painting by Bruegel the Elder,” etc.), and then you notice the production: rich, gritty, spacious but not airy. This album was my first introduction to the Felice Brothers, and I have to say I’m intrigued.\n\nMarina Allen\n\nCandlepower (EP)\n\nFire (dist. Redeye)\n\nFIRE633\n\nLucy Gooch\n\nRain’s Break (EP)\n\nFire\n\nFIRE636\n\nMarina Allen’s seven-song EP evokes a lost era of folk-pop by women; you’ll hear stylistic echoes of Joni Mitchell, Laura Nyro, and Judee Sill, but don’t be fooled — this music is 100% modern, with carefully elaborate production (“Believer”) bumping up alongside minimalist, acoustic singer-songwriter fare (“Ophelia”). Don’t be fooled by her voice, either; it’s light but not soft, tender but not wispy. I kind of wish Candlepower were a full-length album. Same goes for Rain’s Break by Lucy Gooch, an even shorter EP that I admit doesn’t really fit the Folk/Country category but seemed like a good companion entry anyway. Gooch is working in a more cinematic/ambient mode, with quiet and wispy vocals layered over floating synths and occasional very subtle beats (“Chained to a Woman”). Her influences include not only classic film but also the sounds of women’s choirs from the 1930s, church music, and weather. Again, this is the kind of album that would ideally be about 75 minutes long, rather than 19.\n\nROCK/POP\n\nAztec Camera\n\nBackwards and Forwards: The WEA Recordings 1984-1995 (compilation; 9 discs)\n\nCherry Red (dist. MVD)\n\nQCRCDBOX112\n\nIf you weren’t around and paying attention to alternative pop music in the early- to mid-1980s, there’s a good chance you don’t have any (or much) memory of Aztec Camera. The band was really singer/songwriter Roddy Frame and a shifting array of sidemen, until he dropped the group moniker and started recording under his own name in the late 1990s. This luxurious nine-disc set (containing Aztec Camera’s five Warner albums plus four discs of live performances, alternate takes, remixes, etc.) can’t be said to contain everything you might need, because it leaves out his debut album, the triumphantly perfect High Land, Hard Rain. And it can’t be characterized as “all killer, no filler,” because it does at times devolve into superfluity (no fewer than seven mixes of “Good Morning, Britain,” a great song that nearly breaks here under the weight of over-attention) and non-necessity (the solo acoustic set from Ronnie Scott’s Club). But it would be fair to say that the studio albums represented here vary in quality from very good to outstanding, and that the disc of live 1984 performances in Glasgow and London offer powerful renditions of the High Land material. Libraries that collect pop music overlook this box at their peril. Hand-sell it to any patron who loves a colorful, fruity chord progression and an anthemic chorus.\n\nPylon\n\nBox (compilation; 4 discs)\n\nNew West (dist. Redeye)\n\nNW6503\n\nAnd heck, while we’re at it, here’s another monumental box set from a band that made its mark in the 1980s. Pylon was much more short-lived than Aztec Camera, and its influence — while significant — was a bit more subterranean. Pylon emerged from the fecund Athens, Georgia scene at the same time as the B-52s, REM, and Love Tractor. Though multiple bands from the region cite them as an important influence on their sound (and REM would record a very fine cover of “Crazy,” the group’s best song), Pylon’s tendency towards melody-free muttered/shouted vocals probably limited their appeal, despite the power of their grooves and the occasionally surprising hookiness of their songs. Pylon released only two albums formally; Gyrate and Chomp are both included here, along with Razz Tape (a collection of early studio recordings that were never released commercially) and a fourth disc consisting of other non-album and unreleased tracks. Along with the discs, the box also includes a large and lavishly produced hardcover book filled with photos and historical information. Does this package have a limited natural audience? Sure — but it’s a very devoted one, and libraries supporting research into the history of American pop music would do well to consider adding this retrospective document.\n\nThe Seshen\n\nCYAN Remixes (EP; digital only)\n\nTru Thoughts (dist. Redeye)\n\nTRUCD376\n\nIn February of this year, the San Francisco-based band The Seshen released CYAN, an album named “for a color that is both strong and soft.” It turned out to be an apt title for a release that featured ethereal, echoing vocals tethered to tight and bubbling grooves, creating a feel that was simultaneously gentle and propulsively funky. Now comes a five-track collection of remixes created by the likes of Kumar Butler, SNVS, and FEVRMOON, all of which shed a different light on the album’s original vision. But interestingly, the remixers don’t generally choose to pull their chosen tracks dramatically far from CYAN‘s overriding vibe; for example, although FEVRMOON’s take on “4AM” is a bit denser and busier than the original, it generally preserves the original version’s feel. The two exceptions are Kumar Butler’s mix of “Wander,” which playful messes around with the original’s lilting 3/4 time signature, bumping it into and out of a four-on-the-floor dance pulse, and Mahawam’s mix of “Still Dreaming,” which turns it into a sort of ambient-dub fever dream. Both this collection and the original album would make great additions to any pop collection.\n\nThe Pop Group\n\nY in Dub\n\nMute\n\nTPGYD1CD\n\nThe Pop Group’s 1979 debut, Y, was one of those “important” albums that, despite its historical significance, you have to admit is pretty tough to listen to. Jagged guitars, chugging bass, and Mark Stewart’s unhinged yowling all combine to create a sound that had a huge impact on the UK post-punk scene, and that is frankly much more impressive than enjoyable. Interestingly, that album was produced by legendary reggae producer Dennis Bovell. It had little or nothing sonically to do with reggae, but Bovell brought his highly-developed sense of space and layering to the mix. On this remix project, he applies the techniques of dub (instruments and voices dropping in and out, with varying levels of effects applied) to the original recordings, creating a wild pastiche of sounds and noises. The effect of this approach is actually a softening of the original music; with the echo and delay and the expanded sonic space, what was once a fairly assaultive listening experience becomes somewhat softer and more accessible one. Somewhat, that is. This album was a great idea and it was a long time coming.\n\nWORLD/ETHNIC\n\nMonoswezi\n\nShanu\n\nRiverboat (dist. Redeye)\n\nTUGCD1131\n\nAfro-Nordic music collective Monoswezi continue their pattern of releasing an album about every four years, and I’m continuing my pattern of recommending every single one of them. The band’s name might look like a Swahili word, but it’s actually an acronym formed by combining the first couple of letters from the names of the bandmembers’ home countries: Mozambique, Norway, Sweden, and Zimbabwe. And as one might expect, the music itself is a complex and colorful tapestry of styles built on a foundational fusion of Nordic jazz and African rhythms. This is music that simultaneously celebrated tradition and explodes it: delicate Afro-Latin beats underpin jazzy improvisations; complex time signatures are thethered to steady pulses; singer Hope Masike defiantly plays the mbira, an instrument traditionally played only by men in her home country. And the songs are wonderful. Highly recommended.\n\nVarious Artists\n\nSub Signals, Vol. 2: Selected and Mixed by Gaudi\n\nDubmission (dist. MVD)\n\nCDDUBM123\n\nGaudi is one of the most celebrated producers, remixers, and creators of original music on the always-bubbling global dub scene. His second contribution to the Sub Signals series is billed, accurately, as a “deep dive into underground bass”; to create this compilation Gaudi dug deep into his crates and, it appears, cashed in a few IOUs, resulting in a generous and blissfully heavy collection of tracks by the likes of Steel Pulse, African Head Charge, Paolini Dub Files, the Orb, and Alpha Steppa — some of them previously unreleased in any format. The sounds are a mix of analog and digital, and the sonic spaces are consistently both huge and microscopically detailed. If, like me, you somehow slept on Sub Signals Vol. 1, then take this as your cue to pick up both collections.\n\nKhöömei Beat\n\nChangys Baglaash\n\nARC Music (dist. Naxos)\n\nEUCD2954\n\nTraditional Tuvan throat singing and rock’n’roll might not seem like an obvious combination, but hey — we live in a world of less-than-obvious musical fusions these days, and all the better for that, I say. Khöömei Beat play a mix of modern and traditional instruments in support of vocals that veer back and forth between conventional singing and the Tuvan people’s particular approach to throat singing — a technique that uses guttural vocalization to produce overtones, which are then manipulated by changing the shape of the mouth while the singer maintains a steady fundamental pitch. It’s a unique sound, surely not to everyone’s taste, but always interesting and objectively impressive. Combine it with punky bass and guitars, aggressive drums, and an array of regional traditional instruments and you have an album that is sure to enliven any party.\n\nJah Sun & The Rising Tide\n\nRunning Through Walls (digital only)\n\nAMT Entertainment\n\nNo cat. no.\n\nHere’s some tight and tuneful roots reggae from the Bay Area. Jah Sun and his band have been lighting up the California reggae scene for some time now, and you can hear a tightness and discipline in their sound that comes only with lots and lots of gigging. Honestly, I’m always a bit uncomfortable when white American guys acquire Jamaican accents to sing reggae, but Jah Sun does it only very subtly — and the quality of his songs is so consistently high that it’s easy to just go with it. Interestingly, while some of this material is straight-up modern roots, other songs push the stylistic boundaries: for example, the title track is more reggae-adjacent than reggae, while “Stuck with You” is sort of a soca-pop fusion (and works very well). But there’s not a weak track here, no matter what the genre or style, and Jah Sun’s consistent message of positivity and uplift is a joy. Highly recommended to all reggae and/or pop collections.\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nStephen Yip\n\nQuietude: Music of Stephen Yip\n\nVarious Ensembles/Soloists\n\nAlbany\n\nTROY1873\n\nDoug Bielmeier\n\nAmbient Works\n\nAlbany\n\nTROY1860\n\nThe titles of these two new releases on the Albany label might lead you to expect similar listening experiences, but in fact they are very different. Quietude presents compositions for soloists and chamber ensembles by Stephen Yip, who was raised in Hong Kong and educated both there and at Rice University in Texas. The music presented here is indeed often quiet, but it’s also challenging, characterized by extended instrumental techniques and often by harmonic dissonance. (Topic: the ensemble piece Tranquility in Consonance III is neither tranquil nor consonant. Discuss.) The title work is perhaps the most difficult, but I was especially captivated by White Dew, for flute and bass flute, which calls on the musicians to create a wide variety of tones and effects in a highly reverberant acoustic. This is a fascinating and wonderful album that gives the listener plenty to chew on. Doug Bielmeier’s Ambient Works, on the other hand, comes much closer to providing exactly what its title promises: quiet and minimal ambient music, based on computer-generated sounds, samples, and (in one case) live instruments. But even here there are some crunchier moments: Photo Lab Sanctuary is a “soundwalk” piece built on environmental samples that don’t exactly soothe or lull the listener; Backscatter sounds like a cross between a Steve Reich phase piece and something Carl Stone might write when in a puckish mood. No Time is written for a quartet of clarinet, violin, cello, and piano, though the music is altered and processed to the point that its sonic origins are somewhat obscured. This isn’t ambient music to fall asleep to — but it’s consistently interesting and frequently deeply beautiful.\n\nFranz Anton Hoffmeister\n\n6 Clarinet Quartets\n\nEddy Vanoosthuyse; Zemlinsky Quartet\n\nAntarctica (dist. Naxos)\n\nAR 032\n\nGeorge Friedrich Fuchs\n\nClarinet Chamber Music\n\nItalian Classical Consort / Luigi Magistrelli\n\nBrilliant Classics (dist. Naxos)\n\nBRI 96305\n\nFranz Hoffmeister came to Vienna in 1754, at age 14, to study law. But after completing his degree he stayed on to pursue his real passion, which was music composition. Although he had success writing music, he made his money as a publisher, and has only in recent years begun to receive his full due as a composer — and now, after years of neglect, some of his most popular works are his chamber pieces for clarinet and string trio. On this recording, the very fine Belgian clarinetist Eddy Vanoosthuyse joins three members of the Zemlinsky Quartet (all playing modern instruments) to provide us a tour of these six innovative and charming pieces, all of which are actually arrangements of pieces originally written for flute and strings or oboe and strings; this approach reflects the growing popularity of the clarinet in 18th-century Europe. Vanoosthuyse and the Zemlinskys play them with both sensitivity to period style and an admirable panache, using dynamic shifts carefully to bring out the full genius of these lovely quartets. George Friedrich Fuchs was working in France at the same time as Hoffmeister in Vienna, and while he never achieved the same notoriety as Hoffmeister, his chamber works for clarinet (in various combinations with other instruments) receive deserved attention here from the Italian Classical Consort, again on modern instruments, under the baton of clarinetist Luigi Magistrelli. There is a duo for clarinet and horn; trios for clarinets, for two clarinets and bassoon, and for two clarinets and violin; and arrangements of opera arias for various combinations of clarinets and other wind instruments. This is music of great charm, if not world-changing innovation, and this recording offers a welcome opportunity to hear from one of the minor but still considerable talents of the classical era. (Why the album cover features an image of someone playing an oboe is something of a mystery.) Both are recommended to all libraries.\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nThree or One\n\nFred Thomas; Aisha Orazbayeva; Lucy Railton\n\nECM\n\n2649\n\nJohann Sebastian Bach\n\nBach for Two\n\nRomina Lischka; Marnix De Cat\n\nRamée/Outhere (dist. Naxos)\n\nRAM2005\n\nHere we have two very different applications of the art of transcription to the music of J.S. Bach. The first is by pianist Fred Thomas, who has arranged an array of selections from Bach’s legendary Orgelbüchlein (“little organ book”) for a trio of piano, violin, and cello. Thomas chose violinist Aisha Orazbayeva and cellist Lucy Railton because he was familiar with their work as a duo and knew of their tendency towards “lean sonorities,” which the listener will notice — in fact, if I hadn’t known better I’d have assumed they were playing gut-strung instruments. Thomas’ arrangements are thoughtful, and the trio’s playing is more intensely emotional than one might expect. This is a quiet triumph of an album. “Quiet triumph” would also be an apt descriptor of Bach for Two, a collection of transcriptions of organ sonatas, arias, and other miscellanea for viola da gamba and organ, along with a setting of the BWV1027 sonata for viol and keyboard. While it might seem as if the mighty organ would inevitably overwhelm the much softer and wispier tonalities of the viola da gamba, in fact they complement each other beautifully on these arrangements (due in part to skillful production). Lischka and De Cat have long experience playing together, and it shows; their shared depth of understanding of and deep affection for Bach’s organ and chamber music come out with every note.\n\nJAZZ\n\nChampian Fulton & Stephen Fulton\n\nLive from Lockdown\n\nChampian\n\nCR004\n\nA new album from Champian Fulton is always cause for celebration, and when she’s joined by her father, the outstanding flugelhorn and trumpet player Stephen Fulton, you can be assured of a warm, complex, and golden-toned musical experience. As a singer, Champian acts as a sort of prism: through her brain and her voice, the melodic playfulness of Billie Holiday and the impeccable intonation of Ella Fitzgerald and the strutting confidence of Sarah Vaughn are all refracted and emerge as a unique expressive identity; as a pianist, she’s like a history book come to life, switching between (and sometimes blending) stride, bebop, boogie-woogie, and cool styles seemingly without effort. This latest album is, as its title suggests, the product of the Fultons’ forced shift from live-in-person performance to livestreamed concerts produced at home. It consists almost entirely of standards, mostly ballads and mid-tempo swingers like “You’ve Changed,” “Satin Doll,” “Look for the Silver Lining,” and “Moonglow,” with a couple of lovely originals thrown in as well. As always, both Fultons play not only with skill but with heart, and with a rare level of interpersonal communication. For all libraries.\n\nFessor\n\nGlad to Be Here\n\nStoryville (dist. Naxos)\n\nSVL1014345\n\nOver the course of his long career, trombonist and composer Ole Lindgreen (a.k.a. Fessor) has released almost 40 albums under his own name, not counting the scores of releases on which he has appeared as a sideman. On Glad to Be Here — an album reportedly recorded around the dining table in his home — he looks back on that illustrious career, revisiting such trad and swing standards as “Louisiana,” “Moten Swing,” “Azure,” and “Drop Me Off in Harlem,” working with a septet that includes clarinetist Chris Tanner and bassist Jens Sølund and that frequently manages to sound like a big band despite its actual size. Lindgreen and his boys shift gracefully from slippery second-line rhythms to powerful 1930s-era swing and back again, playing constantly with an uncanny blend of emotive soul and sophisticated, almost academic precision. Maybe that’s why they call him Fessor.\n\nGraham Dechter\n\nMajor Influence\n\nCapri\n\n74158-2\n\nGuitarist Graham Dechter is back for another outing as leader on an all-originals program (well, almost — it includes a lovely arrangement of “Pure Imagination” from the first Willy Wonka movie) leading an all-star quartet that includes pianist Tamir Hendelman, bassist John Clayton, and master drummer Jeff Hamilton. It’s always a sign of mature confidence when a guitarist chooses to share space with a pianist, and Dechter demonstrates that confidence (and exceptional taste) in his choice of Hendelman, with whom he comfortably and companionably shares the middle pitch range and the chordal duties on this outstanding album. The blues is a recurring element on these tunes, and it’s in the blues pocket that Dechter seems particularly happy and free, but honestly there are no weak tracks here. One of my favorites was “Bent on Monk,” a lovely tribute on which Dechter incorporates elements of Thelonious Monk tunes (and technique) into a hard-swinging original that never attempts to ape the one to whom he’s paying tribute. Recommended to all collections.\n\nChick Corea Akoustic Band\n\nLive (2 discs)\n\nConcord Jazz\n\nCJA00291\n\nNever having been a big fan of his electric fusion stuff — the music for which he really became famous in the 1970s — I’ve always been quite interested in the late Chick Corea’s more straight-ahead, acoustic work. Since 1989 he’s worked intermittently with what he calls the Akoustic Band: himself on piano, John Pattitucci on bass, and (with the exception of one recording) Dave Weckl on drums. The trio has made one studio album and now three live albums; this one documents two sets played at the SPC Music Hall in Florida in January of 2018. The program consists of a mix of standards and Corea compositions, and the group plays with the suppleness and freedom that comes from years of working together, however sporadically. You can hear the fusion backgrounds of all three players, particularly in the soloing (I especially hear it when Weckl gets a chance to stretch out), and the tension between that stylistic tendency and the straight-ahead jazz framework within which they’re playing creates some wonderful moments. Highlights include a searching and tender rendition of “In a Sentimental Mood” and their thrilling take on one of my favorite standards of all time, “On Green Dolphin Street.”\n\nFOLK/COUNTRY\n\nAna Egge\n\nBetween Us\n\nStorysound (dist. Redeye)\n\nSSS-043\n\nSinger-songwriter Ana Egge takes off in something of a new direction on this, her twelfth album. Opening with the gently chugging, horn-driven “Wait a Minute” and then proceeding through a program of generally quiet and heartfelt tracks dealing with troubled relationships (“You Hurt Me,” “Heartbroken Kind”), political conflict within families (“Lie, Lie, Lie”), the death of a loved one (“We Lay Roses”), etc. Her roots in the acoustic music scene are very much evident throughout, but the production on this album is bigger and lusher than usual: steel guitars, rockish distortion, and the aforementioned horns show up every so often to give a new weight and depth to her sound. Egge’s way with a melody is subtle and engaging, as is her voice, one that can go from a whisper to a full-chested declamation so smoothly and naturally that you hardly notice the transition. My favorite couplet from this very fine album: “We let the devil come between us/And now he doesn’t want to go.”\n\nJeremy Stephens\n\nHow I Hear It\n\nRebel\n\nREB-CD-1877\n\nMulti-instrumentalist Jeremy Stephens is best known as the frontman for High Fidelity, but he also has a long history as a sideman, working with the likes of Jesse McReynolds, the Lilly Brothers, the Chuck Wagon Gang, and others. Here he breaks out of both molds and offers us a glimpse of his own personal musical vision. As it turns out, that vision is both deeply rooted in tradition and slyly eclectic. His banjo playing draws both on the Scruggs-era verities and the single-string innovations of Don Reno; when he plays mandolin he slides back and forth between hard-driving traditional approaches and the more elegant cross-picking style popularized by Jesse McReynolds. He also plays guitar on this album, beautifully, and sings — and when his wife and collaborator Corrina Rose Logston joins him in harmony, the effect is exquisite. There are so many highlights on this joyful, varied album that it’s hard to pick just one or two, but “You’ll Be Lonesome Too” is a bittersweet joy, and the album-opening rendition of the Reno & Smiley classic “Sockeye” is also especially tasty. For all libraries.\n\nMyriam Gendron\n\nMa délire: Songs of Love Lost & Found\n\nFeeding Tube (dist. Forced Exposure)\n\nFTR 639CD\n\nLaurel Premo\n\nGolden Loam\n\nLaurel Premo Sound\n\n2431189X\n\nThis is an interesting temporal coincidence: two simultaneous releases by unrelated female singers/guitarists, each creating and exploring a conceptually related but very different territory of folk/experimental guitar-based music. Myriam Gendron does so through a Québecois lens: sometimes singing in English and sometimes in French, she delivers fuzz-heavy doom-folk on “C’Est dans les vieux pays” and then switches to unadorned acoustic guitar for an instrumental rendition of “Shenandoah” (a tune that is revisited vocally, and in French, at the end of the album). She sings John Jacob Niles’ “I Wonder As I Wander” alongside understated winds and strings, and makes “Le tueur des femmes” sound lighter than it really is. Laurel Premo’s Golden Loam is more guitar-focused, and more electric; Premo’s approach is more Southern-U.S.-based, with slide guitar blues and gospel tunes rubbing up against gorgeous oddities like the Norwegian fiddle tune “Torbjørn Bjellands Bruremarsj.” There’s not much singing on this album, but when she pipes up on “Hop High” her voice is understated and perfect. Both of these albums are recommended to all libraries.\n\nROCK/POP\n\nVarious Artists\n\nThe Sun Shines Here: The Roots of Indie-pop 1980-1984 (3 discs)\n\nCherry Red (dist. MVD)\n\nCRCDBOX114\n\nThe Cherry Red label continues to produce essential box-set anthologies documenting pop music history from the later 20th century, showing particular strength in music from in and around the 1970s punk revolution. The latest is this one, which shines light on some obscure corners of the indie pop scene of the early 1980s — indie pop being distinguished from mainstream pop by its general weirdness, and from post-punk by its almost entire rejection of guitar distortion. Cherry Red being an English label, the manifestations of indie pop on offer here are all British: relatively famous names like Aztec Camera, Prefab Sprout, Everything But the Girl, and Scritti Politti are all represented, as are many artists from whom we never heard again (I’m looking at you, Dolly Mixture), and quite a bit of the material on these three discs has never been available on CD before. It’s a mixed bag, of course, but a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable one. Libraries that acquired Cherry Red’s Scared to Get Happy box back in 2013 will find that this one serves essentially as a sequel to it. Libraries that collect deeply in pop music and didn’t pick that one up should probably grab both of them now.\n\nVarious Artists\n\nR&B in DC 1940-1960: Rhythm & Blues, Doo Wop, Rockin’ Rhythm and More… (16 discs)\n\nBear Family (dist. MVD)\n\nGCD 17052\n\nLike all box sets on the Bear Family label, this one is a monument of music and scholarship — and one more in an ongoing series of gauntlets thrown down in front of the American music establishment by a German company that seems much more dedicated to the preservation and celebration of America’s musical heritage than any of the latter country’s own labels are. In this case, the specific slice of heritage under consideration is the spectrum of African American pop music styles that flourished in the Washington, DC area during the middle two decades of the 20th century. Over the course of 16 CDs (and a lavishly illustrated, LP-sized, 350-page hardbound book), this set documents the development of early R&B, jump blues, doo wop, and gospel music during that fertile period, drawing on records unearthed at regional swap meets, flea markets, yard sales, and record stores by radio host and music researcher Jay Bruder and painstakingly transferred and restored. Not only is the sound quality consistently excellent, but the accompanying book is a triumph of popular music scholarship: every track is annotated — some in astonishing historical detail — and the book itself is gorgeous, handsomely bound in such a way that it lies flat no matter what page you open to. The music itself is not consistently excellent, and that’s part of the point of the project: clunkers are presented alongside little-known masterpieces, giving us a fully-textured overview of the DC music scene at a critical point in American cultural history. But the ratio of dross to gold is highly favorable: for every eight or ten spine-tingling appearance by, say, Billy Eckstine or the Cruisers or the Young Gospel Singers, there might be a silly novelty tune or a throwaway formula exercise by someone else. (And since some artists are represented by ten or more entries, even the quality of music from individual artists and groups is somewhat uneven.) Again, though, this is the point: like most Bear Family boxes, this is one is as much about learning as about listening, which makes it a natural fit for library collections — well-funded library collections, that is, as this one lists for about $300. Very highly recommended.\n\nMarshall Crenshaw\n\nThe Wild, Exciting Sounds of Marshall Crenshaw: Live in the 20th and 21st Century (2 discs)\n\nSunset Blvd\n\nCD-SBR-7003\n\nAmerica has lots of songwriters, and a few of them are commercially successful. Of the commercially successful ones, a few are masters of the form. Marshall Crenshaw is one of that very select group. He has also been, for several decades now, a dynamite live performer, as this two-disc set illustrates. The first disc documents performances from 1982 and 1983 in the Boston and New York areas (leading a band that included his brothers Robert and John). The sound quality of these live recordings is generally good, though at times it’s unfortunately distorted (note, for example, “Whenever You’re on My Mind”). In a live context, classic tunes like “Cynical Girl” and “Mary Anne” take on an extra element of joyful abandon, and we get a clearer view of the raw rockabilly underpinnings of a song like “Got a Lot of Livin’ to Do.” On disc 2 we get to hear both solo and band performances from 1991 and 2014, and while these are quite good they’re honestly not quite as compelling as the earlier recordings. Overall, though, this album is a solid winner.\n\nPere Ubu\n\nSt. Arkansas (reissue)\n\nFire (dist. Redeye)\n\nFIRECD372\n\nPere Ubu\n\nPennsylvania (reissue)\n\nFire\n\nFIRECD371\n\nSince its inception in the mid-1970s, Cleveland’s proto-art-punk stalwarts Pere Ubu have been blazing an entirely unique trail through the thickets of rock, punk, art-rock, and even straight-up pop music. By 1998, when Pennsylvania was originally issued, only frontman David Thomas and guitarists Jim Jones and Tom Herman remained from the group’s earliest days; by 2002, when St. Arkansas came out, Jones’ declining health had moved him to the sidelines; he was a featured player on the album but no longer a fully functioning member of the band. (Sadly, he would die a few years later, at age 57.) These two albums are among the darkest of the band’s discography, though not the most weird or experimental: while the pop hooks that abounded on albums like Cloudland and Worlds in Collision are nowhere to be found here, the fundamental structure is fairly standard-issue rock’n’roll, with the standard overlay of bloopy synths and Thomas’ uniquely squeaky, yelping vocals delivering distinctly odd lyrics. Longstanding Ubu themes of American geography, highways, and place names continue to thread through these albums — no songs about birds, though. Both albums were remixed by Thomas for the reissue.\n\nWORLD/ETHNIC\n\nLee “Scratch” Perry\n\nRoast Fish, Collie Weed, and Corn Bread (reissue)\n\nVP\n\nVP1000.2\n\nWith the recent passing of legendary reggae producer Lee “Scratch” Perry, you can anticipate lots of reissues and tribute albums over the next year or so. Some will be outstanding; some will be dodgy money-grabs. This one is gold. Perry is mostly known as a producer who created an utterly unique studio sound and was at the helm for some of reggae’s most enduring recordings by the likes of the Heptones, Junior Byles, the Congos, and even Bob Marley and the Wailers. But this album represents Perry as an artist, singing his uniquely weird lyrics over classic Black Ark backing tracks. Songs like “Throw Some Water In” and “Free Up the Weed” are not only great Perry songs, they’re classics of classical-era 1970s reggae. (Though he probably should have left “Curly Locks” alone, since his performance of it pales terribly in comparison to Byles‘.) This CD is not actually a new reissue, but since the album is being reissued on red vinyl for Record Store Day I thought I’d take the opportunity to encourage all libraries to pick up the CD version. This is an absolutely essential piece of reggae history.\n\nDennis Bovell Meets Dubblestandart\n\n@Repulse “Reggae Classics”\n\nEcho Beach\n\nEB160\n\nThis album represents a summit meeting of two reggae legends: from the old school, London-based bassist/producer Dennis Bovell (a.k.a. Blackbeard); and from the new school, Vienna’s Dubblestandart, perhaps Europe’s foremost exponents of heavy modernist roots reggae. The album’s inscrutable title notwithstanding, it’s a straightforward affair: reworks of classic reggae tunes from Jamaican and UK bands like Matumbi, Steel Pulse, Twinkle Brothers, and Culture, with Dubblestandart providing the backing tracks and Bovell singing and producing. Delightfully, the album is presented in “showcase” style, with each vocal version followed by a dub mix. Songs like “Jah Jah See Dem a Come” and “Hypocrite” may be familiar fare, but these versions shed fresh light on them and the mighty Dubblestandart crew do an excellent job of making them their own. And Bovell’s production is brilliant as always. Highly recommended.\n\nNative Soul\n\nTeenage Dreams\n\nAwesome Tapes from Africa\n\nATFA043\n\nIn recent months I’ve kind of fallen in love with amapiano, a dance music genre that emerged in South Africa about ten years ago. Although it’s rooted in house music (and I really hate house music), I find it irresistible somehow: the four-on-the-floor beats that make house so tedious to my ears somehow manage to be both soothing and propulsive here, and the layers of samples and melodic fragments that create the body of the sound are both often weird and frequently uplifting. Native Soul is a duo who produce some of the most attractive examples of amapiano I’ve yet heard, and their new release is a gentle triumph of color and texture. From the bumping opening track “The Beginning” to the album-closing “End of Time,” the steady 115-bpm chug and the creative building up of musical layers is a delight. If your library has a collecting interest in sub-Saharan pop music, this album is a must-have.\n\nCLASSICAL\n\nAugustin Pfleger\n\nThe Life and Passion of the Christ\n\nOrkester Nord; Vox Nidrosiensis / Martin Wåhlberg\n\nAparte Music (dist. Integral)\n\nAP249\n\nThough almost entirely unknown today, the Bohemian composer Augustin Pfleger was an influential figure in the transition from the late Renaissance to the early baroque, one who was widely praised by his contemporaries. This important and unusual recording takes six of Pfleger’s “sacred concertos” (what we would now c"
