Ms. Sayer’s trio will include Corey Gemme (trumpet) & Greg Cohen (string bass).\n\nCynthia Sayer (banjo & vocals)\n\nPraised for her “drive and virtuosity” by The New York Times, instrumentalist/vocalist/bandleader Cynthia Sayer is renowned for bringing the swinging sounds of banjo to concert and festival audiences worldwide. A 2023 Steve Martin Banjo Prize winner and an American Banjo Hall of Famer, Sayer is a pioneering artist who pays tribute to America’s musical heritage through her virtuoso playing, engaging vocals, and informative, entertaining anecdotes. Sayer is a multi-instrumentalist heard on feature film and TV soundtracks and has appeared on numerous national TV and radio shows, performed at The White House, played with The New York Philharmonic and The New York Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, and is a longtime founding member of Woody Allen’s New Orleans Jazz Band.
