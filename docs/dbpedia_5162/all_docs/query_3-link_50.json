        "text": "Before the somewhat surprising reformation of King Crimson, if you wanted your fix of all things KC, you had to go to the Robert Fripp-approved tribute band, consisting of all ex members of Crimson, with the exception of Jakko, who was not an ex member, but is NOW a member, along with Mel Collins.\n\nOne thing for fans to note is that even though this is NOT King Crimson, they concentrate solely on the first four albums by King Crimson, as well as the closely related McDonald & Giles album!...\n\nThe second and final of the 'second wave' line-up of 5uus (basically Dave Kerman, Bob Drake and Sanjay Kumar + guests). This is considered by many people to be their best period and I would probably agree.\n\n\"Second installment from monster band 5UU's, featuring rock complexity, extraordinary production (by bassist and singer Bob Drake) and high energy precision mixed with eccentric song-writing. People that work this hard are becoming an endangered species. Extraordinary.\"-Chris Cutler\n\n“The highly collectable and legendary 1972 self-titled album by 9.30 Fly.\n\nFormed in Cheltenham in 1971, 9.30 were a highly original band who took in folk and progressive influences in their work. The line-up featured Michael Wainwright (vocals), Barbara Wainwright (vocals, keyboards), Lyn Oakey (guitar), Gary Charman (bass) and Mike Clark (drums).\n\nReleased on the Ember label in 1972, \"9.30 Fly\" is legendary for the originality of the music within and also for it's great rarity. Although the...\n\n“4th full length opus from California's genius multi-instrumentalist Leila Abdul-Rauf. \"Phantasiai\", in Hellenistic philosophy, are our impressions, the ways in which the world is represented through our senses, preceding actual thoughts. This is where music-making lies; in the space between senses and thoughts, having the power to express where words fall short. This new album is comprised of two suites, each containing four movements, composed almost entirely from modulated live trumpet, glockenspiel...\n\n\"Without a doubt, this is one of the holy grails of the Japanese early seventies lysergic psych scene, together with Speed Glue & Shinki, Sato Masahiko & Soundbreakers and People/Ceremony.\n\nPrivately released in a tiny edition on the Oz Records label way back in 1973, the original artifact was and is till this day the only legitimate recording on vinyl to feature the Rallizes and Acid Seven, in addition to a side each from Minami Masato and the legendary Taj Mahal Travellers.\n\nNew double-CD ...\n\nYes, after something like 40 years, Acqua Fragile return and it's genuinely them; I've heard this and fans of their original albums, as well as 70s Rock Progressivo Italiano will not be disappointed!\n\n\"A brand new album by Italian Progressive Rock legends Acqua Fragile. Along with compatriots PFM (for whom Bernard Lanzetti’s stunning vocal prowess graced several classic albums), Acqua Fragile were true progressive rock pioneers in the 1970s.\n\nA New Chant features original members Piero Canavera.\n\n“An unknown and precious album recorded in 1975 by two friends who recorded one side each, they made just two acetates and then handmade beautiful covers from two enlargements of a photograph of the Isles of St Kilda.\n\nSide one is a neo classical prog rock epic in the style of Renaissance and Continuum, inspired by the wild and pagan isles of St Kilda where, as a 16 yr old, the composer Peter McKerrow was taken by military launch to conduct a census on the rare Soay Sheep that live there. A storm...\n\n“Peter McKerrow revisits the experimental electronic composition he made in 1975 after a life altering trip to the Isle of St Kilda. He worked on the piece through the decades and here he presents the final composition - and as a companion piece a second experimental work inspired by underwater experiences near the Isles of Scilly.\n\nExperimental progressive soundscapes only for the adventurous listener.”\n\n“Activity are an avant four-piece featuring Travis Johnson, and drummer Steve Levine, both from the band Grooms, bassist Zoë Browne from Field Mouse, and guitarist Jess Rees from Russian Baths. Produced by engineer Jeff Berner of Psychic TV, their debut forms a casually menacing framework for lyrical themes of paranoia, exposed character flaws, and the broader human capacity for growth when an ugly truth is laid bare.\n\nLead single “Calls Your Name,” establishes the record’s spectral aura with...\n\nThis is a collection of most of the 1984 album “Glass Tube”, which was After Dinner’s first album + some other stuff, plus 30’ of live material by this Japanese new music rock band, who predated the current huge interest in all things \"Japan\".\n\nCharacterized by leader Haco's vocals, this is subtly detailed, almost pastel, progressive Japanese music; they don’t sound like ANYBODY else!\n\n“Can't say I've heard anything quite like this. Truly awesome in its presentation, it's hard not to want to...\n\n“Experimental by name, the band was definitely experimental by nature. The concept started with Corinne Micaelli, the director of the French Institute in Haiti. She wanted to bring drummer Tony Allen, the power behind Afrobeat and one of modern music's towering figures, to the island. A performance with Haitian musicians at a major public concert would be perfect. Allen agreed, and Erol Josué, a singer, dancer, voodoo priest, and director of the Haitian National Bureau of Ethnology, helped to recruit...\n\n“New offering from New York city’s master of Isolationist Ambient. A continuation of the previously explored realm of the spirit world through \"Lucid Intrusion\" (Cyclic Law 2018), we’re now being depicted a unique journey of an Outer Body Experience.\n\nAs the spirit leaves the physical body and is propelled to a parallel universe, it encounters unknown phenomenas and travels obscure and unrecognisable landscapes. An otherworldly journey through an infinite realm, a subconscious terra incognita...\n\nAlbare – guitar, synth guitar\n\nPhil Tucio – piano\n\nYunior Terry – bass\n\nPablo Bencid – drums\n\n“Australia continues to grow in every area of the arts and among those in the upper echelon of artists is Albare aka Albert Dadon. A man from many influences - born in Morocco, raised in France and Israel, Albare emigrated to Australia when he was 27 years old and since his arrival he has grown in public image and in reputation as one of their finest jazz guitarists and composers. There is...\n\nYou can not over-fill a thimble with what I know about reggae, but this splendid little unassuming release is very reminsicent of the great late 70s/early 80s dub work by Adrian Sherwood. If you know and like those Creation Rebel / African Headcharge / etc releases and are looking for more like it, here you go!\n\nThis is a high-quality pirate edition of two never-reissued, very obscure Krautrock rarities, with ties to Can.\n\n\"His first two LPs from 1974 and 1976 on one CD, complete and with all original jacket artwork and lyrics. Now performs as Alex...\n\n“Playbax Method\n\nstage one:\n\ncertain rhythm tracks copied from mastertape of new york gong lp are cut into various multiples of bar lengths and spliced into loops which are then replayed onto playbax master into organised sequences/loop contructs:\n\nstage two:\n\nconstruct suggest fresh themes and treatments”\n\nOne of Daevid's better 1980's albums (this) was designed with a rich skien of background tapes over which he played live guitar.\n\nI saw the tour he did based around the...\n\nThis is both of two albums that joined Daevid with multi-instrumentalist Kramer.\n\nI saw one of their shows and they worked really great together. Kramer put a little bit of edge into Daevid's whimsy, but it was also really clear that both musicians really liked each others' work, despite the apparent differences in style and approach.\n\nBoth of these collaborations are some of the best of Daevid's 90s work, I think.\n\nThe classic, amazing 3rd album by the Allman’s that (a) made them and (b) set the template for jam bands for the next 45 years.\n\n“Whereas most great live rock albums are about energy, At Fillmore East is like a great live jazz session, where the pleasure comes from the musicians' interaction and playing. The great thing about that is, the original album that brought the Allmans so much acclaim is as notable for its clever studio editing as it is for its performances. Producer Tom Dowd skillfully...\n\nStill a fine album, but the band was reeling from the blow of Duane Allman’s death so soon after the success of Live At The Fillmore East....\n\n“A tribute to the dearly departed Duane, Eat a Peach rambles through two albums, running through a side of new songs, recorded post-Duane, spending a full album on live cuts from the Fillmore East sessions, then offering a round of studio tracks Duane completed before his death. On the first side, they do suggest the mellowness of the Dickey Betts-led...\n\n“The Allman Brothers' music was - and still is - arguably the crossroads where the blues, jazz and gospel go out drinking for the night with raw rock'n'roll. That is perhaps why promoter and impresario Bill Graham fell in love with their sound, giving them more nights at his Fillmore clubs on both coasts than most any other band of the times and choosing them to close out the final nights of the venue in 1971. What followed has since become legendary and is the finest example of 'jamming' this side of...\n\n\"This is the second proper full-length album by Swedish super-group The Amazing. The Amazing fell far from the tree. A natural process: coming together through affection, then slowly crystallizing into a folk-rock-psych-pop-collective slowly pushing, bending, then playing with any preconceived notions of pop. When a band takes a name like The Amazing, they'd better have the chops to back it up. Happily, this Swedish outfit -- a collective headed by Reine Fiske and Johan Holmegard of neo-psych juggernauts...\n\n\"File under \"Yes.\" When this version of the band couldn't obtain rights to the name, they put their album out under their combined names, but it's still Yes by any other name. Jon Anderson's tenor wails through spacy lyrics, Rick Wakeman constructs cathedrals of synthesized sound, Steve Howe rips high-pitched guitar leads, and Bill Bruford makes his drums sound like timpani...\"-AllMusic\n\n\"Another extraordinary release by Sardinian virtuoso Paolo Angeli, this time featuring compositions by Fred Frith and Bjork – all played solo in real time (though when you hear it, it’s hard to believe it) on his highly customised and extended, electrified, giant Sardinian folk guitar. A tour de force of technique and at the same time highly musical; and there is so much going on here at any given time that it is difficult to relate what your ears tell you to just one Frankenstein instrument. Dense...\n\n\"This disc will play in stereo on a CD player and with film and 5.1 surround sound (or stereo) on a DVD player or computer. The music, as always, is prodigious, sounding like a small band, but played by one person in real time (as the film attests). In this format, you can also see the instrument close-to - a highly rebuilt and extended giant Sardinian guitar - with many sympathetic and extra strings, motor driven hurdy gurdy wheels, whirling strings, springs and other appendages, played, like a cello...\n\n“A calming, atmospheric, original, refreshing psychedelic experience that you'll never EVER forget.”\n\n“Interesting, a change from the norm. Billy James is Ant-Bee. This is his third album and is about 50 minutes. The sound quality is very good, especially for an CD from 1997.\n\nThis album contains appearances by Daevid Allen from Gong, Jim Sherwoood, Bunk Gardner, Don Preston and Roy Estrada from the Mothers of Invention and a couple of members from the Alice Cooper band (when Alice Cooper was...\n\nThis is one of the most vividly surreal albums I've ever listened to and I ain't complaining about that one damn bit.\n\n“Ant-Bee indeed is left in obscurity, his recorded work are reflective of the psychedelic era of the 1960's. Primarily Ant-Bee's début, 'Pure Electric Honey' is mainly a psychedelic pop album in substance, which makes it easier to listen to, due to the sounds and melodies, that are excellently performed and palatable to anyone. Though after the first song (excluding Intro)...\n\nClarinetist Yasko's legend is now spreading beyond the bounds of his native land where he is renowned as one of the leading musicians of the Gypsy tradition, the core of much of the music of the Balkans. Hot Blood is a collection of traditional tunes g...\n\n“Ariel Pink followed Pom Pom -- a wild album even by his standards -- with a set of songs inspired by an artist who defined outsider status.\n\nFor a few years in the '60s, Bobby Jameson was a fixture of L.A.'s psych-rock scene before dropping out due to mental health and substance issues, then reemerged in the late 2000s to share his thoughts on life and the music industry on his blog and YouTube channel until his death in 2015. He proves to be a potent muse for Pink on Dedicated to Bobby Jameson, an...\n\nDagmar Krause-vocals\n\nChris Cutler-drums, electronics\n\nFred Frith-guitars, keyboards, violin, etc.\n\nThis was the 3rd and final album by the successor band to Henry Cow. I'm not really sure why (short playing length? the press had gone onto other things to champion? it wasn't released stateside, unlike the first two?) but this one slipped under the radar of a lot of folks, compared to their 1st two.\n\nIt's a very bleak, but also a very solid work. It’s probably my favorite of their albums\n\nThe Artchipel Orchestra, led by conductor / arranger Ferdinando Farao, is a Italian big band (over 20 participants) and Ferdinando is a big fan of the British jazz and jazz rock scene of the 70s, having previously covered tunes by Alan Gowen, Dave Stewart, Mike Westbrook & Fred Frith, among others.\n\nHere, he's tackling the Soft Machine book, but even though the title is \"Play Soft Machine\", a more accurate title would be \"Plays Hugh Hopper's Tunes For Soft Machine\", as that's what this mostly is....\n\nThis album, recorded in Berlin, and originally released in 1977 on Virgin, marks the first time Manuel Gottsching used the name Ashra (as opposed to Ash Ra Tempel). This was also possibly the first time that the term \"new age\" was used on a record!\n\nIt's another completely wonderful, flowing, spacey album, featuring just Manuel performing on sequencer, keyboards and a lot of guitar. He did one more great one after this, Blackouts, then took some time off and returned to utter greatness and glory with..\n\nThis is their first recordings, originally released on cassette and ONLY sold at gigs in 1988/1989 + two previously unreleased tracks from the same era.\n\nVery early ambient dub rave, and probably their furthest out / spaciest stuff. At its most ‘clubby’ it sounds like Chrome Hoof taking itself seriously ,and at its most out, it sounds like a cross between Rainbow Dome Music and Ashra.\n\n“The mysterious ambient-dub and tribal house unit known as Astralasia fits in with other British electro...\n\n“A heavy, oft-sampled slab of Bay Area history, and a psych funk masterpiece that cannot be denied. Aura formed in 1974 and played extensively throughout Northern California. By 1976, the band recorded their first and only album at Pacific Recording Studio in San Mateo.\n\nThe original title of the album was meant to be “Sativa”, but out of fear that promoting the joys of marijuana would be too controversial, the band omitted the title and just left it as “Aura”. Over the ensuing decades, the Aura...\n\nDerek Bailey - acoustic and electric guitars\n\nGeorge Lewis – trombone\n\nJohn Zorn - alto and soprano saxes, clarinets, and game calls\n\n“Subtle, droll, hilarious takes on the trivia of baseball sounds: Lewis speaks through the trombone \"ball one, ball one....\" There are snippets of a slipping and sliding version of \"Take Me out to the Ball Game\" and so on.\n\nSections are titled \"City City City,\" \"The Legend of Enos Slaughter,\" \"Who's on First,\" followed by \"On Golden Pond,\" a tongue-in...\n\n\"In November 1971, drummer Ginger Baker decided to set up a recording studio in Lagos, then the capital of Nigeria. He also decided that it would be a rewarding musical experience to travel Nigeria over land across the Sahara Desert - a journey that would lead him into a number of adventures. This film by Tony Palmer follows Baker's odyssey as he makes his journey and finally arrives in Nigeria to set up his studio, which wuold run successfully through the 70s as a facility for both local and Western...\n\nWhy does “RoxxVoxx” think that “Ginger Baker / Graham Bond” is more sellable than what this really is, which is Ginger Baker’s Airforce”? Damned if I know.\n\n“Ginger Baker and Graham Bond, live from Bremn, Germany on October 24th, 1970.

Originally a drummer and percussionist, he has expanded his instruments to include various acoustic and electronic sound generators, mostly with keys. He records his albums (three to date) single-handedly, cobbling together a multitude of sounds and noises and using modern studio technology to transform the whole thing into complex, electro-acoustic sound creations. Every now and then he gets a little help...\n\nNew, digi-pack issue made from the tapes, of this well known group's debut album that isn't the one they are famous for, but is still a good one, for what it is.\n\n\"That is a plain warning for everyone out there that this 1970 debut by...\n\n\"This classic album was first released in June 1983 by Charisma Records and four months prior to the release of the album \"Genesis\" and began life as a series of home demos and was completed at Genesis' The Farm studio.\n\n\"The Fugitive\" featured contributions from Daryl Stuermer on guitars, Mo Foster on bass and drummers Steve Gadd, Tony Beard and Andy Duncan and for the first time Tony Banks sang lead vocals on all of the songs.\n\n\"The Fugitive\" spawned the singles 'This is Love' and ...\n\nDenys Baptiste : tenor sax\n\nAndrew McCormack : piano\n\nGary Crosby : bass\n\nRod Youngs : drums\n\n“Although he never really went away, Denys Baptiste is back again with his first album since Let Freedom Ring released seven years ago.

He left the band in mid 1968, a casualty of business pressure and drugs. This was his second and final solo album, which came out in 1970.
