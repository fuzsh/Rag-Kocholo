        "text": "2024 limited restock. In 1972, left-wing intellectual film critic Uwe Nettelbeck suggested to Anthony Moore that he might write some straight songs (relatively speaking), which in turn prompted Moore to invite his old school friend Peter Blegvad over to Hamburg to form the band Slapp Happy. Dagmar Krause, a young singer from Hamburg and Moore's girlfriend, joined them both on their trip to Wümme to record what was to become this album, Sort Of, using Faust as their rhythm section. In honor of this album ́s 50th anniversary the album will get a nicely remastered reissue with the newly founded Week-End Records -- the festival's inhouse label who managed to get the band together for a final reunion shows in November of 2016 and Spring of 2017.\n\n2005 repressing of this art-rock classic now available. Slapp Happy were a trio of Peter Blegvad (guitar, vocals), Dagmar Krause (voice), and Anthony Moore (keyboards, guitar). \"Slapp Happy met in Germany in the early seventies, where they recorded their first album Sort Of for Polydor ('Years ahead of its time'-- NME). Acnalbasac Noom was their second LP, recorded in 1973, and engineered by Kurt Grauner, in Faust's legendary Wumme studio. Like the first it was produced by Faust's Svengali Uwe Nettelbeck, using Faust as the Slapphappy house band. Unaccountably it was rejected by Virgin Records, who made the group re-record all the material with different musicians and another producer in their own studio. That version is still available through Virgin as 'Casablanca Moon' -- they straightened up the name too. As time has told, it is now universally accepted that Acnalbasac is the definitive version of this material. This rather overdue reissue, taking advantage of significant technological advances, has been completely re-mastered by Bob Drake from the original tapes. The CD also features a handful of extra tracks, including the single 'Everybody's Slimming' released to coincide with a one off concert at the ICA in the '80's.\" Bonus tracks: \"Everybody's Slimming,\" \"Blue Eyed William,\" \"Karen,\" and \"Message.\""
