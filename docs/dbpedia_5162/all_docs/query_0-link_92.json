Gallagher -\n\nthis is a rare disc indeed.\n\nAll best\n\nfrankwm\n\nPost by EM\n\nThanks, but I keep getting \"Sorry, the free service is at full\n\ncapacity\" from sendspace.com.\n\nEM\n\n*************\n\nJust about to GTB..\n\nUploads are taking place - but if /*/anyone/*/ who already has them\n\nwould copy them to mediafire/etc (which, using DU I can't manage -\n\nincredibly slow-speeds - that's why I use Sendspace..) then give me\n\nthe titles/links & I'll either add them to the blog - or put them on\n\nthe googlegroups site with a link to the blog - my email is accesible\n\nfrom google rmcr.\n\nAfter a gap I'll do an upload of the remainder (or most of..)...&\n\nthank God not all the stuff is 'rowdy'!\n\nAny more 'old' Eisler - or similar..?? - then why not join my 'dead'\n\ngooglegroup http://groups.google.com/group/themusicparlour and add\n\nfile-details to the existing thread..\n\nNot really looking for it to be a 'conversation' site - but I'll put a\n\n'permanent' blog-link to there if anyone is interested..."
