I mean, c'mon, how much worse can it get? My heart was breaking for this guy! And there's his saintly wife, sticking with him in all his pathetic-ness, even having his kid. Now that's love. There, I feel better for having confessed. I'm on the road to recovery... \"Hi, my name is Amy, and I mishear lyrics\" \"Hi, Amy!\" [warm applause]\n\n------------------------------ Date: Thu, 14 Sep 2000 13:27:33 +0100 From: Adrian Ransome <Adrian.Ransome@tsi-ltd.co.uk> Subject: Ha! Take that, Virgin! Message-ID: <497FEA72C392D3118AE700508B7311776C6B43@NT4SERVER03> >From NME.com.. >>SMASHING PUMPKINS released a new album - 'MACHINA II/THE FRIENDS & ENEMIES OF MODERN MUSIC' - last week, and are encouraging fans to bootleg the limited edition 25-track record and spread it around the globe in MP3 format. The record is made up of tracks recorded during the sessions for their last album proper 'MACHINA/The Machines Of God' over the last couple of years. However, upset by what they perceived to be a lack of support from label bosses at Virgin, the band decided to give away the album rather than allow the label to profit in any way from the release. Twenty-five copies were pressed on a double LP with three 10\" EPs on hand-cut, hand-numbered, non-lacquered vinyl. These were sent to friends and established Smashing Pumpkins fan websites. The recipients were encouraged to distribute the tracks onto the net as quickly as possible as the band intend to play some of the songs during the European leg of their 'Sacred and Profane' tour, kicking off in Berlin on September 16.<< Good to see Virgin on the receiving end of sharp practice for a change.

Hi: Rory \"credit where credit's due\" Wilsher came up with some very funny consumer warnings for Skylarking, and in the process prompted me to pop the CD into the player, which I hadn't done for a while. I'd just like to say that \"The Meeting Place\" is one of Colin's best songs, even if it does deal with sexual exploitation. And, after ably defending \"Great Fire,\" Annamarie pleaded: > Please convince me about Human Alchemy ... which scares the !@#$ out of me! Just as it's supposed to, dearie! Talking about the song order on the Mummer CD, Smudgeboy said: > Cue the fade out of Funk Pop-a-Roll, with Andy yelling \"Bye bye\" > (or even \"Buy buy\"). \"A-ha,\" you think, \"the end.\" Errrr, hang on, > here comes another track . . . and another . . . oop, and another! No problem! As long as the pause between \"Funk Pop a Roll\" and the beginning of the b-sides is long enough. And actually, I think it would be, um, cool to hear Frost Circus after the very heated diatribe of FPaR.

I LOVE DAGMAR KRAUSE ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Don't stop at Slapp Happy (They are wonderful, by the way). Find a copy of Supply & Demand, her mid '80's cd of Brecht/ Weill/Eisler songs. It's sadly out of print, and it's so good! And Richard Thompson plays on it, I know there's fans of his on this list. Produced by Joe Boyd, who also produced the ever-popular Nick Drake, and the much less appreciated (on this list anyways) REM. Also Highly recommended are all three lp's (on 2 cd's) by the Art Bears. Dagmar Krause, Fred Frith and Chris Cutler get artsy! By no means easy or accesable, but rewarding. Oh, I guess I didn't make the connection for those who don't know-Dagmar Krause was Slapp Happy's singer.

Where can a fella' find a poster of Donald Brun's painting that adorns the body of some band called xtc's Upsy Daisy Ass? In between selling crack and mugging old hunchbacked Catholic women, I think this garbage up. But I would like to find a copy (of the poster) and actually at some point, frame it, and put it under the mirror on my ceiling. While I'm on the subject of this band called ekstuhsee, or whatever, I noticed that they recently put out an album called Wassup, Star? or something like that. Is it any good? I understand there's a bit of cheating on it. Golly. Is this where xtc becomes a rap band?

And I'm relieved to learn that at least one of you, David Smith (6-267), at least halfway agrees with me. Listen up, you youngsters on the list. Back before the glacier retreated, when you actually had to stand up and take a couple of steps if you wanted to change the TV channel, there were things called LPs: vinyl discs carved on each side with one enormously long spiral groove that, depending on how it was cut, would make a diamond needle vibrate in such a way that Yma Sumac or Mojo Nixon or XTC would come out of your loudspeakers. Your parents have hundreds of these vinyl platters, hidden in the back of the closet so you won't discover embarrassing things like the hearts and flowers Mommy drew all over the inner sleeve while listening to It's A Beautiful Day, or the pictures of Mommy Daddy drew all over the inner sleeve while listening to Foghat. Anyway, the music stopped when the LP reached the end of Side 1, and you had to flip the disc over in order to hear Side 2 (or Side Ye, in the case of a particular Cheech & Chong album). Consequently, there was a moment of silence between the two sides. The musicians knew this, so with rare exceptions (*Thick as a Brick* comes to mind), there was little if any emotional or thematic carry-over from Side 1 to Side 2. The vinyl album was a two-movement symphony with an intermission. What about changers, you ask? If you were listening to a two-disc album, didn't the automatic turntable practically eliminate the delay between Sides 1 & 2 and Sides 3 & 4? Aha! I'm glad you ask. The answer is, not always. In fact, some of the coolest twin-disc vinyl albums of all time are purposefully designed NOT to be played on changers. The White Album, *Goodbye Yellow Brick Road*, and *English Settlement* all have Sides 1 & 2 on one disc, with Sides 3 & 4 sharing the other. I say, Virgin was right (about this if nothing else) to put the extra trackery in the middle of the CD releases of *Black Sea* and *Mummer*. Let it be a rock and roll Apocrypha separating the Old Testament from the New. Look at *Black Sea*. Where are you going to place the three bonus cuts? Before \"Respectable Street\"? You must be insane. After the piss-in-the-shower finale of \"Travels In Nihilon\"? You must be mad. Right before \"Towers of London,\" so the clanks will rouse you after \"The Somnambulist\" nods you off? Now you're talking.

In fact ,ALL radio sucks. I just cant stand it anymore. <insert annoying Family Feud-style buzzer noise> There's a community station here in Canberra that plays a shitload of XTC after midnight on Fridays. The only two problems with it are: (a) Very few people are awake regularly after midnight on Friday, and those who are are usually out partying rather than staying at home to listen to community radio; and (b) Being a community station (as opposed to a \"commercial\" station), the signal tends to die out about eight kilometres from the studio. Aside from playing lots of XTC, it's the only radio station I've ever heard play Be Bop Deluxe, The Church, The Go-Betweens and Peter Gabriel in anything even approaching high rotation. Why? Because after midnight on Fridays, I'm in charge of the playlist for five cathartic hours! Bwaahahahahahahaha!!! It ain't much, but I do what I can.......five hours probably doesn't entail \"high rotation\", does it?

To whit: > \"A few other songs whose questionable ethics have gone unexposed for far too long\" (attributed to Ed K. c I get in so much trouble these days for not quoting my sources (c.f. SHUT YOUR WRETCHED PIE TRAP etc. I think this was also one of Ed's that I didn't attribute previously. Wasn't trying to claim it as my own, I just think this is one of the best \"flames\" ever, and should be adopted by Hillians the world over so that we may recognise and abuse each other in a common language. (* big smiley faces *:-) ;-) ;-P. BTW, I still want this t-shirt!))) Well, I did do the \"over-literal analysis\" thing a while back (& am flattered that you've continued on with it), but I'm pretty sure that \"shut your wretched pie trap\" is not only not mine, but actually predates my posting debut. I also would love a t-shirt (it could be THE \"Chalker aggro\" garment) but would never think of trying to take credit for it, thus my disclaimer here (I obviously don't want the real \"Mr. Pie Trap\" mad at me, whoever they are - does anyone remember, or care to identify yourself if that's you?). And in 6-266, Chris Coolidge corrected what I said about the \"Shitty\" Mick Jones: That voice is actually lead singer Lou Gramm, Mick's own voice is kind of limited, and did mostly backup vocals with Foreigner. Eep. I'm embarassed. Not as embarassed as I would be if I'd made a similar error concerning a band that didn't suck (unlike Foreigner), but embarased nonetheless. Still, he participated in the making of those crappy songs, so he can remain \"Shitty Mick Jones\" as opposed to the Clash's \"Good Mick Jones\". Plus I can now dislike the vocals by the correct name, so thanks. Actually, this Foreigner thing has reminded me of something; one of my most all-time detested sounds is the \"80s sax part\", of which there is a perfect example on \"Urgent\". Other examples by various other artists include \"the Heat is On\", \"Harden My Heart\" and \"Careless Whispers\". I had a wonderful time in the 80s, and there was some great music, but that sax sound seemed omnipresent in a lot of mainstream pop of that time, and it was something I detested then and continue to detest to this day. In fact, one of the few sax parts from that decade that I can tolerate is the one from \"It's Nearly Africa\", which a lot of people would barely even consider \"proper\" sax playing. And you have no idea how grateful I am that \"This World Over\" doesn't go into a sax solo; there's a moment there when it seems to threaten to do so, then, much to my relief, it doesn't happen. The presence of 80s sax is also one of the factors that makes \"Groovy Decay/Decoy\" Robyn Hitchcock's weakest album. Apologies to any sax players out there: I don't hate the instrument itself, and there's quite a lot of jazz where I enjoy it, it's just a certain pop sax sound that had its heyday in the 80s that I can't stand.

I can post a long and pointless message to Chalkhills to while away the time! But first, a big thank you to my fan club. You know who you are. All three of you. Also, apologies to Wes, the original creator of SYWPTYRP! (My God, even the flames are being abbreviated now! I look forward to my first post comprised entirely of abbreviations. IMHO, HITS, AFI...) Well, no-one's told me to stop, so here goes: my take on Wasp Star c those dodgy lyrics again... Playground: \"This boy must try harder to please, from down on his knees\". Now, I understood that this practice was illegal, and only confined to the best (or most expensive) public schools these days. (US Hillians note: public school (UK) = private school (US). Go figure.) Dodginess rating (\"DR\"): ***** (the highest) Stupidly Happy: Aaah, too many, too many! Right... \"heart pumping wine\": First off, change your medical specialist. Wine does NOT contain haemoglobin, so you will die shortly from oxygen deprivation. Also: do NOT attempt to drive, or operate heavy machinery. The Surgeon General advises that having wine instead of blood may cause drowsiness. Second up: \"My vision is skewed\": can't help thinking this is caused by the blood/wine thing. Thirdly, \"This world's making sense\": Hmmm. You're new to Earth, aren't you? Fourthly: \"coming unscrewed\": this onanistic line has already been debated when WS first came out, (Huh? Didn't even know it was gay!) but deserves iteration here. And finally, about tearing the Devil's business card up: Yeah, mate, we're right behind you! A VERY LONG WAY behind you! This goes way beyond stupid. DR: *** In Another Life: regarding Chippendales and biggest pouches: Duh! No sexism HERE! Now, about those horoscope strangers...yeah! Great idea! Just go and talk to them, it's OK, we'll count the body parts later... DR: **** My Brown Guitar: Well, we all know this has nothing to do with anything brown or guitar-shaped. Pink skies? Sadly, caused by Supergirl's uncontrollable urges to change all the world's weather. Yuh live, yuh learn... DR: ** Boarded Up: Yes, we're boarded up. That's US screaming from INSIDE! DID ANYONE BOTHER TO CHECK?!?!? DR: *** ITMWML: Obviously, murder is illegal in most countries, so, depending on where you live, what we think to that will probably involve lifelong incarceration or a quick visit to \"Ol' Sparky\". DR: ***** We're All Light: \"Yeah I read that someplace/So you won't mind if I kiss you now\" *sigh!* If ONLY this worked in real life! Seriously, though: I feel strongly that the Government should produce a public safety film to warn dinosaurs about the dangers of dropping pails c they could injure their feet badly. This may not seem much to you, but small incidents like these can lead to a reduction in the birth rate, leading to depopulation of the species, males being unable to find females, and eventually extinction. WAIT A MINUTE! Is this what REALLY happened??? DR: ** Standing In For Joe: This is a song about, at worst, adultery; or a guy sleeping with his best friend's girlfriend, at best. But the lyrics are perfect. DR * (lyrics) *** (theme) Wounded Horse: This is a song about...(see above). However, a certain level of dodginess has crept in here. Anyone who follows the university boat race will immediately spot the flaw in the line \"you won't sink if you paddle\". Also, I'm not familiar with the concept of injured ungulates self-inflicted lingual maiming. Is there any documentary evidence to support this claim? DR: ** YATCWSBB: Horses, horses...what's Andy got against horses, for God's sake? For a man so anti-car, he's wounded one in the last song, then got it to bite out its own tongue. Now he wants to DROWN one! Ease up, fella! DR: ** Church Of Women: A word of advice on your building material: All it will take is one warm day (not v. likely this English summer!) and you'll find that it's less than perfect. DR: ** TWATM: \"I've got the plough if you've got the furrow\": yeah right, Andy c would that be your \"brown guitar\" that you're using as a plough? Ditto your \"pen\", \"seed\", and \"big stick\". All fairly obvious stuff so far. Maypole? That's just boasting. If you find that everything decays, try Viagra. DR: ***** Rory \"I may be a one-trick dog c but DAMN! It's a good trick!\" Wilsher p.s.

Message-ID: <5c.9a12fb.26f2c12b@aol.com> Oh most glorious Tyler, I fear you are misled....as you say, << IMHO, Family Guy is a vastly inferior, unfunny ripoff of the Simpsons. No way in hell is it nearly as subversive or daring as the Simpsons, and the writing isn't nearly as tight. See my last post (about the Upright Citizen's Brigade). Family Guy is a step closer to the gross-out humor I mentioned there, and pales in comparison to the Simpsons. >> OK, I agree, NOTHING is as good as the Simpsons. However being an unnecessarily big fan of both shows, I must disagree with thy opinion of inferiority. Family Guy is one of the funniest shows I've seen, because of the fact that it can be so terrible and still manage to be on the air. More daring than the Simpsons, yes, but only in the sense that they go further with the naughty bits. The SImpsons is a vastly more intelligent and witty show, while Family Guy gets all that nasty humor out of one's system. I like em both. XTC content.....I like AV1 better than Wasp Star.

Both bands are (now) duos and more or less studio-bound (I know Dan has been back on the live circuit recently, but that does not count as they sound live exactly the same as they do on disc). And as for Colin claiming NOT having heard Barrytown, it is hard to believe if you consider that, after all, he was in the same group with one Barry for several years. Within pop music, Barrys and Barrytown have gone together ever since the release of Pretzel Logic. Even Nick Hornby could not resist joking about it in High Fidelity.\n\n------------------------------ Date: Fri, 15 Sep 2000 18:05:29 GMT From: \"Ralph Simpson DeMarco\" <sawpit@hotmail.com> Subject: Sad Songs Say So Much Message-ID: <LAW-F258XCybNVg8c97000028e9@hotmail.com> Dear Affiliated Members: OK Old thread: Sad Songs...say so much: Elton John (just kidding!)

Coolidges said: \"Oh G_d. I forgot about him. All those above are definitely weepers, but he topped himself on his most recent, Bad Love, with \"I Miss You,\" an incredibly poignant one in which he actually writes about himself, which he rarely does, it's apparently about his ex-wife \"up there in Idaho\" which is where she moved with his kids after they split up. In the late 80's he couldn't resist being savage and angry like any typical angry divorced dad(\"I Want You To Hurt Like I Do\"), but this time he's sad and contrite and fully realises there's nothing he can do to bring her back, but he can't help but be brutally honest.(\"I miss you/I'm sorry, but I do.\")\" Add me to the list that loves Randy Newman and Bad Love in particular. The first song that struck me as being very very sad on that album is Everytime It Rains. It made me wonder -- why hasn't this theme of rain been used more in pop music? There's 1000 Umbrellas of course, but even then the idea of rain is used a bit differently. This song had a special meaning to me for a while, partly because I live here in Seattle, but my whole perception of the song was changed a bit when I found out it was written for Michael Jackson! Randy's song That'll Do from Babe Pig In the City also makes me blubber.

Madonna? Give me a break. (It's probably a cover anyway - does she really write any of her material, girl?) Randy Newman is oh, so close, with Tom Waits making a good third showing, but the clear winner is Richard Thompson, the man who described his typical song as \"Boy meets girl, blood everywhere.\" His _happy_ songs are disturbing; his sad ones make you wonder why we all don't just pack it in. There are many notable entries, but the all time winner for me is \"Behind Grey Walls,\" which is about a man who has to have his wife committed. It's the only song I know of that I cannot listen to. It absolutely scares the bejeezus out of me.
