*2024 reissue* Brilliant second album by Art Bears, a band/project featuring Fred Frith, Chris Cutler and Dagmar Krause, formed in 1978 after disputes over the musical direction within Henry Cow. 'Winter Songs', originally released in 1979, placed Art Bears in the forefront of the Rock In Opposition Movement. Art Bears' intense and brutal avant-garde approach on the album comes across as primordial expression, which is nailed down by Krause's violently charismatic voice. As a piece of music revealing unrivalled originality and creativity, 'Winter Songs' is even more relevant today than it was at the time of its original release.

Gold embossed jacket as original, with leaflet. Paper jacket, SHM-CD, remastered in 2015, 2 bonus tracks. Long-awaited encore pressing of this long-unavailable work!
