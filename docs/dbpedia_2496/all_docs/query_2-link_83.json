        "text": "Sentimentality, romance, and love have long been wheelhouse subjects for popular music, so it's no surprise pop is also littered with breakup songs. Robyn has written four classics to date: \"Be Mine!\", \"With Every Heartbeat\", \"Dancing on My Own\", and now \"Call Your Girlfriend\". On the first three, she's the wronged woman, and in many ways these tracks represent her most enduring guise: The tough woman with a brave face and a stiff upper lip whose heart is being shattered. Even when she's being stepped on, spat out, or sidelined, she's handled it with dignity and restraint: Whatshername might be tying your shoes, but she hopes you're happy.\n\nOn \"Call Your Girlfriend\", Robyn is whatshername-- she's the new friend. And she's as graceful about this role as when she plays the other points in the love triangle. The best of the five new songs on Robyn's 2010 victory lap album/compilation Body Talk, \"Call Your Girlfriend\" is deceptively simple, a buzzing rhythm, a few of banks of synths, a killer chord change, and Robyn sagely dishing out breakup advice to her new boyfriend. The uncommon combination of strength and grace Robyn displays makes her breakups feel like pep talks, or love letters, or how-tos. \"Girlfriend\" is one of the most adult, thoughtful pop music breakups since the Field Mice's \"Willow\", but naturally without the twee-pop OGs' sense of melancholy. Hell, unlike \"Willow\", or most breakup tracks, nothing is truly ending on \"Call Your Girlfriend\", it's only changing, and with Robyn as the observer/actor gently guiding each party into a hopeful tomorrow."
