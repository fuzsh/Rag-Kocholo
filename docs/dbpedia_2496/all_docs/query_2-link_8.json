It was the lead single from her third album, The Best Damn Thing (2007). It was produced by Lukasz \"Dr. Luke\" Gottwald. \"Girlfriend\" became Lavigne's biggest hit in the United States, where it reached number one on the U.S. Hot 100, in Australia, where it was at the top of the chart, and in the United Kingdom, where it reached number two. A remix version featuring rapper Lil' Mama was released in June 2007.\n\n\"Girlfriend\" was the subject of a lawsuit filed by songwriters for The Rubinoos, who alleged that the writers of the song copied The Rubinoos' single \"I Wanna Be Your Boyfriend\". Only one line, not even of the same tune was: \"Hey, hey, you, you! I want to be your girlfriend!\" Note it was \"I want to\" not \"I wanna\"."
