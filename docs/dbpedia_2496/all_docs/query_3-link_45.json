        "text": "She really kills me, yeah she′s my friend\n\nShe's my Tuesday high, my girlfriend\n\nShe′s so cute, so pretty, funny girl\n\nShe's always into something, hey girlfriend!\n\nShe has a pink bicycle\n\nShe rides everyday, yeah\n\nShe likes eating ice cream\n\nWhile blowing bubbles with her chewing gum\n\nAnd always wears different colored socks\n\nShe does it to me, yeah she's so nice\n\nShe only drinks tequila, Tuesday high\n\nShe′s got cute, short hair such a pearl\n\nShe′s always doing something, funky girl\n\nOne day while walking in the park\n\nI heard someone panting\n\nAnd there she was dancing\n\nI laughed and cried out, \"Oh what a dancer\"\n\nShe said, \"If my legs were longer\"\n\n\"I'd be a super model don′t you know?\"\n\n\"So take my picture now, please\"\n\nThe flowers in the park were dancing in the wind\n\nAs the sun glowed, yeah, yeah\n\nAnd I took pictures as she spun around\n\nStopping to strike a fancy pose, yeah, yeah\n\nIt's never boring with my honey girl\n\nShe′s such a bright and dizzy, funny girl\n\nShe's always dancing all alone in her funky world\n\nShe′s got a black belt, what a funky girl, come on\n\nShe's AB RH minus yeah\n\nYou might call her strange, but she's my friend\n\nWriter(s): 奥田俊作, 川瀬智子<br>Lyrics powered by www.musixmatch.com"
