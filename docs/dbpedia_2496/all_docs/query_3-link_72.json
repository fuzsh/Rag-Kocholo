        "text": "This week, we delve into what many contend is the blue print for 1990's power pop, the 1991 LP by Matthew Sweet, Girlfriend. Things were not looking particularly up for Sweet as he worked on his third album. Professionally he had no label, and personally his marriage was falling apart. Having released two competent, but commercial disappointing albums for 2 different labels, no one expected what came next.\n\nTentatively titled Nothing Lasts, the album was rechristened Girlfriend after actress Tuesday Weld objected to her image being used for an album called Nothing Lasts. Having used a drum machine on his previous albums, Sweet decided to go with real drums and to record most of the album live in he studio. With the help of guitar virtuosos Television's Richard Lloyd, and former Voidoid guitarist and Lou Reed sideman, Robert Quine, Girlfriend is equal parts loud and jangly. Its the perfect soundtrack for Sweet's sweet vocals and harmonies (pun intended) and an unparalleled guitar pop tour de force.\n\nRecommendation for this episode: My Favorite Revolution by Eugene Edwards.\n\n“Looking at the Sun” was originally recorded during the sessions for Sweet's second album Earth, which was released in 1989. As was th.e case with the tracks on Earth and Sweet’s debut \"Inside, the drums were programed on a drum machine. THe song was significantly reworked for its inclusion song Girlfriend."
