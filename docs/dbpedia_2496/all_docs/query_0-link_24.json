        "text": "Ariana Grande released \"Break up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" in January, but it's recently climbed higher on the charts.\n\nSo what is the song about? Here are the lyrics and their explanation in full.\n\nEver catch yourself humming the chorus to a hit song but wondering what the heck it’s about? We’re here to help.\n\nAriana Grande has dominated the pop charts for the past few years thanks to the release of 2018’s Sweetener and 2019’s Thank U, Next. And while each of her songs—from “God Is a Woman” and “No Tears Left to Cry” to “7 Rings” and “Thank U, Next”—come with a backstory, the lyrics of the third single off Thank, U Next, “Break up with Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” are particularly juicy.\n\nGrande, who kicked off her Sweetener tour in March, dropped the single in January—and it’s since gotten more and more popular, becoming her 13th top 10 song on Billboard’s Radio Songs chart in April, and as of June 22, maintaining a steady top 50 spot on the Billboard Hot 100 chart at number 37.\n\nSo what is the meaning behind the song with quite the, um, catchy title—and why are certain lyrics so key?\n\nFor that, we’ll turn to the music video, which stars Riverdale’s Charles Melton, and falls right in line with the lyrics—until the end. The song kicks off with, “You got me some type of way / Ain’t used to feelin’ this way / I do not know what to say / But I know I shouldn’t think about it.”\n\nIn the video, Grande walks into a party and immediately notices a hot guy (Melton) as she sings about how attracted she is to him—and quickly realizes he’s taken. She sings, “Then I realized she’s right there / And I’m at home like, ‘Damn, this ain’t fair.”\n\nShe then makes a declaration that clearly outlines what she wants: “Break up with your girlfriend (girlfriend) / yeah, yeah, ‘cause I’m bored / You could hit it in the morning (morning) / yeah, yeah, like it’s yours.”\n\nThroughout the video, she follows the couple while keeping a close eye on the man.\n\nAnd later, we hear a sample of N*Sync’s “Makes Me Ill” around the bridge.\n\nThe original N*Sync lyrics read:\n\nCall me a hater, if you want to\n\nBut I only hate on him ‘cause I want you\n\nSay I’m tripping if you feel like\n\nBut you without me ain’t right\n\nYou can say I’m crazy, if you want to\n\nThat’s true, I’m crazy ‘bout you\n\nYou could say I’m breaking’ down inside\n\n‘Cause I can’t see you with another guy\n\nAnd Grande’s are pretty similar:\n\nYou could say I’m hatin’ if you want to\n\nBut I only hate on her ‘cause I want you\n\nSay I’m trippin’ if you feel like\n\nBut you without me ain’t right (ain’t right)\n\nYou could call me crazy ‘cause I want you\n\nAnd I never even ever f*****’ met you\n\nSay I’m trippin’ and it ain’t right\n\nBut you without me it ain’t nice (Ain’t nice, yeah)\n\nUpon its release, fans quickly took to Twitter to speculate that the song was all about her ex Big Sean, who at the time was rumored to have broken up with Jhené Aiko. The theories were pretty substantial, but uh, things took a much different turn at the end of the video.\n\nAfter following her crush and his girlfriend throughout the club, Grande ultimately ends up hooking up with his girlfriend, who just so happens to be her doppelgänger. Fans have taken this moment to interpret that the song, really, is about self-empowerment and learning to love yourself.\n\nOriginally, Grande meant to include a song called “Remember” on Thank U, Next, but replaced it with “Break up with Your Girlfriend, I’m Bored,” saying it’s simply a “fun” song.\n\n\"I added a fun one (lol) to replace one that I decided I don’t think wanna share w the world. So we back to twelve tracks. I appreciate u understanding in advance,\" Grande tweeted. She also explained why she said goodbye to “Remember,” which is said to be extremely personal.\n\n\"Ain’t about fear or anything like that, love,\" she wrote. \"Honestly. I just want to feel stable and ok sharing, promoting, performing the songs for u which I wouldn’t. I decided to keep it private for many reasons. Thank u again for understanding n respecting this decision.\"\n\nRead the full lyrics to \"Break up with Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" below, and next time you sing to Grande’s hit single, prepare to give your friends the lowdown.\n\nYou got me some type of way (Hmm)\n\nAin't used to feelin' this way (Mmm-mmm)\n\nI do not know what to say (Yeah, yeah)\n\nBut I know I shouldn't think about it\n\nTook one f*****' look at your face (Hmm)\n\nNow I wanna know how you taste (Mmm-mmm)\n\nUsually don't give it away (Yeah, yeah)\n\nBut you know I'm out here thinkin' 'bout it\n\nThen I realize she's right there\n\nAnd I'm at home like, \"Damn, this ain't fair\"\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)\n\nYeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored\n\nYou could hit it in the mornin' (Mornin')\n\nYeah, yeah, like it's yours\n\nI know it ain't right\n\nBut I don't care (Care)\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)\n\nYeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored\n\nThis shit always happen to me (Yeah)\n\nWhy can't we just play for keeps? (Mmm-mmm)\n\nPractically on my knees (Yeah, yeah)\n\nBut I know I shouldn't think about it\n\nYou know what you're doin' to me\n\nYou're singin' my songs in the streets, yeah, yeah\n\nActin' all innocent, please\n\nWhen I know you out here thinkin' 'bout it\n\nThen you realize she's right there (Yeah)\n\nAnd you're at home like, \"Damn, she can't compare\"\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend (Girlfriend)\n\nYeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored\n\nYou could hit it in the mornin' (In the mornin')\n\nYeah, yeah, like it's yours\n\nI know it ain't right\n\nBut I don't care (I don't care, yee)\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)\n\nYeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored\n\nWith your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend\n\nWith your girlfriend\n\nWith your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend\n\nYou could say I'm hatin' if you want to\n\nBut I only hate on her 'cause I want you\n\nSay I'm trippin' if you feel like\n\nBut you without me ain't right (Ain't right)\n\nYou could call me crazy 'cause I want you\n\nAnd I never even ever f****' met you\n\nSay I'm trippin' and it ain't right\n\nBut you without me ain't nice (Ain't nice, yeah)\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)\n\nYeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored\n\nYou could hit it in the mornin' (Hit in the mornin', yeah, yeah, yeah)\n\nYeah, yeah, like it's yours\n\nI know it ain't right\n\nBut I don't care (Care, yeah)\n\nBreak up with your girlfriend (With your girlfriend)\n\nYeah, yeah, 'cause I'm bored\n\nWith your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, baby, girlfriend\n\nWith your girlfriend\n\nWith your girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend, girlfriend\n\nWith your girlfriend\n\nFor more ways to live your best life plus all things Oprah, sign up for our newsletter!\n\nJonathan Borge\n\nSenior Editor\n\nAs the Senior Editor of OprahMag.com, I'm a jack-of-all-trades, overseeing our entertainment coverage (we cover TV shows like The Politician and Big Brother, movies such as J.Lo's Hustlers and Lena Waithe's Queen and Slim), features, news items, and— as her number one fan—all of Lady Gaga's whereabouts.
