This song was my second favorite by her. My personal favorite is \"Love Makes Things Happend\" her duet with Babyface\n\nPost by Gorminako on\n\nI liked Pebbles from what I remember of her, which is basically 3 songs. This was her first. Listen to this next to Paula Abdul's \"Coldhearted\", which came out later the same year. Not only does the music sound very similar, but the message is the same: \"Girlfriend, you better dump that cold-hearted snake of a boyfriend you have, who treats you so bad\"\n\nPost by tico on\n\nGorminako said:\n\nI liked Pebbles from what I remember of her, which is basically 3 songs.

Regardless of when it came out, \"Girlfriend\" is a great song and my favorite song from Sister Perri (she's now an evangelist in Atlanta).\n\nPost by jlh527 on\n\nI don't care what anyone says, Pebbles was the ISH!!! When she was out she was the Don-Pop/Dance Diva. I liked her music. She helped establish the hitmaking team of LA Reid and Babyface!!\n\nMy other favorites by her are: \"Backyard\" feat. Salt N' Pepa, and \"Love Makes Thing Happen\".\n\nPost by prenatt1166 on\n\n\"Girlfriend\" wasn't much of a hit on my chart, peaking at #35 in April 1988. However, Pebbles scored a #1 in 1990 with \"Giving You The Benefit\" - one of my favorites songs of the early 1990's.\n\n:)\n\nPost by 620 Soul Train on\n\nGreat song, I like the limited edition 8 minute remix better. I really got tired of the song especially when it crossed over, I mean everyone was spinning this one. The question still remains why do I like \"Mercedes Boy\" (the single version) 10X more, and still do to this day, Hmm."
