        "text": "Post by RoseColoredGirl on\n\nI enjoyed \"Victoria's Secret\" and \"Cinderella Snapped,\" but I admittedly was not the biggest fan of this one. I am not usually one to say that songs are dated, because I don't believe that a song feeling like a part of a different era means they are no longer enjoyable. However, whereas \"Victoria's Secret\" and \"Cinderella Snapped\" felt like they had a modern touch to them with a hint of Avril Lavigne/Paramore-like pop-punk, this feels like it channels 2000s pop-punk a little too hard, and not in a good way. It was a bit hard to hear her voice at points because the instruments were much louder than her vocals, so who knows, maybe I'll like it better if/when the studio version is released. However, as of this moment, I can't say I'm a fan of this and hopefully she isn't planning on releasing this as the next single."
