        "meta_description": "Avril Lavigne: Girlfriend: Directed by Brendan Malloy, Emmett Malloy, The Malloys. With Avril Lavigne, Bryan McMullin, Christina Grady, Charles Moniz. The music video was directed by The Malloys and filmed at Golf N' Stuff in Norwalk, California. It features two girls: one with glasses and red hair (Lavigne), and one with a rebellious persona and black hair (also Lavigne). The video begins inside a family fun entertainment center where the red-haired girl and her boyfriend are walking together. The black-haired girl sees her and shows her an intimidating disposition, to which the former ignores. As the couple walk away, the black-haired Lavigne begins to sing the song and tries her luck on the red-haired girl's boyfriend. Featured in the video are scenes of black-haired Lavigne fighting over the man with the red-haired Lavigne and trying to outdo her repeatedly. Between the scenes we see Lavigne, now with pink-streaked blonde hair, singing with her band accompanying her at the back. The video also featured this Lavigne and her friends dancing in a restroom.",
