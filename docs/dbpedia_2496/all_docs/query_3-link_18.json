        "text": "If I Was Your Girlfriend is the second track on the second disc of Prince’s ninth album Sign O’ The Times, and, five weeks after the album’s release, If I Was Your Girlfriend was released as the album’s second single, released worldwide.\n\nIn 1993, the single edit was included as the tenth track on The Hits 2 (also included as the second disc of The Hits / The B-Sides).\n\nA live version was also included in the concert movie Sign O’ The Times.\n\nBasic tracking took place on 2 November 1986, at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California (three days after Good Love, three days before compiling the only known configuration of the Camille album).\n\nThe track was included as the seventh track on the 5 November 1986 configuration of the Camille album (credited to the pseudonym Camille), which was later aborted. The song was included as the second track on the second disc as the album developed into the triple-album Crystal Ball on the 30 November 1986 configuration, which was eventually pared down and became Sign O’ The Times."
