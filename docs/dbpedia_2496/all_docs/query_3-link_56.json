        "text": "Back in 1968, Harry Nilsson wrote and recorded a song, \"Best Friend\", which was used as the theme for a TV series, 'The Courtship of Eddie's Father' (with Bill Bixby and Brandon Cruz). At the same time, he recorded an alternate version, with different title and lyrics, called \"Girlfriend\".\n\n\"Girlfriend\" has since been released on various Nilsson comps. \"Best Friend\" however, as near as I can tell, has never been released anywhere. Given the mania for bonus tracks, not to mention pure historical interest, I can't believe this hasn't been out there (officially) somewhere... Both versions are great songs, and absolutely classic Harry.\n\nAnyone have any information about the whereabouts and status of \"Best Friend'?\n\nThanks!\n\nI think you are right. I've long wondered about \"Best Friend\", the first song of Nilsson's I ever learned from watching the show, and its total absence from the discography even today.\n\nTwo ideas:\n\n1. Was the song originally written as \"Girlfriend\" and rewritten to fit the series?\n\n2. Was \"Best Friend\" never more than a minute in length (as the TV show didn't require anything longer)?\n\nI've had that CD in my collection for years, but until I read this thread, I had no idea there was a Nilsson song on it! I guess since I never watched The Courtship of Eddie's Father, I must have just skipped that track. So I've had a rare Nilsson song in my collection all this time and didn't even know it!\n\nSo I was unable to find anything on youtube only the lyrics which are obviously different then \" My Best friend version\" I would like to hear this version. I did not know that the Girlfriend version existed.\n\nPeople let me tell about the girlfriend\n\nShe's a warm hearted woman who love me till the end\n\nPeople let me tell about the girlfriend\n\nShe's a one boy cuddle toy my up, my down, my pride and joy\n\nPeople let me tell about the girlfriend\n\nWhether you like it or not there's a lot to be learned\n\nBy the boyfriend about the girlfriend\n\nPeople let me tell about her she's so fine\n\nWell on a warm Sunday morning\n\nIt nothing could be better than a girlfriend\n\nPeople let me tell about the girlfriend\n\nShe's a warm hearted woman who love me till the end\n\nPeople let me tell about the girlfriend\n\nPeople let me tell about her she's so fine\n\nBut on a warm Sunday morning just to walk and blur your mind\n\nGirlfriend, she's a girlfriend\n\nPeople let me tell about the girlfriend\n\nShe's a warm hearted woman who love me till the en"
