        "text": "1987 single by Prince\n\n\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\"Single by Princefrom the album Sign o' the Times B-side\"Shockadelica\"ReleasedMay 6, 1987RecordedNovember 2, 1986; December 23, 1986 (intro segue)StudioSunset Sound, HollywoodGenreR&B, funkLength3:46 (7\" edit)\n\n4:54 (album/12\" version)LabelPaisley Park, Warner Bros.Songwriter(s)PrinceProducer(s)PrincePrince singles chronology\n\n\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" is a song by American singer and songwriter Prince. The song serves as the second single from his ninth studio album Sign o' the Times (1987). The single was a hit in the UK (#20) but was only a minor hit in America (#67) but a major hit on black radio in America. It was originally from the Camille album, which was to be released under the guise of Prince's alter ego named Camille.\n\nThe song is delivered from an androgynous male perspective to a woman, wherein Prince explores the possibilities of a more intimate relationship if he were his lover's platonic girlfriend. Trouser Press names the song as one of the album's highlights, noting that it \"redefines a relationship in a surprisingly mature way.\"[1] It is believed that \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" deals with the jealousy Prince felt at the close bond shared between then girlfriend/fiancée Susannah Melvoin with her twin sister Wendy.[2]\n\nMusically, the song features Prince's pitched-up, androgynous vocals over a sparse bass and drum machine pattern, punctuated by a keyboard line. The opening seconds include a sound collage that includes an orchestra tuning up, a salesman and a sample of Felix Mendelssohn's \"Wedding March\". According to engineer Susan Rogers, a rare technical error on her part led to distortion—albeit only on certain words. Yet after hearing the playback, Prince loved the effect, which is featured on the released version.\n\nThe song was released on May 6, 1987, and reached number 67 on the US Billboard Hot 100 but was more successful on the US Billboard Hot Black Singles reaching number 12. It was little more successful in the UK, reaching number 20.\n\nTrack listings\n\n[edit]\n\n7\" single\n\nA. \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" (edit) – 3:46\n\nB. \"Shockadelica\" – 3:30\n\n12\" single\n\nA. \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" – 4:54\n\nB. \"Shockadelica\" (extended version) – 6:12\n\nPersonnel\n\n[edit]\n\nCredits from Duane Tudahl and Benoît Clerc[3][4]\n\nPrince – lead and backing vocals, Fairlight CMI, Prophet VS, bass guitar, Linn LM-1, Publison IM90 Infernal Machine\n\nCharts\n\n[edit]\n\nInitial chart performance for \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" Chart (1987) Peak\n\nposition Belgium (Ultratop 50 Flanders)[5] 14 Italy (Musica e Dischi)[6] 7 Netherlands (Single Top 100)[7] 17 New Zealand (Recorded Music NZ)[8] 48 Switzerland (Schweizer Hitparade)[9] 15 UK Singles (OCC)[10] 20 US Billboard Hot 100[11] 67\n\nChart performance for \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" upon Prince's death Chart (2016) Peak\n\nposition France (SNEP)[12] 188\n\n\"Shockadelica\"\n\n[edit]\n\nThe B-side to the track was another \"Camille\" track, \"Shockadelica\". The track was actually written in response to an album of the same name by former Time member, Jesse Johnson. Prince heard Johnson's album before its release, and commented that a great album should have a great title track. Johnson disagreed, so Prince recorded the track and had it played on a Minneapolis radio station before the release of Johnson's album. The public perception would be that Johnson was copying Prince's idea, and this caused tension between Johnson and Prince.[citation needed]\n\nWhen the \"Camille\" project was scrapped in favor of Crystal Ball, \"Shockadelica\" again made the cut, but was deleted from the track list when the set was trimmed to Sign o' the Times. The track was released as a B-side, and later on The Hits/The B-Sides.\n\nOther uses\n\n[edit]\n\nCover versions\n\n[edit]\n\n\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" was covered on the TLC album, CrazySexyCool, released in 1994, and on their FanMail Tour.\n\nThe song was covered by Eels during their tours of 1997 and 1998. Their version was made commercially available on their 2008 rarities compilation Useless Trinkets: B-Sides, Soundtracks, Rarities and Unreleased 1996–2006.\n\n\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" was covered by Martin Rossiter, released in 2012 on a cover EP called The Defenestration of Prince and Others.\n\n\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" was covered by B.Slade, as \"Girlfriend\", on the 2012 album Stunt B%$@H.\n\nB-side \"Shockadelica\" was interpolated by Ween in their track \"L.M.L.Y.P.\", released in 1990 on their debut album, GodWeenSatan: The Oneness.\n\nSampling\n\n[edit]\n\nMobb Deep sampled the song on their 1996 pre-Hell on Earth song \"Young Luv\".\n\nChicano rapper Lil Rob samples \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" on his 1997 Crazy Life album.\n\nIn 2003, the Jay-Z/Beyoncé Knowles single, \"'03 Bonnie & Clyde\" (from The Blueprint²: The Gift & the Curse) used several lines of \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\", and Prince was credited as one of the writers.\n\n2Pac sampled a live performance of \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" for his song \"Thugs Get Lonely Too\"; the title is also a nod to another Prince composition called \"Gigolos Get Lonely Too,\" performed by The Time. The song was recorded in 1993 but did not see official release until 2004, when the Prince samples were removed.\n\nGeorge Clinton sampled \"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" for his song, \"Heaven\", off of his 2008 album George Clinton and His Gangsters of Love.\n\nAppearances in other media\n\n[edit]\n\n\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\" and the B-side \"Shockadelica\" both appear in Demi Moore's 1996 film, Striptease."
