        "text": "Melbourne’s Raria today launches a new musical project with the release of debut single ‘Will You Tell Your Girlfriend?’\n\nPreviously releasing music as Rachel Costanzo, Raria first broke into the music industry aged just 15 years old with the single ‘Blindside’ while the 2018 remix of her ‘Comfortable’ single has achieved over 1 million global streams. She has now launched a bold new chapter in her career, with the honest, at times confronting single ‘Will You Tell Your Girlfriend?’, a smooth mix of R&B and electro, with addictive melodies and Raria’s beautifully warm, emotive vocals that have the rare gift of drawing you right into her world with just a single note.\n\nTelling a story of being in a relationship with someone who is unavailable - “Will your friends cover for you when there’s things to hide? / I feel we got in between and crossed all of the lines” she sings - the song was born when Raria was travelling overseas seeking inspiration for her next project and met someone who was already attached. “I didn’t find out until after we took things to the next level,” she says. “I felt terrible but at the same time, I wouldn’t change a single thing that happened. I was just hoping that after all the drama he caused, I would at least be worth telling the truth for.” The lyrics are raw and painfully honest, and Raria delivers it with such truth and integrity that you cannot step away from the song until the final note. Take a listen below now.\n\nIf Raria continues to deliver music as insightful and plain beautiful as this, her new project is going to be incredibly exciting to watch."
