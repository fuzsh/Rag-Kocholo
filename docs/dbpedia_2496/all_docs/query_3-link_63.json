After performing at school events like Telerama and Man of the Year, Tyler is making his big break.\n\nThis week, after months and months of hard work, Tyler released his first music video of his song, “Girlfriend.”\n\nCollaborating with Noah Gearhart to produce his video, the two worked all summer filming all over Pittsburgh including scenic places like South Park, Mt. Washington, and the Point. Tyler also got some awesome shots at our very own high school.\n\nA few highlights of Tyler’s video include aerial views filmed with Noah’s recording drone, a beautiful view of our city, and some amazing special effects.\n\nTyler says, “It was a lot of fun to make a dream come true. I want to especially thank my good friend Noah Gearhart for filming, editing, and putting lots of time in with me. I also want to thank to my friends and family for the love and support they have given me so far.”"
