        "text": "Kaash Paige returns with visuals for her latest single, “Girlfriend.” In the song, the 21-year-old is intentional about letting her potential romances know that she is not ready for a relationship. She sings:\n\nSo you wanna be my girlfriend?\n\nDon’t fall in love with a b**ch like me\n\nIn the same breath, she has valid reasons to live and enjoy life on her own terms without the pressures of commitment. She sings:\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI can hear them screaming out, Tequila, Tequila\n\nBad b**ches they smoking all the reefer\n\nWhere the keys at talking no Alicia\n\nWhere the freaks at dancing by the speakers\n\nKaash Paige also references her past experiences as well. She’s only used to “goodbyes,” which implies the inconsistencies of her previous relationships.\n\nThe video is a perfect parallel of the record’s lyrics. In several scenes, she is posted with different women. On the other hand, when she references “tequila” and “bad b**ches by the speakers,” she is enjoying the party.\n\n“Girlfriend” is Paige’s first single release since her 2021 track, “Bad Girl.”\n\nCheck out the latest song and visuals from Def Jam’s Kaash Paige."
