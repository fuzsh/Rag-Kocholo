        "text": "“He says he wants a girlfriend, but he doesn’t wanna be a boyfriend” – let’s be real, we all know someone like this. Whether it be someone we’ve dated (shoutout to one of my exes xo), or a friend, acquaintance, or someone you rather just forget. And now Canadian raised and UK based singer-songwriter Cate has immortalised that jerk in an anthem that we can all scream along together as we process his commitment issues through musical therapy.\n\nThe opening verse of the punchy 2-and-a-half minute track sets the tone of the confusing things he wants. “Somebody he can hold when it’s cold at night. Somebody he can have just to pick a fight. Somebody he can touch with his own two hands. Somebody he can love but with no demands” she sings. It’s the confusing manner of being told one thing from him but his actions showing a completely different thing. But my favourite line, which I think perfectly sums up the ideology and emotions behind the song, comes from; “He wants monogamy, but not like that. I want a part of him that I can’t have.” – that hit deep Cate.\n\nThese honest and way too relatable lyrics are woven into a punchy synth driven production that turns the experience into a bit of a celebration. It’s a therapeutic release of emotions as you jump around with your friends and try to forget him and laugh the situation off. The chorus is slinky and ultimately infectious, and is up there with “Groupie” and “Stupid” as her catchiest yet."
