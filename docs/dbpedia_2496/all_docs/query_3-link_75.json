        "text": "“So many of you have been asking me when you’d hear Jesse and I sing together well…I’m happy to announce that it has finally happened!\n\n“@jesse_d_leach and I have been talking about making dubstep/EDM/industrial music since we first met. It feels so good to finally say that we’ve created our first song together and paired it up with this dope dance video by @warren_archer filmed at @elementsfestival_ ???? I did this performance with a separated shoulder. AC joint was totally messed up. If you look closely when I do the handstand on the pole, you can see how swollen it is on the left side. After this gig, I had to take it easy for several months before returning back to my usual crazy self. Looking back now- I don’t know how I was able to pull all this off with such a bad injury, but I do remember how determined and passionate I am about what I do (under any circumstance). I wasnt going to give up.\n\n“I love hearing both of our voices match up with one another and I’m so damn proud of what we have created. Thank you for being my muse, my best friend, and the love of my life @thewaybackwithin. ????\n\n“Our song is called Luminescent Dreams.\n\n“We haven’t figured out a DJ name yet but we are open to suggestions if anyone has any. Please keep in mind that we did this song with zero equipment and it’s just a demo at the moment.\n\n“Thank you to all who listen and appreciate our art."
