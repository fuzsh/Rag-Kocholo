        "text": "There’s nothing quite like the sound of surf rock. It’s like if grunge had met pop and opposites attracted, creating a sound that’s loud yet laid back and a vibe that’s lively but also melodramatic. The merging of punk with California surf culture stems the backbone of band *repeat repeat, with members hailing from both coasts, creating a perfect hybrid of surf rock that’s undeniably satisfying\n\nThe Nashville trio (Jared and Kristyn Corder and Andy Herrin) has released a dreamy, new surf rock single to add to their growing library titled “Girlfriend.” The song encapsulates the band’s self-defined genre of “surf rockcandy” with it’s swooning vocals and sugar-sweet lyrics and easy-to-listen riffs that embellish nothing more but a raw, rock sound. The song will transport you to the oceanside and palm-tree-lined cliffs of southern California and be stuck on repeat until it’s time to come back to reality.\n\nListen to “Girlfriend” below and be sure to check out *repeat repeat for more."
