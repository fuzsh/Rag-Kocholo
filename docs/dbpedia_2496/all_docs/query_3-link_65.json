        "text": "Girl in Red is paying homage to one of the most iconic bands on a special day.\n\nOn Wednesday, the 40th anniversary of the Talking Heads‘ premiere for Stop Making Sense, A24 Music dropped Girl in Red’s cover of “Girlfriend is Better.” The company also revealed the 16-song track list for the tribute project and its release date, May 17.\n\n“Talking Heads is an iconic band that helped define my identity when I was a teenager and they continue to inspire young people all around the world,” Girl in Red said of the track. “Being a part of this tribute is so sick and I’m super grateful I was given the opportunity. Talking Heads forever!”\n\nThe new cover album — titled Everone’s Getting Involved: A Tribute to Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense — will feature a cover of “Heaven” by the National, a performance of “Swamp” by Jean Dawson, “Take Me to the River” by Lorde, “Genius of Love” by Toro y Moi and Brijean, and more.\n\nLast month, Miley Cyrus teased her cover of the Talking Heads fave “Psycho Killer” at an intimate show at Los Angeles’ Chateau Marmont. The performance came months after A24 announced it was working on a Talking Heads tribute album, featuring covers of the group’s Stop Making Sense iconic live album. (A24 acquired the worldwide rights to the Stop Making Sense concert film.)\n\nTrending\n\nEveryone’s Getting Involved: A Tribute to Talking Heads’ Stop Making Sense Track List"
