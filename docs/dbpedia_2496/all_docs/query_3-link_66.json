        "text": "Rising singer/songwriter Ayanna has made a splash with her latest single, “Girlfriend,” released under her new imprint after signing with Love Renaissance whose roster includes Summer Walker and 6lack, to name a few. The track presents a captivating blend of pop, R&B, soul, and other genres, creating a musical mosaic that pushes boundaries and showcases Ayanna’s unique style.\n\n“Girlfriend” serves as the opening chapter of an enchanting series inspired by beloved rom-com sitcoms from the 2000s. The series revolves around the theme of young love and the magical experiences that often accompany it. With this single, Ayanna invites listeners to embark on a fantastical journey through the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of romance.\n\nDirected by the talented Priya Minhas, the music video for “Girlfriend” complements the whimsical nature of the song. The video follows a captivating storyline centered around a hopeless romantic and her four closest friends. Set in London, the protagonist finds herself working at a cozy cafe where fate brings her face-to-face with her crush. What unfolds is a delightful fascination, filled with heartwarming moments and unexpected adventures.\n\nIn press about the single, Ayanna says,” I wrote ‘Girlfriend’ with Gale when I had a big crush on someone. It was the first time I’d felt such strong feelings and the day I wrote the song I was just feeling so overwhelmed and giddy. I said to Gale ‘let’s do something really fun and flirtatious’. The song starts with ‘if I wait any longer, you might make me spill over’ because at the time I really was wondering why he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend yet. I just love how to the point the song is, while still being so playful and fun.”\n\nEnjoy a look at the ‘Girlfriend’ music video below."
