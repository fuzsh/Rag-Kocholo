        "text": "Forget Barbara and Shirley…Philly’s sweetheart Lay Bankz is coming to you as a woman with her new single, “Tell Ur Girlfriend,” out now! In case you didn’t know, one of Lay’s icks is dishonesty; however, the 19-year-old hitmaker admits to stepping out on her relationship with a side piece, who also has a girlfriend. Conveniently timed for V-Day, she’s ready to stop living a lie and assert herself as the new woman in her sneaky link’s life. “If you want me, you gotta put the word in/Tell your girlfriend…that I’m your girlfriend,” she sings. Lay’s brutal honesty may leave someone’s feelings hurt in the end, but this futuristic, dance-worthy banger is sure to alleviate any heartache.\n\n“Tell Ur Girlfriend” arrives on the heels of Lay’s ongoing success with her viral single “Ick,” the fiery club-rap bop about the moment sparks stop flying, which became one of the biggest viral hits of 2023, peaking at #8 on Billboard x TikTok’s Viral Chart behind over 1M+ total videos, and generating over 90 million streams across platforms. “Sloppy Seconds,” the equally-cheeky follow-up single to “Ick,” currently boasts over 7 million streams since its release in December.\n\nMost recently, Lay joined fellow club-influenced artist Skaiwater on “choosin u” and walked the Red Carpet at the 2024 Grammy Awards. Earlier this year, she was named one of Spotify’s Most Necessary Artists To Watch for 2024. Stay tuned for more from Philly’s sweetheart as she dances her way into our hearts, one club banger at a time.\n\nTweet"
