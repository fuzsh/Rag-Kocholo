        "text": "Lay Bankz’s “Tell Ur Girlfriend” is a No. 1 song on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 chart, vaulting from No. 11 to the top of the ranking dated April 27.\n\nThe TikTok Billboard Top 50 is a weekly ranking of the most popular songs on TikTok in the United States based on creations, video views and user engagement. The latest chart reflects activity April 15-21. Activity on TikTok is not included in Billboard charts except for the TikTok Billboard Top 50. As previously noted, titles that are part of Universal Music Group’s catalog are currently unavailable on TikTok.\n\n“Tell Ur Girlfriend” rules after debuting at No. 11 on the April 20 tally. It unseats Alek Olsen’s “Someday I’ll Get It,” which had reigned for four straight weeks.\n\nThe Lay Bankz song, which was released in February, has mainly benefited from a dance trend highlighting the chorus, with influencer Charli D’Amelio one of the high-profile creators getting in on the craze in recent days.\n\nConcurrently, “Tell Ur Girlfriend” debuts at No. 58 on the multimetric Billboard Hot 100, Bankz’s first appearance on the ranking. It accrued 8.8 million chart-eligible U.S. streams April 12-18, a boost of 56%, according to Luminate.\n\nArtemas’ “I Like the Way You Kiss Me,” meanwhile, rises to a new peak of No. 2 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50. Despite continuing to ascend the chart, the song still lacks a major throughline trend, with uploads using the tune ranging from memes to general-interest clips. The song takes another step toward the top 10 of the Hot 100, shooting 16-12 on the latest survey, paced by 19.8 million streams, up 5%.\n\nG-Eazy’s “Lady Killers II” remains at No. 3 on the TikTok Billboard Top 50, while Bakar’s Summer Walker-assisted “Hell N Back” and FloyyMenor and Cris Mj’s “Gata Only” round out the top five at Nos. 4 and 5, respectively. Both songs were covered in the previous chart article; “Hell N Back” remains centered around a relationship- or friendship-based trend using Walker’s “I was over love, I had enough, then I found you” lyric, while “Gata Only” stems from a dance trend.\n\nAside from “Tell Ur Girlfriend,” the other tune that’s a newcomer to the TikTok Billboard Top 50’s top 10 is a classic in Redbone’s “Come and Get Your Love,” which vaults to No. 8. The ‘70s tune has been a mainstay on user-generated content platforms since its synch in the 2014 movie Guardians of the Galaxy, and its latest resurgence is based on both dancing and lip-synching clips.\n\n“Come and Get Your Love,” which reached No. 5 on the Hot 100 in 1974, accumulated 3.2 million streams April 12-18, a 26% leap.\n\nThe week’s top debut on the TikTok Billboard Top 50 is Daren Barenboim and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra’s performance of “Verdi: Messa da Requiem: II. Dies Irae,” which bows at No. 14. Its premiere is thanks to a meme trend on TikTok soundtracking a painting of a courtroom scene, usually with the caption “She won’t stop saying it” or something similar.\n\nAnd Taylor Swift? She’s on the latest chart as well, with “I Can Do It With a Broken Heart” and “Fortnight,” the latter featuring Post Malone, debuting at Nos. 25 and 50, respectively, via three days of data after the April 19 premiere of Swift’s new album, The Tortured Poets Department. More entries – as well as rises for both songs – are possible on the May 4-dated TikTok Billboard Top 50, which will cover metrics accumulated April 22-28."
