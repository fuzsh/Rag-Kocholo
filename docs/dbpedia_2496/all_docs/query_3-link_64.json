        "text": "East London’s singer and songwriter ÄYANNA (pictured left) makes a bold return to her hit 2023 single ‘Girlfriend’ and enlists some of London’s finest ladies Mnelia (pictured right) and Tamera for a fresh new remix. The London Girls Mix sees the girls exchange lyrics and soaring vocals, riffing back and forth between each other about love and crushing. This latest release comes off the back of the In A Perfect World (Complete Set) that was released at the end of January, including all live and acapella versions and full visuals.\n\nSpeaking on the single, she shares: “Working with Tamera and Mnelia for the Girlfriend remix felt like such a no-brainer, because they are two ultra talented rnb artists in the uk who are fellow lover girls like myself. Our chemistry was perfect and the energy flowed in the studio. They both brought a different energy to the song which you can hear when you listen. I love how they added their own essence to the track whilst continuing the energy of vulnerability that the original version had.”\n\nThis remix follows Äyanna’s ground-breaking debut In A Perfect World EP released in Autumn 2023 via LVRN. The striking body of work arrived amidst a slew of early co-signs for the young artist from celebrated artists such Stormzy, Summer Walker, SPINALL to name a few. The towering body of work centred around her signature mosaic of pop, infused with R&B, soul and beyond quickly earned her large acclaim and established her own uncharted lane in music with support from Complex, The Independent, Crack, The Line of Best Fit, Teen Vogue, +44 Amazon, Spotify RADAR UK and more.\n\nÄyanna first captured the attention of the internet and industry tastemakers, through her now viral home videos that showcased her vocal prowess. She now joins the ranks of celebrated LVRN artists such as 6LACK, Summer Walker, DVSN, Davido, SPINALL, Baby Tate and more. With the support of the groundbreaking label and collective, it’s undeniable that Äyanna will establish herself even further as a force in music and beyond.
