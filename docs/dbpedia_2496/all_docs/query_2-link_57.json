        "text": "So Ariana's 3rd single, break up with your girlfriend, i'm bored, has gotten her a little bit of heat in a few different ways. One, people are kind of slut shaming her for wanting another woman's boyfriend, and then people are getting on her about \"queerbaiting\" at the end of the music video by going in for a kiss of her lookalike. I think that there's a lot more going on here about the meaning of the song. On the surface, it does just seem like a fun sex song that you'd hear at a party, but I think it's about finding herself and wanting out of a relationship but not knowing how to get out. In the song Thank U, Next, the lyric of \"I know they say I move on too fast/But this one will last/'Cause her name is Ari/And I'm so good with that\" really just shows that she has found out who she is and can find comfort in being herself.\n\nI think this theme carried over to the music video for BUWYGF,IB. In the video, you see her looking from the guy to his girlfriend throughout the party scene and she gets in between them, and winds up kissing the girl at the end of the video. I think that the girl was intentionally cast to look like Ariana to further this point of self love, not that she's out here trying to be bisexual for the views. I believe that this song is really about her being in a relationship that she's bored in, but not bold enough to leave herself so she's basically asking for the guy to end it. She is the girlfriend that she wants him to break up with. At the end of the video, her kissing that girl is really just showing love for herself and getting out of a relationship that she wasn't happy in.\n\nIs this too deep? Is it just a fun pop song, or is this just a very heavily-veiled metaphor? Thots?\n\nThis is the impression I got from the initial song title, before we'd ever heard it. Putting it straight after TUN on the tracklist was a tactical move, because now that she's announced that she's broken up and moved on with TUN, she's already seen another guy she's interested in and wants him to move on to start the cycle all over again OR...she's talking about herself and how she felt at the end of her relationship. But when paired with the video, I'm thinking it really isn't meant to be so deep and it is exactly what she's singing about in the song. She made the video not match the lyrics because that's very common for artists to do to get their video more views. If you listen to the lyrics, some support the \"she wants the girl\" theory but then it's brought to a halt with lyrics like \"you're at home and thinking she can't compare.\" And most girls don't tell other girls to \"hit it in the morning like it's yours.\" That's a very male/female thing, if you catch my drift. I like the song, I just think people are reading too much into it purely because of the video. You've got to divorce the video from the lyrics and concentrate on what's actually said as the music is what truly matters, not the video."
