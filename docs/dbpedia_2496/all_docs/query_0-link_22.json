        "text": "Revered for the moving and intimate tone of her immersive indie pop sound, Southern California artist Alix Page continues to craft irresistibly sweet and relatable narratives that feel both endearing and resonating to listeners while demonstrating her lasting, authentic appeal as an artist.\n\nThe latest showcase of this comes in the form of her moving new single ‘Girlfriend’, a wonderfully charming exploration of the way that it feels to meet someone new and find yourself swept up in all of the emotions and feelings that come with it, enhanced by the stirring tone of the artist’s alluring sound and making for a euphoric listening experience that perfectly encapsulates these sensations. Everything here from the delicate tone of the vocals, to the thoughtful composure of the lyrics, to the serene and soft tone of the instrumental feels perfectly poised, making for a truly stunning experience for listeners to find themselves getting hopelessly lost within.\n\nOf the new single, Alix states: “’Girlfriend’ is about the early stages of meeting someone new, trying to play it cool and absolutely failing. Around the time I wrote it I felt like I was in high school again; already planning out our future, writing in a diary, making playlists, and hoping they were thinking about me the same way I was thinking about them. I really wanted to capture how sweet and silly and kind of embarrassing having a good ol’ fashioned capital C crush feels, especially so soon after meeting them.”"
