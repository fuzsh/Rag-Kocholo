        "text": "Love Song\n\nFew can do a love ballad better than Lana Del Rey and this song showcases that yet again. From the beginning, the strings of my heart are being pulled. The lyricism in this song is unparalleled and is only intensified by the piano chords. The spoken lines in this song is wonderfully placed, emphasizing the enchantment that being in love brings. That feeling that if you were to die at that very moment, everything would be okay because of that untouchable feeling of bliss. The addition of strings and otherwise larger instrumental background really evokes the larger than life feeling of being in love. The double voiceover in the second verse when Lana urges her love to not “waste any part” of her body stands out as a moment of intimacy that brings the listener closer into the new world of Lana that she has created on the record. Love songs don’t get much better than this and I think this is one of the breakthrough tracks on the album that will go down as one of her best, in the same way that ‘Old Money’ from Ultraviolence has become.\n\n(9.5/10)\n\nCinnamon Girl\n\nOh. My. God. Lana really capitalized on the feeling of connectedness the audience had from the last track and brought it home. In this song, Lana draws on elements from her first album – the reason we fell in love with her in the first place. That being said, there is new poise and a maturity exhibit throughout not only the lyrical content but musical exploration. “There are things I want to say to you, but I’ll just let you live.” is perhaps the most relatable line of the entire record and the musical accompaniment has me gasping for my next breath. “If you hold me without hurting me, you’ll be the first that ever did” screams a familiar vulnerability. The bridge to this song adds an additional depth to the already heart-wrenching lyrics, but the song really sets sail into full heartache at the instrumental chord progression at the end of the song. Suddenly, the song elevates from one of this planet to one beyond the clouds and the stars, a feeling that is almost too hard to describe. What I love most about this song, is that it doesn’t just rely on its strong lyrical content, its musical and vocal elements are just as excellent and powerful. For me, this is the best song on the record.\n\n(10/10)\n\nHow to Disappear\n\nAfter the high emotional intensity from the last two tracks, it’s nice to get a more stripped down track. The song is a nice listen. There are jazz influences and I enjoy the tambourine in the background. I particularly love how Del Rey sings “how to disappear” and then the resultant musical background for quick moments of reflection. The song is not one that I am thinking about after doing a full listen of the album, but it has a charm and keeps me in the state of reflection, emotion, and nostalgia that has been created from beforehand tracks. A necessary track at this stage of the album, with moderate substance lyrically.\n\n(7.5/10)\n\nCalifornia\n\nVocally, Lana Del Rey is much more stripped down in this song and I found that really refreshing. I feel like I’m hearing the real her and I can hear all the perfections and inconsistencies in her voice. Lana has some effortless runs throughout the song that made me rewind for another listen. That being said, I find the chorus to be a little boring, and reminiscent of some of the later tracks in ‘Lust for Life’. I wanted the song to progress a little more, but it just never got there. I can see this appealing to a lot of her fans, but for me, I just missed the connection. In some senses though, the song has character and adds to the depth of the album.\n\n(7/10)\n\nThe Next Best American Record\n\nIf Lana had lost me slightly after the last track, this song brought me right back on board. Lana has a way of talking about the men she encounters in a way that wishes you had been there - as a participant or perhaps, just a fly on the wall. I find it musically very pleasing and once again, I draw on the nostalgia. We have all had those moments of being young and recklessly determined to accomplish the unsurmountable. I like how she references “Topeka’s hot”, a connection to previous allusions in other tracks; Lana’s music builds on itself, a continuation from past experiences. I also enjoy that the song is a little lengthier, giving me more time to take it all in. There are some previous tracks that I wish had a little more. Vocally, Lana does a great job of drawing me in. At times, it gets a little gimmicky especially during the end of the chorus, but this record is one I am definitely wanting to go back to for another listen.\n\n(9/10)\n\nThe Greatest\n\nWhen I listen to this song, I feel like I’m right back in that little town bar listening to someone singing their heart out for a party of 10. This song has intimacy. Lana Del Rey continues to play on the feelings of nostalgia. The chorus has a sense of emergence that is really nice and there is a sense of “coming into” that really brings the album together. The song doesn’t particularly stand out to me, but it has something powerful to say. I think lyrically, musically, and vocally, it’s a strong number from Del Rey. Also, who doesn’t love a good dig at Kanye West and current political leadership. If there is a protest song on the album, this is certainly it, although initially it didn’t strike me as one.\n\n(8/10)\n\nBartender\n\n‘Bartender’ is perhaps the song I think lacks the most lyrical depth. Musically, it has a nice swing to it and the stuttering of the “t”s in Bartender is a very nice touch. I mean come on, we have all been at the bar when we have had too much and dumped too much on the bartender. Del Rey has fun with the track and speaks on an experience that we can relate to. It’s a nice side of Lana that we don’t get often and while it doesn’t stand out as a favorite for me, I think it deserves its place on the album. I like that the end of the track cuts off in mid-thought, further expressing the tale of the drunkard at the bar.\n\n(7.5/10)\n\nHappiness is a Butterfly\n\nThe album is coming to a close and as the penultimate song on the record, this song is preparing for the finale and I can feel the shift in the mood. ‘Happiness is a Butterfly’ reinforces the cohesive feeling that has been persistent throughout this entire album, which is a very hard thing to do. Unfortunately, the song itself doesn’t do too much for me. I think Lana gives a solid vocal performance and musically, it has some moments, but in the same way that I had a hard time connecting with ‘California’, I am having the same problem here. The issue is that I missing the rawness that ‘California’ gave. I also thing that the line “happiness is a butterfly” doesn’t have the same ring it the same way that the other track names provided in their respective songs. Sets up for the next track really strongly though.\n\n(6/10)\n\nHope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have - but I have it\n\nI really love what this song stands for. In a world filled with so much division and inequality, Lana Del Rey takes a real stance here. Lana has often spoken in previous records about the feeling of powerlessness that is part of the woman experience and I find it incredible that here, she continues the narrative. There is a new element of feminism in this song not explicitly vocalized by Lana in her music, and for many of the women who follow her, this song stands as one of empowerment. The song is incredibly raw and stands as a great way to end the record. There is nothing exciting about this record. It fully serves as a message to the public – her fans, congress, and even those who have little regard for the “culture”.\n\n(9/10)"
