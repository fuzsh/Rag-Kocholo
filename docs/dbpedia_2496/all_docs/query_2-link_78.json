        "text": "Girlfriend - Avril Lavigne\n\nMise en scène\n\nThe first thing we see is an establishing shot of the background.This is used to establish the scene and the setting so the target audience see there first indication of the narrative. Here we see that one of the settings is a golf leisure center place. Thus we expect to see various shots of a golf and golf karting place throughout the video. This is effective as the reference back to the location adds consistency to the video, and it makes the narrative easy to follow.\n\nThere is a location change of a studio set up, with a pink backdrop, with a skull and a heart. This is also a common connotation of punk rock music. Which links to the song as Avril Lavinge is a punk rock artist. This is effect as the audience know the genre of the video as it stays constant no matter what the setting is. Therefore the audience know what genre the song is without even listening to the lyrics or song. Therefore showing a link between the song, video and artist. Furthermore, when the location changes to the studio set up we also see a live band performances. Thus adding more to the video than just a narrative, making it seem more interesting and more like a music video than just a story.\n\nWe see any outfit changes from the main artist of Avril Lavigne throughout the video. Her prominent outfit matches the male protagonist. The action then cut to a shot of the main artist Avril centre framed with the antagonist left famed. This is used to show a direct juxtaposition between the two characters. And it also shows that this is the couple that the main artist is intending to break up. This idea is also shown through the fact that the male protagonist and the female antagonist are dressed in similar attire. As they are both wearing black and white gothic clothes, with dark hair. They are also both dressed to fit the genre of the video which is 'punk rock'. Thus suggesting that the protagonists not only match each other but also match the conventions of a punk rock video. While the female antagonist is dressed colourful in pink and green tartan knee length skirt with knee high socks. This suggests that the female antagonist is out of place and she isn’t meant to be with the male protagonist. As they are complete opposites of each other. Whereas him and Avril are a prefect match and better suited for each other\n\nThroughout the video we see an outfit change from the main artist. She changes into a white top, with blue short dungeers and patterned tights, blonde hair with pink highlights. As well as a blue top, black patterned tights with boots. However it still follows the punk rock theme. She begins to wear brighter colours. A change of outift is a common convention of music videos especially those of a female artist. As it signifies that there are different aspects of the video that join together to make the narrative flow. Also, another convention the punk rock is a bold make up look such as bold eyes and lips. This is effective as the audience know what genre the song is within the first couple of seconds of the video being played, to see it it suits their interests.\n\nThere are many different lighting techniques that are used for different effects. Throughout the video there is a lighting mask this is used so that everything in the circle of the video is lit. However, everything else surrounding the video is dark. This is effective as when it is used the main artist is also in the center of the mask. This gives the effect that she is the most important aspect of the shot as everything else around her is darken while she is fully lit. It also presents the idea that it is a party atmosphere, as inside the mask there is dance party happening. This also fits with the song as the song is up tempo, and has a lot of energy and excitement. Therefore the party and dancing element fits with the conventions of the song. In addition, for the same effect there is a lot of spot lighting used when the not only Avril is on screen but also the band. This adds to the performance sense as on stage a band is often spotlighted and it makes it look as if it is a live performance by the band. This is effective as it shows the different locations and shots throughout the video. As we are diverted away from the narrative to see the live band performance aspect. Which makes the video seem more lively and fit with the conventions of music videos.\n\nCamera angle, shots and compostion\n\nMoreover, there are also a lot of high angle shot throughout the video. They are usually used so the target audience is looking down on the main artist. This is therefore effective as the target audience are looking at Avril from a different perspective. This is effective as we sympathizes with her and as the target audience we want the end result of her to be successful with the man that she wants to get. As they feel as they can relate to her more, and that as the audience it is out fate to help her and side with her through having intimate and personal shots such as high angle.\n\nThe camera is used to follow the narrative and it is used to take shots between the narrative and performance. To allow continuous editing in order to make the narrative and more importantly the music video flow. It is used to show certain key aspect of the music video such as; the fact that the main male and female antagonist are wearing matching outfits,or the fact that some people often appear in different focuses. For example, in most shots the main artist is the focus of the camera and each scene as she is often seen in a shallow focus.\n\nThere are many different compositions used throughout the music video. Such as the fact that the main artist is often center framed with a shallow focus when there are various people in the scene. This is effective as it makes Avril stand out from everyone else in the scene. Thus showing that she is the main focus of the shot and everything is about her. Therefore what every point you turn in the video, within a few seconds you will know who the music video is about.\n\nA common shot used throughout the music video is the use of over the shoulder shot. This used to follow the action and to see people's reactions to a certain bit in the scene. This is effective as it takes it easier for the audience to follow what is happening in the scene and it also immerses the audience is the drama and the narrative. It shows the antagonists reaction is just as important as the protagonist's action. This is effective as the audience get an insight into how they should react due to the way other people react. And thus they can see if they agree or disagree with the reaction and action.\n\n​\n\n​\n\nMore over another common shot used throughout music videos is the use of long shots. Long shots are generally used to establish the scene and also adds to the mise en scene. As we are introduced to details such as the location, clothing, people etc. This is effective as through long shots, the target audience can feel as if they are part of the action. As they see the aspects of the music video from different perspectives and we see the whole picture instead of just part of it. Moreover, the use of a dolly or tracking shot has the same affect as we are intruded to the setting and it builds suspense and enigma. Both long shots and tracking/dolly shots are effective as it shows different people and different locations that fit with the narrative and genre, to make them flow and consistent.\n\nEditing\n\nThe pace of the music drives the editing, his can be seen at various points throughout the music video. For example, when the guitar solo is introduced the speed of the cuts quickens. This is to reinforce the fact that a guitar is typically associated with punk rock music. And a guitar is a energetic, vibrant and loud instruments which is reflected in the music video. This is to show that there is a link between the sound and the pace of the cuts. This is effective as it makes the music video flow and links all the different characteristics of a music video together. However, there are also slow cuts to empathize certain aspects of the video eg the fact that throughout the music video the main protagonist and antagonist are wearing similar/ matching outs to empathize the point that they are supposed to be together.\n\nAnother aspects of editing is screen time and who the camera privileges. The screen time is given to the main artist or the protagonist. For example, we see that Avril is in more of the shots. Hence suggesting that the camera privileges her. This is effective as the audience know who the music video is about and through screen time the audience know who's side for the battle for the boy that they should be on. Another example is that in the bridge the main artist is in every shot, Thus suggesting that she is definitely the main focus of the music video and thew song at this part.\n\nAnother aspect of editing used throughout this music video is the use of special effects. Such as the lighting mask or the presents of shiny star like things when the band is performing This is effective as it adds the extra edge to the music video to enhance its looks and features. It also makes the music video genre related as black and shiny star like things are often associated with the punk rock genre.\n\nSound\n\nOne aspect of sound is the use of diegetic sound. This is sound that is natural to the environment. Thus showing a link between what visual and the audio. An example of this is seeing the artist singing the vocals or seeing a guitar and also hearing a guitar. This is effective as it shows consistency and a link between different aspects of the music video. Another aspect of sound is the use of non diegetic sound, an example of this is if you hear siren but there aren't any sirens on the scene. This is used to add to the narrative and makes the video more interesting."
