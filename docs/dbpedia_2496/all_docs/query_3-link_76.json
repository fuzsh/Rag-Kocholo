        "text": "After weeks of social media teasers, fan-made memes, and an appearance from Riverdale's resident speakeasy bodyguard, Charles Melton, on Instagram, Ariana Grande's newest album has arrived. As fans continue to piece together the clues of Thank U, Next, the release of the video for the single with the epic name, \"Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored,\" has left many stunned.\n\nAfter sharing a few clips on Instagram, Ariana released the entire video late Thursday night/early Friday morning. As predicted, Charles Melton of Riverdale appeared, but it turns out he wasn't playing the romantic interest. As the clip shows, Ari was apparently singing the song to Charles's music-video girlfriend, portrayed by Ariel Yasmine.\n\nIn the video, which has already racked up more than 5 million views since its overnight release, Ariana leads us through a friendship that develops between Ari and the couple portrayed by Charles and Ariel (including an origin story for Ari's iconic ponytail). Initially it appears as if Ariana has fallen for Charles, but the ending proves otherwise. In the video's final moments, we watch Ari and Ariel lock lips, leaving many fans surprised at the turn of events.\n\nOn Twitter, fans of the singer have shared their surprise, writing, \"ARIANA REALLY JUST MADE A SONG CALLED BREAK UP WITH YOUR GF IM BORED AND WE ALL ASSUMED IT WAS A HET SONG. HOW DARE WE\" and \"THE ENDING OF BREAK UP WITH YOUR GF MV WHEW.\"\n\nOther fans were quick to speculate that Ariel is meant to jokingly portray Aubrey; as noted by The Huffington Post, listeners had incorrectly thought that Ariana had referenced a girl she was crushing, Aubrey, in \"Thank U, Next.\" The actual lyric is: \"I know they say I move on too fast/But this one gon' last/'Cause her name is Ari/And I'm so good with that.\"\n\nIn tweets, fans pointed out that maybe \"it was Aubrey all along,\" saying, \"ariana really said this is for all the aubrey believers out there.\"\n\nX content\n\nThis content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nOthers agreed, writing, \"If ariana grande was trying to promote self-love with that song, then she should’ve gone about it in a way that wasn’t queerbaiting. as a straight woman, ariana wouldn’t suffer consequences of kissing women that queer women are discriminated against. she used wlw as an aesthetic.\"\n\nAs a number of people have noted, queerbaiting can be damaging and perpetuate inaccurate ideas about sexuality. When celebrities use queer imagery and relationships as narrative devices, it can often feel like pandering, while ignoring the dangers that actual queer people face in everyday life. We know Ariana has been a staunch advocate for LGBTQ rights throughout her career, but it's still unclear what her exact motivation was with this music video. Considering that it has caused quite a stir, it's possible she will address the controversy.\n\nWatch the whole video for \"Break Up With Your Girlfriend, I'm Bored\" below:\n\nLet us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.\n\nWant more from Teen Vogue?
