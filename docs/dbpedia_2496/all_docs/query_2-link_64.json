        "text": "While I’m being possessed by a pop queen tonight, I’m going to make some analysis of a pop song, “Call Your Girlfriend” by a Swedish singer Robyn. I hope this will give you some extra dimensions to how to enjoy the song. I see what I’m writing now as a wine-tasting equivalence of pop music.\n\nYou can listen to the song here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6ImxY6hnfA\n\nLet’s ignore her attractive dancing video for a moment and only focus on the song. This song has some easily identifiable pop characteristics.\n\nFirst of all, the song sticks in your head easily and rapidly. In my severe case, it got me singing without me even realising. This catchy-ness is the most common character of pop music. It is the key ingredient to get people to buy the music in the end. I feel its catchy-ness both lyrically and musically. How so? Let me strip it down.\n\nMusically, it is made of layers upon layers of electronically synthesised sounds. It seems to me that there is some 80’s pop music influence in this song. Apart from Robyn’s voice, not even a single sound in this song is acoustically produced by an instrument familiar to us. Because these sounds are unique and unfamiliar, some people like myself may easily develop a liking to hear them over and over.\n\nLyrically, the song has a unique ‘story‘ to tell. Robyn sings about a relationship situation where a lot of people find themselves in at some point in their lives. That is when you have finally stolen someone else’s partner and now you’re trying to help them with the breaking up.\n\nThis kind of love complication may have been presented in songs that I’m not aware of before, but the story is original enough to my young and musically inexperienced ears. I think a lot of pop music audience out there will agree with me too.\n\nAnother interesting attribute is the mischievousness of the song. The song-writer suggests that she doesn’t feel ashamed that she is a relationship breaker. Instead she feels confident about it. In some cultures, breaking relationships are considered socially immoral. So the song seems rebellious or ‘punk’ which a lot of people think that’s cool.\n\nInstead of now celebrating her triumph at the expense of the girl who’s just been dumped, the song-writer took a ‘mature’ approach. This shows her strength, reasonable personality and experience. I could see this in …\n\n“The only way her heart will mend is when she learns to love again”\n\n“Give your reasons, tell her it’s not her fault. But you just met somebody new”\n\n“It won’t make sense right now, but you’re still her friend”\n\nThose statements are very factual and empirical.\n\nLyrical catchy-ness of a pop song can also come from its kicking original lines. They make you go ‘yeah that’s cool’. This song has some of those lines:\n\n“….Tell her not to get upset, second-guessing everything you’d said and done\n\nAnd then when she gets upset tell her how you never meant to hurt no one…”\n\nThis is the first time I’ve seen the phrase ‘second-guess’ in a pop song. Even better, the statement “second-guessing everything you’d said and done” is a good concept. “done” nicely rhymes with “one” too.\n\nOut of all of the lyrics, the following two lines are my favourite.\n\n“….Don’t you tell her I give you something that you never even knew you missed\n\nDon’t you even try to explain how it’s so different when we kiss…”\n\nNot only the rhymes, but there is also much more to appreciate from this verse. As I explained earlier, it has the catchy originality. It shows strength, confidence and experience of the winner. It shows that she understands how hurtful it would feel for the other person. As much as she doesn’t want to hurt anyone, she shows a lot of self-worth which is incredibly fulfilling to hear.\n\nOn the other hand, however, this verse can be hurtful to hear to some audience who have been rejected before. To them, it can point out weakness, lack of self-esteem and failure in them. This is possibly the least they want to hear. It’s like the dark side of the same coin. That’s why this can spark different emotions depending on who is listening.\n\nAll in all, this is how I think when I listen to this song."
