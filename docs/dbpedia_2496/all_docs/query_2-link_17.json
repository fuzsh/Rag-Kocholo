        "text": "Hi folks!\n\nIn the song \"Take a look at my girlfriend\" from Gym Class Heroes is the following part ->\n\nTake a look at my girlfriend\n\nShe's the only one I got\n\nNot much of a girlfriend\n\nI never seem to get a lot\n\nI have two questions.\n\n1. Does \"got\" mean \"have\" and its meaning is that there has never been another girlfriend before?\n\n2. I don't understand \"Not much of\". Would you tell me its meaning in German or Spanish, please?\n\nIt means 'She's the only girlfriend I have'. We can't tell from this how many girlfriends, if any, the speaker has had in the past.\n\n'Not much of' means something like 'not a good example of'.\n\nWe don't translate in this forum. It is the English Only forum. You could ask at the German or Spanish forums.\n\n1. Does \"got\" mean \"have\" and its meaning is that there has never been another girlfriend before?\n\nIt means \"she's the only girlfriend I have now.\" It doesn't say anything about the past.\n\n2. I don't understand \"Not much of\". Would you tell me its meaning in German or Spanish, please?\n\nIt means something like \"not very great as a girlfirend.\"\n\n(crossed with heypresto)\n\nI think this is originally from Supertramp and the lyrics goes:\n\nTake a look at my girlfriend\n\nShe's the only one I got\n\nNot much of a girlfriend\n\nNever seem to get along\n\nRead more: Supertramp - Take A Look At My Girlfriend Lyrics | MetroLyrics\n\nEdit:\n\nThen my understanding of the last two lines is:\n\nShe is not like a normal girlfriend\n\n(We) never seem to get along\n\nI think this is originally from Supertramp and the lyrics goes:\n\nTake a look at my girlfriend\n\nShe's the only one I got\n\nNot much of a girlfriend\n\nNever seem to get along\n\nRead more: Supertramp - Take A Look At My Girlfriend Lyrics | MetroLyrics\n\nI thought that too, but forgot to look up the lyrics.\n\nI think this is originally from Supertramp and the lyrics goes:\n\nTake a look at my girlfriend\n\nShe's the only one I got\n\nNot much of a girlfriend\n\nNever seem to get along\n\nRead more: Supertramp - Take A Look At My Girlfriend Lyrics | MetroLyrics\n\nEdit:\n\nThen my understanding of the last two lines is:\n\nShe is not like a normal girlfriend\n\n(We) never seem to get along\n\nMetrolyrics seems to be rare in listing \"along\" as the last line. All the other lyrics sites have \"a lot\" - rhymes with \"got\" and that is how I have it stuck in my brain from way back. I think the \"along\" version is an example of mishearing\n\n(Edit: Roger Hodgson - Breakfast in America Lyrics - Classics Live 1 The author's site also has \"a lot\" )\n\nIt's definitely \"get a lot\".\n\nHodgson wrote the song long before he was a member of Supertramp, in 1967 when he was 17 years old. It is the opening song for an album whose theme is life in 1970s U.S. from an outsider's point of view. Since the Gym Class Heroes only use the chorus in their song, the full context isn't there. The young Hodgson thought that going to America, specifically California with its pretty and open-minded girls, would be amazing compared to his relatively drab existence in England. In that context I've always read the line as: he's only got one girlfriend at the moment; she's not that great a girlfriend because she rarely makes herself sexually available to him."
