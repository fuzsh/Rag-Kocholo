        "text": "It's been almost a week - a whole five days! - since Zach Bryan released his live album on Christmas Day, but fans were today offered some respite from this barren stretch with a snippet of a brand new song.\n\nThe prolific Oklahoma artist shared the vulnerable clip on social media, following a series of tributes to his girlfriend, Debbie Peifer, ahead of their one year anniversary.\n\nThe heart-rending track finds Bryan acknowledging his numerous mistakes, flaws and shortcomings, before expressing his bemusement at the fact that his girlfriend still loves him regardless of these.\n\nHe goes on to outline some of the little things he loves about Debbie (âShe lets me drink my liquor when I'm singing through the night, she slaps my hand when it's too muchâ).\n\nThe arrangement runs in the same vein as other recent songs that Bryan has been teasing, with a drawn-in, gentle opening, which then launches into an emphatic chorus with a driving beat.\n\nâDawnsâ, which Bryan briefly made available to fans on Christmas Day alongside his live album, All My Homies Hate Ticketmaster (Live From Red Rocks), carries a similarly stripped-back introduction, which is then juxtaposed by a heavier, anthemic hook.\n\nBryan's new, romantic song, which is yet to be given an official title, concludes with a plea for the couple's love to continue, âMay God bless and keep us, and may you think kind of my nameâ.\n\nThe âSomething in the Orangeâ hitmaker prefaced the snippet with a number of warm-hearted posts about his girlfriend, as the pair approach the one-year milestone in their relationship.\n\nThe track could well feature on Zach Bryan's upcoming studio album, which he revealed last month would be entitled âWriters and Fightersâ."
