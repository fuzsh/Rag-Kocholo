        "text": "Not to be confused with \"O Girl\" or \"Girlfriend.\"\n\n\"O Girlfriend\" (sometimes rendered as \"Oh Girlfriend\") is the tenth and final song from The Green Album.\n\nAppearances\n\nWeezer (The Green Album)\n\nOverview\n\nWhen I lived in the top of Beachwood Canyon—it's this big hill in Hollywood, up by the Hollywood sign—my girlfriend lived at the bottom of the hill. It was so convenient; every time I went out or came back home I'd go by her house and stop in for a bit. But then when we broke up it really sucked, 'cause every time I went out or came back I had to go by her house. So this song was about that feeling, going by her house.\n\n—Rivers Cuomo, Madison, WI, June 2023[1]\n\n\"O Girlfriend\" was written by Rivers Cuomo in 2000 about a \"half-Asian\"[2] ex-girlfriend (the same girlfriend who inspired the 2000 song \"O Girl\" and the 2016 song \"Do You Wanna Get High?\"[3]) Weezer began rehearsing \"O Girlfriend\" at Cuomo's garage rehearsal space in November of 2000, the month before the band entered the studio to record The Green Album. The song was among fourteen un-mastered Green Album tracks that leaked in the spring of 2001.\n\n\"O Girlfriend\" was only performed live as a band four times. On August 27, 2011, Rivers Cuomo played the song acoustically to viewers on the streaming website Ustream. Cuomo also performed a solo, acoustic rendition of the song at a Weezer concert in Madison, Wisconsin on June 14, 2023.\n\nReception\n\nThe song received a positive review from Teenage Victory Songs, representing the positive reception that the band's more diehard fan base has shown the song. TVS included the song in \"The Grand Playlist.\"\n\nLive performances\n\nWeezer concert: 05/20/2002\n\nWeezer concert: 07/06/2002\n\nWeezer concert: 07/07/2002\n\nWeezer concert: 07/14/2002\n\nWeezer concert: 06/14/2023\n\nAudio\n\nLive, July 14, 2002\n\nPersonnel\n\nRivers Cuomo – lead guitar, lead vocals\n\nPatrick Wilson – percussion\n\nBrian Bell – rhythm guitar, backing vocals\n\nMikey Welsh – bass guitar, backing vocals\n\nRic Ocasek - producer\n\nLyrics\n\nI miss you, and I wonder\n\nHow you feel about me too\n\nDo you miss the way we'd play\n\nAnd waste our time away?\n\nSuddenly, we're apart\n\nAnd I can't see you every night\n\nThough we'd fight I loved you so much\n\nNow I can't feel your touch\n\nOh, girlfriend\n\nThat's the end\n\nAnd I'm lost without your love\n\nOh, love\n\nIn your arms, I was happy\n\nAs a little boy could be\n\nTaking pills and mellowing out\n\nNow I just want to shout\n\nFor your love, 'cause I'm drifting\n\nFurther from you every day\n\nDriving by your place every night\n\nI used to feel alright\n\nOh, girlfriend\n\nThat's the end\n\nAnd I'm lost without your love\n\nOh, love\n\nFeeling fancies every night\n\nWhen I dream to be alright\n\nOh, love\n\nOh, love\n\nOh, girlfriend\n\nThat's the end\n\nAnd I'm lost without your love\n\nOh, love\n\nIn your arms\n\nI was happy as a little boy could be\n\nTaking pills and mellowing out\n\nNow I just want to shout\n\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nNow I just want to shout\n\nDo-do-do-do-do-do-do\n\nNow I just want to shout\n\nKnown recordings\n\nPerformer(s) Title Filename Date of recording Recording location Length Appeared on Notes Weezer O Girlfriend November 11, 2000[4] 6145 Rodgerton Dr., Los Angeles, CA Weezer O Girlfriend December 14, 2000[4] Swing House Studios, West Hollywood, CA Rehearsal, version 1 Weezer O Girlfriend December 14, 2000[4] Swing House Studios, West Hollywood, CA Rehearsal, version 2 Weezer O Girlfriend December 14, 2000[4] Swing House Studios, West Hollywood, CA Rehearsal, version 3 Weezer O Girlfriend December 22, 2000[4] S.I.R.
