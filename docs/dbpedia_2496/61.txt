What unfolds is a delightful fascination, filled with heartwarming moments and unexpected adventures.

In press about the single, Ayanna says,” I wrote ‘Girlfriend’ with Gale when I had a big crush on someone. It was the first time I’d felt such strong feelings and the day I wrote the song I was just feeling so overwhelmed and giddy. I said to Gale ‘let’s do something really fun and flirtatious’. The song starts with ‘if I wait any longer, you might make me spill over’ because at the time I really was wondering why he hadn’t asked me to be his girlfriend yet. I just love how to the point the song is, while still being so playful and fun.”
