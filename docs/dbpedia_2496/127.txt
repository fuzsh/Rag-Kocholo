Emerging Portuguese pop singer-songwriter Catherine Sunday introduces her brand-new single, “Girlfriend.”

Talking about the song, Catherine shares, “I actually was going through a bit of a writer’s block when Charlie Puth released his own song ‘Girlfriend’ last year. I loved it so much that I set myself to write a song with the same title and a bit of a play on it.”

She goes on to add, “‘Girlfriend’ is the first track of my two-track single, ‘Nothing Lasts Forever,’ and it’s about being in that awkward situation of when you are with someone, but you haven’t really talked about what you are or where it’s going. It’s a mess, but feelings more often than not get you in weird situationships.”

After polishing her songwriting at the Brighton Institute of Modern Music, Catherine began enlarging her unique sound, working with various producers until she achieved the distinctive expression she was seeking – the optimal point between experimental and commercial pop. Releasing 2020’s single, “Champagne,” she collected more than 150,000 streams. She followed with “Bad Together.”

“Girlfriend” opens on percolating colors topped by Catherine’s sensuous, posh tones pushing out femme fatale timbres as she lays out her feelings for her partner. Snapping percussion gives the rhythm categorical communication, aided by a throbbing kick-drum and a vibrating bassline.

Glowing vocal harmonies imbue the song with depth and dimension as Catherine’s vampiric-laced voice infuses the lyrics with Siren-like, you’re-playing-with-fire tonal nuances.

“Cause I could be your girlfriend but you’re playin’ / I won’t wait no no that’s what I’m sayin’ / I could be your girlfriend but you’re playin’ / Yea you’re playin’ yourself, yea you’re playin’ yourself.”

Sizzling with the dangerous woman sensation of the crème de la crème voice of Catherine Sunday, “Girlfriend” delivers edgy, irresistible pop savors.
