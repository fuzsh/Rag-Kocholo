        "text": "A dolphin was found dead in a canal along the Karnaphuli River today. It is presumed that the dolphin died after a propeller of an engine-run boat hit it in the Karnaphuli River.\n\nThe critically endangered mammal was spotted by locals at the Purbo Ghudondi area of Boalkhali Upazila today at noon.\n\nProfessor Manzoorul Kibria, zoologist and also eminent Halda researcher, told The Daily Star that the dolphin weighing more than100 kg is assumed to have died of the wound caused by a propeller of an engine run boat.\n\nThe male dolphin was buried at the bank of Karnaphuli River, he said adding that the wound on its back seemed around 24 hours old.\n\nFrom 2017 to July 2021, 29 dolphins have died in the Halda river being hit by boat propellers."
