        "text": "Background: The occurrence of breast Cancer is a rising concern in Bangladesh. A hospital based case control study was conducted. Methodology: A nationwide representative sample of 100 out of 115 cancer patients aged 20 or older was interviewed at NICRH to provide information on awareness of the risk factors of breast cancer causes in Bangladeshi population. Results and discussion: Highest number of patients was from 40-49 (39%) and 30-39 (27%) year-age group. About 15% patients had direct family history, 21% had early periods. About 14% have got late menopause. If women begin menopause after age 55, the risk increases. 15% women have had not had children, and 10% had their first child after age 30. Study found women using birth control pills (47%), have slightly greater risk. 9% women’s breast feeding lasts below 1 year. And about 7% patient never breast fed their child. About 40% female patients do not walk as exercise. Conclusion: Results suggested a mixture of different factors with Aging and direct family history poses higher risk for breast cancer.\n\nBreast cancer (BC) is considered as one of the most prevalent cancers among women in Bangladesh. The aim of the present study was to investigate the knowledge about BC, risk factor prevalence and breast selfexamination (BSE) practices among female populations of Bangladesh. After taking verbal consent, 1051 females of age ≥20 years from different districts of Bangladesh were interviewed using a pre-tested questionnaire in 2015. Among the respondents, three-forth (77.74%) knew (heard or read) about BC and their main source of information was electronic media (74.54%). Most of them could identify at least one sign and symptom (73.93%) and one risk factor of BC (71.55%). But only 34.16% and 52.14% correctly identified at least one option for early detection and treatment, respectively. Although early screening of BC was very important according to 58.90% respondents and BSE procedure was known to 21.69%, only 13.13% actually performed BSE. Major risk factors prevailing among the respon...\n\nBreast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women both in the developed and the developing world and leading cause of cancer death in women. A hospital based case control study was carried out among 70 women with breast cancer and 70 women without breast cancer to analyze the risk factors associated with development of breast cancer in selected hospitals of Dhaka city. A semi-structured questionnaire comprise socio-demographic and socioeconomic related information, reproductive and obstetric related factor, hormonal Contraceptive and Hormone Replacement Therapy use, life style related factor (personal habit, dietary habit, physical activity etc). In adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals for significant risk factors were obtained from logistic regression analysis. Significant risk was found among nonworking women (OR 2.7, 1.03-7.1), positive family history of cancer (OR 2.3, 1.02-5.2) and early menarche (OR 3.4, 1.5-7.9). Family history of cancer, early menarche may play significant role in developing breast cancer in Bangladeshi women.\n\nBackground Breast cancer (BCa) is a leading cause of mortality among women in Bangladesh. Many young women in Bangladesh have poor knowledge about breast cancer screening, including risk factors, warning signs/symptoms, diagnosis and early detection. We investigated awareness about breast cancer risk factors as a screening tool among women at the Sheikh Hasina Medical College (SHMC) of Tangail district in Bangladesh. Methods A cross sectional survey was conducted to collect data via a structured questionnaire from SHMC during the period of February to December 2019. A total of 1,007 participants (aged 33.47 (±12.37 years)) was considered for data analysis. Results Of the 1,007 women, about 50% were knowledgeable about the risk factors. Pain in the breast was identified as the most commonly warning sign/symptom of breast cancer. Only 32.2% of respondents knew at least one breast cancer screening method. The mean knowledge was scored 3.43 ± 2.25 out of a total possible score of 8. Awa...\n\nBreast cancer is a disease, which if detected early can be cured; this is now a scientific truth. Because of fear and lack of awareness and knowledge, cancer is mostly not detected at the early stages. General Objective: \" To assess the level of awareness on \" Prevention and Control of Breast Cancer among the 15-50 age group women \" Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study was utilized during data collection. The study areas was selected purposively from selected hospitals in Dhaka city such as, with structured and unstructured questionnaire. Study population was 15-50 age group women. who attended the out Patient Department for their treatment. Total sample size was 330. Among 330 women, 200 women from DMCH, 70 from SSMCH, and 60 from NICRH were included. The mean age of the respondents was 31.03 (± SD 9.50) years. Most (60%) of the respondents were residing in urban areas, 25.26 completed primary school. More than fifty percent (55.20) heard about breast cancer. 73.33% of the respondents had no knowledge about the risk factors of breast cancer. Only 26.67% had the knowledge of the risk factors. The study result showed that all respondents gave multiple answer regarding the knowledge about the best way to prevent and control of breast cancer. It is found from the result that the majority 76.06% women were not aware on prevention and control of breast cancer only 23.94% was aware. 100% were agreed that they need nursing support. Though the sample size was is not large enough but still this finding is important. Further qualitative and quantitative research in this area needs to be directed towards studying the female population in Bangladesh by using unstructured interview methods that may provide more and different information about awareness on breast cancer and its prevention and control, and how much they feel it important in attending the OPDs for their breast checkup.\n\nObjective: Breast cancer (BC) is the leading and most prevalent form of cancer among women in Bangladesh and worldwide. The objectives of this study were to assess the existing knowledge on breast cancer and the practices of breast self-examination among female Bangladeshi university students. Method: A cross-sectional study was carried out among the 276 female university students. Data were collected by face-to-face interview by using a pre-tested questionnaire.Results: The study results indicate that most of the participants were well informed about breast cancer. Predominantly mentioned signs of breast cancer was a lump in the breast followed by pain in the breast or nipple. The correct responses of breast cancer risk factors were exposure to radiation (58.20%), positive family history (47.6%), obesity (46.9%), lack of physical exercise (43.6%) and smoking (43.2%). The students were well informed about breast self-examination for early diagnosis, but they were not properly inform...\n\nBackground: Carcinoma of the breast is the most common malignancy in females. At present carcinoma breast is the leading cancer in Bangladesh and is competing cancer cervix in incidence. Epidemiological studies at regional and global levels suggest the occurrence of carcinoma breast at a younger, premenopausal age in Indian and Asian women as compared with western women. Knowledge of this factor emphasizes the need to modify the timing of modalities of detection of early carcinoma and its management. According to literature, majority of carcinoma breast cases in the western countries present in Stages I and II of the disease whereas in Bangladesh majority cases present in Stage III of the disease. The objective of this study is to observe age of occurrence of breast cancer and stage of cancer in SSMC and MH.Methods: A cross sectional observational study was conducted in 34 patients of histopathologically confirmed breast cancer.Results: Mean age of subjects was 46.24±7.4 years.
