        "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jan. 30 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kyphon Inc. today announced that net sales for the quarter ended December 31, 2006 totaled $112.6 million, an increase of 31% over the $85.8 million in net sales reported for the fourth quarter of 2005. For the year ended December 31, 2006, Kyphon reported net sales of $407.8 million, an increase of 33% over the $306.1 million reported for the same period in 2005.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter of 2006 increased 228% to $12.2 million, or $0.26 per diluted share, compared to net income of $3.7 million or $0.08 per diluted share for the same period in 2005, which lacked any FAS 123(R) charges. Excluding non-cash FAS 123(R) charges, non-GAAP net income for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $0.38 per diluted share. Fourth quarter 2005 results included a $20.0 million special charge for purchase of a technology license. Non-GAAP net income per diluted share for the fourth quarter of 2005, which excludes the license acquisition charge, was $0.34. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is provided below.\n\nNet income for the full-year 2006 increased 33% to $39.7 million or $0.86 per diluted share, compared to net income of $29.8 million, or $0.66 per diluted share for the same period in 2005. Excluding non-cash FAS 123(R) stock-based compensation charges, non-GAAP net income for the year ended December 31, 2006 increased 39% over the same period a year ago to $58.9 million, or $1.27 per diluted share. Excluding the 2005 license acquisition charges, non-GAAP net income per diluted share for 2005 was $0.94. A reconciliation of GAAP and non-GAAP operating results is provided below.\n\nKyphon’s revenues for the fourth quarter included $84.4 million in net sales in the United States and $28.2 million in net sales from its international operations, representing growth in those markets of 22% and 69%, respectively, over the fourth quarter of 2005. For the full-year 2006, net sales were $324.1 million in the United States and $83.7 million from international operations, representing growth in those markets of 26% and 72%, respectively, over 2005.\n\n“Although our business in the U.S. in the fourth quarter was impacted by the uncertainty and distraction created by Medtronic’s launch of its Arcuate XP product, we are pleased with our overall performance as our international business saw strong increased procedural penetration in virtually all of its markets,” commented Richard Mott, president and chief executive officer. “These results reflect the significant strides the company made in 2006 in expanding the channel to the spine specialists, continued strong clinician adoption of the balloon kyphoplasty procedure to treat their patients despite increasing competition in the fourth quarter, growing patient and primary physician awareness, introducing new products aimed at improving spinal deformity correction and expanding into new geographies.”\n\n“We achieved several milestones in 2006 that we believe will help us attain our growth objectives,” said Mott. “Substantial progress was made in the clinical, regulatory and reimbursement environments, including the publication of the first multicenter, prospective, two-year follow-up data for balloon kyphoplasty, a positive recommendation from the UK’s National Institute for Clinical Excellence for the balloon kyphoplasty procedure, and the establishment of a Category 1 ICD-9 physician reimbursement procedure code specifically for kyphoplasty by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services,” Mott continued.\n\n“We also announced significant acquisitions in December 2006, St. Francis Medical Technologies, which we closed on January 18, 2007, and the proposed acquisitions of all of the spine-related assets of Disc-O-Tech Medical Technologies. By providing us with new platforms for growth in the treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis and minimally invasive fusion, these acquisitions are key elements in executing our strategy and advancing our mission to become the recognized global leader in restoring spinal function through minimally invasive therapies. I believe we are well positioned for future growth as we enter 2007,” Mott concluded.\n\nFinancial Outlook for Full-Year 2007 and Quarter Ending March 31, 2007\n\nFor purposes of providing guidance, the company presently assumes the Disc-O-Tech B-Twin and SKy Bone asset acquisition will close by the end of the first quarter of 2007 and the Confidence-related asset transaction will close by the end of the third quarter of 2007. Both transactions remain subject to clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act of 1976, as amended. The following guidance includes an estimated one time pre-tax charge of $56 million for in-process research & development (IPR&D) associated with the acquisitions of St. Francis Medical Technologies (SFMT) and the spinal assets of Disc-O-Tech. Of the estimated $56 million pre-tax IPR&D charge, approximately $21 million will be non-tax deductible. The following guidance assumes $53 million of the IPR&D charge will occur in the first quarter, which relates to the B-Twin, SKy Bone, and SFMT acquisitions, and the remaining $3 million will be recorded in the third quarter of 2007 when the Confidence-related asset transaction is anticipated to close.\n\nThe guidance further assumes amortization of intangible charges of $26 million for the full year and $5 million for the first quarter. In accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations, the guidance also assumes a purchase price adjustment of approximately $8 million relating to a fair value write-up of the X-STOP(R) system inventory on hand at the time the SFMT transaction closed in January 2007. This adverse impact will be reflected in gross margin in the first and second quarters of 2007 as the inventory is sold.\n\nAs you will note, we are not providing earnings per share guidance at this time due to the fact that our interest cost assumptions are currently in flux. Accordingly, we will address our target expectations for 2007 and the first quarter ending March 31, 2007 only through operating income and provide additional guidance once interest costs are known.\n\nTargets for Full-Year 2007 and Quarter Ending March 31, 2007 Full-Year 2007 Qtr Ending March 31, 2007 Target Net Sales ($millions) $565 to $585 $122 - $127 Targets as a Ratio to Net Sales: Gross Margin (1), (2) 85.5% to 86.5% 84.0% to 84.5% R&D (1) 9.5% to 10.0% 9.5% to 10.0% Sales & Marketing (1) 42.5% to 43.5% 47.5% to 48.5% G&A (1) 13.1% to 13.6% 14.5% to 15.5% Amortization of Intangibles (3) 4.5% to 4.6% 4.0% to 4.2% Total Oper Expenses Excl IPR&D (4) 69.7% to 71.7% 75.5% to 78.2% Operating Income Excluding IPR&D (4) 13.8% to 16.8% 5.8% to 9.0% Operating Inc/(Loss) Including IPR&D (5) 4.0% to 7.0% (37.7%) to (32.7%) (1) Excludes amortization of intangibles which is shown separately. (2) 2007 Target and first quarter 2007 Target includes approximately $8 million, and $4 million, respectively, for the adverse impact to cost of goods sold associated with the X-STOP(R) system inventory fair value write-up in accordance with SFAS 141, Business Combinations. (3) Upon completion of the final purchase price allocation, amortization of intangibles will be incorporated into the appropriate expense categories in cost of goods sold and operating expenses. (4) 2007 Target and first quarter 2007 Target excludes estimated in-process research and development charges of $56 million and $53 million, respectively. (5) 2007 Target and first quarter 2007 Target includes estimated in-process research and development charges of $56 million and $53 million, respectively. Selected Metrics\n\nKyphon ended the fourth quarter of 2006 with approximately 300 device sales representatives in the U.S. Internationally, the company ended the fourth quarter with approximately 120 sales professionals. Worldwide, Kyphon’s field based sales organization, which includes device sales representatives, sales management, and other field based sales professionals, totaled approximately 480 individuals as of December 31, 2006. The company is planning to end 2007 with approximately 580 to 610 field based sales professionals worldwide. This global sales organization works with spine specialists worldwide who perform, or who are candidates to perform, the balloon kyphoplasty procedure and the primary care physician community, to educate them about the balloon kyphoplasty treatment for spinal fractures and the X-STOP(R) Interspinous Process Decompression (IPD(R)) procedure to treat lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\nThrough the fourth quarter of 2006, approximately 6,000 spine specialists in the U.S. and 4,400 outside the U.S. have been trained to perform balloon kyphoplasty. For 2007, Kyphon expects to train a total of approximately 1,700 physicians to perform balloon kyphoplasty procedures, 700 in the U.S. and 1,000 outside of the U.S. Approximately 1,400 spine surgeons in the U.S. have been trained to perform the X-STOP(R) IPD(R) procedure to date. In 2007, the company expects to train approximately 1,800 spine specialists in the U.S. to perform the X-STOP(R) IPD(R) procedure.\n\nUse of Non-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nKyphon management believes that investors may wish to consider the impact of certain charges to better understand short- and long-term financial trends in the company’s operations and financial performance. These charges result from facts and circumstances that vary in frequency and/or impact on continuing operations. In addition, Kyphon management uses results of operations before certain charges to evaluate the operational performance of the company and as a basis for strategic planning. Investors should consider these non-GAAP measures in addition to, and not as a substitute for, financial performance measures in accordance with GAAP.\n\nReconciliation of GAAP and Non-GAAP Operating Results\n\nNon-GAAP fourth quarter 2006 and full-year ended December 31, 2006 results exclude stock-based compensation charges under FAS 123(R). Non-GAAP second and fourth quarter 2005 and full-year December 31, 2005 results exclude charges for the acquisition of technology licenses. This non-GAAP presentation is given in part to enhance the understanding of the company’s historical financial performance and comparability between periods in light of a change in accounting standards particularly since the company did not include stock-based compensation under FAS 123(R) as an expense in its financial statements prior to January 1, 2006. In addition, the company believes that the non-GAAP presentation to exclude stock-based compensation and certain other non-recurring charges is relevant and useful information that will be widely used by analysts, investors, and other interested parties in the medical device industry. Accordingly, the company is disclosing this information to permit additional analysis of the company’s performance. A reconciliation of Kyphon’s non-GAAP operating results to its GAAP operating results for these periods follows (unaudited, in thousands, except per share amounts):\n\nKyphon Inc.
