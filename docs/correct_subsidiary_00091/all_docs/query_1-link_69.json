LabClasp noninvasively detects and measures blood biomarkers – in just 10 seconds. We are seeking to partner with patient monitoring and other medtech companies, to bring this product to market. The companies will have exclusivity for the biomarkers of greatest interest to them, with their device configured to their own specifications. LabClasp’s microfluidic technology collects and analyzes interstitial fluid, without a needle and with no fluid-access sensation or mark on the skin. Accuracy against parallel blood draws, with glucose and alcohol, has been validated in multiple clinical trials at Harvard hospitals. Mayo Clinic (a shareholder) and Brigham & Women's Hospital will soon deploy LabClasp in their respective ICUs, to assay lactate with high frequency for early sepsis detection and for monitoring the status of sepsis patients. Upcoming biomarkers are troponin, melatonin, and cortisol."
