        "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Jan. 18 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kyphon Inc. today announced that it has closed the acquisition of St. Francis Medical Technologies, Inc. (“St. Francis”), a privately held, California-based company that manufactures the X-STOP(R) Interspinous Process Decompression (IPD(R)) System, the first FDA-approved interspinous process device for treating lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\nThe transaction broadens Kyphon’s focus in minimally invasive spine by adding the X-STOP(R) technology platform to its existing KyphX(R) balloon kyphoplasty technologies for repairing vertebral compression fractures and its recently launched Functional Anaesthetic Discography(TM) procedure for diagnosing the source of low back pain.\n\n“The acquisition of St. Francis is a key element in executing our strategy and advancing our mission to become the recognized global leader in restoring spinal function through minimally invasive therapies,” said Richard Mott, Kyphon’s president and chief executive officer. “We believe this is an excellent strategic fit for Kyphon and further expands our innovative treatments for the aging spine to include less invasive treatment of lumbar spinal stenosis.”\n\nKyphon acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity of St. Francis for $525 million in cash at closing, and additional revenue-based contingent payments of up to $200 million payable in either cash or a combination of cash and stock, at Kyphon’s election. Kyphon financed the transaction through a combination of cash on hand and bank financing, including a $425 million syndicated term loan and $200 - $300 million credit facility, arranged and led by Bank of America N.A.\n\nKyphon previously announced that it had signed a definitive agreement to acquire St. Francis on December 4, 2006. A further update on the St. Francis acquisition will be provided during Kyphon’s fourth quarter 2006 earnings call, which is presently scheduled for Tuesday, January 30, 2007 at 2:00 p.m. Pacific Time. Interested parties may access the call by dialing 1-800-289-0533 (U.S.) or 913-981-5525 (International). A live webcast of the call will also be available from the Investor Relations section of the company’s corporate Web site at www.kyphon.com. The call will be archived on this site for a minimum of two months.\n\nAn audio replay of the call will be available beginning from 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday, January 30, 2007, until 12:00 a.m. Pacific Time on Tuesday, February 20, 2007. To access the replay, dial 888-203-1112 (U.S.) or 719-457-0820 (International) and enter the access code 8484841.\n\nAbout Kyphon Inc.\n\nKyphon develops and markets medical devices designed to restore and preserve spinal function and diagnose low back pain using minimally invasive technologies. The company’s products are used in balloon kyphoplasty for the treatment of spinal fractures caused by osteoporosis or cancer, in the Functional Anaesthetic Discography(TM) procedure for diagnosing the source of low back pain, and in the Interspinous Process Decompression(R) procedure for treating lumbar spinal stenosis.
