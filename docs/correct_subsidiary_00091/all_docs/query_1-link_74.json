        "text": "Single balloon versus double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty: a systematic review and meta-analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nJing, Zehao; Dong, Jianli; Li, Zhengwei; Nan, Feng\n\n2018-06-19\n\nKyphoplasty has been widely used to treat vertebral compression fractures (VCFs). In standard procedure of kyphoplasty, two balloons were inserted into the vertebral body through bipedicular and inflated simultaneously, while using a single balloon two times is also a common method in clinic to lessen the financial burden of patients. However, the effect and safety of single balloon versus double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty are still controversy. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, eligible studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search of PubMed, Cochrane library EMBASE, Web of Science, Wanfang, CNKI, VIP and CBM until January 1, 2018. Results from individual studies were pooled using a random or fixed effects model. Seven articles were included in the systematic review and five studies were consisted in meta-analysis. We observed no significant difference between single balloon and double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty in visual analog scale (VAS), angle (kyphotic angle and Cobb angle), consumption (operation time, cement volume and volume of bleeding), vertebral height (anterior height, medium height and posterior height) and complications (cement leakage and new VCFs), while the cost of single balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is lower than that of double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty. The results of our meta-analysis also demonstrated that single balloon can significantly improve the VAS, angle and vertebral height of patients suffering from VCFs. This systematic review and meta-analysis collectively concludes that single balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty is as effective as double balloon bipedicular kyphoplasty in improving clinical symptoms, deformity and complications of VCFs but not so expensive.

But high cement leakage rate caused by a low-viscosity cement and high injection pressure has limited its general use. Balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) and high-viscosity cement vertebroplasty (HVCV) are 2 modifications of vertebroplasty designed to decrease cement leakage. To assess the safety and efficacy of HVCV compared with BKP. A prospective cohort study. Department of Spine Surgery, an affiliated hospital of a medical university. One hundred seven patients suffering from painful OVCFs were randomly assigned into HVCV or BKP groups. Visual Analog Scale (VAS), Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), cement leakage, and vertebral height restoration were evaluated. All occurring complications and injected cement volumes were recorded. The follow-up time was one year. VAS and ODI scores improved in both groups, and did not differ significantly between the 2 groups. More cement was used in the BKP group than in HVCV group (4.22 vs. 3.31 mL, P < 0.0001). The incidence of cement leakage in the HVCV group was lower than that of the BKP group (13.24% vs 30.56%, P < 0.05). No symptomatic cement leakages occurred in the HVCV group. In the BKP group, one patient experienced discogenic back pain related to a disc leak, and another patient had asymptomatic cement emboli in the lung related to venous leakage. The mean compression rate before the procedure was 29.98% in the HVCV group and 28.67% in the BKP group (P = 0.94). The vertebral height was improved significantly and maintained at one-year follow-up in both groups. BKP was more effective in vertebral height restoration than HVCV (44.87% vs. 23.93%, P < 0.0001). There was one case of a new adjacent vertebral fracture in the HVCV group (2%), and 4 cases of new nonadjacent vertebral fractures in the BKP group (7.84%) (P = 0.18). A single-center and relatively small-sample size study.

Two minimally invasive surgical approaches were developed for the management of symptomatic VCFs: balloon kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of symptomatic VCFs. Methods Between July 2011 and June 2012, one hundred and eighty-seven patients with two hundred and fifty-one vertebras received balloon kyphoplasty in our hospital. There were sixty-five male and one hundred and twenty-two female patients with an average age of 74.5 (range, 61 to 95 years). The pain symptoms and quality of life, were measured before operation and at one day, three months, six months and one year following kyphoplasty. Radiographic data including restoration of kyphotic angle, anterior vertebral height, and any leakage of cement were defined. Results The mean visual analog pain scale decreased from a preoperative value of 7.7 to 2.2 at one day (pâ<â.05) following operation and the Oswestry Disability Index improved from 56.8 to 18.3 (pâ<â.05). The kyphotic angle improved from a mean of 14.4Â° before surgery to 6.7Â° at one day after surgery (pâ<â.05). The mean anterior vertebral height increased significantly from 52% before surgery to 74.5% at one day after surgery (pâ<â.05) and 70.2% at one year follow-up. Minor cement extravasations were observed in twenty-nine out of two hundred and fifty-one procedures, including six leakage via basivertebral vein, three leakage via segmental vein and twenty leakage through a cortical defect. None of the leakages were associated with any clinical consequences. Conclusions Balloon kyphoplasty not only rapidly reduced pain and disability but also restored\n\nThe Role of Unilateral Balloon Kyphoplasty for the Treatment of Patients with OVCFS: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nXiang, Guang-Heng; Tong, Min-Ji; Lou, Chao; Zhu, Si-Pin; Guo, Wei Jun; Ke, Chen Rong\n\n2018-05-01\n\nAn increasing number of studies have been conducted to apply unilateral balloon kyphoplasty in the treatment of ostroporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs). However, the efficacy and safety of unilateral kyphoplasty and whether a unilateral or a bilateral approach is superior is controversial. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of unilateral balloon kyphoplasty and use meta-analysis to compare the efficacy and safety of unilateral and bilateral kyphoplasty in patients with OVCFs. A systematic literature search was conducted from 1970 to April 2017 using Medline database and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Articles were limited to those published in English. Randomized controlled trials and nonrandomized comparative studies were also included. The following search terms were used: \"osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures,\" or \"OVCF,\" and \"unilateral kyphoplasty,\" or \"unipedicular approach,\" or \"single balloon kyphoplasty,\" or \"one balloon kyphoplasty.\" A comprehensive search of reference lists of retrieved articles and previous published reviews was also performed to ensure inclusion of all possible studies. All potential articles were independently reviewed by 2 investigators for inclusion into the final analysis. MINORS score was used for nonrandomized studies, and Detsky quality index was applied for prospective randomized controlled trials. Systematic review and meta-analysis was performed for the included studies. After unilateral balloon kyphoplasty the mean postoperative visual analog score (VAS) was from 1.74 to 4.77, mean postoperative kyphotic angle was from 5.9Âº to 11.22Âº, and complications involving cement leaks was from 6.8 to 21.9% or adjacent level fractures was from 0 to 5.6%). Unilateral kyphoplasty had significantly lower operative time, and less bone cement volume; however, the postoperative VAS, Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), vertebral height restoration rate, and cement leakage and adjacent\n\nVenous air embolism in consecutive balloon kyphoplasties visualised on CT imaging.\n\nPubMed\n\nTins, Bernhard J; Cassar-Pullicino, Victor N; Lalam, Radhesh; Haddaway, Mike\n\n2012-09-01\n\nWe noted a large amount of intravenous gas during balloon kyphoplasty on CT imaging. Formal assessment to understand the extent, possible causes and implications was undertaken. Ten consecutive cases of balloon kyphoplasty were performed under general anaesthesia in the prone position, on a single vertebral level using a two-step technique under combined fluoroscopic and CT guidance. CT of the affected vertebra was performed before, after, and intermittently during the procedure. In 2 cases delayed CT was carried out in the supine position. Gas was seen on CT imaging, but not on conventional fluoroscopy. The gas is most likely to be air introduced during the procedure and was seen in the epidural and paravertebral venous plexus, posterior intercostal veins, renal veins, IVC and azygos vein. The average measured volume of gas seen on the post-procedure CT imaging was 1.07 mL, range 0.16-3.97 mL. There was no correlation of the measured amount of gas to the procedure duration or location, the use of a curette or the injected cement volume. Delayed CT in the supine position no longer showed air in the local venous system. Balloon kyphoplasty is associated with the fluoroscopically invisible introduction of air into the vertebral and paravertebral veins and deep systemic veins and is likely to be much more extensive than identified on CT imaging. There is potential for serious air embolism in kyphoplasty and if there is a sudden deterioration in patient condition during the procedure the possibility of this complication needs to be considered.\n\nPercutaneous anterolateral balloon kyphoplasty for metastatic lytic lesions of the cervical spine\n\nPubMed Central\n\nAnagnostidis, Kleovoulos S.; AlZeer, Ziad; Kapetanos, George A.\n\n2010-01-01\n\nThe purpose of our report is to describe a new application of kyphoplasty, the percutaneous anterolateral balloon kyphoplasty that we performed in two cases of metastatic osteolytic lesions in cervical spine. The first patient, aged 48Â years, with primary malignancy in lungs had two metastatic lesions in C2 and C6 vertebrae. Patientâs complaints were about pain and restriction of movements (due to the pain) in the cervical spine. The second patient, aged 70Â years, with primary malignancy in stomach, had multiple metastatic lesions in thoracolumbar spine and C3, C4 and C5 vertebrae without neurological symptoms. The main symptoms were from cervical spine with severe pain even in bed rest and systematic use of opiate-base analgesis. The preoperative status was evaluated with X-rays, CT scan, MRI scan and with Karnofsky score and visual analogue pain (VAS) scale. Both patients underwent percutaneous anterolateral balloon kyphoplasty via the anterolateral approach in cervical spine under general anaesthesia. No clinical complications occurred during or after the procedure. Both patients experienced pain relief immediately after balloon kyphoplasty and during the following days. The stiffness also resolved rapidly and cervical collars were removed. VAS score significantly improved from 85 and 95 preoperatively to 30 in both patients. Karnofsky score showed also improvement from 40 and 30 preoperatively to 80 and 70, respectively, at the final follow-up (7Â months after the procedure). Fluoroscopy-guided percutaneous anterolateral ballon kyphoplasty proved to be safe and effective minimally invasive procedure for metastatic osteolytic lesions of the cervical spine, reducing pain and avoiding vertebral collapse. Experience and attention are necessary in order to avoid complications.

Long lasting pain and deformity is responsible for consecutive impairment with markedly reduced life quality, increased morbidity and mortality. The beneficial effects of balloon kyphoplasty are verified in many studies. Subsequent fracture risk is not finally clarified, cement related risks and deformity related risks are discussed. There is less knowledge about the risk of bone marrow edema and new fractures during balloon kyphoplasty procedure. The goal of this study is to examine, if prone position during kyphoplasty is an independent risk factor for new fractures in the osteoporotic spine. Methods: Consecutive MRI study of 20 patients with fresh, non-traumatic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures and balloon kyphoplasty treatment. MRI Scans of the thoracolumbar spine were obtained after surgery, before patients have been mobilized. Specific MRI changes like new bone marrow edema, signal intensity changes in adjacent and remote segments and new fractures were assessed by specialized neuro-radiologist. Results: 20 MR images were examined within 48 hours after balloon kyphoplasty procedure. 85% did not show bone marrow edema extent changes after kyphoplasty. We found minor increase of bone marrow edema within the augmented vertebral body in 3 cases. We did not find any new bone marrow edema and no new fractures in adjacent and remote segments after balloon kyphoplasty treatment. Conclusion: Prone position leads to no new bone marrow edema and no new fractures in the osteoporotic spine. Accordingly, prone position has no risk for adjacent level fractures in osteoporotic spines.

Percutaneous balloon kyphoplasty (BKP) is a variation of this approach, in which an inflatable balloon tamp is placed in the collapsed vertebra prior to cement injection. To systematically evaluate and appraise the clinical effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of PVP and percutaneous BKP in reducing pain and disability in people with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) in England and Wales. A systematic review was carried out. Ten databases including MEDLINE and CINAHL were searched from inception to November 2011, and supplemented by hand-searching relevant articles and contact with an expert. Studies met the inclusion criteria if they were randomised controlled trials (RCTs) including people with painful osteoporotic VCFs with a group receiving PVP or BKP. In addition, lead authors of identified RCTs were contacted for unpublished data. Primary outcomes were health-related quality of life; back-specific functional status/mobility; pain/analgesic use; vertebral body height and angular deformity; incidence of new vertebral fractures and progression of treated fracture. A manufacturer provided academic-in-confidence observational data indicating that vertebral augmentation may be associated with a beneficial mortality effect, and that, potentially, BKP was more efficacious than PVP. These data were formally critiqued. A mathematical model was constructed to explore the cost-effectiveness of BKP, PVP and operative placebo with local anaesthesia (OPLA) compared with optimal pain management (OPM). Six scenario analyses were conducted that assessed combinations of assumptions on mortality (differential beneficial effects for BKP and PVP; equal beneficial effects for BKP and PVP; and no effect assumed) and derivation of utility data (either mapped from visual analogue scale pain score data produced by a network meta\n\nHeight restoration of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using different intravertebral reduction devices: a cadaveric study.\n\nPubMed\n\nKrÃ¼ger, Antonio; Oberkircher, Ludwig; Figiel, Jens; FloÃdorf, Felix; Bolzinger, Florent; Noriega, David C; Ruchholtz, Steffen\n\n2015-05-01\n\nThe treatment of osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures using transpedicular cement augmentation has grown significantly during the past two decades. Balloon kyphoplasty was developed to restore vertebral height and improve sagittal alignment. Several studies have shown these theoretical improvements cannot be transferred universally to the clinical setting. The aim of the current study is to evaluate two different procedures used for percutaneous augmentation of vertebral compression fractures with respect to height restoration: balloon kyphoplasty and SpineJack. Twenty-four vertebral bodies of two intact, fresh human cadaveric spines (T6-L5; donor age, 70 years and 60 years; T-score -6.8 points and -6.3 points) were scanned using computed tomography (CT) and dissected into single vertebral bodies. Vertebral wedge compression fractures were created by a material testing machine (Universal testing machine, Instron 5566, Darmstadt, Germany). The axial load was increased continuously until the height of the anterior edge of the vertebral body was reduced by 40% of the initial measured values. After 15 minutes, the load was decreased manually to 100 N. After postfracture CT, the clamped vertebral bodies were placed in a custom-made loading frame with a preload of 100 N. Twelve vertebral bodies were treated using SpineJack (SJ; Vexim, Balma, France), the 12 remaining vertebral bodies were treated with balloon kyphoplasty (BKP; Kyphon, Medtronic, Sunnyvale, CA, USA). The load was maintained during the procedure until the cement set completely. Posttreatment CT was performed. Anterior, central, and posterior height as well as the Beck index were measured prefracture and postfracture as well as after treatment. For anterior height restoration (BKP, 0.14Â±1.48 mm; SJ, 3.34Â±1.19 mm), central height restoration (BKP, 0.91Â±1.04 mm; SJ, 3.24Â±1.22 mm), and posterior restoration (BKP, 0.37Â±0.57 mm; SJ, 1.26Â±1.05), as well as the Beck index (BKP, 0.00Â±0.06 mm; SJ, 0\n\nCavitational kyphoplasty: a new technique for reducing the rates of cement extravasation through targeted low-pressure cement injection.\n\nPubMed\n\nMattei, Tobias A\n\n2017-06-01\n\nPrevious studies have demonstrated lower rates of cement extravasation when comparing balloon kyphoplasty with vertebroplasty, an effect attributed to the low-pressure injection. However, in patients with isolated endplate fractures, balloon kyphoplasty may lead to further endplate damage and increased risks of intradiscal extravasation. The author provides a stepwise description of a new technique called cavitational kyphoplasty that allows targeted low-pressure cement injection without the necessity of balloon inflation. The new technique of cavitational kyphoplasty has been shown to be specially useful in patients with isolated endplate fractures without significant loss of the vertebral body height.\n\nKyphoplasty with purified silicone VK100 (Elastoplasty) to treat spinal lytic lesions in cancer patients: A retrospective evaluation of 41 cases.\n\nPubMed\n\nTelera, Stefano; Pompili, Alfredo; Crispo, Francesco; Giovannetti, Maddalena; Pace, Andrea; Villani, Veronica; Fabi, Alessandra; Sperduti, Isabella; Raus, Laura\n\n2018-06-15\n\nBalloon Kyphoplasty (BKP) for vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) in cancer patients is more challenging than for osteoporotic ones. Cord compressions are frequent and the incidence of complications ten-fold greater. Polymethylmetacrylate (PMMA) is the gold standard material for BKP but has disadvantages: exothermic reaction, short working time, rapid solidification, absence of osteoconduction. VK100 is a mixture of Dimethyl Methylvinyl siloxane and Barium Sulphate. It is elastic, adhesive to bone, leaves 30â¯min before solidification without exothermic reaction, and shows a stiffness close to the intact vertebrae. The surgical procedure, called elastoplasty, is similar to a BKP. Clinical results obtained with this new silicone in pathological VCFs have been investigated. 41 cancer patients with symptomatic VCFs (70 vertebral bodies), underwent percutaneous and open elastoplasties. Post-operative leakages, pulmonary embolism (PE) and adjacent fractures were carefully evaluated with neuroimaging. KPS, VAS and Dennis Pain Score were calculated pre- post-operatively and at the last follow-up. The mean volume of silicone inserted in each vertebra was 3.8 cc. Complications included seven leakages (17%), two asymptomatic PE (4.3%) and 3 post-operative adjacent fractures (7.3%). Median follow-up was 29 months. A significant improvement was observed in KPS, VAS and Dennis Pain Score (pâ¯<â¯.0001). The 1-yr survival rate was 76.9%. Elastoplasty appears a safe and effective palliative treatment of VCFs in oncologic patients. Useful qualities of VK100 are the lack of exothermic reaction and the wider working window. The influence of biomechanical properties of silicone on reduction of adjacent level fractures requires further investigations. Copyright Â© 2018.

The aim of this study was the evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of radiofrequency-targeted vertebral augmentation (RF-TVA) in comparison with balloon kyphoplasty (BK) for the treatment of acute painful vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) on the basis of matched pairs. Vertebroplasty and BK are the common surgical interventions for the treatment of VCF. Both are effective and safe but pose some risks such as adjacent fractures and cement leakage. In 2009, RF-TVA was introduced as an innovative augmentation procedure for the treatment of VCF. A total of 192 patients (116 female; 51-90 y) with VCF (n=303) at 1 to 3 levels were treated with RF-TVA or BK. Functionality (Oswestry Disability Index), pain (visual analogue scale), vertebral height (anterior, middle), and kyphotic angle were evaluated over a 2-year period (postoperatively, 3-4 d, 3, 6, 12, and 24 mo). In addition, operating time and occurrence of cement leakage were recorded. Pain and functionality were significantly improved after both treatments. In both groups, there was an increase in the vertebral height and a decrease in the kyphotic angle, which remained relatively consistent during 24 months. The incidence of cement leakage was 9.4% (n=9) in the RF-TVA group and 24.0% (n=25) in the BK group. The mean operating time with radiofrequency kyphoplasty was 25.9Â±9.9 minutes, and with balloon kyphoplasty 48.0Â±18.4 minutes. RF-TVA is a safe and effective procedure for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures when compared with BK. Improvement in pain and functional scores after RF-TVA are durable through 24 months postprocedure and remained better than those after BK at long-term follow-up. Operating time for RF-TVA is shorter and the risk of cement leakage is lower. Both procedures provided similar results in vertebral height restoration and reduction in the kyphotic angle.\n\n[Clinical cost analysis of balloon kyphoplasty--is there a possibility of cost-covering treatment?].\n\nPubMed\n\nChmielnicki, M; McDougall, A M; Prokop, A\n\n2014-06-01\n\nFinancial pressure on hospitals has been a major issue in the health care system of the past years and the financial situation is often what decides about the future of the hospitals. Therefore today the economic feasibility of patient treatment in hospitals is more important than ever before. After the degradation of the case-based lump sum of I09D to I09F on a one and two level kyphoplasty we took that as motivation to do a cost analysis on 10 randomised cases. The average age of the patients was 75 years (mâ:âfâ=â2â:â8), the average stay in hospital was 8 days (3-12âd). The analysis was done by a searching of documents in cooperation with the firm GFG-Beratungsgesellschaft mbH (MÃ¶nchengladbach, Germany). We found that the average overall cost which includes the cost of hospital stay and the expenditure on material was 7512.53ââ¬ and the average earnings of the cases was 7610,97ââ¬, the difference and in that way the proceeds was 98.44ââ¬. On that result performance of a one-level kyphoplasty especially after the degradation of the case-based lump sum in 2013 is possible in a cost-covering way, an increase in profit may be possible by a decrement of hospital stay. In 2014 one- and two-stage kyphoplasty once underwent a reduction of G-DRG from I09F to I09E. At the same time the cost weight of lump compensation I09E was increased by 0.071 with the result that in 2014, with an increased federal base value of 3156.82ââ¬ (in 2013 the federal base rate value was 3068.37ââ¬), additional proceeds of 404,92ââ¬ can be realised in the field of one- and two-stage kyphoplasty compared to in 2013. On that result a one-level kyphoplasty especially after the degradation of the case-based lump sum in 2013 and in 2014 is possible in a cost-covering manner, an increase in profit may be possible by a decrement of hospital stay.

After this, we give the gauge transformation of this commutative multicomponent BKP (CMBKP) hierarchy. Meanwhile, we construct a new constrained CMBKP hierarchy that contains some new integrable systems, including coupled KdV equations under a certain reduction. After this, the quantum torus symmetry and quantum torus constraint on the tau function of the commutative multi-component BKP hierarchy will be constructed.\n\nAcrylic kyphoplasty in recent nonosteoporotic fractures of the thoracolumbar junction: a prospective clinical and 3D radiologic study of 54 patients.\n\nPubMed\n\nSaget, Mathieu; Teyssedou, Simon; Prebet, Remi; Vendeuvre, Tanguy; Gayet, Louis-Etienne; Pries, Pierre\n\n2014-08-01\n\nProspective clinical and radiological study. To evaluate the impact of stand-alone acrylic kyphoplasty in the treatment of recent traumatic fractures of the thoracolumbar spine in young patients. The management of fractures of the thoracolumbar spine without neurological deficit remains controversial. For a long time clinicians could only chose between functional treatment, orthopedic treatment, and traditional surgery. The recent advent of minimally invasive surgical techniques is an interesting alternative. Fifty-four patients with a mean age of 45.8Â±18.2 years and who had recently sustained a fracture of the thoracolumbar junction were enrolled into the study. Balloon kyphoplasty was performed using acrylic cement. Radiologic assessments (computed tomography scans) and clinical assessments (including Visual Analog Scale and Oswestry Disability Index scores) were used to determine kyphoplasty success and measure patient recovery over 2 years. Kyphoplasty reduced mean vertebral kyphosis from 12.8Â±5.0 degrees at trauma to 8.2Â±5.1 degrees at 2-year follow-up. Mean vertebral kyphosis was corrected by -5.7Â±4.7 degrees (P=0.0001) at the point of first verticalization, with no significant change at the 2-year follow-up visit (+1.1Â±4.3 degrees, P=0.1058). Kyphoplasty significantly augmented the height of the 6 anterior and intermediate segments. Maximum mean augmentation of intermediate vertebral height after 6 months was (11.6%Â±15.5%, P<0.0001). Patients tolerated the procedure well and 56% of them returned to work 3 months after kyphoplasty. Kyphoplasty is safe and effective in the correction of nonosteoporotic fractures of the thoracolumbar junction in young patients, and remains stable for at least 2 years postsurgery.\n\nElastoplasty: A Silicon Polymer as a New Filling Material for Kyphoplasty in Comparison to PMMA.\n\nPubMed\n\nBornemann, Rahel; Rommelspacher, Yorck; Jansen, Tom R; Sander, Kirsten; Wirtz, Dieter C; Pflugmacher, Robert\n\n2016-07-01\n\nPainful vertebral compression fractures (VCF) caused by osteoporosis are a common health problem in the elderly population. If conservative treatments are unsuccessful, surgical treatments like vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty are recommended. But the use of Polymethylmethacrylat (PMMA) bone cement for augmentation surgery is associated with risks. Evaluation of the effectiveness and safety of a newly developed silicon polymer (VK100) that can be used instead of PMMA bone cement for kyphoplasty treatments. A retrospective study of 30 patients comparing the outcomes of kyphoplasty treatments conducted with PMMA and VK100. Clinic for Orthopedics and Trauma Surgery Bonn, Germany. Thirty patients with one to 3 VCF were treated either with balloon kyphoplasty using VK100 or balloon kyphoplasty using PMMA bone cement. Data from both groups was compared by a matched pair analysis. The medial vertebral height was measured at each examination radiologically. The patients stated their pain intensity using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) and the patient's functional impairment was evaluated with the Oswestry-Disability-Index (ODI).All data were assessed before surgery, and 3 days, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months after surgery. Intraoperative and postoperative adverse events were documented. The patients' functional impairment and pain improved significantly after surgery. The course of ODI and VAS was comparable in both treatment groups, but the improvement in the VK group was significantly ongoing until the 12 month follow-up. Vertebral height improvement was significant in both groups, but the PMMA group achieved a better absolute restoration. The vertebral height stayed constant during the follow-up in the VK group and worsened significantly in the PMMA group. There was no significant difference between groups concerning the occurrence of additional fractures; and no other types of complications or surgery-related adverse events were observed in either the PMMA group or in\n\nRadiologic study of disc behavior following compression fracture of the thoracolumbar hinge managed by kyphoplasty: A 52-case series.\n\nPubMed\n\nTeyssÃ©dou, S; Saget, M; Gayet, L E; Pries, P; BrÃ¨que, C; Vendeuvre, T\n\n2016-02-01\n\nKyphoplasty has proved effective for durable correction of traumatic vertebral deformity following Magerl A fracture, but subsequent behavior of the adjacent discs is unclear. The objective of the present study was to analyze evolution according to severity of initial kyphosis and quality of fracture reduction. A single-center prospective study included cases of single compression fracture of the thoracolumbar hinge managed by Kyphon Balloon Kyphoplasty with polymethylmethacrylate bone cement. Radiology focused on traumatic vertebral kyphosis (VK), disc angulation (DA) and disc height index (DHI) in the adjacent discs. Linear regression assessed the correlation between superior disc height index (SupDHI) and postoperative VK on the one hand and correction gain on the other, using the Student t test for matched pairs and Pearson correlation coefficient. Fifty-two young patients were included, with mean follow-up of 18.6Â months. VK fell from 13.9Â° preoperatively to 8.2Â° at last follow-up. DHI found significant superior disc subsidence (P=0.0001) and non-significant inferior disc subsidence (P=0.116). DA showed significantly reduced superior disc lordosis (P=4*10(-5)). SupDHI correlated with VK correction (r=0.32). Preoperative VK did not correlate with radiologic degeneration of the adjacent discs. Correction of traumatic vertebral deformity avoids subsidence and loss of mechanical function in the superior adjacent disc. The underlying disc compensates for residual deformity. Balloon kyphoplasty is useful in compression fracture, providing significant reduction of traumatic vertebral deformity while conserving free and healthy adjacent discs. IV.

To evaluate the safety and efficacy of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty using the data presented in published clinical studies, with respect to patient pain relief, restoration of mobility and vertebral body height, complication rate, and incidence of new adjacent vertebral fractures. Vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been gaining popularity for treating vertebral fractures. Current reviews provide an overview of the procedures but are not comprehensive and tend to rely heavily on personal experience. This article aimed to compile all available data and evaluate the clinical outcome of the 2 procedures. This is a systematic review of all the available data presented in peer-reviewed published clinical trials. The methodological quality of included studies was evaluated, and data were collected targeting specific standard measurements. Where possible, a quantitative aggregation of the data was performed. A large proportion of subjects had some pain relief, including 87% with vertebroplasty and 92% with kyphoplasty. Vertebral height restoration was possible using kyphoplasty (average 6.6 degrees ) and for a subset of patients using vertebroplasty (average 6.6 degrees ). Cement leaks occurred for 41% and 9% of treated vertebrae for vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, respectively. New fractures of adjacent vertebrae occurred for both procedures at rates that are higher than the general osteoporotic population but approximately equivalent to the general osteoporotic population that had a previous vertebral fracture. The problem with stating definitely that vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are safe and effective procedures is the lack of comparative, blinded, randomized clinical trials. Standardized evaluative methods should be adopted.\n\nWhich is best for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: balloon kyphoplasty, percutaneous vertebroplasty or non-surgical treatment? A study protocol for a Bayesian network meta-analysis\n\nPubMed Central\n\nKan, Shun-Li; Yuan, Zhi-Fang; Chen, Ling-Xiao; Sun, Jing-Cheng; Ning, Guang-Zhi; Feng, Shi-Qing\n\n2017-01-01\n\nIntroduction Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) commonly cause both acute and chronic back pain, substantial spinal deformity, functional disability and decreased quality of life and increase the risk of future vertebral fractures and mortality. Percutaneous vertebroplasty (PVP), balloon kyphoplasty (BK) and non-surgical treatment (NST) are mostly used for the treatment of OVCFs. However, which treatment is preferred is unknown. The purpose of this study is to comprehensively review the literature and ascertain the relative efficacy and safety of BK, PVP and NST for patients with OVCFs using a Bayesian network meta-analysis. Methods and analysis We will comprehensively search PubMed, EMBASE and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, to include randomided controlled trials that compare BK, PVP or NST for treating OVCFs. The risk of bias for individual studies will be assessed according to the Cochrane Handbook. Bayesian network meta-analysis will be performed to compare the efficacy and safety of BK, PVP and NST. The quality of evidence will be evaluated by GRADE. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval and patient consent are not required since this study is a meta-analysis based on published studies. The results of this network meta-analysis will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for publication. PROSPERO registration number CRD42016039452; Pre-results.

The files of the patients who underwent vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebrae fractures were retrieved from the archives. Forty-three patients with complete follow-up data were included in the study group. The patients were evaluated for radiological outcomes in terms of local kyphosis angle, wedging index, compression ratio, visual analog pain scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). In the study group, kyphoplasty was performed on 24 vertebrae of 22 patients (17 females, 5 males; mean age: 73 years) whereas vertebroplasty was applied on 24 vertebrae of 21 (16 females, 5 males; mean age: 74.7 years) patients. The mean follow-up time was 26 months. When the VAS and ODI values of the groups were analyzed, both groups showed statistically significant progress after the operation. Radiological data showed that the kyphoplasty group showed statistically significant improvement in the sagittal index values whereas the vertebroplasty group did not. The overall complication ratio was 4%. Both vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty are effective treatment methods for functional recovery and pain relief in osteoporotic fractures of the vertebra. Although radiological outcomes of the kyphoplasty seem to be better, this does not have any clinical relevance. We suggest vertebroplasty over kyphoplasty since it is an easier method to manage.

We describe an effective and controlled intra-articular ankle distraction technique that we have studied by means of a fresh-frozen cadaver model. Using a kyphoplasty balloon, which is currently used in spine surgery, we tried to achieve a controlled distraction. After the fixation of the cadaver model, standard anteromedial and anterolateral portals were used for ankle arthroscopy. From the same portals, the kyphoplasty balloon was inserted and placed in an appropriate position intra-articularly. The necessary amount of distraction was achieved by inflating the kyphoplasty balloon with a pressure regulation pump. All anatomic sites of the ankle joint were easily visualized with the arthroscope during surgery by changing the pressure and the intra-articular position of the kyphoplasty balloon. Ankle distraction was clearly seen on the arthroscopic and image intensifier view. The kyphoplasty balloon is simple to place through the standard portals and the advantage is that it allows easy manipulation of the arthroscopic instruments from the same portal.\n\nClinical outcome and subsequent sequelae of cement extravasation after percutaneous kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty: a comparative review.\n\nPubMed\n\nSemaan, Hassan; Obri, Tawfik; Bazerbashi, Mohamad; Paull, Daniel; Liu, Xiaochen; Sarrouj, Marah; Elgafy, Hossein\n\n2018-07-01\n\nBackground Injection of cement during vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty can leak into surrounding structures and could be symptomatic. Purpose To identify the sites and incidence of cement extravasation after kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty, and to evaluate their impacts on clinical outcomes. Material and Methods A retrospective review of 316 patients treated with kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty; 411 cases were included (223 kyphoplasty and 188 vertebroplasty). Cement extravasation was evaluated postoperatively by computed tomography (CT) scan of the spine. Clinical outcomes were assessed by visual analog scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Results There was a statistically significant difference in the incidence rate of cement extravasation between vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty groups ( Pâ<â0.04). The most common site of cement extravasation was in paravertebral soft tissues for vertebroplasty (nâ=â33, 40.7%) and for kyphoplasty (nâ=â30, 30%). In the subgroup where cement leaked into the intradiscal space, adjacent vertebral body fractures occurred in 3/26 vertebrae (11.5%) in the vertebroplasty group and in 2/18 vertebrae (11.1%) in the kyphoplasty group. Both groups showed a statistically significant decrease in both VAS ( Pâ<â0.001) and ODI scores ( Pâ<â0.001). There was no significantly difference in patient satisfaction between those who had cement extravasation and those who did not, in both groups. Conclusion Kyphoplasty has an advantage in terms of less risk of cement extravasation. However, this factor did not reflect on subsequent sequelae or final clinical outcomes. This study did not find a distinct correlation between intradiscal cement extravasation and increased risk of adjacent vertebral fractures.\n\nInteraction phenomenon to dimensionally reduced p-gBKP equation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nZhang, Runfa; Bilige, Sudao; Bai, Yuexing; LÃ¼, Jianqing; Gao, Xiaoqing\n\n2018-02-01\n\nBased on searching the combining of quadratic function and exponential (or hyperbolic cosine) function from the Hirota bilinear form of the dimensionally reduced p-gBKP equation, eight class of interaction solutions are derived via symbolic computation with Mathematica. The submergence phenomenon, presented to illustrate the dynamical features concerning these obtained solutions, is observed by three-dimensional plots and density plots with particular choices of the involved parameters between the exponential (or hyperbolic cosine) function and the quadratic function. It is proved that the interference between the two solitary waves is inelastic.\n\nHealth economic aspects of vertebral augmentation procedures.\n\nPubMed\n\nBorgstrÃ¶m, F; Beall, D P; Berven, S; Boonen, S; Christie, S; Kallmes, D F; Kanis, J A; Olafsson, G; Singer, A J; Ã kesson, K\n\n2015-04-01\n\nWe reviewed all peer-reviewed papers analysing the cost-effectiveness of vertebroplasty and balloon kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. In general, the procedures appear to be cost effective but are very dependent upon model input details. Better data, rather than new models, are needed to answer outstanding questions. Vertebral augmentation procedures (VAPs), including vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BKP), seek to stabilise fractured vertebral bodies and reduce pain. The aim of this paper is to review current literature on the cost-effectiveness of VAPs as well as to discuss the challenges for economic evaluation in this research area. A systematic literature search was conducted to identify existing published studies on the cost-effectiveness of VAPs in patients with osteoporosis. Only peer-reviewed published articles that fulfilled the criteria of being regarded as full economic evaluations including both morbidity and mortality in the outcome measure in the form of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) were included. The search identified 949 studies, of which four (0.4 %) were identified as relevant with one study added later. The reviewed studies differed widely in terms of study design, modelling framework and data used, yielding different results and conclusions regarding the cost-effectiveness of VAPs. Three out of five studies indicated in the base case results that VAPs were cost effective compared to non-surgical management (NSM). The five main factors that drove the variations in the cost-effectiveness between the studies were time horizon, quality of life effect of treatment, offset time of the treatment effect, reduced number of bed days associated with VAPs and mortality benefit with treatment. The cost-effectiveness of VAPs is uncertain. In answering the remaining questions, new cost-effectiveness analysis will yield limited benefit. Rather, studies that can reduce the uncertainty in the underlying data\n\nVertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: An Economic Analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\n2016-01-01\n\nUntreated vertebral compression fractures can have serious clinical consequences and impose a considerable impact on patients' quality of life and on caregivers. Since non-surgical management of these fractures has limited effectiveness, vertebral augmentation procedures are gaining acceptance in clinical practice for pain control and fracture stabilization. The objective of this analysis was to determine the cost-effectiveness and budgetary impact of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in patients with cancer. We performed a systematic review of health economic studies to identify relevant studies that compare the cost-effectiveness of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty with non-surgical management for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures in adults with cancer. We also performed a primary cost-effectiveness analysis to assess the clinical benefits and costs of kyphoplasty or vertebroplasty compared with non-surgical management in the same population. We developed a Markov model to forecast benefits and harms of treatments, and corresponding quality-adjusted life years and costs. Clinical data and utility data were derived from published sources, while costing data were derived using Ontario administrative sources. We performed sensitivity analyses to examine the robustness of the results. In addition, a 1-year budget impact analysis was performed using data from Ontario administrative sources. Two scenarios were explored: (a) an increase in the total number of vertebral augmentation procedures performed among patients with cancer in Ontario, maintaining the current proportion of kyphoplasty versus vertebroplasty; and (b) no increase in the total number of vertebral augmentation procedures performed among patients with cancer in Ontario but an increase in the proportion of kyphoplasties versus vertebroplasties.

Various vertebral augmentation options including kyphoplasty aim at preventing the sequelae of pain and immobility that can develop as the result of the vertebral fractures. The mechanism for pain relief following kyphoplasty is not entirely understood, and the restoration of a portion of the lost vertebral height is a subject of debate. We retrospectively reviewed radiographic imaging, pain relief, analgesic intake and functional outcomes in 67 consecutive patients who underwent single- or multilevel kyphoplasty with the primary goal of quantifying the restoration of lost vertebral height. We observed a mean of 45% of the lost vertebral height restored postprocedurally. Secondarily, kyphoplasty was associated with significant decreases in pain scores, daily morphine consumption and improvement in patient-reported functional measures.

As is known, matrix integrals over a Gaussian ensemble used in random matrix theory could act as the Ï-function of several hierarchies of integrable systems. In this article, we will show that the time-dependent partition function of the Bures ensemble, whose measure has many interesting geometric properties, could act as the Ï-function of BKP and DKP hierarchies. In addition, if discrete time variables are introduced, then this partition function could act as the Ï-function of discrete BKP and DKP hierarchies. In particular, there are some links between the partition function of the Bures ensemble and Toda-type equations.\n\nKyphoplasty vs conservative treatment: a case-control study in 110 post-menopausal women population. Is kyphoplasty better than conservative treatment?\n\nPubMed\n\nColangelo, D; Nasto, L A; Genitiempo, M; Formica, V M; Autore, G; Pambianco, V; Tamburrelli, F C; Cerulli, G; Pola, E\n\n2015-11-01\n\nOsteoporosis is a highly prevalent disease worldwide. Consequences of vertebral osteoporotic fractures include pain and progressive vertebral collapse resulting in spinal kyphosis, decreased quality of life, disability and mortality. Minimally invasive procedures represent an advance to the treatment of osteoporotic VCFs. Despite encouraging results reported by many authors, surgical intervention in an osteoporotic spine is fraught with difficulties. Advanced patients age and comorbidities are of great concern. We designed a retrospective case-control study on 110 post-menopausal women consecutively visited at our institution. Study population was split in a surgical and a conservative cohort, according to the provided treatment. Kyphoplasty treated patients had lower back pain VAS scores at 1 month as compared with conservatively treated patients (p < 0.05). EQ5D validated questionnaire also showed a better quality of life at 1 month for surgically treated patients (p < 0.05). SF-12 scores showed greater improvements at 1 month and 3 months with statistically significant difference between the two groups just at 3 months (p < 0.05). At 12 months, scores from all scales were not statistically different between the two cohorts, although surgically treated patients showed better trends than conservatively treated patients in pain and quality of life. Kyphoplasty was able to restore more than 54.55% of the original segmental kyphosis, whereas patients in conservative cohort lost 6.67% of the original segmental kyphosis on average. Kyphoplasty is a modern minimal invasive surgery, allowing faster recovery than bracing treatment. It can avoid the deformity in kyphosis due to VCF. In fact, the risk to develop a new vertebral fracture after the first one is very high.\n\nSafety and utility of kyphoplasty prior to spine stereotactic radiosurgery for metastatic tumors: a clinical and dosimetric analysis.\n\nPubMed\n\nBarzilai, Ori; DiStefano, Natalie; Lis, Eric; Yamada, Yoshiya; Lovelock, D Michael; Fontanella, Andrew N; Bilsky, Mark H; Laufer, Ilya\n\n2018-01-01\n\nOBJECTIVE The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of kyphoplasty treatment prior to spine stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) in patients with spine metastases. METHODS A retrospective review of charts, radiology reports, and images was performed for all patients who received SRS (single fraction; either standalone or post-kyphoplasty) at a large tertiary cancer center between January 2012 and July 2015. Patient and tumor variables were documented, as well as treatment planning data and dosimetry. To measure the photon scatter due to polymethyl methacrylate, megavolt photon beam attenuation was determined experimentally as it passed through a kyphoplasty cement phantom. Corrected electron density values were recalculated and compared with uncorrected values. RESULTS Of 192 treatment levels in 164 unique patients who underwent single-fraction SRS, 17 (8.8%) were treated with kyphoplasty prior to radiation delivery to the index level. The median time from kyphoplasty to SRS was 22 days. Four of 192 treatments (2%) demonstrated local tumor recurrence or progression at the time of analysis. Of the 4 local failures, 1 patient had kyphoplasty prior to SRS. This recurrence occurred 18 months after SRS in the setting of widespread systemic disease and spinal tumor progression. Dosimetric review demonstrated a lower than average treatment dose for this case compared with the rest of the cohort. There were no significant differences in dosimetry analysis between the group of patients who underwent kyphoplasty prior to SRS and the remaining patients in the cohort. A preliminary analysis of polymethyl methacrylate showed that dosimetric errors due to uncorrected electron density values were insignificant. CONCLUSIONS In cases without epidural spinal cord compression, stabilization with cement augmentation prior to SRS is safe and does not alter the efficacy of the radiation or preclude physicians from adhering to SRS planning and contouring guidelines.\n\nVertebral Augmentation Involving Vertebroplasty or Kyphoplasty for Cancer-Related Vertebral Compression Fractures: A Systematic Review\n\nPubMed Central\n\nPron, Gaylene; Holubowich, Corinne; Kaulback, Kellee\n\n2016-01-01\n\nBackground Cancers that metastasize to the spine and primary cancers such as multiple myeloma can result in vertebral compression fractures or instability. Conservative strategies, including bed rest, bracing, and analgesic use, can be ineffective, resulting in continued pain and progressive functional disability limiting mobility and self-care.

The objectives of this review were to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of percutaneous image-guided vertebral augmentation techniques, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty, for palliation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures. Methods We performed a systematic literature search for studies on vertebral augmentation of cancer-related vertebral compression fractures published from January 1, 2000, to October 2014; abstracts were screened by a single reviewer. For those studies meeting the eligibility criteria, full-text articles were obtained.

Vertebral augmentation procedures including vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty have been supported as means of reducing pain and mitigating disability associated with these fractures. However, use of vertebroplasty is debated, with negative randomized controlled trials published in 2009 and divergent clinical guidelines. The effect of changing evidence and guidelines on different practitioners' utilization of both kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty in the years after these developments and publication of data supporting their use is poorly understood. Using national aggregate Medicare claims data from 2002 through 2014, vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty procedures were identified by provider type. Changes in utilization by procedure type and provider were studied. Total vertebroplasty billing increased 101.6% from 2001 (18,911) through 2008 (38,123). Total kyphoplasty billing frequency increased 17.2% from 2006 (54,329) through 2008 (63,684). Vertebroplasty billing decreased 60.9% from 2008 through 2014 to its lowest value (14,898). Kyphoplasty billing decreased 8.4% from 2008 (63,684) through 2010 (58,346), but then increased 7.6% from 2010 to 2013 (62,804). Vertebroplasty billing decreased substantially beginning in 2009 and continued to decrease through 2014 despite publication of more favorable studies in 2010 to 2012, suggesting studies published in 2009 and AAOS guidelines in 2010 may have had a persistent negative effect. Kyphoplasty did not decrease as substantially and increased in more recent years, suggesting a clinical practice response to favorable studies published during this period.

Current surgical approaches for the treatment of VCF include vertebroplasty (VP) and balloon kyphoplasty (BK). The KivaÂ® VCF Treatment System (Kiva System) is a next-generation alternative surgical intervention in which a percutaneously introduced nitinol Osteo Coil guidewire is advanced through a deployment cannula and subsequently a PEEK Implant is implanted incrementally and fully coiled in the vertebral body. The Kiva System's effectiveness for the treatment of VCF has been evaluated in a large randomized controlled trial, the Kiva Safety and Effectiveness Trial (KAST). The Kiva System was non-inferior to BK with respect to pain reduction (70.8% vs. 71.8% in Visual Analogue Scale) and physical function restoration (38.1 % vs. 42.2% reduction in Oswestry Disability Index) while using less bone cement. The economic impact of the Kiva system has yet to be analyzed. To analyze hospital resource use and costs of the Kiva System over 2 years for the treatment of VCF compared to BK. A representative US hospital. Economic analysis of the KAST randomized trial, focusing on hospital resource use and costs. The analysis was conducted from a hospital perspective and utilized clinical data from KAST as well as unit-cost data from the published literature. The cost of initial VCF surgery, reoperation cost, device market cost, and other medical costs were compared between the Kiva System and BK. The relative risk reduction rate in adjacent-level fracture with Kiva [31.6% (95% CI: -22.5%, 61.9%)] demonstrated in KAST was used in this analysis. With 304 vertebral augmentation procedures performed in a representative U.S. hospital over 2 years, the Kiva System will produce a direct medical cost savings of $1,118 per patient and $280,876 per hospital. This cost saving with the Kiva\n\nKyphoplasty for vertebral augmentation in the elderly with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: scenarios and review of recent studies.\n\nPubMed\n\nBednar, Timothy; Heyde, Christoph E; Bednar, Grace; Nguyen, David; Volpi, Elena; Przkora, Rene\n\n2013-11-01\n\nVertebral compression fractures caused by osteoporosis are among the most common fractures in the elderly. The treatment focuses on pain control, maintenance of independence, and management of the osteoporosis. Elderly patients often encounter adverse effects to pain medications, do not tolerate bed rest, and are not ideal candidates for invasive spinal reconstructive surgery. Percutaneous vertebral augmentation (vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty) has become popular as a less-invasive alternative. However, studies have questioned the effectiveness of these procedures. The authors conducted a MEDLINE search using relevant search terms including osteoporosis, osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, elderly, kyphoplasty and vertebroplasty. Two elderly patients presented with a fracture of their third and first lumbar vertebral body, respectively. One patient progressed well with conservative treatment, whereas the other patient was hospitalized secondary to pain after conservative measures failed to offer improvement. The hospitalized patient subsequently opted for a kyphoplasty and was able to resume his normal daily activities after the procedure. Selecting patients on an individual case-by-case basis can optimize the effectiveness and outcomes of a vertebral augmentation. This process includes the documentation of an osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture with the aide of imaging studies, including the acuity of the fracture as well as the correlation with the physical examination findings. Patients who are functional and improving under a conservative regimen are not candidates for kyphoplasty. However, if the conservative management is not successful after 4 to 6 weeks and the patient is at risk to become bedridden, an augmentation should be considered. A kyphoplasty procedure may be preferred over vertebroplasty, given the lower risk profile and better outcomes regarding spinal alignment.

A special form available since 2009 is the radiofrequency kyphoplasty (RF) in which the applied energy raises the viscosity of the cement. The aim of this study is to find out if a smaller cement amount in radiofrequency kyphoplasty can also restore vertebral body height in osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. The treatment was minimally invasive using the StabiliTÂ® vertebral augmentation system by DFine. In a retrospective study from 2011 to January 2012, 35 patients underwent RF kyphoplasty for 49 fresh osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures. From the clinical side the parameters, demographics and pain relief using a visual analogue scale (VAS: 0 to 100 mm) were collected. For the radiological outcome the vertebral body height (anterior, mean and posterior vertebral body height with kyphosis angle) after surgery and after three months was measured and compared to the cement volume. All patients still had permanent pain on the fractured level after conservative treatment. The time from initial painful fracture to treatment was 3.0 weeks Â± 1.3. Average visual analogue scale results decreased significantly from 71 Â± 9.2 preoperatively to 35 Â± 6.2 postoperatively (p < 0.001) and to 30 Â± 5.7 (p < 0.001) after three months. With a mean cement volume in the thoracic spine of 2.9 Â± 0.7 ml (1.8-4.1) and lumbar spine of 3.0 Â± 0.7 ml (2.0-5.0) we had a significant vertebral body height restoration. Anterior and mean vertebral body heights significantly increased by an average of 2.3 and 3.1 mm, kyphosis angle significantly decreased with an average of 2.1Â° at three-month follow-up (p < 0.05). In two vertebrae (4.1 %) a minimal asymptomatic cement leakage occurred into the upper disc. In two patients (5.7 %) we had new fractures in the directly adjacent segment that were also successfully treated with\n\nComparative review of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty\n\nPubMed Central\n\nRuiz Santiago, Fernando; Santiago Chinchilla, Alicia; GuzmÃ¡n Ãlvarez, Luis; PÃ©rez Abela, Antonio Luis; Castellano GarcÃ­a, Maria del Mar; Pajares LÃ³pez, Miguel\n\n2014-01-01\n\nThe aim of this review is to compare the effectiveness of percutaneous vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty to treat pain and improve functional outcome from vertebral fractures secondary to osteoporosis and tumor conditions. In 2009, two open randomized controlled trials published in the New England Journal of Medicine questioned the value of vertebroplasty in treating vertebral compression fractures. Nevertheless, the practice of physicians treating these conditions has barely changed. The objective of this review is to try to clarify the most important issues, based on our own experience and the reported evidence about both techniques, and to guide towards the most appropriate choice of treatment of vertebral fractures, although many questions still remain unanswered.

Carvalho\n\n2017-11-01\n\nKyphoplasty surgery is widely used for pain relief in patients with vertebral compression fracture (VCF). For this surgery, an X-ray emitter that provides real-time imaging is employed to guide the medical instruments and the surgical cement used to fill and strengthen the vertebra. Equivalent and effective doses related to high temporal resolution equipment has been studied to assess the damage and more recently cancer risk. For this study, a virtual scenario was prepared using MCNPX code and a pair of UF family simulators. Two projections with seven tube voltages for each one were simulated. The organ in the abdominal region were those who had higher cancer risk because they receive the primary beam. The risk of lethal cancer is on average 20% higher in AP projection than in LL projection. This study aims at estimating the risk of cancer in organs and the risk of lethal cancer for patient submitted to kyphoplasty surgery.\n\nExtrapedicular Infiltration Anesthesia as an Improved Method of Local Anesthesia for Unipedicular Percutaneous Vertebroplasty or Percutaneous Kyphoplasty.\n\nPubMed\n\nLiu, Liehua; Cheng, Shiming; Lu, Rui; Zhou, Qiang\n\n2016-01-01\n\nAim. This report introduces extrapedicular infiltration anesthesia as an improved method of local anesthesia for unipedicular percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty. Method. From March 2015 to March 2016, 44 patients (11 males and 33 females) with osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures with a mean age of 71.4 Â± 8.8 years (range: 60 to 89) received percutaneous vertebroplasty or percutaneous kyphoplasty. 24 patients were managed with conventional local infiltration anesthesia (CLIA) and 20 patients with both CLIA and extrapedicular infiltration anesthesia (EPIA). Patients evaluated intraoperative pain by means of the visual analogue score and were monitored during the procedure for additional sedative analgesia needs and for adverse nerve root effects. Results. VAS of CLIA + EPIA and CLIA group was 2.5 Â± 0.7 and 4.3 Â± 1.0, respectively, and there was significant difference ( P = 0.001). In CLIA group, 1 patient required additional sedative analgesia, but in CLIA + EPIA group, no patients required that. In the two groups, no adverse nerve root effects were noted. Summary. Extrapedicular infiltration anesthesia provided good local anesthetic effects without significant complications. This method deserves further consideration for use in unipedicular percutaneous vertebroplasty and percutaneous kyphoplasty.\n\nDouble Wronskian Solution and Soliton Properties of the Nonisospectral BKP Equation\n\nNASA Astrophysics Data System (ADS)\n\nWang, Deng-Shan; Li, Xiang-Gui; Chan, C.

A systematic review of articles in English or French listed in the MEDLINE, PASCAL, COCHRANE and National Health Service Economic Evaluation databases, with limits on publication date (up to the date of the review, March 2014). We included only economic evaluations of vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Editorial and methodological articles were excluded. Data were extracted from articles by two authors working independently and using two analysis grids to measure the quality of economic evaluations. Twenty-one studies met our inclusion criteria. All were published between 2008 and 2014. Eighteen (86%) were full economic evaluations. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) was the most frequent type of economic evaluation, and was present in 11 (52%) studies. Only three CEAs complied fully with the British Medical Journal checklist. The quality of the data sources used in the 21 studies was high, but the CEAs conforming to methodological guidelines did not use high-quality data sources for all components of the analysis. This systematic review shows that the level of evidence in economic evaluations of vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty is low, despite the recent publication of a large number of studies. This finding highlights the challenges to be faced to improve the quality of economic evaluations of medical devices.\n\nThe 5-Item Modified Frailty Index Is Predictive of 30-Day Postoperative Complications in Patients Undergoing Kyphoplasty Vertebral Augmentation.\n\nPubMed\n\nSegal, Dale N; Wilson, Jacob M; Staley, Christopher; Michael, Keith W\n\n2018-05-03\n\nVertebral compression fractures are the most common spine injury seen in elderly patients. Vertebral augmentation is considered a safe and effective treatment. The ability to predict outcomes based on comorbidities is lacking. The modified frailty index has been used to predict complications after orthopedic and surgical procedures. We hypothesized that despite a low rate of adverse outcomes, postoperative complications after kyphoplasty would be greater in patients who are frail. The National Surgical Quality Improvement Program database was queried for patients who underwent kyphoplasty between 2006 and 2015. Complication data including 30-day complications, life-threatening complications, reoperation and readmission rate, and length of stay data was recorded, and 5-item modified frailty index (5i-mFI) scores were calculated. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were then conducted to analyze frailty as a predictor of postoperative complications after kyphoplasty. In total, 2465 patients were identified (mean ageÂ = 73.98). As 5i-mFI increased from 0 to â¥2, the rate of overall complications increased nearly 3-fold from 3.7% to 10.4% (P < 0.001) and the rate of life-threatening complications increased from 0.8% to 2.4% (PÂ = 0.042). In addition, 30-day readmission increased from 8.9% to 12.9% (PÂ = 0.005), adverse hospital discharge increased from 7.6% to 25.6% (PÂ < 0.001), and length of stay increased from 1.66 days to 3.75 days (PÂ < 0.001). Frailty was associated with increased total complications, Clavien-Dindo IV complications, length of stay, and 30-day readmission rates. The 5i-mFI is a straightforward assessment tool that correlates with outcomes after kyphoplasty. It can be used to help clinicians predict adverse events and facilitate informed discussions with their patients. Copyright Â© 2018 Elsevier Inc.

From October 2008 to October 2012,178 patients with 224 osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures were treated with percutaneous kyphoplasty under local anethsia. There were 72 males and 106 females,ranging in age from 58 to 92 years old,with an average of 75.3 years,including 93 thoracic vertebrae and 131 lumbar vertebrae. The complications except bone cement leakage were analyzed during operation and after operation. All operations were successful and all patients were followed up from 12 to 60 months with an average of 26.2 months. No death was found. Bone cement leakage occurred in 27 cases, about 15.1% in 178 cases; and complications except bone cement leakage occurred in 15 cases. There was 1 case with cardiac arrest,was completely recovery by cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) immediately; and 1 case with temporary absence of breathing,was recovery after treatment. There were 3 cases with fall of blood pressure and slower of heart rate; 1 case with intestinal obstruction; 2 cases with local hematoma and 1 case with intercostal neuralgia. Vertebral body fractures of 2 cases were split by bone cement and the fractures of adjacent body occurred in 4 cases. It's uncommon complication except bone cement leakge in treatment of osteoporotic thoracolumbar vertebral compression fractures with percutaneous kyphoplasty. The complication of cardiopulmonary system is a high risk in surgery; and cytotoxicity of bone cement,nervous reflex,fat embolism and alteration of intravertebral pressure may be main reasons.\n\nCompression fractures of the back\n\nMedlinePlus\n\n... treatments.

A population-based retrospective cohort study. Taiwan' s National Health Insurance claims data. All individuals aged â¥ 60 years who were newly discharged after hospitalization for a primary VCF diagnosis. Percutaneous vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty. Study outcomes were discharge outcome (re-hospitalization within 1 week, 1 month or 6 months, categorized by diagnosis) and the prescription of anti-osteoporosis medication for secondary fracture prevention. Potential selection bias was adjusted by using propensity score matching to select one conservatively treated patient (e.g. lumbar brace, analgesics, or physical therapy) matched to one patient receiving VK. The study cohort consisted of 9238 patients who had been discharged after hospitalization for a first-ever VCF between 2004 and 2007. During the index hospitalization, 1018 patients received VK, compared with 8,220 patients who did not receive VK. Patients receiving percutaneous procedure group had a consistently lower incidence of 7-day re-hospitalization for any of the three outcomes (OR = 0.48; 95% CI: 0.32-0.72). Considering the cause of re-hospitalization separately, the vertebroplasty/kyphoplasty group had a significantly lower risk of 7-day re-hospitalization for fracture-related diagnosis (OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.12-0.68) and musculoskeletal diagnosis (OR = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.01-0.88) as well as a significantly lower risk of 1-month re-hospitalization (OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.59-0.93). VK may protect patients with VCFs from short-term re-hospitalization and a greater need exists for anti-osteoporosis medication as secondary prevention for this at-risk patient group.

The objective was to demonstrate noninferiority of the Kiva system to balloon kyphoplasty (BK) with respect to the composite primary endpoint. Annual incidence of osteoporotic VCFs is prevalent. Optimal treatment of VCFs should address pain, function, and deformity. Kiva is a novel implant for vertebral augmentation in the treatment of VCFs. A total of 300 subjects with 1 or 2 painful osteoporotic VCFs were randomized to blindly receive Kiva (n = 153) or BK (n = 147). Subjects were followed through 12 months. The primary endpoint was a composite at 12 months defined as a reduction in fracture pain by at least 15 mm on the visual analogue scale, maintenance or improvement in function on the Oswestry Disability Index, and absence of device-related serious adverse events. Secondary endpoints included cement usage, extravasation, and adjacent level fracture. A mean improvement of 70.8 and 71.8 points in the visual analogue scale score and 38.1 and 42.2 points in the Oswestry Disability Index was noted in Kiva and BK, respectively. No device-related serious adverse events occurred. Despite significant differences in risk factors favoring the control group at baseline, the primary endpoint demonstrated noninferiority of Kiva to BK. Analysis of secondary endpoints revealed superiority with respect to cement use and site-reported extravasation and a positive trend in adjacent level fracture warranting further study. The KAST study successfully established that the Kiva system is noninferior to BK based on a composite primary endpoint assessment incorporating pain-, function-, and device-related serious adverse events for the treatment of VCFs due to osteoporosis. Kiva was shown to be noninferior to BK and revealed a positive trend\n\nPolymethylmethacrylate distribution is associated with recompression after vertebroplasty or kyphoplasty for osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures: A retrospective study.\n\nPubMed\n\nHou, Yu; Yao, Qi; Zhang, Genai; Ding, Lixiang; Huang, Hui\n\n2018-01-01\n\nOsteoporotic vertebral compression fracture, always accompanied with pain and height loss of vertebral body, has a significant negative impact on life quality of patients.

Many different reduction techniques focusing on open surgical procedures have been described in the past. In this context we would like to introduce a novel technique which was first tested in a cadaver setup and has undergone its successful first clinical application. Since kyphoplasty demonstrated effective ways of anatomical correction in spine fractures, we adapted the inflatable instruments and used the balloon technique to reduce depressed fragments of the tibial plateau. The technique enabled us to restore a congruent cartilage surface and bone reduction. In this technique we see a useful new method to reduce depressed fractures of the tibial plateau with the advantages of low collateral damage as it is known from minimally invasive procedures.\n\nA review of complications associated with vertebroplasty and kyphoplasty as reported to the Food and Drug Administration medical device related web site.\n\nPubMed\n\nNussbaum, David A; Gailloud, Philippe; Murphy, Kieran\n\n2004-11-01\n\nIn 2002, approximately 38,000 vertebroplasties and 16,000 kyphoplasties were performed in the United States. As the use of both modalities for the treatment of vertebral compression fractures has increased, so have questions regarding safety and efficacy. The authors addressed this by reviewing both the current literature and complications data reported to the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiological Health through the on-line database (http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/maude.html) and through the Office of the Freedom of Information Act at the FDA. Although both procedures are largely safe, the FDA data highlight two main concerns: reactions to the use of acrylic (polymethylmethacrylate) bone cement, including hypotension and, in some cases, death, especially when multiple vertebral levels are treated in one setting; and a possible increased risk with kyphoplasty of pedicle fracture and cord compression.\n\nPregnancy-associated osteoporosis with eight fractures in the vertebral column treated with kyphoplasty and bracing: a case report.\n\nPubMed\n\nBonacker, J; Janousek, M; KrÃ¶ber, M\n\n2014-02-01\n\nPregnancy-associated osteoporosis is a rare condition, which imposes multiple symptoms in the musculoskeletal system. Common complaints announced by patients are severe pain in the lower back, hips and the joints of the lower extremities with a reduced and less mobility status in general. Most of the patients' problems occur in the last trimester of pregnancy or postpartum and are often not diagnosed as side effects of osteoporosis but as problems associated with pregnancy. Although vertebral fractures are rare complications of pregnancy-associated osteoporosis, they should be always considered in women presenting with an acute pain syndrome in peripregnancy period. This case presents a 40-year-old primagravid woman who developed pain in hips and severe pain in the lower back causing an immobilization diagnosed with a pregnancy-associated osteoporosis with eight compression fractures in the thoracic and lumbar spine. Because of sagittal imbalance of the spine, she was treated with kyphoplasty at the four lumbar fractures and with bracing for the upper, thoracic ones, additional to the conservative anti-osteoporotic therapy. The authors discuss pregnancy-associated osteoporosis and its clinical presentation, as well as the indications of kyphoplasty, spinal alignment and the risk of single conservative treatment.\n\nAn imaging anatomical study on percutaneous kyphoplasty for lumbar via a unilateral transverse process-pedicle approach.\n\nPubMed\n\nWang, Song; Wang, Qing; Kang, Jianping; Xiu, Peng; Wang, Gaoju\n\n2014-04-20\n\nAn imaging anatomical measurement. To investigate the anatomical feasibility of percutaneous kyphoplasty for lumbar osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures via a unilateral transverse process-pedicle approach (TPA). Kyphoplasty via a unilateral approach has been reported and good clinical results have been achieved. However, because of the lack of an anatomical study, these approaches have yet to be popularized. A total of 150 lumbar vertebral bodies of 30 patients were simulated kyphoplasty on the computed tomographic scans through conventional transpedicle approach (CTA) and the TPA, respectively. Anatomical parameters including the distance between the entry point and the midline of the vertebral body, the puncture inclination angle, and the success rate of puncture were measured and compared. The distance between the entry point and the midline from L1 to L5 lumbar levels varied from 20.6 Â± 2.2 mm to 28.6 Â± 2.9 mm in the CTA group and from 23.6 Â± 2.2 mm to 33.6 Â± 2.9 mm in the TPA group. The entry point from L1 to L5 in the TPA group was 3.0 Â± 2.1 mm to 5.1 Â± 2.7 mm more lateral than that in the CTA group. The medial inclination angles from L1 to L5 were 30.2Â° Â± 6.4Â° to 47.7Â° Â± 5.4Â° in the TPA and 15.3Â° Â± 6.0Â° to 22.8Â° Â± 8.7Â° in the CTA group. The inclination angles in the TPA group were greater than that in the CTA group and the safe range of the puncture angles was als"
