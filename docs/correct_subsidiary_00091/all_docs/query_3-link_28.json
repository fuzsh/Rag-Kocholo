        "text": "Are you looking for the most efficient, accelerated, and appropriate ways to get your medical device developed and commercialized? Apply by Sept 13!\n\nApply to speak with our expert, Gregg A. Jackson from Gershon MedTech for a 45-min slot, on the morning of Thursday, Sept 22.\n\nJoin this fast-paced, value-packed meeting with a Silicon Valley expert who has helped develop and launch over $3B of commercial products in eight medical device specialties over a 25-year history.\n\nThis is the perfect time to learn the most efficient and appropriate ways for how Project/Program Management is done for medical devices, digital health, and digital therapeutics. And to be quite honest, these are the essentials for all projects, programs, companies, or any significant effort you lead.\n\nYou will also learn how to navigate the differences between what is needed for a startup vs. a small, medium, and large company. All registrants will be given free access to a simple-to-use online assessment tool so they will be able to know what is missing and what is needed for their systems. All registrants will also qualify for free templates for the Project Start-Up Bootcamp Gregg runs for his top clients.\n\nGregg A. Jackson is a nationally known and highly sought after medical device expert that has developed and launched over $3B in medical technology and devices. Known as a Transformational Innovator, he brings Best Practises he’s learned in Business Development, Innovation, Entrepreneurialism, Strategy, Public Speaking, Program Management and Transformation to his clients and employers. He specializes in bringing highly profitable and sustainable strategies and systems into companies looking for exciting leaps forward and transformative results. As a principal and key person involved with some of the biggest medical device blockbusters (ACS and Guidant acquired by Abbott for $27B; St. Francis Medical acquired by Kyphon for $765M, then $3.4B by Medtronic), he and his affiliates have helped create commercialized product for the Digital Health, Digital Therapeutics, cardiovascular and spinal implants, surgical tools and telehealth markets.\n\nOur Expert Consults are hosted by leading experts who have generously offered their services pro bono to our entrepreneurs.\n\nIf you choose a timeslot, we will require a $100 credit card deposit. The deposit will be refunded the day after you attend. No-shows will not receive a refund. Please be punctual; arrivals late by more than 15 minutes will be considered no-shows.\n\nIf you find that you are unable to attend, you may request a refund up to 5 days in advance. (This will give us time to offer the slot to the first person on the waitlist.) We regret that we cannot honor requests made at a later time."
