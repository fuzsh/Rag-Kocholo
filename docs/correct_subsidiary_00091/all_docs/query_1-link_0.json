        "text": "SUNNYVALE, Calif., Dec. 4 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Kyphon Inc. , announced today that it has signed a definitive agreement to acquire St. Francis Medical Technologies, Inc. (“St. Francis”), a privately held, California-based company that manufactures the X STOP(R) Interspinous Process Decompression (IPD(R)) System, the first FDA-approved interspinous process device for treating lumbar spinal stenosis. The transaction broadens Kyphon’s focus in minimally invasive spine by adding the X STOP(R) technology platform to its existing KyphX(R) balloon kyphoplasty technologies for repairing vertebral compression fractures and its recently launched Functional Anaesthetic Discography(TM) procedure for diagnosing the source of low back pain.\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Kyphon will acquire 100% of the fully diluted equity of St. Francis for $525 million in upfront cash payable upon closing, plus additional revenue-based contingent payments of up to $200 million payable in either cash or a combination of cash and stock, at Kyphon’s election. Any contingent payments will be made no earlier than 2008. Kyphon’s agreement with St. Francis is subject to governmental regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. Until receipt of regulatory approval, the acquisition will not be able to close, although Kyphon presently anticipates that closing may occur in the first quarter of 2007.\n\nUpon closing, Kyphon expects to incur an estimated one-time, pre-tax charge of approximately $35 to $50 million for in-process research and development (IPR&D). Although the company has not finalized the purchase price allocation and thus cannot yet assess the exact impact on 2007 GAAP earnings, Kyphon anticipates that the transaction will be significantly dilutive to 2007 GAAP earnings due to the expected level of transaction- related intangible amortization and the fact that the IPR&D charge will not be tax-deductible.\n\nExcluding the impact of the non-cash IPR&D charge, Kyphon expects this acquisition to be approximately $0.15 to $0.20 dilutive to pro forma, non-GAAP earnings per share in 2007 due primarily to the amortization of intangibles resulting from this transaction. Excluding both the non-cash IPR&D charge and the non-cash amortization of intangibles, the company anticipates the transaction to be neutral to $0.10 accretive to pro forma, non-GAAP earnings per share in 2007. In 2008 and thereafter, Kyphon anticipates the transaction will be significantly accretive to GAAP earnings per share.\n\nKyphon will finance the upfront payment due upon closing through a combination of cash on hand and bank financing, including a syndicated term loan and credit facility. Depending on market conditions, the company may access the equity or equity-linked markets in 2007 to retire some portion of the debt.\n\n“This acquisition directly supports our stated strategy of bringing minimally invasive spine therapies to our markets and adds an innovative new product platform to benefit the large number of patients suffering from lumbar spinal stenosis,” said Richard Mott, president and chief executive officer of Kyphon. “We have been impressed with the progress St. Francis has made over the past several years in developing its X STOP(R) technology and with the strength and breadth of the associated intellectual property portfolio it built to protect its innovations. This acquisition will leverage the strong distribution capabilities of our direct sales organization and provide another growth engine for delivering enhanced value to our shareholders,” Mott concluded.\n\n“Both Kyphon and St. Francis share a common commitment to technological innovation through minimally invasive products and procedures to address debilitating spinal diseases,” said Kevin Sidow, president and chief executive officer of St. Francis. “In building its balloon kyphoplasty franchise, Kyphon has established relationships with thousands of spine specialists through its large direct sales force and clinical education programs. Kyphon is the ideal partner to maximize the potential of our X STOP(R) system and accelerate adoption of this important technology.”\n\nAdvisors\n\nIn connection with the transaction, Banc of America Securities LLC is acting as financial advisor, and Latham & Watkins LLP is legal counsel, to Kyphon. J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. is acting as financial advisor, and Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati LLP is legal counsel, to St. Francis.\n\nConference Call and Webcast\n\nKyphon management will host a conference call to discuss the acquisition of St. Francis Medical Technologies, Inc. today, Monday, December 4, 2006 at 5:30 a.m. Pacific Time (8:30 a.m. Eastern Time).
