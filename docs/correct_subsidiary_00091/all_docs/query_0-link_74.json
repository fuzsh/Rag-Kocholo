Once again, Orthopedic Design & Technology takes an in-depth look at the largest players in the orthopedic market. This set of profiles, our second annual report of the top 10 orthopedic companies, ranks the leading publicly traded firms by orthopedic-related revenue for fiscal year 2006.\n\nThough the impressive double-digit expansion the orthopedic sector enjoyed a few years back flattened some in 2006, the top orthopedic companies in the industry still reported overall growth, claiming their share of a $26 billion global marketplace. In fact, six of the companies on this year's list reported revenue growth of 10% or more compared to the previous fiscal year-Stryker, Synthes, Medtronic Sofamor Danek, DJO, Kyphon and Orthofix.\n\nPricing pressures may have taken their toll, but the ubiquitous industry growth factors we've all come to know so well--the rapid rise of aging US and global populations, active baby boomers who will live longer than previous generations and an obesity epidemic, just to name a few--continued to drive the orthopedic industry forward. In addition, innovation in areas such as minimally invasive surgery also fueled market expansion, making previously traumatic implant surgeries much more patient friendly.\n\nLarge joint implants--hip and knee--still reign (volume, more so than price, now is the name of the game), but the spine market (worth $6 billion in 2006) is growing at a faster rate, and the trauma sector is poised for continued significant growth (14% growth between 2005 and 2006). To maintain their competitive advantage, orthopedic companies are continually challenged to innovate and get products to market as quickly as possible. They often achieve this through mergers and acquisitions, of which 2006 certainly saw its fair share and 2007 picks up where last year left off. Private equity firms also have taken a shine to the orthopedic sector (think Biomet and DJO), mirroring a trend experienced by the overall device industry.\n\nMichael Matson, senior analyst who covers the orthopedic market for Wachovia Capital Markets in New York, NY, told ODT that some of the smaller companies in the market (less than a billion dollars in sales)--particularly Kyphon and Orthofix--achieved significant sales growth by making the right buys, especially given the fact that there have been few blockbuster product launches.\n\n\"Acquisitions are helping to drive revenues,\" he said. \"These companies are getting bigger through deals.\"\n\nAlong with input from industry experts, public documents and consultations with company officials helped us compile this report, which examines the numerous factors that affect companies' triumphs or trials. Space constraints limit out ability to detail every twist and turn a company may have experienced in the past year, but we hope you, nonetheless, find it comprehensive and informative.\n\n1 Stryker Corp.\n\n$5.4 Billion\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nJohn W. Brown, Chairman\n\nStephen P. MacMillan, President and CEO\n\nDean H. Bergy, VP and CFO\n\nLuciano Cattani, VP and Group President, International\n\nMichael P. Mogul, President, Orthopedics\n\nStephen S. Johnson, VP and Group President, MedSurg\n\nJames E. Kemler, VP and Group President, Biotech, Spine, Osteosynthesis and Development\n\nKatherine A. Owen, VP of Regulatory Affairs and Quality Assurance\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 18,800\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Kalamazoo, Michigan\n\nStryker experienced double-digit increases in earnings and sales for fiscal 2006, which ended on Dec. 31, leading the company to its No. 1 spot (by sales for 2006) in a market worth almost $30 billion.\n\nThe double-digit climb is nothing new for this company; Stryker has grown its sales in this range for six consecutive years. Net sales increased by 11% to $5.4 billion in fiscal 2006, while net earnings increased almost 21% to $778 million, up from $644 million in 2005.\n\nAt the beginning of 2006, Stryker changed its business segment reporting to include the financial results of certain products within its MedSurg equipment segment rather than within its Orthopedic implants category because, according to the company, the products \"are better aggregated with its other MedSurg equipment products based on similarities in manufacturing and marketing practices and customer base.\"\n\nMany products within the MedSurg category--such as implant-specific surgical instruments--serve the orthopedic industry. According to the company's Web site, approximately 82% of its total sales come from the orthopedic implant and equipment market, making for roughly $4.4 billion in orthopedic-related revenue, though that's not official. A precise breakdown of individual product sales and the sectors served was not available.\n\nDomestic sales were $3.6 billion for the year, increasing 12.4%, while international sales hit $1.8 billion, increasing 8.4%. Worldwide sales of orthopedic implants were $3.1 billion, an increase of 9.1%, based on higher shipments of reconstructive implants (hip, knee and shoulder), trauma, spinal and craniomaxillofacial implant systems; bone cement; and the bone growth factor OP-1, the company said. Roughly 66% of Stryker's total sales are based in the United States.\n\nMedSurg equipment also experienced significant growth--15.8%--reaching $2 billion for the year, driven by strong sales of surgical equipment; surgical navigation systems; endoscopic, communications and digital imaging systems; as well as patient handling and emergency medical equipment, according to Stryker.\n\nOne bleak spot in the company's otherwise positive financial picture was its Physical Therapy Services division, which reported revenues of $258.4 million for the year, a 1.6% decrease. Net earnings were only $6.3 million for the year, a 43% drop. In June this year, Stryker announced that it was selling its outpatient physical therapy business, Physiotherapy Associates, to Water Street Healthcare Partners, a Chicago, IL-based private equity firm, for $150 million in cash. Stryker said the business, ultimately, wasn't close enough to its core device business.\n\nNew product rollouts continue to play a role in the company's ongoing success. For example, in August 2006, the company received FDA 510(k) clearance for its advanced hip bearing system, LFIT Anatomic Femoral Heads with X3 Polyethylene liners. The system combines Stryker's Low Friction Ion Treatment technology with X3 advanced bearing technology and is anatomically sized for more natural hip performance, according to the company. The result is total hip replacement designed to help minimize dislocation and its associated healthcare costs, while providing an attractive alternative to metal-on-metal bearings, Stryker said.\n\nDespite pricing pressures in certain orthopedic sectors, company officials remain optimistic about 2007 due to underlying growth rates in orthopedic procedures and the company's broad range of products in orthopedics and other specialties. Stryker expects a net sales increase in the range of 11% to 13%. Positive currency gains also are expected to have minimal impact. For the first quarter of 2007 (ended March 31), Stryker reported net sales of $1.5 billion, up 12.7%. Net earnings jumped 65% to $243 million. The majority of the company's sectors experienced double-digit growth.\n\n2 DePuy\n\n$ 4.1 Billion\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nTom Sullivan, President, DePuy Orthopaedics\n\nGary Fischetti, President, DePuy Spine\n\nMichel Paul, President, DePuy Mitek\n\nP. Laxminarain, President, DePuy Codman\n\nWilliam Weldon, Chairman and CEO, Johnson B, Johnson\n\nDominic J. Caruso, VP, Finance and CFO, Johnson 8, Johnson\n\nNicholas Valeriani, Worldwide Chairman, Medical Devices & Diagnostics Group, Johnson & Johnson\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 6,000\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Warsaw, IN\n\nWhile 2006 may go down in history as the year Johnson & Johnson (J&J; New Brunswick, NJ) lost the bidding battle for Guidant to rival Boston Scientific, company officials are quick to remind investors and the medtech community--and rightly so--that there's a lot more going on with the healthcare and medical device giant.\n\nDePuy, J&J's orthopedic branch, has been contributing very nicely to the company's overall bottom line. Acquired in 1998 for $3.5 billion, DePuy is part of the J&J's Medical Devices & Diagnostics group and markets products under the Codman, DePuy Mitek, DePuy Orthopaedics and DePuy Spine brands.\n\nDePuy Orthopaedics specializes in products for reconstructing damaged or diseased joints and for repairing and reconstructing traumatic skeletal injuries. DePuy Spine products facilitate fusion of the spine and correction of spinal deformities, preserving motion of the spine and repairing bone fractures. Codman products provide for the surgical treatment of neurological and central nervous system disorders through products such as hydrocephalic shunt valve systems, implantable drug pumps and micro-surgical instrumentations. DePuy Mitek focuses on devices used in sports medicine for the treatment of soft tissue injuries.\n\nFor 2006, orthopedic operations reported $4.1 billion in revenue, an increase of 6.7% from $3.8 billion in 2005. Despite continued growth, DePuy was not immune to the slowdown experienced by the orthopedic sector last year. The company had reported double-digit increases in revenue in 2005 and 2004. But analysts currently see the market rebounding slowly, and long-term market demographics bode well for continued growth for DePuy and its affiliated groups. Company officials remain optimistic.\n\n\"Hip replacement surgery isn't just for seniors anymore,\" said Stefano Alfonsi, worldwide vice president of hip marketing for DePuy Orthopaedics. \"In fact, the orthopedic patient population is getting younger. Patients are unwilling to accept long-term pain and want to maintain their quality of life. Additionally, treatment options for younger patients are expanding.\"\n\nAccording to J&J's annual report, 2006 fiscal year sales expansion for the orthopedic division primarily was due to orthopedic joint reconstruction products and Mitek sports medicine products and the trauma business. The company also reported continued growth in the use of its Charite artificial spinal disc, which was approved by the FDA in 2004. According to DePuy Spine, more than 5,000 patients have received the disc in the United States since that time. J&J outwardly remains upbeat, but according to Wall Street analysts, sales of Charite have been disappointing.\n\nIn May 2006, DePuy received some good news from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS). Earlier in the year, the agency had proposed denying coverage of the Charite disc for patients 60 years old and younger. The CMS, however, did an about face and announced it would allow for coverage at the discretion of local Medicare medical directors.\n\n\"As we have consistently indicated, this technology is most appropriate for younger patients and this decision allows access to the disabled population who qualify for Medicare--and may benefit from this technology,\" said Gary Fischetti, president of DePuy Spine.\n\nThe CMS had proposed to deny coverage because of a lack of evidence to indicate that the surgery to implant the device is \"reasonable and necessary.\" The proposal to deny Medicare coverage could have prompted private health insurers to take similar actions. The agency currently does not cover Charite (nor does it cover the Pro Disc-L from Synthes) for patients older than 60. DePuy does not release sales information on Charite, but according to Merrill Lynch estimates, annual sales of the artificial disc decreased to $21 million in 2006 from $41 million in 2005. Growth for DePuy in 2006 also came in the form of acquisitions. According to J&J, strategic purchases in 2006 significantly broadened DePuy's portfolio.\n\nIn January 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Hand Innovations, LLC, a privately held manufacturer of widely used fracture fixation products for the upper extremities and technology in plating, which DePuy said is one of the fastest-growing and most under-penetrated segments of the trauma market. In March, the Mitek division of DePuy acquired Future Medical Systems, SA, a privately held company based in France that develops arthroscopic fluid management systems.\n\nFor J&J as a whole, the company's medical device and diagnostics division comprised 38% of company revenue, which totaled $20.3 billion in 2006, a 6.2% increase. DePuy was fourth out of J&J's seven largest device divisions in terms of revenue growth for 2006. For the year, roughly 40% of J&J's overall device and diagnostics sales came from products introduced in the past five years.\n\nStarting off 2007, DePuy Orthopaedics used the annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons held in San Diego to announced additions to its product line. DePuy released two new options for restoring hip mobility in patients who require total hip replacement. The Pinnacle Acetabular Cup System Ultamet XL and the Pinnacle Acetabular Cup System AltrX hip bearings are designed to recreate the natural ball and socket joint of the hip to help increase joint stability, range of motion and longevity, the company said. DePuy also unveiled its Agility LP Total Ankle Replacement for the treatment of end-stage ankle disorders. The Agility LP Total Ankle is intended to provide an alternative to ankle fusion surgery as well as advancement in current ankle replacement technology, according to DePuy.\n\nThe company also used the meeting to launch three new Hand Innovations products designed for a less-invasive approach to fracture surgery for the hand, wrist, foot and shoulder: the F3 Fragment Plating System, the $3 Shoulder Nail Plating System and the Multi Directional Threaded Peg for the DVR Anatomic Plating System. According to Jorge Orbay, MD, founder of the Miami Hand Center in Miami, FL, the new products \"make a big difference in the way we treat fractures in the hand, wrist, foot and shoulder as they expand our ability to stabilize bone and adapt to the particulars of the patient's anatomy.\"\n\nIn June, DePuy Spine received some additional good news with regard to Charite. The US District Court for the Central District of California ruled in favor of DePuy Spine and dismissed virtually all claims of product liability relating to the artificial disc. The plaintiff, a 38-year-old California woman, had claimed that the disc was not designed, tested and labeled properly. Earlier this year, DePuy Spine moved to have the product liability case dismissed on the grounds that a device-specific evaluation and approval by the federal government preempts any state court jury re-determination of the same issues.\n\nDePuy Spine came out on top of yet more legal problems with the announcement earlier this year that rival Medtronic would pay more than $26 million in damages to satisfy a federal appeals court ruling that found Medtronic violated a spinal device patent held by DePuy. In December 2006, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a verdict reached by a federal jury in October 2004 that found Medtronic's MAS screws infringed on the DePuy Spine patent. The screws are used in spinal surgery to correct a variety of spinal defects. A court date also has been set to find if Medtronic's Vertex screws also infringe on the same DePuy Spine patent. The trial is set to begin on Sept. 4 in the US District Court in Massachusetts.\n\nIn addition, February 2007 marked a milestone for DePuy Orthopaedics, with more than one million of the company's mobile bearing knees having been implanted worldwide, the company said.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2007, J&J reported sales of $15 billion, a 15.7% increase, and net earnings were $2.6 billion. Worldwide medical device and diagnostics sales were $5.3 billion for the quarter, a 6.2% increase. Among the primary contributors to the growth, according to J&J, were DePuy's orthopedic joint reconstruction, sports medicine and trauma businesses.\n\n3 Zimmer Holdings\n\n$3.5 Billion\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nDavid C. Dvorak, President & CEO\n\nCheryl R. Blanchard, PhD, Sr. VP, R&D and Chief Scientific Officer\n\nSheryl L. Conley, Group President, Americas and Global Marketing and Chief Marketing Officer\n\nJames T Crines, Exec. VP, Finance and CFO\n\nBruno A. Melzi, Chairman, Europe, Africa and Middle East\n\nChad F. Phipps, St. VP, General Counsel and Secretary\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 6,900\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Warsaw, IN\n\nIn line with its strategic initiative to \"Enable, Innovate and Grow,\" Zimmer Holdings cast itself into various endeavors in 2006 that will allow the company to continue on its mission to excel in each of its four core divisions. However, the challenges plaguing the orthopedic industry affected Zimmer, as they did its competitors. This time around, Zimmer failed to grow sales by double digits, as it had in past years.\n\nZimmer reported sales of $3.5 billion in 2006, a 6% increase from the previous year. With an established presence in more than 100 countries, sales around the world experienced single-digit increases. The Americas contributed $2.1 billion, Europe offered $931 million and the Asia Pacific added $488 million to sales.\n\nZimmer's four core divisions also experienced single-digit increases, with the exception of the spinal unit, which rose 11% from 2005. Although the reconstructive and trauma units experienced slight sales increases, the bright spot for the company was its dental segment (part of the Reconstructive unit), which grew by 21%. Orthopedic Surgical Products was the only division in 2006 to experience a slight decrease in sales, which were down 4% from the prior year.\n\nThe year brought about a series of new innovations; however, the biggest advancement in Zimmer innovations was the introduction of gender-specific knees for women, which debuted in early 2006 after a five-year effort to develop the product. The Gender Solutions Technology line fueled a 13.5% rise in total earnings in first quarter of 2006. Zimmer has plans for gender-based hips to launch in this year and in 2008. Eventually, the complete line will be designed to address anatomical differences based on gender and, in the future, ethnicity. To help promote its new line, Zimmer launched its first major direct-to-consumer advertising campaign.\n\nFor Zimmer, the introduction of new products did not stop with gender-specific implants. In fact, Zimmer introduced a total of 20 new products in 2006. New versions of existing products, such as a coated screw version of the Dynesys spinal system, were part of the lines rolled out. Among other spinal innovations was the Vista-P PEEK VBR Implant.\n\nZimmer's trauma division introduced new offerings as well, including the MIS Femoral Nailing Solutions. Meanwhile, the dental unit came out with the One-Piece Implant and Hex-Lock Contour Abutments, as well as Puros Dermis and Pericardium regenerative membrane products. In the restorative unit, Zimmer was granted regulatory approval from the FDA to begin selling ceramic hip replacements, known as the Trilogy AB Cermic-on-Ceramic Acetabular System.\n\n\"During the year, we experienced a tremendous flow of new products and reached a Zimmer record 24% of sales coming from new products, including $229 million in the fourth quarter,\" said Raymond Elliott, Zimmer's former president and CEO.\n\nIn an effort to boost its line of surgical instruments, Zimmer entered a five-year agreement in July with Brasseler USA, which allows the company to sell and distribute Brasseler's powered surgical instruments and consumables in the United States.\n\nZimmer, along with ISTO Technologies, also announced the start of its clinical trial for Neocartilage, a living tissue-engineered graft under investigation as a therapy for knee problems. Zimmer plans to market the product as DeNovo ET Engineered Tissue Graft.\n\nThe company increased its product catalog through numerous acquisitions in 2006. The company acquired Musculoskeletal Management Systems LLC, known as Human Motion Institute brand. Additionally, Zimmer acquired the intellectual property rights, inventory and associated assets of the Cyclone Anterior Cervical Plate System, a versatile, low profile ACP system that complements the company's spine division.\n\nZimmer got its feet wet in dental implants by opening Zimmer Dental in June 2006. The Zimmer Institute, located in Carlsbad, CA, is a professional training center that specializes in helping clinicians practice contemporary implant dentistry.\n\nIn addition, a new 130,000-square-foot R&D manufacturing facility for the Zimmer Trauma division was opened alongside the company's headquarters in Warsaw, IN.\n\nZimmer forecasts a positive outlook for 2007 with anticipation that its direct-to-consumer advertising campaign will aid the launch of its new implants.\n\nZimmer's recent acquisition of Endius Inc., a private business that develops minimally invasive spine products and techniques, also will contribute to Zimmer's willingness to stay on top of its game. With net sales up 10% to $950 million in the first quarter (ended March 31) of 2007, the company expects sales growth of 10% to 11% in each of the remaining quarters this year.\n\nBut will all the changes occurring at Zimmer allow for that kind of growth? For now, the company is in major transition, as former CEO Ray Elliott retired in May. Elliott served as chairman, president and CEO of Zimmer for its entire run as a public company since its spinoff from Bristol-Myers Squibb in 2001. He was president of Zimmer since 1997.\n\nDavid C. Dvorak group president, global businesses, and chief legal officer, recently took over the helm.\n\n4 Smith & Nephew\n\n$2.8 Billion\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nDavid Illingworth, CEO\n\nJoseph DeVivo, President, Orthopaedic Reconstruction\n\nMark Augusti, President, Orthopaedic Trauma and Clinical Therapies\n\nMichael Frazzette, President, Smith & Nephew Endoscopy\n\nJoe Woody, President, Advanced Wound Management\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 8,830\n\nHEADQUARTERS: London, United Kingdom\n\nAs a key player in the orthopedic reconstruction business, Smith & Nephew proved in 2006 that it will continue to exercise dominance in orthopedic devices. Amid a flurry of product launches and acquisitions, the company increased its annual revenue by 9% compared with 2005, totaling $2.8 billion in 2006.\n\nThe year started with a decision to split its orthopedic business unit into two separate global units: Orthopaedic Reconstruction and Orthopaedic Trauma and Clinical Therapies. These two newly formed units contributed $919 million (10% growth) and $497 million (13%), respectively, to FY 2006 revenue.\n\nSome of the most notable product launches in the Reconstruction unit included the Journey knee, the Birmingham Hip Resurfacing system (in the United States) and Emperion hip system. Adding to the bottom line in 2006 were the late-2005 launches of Legion and Anthology. New products contributed 15% of the unit's total sales in 2006.\n\nMeanwhile, the Trauma group launched an upper extremity system for the Peri-Loc Periarticular Locked Plating System, as well as the Intertan Intertrochanteric Antegrade Nail for treatment of femoral fractures, the Meta Nail for fractures of the femur and tibia, and the Exogen 4000+ Bone Healing System. The company also received FDA approvals for 6.5 mm and 8 mm Cannulated Screws (April), Caption Disposable Platelet Concentrator (May) and Peri-Loc B Plates (September). The Trauma group also formed a strategic alliance with Q-Med AB (a Swedish company) as a means of gaining share of Q-Med's propriety technology for the production of stabilized non-animal hyaluronic acid for orthopedic applications. As part of this agreement, Smith & Nephew gained rights to market, sell and distribute Durolane single-injection hyaluronic acid therapy (approved in Europe and Canada).\n\nNon-orthopedic units had mixed results. The Endoscopy segment grew 9% in 2006, adding $665 million to the company's total sales. Some of its notable launches included the Calaxo Osteoconductive Interface Screw, the Biomptor Hip Suture Anchor, the Hip Positioning System and the Kinsa Suture Anchor. In addition, the company launched digital products, such as the 660HD Image Management System and the Condor Control System.\n\nAdvanced Wound Management had a flat year, with $698 million in sales, a 1% increase. The division launched enhanced Allevyn Non-Adhesive dressings in Europe, which expands upon the Allevyn Adhesive and Sacrum introduced in early 2006.\n\nIn terms of total revenue for Smith & Nephew, nearly half of all sales occurred in the United States, which contributed nearly $1.4 billion, an 8% increase since 2005. Europe contributed $867 million, a rise of 6% over the last year. Other regions, including Japan, added $547 million to the bottom line, reflecting a 12% increase\n\nIn attempts to bolster its sales in Europe, Smith & Nephew shelled out $72 million in July 2006 for OsteoBiologics Inc., which markets bioabsorbable bone graft substitutes and provides the only off-the-shelf bioabsorbable implant for articular cartilage repair on the European market.\n\nIn legal news, Smith & Nephew was granted a favorable court ruling against Synthes in October 2006. The dispute drew its roots in November 2002, when Smith & Nephew brought Synthes to court on issues related to patent infringement. A permanent injection mandated that Synthes could no longer sell or promote the Synthes Trochanteric Fixation Nail and Proximal Fixation Nail products in the United States for the use of repairing intertrochanteric fractures.\n\nOf course, the year wouldn't complete for the orthopedic industry, it seems, without a subpoena for the major players. Smith & Nephew was one of five companies in the industry to receive subpoenas from the US Attorney's Office concerning possible antitrust law violations relating to the sale of implants. Investigations are ongoing.\n\nThe year wrapped up with Smith & Nephew expressing interest and then terminating speculation that it would merge with Biomet Inc. and become one business. Biomet has since been the target of a private equity group (for more information, read Top of the News on page 12).\n\nForeseeable change is in the air for Smith & Nephew, with the first half of 2007 reflecting a time of executive realignment, more product launches and key acquisitions.\n\nMajor switches in executive posts were unveiled in early 2007, with the most significant announcement being that Smith & Nephew's chief executive, Sir Christopher O'Donnell, would retire on July 31. A nearly 20-year employee of the company who served in his post since 1998, O'Donnell was responsible for streamlining the company from nine divisions to its current four. His replacement is David Illingworth, former COO, who assumed responsibility as chief executive on July 1.\n\nIn the first half of 2007, Smith & Nephew's Advanced Wound Management business hit the ground running in mergers and acquisitions. In January, the division announced an agreement with UDL Laboratories Inc., a subsidiary of Mylan Laboratories Inc., to exclusively distribute Biobrane Biosynthetic Wound Dressing outside the United States. In line with the company's expansion initiatives, the Advanced Wound Management division announced in March an agreement with Covalon Technologies for its advanced range of collagen dressings and became the sole distributor of ColActive.\n\nAdditionally, in May, the division agreed to purchase BlueSky Medical Group Inc. for $15 million (plus additional payments depending on performance). BlueSky manufactures negative pressure pumps and wound dressing kits. According to Smith & Nephew, its strategy in purchasing this company is to enter the \"fastest growing segment of the advanced wound care market.\"\n\nIn the same month, Smith & Nephew entered into a global distribution agreement with Teknimed SA to distribute, market and sell Teknimed's Spine Fix bone cement product (for treatment of spinal compression fractures) in North America, Europe and Australia.\n\nMost recently, Smith & Nephew acquired Plus Orthopedics Holding AG, a private Swiss company, in June, for $889 million. According to Smith & Nephew, this purchase will double the company's share in the European reconstruction market, and the combined company will become the third largest orthopedic business in Germany. The acquisition also increases Smith & Nephew's presence in Asia. Plus Orthopedics, an implant manufacturer, had $300 million in revenues in 2006.\n\nIn July, Smith & Nephew globally launched its new Journey Deuce bi-compartmental knee system, which is intended to provide nearly 70% of patients receiving a total knee replacement the option of a more minimally invasive, bone- and ligament-preserving treatment. The implant is called the Deuce because it replaces only two areas of the knee most commonly affected by osteoarthritis while keeping the third area intact.\n\nTraditional total knee replacement resurfaces and replaces the ends of the thighbone, shinbone and knee cap. However, one study has indicated that up to 70% of the disease in osteoarthritic knees is limited to the kneecap and the inner portion of the thigh and shinbone. The Journey Deuce treats only the diseased areas leaving the lateral portion of the femur and tibia untouched. The system is designed using oxidized zirconium, a wear-reducing surface.\n\nDuring this year's American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons annual meeting, a financial analyst firm Wachovia selected the implant as the \"most innovative reconstructive product\" at the event. The Journey Deuce will be available in the United States, Canada, Australia and Europe, and nearly 200 non-design team surgeons have been trained on the system to date, the company said.\n\n5 Synthes\n\n$2.4 Billion\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nHansjorg Wyss, Chairman\n\nMichel Orsinger, President, CEO\n\nRobert Donohue, CFO, President, Synthes Canada\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 8,451\n\nHEADQUARTERS: West Chester, PA\n\nWith multiple additions to its product line and a consistent focus on international growth, Synthes, a Swiss medical device manufacturer with US headquarters in Pennsylvania, achieved double-digit sales in its trauma, spine and craniomaxillofacial (CMF) lines. For FY 2006, net sales were $2.4 billion, up 15.1% from 2005.\n\nSales in North America were higher than any other division and contributed $1.5 billion toward the company's overall total. Global sales presented remarkable figures in FY 2006 as well, with products in Europe, Asia Pacific and various other countries achieving sales of $519 million, $220 million and $127 million, respectively.\n\nWith the addition of 824 new employees last year, Synthes is climbing the ladder to continued growth--this progression follows a similar pattern seen in 2005, when the company increased its workforce by nearly 14%.\n\nEach of the company's business units had noteworthy achievements in 2006.\n\nSynthes' trauma unit, the company's largest division, sustained a market share of 55%, aided by the introduction of 40 new products in 2006. The expansion of the Locking Compression Plate (LCP) system was an integral factor in sustaining growth. Since 2002, Synthes has introduced 32 different LCP product lines and, in the fourth quarter, expanded these existing systems. In intramedullary nailing, the Expert Lateral Femoral Nail was the main market launch in FY 2006. The introduction of the Headless Compression Screw in the sub-segment for mini-fragments was characterized by the company as another important highlight.\n\nSynthes' CMF division maintained a 50%-plus market share in North America, with one of the top growth drivers being the Low Profile Neuro System. However, introductions of the Sternal Fixation System, the Patient Specific Implant and the PlusDrive System also contributed to the company's success.\n\nSpine growth was derived from the Interbody Fusion, Anterior Thoracolumbar, Cervical and Biomaterials product portfolios. Synthes' spinal division concentrated its efforts on the launch of its Prodisc-L artificial lumbar disc after the FDA approved the device for US markets (it already was available in Europe). Synthes reported that in 2006, the company introduced more high-impact spine products than any previous year.\n\nAlong with product initiatives, Synthes strengthened its market presence in other ways. While continuing its ongoing collaboration with the AO Foundation, Synthes acquired various assets of the group, including the Synthes trade names, brands, as well as patents and know-how, in August. In addition, Affinergy Inc., a Duke University spinoff with a proprietary site-specific biological delivery system, signed an exclusive development and license agreement with Synthes in September to work across all three of Synthes' markets.\n\nThe company received some mixed news last fall regarding a patent infringement lawsuit. In early October, a judge ruled that Synthes' Trochanteric Fixation Nail (TFN) devices and Proximal Femoral Nail (PFN) products infringed on a Smith & Nephew patent. However, later that month, the court amended the prior decision by allowing Synthes to continue selling TFN devices with the caveat that the company could not sell or promote the use of the present TFN products to treat intertrochanteric fractures.\n\nLooking at 2007, the company faced some upheaval with a notable realignment in executive management. Michel Orsinger, former president and COO of the company for the past two-and-a-half years, was promoted to the post of CEO in April. Synthes' former CEO, Hansjorg Wyss, will remain as chairman of the board.\n\nRegarding the future, Synthes pointed out in its 2006 annual report that it has never achieved less than 10% organic sales growth and does not expect 2007 to be any different. The beginning of 2007 already reflects higher net sales of $658 million reported in the first quarter, an increase of 14.2% from the same period last year. The company credits its expanding product lines in all three of its divisions as the leading catalyst.\n\n6 Medtronic Sofamor Danek\n\n$2.2 Billion\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nArt Collins, Chairman and CEO\n\nWilliam A. Hawkins, President and COO\n\nGary Ellis, St. VP and CFO\n\nSusan Alpert, Sr. VP and Chief Quality and Regulatory Officer\n\nStephen Oesterle, Sr. VP, Medicine and Technology\n\nPeter L. Wehrly, President, Sofamor Danek\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 1,800\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Memphis, TN\n\nMinneapolis, MN-based Medtronic may be widely known for its strong presence in the cardiovascular market, but its Sofamor Danek orthopedic division is an industry powerhouse in its own right. The division, headquartered in Memphis, TN, posted significant gains for fiscal year 2006--the second largest revenue driver for the company after cardiac rhythm management.\n\nThe spinal and navigation businesses reported annual revenue of $2.2 billion, which is a 19% jump compared to 2005. Spinal net sales for fiscal year 2006 increased 20% from the prior fiscal year to $2.1 billion. Biologics net sales were $570.2 million, a 38% increase compared to 2005.\n\nThe company's line of spinal and navigation products include thoracolumbar, cervical and interbody spinal devices, bone growth substitutes and surgical navigation tools. Medtronic attributed the impressive gain to \"continued strong acceptance\" of its Infuse line of bone graft products and the introduction of the Capstone vertebral body spacer. The company's Horizon Legacy series of spinal implant devices also grew by double digits at roughly 24%.\n\nOverall, for fiscal year 2006, Medtronic reported $11.3 billion (12% growth) in company-wide net sales, while net earnings showed a significant 42% bump to $2.6 billion compared to 2005.\n\nFor fiscal year 2007, which the company reported in May, Medtronic reported revenue of $12.3 billion, an increase of 9% compared to 2006. Income grew less aggressively, up 10% to $2.8 billion. The company reported annual revenue of $2.4 billion for its spinal division, an increase of 13%. Once again, growth in spinal sector revenue was attributed to sales of the Infuse product line and the CD Horizon Legacy Peek Rod System, in addition to the Verte-Stack Crescent Vertebral Body Spacer.\n\nOn the product approval front, in November, the company received FDA approval for the third indication for its Infuse bone graft product--this time for certain oral and maxillofacial bone grafting procedures.\n\nTo add to its bone graft product offerings, the company entered into a development agreement in March with California-based pharmaceutical company OsteoGenix. According to Medtronic, the agreement will enable OsteoGenix to complete preclinical work on its proprietary bone anabolic agent and advance this program through clinical trials, while providing Medtronic an additional source of bone growth therapies for surgeons whose patients require bone-grafting options. Pete Wehrly, Medtronic senior vice president and president of Sofamor Danek, said the partnership would offer a \"new option to patients and one that will nicely complement our existing industry-leading bone growth therapies.\"\n\nAlso in March, the US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled in favor of Medtronic in its ongoing patent litigation against Cross Medical Products, Inc., a subsidiary of Biomet. In its decision, the appeals court ruled that Medtronic's current multi-axial pedicle screw products did not infringe any claim of Cross Medical's US Patent No. 5,474,555. The Medtronic products included the CD Horizon Legacy, Vertex and CD Horizon Sextant multiaxial screw products.\n\nThe original case, which has been going on for many years, involved several patents surrounding spinal surgery. The lower court found in Medtronic's favor in all instances, with the exception of one claim made on the aforementioned patent. This appellate court decision relates to this claim. Medtronic, in turn, asserts that Biomet products infringe certain Medtronic patents, and the company plans to continue to pursue those claims in court.\n\nIn July this year, Medtronic received approval to market the Prestige Cervical Disc. Made of stainless steel, it is the first artificial disc commercially available in the United States for replacing diseased vertebrae in the neck, the company said. The product already had been approved for use in Europe. Prestige is designed to provide certain patients suffering from degenerative disc disease (DDD)--which can cause intolerable neck and/or arm pain--the potential for motion, as well as another option for pain relief and function. Traditional treatment for this condition is spinal fusion, which often can severely limit motion.\n\nAs part of the approval conditions requested by the FDA's review panel in September, Medtronic has agreed to conduct a seven-year post-approval study to evaluate long-term safety and effectiveness. Medtronic also is going to perform a five-year enhanced surveillance study. More than 200,000 cervical procedures are performed each year to relieve compression on the spinal cord or nerve roots and to implant an interbody graft and metal plate to rigidly fuse the vertebrae together, according to Medtronic.\n\nFollowing on the heels of the FDA approval of Prestige, an FDA review panel kept the good news flowing for Medtronic in July with the recommended approval of the company's Bryan Cervical Disc as another treatment option for patients suffering from DDD in the upper part of the spine. Composed of a polyurethane nucleus surrounded by titanium endplates, the device is designed to replicate normal, physiologic motion in the upper spine. Despite the vote in favor of the device, advisory panel members expressed concern that the clinical trials did not prove Medtronic's claims of superiority to traditional spinal fusion procedures.\n\nJason Wittes, analyst for Leerink Swann, said in a CNN interview that the Bryan and Prestige discs could represent \"potentially a billion-dollar market\" for Medtronic, but that it would take years to achieve that level. He said the $7,000 to $10,000 disc replacement procedure would be slow to catch on with insurers and that initial sales growth could be sluggish as a result. \"They're not going to have reimbursement right out of the gate,\" Wittes told CNN/Money. \"It's going to take some time to get the insurers on board.\"\n\nMedtronic currently is waiting for an FDA decision of its Maverick disc for the lower spine. Maverick already is approved in Europe.\n\nIn management news, Medtronic will change at the top when Chief Executive Art Collins retires in August this year. He will be replaced by President and Chief Operating Officer William Hawkins. Collins, who has been with the company since 1992, will remain as chairman until August 2008. He was named CEO in 2001 and became chairman in 2002.\n\n7 Biomet\n\n$2 Billion\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nJeffrey R. Binder, President and CEO\n\nDaniel P. Florin, Sr. VP and CFO\n\nJ. Pat Richardson, VP, Finance and Treasurer\n\nWilliam C. Kolter, President, Orthopedics\n\nGlen A. Kashuba, Sr. VP and President Trauma and Spine\n\nRobert E. Durgin, Corporate VP, Global Regulatory Affairs\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 6,300\n\nHEADOUARTERS: Warsaw, IN\n\nThe past year has been one of change for Biomet Inc. From high-profile management changes, to questions of stock option impropriety, and ongoing takeover deals, Biomet made its fair share of headlines in 2006 and continues to do so in 2007. In the midst of the various corporate intrigue, the Warsaw, IN-based company showed steady, if modest, growth in overall net sales and profits for fiscal year 2006, which ended May 31, 2006.\n\nFor fiscal 2006, Biomet reported $2 billion in net sales, compared to $1.9 billion for 2005. Net income for 2006 was $406 million, up from $351 million for the previous fiscal year. By product segment, reconstructive device sales grew 10% to $1.38 billion; fixation sales increased 2% to $251.4 million; spinal product sales experienced growth of 4% to $222 million; and \"other product\" sales increased 5% to $173 million.\n\nIn particular, Biomet attributed its strong knee sales growth of 14% in the United States and 13% worldwide to continued demand for its Vanguard Complete Knee System and the Oxford Unicompartmental Knee System. In 2006, the company introduced the Vanguard SSK (Super Stabilized Knee) Revision System.\n\nHip sales increased 11% worldwide and 8% in the United States during fiscal year 2006. Hip products driving the year's expansion, according to Biomet, were the [M2.sup.a]-Magnum Large Metal Articulation System, the Taperloc Hip Stem, ArComXL Polyethylene and the [C2.sup.a]Taper Acetabular System. Additionally, ReCap Total Resurfacing System sales were strong in Europe during fiscal year 2006, Biomet said. Also in 2006, Biomet received FDA clearance to market Regenerex acetabular cups and augments, which the company expects to drive increased hip sales this year.\n\nOn the management front, in March 2006, Biomet founder and CEO Dane Miller abruptly resigned. After almost a year without a permanent chief executive, Biomet announced that Jeffrey R. Binder--a 15-year veteran of the orthopedic device industry--would join the company as president, CEO and a member of the board of directors. Binder replaced Daniel Hann, who served as interim chief executive following Miller's departure. Hann later resigned in the wake of stock option backdating improprieties.\n\nWhen a stock option is \"backdated,\" the vesting date is altered to make it more valuable. The process is not illegal if properly documented and reported. An independent committee examined 17,000 grants for about 17 million shares from 1996 to 2006 and found that most options were not priced at fair market value on the date of their respective grants. The committee also said that the chief financial officer and general counsel should have been aware of certain accounting and legal ramifications and that Biomet failed to maintain adequate records.\n\nFollowing the committee's findings, Gregory Hartman, senior vice president of finance and the company's chief financial officer and treasurer, and Hann, executive vice president of administration and a member of the board of directors, resigned in March this year. In June, a former Boston Scientific executive, Daniel Florin, joined Biomet as its new CFO.\n\nMost industry analysts see the stock option probe as having a minor impact on the company's overall performance. It certainly didn't keep Biomet from becoming an attractive takeover target.\n\nIn December 2006, Biomet announced plans to go private after a group of private equity investors (including Dane Miller) agreed to acquire the orthopedic manufacturer for $10.9 billion, beating an offer from orthopedic rival Smith & Nephew. In May, however, the private equity group, called LVB Acquisition (which includes Texas Pacific, Blackstone Group, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co., and Goldman Sachs & Co.), raised the offer to $11.4 billion after Biomet shareholders rejected the initial $10.9 billion offer for being too low. Though the deal still must past muster with the Securities and Exchange Commission, a majority of Biomet shareholders approved the latest offer, the company announced on July 12. Biomet officials expect the deal to be wrapped up by the end of the calendar year.\n\nDespite transitions in leadership and ownership, Biomet remains focused on expansion. In late 2006, the company announced that it allotted $21 million to expand its operations in Warsaw, which is expected to create another 260 jobs in the area. The first part of the plan calls for the company reconfiguring a 30,000-square-foot building to accommodate the company's spinal implant manufacturing operations. The project, which will take about two years, will cost about $4.2 million and create 100 new jobs. Next, the company will construct a 60,000-square-foot addition. This project will take four years to complete, cost $17 million and create a minimum of 160 jobs. As of press time, it's unclear whether the takeover will alter the company's planned facility expansion.\n\nThe company has made numerous changes at its Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine subsidiary, including the appointment of Chuck Niemier, former COO International Operations, as president, and the appointments of a new vice president of finance and vice president of sales.\n\n\"We are also making significant progress with the implementation of a new computer system, sales support systems, the in-sourcing of the manufacture of spinal hardware products and expanding the research and development team,\" said Hann, interim CEO at the time. \"Additionally, since May 31, 2005, the company has eliminated over 330 positions at the former EBI operations. We believe that the new management team and infrastructure changes at Biomet Trauma and Biomet Spine will allow the company to provide greater focus on the spine and trauma markets and to our customers.\"\n\nFor fiscal year 2007 (ended May 31), Biomet increased sales 4% to $2.1 billion. Net income was $336 million, compared to $405 million for fiscal year 2006. Year-end results were a mixed bag of gains and losses, with some significant double-digit drops in key product areas.\n\nReconstructive device sales--knees and hips--increased 9% worldwide during fiscal year 2007 to $1.5 billion. Reconstructive device sales in the United States increased 5%, and international reconstructive device sales increased 14%. Knee sales increased 8% worldwide, while hip sales increased 7%.\n\nExtremity sales increased 14% worldwide and 7% in the United States. Fixation sales decreased 11% worldwide to $225 million, but US sales decreased 17%. Craniomaxillofacial sales increased 2% worldwide and decreased 1% in the United States. Internal fixation sales increased 2% worldwide and decreased 5% in the United States, while external fixation sales decreased 13% worldwide and 17% in the United States. Electrical stimulation device sales decreased 25% both domestically and internationally.\n\nSpinal product sales decreased 7% worldwide to $206 million during fiscal year 2007 and decreased 12% domestically. Sales of spinal implants and orthobiologics for the spine decreased 3% worldwide and in the United States, while spinal stimulation sales decreased 21% worldwide and in the United States.\n\n8 DJO Inc.\n\n$413 Million\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nLes Cross, President and CEO\n\nVickie L.

OF EMPLOYEES: 3,000\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Vista, CA\n\nDJO Inc.--previously DJ Orthopedics before a name change in 2006--is one of the latest medical device companies to get swept up in the markers current private equity frenzy.\n\nIn July this year, the company's board of directors entered merger discussions with ReAble Therapeutics Inc. for $1.18 billion in cash. Including assumed debt, the transaction is valued at about $1.6 billion. Based in Austin, TX, ReAble is a medical device company focused on rehabilitation, pain management, physical therapy and orthopedics. It also is owned by private equity firm the Blackstone Group. Blackstone has committed to provide the financing that ReAble requires to complete the transaction. That said, the purchase of DJO certainly is a strategic growth acquisition for ReAble more so than a strict private equity buyout.\n\nThe deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter, subject to regulatory and DJO shareholder approvals. Terms of the merger agreement allowed DJO to solicit additional bids from third parties for 50 calendar days after July 16. If a rival bid were accepted, DJO would have to pay ReAble a break-up fee of $18.7 million.\n\nDJO specializes in rehabilitation products such as knee braces, pain management devices as well as regeneration and bone growth stimulation products for the non-operative orthopedic and spine markets. The device maker sells its products through agents, distributors and direct sales force to orthopedic and spine surgeons, orthopedic and prosthetic centers, as well as hospitals, physical therapists and other healthcare professionals under the DonJoy, ProCare and Aircast brands.\n\nDJO reported strong financial results for fiscal 2006. Net revenues totaled $413 million, an increase of 44%, compared to $286 million reported for 2005. The company said its domestic rehabilitation, regeneration and international business segments grew by 35%, 16.3% and 144%, respectively. Adjusted net income for the year was $12.3 million, including accounting costs and other fees related to acquisitions as well as a move into new corporate headquarters, compared to $29 million in 2005.\n\n\"Our 2006 results reflect the continuing success of our internal growth initiatives, with added acceleration from our acquisition strategy. For the five-year period ending Dec. 31, 2006, these successful strategies have yielded a compound annual revenue growth rate of 22.6%,\" said Les Cross, president and CEO.\n\nCross added that growth was driven by launching a steady flow of 20 new products, in addition to \"optimizing the size and productivity\" of the company's sales force.\n\nIn April 2006, the company completed the acquisition of Aircast Inc. for approximately $290 million in cash. Aircast, based in Summit, NJ, manufactures orthopedic devices, including ankle bracing products and vascular systems (to prevent deep vein thrombosis following orthopedic surgery) complementary to DJO's current product line. Also in January 2006, the company purchased Axmed, an orthopedic rehabilitation device maker based in France, for $15 million.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2007 (ended March 31), DJO reported net revenue of $115 million, a 39% increase. Net income, however, did not meet the company's expectations at $5.6 million, compared to $6.5 million in 2006.\n\n9 Kyphon\n\n$408 Million\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nRichard W.

DiNello, VP, Research & Development\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 1,200\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Sunnyvale, CA\n\nKyphon, founded in 1994, has made significant strides in its 13-year history. The company, which develops and markets medical devices designed to restore and preserve spinal function and diagnose low back pain using minimally invasive technologies, kicked off 2007 with an impressive acquisition.\n\nIn January, the company closed the purchase of St. Francis Medical Technologies, Inc., a privately held, California-based company that manufactures the X-STOP Interspinous Process Decompression System, the first FDA-approved interspinous process device for treating lumbar spinal stenosis.\n\nThe transaction was expected to broaden the company's portfolio of minimally invasive spine technology by adding the X-STOP to existing KyphX balloon kyphoplasty technologies for repairing vertebral compression fractures and the recently launched Functional Anaesthetic Discography procedure for diagnosing the source of low back pain.\n\nKyphon acquired 100% of the fully diluted equity of St. Francis for $525 million in cash and additional revenue-based contingent payments of up to $200 million payable in either cash or a combination of cash and stock.\n\nThe St. Francis acquisition built on a very successful fiscal 2006 for the company.\n\nFor the year ended Dec. 31, Kyphon reported net sales of $408 million, an increase of 33% compared to the $306 million reported for the same period in 2005. Net income for the year also increased 33% to $39.7 million, compared to net income of $29.8 million. Most of the company's revenues were from domestic sales, but international markets showed significant growth. Net income from US sales was $324 million, and $83.7 million was the result of international operations, representing growth in those markets of 26% and 72%, respectively.\n\n\"Although our business in the US in the fourth quarter was impacted by the uncertainty and distraction created by Medtronic's launch of its Arcuate XP product, we are pleased with our overall performance as our international business saw strong increased procedural penetration in virtually all of its markets,\" said Richard Mott, president and CEO. \"We achieved several milestones in 2006 that we believe will help us attain our growth objectives. Substantial progress was made in the clinical, regulatory and reimbursement environments, including the publication of the first multicenter, prospective, two-year follow-up data for balloon kyphoplasty, a positive recommendation from the UK's National Institute for Clinical Excellence for the balloon kyphoplasty procedure, and the establishment of a Category 1 ICD-9 physician reimbursement procedure code specifically for kyphoplasty by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\"\n\nIn December 2006, Kyphon agreed to acquire the non-vertebroplasty, spine-related product assets and associated intellectual property rights of Disc-O-Tech Medical Technologies Ltd., a privately held Israeli company, for $100 million in cash as purchase consideration. The company also agreed to acquire all of Disc-O-Tech's vertebroplasty assets and related intellectual property rights for a total of another $120 million, payable in three equal annual installments beginning January 2008. An additional $20 million in contingent payments also may be paid based on the development of further technologies.\n\nThe first transaction concerns the B-Twin Expandable Spinal System, which is an expandable interbody device for minimally invasive fusion in patients with degenerative disc disease in the lumbar and cervical spine that currently is CE marked in Europe but not approved for use in the United States. It also includes the SKy Bone Expander System, which is available only outside the United States for use in the treatment of vertebral compression fractures. The second transaction concerns Disc-O-Tech's Confidence Cement System.\n\nThe first quarter of 2007 (ended March 31) continued Kyphon's strong performance. Worldwide net sales reached $128 million (a 40% increase), which includes $18 million of X-STOP product sales. US revenue increased 34% to $101 million, while total international revenues increased 70% to $27 million. Revenue from Kyphon's spinal motion preservation and disc disease diagnosis and therapies businesses, which includes the X-STOP IPD, Aperius Percutaneous Lumbar Interspinous Decompression and Functional Anaesthetic Discography technologies, was $14.3 million in the United States and $4.2 million in international markets.\n\nThe company reported that its core spinal fracture management and repair business revenue grew 20% to $110 million. Despite the sales surge, Kyphon still reported a net loss of $22 million compared to net income of $8.5 million for the same period a year ago. The reported loss per share includes $40.5 million pre-tax and $31.9 million after-tax, in-process research and development charges and acquisition-related expenses related to the St. Francis acquisition.\n\nIn the first quarter, the health insurance company Aetna, Inc. published national coverage for kyphoplasty, which the company hopes will generate more sales. The company also launched its Aperius PercLID system for the treatment of mild to moderate lumber spinal stenosis (LSS) in select European markets. The device, which received the CE Mark in October 2006, is a percutaneous solution used to treat LSS.\n\nFor the complete fiscal year, the company expects net sales to increase 40% to 43%, reaching $570 million to $585 million.\n\n10 Orthofix\n\n$365 Million\n\nKEY EXECUTIVES:\n\nAlan W. Milinazzo, Group President and CEO\n\nThomas Hein, CFO\n\nScott Dodson, President, Orthopedic Division\n\nOliver Burckhard, President, International Division\n\nMatt Lyons, President and CEO, Blackstone Medical\n\nNO. OF EMPLOYEES: 1,900\n\nHEADQUARTERS: Curacao, Netherlands Antilles\n\nFounded in 1980, Orthofix seems to have made strategic acquisitions part of its formula for steady growth--particularly since the early 1990s. The 2006 fiscal year proved to be no exception. The company, headquartered in the Netherlands Antilles (with corporate administrative offices located in Huntersville, NC, a suburb of Charlotte), acquired Blackstone Medical in September 2006 for $333 million.\n\nBased in Springfield, MA, Blackstone Medical (not to be confused with the private equity firm named Blackstone) merged its spinal implants and related biologic products with Orthofix's spinal stimulation business. For 2007, the company expects its newly expanded spinal division to generate $260 million in revenue.\n\nThe addition of Blackstone's product line provides Orthofix with several new device offerings, including cervical and lumbar plates and other fixation systems that incorporate the use of metal bracing and pedicle screws to stabilize the spine; interbody devices and vertebral body replacements used to restore the space between two vertebrae that has been lost as a result of degenerative disc disease or to replace the damaged vertebrae; and the only commercially available adult stem cell-based biologic bone grafting product for the growth of new bone around the spine.\n\nFor fiscal year 2006 (ended Dec. 31), revenue totaled $365 million, including Blackstone's fourth-quarter contribution of $28 million, an increase of 17% compared to 2005. Notably, fourth-quarter revenue was a record $116.1 million, an increase of 45%.\n\nThe company, however, reported a net loss of $7 million, largely due to costs incurred during the Blackstone purchase, according to Orthofix. Excluding the impact of purchase accounting costs associated with the Blackstone acquisition as well as certain other items, the company said adjusted net income was $36.7 million.\n\n\"Orthofix's results in the fourth quarter were, once again, in line with our expectations, with each of our business sectors reporting sales growth compared with the prior year,\" said CEO Alan Milinazzo. \"In addition to strong quarterly results from Blackstone, we continue to be encouraged by the improved performance of our other operations, including our orthopedics and sports medicine businesses.\"\n\nSpine sales for 2006 were $145.1 million, including Blackstone, which was a 43% increase compared to 2005. Excluding Blackstone, the company's spine revenues grew 15% compared to 2005.\n\nOrthopedic revenue for the full year 2006 was $95.8 million, an increase of 4%. Growth, the company said, was driven by higher sales in each of its three main product areas, including internal and external fixation devices, deformity correction products and bone-growth stimulators. The company's sports medicine division reported $79 million in net sales for 2006, an increase of 8%. Orthofix's sports medicine subsidiary, BREG, Inc. (acquired in December 2003) produces devices for functional knee bracing.\n\nFor 2007, the company is off to a strong start.\n\nIn February, Orthofix launched two new internal nailing systems. The VeroNail is a trochanteric nailing system for the treatment of hip fractures, and the Centronail is a new family of nails designed to reduce operating room time and increase surgeon flexibility during the treatment of long bone fractures such as those in the tibia or the humerus, according to the company.\n\nFor the first quarter of fiscal 2007 (ended March 31), Orthofix reported revenue of $117 million, an increase of 44%, thanks largely to its most recent acquisition. Reported first quarter earnings were $6.3 million.\n\nFirst-quarter sales for the company's spine sector grew 101% to $56.1 million. Implant and biologic revenues from Blackstone were $26.4 million, which was an increase of 43% compared with its first-quarter sales in 2006, prior to the acquisition by Orthofix. This growth was due to higher sales of implant products, including Icon minimally invasive pedicle screw systems, Unity anterior lumbar plating systems, Construx vertebral body replacement devices and Pillar interbody devices, the company said.\n\nAdditionally, revenue from Blackstone's biologic portfolio increased as a result of higher sales of Trinity bone growth matrix.
