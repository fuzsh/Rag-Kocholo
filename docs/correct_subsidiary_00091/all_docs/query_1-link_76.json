Any request for us to enter into a transaction with an executive officer, director, principal stockholder or any of such persons’ immediate family members, other than a transaction available to all employees generally or involving less than $5,000 when aggregated with similar transactions, must be presented to our audit committee for review, consideration and approval, unless the transaction involves an employment or other compensatory arrangement approved by our Compensation Committee. All of our directors, executive officers and employees are required to report to our audit committee any such related person transaction. In approving or rejecting the proposed agreement, our audit committee will take into account, among other factors it deems appropriate, whether the proposed related person transaction is on terms no less favorable than terms generally available to an unaffiliated third party under the same or similar circumstances, the extent of the person’s interest in the transaction and, if applicable, the impact on a director’s independence. After consideration of these and other factors, the audit committee may approve or reject the transaction. Consistent with the policy, if we should discover related person transactions that have not been approved, the audit committee will be notified and will determine the appropriate action, including ratification, rescission or amendment of the transaction.\n\nRelated Person Transactions\n\nThe following is a description of transactions since January 1, 2015 to which we have been a party, in which the amount involved in the transaction exceeds $87,518, which is 1% of the average of our total assets at year-end for our 2015 and 2016 fiscal years, and in which any of our executive officers, directors and principal stockholders, including their immediate family members, had or will have a direct or indirect material interest. All information presented below gives retroactive effect to the Reverse Split.\n\nIn December 2015, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors for the sale of shares of our common stock, Series A Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in a private placement offering. In the offering, we sold to the investors 407,731 shares of common stock, together with Series A Warrants to purchase 163,092 shares of common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase 122,319 shares of common stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of $5,294,000. The Series A Warrants were fully vested and exercisable upon issuance, have a term of five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $16.23 per share. The Series B Warrants were fully vested and exercisable upon issuance, have a term of five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $21.10 per share.\n\n17\n\nOur placement agents for the financing, together with the sub-agents it engaged, collectively received Placement Agent Warrants to purchase up to 40,773 shares of our common stock. The Placement Agent Warrants have the same exercise price and substantially the same terms and conditions as the Series A Warrants, except that the Placement Agent Warrants have a terms of seven and one-half years. The placement agents also earned aggregate commissions of $380,120.83 from the December 2015 PIPE financing. Our Chief Executive Officer and director, Francis P. Grillo, one of our non-employee directors, Timothy T. Richards, a foundation for which another of our non-employee directors, Andrew K. Rooke, serves as president, and a trust for which another of our non-employee directors, Charles E. Koob, serves as trustee invested, in the aggregate, $475,000 in the offering and acquired, in the aggregate, 36,583 shares of our common stock, Series A Warrants to purchase 14,633 shares of our common stock and Series B Warrants to purchase 10,975 shares of our common stock.\n\nIn September 2016, we entered into a securities purchase agreement with certain investors for the sale of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock in a private placement offering. In the offering, we sold to the investors 851,000 shares of common stock, together with warrants to purchase 765,900 shares of common stock, for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately $4.25 million. The warrants were fully vested and exercisable upon issuance, have a term of five years from the date of issuance and have an exercise price of $5.50 per share. Our Chief Executive Officer and director, Francis P. Grillo, a trust for which another of our non-employee directors, Andrew K. Rooke, serves as trustee, and Voyager Therapeutics, Inc. and Bruce C. Conway, each a beneficial owner of more than five percent of our common stock, invested $2,350,000 in the offering and acquired, in the aggregate, 470,000 shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase 423,000 shares of our common stock. In addition, under the terms of an amendment we entered into on August 31, 2016 with two holders of our 12% Second-Priority Secured Non-Convertible Promissory Notes Due 2019 and two common stock warrants issued by us in connection therewith (the “2014 Note Holders”), we sold an aggregate of 350,000 units (consisting of shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase shares of our common stock) to the 2014 Note Holders simultaneously with the September 2016 sale of the common stock and warrants described herein. As a result, $1.75 million of the aggregate principal balance of these holders’ notes automatically converted into 350,000 units on the same terms and conditions as in the transactions contemplated by the securities purchase agreement, and the exercise price for 13,125 shares of common stock that may be purchased upon exercise of the holders’ warrants was reduced to $5.50 per share.\n\nWe adopted, with an effective date in September 2006 and as amended in June 2010 and June 2013, the Key Personnel Incentive Program, or the KPIP, to provide a consultant and a then-employee who, at the time of adoption of the KPIP, were key to our development and licensing activities, with the opportunity to receive incentive bonus payments upon a consummation of a sale transaction, as defined in the KPIP. The Compensation Committee is responsible for administering the program, and the only participants in the program are Paul A. Bottomley and Parag Karmarkar. The program will terminate on the earlier of December 31, 2025 or the occurrence of a sale transaction.\n\nIn the event of a sale transaction, each of the participants will be entitled to receive a bonus payment under the program as of the date of the transaction. Mr. Karmarkar would receive a bonus equal to $1,000,000. Dr. Bottomley would receive a bonus equal to: (1) $1,000,000, plus (2) 1.4% of the amount by which the “net proceeds” from the sale transaction exceed $50,000,000, but not to exceed $700,000. For purposes of the KPIP, the “net proceeds” from a sale transaction will be the portion of the aggregate cash and non-cash consideration paid or payable in connection with the consummation of the sale transaction that is distributed, or otherwise available for distribution, to holders of our common stock.\n\nIndemnification Agreements\n\nIn addition to the indemnification provided for in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws, we have entered into separate indemnification agreements with each of our directors and executive officers. These indemnification agreements may require us, among other things, to indemnify our directors and officers for some expenses, including attorneys’ fees, judgments, fines and settlement amounts incurred by a director or officer in any action or proceeding arising out of his or her service as one of our directors or officers, or any of our subsidiaries or any other company or enterprise to which the person provides services at our request. We believe that these provisions and agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified individuals to serve as directors and officers. There is no pending litigation or proceeding involving any of our directors or officers to which indemnification is required or permitted, and we are not aware of any threatened litigation or proceeding that may result in a claim for indemnification.\n\n18\n\nDirector Independence\n\nWe have not listed, nor do we have an outstanding application to list, our securities on a national securities exchange which has requirements that a majority of our Board be independent. However, for purposes of determining director independence, we have adopted the provisions of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. Our Board undertook a review of the composition of our Board and its Committees and the independence of each director. Based upon information requested from and provided by each director concerning his or her background, employment and affiliations, including family relationships, our Board has determined that none of Dr. Pizzo, Ms. Sainz or Messrs. Girin, Koob, Rooke, Richards or Spencer, representing seven of our nine directors, has a relationship that would interfere with the exercise of independent judgment in carrying out the responsibilities of a director and that each of these directors is “independent” as that term is defined under Rule 5605(a)(2) of the Nasdaq Marketplace Rules. In addition, our Board has determined that each of the foregoing directors meets the independence and other requirements, including the Audit Committee membership independence requirements, needed to serve on the Committees of the Board for which they serve. In making such determinations, our Board considered the relationships that each such director has with us and all other facts and circumstances the Board deemed relevant in determining independence, including the beneficial ownership of our capital stock by each director.\n\nITEM 14.
