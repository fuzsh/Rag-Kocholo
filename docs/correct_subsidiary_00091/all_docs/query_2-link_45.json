He is currently on the board of May Health and SafeHeal, two companies in the portfolio of Sofinnova's medtech incubator strategy, MD Start.\n\n\"I share Sofinnova’s passion for finding, nurturing and bringing new medical device therapies to patients,\" Weiss said when he was appointed Venture Partner.\" Having worked both informally and as a portfolio company CEO with Sofinnova for the past 20 years, I know that they have the best team, and are the gold-standard medical device venture group.\"\n\nIn 2013, Andrew was brought in as CEO to lead ReCor Medical, a company founded in 2009 by Mano Iyer, then an entrepreneur in residence at Sofinnova and now a partner in the Sofinnova medtech acceleration team. Mr. Weiss led ReCor, a pioneer in the use of ultrasound renal denervation to treat hypertension, as it scaled up to 175 employees, went through its clinical trials and was purchased by Otsuka Medical Devices in 2018.

I’ve delivered results across all geographies and senior roles including some of the most technically demanding and hard to fill positions.\n\nBefore moving into executive search I worked as a senior executive leading the commercial operations of a US medical device company, Alveolus Inc. I led the business from start-up to product launch over three years, culminating in a successful trade sale.\n\nPrior to my career in healthcare, I was a professional sportsman, representing an England XV and the Barbarians at rugby union. The successful transition from professional rugby player to business leader has made use of many common skills and disciplines. Both professional sport and executive search demand a capacity to deal with significant individual and team pressures, requiring self-discipline and sacrifice combined with a desire to learn and adapt.\n\nI offer a unique blend of life experiences gained through such a varied and highly successful career.\n\n“I did then what I knew how to do. Now that I know better, I do better.” – Maya Angelou\n\nThe beauty of what Maya Angelou is highlighting is people’s ability to learn and improve.

I have learned so many technical and soft skills working on many challenging, real-world engineering problems (water-resistant ankle foot orthotic, wearable finger force sensors, etc.) and I am excited to never stop learning.\n\nMy compass in all that I do has always been about engaging with people, from running my own swim school and teaching lessons to people of all ages, to conducting my masters research on underrepresented injuries in the wrist. Now, as Vessl's CEO, I am passionate about designing for the end user, engaging the end user early in the design process and keep their needs paramount throughout.\n\nI am an outgoing and natural born leader and have taken many opportunities to hone my leadership skills, such as mentoring my peers during my master’s work and holding a presidential role in two undergraduate clubs, and now leading Vessl.\n\nWith a unique blend of visionary leadership and artistic insight, Per Langoe defines success beyond cutting-edge products. It’s about fostering a culture of innovation, nurturing our people, and refining our process to break down barriers. He believes that by comprehensively assessing the landscape of life sciences, identifying the issues and roadblocks impeding patient success, and innovating solutions to surmount those barriers, we can truly make a difference.\n\nMr. Langoe brings more than 20 years of experience successfully managing commercial, clinical, M&A, and other functions at MedTech companies such as Parmacia Corporation, Q-Med, Galderma and Nestlé Skin Health.\n\nMost recently, Mr. Langoe was the co-founder, President and CEO of Palette Life Sciences, a fully integrated global life sciences company dedicated to improving patient outcomes. Under Per’s leadership, the Palette team successfully designed and navigated a complex randomized controlled trial and subsequent regulatory approval process. Following product approval, the company commercialized the product to a multi-disciplinary set of clinicians, with particular emphasis on radiation oncologists, and the product’s rapid adoption led to the company’s acquisition by Teleflex in 2023\n\nAs an avid art collector, Per has seen many beautiful things, but one image stays with him. In his early days, working with an intraocular eye lens company he interviewed a patient in her mid 80s who cried tears of joy because she could now actually see her grandchildren again. Profound patient experiences like this is what propels Per’s commitment to advance the mission of improving the lives of patients with brain tumor at GT Medical Technologies.\n\nPer received an MSc in Business Studies and Economics with a major in Business Studies, and a BSc in Business Administration and Economics with a major in International Business Studies, from Uppsala University in Sweden.\n\nMs. Farrar has 40 years of experience as an attorney representing companies in the medical device and pharmaceutical fields.

He is also co-founder and CEO of Fluid Biomed Inc., a venture-backed medical device startup company that is commercializing innovative brain stent technology.\n\nLeading the team aiming to bring to market the solution to end the chronic wound epidemic. This devastating condition affects the elderly and those who suffer from comorbidities such as diabetes and vascular disease. Many patients with chronic wounds not only bear the physical pain of their medical condition, but also are often isolated and sequestered to their beds due to off-loading protocols. Their lives are severely disrupted and patients often spend hundreds of dollars a month out of their own pocket to cover materials needed to care for their wounds. The psychological pain and fear of amputation are the silent companions of their suffering.\n\nThe statistics point to injustices as African-American patients receive amputations at twice the rate of their white counterparts. For patients with vascular disease and chronic wounds, their 5-year mortality rate rivals the five-year mortality rates of cancer patients. Yet, because chronic wounds are not a branded disease and receive little fan fair, few research dollars flow to solve this crisis that is at epidemic levels.\n\nPreviously a founding member of Pearl Capital Advisors LLC—an award-winning investment management firm specializing in volatility-based investments where, as CIO, I led investment research, risk management, and marketing efforts for Pearl’s investment strategies.\n\nBrian Stewart is the founder and Chief Executive Officer of Tally Surgical, Inc.
