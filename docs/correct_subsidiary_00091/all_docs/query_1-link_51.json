(OTC PINK: MDXG) (“MiMedx” or “the Company”), an industry leader in advanced wound care and an emerging therapeutic biologics company, today announced the closing of concurrent $150 million private equity and debt financings, consisting of an equity financing pursuant to a Securities Purchase Agreement with an entity controlled by EW Healthcare Partners and certain funds managed by Hayfin Capital Management LLP (“Hayfin”), and a debt financing pursuant to a Loan Agreement with Hayfin. As part of the transaction, EW Healthcare Partners has designated Martin P. Sutter and William A. Hawkins III to serve on the Company’s board as preferred directors.\n\nTimothy R. Wright, MiMedx Chief Executive Officer, commented, “Obtaining this critical financing is a clear turning point for the Company. The additional resources provide us with the ability to strengthen areas critical to stabilizing the business, prioritize investments that enhance our Research & Development, Manufacturing, and Commercial organizations, and pursue the attractive growth opportunities afforded by the Company's amniotic tissue products and know-how. Moreover, the affirmation of the strength of our new leadership team and future prospects from one of the nation’s top healthcare-specific investors is a meaningful endorsement of the Company’s progress and efforts to return to the patient-centered mission of innovation that helps people heal.”\n\nM. Kathleen Behrens, Ph.D., Chair of the MiMedx Board of Directors, added, “This transaction marks the culmination of an extensive review of potential financing alternatives by the Board, in consultation with the Company’s advisors, which included a leading investment bank with in-depth, industry-specific expertise. A new leadership team, new board members, and now the opportunity to welcome these accomplished and well-regarded leaders to our Board of Directors, each demonstrate great progress toward transforming and positioning the Company for the future.”\n\nMartin P. Sutter, Co-Founder and a Managing Director of EW Healthcare Partners, said: “EW Healthcare Partners is delighted to become a significant shareholder in MiMedx. We are very impressed with the entire senior management team and Board of Directors, and the tremendous work they are doing to transform the Company. We are aligned with the Company’s vision and look forward to assisting the team in regaining its leadership position in the attractive and growing advanced wound care space.”\n\nWilliam A. Hawkins III, Senior Advisor to EW Healthcare Partners, added, “The new management team and board members have made great progress in transforming the enterprise and positioning the Company for continued success. MiMedx has long been a leader in bringing forth innovative solutions for the advanced wound care market, and I look forward to partnering with Tim Wright and the entire management team to support the Company’s growth and strategic priorities to improve patient care.”\n\nEquity Investment\n\nUnder the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Company is issuing shares of a newly created Series B Convertible Preferred Stock for an aggregate purchase price of $100,000,000 (the “Equity Investment”), with $90,000,000 being made by an entity controlled by EW Healthcare Partners and $10,000,000 being made by Hayfin. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock, together with any accrued and unpaid dividends thereon, may be converted into Company common stock at any time at a conversion price of $3.85 per share of Company common stock. The Series B Convertible Preferred Stock carries a cumulative annual dividend of 4% for the first 12 months following the closing and 6% thereafter.\n\nDebt Financing\n\nUnder the Loan Agreement, Hayfin is providing MiMedx with a five-year term loan facility (the “Term Loan Facility”) in the aggregate principal amount of $50 million, the full amount of which is being borrowed and funded, and a one-year, delayed draw term loan facility in the aggregate principal amount of $25 million, which is not currently being drawn or funded. The Facilities bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.5%) plus a margin of 6.75%. The margin will be eligible to decrease to 6.5% or 6.0% after December 31, 2020, based on future total net leverage levels.\n\nThe Loan Agreement does not include any equity or equity-linked component.\n\nUse of Proceeds\n\nThe aggregate proceeds of the Equity Investment and the Term Loan Facility have been or will be used (i) to repay the outstanding principal, interest, and prepayment premium resulting from the early termination of the Company’s Term Loan Agreement with Blue Torch Finance LLC, (ii) for working capital and general corporate purposes, and (iii) to pay transaction fees, costs and expenses incurred in connection with the Equity Investment, the Term Loan Facility and the related transactions.\n\nBackground of the Transactions\n\nAs will be more fully described within Item 7 of the Company’s 2019 Annual Report on Form 10-K, during the last two years the Company has experienced a decline in sales and significant non-business expenses, and expects to continue to incur such expenses over the near term and mid-term. In addition, as previously disclosed, the Company required additional capital to implement its strategic plan, including for enhancements to its manufacturing plant to meet current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) requirements, for clinical trials to support Investigational New Drug (IND) and Biologics License Applications (BLAs), to mitigate other risks, and to address ongoing spend for legal matters (including under contractual indemnification requirements for former officers).\n\nThe Company held discussions with more than 20 potential financing sources, and after thoroughly evaluating multiple proposals received and carefully considering various financing alternatives, the Board unanimously approved the Equity Investment and the Term Loan Facility.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nFurther details regarding the Securities Purchase Agreement, the Loan Agreement and the termination of the Blue Torch Term Loan Agreement will be contained in MiMedx’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019 or a Current Report on Form 8-K that the Company will be filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”).
