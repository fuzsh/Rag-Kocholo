The following presentation will walk you through this minimally invasive procedure step by step. For more information and to watch a video of the procedure, please visit www.spinalfracture.com\n\n3. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Radiologic Assesment This is what the fracture looks like with X-ray and MRI First week post fracture Eight weeks post fracture MRI: T2 Image\n\n4. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Location of Incisions Fractured vertebral body (side view) Your physician will make small incisions over the fracture site(s) on your back.\n\n5. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Placement of Balloons Balloon catheters are inserted into the incisions and into the body of the affected vertebra.\n\n6. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Balloons are Inflated The balloons are inflated with a liquid visible under X-ray guidance inside the collapsed vertebra. This creates a cavity and helps restore the vertebra body height.\n\n7. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Removal of Balloons and Filling of Cement The physician then deflates and removes the balloons leaving an open cavity. Bone cement is then inserted through the catheters into the open cavity.\n\n8. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Internal Cast to Support and Stabilize Once the cement is carefully in place the catheters are removed and the cement hardens in minutes creating an “internal cast”.\n\n9. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Balloon Kyphoplasty Case Study Patient: 61 YO Female Diagnosis: Multiple Myeloma Fracture Reduced: T11, L2, 1 1/2 years old\n\n10. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Balloon Kyphoplasty Case Study Patient: 84 YO Female Diagnosis: Primary Osteoporosis Fracture Reduced: T8, 3 weeks old\n\n11. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step Case Study: Correction of Angular Deformity Immediate post fracture Post fracture + 4 days Post kyphoplasty Kyphosis = 16˚ Kyphosis = 25˚ Kyphosis = 10˚\n\n12. KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty: Step-by-Step KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty KYPHON® Balloon Kyphoplasty is • Typically takes less than an hour per fracture designed to repair spinal fractures treated and has been proven to result in • Performed under local or general anesthesia the following benefits:1,2 and may require an overnight hospital stay, as determined by your doctor • Restoration of vertebral body height and • Most patients recover well and return to normal angular deformity activities within a few days • Significant reduction in back pain • Covered by Medicare and private insurance • Significant improvement in quality of life carriers in most cases • Significant improvement in mobility • Improved ability to perform activities of daily living, such as walking, hobbies, and work • Low complication rate\n\n13.
