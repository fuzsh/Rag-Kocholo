        "text": "<strong>The</strong> <strong>Year</strong> <strong>in</strong> Review – Anyth<strong>in</strong>g <strong>but</strong> <strong>Dull</strong> This past year brought with it plenty of anticipated and unanticipated excitement <strong>in</strong> all areas of orthopaedics – a super large merger, the largest private equity transaction <strong>in</strong> history, a government <strong>in</strong>vestigation that brought more than $300 million to Medicare’s coffers and keeps go<strong>in</strong>g for more, new and young CEOs at four of the largest orthopaedic companies, more porous metals and gender-based <strong>in</strong>itiatives, cervical discs, hefty patent <strong>in</strong>fr<strong>in</strong>gement payouts…Here’s a brief review of happen<strong>in</strong>gs <strong>in</strong> 2007. Biomet Goes Private and Smith & Nephew Rises to #4 Position <strong>in</strong> Jo<strong>in</strong>t Replacement Two of the largest deals <strong>in</strong> orthopaedic history occurred <strong>in</strong> 2007 – a private equity consortium’s purchase of Biomet for more than $11 billion and Medtronic’s acquisition of Kyphon for more than $4 billion. <strong>The</strong> Biomet purchase changed some key faces <strong>in</strong>side the company and set a new course for the company, particularly with<strong>in</strong> its EBI division. <strong>The</strong> Medtronic (MDT) purchase of Kyphon solidly positions MDT <strong>in</strong> the realm of vertebral compression fracture (VCF) repair and treatment for sp<strong>in</strong>al stenosis, the latter thanks to Kyphon’s acquisition of St. Francis early <strong>in</strong> the year. At year’s end, Kyphon completed its purchase of the non-vertebroplasty assets of Disc-O-Tech Medical Technologies and entered <strong>in</strong>to a def<strong>in</strong>itive agreement to divest all assets relat<strong>in</strong>g to the Disc-O-Tech Confidence VCF product l<strong>in</strong>e. Those assets became part of the DePuy Sp<strong>in</strong>e franchise. In other M&A activities, Tornier expanded its small bone bus<strong>in</strong>ess with acquisitions of Nexa Orthopedics and DVO Extremity Solutions. Wright Medical also beefed up its small bone franchise with purchases of Darco International’s reconstructive foot surgery bus<strong>in</strong>ess, the BIO-ARCH subtalar implant from Metasurg and certa<strong>in</strong> foot- and ankle-focused external fixation assets from R&R Medical. At the same time, Wright divested of its Adcon-L by sell<strong>in</strong>g the sp<strong>in</strong>al adhesion barrier gel to aap. Aap completed its acquisition of all shares <strong>in</strong> FAME Hold<strong>in</strong>g and its subsidiaries and renamed itself aap BioImplants, bespeak<strong>in</strong>g its new focus on biomaterials. Integra’s purchase of IsoTis also centered on biologics and will help the company build its burgeon<strong>in</strong>g orthobiologics/sp<strong>in</strong>al franchise with one of the largest biologics distri<strong>but</strong>ion networks <strong>in</strong> the U.S. Another biologics move came when Pioneer Surgical Technology acquired Angstrom Medica, whose products <strong>in</strong>clude nanocrystall<strong>in</strong>e calcium phosphate with application <strong>in</strong> trauma, sp<strong>in</strong>e and general orthopaedics. ReAble cont<strong>in</strong>ues to build a solid rehabilitation franchise, this time add<strong>in</strong>g DJO to its coffers <strong>in</strong> a $1.6 billion deal. A smaller rehab deal came with BSN’s purchase of FLA Orthopedics. <strong>The</strong> merger of INBONE Technologies and Reiley Orthopaedic comb<strong>in</strong>ed a total ankle with a titanium <strong>in</strong>tramedullary fusion system. Kensey’s acquisition of Cytori’s MacroPore Biosurgery sp<strong>in</strong>al and orthopaedic bus<strong>in</strong>ess unit broadened its reach <strong>in</strong> resorbable technologies, while Exactech’s decision to acquire sp<strong>in</strong>e-focused Altiva took it <strong>in</strong>to the realm of sp<strong>in</strong>e for the first time. Also <strong>in</strong> sp<strong>in</strong>e, Zimmer bought Endius and added solid computer-assisted sur- 50 Orthopaedic Product News • January/February 2008 FISCAL FITNESS Author: Shirley A. Engelhardt gery expertise with its purchase of ORTHOsoft. F<strong>in</strong>ally, Smith & Nephew’s $889 million acquisition of Plus expanded its presence <strong>in</strong> Europe and helped the company displace Biomet as the 4th largest jo<strong>in</strong>t replacement company <strong>in</strong> the world. Biologics and Sp<strong>in</strong>e Deals Dom<strong>in</strong>ate the Landscape S<strong>in</strong>ce many companies had neither the funds nor the <strong>in</strong>cl<strong>in</strong>ation to spend millions or billions of dollars on a Plus or a Kyphon, a variety of strategic partnerships arose <strong>in</strong> product development, distri<strong>but</strong>ion, collaborations, etc. For example, with its 2006 move away from Medtronic and Exactech as its exclusive partners for distri<strong>but</strong>ion of certa<strong>in</strong> of its tissuebased products, Regeneration Technologies (RTI) was able to <strong>in</strong>k deals with Wright Medical (xenograft implants for foot and ankle surgeries), Stryker (Bio-Cleanse-sterilized sp<strong>in</strong>al allografts) and Zimmer (next generation allograft paste). RTI also made a deal with CryoLife for the latter to cease distri<strong>but</strong><strong>in</strong>g orthopaedic tissues and at year’s end, entered <strong>in</strong>to a def<strong>in</strong>itive agreement with Tutogen to merge. Other orthobiologics deals ranged from Bonesupport’s agreement with Signus for distri<strong>but</strong>ion of Cerament bone void filler <strong>in</strong> certa<strong>in</strong> states to Kensey Nash’s development of bone void fillers for Biomet, MIV <strong>The</strong>rapeutics’ collaboration with Smith & Nephew for new hydroxyapatite-based coat<strong>in</strong>gs and drug delivery systems and Sp<strong>in</strong>al Restoration and Baxter evaluat<strong>in</strong>g Tisseel fibr<strong>in</strong> sealant as part of the Biostat Disc Augmentation System. Among deals <strong>in</strong> the orthopaedic space, those related to sp<strong>in</strong>e dom<strong>in</strong>ated the scene <strong>in</strong> 2007, as has been the case for a number of years. Alliances formed between Altiva and NAS Medical; Medtronic and Takiron; NuVasive and <strong>The</strong>ken; Smith & Nephew and Teknimed; Sp<strong>in</strong>eSource and A-Sp<strong>in</strong>e, Anatomica and Creasp<strong>in</strong>e; and X-Sp<strong>in</strong>e and Highland Medical. <strong>The</strong> most action <strong>in</strong> alliances and <strong>in</strong> sp<strong>in</strong>e, however, came through Alphatec. Dur<strong>in</strong>g 2007, the company signed license agreements with Scient’x, Roger Jackson, M.D., Stout Medical, JGMG Bengochea and Progressive Sp<strong>in</strong>al Technologies for a variety of products from dynamic stabilization systems to an expandable titanium cage. Sp<strong>in</strong>e aside, alliances were reached for computer assisted surgical technologies (Acrobot/Stanmore, Zimmer/ORTHOsoft), diagnostics (Axial Biotech/DePuy), imag<strong>in</strong>g (Medtronic/Breakaway Imag<strong>in</strong>g), jo<strong>in</strong>t replacement (Biomet/Massachusetts General Hospital, Cor<strong>in</strong>/Stryker), neuromonitor<strong>in</strong>g (MDT/Axon), orthopaedic support devices (Enova Medical/Product Innovations, m<strong>in</strong>Surg/Bauerfe<strong>in</strong>d), pa<strong>in</strong> management (Synergetics/Stryker) and small bone products (Bioretec/Nexa, Integra/InteliFUSE, Small Bone Innovations/Euromedic, Implants International and LITOS, Wright Medical/aap and A.M. Surgical). On the sale side of th<strong>in</strong>gs, Xylos divested of its wound care bus<strong>in</strong>ess to accelerate product development with particular focus on musculoskeletal repair.
