        "text": "As a Team Leader and Organizational Development and Transformation specialist, led a series of product, technology and process-based projects to help the company, its culture and systems transform to become the global leader in interventional cardiology. The company grew from $200M to over $2B during the course of his employment there, and he was front and center on many fronts, technically and organizationally, working with some of the most amazing staff on the planet to make this happen. Within a short time of his leaving, ACS/GUIDANT was purchased by Abbott for $27B, which to this day, is the world record in medical device acquisitions.\n\nLed and performed a complete reconstruction of the company’s Design History Files 2 months prior to an FDA Audit, which incidentally, was attempting to shut the company down due to some patient deaths (which were soon clearly shown were not at all due to the company’s product).\n\nWithin 4 months of my starting, the company went through a round of competitive bidding which resulted in a purchase by Kyphon for $725M (a record for spine/orthopedic companies in the Bay Area), which was then 6 months later purchased by Medtronic for $3.3B.\n\nWorking 1:1 with the physician founder, helped to hand design, invent, hand build and hand test in animal studies a novel catheter based ablation system. Worked closely with various contract manufacturers to help build the devices on less than a shoe-string budget."
