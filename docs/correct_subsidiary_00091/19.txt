Kyphon Inc. has signed a definitive agreement to acquire St. Francis Medical Technologies Inc., the privately held company that manufactures the X-Stop Interspinous Process Decompression System, Kyphon officials announced.

The X-Stop implant is the first FDA-approved interspinous process device indicated for treating lumbar spinal stenosis. With the acquisition, Kyphon will add the X-Stop implant to its minimally invasive spinal product portfolio, which includes the KyphX balloon kyphoplasty technologies for repairing vertebral compression fractures and the Functional Anaesthetic Discography procedure for diagnosing discogenic pain.

Under the agreement, Kyphon will acquire 100% of the fully diluted equity of St. Francis for $525 million in cash payable upon closing. Beginning no earlier than 2008, it will also make additional revenue-based contingent payments of up to $200 million, according to a press release from Kyphon.

"This acquisition directly supports our stated strategy of bringing minimally invasive spine therapies to our markets and adds an innovative new product platform," Richard Mott, president and chief executive officer of Kyphon, said in the release. "This acquisition will leverage the strong distribution capabilities of our direct sales organization and provide another growth engine for delivering enhanced value to our shareholders."

The acquisition remains subject to governmental regulatory review and other customary closing conditions, which Kyphon officials expect to receive during the first quarter of 2007, according to the release.

Upon closing, Kyphon expects to incur an estimated one-time pre-tax charge of about $35 million to $50 million for in-process research and development. Company officials also anticipate the transaction to dilute 2007 GAAP earnings by about $0.15 to $0.20 per share, but beginning in 2008, they expect the transaction to be significantly accretive to GAAP earnings, according to the release.
