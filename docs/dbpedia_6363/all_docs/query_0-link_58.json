        "text": "1. Researching Methods and Techniques A New ‘James Bond’ Film By Sarah Innes\n\n2. Target Audience My target audience for the new James Bond movie would carry on from the previous audience and fans from the earlier movies. The success of the movies has gathered many more followers from across the world, even though a new James Bond movie will instantly be a topic of interest amount the public the movie still has to be at a excellent quality to attract the target audience. The audience for these bond movies expect high end quality and new interesting plot lines, as this movie has been carried on for many year it still has to reflect the traditional values but show case the new technologies of the new film making world. With this in mind the primary audience is young males due to the amount of action which is included, even though this film is targeted at the male population young girls are also interested in the movie as well as the 40-50 age range who grew up with the original Bond movies of the 60's and 70's. The target audience for the new film will over 18, many of the product placements of the previous films such as 1997's Tomorrow Never Dies included Heineken Beer, with the drinking age in the UK being 18 it shows that the Producers and the Beer company expect people in their 20s + to see the film and connect with the placements. Another incentive to have the target audience in their 20’s and more so targeted at males due to the about of the product place Aston Martin is seen in many of the action scenes, this shows how the car makers understand that the audience of the film will connect to the conation of the car being a spy car which will attract the older males to buy the new range of car. According to the Spokeswomen of Smirnoff, the company is no longer seeking the Bond audience, \"We are really looking to attract customers that are more in the 21 to 29 age group, People in that age group socialize more.\" The Bond audience, said the Smirnoff rep, is men 25 to 45, and not into socializing, just into being cool. Bond's studio, MGM, insists that the Bond target audience is men and women age 13 to 59, which means that those on the low end shouldn't be drinking anything at all.\n\n3. Genre and Methods of Marketing of James Bond Genre of James Bond According to Guinness World Records, the James Bond films are the most profitable film series of all time. It is also the longest continuing series of English language films. The James Bond series is considered the best in genre for Action, these films include many typical action movie stereo types such as a the man A evil Villain is usually the course of the fighting in the movie which courses the Hero to fight back with guns, explosives and frequent car chases resolve the feud between them in the storyline. This is a typical storyline for all the James Bond movies , a this stereotype is very vague it allows the writers too expand into other characters and the motives for the fighting, usually involving a typical ‘Bond Girl’.The action oriented, sophisticated and skilful agent often have a set characteristics such as James Bond. In the many movies which have features the character James Bond has shown him with a man of taste, liking fancy clothes, dry vodka martinis 'shaken, not stirred', hi-tech gadgets, and cars (Aston Martin DB5, Lotus Esprit, and BMWs). He has also battled various types of eccentric, deadly and infamous criminals who planned to assault the world. Methods of Marketing The James Bond movies have developed a key for marketing there films, with more and more of there movies planning to come out there is a bigger hype for the next one, this constantly ads a bigger fan base for the release of the next movie resulting in bigger box office success. The main method of marketing for the James Bond movies is linking the movie with a product, Bond movies are especially popular with advertisers because of their appeal to the young and old. An example of this is during the release of Casino Royal (2006) as the producers linked the movie with the new Aston Martin DBS. This allows the option for extra print and TV advertising for the cinema release of the film, the producers can include in the contract that the film release date and title has to be mentions in any adverting produced for the product. The method worked extremely well for Casino Royal (2006) as people were excited to see the new model of the Aston Martin DBS, the wanted to see the new car in action resulting them turning to the cinema to have a first look. Opening Weekend: Casino Royal (2006) $40,833,156 (USA) (19 November 2006) (3,434 Screens) £13,370,969 (UK) (19 November 2006) (505 Screens) €1,238,414 (Netherlands) (26 November 2006) (132 Screens) PHP 26,214,062 (Philippines) (19 November 2006) (135 Screens)\n\n4. Country of exhibition The new James Bond movie is going to have three different Premieres, one in Lester Square, LA and France, Paris following in the foot steps of the James Bond For Your Eyes Only (1981). I will make sure that all the main cast and crew attend all the premiere to maximise attention and marketing for the film. These film will also be shown in all cinemas due to the popularity of the previous movies, maximising profit. To show the UK heritage of the movie I realise the movie 2 weeks before world wide realise in the UK allowing the UK citizens to feel their importance to the success of all the other Bond Movie. This will also boost hype about the movie before the realise in the US to maximise first weekend taking at the Box Office. In 1964 Goldfinger made a worldwide gross of $124,900,000 which is a increase of the gross from Dr. No (1963) which made $59,567,035. The big increase of the success from Goldfinger was the result of overseas press, Goldfinger was released in 17 different countries in the duration of 6 years, the movie was also premiere in New York, Paris, LA and London. James Bond Premiere for Quantum of Solace Roger Moore promoting the James Bond film For Your (2008) London Odeon Lester Square. Eyes Only in Paris, France (1981).\n\n5. Production Companies EON Productions is the main film production company known for producing the James Bond film series, the company operates from Pinewood Studios UK. This production company has proven that it is a perfect suit to produce the Bond movies due to huge success the that have achieved. For my new Bond movie I would choose this production company to help me create this movie, it understands the marketing techniques which suits these movies as well as the type of strategies which could help create an even bigger buzz for the up coming movie. The company has produced all the Bond movies and has also produced other big success includes Call Me Bwana (1963) . The companies role as a film production company to manage the running of the movie including hiring, financing, marketing , equipment and the organising of the daily filming of the movie.

Genre and Methods of Marketing of 5 Other Films These 5 film are in the same genre as the James Bond movies, this genre include action/ adventure. I will explain their marketing strategies and how it could be helpful in the marketing for the new James Bond Movie. 1. Warrior (2011) This movie share the same action genre as the James Bond movies, even though it is not a spy based movie it still creates the same suspense and thrill which you get when you are watching the James Bond movies. This advertising strategies was aimed at the middle age working man, as the name of the movie is the same as the Mitsubishi Warrior Truck they made a advertising connection with the car manufacture so when you test drive the car you get a chance to enter in a competition to win tickets to the premier of the movie in London . Even if the person does not win it raises awareness of the movie and create a vibe about the feeling of the film due to the connection with the truck. This is a good idea to connect a movie with a make of car which represents the film as with many movie targeted at men they feel that if they can buy the car which is associated with their favourite character they can feel they carry the same characteristics such as James Bond. 2. The Bourne Ultimatum (2007) This movie share many similarities of the James Bond movies at it shares the genres of action/adventure and it is also about a spy. This movie was advertised thought a viral campaign , Google and Universal created a online game “inspired by the ‘Bourne’ films” in which players take on the role of a CIA operative tracking Jason Bourne across the planet. Google also arranged to get a screenshot of a Google results page during a scene in the film. Google helped to promote the film through the game due to a extra product surrounding the story of the film, the game was realised a few month before the movie was released helping in a box office total of £227.2M. This strategy would work for any action movie which was soon to be released, but this would only work if the was a saga to help the buzz of the game release."
