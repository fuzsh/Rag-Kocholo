        "text": "Yesterday, when we left off, the Bond franchise was at a standstill. Having lost their undisputed number one star (Sean Connery), and failing miserably in their attempt to replace him with an unknown (George Lazenby) both “Cubby” Broccoli and Harry Saltzman knew their next casting decision was going to be critical. If they were successful in choosing the right replacement for Bond, the series would continue. If they landed another dud…well, it was hard to envision any future films.\n\nHaving been burned by Lazenby’s inexperience, both men knew they needed a seasoned veteran. But here, for the first time, major disagreements began to surface in their working relationship. Saltzman wanted Roger Moore, who was a major fixture on television in the 60’s after having starred in “The Saint” and “The Persuaders.” But Broccoli felt he just didn’t seem right for the part.\n\nBroccoli wanted Bond to be a tough and ruthless killer who projected an element of danger along lines of how Sean Connery had played the character. But Moore made it clear that wasn’t his thing. He was a pacifist at heart who loathed violence. During preliminary discussions, he articulated his interest in bringing humor and sophistication to the role. While this didn’t sit well with Broccoli, Saltzman argued that Moore’s name recognition and seasoned professionalism was what they needed. Eventually, these were the arguments which carried the day.\n\nSaltzman’s judgment was vindicated when the actor’s first stint as Bond, Live and Let Die, did banner business at the box office. Helped by an entertaining script and good reviews for Moore’s performance, most people quickly accepted him as the character. In addition, the success of the picture proved there were plenty of legs left in the series.\n\nUnfortunately, it was around this time that the disagreement between Broccoli and Saltzman over the casting of Moore started to lead to even bigger problems. Having previously enjoyed a stellar working relationship, the two began to butt heads over the direction they wanted to take the franchise. At the heart of the conflict was a huge difference in working styles. Broccoli realized were tending a cash cow that was making them rich beyond their wildest dreams. As such, he felt both he and Saltzman needed to give it their full and undivided attention.\n\nSaltzman, on the other hand, viewed himself as a “producer extraordinaire.” For his part, he was never happy sharing the spotlight with his partner. Having made a name for himself with the Bond franchise, he wanted to leverage it in order to expand the rest of his business empire. He started making investments in real state and various other start-up companies. And unbeknownst to Broccoli, had offered up his stake in the Bond brand as collateral for the loans he needed to secure in order to pursue these other ventures.\n\nWhile jet-setting around the globe indulging these various “whims” and feeling infallible, Saltzman literally began “phoning in” his contributions to the Bond series. Often with bizarre results. As one example, for “Live and Let Die,” he contacted the scriptwriter and told him to add a scene where Bond wakes up in bed next to what he thinks is a beautiful girl. Only to turn over and discover it’s an alligator. The writer complained this made zero sense. For starters, he argued, an alligator’s legs are too short to allow it to climb up into a bed…not to mention the problem it would have a pulling the covers up over itself. But Saltzman was adamant about the “genius” behind the concept and ordered the scene be put in the script. The writer took his case to Broccoli, who promptly told him to ignore Saltzman’s stupid idea.\n\nThe strain in the two men’s relationship continued during the next Bond film The Man With the Golden Gun. Set in Thailand, Saltzman decided he wanted to stage an elephant chase in the jungle. Again, Broccoli and the writer tried to talk him out of it, arguing that even at top speed, elephants didn’t run fast enough to make the sequence exciting enough for an audience. Undeterred, Saltzman went to talk to the local elephant handlers, who told him their trained pachyderms could motor pretty well if they were outfitted with special shoes.\n\nThe next thing Broccoli knew, a huge line item showed up on the film’s budget: several thousand of dollars’ worth of custom-made “elephant shoes.” Irate, he refused to pay and told the hapless locals who had been promised the windfall to go see Saltzman for their money. The producer paid up but continued to become more disillusioned about his participation in the Bond franchise.\n\nThis lack of focus showed in the final product, as Moore hit a sophomore slump in his second outing as James Bond. While still extremely profitable, “The Man with the Golden Gun” failed to make as much money as its predecessor and got mixed reviews from critics. Once again, the franchise seemed in need of a reboot.\n\nBut the perceived failure of this latest film was the least of Saltzman’s problems. While investing heavily in all his other projects, the producer quickly got in over his head. And when several of his enterprises failed, the Swiss banks who had been loaning him money all along came calling. They had been led to believe that the funds they had given to Saltzman were secured by the Bond partnership. After all, it was based on the valued of this brand name they had willing to hand over all those millions of dollars in the first place.\n\nWhen the banks came calling at Broccoli’s doorstep and demanded he fork over all assets associated with the Bond franchise, he pulled out his original agreement with Saltzman. It specifically prohibited these type of shenanigans. It stated that neither partner was allowed to leverage company assets without the knowledge and consent of the other. And when the Swiss banks saw this, they were more than a little peeved (to put it mildly). So, they did what any large organization does when faced with the loss of millions of dollars. They hired an army of lawyers and sued.\n\nThe proceedings were held at a beautiful chateau near Geneva, Switzerland. Years later, Broccoli remembered sitting in a conference room with a huge picture window overlooking the Swiss Alps for weeks on end. On his side, he had three or four close associates sitting with him, while the banks lined up several dozen high-priced lawyers on the other side of the room. At stake wasn’t just the Bond franchise. If Broccoli lost, he knew he and his family would be left penniless.\n\nWith this much at stake, the pressure to settle was enormous. But despite all the threats and legal maneuvering, it all came back to a single clause in the original agreement. Which in turn invalidated Saltzman’s agreement with the banks. In the end, they never got their money, while Saltzman was forced to sell his shares in the Bond production company to United Artists. He was left ruined.\n\nLater, Broccoli’s wife found it remarkable how he seemed to bear no ill will toward his former partner:\n\n“Cubby was a good man who cared for people, understood people. Which means he forgave them. I don’t have that gift, unfortunately.”\n\nBe that as it may, Broccoli was now all alone. If the Bond franchise was going to continue, it was going to rest solely on his shoulders.\n\nDetermined to bounce back in a big way, Broccoli decided to double the budget for the next film, The Spy Who Loved Me. In addition to featuring the largest indoor set ever built up until that time (an interior docking area featuring full-scale replicas of two nuclear submarines), he decided to kick off the film with one of the most celebrated stunts in all of film history.\n\nThe plan was for James Bond to literally ski off the top of the remote mountain. Then, after a free-fall of several thousand feet – as, the audience held its collective breath – the plummeting spy would open up a hidden parachute to display the Union Jack flag. In many ways, the stunt was a metaphor for Broccoli’s career at that point…not to mention the entire Bond franchise.\n\nThe location chosen was Mount Asgard in Auyuittuq National Park on Baffin Island in extreme northeastern Canada. At over 6,000 feet, and with a sheer cliff face of 3,000 feet, it had all the requirements needed for the stunt.\n\nBut the location was so remote, it was going to cost a quarter of a million dollars just to stage it. The site was only reachable by helicopter and there weren’t any landing sites within range. Which meant the helicopters were going to have to be dismantled, flown to a makeshift runaway, and reassembled on site. In addition, they were going to need the services of two pilots, several mechanics, a doctor, and probably most importantly of all, someone who was an unqualified expert at packing parachutes.\n\nOf course, this didn’t even factor in the challenge of finding a stuntman crazy enough to risk their life for this chance at film immortality. When Broccoli finally found his man, it wasn’t some ultra-famous European Olympic skiing hopeful who had cut his teeth in the French Alps. No, instead, it turned out to be a young, unassuming man named Rick Sylvester who lived in Beverly Hills.\n\nWhen Broccoli went to meet Sylvester at his home, he greeted at the door by the young man’s ultra-friendly mother. Upon listening to Broccoli describe the dangers inherent in the stunt, she exclaimed: “My boy’s crazy! A lawyer he couldn’t be. An accountant isn’t dangerous enough. A doctor’s too safe. Find him a mountain to fall off and he’s happy!”\n\nAfter weeks of preparation, all was in place for the stunt. The team then had to wait on the weather. A bright, sunny day wasn’t going to be good enough. Perhaps even more critically, they also needed the right wind conditions. If they misjudged, Sylvester ran the risk of being blown back and slammed into the cliff face during his 3,000-foot fall.\n\nFinally, after 10 days the conditions were right. But Sylvester’s concerned mother began to weigh on Broccoli’s mind. And he immediately started having second thoughts. A few hours before the cameras rolled, he called Sylvester up and told him he was free to cancel the stunt with no questions asked. Broccoli told him that even after spending all that money, he wouldn’t be able to live with himself if something went wrong. Sylvester thanked him and told him that he’d definitely keep the producer’s offer in mind until the last possible minute.\n\nWith the cameras rolling, Sylvester skied down the side of the summit and plunged into the abyss. For what seemed like an eternity, he fell through the air. As a safety measure, he had his skis attached by special release hooks. His biggest fear was that after jettisoning them, they might hit him or his parachute on the way down. And that’s exactly what happened. If you watch the film, you can see one of the skis graze the chute as it deploys. Al it would have taken is for the ski to have hit the canvas at the wrong angle and the resulting tear could have been disastrous.\n\nLuckily, the ski slid off, and Sylvester landed safely. And in the process, earned $24,000 for this one unprecedented stunt. The film premiered in London in the summer of 1977, with Prince Charles in attendance. And when that Union Jack opened up during the opening sequence, the entire audience stood up and cheered. By the time “Jaws” made his appearance as one of the all-time great Bond villains, everyone in attendance was eating it up. “The Spy Who Loved Me” went on to become a gigantic hit, grossing more money than any previous Bond film since “Thunderball.”\n\nThe franchise’s reputation as an integral part of the pop culture was secure. As was Broccoli and Roger Moore’s continued association with it. During subsequent films, their working relationship continued to improve, as both felt comfortable enough to bring a sense of humor to the world of James Bond. Originally, the next film was slated to be For Your Eyes Only. But after the mammoth success of Star Wars in 1977, Moonraker was moved up in the queue. For the latest venture, not only was James Bond going to take a trip to outer space, but he was also going to indulge in quite a bit of parody. If purists complained, audiences didn’t. The latest film made even more money than “The Spy Who Loved Me.” The next Bond film, 1981’s For Your Eyes Only also cleaned up on United Artist’s balance sheets.\n\nWhile Cubby Broccoli never won an Oscar outright, he never seemed overly concerned by this fact. At one point, he candidly told an interviewer “the only award I need is green with Washington’s head on it.” Still, the James Bond films had been so popular, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences felt obligated to honor him in some way. So, in 1982, they presented Broccoli with the prestigious Irving Thalberg Award with Roger Moore handling the honors at that year’s Oscars. He was also given a spot-on Hollywood’s Walk of Fame. Fame, fortune, and the respect of his peers – everything seemed to be smooth sailing for Broccoli and the future of James Bond.\n\nYet, a dark cloud was gathering on the horizon. In the original script for “The Spy Who Loved Me” the villain, Stromberg was originally supposed to be a member of SPECTRE – that evil organization which played such a key role in the earlier Bond films. But Broccoli and his scriptwriter had to jettison any mention of the name. Why? It’s time to bring Kevin McClory back into our story.\n\nSince his successful participation in “Thunderball,” McClory hadn’t quietly gone away. In fact, he had remained obsessed with James Bond and for years afterward had continued filing lawsuits to try and gain ownership of the various elements associated with the series. This included not only the use of the term SPECTRE but the character of Blofeld as well. When asked why McClory just didn’t give it a rest after all those years, a friend simply explained: “because that’s what he does.”\n\nRather than expend resources continually fighting McClory in court, Broccoli and United Artists found it easier just to avoid mentioning possible areas of friction in the films. (Which is one reason why you don’t see Blofeld mentioned by name after “Diamonds Are Forever” – although he gets a memorable send-off at the beginning of “For Your Eyes Only.”)\n\nBut McCrory still had an ace up his sleeve…namely the agreement he had made after the completion of “Thunderball.” The one which gave him the right to make his own version after ten years had passed. And as the 80s dawned, that time was up. When McClory announced his plans to remake the film independently, few people – including Broccoli – took him seriously. The Bond “brand” was firmly established at this point, and it seemed unlikely McClory would be able to raise the needed capital to pull off his own competing version.\n\nThen McClory dropped his second bombshell. Not only was he going to make his own Bond film, but it was going to star none other Sean Connery. Still nursing a grudge toward Broccoli and Saltzman, the actor signed on for his chance to even the score a bit. A multimillion-dollar payday probably didn’t hurt either when weighing his decision.\n\nAfter all those years, there was still a palpable level of animosity between Connery and Broccoli. While appearing on “The Tonight Show” with Johnny Carson, Connery was asked to take part in a “Bond” trivia quiz. One of the questions which came up was to “name the first James Bond villain.” Without skipping a beat on national television, Connery answered “Cubby Broccoli.”\n\nBroccoli saw the broadcast and confided to friends and family just how much this had hurt. But didn’t stop him from suing McClory in an attempt to stop the production. Eventually, they settled out of court. The new James Bond film was going to be allowed to proceed without any legal roadblocks. In return, Broccoli was going to get a percentage of the profits. Ironically, the deal was similar to the one that Eon had made with McClory back in the mid-1960s prior to the production of “Thunderball.”\n\nIn many ways, it’s hard to believe all the ugly-in-fighting which took place behind the scenes of this latest Bond film. Simply because it displays such a great sense of humor about itself. Starting with the title: Never Say Never Again. It was suggested by Sean Connery’s wife, who thought it would be a great in-joke referencing the famous statement the actor had made after “Diamonds Are Forever.” The one where he claimed he’d “never play James Bond again.”\n\nBut the jokes didn’t stop here. At one point, one of Bond’s co-workers offers him the following greeting: “Good to see you, Mr. Bond. Things have been awful dull around here without you. I hope we’re going to see some gratuitous sex and violence.” Or when the villainess threatens to kill Bond unless he signs a document stipulating she’s the greatest woman he’s ever had sex with. To which Bond replies: “Well, there was this one girl in Philadelphia…”\n\nOf course, Broccoli wasn’t going to take McClory’s bid to usurp the Bond franchise lying down. And it wasn’t long before he announced his own plans to release another Bond film that same year. The title was certainly designed to grab people’s attention. Taken from an Ian Fleming short story, it was called Octopussy. (Burt Reynolds also had a film in theaters at the same time that year called Stroker Ace. Imagine the double takes some people must have done during the summer of 1983 driving by the local cineplex and seeing both titles prominently displayed on the marquee…)\n\nThe trade papers were quick to play up “The Battle of the Bonds.” But, confident of his track record and realizing that going head to head with McCory’s film was merely going to dilute his profits, Broccoli decided to release his film a few months ahead of the other. Both films earned mostly positive, but hardly overwhelming reviews. And when all was said and done, “Octopussy” earned $187.5 million compared to “Never Say Never Again” take of $160 million.\n\nNot exactly a clear-cut victory. And while he had come out on top, Broccoli couldn’t have failed to realize that “Octopussy” had brought in less money than the previous two Bond pictures. The Roger Moore formula was also beginning to show its age, and the actor complained to Broccoli he was too old to play the part. Moore succinctly explained it this way: “there are only so many stunts an aging actor can tackle and only so many young girls he can kiss without looking like a perverted grandfather.”\n\nDespite Moore’s misgivings, Broccoli convinced him to take one more shot at the role in 1985’s View to a Kill. At age 56, he was older than co-star Tanya Robert’s mother. Moore also resented working actress Grace Jones, whose behavior he felt was unprofessional. At one point, his dissatisfaction reached the point where he told Broccoli he would refuse to do any press junkets with her to promote the film. And while the tallies for this latest Bond picture weren’t bad, they still reflected an on-going decline in the series’ fortune. With that in mind both Broccoli and Moore mutually agreed to part ways. Both men instinctively knew another direction was needed and the search was on for a new James Bond.\n\nOne name which kept surfacing over and over was Pierce Brosnan. He looked like a dead ringer for the part after his success on the TV show “Remington Steele.” The timing also looked to be perfect, since NBC had just canceled the series. Brosnan agreed to terms, publicity stills were shot, and the press releases were issued.\n\nBut after the lawyers read over the fine print, they warned Broccoli there might be a problem. One of the clauses in Brosnan’’s contract gave NBC gave the right to pick up his contract if they managed to sell “Remington Steele” within 60 days of cancellation. No problem, Broccoli thought. To hedge his bets, he scheduled a press conference to promote the new James Bond on day 60, reasoning there was no way the network could finalize a sale at the last minute.\n\nSure enough, on the way out the door to the conference that day, Brosnan got a phone call. His first impulse was to keep walking. But thinking it might be a close friend or relative, he decided to pick it up. When the voice on the other end told him NBC had sold the series at the last minute and wasn’t going to let him out of his contract, Brosnan was shattered. Not only were he and Broccoli left with egg on their face, he was also being forced to forfeit a deal worth millions of dollars. He told friends he thought his movie career was over before it ever even started.\n\nBroccoli began his research again, eventually settling on classically trained actor Timothy Dalton. Not only did Broccoli feel Dalton projected the right combination of sophistication and danger for the part but was also pleased to find they were both in total agreement about the direction the character should take. The time had come to jettison the jokey self-referential humor and get back to basics. As Dalton put it:\n\n“Roger was great at what he did. But I couldn’t simply copy what he had done – the movies had become somewhat pastiche. Before you go too long, you become a parody of yourself. You’ve lost depth, you’ve lost texture…you start to get shallow. What makes these movies work? What is it that got them going? You’ve got to back to the beginning. Here you have a hero who MURDERED in cold blood… the dirtiest, toughest, meanest, brutalist hero we had ever seen. THIS is what started these movies…”\n\nDalton’s first outing, The Living Daylights, tried to adopt this formula while still retaining a sense of fun and adventure,. And audiences seemed to respond. The film out-grossed the previous Roger Moore films and most critics gave Dalton’s performance a great big thumbs up.\n\nThinking they were on to something, Broccoli and Dalton pushed the envelope even further with their next offering, 1989’s License to Kill. Calling the film, a “tale of the nasty times we live in” Broccoli had Bond tangling with a Central American drug lord modeled after Manuel Noriega. Featuring bad guys eaten by sharks, burned alive, exploding in pressure chambers, and chopped into little itty pieces by industrial machines, it wasn’t exactly tailor-made for kids. The most violent Bond film to date, it was the first to be slapped with a “15” rating in the United Kingdom, which angered a lot of parents who felt betrayed by the James Bond brand.\n\nDalton and Broccoli took a lot of the criticism for this, and while still immensely profitable, “License to Kill” was labeled a flop. It earned 20% less than the previous film and adjusted for inflation, was the least profitable film in the history of the entire series. United Artists weighed in, saying this was sure sign that Dalton needed to go. Broccoli fought this mandate, reminding them that both Sean Connery and Roger Moore hadn’t hit their stride until their third films.\n\nWhile this argument raged, it was obvious to Broccoli there were even bigger problems with his relationship with the studio. For many years, management had seen a high degree of turnover, and Broccoli found that with each new boss, he had to deal with someone who brought their own ideas and inflated ego. He later remembered one individual in particular who showed up to a screening of one of the Dalton films half way through. Instead of quietly taking a seat, he started yelling so everyone could hear: “Hey! I’m thinking of getting a Rolls Royce. Can anyone in here recommend a place in town to buy one?”\n\nAnother time while dealing with a revolving door of managers, Broccoli got one which told him: “I know you’ve a rough time, but everything’s going to be all right now.” He promised Broccoli a free hand in producing the next James Bond film and told him to get started. Six weeks later, the same executive called Broccoli into his office and simply stated: “I’m resigning.”\n\nOne of the side effects of all this turmoil was an effort on the part of the suits to generate a cash flow and thus justify their jobs. Among their schemes in 1992 was a plan to sell the rights to all the 16 James Bond films they owned at rock bottom prices. But Broccoli, as well as other members of his production company, were guaranteed a percentage of the sale price. However, they cried foul when they realized the whole endeavor was a fire sale designed to line the pockets of the various executives who were on their way out the door.\n\nBroccoli sued, and after another bitter court battle, won an injunction to stop the sale of the films. But his relationship with United Artists was ruined. After 30 years and 16 films, the era of James Bond appeared to be over. Not because of production problems, losses at the box office, or waning public interest. But because a bunch of short-sighted lawyers and executives at the movie studio were more interested in making money for themselves rather than actually producing movies. By 1995, there hadn’t been a new James Bond in the theaters for six years…the longest drought in the history of the franchise.\n\nFor his part, Broccoli told confidants the whole thing was over. By now, he was in his 80’s and didn’t have the strength to keep fighting these types of battles anymore. Thinking of his family’s financial future, he decided to hang it all up and sell his share in the production company which produced the Bond films.\n\nJust as he made this announcement though, there was once again a major turnover of management at United Artists. As part of their strategic vision and realizing that the name “James Bond” was one of their most valued assets, the new team of executives told Broccoli they wanted to revive the franchise…one…more…time.\n\nTimothy Dalton by this point had gone on to other things. But lo and behold, who do you suppose was at loose ends and available to sign on the dotted line? None other than Pierce Brosnan. A new director named Martin Campbell was hired who jokingly told Brosnan on the first day “you better be effing good…” For those naysayers in Hollywood who claimed the character of James Bond was irrelevant now that the Cold War was over, they intentionally wrote a script which played up that fact. Finally, as a nod to Ian Fleming, they named the film Goldeneye, after his retreat in Jamaica.\n\nAfter these initial decisions were made and in failing health, Broccoli turned over the reins for the film to his daughter Barbara and stepson Michael Wilson. Both had been intricately involved in the franchise for many years and were well aware of the difficulties inherent in seeing a James Bond film to completion. Not to mention all the legal pitfalls which went with the job.\n\nCubby Broccoli died in 1996 at the age of 87. He lived long enough to see “Goldeneye” become a huge success, and no doubt was comforted by the fact he had left the franchise in extremely capable hands. At his funeral, one of the speakers pointed at his coffin and told the mourners: “In that body lived a giant.”\n\nRoger Moore later wrote his own tribute:\n\n“I could write a whole book on Cubby alone. He was a big man both in life and charm. A kind, caring, and fun person, Cubby would always listen to ideas and suggestions from any members of the crew. He might not necessarily agree, but he listened, and that endeared him to everyone. He was known universally as Cubby, from studio heads to the tea lady. There were no pretensions or nasty sides to Cubby. Sure, he could be tough in business. But his heart was a big one, and his loyalty unswerving.”\n\nSounds like a concise description of what makes a good leader or manager…as opposed to reading a 500-page book on the subject.\n\nOver the next seven years, there were three more Bond films starring Pierce Brosnan: Tomorrow Never Dies, The World is Not Enough, and Die Another Day. Because of expanding distribution markets across the world – not to mention supplemental sources of revenue from things like cable TV and pay per view – their financial take eclipsed anything which had come before. These latest successes helped cement the Bond franchise as the most financially successful in film history.\n\nYet by the time things got to the final Brosnan film in 2002, once again something seemed amiss. Invisible cars, demolition derby’s in ice palaces, improbable chase scenes with hang gliders which had nothing to do with the plot, our hero kite surfing out of danger while riding a giant tsunami…James Bond seemed to have forsaken story for sheer spectacle-without any regard for the audience’s intelligence. Looking back, even Pierce Brosnan admitted as much, claiming that after “Goldeneye” the other films were a bit of a blur to him. Seems he, like many of of us, could hardly tell them apart.\n\nBut as we have seen, one of the strongest attributes Broccoli had brought to the franchise was his uncanny ability to identify problems, and then seek a change in direction before the series wore out its welcome. All while remaining true to the basic formula. It was a lesson that Barbara Broccoli and Michael Wilson no doubt had learned well while watching their father in action over the years.\n\nAnd so, after “Die Another Day,” which had made more money than any previous Bond film, they reluctantly called up Pierce Brosnan and told him they needed to change horses. Not because of anything he had done wrong…but simply because another reboot was called for.\n\nThe only Ian Fleming book remaining which hadn’t been turned into a film by Broccoli’s family was “Casino Royale.” So, they set about purchasing the rights and then used it as a basis to launch a more serious, adult version of Bond.\n\nIt was then that a visage from the past once again made its presence known. Kevin McClory, upon hearing of Broccoli’s and Wilson’s latest plan, once again filed a lawsuit claiming the rights to “Casino Royale.” But then, fate intervened. The motion had been filed in a U.S. court, but on the date the case was due to be heard, McClory was prevented from entering the country due to issues with his visa. So, when he didn’t show, the judge threw the case out. The endless lawsuits finally stopped two years later when McClory passed away in 2006.\n\nThe way was finally clear for Casino Royale. And the first order of business was finding a lead actor. But when Daniel Craig was announced as the new Bond, the press vilified him. He was called too short, too blond, not handsome enough, not a serious actor, and even given the moniker “James Bland.” Massive hate campaigns were mounted on social media, and a petition was circulated asking the producers to reinstate Pierce Brosnan.\n\nPublicly, Craig ignored the backlash. Although he didn’t do himself any favors when he rode a boat up the Thames to his initial press conference wearing a life jacket. The British tabloids had a field day publishing the images and mocking him for being a wimp. Watching from the sidelines, Roger Moore was aghast and reflected upon how much the world had changed since he had first taken up the role over 30 years before. He was amazed at how people in the modern era seemed to take it personally when the studio’s choices didn’t match their own inner visions for a film.\n\nYet, once “Casino Royale” was released, all the naysayers were proven dead wrong. The film was met with unprecedented praise, with many critics hailing it as the best Bond movie ever made. Rotten Tomatoes gave it the highest rating (95%) for any film released that year, and it earned a place on dozens of Top Ten lists. Some, like Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly, put it in the number one slot. Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars…something he had never done for any previous Bond film. It should also be noted that “Casino Royale” made more money than any other film in the history of the franchise.\n\nJames Bond didn’t just get a reboot…he was now skyrocketing through the stratosphere…where anything seemed possible. The next film, Quantum of Solace, didn’t come close to earning the critical acclaim its predecessor did, but it still made almost as much money. If there was any concern about another extended slump, it was answered when the third Daniel Craig film, Skyfall, became the first James Bond film in 2012 to bring in over a billion dollars (gulp!).\n\nThe reviews for “Skyfall” were also nearly as positives the ones for “Casino Royale” with many critics singling out Daniel Craig’s nuanced performance as the iconic Mr. Bond. The winning ways continued in 2015 with the release of Spectre. Among those making his approval known was none other than Roger Moore, who said:\n\n“Craig was, and is, very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine. It was a Bond that the public wanted.”\n\nWhich sort of brings us back full circle, doesn’t it…back to where it all began…\n\nIf you remember, Ian Fleming died while the movie “Goldfinger” was still in production. While he was able to witness the initial success his creation enjoyed on the silver screen, Fleming probably never dreamed it would still be going strong over 50 years later…and become the most enduring series in the history of film. As one of Fleming’s friends noted: “Bond did him all right…he did reward Ian with everlasting life…”\n\nTo be sure, people like Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman also had a major hand in this. When Fleming died, Broccoli dictated that from then on, the author’s name would always appear on the front of every Bond film. Even today, as a tribute to both men, you can still see “Albert R. Broccoli’s Eon Productions presents Daniel Craig as Ian Fleming’s James Bond 007 in…” at the start of the movie’s opening titles.\n\nThrough the years, many people had unsuccessfully lobbied Broccoli for a change to this policy. To which he always refused by saying: “Nobody is bigger than James Bond!!”\n\nWhich is where we currently stand.\n\nDuring this overview of the history of the series, we’ve unfortunately had to “skip over” a lot of the discussion about the films themselves. Which isn’t really fair, since most of them are so spectacularly entertaining.\n\nTo remedy this situation, please join us tomorrow for Shaken…Not Stirred Part Three. We’ll talk a little bit about each film specifically, highlight our favorite Bond moments, share some trivia, and believe it or not, rank each film using our own subjective opinion.\n\nOh boy….That’s sure to provide some fodder for all the other James Bond fans out there."
