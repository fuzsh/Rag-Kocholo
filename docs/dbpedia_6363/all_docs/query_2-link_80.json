        "text": "It's 1989. You're Eon. Bond's becoming passé. The Living Daylights, while establishing a return to the Fleming roots, suffered from a complicated (and, to be honest, dated) plot.\n\nAudiences just don't connect with traditional spy thrillers anymore. So, what do you do? You go dark. And then immediately regret that decision when all the fans hate it. Except me, of course.\n\nLicence to Kill, the film that bombed the box office, the film that killed the franchise for six years, is my absolute favourite in the series. I'd even go as far as to say it's one of my favourite films ever made. Licence is quite a controversial one among the fandom; people either love it or hate it. So, before I get into my absolute love for this film, let me first address the issues people have with it.\n\nI think the only reason people object to the revenge and drug baron plot is because of the direction and cinematography being somewhat bland and TV-film-like. Live and Let Die and Quantum of Solace explore similar scenarios but don't get flack for it.\n\nThe simplicity of the plot signifies that this entry will rely mostly on character drama, which, to me, is much more engaging than a complicated megalomaniac scheme.\n\nPeople complain that it doesn't feel like a Bond film. Bond loses his 00 status in this one — he's not with MI6 anymore — that's the point. It's not going to be as stylised and sophisticated as the previous entries. If you find the film too dark or too gritty, that's entirely fair. It can be brutal at points.\n\nI love the brutality of Licence — although I'm aware that it's not for everyone. My only issue with the film is Talisa Soto's acting, but her character isn't integral to the plot so it can be overlooked.\n\nNow I'm done defending this film, let's explain why it's fantastic. Firstly, it's got the best performance from a Bond actor. Timothy Dalton as James Bond, who's lost almost everything, who's been pushed over the edge, and is driven by revenge, is just phenomenal here. He's just as incredible as he was in Daylights, but I think the script works better for his take on Bond in Licence.\n\nGone are the Moore-ish comedy elements, instead replaced with a more manipulative side to 007's personality. The scenes where Bond plays Sanchez by pretending to be loyal to him are reminiscent of Akira Kurosawa's 1961 samurai classic Yojimbo (more famously remembered as the 1964 western remake, A Fistful of Dollars), and are incredibly well-written and acted by both parties.\n\nRobert Davi deserves a lot of credit. His portrayal of Franz Sanchez is both slimy and likeable. You really dislike him, yet he's a joy to watch. His henchmen are also really enjoyable. Dario is deranged, and it works so well. Professor Joe is hilarious in every scene, and even the minor characters like Truman-Lodge and Ed Hurley... sorry, Killifer, have left a lasting impression."
