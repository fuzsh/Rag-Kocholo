        "text": "Background\n\nEon Productions (also known as Eon Productions Ltd. and Albert R. Broccoli's Eon Productions Ltd.) was founded in 1961 by film producers Albert R. \"Cubby\" Broccoli and Harry Saltzman. The studio would have their films released by United Artists. The studio's first film was Dr. No, the first film in the James Bond series, and was released the following year. Saltzman would sell his share in Eon to United Artists in 1975, and they would remain as a partner with Broccoli until 1986. Broccoli's children, Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli currently operate the company. Danjaq LLC is the copyright holder for the studio's films and is their parent company. The studio did not use a logo until 2020.\n\nThe studio's name is an acronym standing for \"Everything or Nothing.\" In the documentary Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007, Barbara Broccoli explained the reasoning behind the name: \"There was never any middle ground. It was always, 'Give it everything you've got.'\"\n\nLogo (31 January 2020-)\n\nVisuals: Essentially just the name \"EON PRODUCTIONS\" in white, stacked up on a black background.\n\nTechnique: A still, digital graphic.\n\nAudio: The opening/closing theme of the movie/show."
