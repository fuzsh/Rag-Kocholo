        "text": "Since I have been publishing the Original Prop Blog for about six and a half years as a free resource to the public, I thought I would add one article (about of about 1,645 to date) to make note of and promote a few of my own auction consignments in the upcoming Julien’s Auctions “Icons and Idols” sale taking place in Beverly Hills on November 8th, 9th, and 10th. Items from my personal collection included in this sale include six movie prop pistols: a Walther PPK used by Timothy Dalton as James Bond in Licence To Kill, a Colt pistol used by Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s Heat, the .38 Detective Special pistol used by both Pam Grier and Robert Forester in Quentin Tarantino’s Jackie Brown, a customized pistol used by Bridget Fonda in Point Of No Return, a Winchester shotgun used by Juliette Lewis In Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers, and a Glock 17 pistol used by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Ultimatum.Below are links to each lot listed in the Julien’s Auctions online catalog:\n\nLot 829 Hero Colt Pistol used by Al Pacino in Michael Mann’s Heat\n\nLot 830 Hero .38 Detective Special Pistol used by Pam Grier and Robert Forester in Quentin Tarantino’s Jackie Brown\n\nLot 831 Hero Custom Chromed Pistol used by Bridget Fonda in Point Of No Return\n\nLot 832 Hero Winchester Shotgun used by Juliette Lewis in Oliver Stone’s Natural Born Killers\n\nLot 833 Hero Glock 17 Pistol used by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in The Bourne Ultimatum and Mobile Phone with Gadget from The Bourne Identity\n\nLot 834 Hero Walther PPK used by Timothy Dalton as James Bond in Licence To Kill\n\nI researched the history and provenance of all six pieces over the years, and the results of this research is included in the auction descriptions. In efforts of transparency, each description in the online and print catalogs characterizes the pieces as from my collection, so I welcome direct inquiries for those who wish to contact me via phone or e-mail for additional information.\n\nBelow is information about each piece that has been previously published on the Original Prop Blog under “Movie Prop Guns”:\n\nJames Bond Hero Walther PPK\n\nNote: Most images throughout the article can be clicked on for higher resolution versions\n\nBackground: Walther PPK – The Signature James Bond Sidearm\n\nThe famous, iconic, and signature weapon for 007 in the James Bond movies has been the Walther PPK. Given limitations in supplying such weapons to production, in some cases the Walther PP and Walther P5 have served as “look alike” stand ins. Also, following Pierce Brosnan’s “Goldeneye“, the PPK was replaced with the more modern Walther P99. However, with the most recent film staring Daniel Craig, “Quantum of Solace“, the Walther PPK has returned as the sidearm weapon of choice for James Bond.\n\nAs most Bond films were produced in the UK, armourer Bapty’s supplied most of the hero weapons for the films. In December 2006, Christie’s, in conjunction with The Prop Store of London and Bapty’s, offered the last of what firearms they could attribute to use in the films through to the last Pierce Brosnan film. Given UK law, those pieces sold were deactivated to UK standards, regardless of the country of the buyer and the applicable firearms laws and regulations.\n\nA prior OPB article includes a compilation of the weapons that I have found in my research of what Bond guns have been identified and offered for sale to the public and/or cataloged:\n\nSee: The Side Arms of James Bond, 007: From The Walther PPK to the P99\n\nAs I understand it, with the Christie’s sale event, two of the three PPKs were pulled from the auction and returned to EON (the PPK used by Sean Connery in “From Russia with Love” and the PPK used by Roger Moore in “For Your Eyes Only”) with the PPK used by Pierce Brosnan in “Goldeneye” being the only one made available for sale to the public.\n\nBackground: “Licence to Kill” (AKA “Licence Revoked”)\n\n“Licence to Kill” was the second of two films starring Timothy Dalton in the role of James Bond. The 16th film in the series, it was released in 1989 and, due to legal disputes over the ownership of the franchise, the break between it and the first Pierce Brosnan film, “Goldeneye” (in 1995), was the longest between releases. Licence to Kill was also the last film produced by Albert R. Broccoli and the first original (non-Fleming) title. It was also the first Bond movie that featuring no filming at UK soundstages during production and was the first to feature a PG-13 rating.\n\nThe basis of the story revolves around Bond’s resigning from the M16 to seek revenge against a Latin American drug kingpin who was responsible for the maiming of Felix Leiter and murder of his new bride.\n\nJames Bond: Licence To Kill & Stembridge Gun Rentals\n\nThe Walther PPK pictured below was used by Timothy Dalton as James Bond in the John Glen film, “Licence to Kill” (AKA “Licence Revoked”).\n\nThis PPK is from the U.S. armourer, Stembridge Gun Rentals. “Licence to Kill” is one of the only Bond films with photography within the United States (as well as Mexico), so it is one of the only non-Baptys PPKs.\n\nUnlike the pieces auctioned by Christie’s, this PPK has had no post production work done to alter the weapon – it has not be deactivated to UK specs as the others were as it was never imported into the UK.\n\nThis piece is actually “live fire” capable – fully functional with both the blank fire barrel and standard barrel:\n\nProvenance includes the original Stembridge rental agreements (not copies) to the “License Revoked” production (the original name for the film, before being changed to “Licence to Kill”) and a letter from the film’s Production Supervisor, Anthony Waye, to (then) Vice President of Stembridge Gun Rentals, Syd Stembridge, outlining the business deal for 1st and 2nd Unit Armorers and rented firearms along with original postmarked envelope from the Mexico-based production.\n\nInformation from the paperwork is consistent with details outlined in the book, “The Making of Licence To Kill” (long out of print and never published in the U.S.):\n\nInformation about Stembridge Gun Rentals and the armorers employed by the production (discussed in the Anthony Waye letter to Syd Stembridge above):\n\nInformation about Production Supervisor Anthony Waye who drafted the letter to Stembridge (and photo):\n\nBelow are a series of stills and screencaptures from the film:\n\nAl Pacino’s Hero M1991A1 Series 80 Colt Officer’s APC Model\n\nNote: Most images throughout the article can be clicked on for higher resolution versions\n\nBackground: “Heat”\n\n“Heat” written and directed by Michael Mann, is his 1995 theatrical remake of his own 1989 made-for-television “L.A. Takedown”. The crime drama stared Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, along with an outstanding supporting cast. Pacino’s Lt. Vincent Hanna is an LAPD homicide detective tracks down De Niro’s Neil McCauley in his attempt to take down “scores” involving high value criminal exploits.\n\nAlong with the pairing of the two famous actors, the film is famous for it’s lengthy bank heist shoot-out in the streets of Los Angeles.\n\nAl Pacino, as Vincent Hana, guns down Robert Di Niro’s McCauley in the film’s finale with his sidearm.\n\nLittle John’s Auction Service “The Stembridge Collection”\n\nAn analysis of this prop weapon was originally published following the Little John’s Auction Service sale event in the liquidation of assets from “The Stembridge Collection”. As such, excerpts and some information already published will be referenced in this article. The initial Original Prop Blog article can be found here:\n\nStembridge Auction Report, Part 12: Al Pacino Pistol from Heat\n\nHowever, since that original article was published, the film has been released on Blu-Ray Disc and I have obtained copies of the original Stembridge Gun Rentals rental agreements, which confirm that this prop was rented to the production.\n\nIn addition to the rental agreements, and as noted two years ago, other evidence was present which lead to a favorable authentication of the piece:\n\nThe piece has been customized in ways that were unique to the Heat production.\n\nThe piece is a match to a Heat pistol featured in a Guns Magazine article circa 1998.\n\nThere is a possible screen-match to one of the scenes in the film.\n\nThere is studio blood still on the piece, which may tie it to the climax of the film wherein Pacino’s character guns down De Niro’s character, then holds his bloody hand while the scene fades out.\n\nLittle John’s Auction Service\n\nBelow is how the two pistols attributed to Heat were marketed in the catalog, as Lots 72 & 73.\n\nUnfortunately, as with the other lots at auction, catalog shots were grayscale, low resolution, and limited to one side.\n\nThe one perplexing piece of information gained via the photos is that one slide was marked “COLT M1991A1” (Lot 72) while the other was “COLT MK IV” (Lot 73), yet the serial numbers on both frames (same naming convention and sequence) would indicate the same make and model.\n\nLot 72 is the piece featured in this article – the M1991A1 Series 80 Colt Officer’s APC Model.\n\nHeat Specs\n\nWith some significant assistance, I was able to obtain some interesting information from Stembridge in regards to the Al Pacino Heat sidearm.\n\nOne, they were purchase ordered specifically for use in the Heat production (both for training Pacino in use as a live fire weapon as well for conversion to blank fire).\n\nAs noted, they have custom authentic ivory stocks.\n\nThe barrel restrictor, per instructions from Michael Mann, were placed deep into the barrel so as to not be seen on screen (see static screencap of shot on dresser, later in the article).\n\nAlso, the rear/side of the port ejector was filed down to accommodate the ejection of blank fire shells (note the rough, rounded rear corner; see static screencap of shot in elevator, later in the article).\n\nGuns Magazine\n\nWhile I had scans of this magazine article long before the auction, I honestly forgot about it until afterward, which was a shame, as it ends up that the Pacino Heat pistol featured in a photo in the article is the Lot 72 pistol.\n\nFor readers of the OPB, I uploaded scans of the full article previously:\n\nsee OPB article “Guns Magazine Stembridge Gun Rentals Article Circa 1998“\n\nsee full Guns Magazine article “Shoot for Effect” (Adobe Acrobat required)\n\nOf note, in the article “Shoot for Effect”, Armorer Harry Lu gives the Guns Magazine writer and photographer a tour of Stembridge Gun Rentals, with the first stop in the pistol room. Harry Lu was the credited Weapons Master on Heat, and the photo in the article is of the Heat pistol I acquired.\n\nGiven that the article was written just three years after the release of Heat (in ’98, with release in ’95), that is a better attribution than in 2007 per Little John’s Auction Service – the Weapons Master for Heat, at Stembridge Gun Rentals just a few years later, pulling this piece out for a feature article, noting it as the pistol used by Pacino in Heat. I did recently correspond with the author of the article, and interesting enough, Stembridge closed just before the article saw print.\n\nBelow is a comparison of my pistol (top) and the pistol seen in the Guns Magazine article (bottom), as photographed by Ichiro Nagata. Held at a highly light-reflective angle, I was able to capture many of the hairline scratches in the piece for comparison… (click image for higher resolution)\n\nScreen-Match?\n\nThere are only two clear, well-lit, static shots of the pistol in the film – one on Hana’s dresser at the start of the film, and press-checking it in an elevator toward the end.\n\nLooking at the dresser shot, it is clear that the barrel restrictor is placed deep in the barrel (consistent with the Stembridge specs as outlined), out of sight from the camera lens (Note: image from 2007 article now upgraded with Blu-Ray Disc still at 1920×1080 resolution – click for full image):\n\nNot a match, not a mismatch, but consistent with the prop and the background information on the customization specs.\n\nAs a point of comparison, the barrel restrictor seen with Lot 73 (sold in the same Little John’s auction), this particular piece does not have the restrictor set in deep as seen in the screencapture and the piece that is the subject of this article (Lot 72 Top, Lot 73 Bottom):\n\nThe other clear shot, in the elevator, actually may eventually turn out to be a true “screen-match”. As noted and shown above, the rear of the ejector port has been filed down in a very distinct and custom manner. If you reference the close-up of my piece above, you can see it is very irregular in shape and angles.\n\nLooking at the close-up in the elevator, the cuts, angles, and shadow, it appears it may match up (click photo for higher resolution comparison – this now compares with a still blow-up from the new Blu-Ray Disc, upgraded from the 2007 article utilizing DVD resolution screencaptures):\n\nAs a point of comparison, look at the same point are the rear of the port on Lot 73 sold in the same Little John’s auction, and how it has not been filed down at all, as seen in the scene above:\n\nStill not conclusive that it is a screen-match, but based on the rental agreements (showing that four Colts were rented to the production), the one scene on screen in the elevator is one of the three (I have not seen images of the other two surviving examples that were not sold by Little John’s, so it remains inconclusive).\n\nStudio Blood\n\nAnother interesting finding with examination of the piece was the presence of studio blood on and around the ivory stocks.\n\nI’ve noticed through close study of the film that Pacino has his sidearm in his holster throughout the film. It’s presence is revealed, in part, poking out beneath his jacket/blazer fairly frequently.\n\nThere are two scenes in which studio blood might have gotten on the piece:\n\n1) Assuming he was wearing one of the blank fire pistols, in carrying his step-daughter (played by Natalie Portman) after her attempted suicide attempt, in which she was covered in blood (Note: still from recently released Blu-Ray Disc, upgraded from 2007 article and DVD screencapture – click for 1920×1080 resolution image):\n\n2) At the end of the film, after shooting and killing Neil McCauley, Vincent Hana holds his bloody hand as the final image fades out:\n\nThe presence of studio blood, in the end, could mean nothing, but it is in the plus column on authentication/scene placement none the less.\n\nPhotos\n\nBelow are a photos of the M1991A1 Series 80 Colt Officer’s APC Model pistol (click images for higher resolution):\n\nStembridge Gun Rentals – Rental Agreements\n\nAs noted, since publishing the 2007 article on this piece, I have obtained copies of the original Stembridge Gun Rentals rental agreements which outline every firearms rented to the production, along with rental dates and serial numbers.\n\nBoth pieces attributed to Heat in the “Stembridge Collection” auction were rented to the production.\n\nA total of four (4) such weapons in total were rented to the production.\n\nBlu-Ray Disc\n\nBelow are some high resolution, 1920×1080 screencaptures from the recently released Blu-Ray Disc of Heat which feature the sidearm as worn and used by Al Pacino as Lt. Vincent Hanna.\n\nHero Colt .38 Detective Special Pistol\n\nMax Cherry’s Sidearm Also Used By Jackie Brown\n\nNote: Most images throughout the article can be clicked on for higher resolution versions\n\nBackground: Jackie Brown\n\nJackie Brown (1997) is the third film by Quentin Tarantino, following Reservoir Dogs (1992) and Pulp Fiction (1994). The movie served as a vehicle for leads Pam Grier and Robert Forster, veterans who had not held starring roles in a prominent film for decades. The film also featured Robert De Niro, Samuel L. Jackson, Bridget Fonda, and Michael Keaton. Forster received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor and Greeg and Jackson both received nominations for Golden Globes.\n\nThe movie was Tarantino’s adaptation of Elmore Leonard’s novel, Rum Punch, somewhat remade into an homage of 70’s Blaxploitation films.\n\nHero Colt .38 Pistol Used By Robert Forster as Max Cherry and Pam Grier as Jackie Brown\n\nThis prop .38 Colt Detective Special pistol was seen throughout the film, used by both Robert Forster as Max Cherry and Pam Grier as Jackie Brown.\n\nEarly in the movie, Jackie Brown steals the pistol out of Max Cherry’s glove box. He later discovers this, and allows her to keep the piece. It is featured in several memorable scenes, in confrontation with Ordell and, toward the end of the film, “rehearsing” for a second confrontation.\n\nThe pistol also includes the original prop holster, also seen several times in the movie (though there appears to be two different ones employed).\n\nBelow are a series of photos:\n\nBelow are some still screencaptures from scenes in the film in which the pistol was featured:\n\nProvenance & Authenticity\n\nThis is one of the only firearms in my collection which does not include rental agreements from the armorer. However, it appears that the weapons handler on the film was actually the propmaster, Steve Joyner, and this piece came sourced from him, via StarWares (while under the ownership of Marcia Tyselling).\n\nFollowing the release of the film, StarWares acquired a number of original props from Jackie Brown directly from Steve Joyner, including two firearms – this Colt .38 as well as Ordell’s sawed-off shotgun (illegal to own in California).\n\nThe prop firearm itself also appears to be a “screen-match” with one shot in the film, when Jackie Brown pulls open a drawer, before pulling it out. Comparison and marked comparison seen below:\n\nThe precise matching will be better determined once the film is released in high definition on Blu-Ray Disc.\n\nJason Bourne Hero Glock 17 Pistol\n\nNote: Most images throughout the article can be clicked on for higher resolution versions\n\nBackground: The Bourne Ultimatum\n\nThe Bourne Ultimatum (2007) was the third film starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in his mystery/assassin spy thriller trilogy, loosely based on the Robert Ludlum book. This movie tied up the storylines introduced in The Bourne Identity (2002) and continued in The Bourne Supremacy (2004).\n\nDirected by Paul Greengrass, the franchise is credited with creating its own unique style with substantial (shakey) handheld camera work and creative editing as well as advancements for the genre in story and character, and has had a definite impact on the James Bond franchise, relaunched with Daniel Craig in the starring role and reflecting many of these same characteristics.\n\nAll three films were critical and box office successes, with Ultimatum being voted Film of the Year by Empire Magazine for 2007.\n\nJason Bourne’s Glock 17\n\nThe Glock 17 pictured below was a real firearm converted to blank fire and used by Matt Damon as Jason Bourne in the Paul Greengrass film, The Bourne Ultimatum.\n\nThis Glock 17 is from the U.S. armourer, Weapons Specialist Limited. This is one of four Glock 17s rented for scenes shot in New York City and U.S. soundstages.\n\nProvenance includes the copies of rental agreements from Weapons Specialists to the Bourne Ultimatum production and a letter from the film’s principal armorer explaining that Bourne’s primary weapon was a Glock 17 and he prepared the weapons for Matt Damon for use in the car chase scene through lower Manhattan, the garage, and many days on the soundstage. Also included is a Prop Store of London COA.\n\nBelow are a series of screencaptures from the film:\n\nMaggie Hayward/Claudia Anne Doran/Nina (Portrayed by Bridget Fonda)\n\nHero Hammerli Model 280 Semi-Auto .22 cal Pistol\n\nPoint of No Return (1993)\n\nNote: Most images throughout the article can be clicked on for higher resolution versions\n\nNote: Details about the original acquisition of this piece can be found here: Stembridge Auction Report, Part 7: Hero Pistol – Point of No Return\n\nBackground: Point of No Return\n\nPoint of No Return (1993), also titled “The Assassin” in some territories, was a remake of Luc Besson’s French film Nikita (1990). Point of No Return was directed by John Badham and starred Bridget Fonda. In the film, Fonda’s “Maggie” is a criminal found guilty and sentenced to death, but is given an opportunity to work for the government as an assassin.\n\nWith her first mission at a dinner date, she is presented with a wooden case which contains a Hämmerli 280 pistol with two magazines, which she uses to assassinate her first target and make her escape.\n\nBackground: Stembridge Gun Rentals\n\nStembridge Gun Rentals of Hollywood, California, was founded in 1916 by James Syndey Stembridge in conjunction with Cecil B. DeMille. This business was founded to provide firearms and specialist weapons handlers (or “armorers”) to the motion picture industry for use in film and later, television.\n\nAt its height at the end of World War I, the armory included more than 10,000 firearms.\n\nIn addition to renting firearms (which were eventually converted to fire blanks), Stembridge also produced custom weapons for use in film and television.\n\nCirca 1999, Stembridge closed its operations and a significant portion of the collection was purchased by Robert Petersen of Petersen Publishing. He intended to create a firearms museum in Los Angeles, but the project did not reach fruition. Following his death, the collection was made available for sale at public auction by Little John’s Auction Service in 2007 (see related articles).\n\nStembridge Gun Rentals is still in existence in different form and owned and operated by Syd Stembridge, grand-nephew of the founder.\n\nHammerli Model 280 Semi-Auto Pistol .22 cal Pistol\n\nHämmerli is a Swiss manufacturer of firearms which are used in sport shooting and Olympic events.\n\nThe Hammerli Model 280 pictured below was a real firearm converted to blank fire and used by Bridget Fonda in publicity and principal photography for Point of No Return and also appears on the one sheet poster. In addition to conversion to blank fire, it was also custom chromed specifically for the production.\n\nProvenance & Authenticity\n\nThis piece was originally sold at the “Stembridge Collection” auction held by Little John’s Auction Service in June 2007. I subsequently purchased it from the collector who acquired the two pistols sold at auction. Below is the excerpt of the two lots from the Little John’s catalog:\n\nThis is actually the only Stembridge piece in my collection for which I do not have copies of the rental agreements.\n\nHowever, in addition to the custom chroming and attributions in the Little John’s catalog, I also have a letter from Carter Mountain Consulting Agency, the firm that was employed to conduct an inventory and appraisal of the assets of Stembridge Gun Rental Company in late 1998 through early 1999.\n\nAdditionally, I have been fortunate to have made a number of irrefutable matches to publicity material and screen shots in the film.\n\nThe first match is to the one sheet poster/image. I am still seeking an original negative quality image, it is possible to make out the last four digits of actual serial number of the weapon on the DVD cover (which is the same image as the one sheet poster). However, it is very faint and clarity is lost in photographing or scanning this image, so it is not possible to publish a compelling comparison in this article. Once I do find a better image, I will update this feature. Having said that, in addition to the matching serial number is also a mark near the safety button, which will be seen in more detail in following comparisons:\n\nI have also found photography representing a number of publicity photos, and have made several matches between the pistol that is the subject of this feature and the one that appears in these images.\n\nIn this first example, the same specific mark seen next to the safety button in the example above – an area with which it appears that the chrome did not take, and an area was filled in with silver paint, which is flaked off revealing black underneath – can also be seen in the publicity photo below:\n\nIn this second example, there are distinct marks in the chrome of the ejector port area on the gun in this additional publicity still (which appears to have come from the same session as the image used on the one sheet poster, based on the costume and hair styling):\n\nI have also been fortunate to have “screen-matched” this piece to still frame images in the Blu-Ray Disc version of the film, which is in high resolution at 1920×1080.\n\nBelow is a still from the scene in which Fonda opens the presentation box to reveal the pistol inside. Note that there is an area above the trigger in which the chrome did not adhere to the piece and was touched up with silver paint, and the same area on this pistol matches exactly:\n\nInterestingly, when Fonda opens the case the second time, it is a different pistol which does not have the same mark (in addition to using two pistols, there is a continuity error with the magazines):\n\nPoint of No Return Blu-Ray Disc Screencaptures\n\nMallory Knox (Portrayed by Juliette Lewis)\n\nHero Winchester Pump 12-Gauge Shotgun\n\nNatural Born Kills (1994)\n\nNatural Born Killers (Warner Bros., 1994) was one of the films made in the 1990s based on Quentin Tarantino’s work but directed by another filmmaker. Somewhat misunderstood by the public and media both at the time and today, it was actually a very prescient examination of the media and its obsession with crime and murder.\n\nStarring Woody Harrelson and Juliette Lewis as mass murderers on the run, this shotgun offered at auction was used by Lewis as Mallory Knox in the Oliver Stone film.\n\nThe Winchester Pump Shotgun 12-gauge was modified and customized by Stembridge Gun Rentals; the customization included baby blue paint, pistol grips, and a mounted cartridge block.\n\nThis weapon is held by Knox in many prominent publicity photos, held by her in the film in the context of “in film” publicity, and used in the film in the context of two actors playing Mickey and Mallory in the “American Maniacs” television show, hosted by Wayne Gale (as played by Robert Downey Jr.).\n\nProvenance includes Little John’s certificate of authenticity (previously from Stembridge collection), ScreenUsed COA, customization that matches film specs, rental agreements, and a direct match to several publicity photos.\n\nSpecific damage to the paint on the piece allows one to precisely match this specific piece to publicity photos, including the Blu-Ray disc cover."
