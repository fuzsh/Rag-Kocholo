JAMES BOND\n\nhalf dozen actors have portrayed him, and his missions have evolved in line with the global political climate. But the winning formula remains the same: evil villains, femmes fatales and (usually) shaken martinis have kept the franchise thriving. No superhero has been brought to life on the screen as often as James Bond has. He embarks on his 25th adventure in 2020, with Craig taking his final 007 turn, 58 years after Sean Connery first declared his name: Bond. James Bond. The franchise’s growth is never more evident than in this year’s No Time to Die.

In a short film for the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympics in London, Queen Elizabeth II stepped out of sober character and into a chaste dalliance with Daniel Craig, Bond himself. The film shows Craig arriving at Buckingham Palace and escorting the queen (below) into a helicopter. Later, Her Majesty parachutes from the helicopter into the Olympic stadium as jaws dropped around the world. Okay, it was stuntman Gary Connery, in a pink dress similar to the queen’s who did the skydive. Still it’s a measure of 007’s enormous appeal that the monarch partook.

And this the first Bond tale since the dawn of the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements. In 2015, Craig told the Red Bulletin that Bond is “actually a misogynist.” Waller-Bridge, a three-time Emmy winner and the creator of the comedy series Fleabag, has said that the newest Bond adaptation treats female characters better than they\n\nwere treated in previous films. “There’s been a lot of talk about whether or not [the Bond franchise] is relevant now because of who he is and the way he treats women,” she said. “I think that’s bollocks. I think he’s absolutely relevant now. It has just got to grow. It has just got to evolve, and the important thing is that the film treats the women properly,” Waller-Bridge told Deadline in 2019. “He doesn’t have to. He needs to be true to this character.” 5\n\nTimes may have changed, but 007 keeps saving the world from crime masters and mediocre martinis. B Y R ICH A R D C OR L IS S\n\nT\n\nMARY EVANS/EON/RONALD GRANT/EVERETT\n\nhe air is electric at the posh London casino. A beautiful woman has been losing big at chemin de fer. How does the stranger across the table manage to keep drawing better cards out of the shoe? Desperately, the woman borrows more to cover her bets, and the stranger says, “I admire your courage, Miss . . .” “Trench,” the brunette answers. “Sylvia Trench.” She appraises her rival with an envy edging toward lust. “I admire your luck, Mr. . . .” “Bond.” The silver cigarette lighter snaps shut to reveal a face of elegant cruelty: dimples welded like scars, incredible long whips of eyebrows, a full mouth ready for any challenge—to spit out a witticism, to commandeer a kiss, to sip from the cup of revenge. To say his name: “James Bond.” Moviegoers first heard that terse exchange in a London theater on October 5, 1962. That same week, Johnny Carson became host of The Tonight Show, and Pope John XXIII adorned the cover of Time. In two weeks, Khrushchev and Kennedy would go eyeball to eyeball in a dispute over Cuban missiles. So who cared about the world premiere of Dr. No, the first film made from Ian Fleming’s James Bond novels, or about the introduction of Sean Connery as Her Majesty’s hunkiest secret servant? Who knew? Fifty-seven years later—also 10 Presidents, five popes, three Tonight Show hosts and some 2,800 issues of Time—the Soviet Union has disappeared, depriving the West of its longtime world threat, and Bond of a favorite nemesis. The entertainment landscape has changed, as most people see movies on home video or personal electronic devices. Fleming himself died in 1964, having written 12 Bond novels and eight short stories. Yet the Bond films abide, in movie\n\ntheaters, on DVD and as spin-off animated series and video games. Before sequels became the most reliable way to make a buck, Bond set the standard for lavish serial adventures. Before Hollywood found gold in big-budget adaptations of comic-book sagas—in the Superman, Batman and Spider-Man blockbusters— Bond was the movies’ first franchise superhero. Spanning more than half a century of feature films, Bond is also the longest-running continuous English-language movie series. Things change, including the actors who play him, but Bond goes on saving the world from megalomaniacal crime masters, heartless femmes fatales and indifferently prepared martinis. This multimedia legend has also weathered many changes of leading actors. Bond was first played by Barry Nelson, in a 48-minute adaptation of Casino Royale on the 1954 American television anthology series Climax! (with Peter Lorre as the villainous Le Chiffre). In the 1967 spoof version of the same novel, at least six actors—David Niven, Peter Sellers and Ursula Andress among them—laid claim to being 007. But in the official Bond films supervised by Harry Saltzman and Albert R. “Cubby” Broccoli, and then by Barbara Broccoli and Michael G. Wilson, so far, there have been a half dozen: Connery in six films (Dr. No, From Russia with Love, Goldfinger, Thunderball, You Only Live Twice and Diamonds Are Forever, plus the “unofficial” Never Say Never Again), the Australian model George Lazenby in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Roger Moore in seven (Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun, The Spy Who Loved Me, Moonraker, For Your Eyes Only, Octopussy and A View to a Kill), Timothy Dalton in two (The Living Daylights and Licence to\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nM\n\noney’s nice, and if Bond hadn’t made a bundle he wouldn’t still be around. But the true measure of the franchise is its cultural and political impact. Begun in the deep freeze of the Cold War, as the world was suffering its worst case of nuclear nerves, the Bond films lifted grim reality airborne into wish fulfillment. It could almost be said that this fictional British spy changed the world as much as any actual secret agent. Any actual British Secret Service operative in 1962, a year after the Berlin Wall went up, might have been underground in the U.S.S.R. or the German Democratic Republic, matching wits and fists with members of the Soviet spy syndicate SMERSH (a Russian acronym for “Death of Spies”). The agency figures importantly in three of Fleming’s first five Bond novels: Casino Royale, Live and Let Die and From Russia with Love (even though the real-world organization had technically dissolved in 1946). Yet SMERSH is mentioned in just two of the Broccoli Bond films, From Russia with Love and the 1987 The Living Daylights (and in the 1967 non-Broccoli Casino Royale). In the entire Bond canon, only one scene is set at the Berlin Wall—at the beginning of the 1983 Octopussy, released six years before that cold war fixture crumbled. Otherwise, Bond left the grittier aspects of British spying to the films made from John le Carré and Len Deighton novels. That was fine with the Broccolis, who always had sharp business instincts. They realized that, with a worldwide audience lapping up the franchise, it would be fiscally irresponsible to write off the whole communist world by casting MARY EVANS/EON/RONALD GRANT/EVERETT\n\n8\n\nearned much more; the 1965 Thunderball took in today’s equivalent of more than a billion all by itself.\n\nEVERETT\n\nKill), Pierce Brosnan in four (GoldenEye, Tomorrow Never Dies, The World Is Not Enough and Die Another Day), and Daniel Craig in five (Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, Skyfall, Spectre and No Time to Die). Bond is a family business: Barbara Broccoli is Cubby’s daughter, Wilson his stepson. And over the decades, the creative team has remained remarkably consistent. Richard Maibaum wrote or co-wrote 13 of the first 16 films; Neal Purvis and Robert Wade have written or cowritten the last seven. Composer John Barry, production designer Ken Adam and Maurice Binder, who created the swirling opening-credits sequences, stayed with the franchise for a generation or more. Directors have been chosen usually from the middle rank of the British pack; the Broccolis, who run this producers’ franchise, haven’t followed the trend of Marvel comics movies, where quirky auteurs like Sam Raimi and Joss Whedon stamp their personalities on blockbuster projects. When they needed a new man behind the megaphone, the Broccolis often have promoted from within: editor Peter Hunt, second-unit director John Glen. This familiar loyalty has extended to the supporting cast. Only four actors (Bernard Lee, Robert Brown, Judi Dench and Ralph Fiennes) have played Bond’s spy boss M; only three (Desmond Llewelyn, John Cleese and Ben Whishaw) have played the gadgetmaster Q. The series is big business too. The first 24 Broccoli Bonds have earned something like $7 billion around the world. (Broccoli did not produce the 1967 Casino Royale—the team would finally film that property in 2006—or Connery’s freelance return to the role in the aforementioned 1983 Never Say Never Again.) In “real dollars,” the series has\n\nUNITED ARTISTS/EVERETT\n\nEVERETT\n\nSoviets as bad guys. So Bond found villains in rogue warriors, not cold warriors. In six of the first seven installments, Bond grapples with the international conspiracy known as SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), a clear inspiration for the League of Shadows in Christopher Nolan’s Batman films. Throughout the Bond series, the U.S.S.R. remained an irrelevance, occasionally a gruff ally. Indeed, in A View to a Kill—released in 1985, two years before Ronald Reagan went to Berlin and challenged Mikhail Gorbachev to “Tear down this wall!”— “Comrade Bond” was awarded the Order of Lenin. “Make no mistake,” real-life U.S. secret agent Valerie Plame wrote in Variety, “Bond is an assassin, as his special ‘00’ code indicates. His job isn’t to form relationships, it’s to end them.” Yet in the permanent fantasy land of popular entertainment, this assassin gave the traditional action hero modern attitudes and equipment. He brought a killer’s lightning instincts to Sherlock Holmes, a suave caress to crude Mike Hammer, the microchip age to Dick Tracy’s gadgets. His films were comic strips with grown-up cynicism, Hitchcock thrillers without the artistic risks. Bond, especially Connery’s Bond, was an existential hired gun with an aristocrat’s tastes— just right for a time when class was a matter of brand names and insouciant gestures. “My dear girl,” Bond tells a new conquest in the 1964 Goldfinger, “there are some things that just aren’t done. Such as drinking Dom Perignon ’53 above a temperature of 38 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s as bad as listening to the Beatles without earmuffs.” Minutes later the dear girl’s body is lacquered to death by Auric Goldfinger’s\n\nKorean manservant. But death doesn’t shake Bond’s assurance in his infallibility—or in his mandarin musical prejudice against the other great British export of the 1960s. To an empire that had seen its realm shrink with the loss of the Indian subcontinent, and its secret service embarrassed by the Cambridge Five and Profumo scandals, the notion of an agent from the U.K. saving the free world was an intoxicating tonic. Britain mattered. Britain was cool. (And the U.S., as epitomized by Bond’s CIA ally Felix Leiter, was just a sidekick.) If the Beatles made England swing for the young, then Bond was a travel-poster boy for the earmuff brigade. The Bond films even put a few theme songs, such as Paul McCartney’s “Live and Let Die,” on the pop charts. In its first flush of fame, the Bond series spawned a whole genre of superspy imitators—Matt Helm and Harry Palmer in ’60s movies, Maxwell Smart and the men and girls from U.N.C.L.E. on TV. The Beatles shot some of their second movie, Help!, in the Bahamas partly because they heard that the latest Bond film, Thunderball, was going there for location work. The upstarts were following the big boy. Later a young generation of filmmakers found inspiration in the series’ success. You hear its echoes in hundreds of hightech adventure movies, from Star Wars (with Darth Vader as a more sepulchral Dr. No) and Raiders of the Lost Ark (007 as an archaeologist) up to The Dark Knight Rises (superhero vs. maniacal, aphorism-spouting villain). Some of the influence was direct: John Stears, the effects wizard of Star Wars, supervised the visual tricks on six early Bonds. Other directors learned just by watching, as enthralled kids who grew up to 9\n\nbring their own spin to the brut effervescence and special-effects expertise bottled in Bond.\n\nJ\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nMGM/ENTERTAINMENT PICTURES/ZUMA\n\n10\n\nUNITED ARTISTS/EVERETT\n\names Bond could have been Jane Bond. In 1955, not long after the publication of Casino Royale, the Russian-born producer-director Gregory Ratoff optioned the book and hired the young Lorenzo Semple Jr. (who later did the screenplay for Never Say Never Again) to write a script. Neither man thought much of the main character. “Frankly, we thought he was kind of unbelievable and as I recall, even kind of stupid,” Semple recalled in Variety. “So Gregory thought the solution was to make Bond a woman, ‘Jane Bond’ if you will, and he even had a plan to cast Susan Hayward in the role.” The notion of a top dramatic actress from Brooklyn to play the veddy British, type-A male 007 came to naught, and a few years later Harry Saltzman snagged the rights to most of Fleming’s Bond books. As the first two decades of Bond films made celebrities of his enemies (Oddjob, Rosa Klebb, Ernst Stavro Blofeld, Jaws), so they incited schoolboy snickers with the names of his women. Pussy Galore and Octopussy! Kissy Suzuki and Plenty O’Toole! Mary Goodnight and Holly Goodhead! They were as indispensable and interchangeable as 007’s other accessories, the Walther PPK and the Aston Martin. In the early ’60s the Fleming books enjoyed a boost in popularity when President Kennedy sang their praises in LIFE magazine. The endorsement was apt, for Bond in the early Connery years comprised equal parts Jack Kennedy’s playboy glamour and Hugh Hefner’s Playboy Philosophy. In that man’s-man’s world, women were to\n\nbe valued as playmates, allies or adversaries, and mostly as ornaments. Goldfinger’s Pussy Galore (Honor Blackman) might be a judo expert who could toss Bond like a crepe, but he would pin her with a wolfish double entendre: “We must have a few fast falls together some time.” Or, as he says when his bedtime with another Goldfinger lovely, Jill Masterson (Shirley Eaton), is interrupted by an urgent phone call from Leiter, “No, look, I’m sorry. I can’t. Something big’s come up.” Back in 1964, Bond’s allusion to his tumescent member earned a gasp or a giggle. That suited suave 007; recall that most films gave him two “Bond Girls” (the blonde, the brunette) to tangle with. The playboy would enjoy his sport with them and then move on. His roving eye was in part a function of a spy’s globetrotting itinerary. Other movie superheroes could form lasting partnerships—Superman/ Clark Kent with Lois Lane, Batman/Bruce Wayne with Rachel Dawes—because they lived and worked in one city (Metropolis, Gotham). For all their preternatural skills, they were tethered to their jobs as, respectively, reporter and philanthropist: essentially working stiffs. Bond was always working, and often stiff, but his jet-set escapades virtually demanded that he get in bed with the enemy. That job requirement would put a crimp in any affair back home with, say, Miss Moneypenny. Yet, even at the start, the Bond Girl was as clever, efficient and often as ruthless in combat as she was exciting in bed—a Jane Bond, if you will. And though the series never merited a citation from Ms. magazine, it gradually insinuated a certain sly feminism. Bond was still susceptible to European beauties of no fixed abode or accent,\n\nand spy fiction (Matt Damon’s amnesiac secret agent Jason Bourne). Bond needed a makeover, and got it in the 2006 Casino Royale. The movie showed a perfect figure rising from the sea—lubricated and lubricious, like Ursula Andress in Dr. No—but this body belonged not to any Bond enchantress but to Daniel Craig, with Sisyphus shoulders and pecs so well defined they could be in Webster’s. If Craig spent more time with his shirt off than all previous Bonds combined, it was to make the point that this secret agent was his own sex object. Figuring that modern audiences preferred murderous fights to martini-sipping, the Broccoli brain trust made Craig’s 007 a working-class bloke, as much thug as thinker. Instead of the 007 of the Fleming canon—a tough gentleman spy, schooled at Eton and Cambridge—Craig is nearly a cyber- or cipher-Bond. In lieu of the bons mots assigned to Connery, Moore and Brosnan, Craig communicates in grunts and sullen, conceivably soulful, laser stares. For this 007, spying is no game; it’s work, a epending on the actor, portrayals of 007 job that has become a compulsion. Craig’s 007 is a have alternated between Rough Bond brute: Rambo in a tux and, even more so, a Bourneand Smooth Bond. Moore was amiable again Bond. and reliable. Dalton, a West End stage luminary Rather than losing faith in the traditional Bond with heartthrob looks, played Bond with the by jolting 007 into gritty modernism, the Broccoli ironic scowl of a killer who is battle-ready yet team is simply showing the adaptability that has war-weary. Dalton did a lot of his own stunts, sustained the series for more than a half century. and he cut a smart figure in a tuxedo—especially The Craig Bond might in fact be what the Connery the one with the Velcro lapels, in The Living Bond would have been if the franchise had started Daylights, that could fold over to give him the from scratch now.

They could fight manfully; he could fall in love. He married one of them, Contessa Teresa di Vicenzo (Diana Rigg) in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, which of course meant she had to die violently. More than a few Bond girls had the IQ and skills set to match his: ace pilot and former CIA operative Pam Bouvier (Carey Lowell) in Licence to Kill; rocket scientist, also ex-CIA, Holly Goodhead (Lois Chiles) in Moonraker; nuclear physicist Dr. Christmas Jones (Denise Richards) in The World Is Not Enough.

JAMES BOND\n\nI\n\nEVERETT\n\nin World War II; this, coupled with a passing reference to retirement age in Moonraker, would peg Bond, born sometime in the late 1920s, to a younger generation. Valentine Fleming, Ian’s father, was killed in action during World War I when the boy was 9; Bond’s parents both died in a climbing accident when he was young. Bond and Fleming attended Eton and excelled at schoolboy athletics (Fleming, however, was not expelled for a sexual liaison with an Eton maid as Bond was). Bond’s height (six feet), hairstyle and eye color are the same as Fleming’s. The most interesting parallels have always been based upon Fleming’s World War II career, which drew him and his fictional counterpart into the world of British Military Intelligence. During the war, Fleming rose to the rank of lieutenant commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer\n\nLOOMIS DEAN\n\nt has been said: Many millions of men around the world have wanted to be James Bond. Ian Fleming was the first. That’s as it should be, of course; he had ownership rights. Quite literally, Bond was Fleming’s baby, born of nothing but his febrile imagination. From the first, Fleming formed his fictional hero in his own self-image, and wasn’t shy about this even as he was also happy to cultivate a certain air of mystery. He was one of a few successful British male authors including Graham Greene and John le Carré (the latter of whom will not like being lumped with Fleming and has voiced a strong distaste for Bond) who wrote exclusively or occasionally about espionage; who were happy to acknowledge that their own past histories in wartime intelligence informed their fiction; and who were good-looking guys, not shy in front of a camera. Many of the best portraits of Fleming have the ubiquitous cigarette smoke swirling in a frame around his handsome face, his fixed gaze encouraging the question: Who is this man? Is he James Bond? In certain essentials, yes, yes he was. Both Ian and James were, to return to those photographs, chain smokers—Fleming worse even than Bond, who early in the first novel lights his 17th cigarette of the day (Fleming reportedly enjoyed four times that). Both liked to drink, certainly too heavily. Both were attractive to women, and both were womanizers. If Fleming calmed down (somewhat) after his marriage in 1952 at age 43 to Ann Geraldine Charteris, it can be noted that it was his affair with Ann that led to her divorce from Viscount Rothermere. Bond, too, had occasion to sleep with married women. This kind of symbiosis goes further back. M (well, Fleming, writing as M) submitted an obituary of Bond to The Times of London in You Only Live Twice, and many holes were filled in. Bond’s birthdate was never given (perhaps in a moment of self-loathing, Fleming once awarded his own birthdate, May 28, 1908, to the arch-criminal Ernst Stavro Blofeld), but it was said that Bond had lied about his age in order to qualify for active service\n\nOn the previous pages and on these two, Fleming adopts suitable poses for a successful writer of espionage thrillers—all photographs taken circa 1960. He is at this point in time known as James Bond’s author, and more than two thirds of the oeuvre has been written, but Bond is still several months away from his debut on the big screen. 15\n\nLOOMIS DEAN\n\nEVENING STANDARD/HULTON/GETTY\n\nSUSANNAH IRELAND/THE TIMES/NI SYNDICATION\n\nTHE TIMES/NI SYNDICATION\n\nLOOMIS DEAN\n\nTHE LIFE AS LIVED\n\nReserve (as would Bond) and worked directly, and admirably, for the director of Naval Intelligence. His so-called Trout Memo, which urged a flyfishing deception method, was instrumental in the successful Operation Mincemeat of 1943. “A Suggestion (not a very nice one),” was how Fleming headlined his memorandum. “The following suggestion is used in a book by Basil Thomson: a corpse dressed as an airman, with dispatches in his pockets, could be dropped on the coast, supposedly from a parachute that has failed. I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it would have to be a fresh one.” Fleming was also in charge of Operation 16\n\nLIFE BOND.

He consulted as well on T-Force, whose operations greatly informed the action in the third Bond novel, 1955’s Moonraker. During World War II, Fleming confided that one day he hoped to write a spy novel. He was certainly gathering the goods. “[Bond] was a compound of all the secret agents and commandos I met during the war,” he later acknowledged. Foremost, besides himself, were his revered older brother, Peter, who was instrumental in behind-the-lines ops in Norway and Greece (and who would go on to be a\n\nLOOMIS DEAN\n\nOn this page, at left, Fleming is seen with his wife, Ann (top), and son, Caspar (below). Theirs was not a solid family unit; Ann considered her husband’s writing “cheap pornography”; he would not attend her dinner parties; neither paid attention to Caspar, who was shuffled off to boarding schools. During his years at Eton, Caspar was discovered with a cache of guns; he dropped out of Oxford and died by his own hand in 1975. Ian Fleming was self-absorbed and career oriented, whether posing for LIFE with handguns (top right) or fancy cars (opposite) to further the Bond legend, contributing information during the war to the director of Naval Intelligence (above, center) or working for the Times. Above, right: An unbylined piece by foreign correspondent Fleming in 1939.\n\n18\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nGolf Club in Sandwich, Kent, is certainly the model for Royal St. Mark’s, where Bond and Goldfinger duel; he loved skiing and the Alps, and these are integral in On Her Majesty’s Secret Service; he loved snorkeling and scuba diving, and there, then, is Thunderball; he loved bridge, and Bond bests Sir Hugo Drax in Moonraker; he loved scrambled eggs, and Bond, epicure though he is, does too. There was a history of heart disease in Fleming’s family—plus there were all those cigarettes smoked and cocktails imbibed over the years—and he suffered his first major heart attack in 1962 at 53 years of age. He was never the same, and was stricken again at the Royal St. George’s Golf Club on August 12, 1964—the 12th birthday of his son, Caspar. (A decade on, tragically, Caspar would take his own life.) Fleming would die at the hospital, but en route he said to the ambulance drivers, “I am sorry to trouble you chaps. I don’t know how you get along so fast with the traffic on the roads these days.” The eternally composed James Bond might have said the same.\n\nDAVE G.

So Fleming, who took jobs in journalism in the postwar years, had the stuff of James Bond, but not yet the impetus. That arrived early in 1952 when he and Ann, who was pregnant, agreed to marry. To relieve tension, Fleming took to the desk at his Goldeneye estate in Jamaica and wrote Casino Royale in little more than two months. Fleming lived long enough to author 14 books, to enjoy some of Bond’s success (but not the übercelebrity that would follow the Goldfinger and then Thunderball movies) and to shore up the notion that he was Bond. Fleming loved to travel, and all Bond novels except Moonraker featured travel; he loved Jamaica, and Live and Let Die, Dr. No and The Man with the Golden Gun have settings there; he loved cars; he loved golf, and his Royal St. George’s\n\nPHOTOGRAPH © HARRY BENSON 1964\n\nHis Goldeneye retreat in Oracabessa on the north shore of Jamaica meant everything to Fleming, and was where just about all of the Bond prose was fashioned—when the dogs would leave him be. He bought the property atop a cliff and built his three-bedroom house before fame overtook him; he enjoyed entertaining there and hosted many friends from the cultural and political worlds. At one point, he said the estate’s name was a tribute to Carson McCullers’s novel Reflections in a Golden Eye; at another point he said it was a nod to Operation Golden Eye, with which he had been affiliated during the war. The name was never used by him for a Bond novel, but was the title of the first film starring Pierce Brosnan as 007 in 1995. Twelve years after Fleming died, reggae star Bob Marley looked into buying the property, but it was ultimately sold to his friend Chris Blackwell, the music mogul and producer. Fleming used to enjoy Goldeneye’s private beach. Today, the adjacent James Bond Beach, where Ursula Andress once filmed scenes for Dr. No, is known for its two-story Moonraker bar and its annual music concerts and festivals, which have featured such stars as Bob’s son Ziggy Marley and Rihanna. 19\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES\n\nIn 1964 the word in New York City’s Times Square was: Bond is back! More than half a century later, 007 is as lethal as ever.\n\nAMERICAN BOND 1954\n\nCASINO ROYALE\n\nA\n\ns has been mentioned earlier in our book, the first movie adaptation of a Bond novel appeared on television in 1954, when Casino Royale was Americanized one year after its publication as a novel in England. As an episode in the CBS anthology series Climax!, the film, broadcast live, didn’t create much of a stir at the time and was believed lost for years. But since a recording of the original Casino Royale was found in 1981, the film has achieved a certain cachet. Casino Royale is one of the rare episodes of Climax! that currently is available commercially, another being an adaptation of Robert Louis Stevenson’s The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde written by none other than Gore Vidal. You can also find the 1967 comedic version of Casino Royale and MGM has updated their Bond 50 box set to include the 23 official 007 films up through Skyfall, so there is much for Bond aficionados to explore and enjoy.\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK? He was a newly successful writer of thrillers, so of course was thrilled in turn by a quick adaptation of his first book, especially since Casino Royale hadn’t sold well in the American market. Having his austere Bond turned into a CIA agent called Jimmy probably amused as much as it rankled. No doubt the conflations of certain characters necessitated by the 48-minute running time seemed odd to Fleming.\n\nFor such a run-of-the-mill project (American television in the mid-1950s was becoming adept at churning out product to feed the beast, and in four years there were no fewer than 166 episodes of Climax!), Casino Royale featured personnel of pedigree. Le Chiffre was played by the legendary Peter Lorre (in the white dinner jacket, at right, during the torture scene—much toned down from the novel—with Barry Nelson as Bond in the tub). The music for the teleplay was composed by Jerry Goldsmith, who went on to score scores of TV shows and films (including five Star Treks) and who won an Oscar for The Omen. Then of course there was Nelson himself, a fine actor, and also the coscreenwriter Charles Bennett. Bennett not only scripted Alfred Hitchcock classics of the 1930s when he and Hitch were still at home in England but went on to write Curse of the Demon (1957), Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea (1961) and City in the Sea (1965).\n\nCBS PHOTO ARCHIVE/GETTY (2)\n\nCLASS ACTS\n\nTOP SECRET ■ The Barry Nelson character is a CIA agent,\n\nnot MI6, and for his prowess at baccarat, which will thwart Le Chiffre in a climactic scene, is given the code nickname “Card Sense Jimmy Bond.” ■ Casino Royale was the third episode in the\n\nfirst season of Climax! and was followed by an adaptation of Sorry, Wrong Number. Eventually the series strayed from its hard-boiled roots and included versions of American literary classics such as The Adventures of\n\nHuckleberry Finn and A Farewell to Arms, and even baseball movies, including Fear Strikes Out and The Lou Gehrig Story. ■ It is not true that Peter Lorre, playing the\n\njust-killed villain Le Chiffre, arose during a live shot and walked off set. That is a durable myth, albeit with some basis in fact. In the very first episode of Climax!, the fabulously named Tristram Coffin, playing a stiff in an adaptation of Raymond Chandler’s The Long Goodbye, did rise from the dead a mite too soon, stunning the audience at home.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ Do you remember Byron Lee and the\n\nDragonaires? The pioneering Jamaican ska band, who backed such stars as Jimmy Cliff on recordings, contributed several songs to the film and appeared in one scene as a hotel house band performing “Jump Up.” The “Bond music” itself was, from the first, composed and orchestrated by Englishman John Barry—with the important caveat that Monty Norman was credited with the famous theme, after there was some discussion about who contributed which notes. ■ It’s fitting that Dr. No was the initial foray\n\ninto feature films: The novel was born, in\n\n1956, as a screenplay—done by Fleming for what would have been a British television series entitled Commander Jamaica. When that didn’t pan out, Fleming used his script as the basis for a book, sixth in the Bond series and published on March 31, 1958. ■ There is evidence that the producers\n\nwanted to really churn out these Bond films: The initial contract offered to Connery was for six movies in just three years. The actor had previously had a bad experience with 20th Century Fox and demurred, which certainly proved a good thing for moviegoers everywhere. Connery retained the liberty to play other roles, and the Bond frequency was reduced to one per year.\n\n1 1962\n\nDR. NO\n\nO\n\nbviously, it took a while for James Bond to make it to the big screen, and by the time he did Ian Fleming was a success story, with his yearly thrillers selling impressively on both sides of the pond. Following the American TV production of Casino Royale in 1954, there were overtures and even plans for more adaptations, but nothing happened for the longest time. In 1960, Canadian producer Harry Saltzman set his mind on Bond and approached Fleming. To make certain Saltzman would put considerable energy behind any\n\nproject, Fleming asked a king’s ransom: $50,000 for a six-month license to get something moving, and an additional $100,000 when a film was released. Saltzman drew a breath, said yes, and then partnered with coproducer Cubby Broccoli. Dr. No was chosen to be the first feature film. The talent search to “Find James Bond” yielded a few finalists, who auditioned for Saltzman, Broccoli and Fleming, and a leader emerged in male model Peter Anthony (a harbinger of actor George Lazenby?), but he was ultimately nixed by Broccoli. The chosen one: Sean Connery.\n\nEVERETT\n\nJoseph Wiseman, seen opposite at left with costars Sean Connery and Ursula Andress and, at right, insulated against his own poisonous malevolence, was not only not Asian, he really had little concept of what was going on. A native of Montreal, he was a veteran of the stage, praised for his turns in King Lear, Uncle Vanya, Clifford Odets’s Golden Boy and Jean Anouilh’s The Lark. “A life being enacted onstage is a thing of utter fascination to me,” he once said. “And acting, it may begin out of vanity but you hope that it’s taken over by something else. I hope I’ve climbed over the vanity hurdle.” So he wasn’t some villainous add-on, he was a thinking person’s thespian. In movies, he had played opposite giants: Kirk Douglas in Detective Story and Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata! To him, Dr. No, for which the late Joseph Wiseman will forever be remembered, looked like a paycheck: “I had no idea what I was letting myself in for. I had no idea it would achieve the success it did. I know nothing about mysteries. I don’t take to them. As far as I was concerned, I thought it might be just another grade-B Charlie Chan mystery.”\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES\n\nWHAT’S UP, DOC?\n\n25\n\nBOX OFFICE\n\nEVERETT\n\nBoffo, considering it was the first. Released on May 8, 1963, it sold 19 million tickets in the States, grossed $16 million in the U.S. and $59.5 million worldwide; converted to 2020 dollars, that’s more than $500 million—a solid hit by anyone’s standards.\n\nFUN IN THE SUN Filmed in part in Ian Fleming’s beloved Jamaica, hard by the writer’s estate Goldeneye, Dr. No was a lighthearted affair for the production crew and cast. The set was absent the kind of pressures that would eventually accrue on Bond productions, when expectations were set so high. This prevalent attitude infected the film, which director Terence Young and Sean Connery saw as much more comedic and less severe than Fleming’s gripping novels.\n\nGIFT FROM THE SEA\n\nUNITED ARTISTS/MOVIEPIX/GETTY\n\nSo one day producers Broccoli and Saltzman are sifting through a sheaf of publicity shots of beautiful young women whose agents would like to have them be considered for the role of Honey Ryder, who would be— unbeknownst to all at the time—the original (and, many think, the quintessence) of a substantial sorority of Bond Girls. Suddenly, Broccoli pauses on a photo of Ursula Andress walking out of the surf. “Well,” he says, “this is the girl, Harry.” And indeed she was. Andress, seen here larking about with Connery on the set, was a Swiss actress about to make a substantial splash—and then a couple of career mistakes. Her iconic scene where she rises from the Caribbean Sea in a white bikini was an entrance equal to Connery’s “Bond . . . James Bond.” (By the way, Ursula’s swimwear sold at auction in 2001 for nearly $60,000.) Despite having her role entirely dubbed—she had a Germanic accent—Andress won a Golden Globe as Most Promising Newcomer in 1964, which today seems laughable. She posed nude for Playboy magazine the following year, explaining her rationale: “Because I’m beautiful.” Then she said goodbye to Broccoli and Saltzman by agreeing to appear in the Bond parody Casino Royale in 1967. She has been heard from since, but not often. 27\n\nWe know he didn’t think Connery was right for the role, we know he wanted a more cerebral and brutal Bond and we know he had a nice time visiting the set (opposite). We know he was happy with the initial checks mailed by Saltzman and Co. and then thrilled with the subsequent ones after the movie opened, not to mention the booming sales of his books. Commander Fleming was now on board. 28\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nDANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK?\n\n2 1963\n\nFROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE\n\nT\n\nhere was little doubt after Dr. No that James Bond would return to theaters, and would again be personified by Sean Connery. Crucially, director Terence Young returned for a second turn as well, and he and Connery refined their winking vision of Ian Fleming’s superspy. Add-ons, including cool toys deployed by Bond and his SPECTRE nemeses, were firmly installed as de rigueur parts of the Bond formula as well, and still today Rosa Klebb’s blade-hidden-in-the-shoe is revered by Bond fans. (In From Russia with Love,\n\nthe actor Desmond Llewelyn as Major Boothroyd, Head of Q Section—the British military intelligence gadgetry unit—stamps himself an early Hall of Fame associate along with Bernard Lee as M and Lois Maxwell as Miss Moneypenny; the character Felix Leiter is on hiatus after Dr. No, but will return to the series, though Jack Lord, the original Leiter, will be banished after a contract dispute.) Russia remains today among the most thrilling Bond entries: a true spy caper. Many consider it the very best Bond film of all.\n\nBOX OFFICE\n\nA point to be made here: During the time that Fleming was alive for the production of four sanctioned Bond movies, including the TV offering, filmmakers were actually adapting the books. They weren’t just attaching a Fleming (or Flemingesque) title to an entirely unrelated plotline; they were paying attention to source material. Russia was a Fleming movie, and the reviews following its October 1963 release were terrific. 30\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nUNITED ARTISTS/MOVIEPIX/GETTY\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK?\n\nCHRIS WARE/KEYSTONE FEATURES/HULTON/GETTY\n\nBoffo, and certainly reason to forge ahead. A total of 26.8 million tickets sold in the U.S. translated to domestic grosses of $24.8 million, up more than 50 percent over Dr. No. Worldwide grosses of $78.9 million would equate to $664 million today, besting four Roger Moore films and all of Timothy Dalton’s and Pierce Brosnan’s.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ Desperate to come up with a successor\n\nto Ursula Andress, the producers sent out a press release summoning a “voluptuous, young Greta Garbo.” Name actresses were considered, but ultimately the Italian model and Miss Universe runner-up Daniela Bianchi (seen on these pages) was chosen (reportedly with Sean Connery’s urging). ■ Another note on Bianchi: Part of her screen\n\ntest was a session on the bed with a Connery stand-in (the photo on the opposite page is from the rehearsal, and that’s the real Bond). After her selection, this horizontal\n\naudition before the director and producers was legendarily the most important test a prospective Bond Girl needed to pass. ■ LIFE magazine was talking with U.S.\n\nPresident John F. Kennedy, and he allowed that From Russia with Love was one of his 10 favorite books. This made news, and producers Saltzman and Broccoli, sniffing free publicity, chose Russia, Fleming’s fifth novel in the series—published in 1957 and with events set in the summer of ’54—as their Dr. No follow-up. On November 20, 1963, JFK screened the film at the White House. This was the last movie he ever saw, as he left for Dallas shortly thereafter.\n\nDANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\n32\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nThe James Bond films have in their 50-plus years featured a large number of famous folk (or folk who would go on to greater fame) who have dropped by to portray heroes or villains—people from cultural icons of the moment like Grace Jones (May Day in A View to a Kill) to eternal legends like Orson Welles (the villain Le Chiffre in the comedy version of Casino Royale). In From Russia with Love, a semi-legendary Austrian actress/singer and a British fellow destined for great cinematic things were memorable baddies. Do you recognize the actor behind the grim visage of assassin Donald Grant? It is a young, buff, blond-on-blond Robert Shaw, who would later play Henry VIII in A Man for All Seasons and, indelibly, the shark-hunter Quint in Jaws. His female accomplice here is none other than the Tony Award–winning (for her husband Kurt Weill’s The Threepenny Opera), Oscar-nominated (for The Roman Spring of Mrs. Stone) Lotte Lenya as the sadistic Rosa Klebb. Lenya—yes, she gets a shout-out in the “Mack the Knife” lyrics as belted by Louis Armstrong and later Bobby Darin—was an enormous theatrical and classical music figure well before she accepted the role in a Bond film, but because of her classic last scene when she is trying to kick Sean Connery with the poisoned toe spike that had been hidden in her shoe (she’s eventually shot dead by the Daniela Bianchi character, Tatiana Romanova), Lenya was always remembered by some for one thing only. She said that for the rest of her days the first thing people did after being introduced to her was to look at her shoes.\n\nUNITED ARTISTS/MOVIEPIX/GETTY\n\nCLASS ACTS\n\nTHE SPECTER OF SPECTRE In the Bond novels, our favorite British agent fought the Soviet Union’s SMERSH regularly, but opposed the international crime conglomerate focused on world domination, SPECTRE (SPecial Executive for Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion), only a few times, most prominently in 1961’s Thunderball. In the Bond movies, by contrast, SPECTRE was a fixture: Dr. Julius No worked for the organization, as did Rosa Klebb and (again in this picture, getting his comeuppance) Donald Grant. SPECTRE’s evil overlord Ernst Stavro Blofeld makes his first appearance, a brief one, in From Russia with Love, and meatier roles are ahead.\n\n3 1964\n\nGOLDFINGER\n\nE\n\nverything about it was golden: The song, the soundtrack, the number of tickets sold, the general furor—if furor can have a hue. MI6 and CIA agents and SMERSH veterans couldn’t wait to see Goldfinger, and neither could anyone else. This was one of those event openings that we have become used to, along the lines of Star Wars: The Last Jedi or Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales. A successful series has built a fan base, the producers know they have a terrific movie in the hopper, and suddenly all the world is queuing up. Back in 1964, such excitement over the latest installment in a film franchise was novel, and the rules that have led us to worldwide midnight screenings were just being written. In looking back, we now know that mistakes were nearly made—Harry Saltzman tried to kill the theme song, for goodness’ sake!—but in the end, Goldfinger got just about everything right. Needless to say, it was richly rewarded for this. It reaped the gold.\n\nDANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK (2)\n\n34\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nSCENE STEALER If Lotte Lenya was forevermore remembered for a custom-made shoe, then Shirley Eaton, who made the cover of LIFE magazine in her golden girl get-up, left a legacy that was all asterisk: She was the British actress who played Jill Masterson, who suffered death by “skin suffocation” (a Fleming invention, scientifically impossible) after being painted head-to-toe by Goldfinger’s henchman,\n\nOddjob. Eaton, here with Connery and opposite in the midst of her hour-and-a-halflong gilding session with makeup artist Paul Rabiger, was apparently so convincing in her death scene that an urban myth grew that she had actually been killed during filming. In fact, she retired from acting not long after to raise her family. She had a long marriage that ended with her husband’s death.\n\n35\n\nGert FrÖbe, who played Auric Goldfinger as he engineered a caper to knock off Fort Knox and make away with enough bullion to sate even his outsize appetites, was a German actor whose accent was so thick that his dialogue was dubbed (retaining a hint of the Germanic). Fröbe’s career is rife with Bond six-degrees-of-separation associations. Among the movies in which he starred was Three Penny Opera—the music for which was composed by Kurt Weill, husband of Lotte Lenya (From Russia with Love’s Rosa Klebb), and for which Lenya, on a New York City stage, won her Tony Award. Another Fröbe vehicle was the 1968 hit musical Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, based on Ian Fleming’s children’s book and produced by Bond series chieftain Cubby Broccoli. Besides Fröbe, Chitty featured Mary Poppins veteran Dick Van Dyke and composers Richard and Robert Sherman. Time magazine said the film’s songs had “all the rich melodic variety of an automobile horn,” but that nonetheless the family-fare movie was welcome relief in an era rife with the kinds of films the Goldfinger-spurred Bond craze encouraged: “At a time when violence and sex are the dual sellers at the box office, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang looks better than it is simply because it’s not not all all bad bad.” 36\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES\n\nA BOND-WORTHY VILLAIN\n\nTOP SECRET ■ Director Guy Hamilton wanted to use a\n\nreal laser for the famous scene in which Bond is nearly cleft in twain by Goldfinger. That was deemed too dangerous, which no doubt relieved Sean Connery. Instead, an acetylene torch concealed beneath the table cut through from below; the sparks were real, and Connery’s sweat was surely due in part to the heat. A dummy laser above created the light beam. ■ Oddjob’s Ford Ranchero truck was even\n\nmore of a miracle vehicle than Bond’s customized Aston Martin DB5 sports car. When the remains of a crushed Lincoln Continental are lowered into the pickup’s bed, the truck holds steady. In reality, the Lincoln rubble, even without Mr. Solo’s body weight included, would have been five times too heavy for the Ford. ■ Michael Caine was the first person besides\n\ncomposer John Barry to hear the music for the famous Goldfinger theme. How’s that? Barry was already at work on The Ipcress File, which would make Caine a star with his performance as spy Harry Palmer, and Caine was staying with Barry for a time while the composer did mop-up work on the Bond film.\n\nGADGETS AND GIRLS The early books had been all but devoid of gadgetry, and the coolest stuff was in the hands of the bad guys, and that was the case with the first two feature films as well. Goldfinger, and particularly Bond’s car, changed all that. The idea of the Bond Girl underwent a sea change too—and a template was drawn that would prove enduring. There could be several girls per movie of different kinds, including women brought over from the dark side. Both Shirley Eaton’s Jill Masterson (this page, and opposite, bottom, joking after the big scene, and proving she’s\n\n38\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nnot really dead) and Honor Blackman’s Pussy Galore (opposite, top) turned on Goldfinger, thanks to Bond’s charms. As to how to get that name—Pussy—by the censors, publicist Tom Carlile had an idea: Before the film opened he sent Blackman to the London premiere of Move Over, Darling and made sure she was photographed with Prince Philip. He coaxed his pals at the Daily Mail into running a photo with the caption headline “Pussy and the Prince.” No public outcry ensued, and the censors allowed the original Ian Fleming name to stand, paving the way for Plenty O’Toole, Holly Goodhead and all the others.\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES C/RBO/CAMERA PRESS/REDUX\n\nJOHN SPRINGER COLLECTION/CORBIS/GETTY\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK? He visited the set in April 1964 and died in August of that year at age 56. The movie, a global sensation beyond anything he had realized with his books or the first two feature films, was released in the United Kingdom in September and in the U.S. three days before Christmas. Maybe he would have wished he had taken better care of himself, and lived to enjoy the transcendent fame and great fortune. But then, you read the scenes he wrote with horror about aging Florida retirees in Live and Let Die, and you think: maybe not. 39\n\nMIRRORPIX/COURTESY EVERETT\n\nBOX OFFICE\n\n40\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES (3)\n\nBeyond Boffo. Goldfinger was the gamechanger, there is no question about that. Using all of the good things director Terence Young had invented on earlier films—from pizzazz to sly humor—Goldfinger helmsman Guy Hamilton delivered a masterwork, and audiences, primed by a host of magazine articles, were ready for it. (One example: Sports Illustrated sent a reporter along with LIFE photographer Loomis Dean to England to do a piece on the terrifically tense golf match between Goldfinger and Bond, where Connery got pointers from Bernard Lee, above, before the shoot. The best athlete on the course that day was Goldfinger’s caddie, Oddjob, played by Harold Sakata, who had been an Olympic silver medalist weightlifter and was even then a well-known pro wrestler.) Soon after, Goldfinger mania hit Times Square in New York City (opposite), and the numbers started ticking up rapidly: More than 50 million tickets sold in the U.S., for a gross total of more than $50 million. The worldwide take of $125 million converts to over $1 billion today, which places it as the third biggest Bond film ever.\n\nA BOND-WORTHY VILLAIN Emilio Largo was SPECTRE’s No. 2 to Ernst Stavro Blofeld, and in Thunderball he was the main bad guy as he masterminded a daring bombnapping. The climax of the movie is a spectacular undersea battle/ballet between Largo’s forces and our hero’s (Thunderball’s team won the special-effects Oscar). The Sicilian actor Adolfo Celi played Largo, and for a second time in a row the principal villain’s voice was dubbed due to a thick European accent. Two years after Thunderball, Celi made the egregious error of appearing in the Bond spoof Operation Kid Brother, which starred, yes, Sean Connery’s kid brother, Neil.\n\n4 1965\n\nTHUNDERBALL\n\nT\n\nhe 1965 entry in the Bond series had everything to lose: Goldfinger had set an impossibly high bar. So Broccoli and Saltzman proceeded with purpose. Question One: Which book? Thunderball had been their original choice, over Dr. No, to launch the series, but there had been complications. Even before Thunderball had become a novel, elements of it had been kicked around in a collaborative screenplay project involving Ian Fleming, Kevin McClory and Jack Whittingham. McClory started claiming that much of Thunderball, including the inventions of SPECTRE and the fiendish Blofeld, belonged to him, and Broccoli and Saltzman walked away—at the time. Now they wanted Thunderball on the big screen, and made a deal with McClory: He’d be a third producer on the film and in turn would let Eon Productions use SPECTRE and Blofeld now and for a dozen more years. That’s why the evil genius and his criminal enterprise disappear from the “official” series after Diamonds Are Forever. As for Thunderball: With Goldfinger’s lead-in, Connery and director Terence Young back, Blofeld on board and a slew of new toys, it couldn’t miss. It didn’t.\n\nBOX OFFICE Beyond boffo and belief. We’ll get to the conversions, but focus on this for a second: Thunderball sold 74.8 million tickets in the U.S., nearly half again as many as Goldfinger and triple many of the pictures from Roger Moore, Pierce Brosnan and Timothy Dalton. The worldwide gross of $141 million translates to well over $1.1 billion in 2019 dollars, putting Thunderball up into some rarefied air.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ The jetpack was one of the ideas in\n\nthe mid-1960s that everyone was sure represented the future; the Jetsons cartoon show was no doubt responsible. All such ideas were used in Bond films eventually, and in Thunderball, 007 employs the Bell rocket belt (left), supplied by Q, to escape two gunmen after killing SPECTRE agent No. 6, Colonel Jacques Bouvar. A jetpack was also used in 2002’s Die Another Day—it’s definitely a Bond Hall of Fame gadget—but a nearly two decads later, it has yet to make its mark in our daily life. ■ The great Shirley Bassey, having hit the\n\nheights with the Goldfinger theme song, recorded the John Barry–Leslie Bricusse song “Mr. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang” as the Thunderball theme (Dionne Warwick did a second version). But the producers wanted a song with the title in it, and Tom Jones was available to sing the new tune; he held the last note so long he fainted. The singers, both Welsh, have been dubbed by the queen of England Dame Shirley and Sir Tom. ■ Bond cynicism began to set in. From\n\nEVERETT\n\nGAMMA-KEYSTONE/GETTY\n\nthe Time magazine review: “Though From Russia with Love remains the liveliest Bond opera to date, Thunderball is by all odds the most spectacular. Its script hasn’t a morsel of genuine wit, but Bond fans, who are preconditioned to roll in the aisles when their hero merely asks a waiter to bring some beluga caviar and Dom Perignon ’55, will probably never notice. They are switched on by a legend that plays straight to the senses, and its colors are primary.” 43\n\nCOLUMBIA/FAMOUS ARTISTS/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nTHE SPOOF 1967\n\nCASINO ROYALE\n\nT\n\nhere were of course lots of imitations, farces and spoofs made in hopes of cashing in on the Bond craze, especially during the post-Goldfinger mania in the 1960s. (Weirdly, the most successful was the Austin Powers franchise, launched decades later, when most folks this side of Mike Myers thought sending up James Bond was hopelessly passé.) Singular among the knockoffs and satires was the 1967 version of Casino Royale because it was actually based on an Ian Fleming novel (sort of), starred an A-list cast, including the man who might’ve been the “real” Bond if Fleming had had his way (David Niven), and is still watchable today (kind of), even if best appreciated as an artifact. How had this bizarro undertaking come to pass? Well, Casino Royale’s rights had come into the possession of producer Charles K. Feldman, and after he was rebuffed on a partnership overture by Broccoli and Saltzman, and by Sean Connery to star, he turned the project into a spoof. One problem: Many of the stars who had signed on hadn’t been told.\n\nMARY EVANS/COLUMBIA PICTURES/FAMOUS ARTISTS/RONALD GRANT/EVERETT\n\nTOP SECRET ■ Ursula Andress, who has the drop on\n\nNiven on the page opposite and is rolling in the dough here, plays a spy named Vesper Lynd, and at least there was such a spy in Casino Royale. But the book’s Lynd turned out to be a double-agent for the Russians and committed suicide after she fell in love with Bond. The Andress version had no such scruples. ■ Deborah Kerr, no less—she of The King\n\nand I and An Affair to Remember—appears\n\nas a SMERSH agent who pretends to be the widow of M, after M is killed and Sir James Bond is pressed to take his place at MI5 (not MI6, in this movie). The elegant agent of course can’t keep from falling for Bond, which made Kerr, at 46, the oldest actress at the time to play a Bond Girl. ■ Once the wild and crazy production was\n\nunderway, cameos were planned for Frank Sinatra, Sophia Loren and Barbra Streisand that, for one reason or another, didn’t pan out. But George Raft did appear, flipping a coin.\n\n46\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK? Well, he would have been horrified, of course. The plot, such as it was, has five agents take on the name “James Bond” in an effort to mess with SMERSH —five in addition to Niven’s Sir James Bond. This was the first film to depart so egregiously from what had been written. Some future productions would take the titles and ignore the books altogether.\n\nCLASS ACTS\n\nEVERETT (2)\n\nIf the movie was, ummm, stupid—and it surely was—many of its lead actors and other personnel were anything but. One of its five credited directors was John Huston, who back in the early 1960s had wondered about making a Bond movie starring Cary Grant. Woody Allen not only acted as one of the ersatz Bonds, he contributed some (uncredited) writing, as did Huston and Orson Welles, who also costarred. Niven, at left with Angela Scoular and below in the white suit with Joanna Pettet in the foreground, was an Oscar winner. We have mentioned Deborah Kerr, and then there was Peter Sellers and Jacqueline Bisset as Giovanna Goodthighs and William Holden and Burt Bacharach’s music.\n\n47\n\n5 1967\n\nYOU ONLY LIVE TWICE\n\nS\n\no much seemed to be precisely the same—Sean Connery as Bond, Bernard Lee as M, Desmond Llewelyn as Q, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, a high-tech subplot (space capsules highjacked in outer space!), sensational Bond Girls, sinister Asians, John Barry’s music, a cool theme song (Nancy Sinatra on vocals). And there were new treats: the pleasure of Donald Pleasence’s company as Blofeld, the first time that character was allowed to truly strut his vile stuff onscreen, replete with the scary scar and the equally disquieting Persian cat; a screenplay by none other than Roald Dahl (who meantime was adapting Ian Fleming’s Chitty Chitty Bang Bang as a family film); and finally the first 007 film premiere attended by the queen of England. So You Only Live Twice was sent to the theaters with all due fanfare. But there was something the slightest bit wrong. A lassitude, perhaps: a sense of having been there, done that. Or maybe it was finally proving true: James Bond, long suspected of not being quite right for the changing times of the 1960s, wasn’t made for 1967. Much of the old gang would reunite a few years later in Diamonds Are Forever, but here they looked like they needed a vacation.\n\nBOX OFFICE Down but not out. The film sold fewer than half as many tickets at U.S. theaters as did Thunderball, but interestingly that lesser figure—36.2 million—nevertheless makes it one of the most-viewed Bond films ever. Its converted worldwide gross of almost $860 million places it sixth all-time behind Skyfall, Thunderball, Goldfinger, Live and Let Die and Spectre, but still: At the time, it seemed that the bloom might be coming off the rose.\n\nIn this instance, what Fleming might think is a hard question to answer. When he wrote You Only Live Twice, he was already quite ill. It is uneven, not the best, but it includes that fascinating and premature 1962 London Times obituary of Bond, and it is intriguing in other ways. It follows directly on from the murder of James Bond’s wife by the arch criminal Blofeld, which occurs at the end of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service. Producing Twice first as a movie, before establishing the grief and waywardness in Bond that prompts M to send him on a mission to Japan, probably would not have made sense to Fleming. Oddly, he may have found the relative lack of zip in the cinematic proceedings as a good fit for Bond’s personal malaise during You Only Live Twice. At the end of the day, personally, he might well have seen the writing on the wall, as this was the first Bond movie to largely ignore most of what he had written in terms of plot and the evolving nature of his main character. 48\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nEVERETT (2)\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK?\n\nTOP SECRET\n\n■ For some reason, in You Only Live Twice,\n\n■ British actor Charles Gray, seen here\n\nJames Bond did not pilot any kind of vehicle— first time ever.\n\ndead on his feet, is ill-fated Bond ally Dikko Henderson in You Only Live Twice. In Diamonds Are Forever, he will be promoted to the role of awful genius Ernst Stavro Blofeld and will acquit himself ably, even in the considerable wake of Donald Pleasence and Telly Savalas.\n\n■ The soundtrack, probably linked to the\n\nfilm’s subdued performance, didn’t sell well, but has since come to be regarded as a John Barry masterwork. Shirley Bassey covered the theme song many years after the film’s release.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ As if the producers weren’t sure about\n\ntheir new course, and their new Bond, clips from the previous five features in the series were included in the movie’s introductory montage. ■ After several top 40 hits, this theme song\n\nwas an instrumental. And why? Composer John Barry didn’t think “On Her Majesty’s Secret Service” could be shoehorned into a lyric. The non-theme song “We Have All the Time in the World” was performed by the immortal Louis Armstrong. These are also the last words Bond says to his dying wife, Tracy, after she is shot by Blofeld. ■ If Diana Rigg and George Lazenby had\n\nany hope of chemistry, it was dealt a blow when Rigg found Lazenby arrogant on the set. He was “really difficult . . . just difficult offstage,” she told the BBC’s Mark Lawson years later, adding that Lazenby “was the architect of his own demise as a film star.”\n\n6 1969\n\nON HER MAJESTY’S SECRET SERVICE\n\nD\n\necades later, this production still is associated with the talent-search contest staged by Broccoli and Saltzman after Sean Connery retired (for the first time) from the Bond role. Some 400 entrants vied for the part, and the selection of Australian model George Lazenby overshadowed other non-Lazenby aspects of the film. On Her Majesty’s Secret Service was blessed with a great plot, which was sufficiently preserved in its translation from page to screen. The film featured one of the most distinguished actresses ever to accept the appellation Bond Girl in\n\nDiana Rigg (seen and discussed below), and it honored her (in a way) by allowing her to become Mrs. Bond (just before she was murdered). It featured, as well, a second great Blofeld, with Telly Savalas following Donald Pleasence as Bond’s arch nemesis. But also, it had a running time of two hours, 20 minutes, which is indicative of several things: Bond, even if it was still getting many things right, was bloating on jokes and gimmickry; Bond was losing sight of what worked best; Bond was, in its first post-Connery outing, more than a little bit lost.\n\nBOX OFFICE Floppish. Its worldwide gross, adjusted for inflation, was $575 million, a drop from all four previous films except the first official Bond, Dr. No. On the upside, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service outpaced four of Moore’s films.\n\nCLASS ACT\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES\n\nBELA ZOLA/MIRRORPIX/NEWSCOM/ZUMA\n\nGeorge Lazenby’s film career all but dried up when he chose not to re-up for future installments. Diana Rigg, too, made only the one Bond film, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, but her résumé did nothing but expand. Born in 1938 in Yorkshire, England, Rigg was already a big star in her native land when she accepted the role in Secret Service. She had performed many times onstage in the 1960s, starring in everything from Shakespeare on down, and had gained fame as the jumpsuited Mrs. Emma Peel in TV’s The Avengers. That series was picked up in the States, too, but Rigg has said that a principal aim in becoming a Bond Girl was to raise her profile in America. This she did, and then proceeded upon a career dotted with triumphs in the West End and on Broadway, on the big screen and the small (memorably, opposite Laurence Olivier in King Lear, and then in Rebecca, for which she won an Emmy). She was made a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1994, so the Bond series has two Sirs, in Connery and Moore, and two Dames, in Rigg and Judi Dench, who played M opposite Daniel Craig but was killed off in Skyfall. 51\n\n7 1971\n\nDIAMONDS ARE FOREVER\n\nT\n\nhis is one of the more fascinating entries in our Reel History. There’s little question that, less than a decade old, the franchise was at a crisis point. If Broccoli and Saltzman didn’t want to admit it, their distribution partners at United Artists were eager to, and they said, essentially: Pay him. The “him” was of course Sean Connery, who, moving about in the movie world—unsigned—was a solution, a fix-all, an antidote, a stopgap—crassly put, a plug to their leaking ship. He surely couldn’t be counted on to represent “the future,” if ever a decades-long future was then imagined. But the producers needed at least a bridge to that future, and as the 1970s dawned and George Lazenby bid farewell as 007, there seemed only one answer if the series wanted to stay on course. Rather wonderfully, when Connery returned to the role, the production took on the trappings of a happy reunion, and Diamonds Are Forever has a spark that You Only Live Twice was sorely lacking. Sean was older, sure, and softer in physique, but Bond’s audience was, too. Before this whole thing had to be blown up and rebuilt, one more romp.\n\nBOX OFFICE Connery’s last (true) hurrah. He would raise his graying head once more in 1983’s “unofficial” Never Say Never Again, but Diamonds returned the great Scot to comfortable confines, and the audience returned too: It sold over 10 million more tickets in the U.S. than did On Her Majesty’s Secret Service and made a converted worldwide gross of $737 million—a take that would be bettered by three of Roger Moore’s seven films.\n\n52\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nTERRY O’NEILL/ICONIC IMAGES/GETTY\n\nThe Connery Bond movies, as opposed to those starring, say, Timothy Dalton or Daniel Craig, have always had a comic-book aspect. In the more somber Bond films, for instance, the goofy Fleming-inspired character names seem a disconnect. Happy to be back together, that old gang of ours—M, Q, Moneypenny, Goldfinger’s director Guy Hamilton—had a gay old time in Diamonds Are Forever, and their esprit de corps was shared by newcomers called Tiffany Case, Plenty O’Toole and the memorable (and really gay) Mr. Kidd and Mr. Wint. Bernard Lee, Desmond Llewelyn and Lois Maxwell were certainly happy to have former colleague Connery back at MI6, and Jill St. John (opposite, as Case), Lana Wood (Natalie’s kid sister, who played O’Toole) and none other than Jimmy Dean (as a Howard Hughes–type villain named Willard Whyte) chewed all available scenery in their supporting roles. The actors who played Messrs. Kidd and Wint deserve naming, too: Putter Smith and Bruce Glover, forevermore members of the Bond Bad Guys Roll of Dishonor.\n\nDANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nCLASS ACTS\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK? He might’ve been amused by all of the outer space stuff, and he might not have been. Remember: This well-received novel, with Bond focused on the diamond-smuggling pipeline from Sierra Leone to Las Vegas, was published in 1956, well before even Sputnik. This was an earthbound narrative. Interestingly, Diamonds Are Forever’s first adaptation was as a Fleming-sanctioned comic strip that ran in the Daily Express (and in syndication) in 1959 and ’60.\n\nTERRY O’NEILL/ICONIC IMAGES/GETTY\n\nFor a few years, Sean Connery was considered for everything. There was the thought that he would be the perfect Captain von Trapp in The Sound of Music (but imagining a more perfect von Trapp than Christopher Plummer, now, is impossible). Later, in the 1980s, he won his Oscar for The Untouchables, but he always felt he could have won for the wonderful 1975 John Huston film, The Man Who Would Be King. For all of his marvelous performances and versatility, many felt he was the perfect Bond, and Bond was his perfect role—whether he liked the fact or not.\n\nTERRY O’NEILL/ICONIC IMAGES\n\nROLE OF A LIFETIME\n\nWHAT NOW? Connery, napping on the set, hardly sleepwalked his way through Diamonds Are Forever: He earned his hefty fee, a considerable chunk of which went to charity in Scotland (better there than in Cubby Broccoli’s well-stuffed wallet, Connery figured). Yes, he worked for his reward, but now he would leave Bond for a second time. The producers required a solution that might last longer than a single film. Roger Moore, who had been considered earlier, was now free of his TV show The Saint and prepared to ride to the rescue.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ “I was the only Bond Girl who was\n\naccidental,” actress Jane Seymour, who played the stunning Solitaire, told People magazine in 1983, a decade after making Live and Let Die. Seymour, at age 21, had said she was not interested, ready to join a principled club including Raquel Welch, Catherine Deneuve, Faye Dunaway and others who had just said no. But the Bond folks called back, and Seymour realized “I had no money and only one good coat.” She signed, but\n\nBOX OFFICE Moore Better. Live and Let Die’s worldwide gross of $161.8 million in 1973 would translate into $937 million today—an impressive notch above Diamonds Are Forever ($737 million). So everybody was pleased and figured they had found an answer in Moore: a seeming Connery equivalent, as far as ticket-buyers were concerned.\n\nlater lamented: “I’ve spent my life living down that part.” ■ Paul McCartney, who cowrote the theme\n\nsong with his wife, Linda, brought Beatles producer George Martin in to compose the film’s score. ■ To show his Bond was different from\n\nConnery’s, Moore never wore a hat, drank bourbon instead of martinis, smoked cigars instead of cigarettes and used a Magnum handgun, not a Walther.\n\n8 1973\n\nLIVE AND LET DIE\n\nT\n\nEVERETT\n\nhough the producers were prepared to move on from the Connery era, they made him a final, astounding offer of $5.5 million for yet another go. Sean demurred, and later was gallant, calling Moore “an ideal Bond.” In many ways he was: He had personality, charisma, great charm. Bond’s filmmakers, even as they allowed Moore to put his own stamp on the role, tried to cocoon him in ways the audience would find comforting, with Bernard Lee as M, Lois Maxwell as Moneypenny, and Guy Hamilton of Goldfinger and Diamonds Are Forever back at the helm. They began to pump up the thrills—soaring boats and such—and there’s an irony here: Even as they embarked on the gadget-happy Moore era, the character Q went temporarily missing. One story is: The actor Desmond Llewelyn had a prior commitment, and by the time he had freed up enough time for Bond, Q was written out of Live and Let Die. A second account has it that Q was cut because the producers thought too much was being made of all the gadgets. Llewelyn was reportedly sad not to be included, but was later elated when fans demanded him back.\n\nDANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK? Roger Moore’s Bond would have driven the author crazy. His obvious affection for dinner jackets and appreciation of the glamorous locales in which he found himself was of a piece with the written Bond. His constant wise-cracking and bad-joke-making would have left Fleming cringing. The performance was predictable: Many traits and tics, including the debonair insouciance and arched eyebrow, were imported wholesale from Moore’s TV role on The Saint. 57\n\n9 1974\n\nTHE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN\n\nT\n\nhis was, in 1974, Guy Hamilton’s fourth and final James Bond film, and this is both a good and a bad thing. He did make four, and those, added to Terence Young’s three (among the first nine Eon films), got the series off to a rip-roaring start. Also: Based upon the quality of The Man with the Golden Gun, it’s probably good that there wasn’t a fifth Hamilton movie. But it is nevertheless sad that the man who made Goldfinger would depart with a considerably lesser offering. Watching The Man with the Golden Gun today, an inescapable conclusion is that after Live and Let Die launched the Roger Moore era successfully, all concerned felt the prudent thing to do was to paint by numbers: this many bikinis, check; this many outrageous stunts (maybe add one or two), check; this many stupid double entendres, check; drag in a couple of contemporary themes (in this case, the 1970s energy crisis and the martial arts craze), check, check and double-check. Then simply open the ticket booths. Doesn’t always work that way.\n\nBOX OFFICE A wake-up call. The people in line (well, the lines weren’t very long) let the producers know that they couldn’t just plop Bond ingredients into a blender and have a megahit every time out. Ticket sales in the U.S. were barely half of the first Roger Moore film, and the worldwide take was off by a fifth.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ Alice Cooper, of all people, wrote a theme\n\nsong for the film, but the producers opted for a John Barry composition with less than intelligent (and downright dirty) lyrics by Don Black. This was recorded by Lulu. Cooper included his own tune on his 1973 Top 10 album, Muscle of Love. wrote the film’s score in three weeks and it showed: Not even the composer liked it. “It’s the one I hate the most,” Barry later said. “It just never happened for me.” ■ The Moore-era gimmickry—the dastardly\n\nScaramanga has a flying car in this one, to chase Live and Let Die’s flying boat—was being noticed. “Overtricky, uninspired,” wrote Jay Cocks in Time magazine about how the franchise was going wrong. “These exercises show the strain of stretching fantasy well past wit.” 58\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nDANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK (2)\n\n■ Another musical note: Bond-veteran Barry\n\nBOND-WORTHY VILLAINS Much about the movie was forgettable. Certainly Britt Ekland was no all-star Bond Girl, and if her fellow Swedish model Maud Adams made a better impression in a similar role, she would be better still as the title character in 1983’s Octopussy. But Christopher Lee as Francisco Scaramanga, the man with the golden gun (opposite page, and also here, left, dueling with Moore), and Hervé Villechaize as Nick Nack, Scaramanga’s dwarf servant and accomplice (his silhouette here in the foreground), were memorable.\n\nThis was a good thing, for the casting of Lee could have been deemed favoritism, despite his strong pedigree in vampire films: He was Ian Fleming’s cousin and golfing companion. The story goes that Fleming had nominated Lee as Dr. No, and the second part of the story is that maybe he forgot to tell the producers. Anyway, when Jack Palance passed on Scaramanga, Lee got the gig, and everyone was acquitted. Lee went on to immortalize another evildoer filed in the Movies Bad Guy Section under S: Saruman, in The Lord of the Rings trilogy and Hobbit films.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ Roger Moore (below) rather hoped his\n\nSpy Who Loved Me costar would be Brigitte Bardot, but it wound up being another BB: Barbara Bach, a great beauty whose résumé was heavy with spaghetti westerns. She (seen on the opposite page, left) was a real asset to the film, and it boosted her career. On the set of Caveman, she met her costar and future husband, Ringo Starr, and they continue to make sweet music together. ■ The 1977 film is best remembered for two\n\nof its players: Bach, and Richard Kiel, the seven-foot-two-and-a-half-inch actor who portrayed the steel-dentured Jaws (opposite, right) to such effect that he was invited back for the Bond follow-up Moonraker. It\n\nis perhaps interesting that Kiel—so visually useful, particularly as a henchman—had earlier guested on the Bond-influenced U.S. television series The Man from U.N.C.L.E., Honey West and I Spy. ■ The director Lewis Gilbert, who had\n\nmade You Only Live Twice, returned (and he would return again for Moonraker). Freed from having to adapt anything, he and his screenwriters made a crackerjack entertainment from whole cloth involving nuclear submarines, the KGB and other elements. The success of The Spy Who Loved Me surely emboldened Bond’s producers with the idea that they no longer needed Ian Fleming source material. Big-name stars might help.\n\nBOX OFFICE Boffo. Quite a comeback after The Man with the Golden Gun. Suffice it to say: The adjusted worldwide gross of The Spy Who Loved Me, $787 million, would place it seventh all-time among Bond films, after Craig’s Skyfall and Spectre, Moore’s Live and Let Die and Sean Connery’s middle-’60s big three: Goldfinger, Thunderball and You Only Live Twice.\n\n10 1977\n\nTHE SPY WHO LOVED ME\n\nT\n\nhe ultimate rarity: a successful movie based upon (no matter how loosely) a novel so bad that even its author sought to disown it. Ian Fleming in the earliest 1960s got it in his head, perhaps after too many shaken martinis, to write a Bond book from the standpoint of—in fact, in the voice of—a young woman. The novel, 10th in the series, was very short, sexually explicit, barely plotted and a grievous disappointment to the author’s fans. Fleming quickly admitted the error of his ways. He moved to have a paperback version in the U.K. blocked, and occasionally said he wasn’t jesting in the book’s prologue when he wrote that he had found the manuscript and had simply decided to facilitate its publication. When Fleming sold film rights to the bulk of his books to Saltzman and Broccoli, he made sure the action of The Spy Who Loved Me was not included, only the title. This was okay with the producers, and when Eon Productions finally made the movie in 1976, they took only the name and two star henchmen, including one who would become immortal as Jaws.\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK?\n\nBOB PENN/DANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nUA/MPTVIMAGES (2)\n\nIn the final years of his life after writing The Spy Who Loved Me in 1961, Fleming tried to run away from the book. By the time production began on the movie in 1976, Fleming had been dead for nearly 12 years. If he had known that the filmmakers would take his provocative title, model one of his characters into a memorable screen villain named Jaws, and drape those morsels in a larger, successful entertainment, well, Fleming probably would have said: “Whew!”\n\n61\n\n11 1979\n\nMOONRAKER\n\nC\n\nertainly no one was getting fired after the success of The Spy Who Loved Me. Roger Moore was back, director Lewis Gilbert was back, even Jaws was back. It is interesting to note: The events of Moonraker, in the Bond world as created by Ian Fleming in his third novel, took place over five days in the early 1950s. They involved Bond trying to stop Sir Hugo Drax from destroying London with a nuclear weapon. But the events of Moonraker, as the movie laid them out in 1979, took place only yesterday: There were astronauts; there was the midair theft of a space shuttle; there was Moore happily tumbling around in space with Holly Goodhead (Texas-born actress Lois Chiles, who played an interesting evolution of the Bond Girl—an astronaut and CIA agent; as Chiles put it: “Bond’s concession to women’s lib”). Moonraker would prove an almost equivalent hit to The Spy Who Loved Me, and rather surprisingly in the late 1970s, the Bond series, with middle-aged Moore steering the spaceship, was on a middle-aged roll.\n\nBOX OFFICE Cruise control. Who, exactly, James Bond was appealing to in the disco/club-hopping/badhair latter half of the 1970s does not matter. What does: He was catnip to a lot of people. Moonraker sold a fifth again as many tickets in the U.S. as had The Spy Who Loved Me, and it made nearly as much money as that film worldwide. If Goldfinger was a loud grand slam, these two movies were solid back-to-back doubles, equivalent to From Russia with Love, Diamonds Are Forever or Live and Let Die.\n\n■ Who in the world are Leila Shenna and Jean-Pierre Castaldi, besides being the two people\n\nin the left half of this photograph? They are the actors who portrayed evildoers who gave our hero trouble on an airplane. Shenna, a Moroccan actress turned Bond Girl, had one line in the film: “Any higher, Mr. Bond, and I’m afraid my ears will pop.” Castaldi, from France, had earlier been in The French Connection II. They stand in here for the hundreds of Bond actors and extras who simply passed through. ■ Certainly in the casting of the savvy Chiles as Holly Goodhead, there was a reach back to\n\nthe Honor Blackman/Pussy Galore–style Bond Girl. “There is an equal type of thing between Bond and myself,” Chiles told People magazine. “I’m not a sex kitten.” Maybe not, but that name was without doubt the most provocative since Pussy’s, was it not? “I thought it a kind of compliment,” Chiles said jokingly. “I think my parents thought it meant I was smart.” ■ Cubby Broccoli as the sole producer of the film. He had been impressed by George Lucas’s\n\n1977 Star Wars and particularly its box office superpower, so he urged that Moonraker become as spacey as possible. The novelization of the far-out screenplay, James Bond and Moonraker, became a second literary (ahem) best-seller, after Fleming’s original. 62\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nPATRICK MORIN/DANJAQ/EON/UA/KOBAL/REX/SHUTTERSTOCK\n\nTOP SECRET\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK? He probably would applaud. Fleming was always a modernist, forcing Bond to deal with the latest twists in the Cold War or life in the wider world. In his Moonraker, the concerns of British society were the V-2 rocket, a reemergence in England of fascism and particularly a romance with communism, not to mention the so-called “threat from within,” accentuated by the activities of turncoat spies like his former MI colleagues Kim Philby and Anthony Blunt. If moviemakers two generations on could imagine James Bond fighting it out in zero gravity, so might have Fleming himself.\n\nBOX OFFICE Money in the bank. For Your Eyes Only sold 22.4 million tickets in the U.S. and earned nearly $200 million (about $553 million today) in the world market. This was the kind of performance Eon Productions was pleased with. There wasn’t going to be another Thunderball, but if “routine blockbusters” could be churned out, everyone got a raise, and the franchise rolled on.\n\n12 1981\n\nFOR YOUR EYES ONLY\n\nA\n\ns the 1980s dawned, the filmmakers felt it was time for another tweaking—specifically, that the recent films had gotten a bit too out there and needed to come back to earth. “We had gone as far as we could into space,” said director John Glen. “We needed a change of some sort, back to the grass roots of Bond. We wanted to make the new film more of a thriller than a romp, without losing sight of what made Bond famous—its humor.” To that end, the filmmakers cobbled together a script that underwent regular revisions by committee, from various Ian Fleming writings: two Bond short stories (“For Your Eyes Only” and “Risico”), plus unused bits from novels, including Goldfinger and Live and Let Die. There’s a hidden missilecommand system; episodes in Italy, Greece and England; undersea scenes shot in the Bahamas; a soupçon of cold war tension for old times’ sake. Rather amazingly, it all worked okay as a film, and in 1981 the series celebrated another success. One conspicuous absence: The actor Bernard Lee had died, and rather than immediately replace him as M, a surrogate gave Bond his marching orders.\n\nTOP SECRET ■ Who was Richard Maibaum? He was a\n\nscreenwriter and producer (The Big Clock, The Great Gatsby), born in New York City in 1909. Maibaum came to the Dr. No project through his association with Cubby Broccoli in the 1950s, and he went on to script or coscript all but three of the Eon Productions Bond films between 1962 and 1989 (Maibaum died in 1991). Praise him or blame him, the writer had something to do with all those stunts, all those wisecracks, all those seduction lines that never would have worked in real life.\n\n■ Who is Carole Bouquet? She is a French\n\nactress of considerable renown in Europe and, along with Diana Rigg, a Bond Girl of accomplishment to equal her beauty. In 1977 she gained note in Luis Buñuel’s That Obscure Object of Desire, and on the other side of her Bond experience she won the César Award for best actress for Too Beautiful for You (1989). In between, there was the role of Melina Havelock in 1981’s For Your Eyes Only. In these two photographs, she is on the set with her costar Roger Moore. ■ Who is John Glen? He is an English film\n\ndirector who in 1981 had been a veteran film editor and second-unit director on three Bond films. He soon assumed the top job, which he would retain for all five “official” Bond films made in the 1980s—setting the record for most Bond films directed. (Legal entanglements after Licence to Kill in 1989 would force an unprecedented six-year hiatus in the series.)\n\nWHAT WOULD FLEMING THINK?\n\nEVERETT\n\nJOHN BRYSON/SYGMA/GETTY\n\nHe might be amazed. The book For Your Eyes Only wasn’t really an entity in his eyes: A bunch of half-baked TV scripts that were never produced, that were then turned into stories, that were then collected, that were then dispersed to the movies as bits and pieces of plots and cool titles—“From a View to a Kill,” “For Your Eyes Only,” “Quantum of Solace” and so forth. Elements of the story “The Hildebrand Rarity” were used in Licence to Kill, and it can be said that cloned cells from this book contributed as much to latter-day Bond films as those from any other. So: an afterthought by Fleming, with an enduring afterlife. 65\n\n13 1983\n\nOCTOPUSSY\n\nÒY\n\nou don’t expect to see Octopussy walking down the aisle at your local supermarket,” Maud Adams told People magazine back in 1983, adding that she “was quite shocked” when told the title of the next Bond opus, for which she was being recruited. The former model overcame her alarm, signed on the dotted line and thus made history: She would be the first two-time Bond Girl (as opposed to two-timing Bond Girl, of which there had been a few). The provocative title of the movie did in fact originate with Ian Fleming: It had been attached to a short story published posthumously. The source material from the page provided backstory for Adams’s title character in the film: empress of a business conglomerate whose name was inspired by Fleming’s own pet mollusk. In the ensuing action she assists Bond as he foils a communist plot to nuke West Germany. “Not going to win me any acting merits,” admitted Adams, who was 37 when the film was released to much critical smirking. By then, the Bond team was thoroughly inured to smirking.\n\nThe annual slogan on posters in the early years of the franchise was: “James Bond Is Back.” In the early ’80s the phrase whispered with a hiss in the hallways of Eon Productions was: “Sean Connery is back.” Here’s what had happened: Screenwriter, producer and director Kevin McClory had always retained the rights to his Thunderball elements and plotlines even after “coming inside” to make that hugely successful film in 1965. Now he, with Connery starring for an exorbitant fee ($5 million, plus a percentage), was going to use those elements and plotlines for a film that would certainly compete with whatever offering Cubby Broccoli sent to the theaters in ’83. This created many Fleming-quality subplots, chief among them: Would this be a Moore-Connery face-off? Roger Moore’s contract had been up after Moonraker and he had agreed to stay on for For Your Eyes Only. He was disinclined to make a sixth Bond film, and the name Timothy Dalton was floated as a replacement, and James Brolin made three screen tests as Bond. Finally, though, it was decided the movie needed the tried-andtrue if it were to face down the formidable Scotsman. Moore was approached again, and he accepted the challenge. The bout was set. When the bell rang, Octopussy stepped first into the ring, and as if to give royal sanction to the “official” film, the world premiere at the Odeon Leicester Square in London on June 6, 1983, was attended by none other than Prince Charles and Princess Diana (left). If the Crown seemed to have a rooting interest, down the road, it would elevate both Roger and Sean to “Sir.” 66\n\nLIFE BOND. JAMES BOND\n\nLEFT: HENRY MYERS/SHUTTERSTOCK.

Octopussy grossed less than half a billion in adjusted dollars, not as good as For Your Eyes Only, but the film easily outpaced the next installment, Sean Connery’s Never Say Never Again in 1983. The figures seemed to satisfy Cubby Broccoli: Octopussy didn’t delivered a knockout, but it was a clear decision. A win was a win.\n\nTOP SECRET agent Vijay, was a very fine Indian tennis player.

Who was he, beyond a collaborator on a script with Ian Fleming that won him a lifetime of legal rights to play around with Bond, Blofeld and company? He was a handsome Irish World War II veteran (when his ship was torpedoed, he spent two weeks in a lifeboat in the North Atlantic) who, postwar, involved himself in the production side of movies and was once romantically involved with Elizabeth Taylor. Before McClory’s many legal skirmishes with Ian Fleming, he and the writer were close friends. Even after the profitable satisfaction of making Thunderball and then Never Say Never Again, McClory kept trying to spin his slice of Bond, but Warhead 2000 A.D. never came to pass. He died at age 80 in 2006. ■ The great Max Von Sydow, who made\n\n13 films with Ingmar Bergman during his career, portrayed Blofeld here, and certainly the role of this evil genius is the most richly and variously portrayed in BondWorld— besides, perhaps, that of 007 himself. Oddly, in von Sydow’s interpretation, Blofeld kept the white cat, even though this was an affectation created for the earlier Eon films and not by Fleming.\n\nUNOFFICIAL RETURN 1983\n\nNEVER SAY NEVER AGAIN\n\nT\n\nhere was a long-running legal battle between Ian Fleming and his one-time collaborator and former friend Kevin McClory, over the development of the James Bond character, and the upshot was: McClory retained the rights to have his own vision of Bond come to the screen in the future. He exercised that right with Never Say Never Again—a reference to Sean Connery’s emphatic vow after Diamonds Are Forever that he would “never again” play Bond. But money talks, and so the most famous of all 007s returned to battle against Blofeld. Even the toupee was streaked in gray this time out, and Connery, as ever, had good sport with his character’s conceits and foibles. The movie was fine—it was better received, critically, than Octopussy—and Connery’s fans were glad to see him again. But they were also willing to bid him, 52 when he shot the film, a final adieu. As Roger Moore, too, was learning at age 56: The world had little need for an old James Bond.\n\nRICHARD MELLOUL/SYGMA/CORBIS/GETTY\n\nThis of course would not be just about Connery versus Moore, it would be about competing M’s and Q’s, which plot was better and, not least, a battle of the Bond Girls. The Octopussy production tried to proceed carefully, just as it had in entreating Moore to return. Sybil Danning was considered as the title character, as was Barbara Carrera, who actually claimed to have turned down the part to become what would turn out to be the competing Never Say Never Again’s Bond Girl No. 2. Finally Cubby Broccoli decided Maud Adams would return to the Eon series, hair darkened so she wouldn’t look precisely like the other Bond Girl she had recently played. Over in Never land, Sean Connery’s wife, Micheline, became acquainted with the 29-year-old American actress Kim Basinger (opposite) and suggested she might be right as Domino. Connery concurred, and the producers were quickly concurring with just about everything he was concurring with. Basinger, like Adams a former model, went on to portray a second memorable “girl” role as Batman’s Vicki Vale, then to a distinguished career that included a Best Actress Oscar for L.A. Confidential. A footnote: Also in Never Say Never Again, in a small role, was the British comedian Rowan Atkinson, who would later skewer Bond deftly in Johnny English.\n\nEVERETT\n\nTHE SHOWDOWN, PART II\n\nBOX OFFICE Runner-up. As mentioned in our assessment of Octopussy, Never Say Never Again was slightly less profitable. But a few points to note: Both movies made plenty of money; together they made about a billion in adjusted (2020) dollars. And interestingly, while Octopussy earned more worldwide, Never Say Never Again had only a marginally lower take in the U.S., where, perhaps, the idea that Connery was Bond remained stronger.\n\nBOND-WORTHY VILLAINS The singular recording artist and club queen Grace Jones, seen here, made for the best pictures, but, as May Day, girlfriend and henchwoman of the evil Max Zorin, she was only the second most impressive Bond nemesis in A View to a Kill. Zorin was played by Christopher Walken, and his over-the-top\n\nmalevolence was, many thought, the best thing in the film. (Roger Moore didn’t agree, as is explained on the opposite page.) Also on board against Bond (for the first time) was real-world Jones boyfriend Dolph Lundgren as a KGB bodyguard. He had been visiting Jones on the set one day, and director John Glen gave him a job.\n\n14 1985"
