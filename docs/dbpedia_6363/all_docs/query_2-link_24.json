        "text": "He answers some of these questions in his excellent book 'For My Eyes only'.\n\nHe definitely was disappointed with the promotion of the film, and he also states that out of the 5 films he directed its the one he was most proud of, and says it holds up well today, so he hardly would do anything differently! He and Dalton clashed in the beginning when Dalton wanted Bond to be a lot more casual, but Glen insisted Bond was an ex Naval Commander and would be more disciplined! Glen claims they had a final tetchy day of filming, but put it down to fatigue on both their sides!\n\nI think Craig started as being a more modern version of the literary character - at least in his tougher demeanour (downing drinks, taking risks, killing people particularly brutally) but by SP it was more film-Bond.\n\nI would have to disgree there. Early on, the depiction of Bond was a mess, alternating between the cinematic Bond and Jack Bauer/Jason Bourne. On top of that, finishing each film with the now supposedly fully rounded Bond, only to revert back at the start of the next.\n\nAccording to Glen's autobiography @MajorDSmythe, they wanted a fresh direction for the 90's, that included the jettison of Glen and Maibaum.\n\nI can't say that I would have objected to that. As much as I think that Glen was a perfectly fine directir for Dalton's two films, 5 films taking up a whole decade of Bond is enough. Bond #17 would have been a suitable time to bring in some new talent behind the camera.\n\nAs for Maibaum, that would have been a shame (though he died in 1991, so how much involvement in Bond #17 could he have had), he had been with the series since the beginning.\n\nI'll have to read Glenn's autobiography. It makes me happy to know that LTK is his favourite and he's as right to be as proud of it as he is. Highpoint of the series for me. I think in general he doesn't get enough credit. He's too often thought of as a hack or a journeyman imo. He put out consistently solid Bond films every two years for a whole decade, some of which rank among the best of the series (the Dalton films especially). Plus his era was the highpoint for action. The keelhauling, the train fight and plane stunt, the landrover sequence, the cargo net fight, the plane fishing, the plane waterskiing, the tanker chase, etc. And that's just the films he directed. As a second unit director he also oversaw the (iirc) OHMSS ski chase as well as various other action sequences. He's a living legend who contributed a lot to the series.\n\nAnything I should ask Lamont?\n\nI think it'd be cool to ask him about what he thinks of the production design of the last few films, in particular QoS (I'm mainly interested in what he thought of the white high tech MI6). I'd also be interested to know how working on other films compared to Bond and what his favourite of the films he worked on is, Bond or otherwise (I bet that's something I could find through google though so maybe don't use your questions on that). It'd also be interesting to see if he had any stories about James Cameron and what it was like working with him, since he's a great director but also a really interesting man and there have been some entertaining stories about him in the past (nearly drowning Ed Harris is the one that springs to mind).\n\nI think it'd be cool to ask Glenn if there were any ideas he had (action sequences, etc) that couldn't be used, and how working on the Dalton films compared to the Moore era (I remember the EON doc talked about how refreshed and enthusiastic Cubby felt during production of TLD, I'm wondering if it was the same for Glenn)."
