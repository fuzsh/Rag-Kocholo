Having seen Dalton’s darker approach to the character in action, producer Albert R. Broccoli not only wished to retain this feature, but also enhance it. With an inevitable writer’s strike approaching, production was streamlined to ensure that audiences would see James Bond one more time before the end of the decade.\n\nThe majority of the film was originally intended to take place in China. Preliminary lcation scouting began and several sequences were developed, including a chase along the Great Wall of China and a scene in which Bond navigates among the Terracotta Army statues. Producer and screenwriter Michael G. Wilson began developing a plot that revolved around the Golden Triangle and the drug trade. However, further plans were put on hold when it was decided not to film in China.\n\nMoving to Mexico\n\nUltimately, negotiations were made to film in Mexico. Despite this drastic change of events, it allowed the producers to retain the drug trade element of the initial story, albeit in a very different location. Another perk of filming in Mexico was that, due to rising taxes in England, the entire production was able to be moved to Estudios Churubusco. This would mark the first time that Pinewood Studios was not used to film a Bond movie, although Moonraker had faced a similar situation when the majority of its production was moved to France. However, a handful of sequences for that film were still able to be filmed at Pinewood. This time around, Pinewood Studios was only used for sound recording after filming had completed.\n\nBuilding on the drug trade idea and drawing on inspiration from current events such as the Medellin Cartel and the heavy drug trafficking and political corruption in Panama, Michael G. Wilson and longtime Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum developed the story for what was then called Licence Revoked. While the film ultimately would not bear this title, both this working title as well as the final one marked the first time in the official series that a non-Fleming title was used. As the story progressed, the 1988 Writers Guild of America strike commenced and Maibaum was unable to contribute to the finished script. Wilson, who was not originally a screenwriter by trade, continued to work on it alone.\n\nRichard Maibaum’s final Bond film\n\nWhile Ian Fleming’s original material was largely tapped out, there were many literary elements that had yet to be adapted into the film series. Wilson borrowed heavily from Live and Let Die, which featured a shark attack on Felix Leiter as well as extended sequences set in Florida. Additionally, characters and elements were taken from the short story “The Hildebrand Rarity”, which was featured in the For Your Eyes Only anthology. Many fans have noticed that Bond’s infiltration of the villain’s criminal network in the film is similar to the plot of Ian Fleming’s The Man with the Golden Gun, but Wilson has since denied that he consciously adapted anything from that particular book. He has cited the film Yojimbo as a more direct inspiration.\n\nFinally, a script was in place and filming locations were secured. This would pave the way for the least successful, most controversial, and arguably most unconventional Bond film to date…\n\n.\n\nOpening and Title Sequences\n\nTimothy Dalton’s one and only gunbarrel sequence is re-used here, but the intense rendition of The James Bond Theme is incredibly stirring. In fact, it is the most memorable music cue of any gunbarrel to date, making it one of my favorites. The film begins with government officials tracking the whereabouts of infamous drug lord Franz Sanchez, who is making a surprise visit to the Bahamas.\n\nNearby in Florida, James Bond is riding in a limo alongside his longtime friend Felix Leiter and Sharkey, who is obviously another friend of Leiter’s. Their fancy clothing and talk of rings indicate that they are on their way to Felix’s wedding. As we eventually learn, Felix no longer works for the CIA as he had in all previous Bond films in which he appeared. Now working for the DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency), the limo is stopped by his co-workers who inform him that Sanchez is in the Bahamas and they have received permission to capture him. Bond insists on accompanying him on such a dangerous assignment, leaving Sharkey behind.\n\nThey should have let him tag along\n\nUnlike many Bond films, the pre-title sequence introduces most of the key players. With this film, David Hedison became the first actor to portray Felix Leiter more than once, having appeared in Live and Let Die 16 years earlier. It is a very surprising move, but the producers likely wanted a more familiar face since the role would be much more emotional and integral to the plot than it ever had been. And for something like that, there’s no way they were bringing the underwhelming John Terry back from the last film. Hedison adapts well to the role and lends it a sense of desperation and sadness that makes you feel for the character when things take a dark turn later on. This definitely isn’t the approach he took in his first stint as Felix, but it works well.\n\nWe quickly learn why Franz Sanchez is in the Bahamas. He and his men break into a house where Sanchez’s girlfriend is shacked up with some random lover. In an immediate display of the dark brutality featured in the film, Sanchez orders his men to take the guy out back and cut his heart out. As this occurs, Sanchez beats his girlfriend with a stingray tail. This is a trait adapted from the Milton Krest character in “The Hildebrand Rarity”. Although Krest himself later appears in the film, it’s already clear that Sanchez bears a closer resemblance to the literary Krest than the film Krest does.\n\nPortrayed by American actor Robert Davi, Franz Sanchez is my favorite lead villain of the entire series. It’s an unconventional choice, but he does something that no other villain does: He actually terrifies me. Depending on who you ask, the film’s realism and its reliance on real-life events is either a hindrance or a strength. When it comes to the villain, I feel it’s a strength in that you feel like he could realistically destroy James Bond. His methods are ruthless and you begin to feel afraid when he’s around. In order to complement Timothy Dalton’s approach to James Bond, Davi carefully studied the text of Casino Royale with emphasis on the villainous Le Chiffre in order to channel the darker tone of the books.\n\nSanchez’s angry ways\n\nBond and Leiter join the DEA as they close in on Sanchez’s location. However, Sanchez and his men hop in their trucks and make a frantic attempt to reach their private jet. A firefight ensues, but Sanchez manages to take off in his plane. Bond, Leiter, and their team hop in a helicopter and pursue him before he can reach Cuban airspace. As the helicopter flies directly above Sanchez, Bond ties himself to a harness and is lowered down to the plane where he wraps the cargo hook around the tail. This allows the helicopter to carry the plane back to the U.S., where Sanchez is arrested. As they fly over the chapel, Bond and Leiter parachute down just in time for the wedding.\n\nHanging on for the second pre-title sequence in a row\n\nThe pre-title sequence is solid, albeit not as good as Dalton’s previous entry. While many of the pre-title sequences are either superfluous to the plot of the rest of the film, or they only focus on one or two aspects, this one lays the groundwork for everything to follow and is integral to the motives of the characters the rest of the way. Sanchez’s brutal means of dealing with disloyalty already indicate how much grittier and more violent Licence to Kill is than other Bond films.\n\nThe title sequence, which was the final one of the series made by Maurice Binder, is lazy and uninspired. For some reason, the theme of the sequence is a camera. Maybe because of spying? Who knows. It’s bland, forgettable, and accompanied by a just as bland and forgettable title song. “Licence to Kill” was performed by Gladys Knight, who was initially reluctant to sing a song seemingly about killing due to her conservative Christian values. The actual lyrics allude more to love than they do murder, and so she ultimately decided to sing it. It is the longest Bond title song to date, but it’s also the best at putting you to sleep. It’s not a bad song in and of itself, but it’s not a very good title song for a Bond film. The opening notes were the same ones used for “Goldfinger”. The producers were sued by the original writers of that particular song, as royalty payments were required for their use despite the fact that both songs live within the James Bond universe.\n\nThe title sequence\n\nLicence to Kill continued the trend started by The Living Daylights by featuring a different ballad for the end credits. This time, it was “If You Asked Me To”, written by Diane Warren and performed by Patti LaBelle. Its uncharacteristically romantic lyrics and beat fit the tone of the film about as well as the title song, but at least it’s better than the end credits song used for GoldenEye.\n\nPrior to the selection of Gladys Knight’s version, Vic Flick, who had played the guitar for Monty Norman’s original rendition of The James Bond Theme, worked with Eric Clapton to compose and perform the title song. It was turned down in what would be one of many poor musical decisions made by the producers in recent decades. But I’m only assuming it was a poor decision, since the completed song has never been released.\n\nComposer John Barry, who had scored most of the Bond films up to that point, was unavailable as he was recovering from throat surgery. Little did anybody know at that point, but he would never return to the series. The producers selected American composer Michael Kamen to take his place. Famous for composing the music to many action films of the era, including Lethal Weapon and Die Hard, his involvement is one of the aspects criticized by those who feel Licence to Kill is too much of a generic 80’s action flick. I don’t hate the soundtrack by any means, and I feel like Kamen did an excellent job of integrating James Bond riffs into his score. During action sequences, the score is straight up inspirational. But I feel like a classic John Barry score would have helped it feel much more like a traditional Bond film (in a good way).\n\n.\n\nCharacters and Plot\n\nKey West\n\nFollowing the mundane title sequence, Franz Sanchez is being interrogated by DEA agent Ed Killifer, who seems to revel in the fact that he has helped catch such a notorious criminal. A smug Sanchez offers him $2 million to help him escape, which enrages Killifer to the point that he decides to personally escort him to his cell at Quantico.\n\nMeanwhile, Felix and his new bride, Della Churchill, are hosting a wedding reception at their home. An interesting side note: the song played by the band is an updated version of “Jamaican Jump Up”, which was one of the songs performed at Puss Feller’s bar in Dr. No. Della pulls Bond aside and has him fetch Felix from his study. The relationship between Della and Bond is never explained, but it’s a little creepy. She seems to physically be all over him, which is even stranger seeing as how it’s during her wedding to his best friend. Regardless, it’s never expanded upon which means the romantic undertones were more than likely unintentional.\n\nWeird…\n\nBond walks in on Felix consulting with a mysterious woman whom he introduces as Pam. She hurriedly exits as Felix continues to express his excitement over Sanchez’s capture. As they walk outside for the cake cutting ceremony, Ed Killifer approaches Bond and Felix and confirms that Sanchez is going to be transported to prison later that day. As the reception draws to a close, Felix and Della present Bond with a token of affection: a lighter with the inscription: James. Love always. Della and Felix.\n\nLater, Sanchez is placed in the back of a prison van for transport. As the van crosses a bridge, Killifer reveals himself to be a traitor. He knocks the driver unconscious with the butt of his shotgun and drives the van off the bridge into the ocean below. As DEA officials frantically attempt to get divers into the ocean, Sanchez’s men are already in the water. They fit Sanchez and Killifer with scuba tanks and escort them to safety.\n\nWe all saw this coming\n\nThat night, Bond is the last to leave. Della throws him her garter, insisting that he should look into getting married soon. Bond is clearly uncomfortable and hurriedly leaves. In a reference to On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, Felix explains to her that “he was married once, but it was a long time ago.” This foreshadows the events of the film, and the source of Bond’s vengeance and fury, since his own marriage was cut short at the hands of an enemy. As Felix and Della head to the bedroom, they are horrified to discover Sanchez’s men waiting for them inside. It is a shocking scene and while none of the subsequent violence is depicted, it is definitely felt. This is rather alarming due to the typically escapist plots of previous Bond films, and I can see why it was so unsettling to viewers. That being said, I feel it successfully lends itself to the seriousness and darker edge they were going for, although it’s definitely not something I want to see regularly occur in the series.\n\nFelix is forcefully taken to a warehouse where Sanchez’s men imply they have raped and murdered Della. The warehouse belongs to marine researcher Milton Krest, played by American actor Anthony Zerbe. Krest comes across as a bumbling, inarticulate guy who serves as the antithesis to Sanchez’s smooth, collected demeanor. His namesake (and not much else) stems from the lead villain in “The Hildebrand Rarity”, but he is a rather forgettable supporting villain. It is immediately clear that Krest uses his company as a front for Sanchez’s drug smuggling operations. Sanchez calmly sits in his office waiting for his men to return from the Leiters’ house. He orders Krest not to kill Killifer, as he appreciates and openly rewards loyalty – a theme that will continue through the rest of the film.\n\nFelix is relentlessly taunted by Sanchez’s men, led by Dario. Played by a then unknown Benicio del Toro, who was 21 at the time of filming and still holds the rank of youngest Bond henchman, Dario is a sociopathic killer who at times almost steals the show. He ultimately falls short due to lack of screen time or further character development, but he’s still pretty menacing. Sanchez finally emerges with Killifer. Felix is horrified to learn that his friend has so coldly betrayed him, but Killifer insists there was no way he could turn down a $2 million bribe.\n\nSuddenly, a trap door is released below them and Felix is lowered into a pit of hungry sharks. This scenario was adapted from Ian Fleming’s Live and Let Die, although in the book it is merely the aftermath that is depicted rather than the attack itself. Here we experience the entire ordeal. A shot of Felix’s severed leg as he is attacked by the sharks was originally cut from the film to avoid an R rating, but it was later restored in the DVD and Blu Ray releases of the film, although the PG-13 rating remained.\n\nFelix’s honeymoooooooon\n\nThe next morning, Bond is at the airport when he learns about Sanchez’s escape from custody. He frantically returns to the Leiters’ home, where he realizes something is amiss. He breaks in and discovers Della’s corpse lying on the bed. He enters Felix’s study and finds it ransacked. He also discovers Felix’s mangled body on the couch with a note: He Disagreed with Something That Ate Him. He realizes that Felix is still alive and summons an ambulance. At the hospital, he and Sharkey discuss the severity of the situation. Sanchez has stolen all of Felix’s files and has disappeared. Felix has lost an arm and a leg. While the authorities believe Sanchez’s men used a chainsaw, Sharkey recognizes it as a shark attack.\n\nAmerican actor and former NFL player Frank McRae portrayed Sharkey, whose role is clearly a nod to that of Quarrel in Dr. No. Both are black fishermen who use their knowledge of the ocean (and its related subjects) to help Bond in his quest. He’s a solid character and becomes a key ally during Bond’s dealings in Florida.\n\nBond quickly realizes that Felix’s DEA buddies aren’t going to do anything about the attack due to their lack of jurisdiction south of the border. Bond enlists Sharkey’s help in searching for marine institutions that house Great White Sharks. He heads to Krest’s warehouse, where Krest himself turns him away, insisting they sold all their sharks years ago. Bond spots a mini-sub designed for shark hunting, and notices Felix’s boutonniere from the wedding lying on the floor near the trap door.\n\nThat night, Bond enlists Sharkey’s help in breaking into Krest’s warehouse. As he snoops around, he realizes that the drawers containing live worms bred for fish food are actually lined with bricks of cocaine. This is yet another scene adapted from Live and Let Die, where Bond breaks into the Ouroborous Worm and Bait Shop warehouse following Felix’s shark attack and discovers the exotic fish tanks are being used to smuggle gold coins in and out of the country. Bond is caught snooping around Krest’s warehouse, but he manages to gain the upper hand after throwing one of the guards in a worm drawer and knocking the other one into a tank containing an electric eel.\n\nUnleashing vengeance\n\nKillifer manages to surprise Bond by holding him at gunpoint, revealing that he was the one who sold Felix and Della out. Killifer is subdued when Sharkey accidentally enters via a hidden door, knocking him into the shark tank where Felix was attacked. A cold-hearted Bond refuses to save him. Killifer and his briefcase filled with $2 million are eaten.\n\nLater, Bond and Sharkey track Krest via his marine-research ship, The Wavekrest. They plan to head to The Wavekrest’s current location, but Bond is sidetracked when Felix’s DEA buddies turn him in to MI6. He is taken to the Ernest Hemingway house where he is confronted by an irate M. Played for the fourth and final time by Robert Brown, this is a rather unconventional role played by the character, as he is wholly uninvolved with Bond’s pursuit of vengeance (other than trying to stop him). M orders Bond to give up his vendetta and report for his next assignment in Istanbul. Bond flatly refuses and issues his resignation. M informs Bond that his license to kill is revoked. As Bond begins to hand over his weapon, he instead leaps from the balcony and escapes before M’s guards can subdue him.\n\nA farewell to arms\n\nOnboard The Wavekrest, a drunk Milton Krest pesters Sanchez’s girlfriend from the pre-title sequence, Lupe Lamora. Played by American actress Talisa Soto, Lupe is nothing more than a damsel in distress. But seeing the violence surrounding (and trapping) her by living with Sanchez, it helps raise the stakes that much more and therefore I consider her role to be rather vital to the story. Krest is drawn away from Lupe when he is alerted of something swimming near them on the ocean floor. What looks to them like a manta ray is actually James Bond swimming in disguise. Bond sneaks onboard and enters Lupe’s room. Krest’s men catch on to the fact that someone is on the ship, but under threat of Bond, Lupe throws them off the scent. Bond looks outside to see that Krest’s men have caught and killed Sharkey, which further infuriates an already furious Bond. He executes the men who killed Sharkey and dives into the water. Krest frantically sends divers after him, but Bond manages to fight them off. As the sea plane full of $5 million from Sanchez’s latest drug shipment starts taxiing through the water, Bond grabs a harpoon gun from one of his attackers and fires at the plane above. It latches onto the rudder and Bond is towed to safety. He manages to water ski (without skis) behind the plane and catches up to it. He grabs on and hangs tight as it takes off into the air. Bond climbs inside, dispatches the pilots, and flies away with Sanchez’s money. It is an excellent action scene and plays off of director John Glen’s strengths, which has always been the epic stunt sequences.\n\nGlad to see there were some smiles during this vengeful pursuit\n\nBimini\n\nAt the wedding, Bond had observed Felix hide a disk drive in the framed picture of Della in his study, which was missed by Sanchez’s men when they raided his home. Bond later breaks in and discovers that the disk lists a CIA informer whom Felix is scheduled to meet in Bimini. Bond goes to the meeting point located at the Barrelhead Bar, where he realizes that the informer, Pam Bouvier, is the same woman he briefly met in Felix’s office during the wedding reception. Played by American actress Carey Lowell, Pam is portrayed as a no-nonsense, tough as nails CIA agent and former Army pilot. The role is an effective twist and reflects back to the beginning of the decade, when more independent characters were presented as the leading Bond girls of the films. That being said, she sort of devolves as the story progresses and the main focus of the character ultimately becomes the love triangle she is embroiled in with Bond and Lupe. At that point, it’s hard to take the character quite as seriously, but overall she falls about middle of the pack as far as ranking the Bond girls is concerned.\n\nPam and her silver gun\n\nBond sits down with Pam for a drink and orders a Bud with a lime, which should silence the naysayers who complained that Bond drank a Heineken in Skyfall, saying he would never lower himself to drinking a beer. This proves that he already did so at least once before. Pam points out a group of rough looking bar patrons led by Dario, who threateningly approaches them.\n\nDario and his silver knife\n\nIn order to avoid capture, Bond and Pam start a bar fight and begin dispatching Sanchez’s men while the bar dancer continues with her number for some reason. Pam uses the shotgun she had been concealing under the table to blow a hole in the wall. She and Bond jump outside into her boat and take off. Dario manages to get a shot off, but Pam’s Kevlar vest saves her. The two make their way to safer waters, but the boat runs out of gas. Bond enlists Pam’s help in discreetly flying to Isthmus, a fictional Latin American country where Sanchez’s base of operations is located, to bring him down. Bond and Pam then seal their agreement by making love.\n\nLondon\n\nIn a shoehorned cameo, we catch a glimpse of Miss Moneypenny in her office. M catches her looking into Bond’s latest whereabouts, and he explains that he has sent word to their station in Isthmus to keep an eye out for him. After M leaves, Moneypenny places a call to Q branch.\n\nIt really is unfortunate that Caroline Bliss, returning to the role of Moneypenny for the second time, didn’t get a fair chance at playing the character. Her role in The Living Daylights was also small, but her brief scenes in both films indicate the potential she had for playing a truly effective Moneypenny. They should have kept her around for the films of the 90’s.\n\nIsthmus City\n\nJames Bond and Pam Bouvier check into a lavish hotel in Isthmus City (seeing as how Bond is now flaunting the millions he stole from Sanchez). Pam reluctantly poses as Bond’s secretary, Ms. Kennedy. Get it? Bouvier/Kennedy? Anyway, Bond urges Pam to accept some of the cash and leave, but she insists on staying. Bond agrees and heads to the Banco de Isthmus, a bank owned by Sanchez, where he deposits his money. Sanchez is also at the bank, where he is hosting a group of Asian businessmen while his financial advisor, Truman-Lodge, serves as an overly eager tour guide. Played by American actor Anthony Starke, Truman-Lodge is one of the more comical villains employed by Sanchez, but all in all he’s pretty worthless.\n\nUpstairs, Pam enters the room as Bond is making his deposit. Sporting a short haircut (which was Carey Lowell’s actual hair - earlier she had been wearing a wig), she has taken Bond’s advice to heart and plays the secretary role quite convincingly.\n\nThat night, Sanchez sits in his office located above his casino. He and his men watch TV, which shows a charismatic televangelist requesting donations for the Olympatec Meditation Institute. Based on the dialogue carried out by Sanchez and his men, it is clearly a front imposed by Sanchez for his drug smuggling operation. The televangelist, Professor Joe Butcher, delivers messages to Sanchez’s business associates by stating a donation goal. The amount stated is actually the price of Sanchez’s cocaine. When one of the buyers makes an order, Butcher is alerted and claims that a donation is made. The amount of the donation reflects the amount of kilograms that have been ordered. It’s a complicated scheme, but it manages to give us one more supporting villain. Professor Joe Butcher was played by American singer Wayne Newton, who had always wanted to appear in a Bond film. He plays the character with charisma, making him one of the most memorable minor villains in the series.\n\n“Bless your heart!”\n\nWhile they watch the TV program, Sanchez, who carries around a pet iguana, questions Lupe about Milton Krest’s report that someone stole the plane and the money under his watch. Lupe claims that she knows nothing as she was in her cabin the whole time. Meanwhile, Bond is downstairs playing blackjack at the casino. If there was one mistake they made with Dalton’s Bond, it was the slicked back hairstyle he sports with his formal wear in this film. It doesn’t really fit with what one would expect from James Bond, but at the very least it makes him look a bit more devilish, which reflects his fury and anger over the events of the film.\n\nSanchez is alerted of Bond, who is engaging in high stakes gambling in order to purposely attract Sanchez’s attention. Sanchez, who knows nothing of Bond at this point, tells his security team to let him keep playing. Lupe, who recognizes Bond from their run-in on The Wavekrest, intervenes and takes on the role of blackjack dealer. She uses this opportunity to warn Bond that it is too dangerous for him to be here. He refuses to leave and convinces her to take him upstairs to see Sanchez.\n\nBack in Sanchez’s office, Bond makes his famous introduction and Sanchez instantly seems to take a liking to him. Knowing that Sanchez will eventually learn who he really is, Bond plays off the fact that he has just been disavowed from the Secret Service and explains that he is seeking new employment as a trained assassin. Sanchez claims he’ll think about it and Bond is excused. Bond feels slightly discouraged as he noticed that the office is reinforced with bulletproof glass and it will be very difficult to assassinate him from outside.\n\nBond and Pam return to their hotel room where they are informed that Bond’s “uncle” is waiting for them. They climb into the elevator (which is the exact same elevator in Mexico City that would be used 26 years later for the pre-title sequence of SPECTRE) and Bond prepares for an ambush…\n\n…With Pam’s tiny silver gun\n\nHe crashes through the hotel room door with Pam’s pistol in hand, but he realizes that his “uncle” is Q, who has been sent by Moneypenny to assist him. Played as usual by Desmond Llewelyn, Licence to Kill gives Q his largest role up to that point (and the largest one Llewelyn ever got to play). With how abnormal the structure of the film is compared to a more traditional Bond adventure, it’s nice to have Q around for so long. Q issues Bond with plastic explosives disguised as ordinary toothpaste and a camera that can be transformed into a sniper rifle with an optical reader on the handle that can only be activated by Bond’s palm print. This particular feature would eventually be re-used in Skyfall.\n\nHow did Q get those through customs?\n\nSanchez holds a formal meeting with the Asians he has been hosting for the past few days. They are fellow drug dealers who have been invited to discuss a business deal that would allow them to operate in cooperation with Sanchez and monopolize the drug market. Mr. Kwang, one of the visiting drug dealers, seems a bit skeptical of the deal and asks that they be allowed to look further into Sanchez’s operations. Sanchez agrees and they plan to take a field trip to his main distribution center.\n\nUnbeknownst to anybody in the meeting, James Bond is outside Sanchez’s office window applying the dentonite toothpaste. Upon finishing, he orders Pam and Q to leave the country and makes his way to the rooftop across the street where he prepares to detonate the window, which will destroy the bulletproof glass and allow him to shoot Sanchez with his signature gun. Sanchez’s meeting ends and he returns to his office, where he is seen writing a bribery check to the puppet president of the Republic of Isthmus, Hector Lopez. Lopez was portrayed by Pedro Armendáriz Jr., son of Pedro Armendáriz who portrayed Kerim Bey in From Russia with Love just prior to his death. Although the role is minuscule, the casting makes for a nice little tribute.\n\nAs Bond looks through his sniper scope, he sees Pam enter the office next door with Colonel Heller, Sanchez’s chief of security. Bond is shocked at this development, as it implies that Pam may have her own agenda. In a very controversial sequence (due to its sheer randomness and stupidity), Bond is jumped by ninjas after he blows up the window but before he is able to successfully kill Sanchez. Many Bond fans have asked themselves, why ninjas? Regardless of the reasoning, it’s a fairly silly sequence for such a gritty Bond film and ends with Bond being knocked unconscious and captured.\n\nAt least it gave Dalton another sniper scene\n\nBond awakens to find himself tied up inside a dilapidated house. The ninjas turn out to be Kwang and his assistant, Loti. Kwang is an undercover narcotics officer from Hong Kong who is visibly upset at Bond’s interference, as his efforts have finally created the opportunity for him to travel to Sanchez’s distribution center. Kwang has been working in cooperation with Fallon, the local MI6 agent who has been instructed to bring Bond back to London. Bond is drugged, but before Fallon can take him away, the house is attacked by Sanchez, who had suspected Kwang and tracked him down. Fallon and Loti are killed in the raid and Kwang manages to swallow cyanide before Sanchez can get any information out of him. Sanchez and his men discover an unconscious Bond tied to the table and take him with them. Bond wakes up in Sanchez’s bizarre guestroom. The decor is questionable, although I find myself kind of obsessed with the man-fish statue that is prominently displayed near the bed.\n\nIt’s more soothing than a night light\n\nSanchez assumes that Kwang was behind the assassination attempt, and having discovered Bond being held captive, he has decided to trust him. Bond lies by telling Sanchez that Kwang was part of a freelance hit team sent to kill him. They captured Bond fearing he’d warn Sanchez of their presence. Bond continues to prey on Sanchez’s paranoia, insisting that there must be an inside man in his cartel. He plants the seed that Milton Krest may be the traitor. Sanchez invites Bond to stay at his home while he goes to meet Krest at the harbor.\n\nAfter Sanchez leaves, Bond looks for a way to escape. Lupe helps him by allowing him to cling to the side of her speedboat as she takes off for the mainland to go shopping. Bond returns to his hotel room where he reprimands Q for not having left yet. He then confronts Pam at gunpoint and demands to know what she was doing with Colonel Heller. Pam reveals that Sanchez has bought four stinger missiles from the Contras and plans to shoot down an American airliner if the DEA doesn’t back off of their efforts to capture him. Pam was meeting with Felix during his wedding because Felix was giving her a letter granting Colonel Heller immunity if he would help recover the missiles on behalf of the DEA. Heller was initially going to go through with it, but Bond’s assassination attempt scared him and he reneged on his deal with Pam.\n\nBond realizes that his personal vendetta has gotten in the way of something much bigger. He decides to let Pam and Q continue to help him and has them meet him at the harbor that night. He then goes to the bank where he withdraws all his money.\n\nThat night, Pam pretends to be the harbor pilot and takes control of The Wavekrest as it prepares to dock. She purposely crashes the boat into the dock in order to create a distraction and stir even more paranoia in Sanchez, who waits with Lupe and his men to confront Krest. During the brief chaos, Bond sneaks aboard The Wavekrest where he and Pam hide Sanchez’s money inside Krest’s decompression chamber. Meanwhile, a flustered Krest attempts to explain to Sanchez how the money was stolen. Sanchez’s men discover the load of cash inside the decompression chamber and alert Sanchez, who now believes that Krest has betrayed him. He also believes that Krest hired Kwang to assassinate him. He furiously throws Krest into the decompression chamber and turns it up to its maximum setting before breaking it, causing the pressure to quickly drop. Consequently, Krest’s head explodes.\n\nOuch\n\nBond resorts back to his old ways and (again) tells Pam and Q to leave Isthmus. He returns to Sanchez’s estate and pretends he has been there the whole time. Sanchez gives him a sizeable payment as a sign of gratitude for tipping him off about Krest. Bond continues to build on his paranoia by hinting at the fact that there may be more than one guy in Sanchez’s operation who is trying to double cross him. Sanchez invites Bond to join them for the tour of the distribution center. After he leaves, Lupe sneaks in and expresses her developing feelings for him and again tries to warn him not to interfere with Sanchez. They make love and Lupe heads to Bond’s hotel room afterwards where she tries to tell Pam and Q to convince Bond to stay away from Sanchez. They thought Bond had already left the country, having left his vendetta behind in order to allow the authorities to deal with Sanchez, but she reveals that Bond was with her, which incites jealousy in Pam. The best part is when Lupe leaves and Q tries to excuse Bond’s seduction methods by telling Pam that “field operatives often use every means at their disposal to achieve their objectives.” Hahahaha! Later, Pam is able to secure a crop duster in order to aid Bond while he is at Sanchez’s distribution center.\n\nEvery means at their disposal…\n\nThe distribution center is revealed to be housed at the Olympatec Meditation Institute, which is built to look like an elaborate ancient temple. Filming took place at the Otomi Ceremonial Center in Temoaya, Mexico. Bond and the Asian drug dealers are led through the facility where they are asked to don masks to avoid inhaling the dust from all the cocaine grinding. Sanchez reveals that his scientists have developed a method of dissolving the cocaine in gasoline, which is then smuggled across the border in tanker trucks. After making it to its destination, the cocaine can then be filtered out and restored to its original powder state.\n\nAlso joining them on their tour is Dario, whom Sanchez welcomes with open arms. Dario does not immediately recognize Bond due to the mask he’s wearing, but he is immediately suspicious.\n\nMeanwhile, Pam has arrived with a load of the cash that Bond had given her earlier, pretending to be a dedicated follower of Olympatec. She wishes to give the donation to Professor Joe Butcher personally. Butcher meets with her, obviously hoping to seduce her in his “private meditation chamber”. Pam uses this opportunity to pull a gun on him, forcing him to hand over his keys to the institute and allowing her to get inside and pose as an Olympatec temple patron.\n\nAt the presentation, Sanchez reveals that four tanker trucks are outside waiting to deliver the first shipment of cocaine hidden inside the gasoline. However, the presentation does not make it much further after Dario gets a better look at Bond’s face and recognizes from the bar in Bimini. He loudly exclaims that Bond is an informer. Before Sanchez can execute him for his ruse, Bond manages to throw a flaming beaker and ignite the drug lab. He is finally caught and Sanchez puts him on the conveyor belt feeding into the giant cocaine grinder. Bond delays falling into the grinder by pointing out to Sanchez that Heller is driving away with the stinger missiles. This once again feeds on Sanchez’s paranoia and he goes after Heller as the institute continues to be engulfed in flames around them.\n\nA gruesome escape\n\nDario is left to ensure that Bond dies. As Bond clings to the edge of the conveyor belt, Pam appears and shoots Dario in the shoulder, causing him to fall over the railing into the cocaine grinder. Pam then shuts the machine off, allowing Bond to escape unharmed. As he and Pam look for an exit, they discover Colonel Heller impaled on a forklift, indicating that Sanchez killed him for his disloyalty.\n\nBond and Pam hop in a golf cart and drive away from the crumbling institute. They manage to grab their bag of cash from a fleeing Joe Butcher, inciting him to exclaim, “Bless your heart!” Well, at least there were no hard feelings after he was held at gunpoint. Sanchez and his men escape the temple with the four tanker trucks and head to Paso del Diablo, where Bond chases after them in order to exact his revenge…\n\nGood thing Pam has her crop duster to help\n\n.\n\nProduction Values\n\nAs indicated by the recap above, Licence to Kill is a serious, violent, and gritty Bond film. But to me, that doesn’t make it stand out as much as the production itself does. What I mean is that the move from Pinewood Studios and other familiar filming locations definitely shows in the final product, although Bond’s presence in Florida and the Caribbean is very Fleming-esque.\n\nAs much as the film is an anomaly, it hearkens back to the spirit of the Ian Fleming novels in a way that hadn’t been seen since On Her Majesty’s Secret Service and wouldn’t be seen again until Casino Royale. While the main plot itself is not derived from the original novels, there are as many elements adapted from the books as there are in some of the more faithful adaptations. Further elevating the more serious and literary feeling of the film is Timothy Dalton’s performance, which is once again spot on. His decision to play the character straight was, as many fans continue to put it, way ahead of its time. It is interesting that the elements of his performance that continue to draw criticism are the very same ones that Daniel Craig is now praised for.\n\nOh no! James Bond looks like he’s actually in danger! Let’s criticize this movie!\n\nApart from the violence, the unconventional nature of the film also seems to be what turns some viewers off. The set design feels very unique for a Bond film. The plot is also out of the ordinary. Up to that point, James Bond rarely went rogue and if he did, it was only for a small portion of the film. That being said, Licence to Kill started a trend that has re-emerged in the series in recent years. Bond has gone rogue (and occasionally lost his license to kill) for some or all of each of the last five Bond films, beginning with Die Another Day in 2002. At this point it has become cliche and one yearns for a traditional mission. However, this concept was still fresh when Licence to Kill came out, making it the best rogue adventure Bond has (and ever will) embark on.\n\nLicence to Kill does restore some of the more conventional elements that had been missing from Timothy Dalton’s first entry, including a conventional (and truly diabolical) lead villain. The villain’s background and motives have often come under fire, seeing as how many feel that depicting drug cartels in action films had become generic due to shows such as Miami Vice and Scarface. However, I love the late 80’s feel that it gives the film and have no problem with its plot points and action sequences. It still fully feels like a Bond film to me. It is also indicative that the series was starting to shift away from Cold War-centric plots. This was essential for its survival, as acknowledged six years later in GoldenEye. People just don’t give credit for what Licence to Kill was trying to do, which is a shame because it was innovative on so many levels.\n\nSpeaking of action-laden sequences, the final tanker chase is truly thrilling. Sanchez and Truman-Lodge attempt to escape with their remaining men. Bond and Pam hop in her crop duster and pursue them. Bond manages to jump from the plane onto one of the tankers and take control by subduing the driver. This sequence is filled with incredible actiona and imagery, which is further fueled by Timothy Dalton’s insistence on performing many of his own stunts. It is interesting to note that of all the James Bonds, only he and Daniel Craig have insisted on doing as many of the stunts as they were allowed to do.\n\nImpressive\n\nRumor has it that Rumarosa Pass, the stretch of Mexicali highway used to film the tanker chase, has been haunted ever since a group of nuns were killed when their bus was traveling around the pass’ sharp corners and fell off a cliff. Numerous strange occurrences took place while filming, including a prop stinger missile that malfunctioned and shot over two miles before hitting a utility worker. Additionally, one of the trucks inexplicably burst into flames during the night and another one started its engine and drove a few feet on its own. The most famous occurrence, however, was a photograph taken while filming the destruction of one of the tankers. The photo depicts a flaming hand emerging from the explosion.\n\nSpooky…\n\nSanchez and Truman-Lodge pull over as Bond drives by one of the other tankers and destroys it by ramming it into the cliff. Sanchez’s men fire one of the stinger missiles at Bond, but he uses a dirt pile to ride up on two wheels (or however many wheels there are on one side of a tanker). The missile passes under the truck and hits the one behind it that Bond had just caused to crash. Bond continues to dispatch the tankers and Sanchez’s men. Truman-Lodge berates Sanchez for screwing up, but Sanchez calmly shoots him and climbs in the one remaining tanker in order to escape with it. Bond catches up and climbs from his truck to the back of the tanker as Sanchez shoots at him with an uzi. Side note: the clanging of the bullets on the side of the tanker sound out the melody of The James Bond Theme.\n\nThe ensuing struggle causes the final tanker to crash. A beat up, bloodied Bond emerges from the wreckage and comes face to face with a gasoline-drenched Sanchez, who holds a machete to his face. Before Sanchez is able to kill him, Bond asks him, “Don’t you want to know why?” before pulling out the lighter that was given to him by Felix and Della. As Sanchez reads its inscription, Bond uses it to ignite Sanchez, who backs into the wrecked tanker and perishes in the ensuing explosion. The tanker chase sequence as a whole is exhilarating, making it one of the best finales in the entire series.\n\nLater, the entire city of Isthmus celebrates their liberation from Sanchez at a party held at his former estate. Lupe has adopted the pet iguana, and Bond calls Felix, who seems to be in unusually good spirits seeing as how his wife was just murdered and he’s missing some limbs. Felix tells him that he heard from M and it sounds like Bond will be getting his job back.\n\nAfter the phone call, Pam spots Lupe being romantic with Bond and runs to the pool to cry. Despite Lupe’s desire to continue a relationship with him, Bond realizes that his feelings currently lie with Pam and he rejects her, insisting she and President Lopez should start dating. He jumps in the pool and Pam joins him. As they kiss, one of the fish statues winks at the camera.\n\nA serious ending to a serious film\n\n.\n\nRelease and Aftermath\n\nDuring production, everyone thought the film was going to be called Licence Revoked. Initial promotional material, including posters, were designed with this title in mind, but it was changed at the last minute due to poor audience reaction in the United States, where many potential moviegoers thought it referred to someone losing their driver’s license. An additional obstacle encountered during post-production was the film’s rating. Due to the increased level of violence, certain cuts had to be made. Still, it was the first Bond film to be rated PG-13 in the U.S. (all subsequent Bond films have received this same rating). It was also rated 15 in the United Kingdom, which was a significant departure from the typical PG rating the Bond films had typically received up to that point.\n\nThere’s way too much blood on that note for a Bond film\n\nLicence to Kill premiered on June 13, 1989 in London and received a worldwide release shortly after. Despite being a box office success, its numbers were far lower than what had come to be expected from a Bond film. Adjusting for inflation, it is the lowest grossing Bond film of all time, with the U.S. box office specifically proving to be a major disappointment. Many factors have been attributed to this drop in numbers, including: (1) The last minute title change led to less promotional material being released in advance of the film, (2) The decision to use the British spelling of “Licence” as opposed to “License” may have contributed to audience confusion in the U.S., and (3) Competition for the 1989 summer box office, which also saw the release of Lethal Weapon 2, Batman, and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, all of which targeted similar audiences. Due to the overcrowded market, this would be the final Bond film released in the summer. All subsequent entries until Bond 25 would be released just before or during the winter holiday season.\n\nAs stated earlier, critical reviews for Licence to Kill are generally negative or lukewarm at best, although it did have its supporters. Director John Glen considers it to be the best Bond film out of the five he directed. James Bond continuation author Raymond Benson has also expressed support for the film. Many feel that it was ahead of its time, as it depicted Bond in a much darker vein, emphasizing revenge as well as his humanity and the personal toll his profession takes on him. These elements would be emphasized and lauded almost 20 years later during the Daniel Craig era, and Timothy Dalton’s Bond has consequently been re-discovered in many circles.\n\nLicence to Kill has received a number of adaptations over the years. It became the fourth Bond film (after Dr. No, For Your Eyes Only, and Octopussy) to receive a comic book adaptation. It was also the third Bond film (after The Spy Who Loved Me and Moonraker) to be novelized, this time by Bond continuation author John Gardner, who had been writing original James Bond novels since 1981. In order to merge the continuity of the novelization with that of Ian Fleming’s original stories, as well as his own, Gardner presents the rather implausible notion that this is the second time Felix Leiter has been fed to sharks.\n\nIt’s a good book, though\n\nA video game adaptation was released in 1989 to coincide with the release of the film. It was followed by the 1993 Sega Genesis game James Bond 007: The Duel which, while it had nothing to do with Licence to Kill, featured Timothy Dalton’s likeness from the film’s teaser poster on the cover art. The final act of Licence to Kill, including the destruction of the Olympatec Mediation Institute and the tanker chase, would later be adapted for the third level in the poorly received 2012 video game 007 Legends, with Timothy Dalton’s likeness being replaced by that of Daniel Craig. Carey Lowell returned to provide her voice and likeness for the game.\n\nFollowing Timothy Dalton’s short stint as James Bond, which he later said was “a fantastic experience”, he returned to lesser known film and stage roles, notably playing Rhett Butler (originally portrayed by Clark Gable) in Scarlett, the 1994 made for TV sequel to Gone with the Wind. He has since appeared in more well-known projects including Looney Tunes: Back in Action, Hot Fuzz, Toy Story 3 and 4, and a leading part in the 2014-2016 TV series Penny Dreadful. When producer Kevin McClory began threatening another remake of Thunderball in the late 90’s, tentatively titled Warhead 2000, he claimed that Dalton was set to reprise the role of James Bond. As far as I know, Dalton himself has never commented on the matter.\n\nHanging out with Roger Moore\n\nRobert Brown, who had appeared in a total of five Bond films (playing M in four of them), retired from acting after Licence to Kill. He died of cancer in 2003 at the age of 82. Caroline Bliss made a small number of appearances, mostly in made for TV movies, up until 1996. Carey Lowell only made a handful of film and television appearances following her role as a Bond girl, and is most famous for her 14 year marriage to actor Richard Gere. Robert Davi continued to make minor appearances in a variety of wide-releases, cult films, TV shows, direct-to-video flops, and everything in between, including Predator 2, Showgirls, and The Expendables 3. He has also lent his voice talents to multiple video game franchises, including Grand Theft Auto and Halo. Talisa Soto’s more famous role came in the mid-90’s when she portrayed Kitana in both Mortal Kombat films. Her most recent film appearance was a brief uncredited role in the 2013 science fiction film Elysium.\n\nDavid Hedison went on to appear in a handful of minor roles before retiring in the mid-2000’s. He has continued to be involved in James Bond-related events and has expressed fond memories of the time spent on his two Bond films, although he has indicated a preference for Live and Let Die over Licence to Kill. Benicio del Toro’s career skyrocketed to A-list status following his appearance in the 1995 cult classic The Usual Suspects. He has appeared in numerous high profile films including Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, Snatch, Sin City, The Wolfman, Guardians of the Galaxy, Sicario, and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. He won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the 2000 crime film Traffic.\n\nLicence to Kill marked the end of an era for a number of longtime James Bond crew members, many of whom had been with the series since the beginning. John Glen bowed out after directing all five official Bond films of the 80’s. He had been with the series in some capacity since On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, and followed his Bond films with a handful of critical and commercial flops, including the notoriously bad Christopher Columbus: The Discovery, which reunited him with Robert Davi and Benicio del Toro. His final film was the 2001 thriller The Point Men. Screenwriter Richard Maibaum, who had written or co-written almost every Bond film since Dr. No, died in 1991 at the age of 81. His contribution to the Bond film series is legendary, and he is without a doubt history’s most influential James Bond writer behind Ian Fleming himself. Title designer Maurice Binder, who had been involved in all but two Bond films up to that point, also died in 1991 from lung cancer at the age of 72. Despite my mixed feelings about his work over the years, Binder’s motifs, most notably the gunbarrel sequence which he created, are legendary and continue to live on in the Bond film series.\n\nAlthough he would be alive for the release of GoldenEye, this was the final film in which original producer Albert R. Broccoli played an active role. He fell ill during production of Licence to Kill and handed the reins over to his daughter, Barbara, and stepson Michael G. Wilson. This would foreshadow their role as co-producers for all subsequent Bond films.\n\nUnbeknownst to anyone at the time, there would not be another Bond film for over six years following Licence to Kill. Many people attribute either the poor box office returns or the audience’s failure to accept Timothy Dalton as reasons for this hiatus. However, a third Dalton Bond film, titled The Property of a Lady, was set for a 1991 release. The truth of the matter is that legal problems got in the way after a dispute arose between MGM and United Artists regarding the distribution rights to the Bond films. By the time the smoke cleared and the ensuing lawsuit was settled, The Property of a Lady was long dead, Dalton’s contract had expired, and a new James Bond was cast.\n\nBarry’s cameo at the end of the film\n\nIt truly is a shame that this occurred. It pains me every time I watch Licence to Kill knowing that Timothy Dalton’s era could have continued for at least one or two more films. His first two films were so diverse, showcasing a range of possibilities they could have explored with Dalton’s Bond. It is the most painful “what if” for me to think about in regards to the Bond films. Licence to Kill is a great movie, regardless of what people think. I love the harder edge and the 80’s-ness of it. While those elements aren’t sustainable film-by-film, I view it merely as a chapter in the life and career of James Bond - one that takes a slightly different turn than most. Had there been a third Dalton film, I’m confident that his license to kill would have been renewed and we would have continued with the character arc in a much more traditional Bond story. I don’t think the super dark elements of Licence to Kill indicated the direction the films would have taken, despite what many people claim. As Robert Davi pointed out during his interview for the 2012 documentary Everything or Nothing: The Untold Story of 007, it took Sean Connery three films to become fully established and accepted as James Bond, and Timothy Dalton never really got that chance. I would argue that the same three film rule has applied for Roger Moore and Daniel Craig, and that had Dalton been given his third (and maybe fourth) Bond, he would be just as accepted today as the others are. Honestly, if we had an ageless Timothy Dalton, I would be fine with him being Bond for the rest of forever. But alas, it wasn’t meant to be and instead we can at least thank our lucky stars that we got two excellent Bond films from him.\n\nAn era cut short\n\n.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nOverall Rating: 9 out of 10\n\nI know this rating is controversial, but Timothy Dalton’s performance alone carries it into the upper echelon of Bond films.\n\nCopyright © 2018 by Peter Nordgren\n\n.\n\nJames Bond will return in GoldenEye\n\n.\n\nPosters and Fan Art\n\nVHS cover\n\n.\n\nDVD cover\n\n.\n\nDVD cover 2\n\n.\n\nBlu Ray cover\n\n.\n\nAlternate Blu Ray cover\n\n.\n\nConcept Art\n\n.\n\nConcept Poster\n\n.\n\nConcept Poster\n\n.\n\nConcept Poster\n\n.\n\nEarly Draft Poster\n\n.\n\nConcept Posters\n\n.\n\nTeaser poster\n\n.\n\nAlternate poster\n\n.\n\nAlternate poster\n\n.\n\nGerman poster\n\n.\n\nJapanese poster\n\n.\n\nJeff Marshall poster\n\n.\n\nFan poster\n\n.\n\nFan poster\n\n.\n\nMinimalist fan poster\n\nPlease email me at pdnordgren@gmail.com if you would like to be considered to contribute to or submit a guest article to spywhothrills.com"
