Broccoli and Harry Saltzman had begun efforts to adapt Ian Fleming’s final novel, The Man with the Golden Gun, into the next entry in the franchise and had approached Roger Moore for the role of James Bond. The original novel primarily took place in Jamaica, and was rumored to have been unfinished due to Fleming’s death. Clearly, there was never any intention to stay true to the original story, which has always been considered inferior to Fleming’s previous works. The film adaptation was to be shot in Cambodia. However, political turmoil in the form of the 1967 Samlaut Uprising caused the idea to be shelved and On Her Majesty’s Secret Service was adapted instead. Obviously, discussions with Roger Moore also ended, as it was George Lazenby who was cast in the lead role.\n\nFast forward about seven years, when Roger Moore really was playing James Bond and the success of Live and Let Die proved that continuing in the direction they had established was a no-brainer. The idea of making The Man with the Golden Gun was revisited, and this time they really pulled it off. In light of the fact that Jamaica had been a major filming location for the previous film, the decision was again made to move the action to a part of the world previously untouched by the Bond films. Initially, locations in the middle east, including Beirut (where a small part of the finished film supposedly takes place) and Iran. However, political turmoil, this time in the form of the Yom Kippur War, once again forced the production team to reconsider. Locations were scouted in Asia, and Thailand was chosen as the primary locale by production designer Peter Murton after seeing pictures of Phuket in a magazine.\n\nSouthern Thailand\n\nAlthough the Bond films had continued to be co-produced by Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, their relationship had been deteriorating for quite some time. It had gotten to the point where they would take turns taking the lead on each Bond film, and with Saltzman having primarily been in charge of producing Live and Let Die, it was Broccoli’s turn to take the reigns. This did not stop the former from having some influence on production, and he insisted that the film contain a sequence involving an elephant stampede. He even went as far as ordering over 2,000 pairs of elephant shoes meant to help them walk on hard surfaces. Months later, the order was delivered to Broccoli while filming on location, despite the fact that the elephant idea had been axed before production had even started.\n\nReturning for his third consecutive Bond film, screenwriter Tom Mankiewicz created the initial draft of the script. However, his relationship with EON Productions, including director Guy Hamilton (also returning for a third consecutive time), had become strained and veteran Bond screenwriter Richard Maibaum was brought back into the fold following a one film absence. Maibaum based his script on the initial ideas of Mankiewicz, and the finished product continued the trend of 1970’s Bond films by almost completely discarding the plot of Ian Fleming’s original novel. Apart from the characters of Francisco Scaramanga and Mary Goodnight, the film has nothing to do with the novel on which it is supposedly based. Having been inspired by the blaxploitation genre while making Live and Let Die, The Man with the Golden Gun instead borrowed elements from martial arts films, which had been made popular by the Bruce Lee films of the early 1970’s.\n\nDirector Guy Hamilton on location with Roger Moore\n\nFeaturing Roger Moore in his second appearance as James Bond, along with the return of a number of series regulars, The Man with the Golden Gun was set to capitalize on the continuing success of the franchise. Unfortunately, challenges during production led to what many consider to be one of the worst films in the entire series.\n\n.\n\nOpening and Title Sequences\n\nIt must be bluntly stated that the pre-title sequence of The Man with the Golden Gun is quite bizarre. Following the same gunbarrel sequence used for Live and Let Die, we are immediately transported to a private beach. This scene (along with the final act of the movie) was filmed on the beautiful Ko Khao Phing Kan, located in southern Thailand near Phuket. A man and a woman are relaxing on the beach. It is revealed that the shirtless man (who we later find out is lead villain Francisco Scaramanga) has a superfluous third nipple, which is later said to be a sign of invulnerability and great sexual prowess. Unfortunately, the drop in production values is clear from the get-go, as it’s very clear that his chest hair was only partially (and hastily) shaved in order to apply this unique “prop”.\n\nThe role of Francisco Scaramanga was originally meant for American actor Jack Palance, but he declined the offer. Scaramanga was then transformed from the glamorized thug of the novel to a refined, sophisticated, high-class assassin, meant to reflect a darker counterpart to James Bond. Legendary English actor Christopher Lee, famous for his role as Count Dracula in numerous Hammer Horror films, portrayed the high rolling Scaramanga. In addition to his prominence as a leading movie villain, he was also Ian Fleming’s step-cousin. 12 years earlier, Fleming had offered him the title role of Dr. No, which he gladly accepted. However, Joseph Wiseman had already been chosen by EON Productions and Lee was never formally cast.\n\nA day at the beach isn’t complete without a track suit and zebra chairs\n\nThe Bond franchise wouldn’t have been complete without the participation of Christopher Lee, and although the film itself isn’t up to par with his massive talent, Lee is one of the best villains of the entire series. His more deadpan approach to the role is not hindered in any way by all the goofiness going on around him, and he is threatening enough that I find him as much a danger to Bond as any other villain who has crossed him.\n\nRodney, a mysterious assassin in a black suit and fedora, shows up on the island, only to be led inside a lavish home built into the island’s rock formations by Nick Nack, Scaramanga’s midget butler. Meant to be a unique spin on/homage to Oddjob, Nick Nack is one of the quirkiest, most memorable henchmen in the series. Played by French actor Hervé Villechaize, Nick Nack is primarily meant for comic relief, although he is depicted as being extremely intelligent and conniving. In recent years, Roger Moore has commented on Villechaize’s unquenchable sexual appetite during filming, claiming that he slept with up to 35 women before production wrapped.\n\nWho would’ve thought?\n\nYelling from afar, Scaramanga orders Nick Nick to bring him a bottle of Tabasco (possibly my favorite moment of the film). Nick Nack leaves Rodney waiting in the parlor with an envelope of money. It is clear that there was some sort of secret pact made between Nick Nack and Rodney that brought him here. Scaramanga heads to the parlor, where Rodney is waiting with a gun. Meanwhile, Nick Nack hurriedly makes his way to a control room, where cameras, controls, and a microphone allow him to manipulate the lighting of the home’s interior. Nick Nack seems to be putting the two assassins through a set of challenges to see which one kills the other.\n\nRodney makes his way into a bizarre fun house filled with optical illusions and lifelike mannequins. This was based on Guy Hamilton’s original idea of having Bond go to Disneyland while on assignment. The first mannequin intended to disorient Rodney is a pistol wielding cowboy that looks an awful lot like Roger Moore with a mustache. It was in fact portrayed by Moore’s stunt double, Les Crawford. Never is it more clear that the realistic wax mannequins were mostly played by actual people than when a group of mobsters led by Al Capone shoot at Rodney. Their constant flinching at the gunfire is a dead giveaway.\n\nRodney as he shoots at statues\n\nOne interesting side note is that actor Marc Lawrence, who played Rodney, had previously played a gangster in Diamonds Are Forever. In that film, he displayed similar mannerisms and sported virtually the same attire, leading many fans (including myself) to infer that he played the same character in both films. This would establish a nice, subtle bit of continuity that die-hard fans appreciate, although it’s just as likely that he was never meant to be the same character, seeing as how actors have often been recycled throughout the series.\n\nScaramanga manages to retrieve his unique looking golden gun and shoot Rodney in the head. The funhouse lights turn on, and Nick Nack congratulates Scaramanga before retrieving the money he gave to Rodney. Based on their conversation, it seems that Nick Nack regularly hires assassins to try to kill Scaramanga in order to inherit his island and his fortune, and in return Scaramanga is able to practice his skills in a live environment. Additionally, the funhouse lights reveal a seemingly random statue of James Bond. Once again, it is easy to discern between wax statue and the real actor, as the use of each alternates between certain takes. Clearly it was difficult for the real Roger Moore to hold completely still while trying to maintain the statue’s pose. Luckily, he turns back into wax for the shots of Scaramanga shooting his fingers off. So for the second film in a row, James Bond is absent from the pre-title sequence, although those who count him as having appeared in it have a valid argument, seeing as how Moore had to stand in for the mannequin.\n\nThat’s NOT a mannequin\n\nThe opening credits are, quite frankly, lousy. The Roger Moore era credits had their share of creativity and uniqueness, but overall title designer Maurice Binder seemed to have been running out of ideas and The Man with the Golden Gun is the first film to indicate this. A bunch of girls laying around rubbing the golden gun (I wonder what THAT signifies), along with a randomly placed dancing silhouette, just don’t cut it. I’m also surprised as to just how close they get to showing explicit nudity, a boundary that is pushed throughout the opening credits of the 70’s and 80’s.\n\nThe title sequence\n\nAfter a one film absence, composer John Barry returned for his 8th Bond film. The title song, written by Barry along with veteran Bond title song lyricist Don Black, is an atrocious mess. Sung by obscure Scottish singer Lulu, “The Man with the Golden Gun” sounds silly in all the wrong places. The tune is all over the place and the lyrics themselves are chock-full of ridiculous, juvenile innuendo. It is often considered one of the worst Bond songs of all time, an opinion I am inclined to agree with.\n\nAmerican singer Alice Cooper had written and performed his own version of “The Man with the Golden Gun”, but it was rejected. Cooper released the song in his 1973 album Muscle of Love. The song itself is just as bad as Lulu’s version, though not as catchy, nor does it emanate the James Bond musical style.\n\nJohn Barry considered the film’s soundtrack to be the worst of all his Bond scores, and many critics agree. While I don’t think it’s awful, it is admittedly extremely repetitive and seemingly uninspired. It fits the campiness of the film, as well as the Far East feel of the locations, but it definitely doesn’t rank up there with the greatness of his earlier music.\n\n.\n\nCharacters and Plot\n\nLondon\n\nFor the first time, Roger Moore’s James Bond visits M’s office to receive his customary briefing. Whereas the Connery and Lazenby eras normally depicted Bond being briefed alone (with a few exceptions), Moore’s briefings are usually a group effort, and this film is no exception. In this one, we have Colthorpe (who?) and Bill Tanner, M’s chief of staff and a recurring character in the original novels, who makes his first film appearance here. Tanner was portrayed by an uncredited Michael Goodliffe in what amounts to be his most worthless appearance. It is never explained why he’s there, or what his stake is in the film’s plot.\n\nA rather surly M, again played by a visibly aging Bernard Lee, cuts to the chase, allowing Bond to once again showcase his endless array of knowledge on all subjects. In this case, it’s Scaramanga’s background, having been born in a circus to his ringmaster father and snake charmer mother. Growing up to be a trick-shot artist and KGB assassin, he eventually went rogue and now works independently for $1 million a hit. Nobody knows what he looks like, as there are no known photographs of him. The dialogue in this scene, along with one near the end of the film, gives way to the utterance of the actual title of the film. This is the first time the film’s title has been spoken in the film itself (discounting Live and Let Die, in which it was sung) since You Only Live Twice.\n\nRoger Moore’s first office briefing\n\nScaramanga is on everyone’s mind due to a mailing containing a single golden bullet with “007” emblazoned on it. Fingerprints on the accompanying note indicate it was sent from Scaramanga himself, implying that James Bond is next on his hit list. Bond is forced to put his current assignment regarding the current energy crisis and a missing scientist named Gibson on hold until the issue is resolved. He is ordered to go on leave, although M strongly hints that he should use his time off to find and kill Scaramanga.\n\nBond consults Miss Moneypenny, who has been placed back in the usual outer office flirtatious banter scenario that had been absent from the two previous films. They discuss Bill Fairbanks (agent 009), who was allegedly killed by Scaramanga in Beirut five years earlier. The scene contains all the classic ingredients of the typical Bond/Moneypenny exchange, although at this point it’s getting a little tiresome. Lois Maxwell wasn’t getting any younger, and neither was Roger Moore. In that sense, they feel more like lifelong friends rather than a dapper agent warding off the advances of a hopeless romantic.\n\nBeirut\n\nJames Bond heads to Beirut to uncover the truth behind Fairbanks’ death, hoping it sheds light on Scaramanga’s whereabouts. He visits a belly dancer named Saida, who was the last person to see Fairbanks alive. He wastes no time making his advances in her dressing room, leading to a very awkward sequence in which Bond must retrieve the bullet, which she wears in her navel while dancing.\n\nFor some reason that is either unexplained (or I may have missed in my numerous viewings of the film), a group of thugs break in and attack Bond. They hit him on the back, forcing him to swallow the bullet, which he had hidden in his mouth. The ensuing brawl causes much of Saida’s furniture to be broken or displaced, and at one point a mirror is turned to reveal the film’s camera crew in the reflection.\n\nMaybe they’re supposed to be there…\n\nBond gains the upper hand, immobilizing the thugs and rushing to the nearest pharmacy, presumably to extract the bullet from his stomach.\n\nLondon\n\nBond returns to London, where he visits Q branch to have the bullet analyzed. Luckily, this means that Desmond Llewelyn returns as Q after a one film absence that led to an outcry from fans. It’s kind of ironic, seeing as how he was removed from Live and Let Die, a film chock full of gadgetry, in order to take the focus away from gimmicks and technology, yet he made his return in The Man with the Golden Gun, a film in which Bond’s gadgets are kept to a bare minimum.\n\nThe analysis of the bullet, performed by that random Colthorpe guy we saw during M’s briefing, reveals that it was fired by a highly unusual 4.2 millimeter gun. Its unique design leads Bond to a Portuguese gunsmith named Lazar. If there is anything else to be said about Colthorpe, it is that his name was originally Boothroyd, until those collaborating on the script remembered that this was Q’s real name, as stated in Ian Fleming’s Doctor No and the initial films in which the character appeared.\n\nMacau\n\nLazar runs a shop out of his home in Macau. Bond arrives, interrupting his family during dinner, although they don’t really seem to care. In another case of James Bond being world famous, Lazar knows exactly who he is and discusses the honor of making a custom weapon for him. Bond persuades him to admit to making golden bullets for Scaramanga. He then forces him into revealing the method by which Lazar delivers them by holding him hostage with a rifle that has been custom made for a man with three fingers. Due to the fact that the butt is not balanced for someone with five fingers, aiming it as one normally would causes the bullet to fire one inch too low. Bond exploits this little nuance by actually firing at Lazar’s groin. Naturally, it misses its mark but it is enough to scare him into providing more information.\n\nWhat about a gun made for someone who wears safari suits?\n\nHidden in a cigarette carton, the bullets are taken to a casino, where Lazar delivers them to the woman seen on Scaramanga’s beach in the pre-title sequence. Bond watches this unfold and follows her to Hong Kong.\n\nHong Kong\n\nUpon arriving in Hong Kong, Bond spots the woman getting in a green Rolls Royce. Before he is able to tail her, the MI6 field agent he summoned in advance of his arrival shows up. Said field agent turns out to be Mary Goodnight. It is clear that she and Bond know each other, but she is not his personal secretary as she was in multiple novels, and the film states she has been in her current posting for the past two years. However, their familiarity with each other may be implying that she once worked closer to him. Mary Goodnight was portrayed by Swedish actress Britt Ekland, the former wife of Peter Sellers. At that point, she was known for appearing in the British crime film Get Carter and the horror film The Wicker Man. Surprisingly, she was pregnant at the time of filming The Man with the Golden Gun.\n\nMary Goodnight is often considered one of the worst Bond girls in series history, and Ekland’s performance is widely panned. That being said, I don’t have a problem with the actress or the character. She is meant to be a bit of an airhead, but it’s not like that’s a series abnormality. For the most part, she actually seems quite observant and competent, and even resists Bond’s advances, even if it’s just for a couple minutes.\n\nMiss Goodnight\n\nThanks to Goodnight’s knowledge of Hong Kong, they track the car to the Peninsula hotel, which owns a fleet of green Rolls Royces. Bond bluffs his way into the girl’s hotel room, where he finds her showering. We eventually learn that her name is Andrea Anders, and she is exactly what she has been made out to be: Scaramanga’s mistress. Portrayed by actress Swedish actress Maud Adams, I actually like her character more than Mary Goodnight (although as I stated before, I’m not a Goodnight hater like many other Bond fans). Adams approaches the role in a very straightforward manner, making the character extremely tragic. It doesn’t really fit with Moore’s nonchalant, borderline rude behavior toward the women in this film, but the performance in and of itself is actually quite good. Britt Ekland had originally auditioned for the role of Andrea, and was crushed upon hearing that Maud Adams had been cast, thinking that there wouldn’t be room for two Swedish actresses in the same film. However, she was ecstatic upon learning that she had instead been cast as Mary Goodnight.\n\nIn what many consider to be a painfully cringeworthy scene, Bond slaps Andrea around for information. Meant to be a continuation of the character as established by Sean Connery, the general conclusion is that Moore’s approach didn’t cater toward hitting women, as he was generally much more charming and genial, and much less physical. I agree that it isn’t Moore’s best moment, but I really never thought about how awkward the scene is until I learned more about what other people thought about it.\n\nLooks like they parted on slightly better terms\n\nAndrea reveals that Scaramanga will be at the Bottoms Up club that night, and Bond will recognize him because he is “tall, slim, and dark”. Bond’s reply that this description also fits his aunt is the closest the film series has been to referring to Bond’s Aunt Charmian, who, according to Ian Fleming’s You Only Live Twice, raised him after his parents’ death.\n\nThat night, Bond waits for Scaramanga outside the Bottoms Up club. Nick Nack approaches, although Bond has no idea who he is. Meanwhile, Scaramanga perches in a building across the street, seemingly aiming his gun at Bond. Instead, he shoots and kills a nearby pedestrian. Nick Nack approaches the body during all the commotion before being shooed away by the police officer accompanying the man who was shot. The officer then arrests Bond, who had drawn his gun out of instinct.\n\n“Crouched on a rooftop somewhere”\n\nThings are a bit fishy, and Bond suspects that the police officer isn’t who he says he is. After boarding a boat to Kowloon, Bond escapes his captors and jumps onto the partially sunken RMS Queen Elizabeth in Hong Kong harbor. He discovers it is a hidden base of operations for MI6, and M and Q are both working out of it while on location. The police officer reveals himself to be Lieutenant Hip, an undercover MI6 agent tasked with meeting the man who was shot by Scaramanga. Korean actor Soon-Tek Oh portrayed Lieutenant Hip, who initially comes across as a much more serious character than he is by the end of the film. However, his transition into silliness also makes him somewhat charming and likeable. He serves more or less as an Asian Felix Leiter, and is involved in some rather odd sequences, as we will discuss later on.\n\nThe man shot by Scaramanga turns out to have been Gibson, the missing scientist whom Bond had been tracking on his previous mission. Lieutenant Hip had been negotiating immunity with Gibson in return for a solex agitator, which serves as the MacGuffin of the film. It is a small, mysterious solar device that could help end the energy crisis. Gibson had been working with Hai Fat, a Chinese industrialist located in Bangkok, prior to his discussion with Lieutenant Hip. Unfortunately, the solex agitator went missing at some point between their initial rendezvous at the Bottoms Up club and his subsequent death (we as an audience can only assume that Nick Nack took it).\n\nBangkok\n\nJames Bond suspects Hai Fat of paying Scaramanga to assassinate Gibson, and he and Lieutenant Hip arrive at his estate in Bangkok to investigate. Bond hops the fence, only to find a lone Asian girl named Chew Mee swimming naked in the pool. He removes his shirt to join her as Hai Fat arrives. Bond goes off the fact that few people know what Scaramanga actually looks like by pretending to be him, as indicated by the phony third nipple he’s wearing. When you think about it, this is the only actual gadget Bond uses in the entire film.\n\nAn apologetic Hai Fat seems to be fooled by Bond’s trickery, and a conversation ensues. Played by Chinese actor Richard Loo, Hai Fat was originally meant to have a sidekick named Lo Fat, but the idea was discarded prior to filming and in the end he is completely forgettable. “Scaramanga” warns Hai Fat of James Bond, which makes no sense seeing as how, with his vast wealth and resources, Hai Fat could just make some inquiries, learn what Bond looks like, and realize that this imposter is actually him.\n\nIt would’ve been cooler if Lo Fat were in it\n\nHai Fat strongly hints that he was the one who backed the hit on Gibson, and invites Bond to return for dinner that night. An overly confident Bond leaves the estate, and we realize that the real Scaramanga has been there all along. Hai Fat, who obviously knows who the real Scaramanga is, clearly has an ulterior motive in having Bond return.\n\nLieutenant Hip gives Bond a ride back to Hai Fat’s that night. For some unexplained reason, he is giving his two young nieces (who seemingly go to school in Bangkok) a ride as well. One speaks exclusively in Thai, and the other speaks Chinese, yet they endlessly chatter back and forth and can understand each other. This is just another one of those little touches that makes the film that much more bizarre.\n\nBond again enters Hai Fat’s estate, and the statues that may or may not actually be statues theme comes up again. A small midget statue, which is CLEARLY just a statue, magically transforms into a disguised Nick Nack in between takes. Bond continues down the path before running into two sumo wrestlers, who had also been pretending to be statues. By throwing a couple elbows and squeezing one of their butts (one of the most cringeworthy moments in the entire franchise), Bond gets the upper hand. However, Nick Nack knocks him out from behind and Hai Fat orders him to be taken to “school”.\n\nSee! It’s just a statue in this shot\n\nBond awakens to find himself in full karate attire, watching fighters battle to the death along with a whole school of martial arts students. Bond is quickly ordered to participate in the next fight. Without questioning why he’s even here, he gets up and totally cheats by kicking his opponent in the face when they are supposed to bow to each other. It’s a pretty dirty move, and I bet any version of James Bond other than Roger Moore’s would have been more willing to go through with the actual fight.\n\nYou’ve gotta admit it’s as clever as it is dirty\n\nChula, the school’s physically imposing champion, is summoned to fight Bond next. Instead of sticking around, Bond jumps through a window after realizing he is no match for him. Lieutenant Hip and his nieces arrive just in time, having determined Bond’s location due to the fact that Hai Fat owns the school. If there was any credibility remaining in this film (which at this point is quite doubtful), it’s completely thrown away in favor of a slapstick fight scene in which Hip’s nieces completely destroy the school’s students. This is followed by an unexplained, completely nonsensical occurrence in which Hip and his nieces get back in the car and drive away, leaving Bond in the dust and at the mercy of Chula and the remaining students.\n\nBond manages to hop in a long-tail boat on the nearby canal. The students get in another boat and begin to pursue. A small Thai boy trying to sell a wooden elephant spots him and manages to climb in his boat after the motor has seemingly died. Initially asking for 20 baht in exchange for the elephant, Bond offers him 20,000 if he can get the boat started again. A mere flick of a switch gets him going again, but instead of making good on his offer, Bond pushes the kid into the canal. Roger Moore has since expressed distaste over this particular moment, especially since he became a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador 15 years later. After all that, the biggest treat of the boat chase and, let’s be honest, the entire film, is that it features the return of Sheriff J.W. Pepper!!!\n\nThe boat chase\n\nDirector Guy Hamilton enjoyed Clifton James’ performance in Live and Let Die, and made sure the character was brought back for an encore appearance. There were obviously others in the industry who enjoyed him as well, as he went on to appear in Superman II as another southern police sheriff. Vacationing in Thailand, Sheriff Pepper’s wife Maybelle accompanies him, and trust me, if you don’t like Sheriff Pepper then you won’t like her either.\n\nThe rest of the chase is rather unexciting, as the narrative is just as concerned with Sheriff Pepper’s return as it is with Bond’s escape. Additionally, Sheriff Pepper’s racism is just as prevalent (if not more), which is no more apparent than it is when he refers to Thai people as “pointy heads”.\n\nA visibly flustered Hai Fat consults with Scaramanga back at his estate. Upset over Bond’s escape, he decides to lay low for awhile. Scaramanga slowly assembles the pieces of his golden gun together. Hai Fat does not notice until it is too late, and is shot by Scaramanga, who takes over his criminal empire. This sequence showcases the best gadget of the film, the golden gun itself. Scaramanga’s ability to discreetly carry it with him everywhere he goes is due to the fact that the barrel is disguised as a fountain pen, the main body as a lighter, the handle as a cigarette case, and the trigger as a cuff link. The expensive golden bullet is hidden in his belt buckle.\n\nI wonder what color ink the pen uses…\n\nBond returns to his hotel to have dinner with Mary Goodnight over a bottle of “Phuyuck”. But wait, why did Goodnight accompany them to Bangkok? If she is stationed in Hong Kong, then shouldn’t her part of the mission be over at this point? Nonetheless, the chain of events that follow are quite possibly the most sexist ever seen in a Bond film. Initially, Goodnight flat out rejects Bond’s advances, but this is short lived as he returns to his hotel room to find her waiting for him. It’s an already cringeworthy moment, amplified by the disruption of someone entering the room. In walks Andrea Anders, and Bond hides Goodnight under the sheets, pretending she’s just a bunch of pillows. Tired of Scaramanga’s reign of terror and abuse, Andrea reveals that it was she who sent the golden bullet to MI6 in an attempt to coerce Bond into going after him. She figured he would be the only one capable of killing him, seeing as how Scaramanga reveres him to the point of keeping a mannequin of him in his funhouse.\n\nIn the end, she not only has to promise to deliver the missing solex agitator to Bond in return for saving her, but must prostitute herself as well. Admittedly, it is initially her idea, but Bond comes across as a total jerk for letting her do it. He also manages to get Goodnight out of the bed without Andrea noticing and hides her in the coat closet, where she is forced to hear everything that goes on between Bond and Andrea. I’m not one to get offended by dated depictions of sex and gender, but one still has to wonder what in the heck they were thinking by including this particular scene.\n\nBy far the most suspenseful part of the film\n\nAndrea hastily returns to Scaramanga’s boat to retrieve the solex agitator, and to avoid arousing suspicion, but it is clear that Scaramanga knows something is going on. Meanwhile, Bond frees Goodnight from the confines of the coat closet, promising that her turn will come.\n\nBond makes contact with Andrea at a Muay Thai match the next day. After sitting next to her, he quickly realizes she is dead, having been shot in her seat by Scaramanga, who sits on Bond’s other side. Revealing his identity to Bond, the two have a discussion while Nick Nack points a gun at him from behind. Scaramanga expounds on his circus background, telling the story of a misunderstood elephant who was his only friend. The two attempted to escape before the elephant was killed by his handler. Scaramanga returned the favor and discovered a love of killing people. It is actually a very effective monologue, delivered well by Christopher Lee. It lends the character some sympathy, which is normally lacking in a Bond villain.\n\nBond uses this distraction to grab the solex agitator, which had been sitting unnoticed on the floor. Lieutenant Hip, disguised as a peanut vendor, walks by and takes the solex from Bond. He then gives it to Mary Goodnight, who is waiting outside. Hip leaves to pursue Nick Nack, having recognized him from the Bottoms Up Club. Goodnight is the one who actually sees Nick Nack leaving, however, and she follows him.\n\nLike Tiffany Case had done two films prior, Mary Goodnight completes her descent into worthlessness when she finds herself captured by the bad guy. While scoping out Scaramanga and Nick Nack’s AMC Matador, they push her into the trunk and lock her in before driving away. Unfortunately, she still has the solex, which means it is back in Scaramanga’s hands. Thanks to her walkie talkie and a homing device built into her dress, Bond chases after them. In need of a car, he stops by the local AMC dealership (they obviously made a deal to provide every major vehicle in the film). Sheriff Pepper is inexplicably car shopping on his vacation, and happens to be sitting in the passenger seat of the Hornet that Bond chooses to drive off in.\n\nBond and the deputized JW pursue Scaramanga\n\nThe car chase is actually quite enjoyable, and is possibly the best action sequence of the film. Whether it’s because the film is over 40 years old, or the streets were cleared for filming, the streets of Bangkok don’t seem quite as crowded as they should be. Also, you can tell which cars were imported specifically for this scene, as they have the steering wheel on the left, whereas all the other cars (and all cars in Thailand) have the steering wheel on the right.\n\nThe wildly vocal Sheriff Pepper, who is exhilarated to be part of another one of James Bond’s missions, provides some genuinely funny lines as they try to catch up with Scaramanga, although it doesn’t quite make up for the fact that there is no reason he should be in this movie. Thanks to a wrong turn, they are forced to launch from a destroyed bridge over a small klong (canal) in order to get to the other side. The stunt is actually extremely impressive, as the car makes a full 360 degree spiral before landing on the other side. The jump, which was the first film stunt to have been outlined and simulated using computers, is completely ruined in the final film, as composer John Barry added a slide whistle sound effect while the car is in the air. He later expressed regret over this decision, and there is a unanimous agreement among Bond fans that the sound effect ruins what is otherwise one of the best stunts in the series.\n\nIt’s really cool if you press the mute button\n\nBond and Sheriff Pepper arrive at Scaramanga’s warehouse, but they are too late, as the Matador is installed with attachable wings, allowing it to fly away. Scaramanga, Nick Nack, and a captive Mary Goodnight leave their pursuers (and Sheriff Pepper’s tenure in the Bond series) in the dust.\n\nHong Kong\n\nOnboard the RMS Queen Elizabeth, Mary Goodnight’s homing signal is discovered coming from an island in Chinese waters. Bond insists on unofficially infiltrating the island to rescue her.\n\nChinese Territory\n\nBond makes his way to Scaramanga’s island via seaplane, where Nick Nack and an uncharacteristically delighted Scaramanga greet him on the beach. Bond is given a VIP tour of the island, which he learns is powered by a solar plant manned by a lone employee named Kra. Using the technology from the solex agitator, Scaramanga has developed a dangerous power source which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. By channeling the solar rays using a panel built into the mushroom shaped island near the beach, he powers a fancy laser gun, using it to destroy the seaplane Bond arrived in.\n\nI hope he bought rental insurance for that plane\n\nBond and Scaramanga join Nick Nack and a captive, bikini clad Mary Goodnight for lunch. One would think that steamed mushrooms isn’t a sufficient meal, but it’s clearly meant as a segue to Goodnight’s cryptic comment to Bond regarding the previously mentioned mushroom shaped island with the solar panel.\n\nClearly annoyed at Scaramanga’s insistence that they are two peas in a pod, Bond begins defending his life as a government assassin while simultaneously condemning that of a gun for hire. It is a surprisingly intelligent exchange of words and wits between hero and villain, and the dialogue stands out in comparison to the rest of the film. It rivals the banter Bond has exchanged over the years with the likes of Dr. No, Red Grant, and Blofeld. Before the discussion gets too heated, they agree to a pistol duel on the beach to end things once and for all…\n\n…Thus providing this iconic still\n\n.\n\nProduction Values\n\nIf you haven’t figured it out already, The Man with the Golden Gun is over-the-top silly. Whether this was due to the abrupt departure of Tom Mankiewicz, the weak source material, or the dissolution of Cubby Broccoli and Harry Saltzman’s partnership is anybody’s guess. Along with a few other entries, this film plunges as far as the Bond series has ever gone into camp and comedy. The premise had the potential to be something really great and foreboding, and the basic plot outline surpasses that of Live and Let Die, although admittedly the energy crisis angle gets a little convoluted at times.\n\nAt least this makes sense…\n\nThat being said, there are some redeeming qualities, including the acting by Roger Moore, Christopher Lee, Maud Adams, and even Britt Ekland, all of whom seem very comfortable and give the film enough panache to keep it afloat. I would even argue that Roger Moore plays things a bit less silly than he did in his first Bond film. However, he still leans a lot more toward the comedic side of the character, as he did in all his Bond films.\n\nThe Man with the Golden Gun featured some of the best locations in the entire series, from Hong Kong, which has otherwise rarely been fleshed out in the film series, to Thailand. The prominent use of Thai locations, including Bangkok and the southern islands, have a personal effect on me, as I was a missionary in Thailand for two years, learning the language and loving the country and its culture. The cinematography itself is a bit inconsistent. The outdoor shots, including the aerial shots of southern Thailand, are excellent and showcase the flair of the Far East quite well, but the scenes filmed at Pinewood Studios, where one country is made up to look like another, leave a lot to be desired.\n\nMade on roughly the same budget as Live and Let Die, this seems like a far cheaper film in almost every category, which may have been due to the decision to film in such far away places. The production design seems promising at times, such as Scaramanga’s power plant, but it falls flat by plunging into the bizarre, such as the fun house and the statue laden garden of Hai Fat. Also, there seemed to have been obsession with the color brown. I’m not sure if it was a mid-70’s thing, but at times everything in this movie seems to be brown, from the suits to the furniture.\n\nSo much brown!\n\nAs previously mentioned, the martial arts genre had an impact on the overall tone of the film. However, while elements of blaxploitation ran throughout the entire DNA of Live and Let Die, the influence other genres had on The Man with the Golden Gun was significantly less prominent, and seems to have disappeared by the time we get to the final act of the film, where Bond and Scaramanga have a showdown that is meant to reflect both the similarities and differences between the two.\n\nBond figures it’s a standard face off, but Scaramanga has different plans. He vanishes from the beach, and Bond is led by Nick Nack to the fun house, where he is forced to go through the same ordeal as Rodney. Bond manages to climb behind the set pieces, but loses his gun in the process. In a move we all saw coming, especially in light of the film’s obsession with humans pretending to be statues, Bond manages to pose as the mannequin of himself, fooling Scaramanga, who fails to notice before it is too late. Bond shoots him, thus obtaining his only kill of the entire film.\n\nAt least it was the one that mattered most\n\nMeanwhile, Mary Goodnight clocks Kra over the head with a wrench, sending him into one of the vats of liquid helium, which causes the solar plant to begin self-destructing. Bond manages to find her, and the two hurriedly retrieve the solex agitator from Scaramanga’s solar-powered weapon, despite Goodnight accidentally activating its deadly beam by pressing her butt against the On switch. They set sail in Scaramanga’s boat as the island explodes and decide to use his bed to fulfill the promise Bond made to Goodnight when letting her out of the coat closet.\n\nUnfortunately for them, Nick Nack has sneaked onboard, emerging from the ceiling in order to pounce on them with a knife. Curiously, he holds the knife the wrong way in his mouth.\n\nNick Nack proves to be nothing more than a nuisance, merely making a mess of the bedroom by throwing champagne bottles everywhere before Bond traps him in a suitcase. Bond and Goodnight, obviously unafraid of all the broken glass shards that could still be in the bed, continue where they left off. For some reason, MI6 knows Scaramanga’s phone number despite not having known what he looked like, allowing M to call. James Bond gives one of the series’ two horrendous “coming” jokes before hanging up on him. We then see that Nick Nack is hanging captive inside a bamboo cage that has been hoisted to the top of the mast. Honestly, I don’t think he looks too healthy and highly doubt he will survive the journey.\n\nI’d consider that worse than throwing him overboard\n\n.\n\nRelease and Aftermath\n\nThe Man with the Golden Gun was one of a handful of Bond films to break the typical two year release cycle established during the first few decades of the series. Its premiere was held on December 19, 1974, and was the first Bond film to be screened at the Kremlin. After Scaramanga is shot by Bond, a Russian official in the audience allegedly commented, “We didn’t train him very well.” This is in reference to the fact that Scaramanga was supposedly trained by the KGB.\n\nIn relation to previous series entries, The Man with the Golden Gun significantly underperformed at the box office, especially when compared to the massive intake of the previous film. It was the lowest grossing Bond film since On Her Majesty’s Secret Service and, when adjusting for inflation, it was the second lowest grossing film up to that point (ahead of Dr. No). The Man with the Golden Gun ended up being the least profitable film of the Roger Moore era, but if we once again adjust the numbers for inflation, it would ultimately fare better than a few of his later films.\n\nAt least the promo shots kept the safari jacket\n\nReviews for the film, both then and now, were largely negative. Christopher Lee’s performance as Scaramanga is often seen as the high point of the film, but opinions on the other elements vary greatly. The lack of gadgetry, the comedy elements (including the return of Sheriff J.W. Pepper), and the relatively action-less plot are widely considered to be series low points, and there are a number of online publications that consider it to be the worst Bond film of all time.\n\nWhile critics have not been kind to the film as a whole, there are certain elements that became iconic upon its release. The aforementioned locations in Southern Thailand helped to make Phuket the major tourist destination that it is today, and Ko Khao Phing Kan is still referred to as “James Bond Island”. The golden gun has also become one of the series’ most famous and iconic symbols, even though it was never used by James Bond himself. Scaramanga’s skillful ability to assassinate his victims with only one shot translated well to the video game world where, starting with the 1997 Nintendo 64 game GoldenEye 007, a player who obtains the golden gun only needs one shot to instantly kill their opponent.\n\n“I only need one…”\n\nThis film proved to be the end of an era in many ways. As previously mentioned, the producing partnership between Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman was at its breaking point. The two had essentially taken turns serving as lead producer since On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, and The Man with the Golden Gun turned out to be the final Bond film produced by Saltzman. Due to overbearing financial problems, he had no choice but to sell his 50% share of the franchise to United Artists, causing a nearly three year delay until the release of the The Spy Who Loved Me. Saltzman retired from the film industry in the 80’s and died of a heart attack in 1994 at the age of 78.\n\nThe Man with the Golden Gun was the fourth and final Bond film to be directed by Guy Hamilton, who had been the catalyst behind many of the series’ most iconic elements. He only directed a small number of films following his departure from the series, including the star-studded (but critically panned) Force 10 from Navarone. He retired from directing in 1989, and died in 2016 at the age of 93. Cinematographer Ted Moore, who had worked on every Bond film up to that point, with the exception of You Only Live Twice and On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, grew ill during production of The Man with the Golden Gun, causing him to be replaced by Oswald Morris. It ended up being his final Bond film, and the unexpected replacement may explain the perceived inconsistency in the quality of shots found in the finished product. He died in 1987.\n\nChristopher Lee’s acting career stayed strong following his role as Scaramanga. Modern audiences know him best for his roles as Saruman in the Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit trilogies, Count Dooku in the Star Wars prequels, and numerous collaborations with director Tim Burton. Lee died in 2015 at the age of 93. Britt Ekland, who was thrust in the limelight throughout the 1970’s, went on to appear in films until 1989, although she has continued to act on stage and television. Hervé Villechaize embraced his role as Nick Nack, having gone on to play a similar character named Tattoo in the TV series Fantasy Island. Due to chronic pain brought on by a lifetime of health problems, he committed suicide in 1993 at the age of 50.\n\nCriticisms aside, The Man with the Golden Gun does have its supporters. I am undecided as to which side I lean toward. It is definitely on the lower end of the Bond film spectrum, but whether it hovers closer to the middle of the pack or near the bottom is hard to determine. There are times when I watch and thoroughly enjoy the film, and others where I’m bored stiff. It is one of the ones I enjoyed the most as a kid, but times and tastes change, which is what makes a definitive ranking of all the Bond films next to impossible. Nostalgia seeps in every time I watch the scenes filmed in Thailand, giving it a boost, even during the less enjoyable viewing sessions. But the oddball elements, such as the fun house, the emphasis on Scaramanga’s third nipple, and the part where Bond grabs the sumo wrestler’s butt prove to me that the series was temporarily running on fumes. That being said, there are plenty of enjoyable moments, and Scaramanga is my favorite villain of the Roger Moore era. I’ve also got to admit that I find myself quoting J.W. Pepper for days after watching it.\n\nEnd of a dynasty\n\n.\n\nFinal Verdict\n\nOverall Rating: 6 out of 10\n\nExotic locations and an excellent villain don’t prevent this film from being the first underwhelming entry in the franchise.\n\nBetter than the Book?
