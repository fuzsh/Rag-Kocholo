        "text": "This article challenges the commonly held view that the James Bond film series is episodic in its plot structure, presenting it as an attenuated, \"flexi-narrative\" form of series construction that relies on just-noticeable connections among installments. I both contextualize this unique approach by situating the films in a British context in which properly serial structures were perceived as a lowly solution to continuity-building and propose that scholars of media franchises rethink continuity-building itself to account for series that invite viewers to model a \"meta-story\" but differ from Hollywood's penchant for producing series with bold causal ties in back-to-back releases. A world poetics of the popular film series will explore how series released from other industries pursue different means for constructing series. The article's conclusion argues that narratology is a necessary supplement and even corrective to audience or fan studies of popular series, \"re-defamiliarizing\" the works themselves so that we may contextualize the selective and oppositional readings of audiences.\n\nThe most recognizable fictional spy and one of the longest running film franchises, James Bond has inspired a host of other pop culture contributions, including Doctor Who (the Jon Pertwee era), the animated television comedy series Archer, Matt Kindt&#39;s comic book series Mind MGMT, Japan&#39;s Nakano Spy School Films, the 1960s Italian Eurospy genre, and the recent 007 Legends video game. This collection of new essays analyzes Bond&#39;s phenomenal literary and filmic influence over the past 50-plus years. The 14 essays are categorized into five sections: film, television, literature, lifestyle (emphasis on fashion and home decor), and the Bond persona reinterpreted."
