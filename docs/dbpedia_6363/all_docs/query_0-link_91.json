        "text": "Last year saw the release of “007’s Road To A Million”, the reality TV contest series hosted by Brian Cox in which different people need to recreate Bond-inspired stunts in their bid to win a million dollars.\n\nDespite Eon’s claims to the contrary, it is commonly accepted the show only exists as a compromise between them and MGM’s new owner Amazon, for whom the Bond series will be the crown jewel of their new acquisition and a vital pawn on their side of the streaming wars. Basically, Amazon want regular James Bond streaming “content” and Eon just want to make major theatrical experiences every few years. A reality TV show seems an obvious middle-ground, giving Amazon what they want cheaply (the real reason reality TV dominates the television landscape today) and with very little effort from Eon’s part: no scripts to develop, no set-pieces to plan, no hundreds of millions of dollars to raise.\n\nThe candidates for a Bond TV series are many. An obvious one would be something based around the original Ian Fleming books as they are both period pieces and much more serialised than most of the films were, offering something potentially familiar but different for fans of the films. Another candidate, the spin-off series, has already been tested, as the 90s saw a James Bond Jr TV series which also span off into comic books, novels and video games.\n\nBut for this pitch we have to take on both Amazon and Eon’s requirements. Not only does this need to use the Bond name and iconography, but also this needs to be at little time or expense for Eon. And the answer seems obvious: why not use work Eon has already done?\n\nWith decades of treatments and screenplays that Eon has developed but, for one reason or another, not brought to the screen and many animation studios in Asia which make their living making films and TV series produced in the west (Rick and Morty, Blade Runner: Black Lotus, The Lord of The Rings: War of the Rohirrim), Amazon seems to be sitting on the mother of PR scoops: a series of new adventures starring previous Bond. For the cost of a couple of weeks in a soundbooth (outside of the cartoon production costs I mean), George Lazenby’s Bond could deal with Tracey’s death and get his revenge on Blofeld, Timothy Dalton could round-out his Bond film Trilogy, Pierce Brosnan could get a final film he can be proud of and Daniel Craig can get a mission to fill in the blank between his rookie period (Casino Royale/Quantum of Solace) and his “old dog” days (Skyfall/Spectre/No Time To Die). Not to mention, fans would get to experience a few what-ifs, such as John Landis’s Moore film, Quentin Tarantino’s Brosnan film or Danny Boyle’s Craig film.\n\nSome compromises might need to be made of course. Sadly, we are two actors down (RIP Sean Connery and Roger Moore), and as I categorially refute the idea that an AI generated version of them would be anything better than passing off a mute plasticine Wallace as Peter Sallis, we may unfortunately just have to do without them. Likewise, as far as I know no sequel to On Her Majesty’s Secret Service was ever written with George Lazenby in mind, as he had given up on the idea of reprising his role by the time that film premiered. As far as I know, the only unused script between the versions of On Her Majesty’s Secret Service in 1969 and Diamonds Are Forever in 1971 that we got was one that mutated into involving the vengeance of Goldfinger’s twin brother which, if it exists as a full script, still wouldn’t help us with our Lazenby sequel. While there was a treatment for a Lazenby Diamonds Are Forever which kicked off with the death of Irma Bund, the fact it would still need Eon to develop it into a full screenplay might put it in the “too much work” camp.\n\nHowever there is a later script, one written for Roger Moore, who we couldn’t otherwise homage, which might do the trick. It opens with Bond trying to get revenge on Blofeld, attacking his hideout and in which Blofeld definitely dies. A script which was seen at the time to be wrong for Moore as it wrote him “in the Connery” mould. I am speaking, of course, of the first, unused version of The Spy Who Loved Me.\n\nIn this script by Richard Maibaum, an alliance of international terrorists—including the Red Brigades, the Baader-Meinhof Gang, the Black September Organization, and the Japanese Red Army—attack SPECTRE’s headquarters in Norway and depose Ernst Stavro Blofeld, before trying to destroy the world with nuclear SLBM attacks on the world’s petroleum reservoirs to make way for a New World Order. Now, we might need some tweaking, but this sounds like a decent follow-up to On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, at least with For Your Eyes Only and The World Is Not Enough being unavailable, and an intriguing concept for fans of both Lazenby and Moore.\n\nThis would bring us to Timothy Dalton. Dalton had several 3rd film scripts written for him before a lawsuit got in the way and delayed it until it eventually had to morph into Brosnan’s first film, Goldeneye. The one which eventually mutated into Goldeneye might be the one to go with here, as it is definitely a full script, has the personal angle that suited Dalton best (a Anthony Hopkins-style mentor rather than Sean Bean-style equal) and means we don’t need to go near the script with the cyborgs.\n\nBrosnan has several potential scripts. Firstly, we should mention Everything Or Nothing, the video game many people already consider Brosnan’s true Bond Swansong as it features his likeness and voice, and came out after Die Another Day. It was also written by Brosnan’s usual Bond film writer, Bruce Feirnstein, who had written his first three Brosnan Bonds Goldeneye, Tomorrow Never Dies and The World Is Not Enough, and would go on to write Connery’s video game From Russia With Love (also Connery’s last performance as Bond. Maybe Feirstein is the real supervillain here). However, as Everything Or Nothing already exist in the public eye, we will dismiss it, only noting that our Other Potential Brosnan Final Adventure can be considered either his 5th or sixth film.\n\nOne of our candidates, discarded in favour of Tomorrow Never Dies, was adapted by its writer into the novel Forever and a Death (a title that is very close to a later James Bond novel, Forever And A Day). His own personal choice for a fifth and last film was Casino Royale, for which he approached Quentin Tarantino, who wanted to make it in black and white and set in the 1950s, an idea which seems preposterous right after Die Another Day, but entirely reasonable for a one-off animated “What-If?” film for streaming. But what does that matter, since Tarantino never wrote that script, meaning the idea is now entirely out of the remit of this exercise.\n\nOr… is it?\n\nYes, the Tarantino script doesn’t exist, but is there a period set screenplay for Casino Royale, written by a celebrated writer, that went unused?\n\nAs a matter of fact, there is. A script by none other than Ben Hecht, writer of several Hitchcock films including Spellbound and Notorious, as well as Scarface and the screen version of the novel A Farewell To Arms, which Timothy Dalton’s Bond referenced in License To Kill. He was also an uncredited hand on Stagecoach, The Thing From Another World, Mutiny On The Bounty, Foreign Correspondent, Gone With The Wind, A Star Is Born, Monkey Business, and several more Hitchcock films such as Rope and Lifeboat. It was written in the 1960s, potentially for Sean Connery, in an attempt to set up a rival series to the Eon one, which later morphed into a disastrous spoof film.\n\nI think that would do, don’t you? And we get our Connery What-If, like we got our Moore one earlier with Lazenby.\n\nBut that still leaves one Bond, doesn’t it.\n\nSome might say we don’t need one from our most recent Bond, Daniel Craig. Some are even pleased to see the back of him. But, as a Bond, and a critically acclaimed and commercially successful one at that, if we can have him we should.\n\nAnd contrary to what might be believed by the long gaps and awkward jumps of the Craig era, we do in fact have some scripts for him. Firstly, we should mention Bloodstone, the video game released and set between Quantum of Solace and Skyfall, with Daniel Craig’s likeness and voice, the closest thing we have to both a Craig Bond in his prime and a transition between Quantum and Spectre, both the films and the organisations, and written by the afore-mentioned seasoned Bond film writer, Bruce Feirnstein, who would also write the Craig video-game version of Goldeneye 007. However, we will need to dismiss Bloodstone for the same reason we dismissed Everything or Nothing, leaving us two other potential mid period Craig adventures, Peter Morgan’s Once Upon A Spy/Nothing Is Forever and Danny Boyle’s Unnamed film.\n\nThe former has been described as being in the style of John Le Carre, and was an early attempt at a 3rd Bond film for Craig. Several ideas from it would eventually make their way into Skyfall, included a mistake from M’s past coming back to haunt her and M dying at the end, though here the mistake was an affair with a KGB agent in Berlin during the cold war leading to a son, a Russian oligarch, surfacing in the present to blackmail the spymaster. Bond was then called in to tackle the villain, but is forced to kill M at the movie’s denouement.\n\nAdmittedly at least some of the script would need to be jettisoned due to its influence and contradictions with Skyfall. We might therefore have more luck with another unused Craig Bond script, which also dealt with a Russian Oligarch. Though little is known about it, its director Danny Boyle said. “Weirdly—it would have been very topical now—it was all set in Russia, which is of course where Bond came from, out of the Cold War. It was set in present-day Russia and went back to his origins, and they just lost, what’s the word… they just lost confidence in it.”\n\nI think that would work.\n\nWe might even have enough for a Season Two of our What-If Bond-Style, as there are other unused Bond scripts. These include a Dalton/Brosnan Thunderball remake called Warhead 4000, a mostly original script co-written by Sean Connery himself (written with spy-thriller writer Len Deighton, the script focused on SPECTRE shooting down aircraft over the Bermuda Triangle, before taking over Liberty Island and Ellis Island as staging areas for an invasion of New York City through the sewers under Wall Street), and a Casino Royale play written by Bond continuation author Raymond Benson, to say nothing of more scripts Eon themselves may have written and shelved, or the scripts Ian Fleming is said to have written himself (not counting Thunderball).\n\nBut what do you think of these ideas? Would you like to see these turned into a 4 part animated series made for streaming?\n\nOliver Giggins\n\nREFERENCES.\n\nJeremy Dunn, 2020. Dunn On Bond.\n\nMark Edlitz, 2020. The Lost Adventures Of James Bond.\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/film/2015/nov/20/lost-james-bond-film-once-upon-a-spy-007-killing-m\n\nFleming and Dahl have recently been in the press together due to their publishers deciding to edit their past works for, allegedly, modern sensibilities and, at least partially, copyright extension. However this not the only reason to associate the two authors, as Ian Fleming and Roald Dahl had a long history, whose literary history alone included collaboration, accusations of plagiarism, ghost-writing allegations, and some of the most famous adaptations of the 50s and 60s by the likes of Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho, North By Northwest, Rebecca), The Sherman Brothers (Mary Poppins, The Jungle Book, Bedknobs and Broomsticks) and Lewis Gilbert (Sink The Bismark, Alfie, Educating Rita).\n\nHowever when they met, books could not have been furthest from their mind. They became friends during World War II, when they were both doing intelligence work in Washington, Fleming in coordination with the US government for British Naval Intelligence and Dahl doing propaganda work for the BSI. In fact, Dahl may never have become a writer if not for this work: it was a meeting to gather material for a propaganda story with another author, CS Forester, known today as the author of the Hornblower novels, which pushed Dahl to write and sell his first ever story. When Dahl met Fleming, there was little to indicate they would be friends:\n\n“He was against Ian because of an affair Ian had had with Lady Huntley. Apparently he’d treated her badly.”\n\nSir William Stephenson, p282.\n\nDahl was no boyscout himself though, and the two men had much in common. By the end of the war, Dahl was a successful writer, while Fleming was still just a journalist with an idle dream, though he didn’t dare tell his friend.\n\n“Ian never said he was going to write, but he never missed a trick as far as my own writing was concerned. Terribly interested. Read the stories as they appeared in the New Yorker.\n\nRoald Dahl\n\nBut whatever he let his friend think, Fleming was already thinking about his own stories. Dahl’s first story in the New Yorker was “The Sound Machine” in September 1949. The next would be over two years later. In between, Fleming met and became friends with Peter Quennell, who had this to say when interviewed John Pearson, Fleming’s colleague at the Sunday Times and his first biographer, about their initial meeting in the late 40s/early 50s.\n\n“The first place I saw Ian was when I went to stay with the Rothermeres at Wraxall. I remember he drove me back. It would have been around 1949. […] And as he drove he talked a lot. Said he was going to write the thriller to end all thrillers. He had got the plot worked our and had had it approved by Raymond Chandler.”\n\nPeter Quennell\n\nFleming would never actually write this story. According to Dahl, Fleming happily gave to him to use it as the basis of his classic short story Lamb To the Slaughter. One of Dahl’s most famous adult stories, it was later shot for TV by Alfred Hitchcock in 1958 and for Roald Dahl’s own TV anthology series Tales Of The Unexpected in 1979, where he introduced it thus:\n\n“My friend the late Ian Fleming, the James Bond man, was really responsible for the story you are going to see now. We were staying the weekend at a house in Vermont and at dinner the roast leg of lamb was so dry and tough that Ian looked across to me and whispered “This ruddy thing must have been in the deep freeze for ten years, she ought to be shot.”\n\n“No,” I said, “not shot. I think there must be a more interesting punishment than that. And that’s how the idea for the story began.”\n\nRoald Dahl\n\nThe house in Vermont was Black Hole Hollow Farm and belonged to their Washington-era friend and colleague Ivar Bryce. However, different versions of this story tally less well with the anecdote as told by Dahl. The version he told Fleming’s biographer John Pearson ends with Fleming asking: “Why don’t you have someone murder their husband with a frozen leg of mutton which she then serves to the detectives who come to investigate the murder?” better justifying Dahl’s acknowledgement that Fleming was “really responsible for the story”. Another suggests that far from accidentally prompting a thought or giving Dahl the story idea outright, Fleming felt enough ownership of the idea to spend some time developing his own story with it.\n\n“And as he drove he talked a lot. Said he was going to write the thriller to end all thrillers. He had got the plot worked our and had had it approved by Raymond Chandler. There wd. be a murder, but no sign of the weapon. The detective and various suspects wd. be asked to dinner and wd. sit down to an excellently cooked leg of mutton. Later it wd. turn out that the mutton will. have been the weapon, deep-frozen in the frigidaire.”\n\nPeter Quennell\n\nOf course, I am not imputing that Dahl stole the idea from Fleming, only that they had the idea together and both wanted to use it at some point, though only one of them actually did so. And if Quennell was remembering this summary correctly, it suggests Fleming was planning to go in a different direction with the story. In Lamb To The Slaughter, the protagonist is Mary Maloney, a devoted, contented and heavily pregnant housewife, awaiting her husband Patrick’s return home from his job as police detective. When he returns however, he gives her (to us, undisclosed) shocking news and Mary, almost without thinking, kills him with a leg of lamb. As a police officer’s wife, she then puts together an alibi, calls in the murder and gets her husband’s friend to eat the murder weapon while they discuss its possible location. One officer, his mouth full of meat, says it is “probably right under our very noses”. Mary, overhearing them, begins to giggle.\n\nIt seems Fleming’s version would have been more of a straight up detective mystery story, without the emphasis on the domestic setting and housewife. The presence of Chandler here is worth mentioning, as is an important distinctions: “thrillers” not “spy stories”. To the people Fleming was talking to, the distinction between detective and spy stories was probably non-existent, and indeed back then the link between them was still blurred: the last Sherlock Holmes story was a spy one, and Agatha Christie would write both throughout her career. This inclination can be said to have bled into Casino Royale itself, as it would be Chandler’s favourite Fleming book, and he would say he felt Fleming had gradually lost something with each subsequent novel.\n\nAs to the finished version of Lamb To The Slaughter, there is little to suggest scandal. Dahl wrote his version in 1952, making it most likely concurrent or subsequent to the writing of Casino Royale, which preceded it in publication due to Dahl’s issues in placing it: it was rejected, along with four other stories, by The New Yorker, and ultimately published in Harper’s Magazine in September 1953, five months after Casino Royale. The manuscript was first submitted (and rejected) for publication in December 1952 , suggesting its inception was concurrent with Fleming re-writing or seeking publication for his own novel. If Quennell and Dahl are correct in their dates, the timeline could suggest Dahl held off on writing it until Fleming had explicitly moved on to another idea. And if Dahl knew his friend followed his career with interest, it seems doubtful Fleming would have missed this story, or that Dahl would have been sure he would. If there was any tension between the two men regarding Lamb To The Slaughter, it went undocumented for its duration.\n\nHowever, there is the matter of another Roald Dahl story, The Visitor. According to John Pearson, Roald Dahl told him that: “After this he [Fleming] kept on at it, but none of the other ideas he sent me were quite usable” though he did think “very seriously of doing” one of them, except he couldn’t think of a twist ending. However Fleming’s friend Ivar Bryce remembered another Fleming story, told to him via Blanshard. Al Hart, Ian Fleming’s editor at the publishers Macmillans, remembered Ian Fleming telling him about that same story, again via framing device:\n\n“He once told me that he had told a story at a dinner party where Princess [Margaret] was present. Everyone was being asked to tell a ghost story. He told about a traveller in the Harz mountains. Knocks on the door of a great castle. Let in by butler. Asked to stay. Intro. To the owner. Gracious. Fine meal. To bed. In the night beautiful woman comes into bed with him. Next morning he says, “Sorry not to have met your wife.”\n\n“Ah. My wife. That is the great sorrow of my life. After I married her I discovered she was a leper.”\n\nPrincess Margaret. Apparently said, “Oh dear,” halfway through the story. No one laughed at the end.”\n\nThe story would have a better reception when Roald Dahl’s ‘The Visitor’ was published in Playboy in 1965, less than a year after Fleming’s death. The stories are virtually identical, with the only changes being the location, which became a mansion in Cairo, the addition of daughters, and the unnamed “man” now being Uncle Oswald, a Dahl character who would later return in another story, Bitch (1974), as well as Dahl’s second and last adult novel, My Uncle Oswald (1979), though The Visitor remained the last story chronologically, for obvious reasons.\n\nFurther complicating matters is the Master of the Girl Pat, a 1949 novel by Dod Orsborne, which presents another, very similar, version of the story, with again just the location (the isolated Barawi Islands in the Arabian Sea) and number of daughters (two again) changing, as well as the timeframe (a week now). The story is presented by Orsborne as true, as heard from an English newspaper editor who had got it first-hand from one of his feature writers. According to him, the writer this had happened to had returned to London, told the story to his editor, and two days later committed suicide. Orsborne suggested to the editor, “Why don’t you write the story yourself? Wouldn’t it make a good plot for a piece of fiction?” The editor argued, “It isn’t worth a damn. Nobody would believe it. As the Americans say, it would sound too corny”.\n\nIf the context provided by Orsborne is at least partly true, as opposed to a framing device similar to Uncle Oswald’s diaries themselves, then it is possible that both Orsborne and Dahl got the story from Fleming, who was a journalist in this time period, and was apparently telling Quennell the Lamb to the Slaughter idea the same year as Orsborne’s book came out. Or it is also possible that both Dahl and Fleming got the idea from Orsborne. Fleming would be sued for plagiarism later with the Thunderball case, and the contexts of these anecdotes doesn’t make it clear if this was meant to be an original piece of work he was presenting to friends or somebody else’s story being told once for the amusement of some one-time guests. As for Dahl, there is not only the mystery around Lamb To The Slaughter but also an accusation of plagiarism around the plot of his 1987 short story “The Bookseller,” also published in Playboy, which Dahl apparently lifted from a tale written by James Gould Cozzens. We can also add to the mix the question of cryptomnesia, in which a creative thinks he has come up with something when he is actually just remembering something from a forgotten source.\n\nEither way, this would not be the last time The Visitor was co-opted by someone, as according to Wikipedia, Alfred Hitchcock occasionally told this story as a black joke during his appearances on American talk shows in his later years. And if either were stolen, Fleming didn’t hold it against his friend as kept up with his stories after his own success.\n\n“Later, after the first books, he would say “Of course, I’m just playing about. My stuff is nothing. Despicable stuff. But yours is literature.”\n\nRoald Dahl\n\nDahl was equally complimentary about Fleming’s writing skills.\n\n“As a writer, he’s a man who doesn’t miss a trick.\n\nRoald Dahl\n\nWhen Fleming died only a decade later, it seemed like their last chance to work together had passed with him, but it was not the case. Leaving aside the (now debunked) rumours Dahl ghost-wrote the first ever Bond Universe extended work, The Adventures of James Bond Junior, it would happen two more times, both of which were also a Dahl solo project in which he worked from a Fleming outline, though now posthumously: the next time it was the Eon Bond film You Only Live Twice in 1967, for which Roald Dahl wrote the screenplay.\n\nThe primary Bond screenwriter, Richard Maibaum, was unavailable for his usual scripting duties, and several previous replacements proved inadequate. Increasingly less book-faithful drafts had been written by Sydney Boehm and Harold Jack Bloom, including ones which opened with Bond’s fake death and burial at sea, and the ninja attack (The inclusion of these ideas in the final script earned Bloom a “Additional Story Material” credit), but Eon still weren’t happy and looked around for a new writer. Roald Dahl had little experience in screenwriting up to this point, except for the uncompleted The Bells of Hell Go Ting-a-ling-a-ling and he seems to have been chosen partly as a personal favour: Cubby Broccoli was a family man, and he responded positively to an appeal from a mutual friend who knew Dahl was in urgent need of money to cover some family medical bills. The fact Dahl was a friend of Fleming’s can’t have hurt either.\n\n“You Only Live Twice was the only Fleming book that had virtually no semblance of a plot that could be made into a movie. The concept of Blofeld patrolling his garden of poisonous plants in a medieval suit of armour and lopping off the heads of half-blinded Japanese was ridiculous. When I began the script, I could retain only four or five of the original novel’s story ideas. Obviously, the movie had to take place in Japan. We kept Blofeld and Tiger Tanaka and Bond’s pearl-diving girlfriend, Kissy Suzuki. And we retained the Ninjas – those masters of oriental martial arts who use their talents to raid Blofeld’s hideout. But aside from those bits, I had nothing except a wonderful Ian Fleming title.”\n\nRoald Dahl\n\nWith only six week to deliver the first draft and no idea what to replace Fleming’s plot with, he decided to combine a basic plot similar to Dr. No, inspired by the story of a missing nuclear-armed U.S. Air Force bomber over Spain and by the Soviet Union and the United States’ recent first spacewalks from Voskhod 2 and Gemini 4. The only direction he was given was to keep Bond’s character consistent and to use “the girl formula” of three women for Bond to seduce, an ally and a henchwoman who both get killed, and the main Bond girl. This pushed him to swap out new character Aki for book character Kissy Suzuki for the third act when both could have easily been the same character, and to create Helga Brandt, a redhead traitor more than a little reminiscent of Fiona Volpe, a popular character added to the last film, Thunderball.\n\nDahl found director Lewis Gilbert an easy collaborator:\n\n“He not only helped in script conferences, but had some good ideas and then left you alone, and when you produced the finished thing, he shot it. Other directors have such an ego that they want to rewrite it and put their own dialogue in, and it’s usually disastrous. What I admired so much about Lewis Gilbert was that he just took the screenplay and shot it. That’s the way to direct: You either trust your writer or you don’t.”\n\nLess successful would be Dahl’s second Fleming screenplay, for the children’s musical film Chitty Chitty Bang Bang the following year, which was also based on a Fleming book. Roald Dahl later called his screenplay to the former “the biggest load of bullshit I have ever put my hand to” and Albert R Broccoli called the one for the latter “a piece of shit”. Director Ken Hughes claimed he subsequently rewrote Dahl’s script, and Roald Dahl was not invited to the premiere.\n\nPlagiarised or not, it therefore seems uncontroversial to label Lamb To The Slaughter, the earliest and shortest Fleming-Dahl work, the most fruitful one. The fact it was the only one both halves were alive for might have helped. At least one person has suggested that Fleming’s relaxed collaborations with Roald Dahl were responsible for his assumption that ideas could just be used when and as needed, a belief which would ultimately lead to Thunderball, decades of litigation, and even Fleming’s own death from several heart-attacks. Whether that is true could be beyond the ken of anyone still living. But, regrettable as it might be that Fleming and Dahl’s publishers have edited their past works, it is perhaps fitting that they are still associated with each other in the context of someone taking another author’s work and making it their own.\n\nOliver Giggins\n\nREFERENCE LIST\n\nJohn Pearson, 2020.

Inside, they find Doctor Frank’n’Furter (Stephen Webb), and their acolytes Riff Raff (Kristian Lavercombe), Columbia (Darcy Finden), Magenta (Suzie McAdam) and phantoms (Reese Budin, Fionan O’Carroll, Jessica Sole, Sefania Du Toit, Tyla Dee Nurden and Nathan Shaw), transvestites from the planet Transylvania – told you it was getting less run-of-the-mill – experimenting on human matter Eddie (Joe Allen) and Rocky (Ben Westhead) with sonic tranducers, rubber gloves, sex, and a floor-show. (And we’re back to the every day stuff. Or is that just me?)\n\nRichard O’Brien’s The Rocky Horror Picture Show must have been a somewhat puzzling experience for many early viewers, inspired as it was by the unintentional humour of self-serious shlocky horror B movies, Steve Reeves muscle films, and 1950s rock’n’roll. And if that seems an unlikely combination, don’t worry: the script weaves these strands together with the care and focus of a madman making spaghetti, to music that’s about as character and plot-driven as a YouTube mix on shuffle (and that includes adverts).\n\nHowever despite this (or maybe thanks to it) the 1975 film adaptation starring Tim Curry subsequently become a hit as a midnight movie, when audience members would frequently return to the cinemas dressed as the various characters and talk back to the screen. It’s now the longest-running theatrical release in film history, being still in limited release 47 years after its premiere. And unsurprisingly, the film’s influence has bled backwards into the source material, including by swapping “Sweet Transvestite” and “Time Warp”, replacing the “Charles Atlas Song” with “I Can Make You a Man” and, of course, the stage version now also being noted for its built-in audience participation (not to mention audience members in costume). The indebtedness to the film is seemingly referenced in this production with the top of Hugh Durrant’s curling set resembling a film reel.\n\nDespite a somewhat more muted reception on the night I attended, possibly a casualty of the several years we’ve all spent in doors (even the audience’s costumes seemed less outgoing), this tradition is still going strong to this day, allowing in particular Philip Franks’s Narrator a lot of fun with the audiences, not just with the standard call-and-responses but also some off-the-cuff seeming topical references, and even some brief parodies of other shows appearing in the same theatre this year.\n\nThe cast’s experience with the show (many of them are Rocky veterans) is clear and confident, with Stephen Webb and Kristian Lavercombe being clear audience favourites, no mean feat considering how ingrained Tim Curry and Richard O’Brien’s takes are, while Haley Flaherty and Richard Meek also shine in the less flashy roles of Brad and Janet. The rest of the ensemble and band (visible in outline above the stage) are also great, bringing the right touch of weird camp and rock’n’roll to the proceedings.\n\nUnlike classic plays, many of which are out of copyright, musicals often have very little leeway for variation and reinvention and Rocky Horror, with its call-and-response audience reaction and half-a-century-old cult fanbase, might be even more beholden to this than most: it’s not like costume designer Sue Blane can reinvent the protagonists’ looks into something totally different, or like choreographer Nathan Wright can let loose on the Time Warp routine without rewriting lyrics and confusing fans.\n\nHowever director Christopher Luscombe keeps it fresh, hitting all the necessary beats but never with a sense of obligation, while the pantomimy sets (much more colourful than those of the film, which reused many props from actual Hammer Horror films it found locally); musical arrangements by Richard Hartley, Simon Beck, Greg Arrowsmith and Charlie Ingles; and hazy lighting by Nick Richings keep everything light and fresh. It’s also worth highlighting the sound design by Gareth Owen, which keeps everything distinct and clear in a way which I wish I could say was more common.\n\nThe Rocky Horror Show, in all its variants, continues to enrapture fans, make converts and befuddle others half a century later, and if you are in either of the first two categories, actually or potentially, then this is a must-see. It is guaranteed to give you some terrible thrills.\n\nThe Rocky Horror Show is running at the Edinburgh Playhouse until the 18th March.

However, her cells were taken without her or her family’s knowledge or permission (they only found out decades after her death, and by accident) and continue to be exploited financially.\n\nHenrietta was not the only black woman whose body has been exploited. In some cases, such as this, it was by the medical establishment with some kind of medical basis (another example of which is the full nervous system of “Harriet Cole” at Drexel University’s medical campus in Northwest Philadelphia). Other uses had no real purpose at all, such as that of Ssehura, also known as Saartjie “Sarah” Baartman, who was kept at the Musee de l’Homme in Paris until 2002, after which she was returned to South Africa after much legal wrangling, almost 200 years after she was taken from there to be publicly displayed for her unique physique.\n\nThe show concerns itself with this larger issue, paralleling Lacks’ story with that of Anarcha (Mofetoluwa Akande), Betsey (Keziah Joseph), and Lucy (Aimée Powell), three of the slaves which the so-called inventor of Gynaecology, James Marion Sims, experimented on and with to develop his technique for repairing vesicovaginal fistulas, (a severe complication of obstructed childbirth), as well as for creating several recognisable tools still used today, many of which are named after him. Though Sims and the many men who benefited from Lacks’ cells are absent from the show, they are represented through the presence of the Smoking Man (Alistair Hall), a stand-in for not only exploitative humans but also other forms of parasite, including illness. This is because the show doesn’t wish to immortalise these things, or dwell on the pain they inflected and continue to inflict (though these are not ignored either.) Written by Mojisola Adebayo and directed by Matthew Xia, this show is about forgotten legacy and the miracles ordinary people are part of.\n\nA previous version of the show was done as promenade theatre, and a remnant of that remains in the set designed by Simon Kenny, partially natural with its rocks and tree (made to resemble a strand of DNA) but also clearly segmented into different areas, allowing us to follow the different strands of the story around as they leap from different historical moments and metaphysical plains, ending in a positive burst of dancing choreographed by Movement Director Diane Alison-Mitchell.\n\nAdebayo’s poetic modern drama is stunningly brought to life through Xia’s direction as well as the set, lighting and sound (by Simon Kenny, Simisola Majekodunmi and Francesca Amewudah-Rivers), though the onerous is on the five-person cast, most of which have to play several characters in very different situations (the work of the Movement director clearly shows here, not to take anything from the cast) but also put the flesh back on these bones. Francis as Lacks is the heart of the show, while Akande, Joseph and Powell bring unique touches to each of their characters, making them not only unique and memorable, but real in every way they need to be.\n\nFamily Tree is a powerful exploration of a subject which, though it has got more topical in recent years, is still very much unexplored for many people. As a celebration and a commemoration it is a complete success, which will entertain, enthral without seeming to teach, even though it probably will.\n\nFamily Tree is running at the Traverse Theatre until the 7th April.

Several in fact, and not the kind that live harmoniously with a successful and public career as a child psychiatrist. But buried things often rot and fester, and these secrets have a habit of suddenly robbing even the most pleasant moment of its security as the ground gives out from under him, until the question becomes one of life or death…\n\nOr at least that’s my byline for the show. The one on the Traverse website talks about “being haunted”, “didn’t realise”, “a modern ghost story” and an “eerie psychological thriller” which, while not entirely inaccurate, really only reflects about twenty minutes in the last quarter of this 90 minute show. But I suppose marketing’s got to market and, while the mystery might have been worth playing up in what is really more a relationship and family drama with supernatural over-tones, I doubt anyone who bought a ticket due to one description of the show will leave disappointed by the product itself.\n\nThanks to their chemistry and committed performances from MacAninch, Mara Huf and Ben Ewing, the play is involving even when the mystery is more suggested than explored. Huf gives a lot of charm and pathos to Joseph’s partner Cindy, her chemistry with MacAninch going a long way to humanising his more reserved character, while Ben Ewing as Sam shines in two smaller but vital roles, all the trickier for one being mostly non-verbal and the other reliant on the repetition of a few choice phrases.\n\nDirector Kolbrún Björt Sigfúsdóttir, Assistant Director Cairan McLaggan and Designer Kenneth MacLeod make great use of the limited space. The entire play happens in a boxed-in area centre stage, populated only by a wall, door, table and chairs (though the unlocked door’s doorknob is a slight quibble when we are supposed to believe it doesn’t exist in certain scenes), delineated by Michaella Fee’s LED tube lights which flash and change colour more or less diegetically and only opened up by a video screen and a few voice-overs. At times intimate and at others claustrophobic, it never feels restraining, while Video designer Rob Willoughby’s work bridges well the often major time and spacial jumps between scenes.\n\nAt times very funny, sweet and thematically rich, Childminder is a great showcase of its team’s talents and a thrilling show. While those who go in shouldn’t expect a full-on horror, or even a tight psychological drama, they will either find a well crafted and engaging claustrophic show about guilt and repression\n\nChildminder is running at the Traverse Theatre until the 10th June.

In the musical, the couple’s son, a baker (Darren Walls) and his wife (Justyne Snyder) make their own deal with the witch (Maaike Hillen) in order to have a child, a deal which will lead him to interact with characters and events from “Little Red Riding Hood” (Missy Hingley, with Andrew Lodge as the Wolf / Lucinda and Bo Gourley as Granny / Narrator), “Cinderella” (Fiona Dawson, with Joe Gill as the Prince, Heather Richardson as the Stepmother, Shannon Scott as Florinda and Aric Hanscomb Ryrie as the Dad/Narrator) “Jack and the Beanstalk” (Orla Bayne, with Clarice Bruch as Milky White and Fiona Wilson as Jack’s Mum), “Rapunzel” (Laura Preston, with Hannah McGregor as her Prince and Kirsty Allan as Steward / Narrator), amongst others.\n\nMost of this occurs in the first act, culminating in a seeming happy ending for all. Apparently many audience members therefore think the intermission signals the end of the show, a confusion this production circumvents by having several characters make it explicitly clear to the audience that a second half will follow in fifteen minutes. This later Act continues the previous storylines in a mostly original direction, dealing with the consequences of these whirlwind romances, deals with the devil (well, a witch) and giant murders.\n\nThough the show is a staple of musical theatre repertoire, this post-modern mash-up structure is undoubtedly ambitious on a lower budget: you could see roughly three Fringe shows in the time it takes all these characters to get in and out of the Woods, and none of them require a giant in their climax. And this production, directed by Roza Stevenson, makes some interesting choices to get round its limitations, including with the use of an H-shaped stage with the band (Paul Sinclair, Am Koch, Gavin Lee, Emily Phillips and Amelia Brenan) and some of the action at one end, a traverse-style catwalk in the middle, and the other end most notably used for Rapunzel’s tower. Though this all but guarantees every audience member will have a sight-line problem at one point or another, it is definitely immersive, as are Set Designers Lilli Steffens and Holly Spragg’s vegetation garlands which meet the audience at the door and follow them to their seats.\n\nThough the show’s unwieldly structure is a challenge most productions struggle with and most audience members might know about going in, bright spots such as Maaike Hillen and Joe Gill’s performances keep things going at a good clip, while the show gets the most out of its human cow Clarice Bruch’s physical comedy, making the silent role in a musical into one of its most distinctive parts. Though I wouldn’t have complained if she had been given Jack’s plaintive “I Guess This Is Goodbye” to sing in heart-wrenching “mooos”.\n\nInto The Woods is running at Edinburgh College until the 18th June.

(ah, the Fringe, where if it can’t be used as a performance space, you’re just not trying hard enough. Or maybe you’re just trying at all.)\n\nCompany Scantily Glad Theatre and writer-performers Sam Kruger and S.E. Grummett made their Edinburgh Fringe debut last year with Fool Moon Komming and Something In the Water respectively, with the latter show also being the winner of the Best Theatre Award at Adelaide Fringe 2021 and, as one of the best shows he saw last Fringe, the reason this reviewer signed on to see this show without even knowing what it’s about.\n\nTheir comedic style, built on Pochinko clowning which merges the pedagogy of French performer Jacques Lecoq and Canadian First Nations performance practice, is on terrific display here, not only in their sexy dances or routines such as a re-enactment of their own birth, but also in their manic delivery of the spoken text (“Guys-guys-guys-guys-guys!!!!”) in both its childish, gross or cruel moments. Its energy and precision is masterly, helping propel the show through its shifting subjects and themes, and their confidence shows in their interactions with the audience, either planned or improvised, in such things as a game of Truth or Dare.\n\nWhile the idea of the Fringe is sold on the offbeat and the small scale, too often are its main attractions the big names (either living or dead) and the ordinary (ever seen a white man on stage talking about himself into a microphone??!!). The Creepy Boys are neither big names or ordinary, and though their journey across the Atlantic may have brought them over the Gulf Stream, it certainly hasn’t taken them into the mainstream, and that is all to the good. Energetic, passionate, professional and often very funny, this is a show that defies summary with its own buzzwords (the show is comedy, horror, nostalgia, LGBT+, to name a few) and deserves to be seen.\n\nCreepy Boys plays until August 27th (not 21st) at Summerhall Demonstration Room, and tickets can be found at https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/creepy-boys\n\nReviewer: Oliver Giggins Reviewed: 13th August 2023 North West End UK Rating: 4 stars.\n\nOriginal review available at: https://northwestend.com/creepy-boys-summerhall-demonstration-room/\n\nWHAT GOES ON WITHOUT ME\n\nat the Space On the Mile 2\n\nNottingham New Theatre are an English student-run theatre producing over thirty shows a year, ranging from Elizabethan classics to contemporaries plays and original student-written pieces. Their Fringe show this year, What Goes On Without Me, is in the latter category and asks the question “what would you do if, after you died, you could have 10 extra minutes of life that had no impact on anything other than you?”\n\nThat is the question facing Jude. She has woken up dead, in a waiting room located on the upper east side of the afterlife, and in the company of a slightly dotty omniscient being offering cups of tea, biscuits, some celebrity gossip and the above dilemma (with caveats).\n\nInterspersed with vox pops of interviewees trying to answer the same question, this is comedic yet sincere attempt to ask a philosophical question which, even if the solution wasn’t personal, would still have no definitive answer. So while the question might be the meat of the show, at its heart are the two performances by the actors playing the Higher Power and Jude, who remain likeable and funny respectively as the excentric comedy foil and the less flashy but equally challenging lead.\n\nThe theatre company’s ambition and experience is on clear display in this well-acted and very entertaining play around an intriguing concept. If the idea intrigues you, you won’t be disappointed.\n\nWhat Goes On Without Me plays 17, 19, 22, 24, 26 August at the Space on the mile 2, and tickets can be found at: https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/what-goes-on-without-me\n\nReviewer: Oliver Giggins Reviewed: 15th August 2023 North West End UK Rating: 3 stars.\n\nOriginal review available at: https://northwestend.com/what-goes-on-without-me-the-space-on-the-mile-2/\n\nTHE LAST SHOW BEFORE WE DIE\n\nAt Summerhall Roundabout\n\nThe Last Show Before We Die was created, written and performed by Mary Higgins and Ell Potter, or Ell and Mary as we know the versions of themselves they present on-stage.\n\nThey are former lovers, and current (still) best friends, housemates and work partners, whose previous collaborations include FITTER and HOTTER. The latter was the last piece of live theatre this reviewer saw before the first lock-down of the pandemic, which was already making its mark when audience members were encouraged to jump up and dance at the end of the show, but to do it without moving around the theatre or coming into contact with anyone.\n\nThe history the two performers share (with each other, not with Covid, or me) is central to this show, and obvious whether you know about their previous projects or not, as we find them here at a crossroads, considering going their separate ways to explore their lives in ways which aren’t built around each other.\n\nThat is what makes this “the last show”. It is their last show together, prompting a series of pieces around different kinds of endings. These are informed, as in their previous work together, by recorded interviews with, amongst others, an addict, a midwife, a child, and a grandparent, in a soundtrack by Tom Foskett-Barnes.\n\nThere is an improvisational feel to proceedings, as everything including the show itself gets discussed and deconstructed. This helps bring you into the duo’s world and connect these disparate endings, an attitude which was undoubtedly successful judging by the number of people who left in tears at the idea of two people they didn’t know not sharing a kitchen any more. But then Higgins and Potter are seasoned pros at this, projecting vulnerability and personality amidst a tightly rehearsed series of movement and dialogue pieces directed by Sammy Glover and choreographed by Ted Rogers.\n\nThat, Foskett-Barnes’ soundscapes and the lighting by David Doyle keep the energy high and weird, aided by the venue itself, which looked like we were under a family-sized UFO. However the inherent cabaret-ness of the show make the parts of the show easy to identify and rank, making this experience simultaneously lesser and greater than the sum of its parts.\n\nHeartfelt and energetic throughout, The Last Show Before We Die will make you laugh and admire the craft on display (some of it of the arts and crafts variety) on its way to ending which makes you care about its protagonists and hope they do well. If theatre is meant to be an experience, this was undoubtedly that.\n\nThe Last Show Before We Die plays until 27th August at Summerhall Roundabout, and tickets can be found at: https://tickets.edfringe.com/whats-on/last-show-before-we-die\n\nReviewer: Oliver Giggins\n\nReviewed: 21st August 2023\n\nNorth West End UK Rating: 4 stars.\n\nOriginal review available at: https://northwestend.com/the-last-show-before-we-die-summerhall-roundabout/\n\nYIPPEE KI YAY\n\nat the Gilded Balloon at the Museum\n\nThe phrase “Yippe Ki Yay” originated in the 19th-century Western United States, making its way into the 1988 film Die Hard entirely within the context of old Westerns: it closes a scene in which Alan Rickman’s Hans Gruber accuses Bruce Willis’s John McClane of having seen to many John Wayne films and the latter answers he always preferred Roy Rogers.\n\nThough the show adds the words “the Die Hard parody” in brackets at the end of its title just to be sure, I wouldn’t imagine there is a soul on Earth that went into a show named Yippe Ki Yay looking for a musical about the Old West, such is the hold Die Hard now has over the phrase. It has since been said in every sequel (and a poster) without even an attempt at another cowboy reference, the franchise itself providing its context now.\n\nWritten by Richard Marsh, who also originated the role last Fringe, and directed by Hal Chambers, this version of the show stars Darrel Bailey as the Die Hard superfan and our guide into the world of Die Hard. His retelling of the original film comes in verse, with impressions of all the different characters ranging from an evocative Bruce Willis to a caricature Alan Rickman, going through the plainly inaccurate in the case of some of the henchmen. The sum is punctuated by snapshots into the film’s biggest impact on his life: his relationship with his wife.\n\nThis latter aspect is the heart of the show, while the former gives us the laughs as we watch this one man attempt to recreate a large-budget action-film on his own, on stage, with only a few boxes of props, imitating what he can, replacing what he can’t, and critiquing where he dares. Personally, I think Holly’s agency in the film has aged like small potatoes compared to Al Powell’s arc of relearning it’s okay for police officers to shoot-to-kill people in the street, but hey, this is a comedy show for people who love a film.\n\nBailey handles both the humour and heart of the show with aplomb, giving the audience a journey through a story they (probably) love but with its own unique slant, fully earning the standing ovation I am sure he earned on more than one occasion. This show delivers exactly what it says on the tin, adding just enough to stand on its own and provide a full experience, even for audiences who may not know the film outside of its memes and cultural reference points.

It isn’t the anniversary of its first publication, of the author’s birth, the author’s death, or of any of its most famous adaptations – apologies, uberfans of The Satanic Rites of Dracula, happy 50th to you – and yet this year we have seen two cinematic depictions of Dracula (the Nicholases Hoult and Cage film Renfield and the adaptation of a single chapter of the original novel with The Last Voyage of the Demeter), with another remake of Nosferatu also being shot this year (and also starring Nicholas Hoult). And of course, latest but not leastest, there is Dracula: Mina’s Reckoning, from the National Theatre of Scotland and Aberdeen Performing Arts, in association with Belgrade Theatre, Coventry.\n\nAs its title clearly states, this is Mina’s story, as told to the other inmates of a psychiatric hospital in Aberdeenshire in 1897. This Scottish setting draws on the original novel’s neglected Scottish roots, which include its basis in the research of almost forgotten Scots writer Emily Gerard (who first introduced the word “Nosferatu” to the English language in her works on Transylvanian history and superstitions), and the Scottish locations which inspired Stoker in his writing of the novel, though he transposed them out of their original country.\n\nThough this production’s built around an all-female and non-binary casting, Maggie Bain, Liz Kettle and Catriona Faint’s turns as the backward Doctor Seward, evil Dracula, and ineffectual Jonathan Harker stand entirely on their own ground as their distinctive versions of these characters and Natalie Arle-Toyne’s comedic take on Doctor Van Helsing gets many of the laughs in the show. Less successful are some of the comedic jabs at Victorian male attitudes (“You can grow your mind or a child, not both”) which, ironically, are new to the 2023 version of the story and didn’t exist in the Victorian original.\n\nSome will have been informed by Victorian events outside of the book, such as the work of Thomas Clouston at the Royal Edinburgh Asylum which this play references. However, presenting them for comedic effect only highlights its distance from the original story, and it is especially puzzling that this was added in, when other scientific inaccuracies from the source material, such as the unknown risks of having blood transfusions from multiple donors irrespective of blood-type, are not only ignored, but preserved here unquestioned. It seems the dangers of the patriarchy and its control of women’s bodies could have been more, dare I say, fluidly shown by Doctor’s Seward’s ego-driven decision to be a blood-donor directly leading to Lucy’s death rather than by a few one-liners. Other changes are downright regressive when compared to the original book, such as making Lucy, the only other female character beside Mina, into a wanton bi-sexual, putting this play in a long tradition of linking sexuality to death and bi-sexuality to promiscuity which simply didn’t exist in the original text.\n\nSimilarly, several jarring shifts in the show’s last third muddy the characters in a way which feels less thematic than confused. What relevance does Renfield’s imprisonment for their non-binary wearing of trousers have if they (they are “them” to the inmates and “she” to Dr Seward) are also still obsessed with eating living things of increasing sizes in the belief that “the blood is the life”, and serving Dracula for this reason? How is Lucy a victim and Mina our heroine if the latter choses the same fate, even just for a time, as the former, and embraces (almost literally) the killer and curse of her best friend?\n\nIronically, this only-partial change in adaptation results in many of the male characters, cartoonish as they might be, being more clearly drawn than our lead, played by Danielle Jam. This partial coagulation (sorry) of ideas and tones might be a case of too many cooks, as Pearson was joined in the credits by director, Sally Cookson, for the conception of the play, both were joined by Rosie Kellagher for the story credit, and The Company is credited with additional material.\n\nHowever, this shared ownership might have helped the show in other ways, as the visuals and the ensemble’s work cannot be faulted. The latter’s dual roles are all distinct and memorable, with Ailsa Davidson’s Lucy Anne Lacey’s Mr Swails and Ros Watt’s Renfield each getting their time in the spotlight. The different levels of designer Kenneth MacLeod’s industrial set, with its gangways, ramps and ladders, gives them all a lot to work with, and allow the production to seamlessly shift from location to location, and from atmosphere to mood as Lewis Den Hertog’s projected clouds of blood and handwriting flow over its rocky peaks. Benji Dower’s music and Aideen Malone’s lighting give it all a moody, gothic feel, even allowing for the occasional (and highly effective) jump-scare centre stage.\n\nAn undoubtedly ambitious retelling of the story that tries to imprint its own tooth on the material, it is more assured in its spectacle than its storytelling, resulting in an entertaining but uneven show where the light outweighs the darkness.\n\nDracula: Mina’s Reckoning is running at the Theatre Royal Glasgow until the 16th September.

Young Pip (Gavin Jon Wright) is now a young Scottish lad encountering Scottish versions of Magwitch (Gerry Mulgrew), Miss Havisham (Karen Dunbar) and, unexpectedly, judgemental cows, on a journey from the Scottish countryside to Glasgow. It’s a journey of great, and sometimes nae, expectations as he meets and helps an escaped convict and a twisted lady & young girl in a decrepit house, three people who will have far-reaching, and often sinister, consequences in his ongoing journey for personal betterment.\n\nDirector Andy Arnold, for whom this is the 40th and final directing turn at the Tron called this story “a wonderful mix of dry and caustic wit combined with tragic events,” a description that not all versions could take, despite Dickens calling the plot himself a “grotesque tragi-comic conception”. However it’s something this adaptation definitely leans into, as you can probably tell from the mention of judgemental cows, and the play makes good use of its set for both comedic and dramatic purposes, with Miss Havisham’s House in particular hitting the right note of ruined grandiosity.\n\nThe show places a great deal on Pip’s shoulders, not only as the lead but with multiple ages from childhood to the age of 30, not to mention changes in status and accent. However Wright, with some nifty blocking, is more than up to the task. The cast also gets their moment to shine, often in multiple roles such as Jamie Marie Leary in the roles of Mrs Joe, Estella, a secretary and several passers-by. Karen Dunbar is excellent as a slightly crasser Miss Havisham; Simon Donaldson gets to be both the emotional core of the show as Joe Gargery and a comic relief as the effete Kevin Pocket; and Grant Smeaton ably threads the needle of making intentionally boring characters humorous as Mr Pumblechook and Jaggers.\n\nAs with any adaptation, changes and compression are inevitable, though big changes are few, except arguably with the character of Estella. One of the biggest is in the ending. Dickens famously struggled with it, making this less a change than a meta tradition, such as what Greta Gerwig did with her adaptation of Little Women (you know, the film in which Ryan Gosling doesn’t sing “I am Meg and I’m enough”).\n\nThe final chapter to Great Expectations Dickens initially wrote, and favoured for not ascribing to traditional tropes, saw an unmarried Pip in London, where he briefly sees Estella, now married for the second time. Following comments by another writer that this was too sad, Dickens rewrote it prior to publication so that Pip meets a widowed Estella in the ruins of Satis House, and they leave together, though he would still try to leave the reader on an ambiguous note, even altering the last line in a later edition to keep their coming together definitely ambiguous. Literary critics remain split as to which ending (both of which have since been published) is better to this day. This version sidesteps the issue, ending slightly earlier and effectively reframing a couple of relationships for its ending, making something that feels right and faithful while being technically different.\n\nThe play is less successful however in some of its more faithful aspects, unfortunately. One of the story’s most famous sequences involves a dramatic death (vague spoilers), a staging challenge at the best of times which this show further disservices by heavily foreshadowing and lampshading to such a degree that even a complete newcomer would get ahead of events.\n\nWriter Gary McNair is well versed with the perils and reputation that come with adapting a classic, having both previously adapted Ben Johnson’s The Alchemist (also directed by Arnold) for the Tron, and having struggled with reading classics for fun in his youth. The result is a faithful but distinctive adaptation which had its audience in stitches while ably hitting the dramatic beats, as well as most of the classic moments from the book, in a good example of both Dickens and Scottish theatre.\n\nNae Expectations is running at the Glasgow Tron Theatre until the 4th November.

It therefore only makes sense that No Spray No Lay is a musical. Written by new writers Kat Dobell and Lara Dunning, who were also creative directors on the project, the show takes place in the ladies bathroom of a night club in 2005. It was intended as an ode to the female experience, with the female toilets creating a micro-society, one notorious for the bonds it creates. And with alcohol known for the drama it can cause (not to mention excusing some first night flubs, such as two characters getting their own names wrong), this club toilet quickly becomes both the eye of the storm and sometimes the storm itself, a centre for all the drama of a young person’s life.\n\nThe young people here are three very different pairs of girls, Crystaal (Abigail Nelson) & Sahara (Hannah Lorimer), Laura (Gemima Iseka-Bekano) & Jane (Ruth Harris) and the two Sweaty Girls (Stacey Scott & Abbie Paterson), each with their own problem around which friendship skirts. One has bad taste in guys, one treats her friend like her minion and the sweaty ones are… living life on the edge of ban from another club, I guess? The result is more scene than plot based, with each sequence built around a song (often with the ensemble Sarah Bradley, Daphne Nelissen and Tiia Kontro) and linked by the toilet attendant, Vicki (Kikelomo Hassan) and the club’s bouncer Deb (Abi Price), who gets the lion’s share (though not the most notable) of the show’s fun use of audience interaction.\n\nThe 2005 setting is mostly apparent from its pop culture, with Myspace, flip phones, digital cameras and David Beckham product placement each dropping in for a bow. The rest is, if not timeless, than immediately recognisable to anyone who has been young in the last four or so decades, with the characters and location being so familiar you can almost smell the alcohol. There is good use made of the space with a few tables (one of which is made into a series of sinks thanks to some metallic bowls) and three toilet cubicles coveted in graffiti (some of it jokes and some of it character relevant). These are further augmented by the flyers plastered on the pillar centre stage which the venue is known for, and the screen upstage, on which is projected extra gags as well as some shots of a few off-stage events.\n\nThe characters are all brought to life clearly and passionately by the cast, and all got their share of laughs from the audience. But, though the vocal performances are uniformly strong, the energy of the performances doesn’t really translate to the choreography of the music, with even the numbers where the extra movement is character relevant not going as far as the other characters’ reactions seem to suggest.\n\nYou sent The creators have expressed their wish to take this to the Fringe and this very much suits the Fringe format with the running time, easily communicated concept, big gags and a cast of characters (and performers) one recognises and are happy to follow for one more night.\n\nNo Spray No Lay is running at St Augustine United Church until the 18th November.
