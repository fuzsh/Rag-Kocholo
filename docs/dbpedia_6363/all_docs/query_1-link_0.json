        "text": "Albert Romolo Broccoli (April 5, 1909 - June 27, 1996) known to millions of movie fans as \"Cubby\" Broccoli (a nickname used by a cousin), produced more than forty movies, but will be remembered by most for his contribution to one of the most successful film franchises in history, James Bond.\n\nLife and Filmography[]\n\nBroccoli was born into an Italian-American family on Long Island. The family moved to Florida, and on the death of his father Giovanni, Broccoli moved to live with his grandmother in Astoria, Queens in New York City.\n\nIn 1940, at the age of 31, Cubby married actress Gloria Blondell (younger sister of Joan Blondell); they later divorced in 1945 without having had children. Having worked many jobs, including casket maker, Broccoli became involved in the film industry. He started at the bottom working as a gofer on the 1941 film The Outlaw. Here he met Howard Hughes, who oversaw production of the movie when director Howard Hawks was fired.\n\nFollowing the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in late 1941, Broccoli joined the United States Navy, returning to Hollywood in 1945 to work as an agent at the Famous Artists Agency.\n\nAt the beginning of the 1950s, Broccoli moved once more, this time to London. A shrewd businessman, he was able to make good use of the subsidy given by the British government to subsidise films made in the UK with British casts and crews. In 1951, Broccoli married Nedra Clark, who died after giving birth to their daughter, Tina.\n\nIn the 1960s, Broccoli met and married actress and novelist, Dana Wilson (n√©e Dana Natol), who died of cancer in 2004 at the age of 82.\n\nIn 1962, Broccoli teamed with Harry Saltzman to create the production company, EON Productions and its parent company Danjaq, LLC. Broccoli produced the first Bond movie, Dr. No, that year, and his involvement in the series continued until his death. His family, particularly daughter Barbara Broccoli and stepson Michael G. Wilson, have since produced the James Bond films.\n\nBesides the Bond movies, Broccoli produced the Dick Van Dyke classic Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, from the book by James Bond author Ian Fleming, and the Bob Hope vehicle Call Me Bwana, the only film made by EON Productions outside of the James Bond franchise.\n\nIn 1981, he was honored with The Irving G. Thalberg Memorial Award for his work in film and has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nBroccoli died at his home in Beverly Hills in 1996 at the age of 87 of natural causes and was interred in Forest Lawn - Hollywood Hills Cemetery in Los Angeles following a Catholic funeral mass, attended by some of the James Bond movies' cast members, such as Desmond Llewelyn, Maryam d'Abo and Timothy Dalton.\n\nBond Filmography[]\n\nYear Title Role Other notes 1962 Dr. No (film) Producer Released 1963 From Russia with Love (film) Producer Released 1964 Goldfinger (film) Producer Released 1965 Thunderball (film) Producer Released 1967 You Only Live Twice (film) Producer Released 1969 On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film) Producer Released 1971 Diamonds Are Forever (film) Producer Released 1973 Live and Let Die (film) Producer Released 1974 The Man with the Golden Gun (film) Producer Released 1977 The Spy Who Loved Me (film) Producer Released 1979 Moonraker (film) Producer Released 1981 For Your Eyes Only (film) Producer Released 1983 Octopussy (film) Producer Released 1985 A View to a Kill (film) Producer Released 1987 The Living Daylights (film) Producer Released 1989 Licence to Kill (film) Producer Released 1995 GoldenEye (film) Producer Released\n\nGallery[]\n\n[]\n\nCubby Broccoli Tribute\n\nCubby's Place: The Man Behind Bond at Freewebs.com at Archive.org"
