        "text": "Summary: James Bond takes on his most daring adventure when he turns renegade and goes head to head with one of the international drug cartel's most brutal and powerful leaders. This time, he's fighting not for contry, not for justice...but for revenge.\n\nReview: For years I thought that Licence to Kill was one of the worst of the series. However, after years of working on this site and further evaluating the Bond movies, I am confident saying that it is actually pretty darned good! To this day I still do not like Lupe or idea of Felix being maimed (it worked for me in the Live and Let Die novel but not on screen), but the rest of the film has grown on me.\n\nIt all starts with the opening sequence where Bond and Felix track Sanchez down and capture him mid-air, all while in their tuxes for Leiters wedding. In the end they get the bad guy and parachute to the church: it doesnt get much more Bondian than that. The rest of the action sequences were classic 007 as well; the underwater/jet skiing battle and the tanker chase are instant classics. While some of these sequences were a bit more violent and grittier than in previous films, it worked because of Timothy Daltons more realistic portrayal of Bond.\n\nAnother main reason that this is a far better movie than it is often given credit for is the huge role of Desmond Llewelyn as Q. For years he had only had a few minutes of screen time per film; now he is a central character who gets down and dirty in the field. Its a pity that it took so many movies before the producers realized that this was exactly what the audience wanted and, by the time GoldenEye was released six years later, Desmond was too fragile to portray such a large role again.\n\nOn the con side of the film, I feel that the Bond Girls are amongst the worst of the series. The Pam Bouvier character tries to be a strong woman, she still is completely at Bonds mercy and doesnt add much to the film or the series. As for Lupe: she may be my least favorite ever! Talisa Sotos acting was atrocious and when she comes to Bonds hotel and tells Pam and Q that she loves Bond so much it seems completely out of left field and unrealistic. Its tough to give a movie 007 stars when the leading ladies are so sub-par.\n\nDespite some other issues with the film (including the whole unnecessary Stinger missile subplot), it still shines through as a beacon of realism and a throwback to Ian Flemings Bond in what had become a comical series during the Roger Moore era. So if you havent watched it in a while, dust off that DVD because Licence to Kill is probably better than you remember."
