        "text": "This analysis predates the COVID-19 crisis and the economic impacts that followed. It is offered as an overview of the Metroplex regional economy and a resource for comparative purposes.\n\nThe 19-county Metroplex region covers about 15,600 square miles in northern Texas, stretching from Oklahoma south to the Brazos River and from the Cedar Creek Reservoir on the east to Possum Kingdom Lake on the west.\n\nThe Metroplex region includes two metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs): the Sherman-Denison MSA, composed of Grayson County, and the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA. The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA, in turn, comprises two Metropolitan Divisions (MDs): the Fort Worth-Arlington MD, which includes Hood, Johnson, Parker, Somervell, Tarrant and Wise counties, and the Dallas-Plano-Irving MD, which includes Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Hunt, Kaufman and Rockwall counties. Counties in the region not associated with an MSA include Cooke, Erath, Fannin, Navarro and Palo Pinto counties. The Metroplex region revolves around the cities of Dallas (Dallas County) and Fort Worth (Tarrant County). Dallas is the third-largest city in Texas; Dallas and Fort Worth are among the nation’s fastest-growing cities.\n\nThis report examines regional economic trends including population, household income, jobs and wages, and education, as well as economic conditions unique to the Metroplex region.\n\nPopulation\n\nThe Metroplex region had an estimated total population of about 8 million in 2019, or about 27.5 percent of the state’s total population. This marked an increase of about 18.5 percent (more than 1.2 million people) since the 2010 Census. Dallas and Tarrant counties, respectively, contained an estimated 33 percent and 26.3 percent of the region’s population. The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA accounted for 94.9 percent of the region’s population and 26.1 percent of the state’s population.\n\nFrom 2010 to 2019, the region’s population grew faster than that of the state as a whole (Exhibit 1), and while the population of each county in the region rose during this period, Collin, Denton, Kaufman and Rockwall counties outpaced all others, each growing by more than 30 percent — twice as fast as the state’s population.\n\nPopulation Composition\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau’s 2018 American Community Survey, the Metroplex region’s median age was on par with that of the state. While 13 of the region’s 19 counties had a median age significantly higher than the state’s median age of 34.2 years in 2018, the region’s most populous counties were on par with the state, and Erath County’s population was one of Texas’ youngest, at a median of 30.2 years. The Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA had a median age on par with that of the state.\n\nNearly 28 percent of the Metroplex region’s total population was Hispanic in 2018 — more than 11 percentage points lower than the state’s total Hispanic share of 38.6 percent (Exhibit 2).\n\nHousehold Income\n\nThe Metroplex region’s median household income was $67,546 in 2018. Texas’ household income is generally distributed among five income levels (Exhibit 3). Of more than 9 million Texas households, 21 percent had incomes of less than $25,000 in 2018, while 17 percent had incomes greater than $125,000. In every region in the state, nearly 18 percent of households had average incomes between $50,000 and $75,000. In the Metroplex region, about 39.5 percent of the region’s households had incomes of less than $50,000, versus about 44 percent for the state.\n\nRegional Industries\n\nIn 2019, the Metroplex region accounted for nearly 30 percent of the state’s total employment, making it the largest employment base in the state. Exhibit 4 lists the industries with the greatest regional employment concentrations compared to the national average, as measured by location quotient (LQ). LQ represents an industry’s proportionate concentration in the region; an LQ greater than 1.0 means that industry employment is more concentrated in the region than nationally. A high LQ can identify industries that have a competitive advantage in the region, such as the ability to produce products more efficiently and of a higher quality.\n\nBased on location quotients, the Metroplex region is a leader in air transportation, oil and gas extraction and banking.\n\nU.S. Military Installation Impact\n\nTexas has 14 U.S. military installations within its borders. In 2019, these bases directly employed more than 226,000 and supported nearly 634,000 jobs in all. They also contributed an estimated $75.3 billion annually to the state’s gross domestic product (GDP). Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth, they only installation within the Metroplex region, supported an estimated 20,000 jobs and contributed about $2.3 billion to the state’s GDP in 2019 (Exhibit 5).\n\nJobs and Wages\n\nFrom 2009 to 2019, Metroplex regional employment rose by more than 25 percent or more than 746,000 jobs (Exhibit 6), higher growth than in the state. Employment in the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington MSA increased by nearly 26 percent and contributed most of the region’s job growth.\n\nSignificant Regional Occupations\n\nThe Metroplex region’s most significant occupations are shown in Exhibits 7 and 8, first by location quotient and second by numeric growth during the last five years.\n\nEducation\n\nA strong educational foundation provides a cornerstone for growth and competitiveness in the global economy, offering opportunities for workplace advancement and business expansion.\n\nWages by Educational Attainment\n\nPost-secondary education delivers a good return on investments of time and tuition. In the Metroplex region, workers with some college or associate degrees and with stable jobs — defined as those employed with the same firm throughout a calendar quarter — earned an average of $5,338 more annually in 2018 than those with high school degrees, while those with at least a bachelor’s degree earned an average of $24,350 more (Exhibit 9).\n\nThe Metroplex region’s high school graduation rate has regularly mirrored the state’s rate. During the 2017-18 school year, 89.6 percent of the region’s public high school senior students graduated, on par with the state’s rate of 90 percent (Exhibit 10).\n\nMany high school graduates enroll in postsecondary programs, which offer greater job prospects and the possibility of higher wages. Residents of the Metroplex region enjoy the state’s largest variety of options for higher educational achievement (Exhibit 11).\n\nThe Metroplex region’s eight community college districts provided technical and academic coursework for about 190,000 students in the 2017-18 school year (Exhibit 12).\n\nIn that year, community colleges in the Metroplex region awarded more than 14,000 certificates and associate degrees in general studies and liberal arts; the next most-common awards were for health professions, business administration and marketing (Exhibit 13).\n\nRegional Economy\n\nThe relative health of the Metroplex region’s economy can be gauged by its sales tax revenue and by comparisons with other areas on education, population, per capita income and unemployment rate. Together, these data are good indicators of the region’s economic dynamics and competitiveness.\n\nSales Tax Revenue\n\nSales taxes are inherently volatile in the short term but when reviewed over time can provide a useful indication of the state’s economic condition.\n\nBetween 2007 and 2019, sales receipts subject to state sales tax directly attributed to the Metroplex region trended upward. The region’s taxable sales climbed significantly following the 2009 recession, and receipts from 2019 indicate that upward climb continued to accelerate (Exhibit 14). For 2019, receipts subject to state sales tax directly attributable to businesses in the Metroplex region exceeded $127 billion, contributing about 23 percent to the state’s overall taxable sales. The Fort Worth-Arlington MD directly accounted for $36.2 billion of this amount, while Dallas-Plano-Irving directly accounted for $86.7 billion.\n\nIn 1997, the U.S., Canada and Mexico jointly released the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS), which classifies all business enterprises for the purpose of collecting, analyzing and publishing economic statistics. A review of two-digit NAICS codes allows for a broad analysis of industry sectors.\n\nIn 2019, the Metroplex region’s retail trade and food services and accommodation sectors contributed most to taxable sales, together accounting for 53.5 percent of the region’s total taxable sales. Also of note were the wholesale trade, construction and manufacturing sectors, which contributed a combined 21 percent of the region’s reported taxable sales.\n\nMetroplex Region vs. the U.S.\n\nExhibit 15 shows how the Metroplex region compares with other states and the nation on a number of demographic and economic measures. The Metroplex region would be the 42nd largest state in terms of land area (sized between West Virginia and Maryland) and have the 13th largest population. The region would have had the 18th highest per capita income in 2018 and the 13th highest share of residents with bachelor’s degrees.\n\nMetroplex Regional Summary\n\nThe Metroplex region is a microcosm of the state, both urban and rural, with a vibrant and diverse economy. Tarrant County, with the city of Fort Worth at its center, and Dallas County, anchored by Dallas, are the region’s twin economic cores.\n\nThe Metroplex region and its 19 counties have many unique economic conditions and challenges. If the region were a state, it would be the 13th most populous, similar in population to Washington state. The region’s high school graduation rate mirrors the state’s rate, and it offers many options for higher educational achievement, with 19 universities and two health science schools.\n\nThe regional economy is strong and accounts for about 23 percent of the state’s overall taxable sales. From 2009 to 2019, the region saw a higher rate of job growth than the state. The Metroplex region’s concentration of high-paying, high-growth industries (including air transportation, money and banking and technology) make its economy distinctive.\n\nQuestions?"
