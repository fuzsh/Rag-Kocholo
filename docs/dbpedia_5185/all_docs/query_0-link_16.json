        "text": "Addison Robertson (Addison, Texas) was the first postmaster of Addison, Texas. He was born in Arkansas in 1838. Robertson came to Texas after the Civil War and moved to Dallas County around 1875. He served as justice of the peace and later postmaster. Despite his age, he volunteered to serve in World War I. He was accepted into the Secret Service and served in that capacity during the conflict. After he died in 1927, he was buried in the old Frankford Cemetery.\n\nWilliam C. C. Akard (Akard Street, Bowen Street, William Street, Porter Street, Cole Avenue) was born in North Carolina in 1826. He moved to Missouri where he married Sara Bowen. The Bowens along with Sara and William then moved to Arkansas, then Collin County, then finally to Dallas in 1865. Bowen Street, in Upper Dallas, is named for Akard’s father in law Ahab Bowen. Akard owned a store in Dallas, but died in 1870 at the young age of 44 on a buying trip to Calvert, Texas to purchase goods for his store. Several other streets were named for Akard’s children: William Street for son William, Porter Street for son Porter and Cole Avenue for son Coleman. The complete article on William C. C. Akard begins on page 1 of Proud Heritage, Volume II.\n\nArdelia Ellen Jackson West (Audelia Road) was the second child and first daughter of James Everts Jackson and Diana Jane Davis Jackson. She was born April 17, 1853 and died February 24, 1899. Ardelia was the wife of John Frederick West who owned a store at the corner of Audelia and Forest Lane. Audelia Road is named for her. A community called Audelia once existed but was absorbed into Dallas. Audelia is a modification of her name, which was Ardelia. The complete article on the family of James Everts and Diana Jane Davis Jackson begins on page 113 of Proud Heritage, Volume I.\n\nJohn Branaman Bachman (Bachman Lake) had been born in Tennessee in 1821. He married Margaret Morris Hughes and they came to Dallas County around 1854, settling near a water source called Browning’s Branch, part of the Trinity River system. John Bachman, his brother William and their families farmed the area which is now part of Northwest Dallas. John Bachman died in 1876 and was buried in Cochran Chapel Cemetery. Browning’s Branch was later renamed Bachman’s Branch in honor of the family. A dam was built in 1903 to form Bachman Lake, originally to provide a water source for the City of Dallas. It proved to be inadequate for that purpose, and the City’s focus was changed to the creation of White Rock Lake, but Bachman Lake remains as a recreation area. The complete article on the descendants of John and Margaret Bachman begins on page 5 of Proud Heritage, Volume I (no longer in print).\n\nSterling Rex Barnes (Barnes Bridge, Barnes Bridge Road) was born in Virginia in 1799. He married Martha Ann Mitchell in 1825 in Alabama. The couple moved again to Mississippi where they lived a number of years before moving to the Three Forks area of the Trinity River. Barnes is credited for having built a toll bridge at what was formerly known as the East Fork Crossing, part of a Texas Military Road that ran from Austin to the Red River. For many years, there was a ferry operation at that location. It was later known as McKenzie’s Crossing and Goodman’s Crossing. In 1854, Barnes bought out Goodman and built the toll bridge that became known as Barnes Bridge. Rex and Martha eventually passed and operation of the bridge fell to their children until around 1880 when it was acquired by Rockwall County. The bridge continued to be operated and maintained by Rockwall County until 1969 when the location was covered by Lake Ray Hubbard. Some of Barnes Bridge Road is still so named in Dallas County. In Rockwall County, Barnes Bridge Road still exists and dead ends within a few hundred feet of Lake Ray Hubbard.\n\nJudge John Bookhout (Bookhout Street) was a judge in Dallas for fifteen years. Prior to that, he was engaged in the practice of law. He came to Texas in 1872, was later admitted to the Texas bar before settling in Dallas around 1897. He served as an Associate Justice of the Court of Appeals before retiring due to ill health. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Dallas.\n\nJohn Neely Bryan (Bryan Street) is widely credited as being the founder of Dallas. He came to the area just after 1840, platted what became downtown, originally owned much of the land there. He operated a ferry across the Trinity River and was active in civic affairs. Bryan married Margaret Beeman, the daughter of another well known pioneer family. The actual location of Bryan’s remains are unknown, but there is a centotaph memorial in his honor at Pioneer Cemetery in downtown Dallas.\n\nRobert Cooke Buckner (Buckner Blvd, Buckner Park, Buckner Masonic Lodge, Buckner Orphan’s Home, Buckner retirement village) was an early resident of Dallas. Born in Tennessee in 1833, he came to Texas around 1861 and Dallas County some years after that. Founded Buckner Orphan’s Home, was an organizer of Texas Memorial Baptist Sanitarium (Baylor Hospital). He is buried at Grove Hill Cemetery.\n\nFrançois Marie Cantagrel (Cantegral Street) was the first director of the La Reunion community, which was an experimental socialist community located south and west of the Trinity River across from what was then the small town of Dallas. Cantagrel (also spelled Cantegral) was a close associate of Victor P. Considerant, the primary organizer of the colony which existed for two to three years in the mid to late 1850s. Cantegral Street as it now remains, is only four to five blocks long and runs from Bryan Street to Gaston Avenue just northeast of downtown. Other cross streets are Live Oak, Florence and Swiss Avenue.\n\nHenry William Coit (Coit Road) was an early resident of Dallas County. His father, John Taylor Coit came to Texas in 1858 looking for a place to settle. He acquired land in upper Dallas County. He was a lawyer and practiced law in Dallas and the family eventually moved to Dallas. John Taylor Coit died in 1872. His son, Henry William Coit took over his farm. The naming of Coit Road and how it came to be is as follows, as related by Nancy Lennon in Proud Heritage Vol. I, “In the mid-1920’s the County Commissioner for the district, J. W. Slaughter, promised Henry Coit he would build an airline road from Renner to Dallas if Coit would get the landowners along rights of way. He did so; the road was soon completed from Renner to Mockingbird Lane. It saved a lot of people many miles. Slaughter named it “Coit Road”. Later, Central Expressway was built over it from Forest Lane south.”\n\nJohn H. Cole (Cole Avenue) was a medical doctor and pioneer of Dallas County. He was born in Virginia in 1795 and was a veteran of the War of 1812. He married the former Polly McDonald. After first living in Tennessee and then in Arkansas, the family moved to Texas, initially settling in Crawford and later Washington County before relocating to what became Dallas County while it was still part of Nacogdoches County. The family settled in Cedar Springs where Dr. Cole farmed and set up his medical practice. He died in 1850 and his wife followed him in death in 1869. Both are buried in Greenwood Cemetery.\n\nHoward William Cox (Cox Lane and Cox historic home) came to Texas in 1856 with his family. He was married to Mary Jane Webb in 1862. They operated farms in North Texas, finally settling in what is now North Dallas. In the mid to late 1880s, they began to build the family residence. Since then, it has been expanded numerous times but still sits on Cox Lane. Two sons, Isaac Howard Cox and Joe Cox operated a dairy for many years before the property began to be developed for residential homes. Howard William Cox and Mary Jane Webb Cox are both buried in Webb Chapel Cemetery.\n\nAllanson D. Dawdy (Dowdy Ferry Road, Dawdy Ferry) was one of the first settlers in Dallas County, settling here after his service in the Mexican-American war. He established his family and ran a ferry across the Trinity River called Dawdy’s Ferry. At some point the spelling of Dawdy was altered to Dowdy for purposes of naming roads, etc., but the original family spelling is Dawdy. His first name may also appear in genealogy records as Alanson. Allanson Dawdy died in 1901 and is buried in the Hutchins Cemetery.\n\nSimon David (Simon David Grocery Stores). Simon David was a pioneer Texas grocer, born in Germany in 1842. In 1889, Simon David opened his store on Leonard Street near downtown. The store became known for carrying kosher food and other specialty items that often could not easily be found elsewhere. Simon David died in 1915 and was succeeded by his son Delmer David (1889-1960) who expanded the business and opened a store located at 4311 Oak Lawn. Delmer also expanded the business to include a wholesale operation. Another (and now the current) location on Inwood Road in Dallas was opened in 1961. Delmer David was succeeded by his son Stanley David (1919-1974). In 1963, the business was sold to the Tom Thumb chain. There have been numerous corporate changes since the sale, but the Inwood Road store still retains the name of founder Simon David. Simon, Delmer and Stanley David are all interred at Emanu-El Cemetery in Dallas County, Texas.\n\nHenry S. Ervay (Ervay Street), lived from 1834 to 1911 and was a former mayor of Dallas. He was once jailed by Reconstruction Governor Edmund J. Davis because he did not fit the profile of Davis’ preferred leaders. Ervay ran the city from the jail and after a few days, he was reinstated by the Texas Supreme Court which ruled that Davis did not have the authority to remove a sitting mayor. Ervay served during the arrival of the railroads and other key events. Eventually took up mining. Died in California.\n\nLafayette Henry Fitzhugh (Fitzhugh Avenue) was an investor and board member in various railroad companies including the Chicago, Texas and Mexican Central Railway, a narrow gauge line which operated under that name for only a couple of years, from 1880 to 1882 before being acquired by another railway company that converted it to standard gauge. In Austin, he owned a hotel called the Fitzhugh House that was near the Houston and Texas Railroad terminus. He also owned a home and acreage in East Dallas. Ironically, L. H. Fitzhugh (1830-1905) died on a train while in route to a home for disabled veterans in Ohio. His remains were returned to Dallas where he was interred in Greenwood Cemetery. We also learned that there is support for the street having been named for his son, Judge L. H. Fitzhugh, Jr. (1858-1938), and will keep researching the matter. Judge Fitzhugh is buried at Oakland Cemetery. A descendant of the Fitzhugh family offers this explanation, “Fitzhugh Ave. was named that because it was the road to the family farm. Three different Fitzhugh families lived there.”\n\nGeneral Richard Montgomery Gano (Gano Street) came to Texas before the Civil War first settling in Tarrant County and coming to Dallas County after the conflict. During his career, he practiced as a medical doctor, served as a minister and also was a stockman, farmer and banker. He was born in Bourbon County, Kentucky in 1830 and died in Dallas County in 1913. He is buried in Oakland Cemetery in Dallas.\n\nWilliam Henry Gaston (Gaston Avenue, W. H. Gaston Junior High School) was born in Alabama in 1840. Prior to the Civil War, his family moved to Anderson County in Texas. W. H. Gaston joined the Confederate Army at the beginning of the war and was elected captain the First Texas Infantry Regiment of Hood’s Texas Brigade in 1861. After contracting and recovering from typhoid fever he was transferred back to Texas where he served in various capacities with the Confederate Army until the end of the war. He married the former Jane Laura Furlow and the couple had three children. His wife, Jane Laura, died in 1867 and he married her sister Ione while managing the family farm in Anderson County. William and Ione had four more children. The couple relocated to Dallas where William went into the banking business, real estate and other enterprises. Two of his banking companies went on to become the First National Bank in Dallas and Republic National Bank, respectively. Gaston was credited for helping bring the railroads to Dallas, developing the streetcar system and in 1886, he donated eighty acres to form the State Fair of Texas. He passed away in 1927 and is buried in Greenwood Cemetery, north of downtown.\n\nJohn Jay Good (Good Street, now Good Latimer Expressway) was born in 1827. He moved to Dallas County in 1851. Served in the Civil War, elected as the 18th mayor of Dallas, practiced law in Dallas County, was a judge before and after the war. He was a member of the Knights Templar, the Tannehill Masonic Lodge, the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. He was a member of the Dallas Fire Department and was elected president of that organization in 1878. He died in El Paso in 1882, reportedly on his way to California for his health.\n\nJohn Grigsby (Grigsby Avenue) is the namesake for the street which now runs on a southwesterly direction between Ross Avenue and Gaston Avenue. It appears to be the remaining Dallas street or landmark named for John Grigsby (1787-1841) out of a 4,605 acre plot of land grant perfected posthumously to Grigsby’s heirs by Sam Houston in 1842. Grigsby’s grant and that of John Neely Bryan made up much of early Dallas. A family genealogy summary called “Early Texas Grigsbys” says, “Our Grigsby ancestors came to Texas from Illinois in 1834 following the promise of abundant land for farming, game and fish for food, timber for housing and fuel. They probably came with covered wagons drawn by teams of horses, mules, or oxen. The head of the family, John Grigsby (ca. 1787-1841), and his second wife, Elizbeth Louisa, joined the Pilgrim Predestinarian Church in Houston (now Anderson) County in 1836, and he served as clerk for many of the subsequent meetings of the congregation. His large land grant in what is now downtown Dallas was issued in 1838 and patented in 1842 (after Grigsby’s death) by Sam Houston.” John Grigsby himself never resided in Dallas, since he had died just before the land grant was patented. He lost his life as a result of falling overboard while floating a shipment of cotton down the Trinity River.\n\nHoratio Nelson Haskell (Haskell Avenue) was born in Kentucky in 1825 and moved to Texas in 1844 after the death of both his parents. He first resided in far south Texas near the mouth of the Rio Grande. He joined the United States Army during the Mexican-American War, taking part in battles from Cerro Gordo to Mexico City. After being honorably discharged at Vera Cruz, he returned to Brownsville, Texas and later to Corpus Christi and San Antonio. At some point he reenlisted in the Army and fought in Indian wars all the way to Utah. He joined the Confederate Army during the Civil War, after which he settled on 33 1/3 acres in Dallas where he resided until his death in 1903. His burial place is unknown. As an aside, a newspaper article in the Wise County Messenger of Decatur, Texas described an incident that occurred in 1898 in which Horatio met his long lost brother, Horace H. Haskell at the Texas State Fair. Horace had initially settled on the Pacific Coast, but had read his brother’s name in the newspaper while he was in Houston and came to Dallas to reunite with him. The brothers had not seen one another for 44 years.\n\nGeorge Washington “Uncle Peahull” Ledbetter (Ledbetter Drive) was born at Cockrell Hill in 1859 and died in 1933. G. W. was a co-owner of a thresher and engine. He and his brother Arthur Leonard Ledbetter contracted to do virtually all of the threshing in southwestern Dallas County. Uncle Peahull was a Commissioner of Dallas County for 8 terms, 1916-1933, and Ledbetter Drive is named for Uncle Peahull Ledbetter.\n\nPatrick Henry Lively (Lively Lane, Coppedge Lane, Woodfin Drive) came to Texas in 1853. Their second farm was 640 acres roughly bounded by Northwest Highway, Inwood Road, Midway Road and Park Lane. Typical of other developments when streets were platted they took often the names of the family members. Coppedge and Woodfin were family names of Lively descendants and spouses.\n\nMarvin Dan Love (Marvin D. Love Freeway – Highway 67 from the I-35 split to I-20) was a native Texan, born July 16, 1894 in Bell County. His father died when he was five years old and he lived with his mother for a number of years. Marvin served in the United States Navy in World War I. By 1920, Love was residing in Dallas where he would live for the rest of his life. Love was the manager of the Oak Cliff office of Dallas Power & Light Company at the time of his death in January, 1964. The Oak Cliff office of DP&L was a storefront building on West Jefferson where customers could pay their electric bills and see electric appliances on display. He was regarded as an outstanding civic leader in Oak Cliff and served as a deacon in Cliff Temple Baptist Church. Love had also served as chairman of the Dallas Chamber of Commerce central highway committee and was also vice-president for streets and highways in the Oak Cliff Chamber of Commerce. In June, 1964 the Dallas County Commissioners Court honored him by naming a section of U. S. Highway 67 “Marvin D. Love Freeway.” The honor was due to Love’s work to improve streets and highways within Dallas County.\n\nMarvin Ezra Loving (Marvin Loving Drive) was a grandson of James Loving (1811-1869), and the son of William Bourland Loving (1850-1936). Marvin was born and died in Dallas County.

He became a merchant and served in the Kentucky legislature. At the outset of the Mexican-American War, he organized a company of soldiers that became part of Gallitin’s Rangers, 1st Kentucky Volunteers. He brought his family to Dallas in 1855 and bought land north of downtown for a farm. In time, this area briefly became the town of East Dallas before it was annexed into the City of Dallas in 1890. His former farm became Peak’s Suburban Addition. Peak is buried in the Pioneer Cemetery, Masonic Section, Dallas, Texas. Dallas area residents will recognize that many East Dallas street names are named for Peak children and their spouses. Some of them are Peak Street, Junius Street, Worth Street, Carroll Avenue, Flora Street, Victor Street, Juliette Fowler Street (now Munger Street), Wallace Street (now Gaston Avenue), Harwood Street (for the husband of Sarah) and Field Street (for the husband of Flora).
