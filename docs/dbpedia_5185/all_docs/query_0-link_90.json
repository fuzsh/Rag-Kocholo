        "text": "Amanda Thrash serves as president of Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Allen, joining the leadership team there in July 2022.\n\nMost recently, Thrash served as vice president, professional and support services, at Texas Health Plano. Her tenure with Texas Health extends much further, though.\n\nShe started at Texas Health Dallas as an administrative resident in 2009, moving to Texas Health Presbyterian Plano in 2010. She became administrator of Texas Health Neighborhood Care & Wellness Prosper in 2016, serving in that role for two years.\n\nDuring the four years prior to joining Texas Health Allen, Thrash led multiple strategic growth initiatives at Texas Health Plano, including advancement of EMS Outreach strategy, resulting in significant growth in EMS traffic; and perioperative quality and efficiency initiatives, resulting in growth of the cardiovascular surgery and robotic surgery service lines.\n\nIn her spare time, Thrash enjoys spending time with her husband, Bucky, and their young son, Beau. They love cheering on the TCU Horned Frogs during football season and entertaining friends in their home.\n\nKari McCord, M.S.N., RNC-OB, C-EFM, NE-BC, serves as the chief nursing officer at Texas Health Allen.\n\nMcCord works closely with Amanda Thrash, president, and Robert Schwab, M.D., chief quality and medical officer, to develop and oversee the implementation of policies, procedures and practices to support the provision of safe, quality patient care. She is responsible for the management of nursing practice, nursing education, professional development, nursing research and nursing administration.\n\nShe first joined Texas Health Resources as a staff nurse at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas in 2005. She left Texas Health Dallas in 2012 for a job elsewhere and returned to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Plano in 2019 as director of Women’s, Infants’ and Children’s Services. She was promoted to associate chief nursing officer there in 2021 and moved to her current role at Texas Health Allen in September 2023.\n\nMcCord earned an associate degree in nursing from Dallas County Community College, and bachelor’s and master’s degrees in nursing from Grand Canyon University in Phoenix. She is a graduate of the American Organization for Nursing Leadership Fellowship and the SMU Executive Fellowship. She was named a DFW Great 100 Nurse in 2020.\n\nMcCord and her husband have a son, Cayden, and daughter, Kendall. When not at work, she and her husband enjoy traveling to watch their daughter play competitive soccer and vacationing in Belize.\n\nRobert Schwab, M.D., serves as chief quality and medical officer of Texas Health Allen.\n\nIn his role as chief medical officer, Schwab works closely with hospital and medical staff leadership to promote safety and clinical excellence in patient care. During his tenure at Texas Health Allen, the hospital was awarded an “A” rating for safety from the The Leapfrog Group, recognized as a top performer on key quality measures by The Joint Commission and improved physician engagement and partnership.\n\nSchwab, who previously served as chief medical officer at Texas Health Denton, came to North Texas in 2010 from St. Luke’s Hospital in Kansas City, Mo., where he served as patient safety officer as well as a palliative medicine physician. He had previously served as professor and chair of the Department of Emergency Medicine and professor of Medical Humanities at the University of Missouri-Kansas City School of Medicine.\n\nHe graduated with high distinction from the University of Virginia College of Arts and Sciences and received his medical degree from the University of Virginia School of Medicine. Schwab completed his residency in Emergency Medicine at Truman Medical Center in Kansas City and also completed a fellowship in Patient Safety in 2007-2008. He is board-certified in Emergency Medicine and received his certification as a Physician Executive from the American Association for Physician Leadership in 2016.\n\nIn addition to his role at Texas Health Allen, Schwab teaches an undergraduate premedical course at The University of Texas at Dallas. He also continues to speak nationally about the primary role of humanism in medical practice, and the role of art and the humanities in the development of health care professionals.\n\nIn his free time, Schwab has published two novels and fronts a cover band that plays events and venues throughout the Metroplex. He enjoys golf, and spending time with his wife, Cathy, his two adult children, Tyler and Emily, and the masters of his home, his two cats, Soxy and Jester."
