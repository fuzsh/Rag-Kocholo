        "text": "In Texas, employers can use a range of screening options to learn more about a candidate’s background, from their criminal history to their past employment. Though Texas doesn’t have statewide fair hiring restrictions, following federal guidelines and best practices can help you get the information you need while maintaining a fair and compliant hiring process. Read on for more about employer background checks in the state of Texas.\n\nAs an employer, you may find background checks helpful to verify information and gain insight into a candidate’s criminal, credit, and employment histories. In this article, we’ll look at the types of background checks employers typically conduct in Texas: what they show, how far back they go, and how long they might take. We’ll also dig into fair hiring laws and practices that can affect how you run background checks.\n\nEmployers may conduct a variety of checks as part of their screening process for new hires or candidates for promotion. Background checks can help verify the information in a candidate’s educational and work history. They can also screen a candidate’s criminal record, driving record, or credit history. Checking a candidate’s background can also provide insight into whether or not they pose a risk to safety, particularly in jobs where they manage people, drive vehicles or operate machinery, handle finances, work with children, or interact with the public.\n\nWhat Is A Texas Background Check?\n\nA Texas background check gathers information from public records to provide employers with insight into a candidate’s qualifications and eligibility for a role. Employers in Texas may require background checks for certain jobs, such as fingerprint-based criminal background checks for public school employees and Texas Department of Family and Protective Services workers and volunteers. These screenings help ensure the safety and security of children and vulnerable Texans.\n\nEmployers may also choose to use background screenings to evaluate candidates during the hiring process. Background checks examine a candidate’s history to verify qualifications and determine overall fitness for a position. Common employment background checks in Texas may include:\n\nCriminal background checks to search national, federal, state, and county records for a candidate’s criminal history including misdemeanor and felony convictions. These may be critical for positions involving children, elderly, disabled people or sensitive information.\n\nCivil court checks to look for lawsuits, foreclosures, restraining orders, and other civil matters which may be relevant information when hiring for financial and management roles.\n\nEmployment verifications to confirm the accuracy of a candidate’s work history, positions held, and dates of employment.\n\nEducation verifications to validate academic credentials like schools attended, years enrolled, and any degrees earned.\n\nDriving record checks to review motor vehicle records for license status and type, moving violations, and convictions such as DUIs. These checks are often used for roles involving driving.\n\nCredit checks to show a candidate’s credit history including bankruptcies, payment history, and outstanding debts which may be relevant information when hiring for financial positions.\n\nChoosing the appropriate background checks in Texas for a given role can help protect your business, employees, and customers while finding the most qualified candidates.\n\nWhat Does A Background Check Show In Texas?\n\nWhat you see in a candidate’s Texas background check may depend, in part, on whether you search criminal records yourself or use a consumer report agency (CRA) to obtain reports. Typically, either will show offense information and court records, along with the date of the offense, date of disposition, and prison time or probation, if any. Additionally, some CRAs will report arrests or acquittals. In an effort to support fair chance hiring and reduce unconscious bias, GoodHire excludes arrests and non-convictions from our criminal background check results.\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety (TXDPS) manages criminal background checks in Texas, including fingerprint-based checks through the FACT Clearinghouse. TXDPS also operates the state’s Computerized Criminal History (CCH) system, which acts as a statewide repository for criminal history record information reported by local criminal justice agencies.\n\nIn addition to running state and county criminal background searches within the state of Texas, you may also want to search nationwide and federal databases to view a candidate’s criminal history in state and county records nationwide, or to look for a history of federal crimes.\n\nCriminal records of minors (juvenile records) are usually sealed when they turn 18 years old as long as they don’t have felony convictions or pending charges. By Texas law, a candidate does not have to disclose a conviction that has been sealed or expunged by court order. If you encounter sealed or expunged records while doing an employment background check in Texas, you should not use this information when considering a candidate for a job.\n\nHow Far Back Does A Background Check Go In Texas?\n\nWhen conducted by a CRA, the scope of a background check is limited to a specified timeframe based on the type of search. The standard for employment-related background checks in Texas is seven years, except for criminal convictions, which may be reported indefinitely. The seven-year limit applies to tax liens, suits or judgments, and most credit history. Records of bankruptcies may go back as far as 10 years. Texas companies that employ in-home repair people and delivery drivers who enter people’s homes must conduct felony criminal background checks going back 20 years and misdemeanor checks going back 10 years on prospective employees before they are hired.\n\nEmployers may extend the look-back on non-criminal records if the candidate is applying for a job with a salary of more than $75,000. In this case, records may be searched going back as far as the candidate’s 18th birthday.\n\nTexas motor vehicle record (MVR) reports generally go back three years.\n\nEmployers conducting their own criminal records search (e.g., not using a CRA) are not limited by the seven year scope.\n\nFinally, there are no time restrictions for looking into employment and education history information in Texas.\n\nHow Long Does A Background Check Take In Texas?\n\nA state criminal background check in Texas typically takes one to three business days to process. County checks vary by jurisdiction and may take longer if, for instance, records are not digitized and must be searched or verified manually. Civil court searches in most Texas counties average seven to 10 business days. Motor vehicle records are usually available within one business day. Turnaround on employment and education verifications can vary widely, with one to five business days serving as the normal range.\n\nDigital access to records greatly reduces turnaround time. When records are not digitized, the speed at which you receive results will be slower as you or a court runner must visit the courthouse to conduct a search. Additionally, working directly with government agencies by mail can add considerable delay. Receiving a motor vehicle report by mail, for example, takes three weeks after a request is received.\n\nEfficiency is a good reason to use online resources or work through a qualified consumer reporting agency, like GoodHire, to quickly gain access to millions of records in public and proprietary databases, reducing your turnaround times on common background checks.\n\nTexas Background Check Laws\n\nAlthough there are no specific Texas background check laws restricting the use of criminal history when making employment decisions, federal fair hiring guidelines still apply. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), employers must notify candidates in writing and obtain their consent before conducting criminal background checks in Texas. If the information found in a criminal background check causes you to take adverse action, such as rescinding a job offer, you must provide the candidate with a pre-adverse action notice (including a copy of the background check report) and wait five business days before taking final adverse action.\n\nAs of December 2021, federal ban-the-box restrictions prevent federal agencies and federal contractors from inquiring about a candidate’s criminal history prior to making a conditional offer of employment, unless the job involves national security, classified information, or is subject to another law requiring early screening.\n\nFurther, some counties and cities in Texas have enacted their own ban-the-box restrictions, as listed in the county resources below. Employers conducting background checks in Texas across local jurisdictions should comply with laws in both their own city and county and the city and county where the candidate lives. When in doubt, employers may wish to comply with the strictest laws to avoid potential liability.\n\nCounty Resources\n\nThe following resources can help you learn more about obtaining background check information in some of the largest counties in Texas.\n\nBell County\n\nLocated in central Texas, Bell County is a short drive to Austin, Dallas, Houston, and Waco.
