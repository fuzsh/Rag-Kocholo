        "text": "City in Texas, United States\n\nGarland is a city in the U.S. state of Texas, located within Dallas County with portions extending into Collin and Rockwall counties. It is located northeast of Dallas and is a part of the Dallasâ€“Fort Worth metroplex. In 2020, it had a population of 246,018, making it the 93rd-most populous city in the United States and the 13th-most populous city in Texas. Garland is the third largest city in Dallas County by population and has access to downtown Dallas via public transportation including two DART Blue Line stations and buses.\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nSee also: Timeline of Garland, Texas\n\nImmigrants began arriving in the Peters colony area around 1850, but a community was not created until 1874. Two communities sprang up in the area: Embree, named for physician K. H. Embree, and Duck Creek, named for the local creek of the same name. A rivalry between the two towns ensued as the area began to grow around the Santa Fe Railroad depot.\n\nEventually, to settle a dispute regarding which town should have the local post office, Dallas County Judge Thomas A. Nash asked visiting Congressman Joe Abbott to move the post office between the two towns. The move was completed in 1887. The new location was named Garland after U.S. Attorney General Augustus Hill Garland.\n\nSoon after, the towns of Embree and Duck Creek were combined, and the three areas combined to form the city of Garland, which was incorporated in 1891. By 1904, the town had a population of 819 people.[2]\n\nIn 1920, local businessmen financed a new electrical generator plant (sold by Fairbanks-Morse) for the town. This later led to the formation of Garland Power and Light, the municipal electric provider that still powers the city today.[2][6]\n\nOn May 9, 1927, a devastating F4 tornado struck the town and killed 15 people,[7] including the former mayor, S. E. Nicholson.\n\nBusinesses began to move back into the area in the late 1930s. The Craddock food company and later the Byer-Rolnick hat factory (now owned by Resistol) moved into the area. In 1937, KRLD, a major Dallas radio station, built its radio antenna tower in Garland, and it is operational to this day.\n\nDuring World War II, several aircraft plants were operated in the area, and the Kraft Foods company purchased a vacant one after the war for its own use. By 1950, the population of Garland exceeded 10,000 people.[2] From 1950 to 1954, though, the Dallas/Garland area suffered from a serious and extended drought, so to supplement the water provided by wells, Garland began using the water from the nearby Lake Lavon.\n\nThe suburban population boom that the whole country experienced after World War II also reached Garland by 1960, when the population nearly quadrupled from the 1950 figure to about 38,500. By 1970, the population had doubled to about 81,500. By 1980, the population reached 138,850.[2] Charles R. Matthews served as mayor in the 1980s; he was later a member of the elected Texas Railroad Commission.\n\nIn the 2000s, Garland added several notable developments, mostly in the northern portion of the city. Hawaiian Falls waterpark opened in 2003. (Garland formerly had a Wet 'n Wild waterpark, which closed in 1993). The Garland Independent School District's Curtis Culwell Center (formerly called the Special Events Center),[8] an arena and conference facility, opened in 2005. Later that year, Firewheel Town Center, a Main Street-style outdoor mall, owned by Simon Property Group, opened in October 2005.\n\nIt has over 100 business and includes an AMC theater. In 2009, the city, in conjunction with developer Trammell Crow Company, finished a public/private partnership to develop the old parking lot (the land between 5th Street, 6th Street, and on the north side of Austin Street) into a new mixed-use, transit-oriented development named 5th Street Crossing. Cater-corner to both City Hall and the downtown DART Rail station, the project consists of 189 residential apartment units, 11,000 square feet (1,000 m2) of flex retail, and six live-work units.[9]\n\nThe southeast side of Garland suffered a major blow on the night of December 26, 2015, after a large EF4 tornado struck the area, moving north from Sunnyvale. Nine fatalities were confirmed in the city from this event.[10]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nGarland is located at (32.907325, â€“96.635197).[11] According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 57.1 sq mi (147.9 km2), all land.\n\nNeighborhoods and historical communities\n\n[edit]\n\nBuckingham North\n\nDuck Creek\n\nCenterville\n\nClub Hill\n\nEastern Hills\n\nEmbree\n\nFirewheel\n\nOaks\n\nRose Hill\n\nSpring Park\n\nTravis College Hill Addition[12]\n\nValley Creek*\n\nThe 5\n\nOakridge\n\nBrentwood Place\n\nBrentwood Village\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nGarland is part of the humid subtropical region.

In 1937, the KRLD (Dallas) radio tower was constructed in Garland. During World War II, several aircraft plants operated in the Garland area. After the war, Kraft Foods bought the Continental Motors Plant to retool for its manufacture. The Kraft plant still operates to this day. As a station on two railroads, Garland was a major onion-shipping point in the 1940s.[2]\n\nResistol Hats in Garland is a notable manufacturer of premium hats, many of which have been worn by or given to notable figures around the world. The company has long been an important part of Garland's manufacturing base.[30] The company was founded by E.R. Byer and Harry Rolnick, who established Byer-Rolnick in Dallas in 1927. At the time, the company produced men's felt hats. The company used the name \"Resistol Hats\" to indicate that the hats could \"resist-all\" weather conditions. Some accounts contend the name was given because the headbands in the company's hats were more resistant to scalp oil.[31] The growing firm needed to expand. In 1938, it moved to a larger facility in Garland, where Resistol hats continue to be manufactured today. For decades, residents surrounding the hat factory could set their clocks to its whistle.[31]\n\nIn the early 1980s, Garland had one of the lowest poverty rates of cities in the country. In 1990, it had a population of 180,650 and 2,227 businesses, making it Dallas County's second-largest city and the 10th-largest in the state. Today, Garland had a variety of industries, including electronics, steel fabrication, oilfield equipment, aluminum die casting, hat manufacture, dairy products, and food processors.[2]\n\nWingstop was founded here\n\nTop employers\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the City of Garland's Economic Development Partnership website,[32] the top employers in the city are:\n\n# Employer Employees 1 Garland Independent School District 7,425 2 City of Garland 2,000 3 Kraft Foods 796 4 US Food Service 520 5 Epiroc Drilling Solutions 460 6 SilverLine Window 425 7 Hatco (Resistol) 390 8 L3-Communication 350 9 Arrow Fabricated Tubing 340 10 Valspar 300\n\nGarland has seen many of their major employers replaced over the last few years leading to multiple redevelopment projects. A prior Raytheon campus was demolished and rebuilt into three new industrial buildings housing new companies such as Lexor, Ecolab, Apple, and Quest Windows. The large Sears distribution building was renovated and is currently being utilized by Costco wholesale. The Baylor Scott and White hospital has become a new VA Medical Center and the City of Garland has announced an ambitious streetscapes masterplan for the surrounding medical district with the goal of attracting a new community hospital provider.\n\nArts and culture\n\n[edit]\n\nGarland is home to numerous historic and recent entertainment venues.\n\nEntertainment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe Granville Arts Center is a complex owned and operated by the city. Included within the complex are two elegant proscenium theatres which seat 720 and 200, respectively. Also included as part of the complex is the Plaza Theatre, which has seating for 350. The Plaza Theatre is a historic entertainment venue.[33] The Plaza Theatre was refurbished and is utilized for business conferences, concerts, receptions, and stage productions. It is also host to paintings by artist Bruce Cody.[34] The Atrium at the Granville Arts Center is a 6,500-square-foot (600 m2) ballroom encased in glass on two sides and opening onto an elegant outdoor courtyard. The Atrium provides civic, community and commercial organizations the opportunity to house banquets, receptions, trade shows, and conventions.[35]\n\nLandmarks\n\n[edit]\n\nGarland is home to the Pace House,[36] which was the original home of John H. Pace and his wife; it was built in the Queen Anne-style architecture. The Pace House was recognized as a historic landmark by the Dallas County Historic Resource Survey of 1982.[37][38]\n\nOther historic areas of the city include the Garland Landmark Museum, housed in the former 1901 Santa Fe depot. Inside are historical artifacts and documents representing the period from 1850 to the present.[39] Historic Downtown Garland is another local landmark. Historic Downtown Garland was listed in the National Register of Historic Places in 2017.[40]\n\nTravis College Hill Historic District, a residential neighborhood in downtown Garland, was the first site in Garland history to be added to the National Register of Historic Places, administered by the U.S. Department of the Interior through its National Park Service. Two months later, the downtown square and surrounding buildings became the second site in Garland added to the listing. Travis College Hill consists of 12 homes whose period of significance is 1913 to 1960. Travis College Hill was platted in January 1913 by developer R.O. Travis.[41]\n\nOn May 9, 1927, a tornado destroyed much of the city and killed 17 people, including a former mayor, S. E. Nicholson. Six years later, the Nicholson Memorial Library opened in his honor.[2]\n\nThe Nicholson Memorial Library System is also the Major Resource Center, or headquarters, of the Northeast Texas Library System (NETLS).

The Nicholson Memorial Library System headquarters and offices have been housed in NMLS' Central Library since 1983.[42]\n\nParks and recreation\n\n[edit]\n\nGarland includes over 2,880 acres (1,170 ha) of park land, six recreation centers, and 63 parks.[43][44]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Garland is a voluntary member of the North Central Texas Council of Governments association, the purpose of which is to coordinate individual and collective local governments and facilitate regional solutions, eliminate unnecessary duplication, and enable joint decisions.\n\nThe Parkland Health & Hospital System (Dallas County Hospital District) operates the Garland Health Center.[45]\n\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety operates the Region I office in Garland.[46]\n\nThe Texas Department of Criminal Justice operates the Dallas II District Parole Offices in Garland.[47]\n\nThe United States Postal Service operates the Garland,[48] Kingsley,[49] and North Garland post offices.[50]\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nGarland city vote\n\nby party in presidential elections [51] Year Democratic Republican Third parties 2020 56.69% 46,148 41.79% 34,023 1.52% 1,235 2016 52.22% 34,913 41.86% 27,988 5.92% 3,954 2012 47.46% 29,506 51.15% 31,801 1.39% 866\n\nGarland city vote\n\nby party in Senate elections [51] Year Democratic Republican Third parties 2020 53.77% 43,480 43.21% 34,942 3.02% 2,443\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nPrimary and secondary schools\n\n[edit]\n\nMost of Garland is in the Garland Independent School District (GISD). Parts of Garland extend into other districts, including the Dallas, Mesquite, and Richardson Independent School Districts.\n\nThe GISD does not have school zoning, so GISD residents may apply to any GISD school.\n\nThe GISD portion of Garland is served by several high schools. Garland High School is home to the district's international baccalaureate program. North Garland High School is the math, science and technology magnet. Lakeview Centennial High School is GISD's \"College and Career\" magnet school. South Garland High School is known within the community for its vocational cosmetology program.

In 2015, 4.6 percent of Garland households lacked a car, and that figure was virtually unchanged in 2016 (4.4 percent). The national average was 8.7 percent in 2016. Garland averaged 2.04 cars per household in 2016, compared to a national average of 1.8.[56] According to the American Community Survey for 2016 (five-year average), 78.8 percent of Garland residents commuted by driving alone, 13.1 carpooled, 2.5 used public transportation, and .9 percent walked. About 1.3 percent of Garland residents commuted to work by bicycle, taxi, motorcycle, or some other means, while 3.5 percent worked out of the home.[57]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nInterstate 30 is a major eastâ€“west interstate that runs through the south side of Garland. I-30 connects with Mesquite and Dallas to the west and Rockwall to the east.\n\nInterstate 635 (Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway) is an auxiliary interstate serving as a partial loop around Dallas and its suburbs. The interstate runs along the southwest section of Garland and serves as a border between Dallas and Garland. I-635 connects Garland with major freeways (such as North Central Expressway and Stemmons Freeway) and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nTexas State Highway 66 is an eastâ€“west highway that terminates at a junction with Highway 78 in downtown Garland. East of downtown the highway connects with Rowlett and Rockwall.\n\nTexas State Highway 78 (Garland Road, Lavon Drive) is a northâ€“south highway that bisects the city of Garland and goes through the downtown area. The highway is known as Garland Road south of downtown and Lavon Drive north of downtown. In downtown Garland it transverses as a pair of roads known as Avenue D and 1st Street on the northbound section and Avenue B on the southbound section. Highway 78 connects with Sachse and Wylie to the north and East Dallas to the south.\n\nPresident George Bush Turnpike is a toll road that serves as a loop around Dallas County.

Jupiter Road, the heliport is operated by SKY Helicopters Inc.,[60] which was initially awarded a lease of the facility in January 1993.[61]\n\nUtilities\n\n[edit]\n\nThe city of Garland operates the city's water system and waste services. Electricity for about 85% of Garland is provided by the city's municipal utility, Garland Power and Light (GP&L). Electricity for the other 15% was formerly provided by TXU, but is now supplied by multiple companies after deregulation of the Texas electricity market.\n\nWater and wastewater utilities\n\n[edit]\n\nGarland is an original member city of the North Texas Municipal Water District (NTMWD). The vision of the city fathers in the early 1940s resulted in Garland and its companion member cities benefitting from reliable, high quality, affordable water from the water district's many reservoirs.\n\nThe effluent from Garland's wastewater treatment plant flows through a NTMWD man-made, 1,840-acre (7.4 km2) wetland. This provides a natural habitat for a wide variety of birds and reduces the sediment, nitrogen, and phosphorus contents of the water to a drinkable level. Through the use of selected aquatic plants, this environmentally friendly project will provide millions of gallons of reusable water and reduce the environmental impact.\n\nGarland Power and Light\n\n[edit]\n\nGP&L was founded in 1923 to provide Garland residents not-for-profit public utility services, locally controlled by its citizens. GP&L provides services to over 69,000 customers, making it the fourth-largest municipal utility in Texas and the 41st-largest in the nation. It has two gas-fired generating plants, which combined have 640 megawatts of generation capacity. Garland also partners with the Texas Municipal Power Agency, which operates the 462-megawatt coal-fired Gibbons Creek Power Plant. Garland's electric distribution system has 1,007 mi (1,621 km) of overhead lines and 1,000 mi (1,600 km) of underground lines. Its transmission system consists of 23 substations and 133 mi (214 km) of transmission lines. Garland's peak load for 2007 was 483 megawatts, with annual operating revenues of nearly $238 million.[62]\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nHakeem Adeniji, offensive lineman for the Cincinnati Bengals of the National Football League\n\nTroy Baker, voice and screen actor known for video game performances, attended Naaman Forest High School\n\nTyson Ballou, model[63]\n\nCrystal Bernard, starred as K.C.
