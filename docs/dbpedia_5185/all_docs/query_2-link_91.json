We are proud to be a leading nonprofit, supported by the community since 1934. We are the most experienced and trusted health care provider for the aging, and we combat food insecurity among seniors with our Meals on Wheels program.\n\nOur Time With Neva\n\nAs her mother became ill, Barbara made the difficult decision to move her from her home in Louisiana to an assisted living facility in McKinney closer to family. Over time, her mother Neva’s health began to decline. Neva began experiencing frequent falls and going in and out of the hospital. That’s when Barbara called VNA to provide the comfort and care Neva and her family needed.\n\n“They just became an extension of our family.”\n\n– Barbara, daughter of a VNA Hospice patient\n\nLearn More About Hospice"
