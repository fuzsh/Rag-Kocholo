All of the teachers I have met really try to help you succeed in college. Not only are the teachers great, but it is in a safe central environment where the campus is breath taking!\n\nGeovanna from Rowlett, TX\n\nNot what I expected from a community college. The course load is rigorous enough to prepare for a transfer to a larger university, and the professors are very knowledgeable. I am very satisfied with this college.\n\nAlaina from Frisco, TX\n\nCollin College is the best and most advanced community college that there is. It will surely prepare you for any serious degree that you want to purse (whether there or anywhere else), but you must be ready to work for it. The faculty, the policies, and the overall environment are very conducive to learning- especially so for self starters.\n\nAlan from Plano, TX\n\nThis college has an excellent faculty that genuinely cares for their students. The Honors program helps to unlock the potential of each student that is willing to work hard. The flexibility of scheduling makes it to where anyone can find classes that meets their scheduling guidelines.\n\nsteve from Mckinney, TX\n\nthe recent change in collin turning into a 4 year university has helped the university and student reach a higher level of education. it has made it possible to become more prepared to transfer into a larger state university such as utd. overall the school is showing improvement in becoming a great stater school.\n\nErnesto Plano, Tx\n\nSimilar Colleges\n\nSee All"
