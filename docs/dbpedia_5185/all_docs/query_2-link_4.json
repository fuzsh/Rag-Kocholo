        "text": "Good afternoon,\n\nI am looking for some suggestions on where to drive my car outside of the city. I know there have been many events with the FCA (DFW) & other clubs that toured through more rural roads with curves, etc. I remember one that ended on a bluff where we had lunch.\n\nI’ve been trying to find some routes on maps, but think it would be much better to get your suggestions. I’m looking to stay in North Dallas if possible.\n\nThanks in advance.\n\nTim\n\nSent from my iPhone using FerrariChat.com mobile app\n\nFM 455 and FM121 (not state highway 121) are both great driving roads. Go as far east or west from Central Hgwy 75 as you want.\n\nAll of these are FM (Farm Market) roads, west of I-35 and north of the Metroplex.\n\n455, Slidell to Forestburg. Watch for wildlife/livestock up here. I've seen guinea fowl, javelina, feral hogs, deer and cattle on/near the road, infrequently, but enough to make you mindful when going around blind turns and when your view is blocked by hills.\n\n730, from FM455 south to Decatur (be mindful of your speeds close to Decatur), esp. on US380 and US81/287.\n\n1655, from Forestburg to Alvord.\n\n922, Forestburg to Era.\n\n373 from the junction with 922 to Muenster. This has been recently re-paved, but can be busy w/ frack trucks and the like.\n\n677, Forestburg to St Jo (avoid when Rednecks w/ Paychecks events are on-going!)\n\n1204 in and around Greenwood. Be careful though, the roads gets rough as you approach FM730. They're paved, but can be rutted.\n\nAny of the roads north of US 82 from St Jo - Muenster are fun). Small towns to look up in that area w/ good roads are Capps Corner, Bulcher, Spanish Fort, Illinois Bend. There are a few wineries up near Bulcher - which is a ghost town - where you can day trip with SO, friends, etc. like Blue Ostrich, Arche, etc. but you will have to go off-pavement for a little bit near the final destination.\n\nT\n\nThe portion of FM455 that goes over the dam is a nearly perfectly straight (small bend in the middle) 3 mile stretch with good visibility that makes an ideal place to do a high speed alignment check on your F-car. Run radar though as the Sanger popo have become a little more active up & around there in the past few years....T\n\nFM 121 east of Tioga is a nice stretch. I recall more suburbia encroachment the last time I drove it.\n\nA little further north, FM 902 near Lake Kiowa is an OK drive. 3164 from Woodbine to the junction with 902 is better IMO. Just run radar as the popo have been known to stalk 3164.\n\nIn the same neighborhood, 372 from Gainesville to 922 junction is good. Just don't speed through the ghost town of Burns City. Sheriff is often there.\n\nLone Oak from 922 to I-35 is also good in that vicinity.\n\nT\n\nMost of the roads suggested have been FM (Farm to Market) roads which living in Plano I drive quite a bit. I am also a member of the NTX car club which has a monthly drive through north Collin county and south Grayson county. We also use a lot of CR (County Roads) which intersect with the FM roads. Those are also good driving but you have to be careful as some of them are not as well maintained as the FM roads. The best bet is to just explore, you will end up somewhere interesting for sure.\n\nAny good driving CRs to suggest out that way?\n\nI tend to stay on FMs in Collin & Grayson County since I'm not as familiar and not sure which CRs are paved/unpaved. To be honest, I've taken to largely avoiding Collin County as it has become pretty overrun with suburban sprawl in the past decade.\n\nI'm more familiar with Cooke, Denton, Montague and Wise. CRs there tend to be unpaved or pretty rough. There are some nice CRs in and around Greenwood in Wise County. Almost all paved, a few rough though.\n\nT\n\nP.s. In the past I used to take our Honda Ridgeline first to check out the roads before taking the F or P car for a run. There's more than a few CRs that start out paved and then get very rough and unpaved.\n\nI'll be making a run out there in the next few weeks and I will see if I can come up with some numbers for you. As I said you do need to be careful on the CRs so pre running them first is a necessity . Up until I sold it last year I used to drive these roads in a 1,000+ HP Nissan GTR and it did get sketchy at times."
