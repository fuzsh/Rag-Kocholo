Hovnanian Homes offers a variety of homes to fit your lifestyle.\n\nLet’s explore new construction homes in Dallas and Fort Worth.\n\nSingle-Family Homes\n\nUnlike condominiums or apartments, owning a single-family home allows you the freedom to personalize your space without restrictions.

Complete with a multitude of amenities, residents gain a strong sense of community while enjoying parks, pools, clubhouses and shopping centers on-site.\n\nGolf Communities: Perfect for the avid golfer, these communities feature an on-site golf course and other amenities such as a clubhouse, pool, and tennis court.\n\nWaterfront communities: Located near rivers, lakes, or the ocean, waterfront communities are typically more expensive and provide residents with the opportunity to enjoy water sports in a relaxed atmosphere.\n\nMountain Communities: For people who love the outdoors, mountain communities offer a multitude of hiking, biking and skiing opportunities. Although more remote than other types of communities, residents appreciate the natural setting and picturesque views.\n\nGate Communities: Often characterized by a sense of exclusivity, gated communities also provide privacy and security for residents. Typically, the entrance is grander with lush landscaping and requires authorization to enter. These quiet neighborhoods allow close-knit feel among residents while limiting access to non-residents.\n\nActive 55+ Community: Designed for people who are 55 years of age and older, these communities resemble resort-style living. Complete with a variety of activities and amenities, residents enjoy their golden years as if they’re on vacation everyday. Often times, these communities feature 1-story homes and minimal maintenance for easy living. On-site amenities include a community clubhouse, relaxing pool, tennis and pickleball courts and fitness center. Planned activities keep residents engaged and lasting friendships are created.\n\nHOA or No HOA\n\nAn HOA, or Homeowners Association, is a bit like a mini-government for common-interest communities and neighborhoods.\n\nLike anything else, HOAs have their pros and cons. While some homeowners might not like having regulations regarding things like exterior decorating, others enjoy the maintenance, amenities, neighborhood events, high property values, conflict resolution, and overall sense of community an HOA offers.\n\nStep 4: Consider Whether to Build Your New Home or Move In Now\n\nNew construction homes all offer some common advantages, like high energy efficiency standards, updated technology, guaranteed adherence to new building codes, and more.\n\nWithin new construction homes, there are also key differences between a few common options.\n\nTo-Be-Built Homes\n\nBuilt from the ground up, a to-be-built home allows you the opportunity to choose structural options, interior finishes, and upgrades. Once you’ve decided on your homesite, construction begins.\n\nWhile the process tends to take 6-8 months, choosing a to-be-built home is a great choice for those wanting a more customized home without the hassle of designing, engineering and getting a building permit since the builder has done those steps in advance.\n\nMove-in Ready Homes\n\nWhether you are currently renting, and your lease is ending soon, or you’d like to move before the school year, a move-in ready home may be worth considering. With big decisions like structural options, upgrades, and interior finishes already selected, all that is left to do is close on a home and settle in without the wait time it takes to build from the ground up.\n\nSpec or Quick Move-In Homes\n\nA happy medium between a to-be-built home and a move-in ready home is a quick move-in home. With the construction phase completed, buyers can still decide on upgrades and interior design elements with their own personal style.\n\nIf you have a vision for your dream home but wish to enjoy a new home sooner, a quick move-in home may be a great option for you.\n\nStep 5: Find the Right Dallas/Fort Worth Home Builder\n\nWith many builders to choose from, the decision can be overwhelming. We might be biased, but we think K. Hovnanian Homes is a great choice if you’re looking for a new home builder in Dallas / Fort Worth.\n\nSchedule an Appointment or Tour a Model Home – A home builder’s website is a great place to start your research. There, you can view where they build and the types of homes they offer, but nothing beats viewing their homes in person. Meeting with a knowledgeable Sales Consultant, touring a model home and learning about a specific community is an excellent way to narrow down your search. Furthermore, this gives you a feel for the team you would be working with-an important aspect in your homebuying journey.\n\nDiscuss Exterior & Interior Design Options — The exterior and interior design of your house are part of what makes it a home that reflects your personality and needs.\n\nIt’s crucial to know what kind of flexibility, choices, and finishes a builder might offer, such as what you can expect in terms of cabinetry, flooring, tiles, exterior elevation, and more.\n\nCheck Home Builder Incentives, Lending Options & Special Offers – Some Texas home builders may be willing to offer incentives to help make your dream of homeownership a reality It’s always a good idea to check what a home builder can offer in terms of financing, promotions, and discounts.\n\nStep 6: Prepare Your Finances and Finalize Your Mortgage\n\nBuying a new home is a big financial decision, so it’s important to be prepared. Unless you’re buying your home outright, your mortgage is a crucial part of the process.\n\nHere are some tips on how to prepare your finances and finalize your mortgage:\n\nGet pre-approved for a mortgage. This will give you an idea of how much you can afford to borrow from lenders and will make your offer more attractive to sellers.\n\nSave up for a down payment. The larger your down payment, the lower your monthly payments will be.\n\nCheck your credit score. Your credit score will affect the interest rate you’re offered on your mortgage.\n\nShop around for a mortgage lender. Compare interest rates and fees from different lenders before you choose one. Be sure to check for special offers and incentives your home builder may be offering.\n\nRead the closing disclosure carefully. This document outlines all of the terms of your mortgage, so it’s very important to know and understand what you’re signing.\n\nOnce you’ve found a lender and agreed on the terms of your mortgage, here are a few more things to keep in mind:\n\nClosing costs. In addition to the monthly mortgage payment, you’ll also have to pay closing costs, which typically range from around 2% to 5% of the total purchase price of the home.\n\nEscrow account. An escrow account is a separate account that holds money for your property taxes and homeowners insurance. The lender will collect money from you each month and deposit it into the escrow account.\n\nTitle insurance. Title insurance protects you in case there are any problems with the title to the property.\n\nWhile the process may seem overwhelming at first, when buying a K. Hovnanian home, we offer multiple free resources to avoid common stumbling blocks and help you sail through the process. Our in-house mortgage company, K. Hovnanian® American Mortgage, L.L.C.™(KHAM), also offers a variety of loan programs to work with your budget and needs. Reach out to a KHAM representative today to learn more.\n\nStep 7: Get Ready for Your New Home in Dallas/Fort Worth\n\nAfter you’ve gotten through our first six steps, all that’s left is – well, a lot.\n\nThe full moving process – from decluttering, packing, planning, furniture, and design choices to your actual move-in day – is undeniably a laundry list in and of itself. It can be an exciting and stressful time and there are plenty of things to do to get ready, but by starting early and planning ahead, you can make things much more organized and simple.\n\nHere are some tips on getting ready to move into your new construction home:\n\nStart packing early. This will give you time to sort through your things, trim down on excess, pack your belongings carefully, and avoid last-minute stress.\n\nCreate a moving checklist. This will help you keep track of everything that needs to be done before, during, and after the move.\n\nSet up utilities and connectivity. Make sure that your electricity, gas, water, internet, and phone service are all set up and ready to go on your move-in date.\n\nTake safety precautions for children and pets. Make sure that your new home is safe for your children and pets, and that they have a safe place to play and explore.\n\nUnpack your belongings slowly and carefully. Take your time and enjoy the process of getting settled into your new home. Don’t feel bad if you realize some of the things you owned in your last home just don’t look or feel right in your new space.\n\nHere are some additional tips:\n\nLabel your boxes clearly. This will make it easy to find what you need when you’re unpacking, or if you need to locate something quickly before or after the move.
