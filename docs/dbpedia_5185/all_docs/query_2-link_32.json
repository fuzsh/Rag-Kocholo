        "text": "Lots of hail and at least one small tornado damaged homes and businesses during Thursday’s storms.\n\nThe severe weather didn’t affect everyone in North Texas. But in some counties like Denton County and Collin County, it made an impression.\n\nMany people will spend their weekend cleaning up.\n\nMORE: Dallas-Fort Worth Weather\n\nBrief tornado reported in Frisco\n\nA storm spotter shared video of ominous clouds and a possible tornado in Frisco.\n\nMichael Beard shot the video just after a tornado warning was issued for Collin County.\n\nThe National Weather Service confirmed a tornado did touch down.\n\nThe storms caused some damage on the UNT Frisco campus.\n\nOne man told FOX 4 he was inside a building on campus Thursday night and parked his car not far away.\n\nWhen the weather moved in, the high winds pushed his car around. It hit a curb and flipped over.\n\nThankfully, no one was inside the car, and no one was hurt. But the vehicle will need repairs.\n\nHeavy hail in Denton County\n\nViewer Daniel Farris said the entrance to his home in Little Elm looked like a flooded river of hail.\n\nMany other viewers in Denton and Collin counties shared photos of significant hail. It reached the size of quarters and golf balls in Flower Mound.\n\nHailey Williams took her dog for a quick walk after the worst of the storm had passed. She described what she encountered as she was driving home from work.\n\n\"I was driving home on 171 and it sounded like baseballs were hitting my car,\" she said.\n\nThankfully, her car did not have significant damage.\n\n\"It’s pretty wild. I’m from California so to see this is pretty crazy,\" Williams said.\n\nWrena Cooks is an office manager at a daycare in Lantana, a few miles south of Denton. Her Honda was one of several cars that were heavily damaged by hail.\n\n\"I come out and here she is,\" she laughed while showing FOX 4 her damaged car. \"So far, two busted tail lights, one on the ground.\"\n\nHer mom’s boyfriend does windshield replacement, so they showed up quickly to help her out.\n\nA shopping plaza in Roanoke was hard hit by the storm.\n\n\"There was nothing I could do. We just watched it destroy all the cars in the parking lot, including mine,\" Aubrey Russell said. \"It sounded like a warzone, just coming down onto the roof, just bombs going off.\"\n\n\"It just came out of nowhere, [boom, boom]. We watched it and said where is this going to stop,\" said Silver Taylor, owner of a Dickies BBQ\n\nBaseball and softball size hail pummeled cars and homes. Russell said minutes seemed like an eternity, and there was nothing she could do to stop it.\n\n\"Back window gone, mirror gone, front windshield gone, everything. It was absolutely awful,\" she said.\n\nKevin Jacobs is a roofer. He was in Roanoke Friday, and he was busy.\n\n\"It’s definitely job security, but at the same time, helping homeowners, it can be stressful on both ends,\" he said.\n\nMost of the damage was to cars in parking lots and driveways.\n\nTaylor had to juggle opening her store and deal with damages to her car Friday morning.\n\n\"It’s sad, it really is. This morning we’ve got to pick up and keep going,\" Taylor added.\n\nRussell tried to make light of the situation, but fears her car could be a total loss.\n\n\"My car is filled with glass, driving home was even scarier,\" she said. \"I will be lucky if they don’t total my car out with all the damage done.\"\n\nFires in Celina sparked by lightning\n\nFirefighters in the city of Celina, which is along the Denton-Collin County line, responded to two structure fires that started during the storm.\n\nFire investigators believe lightning started the fires.\n\nNo serious injuries were reported.\n\nThe city said it had sounded warning sirens because of the severe storms."
