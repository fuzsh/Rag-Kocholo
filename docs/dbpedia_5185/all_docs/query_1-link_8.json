        "text": "City in the United States\n\n\"McKinney\" redirects here. For other uses, see McKinney (disambiguation).\n\nCity in Texas\n\nMcKinney is a city in and the county seat of Collin County, Texas, United States.[7] It is Collin County's third-largest city, after Plano and Frisco. A suburb of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, McKinney is about 32 miles (51 km) north of Dallas.\n\nThe Census Bureau ranked McKinney as the nation's fourth fastest-growing large city from 2010 to 2019[8] and determined the city's 2020 population was 195,308.[9] Based on Census Bureau estimates, as of July 2022 the city's population was 207,507, making it Texas's 15th-most populous city.[10]\n\nThe Census Bureau defines an urban area of northern Dallas-area suburbs that are separated from the Dallas–Fort Worth urban area, with McKinney and Frisco as the principal cities; the McKinney–Frisco urban area had a population of 504,803 as of the 2020 census, ranked 83rd in the United States.[3]\n\nHistory\n\n[edit]\n\nOn March 24, 1849, William Davis, who owned 3,000 acres (12 km2) where McKinney now stands, donated 120 acres (0.49 km2) for the townsite. Ten years later, McKinney incorporated, and in 1913, the town adopted the commission form of government.\n\nFor its first 125 years, McKinney served as the county's principal commercial center. The county seat provided farmers with flour, corn, cotton mills, cotton gins, a cotton compress, and a cottonseed oil mill, as well as banks, churches, schools, newspapers, and from the 1880s, an opera house. Businesses also came to include a textile mill, an ice company, a large dairy, and a garment-manufacturing company. The population grew from 35 in 1848 to 4,714 in 1912. By 1953, McKinney had a population of more than 10,000 and 355 businesses. The town continued to serve as an agribusiness center for the county until the late 1960s.\n\nBy 1970, Plano surpassed McKinney in size. McKinney experienced moderate population growth, from 15,193 in the 1970 census to 21,283 in the 1990 census. By the mid-1980s, the town had become a commuter center for residents who worked in Plano and Dallas. In 1985, it had a population of just over 16,000 and supported 254 businesses. Since then, McKinney's rate of increase has been much more dramatic. In the 2000 census, McKinney had grown to 54,369 with 2,005 businesses and in the 2010 census the population had more than doubled to 131,117 residents.[11] The Census Bureau's most recent estimated population for McKinney (July 1, 2015) is 162,898.[11] The most recent population estimate, produced by the city as of January 1, 2019, is 187,802.[12]\n\nBoth the city and the county were named for Collin McKinney, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence, and a congressman for the Red River district of the Republic of Texas. He was the author of a bill establishing counties in the northern part of the state.[13]\n\nGeography\n\n[edit]\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has an area of 62.9 square miles (162.9 km2), of which 0.7 square mile (1.7 km2), or 1.07%, is covered by water.[14]\n\nClimate\n\n[edit]\n\nMcKinney is considered part of the humid subtropical region.\n\nOn average, the warmest month is July.\n\nThe highest recorded temperature was 118 °F (48 °C) in 1936.\n\nOn average, the coolest month is January.\n\nThe lowest recorded temperature was −7 °F (−22 °C) in 1930.\n\nThe maximum average precipitation occurs in May.\n\nIt is also part of the Texas blackland prairies, which means it gets hot summers because it is in the Sun Belt. Humidity makes temperatures feel higher, and winters are mild and are usually rainy; snowstorms occasionally occur. Spring is the wettest part of the year, which brings winds from the Gulf Coast.\n\nDemographics\n\n[edit]\n\nHistorical population CensusPop.Note%± 1850315—1870503—18801,479194.0%18902,48968.3%19004,34274.4%19104,7148.6%19206,67741.6%19307,3079.4%19408,55517.1%195010,56023.4%196013,76330.3%197015,19310.4%198016,2497.0%199021,28331.0%200054,369155.5%2010131,117141.2%2020195,30849.0%\n\nAt the 2010 U.S. census, the city had a population of 131,117 people.

MUTD offers transit services to elderly, disabled, or low-income residents of McKinney, as well as Celina, Lowry Crossing, Melissa, Princeton, and Prosper.\n\nOriginally, MUTD subsidized the cost of taxi rides.[57] In 2022, this was replaced by a curb-to-curb service (operated in association with Dallas Area Rapid Transit) that charges a fixed per-ride fare. MUTD services provide transportation to any location within Collin County, even those outside of participating cities, though trips outside of member cities have higher fares.[58]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nUS 75\n\nUS 380\n\nSH 5\n\nSH 121 (Sam Rayburn Tollway)\n\nAir\n\n[edit]\n\nThe McKinney National Airport is located in southeast McKinney and handles between 300 and 700 flights a day.[59] City-owned since 1979, in 2023 the airport completed an extension to the runway, increasing it to 8,502 feet long, along with an expansion to the air center, totaling 17,000 square feet, to provide more space and amenities for passengers and flight crews from the 20 to 30 corporate aircraft that use the airport daily.[60][61]\n\nAero Country Airport is located on the west edge of McKinney and is a privately owned public-use recreational airport with a 4,352-foot long runway that has a daily use of about 30 planes, primarily single-engine aircraft.[62]\n\nRailways\n\n[edit]\n\nDallas, Garland and Northeastern Railroad (DGNO)\n\nNotable people\n\n[edit]\n\nLen Akin, professional football player[63]\n\nDillon Anderson, 2nd National Security Advisor\n\nAverie Bishop, businessperson, social media personality, Miss Texas 2022\n\nMike Bolsinger, professional baseball pitcher, Toronto Blue Jays\n\nLarry Brantley, actor and comedian known for voicing Wishbone on the PBS series of the same name\n\nWilliam Calhoun, professional wrestler who used the professional name \"Haystack\" or \"Haystacks\" Calhoun[64]\n\nHollie Cavanagh, singer who placed fourth on 11th season of American Idol\n\nTommy Crutcher, football player; honorable mention All-State football at McKinney High School in 1959; NCAA All-American at Texas Christian University in 1963; played eight seasons (1965–1972) in the NFL, mainly for the Green Bay Packers[65]\n\nClem Daniels, pro football player\n\nElvis Duran, hall-of-fame radio host at Z100\n\nChad Haga, professional road racing cyclist\n\nKenneth E.
