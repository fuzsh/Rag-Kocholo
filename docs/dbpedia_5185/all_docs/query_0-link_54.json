        "text": "​The determination of residency classification for tuition purposes is governed by statutes enacted by the Texas Legislature and regulations developed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board.\n\nThe residency status of each student is determined during the admi​ssions process, based upon answers the student provides on the core questions found in the application.\n\nThe residency classification determines the tuition rate the student must pay.\n\nIf a student believes they are entitled to a lower tuition rate, Dallas College staff will work with the student to assist in that determination. Documentation may be required to substantiate the student's status.​\n\nDeadlines\n\nResidency reclassification requests become more numerous as the start of the semester approaches. Delays are unavoidable during these times. Dallas College has provided a solution for students to avoid delays during peak periods by establishing priority processing deadlines.\n\nSummer Semester: April 1\n\nFall Semester: July 1\n\nSpring Semester: Dec. 1\n\nDallas College will make every effort to have all residency requests with appropriate documentation submitted prior to the priority processing deadline completed before the start of the semester.\n\nPer the Texas Administrative Code, the deadline for residency changes is the certification (census) date of the semester for which reclassification is being sought.\n\nBasis\n\nEach student may base their residency status upon:\n\nself\n\nparent/legal guardian, if student is an eligible dependent per IRS rules\n\nspouse, if married\n\nTexas does not permit students to base residency upon roommates, friends or family members who do not have legal parental/guardianship rights.\n\nClassifications Definitions:\n\nIn-county (in-district): A person currently residing in Dallas County who has lived in Texas for the past 12 months.\n\nOut-of-county (out-of-district): A person currently residing in a county other than Dallas County who is also classified as a Texas resident.\n\nOut-of-state: A U.S. citizen, permanent resident or person with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) who has not resided in Texas for the past 12 consecutive months.\n\nOut-of-country: A person who is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident or who has been issued a visa that does not permit the establishment of domicile in the U.S.\n\nTuition rates are subject to change. The current tuition rate for each classification may be found on our website.\n\nWho Qualifies?\n\nTexas Residency (In-State)\n\nYou may be eligible for Texas residency if you:\n\nGraduated from high school in Texas (or received your Certificate of High School Equivalency in Texas), and you resided in Texas both:\n\n36 months immediately preceding date of graduation or receipt of Texas CHSE (last three years of high school), and\n\n12 months preceding census date of your starting semester.\n\nEstablished domicile in Texas not less than 12 months before the census date of your starting semester and you maintained domicile continuously in Texas for 12 months preceding the census date.\n\nAre a dependent whose parent established domicile in Texas not less than 12 months before the census date of your starting semester and who maintained domicile continuously in Texas for 12 months preceding the census date.\n\nHave been married for at least a year to someone who has established domicile in Texas not less than 12 months before the census date of your starting semester and who maintained domicile continuously in Texas for 12 months preceding the census date.\n\nAre a member (or spouse/dependent child of a member) of the U.S. Armed Forces whose Home of Record is Texas with the military.\n\nAre a member (or spouse/dependent child of a member) of the U.S. Armed Forces whose Home of Record is not Texas with the military but claimed Texas as your place of residence for 12 months preceding the census date of your starting semester.\n\nAre a person classified by an institution of higher education as a Texas resident for either of the two prior regular semesters.\n\nNote: An individual whose initial purpose for moving to Texas is to attend an institution of higher education as a full-time student will be presumed not to have the required intent to make Texas his or her domicile; however, the presumption may be overruled by clear and convincing evidence. An individual shall not ordinarily be able to establish domicile by performing acts which are directly related to fulfilling educational objectives or are required or routinely performed by temporary residents of the State.\n\nIn-County (In-District) Residency\n\nFor tuition purposes, Dallas County residency cannot be considered until Texas residency status is established.\n\nOnce Texas residency has been established, classification of in-county (Dallas County resident) or out-of-county is based on where the student physically resides.\n\nA student who is classified as a Texas (in-state) resident and who resides in Dallas County is eligible for the in-county tuition rate. A student who meets in-state requirements but resides outside of Dallas County will pay the out-of-county tuition rate. A waiver may be granted each academic year to some students who reside outside of Dallas County, but who own property in Dallas County subject to the Community College Ad Valorem Tax. If a student classified as in-county moves outside of Dallas County on or before a semester’s certification date, the student must pay the higher out-of-county tuition rate.\n\nForeign Nationals\n\nForeign nationals who have been granted permanent residence status that is not temporary have the same privileges as a U.S. citizen to qualify for resident status. You will be required to provide the necessary documentation needed to establish Texas residency.\n\nHow to Petition for Residency Reclassification\n\nIf a student wishes to petition for reclassification, they may do so by completing a new set of Core Residency Questions. Download the Core Residency Questions Form, complete it, then upload to the Residency Reclassification Request Form with other relevant documentation.\n\nDallas College reserves the right to request additional information to comply with the State of Texas residency requirements. Residency changes may only be made when sufficient supporting documentation is submitted.\n\nOfficial Rules and Regulations\n\nOfficial rules and regulations regarding residency may be found in th​e Texas Administrative Code: Title 19 – Education, Part 1 – Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, Chapter 21 – Student Services, Subchapter B – Determination of Resident Status. The Texas Administrative code may be found in the website of the Office of the Secretary of State.​\n\nUndocumented Student Residency / DACA Students\n\nDallas College has an open-door admissions policy. Anyone who can benefit from post-secondary education may enroll.\n\nTexas state law permits undocumented students who are or who will be graduates from a Texas public or accredited private high school to be classified as residents of Texas for tuition purposes under certain conditions.\n\nTo be considered a resident of Texas for tuition purposes, you must:\n\nhave graduated (or will graduate) from a public or accredited private high school in this state or received the equivalent of a high school diploma in this state, including the successful completion of a nontraditional secondary education, AND\n\nhave maintained a residence continuously in this state for the 36 months immediately preceding the date of graduation or receipt of the diploma equivalent, as applicable; AND the 12 months preceding the census date of the academic semester in which the person enrolls in an institution.\n\nOne more thing:\n\n\"If the person is not a Citizen of the United States or a Permanent Resident of the U.S., the person shall, in addition to the other requirements of this section, provide the institution with a signed affidavit (commonly known as the Noriega affidavit), stating that the person will apply to become a Permanent Resident of the U.S. as soon as the person becomes eligible to apply.\"\n\nAffidavit of Intent to Become a Permanent Resident (SB1528 a.k.a. Noriega affidavit)\n\nThe affidavit must be signed in the presence of a notary. Services are provided free of charge to Dallas College students at each campus.\n\nWhat does this all mean?\n\nIn short, if you are or will be a graduate of a Texas high school that you attended for at least 36 months, your official high school transcript showing your date of graduation will be your documentation to show you resided in Texas both for the 36 months before your graduation AND the 12 months leading up to the census date of your first semester IF you graduated in the most recent academic year.\n\nStudents who graduated from a Texas high school in previous years must provide additional documentation of residence in Texas for the 12 months preceding the census date. An admissions specialist will discuss acceptable documentation with you, but in general, we accept any official documents showing the student’s name and address and a 12-month history of living in Texas: pay stubs, lease agreements, utility bills, bank/credit card statements, etc.\n\nIf you earned your Texas Certificate of High School Equivalency (formerly known as the G.E.D.), then we will need your official certificate. Additionally, you will need to provide documentation proving residence in Texas for the 36 months prior to the date your certificate was issued AND for the 12 months leading up to the census date of your first semester.\n\nNote: The identification cards issued by the Mexican government known as “Matrícula Consular” may be used as a valid ID to apply for admission. Future students of Mexican origin who don’t have a Social Security card can get a “Matrícula Consular” at their closest Mexican consulate.\n\nResources:\n\nAffidavit of Intent to Become a Permanent Resident (SB1528 a.k.a. Noriega affidavit) (PDF- 183KB)\n\nFinancial Aid for Undocumented Students\n\nSuggested Documents\n\nIn-state proof\n\nStudents who were classified by an institution of higher education as a Texas resident for either of the two prior regular semesters may have an officer in the Admissions/Registrar’s office provide a letter to Dallas College stating the student was considered \"in state without waivers.\"\n\nTexas high school graduates who meet the criteria for in-state residency will need to provide documents proving residence/physical presence in Texas for 36 months prior to graduation and 12 months prior to the census date of the starting semester.\n\nAll other students will need to provide documents proving establishment and maintenance of domicile for 12 months prior to the census date of the starting semester.\n\nPhysical presence/residence documents for Texas high school graduates:\n\nOfficial Texas high school transcript with graduation date: must be sent by student’s school, district or approved transcript exchange service; transcripts received from students are considered unofficial.\n\nOfficial Texas Certificate of High School Equivalency (formerly G.E.D.) in lieu of high school transcript\n\nOfficial notarized home school transcript in lieu of high school transcript\n\nLease agreement(s) (main page only) showing dates, student’s name, and Texas address\n\nBills/statements for 12 consecutive months showing dates, student’s name, and Texas address\n\nPermanent resident card, valid visa, SB 1528 “Noriega” Affidavit of Intent to Become a Permanent Resident” if student is not a U.S. citizen\n\nEstablishment of domicile for all others:\n\nIRS form 1040 main page only for the most recent two consecutive years if both are filed in Texas (W2, 1098, 1099 forms are not accepted by Texas for residency proof)\n\nPay stubs for the past 12 consecutive months\n\nLetter(s) of employment on letterhead or via email from company official showing:\n\nHire date\n\nTermination date (or “still employed”)\n\nFull-time/part-time designation\n\nIf part- time, must also include average number of hours worked per week\n\nOfficial’s signature\n\nMarriage certificate or Declaration of Informal Marriage for those basing residency upon a spouse\n\nLeave and Earnings Statements for the past 12 consecutive months for members of the military\n\nWarranty deed/mortgage statement showing sole/joint ownership of the Texas residential real estate (must reside there)\n\nDocuments showing ownership and customary management of a business in Texas (corporate formation documents alone are not sufficient)\n\nDocuments showing public assistance in Texas as primary support (SNAP, TANF, food/housing assistance, incarceration, etc.)\n\nProof of other earned income: pensions, veteran’s benefits, Social Security, savings from previous earnings, etc.\n\nWe may request other documents that may lend support (names/dates must be legible):\n\nPermanent Resident/, Work Authorization (EAD) cards, birth certificate, U.S. passport, visa, etc. (for those classified “out of country”)\n\nVisas eligible to establish domicile: A, E, G, H1B, H4 (dependent of H1B), I, K, L, N, NATO, O1, O3 (dependent of O1), R, T, TPS, U, and V\n\nStudents with TPS/Asylee/Refugee status must show status has been granted; application alone is not sufficient.\n\nEmployment conditioned on student status (work-study), receipt of stipends, fellowships, research/teaching assistantships do not constitute gainful employment for residency purposes.\n\nIn-district proof\n\nIn-district, a.k.a. “in-county” documentation consists of some official document received by the student at their Dallas County place of residence within the most recent 30-day period. The document must legibly show the student’s name, their Dallas County address, and date.\n\nExamples include, but are not limited to:\n\nCurrent lease agreement listing student either as leaseholder or occupant\n\nOfficial correspondence – bank statement, credit card statement, utility bill, cell phone bill, cable bill, voter registration card, etc.\n\nOfficial Texas driver license/ID card showing issue date within past 30 days\n\nCurrent automobile insurance card showing student’s name and address\n\nNote: The city of Dallas and Dallas County are two different legal entities. The city of Dallas extends into other neighboring counties. It is possible to live within the city of Dallas but be outside Dallas County. Some Dallas ZIP codes may extend into the counties of Tarrant, Denton, Collin, Rockwall, Kaufman and Ellis. Dallas College uses both county line maps and the Dallas County Appraisal District data to verify the location of a residence.\n\nWhen a residence lies in a multi-county ZIP code area and the student has already been classified or reclassified as a Texas resident, we may use these maps and resources as verification to change the student’s residency status. Sometimes, however, more proof is required."
