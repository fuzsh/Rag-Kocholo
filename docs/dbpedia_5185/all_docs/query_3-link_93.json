The Colony features 28 parks with over 2,500 acres of parkland, one of the highest acres of parks per capita in the state. Creative agreements with the city and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers led to an award-winning trail system that winds through acres of wildlife management areas along the shoreline of Lewisville Lake. During the summer months, catch a wave at Fireside Surf in the deep water wave pool or make a splash at Hawaiian Waters - a tropical, outdoor water park that rivals any in North Texas.\n\nWhile some retreat, many compete at The Tribute Golf Links, Stewart Peninsula and Old American Golf Club. Each of these award-winning golf courses highlights the best of golf architecture and history combined with scenic lake views.\n\nThe Athletic Club - The Colony (formerly The Colony Five Star Complex), a state of the art athletic complex, and the TOCA Soccer Center, a 43,000 square foot indoor soccer facility, host local athletic leagues as well as regional, state and national tournaments.
