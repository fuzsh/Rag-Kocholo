        "text": "Welcome to the legendary Southfork Ranch, made famous by the Ewing Family in the television series Dallas! Southfork Ranch is a premier special events venue and meeting destination in the Dallas Metro Area. With 63,000 square feet of event space, we host hundreds of events annually, including weddings, reunions, holiday parties, corporate meetings, concerts, company picnics, and more. Whether you are hosting a group of just 10 or 10,000, Southfork Ranch provides a beautiful backdrop for any occasion. Often called “The World’s Most Famous Ranch,” the setting, facilities, and service will make your next event truly unforgettable.\n\nHistory at Southfork began in 1978 when Lorimar Productions chose the North Texas showplace as the site for the CBS TV series Dallas. The hit series, which counted millions of viewers across the United States and in 95 countries as fans, was originally broadcast in the United States from 1978 to 1991. The series continues to be broadcast in syndication and still is in first-run status in many countries around the world. Because of the Ranch's high profile on television, the beautiful white mansion, the pool, the barns and the surroundings, it quickly became a tourist mecca.​"
