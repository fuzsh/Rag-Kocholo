        "text": "It seems that every time you blink, a new development is popping up in Collin County.\n\nThe cities north of Dallas are booming, with companies and new residents moving in droves to Plano, Frisco, McKinney, Allen and elsewhere.\n\nTwo readers have asked Curious Texas — an ongoing project of The Dallas Morning News in which you submit questions and our journalists track down answers — just how fast Collin County is growing.\n\nFor example, which of the county’s cities will be most populous by 2050? And will the county ever be completely built out?\n\nAs a relative newcomer to Collin County myself, I decided to dig into these questions. I’ve been covering the area for several weeks now and wondered the same things when I first got on the beat.\n\nI reached out to Lloyd Potter, the Texas state demographer and a public policy professor at the University of Texas at San Antonio. He said that it’s difficult to nail down which city will be the largest in 30 years but that Frisco is on track to overtake Plano as the county’s largest.\n\n“Plano isn’t growing as much because it’s pretty much built out,” he said. “In terms of rapid growth and significant growth, Frisco is leading the nation.”\n\nCollin County is set to have over 2.4 million residents by 2050, according to the Texas Demographic Center. That’s more than three times its population in 2010. Other estimates put the county’s 2050 population as high as 3.5 million.\n\nTo put that in perspective, according to 2017 population estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau, Dallas County had 2.6 million residents and Tarrant County just over 2 million.\n\nEstimating which city is growing fastest is a little more difficult. The municipalities keep their own statistics and give different time frames for their estimates.\n\nFrisco's 2018 estimate puts its current population at 183,896. According to the city's 2015 comprehensive plan, the population will hit 231,500 by 2030. However, that number should drop due to recent zoning changes, decreases in residential zoning in the city’s future land use plan, and the city's policies on mixed-use development.\n\nThe Allen Economic Development Council puts the city's 2018 population at 104,363 and estimates a 2.4 percent annual growth rate. According to a 2016 city of Allen report, the city’s built-out population will be 122,441 by 2030.\n\nMcKinney’s planning department estimated a population of 187,802 as of Jan. 1. The department is in the process of updating projections, but currently estimates a population of 284,000 by 2040.\n\nIn Plano, the city's economic development group put the city's population in 2018 at 279,088. Senior planner Steve Sims estimates the city's population will top 300,000 by 2040.\n\nThe Dallas Builders Association estimates that even Celina — just over 6,000 people, according to the 2010 census — will grow to more than 300,000 residents by 2050. By then, association executive officer Phil Crone said, population should start to plateau and “development will exist in every corner of the county,” and may even spread into Grayson County, just north of Collin.\n\n“We live in a desirable area where people want to be. That’s a great thing,” Crone said. “Keeping housing affordable will be our primary challenge going forward. Affordability has driven many of the jobs here in recent years and will be the key to ensuring that everyone has access to the great school and neighborhoods Collin County has and will have to offer.”\n\nA lot of the county’s growth, Potter said, is driven by businesses moving to the area. In the last several years, dozens of companies have set up shop in Collin County. Toyota has settled in Plano. Raytheon is in McKinney. The Dallas Cowboys are in Frisco.\n\nPotter said the area is attractive to all kinds of companies looking to move, and with those relocations come lots of newcomers.\n\n“Collin County has been very effective in terms of industry and in terms of manufacturing and finance,” he said. “It’s a diversified economy.”\n\nMore Curious Texas\n\nTell us!\n\nWhat do you wonder about the culture, people and institutions of North Texas -- and the rest of our great state?
