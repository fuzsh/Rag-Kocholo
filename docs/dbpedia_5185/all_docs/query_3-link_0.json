Linguistically, 11.6% of the county spoke Spanish as their household language, followed by Asian and Pacific Islander languages.[11] Altogether 29.7% of Collin County spoke a language other than English at home, contributed in part by its large foreign-born population which made up 22% of the population according to 2019 estimates from the American Community Survey.[12]\n\nThe median income for a household in the county as of 2019 was $96,134, up from $70,835 in 2000.[13] Families had a median household income of $113,471, married-couple families $127,575, and non-family households $53,986. An estimated 6.3% of Collin County's residents lived at or below the poverty line from 2014 to 2019.[14] In 2000, about 3.30% of families and 4.90% of the population lived at or below the poverty line, including 5.10% of those under age 18 and 7.10% of those aged 65 and older.\n\nOf its residential properties, the median value of an owner-occupied housing unit was $354,100 in 2019, with a total of 8% of owner-occupied housing units ranging from less than $100,000 up to $200,000.[10] In 2007, Collin County was ranked No. 21 for high property taxes in the U.S. as percentage of the homes' value on owner-occupied housing.[15] It also tanked in the top 100 for amount of property taxes paid and for percentage of taxes of income. Part is this is due to the Robin Hood plan school financing system in Texas.[16]\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\n[edit]\n\nCollin County, Texas – Racial and ethnic composition\n\nNote: the US Census treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category.

According to the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute study, non-Christian religions are present and have been growing, largely due to migration into the county; among the non-Christian population, 3% were Hindu, 2% Muslim and 2% Jewish.[22] Overall among its Christian population, Baptists, Methodists, Catholics and non- or inter-denominational Christians have been prominent.\n\nGovernment, courts, and politics\n\n[edit]\n\nGovernment\n\n[edit]\n\nCollin County, like all counties in Texas, is governed by a Commissioners Court. The court is chaired by a county judge (equivalent to a county executive in other states) who is elected county-wide, and four commissioners who are elected by the voters in each of four precincts.[23]\n\nCounty Judge & Commissioners\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice[24] Name Party County Judge Chris Hill Republican Commissioner, Precinct 1 Susan Fletcher Republican Commissioner, Precinct 2 Cheryl Williams Republican Commissioner, Precinct 3 Darrell Hale Republican Commissioner, Precinct 4 Duncan Webb Republican\n\nCounty Officials\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice[24] Name Party County Clerk Stacey Kemp Republican Criminal District Attorney Greg Willis Republican District Clerk Mike Gould Republican Sheriff Jim Skinner Republican Tax Assessor-Collector Kenneth Maun Republican\n\nJustices of the Peace\n\n[edit]\n\nOffice Name Party Precinct 1 Paul Raleeh Republican Precinct 2 Ellen Skinner Republican Precinct 3 Mike Missildine Republican Precinct 4 Vincent J. Venegoni Republican\n\nPolitics\n\n[edit]\n\nLike most suburban Texas counties, Collin County has consistently supported Republican candidates in presidential and congressional elections since the 1960s. The last Democrat to win the county was native Texan Lyndon Johnson in 1964. By 2020, Collin County was considered a highly competitive bellwether county due to its demographic changes and the shift of college-educated voters away from the Republicans.[25] Despite this, it remains very Republican downballot; Republicans hold all of the county-level offices and all but one of the county's seats in the state legislature.[26]\n\nUnited States presidential election results for Collin County, Texas[27][28] Year Republican Democratic Third party No. % No. % No. % 2020 252,318 51.26% 230,945 46.92% 8,953 1.82% 2016 201,014 55.16% 140,624 38.59% 22,792 6.25% 2012 196,888 64.86% 101,415 33.41% 5,264 1.73% 2008 184,897 62.16% 109,047 36.66% 3,513 1.18% 2004 174,435 71.15% 68,935 28.12% 1,784 0.73% 2000 128,179 73.07% 42,884 24.45% 4,357 2.48% 1996 83,750 63.01% 37,854 28.48% 11,321 8.52% 1992 60,514 46.97% 24,508 19.02% 43,811 34.01% 1988 67,776 74.29% 22,934 25.14% 520 0.57% 1984 61,095 81.64% 13,604 18.18% 139 0.19% 1980 36,559 67.88% 15,187 28.20% 2,115 3.93% 1976 21,608 60.02% 14,039 39.00% 353 0.98% 1972 17,667 78.04% 4,783 21.13% 187 0.83% 1968 6,494 39.93% 5,918 36.39% 3,850 23.67% 1964 3,341 29.85% 7,833 69.98% 19 0.17% 1960 3,865 42.20% 5,229 57.10% 64 0.70% 1956 3,823 41.84% 5,280 57.79% 34 0.37% 1952 4,037 40.57% 5,906 59.36% 7 0.07% 1948 1,155 15.93% 5,516 76.08% 579 7.99% 1944 974 11.67% 6,574 78.79% 796 9.54% 1940 1,028 12.22% 7,373 87.65% 11 0.13% 1936 531 8.55% 5,669 91.29% 10 0.16% 1932 589 8.79% 6,059 90.46% 50 0.75% 1928 3,476 50.55% 3,377 49.11% 23 0.33% 1924 1,981 21.15% 7,215 77.04% 169 1.80% 1920 1,338 23.16% 4,045 70.01% 395 6.84% 1916 594 12.04% 4,141 83.94% 198 4.01% 1912 342 9.08% 3,187 84.58% 239 6.34%\n\nCollin County vote by party in Class I Senate elections[28] Year Democratic Republican Other 2018 46.53% 165,614 52.65% 187,425 0.82% 2,927 2012 32.83% 96,726 64.20% 189,142 2.98% 8,759 2006 26.79% 36,670 70.91% 97,055 2.30% 3,149 2000 17,72% 30,648 79.93% 138,227 2.34% 4,219\n\nCollin County vote by party in Class II Senate elections[28] Year Democratic Republican Other 2020 43.00% 207,005 54.64% 263,074 2.36% 11,383 2014 27.97% 48,876 68.36% 119,450 3.67% 6,415 2008 33.47% 96,094 64.09% 184,000 2.44% 6,996 2002 29.13% 36,750 69.86% 88,136 1.01% 1,266\n\nCollin County vote by party in gubernatorial elections[28] Year Democratic Republican Other 2022 44.31% 161,737 54.31% 198,236 1.37% 5,003 2018 39.25% 139,175 58.83% 208,075 1.82% 6.444 2014 32.60% 57,431 65.65% 115,647 1.74% 3,072 2010 33.08% 51,890 63.98% 100,359 2.93% 4,600 2006 23.49% 32,457 49.08% 67,813 27.42% 37,889 2002 30,850 30,850 74.12% 95,496 1.94% 2,492\n\nUnited States House of Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict[29] Name Party Residence 3rd Congressional District Keith Self Republican McKinney 4th Congressional District Pat Fallon Republican Sherman 32nd Congressional District Colin Allred Democratic Dallas\n\nTexas State Representatives\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict[29] Name Party Residence District 33 Justin Holland Republican Heath District 61 Frederick Frazier Republican McKinney District 66 Matt Shaheen Republican Plano District 67 Jeff Leach Republican Plano District 70 Mihaela Plesa Democratic Dallas District 89 Candy Noble Republican Lucas\n\nTexas State Senators\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict[29] Name Party Residence District 2 Bob Hall Republican Edgewood District 8 Angela Paxton Republican McKinney District 30 Drew Springer Republican Muenster\n\nState Board of Education member\n\n[edit]\n\nDistrict Name Party Residence District 12 Pam Little Republican Fairview\n\nEducation\n\n[edit]\n\nK-12 education\n\n[edit]\n\nThe following school districts lie entirely within Collin County:[30]\n\nAllen Independent School District\n\nAnna Independent School District\n\nFarmersville Independent School District\n\nLovejoy Independent School District\n\nMcKinney Independent School District\n\nMelissa Independent School District\n\nPlano Independent School District\n\nPrinceton Independent School District\n\nWylie Independent School District\n\nThe following districts lie partly within the county:\n\nBland Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nBlue Ridge Independent School District\n\nCelina Independent School District\n\nCommunity Independent School District\n\nFrisco Independent School District\n\nGunter Independent School District (very small part)\n\nLeonard Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nProsper Independent School District\n\nRockwall Independent School District\n\nRoyse City Independent School District\n\nTrenton Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nVan Alstyne Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nWhitewright Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nIn the 1990s Plano ISD received many non-Hispanic white families leaving urban areas. From circa 1997 and 2015 the number of non-Hispanic white children in K-12 schools in the county increased by 40,000 as part of a trend of white flight and suburbanization by non-Hispanic white families; however the same number of Plano ISD in particular decreased by 10,000 in that period.[31]\n\nColleges and universities\n\n[edit]\n\nCollin College opened its first campus on Highway 380 in McKinney in 1985.[32] The college has grown to seven campuses/locations—two in McKinney and two in Plano and as well as Frisco, Allen, Rockwall, Wylie, Farmersville, and Celina.[citation needed] Collin College's official service area includes all of Collin County.[33]\n\nDallas Baptist University also has an extension site in Frisco, DBU Frisco, as well as the University of North Texas's extension side, UNT Frisco.[34]\n\nThe majority of the University of Texas at Dallas campus in Richardson, Texas lies within Collin County.[35] While the main campus' address is officially within the jurisdiction of Richardson and Collin county, approximately one-third of the college is physically located within the border of Dallas county.[36]\n\nTransportation\n\n[edit]\n\nWith the Red Line operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) ending with its northern terminus at Parker Road Station in Plano, most of Collin County is not served by any public transit agencies as of 2023.[37] The Texoma Area Paratransit System (TAPS) transit service provided bus routes for a short period from 2013 until Collin County bus service was suspended in 2015.[38][39] The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) in a 2022 meeting discussed the possibility of expansion of the Red Line corridor from Plano through Allen to McKinney. Either the Red Line or Silver Line could be extended north.[40] While the Red Line could be expanded further north into Allen, Allen is currently unable to levy the 1% sales tax required to become a DART member city.[41]\n\nMajor highways\n\n[edit]\n\nU.S. Highway 75\n\nU.S. Highway 380\n\nDallas North Tollway\n\nState Highway 190 / President George Bush Turnpike\n\nState Highway 5\n\nState Highway 78\n\nState Highway 289\n\nState Highway 121 / Sam Rayburn Tollway\n\nState Highway 66\n\nState Highway 205\n\nParks\n\n[edit]\n\nBratonia Park\n\nMyers Park\n\nParkhill Prairie\n\nSister Grove Park\n\nTrinity Trail\n\nHeard Natural Science Museum and Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nMedia\n\n[edit]\n\nCollin County is part of the Dallas/Fort Worth media market.
