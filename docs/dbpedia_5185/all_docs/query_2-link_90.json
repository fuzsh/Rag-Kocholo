        "text": "Staff Member\n\nTristy Lane\n\nI had just finished my 25th year of teaching in another district and all I wanted to do was retire. I had lost my \"WHY\".\n\nI decided to try Wylie ISD, I taught 6th-grade science this year at Davis Intermediate. I found my love of teaching again - I rediscovered my \"WHY\"!\n\nStudent\n\nCarrington Hampton\n\nWhat I like most about Wylie ISD is the fact that the staff cares so much about every student and really takes the time to help and guide us in the right direction and help us prepare for the future. When a student fails they always have a helping hand to give us a boost so we don't stay down below our standards.\n\nLast year when I was a sophomore I had a Geometry teacher by the name of Mrs. Hill. She took the time to understand me and work with me until I understood the subject instead of leaving me down to work by myself and not understand the concept of Geometry.\n\nStaff Member\n\nKati Hamar\n\nAs a parent, former educator, & now staff member of Wylie ISD, I am constantly in awe of this district & how it continuously provides resources to meet the needs of students, staff, & parents.\n\nOne of my favorite parts of Wylie ISD that makes it stand out is its focus on SEL & specifically Wylie Way Day. Shutting down normal curriculum to focus on aspects that will help kids in the real world is amazing! So often we wish we had time to actually teach kids how to be citizens in this crazy world, but this allows them specific time to do just that! It introduces new vocabulary that becomes their new norm.\n\nThankful for the small-town feel Wylie ISD brings, even though it's still a fairly big district. Bush has been incredible for our family!!\n\nParent\n\nAmy Frank\n\nI have three boys with ADHD and two that require some extra services for different circumstances. Every single staff member has been caring, attentive, patient, and open to suggestions when figuring out the best academic plan for our boys and how to best address their needs. We have felt so blessed to be a part of the Hartman family.\n\nI have also been impressed with the school district and how they have been so attentive and responsive to district-wide situations that have arisen over the years from school zone safety, the pandemic, and safety at our schools. I feel the WISD administration is always on top of every situation that arises. I also love the relationships that Dr. Vinson develops with everyone district-wide.\n\nStaff Member\n\nBrianna Elder\n\nI have been a part of Wylie ISD since 2005. I started kindergarten at Akin Elementary and went through a student aspect and now starting my first year of teaching here. This is my dream! I loved going to school growing up because of the environment, the teachers, and everyone involved, and now I get to see that from an educator's point of view.\n\nI love that every school has the feeling of a home. I enjoy waking up and going to work every day to see all my colleagues and the students. Most of all, I love the support from everyone in every situation! The resources offered and the emotional support offered. I wouldnít want to be anywhere else!\n\nStaff Member\n\nDorsha Richmond\n\nI have always enjoyed working with children. Children are a blessing. I worked in childcare for 10+ years before I started working at Watkins. Working there has truly shown me that not only do I enjoy working with children, but is my true passion.\n\nMrs. Wiseman is the best principal a person could work for and with. The love that is shown is incredible and profound. I could go on and on but I will just end by saying, I enjoy what I do, and who you work with makes all the difference in the world. I don't go to a job each day, I go and enjoy my passion!\n\nStaff Member\n\nLogan Cox\n\nWylie ISD is home. As a teacher and a parent, I have always felt supported, heard, seen, and loved. As a teacher, my campus family is a safe space to be myself, learn and grow as a teacher, collaborate with my colleagues, and build relationships with my students and the community.\n\nAs a parent, I know my child's best interests are in the heart of the school, the staff, the curriculum, and she is free to take risks, try new things, and build meaningful relationships in a positive learning environment. Every student has a voice and Wylie ISD provides the resources and supports for them to be heard.\n\nParent\n\nBrittany Day\n\nMy husband and I are both WHS Class of 2005 graduates as well as parents to a Bush Elementary 4th grader. I would have never imagined coming back to Wylie after college graduation, but when we got pregnant our first thought was to return to our hometown and raise our daughter here, where we grew up and went to school.\n\nI am continually blown away by the community that is Wylie ISD and so thankful for it! Bush Elementary, specifically, is beyond my wildest dreams. The front office and administrators know me by name and always go out of their way to make me feel like part of the community. Wylie ISD is the best around!\n\nParent\n\nLareina Richetti\n\nOne daughter just graduated from Wylie East High School. The other still attends. They went to Birmingham Elementary, Davis Intermediate, McMillan Junior High & Wylie East.\n\nI think all the schools were great! The teachers and staff are great. I thought the school district beautifully handled COVID-19, especially when they gave staff and students the option to come back or go virtually.\n\nParent\n\nAlida Jones\n\nWe spent 5 years at Cox Elementary and the relationships that the teachers work to build with their students are amazing. Specifically for us, we found Mrs. Ozols to be outstanding. She was a fan of my children, even the one she never got to have. She was a fierce protector.\n\nShe taught the students where they were and helped them grow to where they needed to be. Her ability to relationship build is what makes her special and a great example of what makes Wylie ISD special. I am so thankful for Mrs. Ozols, Cox Elementary and Wylie ISD.\n\nStaff Member\n\nBrittany Wardlaw\n\nI have worked for Wylie ISD for a couple of years now in Special Education and it is by far the most rewarding school district there is.\n\nEveryone is treated like family despite race, geographic background, financial differences, etc. As an employee with the district, I have been able to grow independently, learn more about myself and help others as Wylie has been able to help me.\n\nStaff Member\n\nMia Stuart\n\nOnce I became a student of Wylie ISD my life was forever changed! I found a place to express myself and a place to be seen by people who cared about me. Wylie ISD has never let me down! I am so blessed to be on the Wylie ISD team to show other kids the Wylie Way!\n\nCommunity Member\n\nDawn Martin\n\nI am the parent of former students of Wylie ISD. The love and care I felt when my husband passed in 2016 was special. At his funeral, my extended family couldn't believe the superintendent, administration, teachers, and students were there to say their goodbyes to Ricky.\n\nTate had just started junior high when his dad passed away. I am so thankful that he had the administrators that he did at Burnett Jr. High. Ryan Bickley, Michelle Lindsay, Justin Mork, and Heather Smyder are my angels and were a complete godsend. I couldn't have made it through that school year if it wasn't for them.\n\nMr. Cravens and Mrs. Jurotich were also instrumental in being there for Tate. As a community, we are so blessed to have these people investing in our children.\n\nStaff Member\n\nSteve Boatman\n\nI taught in Wylie Independent School District for 34 years, I’m currently a part-time math tutor at Whitt Elementary, and I work closely with all the Wylei ISD elementary schools as the Book Project chairman of Wylie Retired School Employees.\n\nI’m so fortunate that I discovered and joined this district back in 1987, and I’ve enjoyed every minute of these past 37 years, both as a teacher and retiree. Wylie ISD has been and continues to be very good to me!\n\nParent\n\nMonica Muñoz\n\nWe are a family with 3 children who are currently entering their 13th year with Wylie ISD. As parents, we are active, involved, and invested in this school district beyond our own children and family and we have had nothing less than the best experiences.\n\nStarting in elementary, where all 3 of our children were afforded the opportunity to participate in the Dual Language program, they had some of the best, top-notch and caring teachers. Two of our three children have been identified as GT and the other was identified with Visual Processing Disorder and memory span. The support for these programs alone has been stellar.\n\nOur 3 also have had the opportunity to take advantage of additional programs including Band, Theatre, and Cheer.\n\nParent\n\nKathryn Turner\n\nI love how much Wylie ISD communicates with parents. This tells me they truly value the delicate balance of school and home life, and how we need to work together to help the student build confidence and feel success.\n\nOne of my children who attends Wylie schools is disabled and the love and care the teachers show is seen, felt, and appreciated. I see inclusion and acceptance happening in our community and I believe our Wylie public schools pave the way for that.\n\nStudent\n\nLandon Hawkinberry\n\nMcMillan Staff have supported me through my entire Amputation. Pre Support and After Support. They have found ways to include me in all of their activities. Thank you MCMILLAN!\n\nStaff Member\n\nAdriene Jones\n\nMy family and I moved to Wylie when my son was starting 2nd grade. We picked Wylie and specifically Watkins Elementary based on the recommendations from several families in the area.\n\nMy son and I, as a teacher, were in another district and it had gotten to the point where we needed more. From the moment I walked into Watkins for my interview, I knew this was our place - this was our home. The teachers at Watkins, both then and now, have made such an impact on my son and myself.\n\nMy son left Watkins 4 years ago, loving school. And I go to work every day, loving my job - loving my place. People I previously worked with have asked about working in Wylie and my response is the same \"I have drunk the Wylie water and it tastes GOOD!\"\n\nParent\n\nAmanda Regalado\n\nI would like to sing the highest praises for four extraordinary teachers my kids had last year: First and second, Mrs. Jill Palomino & Mrs. Catey Marcom changed my child's life this year. The care, kindness, understanding, and love these two showed my kiddo brought out the best in her. She went from struggling in school to all As and Bs - and most importantly she loved school for the very first time.\n\nThird, Mr. Quincy Riley at Harrison goes above and beyond for his students in so many ways. The care he takes to make sure they feel heard & understood is rare and beautiful.\n\nFourth, Mr. Davis Ponjuan at Harrison has made band such a fun and inspiring experience for my new instrumentalist. The joy and community he creates in his class is amazing and exemplary!\n\nStaff Member\n\nAriel Hamilton\n\nSomething that I love about Wylie ISD, and specifically Groves Elementary is that the Groves family and community embraces and advocates for students with all kinds of abilities. I love being a part of a family that is constantly looking for ways to become more inclusive!\n\nParent\n\nMrs. Brittaney Smith\n\nThe choir program at WEHS is phenomenal. Dr. and Mrs. Dame are a dynamic team who've made the program into what it is today with their enthusiasm and commitment to their songbirds. Every student is given an opportunity and every student is showcased, which I feel is a rarity in any program.\n\nMy child began his choral career 3 years ago under the direction of Ms. Jackson at McMillan JH. The sky has been the limit from there. He's received nothing but encouragement, positive advice, constructive criticism, and support from the fantastic role models associated with the Wylie East program. From performances to trips, we can't wait to see what the next three years will bring!\n\nParent\n\nKinsey Mandy\n\nWe absolutely love Wylie ISD. I want to start there. There are two people that I would be ashamed not to call out for being exceptional and that's the Dame's. They are the most caring, supportive, FUN teachers my kid has ever had.\n\nI also want to call out one other, and that's Kara Milot. My daughter struggled in Elementary with comprehension which hurt every subject but there's something profound about connection. Mrs Milot was TREMENDOUS with our daughter and from that year on, her grades and attitude towards school all shifted after having her class.\n\nThese are significant impacts these teachers are having on our kids and I believe at the root of it is love, kindness, and caring.\n\nParent\n\nMarquee Crandall\n\nWe moved here over 5 years ago with a new 2nd grader and a preschooler. We moved from Allen ISD due to Wylie being more affordable with comparable schools. I was a nervous mother with a nervous child. But we have had great experiences the last 5 years.\n\nBirmingham Elementary has now had both boys and our youngest just finished 4th grade and is moving on to Davis. Our oldest starts 8th grade at McMillan and the fine arts program, specifically the band program, has been so positive for him. Our oldest has found his niche and is doing so well both academically and socially. Our youngest finished his kindergarten year virtually and finished 4th grade strong and is doing well and is on track both academically and socially.\n\nParent\n\nCynthia Beversdorf\n\nThis past year, my son entered Burnett from Harrison. For years, we have struggled to get him into the right program to help him with issues that he's had past from not only his own traumatic life, but the trauma that has been caused because other adults have not understood how to work with him.\n\nWe have found the perfect team to work with my son at Burnett. The AP that we work with is Justin Mork and he is beyond excellent and thinking outside the box and really looking out for our children.\n\nHis teacher Mrs. Rippy works very diligently and tries to keep a balanced setting for my son as well as the teachers. my son has learned to trust For the first time in his academic career. We are very grateful to Burnett Junior High.\n\nStaff Member\n\nAlyssa Harwell\n\nI have a few things I love about Wylie ISD. I have been here for 10 years! I love the passion and love Mrs. Hudgins has for her staff and students! She goes above and beyond to make sure everyone feels valued, heard, and appreciated!\n\nI have had the pleasure of working for her the past 6 years! My second would be Mrs. Parker-Akins, the music teacher at Hartman. We moved from Groves to Hartman my daughter's 4th-grade year, which was hard for her to leave everything she knew the past 4 years. My daughter has a huge personality but was having a hard time finding her place at Hartman. Mrs Atkins embraced my daughter and gave her a place to shine on stage during their musical and talent show. She gave Katie Jo a place to be her and belong.\n\nStaff Member\n\nChristine Monroe\n\nI love Wylie ISD for so many reasons! I love my school community at Tibbals. We have the best admin and staff, it is like a family. My husband was born and raised in Wylie..football games are like a high school reunion and I love that about our town.\n\nMy oldest daughter graduated from Wylie and spent her time in high school playing soccer and in FFA. My youngest daughter plays softball and raises pigs in FFA. No matter where we go, we see a familiar face and that's what makes this place home.\n\nStaff Member\n\nHelens Guillen-Morales\n\nI was given the opportunity to start my career as a teacher here. I started as a substitute in 2023, and then hired on as a kindergarten teacher that summer. I have been mentored and shaped to be the best that I can be. I'm still learning and growing every day. I am just extremely thankful for all of the tools that I have been given by Wylie ISD to grow.\n\nI finished my first year of teaching in May of 2024, and received staff member of the month at my campus. I couldn't have done it without those people around me building me up! I'm so grateful to be part of Wylie ISD.\n\nStaff Member\n\nCarol Nelson\n\nI retired from RISD after 30 years but decided to sub in Wylie as we live here. I am so pleased with Ashley Hopson and the entire sub-system. She is so very helpful and gets right back to me when I have a question. Payroll does the same when I have a question for them. The kids at both schools are well-behaved, respectful, and seem to really want to learn. I am so happy I chose to sub in Wylie ISD. Our daughter got a wonderful education here, went off to OU, and now works for NBC and is very successful.\n\nStaff Member\n\nLacey Boruk\n\nI started in Wylie ISD in 2015 at Whitt Elementary. I have loved being at Whitt for so many reasons. The administrators lead with a genuine, caring and supportive leadership style while also holding us accountable to be the best educators we can be and pushing us to continue learning and growing to best support our unique group of students each year. In my experience the staff have been very cohesive and supportive, pushing each other to grow and asking the hard questions for the benefit of the students. I have grown so much as a teacher thanks to the support of my administrators, coworkers and the learning specialists who also work tirelessly to provide everything they can think of and anything they are asked for.\n\nStudent\n\nAndii Workman\n\nI LOVE how safe and well the security is in this district. Having a mother and brother who work and attend Akin, I feel that safety and security of students and staff at all schools matter. Students come to school to learn, not to focus or worry about what could happen to them during lessons. I feel that Wylie ISD does quite a good job at doing just that.\n\nStaff Member\n\nKristin Rea\n\nI like being a part of the Wylie ISD family because it is a community of love. This year, my family was faced with a trauma and the entire community stepped up to show their support. Hartman Elementary enveloped my younger kids with hugs, kind words and a safe space to continue to learn and grow.\n\nThe love that Cooper Junior High showed my oldest son and I came in so many forms: prayers, food, hospital visits and a great deal of patience. This year in the worst moments of my life, Wylie ISD made me feel loved and supported every day. In the spirit of Wylie Way, they proved that tiny (and big) humans come first and a great education with will follow. This spring, my kids learned that school is about more than what you learn in books.\n\nStaff Member\n\nMrs. Jordan Alexander\n\nAkin Elementary has been amazing for both of my kids. They have been great at keeping us up to date on upcoming events. My kids love going to school to see their teachers. Everyone at Cooper Junior High has been so welcoming. They are all checking in on me to make sure that I have everything I need to help myself and the students that I am serving. The administrators are always visible and willing to help at the drop of a hat no matter what they are doing at the time. Wylie East High School has amazing teachers who go out of their way to help each other and their students.\n\nStaff Member\n\nJohn Poe\n\nThe best thing about Wylie ISD is the support I receive. I am surrounded by people who genuinely want to help me become the best version of myself. My PLC and learning specialist help me analyze data and provide better instruction in my classroom. If there is anything I need, the director of curriculum is enthusiastic to help.\n\nMy administration is quick to ask about what I need to make things work in my classroom. If there is anything I want to improve on or a new skill I want to learn, there are any number of trainings provided by the district to help me to that end. I would not be the educator I am today had I started in any other district. The people and programs at Wylie ISD help me to be the best version of my myself, year after year.\n\nParent\n\nShannon Webb\n\nWe have loved raising our kids in Wylie and within Wylie ISD.\n\nStaff Member\n\nJustin Debrow\n\nI've worked in four districts in eleven years. I know by now what good administration looks like. I know what good relationships among my peers looks like. I know what support for me and my students looks like.\n\nI have all of this and more working in Wylie ISD. I have never felt more supported in my role, and I am able to have such great relationships with these kids every year partly because of this support. It is such an honor to work for a district that really knows how to take care of the students and the teachers.\n\nWorking for Wylie ISD and working in the math program here has been truly a blessing.\n\nStudent\n\nTrinity Wheatley\n\nI literally love everything about Wylie ISD , I love the way the teachers are patient with the students and give the student chances , I also love how the teachers and district provide love and care for the students (even during STAAR), Last but not least I love all the teachers , faculty and staff and the students.\n\nStaff Member\n\nStephanie James\n\nAs my last kid graduates this year, I could not be more grateful for the district in which she and her sister have grown up. I think what I appreciate most about Wylie ISD is the fidelity with which it has influenced them to be the best version of themselves.\n\nThere has been such a strong focus on developing their character alongside encouraging positive forward-thinking about their future and all its possibilities. I've seen the district's intentionality from the perspective of a parent, a volunteer with PTA and now as an employee. In each facet, I've seen a consistency and clarity in what the goal and purpose is for every student and the focus on building relationships.\n\nI completely understand why Wylie ISD is a destination district.\n\nParent\n\nMrs. Katy Parish\n\nAngel Alvarado, the 5th-grade dual language social studies teacher, embodies the very best of our district. As one of the few male teachers in the program, he instantly connects with all students, especially boys, serving as a vital role model during their formative years. His twice-weekly soccer club provides a productive outlet for energy & fosters lasting friendships - he even comes to his students' games on weekends. His bilingualism creates a welcoming space for new, native Spanish-speaking students, nurturing a sense of belonging as soon as they come to Harrison. His impact extends far beyond the classroom, leaving an indelible mark on countless lives. Mr. Alvarado is truly one of the finest assets of our school district.\n\nStaff Member\n\nAlicia Addington\n\nWylie ISD doesn't just feel like home, it is home. Home to the most amazing families, teachers, admins and most importantly all the students.\n\nFinding a district that preaches relationships over anything else was crazy, working at a campus with admin who actually expects relationships to be built and staff who actually does it and puts KIDS FIRST? A DREAM.\n\nWith relationships first, every other good thing in a school follows. The kids I get to teach and the families I get to work with make my job worthwhile. The way Wylie celebrates their teachers, staff and students is over the moon. I am so blessed to call Wylie ISD not just the place where I work, but a place that I love to be.\n\nStaff Member\n\nKatelyn Cutright\n\nI love everything about Wylie ISD. I am currently student teaching at Tibbals and will be a third grade teacher there starting in August, I am beyond thrilled! I grew up in Wylie and went to Birmingham, Dodd, Davis, McMillan, and Wylie High School.\n\nMy mom worked in the district so I really know the love and hard work that goes into a district. I knew when I decided to become a teacher I wouldn't want to teach anywhere else but here. I feel at home here. I know Wylie does what is best for kids, they support their staff and love their people! They make everyone feel welcome.\n\nI love Wylie ISD for those reasons.\n\nStaff Member\n\nMeagan Wendt\n\nI love how supported I have felt as an educator. From the campus level to the district level- people care! My principal's have helped me grow and become a leader, but also district staff in Leadership Academies. They believe and they help you become a better you!\n\nStaff Member\n\nTaslim Chaudhury\n\nMy family and I love being a part of the Wylie ISD family. We have two kids who are attending Wylie ISD schools, and they are getting a quality education that prepares them for college and beyond. As an ISS Administrator at Burnett Junior High, I work with amazing teachers and staff who create a positive and supportive learning environment for the students.\n\nMy wife is a board member of the Wylie East Booster, and she supports the Pride of the East band program that fosters creativity and teamwork among the students. Wylie ISD is more than a school district, it's a community that values diversity, innovation, and excellence.\n\nCommunity Member\n\nSteve Boatman\n\nEven after 34 years of teaching and four years of retirement, Wylie Independent School District STILL plays an important role in my life! I enjoy tutoring and interacting with my math students two days a week at Whitt Elementary; I volunteer every Thursday with the third grade Green Team at Whitt; and as the ECHO Book Project chairman of the Wylie Retired School Employees group, I help raise money and collect books to promote reading literacy at our elementary campuses. I am grateful to Wylie ISD for all of these opportunities!\n\nStaff Member\n\nMrs. Shannon Jameson\n\nThis is my first year in Wylie ISD after 19 years of teaching in another district. I feel I have made the best decision in my life. This district is like family and I have learned so much from so many people.\n\nAs a Bush Elementary teacher and parent, I have no words to express how amazing that school is. I have found my forever teaching home in Wylie!!!!!\n\nParent\n\nTabitha Lovins\n\nMy daughter has only been in this school district for a few months and I already absolutely love this school. My daughter is getting help when she needs it and is learning a lot more than she did at her last school. I'm glad my children are in this school district"
