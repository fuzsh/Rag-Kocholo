        "text": "Other North Texas cities that scored a top spot include Princeton (22.3%), Anna (16.9%), Prosper (10.5%) and Forney (10.4%).\n\nIn total, Texas cities claimed eight of the 15 spots, including Georgetown and Kyle outside of Austin and Fulshear near Houston.\n\nFour of the North Texas cities are in Collin County, which added the second-most residents in the country.\n\nThe bulk of its growth is domestic migration — people moving there from other places in the region, state and around the country. Celina’s proximity to historically fast-growing areas and the relocation of businesses to Dallas-Fort Worth’s northern markets has fueled the growth, said Lloyd Potter, state demographer at the Texas Demographic Center.\n\n“We’ve seen in Collin County just this tremendous growth, really starting last decade or so with Plano and then kind of moving up into Frisco, and now in Celina,” he said.\n\nThe growth wasn’t limited to the North Texas’ suburbs. Fort Worth added more than 21,000 people, the second-most in the country behind only San Antonio.\n\nCelina added just over 9,000 residents. Denton added more than 7,900 people, the 13th-most in the nation. Dallas added an estimated 5,510 people, a 0.42% increase during that period.\n\nOther tiny cities in the region saw population jumps, too. Weston, in Collin County, more than doubled its population in 2023, jumping to an estimated 816 residents.\n\nAs the population booms, more housing units have come with it. Four North Texas counties were in the top 15 for overall housing unit growth.\n\nCollin County added roughly 18,000 additional housing units, the fifth-most in the country. Tarrant (17,194), Denton (14,296), and Dallas (13,644) also earned spots.\n\nThe counties are hotspots for builders because of the proximity to jobs, said Don Dykstra, chairman of Bloomfield Homes. Bloomfield is one of the region’s largest homebuilders, and they have projects ongoing in high-growth suburban counties.\n\n“At the end of the day, people want to live within a reasonable commute to their work,” he said.\n\nThe development is expected to continue as Kaufman County and areas like Princeton, Anna and Celina are among the most active submarkets for new home starts in the region, according to data from Dallas-based Residential Strategies, a market research company focused on Texas’ new home industry.\n\nKaufman County led all D-FW submarkets in annual home starts with 3,783 from April 2023 to March 2024, a 59.4% year-over-year change. Celina was not far behind with 3,127 new home starts, up roughly 70% annually.\n\n“We expect to see continued growth in Celina over the next several years,” said Ted Wilson, principal of Residential Strategies. “There’s an awful lot of development that’s slated that hasn’t started yet, but it’s going to be coming.”\n\n©2024 The Dallas Morning News.
