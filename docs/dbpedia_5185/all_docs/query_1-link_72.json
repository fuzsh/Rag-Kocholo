        "text": "Collin County, nestled in the heart of North Texas, is gearing up for a seismic transformation over the next few decades. With its current population of around 1 million residents, the county is projected to more than double by 2060, according to a new study by the Texas Demographic Center. Among Collin County towns, the city of Celina stands out as a prime example of this strong growth: a 97 percent population spike since 2020 (45,000 residents).\n\nCelina, once a small agricultural community, has rapidly evolved into a bustling suburb, attracting residents seeking a blend of tranquility and accessibility. The city’s strategic location, situated along the Dallas North Tollway, has played a pivotal role in its exponential growth. As Collin County’s population surges, Celina has become a magnet for families and businesses alike, drawn by the promise of a dynamic community with ample opportunities.\n\n“From its small-town charm, two A-rated school districts, and supportive business environment, it’s no surprise that so many people have chosen to make Celina their home,” Mayor Ryan Tubbs told the Dallas Morning News.\n\nPreparing for Growth\n\nAs more families begin to call Prosper and Celina home in the coming years, the North Texas Tollway Authority is also preparing to expand the Dallas North Tollway from US 380 to FM 428.\n\nSet to commence construction in spring 2024, the expansion of the Dallas North Tollway through Prosper and Celina is a game-changer for the region. The 6-mile expansion – project to open to traffic in 2027 – will consist of three lanes in both directions and provide enhanced connectivity to major employment hubs and Metroplex hot spots.\n\nNew in 2024\n\nCelina will welcome several exciting new businesses in the New Year. Residents are eagerly awaiting the opening of The Wick, a bakery and restaurant in Downtown Celina, Honey Creek Venues, a 30-acre event venue, 1876 Country Club featuring an 18-hole golf course, and a Lowe’s home improvement store coming soon at Ownsby Parkway and Preston Road.\n\nAdditionally, the much-anticipated whiskey and wine bar in Downtown Celina, The Silos, is also slated to open in early 2024.\n\nAs communities like Celina evolve in the coming years, the delicate dance between progress and preservation will shape the future, ensuring that Collin County remains a vibrant and thriving hub for generations to come. Now is the time to invest in the future! Mustang Lakes is Celina’s premier master-planned community, featuring award-winning amenities and new construction homes by DFW’s top homebuilders."
