        "text": "Most people find it hard to believe that you can see spectacular sunsets like this in North Texas but they have not been to Truth Hill Farm that lies within a unique part of eastern Collin County about 1 hour north of Dallas.Â This picturesque area offers rolling hills with cineramic views you won't soon forget!\n\nCome out to the farm and see how our animals are raised to produce high quality meats.\n\nÂ Contrast this sight with a trip past a cattle feed lot where hundreds of cattle may stand belly deep in their own waste and mud and eat bakery waste and commercially processed grain designed to produce fast weight gain.Â\n\nOur cows and sheep are raised on natural pastures eating grasses and dry forages.\n\nÂ Rockwall Deliveries-Â We make deliveries to Rockwall every other Saturday year round.Â We meet in the Cross Fit Rockwall parking lot at 407 S Goliad St.Â Pick up time is at 8:30am.Â Next delivery is September 17th.Â The following drop will be on October 1st, 2022.\n\nÂ\n\nFairview/Allen drop every otherÂ Thursday at 10amÂ in the parking lot of Dillard's at Stacy Road & 75.Â Next drop is Thursday, September 15th.Â We meet out from the west store entrance.Â ï»¿ The following drops will be on September 29th and October 13th, 2022."
