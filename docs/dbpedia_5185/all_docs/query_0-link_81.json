        "text": "Effective Pest Control In North Dallas, TX\n\nNorth Dallas comprises several communities and neighborhoods in the greater Dallas, Texas metro area, including parts of Dallas, Collin, and Denton counties. In recent years, North Dallas has become a destination all its own, complete with attractions including the NorthPark Center, Galleria Dallas, Dallas Midtown, and more.\n\nUnfortunately, as North Dallas communities thrive, so do the pest communities living just outside the suburbs and commercial areas.

Responsible for billions of dollars in property damage every year in the United States alone, leaving your home unprotected from termites is a recipe for disaster.\n\nUnfortunately, termites are tough to prevent for homeowners working on their own. Termites operate underground, out of sight, so you probably won’t even know you have an infestation until damage has already occurred. Worse, because they’re attracted to the very wood inside your home’s walls, floors, and foundations, you can’t just remove their potential food source like you can with other pests.\n\nThe solution lies with All-Safe Pest & Termite. With help from the Sentricon® System with Always Active™, our team of termite professionals can form a protective barrier around your home that will stop termites from getting inside and eliminate colonies in the area. Contact us today and find out how a professional termite treatment can save you time, money, and headaches.\n\nWhy Mosquitoes Are A Serious Problem For North Dallas, TX Residents\n\nMosquitoes: an annoying summertime nuisance, right? Yes, but they’re far more than that: mosquito bites can transmit serious viruses and diseases to humans, including West Nile virus, Zika virus, dengue, yellow fever, malaria, and more. Their ability to spread so many diseases makes them among the topmost deadly animals on the planet.\n\nWhile these diseases are less prevalent in the United States, they still occur, and the bacteria and other potential microorganisms mosquitoes can spread should be avoided at all costs. Unfortunately, mosquitoes are difficult to eliminate once they become established in an area, especially for homeowners working on their own, in areas like North Dallas, where they thrive.\n\nWhat’s the solution? Contact the mosquito control specialists at All-Safe for help. No matter the size of your mosquito problem, we have the solution, and we’ll work with you to keep your property protected from these buzzing, biting pests in the future. Contact us today for more information.\n\nAcrobat Ants In North Dallas: Identification, Facts, & Control\n\nThere are many ant species in the North Dallas area. Some are dangerous because of their aggressiveness, the diseases they spread, stings and bites they deliver, the damage they cause, and other dangers. At the same time, other species are nuisance pests because they do not cause harm or threaten people. Acrobat ants fall into the latter category of nuisance pests.\n\nAlthough they are not dangerous, acrobat ants, or any other species, are not welcome in residential properties. Here is what you should know about acrobat ants:\n\nIdentification\n\nAcrobat ants are about 1/8 inch long and are typically yellowish-brown to black, but can be multicolored. They have a heart-shaped abdomen, six legs, antennae, and a stinger.\n\nFacts\n\nWhile they have a stinger, acrobat ants rarely sting people. However, they can sting, bite, and emit a foul odor when threatened.\n\nTheir name comes from the acrobatic move they can perform by raising their abdomen over the thorax and head. This move usually only happens when they are bothered.\n\nQueen acrobat ants are larger than worker ants, growing to 3/8 inch long; worker ants grow to 1/8 inch.\n\nAlthough they prefer to be outside, acrobat ants can make their way inside as they forage for food.\n\nThe preferred food source of acrobat ants is honeydew, a sugary liquid made by aphids, which are crop-damaging pests.\n\nControl\n\nFor ants, correctly identifying the infesting species is essential to effective removal. Because of this, DIY pest control methods often do no work against acrobat ants and other species. Instead, using professional ant pest control services from All-Safe Pest & Termite will provide the results you need.\n\nAnts are such a big problem during the summer months in Texas, so All-Safe Pest & Termite offers a targeted control process to eliminate and prevent this pest. Contact our team today to learn more about how we can assist with acrobat ants and other species.\n\nA Handy Guide To American Cockroaches For North Dallas Homeowners\n\nCockroaches are a common home-invading pest. There are many species of cockroaches in our area, and identifying them is essential to performing the proper treatment methods. One of the types of cockroaches in North Dallas is the American cockroach. Here is a guide to everything you need to know about this pest:\n\nIdentification\n\nAmerican cockroaches are the largest home-invading species in North America, ranging between 1 1/4 to 2 1/8 inches long. They are a reddish-brown color and have a yellowish figure-eight pattern on the back of the head. Like other cockroaches, they have an oval-shaped body, six legs, and antennae. Although they have wings, American cockroaches can only fly short distances.\n\nDangers\n\nAs with other species, American cockroaches are capable of spreading many dangerous diseases, including, but not limited to salmonellosis, E. coli infection, typhoid fever, dysentery, and cholera. As they infest homes, cockroaches leave behind shed skin, carcasses, droppings, and saliva, which can cause contamination, trigger asthma, and irritate allergies. Although rare, American cockroaches can bite, causing irritation, swelling, and potentially leading to secondary infection.\n\nHabitat\n\nAmerican cockroaches prefer warm, dark, and damp places. Outside, they live in sewers, near manhole covers, sump pumps, dumpsters, and landfills. This pest gravitates to crawl spaces, basements, bathrooms, and near drains when they make their way inside.\n\nBehavior\n\nIn general, cockroaches are not picky eaters, consuming various things ranging from human food, leather, glue, decaying organic matter, and more. This kind of diet can lead to damage to furniture, floorings, personal belongings, and other items when American cockroaches infest. While they are voracious eaters, adult American cockroaches can survive for an extended time without eating.\n\nPrevention\n\nYou can take four steps to help prevent the infestation of American cockroaches on your property.\n\nEnsure there are no potential entryways by installing covers on drains, vents, and sewers; repairing damaged screens and weather stripping; sealing cracks in the foundation and other weaknesses in the home’s exterior, including along the roofline.\n\nKeep the interior and exterior clear of food sources like crumbs, dirty dishes, pet food, garbage cans without lids, and fallen fruit.\n\nReduce moisture in your yard and home by removing organic debris, keeping gutters unclogged, repairing leaks, fixing poor ventilation, and using dehumidifiers.\n\nKeep your home and yard decluttered and organized to eliminate harborage areas and make it easier to clean.\n\nControl"
