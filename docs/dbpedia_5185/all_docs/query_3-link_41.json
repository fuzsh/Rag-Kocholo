        "text": "\"Let me introduce you to the blue house on Swiss Avenue; it is where I found a new family and acceptance. It was the blue house that opened up my eyes to the truth about mental illness and the condition that had left me silenced by my own “blood” family. The blue house gave me a consistent place to call mine when I lived out of my car as I first claimed my emotional support dog. The blue house didn’t close its door to me in judgment or abandonment, but invited me in with open arms when I was at my lowest. It even allowed shelter to my emotional support dog and made me a part of the family when I felt alone with no place to go. The blue house became my safe haven and a place where I was able to blossom and finally find my voice in a world that stigmatized those living with mental health conditions.\n\n​\n\nThose inside the blue house on Swiss Avenue became my new family and strength while I was navigating these new waters of recovery and self-identity. I did not have to hide here at the blue house; it was my transition to find my own spot in society as an individual and not as a statistic. The blue house gave me the encouragement to keep going and to listen to others who have been victimized and silenced by their own suffering. I no longer have to be afraid, because the family in the blue house broke my silence and gave me the power to find my purpose. My new family loved and cared for me despite my illness and saw me for the person I was, not the mental health conditions I had.\n\nIt was the blue house on Swiss Avenue that helped me finally break free from the chains of stigma that held me captive for far too long.\""
