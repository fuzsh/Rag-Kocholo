        "text": "According to recent US Census data, Collin County has grown significantly with its total population now at 1,095,580. Collin County experienced a steady 2% to 4% increase in population over the last five years and a 198.30% jump in population from 1990 to 2010.\n\nPopulation growth means economic prosperity and diversity for the area. Many cities in Collin County have experienced tremendous growth in recent years. Below, we review the four fastest-growing cities in Collin County, based on their population in 2019 and their growth percentage rate from 2015 to 2019.\n\n1. Celina\n\nPopulation: 16,299\n\nPopulation growth: 50.8%\n\nEstablished in 1876 by settlers, Celina’s population has almost tripled in size since 2010, making it the fastest-growing city within Collin County. Celina boasts a vibrant economy, with a median household income of $92,000 and an average house value of over $450,000. Lilyana, a master-planned community by Hillwood Communities, is located within Celina and halfway between Celina and Prosper (Number 4 on our list).\n\n2. Melissa\n\nPopulation: 12,117\n\nPopulation growth: 37.8%\n\nThe town of Melissa was laid out in 1872 when the Houston and Central Railroad was built through the area. Railway transportation made the town a commercial center for area farmers. Located in north-central Collin County, Melissa has enjoyed steady growth over the years and is projected to grow more in the future. Currently, Melissa is updating infrastructure and adding amenities to the city to be ready for its next phase of economic growth.\n\n3. Princeton\n\nPopulation: 13,894\n\nPopulation growth: 35.4%\n\nEstablished around 1888, Princeton is another historic town in the northeast section of Collin County, 30 miles away from Dallas. Princeton is known for a small-town feel and a slower pace. It boasts an excellent school system and a crime rate that is 1.7 times lower than the U.S. average.\n\n4. Prosper\n\nPopulation: 24,579\n\nPopulation growth: 34.9%\n\nAs the name suggests, Prosper continues to do just that. The second-largest city on this list, just south of Celina, Prosper continues to grow while still maintaining its city motto of “A Place Where Everyone Matters.” Further doing credit to its name, Prosper’s average household income was $146,733 in 2019. Prosper is also an extremely active community. There are numerous public parks, hiking trails, golf courses, athletic fields, and recreational sports leagues for all ages.\n\nConsider Lilyana by Hillwood\n\nIf you are looking to move to Collin County, consider Lilyana by Hillwood in the Celina/Prosper area, which puts you in the #1 fastest-growing city in the #1 fastest-growing county in Texas. Top-notch schools, fantastic community amenities, and 50 acres of beautiful green spaces are just the beginning of what Lilyana has to offer you.\n\nLilyana is a master-planned development by Hillwood Communities, a company established by Ross Perot Jr. in 1988. Hillwood Communities creates one-of-a-kind neighborhoods that foster meaningful interactions between neighbors.\n\nHillwood Communities Offers Loads of Amenities\n\nFaster population growth means more demand for amenities, and Hillwood has that in spades. Each community within the Hillwood portfolio is thoughtfully and meticulously planned by our amazing staff. It is little wonder we received the Dallas Builders Association Developer of the Year award in 2016, 2018, and 2020."
