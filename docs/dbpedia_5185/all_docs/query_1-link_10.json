        "text": "Is Collin County growing?\n\nThere’s no denying that Collin County is growing. As of the 2020 census, the population was 1,064,465. And as of 2021, the estimated population is 1,109,462. That’s an increase of nearly 5%. But what does that mean for those who live in Collin County? Well, for starters, it means that there are more people moving to Collin County than ever before. And that’s not surprising given the many reasons why people choose to relocate here. From the great schools to the abundance of jobs, there’s a lot to love about Collin County. And with the population continuing to grow, it’s only going to get better.\n\nAs of 2020 cencus population was 1,064,465\n\nAs of 2021, the estimated population was 1,109,462\n\nIs Collin County Urban or rural?\n\nIf you’re thinking about moving to Collin County, you might be wondering if it’s an urban or rural area. According to Census Bureau data, the answer is mostly urban. 94.76% of the county is considered urban, while only 5.24% is rural. So if you’re looking for a big city feel, Collin County is a great place to call home. But buyer beware – with such a high percentage of the county being urban, competition for housing can be fierce. So if you’re thinking about relocating to Collin County, start your search early and be prepared to act fast when you find the perfect place to call home.\n\nUrban vs Rural in Collin County\n\nPercent Urban: 94.76\n\nPercent Rural: 5.24\n\nWelcome!

The Homestead Exemption provides an exemption from property taxes on a home. Homestead exemptions remove part of your home’s value from taxation, so they lower your taxes. For example, your home is appraised at $100,000, and you qualify for a $25,000 exemption (this is the amount mandated for school districts), you will pay school taxes on the home as if it was worth only $75,000. Taxing units have the option to offer a separate exemption of up to 20 percent of the total value.\n\nA homestead can include up to 20 acres, if the land is owned by the homeowner and used for a purpose related to the residential use of the homestead. You can own multiple properties in Texas but only your primary home will be designated as homestead.\n\nYou may apply for homestead exemptions on your principal residence only.\n\nMORE from Texas Comptroller website: https://comptroller.texas.gov/taxes/property-tax/exemptions/residence-faq.php\n\nAs your Texas Relocation Specialist and Dallas-Fort Worth Real Estate Expert REALTOR® I will help you to apply for your Homestead Exemption\n\nWhen it comes to the overall school ratings in Collin County, TX, it can be subjective depending on what you are looking for specifically.
