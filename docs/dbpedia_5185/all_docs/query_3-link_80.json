        "text": "The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) announced that the All Neighbors Coalition, a collective of over 140 organizations, including the City of Dallas Office of Homeless Solutions, working in collaboration to solve homelessness in Dallas and Collin counties, will receive over $27 million in annual funding to continue and grow funding for essential existing systems services and programs.\n\nThis is a 23% increase over 2022 and a 44% increase over 2021, when Housing Forward, the backbone agency supporting the rehousing system, led the redesign of the approach to tackling homelessness by drawing on evidence-based strategies. The increase is a reward for the region’s united effort to end homelessness through cross-system partnerships with behavioral healthcare and housing agencies. The funding is part of HUD’s $3.16 billion homelessness assistance funding to communities nationwide through its Continuum of Care program which expands housing and services projects for families, survivors of domestic violence, and individuals experiencing chronic homelessness.\n\n“The All Neighbors Coalition’s collaborative efforts with area partners, including the City of Dallas, have been instrumental in driving our mission to provide housing for the homeless. Through this partnership, we are overcoming systemic barriers and developing innovative solutions that positively impact the most vulnerable in our community. By pooling our resources, knowledge, and unwavering dedication, we are revolutionizing the approach to homelessness in Dallas. This historic partnership serves as a testament to the power of entities uniting across sectors, with a shared vision, resulting in significant progress,” said Christine Crossley, Director of the Office of Homeless Solutions.\n\nPresident and CEO of Housing Forward Sarah Kahn said, ”More funding means we can scale up what works for more reductions in homelessness. Public-private partnership, united by a laser-focus on unsheltered homelessness and a commitment to evidence-based strategies, have made it possible for the All Neighbors Coalition to house more people than ever before. In the last few years alone we’ve seen a 160% increase in monthly housing placements. Together we’re focused on helping families and individuals move back into permanent homes with access to needed services.”\n\nThe All Neighbors Coalition has continued to demonstrate a solid commitment to ending homelessness resulting in a 14% reduction in unsheltered homelessness and 32% reduction in chronic homelessness last year. This funding opportunity will leverage partnerships with Dallas County, North Texas Behavioral Health Authority, and service providers to expand rehousing assistance and wrap-around services to families and individuals exiting homelessness."
