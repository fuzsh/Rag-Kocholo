        "text": "1916 County History Overview\n\nA History of Texas and Texans, Volume 2 by Frank White Johnson, 1916 sd\n\nSituated in the great agricultural belt of north Texas, Collin County's principal development and its largest resources are now in its farms. With a population of 50,000 three-fourths of its inhabitants are situated in the rural districts, and the county has developed no large cities, McKinney, the county seat, having a population of about five thousand. The county is immediately tributary to the great commercial City of Dallas, and there are numerous railroads and a large mileage of well-improved country highways to carry the produce of the farms to the nearby markets\n\nCounty was included within the area of the old Peters colony and the first settlement was made by the Throckmorton family,—one member of which, G. W. Throckmorton, afterwards became a governor of the state,—at a point ten miles north of the present City of McKinney. This settlement was made in 1841, and in that vicinity was established the Town of Buckner, for some years the only village in Collin County. Collin County was created from Fannin County in 1840 and organized in the same year, and the first courthouse was at Buckner, but subsequently was removed to the center of the county and the new town took the name McKinney, Collin County received a large share of the immigration of the '50s, and being well within the line of the frontier its population remained comparatively secure during the decade of the Civil war. The population of the county in 1850 was 1,950. During the next twenty years the settlement was rapid, and the population in 1870 was 14,013; in 1880, 25,983; in 1890, 36,736; in 1900, 50,087; and in 1910, 49,021. The population is singularly free from foreign admixture, and the last census reported only about 2,200 negroes.\n\nIn 1856 the post offices in Collin County were named Highland.\n\nMcKinney, Millwood, Piano, Rock Hill, Roseland, and Weston. Of these only three survive in the modern nomenclature of the county's important towns—McKinney, Piano and Weston. With the building of railroads, the complete occupation of the land by farmers, and the consequent shifting of population centers, the principal towns are now McKinney, Farmersville, Piano, Wylie, Nevada, Celina and Frisco, besides smaller villages at Princeton, Allen, Melissa, Prosper, Blue Ridge and Anna. In 1890 McKinney had a population of 2,489; in 1900, 4,342; and in 1910, 4,714. The population of other towns for the same years was: Farmersville, 1,093, 1,856, and 1,848; Piano, 842, 1,304, and 1,258; Wylie, 239, 773 and 620; Nevada, 247, 356 and 510. Celina had 724 inhabitants in 1910 and Frisco, 332.\n\nCollin County now has the Houston & Texas Central, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas, the Gulf, Colorado & Santa Fe, the St. Louis Southwestern, the Frisco and the Texas Traction Company's Interurban. The first railroad was the Houston & Texas Central, which reached McKinney in 1872. The second road was known originally as the East Line and Red River Railroad, the construction of which began in 1876 at Jefferson in East Texas and was built as a narrow-gauge road from Jefferson to Greenville, and about 1881 was extended to McKinney. This road became a part of the Missouri, Kansas & Texas about 1884, and was then rebuilt with the standard gauge. During 1886-87 the line of the Santa Fe was built through the county from Dallas to Paris. About the same time the St. Louis Southwestern or Cotton Belt was constructed across the southern side of the county, and in 1901 the Frisco railroad was built from Sherman south to the west side of Collin County. The interurban line of the Texas Traction Company has been in operation through Collin County, between Dallas and Sherman, for about seven years.\n\nIn 1870 the assessed value of property in Collin County was $4,114,160; in 1882, $6,391,435; in 1903, $13,176,320; and in 1913, $27,829,119. The county became well settled in the course of the decade of the '70s, and in 1882 it was stated that in many sections the public highways were lined with a succession of well tilled farms or enclosed pastures. At that time about 150,000 acres were in cultivation, less than a quarter of the total area, but the county for some years had made a record for its wheat, cotton and other products. The open range was rapidly giving way to enclosed pastures and cultivated farms, and that process has continued until by the beginning of the present century there were very few ranches containing as much as three thousand acres and small farms are the rule. The livestock of the county in 1882 comprised about 30,000 cattle, 16,000 horses and mules, 18.000 hogs, and about 2,000 sheep and goats. The only manufacturing at that time was carried on by steam flouring mills, consuming the harvests of wheat. The chief towns of the county at that time, all railroad centers, were McKinney, Piano, Allen and Melissa, while on the new East Line & Red River Railway was Farmersville.\n\nBesides its large variety of agricultural products, Collin County for some years has been a section devoted to the raising of high-grade cattle, horses and mules and other classes of livestock. Some of the best breeding animals in this state have been supplied by Collin County. The dairy industry has been developed, and the county has an important place in the Texas poultry business. The industrial statistics comprise many cotton gins, cotton-seed oil mills, a large cotton mill at McKinney and a number of flouring mills.\n\nSituated in the black lands belt, Collin County furnished a splendid array of statistics on its agricultural and livestock interests. The total area of the county is 561,920 acres, of which 501,855 acres were reported in farms in 1910. The number of farms in 1900 was 6,551, and in 1910, 6,507. The amount of \"improved land\" increased from about 378,000 acres in 1900 to about 428,000 acres in 1910. The census enumerated 16,112 cattle; about 23,000 horses and mules; 31,496 hogs; 5,530 sheep; and 263,233 poultry. In 1909 the acreage planted in cotton was 164,956; in corn, 145,656; in oats, 27,068; in wheat, 15,082; in hay, 13,547, including about 4,700 acres in alfalfa, which in recent years has become one of the most valuable crops of the county; about 1,300 acres in potatoes, sweet potatoes and other vegetables; and the fruit industry, which has not had the development in this which is found in other counties in the same section, was measured by the enumeration of about 59,000 orchard fruit trees.\n\n1904 County History Overview\n\nTexas Almanac and State Industrial Guide, Volume 1904 sd\n\nCollin County is in the northern middle section of the State, only Grayson County intervening between it and Red River on the north. There are but few lakes in the county, the principal ones being Grassy, Duck, Clear, Button and Snyder. Seven-eighths of the surface of the county is high rolling, with black waxy soil and high rolling ridges running north and south, dividing the waters of the different streams, but none of these ridges rise to the prominence of hills, although sufficiently sloping to drain the land for crops and to avoid stagnant water.\n\nPopulation in 1900, 50,089. Property assessment 1903, $13,176,320. The first permanent settlement made in the territory of which Collin County is composed was located ten miles north of the site of the present town of McKinney, when Dr. W. E. Throckmorton and family settled there, in 1841. The first legislature to meet under the constitution of the State, in 1846, created Collin County, with several others, out of the territory of Fannin, which at that time embraced all of northwest Texas. The first county seat was at Buckner, but later it was moved to the center of the county, and the new county seat was named McKinney, in honor of Collin McKinney, one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence of Texas. McKinney is 32 miles north of Dallas. The county contains 887 square miles of territory. Five-sixths of this, the eastern part, is drained by the East fork of the The county is underlain with a never failing supply of artesian water. In McKinney, at 900 to 1000 feet, there is a fine water supply for city purposes: at Farmersville, at 1800 feet, is an abundant supply; in Rockwall, just outside the county on the south, the water flows. The principal crops and the yield per acre under average conditions are: Cotton, .41 bale; corn, 30 bushels; wheat, 17; oats, 40; barley, 45; sorghum, 100 gallons; Irish potatoes. 50 bushels; sweet potatoes. 150; prairie hay. 1% tons; milo maize, 3 tons; alfalfa, 1% tons, with three cuttings. Improved farming implements are extensively used, both for preparing the ground and harvesting, and of late years land has been plowed extensively by steam, threshing engines being used to pull gangs of disc plows.\n\nThe apportionment from the State school fund, together with the revenues from the county school lands, are sufficient to run the schools an average of six months in the year; but these revenues are supplemented in more than one-half of the districts by a special school tax, ranging from 10 to 20 cents on the $100 valuation, and in these districts schools are run from seven to eight months. There are no denominational schools in the county, but there is a select school for boys and girls and a business college.\n\nPopulation in 1900, 50,089. Property assessment 1903, $13,176,320.

There are more than a score of important towns and shipping points on these lines of railroad within the county. McKinney, the county seat, has a population of about 5000, and has many substantial and pretentious business structures; a flouring mill with a capacity of 1000 barrels daily, cotton compress, cotton seed oil mill and modern public utilities."
