        "text": "Collin County is a county in the U.S. state of Texas. It is part of the Dallas-Fort Worth-Arlington metropolitan statistical area, and a small part of Dallas is in the county. At the 2020 United States census, the county's population was 1,064,465, making it Texas's sixth-most populous county and the 43rd-largest county by population in the United States. Its county seat is McKinney.\n\nHistory\n\nBoth the county and the county seat were named after Collin McKinney (1766-1861), one of the five men who drafted the Texas Declaration of Independence and the oldest of the 59 men who signed it.\n\nGeography\n\nAccording to the U.S. Census Bureau, the county has an area of 886 square miles (2,290 km2), of which 841 square miles (2,180 km2) is land and 45 square miles (120 km2) (5.1%) is covered by water.\n\nLakes\n\nLavon Lake\n\nAdjacent counties\n\nGrayson County (north)\n\nFannin County (northeast)\n\nHunt County (east)\n\nRockwall County (southeast)\n\nDallas County (south)\n\nDenton County (west)\n\nCommunities\n\nCities (shared with other counties)\n\nCities\n\nTowns\n\nFairview\n\nHebron (mostly in Denton County)\n\nNew Hope\n\nSt. Paul\n\nCensus-designated places\n\nSeis Lagos\n\nWestminster\n\nUnincorporated communities\n\nHistorical communities\n\nBuckner\n\nLebanon\n\nLolaville\n\nRenner\n\nShepton\n\nWetsel\n\nGhost towns\n\nBiggers\n\nMarilee\n\nNickelville\n\nParris\n\nRoland\n\nVerona\n\nDemographics\n\nHistorical population Census Pop. %± 1850 1,950 — 1860 9,264 375.1% 1870 14,013 51.3% 1880 25,983 85.4% 1890 36,736 41.4% 1900 50,087 36.3% 1910 49,021 −2.1% 1920 49,609 1.2% 1930 46,180 −6.9% 1940 47,190 2.2% 1950 41,692 −11.7% 1960 41,247 −1.1% 1970 66,920 62.2% 1980 144,576 116.0% 1990 264,036 82.6% 2000 491,675 86.2% 2010 782,341 59.1% 2020 1,064,465 36.1% 2023 (est.) 1,195,359 52.8% U.S. Decennial Census\n\n1850–2010 2010–2019\n\nIn 2000, the U.S. Census Bureau determined 491,675 people resided in Collin County. With the economic and population growth of the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex, its population increased to 1,064,465 at the 2020 U.S. census. The population density as of 2019 was 1,229.8 people per square mile (474.8 people/km2). Among the population, its median age was 37.3, up from the statewide median age of 35.1. Linguistically, 11.6% of the county spoke Spanish as their household language, followed by Asian and Pacific Islander languages. Altogether 29.7% of Collin County spoke a language other than English at home, contributed in part by its large foreign-born population which made up 22% of the population according to 2019 estimates from the American Community Survey.\n\nThe median income for a household in the county as of 2019 was $96,134, up from $70,835 in 2000. Families had a median household income of $113,471, married-couple families $127,575, and non-family households $53,986. An estimated 6.3% of Collin County's residents lived at or below the poverty line from 2014 to 2019. In 2000, about 3.30% of families and 4.90% of the population lived at or below the poverty line, including 5.10% of those under age 18 and 7.10% of those aged 65 and older.\n\nOf its residential properties, the median value of an owner-occupied housing unit was $354,100 in 2019, with a total of 8% of owner-occupied housing units ranging from less than $100,000 up to $200,000. In 2007, Collin County was ranked No. 21 for high property taxes in the U.S. as percentage of the homes' value on owner-occupied housing. It also tanked in the top 100 for amount of property taxes paid and for percentage of taxes of income. Part is this is due to the Robin Hood plan school financing system in Texas.\n\nRace and ethnicity\n\nDemographic Profile of Collin County, Texas\n\n(NH = Non-Hispanic) Race / Ethnicity Pop 1990 Pop 2000 Pop 2010 Pop 2020 % 1990 % 2000 % 2010 % 2020 White alone (NH) 226,654 374,116 493,492 542,472 85.84% 76.09% 63.08% 50.96% Black or African American alone (NH) 10,727 23,212 64,715 108,100 4.06% 4.72% 8.27% 10.16% Native American or Alaska Native alone (NH) 997 1,937 3,278 3,874 0.38% 0.39% 0.42% 0.36% Asian alone (NH) 7,317 33,902 87,276 188,365 2.77% 6.9% 11.16% 17.70% Pacific Islander alone (NH) N/A 194 387 613 N/A 0.04% 0.05% 0.06% Some Other Race alone (NH) 183 630 1,364 4,910 0.07% 0.13% 0.17% 0.46% Mixed Race/Multi-Racial (NH) N/A 7,174 16,475 46,973 N/A 1.46% 2.11% 4.41% Hispanic or Latino (any race) 18,158 50,510 115,354 169,158 6.88% 10.27% 14.74% 15.89% Total 264,036 491,675 782,341 1,064,465 100.00% 100.00% 100.00% 100.00%\n\nNote: the U.S. Census Bureau treats Hispanic/Latino as an ethnic category. This table excludes Latinos from the racial categories and assigns them to a separate category. Hispanics/Latinos can be of any race.\n\nAt the 2000 census, the racial and ethnic makeup of the county was 81.39% White, 4.79% Black or African American, 0.47% Native American, 6.92% Asian, 0.05% Pacific Islander, 4.26% from other races, and 2.11% from two or more races; 10.27% of the population were Hispanic or Latino American of any race. In 2019, the American Community Survey estimated its non-Hispanic white population now represented 55%, reflecting a national demographic trend of diversification. The Black or African American population grew to 10%, Asian Americans made up 16% of the population, and Hispanic or Latino Americans increased to 16% of the total population in 2019; multiracial Americans made up an estimated 2% of the county population. The largest European ancestry groups from 2014 to 2019 were Germans, English Americans, and Irish and Italian Americans. By the publication of the 2020 census, the racial and ethnic makeup of Collin County was 50.96% non-Hispanic white, 10.16% Black or African American, 0.36% American Indian or Alaska Native, 17.70% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.46% some other race, 4.41% multiracial, and 15.89% Hispanic or Latino American of any race.\n\nReligion\n\nChristianity has historically been the predominant religious affiliation among the county's residents as part of the Bible Belt. According to the 2020 Public Religion Research Institute study, non-Christian religions are present and have been growing, largely due to migration into the county; among the non-Christian population, 3% were Hindu, 2% Muslim and 2% Jewish. Overall among its Christian population, Baptists, Methodists, Catholics and non- or inter-denominational Christians have been prominent.\n\nEducation\n\nK-12 education\n\nThe following school districts lie entirely within Collin County:\n\nAllen Independent School District\n\nAnna Independent School District\n\nFarmersville Independent School District\n\nLovejoy Independent School District\n\nMcKinney Independent School District\n\nMelissa Independent School District\n\nPlano Independent School District\n\nPrinceton Independent School District\n\nWylie Independent School District\n\nThe following districts lie partly within the county:\n\nBland Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nBlue Ridge Independent School District\n\nCelina Independent School District\n\nCommunity Independent School District\n\nFrisco Independent School District\n\nGunter Independent School District (very small part)\n\nLeonard Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nProsper Independent School District\n\nRockwall Independent School District\n\nRoyse City Independent School District\n\nTrenton Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nVan Alstyne Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nWhitewright Independent School District (very small part only)\n\nIn the 1990s Plano ISD received many non-Hispanic white families leaving urban areas. From circa 1997 and 2015 the number of non-Hispanic white children in K-12 schools in the county increased by 40,000 as part of a trend of white flight and suburbanization by non-Hispanic white families; however the same number of Plano ISD in particular decreased by 10,000 in that period.\n\nColleges and universities\n\nCollin College opened its first campus on Highway 380 in McKinney in 1985. The college has grown to seven campuses/locations—two in McKinney and two in Plano and as well as Frisco, Allen, Rockwall, Wylie, Farmersville, and Celina. Collin College's official service area includes all of Collin County.\n\nDallas Baptist University also has an extension site in Frisco, DBU Frisco, as well as the University of North Texas's extension side, UNT Frisco.\n\nThe majority of the University of Texas at Dallas campus in Richardson, Texas lies within Collin County. While the main campus' address is officially within the jurisdiction of Richardson and Collin county, approximately one-third of the college is physically located within the border of Dallas county.\n\nTransportation\n\nWith the Red Line operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) ending with its northern terminus at Parker Road Station in Plano, most of Collin County is not served by any public transit agencies as of 2023. The Texoma Area Paratransit System (TAPS) transit service provided bus routes for a short period from 2013 until Collin County bus service was suspended in 2015. The North Central Texas Council of Governments (NCTCOG) in a 2022 meeting discussed the possibility of expansion of the Red Line corridor from Plano through Allen to McKinney. Either the Red Line or Silver Line could be extended north. While the Red Line could be expanded further north into Allen, Allen is currently unable to levy the 1% sales tax required to become a DART member city.\n\nMajor highways\n\nU.S. Highway 75\n\nU.S. Highway 380\n\nDallas North Tollway\n\nState Highway 190 / President George Bush Turnpike\n\nState Highway 5\n\nState Highway 78\n\nState Highway 289\n\nState Highway 121 / Sam Rayburn Tollway\n\nState Highway 66\n\nState Highway 205\n\nParks\n\nBratonia Park\n\nMyers Park\n\nParkhill Prairie\n\nSister Grove Park\n\nTrinity Trail\n\nHeard Natural Science Museum and Wildlife Sanctuary\n\nMedia\n\nCollin County is part of the Dallas/Fort Worth media market.
