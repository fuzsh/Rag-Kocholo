This city is covered by the DFW metroplex, and McKinney homes for sale are thus highly sought after and widely envied for their prime location. The homes for sale in McKinney are just a couple minutes away from at least two airports, numerous public and private educational institutions, corporate offices, shopping and dining destinations, recreational facilities, and more.\n\nAnother key benefit you stand to gain from moving into McKinney is peace of mind. There is nothing like getting a sound sleep each night, knowing that your loved ones and your property are fully protected. This is why McKinney is also home to many families with senior loved ones and young children.\n\nMcKinney Real Estate Listings\n\nMcKinney real estate listings range from the modest to the grand. You can find 2-bedroom and even 8-bedroom properties, but most listings have 3 to 4 bedrooms and 2 to 4 partial and full bathrooms. The real estate listings in McKinney vary a lot in terms of age. You can find newly constructed homes, those built several decades ago, and everything else in between.\n\nCommon features include granite countertops, built-in cabinetry, stainless steel appliances, wrought iron balustrades and fixtures, elegant chandeliers, open floor plans, game rooms, media rooms, California islands, and more.\n\nMcKinney is where you can find the Central Park Campus of Collin College. The campus of the Collin Higher Education Center has been here since 2010. The main public school district here is the McKinney ISD, to which nearly two-thirds of all McKinney households are zoned. McKinney Boyd High School is also in the ISD.\n\nThe remaining third are zoned to Frisco ISD, Prosper ISD, Allen ISD, Melissa ISD, Lovejoy ISD, and Celina ISD. These maintain fairly impressive national rankings, and they have proven their expertise in educating minds of any age. If you prefer to enroll your child in a private school, you can take them to McKinney Christian Academy or Cornerstone Christian Academy, which both offer K through grade 12.\n\nMcKinney Home Values\n\nMcKinney home values have been showing relatively good activity recently, especially since the Texas real estate market began its recent boom. The home values in McKinney are even expected to go up a bit more in the coming year, given the low foreclosure and mortgage default rates.
