        "text": "That model appeals to private equity firms coming to the city seeking acquisitions, McCollough said. “They describe that as efficient capital: Someone hasn’t raised tens of millions of dollars and burned through it all. They’ve actually built a business.”\n\nAfter the telecommunication bubble burst in 2001, the Dallas tech ecosystem, dominated by telecommunications as the home to Nokia, Samsung, and AT&T, began to diversify into software, mostly in the B2B space, explained McCollough, an empty nester who lives with his wife in a townhome in Uptown, a neighborhood near downtown known for its lively restaurant and bar scene.\n\nAmong other factors boosting the city’s software ecosystem is “exponential growth” in the University of Texas Dallas and Arlington systems, along with an influx of international students, McCollough added.\n\nIt’s difficult to discuss the technology sector without mentioning banking uncertainty. While Silicon Valley Bank had a significant presence in Dallas, it wasn’t without competitors that also serviced the technology sector, according to McCollough. “The collapse of SVB isn’t generally expected to hurt the growth prospects of the Dallas technology ecosystem.”\n\nA Small Business Destination\n\nAcross industry sectors, business leaders describe a similar trifecta transforming industry sectors: diversification, a networked do-it-yourself culture, and unrelenting growth.\n\nIncreasingly, locally owned businesses are in favor.\n\nIn the restaurant category, one of the fastest-growing segments is the independent restaurant and craft beer and spirits industries, Cotter said. “We’re seeing fewer chains, more local restaurant groups, and one-off independently owned venues.”\n\nWhile Dallas is a huge city, its culture of opportunity, along with supportive business networks (not to mention thousands of new residents clamoring for chef-driven dining experiences) drives the city’s homegrown entrepreneurial ecosystem.\n\n“People who want to start their own restaurant, distillery, or brewery can give it a shot and be creative and take a chance on something big,” said Cotter, who lives in Celina, where the fields surrounding his home sprouted 200 new houses in the past couple of years.\n\nSo many people have moved to Celina in the past 20 months that the “support services,” restaurants, banks, gas stations, have yet to move in, he said. “They’re coming. It’s crazy growth.”\n\nCorporate America Expands Its Footprint\n\nAs entrepreneurs churn out small businesses, the city is growing its reputation as a place where corporate powerhouses roam—and then settle.\n\nThe metroplex is home to 23 Fortune 500 company headquarters; 45 in the Fortune 1000. The businesses relocating and expanding here represent all manner of industry sectors, but a high concentration falls into the financial services category, with JP Morgan, Vanguard, and Wells Fargo all adding or announcing new satellite offices around the region.\n\n“The companies moving into Dallas require money and resources,” said Kalgi Ganatra, a senior manager in the Moss Adams Dallas office who serves clients in the financial services sector. “It harbors the environment for banks, credit unions, insurance companies, and fintech. They’re following the growth.”\n\n“Despite the uncertainty in the banking landscape, the need for financial institutions doesn’t go away,” Ganatra added. “I see this as an opportunity for innovation. Fintech in particular is a product of innovation related to challenges in the market that people are trying to solve.”\n\nAnother notable case in point: New York-based financial giant Goldman Sachs is slated to break ground on a $500 million office project near downtown Dallas this year. The 980,000-square-foot project will anchor an 11-acre, mixed-use redevelopment planned by Hunt Realty Investments, a centralized real estate investment management company owned by Hunt Consolidated, Inc., which is the flagship entity of the Ray L. Hunt family of companies based in Dallas.\n\nThe buildings, which comprise the largest office development in Dallas in decades, are expected to open by April 2026.\n\nEnergy Heirs Diversify into Real Estate\n\nThe Goldman Sachs project highlights one of the most significant trends reshaping the Dallas economy: the union of oil and real estate. (Hunt Consolidated companies also include oil and gas exploration and production in addition to real estate.)\n\nUnlike Houston, home to the big oil conglomerates, energy companies in Dallas have their roots in family offices. Amid a generational business and wealth transfer, heirs of these family offices have started to invest in more diversified industries, said McFarland, a former assistant controller in the energy industry.\n\nShe pointed to the ubiquitous real estate projects reshaping the region.\n\n“A lot of this is oil money,” she explained. “The children and grandchildren of families that would have invested in oil are now moving into tech, real estate, and utilities. So if you look at the metroplex, that’s part of the history that created the city. It’s a huge component of the Dallas economy.”\n\nReal Estate Moves Up, Out, and Into Mixed-Use\n\nThe modern-day Dallas real estate boom combines traditional home building with new forms of development aligned with changing demographics and the shift toward remote work.\n\nJust as Dallas is nurturing business magnates as well as entrepreneurs, legacy professional service firms, and next-generation food and tech companies, so too are real estate developers targeting a variety of housing types and styles, both traditional and innovative.\n\nFueled by a seemingly endless supply of developable land, one frontier is a new crop of outer ring subdivisions springing up in increasingly remote parts of the metroplex.\n\nSimultaneously, builders are breaking ground on more diverse, connected, and human-scale communities—a direction that’s in part a response to the COVID-19 pandemic and remote work.\n\n“The communities getting built are live, work, and play communities,” said Aidé Apodaca Gonzalez, an assurance director in the Moss Adams Dallas office who provides audit and advisory services to clients in the commercial real estate industries. “Mixed-use is the mindset.”\n\nShe pointed to Legacy West, a $3 billion mixed-use development in Plano that includes corporate offices, multifamily high-rise living, retail shopping, and restaurants. The development sits on the southwest corner of the Dallas North Tollway and Sam Rayburn Tollway, two of the many highways expanded over the past decade.\n\nFields West, another Hunt Realty Investments project, will be located near the new PGA headquarters in Frisco, and will include several thousand apartments, hotels, and office space. Frisco is already home to The Star in Frisco, the headquarters and practice facility for the Dallas Cowboys, as well as Toyota Stadium, home of the FC Dallas, the city’s Major League Soccer team.\n\nAnd that isn’t all that Frisco will have to offer.\n\nIn the latest sign that the Dallas area has become a top destination for individuals and businesses: In January 2023, Universal Resorts announced it was building a Universal Studios theme park in Frisco, expected to draw millions of visitors annually. “Frisco is attracting everything,” McCollough said. “Literally. Everything.” In fact, the Dallas Cowboys now call Frisco home.\n\nFor many newcomers, the Dallas dream is to buy a single-family home with a yard, all at an affordable price point. But with more people working from home, expectations for multifaceted living and working environments are growing, as is the demand for high-rise apartments.\n\n“We’re seeing a lot of multifamily assets,” Gonzalez observed. In fact, the Dallas-Fort Worth area leads the nation in apartment construction with more than 50,000 units currently being built; this will increase the current apartment inventory by 7.5%. Half of those units are slated to be complete in 2023.\n\nMixed Use Extends to the Office Market, Too\n\nChanges in the office market also support mixed-use development trends.\n\nIn 2022, the corporate headquarters relocation rush ebbed, and office development activity slowed as construction costs increased and companies continued to rethink their need for square footage in the wake of remote work.\n\nOffice space is sitting empty as vacancy rates remain high, said Cody Schoenig, a partner in the Dallas office of Moss Adams. “My clients in real estate understand the situation and are retooling for the future.” (Office vacancy rates in Dallas clocked in at 24%, according to a Q4 2022 report put out by JLL, a Fortune 500 commercial real estate firm.)\n\nBefore the pandemic, one of Schoenig’s commercial real estate clients started converting its portfolio to a co-working model, creating a string of flexible workspaces in suburbs across the metroplex. The business model catered to people who didn’t want to drive downtown, but the conversions accelerated as the pandemic boosted demand for workplace solutions closer to home.\n\n“Hybrid work is here to stay,” Schoenig said. “And we’re going to see a sea change in the way office space is used.”\n\nAlong with mixed-use development, Dallas is also pushing forward with new public transportation infrastructure. The Silver Line, a $1.89 billion commuter rail line, for example, will connect Plano with the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport.\n\nMany newcomers to Dallas are used to living in environments that aren’t as car dependent, said Cotter, whose sister works for Goldman Sachs, which will eventually relocate New York City employees to the new Dallas location. The region’s “biggest single need,” Cotter believes, “is mass transit.”\n\nReimagining Downtown: A Debate\n\nAs the suburbs develop, the city is also turning its attention to its central core, where billions of development dollars are in the pipeline.\n\nViews differ on the merits of the massive investment project, fueling a debate that goes beyond individual buildings to address the core identity of the metroplex: a sprawling cephalopod of an urban organism with not one beating heart but at least three or four and more like five or six.\n\nThe language people use to describe the metroplex helps visualize its unusual form: Instead of an “urban core,” McFarland said, people refer to Interstate 635 as the original Loop, which at one time was considered the limits of Dallas but it has since been supplanted by another Loop, the George Bush turnpike, even further north.\n\nHubert Zajicek, co-founder and CEO of Health Wildcatters, a health care startup accelerator that’s also a client of Moss Adams, elaborated on that description.\n\nThe distances in Dallas are so huge that it’s difficult for people to travel from one part of the metroplex to another. “What has risen out of that is that multiple sizable nodes can be sustained and built up independently of one another. The strength of the city is the distributive-ness of everything.”\n\nOthers disagree with that assessment, arguing that changing times call for a different mapping of the metroplex, both real and conceptual.\n\nSuburbs like McKinney and Allen evolved into bustling dining and entertainment destinations in their own right, Ganatra said. So has downtown Fort Worth. And available land will always make the suburbs a draw for companies looking to build out corporate campuses.\n\n“But if you want to bring in top talent,” Ganatra said, it's likely “to be a younger crowd, especially in tech, and they’re going to want to be near downtown Dallas.” Amid explosive growth, urban development isn’t an either/or, Cotter added. “For the suburbs to thrive,” he said, “downtown has to thrive as well.”\n\nCrime and homelessness remain persistent roadblocks to getting more people downtown. But even skeptics acknowledge improvements.\n\nTwenty years ago, only a few hundred people lived downtown, and the central business district emptied after 5 p.m. Today, 15,000 people and counting call the district home, construction is rife, and public spaces like the formerly “generic” farmers market, according to Ganatra, have been revamped to include eateries, high-end organic food purveyors, and boho chic shops.\n\n“You go to the farmers market, and it’s packed—just packed. It’s not just people buying groceries; people are hanging out in the restaurants, in the shops,” she said. “There has been a definite shift in how people are thinking about downtown.”\n\nIn Addition to Mixed-Use, Offices Convert to Residential Use\n\nFraming downtown redevelopment as part of the region’s innovation economy is a critical part of that shift.\n\nTo wit: Dallas is moving full steam ahead with plans to repurpose existing office towers into residential units, a real estate model that has become more popular since the pandemic.\n\nAt least five office-to-luxury apartment conversions in the central business district are underway, according to JLL, encompassing more than 2-million square feet and potentially cutting the downtown office vacancy rate by more than 6%.\n\nThe days of downtown restaurants drawing in office workers four to five days a week are long gone, said Emily Knight, president and CEO of the Texas Restaurant Association and a Dallas resident.\n\nKnight believes the district is on a path of becoming an “experiential living” neighborhood, supporting nightlife, art venues, and restaurants, along with new parks and other public amenities.\n\nBut realizing that vision, she said, hinges on the office conversions. “That’s going to be really interesting to watch.”\n\nWhat Progress Looks Like\n\nAlready, redevelopment in other central core neighborhoods is well underway.\n\nConnected to downtown by the enormously popular Klyde Warren Park, a 5.2-acre greenspace built in 2012 over a former freeway, Uptown continues to draw residents and businesses, registering the highest net absorption in the office market in 2022, according to JLL.\n\nKnown for its live music scene and eclectic restaurants, the Deep Ellum neighborhood has become a desirable office address and a magnet for tech company relocations.\n\nDeep Ellum is one of the city’s compelling growth stories, said Justin Laswell, an audit partner in the Dallas office of Moss Adams. He said one of his clients recently developed a mixed-use project encompassing two office buildings, a hotel, and retail spaces.\n\nBuilding on the success of these redevelopment projects, the city is planning a spate of new developments and infrastructure projects in the south part of downtown, with the twin goals of bringing more people to the area and spreading the wealth in the northern suburbs to low-income neighborhoods in South Dallas.\n\nDallas is one of the nation’s most racially diverse metro areas—and getting more so. Nevertheless, racial division persists across the metroplex, and economic indicators lag in South Dallas.\n\nClosing the wealth and opportunity gap in South Dallas has become imperative, noted Gonzalez. “It’s on everyone’s mind. It’s an important part of growing Dallas.”\n\nAnd there are signs of progress.\n\nThe DEC Network, an entrepreneurial support and networking organization, continues to expand its programming in South Dallas. The not-for-profit recently partnered with Charles Schwab on an initiative to help Black founders bring a business to market.\n\nThe Dallas School District is expanding its popular transformation schools initiative, aiming to reverse white flight through an academically accelerated curriculum. And in late 2023, the city will unveil Deck Park, a five-acre South Dallas greenspace over Interstate 35E that will knit together Latino neighborhoods divided by the highway.\n\nOn the real estate side, city tax incentives continue to draw new investment. For example, the planned Newpark Dallas District, a tech-centered mixed-use development south of City Hall, will net millions of dollars in grants and tax breaks in exchange for promises of job growth.\n\nIn another significant sign of progress, voters in the fall of 2022 approved a $2 billion expansion of the Convention Center featuring 1.2 million square feet of exhibit and breakout space. This project will prove to be the biggest infrastructure ever to spring up on the south side of downtown.\n\nAnd with that, the Dallas travel and tourism business has staged a comeback. The new facility, to anchor yet another redevelopment district, will enable Dallas to better compete with big cities for premium convention center opportunities, said Sino Varghese, an assurance partner in the Moss Adams Dallas office who works primarily with energy-related businesses.\n\nDallas is centrally located, said Varghese. Nevertheless, most of the big conferences bypass the metroplex for Las Vegas. The new facility will help grow market share for the meetings industry while revitalizing surrounding buildings and creating a more integrated people-friendly urban environment.\n\nThe Convention Center is “a big deal,” added Laswell. “That’s where growth downtown will start to happen.”\n\nMetroplex 2.0\n\nAmid signs of an economic slowdown, some in Dallas are asking: If you build it, will they (really) come?\n\nAnother question: How much growth can one metroplex absorb?\n\nAround the region, a framework responding to both inquiries is taking shape if not entirely coalescing. Call it metroplex 2.0: an effort to harmonize the flexibility and independence baked into the region with integrated approaches to urban development that bolster changing social and economic priorities, inside and outside the city.\n\nAround the middle of 2022, Schoenig attended a panel discussion in which the mayors of Arlington, Frisco, Addison, Fort Worth, and several other suburbs discussed incentive packages to lure new business and development.\n\n“What I found really interesting is that the panelists talked about how all of the suburbs are interconnected,” Schoenig said. “Everyone has started to realize Dallas-Fort Worth is a big place, but it’s all interconnected; so working with each other, taking the cities out of silos, and moving toward a more regional approach is what's best for Dallas.”\n\nEchoing that sentiment, McFarland said it’s important “we don't race against ourselves.”\n\nInfrastructure projects don’t happen for free, McFarland said; they’re funded by bonds and lead to property tax increases. “The reason people move to Dallas is because it’s a good value. So part of looking at all the projects we’re doing is making sure we’re not moving out of that realm of affordability.”\n\nTamela Thornton, executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth District Council of the Urban Land Institute, offers yet another variation on the theme.\n\n“For Dallas, what COVID did is force more serious introspection around the utilization of existing assets and how those all come together,” she said. The biggest challenge “is improving the connectivity between the places where people are living.” (The Loop now refers to a pedestrian and bike trail as well as a highway. The 50-mile network is intended to connect neighborhoods, green spaces, and economic opportunity, “creating a stronger and more united Dallas.”)\n\nMore than a century ago, Dallas founders parlayed the city’s rail assets into one of the world’s largest cotton markets. Today, business and civic leaders aim to leverage economic development to support local communities as well as global markets to unleash a new era of diversified business growth by connecting all of Dallas to the riches of the city.\n\nAnd all this without losing sight of the signature qualities that put the metroplex on the map in the first place.\n\n“Whether it’s autonomous cars or converting office towers to residential,” said Needs, from his vantage point in Silicon Valley, “Dallas, Texas, can do it faster, better, and cheaper.”\n\nThank you to our outside contributors:\n\nEmily Knight, president and CEO of the Texas Restaurant Association\n\nTamela Thornton, executive director of the Dallas-Fort Worth District Council of the Urban Land Institute\n\nHubert Zajicek, co-founder and CEO of Health Wildcatters\n\nProfessionals at JLL, who provided data"
