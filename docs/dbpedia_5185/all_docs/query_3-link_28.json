        "text": "Ways to\n\nGive in 2024\n\nMore North Texans are facing hardship and poverty due to the impacts of inflation and rising costs. Join us in the commitment to providing help and hope to those most vulnerable.\n\nGet Involved\n\nPoverty\n\nRoughly 10 percent of North Texans struggle against poverty every year. With a footprint across more than 4,000 square miles, no organization is better suited to serve our community. Locations throughout the North Texas area offer Christmas assistance, food pantries, and other services to help the most vulnerable members of our community.\n\nAddiction\n\nOne in five North Texas children lives in a home with drug or alcohol abuse. Our outcome-focused recovery programs offer hope and brighter futures for families across the region. Our Adult Rehabilitation Centers in Dallas and Fort Worth treat both the causes and symptoms of alcoholism and drug addiction so that children can get their parents back.\n\nHomelessness\n\nHomelessness in North Texas is a challenge we need to solve, with thousands at risk of joining the North Texans who currently find themselves without a safe place to sleep at night. This year alone, our six shelters and senior living centers have each week been housing 1,300 of our brothers and sisters living on the streets."
