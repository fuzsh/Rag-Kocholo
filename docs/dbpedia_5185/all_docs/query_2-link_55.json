        "text": "How do you know when spring has arrived in Texas? The hint of blue that begins to peek out from the once-again green grasses—bluebonnets! We have a list of our favorite locations, below, where to see bluebonnets each spring, but we first want to give a special look at where Texas’ state flower shines its brightest—in Ennis, a small town that’s only a short drive from Dallas, perfect for a Saturday excursion.\n\nDeemed the “Official Bluebonnet City of Texas” by the Texas State Legislature, Ennis boasts more than 40 miles of trails that wind throughout blossoming bluebonnets—a great getaway for a family looking to ring in the arrival of spring.\n\nBefore you hop in the car and head southeast, check the Ennis City website to ensure that the blooms are ready and waiting for you; the exact blooming dates are hard to predict due to weather, but city recommends visiting in April (you can also call the hotline, 972/878-4748). While the trails are open in April from dusk till dawn, the City of Ennis hosts the official Ennis Bluebonnet Trails Festival April 19–21, 2024 with live music, food and family entertainment in downtown Ennis.\n\nRELATED: Where to Find the Best Wildflower Sites in Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nTraverse down Highway 45 toward Corsicana, and about 40 miles south, you’ll begin to see the rolling hills of Ennis, spotted with bluebonnets. You can join a guided bus tour hosted by The Ennis Garden Club (call the Ennis Visitor Center at 972/878-4748 to reserve a seat). Or, families can park at Bluebonnet Park to roam around the trails as their own guides. Simply snag a trail map (or download online before your arrival) or download the free app named Ennis Y’all.\n\nEnnis Garden Club members will be on site at the Bluebonnet Park, should you have questions about how to get started. Several playgrounds and picnic areas are available throughout the bluebonnet trails for families (and are marked on the maps). Strollers are not recommended on these trails, unless it’s a jogging stroller; however, several trails do not allow strollers at all (only foot traffic) due to the fragile ecological environment. There are also driving trails for those who prefer to stay in their car.\n\nMore Places to See Bluebonnets\n\nFor bluebonnets closer to your neck of the woods, visit these local parks and trails known for their thick blanket of blooms during the spring. The season varies slightly each year, of course, according to the weather, so we highly recommend calling in advance to ensure the bluebonnets are in bloom.\n\nNative Texas Park at George W. Bush Presidential Center, 2943 SMU Boulevard, Dallas; 214/200-4300. This 15-acre urban nature park recreates several native Texas environments with native grasses and a wildflower meadow full of bluebonnets along a one-mile network of walking trails. Bring the kids during daylight hours, any day year-round, for a self-guided tour, or join the guided tours expected to return on Saturday mornings at 10am, March 23–June 1.\n\nArbor Hills Nature Preserve, 6701 W. Parker Road, Plano; 972/941-7250. Take the opportunity to walk through this beautiful preserve and spot some bluebonnets while you’re there.\n\nCampión Trail, Irving; 972/721-2501. Find some near the far north end where Sam Houston Trail Park is, under Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway, or south towards T.W. Richardson Park, under Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway.\n\nCedar Hill State Park, 1570 FM1382, Cedar Hill; 972/291-3900. Find some near the campsites and throughout the roads. There is a patch in the Penn Farm Agricultural History Center area as well.\n\nCoppell Nature Park, 367 Freeport Pkwy, Coppell; 972/304-3581. Find some in the small wildflower area near the parking lot.\n\nFreedom Meadow, 7599 Eldorado Parkway, Frisco; 972/292-6500. Named in memory of those we lost on September 11, 2001, this destination at the Warren Sports Complex will be covered in bluebonnets, thanks in no small part to the Frisco Garden Club.\n\nBluebonnet Trail, Spring Creek Parkway and Custer Road, Plano. While jogging on this 8.3-mile trail, you’ll most likely pass a few blooms along the way.\n\nMyers Park & Event Center, 7171 County Road 166, McKinney; 972/548-4792. Park at the Collin County Farm Museum next door and venture to the hillside overlooking the pond.\n\nRussell Creek Park, 3500 McDermott Road, Plano. Visit this park for a nice pop of blue amidst the green.\n\nThe Gardens at Texas A&M University, 556 John Kimbrough Boulevard, College Station; 979/314-2357. If you’re heading farther south, it’s worth the drive at least once to marvel the university’s signature maroon bluebonnets developed by two horticulturists back in the ‘80s. You can see the maroonbonnets—also called crimson bonnets or Alamo Fire—as well as pink and white varieties and traditional bluebonnets blooming through early to-mid April at the garden center, located behind AgriLife Center. For extra family fun, head to A&M for its 2024 Hullabloom Festival on April 20, with garden activities, crafts and butterfly releases.\n\nRELATED: Where to Find Tulips Near Dallas-Fort Worth\n\nKnow of other places where bluebonnets are blooming?
