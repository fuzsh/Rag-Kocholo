Data and schedules can change as information is updated.\n\nMany of these projects are very large and complex, so changes in funding and regional priorities can affect their status.\n\nView our implementation plan to learn more about how we continue to expand and update this online tool.\n\nWe welcome your feedback! After clicking the Project Tracker icon above, you can share your comments with TxDOT using the “Contact Us” link at the top of the page.\n\nJoint trenching opportunities\n\nIf you are a broadband provider and looking for joint trenching opportunities, please visit our Project Tracker to identify possible opportunities.
