Most flood deaths occur in vehicles.\"\n\nWhat to do if driving in the rain\n\nTurning on your headlights during daylight hours can enhance visibility and make your vehicle more noticeable to other drivers.\n\nDrive in the middle lanes and stay on high ground, as rainwater tends to accumulate at the edges of roads.\n\nSteer clear of puddles and low-lying areas of rainwater to avoid hydroplaning or losing control of your vehicle.\n\nTrucks and buses can create a water spray that obstructs your visibility.\n\nDo not drive through flooded areas, as the water's strong currents can sweep your vehicle away and cause severe damage to its mechanical and electrical systems.\n\nSee photos of damage from severe storms in North Texas"
