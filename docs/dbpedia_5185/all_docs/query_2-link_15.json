        "text": "Medical & Dental Clinics\n\nOur Safe Campus and Ann Moody Place clinics provide health assessments, screenings, immunizations and dental care to women and children in our shelter and counseling programs. We also provide health services to clients at our men's shelter.\n\nWorking with volunteer physicians and dentists from the community and UT Southwestern residents, our clinics assess needs and uncover undiagnosed issues. Our clinics also provide direction and referral for clients to access ongoing care after they leave our residential or counseling programs.\n\nAnimal Shelter\n\nOur Ann Moody Place location has an animal shelter so survivors don’t have to leave these important family members behind in danger. We are the only domestic violence service provider in the Dallas area offering this service. “Barkingham Palace” has five dog kennels and five cat towers, a Cuddle Room, a Dog Run, ADA compliant dog washing tub, storage and a workstation for the on-site kennel tech, who cares for the animals in the event that clients are unable to fully care for their pets due to stress.\n\nThrough a partnership with the SPCA of Texas, the animals in our care are seen by a vet as soon as an appointment is available and receive free shots, immunizations, wellness exams, and spay and neuter services.\n\nTransitional Housing\n\nWe provide long-term housing, education, and training to help survivors rebuild their lives with 24 on-site apartments at our Safe Campus and 10 off-site apartments.\n\nThe Family Place Supportive Living Program provides extended-stay apartments on our Safe Campus and off site as well as subsidized housing, education, training, early childhood education, K-2 school, after-school and summer programs to give survivors the time and resources to build new lives.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has recognized this program with a Best Practices Award and the Community Council of Greater Dallas honored the program with its Award for Excellence in Human Service Programming.\n\nChildren’s Educational Services\n\nThe licensed and accredited Child Development Center at our Safe Campus provides a specialized curriculum for children five and under. The program is designed to meet the unique needs of traumatized children and helps them heal and regain developmental delays.\n\nOur Safe Campus K-2 Learning Center provides an educational environment free from fear of discovery by the abuser in a two-room schoolhouse. Children in grades 3-12 receive homework help, tutoring, mentoring and playtime when they return to the Safe Campus from school. Our extensive summer programs provide enrichment and learning activities to help prevent summer slide and keep kids on track for success in school and in life.\n\nChildren’s Counseling\n\nCounseling for children is available for clients in both our residential and community-based counseling programs.\n\nOur Children’s Counseling uses play therapy and activity-based programming to help children who have witnessed family violence change the way they look at the world so they can heal. These counseling services help children learn to stay safe, stop hurting and overcome the trauma of family violence to avoid the cycle of violence as adults.\n\nIncest Recovery Services\n\nThe Family Place provides free counseling for adult and adolescent survivors of incest and childhood sexual abuse. In addition to core counseling services for adults, we offer outreach counseling, training for professionals, and educational outreach about the problems of sexual assault and incest.\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Greater Texas, Inc., has honored our Incest Recovery Services with The Katherine Ripley Award for Education.\n\nDignity at Work\n\nOur Dignity at Work job training program is a career assessment, job skills training, professional mentoring, and economic empowerment program. The primary goal of the program is to move survivors of family violence out of poverty by providing job readiness classes, participation in formal work training programs—including GED, ESL, literacy and computer classes as needed—thus enhancing their ability to gain employment and increase their income. Income stability leads to safe, long- term stability for survivors and their families.\n\nClients can participate in a four-session financial empowerment course, focused on budgeting skills, debt management and banking basics. The program also offers a four-session job readiness series that includes resume writing, interview skills and workplace etiquette.\n\nMany survivors are able to secure employment on their own using the skills learned in our job readiness program and as a result of our 1:1 job coaching. Once employment is secured, we offer weekly coaching and mentoring as needed to help victims remain stable in their new jobs. This can occur on site (at the place of employment), at The Family Place, at the home of the survivor, or on the telephone.\n\nThe program works hard to create opportunities for clients to ensure long-term success. We seek out employers who are willing to offer positions to clients and work with those employers to ensure a smooth transition.\n\nRESALE SHOP\n\nThe Resale Shop is the place for fashionable finds, home décor, and vintage finds. Whether it’s a new outfit or a whole new wardrobe, redecorating one room or redesigning your whole home, you can find it at\n\nThe Family Place Resale Shop. All proceeds support The Family Place programs and services.\n\nThe Family Place Resale Shop\n\n11722 Marsh Lane, Suite 354, Dallas, TX 75229\n\n(Marsh Lane and Forest Road - Southeast corner of the Park Forest Shopping Center behind CVS)\n\nPhone: 214-358-0381\n\nShopping Hours:\n\nMonday - Saturday: 10:00 am - 5:30 pm\n\nSunday: 12:00 pm - 5:00 pm\n\nThe Resale Shop accepts donations year-round.\n\nDonation Drop Off Days and Hours:\n\nMonday - Saturday: 10:00 am - 4:00 pm\n\nSunday: 12:00 pm - 4:00 pm\n\nFurniture donations only accepted on Wednesdays and Saturdays: 10:00 am - 1:00 pm\n\nDonation Guidelines\n\nAll items must be in closed lid containers or sealed garbage bags\n\nItems we cannot accept include:"
