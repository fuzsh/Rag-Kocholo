Academy Award-winning screenwriter Steven Zaillian, best known for his screenplay for the acclaimed Holocaust drama Schindler’s List, will receive the Writers Guild of America, West’s 2011 Laurel Award for Screen, honoring lifetime achievement in outstanding writing for motion pictures.

He will be presented with the award at the 2011 Writers Guild Awards West Coast ceremony Feb. 5 in Hollywood.

“Steven Zaillian’s best scripts not only function as intelligent, thought-provoking works that uplift and inspire audiences, but often, as in the case of his screenplays such as Schindler’s List, they act as witness to crucial chapters in our collective history. His impressive body of work provides a benchmark that all screenwriters aspire to,” said WGAW President John Wells.

In 1994, Zaillian received an Academy Award for his screen adaptation of Schindler’s List; his work on the film also earned him a Writers Guild Award (Best Screenplay, Based on Material Previously Produced or Published), a BAFTA Award (Best Adapted Screenplay), the Humanitas Prize (Feature Film), and PEN Center USA’s Literary Award.

His other screenplays include Awakenings, for which he received both Academy and Writers Guild Award nominations (Best Screenplay, Based on Material from Another Medium), The Falcon and the Snowman, Jack the Bear, and American Gangster

His co-writing screen credits include Hannibal, Clear and Present Danger, Gangs of New York and The Interpreter.
