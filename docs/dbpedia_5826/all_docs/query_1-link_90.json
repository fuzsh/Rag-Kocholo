It’s very episodic and I don’t’ know what the act structure of that movie is. I think [screenwriting classes on structure] are great if they help you think about writing, and that they get you writing, and help you organize your thoughts. But I think that there really are no rules. It’s a gut feeling. Are you lost in the story? Are people to looking at what you want them to look at? Are they in the story the way you want them to be?”\n\nDirector/Screenwriter Scott Frank (Minority Report, The Wolverine, Godless)\n\nThe Art of Screenwriting/2002 seminar\n\n(That talk/Q&A along with Steve Zaillian can be seen on Amazon Prime)"
