        "text": "BREAK out the Chianti and fava beans! “Hannibal,” the long-awaited sequel to “The Silence of the Lambs,” is coming next month – and MGM is sparing no expense to promote it.\n\n“You’d have to be living under a rock to not know about this movie,” promises the studio’s senior vice president for publicity, Amanda Lundberg.\n\nThe new adventure of flesh-savoring psychiatrist Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins re-creating his Oscar-winning role) is receiving a massive promotional push – including a top-secret Super Bowl commercial – in advance of the Feb. 9 opening.\n\nIn an unusual stunt, the studio recently sent out more than 1,200 copies of “The Joy of Cooking” (list price: $35) to journalists around the country. The packages didn’t mention the film – or even the studio – but were simply inscribed, “Bon Appetit, Hannibal Lecter M.D.”\n\nEarlier, more than 600 editors and reporters received a tape recorder (list price: $39.95). Anyone who played the tape inside heard Hopkins’ chilling metallic rasp as Lecter:\n\n“Are you back on the case?” Hannibal hisses in a message to FBI agent Clarice Starling, who he helped to catch another serial killer in the earlier film.\n\n“If so, goody, goody . . . I need to come out of retirement and return to public life.”\n\nAnother promotional item, which Lundberg refuses to identify, is on its way to the press.\n\n“We wanted to get people excited, intrigued to see the movie, and to have a little fun,” she said. “If you read [Thomas Harris’ best seller], you’ll understand what these things are. It came out of a brainstorming meeting of our staff.”\n\nMGM, hitless since “The World Is Not Enough” in November 1999, has a lot riding on “Hannibal,” which carries a reported $100 million price tag but is not a guaranteed blockbuster.\n\n“The Silence of the Lambs” took in $130 million (against a $22 million budget) and won five Academy Awards, including Best Picture – but Jodie Foster (who played Clarice), director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ted Tally, all Oscar winners, took a pass on the sequel.\n\nThere were reports that the ending of Harris’ novel left a bad taste, as it did with some book reviewers.\n\nRidley Scott, the “Gladiator” director who agreed to take up the reins, says new screenwriter Steve Zaillian (“Jurassic Park”) has come up with a different ending – but he isn’t spilling the fava beans about exactly what that might be.\n\nScott’s bigger problem was coming up with a replacement for Foster. After considering a long list of actresses – including Gillian Anderson, Angelina Jolie, Ashley Judd and Gwyneth Paltrow – he settled on Julianne Moore, who he says is “magnificent” in the part.\n\nBut will audiences accept Moore in a role so closely identified with Foster?\n\n“Look, it’s been ten years since the original and it really won’t make any difference,” predicts box-office analyst Martin Grove of Hollywoodreporter.com.\n\n“What drives this franchise is the villain. If they didn’t have Anthony Hopkins, they wouldn’t have a movie. With him back, they’ve got no problem at all.”\n\nThe film’s legendary producer, Dino De Laurentiis, concurs.\n\n“I’m 80,” he told Entertainment Weekly. “I’ve been in the movie business for over 30 years and I know this: The only thing that matters is a good director and a good story. With those two things, I could play Starling. Within two minutes, the audience will forget all about Jodie Foster – I promise you.”\n\nThe new story focuses on Hannibal, who’s been quietly living as an art restorer in Italy for years after escaping from prison. When Clarice gets into trouble at the FBI over a failed drug bust, a horribly disfigured victim of Hannibal’s – played by Gary Oldman – uses her to lure Hannibal out of hiding, so he can sic man-eating pigs on Hannibal.\n\nMGM is opening the film ultra-wide – on as many as 5,000 screens at 3,000 locations.\n\nLundberg wouldn’t say how much the studio is spending on advertising, but $30 million isn’t unusual for a major film. The 30-second Super Bowl spot alone will cost as much as $2.3 million.\n\n“The studio is really behind this one, and they’ve begun a terrific and clever marketing campaign,” says Grove.\n\n“Like most sequels, already it’s got a built-in awareness. It’s also got a hot director, and it’s going into a wide-open marketplace with no direct competition.\n\n“So I’d say there’s a potential for a $30 million opening. It looks like the year’s first blockbuster to me.”"
