        "text": "Steven Zaillian is set to chair the 2019 edition of the Ischia Global Film & Music Festival in July.\n\nThe writer, director and producer is no stranger to Ischia, an island just off the coast of Naples, and has previously been a guest of the festival as a speaker on its filmmaking and mentorship panels.\n\nZaillian is one of Hollywood’s most in-demand writers and now showrunners. He won an Oscar for best adapted screenplay for Steven Spielberg’s Schindler’s List, and was nominated for best screenplay for the films Awakenings, Gangs of New York and Moneyball.\n\nZaillian recently wrote the screenplay for Martin Scorsese’s highly anticipated film The Irishman. On the TV side, he created HBO’s hit The Night Of and wrote and directed multiple episodes, which earned him three Primetime Emmy nominations.\n\nUp next, Zaillian is set to write and direct a new series for Showtime based on Patricia Highsmith’s infamous Mr. Ripley crime novels. He is also working on a historical drama for Amazon, Cortes, based on the Spanish conquistador and starring Javier Barden.\n\n“Zaillian will be instrumental in helping create the feel of the 2019 Festival which has, over the past 16 years, gained a reputation for its celebration of big talents, its ability to identify industry priorities and its focus on human rights,” fest founder and director Pascal Vicedomini said in a statement.\n\nThe 17th edition of the Ischia Global Film & Music Festival is set to run July 14-21. The full lineup will be announced during the Cannes Film Festival."
