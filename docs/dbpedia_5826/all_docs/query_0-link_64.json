        "text": "Director\n\nTony Scott or Steven Spielberg. Why? It's a tough choice as who can direct a good Bond film. I don't really want Tamahori back. Yes, he gave us a spectacular Bond film in \"Die Another Day\" but his version of Bond (a super hero) is not the one for me. (Give me Martin Campbell for a good Bond director.) Seeing as how Campbell won't return, why not try Scott or Spielberg? Scott has a large list of hit films. Yes, his films are dark in color but are sharp directed and hard to pass up. As for Spielberg, why the hell not?! He's always wanted to direct a Bond feature. Everyone knows Spielberg is capable of a Bond film. Give it to him already!\n\nScreenwriter\n\nMichael Frost Beckner Why? Frankly, the guy is a huge buff on the spy game. He wrote the amazing intelligence film \"Spy Game\" with Robert Redford and Brad Pitt. Beckner is a whiz when it comes to drama and spy tactics. That's something that Bond has been lacking for a long long time. Plus, Beckner could bring Bond back down to Earth and make him a serious intelligence agent rather than another super hero dodging bullets and bombs.\n\nCinematographer\n\nDavid Tattersall. Why? I think his reputation proceeds him. He had a very sharp eye in \"Die Another Day\" and his work is hard to beat. Bring him back!\n\nFilm Editor\n\nAnyone but Christian Wagner. Nuff Said!\n\nWhat do you all think of that list?\n\nOK...here's my list\n\nDirector: Vic Armstrong. The man is the series. Period. Let him have his chance to control the *entire* movie and we could be in for one hell of a Bond film.\n\nScreenwriters: John Cox and Charles Axworthy. Why? Because they are talented (like P&W), and in addition (and unlike afore mentioned writers of TWINE and DAD), Cox and Axworthy are true fans.\n\nCinematographer: Roger Pratt. He has done some classic films (the 1989 version of \"Batman\" for example), and serious drama (\"Chocolat\" and \"Iris\"), so he is well versed for the dual nature of Bond films.\n\nFilm Editor: Ray Lovejoy. The man knows how to take complicated scenes and make them work.\n\nCostumes: Lynn Hemming. Why mess with perfection? But here's hoping Ralph Lauren gets to contribute some stuff.\n\nSecond Unit Director: James Armstrong. Like father, like son....\n\nStunt Coordinator: Simon Crane. It's time he got that big promotion.\n\nProduction Designer: Peter Lamont. Nobody does it better.\n\nI think I covered all the major bases.\n\n-- Xenobia\n\nOriginally posted by Xenobia\n\nScreenwriters: John Cox and Charles Axworthy. Why? Because they are talented (like P&W), and in addition (and unlike afore mentioned writers of TWINE and DAD), Cox and Axworthy are true fans.\n\nWow! I just found this thread. Must have have missed it during the holiday rush.\n\nVery sweet of you Xen, but I don't think we're very high on MGM's wish list.\n\n...Then again, if we could have a few pints with Pierce and get Michael & Barbara to give us a shot (gratis with a back-end deal if they go for it) who knows?\n\nTime to dig out my outline and 15 pages of....\n\n(dramatic pause)\n\nJames Bond in \"NONE SHALL REGRET\"\n\nDirector: JOHN McTIERNAN\n\nScreenplay: STEVEN ZAILLIAN\n\nStory: RAYMOND BENSON\n\nProducers: MICHAEL G. WILSON and BARBARA BROCCOLI\n\nMusic: JOHN BARRY\n\nDirector of Photography: CHRISTOPHER DOYLE\n\nEditor: MICHAEL KAHN\n\nProduction Designer: KEN ADAM\n\nThat's my dream list, \"dream\" being the operative word.\n\nGreat list Loomis!\n\n*Bryce sets down outline having re-read it after 6+ months*\n\nDamn if I haven't written an interesting outline....\n\nPlot, weapon of mass destruction - great delivery device, bad guy, henchmen, bad girls (yes there are two), questionable good girl, allies, traitors, exotic (un-tapped) locales, casino scene, gadgets, action sequences (3 chases, 4 fights and finale), M, Q, Moneypenny...although DAD beat me to the punch on a couple of things...\n\nhint: anyone seen pics of the new Bentley coupe? Heh-heh-heh...Eon may have to rethink their deal with Aston Martin;)\n\nHmmmm\n\nDirecter: Martin Campbell\n\nScreenplay: Bruce Feirstein with Tom Mankiewicz or Christopher Wood\n\nStory: Michael France\n\nProduction Designer: Peter Lamont\n\nMusic: David Arnold\n\nOriginally posted by Bryce (003)\n\nPlot, weapon of mass destruction - great delivery device, bad guy, henchmen...\n\nSounds like Bond hunting for Saddam\n\nDirector: John Boorman\n\n2nd Unit: Vic Armstrong\n\nCinematographer: David Tattersall\n\nCostumes: Liddy Hemmings\n\nMusic: Daivd Arnold/John Barry\n\nProduction Designer: Peter Lamont\n\nStunt Co-ordinator: Simon Crane\n\nScreenplay: MIchael France , Neal Purvis ,Robert Wade .\n\nGreat topic. Here's my 2 cents.\n\nDirector\n\nMy first choice would be Brit director Anthony Minghella. Director of the Academy Award winner 'The English Patient' and the Hitchcockian 'The Talented Mr. Ripley.\n\nLike many of his peers, he's experienced with both action and actors, but Minghella brings something else to a Bond film; style. Minghella is the closest thing to a modern day Terence Young as you can get. A well-read man, who has seen the world. He briefly worked as a university professor where he started writing music and plays. He won the London Theater Critics Award for Most Promising Playwright and for Best Play.\n\nThere's a real sense of escapism in his films. Something the latter Bond films lack I think. His good taste and eye for locations could deliver a terrific Bond film.\n\nScreenwriter\n\nAlthough Minghella usually writes his own screenplays, let's keep this simple and discuss just one writer; Tom Stoppard. An amazing Academy Award winning writer, who was responsible for modern classics like 'Brazil', 'Empire of the Sun' & 'Shakespeare in Love'. Wrote two of the best Bondian thrillers not part of the franchise; 'The Russia House' starring Sean Connery & 'Enigma' directed by Michael Apted. Perfect for the job.\n\nCinematographer\n\nJohn Mathieson. His impressive camerawork in 'Plunkett and Macleane' caught both my attention and also (more importantly) Ridley Scott, who hired Mathieson for 'Gladiator' & 'Hannibal'. The intimate film 'K-PAX' proved you don't need a big canvas to shoot terrific images.\n\nCrashDive what happen to Roger Donaldson . I saw your name and was interested to see what you would have written about your favorite future Bond director. What's up ?\n\nOriginally posted by kevrichardson\n\nCrashDive what happen to Roger Donaldson.\n\nDonaldson is my favorite realistic candidate (based on past precedent). Minghella would be my real first choice. But since Minghella is an auteur filmmaker, it won't happen."
