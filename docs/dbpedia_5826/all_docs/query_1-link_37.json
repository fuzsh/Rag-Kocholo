        "text": "ASK a studio mogul, top producer or agent for the names of the superior screenwriters in Hollywood, and Steven Zaillian will be near the top of the list.\n\n''He's one of the two or three best screenwriters in town, and I'm being liberal when I say that,'' said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, which made ''A Civil Action,'' the newest film written and directed by Mr. Zaillian. ''There's an economy and clarity to his writing that's always entertaining.''\n\nMr. Zaillian, who won an Academy Award for his adaptation of ''Schindler's List,'' is a surprisingly diffident, almost modest and entirely un-Hollywood figure. In contrast to other screenwriters, who may earn lavish sums but complain all the way to the bank about their plight at the hands of producers, stars and executives, Mr. Zaillian, 45, shrugs off any problems he has faced over his 18-year career. ''Maybe I've been lucky,'' he said one recent morning as he sat drinking coffee on the patio of a house in Mandeville Canyon where he and his small staff were editing ''A Civil Action.''\n\n''I mean, not every script I've worked on has turned out the way I've wanted them to turn out,'' added Mr. Zaillian. His screenplay for ''Awakenings'' (1990) earned him an Academy Award nomination, and he also wrote such films as ''The Falcon and the Snowman,'' ''Mission Impossible'' and ''Clear and President Danger.''\n\nBut, he went on, ''If you're going to write and not control it then, somehow, you've got to expect that sometimes it's going to turn out different than you thought. Sometimes worse. And sometimes better, if the director is, like, really good and brings something to it,'' Mr. Zaillian said.\n\n''A Civil Action,'' adapted by Mr. Zaillian from the Jonathan Harr nonfiction legal drama that was on The New York Times best-seller list for two years, opens in New York and Los Angeles on Dec. 25, in order to qualify for Academy Award nominations, and then will open nationwide in January.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
