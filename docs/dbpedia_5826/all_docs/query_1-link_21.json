        "text": "Steven Zaillian makes the process look easy. But developing a cohesive and coherent script for A Civil Action, was as difficult, he says, as working with Schindler's List, for which he won an Academy Award.\n\nAsk a studio mogul, top producer or agent for the names of the superior screenwriters in Hollywood, and Steven Zaillian will be near the top of the list.\n\n\"He's one of the two or three best screenwriters in town, and I'm being liberal when I say that,\" said Joe Roth, chairman of Walt Disney Studios, which made A Civil Action, the newest film written and directed by Zaillian.\n\nZaillian, who won an Academy Award for his adaptation of Schindler's List, is a surprisingly diffident, almost modest and entirely un-Hollywood figure. In contrast to other screenwriters, who may earn lavish sums but complain all the way to the bank about their treatment at the hands of producers, stars and executives, Zaillian, 45, shrugs off any problems he has faced over his 18-year career.\n\n\"Maybe I've been lucky,\" he said. \"I mean, not every script I've worked on has turned out the way I've wanted it to turn out.\"\n\nHis screenplay for Awakenings (1990) earned him an Academy Award nomination, and he also wrote such films as The Falcon and the Snowman, Mission Impossible and Clear and Present Danger.\n\nA Civil Action deals with an eight-year fight by working-class families in Woburn, Mass., who claimed that two large corporations had contaminated their town's drinking water with chemicals, causing the deaths of five children and one adult.\n\nThe central figure in the film is Jan Schlichtmann, a self-possessed personal injury lawyer who becomes consumed by the case at the cost of virtually everything else in his life.\n\nWhen he first read the book, Zaillian had doubts.\n\n\"I didn't know if it would make a movie at all,\" he said. \"It was a wonderful book, but what was troubling about it for a movie was the sheer length of it, the number of characters, and it wasn't a whodunit. It was more about the process of the law _ and is that dramatic?\"\n\nZaillian smiled. \"Also, there was the fact that everybody loses, at least on the face of it,\" he said. \"That's not usually the typical movie fare. It's a tragedy. I mean, that was the thing that we all had to keep in mind. I mean, it's really kind of remarkable that the studio let us do it.\"\n\nHe had handled the adaptation much the way he had dealt with Schindler's List, the Thomas Keneally novel based on the Holocaust. For both screenplays he rigorously concentrated on the main character and avoided the pitfalls of trying to tackle the enormity of the historical circumstances.\n\n\"I wanted to focus on Schindler, and Schindler alone, and imagine events almost entirely through his eyes,\" Zaillian said of the German profiteer who saves the lives of more than 1,000 Jews during World War II.\n\n\"It's such an imposing subject that you can be overwhelmed by trying to tell too much of it and having too many angles on it. The point was to follow him, just follow him, stick with him, and what he learns about the subject, you learn. The same is true of this one.\"\n\nIn shaping the script for A Civil Action, Zaillian said, the environmental drama and the legal story, and even the human tragedies, were secondary to the story of one man's obsession with the case. \"It's ultimately his story,\" he said.\n\nZaillian's 1993 directorial debut was a gentle family drama with an unfortunate title, Searching for Bobby Fischer, which was far less about chess than about a family's relationships. Few films opened that summer with higher critical praise, but it proved a box-office disappointment.\n\nHe said the sheer difficulty of being a director had surprised him, and that was why it took him so long to take over another project. \"Being a director you face the pressure, the hours, the staying focused for six straight months or much longer on one thing, just so focused with a lot of money being spent. It took a lot out of me, and I didn't want to do it again. I just wanted to write a couple of scripts after that.\"\n\nHe is loath to analyze what makes a great screenplay. \"Every time I do it, it feels like the first time and I'm scared and I don't know if it's going to turn out. And if I get to page 50 or so and I'm not enjoying it, then I know it's not working.\"\n\nZaillian, who is married and has two sons, grew up in Los Angeles. After he graduated from San Francisco State University in 1975, an interest in making documentaries led him to a series of low-level film editing jobs. Then a script he wrote in 1979 called Bad Manners, about high school boys in the late 1960s, caught the attention of a producing company. Soon, Zaillian was being hired to write scripts.\n\nBeside being relatively modest, Zaillian is also surprisingly loyal, at least by Hollywood standards. Although any of the major talent agencies would welcome the high-priced Zaillian as a client, he has remained loyal to Harold Greene, his first agent, who is now in his mid-80's and who runs a one-man agency in Marina del Ray, Calif.\n\n\"If I'm missing something, I don't know what it is,\" Zaillian said, smiling: \"I always think I'm working on the best things that are being done out there. I haven't worked on anything because I needed the money or done something that I didn't believe in.\""
