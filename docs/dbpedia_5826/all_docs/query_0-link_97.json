        "text": "So where did David Mamet – the Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright famous for his tough, profanity-spewing characters – find inspiration for “Heist,” his ninth effort as a film writer-director?\n\n“I’ve been stuck lately watching cartoons with my kids at 6 o’clock in the f—ing morning,” Mamet says with a laugh; the youngest of his four kids are 4 and 6.\n\n“What’s better than a Road Runner cartoon? It’s got the best line of dialogue ever written – ‘Beep, beep.’ The gag’s always the same, but they make you laugh every time.”\n\nYou could argue that Gene Hackman plays the Road Runner in “Heist,” as a veteran crook who is coaxed into one last big score – a plane load of gold from Switzerland – by the film’s Wile E. Coyote, his conniving longtime fence, portrayed by Danny DeVito.\n\nBut nobody will ever mistake “Heist” for a cartoon.\n\nIn “Heist,” as in Mamet’s most famous plays, like “Glengarry Glenn Ross,” F-words and fists fly freely. DeVito’s character at one point manhandles Hackman’s moll, who is played by Mamet’s wife, Rebecca Pidgeon.\n\n“I gotta tell you,” DeVito says. “You get very cautious when you have to slug the director’s lady on screen.”\n\nMamet and DeVito have collaborated before – Mamet wrote the screenplay for “Hoffa,” the DeVito-directed biopic that starred Jack Nicholson as the union leader.\n\n“I love David’s words,” said DeVito, who, at 56, is three years Mamet’s senior.\n\n“When you first read them, they look a little bit tough. But then they just feel right to say, and boy, do they make an impression when they land.”\n\nThe bearish Mamet is less intimidating than you’d expect from America’s most-honored working playwright, who’s been directing movies since 1987’s “House of Games.”\n\nHe’s also written screenplays for numerous films he didn’t direct – including “Wag the Dog” and the recent blockbuster “Hannibal.” Mamet politely declines to discuss that movie – his screenplay was rewritten by Steven Zaillian – on the record.\n\n“Heist,” Mamet says more seriously, was born of his desire to do something in the vein of ’40s black-and-white thrillers – something he announces at the outset with the old black-and-white Warner Bros. logo (the one without the clouds in the background) and Max Steiner’s vintage musical fanfare.\n\n“I always got so excited when I heard that fanfare,” said the Chicago native. “I thought I was going to see a tough movie. With ‘Heist,’ I really wanted to make a tough movie about tough guys, not something sentimental about crooks with a lighter side.”\n\nIt’s hard to know if Mamet’s kidding when he compares his love of filmmaking – “it’s the most fun” – with criminals’ love of crime.\n\n“If they put their energy into legal pursuits, they’d probably make more money. But they don’t want to make more money; they want to be criminals. Because it’s the best life, as far as they’re concerned.”\n\nMamet is content dividing his time between the stage – he’s preparing a free-verse version of “Dr. Faustus” to be presented at the Young Vic in London – and the movies.\n\n“I’m writing a movie called ‘Dentists With Guns,’ kind of my homage to the pharmaceutical industry, that I hope will star Dustin Hoffman and Steve Martin. But first I’ve got to find a sucker to give me the money.”\n\nFirst up is a Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde movie set in Edwardian London and starring Jude Law, which Mamet hopes to film next year.\n\nMamet’s longtime friend and collaborator, actor William H. Macy, says, “It’s tough to be around him because he’s a rootin’-tootin’ genius. He speaks several languages, has an encyclopedic memory – and when you try be funny around him, he’ll just hand you your head, he so quick-witted.\n\n“Having said that, he’s also a pussycat, very fragile. It’s very easy to hurt his feelings by not liking his work – or telling him that his pants make him look fat. He’ll cry.”\n\nThe famous Mamet wit surfaces again when he’s asked about what it was like shooting “Heist” in Montreal (which doubles for Boston, where he lives) at the same time “The Score,” which has a similar theme, was filming there in the summer of 2000?\n\n“It was a dog-eat-dog world,” he said dryly. “We’d meet at the Company Canteen, a restaurant, and we exchanged ideas over vodka and ate a lot of crab cakes.\n\n“There were a lot of films shooting in Montreal. They were trying to get all the filming done in Canada because there was a notion they might close the country down. I don’t believe that, because then there’d be nothing to stop America from drifting into the Arctic Circle.”\n\nMaybe it’s because he’s near the end of two days of interviews, but Mr. Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright is clearly not in a serious mood.\n\nSo then, what single thing would he do to improve American movies?\n\n“That’s a very good question,” he said mock-tugging at his beard and pausing for effect.\n\n“I’d take the flying monkeys out of ‘The Wizard of Oz’ digitally. Because they scare the s— out of me!”"
