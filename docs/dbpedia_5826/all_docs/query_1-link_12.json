        "text": "From the homicide swaps of Bruno & Guy in Strangers on a Train to the identity swaps throughout the Tom Ripley novels, Patricia Highsmith was a master of the pulpy yet literary mid-century thriller. Her worlds were replete with morally ambiguous but undeniably attractive characters, and her stories have been catnip for filmmakers ever since. Highsmith’s treacherous thrillers have drawn some of film’s most accomplished storytellers and cinematic stylists, from Alfred Hitchcock (Strangers on a Train), Wim Wenders (The American Friend), Todd Haynes (Carol), and now, with his new twist on Highsmith’s most iconic creation, Steven Zaillian (the upcoming Ripley).\n\nSteven Zaillian has been one of Hollywood’s most accomplished and respected filmmakers for decades, winning an Academy Award for his screenplay for Schindler’s List in 1993, as well as writing and directing the Oscar-nominated Searching for Bobby Fischer, in the same year. Ever since, Zaillian has proven himself a master of adaptation, writing screenplays for The Irishman, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo, American Gangster, and many others, and garnering four additional Oscar nominations for screenwriting.\n\nNow Zaillian has turned his focus to Highsmith’s singular anti-hero, Tom Ripley, in a new adaptation of Highsmith’s best-known work. To celebrate the occasion of Ripley (a new limited series premiering on Netflix on April 4), the Paris Theater is proud to present CRISS CROSS, seven classics from two of our favorite storytellers, numbering troubled doubles, unreliable narrators, and unimagined betrayals among them.\n\nFriday, March 29:\n\nStrangers on a Train (35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 12:00 pm\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (35mm, 2011, Dir David Fincher) at 2:40 pm\n\nSearching for Bobby Fischer (35mm, 1993, Dir Steven Zaillian) at 6:10 pm\n\nCarol (2015, Dir Todd Haynes) at 8:50 pm\n\nSaturday, March 30:\n\nThe American Friend (1977, Dir Wim Wenders) at 12:00 pm\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (35mm, 2011, Dir David Fincher) at 3:00 pm\n\nStrangers on a Train (35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 6:25 pm\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (35mm, 2011, Dir David Fincher) at 9:00 pm\n\nSunday, March 31:\n\nSearching for Bobby Fischer (35mm, 1993, Dir Steven Zaillian) at 12:00 pm\n\nStrangers on a Train (35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 2:40 pm\n\nThe Irishman (2019, Dir Martin Scorsese) at 5:10 pm\n\nAmerican Gangster (2007, Ridley Scott) at 9:30 pm\n\nMonday, April 1:\n\nAmerican Gangster (2007, Ridley Scott) at 12:00 pm\n\nCarol (2015, Dir Todd Haynes) at 3:30 pm\n\nAmerican Gangster (2007, Ridley Scott) at 6:20 pm\n\nCarol (2015, Dir Todd Haynes) at 9:45 pm\n\nTuesday, April 2:\n\nStrangers on a Train (35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 1:00 pm\n\nSearching for Bobby Fischer (35mm, 1993, Dir Steven Zaillian) at 3:30 pm\n\nThe American Friend (1977, Dir Wim Wenders) at 6:10 pm\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (35mm, 2011, Dir David Fincher) at 9:05 pm\n\nWednesday, April 3:\n\nThe American Friend (1977, Dir Wim Wenders) at 12:00 pm\n\nThe Irishman (2019, Dir Martin Scorsese) at 2:40 pm\n\nCarol (2015, Dir Todd Haynes) at 9:25 pm\n\nThursday, April 4:\n\nThe Irishman (2019, Dir Martin Scorsese) at 12:00 pm\n\nThe American Friend (1977, Dir Wim Wenders) at 4:10 pm\n\nCarol (2015, Dir Todd Haynes) at 7:05 pm\n\nThe American Friend (1977, Dir Wim Wenders) at 9:50 pm\n\nSaturday, April 6:\n\nStrangers on a Train (35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 12:00 pm\n\nThe Irishman (2019, Dir Martin Scorsese) at 2:30 pm\n\nStrangers on a Train(35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 6:45 pm\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (35mm, 2011, Dir David Fincher) at 9:10 pm\n\nSunday, April 7:\n\nThe American Friend (1977, Dir Wim Wenders) at 2:45 pm\n\nCarol (2015, Dir Todd Haynes) at 5:40 pm\n\nAmerican Gangster (2007, Ridley Scott) at 8:25 pm\n\nMonday, April 8:\n\nStrangers on a Train (35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 10:00 am\n\nSearching for Bobby Fischer (35mm, 1993, Dir Steven Zaillian) at 3:20 pm\n\nThe Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (35mm, 2011, Dir David Fincher) at 6:00 pm\n\nStrangers on a Train (35mm, 1951, Dir Alfred Hitchcock) at 9:10 pm\n\nWednesday, April 10:\n\nCarol (2015, Dir Todd Haynes) at 1:00 pm\n\nThe American Friend(1977, Dir Wim Wenders) at 3:45 pm & 9:35 pm"
