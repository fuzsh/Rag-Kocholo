SHE PUSHES BRIGHAM OFF TO THE SIDE OF THE DOOR, AND UNHOLSTERS HER PISTOL. BEAT. STARLING LOOKS AT BRIGHAM WHO LOOK UNCOMPREHENDING. ANOTHER CAR IS HEARD COMING UP THE ROAD, AND WE SEE ITS HEADLIGHT SHINE ON AND REFLECT FROM A MIRROR INSIDE STARLING'S DOOR. BRIGHAM LEADS STARLING INTO THE HOUSE. HE CLOSES THE DOOR, AND TAKES HER TO THE SOFA. SHE SITS, AND PICKS UP A PHOTOGRAPH IN AN EASELFRAME FROM THE COFFEETABLE. STARLING (cont'd) Hey, now, what was I afraid of...

EMERGING FROM A THICK WOODS, THE CAR IS HINGED BY THE CAMERA ONTO THE PARK OF A COUNTRY ESTATE, THE CAR DISAPPEARS INTO A SMALL DIP IN THE LANDSCAPE. ANGLE EXT THE CAR, AT A GATEHOUSE, PREVIOUSLY HIDDEN BY THE CONTOUR OF THE LAND. WE SEE A SMALL DECREPIT GATEHOUSE IN STONE, AND, BEYOND IT, A FLIMSY AND ANCIENT BARRICADE, AN OLD GAMEKEEPER TYPE IN TWEEDS COMES OUT OF THE GUARDHOUSE. HE IS CARRYING A MUG OF COFFEE AND HAS A NAPKIN TUCKED INTO HIS COLLAR. HE REMOVES THE NAPKIN AND APPROACHES THE CAR. STARLING FLASHES HER CREDENTIALS TO THE OLD MAN, WHO HOLDS A CLIPBOARD. STARLING Special Agent Clarice Starling, to see Mason Verger. THE MAN AMBLES BACK INTO THE GATEHOUSE. ANGLE INT THE GATEHOUSE, THE OLD MAN ENTERS, AND CAMERA PULLS BACK TO SHOW, IN A ROOM OFF THE MAIN ROOM, THE FIT BODYGUARD TYPES, WATCHING STARLING ON A TV MONITOR. THERE IS A RAFT OF ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT IN THE ROOM, AND A RACK WITH SEVERAL ASSAULT RIFLES ON IT. ONE OF THE GUARDS IS TYPING ONTO A COMPUTER TERMINAL. HE LOOKS AT THE RESULT, AND GLANCES UP AT STARLING, ON THE SCREEN, AND NODS \"OKAY\" TO THE OLD MAN. THE OLD MAN AMBLES OUT TO THE BARRIER, HAVING PICKED UP AN OLD CLIPBOARD AT WHICH HE SQUINTS. THEN, SATISFIED, HE RAISES THE BARRIER, AND STARLING'S CAR GOES THROUGH. EXT A MAGNIFICENT COUNTRY ESTATE HOUSE. A POTATOCHIP VAN IS PARKED TO ONE SIDE IN THE WIDE DRIVE. AN OLD RETAINER HOLDS OPEN THE DOOR FOR STARLING, AS SHE EXITS FROM HER SEDAN, AND HE SHOWS HER INTO A LARGE OPEN MORNING ROOM, IN WHICH WE FIND TWENTY YOUNG CHILDREN OF VARIOUS RACES, ROMPING ON A SELECTION OF NEW TOYS. CAMERA TAKES STARLING THROUGH A MODERN KITCHEN, WHERE SEVERAL WHITE UNIFORMED COOKS ARE WORKING HAPPILY, ONE IS OPENING A VAST TIN OF POTATOCHIPS. ONE OF THEM IS REMOVING A TRAY OF COOKIES FROM THE OVEN, SEVERAL TYKES WAIT HAPPILY NEARBY. THE COOK WITH THE TRAY OF COOKIES GIVES STARLING A WIDE GRIN. THE RETAINER TAKES STARLING PAST THE KITCHEN, TO A DOUBLE DOOR, WHICH HE OPENS TO REVEAL A CORRIDOR BEYOND, AND A LARGE FIT MAN IN HIS THIRTIES, WEARING AN ORDERLY'S WHITES, COMING TOWARD THE CAMERA. CORDELL Agent Starling, would you come with me...? CORDELL BOWS TO THE OLD RETAINER, WHO RETIRES. CORDELL AND STARLING WALK DOWN THE CORRIDOR. STARLING The children...? CORDELL ...they're from Baltimore.... STARLING I've never heard that he... CORDELL It's not something he wants to publicize, Ma'am. It's just something he does. BEAT. STARLING I won't take much of his time. CORDELL He's glad to help. ...it's just a question of his physical condition. You Understand... CAMERA TAKES STARLING DOWN A CORRIDOR LINED WITH HUNTINGPRINTS. AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR AN OLD WOMAN SITS IN A WOODEN CHAIR, KNITTING. THEY HAVE STOPPED. WAITING FOR THE WOMAN TO LOOK UP. STARLING'S GAZE IS DRAWN BY AN OLD, CREWEL-WORK \"SAMPLER\" FRAMED ON THE WALL BY THE OLD WOMAN'S CHAIR. AND OBVIOUS ANTIQUE. IT READS: \"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY. DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY.\" ANGLE ON CORDELL AND STARLING, AS STARLING LOOKS AT THE SAMPLER, AND THE OLD WOMAN LOOKS UP FROM HER KNITTING. SHE SITS IN FRONT OF A HALF-OPENED DOOR, WHICH WE SEE IS THE DOOR TO A LINEN CLOSET. CORDELL (cont'd) ...y'get enough breakfast, Rosie...? BEAT. XCU ON THE OLD WOMAN, AS SHE LOOKS AT STARLING, AND THEN NODS TO CORDELL, AS IF TO SAY, \"THAT IS THE CORRECT CODE.\" ANGLE INS. HER HAND DROPS TO THE BACK OF THE WOODEN CHAIR, AND PRESSES A BUTTON CONCEALED IN THE LEG. ANGLE THE GROUP IN THE CORRIDOR, THE \"LINEN CLOSET,\" OPENS, TO REVEAL, BEYOND IT, WHAT APPEARS TO BE A SURGICAL FACILITY, OR HIGH-TECH HOSPITAL ROOM. INT THE HIGHTECH ROOM. THERE IS A NURSE, SITTING AT A STATION, MONITORING VARIOUS LIFESIGN DISPLAYS. SHE LOOKS UP BRIEFLY, AS CORDELL AND STARLING ENTER . NURSE (TO CORDELL) Five minutes... CORDELL NODS, AND TAKES STARLING DEEPER INTO THE ROOM. WE BEGIN TO HEAR THE SUSURRUS OF A MECHANICAL BREATHING APPARATUS. CAMERA GOES WITH STARLING INTO THE ROOM, WHERE WE SEE A HOSPITAL BED, WITH A SCREEN IN FRONT OF IT, AND VARIOUS TELEVISION DISPLAYS ABOVE IT, ANGLED TO BE SEEN FROM THE BED. STARLING APPROACHES THE BED, AND LOOKS DOWN AT THE FIGURE IN IT. WE SEE HER FACE, BUT THE FIGURE IS SCREENED. THE FIGURE, VERGER, SPEAKS BREATH BY BREATH, WITH AN OBVIOUS ELECTRONIC ENHANCEMENT. VERGER Aren't they beautiful, Miss Starling... STARLING LOOKS UP AT THE CHILDREN PLAYING. ANGLE HER POV. ONE OF THE CHILDREN FALLS OFF A SMALL PLASTIC SLIDE, AND CRIES, A NURSE RUNS TO HIM. VERGER (cont'd) Well, now, you see, one of them's hurt. And what will make it better? Love. Isn't that odd. (PAUSE) He think's he's hurt his knee--but the assurance, the assurance, the assurance that someone cares (WHEEZE WHEEZE) Suggests the hurt was elsewhere. STARLING Mr. Verger, thank you for your time. VERGER For the worst hurt, of course, that which will not heal, is the conviction no one cares. STARLING I've come to see you, sir, about an Auction... SHE HOLDS UP THE CATALOGUE TO HIM. ANGLE INS \"DRAWINGS AND MEMORABILIA RELATING TO THE SERIAL KILLER, HANNIBAL LECHTER.\" ANGLE ON CORDELL, AS HE COMES CLOSE, DONNING SURGICAL GLOVES, AND TAKES THE CATALOGUE, AND HOLDS IT TOWARD VERGER. VERGER Ah, yes, ah yes. Our Doctor Lechter... And have they sent you, once again to capture him? How terrible for you... STARLING No, sir, it's not my job to capt... why do you say how terrible? VERGER Because we must leave the past in the past. (WHEEZE WHEEZE) (CORDELL TURNS A PAGE) Ah. And here we have artifacts of, yes, my own encounter with him... CORDELL TURNS THE PAGE QUICKLY. VERGER (cont'd) No, no. That's alright. Yes. Lechter's drawings of me. Before... and, of course, after... Now: you are not sent to pursue him. Then your visit baffles me. STARLING Sir, various drawings, done by Dr. Lechter, while in prison, stolen from the prison after his escape, have surfaced and are being sold at auction. Several large reserve bids have been placed on them. I have to ask if you've placed those bids. VERGER Because? STARLING Because if it was not you, then, perhaps it was Dr. Lechter, trying to reclaim his own property. VERGER And why would you suspect me, of this ghoulishness? STARLING Because, sir, you are the only one of his victims who lived. And because you have large resources. VERGER Large resources, Starling, which I prefer to devote elsewhere.... STARLING LOOKS UP, AS WE SEE THE IMAGE ON THE TELEVISION CHANGE TO THE CHILDREN EATING THE COOKIES, AND THE IMAGE CHANGES AGAIN TO SHOW A SMALL DISPENSARY, AND THE KNEE OF THE CHILD WHO FELL BEING BANDAIDED BY A NURSE. STARLING Due respect, sir... SHE PRODUCES A COPY OF THE WANTED: HANNIBAL LECHTER POSTER WE SAW AT THE FBI. STARLING (cont'd) Due respect, after your, after your... VERGER My encounter. STARLING Someone offered three million dollars bounty on Dr. Lechter's head. (PAUSE) CORDELL The identity of the person offering the bounty was never established. VERGER Yes, but we know who it was, and I will tell you, Agent Starling, what you know to be true. I offered the bounty. It was illegal, and, worse, it was wrong. And I thank God every day that I did not compound my sinful life by the stain of a murder. Do you (WHEEZE) Agent Starling: do you know God? (PAUSE) STARLING ...sir...? VERGER Isn't it funny? You can look on my face (WHEEZE WHEEZE) which you would grant me, is the most hideous sight you will see in what I hope is a long life. You can look at me. Which shows (WHEEZE) a Strength which must come from strong (WHEEZE) strong convictions. (WHEEZE) But you shy when I say the name of God. THE NURSE COMES UP, HOLDING THE TAPE OF A LIFESIGNS MACHINE, SHE NODS TO CORDELL AND INDICATES THE MONITORS. NURSE (TO STARLING) ...I'm sorry.. (MEANING, YOU MUST GO.) STARLING Yes, then, you're saying that you haven't bid upon these drawings. VERGER I have not, I would not. For life (WHEEZE) life goes on Starling. And, wait, wait, I wish to talk to you... I'm... (WHEEZE) (TO THE NURSE, WHO IS TAKING STARLING'S ARM) One moment. I was afflicted, do you see, but my affliction was not in my meeting with your Dr. Lechter. I was afflicted before. Before. Do you see? In my arrogance. Do not (WHEEZE) Do not curse God when you are humiliated. Listen to me: embrace it, and you embrace life.... Listen, and you hear the word of God... STARLING IS LED AWAY BY THE CONCERNED NURSE. CORDELL LINGERS BEHIND, AT AN UNSEEN BEHEST OF VERGER. THE NURSE STARTS PREPARING A HYPO AT HER STATION. STARLING ...will he be alright...? THE NURSE, DISTRACTED, NODS, AND RETREATS TOWARD VERGER WITH THE HYPO. CORDELL COMES OUT TO STARLING. INT CORRIDOR, COUNTRY HOUSE, DAY. STARLING AND CORDELL ARE WALKING, BEYOND THEM, WE SEE VARIOUS CHILDREN PLAYING UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION. A CARETAKER TYPE IS HOLDING A SMALL GOAT, WHICH THE CHILDREN ARE PLAYING WITH. CORDELL OPENS THE GLASS DOOR, AND HE WALKS STARLING THROUGH THE SCENE OF THE CHILDREN AND THE GOAT. CORDELL Mr. Verger wanted me to give you this... (HE HANDS HER A SMALL PRINTED CARD) ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE GLANCES AT THE CARD. ANGLE INS THE CARD READS: \"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY...\" SHE GLANCES AT IT, AND, DISMISSIVELY, PUTS IT IN A POCKET. CORDELL (cont'd) And he has asked me to ask you something. STARLING What would that be? CORDELL (PAUSE) He... would consider it a favor if he could make a donation. To a charitable institution of your choice. (PAUSE) STARLING Now, why in the world would he do that? CORDELL I... think... he was.... he was touched, by your reaction. To his appearance. STARLING What reaction? CORDELL Exactly. STARLING (AS SHE HANDS HIM A CARD) Please, I do not... I don't want to trouble him. But if you or he have any notlon, who would be buying Dr. Lechter's... CORDELL Do you know the seller? STARLING We've subpoenaed the Auction House's records. CORDELL Try Barney Clark. STARLING (TAKING OUT A NOTEBOOK) He is...? CORDELL He was the orderly, during Dr. Lechter's stay in Prison. STARLING And how would you know that? CORDELL Before \"The Change,\" Mr. Verger was... he made quite a study. (PAUSE. STARLING MAKES A NOTE. SHE LOOKS AROUND.) STARLING You should get the kids a dog... CORDELL ....I hardly think so... after \"The Incident\"... STARLING No, no, of course not. SHE STARTS TO GET INTO HER CAR. CORDELL ...Mr. Verger would be pleased to make a contribution, to the charitable... STARLING Tell him to give it to an orphanage. STARLING CLOSES THE CAR DOOR. HOLD. ON STARLING, WATCHING THE CHILDREN FOR A MOMENT. THEN SHE TAKES THE CARD FROM HER POCKET AND GLANCES AT IT. IT READS : \"DO NOT GIVE INTO ADVERSITY, DO NOT TRUST TO PROSPERITY. BE AWARE OF FORTUNE'S HABIT--SHE WILL DO JUST AS SHE PLEASES. NONE OF THIS IS IN YOUR CONTROL. BE HAPPY. BE KIND. ANGLE ON STARLING, AS SHE STARTS TO PUT THE CAR IN GEAR, PUTTING DOWN THE NOTE. THEN SHE HESITATES, AND BEGINS TO CRY. LOWERING HER HEAD, BEYOND HER WE SEE THE POTATOCHIP VAN, PARKED IN THE DRIVEWAY, AND THE CHILDREN ROMPING WITH THE GOAT. INT PSYCHIATRIST'S OFFICE DAY.

STARLING (TAKES A TISSUE FROM A BOX ON THE DESK) If he could overcome... his need for... for self-ratification... PSYCHIATRIST ...would you use a small word? STARLING For approval. PSYCHIATRIST What's wrong with approval? (PAUSE) You admired that man. STARLING Yes. PSYCHIATRIST How do you think that made him feel? (AFTER A PAUSE. SHE CHECKS HER NOTES) What does that mean, \"to go beyond the institution...?\" (PAUSE) STARLING I told that woman I'm an orphan. PSYCHIATRIST ...you are an orphan.

ANGLE INT THE LIBRARY BRIGHAM AND STARLING ENTER, AS HE GOES TO GATHER UP HIS MATERIALS. AN AGENT HURRIES THROUGH. AGENT Starling: They got a x-ray. They think, they might have a lead on Lechter. STARLING Wherever he is, that's fine with me... AGENT They... STARLING Yeah, I know. THE AGENT LOOKS AT HER WONDERINGLY, AND, THEN, AS IF SHE HAS NOT UNDERSTOOD. AGENT (AS HE PRODUCES A XEROX OF AN X-RAY) They got a Radiologist Assistant, Buenos Aires, guy, amputation of a Sixth Finger...and it seems to've left a scar, uh oh.... STARLING That ain't my case.

ANGLE IN THE JETWAY, AN ARMED SOLDIER, HIS SMG SLUNG IN FRONT OF HIM, IS READING AN ITALIAN NEWSPAPER.

PAZZI AND COP ONE MOUNT THE STAIRS. COP ONE Carlo Fanelli, Dottore, missing two months. He was the Director of the Museum. Which, since his absence... THEY HAVE ARRIVED ON A LANDING. VARIOUS RESTORATION CREWS ARE AT WORK. PROFESSOR RICCI, A CONTEMPORARY OF PAZZIS, COMES UP TO HIM. RICCI Ah, Pazzi. How was America...? THEY TURN THEIR HEADS. AT THE SOUND OF SHOUTING. ANGLE THEIR POV. A LARGE SALON, ITS DOUBLE DOOR OPEN, AND TEN CHAIR ARRANGED AROUND A TABLE, ALL FULL OF SEATED OLDER MEN, OF WHOM SEVERAL ARE EXPOSTULATING WITH ANOTHER FIGURE, UNSEEN. ANGLE ON RICCI, PAZZI, ET AL. RICCI (cont'd) We may need you to stop bloodshed. PAZZI What're they on about? RICCI They're grilling the applicant for the Vacant Post. PAZZI Speaking of the Vacant Post. RICCI Dottore Fanelli... COP He hasn't, by any chance, wandered back in? AS COP ONE TALKS WITH RICCI, CAMERA GOES OVER THE SHOULDER OF PAZZI, WHO, GINGERLY ENTERS THE SALON, TO THE SIGHT AND SOUND OF THE OLD MEN ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER. ANGLE, HIS POV. THE OLD MEN AT THE TABLE. SOGLIATO, A FELLOW IN HIS SEVENTIES, IS HOLDING THE FLOOR. SOGLIATO Now: our applicant holds in his hand, in his Non-Italian-Hand, a note, from Dante Aligheri himself. Would he recognize it, I think not... ANOTHER OLD MAN You want the job for your nephew. SOGLIATO Indeed I do. Because he is my Nephew? No. Because he.... A THIRD OLD MAN Let him read the note... SOGLIATO Yes, fine, of course he can read the note. His Italian is admirable, for a straniero. But is he familiar with... ANGLE ON THE MAN, PREVIOUSLY UNSEEN OF WHOM THEY ARE TALKING. THE MOVEMENT OF THE POV REVEALS HIM, STANDING ALONE, BACK TO CAMERA, BEFORE A HALF CLOTH-COVERED TAPESTRY, DRESSED IN A MAGNIFICENT SUIT, USING HALF-GLASSES TO LOOK DOWN AT A NOTE IN HIS HAND. SOGLIATO (cont'd) (VO) The personalities of pre-Renaissance Florence? I think not. THE MAN (HANNIBAL LECHTER/DR. FELL) STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR-- STILL LOOKING AT THE NOTE--NODS TO INDICATE HE HAS HEARD. ANGLE HIS POV THE TABLE OF OLD MEN, AND BEYOND THEM, PAZZI. RICCI APPEARS AT PAZZI'S SIDE, AND SPEAKS IN WHISPERS. RICCI (SOTTO) ...a Dr. Fell. A Brazilian, I think. Applying for Fanelli's post. PAZZI (VACANTLY) Brazilian. (RICCI HANDS SOME FORMS TO PAZZI) RICCI It would seem. SOGLIATO (VO) What if he came upon a note in, the Capponi Library, this great Italian Institution, which he now graces us with his bid to Direct, a note from Guido de Cavalcanti. Would he recognize it, I think not. ANGLE ON DR. FELL, STILL SEEN FROM THE REAR, AS HE TAKES A SILK SQUARE FROM HIS BREAST POCKET, AND CLEANS HIS HALF- GLASSES, THEN FOLDS THEM AND PUTS THEM AND THE SQUARE BACK IN HIS POCKET. SOGLIATO (cont'd) (VO) Would you care to address that, Dr. Fell...? BEAT. DR. FELL TURNS TO CAMERA, STILL HOLDING THE NOTE. HE TAKES SEVERAL PACES, TO LOOK AT THE NOTE IN A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT. HE IS STANDING BESIDE THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES. HE NODS AT THE NOTE, AS IF CONFIRMING SOMETHING. THEN HE LOOKS UP. DR. FELL Cavalcanti replied publicly to Dante's first sonnet. Do you know it, Professor Sogliato? I believe it's worth your time: Listen to the way he makes an instrument of the Italian vernacular, which he called the vulgari eloquentia-- the eloquent voice of the people: Allegro me sembrava amor tenedo/Meo core in mano, e ne la braccia avea/Madonna involta in un drappa dormedo/Poi la svegliava a d'esto ardeno/Lei paventosa umilmente pascea/Appreso gir lo ne vedea paingendo. If Dante had written to a Cavalcanti, it would, of course, have been to Andrea, the most literary of his brothers.... SOGLIATO ...why do you want this job? DR. FELL In the hope, that someday, I should come across such a note. I thank you gentleman for your kind attention, and hope you will consider... THE MEETING IS ABOUT TO BREAK UP, THE OLD MEN ARE RISING, FELL HANDS BACK THE NOTE, WHICH IS ENCASED IN A PROTECTOR, RICCI COMES FORWARD WITH PAZZI, AND BEGINS INTRODUCING HIM TO THE COMMITTEE. RICCI ...investigating the disappearance of Dottore Fanelli... PAZZI Who, can you think, who would want to harm Dr. Fanelli, did he have any enemies, that... COMMITTEE MEMBER ...I have never met a man who was so well beloved. PAZZI ...he was wealthy... COMMITTEE MEMBER He had nothing. He lived in a garret. His work was his life, he... PAZZI ...his family has offered a large reward. ANGLE ON FELL, WHO GOES TO THE PEDIMENT OF THE STATUE OF JUDITH AND HOLOFERNES, AND PICKS UP A SMALL SKETCH BOOK, WHICH IS OPENED AT A SKETCH OF THE STATUE, HE PUTS THE BOOK UNDER HIS ARM. ANGLE ON PAZZI AND THE COMMITTEE MEMBER. COMMITTEE MEMBER His older brother offers the reward, Fanelli had nothing, he.... ANGLE. PAZZI HALF TURNS HIS HEAD, TO SEE SEVERAL COMMITTEE MEMBERS CONGRATULATING DR. FELL, WHO IS PUTTING ON HIS COAT. COMMITTEE MEMBER (cont'd) ...will have, of course to be examined by the Studiolo, to confirm the appointment, but I think I can assure you, that the Committee... DR. FELL ...you are most kind... ANGLE, ON PAZZI, WHO IS STILL BEING TALKED AT BY THE COMMITTEE MEMBER. COMMITTEE MEMBER ..who would benefit from his disappearance? No one. No one has but lost by it... ANGLE PAZZI STARTS TOWARD DR. FELL. PAZZI (TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBER) ...would you excuse me...? ANGLE EXT THE SALON, ON THE LANDING, FELL IS BEING ADDRESSED BY RICCI. RICCI ...will have to face the Studiolo, in their meeting next week. And I, for one, wish you the best. FELL SHAKES HIS HAND, AND STARTS DOWN THE STAIRCASE. CAMERA GOES WITH HIM, WE HEAR PAZZI VO. PAZZI Dottore... FELL TURNS, AND PAZZI COMES TO CATCH UP WITH HIM. PAZZI (cont'd) Pazzi, Rinaldo, Commendatore, Prefatura... FELL Of course, Commendatore... CAMERA TAKES THEM DOWN THE STAIRS, AS THEY TALK. PAZZI Could you tell me: did you ever meet your predecessor, Dottore Fanelli...? FELL I never met him. I knew him only from his writings. PAZZI I know that the officers who first investigated his disappearance searched for a note, a farewell note, a suicide note... FELL ...yes. PAZZI You have taken over his offices, is that not so? FELL It is only temporary, until my confirmation by... PAZZI Of course, in his offices, if you come across anything, any personal papers of his, anything, however trivial, would you contact me, please... Are his personal effects still at the Palazzo? FELL Yes. Packed and with an inventory. (HE HESITATES, AND LOOKS AT PAZZI) PAZZI AND FELL WALK OUT OF THE MUSEUM. ANGLE EXT THE MUSEUM. PAZZI I'll have them picked up. PAZZI GESTURES TO HIS COLLEAGUE. PAZZI (cont'd) May we drop you? FELL Thank you, I am most happy to walk in this most magnificent of cities. FELL STARTS PULLING ON HIS GLOVES, HE HANDS HIS SKETCHBOOK TO PAZZI FOR A MOMENT. PAZZI LOOKS DOWN. ANGLE PAZZI'S POV FELL'S LEFT HAND, HAS A SCAR ON THE BACK IN THE SHAPE OF A 3. PAZZI May I ask you a personal question, Dr. Fell? FELL If your duty requires it. PAZZI You have a recent scar on the back of your hand. FELL And you have a new wedding ring on yours? La Vita Nuova?-- (HE SMILES.) PAZZI You looked oddly at me, back on the landing. FELL Yes, it must be hard to be a policeman. Is it hard? Must one, then, be constantly suspicious? PAZZI Why did you look at me that way? FELL (SMILES) I saw a man in disheveled clothing, but clean. Just dressed--in the middle of the... FELL SHAKES HIS HEAD, ASKING TO HAVE THE QUESTION WITHDRAWN. PAZZI ...please... FELL (SHRUGS, SMILES) I saw a man, somewhat fatigued. Quickly dressed, a bit dishevelled. In the middle of the day. (SMILES) An old story. And then I saw the clothing was fresh--therefore: a man who dressed at home. And then I remarked the new wedding ring. And so: the story gave me pause. A lovely story. A new, and a beloved wife. I wish you joy. (FELL STARTS TO EXIT) PAZZI WALKS WITH HIM. PAZZI You assemble this, on the instant, from these few observations? FELL (SHRUGS) I'm a historian. It is our task to assemble the seemingly unconnected into the obvious. PAZZI ...your scar..? FELL My scar is a war-wound. PAZZI How so? FELL Carpal-tunnel syndrome. From a life of typing. Commendatore. History, a hazardous profession. FELL AND THEN PAZZI STOP. FELL (cont'd) You are a Pazzi of the Pazzim are you not? PAZZI Yes. How did you know? FELL You resemble a figure from the Della Robia Rondels, in your family's chapel at Santa Croce. PAZZI It was Adresa de Pazzi, depicted as John the Baptist. You have seen the chapel? FELL I have had the honor. (HE BOWS AND STARTS OFF. PAZZI GOES AFTER HIM.) FELL TURNS TO HIM. FELL (cont'd) I wondered that an officer of your exalted rank should come, so late, into the case. PAZZI And? Then? FELL I wonder no longer. You were out of the country. PAZZI How could you know? FELL I sense... (HE TOUCHES HIS NOSE) The faintest whiff of a perfume, whose base, whose base, whose base is \"Hamamelis\" ... it is witch-hazel--such a clean scent. No, not a European scent. I would say it is a scent of the New World. I would say, you have been in America. Have I struck home? PAZZI You know America? FELL ...you have brought this perfume... brought this perfume. Back. Back from America. To your New Wife... (HE PICKS UP HIS HAND, AND GLANCES DOWN AT PAZZI'S WEDDING RING.) You have given it to her, and some of... (HE SMILES) Some of 'her perfume' has found its way back onto you. Lucky man. Lucky man, indeed. HE BOWS, AND STARTS TO TAKE HIS LEAVE, FROM THE STARTLED PAZZI. PAZZI COMES TO HIS SENSES, AND HANDS A CARD TO FELL. PAZZI Should you come across anything which... FELL You will be the first I call. FELL TURNS TO LEAVE, TURNS BACK, AND TAKES HIS HAND AND, GENTLY RUBS IT ON THE LAPEL OF PAZZI'S SUITJACKET, HE THEN, DELICATELY, HOLDS THE HAND UNDER HIS NOSE, AND NODS, AS IF IN AGREEMENT WITH HIMSELF. HE NODS, AND WALKS OFF INTO A PARK. ANGLE ON PAZZI, WHO LOOKS AFTER FELL. HE WALKS BACK TOWARD THE CAR. HE TURNS, TO LOOK AFTER FELL, AND WE SEE HE IS STANDING BY A LINE OF PEOPLE, A QUEUE, UNDER A BANNER WHICH PROCLAIMS, \"ATROCIOUS INSTRUMENTS OF TORTURE.\" PAZZI SHAKES HIS HEAD, AS IF TO CLEAR IT, AND STARTS TOWARD HIS CAR, WHERE COP ONE OPENS THE OOOR FOR HIM. ANGLE ON FELL, AS CAMERA TAKES HIM INTO THE PARK, WHICH, WE SEE, IS A CEMETERY. HE SITS ON A BENCH, AND TAKES OUT HIS SKETCHBOOK, AND BEGINS TO DRAW. ANGLE HIS POV. A PIECE OF FUNERAY STATUARY, THE LION, HOLDING THE BIRD IN HIS MOUTH. ANGLE ON DR. FELL, SKETCHING. TIGHT. HE SKETCHES, HE RAISES HIS HAND TO HIS NOSE AND INHALES, AND NODS AGAIN. ANGLE, FROM THE SIDE, WE NOW SEE THE STATUE AND FELL'S DRAWING. HE IS DRAWING, NOT THE STATUE, BUT A SKETCH OF CLARICE STARLING. DISSOLVE TO: EXT MARYLAND MISERICORDIA HOSPITAL DAY. VARIOUS UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE, ENTERING THE HOSPITAL; LEAVING THE HOSPITAL, A VAST GIANT OF A MAN, SHRUGGING HIMSELF INTO AN ARMY FATIGUE JACKET OVER ORDERLY'S WHITES.

A DOVE, CIRCLING IN THE SKY. ANGLE XCU. BARNEY LOOKING UP, PUZZLED, AND THEN HE LOOKS DOWN. ANGLE HIS POV. IN THE ROAD AHEAD, A DEAD DOVE. BARNEY WALKS INTO THE POV, PICKS UP THE DOVE, AND WALKS TO A SMALL RATTY VERGE OF PARK. HE PUTS THE DOVE DOWN, LOVINGLY IN THE GRASS, AND WE WATCH, AS THE OTHER DOVE LANDS ON A FENCE, NEARBY. BARNEY STARTS TO WALK TOWARD THE LIVE BIRD. ANGLE OVER THE BIRD, ONTO BARNEY, WITH STARLING WALKING UP BEHIND HIM. BARNEY HESITATES, HIS BACK STILL TO STARLING. BARNEY Are you attracted by Death? (PAUSE) It is the one great mystery, is it not? Anyone who would say otherwise must be a hypocrite. Don't you think...? HE TURNS FOR THE FIRST TIME AND LOOKS AT HER. BARNEY (cont'd) ...or are you only attracted by power... (HE CHANGES HIS TACK AND TONE.) How are you, Agent Starling? STARLING Ah, Barney: you've got a good mernory. BARNEY You know why that is? Because there are so few things I need to forget. Would you agree, for the record, that I have not been read my rights? STARLING I have not read you your rights. BARNEY Would you mind saying that into your bag...? STARLING STARTS TO OPEN HER BAG, AND SPEAKS INTO IT. STARLING I hereby acknowledge that... BARNEY And now I have \"dociled\" you, have I not? By forcing your obedience. STARLING (SMILING) Then why did you chose to inform me of it...? BARNEY To show... (PAUSE) in my ability to squander. What one might deem an advantage... that my strength is greater than yours... STARLING Oh yeah? Wanna arm wrestle...? BARNEY If you'll come down the street I will make you a cup of coffee. INT BARNEY'S APARTMENT DAY. AS THEY ENTER, THE APARTMENT WITH MANY DEADBOLTS. STARLING ENTERS WARILY AND TAKES A SEAT WITH HER BACK TO THE WALL, IN THE SMALL STUDIO. AS BARNEY BEGINS MAKING COFFEE. BARNEY You almost took down Evelda Drumgo. STARLING Well. Word gets around. BARNEY ...what hindered you...? STARLING It wasn't my day. BARNEY Perhaps you did not have the support you required. STARLING It's a poor workman who blames his tools. BARNEY Or, perhaps... STARLING ...how are things at the Hospital? BARNEY It's a growth business. STARLING What have they got you doing? BARNEY Orderly. STARLING I would have figured you an R.N. by now, or, maybe Med School. BARNEY I prefer to stay in the Less Frivolous professions. STARLING (TAKES OUT A NOTEBOOK) You lasted eight years, as Orderly, in Dr. Lechter's prison ward. BARNEY Yes, I presumed it was about him. STARLING ...you... BARNEY I'm struck by your phraseology. I did not last with him. I was privileged to enjoy his company during that time. STARLING (GETTING DOWN TO BUSINESS, AS SHE TAKES OUT A PENCIL.) I'm looking for... BARNEY He said, and these were his words, he valued our time together, because I was civil. STARLING Did you ever think, did you think, after he escaped, he would come after you? BARNEY He told me, he preferred to Eat the Rude. Or: \"natural composting.\" Do you think he'd come after you...? STARLING LOOKS OUT THE WINDOW. ANGLE HER POV OUT THE WINDOW, SE SEE THE DOVE CIRCLING THE DEAD DOVE ON THE RATTY PIECE OF GRASS. STARLING (TURNING BACK) What...? BARNEY I asked you how you like your coffee...? We have black and bitter. As the Soul of Man. Or light and sweet, as the world- view of the self-delusive. STARLING We got a bunch of materials, coming up at auction. Materials which disappeared from Dr. Lechter's cell, drawings he made, his books. BARNEY Yes? STARLING And I'd like your help, determining who's bidding for their purchase. BARNEY Why me? STARLING Waal, because your selling'em... Two years ago, his annotated Dictionary of Cuisine, by Alexander Dumas, went for sixteen thousand dollars. Seller's affidavit of ownership, signed Cary Panz. P.A.N.Z. Sounds to me like an Orderly. Whadja clear on the book? Ten, twelve grand? BARNEY ...very good. STARLING Here's what they want you to do: we want the rest of the stuff you stole from his cell. BARNEY ...why? STARLING Let's just say they got a passion for collectibles... BARNEY You said \"here's what they want you to do...\" Why? STARLING Now, whyn't you help us? BARNEY That would adversely impact my income. STARLING Not as much as being jailed for theft of Government Property, or for failure to pay income tax, on undisclosed income. BARNEY We could skip the Gavotte. STARLING Say it in English. BARNEY Lechter's not buying up his Memorabilia. He keeps it all in his \"mind,\" do you see...? STARLING Then who's buying it? BARNEY (SHRUGS) There's one or two freaks, and, for a \"Pass,\" I'll rat them out to you... (HE TAKES A PENCIL, AND PUTS A COUPLE OF NAMES IN HER BOOK, LEANING OVER HER) STARLING That's the spirit... ANGLE, BARNEY AS HE LEANS OVER, LOOMING OVER STARLING. BARNEY ...aren't you afraid of me...? STARLING You want me to be? BARNEY I'd prefer it... (HE FINISHES WRITING) But it's just a vacant exercise. HE AND STARLING FINISH THEIR COFFEE. HE BEGINS TO WALK HER OUT. ANGLE EXT BARNEY'S APARTMENT, AS THEY EXIT. STARLING A vacant exercise, why...? BARNEY You said \"here's what they want you to do.\" Aren't you part of them anymore...? Aren't you part of the FBI? 'No Girl's Allowed,' or what? Have you transgressed...? STARLING Let's keep it to business, shall we? BARNEY ...why have they stuck you on this silly little roust? STARLING ...they did it for a lark. BARNEY Oh, Good. The ornithological leitmotif... HE TAKES HER OVER TO THE DEAD BIRD. HE PICKS UP THE DEAD BIRD, AND SMOOTHS ITS FEATHERS. HE ADDRESSES THE CIRCLING DOVE. BARNEY (cont'd) Off you go. You've grieved enough. Anything more would be self-indulgence. STARLING (AS SHE LOOKS AT HER BOOK OF NAMES) Who are these guys...? BARNEY Rich, comic book freaks. STARLING And why is it a vacant exercise? BARNEY Because we both know who's buying the Lechteriana. STARLING Who would that be. BARNEY (AS IF STATING THE MOST OBVIOUS FACT.) Mason Verger. For he cannot be free. Dr. Lechter refashioned his body so it mirrors his soul, what an impossible injustice. Can you be free....? STARLING No, you're wrong about Verger. BARNEY Oh, yes. He's found Peace. STARLING Well, if he hasn't, I'm vastly mistaken. BARNEY (PAUSES, AND LOOKS AT HER INTENTLY) And have you found Peace..? (PAUSE) ANGLE, ON BARNEY, AS HE STARTS PUTTING THE DEAD BIRD IN HIS POCKET.

MAPP The Multi-Jurisdiction Task Force: read alphabet soup, for the continued pursuit, and in preparation for the apprehension of the fugitive, Evelda Drumgo. The man's hazing you. STARLING My daddy would say: accept with glee the things you cannot change. MAPP PICKS UP THE X-RAY. MAPP I'll tell you what: I should go in there, volunteer to fill up his Female Quota. (OF THE X-RAY. SHE HOLDS IT UP, SEEKING INFORMATION) STARLING Mr. Crawford asked my opinion. Here we've got a purported x-ray, Dr. Lechter's surgery. Do we keep it secret, or broadcast it? MAPP Saying what, \"Look out for a guy with ten fingers...?\" STARLING Yeah, that's too Hip for the Room. MAPP (OF THE NOTE) You stay offa this Alphabet Soup Detail, all this half-baked, cowboy stuff, till after you get your mind cleared.... you don't wanna go out there a half-step slow... STARLING I don't wanna go out there at all... MAPP What do you want to do? You want to jam up that sonofabitch Krendler. STARLING No. I want to buy a dog. (PAUSE) MAPP What broke you free, Girl? STARLING I met a man, and His Troubles Were Greater Than Mine... SHE EXTRACTS THE SMALL CARD VERGER HAS GIVEN HER. AND WE SEE IT, AS SHE LOOKS AT IT. \"DO NOT GIVE IN TO ADVERSITY.

VERGER The government says. Mama has lost her job, so she can't be your foster mother. The police found a marijuana cigarette in your home. You can't see Mama anymore. Or Shirley. Or Kitty Cat. That's what the Government says... ANGLE XCU ON FRANKLIN. VERGER (cont'd) ...or perhaps they just don't want you anymore. Could that be? And, do you know what will happen to Kitty Cat? When you go away. The police will take her, and they'll give her a shot. With a shiny needle. They'll give Kitty Cat a shot. And it will hurt her. And then she will die.
