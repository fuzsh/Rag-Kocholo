His impressive body of work provides a benchmark that all screenwriters aspire to,” said WGAW President John Wells.\n\nIn 1994, Zaillian received an Academy Award for his screen adaptation of Schindler’s List; his work on the film also earned him a Writers Guild Award (Best Screenplay, Based on Material Previously Produced or Published), a BAFTA Award (Best Adapted Screenplay), the Humanitas Prize (Feature Film), and PEN Center USA’s Literary Award.\n\nHis other screenplays include Awakenings, for which he received both Academy and Writers Guild Award nominations (Best Screenplay, Based on Material from Another Medium), The Falcon and the Snowman, Jack the Bear, and American Gangster\n\nHis co-writing screen credits include Hannibal, Clear and Present Danger, Gangs of New York and The Interpreter.\n\nTHR Newsletters\n\nSign up for THR news straight to your inbox every day\n\nSubscribe Sign Up"
