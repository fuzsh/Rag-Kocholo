That figures with the credited writers being two of the foremost practitioners of the craft in the modern era: Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin.\n\nYou may read the screenplay here.\n\nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY!\n\nThe movie has a fascinating backstory which I covered in great detail. You can read one of my articles on it here.\n\nYou may also read my interview with Stan Chervin who wrote the first draft of the screenplay and received a Story By credit.\n\nPage One is a daily Go Into The Story series featuring the first page of notable movie scripts from the classic era to contemporary times. Comparing them is an excellent way to study a variety of writing styles and see how professional writers start a story."
