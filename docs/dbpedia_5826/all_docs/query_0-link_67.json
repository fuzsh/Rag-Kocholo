        "text": "A contention shared by many is that the late, great Anthony Minghella’s 1999 film The Talented Mr. Ripley is a masterpiece. I’ll go further and assert that it’s one of the best films ever made, a movie so perfectly constructed and performed that it seems almost divinely created. Sure, it takes great liberties with Patricia Highsmith’s separately cherished novel, but it is a wondrous thing unto itself. And thus any further retelling of this story—about an adept conman worming his way into, and ruining, the lives of bored rich expats in 1950s Italy—will have a steep hill to climb toward esteem.\n\nBut Steve Zaillian, a remarkably peripatetic screenwriter (Schindler’s List) and TV creator (The Night Of), has decided to take a crack at it anyway. In Ripley, a new series premiering on Netflix on April 4, Zaillian has shrewdly determined that trying to do some episodic rehash of Minghella’s film would be a mistake. No one could ever recapture the magic of those young stars—all working perhaps at the top of their game—playing patsies and predators in sun-dappled corners of the world’s loveliest boot. Instead, Zaillian hews closer to Highsmith’s efficient prose, leaving the adornment to the world of film.\n\nRipley, shot in chilly black-and-white, is not a portrait of psychological swoon and mania. It’s a pragmatic affair, concerned less with the complicated motivation of its titular antihero and more with how his terrible, studied work is practiced. Andrew Scott has been cast to play Thomas Ripley, an opaque grifter from New York City tasked with convincing an expat playboy heir to return to his family fold. Scott is nearly 20 years older than Matt Damon was when he played the role, which means a certain air of unbridled sexual discovery is lost, maybe, but a frightening competence is gained.\n\nIt’s not clear, exactly, why Ripley is thought to be connected to dilettante flaneur Dickie Greenleaf (Johnny Flynn), scion of a shipping dynasty. But Ripley finds himself ensconced in Italy anyway, with a healthy per diem. If Minghella’s film is, at first, about Ripley realizing he never wants to turn back, Ripley presents a man who perhaps always knew he was crossing a rubicon. When he arrives on the continent, a plan seems already in motion. He infects the lives of Dickie and his girlfriend, Marge (Dakota Fanning), with grim determination. These entitled, nice-enough idiots never had a chance.\n\nIn this version of the story, we yearn less for the life that Dickie and Marge are leading, because they are such feckless and unwitting sheep. The book that Marge is working on is silly; Dickie’s paintings are terrible. The series is rooting for Ripley to outwit (and, I guess, murder) these dopes, a bias that is only a real problem when it comes to Zaillian’s perhaps too arch assessment of Italians and their professional custom.\n\nZaillian is not interested in stunning Mediterranean scenery foregrounded by beautiful people. Ripley is a process show, devoting half of two separate episodes to the tensely clandestine aftermath of murder. There’s a comic lilt to these grand set pieces, an off-camera chuckle at just how much Ripley has to do to cover up the fact that he’s bludgeoned someone to death. He gets hit by a motorboat; he finds himself stuck in a slow-moving elevator. This is real work, the series insists, pausing in admiration for the diligence required. The approach flatters both the fictitious sociopath doing the cleaning and the filmmaker orchestrating these elaborate circumstances.\n\nIt is my understanding that Highsmith always pushed back on the idea that Ripley is gay, which is more than heavily implied in Minghella’s film. Zaillian, in seeking to capture a blankly whirring machine, lets queerness be stated and then dismissed. What we are watching is an automaton functioning on preservation mode, which gives Scott less to play. But he does find the little grooves, the nooks and crannies, in which true character lies—Zaillian’s version of Ripley is mostly placid coolness, and yet Scott manages to give off faint ripples of, at least, anxiety. (It’s a bit like watching a very good Traitors player try to hide their sweat at the roundtable.) His co-stars have less to do, though Eliot Sumner as louche and doomed Freddie Miles and Maurizio Lombardi as a clever but ultimately thwarted police inspector are captivating.\n\nThis Ripley is a strange thing. It’s withholding, and frustrating for that. But as the series goes on, one starts to appreciate its aloofness, the way it stands in such confident contrast to Minghella’s lush vision. One might read a little chauvinism into that—why does a Ripley story need to be so pretty and frilly, when it could be a blunt procedural that cares not for an erotic dream?"
