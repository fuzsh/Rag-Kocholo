        "text": "Fans of everyone's favorite cannibal have waited since ¿91 to see Doctor Lecter and Clarice Starling return to the big screen. As production continues on in Italy, here¿s a quick summary and review of the February 9, 2000, shooting script written by Steven Zaillian.\n\nThe script opens with Agent Starling stamping out the drug trade with a custom .45 and Doctor Hannibal Lecter settling into a new identity as a curator of an Italian museum. Rinaldo Pazzi, an Italian detective, discovers the doctor and attempts to win the $3M bounty on Hannibal¿s head. Anonymity gone, Lecter dispatches Pazzi with a gory flourish. To put an end to bounty hunters, the doctor returns to America to find Mason Verger, his one surviving victim. But Verger¿s hatred and planning pay off as his henchmen capture Lecter and prepare him as a meal for a brood of man-eating swine. Starling is shot while rescuing the good doctor. Lecter carries her away to a specially prepared meal and asks her to join his escape.\n\nTHE GOOD:\n\nThe script does a good job of reacquainting us with old characters and introducing the new ones. Clarice jumps in guns blazing. The opening scene of Agent Starling taking on a Mac-10 toting drug moll and a Crip gunship loaded with bad guys is sure to make a big splash on the screen. The introduction of the horrific visage of Mason Verger, Lecter¿s only surviving victim, should be real treat to see. Finally, Italian detective Rinaldo Pazzi¿s accidental discovery of Lecter in Florence and the following bounty-driven attempt to lure Hannibal into a trap is the most powerful act of the script. Despite Starling's warnings, Pazzi's quest for Verger¿s three million in blood money ends in a satisfyingly gory scene rivaling Hannibal¿s escape scene from Silence of the Lambs.\n\nTHE BAD:\n\nWhile the novel carefully developed the many facets of the characters, the script offers simple, one-dimensional portrayals of the good, evil, dumb and greedy. For instance, the novel slowly paints a dark, detailed, sickening picture of the pedophile Mason Verger, Lecter's victim and nemesis. Verger¿s hatred is the driving force of the novel: his withered hand brings Lecter and Starling together again. In Zaillian¿s script, subtlety and explanation are thrown aside as Starling¿s old boss Jack Crawford dumps a bucket of evil paint on Verger as he says, ¿He's not pretty, Starling. And I don't just mean his face.¿\n\nOther characters get short shrift, too. Paul Krendler is Starling¿s rival at the Department of Justice. After Clarice beat him to the capture of James Gumb in Silence of the Lambs, Krendler schemes his way through the novel as the invisible hand keeping Starling stuck in the most thankless, dangerous jobs in the FBI. Krendler is also financing his upcoming political run with Mason Verger¿s massive bribes. When Verger bribes Krendler to hurt Starling and lure Lecter out in the open, Krendler¿s happy to oblige. The script doesn't explain how Starling knows Krendler is colluding with Verger in her downfall: it only shows him as a dumb lackey taking pay-offs.\n\nIn the novel, Verger¿s personal physician, Cordell, has been banned from working in the health industry in Switzerland or in any job where he has contact with children. His past and tastes make his symbiotic existence with Verger understandable. We see the reasoning behind his loyalty to Verger. However, the script doesn't show the leverage Verger has in commanding Cordell. He is nothing more than another generic peon, doing what he is told.\n\nAside from the lack of character development, the script changes the ending of the story. Those who have read the novel may not have liked the ending, but that was how Harris decided it should be. The script takes a different route with Starling¿s dinner with Lecter. Luckily it¿s not a horrible Hollywood tack-on-feel-good-ending, but it certainly is not as disturbing as the original.\n\nTHE UGLY:\n\nThe script should pave the way for a blockbuster movie. Fans who¿ve not read Red Dragon, Silence of the Lambs, or Hannibal will be unaware of the subtle textures and detail of Harris' writing and will be sated with the gore provided by Dr. Lecter¿s exploits in the script. As usual, far more character depth and plot development could have been brought to the screen from the novel that would have really rounded the script into a much more powerful psychological thriller.\n\nAside from the lack of serious character development, there are a few items that are annoying in the script. Il Mostro, the novel¿s stylistic murderer and cause of Pazzi¿s fall from grace within the Italian police seems to be nothing more than a cheap add on in the script with no real purpose other than to perplex the audience. Also the script has the annoying habit of drawing from the well of allusions to Hannibal¿s diet way too often.\n\n¿\n\nOverall, strong performances by all the actors and on-set script rewrites combined with exciting cinematography, special effects and a tight musical score could turn this 3 ¿-star script into a 4 ¿-star movie. No matter what, I'm sure that the masses will be beating down the door to join Hannibal for dinner."
