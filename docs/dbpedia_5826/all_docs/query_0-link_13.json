It's more gruesome than frightening, with more state-of-the-art organs and arterial sprays than a season of &quot;E.R.&quot; Anthony Hopkins returns as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, the world's wiliest working cannibal and serial killer, who serves up a cast that includes Ray Liotta, Gary Oldman and Giancarlo Giannini, whose doleful manner gives the movie a rare touch of humanity. (Frankie R. Faison supplies the other warmth.) Julianne Moore, as the F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling, is game but almost superfluous: Hannibal himself is rendered in such operatic terms that you half expect Hopkins to burst into an Andrew Lloyd Webber song. The director Ridley Scott delivers a movie that glows in various degrees of midnight blue, a soothing contrast to the sea of crimson that the titular figure unleashes. — Elvis Mitchell",

        "text": "''He's a very dangerous man,'' the F.B.I. agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore) says of Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), and she's right. Lecter is the world's wiliest cannibal at large, as his two previous filmed adventures, ''Manhunter'' and ''The Silence of the Lambs,'' clearly established. So he's definitely the type to be handled with kid gloves.\n\n''Hannibal,'' a silly though handsomely staged adaptation of the Thomas Harris novel directed by Ridley Scott, is a movie meant for the whole family -- the Manson family. Mr. Scott's presentation is mournfully beautiful; rarely has a director used so many variations on midnight blue. And he uses it as a visual palliative, a soothing contrast to the arterial sprays of crimson that occasionally flood the screen.\n\nThe camera regards the displays of violence and maiming with a rapt awe; it is fascinated by layers of scar tissue and exposed organs. Yet despite the gruesome operatic staging, the movie is not particularly dramatic. It is Swift's ''Modest Proposal'' without a sense of humor, apt but pat and bizarrely respectful and florid. An exhausted sense of dread looms over the proceedings.\n\nAs the movie begins, an attempt by Clarice's team to capture a fugitive goes wrong. The empathetic F.B.I. agent's own personal Waco ends in a shower of ice chips, sparks and Mountain Dew, leaving her flabbergasted and hurt. Her public humiliation at the hands of her vicious superior, Paul Krendler (Ray Liotta), makes the news and catches the eye of Lecter, at large well before the ending of ''Lambs.'' Lecter is now leading a life of leisure as a Renaissance scholar and lecturer in Florence, Italy.\n\nBut he has been spotted by a police detective, Pazzi (Giancarlo Giannini), who is out to bring Lecter in for the reward. And a Lecter victim, Mason Verger (Gary Oldman), a child molester and serial killer whom Lecter persuaded to flay his own face, wants revenge. ''Lecter's object has always been degradation and suffering,'' Verger says through the remains of his facial structure, a comment that could sum up ''Hannibal'' except that the movie is monumentally disengaged from an ability to frighten.\n\nMr. Hopkins is the draw here, and he is unafraid to return as Lecter in a sequel (though ''Silence'' itself was a sequel to ''Manhunter,'' a movie not very many people saw). ''Hannibal'' builds to his first appearance, which comes about a half-hour into the film, sporting a big rakish Panama hat.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
