        "text": "Steven Zaillian is smoking cigarettes, one after another, in a restaurant in Studio City. His eyes are red-rimmed; he's nervous and just plain exhausted.\n\n\"I really need a year to catch up with my life,\" said the 40-year-old screenwriter, who is making his directorial debut with \"Searching for Bobby Fischer.\" He added, with a wan smile: \"Directing was much harder than I expected. If the film comes out and two weeks later it's gone, well, I don't think I'll ever direct again.\"\n\nWhatever its long-term commercial prospects, the film seems unlikely to disappear after only two weeks. The gentle drama, which opens on Wednesday, has received dazzling early reviews, and preview audiences have responded enthusiastically.\n\n\"Ironically, everyone thinks the film is about chess, but it's not,\" said Mr. Zaillian, who has a reputation as one of the most skilled and serious screenwriters in town. He laughed. \"I don't even know how to play chess.\"\n\nThe film is based on the book of the same title by Fred Waitzkin, a New York sportswriter who chronicled the story of his relationship with his son, Josh, an extraordinarily talented chess player. At issue is how many parents obsessively push their children to the edge at the expense of a normal childhood.\n\nThe stars are Joe Mantegna, Laurence Fishburne, Joan Allen, Ben Kingsley and a newcomer, 8-year-old Max Pomeranc, who was discovered at a chess tournament in New York City. \"We interviewed hundreds of kids,\" said Mr. Zaillian. \"And Max just seemed so normal. He had composure and confidence, and he was totally unintimidated, and he had holes in his jeans and his hair was messed up. He had no acting experience, but we decided to gamble. It turned out that he was so natural that he's incapable of a false moment.\" A Relatively Charmed Life\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.
