GENDER, POLITICS, AND SOCIETY IN UKRAINE This page intentionally left blank [167.71.63.233] Project MUSE (2024-08-10 04:34 GMT) Gender in Transition: Legacies, Opportunities, and Milestones in Post-Soviet Ukraine olena hankivsky and anastasiya salnykova The idea for gathering an edited volume on gender in Ukraine originated from our joint research into evolving post-Soviet Ukrainian gender policies and our respective research in the areas of sex trafficking, HIV/AIDs, and sociopolitical transformations in independent Ukraine. Scanning the literature in support of these projects, we came to the realization that in most edited publications on post-Soviet countries, Ukraine remained on the margins or simply absent from the analysis. And in published works on transition to democracy, the impact of this dramatic process on gender relations was ignored. In studies that did attend to questions of gender, the focus of investigations was typically on women only. There was, in short, something missing that would bring these threads of research together. This volume is an attempt to remedy that. Here, we combine brand new research into the gendered impact of transition with a detailed focus on a single country, Ukraine, and we do so from a broad perception of gender that goes beyond women only to include men, women, and the relations between the genders as they shift over time. In the past twenty years, similarly to other former Soviet states, post-communist Ukraine has been undergoing what Taras Kuzio (2001) has termed a ‘quadruple transition.’ This transition has included four large-scale changes: (1) from communism to democracy, (2) from planned economy to free market, (3) from being part of an imperial state to building an independent state, and (4) from a suppressed national identity to identity revival (pp. 168–77). Transitions from communist to capitalist economic systems, along with the associated processes of democratization and changing social environment, have garnered much academic attention (Bunce 1995; Carothers 2002; 4 Olena Hankivsky and Anastasiya Salnykova Kornai 1995; Kuzio 2001; Linz and Stepan 1996; McFaul 2005; Offe and Adler 1991; Perelli-Harris 2008; Rose 1998). For Ukraine, like other countries in transition, ‘the time of transformations was not only a period of fast economic changes that resulted in the loss of everyday routines, welfare benefits, and job security, but also a period of transformations of cultural representations and changes of personal, collective , and public memories’ (Lukić et al. 2006, 301). In general, however, researchers investigating these transitions ‘have explored the establishment of democratic institutions and processes with no reference to gender’ (Johnson and Robinson 2007, 13), even though all elements of change in post-Soviet states have had significant and distinct effects on gender relations in the region. As Kuenhast and Nechemias (2004) explain, ‘Societal transformation . . . encompasses more than political systems and economies. Social relations between men and women, young and old, rich and poor are also in transition’ (p. 18). Thus, gender – a fundamental dimension of personal life, social relations, and culture (Connell 2007, vii) – is a critical but often overlooked factor in examinations of political, economic, and social changes within transitional states. As such, it is not possible to adequately understand the economic and political transformations in post-Soviet societies without considering the complex processes through which restructuring takes place in the gender order (Zhurzhenko 2008, 9), that is, the socially constructed constellation of dynamics between and within genders. Despite the overall lack of attention to gender in the literature on transition, exceptions do exist. Beginning with Nanette Funk’s groundbreaking work in 1993, Gender Politics and Post-Communism, a number of scholars have examined the specific history and experiences of women in post-Soviet countries (Corrin 1999; Einhorn 1993; Jähnert et al. 2001; Kuenhast and Nechemias 2004; Marsh 1996; Mogdhadam 1993; Occhipinti 1996; Rubchak 2011; Štulhofer and Sandfort 2005), and they have investigated gender dynamics in Central and Eastern Europe more broadly (Duffy 2000; Funk and Mueller 1993; Galligan et al. 2007; Gal and Kligman 2000; Jähnert et al. 2001; Johnson and Robinson 2007; Lukić et al. 2006; Pascal and Kwak 2005; Matland and Montgomery 2003; Rueschemeyer and Wolchik 2009). The range of studies to date has enriched understandings of the role of gender in post-authoritarian societies and, in particular, ‘the dynamic interaction among gender and cultural, ethnic, social and political identities’ (Kuenhast and Nechemias 2004, x). The analysis put forward by many Introduction 5 such scholars highlights the challenges of searching for ‘new identities and values to fill the ideological vacuum...
