        "text": "1 INTRODUCTION\n\nIt is a great honour to be asked to give the 2023 Nations and Nationalism Ernest Gellner Lecture here at the ASEN Conference. As the eminent Ukrainian historian Yaroslav Hrytsak (2008) has argued, Ukraine's emergence as a nation is not an obvious product of the transition to modernity—Gellner's classic story in Nations and Nationalism (Gellner, 1983). I want to make three arguments instead. First, Ukraine was an unconsolidated nation despite being already modern at the time of independence in 1991. Second, Ukrainians' resilience in the face of Russia's 2022 invasion can be explained by cumulative identity change through successive revolutions: the Orange Revolution in 2004, the Maidan Revolution or Revolution of Dignity in 2013–2014 and the current as yet unnamed war. Hrytsak (2022) has suggested the ‘Ukrainian Patriotic War’. Third, the two phases of the war, from 2014 and 2022, have accelerated both the civic and the social construction of Ukrainian identity. Post-post-Soviet Ukraine is now a consolidated civic and political nation. But there is also an increased consensus on traditional nationalist mythology (Kulyk, 2022), defined by opposition to Russia's aggressive reimperialisation and autocratic political culture and by Ukraine's hyper-Europeanisation.\n\nI will also review some of the key literature on Ukraine from 1991 to 2023. As this is a lecture, those reading the journal version will find pointers but not the density of argument of a normal academic article.\n\nUkraine is a great testing ground for theories of nationalism. According to scholars like Serhii Plokhy (2012), Frank Sysyn (1986) and Zenon Kohut (2011), Ukraine was an exemplar of Adrian Hastings's (1997) religion-based pre-modern ‘construction of nationhood’. In the 16th and 17th centuries, the local Orthodox Church was heavily influenced by the Renaissance, Reformation and Counter-Reformation, at a time when the Russian Church resisted all change (at the Stoglav council, 1551). Along with the Uniate Church established in 1596, this provided a way of being ‘in between’ Roman Catholic Poland and the Orthodox Russia of the ‘Third Rome’. Neither the Hetmanate established in 1648 nor Kyivan Rus' was part of the later Russian imperial tradition. Although historians Plokhy (2023) and Serhii Hromenko (2023) have floated the idea that Rus' was technically an empire, this is because it was multi-ethnic, not because it was aggressively expansionist, like Russia after Ivans III and IV and Peter I. Cossack culture provided key mythomoteurs for an early modern nation: liberty, government by contract and horizontal self-organisation. Ukrainian or Ruthenian Cossacks were differentiated from Russian Cossacks by circumstances as much as by ethnic origin: They were escapees from (Polish) state authority rather than guarding and expanding Russian state frontiers, like the Don Cossacks. The leitmotiv of freedom also came from first protecting the local population against the Crimean Tatars and then sharing their fate: absorbed by the Russian empire at the same time in the late eighteenth century and with national ‘revival’ before 1917 (Finnin, 2022). These ideas are central today: the word ‘freedom’ and its cognates appear four times in the national anthem, ruling our ‘own’ land five times and ‘fight’ three times.\n\nThe memory of these lost Cossack rights, as in Gogol's ‘Lost Contract’, was the basis of the nineteenth century national movement. Though as Ivan Rudnytsky (1963, p. 200) argued, ‘the modern Ukrainian nation is not simply a continuation or restoration of the Cossack Ukraine of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries’. It was partially the product of modernisation processes from the late nineteenth century onwards—the story told by Ernest Gellner. In fact, Gellner (1983, pp. 58–62) was thinking of L'viv as his point of contact between Ruritanians and Megalomanians. Eugen Weber's (1976) peasants took 70 years to become Frenchmen and women, from 1870 to 1940. But the effects of modernisation on Ukrainian identity were relatively late and complicated and differentiated both geographically, with Ukrainians living in both the Romanov and both halves of the Habsburg Empires and in terms of modernisation design and impact. Ukrainians in Habsburg Austria developed a stronger civil society, but Ukrainians everywhere were disproportionately rural, relatively poor and with limited education. The Habsburg Empire had more impact, but that was still relatively limited. Ideas were relatively important, but the means of disseminating them were again circumscribed (Hrytsak, 2011). Religion, namely, the local Greek Catholic Church, as much as modernisation, was a key factor in promoting a Ukrainian identity in Habsburg Ukraine. The various attempts to build a Ukrainian state in 1917–1921 were as much cause as effect of burgeoning national consciousness.\n\nModernisation and urbanisation under Soviet rule were also a complicated story. In 1926, 18.5% lived in towns and cities, but 67% by 1989. Bohdan Krawchenko talked optimistically of this as the short Ukrainian century—‘social change’ sharpened the ‘national consciousness’ of Ukrainians as they urbanised (1980). Alexander Motyl answered that this mattered little: The ‘non-Russians’ would not rebel because they could not. State power was too centralised (1987). Kuzio and Wilson (1994) gave a more nuanced answer. Some cities were Ukrainianising: L'viv after 1945 had dramatically lost its Polish and Jewish populations. Though even there was some psychological Sovietisation (Amar, 2015). Other cities in the east and south were already Russian-speaking, and urbanisation had the opposite effect. David Laitin (1998) and others emphasised the multi-layered effects of Soviet federalism and the importance of political tipping points.\n\n2 BASELINE 1.0\n\nDespite the idea that the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 ‘awakened’ Ukraine, only limited public politics gradually became possible in Soviet-ruled Ukraine until democratisation in 1989–1990. In the elections held in March 1990, the main opposition movement Rukh was only able to win about a quarter of the seats (it stood under an umbrella as the ‘Democratic Bloc’, and there was much initial back and forth amongst those elected), unlike the Baltic States, Moldova and Georgia, where decisive majorities backed independence. In Estonia in particular, there was a strong Citizens' Congress movement to reject all forms of Soviet rule. Popular mobilisation was a factor in both the Baltic States and Ukraine; but numbers in Ukraine were smaller, and the purpose was to try and radicalise Rukh and strengthen its hand with the Communists, unlike the demonstration of overwhelming rejection of Soviet rule in the Baltic States (Wilson, 2023). Overall, the judgement in Wilson and Kuzio (1994) is sound, echoing the claim by the leading nationalist opposition leader Luk'ianenko (1992) that ‘independence only became possible because both nationalists [Rukh and others] and communists agitated for independence’. Ukraine was independent in 1991, but there was no revolution. As a result of the Grand Bargain between Rukh and the national communists, those who backed independence got to keep their jobs. The situation was summarised by the Succession Law passed in September 1991—everything about the Ukrainian SSR stayed the same unless specified.\n\nUnder Ukraine's first two presidents Leonid Kravchuk (1991–1994) and Leonid Kuchma (1994–2005), Ukrainian nationalism in the 1990s was a ‘minority faith’ (Wilson, 1997). Its full bundle of precepts was backed by Western Ukraine, Eastern Galicia in particular, and by a smaller number in Kyiv and in central Ukraine. Galicia was a historical story of the spread of nationalism though all strata of society since the late nineteenth century, albeit then suppressed under Soviet rule. In central Ukrainian and in parts of the east and south, there was a (post-)Soviet Ukrainian intelligentsia. Rukh survived until the 1998 parliamentary elections, largely because its cultural Ukrainisation agenda was only partially fulfilled. It came second with 9.7% of the vote; the Communist Party came first. Rukh split in 1999.\n\nThe rest of the country, on the other hand, included a smaller minority of pro-Russian or Soviet nostalgia groups (Wilson, 2014). Russian Unity won 4% of the vote in 2010 elections in Crimea. However, most of the population between the Rukh electorate and these Soviet/Russian nationalist groups were ambiguously Ukrainian-lite. An impressive 90% had voted for independence in the referendum in December 1991 but for a variety of existential and instrumental reasons. Different authors used different labels and concepts for this phenomenon (Wilson, 2002). Ukrainian culture and identity remained distinctly post-Soviet (Wanner, 2010). Paul Pirie (1996) analysed mixed identities. With only ethnicity and language data initially available in opinion polls, Russian-speaking Ukrainians, in the 1990s at least, were often posited as a middle ground (Wilson & Khmelko, 1998). Regional identities were often dominant over national, more than the sum of the ethnic and linguistic profile that they contained (Birch, 2000; Barrington & Herron, 2004. For an update, see Barrington, 2022). ‘Region’ itself was a differentiated concept of variable salience (Schmid & Myshlovska, 2019). Mykola Riabchuk (2003; but see also 2015) talked of ‘many Ukraines’ and of amorphous and ambivalent identities under the general label of Ukrainian creolism, mostly in Eastern and Southern Ukraine.\n\n3 BASELINE 2.0: CIVIC UKRAINE\n\nThere was then a transition period including the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Maidan Revolution of 2013–2014. This was a decade of double refoundation and cumulative transformation. These were the Ukrainian ‘impressionable years’, like the Gorbachev era and 1990s for Russians (Pyle, 2021, referenced in McGlynn, 2023). Ukraine experienced similar economic trauma in the 1990s and liberation from empire rather than its loss. Russian psychology is still scared by the 1990s; Ukraine has moved on. Again, this is Laitin's (1998) point about the importance of political choice and tipping points. Shore (2018) analysed the Maidan as an ideational and moral revolution, as did Wynnyckyj (2019), whose multi-factoral analysis included national liberation and economic modernisation and the rise of heterarchy and self-help. These were the years of the rise of Ukrainian civil society (Burlyuk & Shapovalova, 2018), at a time when the state was distrusted and both too strong (coercive) and too weak (too much state capture and corruption).\n\nThe previously empty slogan of a civic nation was now given substantive content. Ukraine now had a powerful foundational myth, canonised by an official parliamentary resolution in 2021 (UNIAN, 2021), defining the Maidan revolution as\n\n‘one of the key moments of Ukrainian state formation and an expression of the national idea of freedom.\n\nUkraine paid too high a price for freedom from dictatorship and its civilizational choice - to be part of Europe. Heroes of the Heavenly Hundred gave their lives during the Revolution of Dignity, defending the ideals of democracy, defending human rights and freedoms, and the European future of Ukraine. The memory of their heroic act is part of the history of national statehood’.\n\n3.1 Two revolutions, one war\n\nThe Revolution of Dignity segued with the Russian invasion of Ukraine. For Russia, that was its point, to try and prevent Ukrainian consolidating its democracy. But the decade of two revolutions had shifted the baseline. Ukraine had vulnerabilities in Crimea and in the Donbas, where there was minority separatist sentiment, but no more. Despite the mythology of ‘two Ukraines’, these sentiments were well-assessed by many sociologists and political scientists. In Crimea, in one poll just before annexation in February 2014 (undertaken 8–18 February), 41% supported Ukraine and Russia uniting ‘in a single state’ (KIIS, 2014). Analysts also got things roughly right in the Donbas. Again, there was a smaller active minority, but no more. An opinion poll on 8–16 April 2014 in Eastern and Southern Ukraine asked the question ‘Do you support the idea, that your region should secede from Ukraine and join Russia?’ (DIF, 2014). Support was 15.4% in the east and south as a whole (7.1% definitely and 8.3% more or less), 27.5% in Donets'k and 30.3% in Luhans'k (11.9% and 13.2% definitely).\n\nThere were many other factors determining the success of Russian intervention. This lecture only discusses identity factors. Russia assumed it would receive widespread support in 2014, but only received it in small areas. Even in Crimea, its success was manufactured. Even in the Donbas, it took first the necessary spark of Strelkov's incursion, the direct military assistance to create conflict, and then invasion to protect the so-called DNR-LNR (Hauter, 2022; Wilson, 2014). The baseline of support for independence in 1991 has been misunderstood by Russia, which then failed to understand the degree of change from 1991 to 2014. The baseline had shifted even more by 2022. That said, opinion on the Maidan and even on the causes of the war was not completely consolidated until 2022 (Razumkov Centre, 2020).\n\n4 BASELINE 3.0: THE ZELENSKY EFFECT\n\nAndreas Wimmer in ‘Nation Building: Why Some Countries Come Together While Others Fall Apart’ (2018) has argued for three mechanisms that bridge ethnic divides. The first factor is the density of voluntary and civil society networks that ‘knit together different regions into a quilt of political networks’. The second is the state's ‘capacity to provide public goods’. The third is linguistic homogeneity. The 2013–2014 Maidan exemplified the first and the downplaying of the third (see Channell-Justice, 2022—significantly, her book is called ‘Without the State’), though there was also ‘anti-Maidan’, mainly in the east and south and mainly an artificial political technology phenomenon.\n\nIronically, Volodymyr Zelensky was elected president in 2019 as part of a backlash against existing institutions and elites but at a time when the investment in institutions and institutional reform since 2014 was beginning to pay dividends. Also (the second factor above), the state delivery of public goods accelerated through Zelensky's early presidency. Zelensky backed a New Deal style programme of public investment. Road building physically and symbolically connected Ukraine's tattered regions. State services were now delivered by the Diia app—a massive boost to Ukrainian resilience under the Russian invasion. In 2022, 43% rated Zelensky's coronavirus response positively, and 54% approved of the actions of local officials (Onuch, 2022, p. 41). Onuch and Hale (2022, p. 253) noted a ‘surge in attachment to the state’. Pride in Ukrainian citizenship went up from 59% in 2020 to 82% in July 2022. There was an increase in support for democracy as the ‘best form of government’, increasingly seen as delivering for ordinary Ukrainians, from 41% in April 2019 to 76% in May 2022 (Onuch, 2022, p. 37).\n\nZelensky also connected with voters symbolically. Initially, many saw him as the wrong choice for a country at war. More subtly, others judged him as a ‘“hybrid” candidate’ who ‘symbolizes some interesting trends taking place in eastern and southern Ukraine. He is a mirror of people living in these regions who had pro-Russian or pro-Soviet views, but after Russian aggression, they no longer have illusions about Moscow. At the same time, they cannot identify with the Ukrainian cultural project. They silently share former Ukrainian President Leonid Kuchma's slogan “Ukraine is not Russia,” but they do not know exactly what Ukraine is’. ‘In this sense, Zelensky is part of a post-colonial society slowly moving from its post-Soviet identity to something more modern and western’ (Yermolenko, 2019). Even before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, Zelensky was making people like him more Ukrainian: often Russian-speaking and often from the east and south, the very people that Putin hoped to attract in 2022.\n\n5 WAR\n\nPolitics and the politics of war can trump each other. But in the Ukrainian case, they have complemented each other. War has been hugely important in consolidating Ukrainian identity and its ideational basis, partly because of a rally-round-the-flag effect and partly in Charles Tilly's (1992) sense of state-led consolidation of territory, fighting population and resources to acquire the means of war—though in this case, a state–civil society partnership would be more exact.\n\nWar has been also important because, as argued by John Hutchinson (2018), ‘the constitutive myths of many nations are derived from war experience’. Wars can spread and solidify old myths and create new ones (common purpose, new beginnings, victories and even defeats). In the words of Anthony Smith (1981), ‘the war experience may unite previously disparate groups and differentiate them from threatening others’. ‘The threat of death and conquest can force populations to confront fundamental questions about their identity and purposes’. The salience of myths increases. They are sacralised by conflict, which also creates harder us/them boundaries. According to Ernest Rennan (1881), ‘A people shares a glorious heritage as well, regrets, and a common programme to realise. Having suffered, rejoiced, and hoped together is worth more than common taxes or frontiers that conform to strategic interests and is independent of racial and linguistic considerations’. War democratises memory. All those who fight for the nation are remembered, not just the elites. So the civic side of the Maidan marries naturally to the civic war effort.\n\n6 SOCIAL CONSTRUCTION\n\nThere is an aphorism that ‘Putin created Ukraine’ or that ‘Putin won Crimea, but lost [the rest of] Ukraine’ (Mankoff, 2014). There is some truth in this. But it is too third person. Ukrainians see themselves as fighting against, and defining themselves against, not just Putin himself but the entire Russian system. In one 2023 poll, 84% of Ukrainians felt negatively about Russians: Only 9% concentrated their ire on ‘Putin and other representatives of the Russian state leadership’, 23% condemned ‘those who supported the aggression against Ukraine’, 35% blamed ‘all Russians’ and 26% felt negatively towards ‘all Russians, apart from those who actively oppose the war and the Kremlin’ (Smola, 2023). The idea that ‘Putin created Ukraine’ also implies creation ex nihilo. But the 2014 and 2022 wars have had the effect they have precisely because they have built on previous accumulated trends.\n\nBut ideationally, Ukraine is the anti-Russia. Not in Putin's sense of an artificial ‘platform from whose territory we [Russia] will constantly’ be threatened by the West (Putin, 2021). Ukraine is the antipode of many things most characteristic of modern Russia. First is being Russian. Volodymyr Kulyk (2018) has talked of ‘shedding Russianness’ in Ukraine. The last Soviet census in 1989 recorded a Ukrainian population of 51.5 million: 72.7% identified as ethnic Ukrainian and 22.1% or 11.4 million as Russian. In the only census undertaken in independent Ukraine in 2001, the number of Russians was down to 17.2% or 8.3 million. After the Maidan, the population identifying as Ukrainian grew closer to 90% and even over (Kulyk, 2016). By 2022, in one poll, the figures were 95% Ukrainian, 2% Russian and 1% both (Kulyk, 2023). Two/three percent of a lower Ukrainian population of perhaps 40 million, meant that Putin, the would-be gatherer of the ‘Russian World’, had instead seen more than 10 million Russians disappear.\n\nOverall population has fallen, and there has been some out-migration. There is a tendency for Eastern Slavs—a potential but weakly bordered identity for some (Shulman, 2004)—to identify with the host state. In Belarus, the number of Belarusians went up from 77.9% in 1989 to 84.9% in 2019. Ukrainians and Belarusians in Russia fell from 3.8% in 1989 to 0.7% in 2021. In third-party Kazakhstan, they fell from 6.5% in 1989 to 2.4% in 2021. But such big changes in Ukraine are mainly explained by re-identification amongst the mixed identity population already mentioned. Ukrainian citizens also identified as Ukrainians because they identified ‘Ukrainian’ as meaning all of its citizens: In a July 2022 poll by KIIS asking ‘Who do you consider yourself to be first of all?’, 85% chose the answer ‘Citizen of Ukraine’ (KIIS, 2022a). Through the 2010s, even before the 2022 war, there has been a steady rise of national identity and a demotion of local and regional identities (Haran & Yakovlev, 2017). Ukrainians also endorsed existential positivism about the collective whole. Despite the war and a 30% fall in GDP in 2022, 73% believed the country was ‘heading in the right direction’ (Reiting, 2022d). Ninety-three percent saw a ‘promising future’ (IRI, 2022). Ninety-eight percent believed in victory (IRI Ukraine Poll, 2022).\n\nThis last figure was clearly a mixture of ‘will’ and ‘should’. But these numbers are huge. Gerard Toal (2023) has sounded a sceptical note about opinion polling in wartime. So have Henry Hale (2021) and others on polling in Russia. They talk about authoritarian rallying, fear (of state or social disapproval) and Potemkin polling. Toal talks about patriotic performance and social desirability and also the dangers of leading questions. Onuch and Hale (2022, pp. 254–255) conducted a list experiment, according to which Zelenksy's performance approval rating was 60% not 88% in July 2022. So the numbers above can be adjusted downwards. But the general trend is clear.\n\n6.1 Civic Ukraine\n\nWartime Ukraine is a heterarchical society of self-help, mutual help and volunteering for the war effort. Russians have been deliberately demobilised for the near quarter century of Putin's rule since 2000. In Ukraine, in March 2020, the number prepared to fight in some degree was 80% (Norris & Kizlova, 2022; Reiting, 2022a). In May 2022, 60% were donating to the war effort, 32% were doing volunteer work and 8% were in the armed forces and territorial self-defence (Onuch & Hale, 2022, pp. 255–256). In February/March 2023, after a year of war, the number had gone up: 67% were donating, 42% were volunteering and 12% were in the armed forces and territorial self-defence (Onuch, 2003).\n\nThe flip side of the 80% plus majorities noted above is an unwillingness to make concessions to end the war. In September 2022, 87% opposed any surrender of sovereign territory, including Crimea (KIIS, 2022b).\n\n6.2 Belated Soviet rejectionism\n\nUkrainians increasingly diverged from Russians in crucial respects. The number agreeing with Putin's claim that Ukrainians and Russians are ‘one nation’ fell in one poll from 41% in 2021 to 8% in April 2022 (Reiting, 2022b). Putin has deliberately projected nostalgia for the USSR. In Russia, ‘regret for the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991’ actually went up in the decade from 2010 to 2021, from 55% to 63%. Starting in roughly the same place in 2010, Ukrainians travelled in the opposite direction, down from 46% to only 11% (Reiting, 2022c). There is no Ukrainian pobedobesie (meaning Russia's victory frenzy, the obsession with 1945). In Ukraine, the number viewing May celebrations as ‘Victory Day’ has fallen in a decade from 74% to 15%, with the fall accelerating around 2022. Correspondingly, the number seeing the May holiday as a more European day of ‘remembrance of the victims’ has gone up from 18% to 80% (Reiting, 2022c). There are now consolidated negative views of Soviet and Russian politicians, heroes and historical figures and positive views of Ukrainian equivalents, including previously divisive figures like Stepan Bandera and Ivan Mazepa. In a single stream approach to Ukrainian history, all ‘fighters for independence’ are now seen as positive, including the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists (OUN) and Ukrainian Insurgent Army (UPA), although a small legacy effect for the OUN and UPA still gives them slightly lower positives (Reiting, 2022c).\n\n6.3 Russia as Ukraine's constitutive other\n\nAt various times, Ukraine's constitutive other has been Poland, then the Crimean Tatars. Based on the Kultura version of ‘For our freedom and yours’ (Polish freedom depends on the freedom of its eastern neighbours), Polish-Ukrainian reconciliation since 1989/1991 has been impressive. Though the overlap years of 2015–2019 showed a sharp deterioration, relations has recovered, particularly since 2022 (PiS has been in power in Poland since 2015; Ukrainian history was often politicised when Volodymyr Viatrovych was head of the Institute of National Memory in 2014–2019). Ukrainians and Crimean Tatars are now political allies in a double anti-colonial cause (Finnin, 2022). Crimean Tatars and Ukrainians are part of a double civic nation: Both are in a civic partnership, and both are framed as civic nations themselves (Wilson, 2021).\n\nThis left the field clear for Russia as Ukraine's constitutive other, in a series of pairings. Russia is empire, and Ukraine is a post-colonial nation. The use of the binary empire–colony is more consolidated than it was in the 1990s: both in general (Velychenko, 2004) and specifically in relation to Southern Ukraine (Durand, 2022) and to settler colonialism in Crimea (Crimea, 2022). Russia is defined as nothing but its imperial politics and its autocracy. Ukraine is freedom; the Russian Horde has historically imposed a slave mentality on a population that kicks all the way down. Lawlessness (bezpredel) and cruelty are simply being exported to Ukraine in the current war. Russia has a mentality of crime without punishment (Ogarkova & Yermolenko, 2022). Ukraine is Europe, its Antemurale. Russia is non-European, Asian: Moskoviya or Zalissya (the ‘land behind the forest’). Much of this overlaps with or revives old nationalist tropes of ‘the eternal city of Ukraine’ versus ‘the immutable character of Russian messianism’ (Donzow, 1967). Kulyk (2022) makes the argument that ‘citizens have indeed become less negative towards [ethnic] nationalism, narrowing their perceptual difference between good patriotism and bad nationalism’.\n\n7 CONCLUSION\n\nForget about the old stereotype of a divided Ukraine. Ukraine is now an 80%–90% consensus society. Although change has accelerated since 2022, this has been a cumulative process since 1991, through the Orange Revolution, Maidan, first war, Zelensky's presidency and second war. The baseline of support for a consolidated national identity has moved ever higher. At the same time, civic and ethnic elements in national identity increasingly coincide. There is a strong element of social construction and opposition to Russia; the clearest example of which was the decision by Ukrainian Churches to align key dates with the Gregorian calendar, such as Christmas on 25 December not 7 January."
