        "text": "c. Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, and Other Related Abuses\n\nAlthough the constitution prohibited such practices, numerous credible reports indicated law enforcement officers and security forces engaged in torture, abuse, and violence to coerce confessions from suspects, and authorities only occasionally held officials accountable for such actions.\n\nThere were reports of deaths because of torture.\n\nPhysical abuse of suspects by police officers reportedly was systemic and usually occurred within the first few days of arrest in pretrial detention facilities. Reports from human rights groups and former police officers indicated police most often used electric shocks, suffocation, and stretching or applying pressure to joints and ligaments because those methods were considered less likely to leave visible marks. The problem was especially acute in the North Caucasus, where there were widespread reports police and security forces tortured or abused alleged militants and civilians in detention facilities. For example, in January, authorities in the Republic of Kalmykia arrested five employees from Corrections Colony Number 2 for allegedly torturing prisoners Magomed Atimagomedov and Daud Kuramagomedov. There were reports police beat or otherwise abused persons, in some cases resulting in their death.\n\nAccording to human rights groups, police and security forces used excessive force and harsh tactics when detaining antiwar and antimobilization protesters.\n\nThere were reports law enforcement officers used torture, including sleep deprivation, as a form of punishment against detained opposition and human rights activists, journalists, and critics of government policies. For example, on May 10, UN Special Rapporteur on Torture Alice Edwards told media Aleksey Navalny’s placement in isolation on 11 separate occasions, amounting to 114 days in solitary confinement in harsh conditions during a seven-month period, appeared disproportionate and if confirmed, would amount to a form of torture.\n\nThere were reports of authorities detaining defendants for psychiatric evaluations to exert pressure on them or sending defendants for psychiatric treatment as punishment. Prosecutors and certified medical professionals could request that suspects be placed in psychiatric clinics on an involuntary basis. For example, in February, an Ussuriisk District Court extended the forced hospitalization of Siberian shaman Aleksandr Gabyshev, who was sent to a psychiatric clinic against his will in 2021 after being detained for anti-Putin activism in 2019.\n\nReports of nonlethal physical abuse and hazing continued in the armed forces. Activists reported such hazing was often tied to extortion schemes.\n\nThere were reports Russian forces, Russia-led forces, Russian proxies, and Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine engaged in torture, including rape (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Ukraine).\n\nImpunity was a significant problem in the security forces. In most cases where law enforcement officers or other government officials were publicly implicated in human rights abuses, authorities denied internal and external requests for independent investigation and engaged in disinformation campaigns or other efforts to obfuscate such allegations. The few cases that were brought to trial resulted sentencing inconsistent with the severity of the charged crime. In one case, in May, five police officers in Tatarstan were convicted for the torture of a prisoner who later committed suicide. The maximum sentence was seven years in prison, but three officers were given time served. The government’s propensity to ignore serious human rights allegations along with the uneven application of the rule of law and a lack of judicial transparency resulted in impunity for most perpetrators.\n\nPrison and Detention Center Conditions\n\nConditions in prisons and detention centers varied but were often harsh and life threatening. Overcrowding, abuse by guards and inmates, limited access to health care, food shortages, and inadequate sanitation were common in prisons, penal colonies, and other detention facilities.\n\nAbusive Physical Conditions: Prison overcrowding was a serious problem. Overcrowding, ventilation, heating, sanitation, and nutritional standards varied among facilities but generally were poor. Opportunities for movement and exercise in pretrial detention were minimal. Potable water was sometimes rationed, and food quality was poor; many inmates relied on food provided by family or NGOs. Access to quality medical care was a problem; NGOs reported approximately 50 percent of prisoners with HIV did not receive adequate treatment. While the law mandated the separation of women and men, juveniles and adults, and pretrial detainees and convicted prisoners in separate quarters, anecdotal evidence indicated not all prison facilities followed these rules.\n\nPhysical and sexual abuse by prison guards was systemic, according to human rights NGOs. Human Rights Watch recorded numerous instances of abuse and torture of antiwar activists throughout the year. Prisoner-on-prisoner violence was also a problem. There were widespread reports authorities and the Kremlin-backed Wagner Group recruited inmates from prisons to fight in Ukraine.\n\nThere were reports political prisoners were placed in particularly harsh conditions and subjected to punitive treatment within the prison system, such as solitary confinement or punitive stays in psychiatric units. Former political prisoners described having to carry out meaningless tasks multiple times a day and being sent to the “punishment brigade” for minor infractions, conditions that one prisoner described as psychologically harrowing. According to human rights organizations, political prisoners were held incommunicado for lengthy periods and authorities often refused to provide information regarding their location. For example, on February 18, Human Rights Watch reported authorities refused to provide information regarding the location of opposition politician Andrey Pivovarov to his lawyer and family for more than one month. On February 20, Pivovarov’s lawyer was able to ascertain Pivovarov was transferred from a St. Petersburg facility to a penal colony in Karelia and placed in incommunicado detention. Prison authorities reportedly refused Pivovarov’s request to call his family or lawyer.\n\nAdministration: Authorities rarely conducted investigations of credible allegations of mistreatment. While prisoners could file complaints with public oversight commissions or with the Office of the Human Rights Ombudsperson, they often did not do so due to fear of reprisal. Prison reform activists reported that only prisoners who believed they had no other option risked the consequences of filing a complaint. Complaints that reached the oversight commissions often focused on minor personal requests.\n\nIndependent Monitoring: Authorities permitted representatives of public oversight commissions to visit prisons regularly to monitor conditions. According to the Public Chamber, there were public oversight commissions in almost all regions. Human rights activists expressed concern that some members of the commissions were individuals close to authorities and included persons with law enforcement backgrounds. Officials allegedly transferred some high-profile prisoners to penal colonies far from major cities where access and visitation was significantly more difficult.\n\nThere were reports of authorities prosecuting journalists and activists for reporting torture in prisons.\n\nd. Arbitrary Arrest or Detention\n\nWhile the law prohibited arbitrary arrest and detention, authorities engaged in these practices with impunity. The law provided for the right of any person to challenge the lawfulness of their arrest or detention, but successful challenges were rare.\n\nArrest Procedures and Treatment of Detainees\n\nBy law authorities could arrest and hold a suspect for up to 48 hours without court approval, provided there was evidence of a crime or a witness; otherwise, an arrest warrant was required. The law required judicial approval of arrest warrants, searches, seizures, and detentions. Officials generally honored this requirement, although bribery or political pressure sometimes subverted the process of obtaining judicial warrants.\n\nAfter an arrest, police typically took detainees to the nearest police station, where they informed them of their rights. Police were required to prepare a protocol stating the grounds for the arrest, and both the detainee and police officer had to sign it within three hours of detention. Police had to interrogate detainees within the first 24 hours of detention. Prior to interrogation, a detainee had the right to meet with an attorney for two hours. No later than 12 hours after detention, police were required to notify the prosecutor. They were also required to give the detainee an opportunity to notify their relatives by telephone unless a prosecutor issued a warrant to keep the detention secret. Police were required to release a detainee after 48 hours, subject to bail conditions, unless a court decided, at a hearing, to prolong custody in response to a motion filed by police not less than eight hours before the 48-hour detention period expired. The defendant and their attorney were required to be present at the court hearing, either in person or through a video link. The law prohibited lawyers from bringing “communications technologies on the grounds of a correctional institution,” effectively barring lawyers from bringing cell phones or other recording devices into detention facilities when meeting with their clients.\n\nExcept in the North Caucasus, authorities generally respected the legal limitations on detention. There were reports of occasional noncompliance with the 48-hour limit for holding a detainee. At times authorities failed to issue an official detention protocol within the required three hours after detention and held suspects longer than the legal detention limits.\n\nBy law police were required to complete their investigation and transfer a case to a prosecutor for arraignment within two months of a suspect’s arrest, although an investigative authority could extend a criminal investigation for up to 12 months. Extensions beyond 12 months needed the approval of the head federal investigative authority in the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Federal Security Service (FSB), or the Investigative Committee and the approval of the court. According to defense lawyers, the two-month time limit often was exceeded, especially in cases with a high degree of public interest.\n\nDetainees had trouble obtaining adequate defense counsel. While the law provided defendants the right to choose their own lawyers, investigators sometimes did not respect this provision, instead designating lawyers friendly to the prosecution. These “pocket” defense attorneys agreed to the interrogation of their clients in their presence while making no effort to defend their clients’ legal rights.\n\nIn many cases, especially in more remote regions, defense counsel was not available for indigent defendants. Judges usually did not suppress confessions taken without a lawyer present. Judges at times freed suspects held in excess of detention limits, although they usually granted prosecutors’ motions to extend detention periods.\n\nThere were reports security services sometimes held detainees in incommunicado detention before officially registering the detention. This practice usually coincided with allegations of the use of torture to coerce confessions before detainees were permitted access to a lawyer. The problem was especially acute in the Republic of Chechnya, where incommunicado detention could reportedly last for weeks in some cases.\n\nThere were reports authorities’ use of facial recognition technology to identify and detain demonstrators resulted in the arrest of the wrong individuals. There were also reports authorities targeted lawyers representing political prisoners.\n\nArbitrary Arrest: There were numerous reports of arbitrary arrest or detention, often in connection with demonstrations or single-person pickets, such as those organized against the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For example, on June 7, police detained five individuals associated with human rights NGO Viasna for planning demonstrations against mobilization. Numerous other examples of arbitrary arrests included those of individuals for wearing blue and yellow colors, holding blank posters, or signs that simply read “Peace.”\n\nThere were reports Russian forces, Russia-led forces, and Russian occupation authorities in Ukraine engaged in widespread arbitrary detention (see Country Reports on Human Rights Practices for Ukraine).\n\nPretrial Detention: Observers noted lengthy pretrial detention was a problem, but data on its extent were not available. By law, pretrial detention could not normally exceed two months, but the court had the power to extend it to six months, as well as to 12 or 18 months if the crime of which the defendant was accused was especially serious. Detained opposition figures, journalists, and civil society activists often faced long periods of pretrial detention. By law, a detainee could challenge the lawfulness of detention before a court. Due to problems with judicial independence, however, judges typically agreed with the investigator and dismissed defendants’ complaints.\n\ne. Denial of Fair Public Trial\n\nThe law provided for an independent judiciary, but judges remained subject to influence from the executive branch, the armed forces, and other security forces, particularly in high-profile or politically sensitive cases, as well as to corruption. The outcomes of some trials appeared predetermined. Acquittal rates remained extremely low. In 2022, courts acquitted 0.33 percent of all defendants.\n\nThere were reports of pressure on defense attorneys representing clients who were being subjected to politically motivated prosecution and other forms of reprisal. According to the Agora International Human Rights Group, it was common practice for judges to remove defense attorneys from court hearings without a legitimate basis in retaliation for their providing clients with an effective defense. The report also documented a trend of law enforcement authorities using physical force to interfere with the work of defense attorneys, including the use of violence to prevent them from being present during searches and interrogations.\n\nTrial Procedures\n\nThe law provided for the right to a fair and public trial, but executive interference with the judiciary and judicial corruption undermined this right.\n\nThe defendant had a legal presumption of innocence and the right to a fair, timely, and public trial, but these rights were not always respected. The law provided for the appointment of an attorney free of charge if a defendant could not afford one, although the high cost of legal service meant that lower-income defendants often lacked competent representation. A Yekaterinburg-based legal and human rights NGO indicated that many defense attorneys did not vigorously defend their clients and that there were few qualified defense attorneys in remote areas of the country. Defense attorneys could visit their clients in detention, although defense lawyers claimed authorities electronically monitored their conversations and did not always provide them access to their clients.\n\nThe constitution affords the right to a public trial, but a May analysis by independent news outlet Mediazona showed the number of closed-door criminal cases almost doubled between 2018 and 2022. The law provided only a few categories of cases that judges could order closed to the public, including cases involving state secrets, cases against defendants younger than 16, and cases of sexual offenses. Judges could also close proceedings to ensure the safety of the trial participants, a provision human rights advocates stated was often used in high-profile political cases. For example, on April 26, a judge of the Basmanny District Court of Moscow cited this provision when ordering the courtroom cleared during a hearing in Aleksey Navalny’s extremism trial. Navalny opposed the closure, arguing the move was an attempt to illegally restrict his access to the case materials and “to make sure no one knows about [the case].”\n\nNon-Russian defendants had the right to free interpretation as necessary from the moment charged through all appeals, although the quality of interpretation was typically poor. During trial the defense was not required to present evidence and was given an opportunity to cross-examine witnesses and call defense witnesses, although judges could deny the defense this opportunity.\n\nThe law provided for trial by jury in criminal cases if the defendant was charged with murder, kidnapping, narcotics smuggling, and certain other serious crimes. Nonetheless, trials by jury remained rare, and most verdicts and sentences were rendered by judges.\n\nAuthorities particularly infringed on the right to a fair trial in Chechnya, where observers noted the judicial system served as a means of conducting reprisals against those who exposed wrongdoing by Chechnya head Kadyrov.\n\nIn some cases, judicial authorities imposed sentences disproportionate to the crimes for which they were convicted. For example, on April 28, the Pervorechensky District Court in Vladivostok sentenced Dmitry Barmakin, a Jehovah’s Witness, to eight years in prison following conviction on extremism charges. The court previously acquitted Barmakin on charges of extremism in 2021, but an appeals court overturned the acquittal and ordered a new trial. There were other reports of Jehovah’s Witnesses receiving long prison sentences on extremism charges.\n\nPolitical Prisoners and Detainees\n\nThere were reports of political prisoners in the country and that authorities detained and prosecuted individuals for political reasons. Charges usually applied in politically motivated cases included “terrorism,” “extremism,” “separatism,” and “espionage.” Political prisoners were reportedly placed in particularly harsh conditions of confinement and subjected to other punitive treatment within the prison system, such as solitary confinement or punitive stays in psychiatric units. The government generally did not permit access to political prisoners by human rights or humanitarian organizations.\n\nAs of December 19, the human rights organization Memorial listed 628 political prisoners in the country, including 422 individuals who were allegedly tried and imprisoned wrongfully for exercising freedom of religion or belief. Memorial, which operated from abroad after the organization’s legal entities were shut down by the government in April 2022, had in the past estimated the actual number of political prisoners in the country could be three to four times greater than the number on its list. According to Memorial, the total number of political prisoners increased almost tenfold between 2015 and 2022. Memorial’s list included opposition activists and politicians, journalists, and human rights activists imprisoned for their work, including Vladimir Kara-Murza, Aleksey Navalny, Ilya Yashin, and Andrey Pivovarov, journalists such as members of the student publication DOXA, RusNews reporter Maria Ponomarenko, and Chernovik editor Abdulmumin Gadzhiyev, and human rights activists such as Yuriy Dmitriyev; many Russians and Ukrainians (including Crimean Tatars) imprisoned for their vocal opposition to the country’s war against Ukraine, including Aleksey Gorinov and Aleksandra Skochilenko; individuals imprisoned for participating in protests during the year; members of the military and security services who refused to participate in the war in Ukraine; and members of Jehovah’s Witnesses, certain Muslim groups, and other minority religious groups.\n\nOn April 17, a Moscow court sentenced prominent prodemocracy opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza to 25 years in prison. In April 2022, Kara-Murza was detained and charged with “deliberately spreading false information” regarding the armed forces for a March 2022 speech to the Arizona House of Representatives in which he denounced the country’s war against Ukraine. He was convicted of this charge and also convicted of treason and acting on behalf of an organization the government designated “undesirable,” the Free Russia Foundation. According to human rights activists, it was the longest sentence imposed for a political activity since the Soviet period. On July 31, an appeals court upheld the sentence.\n\nIn April, prosecutors opened a new criminal case against Navalny for organizing an extremist organization. On August 4, a Moscow court convicted Aleksey Navalny on terrorism and extremism charges and sentenced the imprisoned opposition leader to 19 years in a maximum-security prison. The closed trial took place in a high-security penal colony in the Vladimir Region, where Navalny was serving nine years for conviction of fraud and contempt of court. He was previously sentenced in 2021 to 2.5 years in prison for an alleged parole violation. Prosecutors also charged several associates of Navalny’s Anti-Corruption Foundation who resided outside the country, including Leonid Volkov, Ivan Zhdanov, Lyubov Sobol, and Georgy Alburov, in the extremism case.\n\nOn April 19, a Moscow court upheld the December 2022 decision to sentence prominent former Moscow municipal lawmaker Ilya Yashin to 8.5 years in prison for conviction of deliberately spreading false information regarding the military. Yashin had been previously convicted on misdemeanor charges of “discrediting” the military on his YouTube channel. Amnesty International and other international NGOs assessed Yashin was punished for his criticism of the war in Ukraine.\n\nOn August 4, an appeals court upheld the four-year sentence against opposition politician Andrey Pivovarov for carrying out the activities of an “undesirable organization.” Pivovarov was also banned from public and political activities for eight years. Human rights NGO Memorial considered Pivovarov a political prisoner.\n\na. Freedom of Expression, Including for Members of the Press and Other Media\n\nWhile the constitution provided for freedom of expression, including for the press and other media, the government increasingly restricted this right. Federal, regional, and local authorities used procedural violations and restrictive or vague legislation to detain, harass, or prosecute persons who criticized the government or institutions it favored. The government exercised editorial control over media, creating a media landscape in which most citizens were exposed to predominantly government-approved narratives. Significant government pressure on independent media constrained coverage of numerous topics, especially Russia’s war against Ukraine; political prisoners; treatment of LGBTQI+ persons; problems involving the environment, elections, and corruption; and criticism of local or federal leadership, as well as secessionism or federalism. The government used direct ownership or ownership by large private companies with government links to control or influence major national media and regional media outlets, especially television. Censorship and self-censorship in television and print media and on the internet were widespread, particularly regarding points of view critical of the government or its policies.\n\nFreedom of Expression: The government enacted further restrictions on freedom of expression to stifle criticism of Russia’s war against Ukraine, human rights organizations reported. On March 22, President Putin approved amendments to 2022 laws that criminalized “spreading false information” regarding Russia’s war in Ukraine and “discrediting the military.” These amendments expanded the law to cover “volunteer formations, organizations, or individuals” that helped the Russian armed forces as well as increased the maximum penalties for those who repeatedly violated the law. Authorities used these laws widely and indiscriminately to severely suppress freedom of expression, including by members of the press. As of December 19, independent rights group OVD-Info reported authorities initiated 844 criminal cases for antiwar expression, including charges of spreading “false information” and “discrediting the military.”\n\nAuthorities misused the country’s expansive definition of extremism, under which citizens could be punished for certain types of peaceful protests, affiliation with certain religious denominations, and even certain social media posts, as a tool to stifle dissent. The law prohibited the dissemination of false “socially significant information” online, in mass media, or during protests or public events, as well as the dissemination of “incorrect socially meaningful information, distributed under the guise of correct information, which creates the threat of damage to the lives and health of citizens or property, the threat of mass disruption of public order and public security, or the threat of the creation of an impediment to the functioning of life support facilities, transport infrastructure, banking, energy, industry, or communications.”\n\nThe law criminalized “offending the religious feelings of believers” (blasphemy). Conviction of actions in public “demonstrating clear disrespect for society and committed with the intent to insult the religious feelings of believers” were subject to fines, compulsory labor for up to one year, or imprisonment for up to one year. If these acts were committed in places of worship, the punishment was a fine, compulsory labor for up to three years, or a prison sentence of up to three years.\n\nThe law prohibited showing “disrespect” online for the state, authorities, the public, flag, or constitution.\n\nThe government continued to enact new restrictions on the content that could be shared on the internet. The law authorized Roskomnadzor, the country’s media oversight agency, to block websites that “violate the rights of [Russian citizens],” including by restricting the “dissemination of socially significant information.” Experts characterized the law as restricting “Russophobic” content and targeted specifically at YouTube. The law prohibited journalists and websites from publishing the personal data of law enforcement officers and certain other state employees affiliated with the country’s security services. Expanding the definition of sensitive data, the FSB published in 2021 a list of topics that could be “used against the security” of Russia, including information and assessments of the country’s military, security sector, and space agency, Roscosmos. Individuals who collected information in the specified categories could be subject to designation as “foreign agents.”\n\nDuring the year authorities invoked laws prohibiting “inciting minors to participate in dangerous activities” or “violations to the established procedure for organizing or holding a public event” to charge individuals who published material online related to demonstrations.\n\nDuring the year authorities invoked a law prohibiting the distribution of “propaganda on nontraditional sexual relations” to children to punish the exercise of free speech by LGBTQI+ persons and their supporters. The law was amended in 2022, significantly expanding the scope of the prohibition on such speech.\n\nThe law banned the display of Nazi symbols and the symbols of groups placed on the government’s list of “extremist” organizations. There was no official register or list of banned symbols, although the law prohibited displaying images of individuals found guilty of committing crimes in accordance with the verdict of the Nuremberg Tribunal. During the year, authorities enforced a law prohibiting the “propaganda of narcotics” to prosecute or threaten to block independent outlets and journalists.\n\nDuring the year authorities used a law banning cooperation with “undesirable foreign organizations” to restrict free expression. For example, in January, the independent Russian news outlet Meduza was added to the list of “undesirable organizations.”\n\nGovernment-controlled media frequently used derogatory terms such as “traitor,” “foreign agent,” and “fifth column” to describe individuals expressing views critical of or different from government policy, leading to a societal climate intolerant of dissent.\n\nVirtually all independent or opposition-leaning media outlets were blocked within the country or shut down, along with many independent NGOs. The Kremlin intensified efforts to block access to information that contradicted official narratives. Immediately following the February 2022 invasion of Ukraine, the government cracked down on independent media in the country, closing flagship liberal radio station Ekho Moskvy and independent daily newspaper Novaya Gazeta.\n\nThe education law subjected any educational activity, including informal training sessions, YouTube lectures, and peer-to-peer tutoring, to government regulation and oversight. The law also granted the government authority to approve or disapprove all elements of international educational cooperation. The law’s goal was to protect schoolchildren from “anti-Russian propaganda submitted under the guise of educational activities.” Prominent academics warned the law would stifle intellectual freedom and creativity. There were reports the government sanctioned academic personnel for their teachings, writing, research, or political views.\n\nViolence and Harassment: Journalists continued to be subjected to arrest, imprisonment, physical attack, harassment, and intimidation for their reporting. Journalists and bloggers who uncovered government malfeasance or who criticized the government often faced harassment, either in the form of direct threats to their physical safety or threats to their livelihood, frequently through legal prosecution. There were reports of government officials and police attacking journalists; police detaining journalists to interfere with or punish them for their reporting; police framing journalists for serious crimes to interfere with or punish them for their reporting; and police raids on the offices of independent media outlets that observers believed were designed to punish or pressure the outlets.\n\nFor example, journalist Yelena Milashina and lawyer Aleksandr Nemov were severely assaulted on their way to observe the sentencing of a human rights activist in Grozny, Chechnya, in July. In another example, journalist Roman Ivanov was arrested in April on charges of spreading false information regarding the army. In court, Ivanov denied the charges and accused authorities of continuously pressuring him regarding his work since 2020. Foreign journalists working in the country also faced intimidation and harassment tactics from authorities, including verbal threats, revocation of visas, withdrawal of accreditation, and arrest on spurious charges.\n\nThere was no progress during the year in establishing accountability in several high-profile killings of journalists, including the 2004 killing of Paul Klebnikov, the 2006 killing of Anna Politkovskaya, and the 2009 killing of Natalia Estemirova.\n\nCensorship or Content Restrictions for Members of the Press and Other Media, Including Online Media: The government directly and indirectly censored media, much of which occurred online.\n\nThere were reports the government retaliated against those who produced or published deemed unfavorable to the government, especially regarding its war in Ukraine. For example, on June 7, Roskomnadzor blocked all websites run by the independent human rights and media project OVD-Info. Authorities provided no reason for the move, according to OVD-Info. The International Press Institute reported at least 187 additional websites were blocked in the country in 2022 for publishing news on the war in Ukraine.\n\nSelf-censorship in independent media was also reportedly widespread.\n\nThe vast majority of the country’s mass media was funded by the government or progovernment actors. Government-friendly oligarchs owned most other outlets, which were permitted to determine what they published within formal or informal boundaries set by the government. In the regions, each governor controlled regional media through direct or indirect funding or through affiliated structures. The federal government or progovernment individuals completely or partially owned all so-called federal television channels, the only stations with nationwide reach. Government-owned media outlets often received preferential benefits, such as rent-free occupancy of government-owned buildings, and a preferential tax rate.\n\nOn a regional level, state-owned and progovernment television channels received subsidies from the Ministry of Finance for broadcasting in cities with a population of less than 100,000 and for the creation and production of content. At many government-owned or controlled outlets, the state increasingly dictated editorial policy. While the law restricted foreign ownership of media outlets to no more than 20 percent, another provision of the ambiguously worded law apparently banned foreign ownership entirely. The government used these provisions to consolidate ownership of independent outlets under progovernment oligarchs and to exert pressure on outlets that retained foreign backers.\n\nThe law required the Ministry of Justice to maintain a list of media outlets designated as “foreign agents.” The decision to designate media outlets or individual journalists as foreign agents could be made outside of court by other government bodies, including law enforcement agencies. The law allowed authorities to label individuals (both Russian and foreign citizens) as “foreign agents” if they disseminated foreign media to an unspecified number of persons, receive funding from abroad, or, after a 2020 amendment, “carry out the interests of a foreign state.” The amendment specified that a foreign journalist “performing the functions of a foreign agent, incompatible with his professional activities as a journalist” could be declared an individual foreign agent.\n\nHuman rights defenders expressed concern the “foreign agent” law was being used to restrict further the activities of or selectively punish journalists, bloggers, and social media users. Individuals labeled a “foreign agent” were required to register with the Ministry of Justice, and those living abroad also had to create and register a domestic legal entity to publish materials inside the country. All information published by the “foreign agent” individual was required to be marked as having been produced by a “foreign agent.” Failure to comply with the law could result in heavy fines.\n\nAs of August 10, there were 188 outlets and 137 individuals designated as “media foreign agents,” the majority of whom were journalists.\n\nThe government imposed onerous labeling requirements for media outlets designated as foreign agents, and the law established fines for the dissemination of information or media content regarding or belonging to a “foreign agent” without specifying this “foreign agent” status. During the year, authorities vigorously enforced labeling requirements and further intensified their campaign against “media foreign agents” in the context of a broader crackdown on independent media.\n\nThe law allowed authorities to close any organization a court determined to be extremist, including media outlets and websites. Roskomnadzor routinely issued warnings to newspapers and internet outlets it suspected of publishing extremist materials. Three warnings in one year sufficed to initiate a closure lawsuit. The law required Roskomnadzor to block, without a court decision, websites deemed to justify extremism or terrorism, if the prosecutor general or his deputy submitted a request.\n\nLibel/Slander Laws: Officials at all levels used their authority to restrict the work of and to retaliate against journalists and bloggers who criticized them, including taking legal action for alleged slander or libel, which were criminal offenses. The law prescribed criminal penalties of up to two years’ imprisonment for conviction of slander or libel “using information and telecommunications networks, including the internet.” Authorities used these laws to target human rights defenders and civil society activists in criminal investigations, including by accusing them of spreading “fake news” concerning the war in Ukraine or libelously criticizing public officials.\n\nNational Security: Authorities cited laws against treason, terrorism, and protecting national security to arrest or punish critics of the government or deter criticism of government policies or officials, such as opposition politician Vladimir Kara-Murza. There were reports critics of the government’s counterterrorism policies were themselves charged with “justifying terrorism.” On May 2, President Putin signed into law amendments to the criminal code that increased penalties for conviction of treason, terrorism, and sabotage to up to life in prison.\n\nInternet Freedom\n\nThe government restricted and disrupted access to the internet and censored online content and monitored all internet communications. According to Freedom House’s report Freedom on the Net 2023, internet freedom in the country continued to rapidly decline as authorities implemented restrictive laws to control the information space and sought to eliminate criticism of the full-scale military invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe law required internet providers to install equipment to route web traffic through servers in the country. The government employed its longstanding use of the System for Operative Investigative Activities, which required internet service providers (ISPs) to install, at their own expense, a device that routed all customer traffic to an FSB terminal. The system enabled police to track private email communications, identify internet users, and monitor their internet activity. Internet freedom advocates asserted the measure allowed for surveillance by intelligence agencies and enabled state authorities to control information and block content.\n\nThe law allowed authorities to impose significant fines for internet providers and social media companies that became repeat violators of the “sovereign internet” law by failing to install and operate state-controlled software on their systems. The “sovereign internet” law also prescribed the creation of an independent domain name system for the country, separate from the global system, which would allow the country to isolate itself from the global internet, further restricting the free flow of information. Media reported the government conducted a test of this system on July 4-5, which prevented internet users from accessing common Western websites including Google and Wikipedia but also disconnected some state-run websites such as Russian Railways.\n\nThe law required domestic and foreign businesses to store citizens’ personal data on servers physically located in the country. Companies refusing to do so could be fined, with heavier fines or being blocked from operating in the country for repeat offenses. In March, amendments to the law came into force barring banks and state-owned companies from using Western foreign messenger services such as Microsoft Teams, Skype, and WhatsApp to transfer personal or financial data. On September 30, Microsoft stopped renewing software licenses in Russia.\n\nTelecommunications companies were required to temporarily retain user data and make it available to law enforcement agencies. Observers believed the country’s security services were able to intercept and decode encrypted messages on at least some messaging platforms. The law also required telecommunications companies to provide authorities with “backdoors” around encryption technologies; companies faced fines for noncompliance.\n\nThe law required foreign tech companies with a daily audience larger than 500,000 users in the country to open official representative offices in the country by the end of the year. Local representation afforded authorities leverage to enforce fines and regulations, including content restrictions, through pressure on domestically located employees. If tech companies did not comply, Roskomnadzor was authorized to block their access to Russian users’ personal data.\n\nThe government blocked access to content and otherwise censored the internet. Roskomnadzor maintained a federal blacklist of internet sites and required ISPs to block access to web pages the agency deemed offensive or illegal, including information that was already prohibited, such as items on the Federal List of Extremist Materials. The law gave the prosecutor general and Roskomnadzor authority to demand ISPs block websites that promoted extremist information and “mass public events that are conducted in violation of appropriate procedures.” The law required social media companies to independently block and remove “obscene language” and other prohibited content.\n\nThere was a growing trend of authorities seeking to pressure social media platforms to censor posts and remove content deemed objectionable. This was especially the case with posts and content related to Russia’s war against Ukraine. According to the internet freedom NGO Roskomsvoboda, more than 10,000 websites had been blocked for allegedly distributing materials “discrediting the Russian armed forces”. Roskomsvoboda reported government agencies permanently blocked more than 1.47 million websites, citing statistics from the Prosecutor General’s Office.\n\nThe law required owners of internet search engines (news aggregators) with more than one million daily users to be accountable for the truthfulness of “publicly important” information before its dissemination. Authorities could demand that content deemed in violation be removed and imposed increasingly heavy fines for noncompliance.\n\nRoskomnadzor also sought to pressure social media companies into unblocking certain progovernment sites or individuals.\n\nA law on the “right to be forgotten” allowed individuals in the country to request that search engine companies block search results that contained information regarding them. According to Freedom House’s 2021 Freedom on the Net report, the law was “routinely applied to require search engines to delete links to websites that contain personal information regarding an individual if it is no longer considered relevant.” The law failed to limit the “right to be forgotten” when the information requested for removal was in the public interest or concerned public figures impeding freedom of expression.\n\nThere was a growing trend of social media users being prosecuted for the political, religious, or other ideological content of posts, shares, and “likes,” especially content related to Ukraine, which resulted in fines or prison sentences if convicted.\n\nThe government prohibited online anonymity. The law required commercial virtual private network (VPN) services and internet anonymizers to block access to websites and internet content prohibited in the country. The law also authorized law enforcement agencies, including the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the FSB, to identify VPN services that did not comply with the ban. By law, Roskomnadzor could also block sites that provided instructions on how to circumvent government blocking. Civil society watchdogs reported blockages of VPN servers, and media reported authorities sought to block certain kinds of VPN traffic during the year.\n\nThe law prohibited companies registered as “organizers of information dissemination,” including online messaging applications, from allowing anonymous users. Authorities could block messaging applications and platforms that failed to comply with the requirements to restrict anonymous accounts.\n\nThere were reports of politically motivated cyberattacks.\n\nb. Freedoms of Peaceful Assembly and Association\n\nThe government severely restricted freedoms of peaceful assembly and association.\n\nFreedom of Peaceful Assembly\n\nThe law provided for freedom of assembly, but local authorities restricted this right. The law required organizers of public meetings, demonstrations, or marches by more than one person to notify the government, although authorities maintained that protest organizers had to receive government permission, not just provide notification. Failure to obtain official permission to hold a protest resulted in the demonstration being viewed as unlawful by law enforcement officers, who routinely dispersed such protests. While some public demonstrations took place, on many occasions local officials selectively denied groups permission to assemble or offered alternate venues that were inconveniently or remotely located. COVID-19-related restrictions on mass events, which were used to restrict or ban public demonstrations, remained in place in some local jurisdictions despite the federal government lifting pandemic measures in July 2022.\n\nAlthough they did not require official approval, authorities restricted single-person pickets and required there be at least 55 yards separating protesters from each other. By law, police could stop a single-person picket to protect the health and safety of the picketer. The law imposed financial reporting requirements, prohibited protests or public demonstrations near agencies that performed “emergency operational services” (such as law enforcement agencies), and imposed restrictions on journalists covering these events. In addition, the law prohibited “foreign sources of funding” financing public demonstrations and treated single-person pickets, if held in the general vicinity of other picketers, as “mass demonstrations without a permit,” which were banned. Authorities regularly detained single-person picketers.\n\nPeaceful protest activity related to the war against Ukraine and its associated military mobilization was severely restricted. Media reported authorities detained at least 54 persons at antiwar protests across the country marking the anniversary of the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For example, three Moscow residents were arrested and fined for allegedly discrediting the army after visiting the monument to Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka on February 24. According to OVD-Info, as of September 27, 19,814 individuals had been detained at antiwar protests following Russia’s February 2022 invasion.\n\nThe law required “motor rallies” and “tent city” gatherings in public places receive official permission. It required gatherings that would interfere with pedestrian or vehicle traffic to receive official agreement 10 days prior to the event; those that did not affect traffic required three days’ notice. The law prohibited “mass rioting,” which included teaching and learning the organization of and participation in “mass riots.” The law allowed authorities to prohibit nighttime demonstrations and meetings and to levy fines for violating protest regulations and rules on holding public events.\n\nThe law imposed a fine for conviction of destroying infrastructure facilities and blocking roads and a 10-year prison sentence in the case of death of more than one person.\n\nThe law provided heavy penalties for engaging in unsanctioned protests and other violations of public assembly law. Protesters convicted of multiple violations within six months could be fined substantially or imprisoned for up to five years. The law prohibited “involving a minor in participation in an unsanctioned gathering,” which was punishable by fines, 100 hours of community service, or arrest for up to 15 days.\n\nArrests or detentions for organizing or taking part in unsanctioned protests were common.\n\nPolice often broke up protests that were not officially sanctioned, at times using disproportionate force. For example, on March 20, Moscow police broke up a presentation featuring the comic books of imprisoned artist Aleksandra Skochilenko, beating and detaining several attendees, including journalists covering the event. Skochilenko was detained in April 2022 on charges of disseminating false information regarding the army after she replaced price tags in a local supermarket with antiwar slogans. She faced 10 years in prison if convicted. There were reports the government penalized employees for their participation in or support of unsanctioned assemblies. Media reported several instances in which authorities charged individuals for their alleged participation in or other support of the demonstrations even when the individual charged was already detained or the statute of limitations for that particular charge had expired.\n\nThe courts rarely acknowledged violations of citizens’ rights to assemble.\n\nFreedom of Association\n\nThe constitution provided for freedom of association, but the government did not respect it. Public organizations were required to register their bylaws and the names of their leaders with the Ministry of Justice. The finances of registered organizations were subject to investigation by tax authorities, and foreign grants were required to be registered.\n\nThe government used the “foreign agents” law, which required NGOs and individuals that received foreign funding and engaged in “political activity” to register as “foreign agents,” to harass, stigmatize, and, in some cases, halt their operation. The law also applied to unregistered NGOs and loosely defined “public associations.” On July 26, President Putin signed amendments broadly expanding the definition of those who could be designated foreign agents, further increasing fines for violating the foreign agent law, barring foreign agents from participation in fundamental aspects of civic life, and permitting unscheduled inspections not only of the foreign agents themselves but also any individuals who interacted with them. In December 2022, President Putin signed into law amendments that increased penalties for failing to comply with the “foreign agent” law. In 2022, the law was amended to expand the definition of “foreign agents” to include anyone who was “under foreign influence,” a change critics said made it even easier for the state to target its domestic critics. Individuals designated as foreign agents were banned from joining the civil service, participating in electoral commissions, acting in an advisory capacity in official or public roles, teaching or engaging in educational activities for children, and participating in the organization of public assemblies. The law also permitted authorities to designate a for-profit entity as a “foreign agent.” In 2022, the Ministry of Justice combined the several existing “foreign agent” registers into a single unified list with uniform regulatory requirements. For the purposes of implementing the “foreign agents” law, the government considered “political activities” to include: organizing public events, rallies, demonstrations, marches, and pickets; organizing and conducting public debates, discussions, or presentations; ‎participating in election activities aimed at influencing the result, including election observation and forming commissions; public calls to influence local and state government bodies, including calling for changes to legislation; disseminating opinions and decisions of state bodies by technology; and attempting to shape public political views, including public opinion polls or other sociological research.\n\nTo be delisted, an NGO had to submit an application to the Ministry of Justice with evidence demonstrating it did not receive any foreign funding or engage in any political activity within the previous 12 months. If the NGO received any foreign funding, it had to return the money within three months. The ministry would then initiate an unscheduled inspection of the NGO to determine whether it qualified for removal from the list.\n\nThe law required NGOs on the foreign agents list to identify themselves as “foreign agents” in all their public materials. Authorities fined NGOs for failing to disclose their “foreign agent” status on websites or printed materials.\n\nOrganizations the government listed as “foreign agents” reported experiencing the social effects of stigmatization, such as being targeted by vandals and online criticism, in addition to losing partners and funding sources and being subjected to smear campaigns in the state-controlled press.\n\nIn July 2022, the law was expanded to create a registry of individuals determined to be “persons affiliated with foreign agents.” The law classified the contents of the registry as secret, but a June report by the State Duma Committee on Foreign Interference stated the register included the names and personal information of 861 individuals as of December 2022.\n\nThe law required the Ministry of Justice to maintain a list of “undesirable foreign organizations.” The list expanded during the year to 124 organizations as of December 20.\n\nBy law a foreign organization could be found “undesirable” if it was deemed “dangerous to the foundations of the constitutional order of the Russian Federation, its national security, and defense.” Authorities did not clarify what specific threats these “undesirable” NGOs posed to the country. Any foreign organization deemed “undesirable” was required to cease its activities. Any money or assets found by authorities could be seized, and any citizens found guilty of continuing to work with the organization in contravention of the law could face up to seven years in prison. A 2021 law prohibited Russian citizens in any country from taking part in the work of NGOs designated as undesirable in Russia and from transferring money to the country from certain countries under monitoring by the Federal Financial Monitoring Service, regardless of the transferred amount.\n\nAuthorities imposed criminal penalties for purported violations of the law on “undesirable foreign organizations.” For example, on August 17, less than one month before regional elections, Investigative Committee officers detained Grigory Melkonyants, co-chair of leading election monitoring group Golos, and charged him with carrying out the activities of an “undesirable organization.” He faced up to six years in prison if convicted.\n\nNGOs engaged in political activities or activities that purportedly “pose a threat to the country” or that received support from United States citizens or organizations were subject to suspension under the 2012 “Dima Yakovlev” law, which prohibited NGOs from having members with dual Russian-United States citizenship.\n\nAuthorities continued to misuse the country’s expansive definition of extremism to stifle freedom of association. The law prohibited members of “extremist” organizations from participating in all federal, regional, and local elections. An organization’s founders and leaders were barred from running for elected office for five years from the date of the organization’s ban, while members and others “involved in its work” were barred for three years. The courts could deem a person to be “involved” if that individual made a statement of support for the group, transferred money to it, or offered any other form of “assistance.” The ban could also apply retroactively, barring individuals from running for office if they were involved with the group up to three years prior to the extremist designation. Experts and political activists decried the law as politically motivated and unconstitutional.\n\nIn multiple cases authorities arbitrarily arrested and prosecuted civil society activists in political retaliation for their work.\n\nThere were reports authorities targeted NGOs and activists representing LGBTQI+ persons for retaliation.\n\nAuthorities misused antiterrorism and antiextremism laws, as well as other measures, to label wrongfully peaceful religious groups and their practices “terrorist,” “extremist,” and “undesirable.” Among those designated without any credible evidence of violent actions or intentions were two foreign-based Church of Scientology organizations, four Protestant groups from Latvia and Ukraine, a regional branch of Falun Gong and seven Falun Gong-associated NGOs, Jehovah’s Witnesses, the Fayzrakhmani Islamic community, Tablighi Jamaat, followers of the Muslim theologian Said Nursi, and Hizb ut-Tahrir. These designations effectively banned the worship and activities of these groups, and members were subject to prolonged imprisonment, harsh detention conditions, house arrest and house raids, discrimination, harassment, and criminal investigation for participating in the activities of a banned organization.\n\nThere were reports civil society activists were beaten or attacked in retaliation for their professional activities and that in most cases law enforcement officers did not adequately investigate the incidents.\n\nElections and Political Participation\n\nAbuses or Irregularities in Recent Elections: National elections were widely reported to not be fair and free of abuses and irregularities. The September 2021 national elections for the State Duma were neither free nor fair, according to an election observation NGO. Observers cited fraud and electoral law violations during voting and vote counting that undermined public confidence in the elections and cast serious doubt on the integrity of the reported results. Ahead of the elections, authorities intensified repression of independent observers and media, including by designating the independent election observation group Golos and dozens of media outlets and individuals as “foreign agents,” “undesirable,” or “extremist.” Authorities disproportionately denied registration to independent and “nonsystemic” opposition candidates. Authorities harassed or restricted gatherings, campaign communications, and other political activities of opposition candidates and prodemocracy groups, often charging participants with violating COVID-19 protocols. Authorities banned many would-be candidates from running for office and pressured several to leave the country. Roskomnadzor blocked or entirely removed “certain” online campaign materials during federal or regional elections, including 49 websites linked to opposition figure Aleksey Navalny.\n\nThe Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) reported the 2018 presidential election “took place in an overly controlled environment, marked by continued pressure on critical voices” and “restrictions on the fundamental freedoms, as well as on candidate registration… resulted in a lack of genuine competition.” Observers noted the most prominent potential challenger, Aleksey Navalny, was prevented from registering his candidacy due to a previous politically motivated criminal conviction and incarceration.\n\nDuring the September 10 regional elections, pro-Kremlin candidates won all gubernatorial races and maintained large majorities in regional parliaments and major city councils in which elections were held. Independent monitors alleged widespread voting irregularities, including harassment of observers, ballot-stuffing, carousel voting, and extensive violations of rules governing the security of ballots. Independent observers assessed electronic voting systems to be insufficiently transparent and potentially conducive to facilitation of electoral fraud.\n\nIn parallel with the country’s September regional elections, Russian authorities organized sham “elections” on territories of Ukraine occupied by Russia in violation of Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\n\nPolitical Parties and Political Participation: The process for nominating candidates for the office of the president was highly regulated and placed significant burdens on opposition parties and their candidates. While parties represented in the State Duma could nominate a presidential candidate without having to collect and submit signatures, prospective self-nominated presidential candidates were required to collect 300,000 signatures, no more than 7,500 from each region, and submit the signatures to the Central Election Commission for certification. Presidential candidates nominated by parties without State Duma representation had to collect 100,000 signatures. An independent presidential candidate was ineligible to run if the commission found more than 5 percent of signatures invalid. In June, media reported there were no independent candidates for the regional governorships contested in the September 10 regional elections, citing a statement from Sergey Perminov, deputy secretary general of the ruling United Russia party. Significant burdens existed for registering as a candidate in State Duma elections. State Duma candidates could be nominated directly by constituents, political parties in single-mandate districts, or political parties on their federal list, or could self-nominate. While any registered political party could run candidates on the party list portion of the ballot, parties that did not overcome the 5 percent threshold during the previous elections were required to collect 200,000 signatures. Self-nominated candidates had to gather the signatures of 3 percent of the voters in their districts.\n\nObservers reported similar rules for nominating candidates for regional heads requiring the support of municipal deputies – known as the “municipal filter” – were not applied equally. Authorities pressured municipal deputies not to provide signatures to certain candidates, preventing competitive independent candidates from passing through the municipal filter, while progovernment candidates were able to pass through the filter without fulfilling technical requirements. In a July report, Golos assessed the municipal filter would prevent real competition in the September 10 regional elections. In December 2022, Yabloko Party Pskov Regional chair Lev Shlosberg announced his party would not put forward a candidate for governor, citing the municipal filter. On June 16, the Ministry of Justice added Shlosberg to its foreign agent list.\n\nOpposition parties were repeatedly denied registration or faced court-mandated suspensions of their activities. Authorities used restrictive laws on “foreign agents,” “extremism,” and “discrediting” the armed forces to block dozens of candidates from running for office or portray them as unpatriotic.\n\nSystemic opposition parties (i.e., parties that were quasi-independent but generally loyal to the Kremlin and permitted to occupy seats in the Duma) also faced pressure. According to a July Golos report, federal authorities put increased pressure on systemic opposition parties in the wake of the February 2022 full-scale invasion of Ukraine. For example, Golos alleged authorities put forward “spoiler candidates” from the Communists of Russia Party to challenge candidates from the similarly named Communist Party of Russia (KPRF) in the September 10 regional elections. In August, media reported the Communists of Russia were running “doppelganger” candidates with the same or similar names to KPRF candidates.\n\nThere were reports government resources were used for campaign purposes. For example, state entities or entities closely aligned with the state influenced their employees to vote a certain way or in a specific location. Intense repression against civil society organizations limited their ability to monitor and comment on election processes. Authorities restricted speech related to the war against Ukraine and maintained COVID-19-related restrictions on public gatherings that effectively banned traditional campaign events).\n\nParticipation of Women and Members of Marginalized or Vulnerable Groups: No laws limited participation of women and members of minority groups in the political process, and they did participate. Women’s participation remained low, accounting for approximately 18 percent of elected seats in the national legislature. As of September, only three out of 31 members of the Russian cabinet were women. While members of national minorities took an active part in political life, ethnic Russians, who constituted approximately 80 percent of the population, dominated the political and administrative system, particularly at the federal level.\n\nWomen\n\nRape and Domestic Violence: The law criminalized rape and provided the same punishment for a relative, including a spouse or domestic partner, who committed rape as for a nonrelative. The penalty for conviction of rape was three to six years’ imprisonment for a single offense, with additional time imposed for aggravating factors. According to NGOs, many law enforcement personnel and prosecutors did not consider spousal or acquaintance rape a priority and did not encourage reporting or prosecuting such cases. NGOs reported local police officers sometimes refused to respond to rape or domestic violence calls unless the survivor’s life was directly threatened. Authorities typically did not consider rape or attempted rape to be life threatening.\n\nDomestic violence remained a significant problem. The law contained no domestic violence provision nor a legal definition of domestic violence, making it difficult to know its actual prevalence in the country. The law considered beatings by “close relatives” an administrative rather than a criminal offense for first-time offenders, provided the beating did not cause serious harm requiring hospital treatment. The antidomestic-violence NGO ANNA Center estimated 70 percent of women who experienced domestic violence did not seek help due to fear of retribution from a partner, public shame, lack of financial independence from their partners, or lack of confidence in law enforcement authorities. Laws addressing bodily harm were general in nature and did not permit police to initiate a criminal investigation unless the survivor filed a complaint. The burden of collecting evidence in such cases typically fell on the survivors through a process known as private prosecution, which the ANNA Center stated severely disadvantaged survivors. The law prohibited threats, assault, battery, and killing, but most acts of domestic violence did not fall within the jurisdiction of the Prosecutor’s Office. The law did not provide for protection orders; experts believed protection orders could be a tool to keep women safe from experiencing recurrent violence by their partners.\n\nOn February 7, the ECHR ruled Russian authorities violated Article 3 of the European Convention against Torture during an investigation into the alleged sexual abuse of a minor. The survivor alleged investigators interviewed her 23 times and put her in direct contact with her abusers, resulting in her retraumatization. In 2021, the ECHR ruled in a separate case that Russian authorities had violated the European Convention on Human Rights by failing to establish a legal framework for combating the “staggering scale” of domestic violence and holding the perpetrators to account.\n\nAccording to NGOs, police were often unwilling to register complaints of domestic violence, stating cases were “family matters,” frequently discouraged survivors from submitting complaints, and often pressed survivors to reconcile with abusers. Most domestic violence cases filed with authorities were either dismissed on technical grounds or transferred to a reconciliation process conducted by a justice of the peace whose focus was on preserving the family rather than punishing the perpetrator. NGOs estimated only 3 percent of such cases eventually reached the courts. Survivors of domestic violence in the North Caucasus experienced difficulty seeking protection from authorities. There were reports women defending themselves from domestic violence were charged with crimes.\n\nNGOs noted government-operated institutions provided services to affected women such as social apartments, hospital wards, and shelters. Access to these services was often complicated, since they required proof of residency in that municipality, as well as proof of low-income status. In many cases, these documents were controlled by the abusers and not available to survivors.\n\nThere were reports government agents incited, perpetrated, and condoned gender-based violence in the course of the country’s war in Ukraine.\n\nFemale Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C): The law did not specifically prohibit FGM/C. NGOs in Dagestan reported FGM/C was occasionally practiced in some villages.\n\nOther Forms of Gender-based Violence or Harassment: Human rights groups reported so-called honor killings of women persisted in Chechnya, Dagestan, and elsewhere in the North Caucasus, but the cases were rarely reported or acknowledged. Local police, doctors, and lawyers often collaborated with the families involved to cover up the crimes. In parts of the North Caucasus, women and girls faced bride kidnapping, polygamy, forced marriage (including early and child marriage), legal discrimination, virginity testing before marriage, and forced adherence to Islamic dress codes. Women in the North Caucasus often lost custody of their children after the father’s death or a divorce due to traditional law that prohibited women from living in a house without a man. The law did not prohibit sexual harassment, although the law contained general prohibitions against compelling a person to perform actions of a sexual character by means of blackmail or threats, or by taking advantage of the survivor’s economic or other dependence on the perpetrator. There were no criminal or civil remedies for sexual harassment experienced in the workplace. Sexual harassment was reportedly widespread, but courts often rejected survivors’ claims due to lack of sufficient evidence.\n\nDiscrimination: The constitution and law provided the same legal status and rights for women and men, but women often encountered significant restrictions. Women experienced discrimination in employment, occupation, and access to credit. Employers often preferred to hire men to save on perceived maternity and child-care costs. While the law prohibited employer discrimination in posting job vacancy information such as requests for specific gender and age, vacancy announcements sometimes specified gender and age requirements or a desired physical appearance. The law prohibited women from holding 100 jobs deemed hazardous and arduous, including firefighting, mining, construction, factory work, agriculture, energy, transportation and steam boiler repair.\n\nReproductive Rights: There were no reports of coerced abortion or involuntary sterilization on the part of government authorities during the year, although there had been such reports in previous years.\n\nThere were significant social and cultural barriers to family planning and reproductive health in the North Caucasus republics, including cases of FGM/C.\n\nThere were no legal restrictions on access to contraceptives, but very few citizens received any kind of sexual education, hampering their effectiveness. Senior government officials and church and conservative groups in the country stridently advocated for increasing the birth rate, and their opposition to family planning initiatives contributed to a social stigma that also affected the use of contraceptives.\n\nAccess to family planning and skilled medical attendance at birth varied widely based on geography and was often extremely limited in rural areas.\n\nThe government did not deny access to sexual and reproductive health services for survivors of sexual violence, but survivors did not always seek needed treatment due to social stigma. Emergency contraception and postexposure prophylaxis was readily available as part of clinical management of rape in urban centers but not necessarily in rural areas.\n\nActs of Violence, Criminalization, and Other Abuses Based on Sexual Orientation, Gender Identity or Expression, or Sex Characteristics\n\nCriminalization: The law did not criminalize consensual same-sex sexual conduct between adults, cross-dressing, or other sexual or gender characteristic-related behaviors, but a law prohibited gender transition procedures and gender affirming care (see below), and authorities used laws prohibiting the promotion of “nontraditional sexual relations” to justify the arbitrary arrest of LGBTQI+ persons.\n\nViolence and Harassment: There were reports state actors committed violence against LGBTQI+ individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity, particularly in Chechnya. There were reports government agents attacked, harassed, and threatened LGBTQI+ activists. There were instances of nonstate actor violence targeting LGBTQI+ persons and of police often failing to respond adequately to such incidents.\n\nFor example, media reported that on February 15, Moscow airport police arbitrarily arrested and forcibly disappeared Idris Arsamikov as he returned to the Netherlands after attending his father’s funeral in Chechnya. In 2018, Arsamikov fled Russia following his detention and torture by Chechen police in connection with his presumed homosexuality. According to media, Shelkovsky District police in Chechnya refused to disclose his whereabouts, and the Investigative Committee in Chechnya refused to investigate his disappearance.\n\nA 2022 report from the Coming Out and the Sphere Foundation showed 7 percent of LGBTQI+ respondents in a survey experienced physical violence, 8 percent experienced sexual violence, and 13 percent experienced blackmail or extortion. Many respondents, particularly transgender individuals, reported they believed they were more vulnerable and unsafe in the wake of the country’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine. The report also noted transgender persons were uniquely vulnerable to violence. The Sphere Foundation claimed law enforcement authorities did not always protect the rights of LGBTQI+ individuals and were sometimes the source of violence themselves. As a result, LGBTQI+ individuals had extremely low levels of trust in courts and police.\n\nDiscrimination: The law did not prohibit discrimination by state or nonstate actors against LGBTQI+ persons with respect to essential goods and services such as housing, employment, or access to government services such as health care. LGBTQI+ persons reported significant societal stigma and discrimination, which some attributed to official promotion of homophobia, including campaigns on state-controlled media that derided LGBTQI+ persons as “perverts” and conflated homosexuality with pedophilia. Activists asserted most LGBTQI+ persons hid their sexual orientation or gender identity in the workplace due to fear of losing their jobs or homes, as well as the risk of violence. LGBTQI+ students reported discrimination at schools and universities. Medical practitioners reportedly continued to limit or deny LGBTQI+ persons health services due to intolerance and prejudice; the Russian LGBT Network reported LGBTQI+ individuals seeking health care often encountered strong negative reactions and the presumption they were mentally ill. There were reports LGBTQI+ persons faced discrimination in parental rights. According to the 2022 Coming Out/Sphere report, LGBTQI+ individuals reported experiencing an increase in discrimination following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n\nAvailability of Legal Gender Recognition: On July 24, President Putin signed a law banning legal gender recognition, medical interventions aimed at changing the sex of a person, and gender-affirming care. The only exception was for medical interventions to treat congenital anomalies. The law also annulled marriages in which one person “changed gender” and barred transgender individuals from becoming foster or adoptive parents. On March 16, a court in Tyumen invalidated a marriage after one spouse changed their gender identity marker on legal documents.\n\nInvoluntary or Coercive Medical or Psychological Practices: There were reports of LGBTQI+ persons being targeted for involuntary “conversion therapy.” On June 26, Radio Liberty reported a student, age 22, was forced by his parents to undergo conversion-therapy treatment at the Inextinguishable Hope center in the Ramensky District of Moscow Region. There were reports police conducted involuntary physical exams of transgender or intersex persons. The Association of Russian-speaking Intersex reported medical specialists often pressured intersex persons (or their parents if they were underage) into having so-called normalization surgery without providing accurate information regarding the procedure or what being intersex meant.\n\nRestrictions ofFreedom of Expression, Association, or Peaceful Assembly: On November 30, the Supreme Court granted a Ministry of Justice request to designate the “international LGBT public movement” as an extremist organization. No such formal organization existed, leading to widespread concerns the designation could allow authorities to arbitrarily target any LGBTQI+ person or advocate for the human rights of LGBTQI+ persons with criminal charges. During the year, authorities developed and issued implementing regulations for amendments adopted in December 2022 that broadened the law criminalizing the distribution of “propaganda” of “nontraditional sexual relations” to children. The law effectively limited the rights of free expression and assembly for citizens who wished to advocate publicly for the rights of LGBTQI+ persons or express the opinion that homosexuality was normal. The law completely banned such “propaganda” among persons of all ages through media, including the internet, advertising, literature, and cinema. The law also banned the sale of goods containing “prohibited information” and gave Roskomnadzor the authority to monitor and block entities that distributed “prohibited information.” Under the law, individuals faced significant administrative fines for “LGBT propaganda” or “demonstrations of LGBT and information that encourages a change of gender among teenagers.” These fines were significantly greater for legal entities.\n\nRoskomnadzor used the law to block websites and file administrative charges against numerous individuals and legal entities, including bookstores, theaters, and media companies. For example, on August 2, a St. Petersburg court fined state-owned digital services provider Rostelecom one million rubles ($10,200) for broadcasting films such as The Curse of Chucky showing “nontraditional sexual relations.” In another example, on May 4, a Moscow court fined Yan Dvorkin, the leader of the Center T Group, which assisted transgender and nonbinary persons, 100,000 rubles ($1,260) for disseminating “LGBT propaganda.” Dvorkin was denounced by Moscow’s child protection services, who monitored Dvorkin’s adopted child, and accused the activist of “LGBT propaganda” in relation to his online descriptions of his relationship with his partner.\n\nAuthorities used the law on propaganda of “nontraditional sexual relations” and other laws, such as the foreign agent law, to pressure LGBTQI+ rights organizations. For example, on April 14, the Ministry of Justice designated the Rainbow Association, an LGBTQI+ human rights organization, as a foreign agent."
