        "text": "1\n\nVladimir Putin, “Being Strong: National Security Guaran­tees for Russia”, Russia Today, 19 February 2012, https://www. rt.com/politics/official-word/strong-putin-military-russia-711/. See also Putin’s speech to the 2018 Federal Assembly in which he accused the US of ignoring Russian security con­cerns while Russia’s armed forces were weak. The nuclear mod­ernisation projects announced would mean that Washington would now have to listen. “Presidential Address to the Fed­eral Assembly”, President of Russia (official website), 1 March 2018, http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/news/56957.\n\n2\n\nIn the National Security Strategy from 2015, Russia is referred to as “one of the world’s leading powers”. According to Russia’s Foreign Policy Concept from 2016, the task of for­eign policy is to consolidate the country’s status as “a centre of influence in the world today”. “Strategija nacional’noj bezopasnosti Rossijskoj Federacii” [The National Security Strategy of the Russian Federation], Sovet Bezopasnosti Rossijskoj Federacii [The Security Council of the Russian Federation] (official website), 31 Dececmber 2015, http://www.scrf.gov. ru/security/docs/document133/; “Foreign Policy Con­cept of the Russian Federation”, The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation (official website), 1 December 2016, http:// www.mid.ru/en/foreign_policy/official_ documents/-/asset_ publisher/CptICkB6BZ29/content/id/ 2542248.\n\n3\n\nWilliam Safire, “On Language; The Near Abroad”, The New York Times Magazine, 22 May 1994, http://www.nytimes.com/ 1994/05/22/magazine/on-language-the-near-abroad.html.\n\n4\n\n“Ukaz Prezidenta Rossijskoj Federacii ot 14.09.1995 g. No. 940 ‘Ob utverzhdenii strategicheskogo kursa Rossijskoj Federacii s gosudarstvami – uchastnikami Sodruzhestva Nesavisimych Gosudarstv’” [Decree of the President of the Russian Federation from 14 September 1995, No. 940, “Set­ting the strategic course of the Russian Federation with the participating countries of the Commonwealth of In­depend­ent States”], Prezident Rossii [President of Russia] (official web­site), 14 September 1995, http://kremlin.ru/acts/bank/8307.\n\n5\n\n“Interview Given by Dmitry Medvedev to Television Chan­nels Channel One, Rossia, NTV”, President of Russia (official website), 31 August 2008, http://en.kremlin.ru/events/ president/transcripts/48301.\n\n6\n\nEven though political leaders avoid the term “zone of in­fluence”, it is certainly used as self-ascription in the political and military debate. For instance, influential military think­ers Chekinov and Bogdanov call the post-Soviet space a “zone of traditional influence”. S. G. Chekinov and S. A. Bog­danov, “Osobennosti obecpechenija voennoj bezopasnosti Rossii v XXI stoletii v usloviach globalizacii” [The Features of Ensur­ing Military Security in 21st Century Russia in Con­ditions of Globalisation], Voennaya Mysl’, no. 6 (2016): 37–51 (50).\n\n7\n\nAlthough Russia has recognised the territorial integrity and state sovereignty of Ukraine in international treaties, this is considered an artificial construct, as can be seen in Putin’s statement that Russians and Ukrainians are “basically one people”. “Bol’shaya press-konferenciya Vladimira Pu­tina” [Major Press Conference by Vladimir Putin], Prezident Rossii [President of Russia] (official website), 14 December 2017, http://kremlin.ru/events/president/news/56378. This view is also shared by large parts of the population. In an opinion poll conducted by research institute Levada in 2017, 61 percent of respondents would not classify Belarus and Ukraine, and 44 percent Georgia, as “foreign countries”. However, only 25 percent considered it right that Russia use all available means – including military ones – to keep the former Soviet republics under its control; 65 percent did not agree. “Mezhdunarodnye otnoshenia” [International Rela­tions], Levada-Zentr (official website), 2 February 2017, http:// www.levada.ru/2017/02/02/mezhdunarodnye-otnosheniya-5/.\n\n8\n\nIn 1995, President Yeltsin had already called for the CIS states not to join an alliance directed against one member state. He also called for third countries or international orga­nisations to cooperate with CIS member countries on the assumption that they were “first and foremost a Russian zone of interest”. Similarly, the draft contract on Euro-Atlantic security regulations presented by then President Medvedev in 2008 stipulates that no actor should undertake actions that are perceived by the other side as endangering their own security. However, no objective criteria are spe­cified as to what actions should be taken. Under this subjectively interpretable category, Russia could have denied the post-Soviet states close adherence to and accession to NATO. Ten years after the Russo-Georgian war, Prime Minister Medvedev warned Georgia and NATO of a “terrible conflict” should the country join the Alliance. “Ukaz Prezidenta Ros­sijskoj Federacii ot 14.09.1995” (see note 4); “The Draft of the European Security Treaty”, President of Russia (official website), 29 November 2009, http://eng.kremlin.ru/news/275; “Med­vedev Warns against Conflict”, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 7 August 2018, 8.\n\n9\n\nIn March 1993, President Yeltsin urged international organisations to grant Russia “special powers as a guarantor of peace and stability in the former Soviet territories”. Itar-Tass, 1 March 1993.\n\n10\n\nSee Roy Allison, Russia, the West, and Military Intervention (Oxford, 2013).\n\n11\n\n“O vnesenii izmenenij v Federal’nyj zakon ‘ob oborone’” [On the introduction of amendments to the Federal Law “On Defence”], Rossijskaya Gazeta, 9 November 2009, https://rg.ru/ 2009/11/13/armia-dok.html.\n\n12\n\nIn Moldova, including the breakaway region of Trans­nistria, ethnic Russians accounted for 9 percent, Turkmenistan 5 percent and Uzbekistan, Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Tajikistan less than 3 percent each of their respective national populations. Figures refer to the last census in the respective countries.\n\n13\n\nThe russkij mir (Russian World) concept goes even further. In it, Moscow appears as a protective power not only of Russian citizens and ethnic Russians, but also of the Russian-speaking population and all those people who, as Putin put it, “see themselves as part of Russia and regard Russia as their homeland”. Although the broad russkij mir protection claim does not give the Russian President any legal authority to use troops abroad, nevertheless, it can increase political pressure on a target country. During the Ukraine crisis in 2014, Putin repeatedly referred to the con­cept of russkij mir, but has not used it since. “Reception to Mark National Unity Day”, President of Russia (official website), 4 November 2013, http://en.kremlin.ru/events/president/ news/19562; cf. Vera Zakem, Paul Saunders and Daniel Antoun, Mobilizing Compatriots: Russia’s Strategy, Tactics, and Influence in the Former Soviet Union (Arlington, VA: CNA, 2015).\n\n14\n\nRussia’s leaders justified the intervention in Georgia in 2008 as self-defence since Russian peacekeepers had been shot in South Ossetia. In addition, they referred – still with no corresponding legal basis – to the protection of Russian citizens, which had previously come from their own pass­portizacija policy in South Ossetia and Abkhazia. On 1 March 2014, Putin had the Federation Council grant approval for an intervention in Ukraine to protect the lives of “citizens of the Russian Federation, our compatriots and personnel of the military contingent of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation stationed in the territory of Ukraine”. “Vladimir Putin vnes obrashchenie v Sovet Federacii” [Speech delivered by Vladimir Putin to the Federation Council], Prezident Rossii [President of Russia] (official website), 1 March 2014, http:// kremlin.ru/events/president/news/20353. See Emmanuel Karagiannis, “The Russian Interventions in South Ossetia and Crimea Compared: Military Performance, Legitimacy and Goals”, Contemporary Security Policy 35, no. 3 (2014): 400–20.\n\n15\n\nMilitary doctrine distinguishes between military dangers and threats, the former being the precursor to the latter. Ac­cording to the doctrine, the following developments are clas­sified as dangers in the “neighbourhood of Russia”: “armed conflicts and their escalation”, “interethnic and interdenomi­national tensions”, “activities of radical international armed groups and private military companies” and the “establish­ment of regimes that compromise Russian interests”. “Mili­tary threat” means “military demonstration of power in the course of exercises” and the “intensification of the activity of armed forces including their partial or full mobilization”. “Voennaja Doktrina Rossijskoj Federacii” [Military Doctrine of the Russian Federation], Sovet Bezopasnosti Rossijskoj Federacii [Security Council of the Russian Federation] (official website), 25 December 2014, http://www.scrf.gov.ru/security/military/ document129/.\n\n16\n\nSee Sabine Fischer, “Russian Policy in the Unresolved Conflicts”, in Not Frozen! The Unresolved Conflicts over Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia and Nagorno-Karabakh in Light of the Crisis over Ukraine, (ed.)

In 2017, 2,800 soldiers from Georgia, the US, UK, Germany, Turkey, Ukraine and Slovenia took part in Noble Trident in Georgia. The Rapid Trident exercise took place in the same year in Ukraine with 1,650 soldiers from 15 countries.\n\n18\n\nNATO responded to the crisis over Ukraine with re­assurance measures for eastern member states and amendments to the Atlantic Alliance’s military posture as a whole. Reassurance measures include increased air policing in the Baltic States, more exercises in the eastern member states (e.g. Sabre Strike 2018 with 18,000 soldiers) or the formally rotation-based deployment of four multinational NATO battlegroups in Lithuania, Latvia, Estonia and Poland (En­hanced Forward Presence). The adaptation measures are reflected above all in the strengthening of Alliance defence capabilities.\n\n19\n\n“Strategija nacional’noj bezopasnosti” (see note 2); “O vnesenii izmenenij v Federal’nyj zakon ‘ob oborone’” (see note 11).\n\n20\n\nIn April 2008, NATO promised Georgia and Ukraine membership, but did not name a specific date. “Bucharest Summit Declaration”, NATO (official website), 3 April 2008, https://www.nato.int/cps/ua/natohq/official_texts_8443.htm.\n\n21\n\nThe expansion of NATO, the “deployment of foreign troops” in the neighbourhood of Russia and “bringing mili­tary infrastructure” to the borders of Russia are seen as a danger in military doctrine and “military demonstration of power in the course of exercises” as a threat. “Voennaya Doktrina Rossijskoj Federacii” (see note 15).\n\n22\n\nValerij Gerasimov, “Cennost’ nauki i predvidenija” [The Value of Science and Foresight], Voenno-promyshlennyj kur’er, 26 February 2013, https://www.vpk-news.ru/articles/ 14632; Valerij Gerasimov, “Mir na granjach vojny” [Peace on the Verge of War], Voenno-promyshlennyj kur’er, 13 March 2017, https://www.vpk-news.ru/articles/35591.\n\n23\n\nSee A.

These include the state of the Russian armed forces in relation to those of other post-Soviet countries. An assessment was made based on budget resources, weapon systems, personnel and levels of professionalisation and training. It is important not only to consider regular soldiers, but also non-regular proxies which play a major role in hybrid operations. The present paper also considers rapid deployment and forward military presence (military bases) because these factors are necessary in order to project power in the region. See Ashley J. Tellis et al., Measuring National Power in the Postindustrial Age (Santa Monica, CA, 2000), 133–76; David Clowes and Dominika Choroś-Mro­zowska, “Aspects of Global Security – the Measurement of Power & Its Projection: Results from Twenty Selected Countries (2000–2013)”, Journal of International Studies 8, no. 1 (2015): 53–66.\n\n26\n\nThe figures used here correspond to the narrow defini­tion of the Russian budget item ‘National Defence’. Where expenses included in other Russian budget items need to be added so they meet the NATO definition of defence spending, then these figures are significantly higher, i.e. $61.7 bil­lion in 2017. The International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS) (ed.), The Military Balance. The Annual Assessment of Global Military Capabilities and Defense Economics (London, 2018), 192. In 2017, the defence budget fell for the first time since the introduction of military reform. However, this is not a fun­damental change of policy; rather, budget allocations to the military had peaked before 2016. Modest cuts were made in 2017 due to general budgetary savings and financial adjustment measures. See Janis Kluge, Russlands Staatshaushalt unter Druck. Finanzielle und politische Risiken der Stagnation, SWP-Stu­die 14/2018 (Berlin: Stiftung Wissenschaft und Politik, July 2018), 25.\n\n27\n\nIISS (ed.), The Military Balance (see note 26).\n\n28\n\nJurij Gavrilov, “Krizis: Armiya ne otstupaet” [Crisis: The Army Is Not Retreating], Rossijskaja Gazeta, 19 March 2009, https://rg.ru/2009/03/19/krizis.html.\n\n29\n\nThe “State Armaments Programme 2011–2020” was allocated 19 trillion roubles, at that time the equivalent of 580 billion euros. There has been a hefty debate between the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Defence since 2016 over the subsequent “State Armaments Programme 2018–2027”. At 19 trillion roubles, 274 billion euros at the current exchange rate, it represents a compromise. Richard Connolly and Mathieu Boulègue, Russia’s New State Armament Programme: Implications for the Russian Armed Forces and Military Capabilities to 2027 (London: Chatham House, 10 May 2018); Ivan Safro­nov and Alexandra Dzhordzhevich, “19 trillionov prinimajut na vooruzhenie” [Defence Gets 19 Trillion], Kommersant, 15 November 2017, https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/3467573.\n\n30\n\n“Ministr oborony Rossijskoj Federacii Sergej Shojgu vys­tupil na zasedanii Gosdumy v ramkach ‘pravitel’stvennogo chasa’” [Minister of Defence of the Russian Federation, Sergei Schoigu, at the meeting of the State Duma during the gov­ernment session], Ministerstvo Oborony Rossijskoj Federacii [Min­istry of Defense of the Russian Federation] (official website), 22 February 2017, http://function.mil.ru/news_page/country/ more.htm?id=12112634@egNews&. The numbers are difficult to verify because there are no clear criteria for ‘modernity’ and it is not clear what the percentages refer to precisely.\n\n31\n\nIn February 2017, Minister of Defence Shoigu confirmed that an Information Warfare Directorate had been created at the Ministry of Defence in 2013 and announced it was estab­lishing Information Operations Troops. “Ministr oborony Rossijskoj Federacii Sergej Shojgu vystupil” (see note 30).\n\n32\n\nThese include rifles for snipers and anti-tank missiles. See Andrzej Wilk, The Best Army Ukraine Has Ever Had. Changes in Ukraine’s Armed Forces since the Russian Aggression, OSW Studies, no. 66 (Warsaw: Ośrodek Studiów Wschodnich [OSW], July 2017).\n\n33\n\nIn order to increase the number of soldiers that can be deployed rapidly on foreign missions, since November 2016 kontraktniki have also been able to sign up for a short period of twelve months. In addition, since 2003, foreign citizens have been allowed to serve in the Russian armed forces on a contractual basis, and since October 2017 they have also been allowed to participate in military operations abroad. “Ministr oborony Rossijskoj Federacii Sergej Shojgu vystupil” (see note 30); “Ukaz Prezidenta Rossijskoj Federacii ‘O vne­senii izmenenij v Polozhenie o porjadke prochozhdenija voennoj sluzhby’” [Decree by the President of the Russian Federation: “On the Introduction of Amendments to Regu­lations Governing Military Service”.], Oficialnyj internet-portal pravovoj informacii [Official Internet portal for legal informa­tion], 8 October 2017, http://publication.pravo.gov.ru/ Document/View/0001201710090001?index=0&rangeSize=1.\n\n34\n\nSergej Ptichkin, “Desant peresjadet na tanki” [Para­troopers are Coming with Tanks], Rossijskaja Gazeta, 24 May 2016, https://rg.ru/2016/05/24/vdv-poluchat-tiazheluiu-brone tehniku.html.\n\n35\n\nAndrej Bondarenko, “Mirotvorcy v golubych beretach” [Peacekeepers in Blue Berets], Krasnaja Zvezda, 18 June 2013.\n\n36\n\nSee Aleksey Nikolsky, “Russian Special Operations Forces: Further Development or Stagnation?”, Moscow Defense Brief, no. 4 (2014): 25f.\n\n37\n\nIn addition to an annual large-scale exercise which alternates between the various strategic directions (“West”, “Caucasus”, “Centre” and “East”), unannounced large-scale exercises (snap exercises) have been taking place again since 2013. While the former tests various aspects of warfare, the latter tests the readiness of the armed forces.\n\n38\n\nBased on data from Johan Norberg, Training to Fight. Russia’s Major Military Exercises 2011–2014, FOI-R--4128--SE (Stockholm: Totalförsvarets forskningsinstitut [Swedish Defence Research Agency; FOI], December 2015). At the same time, the complexity of the scenarios tested continued to increase. Between 2014 and 2015, for example, there were 30 percent more joint military exercises. IISS (ed.), The Mili­tary Balance (see note 26), 187.\n\n39\n\nThe real number of participating soldiers was presum­ably lower since Russia’s military leadership tends to count military units in full strength and not the exact number of those soldiers that took part in the exercises.\n\n40\n\n“Ministr oborony Rossijskoj Federacii Sergej Shojgu vystu­pil” (see note 30).\n\n41\n\nAzerbaijan and Kazakhstan, in particular, have increased training activities for their armed forces. Kazakh pilots now have similar training loads to Russian pilots with 100 hours’ training a year. Rashid Shirinov, “Azerbaijani Army Begins Large-scale Military Drills”, Azernews, 18 September 2017, https://www.azernews.az/nation/119127.html; IISS (ed.), The Military Balance (see note 26), 186.\n\n42\n\nSince conscription was abolished in 2013, Ukraine had the highest level of formal professionalisation among post-Soviet armed forces before the outbreak of war in 2014. How­ever, the operational readiness of contract and professional soldiers was low due to lack of training and outdated equipment. After the beginning of the war, compulsory mili­tary service was reintroduced and by the end of 2016, 90,000 soldiers had been recruited.

Only in the course of the Western debate on ‘hybrid warfare’ was this term (gibridnaja voijna) also discussed in Russia, but it was mostly rejected as a Western concept. In Western dis­course, the term quickly spread from 2014. In the meantime, however, its analytical content and political impact are also viewed much more critically in the West.

In 2010, the agreement was ex­tended and, therefore, the Russian military presence until 2042. Russia announced the extension after Crimea’s an­nexation. At the Istanbul OSCE Summit in 1999, Russia agreed to withdraw its troops from Transnistria and to reduce its troop presence in Georgia, as well as to come to an agreement with Tbilisi on the modalities of the Russian military presence in the country. After the Georgia war in 2008, Moscow recognised Abkhazia and South Ossetia as independent states and negotiated with them, bypassing Georgia’s contracts on troop deployments.\n\n59\n\nSee Ridvan Bari Urcosta and Lev Abalkin, “Crimea: Russia’s Stronghold in the Black Sea”, European Council on Foreign Relations, 1 September 2016, http://www.ecfr.eu/ article/essay_crimea_ russias_stronghold_in_the_black_sea.\n\n60\n\nWith A2/AD capabilities, states seek to deny other actors access to, or scope for, military action in a given area. To achieve this, they mainly use air defence systems and pre­cision weapons.\n\n61\n\nSee Sergey Sukhankin, “Russia Pours More Military Hardware into ‘Fortress Crimea’”, Eurasia Daily Monitor 14, no. 147 (14 November 2017), https://jamestown.org/program/ russia-pours-military-hardware-fortress-crimea/.\n\n62\n\nRussian newspapers and TV stations critical of the gov­ernment (e.g. Novaja Gazeta and Dozhd) and Ukrainian inves­tigative journalists (e.g. the research collective InformNapalm) provide evidence of the covert use of Russian soldiers in the Donbas, including tracking the origin of Russian fighters from regular military units killed or captured there. From open sources, however, it is not possible to determine a reliable total number of Russian soldiers deployed in the Donbas. According to Igor Sutiagin, a Russian military researcher working in the UK, up to 10,000 Russian soldiers were there at the height of fighting during the Battles of Ilovajsk and Debaltseve.

At the same time, this army received two new divisions, the 3rd and 144th divisions, which were stationed near the border with Ukraine (Rostov) and Belarus (Belgorod). The 8th Army was re-established in the military district “South”. The 150th division, which is assigned to it, is stationed on the southern border with Ukraine near Rostov.\n\n64\n\nMaryna Vorotnyuk, “In Serious Escalation, Russia Openly Attacks Ukrainian Vessels in Azov SeaEurasia Daily Monitor 15, no. 165 (26 November 2018), https://jamestown. org/program/in-serious-escalation-russia-openly-attacks-ukrainian-vessels-in-azov-sea/.\n\n65\n\nRussia has been modernising and strengthening its armed forces in Kaliningrad since 2008. After the outbreak of the Ukraine crisis, the focus was mainly on expanding the A2/AD systems. In contrast, the offensive capabilities of the army units stationed there are poor. Here, the new division set up near Belgorod plays a greater role.

In contrast, the Collective Rapid De­ployment Force in Central Asia is a multilateral structure made up of two Tajik, two Kazakh, one Kyrgyz and five Russian brigades.\n\n106\n\nIn April 2013, the CSTO announced its intention to create Collective Air Forces. The scope and location of the new structures are still unknown. “Sily i sredstva sistemy kollektivnoj bezopasnosti ODKB” [The forces and means of the collective security system of the CSTO], ODKB [CSTO] (official website), http://www.odkb-csto.org/js_csto/voennaya-sostavlyauschaya-odkb/forces.php.\n\n107\n\nWhile Uzbekistan had fundamental doubts about joint response forces, Belarusian restraint was more based on tac­tical considerations. In the conflict over the price of Russian energy supplies, which was occurring at the same time, President Lukashenko made use of the consent requirement in the CSTO to exert pressure on the Russian leadership. Nevertheless, in October 2009, Belarus agreed while Uzbekistan initially reserved the right to participate in the new structures on an ad hoc basis only. “Uzbekskoe ‘net’ dja KSOR” [Uzbekistan’s “No” to KSOR], Inosmi, 18 June 2009, https://inosmi.ru/world/20090618/249950.html.\n\n108\n\nThe CSTO Joint Peacekeeping Force consists of one Russian brigade, one Kazakh battalion and smaller units from other allies. Russia makes its 98th Airborne Division and 31st Airborne Brigade available for the Collective Rapid Response Forces. Kazakhstan participates with an airborne brigade and a marine battalion, Belarus with a brigade and Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan with a battalion each.\n\n109\n\nSee Johan Norberg, High Ambitions, Harsh Realities.

According to information from CSTO, it had previously only planned to create command structures for the different deployment scenarios, but now they are working on a per­manent command structure.

Between 2003 and 2016, 14 CSTO exercises took place in Russia, eight each in Kazakhstan and Tajikistan and six in Kyrgyzstan.

It is now possible to adopt resolutions in ‘limited format’. If one member votes neither against nor explicitly for a resolu­tion, it is deemed to have been adopted, but then it is not binding on the state that abstains. This change was implemented after several attempts by Uzbekistan to block Rus­sian integration projects by refusing to give their consent. Charter of the Collective Security Treaty Organization (see note 98).\n\n116\n\nThe new General Secretary of CSTO, Armenian Yuri Chachaturov, who was appointed in April 2017, can look back on a long career in the Soviet and Armenian armed forces. On 2 November 2018, the new Armenian leadership recalled Chachaturov from his post because he took part in a violent suppression of opposition demonstrations in 2008. While Armenia’s leaderships claims the right to appoint a new Armenian candidate for the post of secretary general, Belarus and Kazakhstan voiced their support to fill the post with a Belarussian candidate.

As a result, despite criti­cism from Russia, Kazakhstan concluded an agreement with the US in 2018 which allows it to transport non-military goods through the Kazakh ports of Aktau and Kuryk.
