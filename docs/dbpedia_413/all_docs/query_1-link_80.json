While it is well known that state enterprises hoarded an excessive and often ineffective labour force during the Soviet era, resisting massive layoffs during the post-communist crisis probably indirectly affected public health. Being employed, at least part-time, or even nominally, provided people with minimal security and gave them the feeling of being in control of their lives. Unemployment and related stress led to a hitherto unseen drop in life expectancy.\n\n11\n\nMarmot M\n\nResearch in context\n\nEvidence before this study\n\nWe undertook an extensive analysis of the scientific literature on the effect of economic reforms on public health, morbidity, and mortality in post-communist Russia, and relevant electronic databases. We searched PubMed and Embase for reports published between 1990 and 2013, published in any language, with the following search terms: “mortality in Russia”, “working age mortality”, “male mortality”, “mortality and transition”, “privatization”, “alcohol”. We also searched our own extensive library of literature on mortality in the former communist countries of Europe. These data were highly heterogeneous and had limited utility as they were not suitable for linking the speed of privatisation in various settlements to individuals' mortality. Meta-analysis of the effects of privatisation on the health of employees and populations does not permit drawing a pooled estimate, as most of the estimates apply to countries outside our focus. Evidence from post-communist countries on health outcomes of politico-economic transitions remains inconclusive, although available data suggest that adverse health outcomes could result from rising unemployment and stress levels associated with mass privatisation.\n\nAdded value of this study\n\nEmploying an innovative design, we were able to quantify and compare inequalities in all-cause mortality, caused by policy intervention, during the 1990s in the urban population of Russian mono-industrial towns. We clarify the uncertainty associated with the link between the pace of privatisation in the former Soviet Union and the increasing mortality. This study is unique in using individual-level data collected specifically to study the health effects of privatisation and thus fills gaps in the scientific literature. Methodological contribution includes the use of the propensity score matching method to isolate the effect of privatisation by closely matching the settlements for a prospective survey prior to collecting the data via survey. Indirect demographic techniques were used to show how mortality levels in Russia changed over time. We used the method of establishing a convenience cohort study, based on the Brass indirect method that surveys random population samples to collect data on deaths of respondents' relatives, so as to estimate key population mortality parameters. Most studies focusing on this period examined macro data, while high-quality data on the level of individuals remain scarce. Even though the design of the study was dictated by the need to test the privatisation thesis, a large new empirical base provides rich data for individual-level health risk analysis.\n\nImplications of all the available evidence\n\nOur findings contribute to an emerging specialty at the intersection of comparative political economy and public health, and provide an evidence base for the public and scholarly debate on the effect of privatisation on public health. Our multi-level work contributes to the methodological literature, offering a concrete example of how to study the effects of structural socioeconomic changes and individual-level factors on population health. This new research tradition extends the social determinants of morbidity and mortality research programme by linking it to specific political and economic policies and processes. Findings are also relevant for policy makers considering similar interventions in post-communist societies and beyond.\n\nAnother possible explanation for the effects of privatisation on health could be the fact that before reforms, large state enterprises offered a wide range of social benefits to employees and their families. This was especially the case for city-forming enterprises that bore substantial responsibilities for the day-to-day wellbeing of their employees by providing company housing, health care, catering, day care, and holiday recreation.\n\n12\n\nCollier SJ\n\n,\n\n13\n\nDjankov S\n\nMurrell P\n\nEnterprise restructuring in transition: a quantitative survey.\n\n,\n\n14\n\nBrade I\n\nAxenov K\n\nBondarchuk E\n\nWhen these enterprises were privatised, such provisions ceased. Usually, in transition economies these responsibilities were taken over by municipal and local administrative divisions, but due to serious budget deficits, these organisations were unable to provide adequate quality and scope of social services.\n\n15\n\nKing L\n\nShock privatization: the effects of rapid large scale privatization on enterprise restructuring.\n\nThe loss of health services can affect directly population health. However, the loss of social services, as well as the uncertainty created by privatisation, could increase levels of stress and associated risky behaviours like excessive drinking, which is a well documented cause of increased post-communist male mortality.\n\n16\n\nBobak M\n\nMurphy M\n\nRose R\n\nMarmot M\n\nDeterminants of adult mortality in Russia: estimates from sibling data.\n\nIt is estimated that as much as 30% of overall male mortality in Russia is accounted for by excessive drinking, and even more in working ages.\n\n4\n\nLeon DA\n\nSaburova L\n\nTomkins S\n\net al.\n\nHazardous alcohol drinking and premature mortality in Russia: a population based case-control study.\n\n,\n\n17\n\nParfitt T\n\nPutin urged to address “Russia's curse”.\n\nKing and colleagues\n\n18\n\nKing L\n\nHamm P\n\nStuckler D\n\nRapid large-scale privatization and death rates in ex-communist countries: an analysis of stress-related and health system mechanisms.\n\nrecorded a cross-national association between mass privatisation, reduced health-care resources, unemployment and stress-related outcomes like alcohol consumption, suicides, ischaemic heart disease, and homicide.\n\nFinally, extremely fast and extensive privatisation could be linked to poor health outcomes by damaging firm performance and state capacity.

In 647 households, nobody could be contacted (after five visits), a further 5473 declined to be interviewed, and 732 were unable to participate due to physical or mental impairment. Overall, 14 642 interviews were completed. After data cleaning, a sample was reduced to 13 932 valid interviews, with a 65% response rate. Information about 38 339 relatives (21 634 men and 16 705 women) was collected. After exclusion criteria were applied, 19 167 were eligible for inclusion (12 086 men and 7081 women). Table 1 presents the availability of data for individuals in towns of each type and by sex. The distribution of people by vital status, education, occupation, and other characteristics in both types of town was similar.\n\nTable 1Independent variables for fast and slow privatised towns\n\nFast-privatised townsSlow-privatised townsMenWomenMenWomenPeople5018 (62%)3031 (38%)7068 (64%)4050 (36%)Age in 199244·7 (12·3)50·2 (11·8)44·7 (12·3)49·9 (11·9)Vital status at the end of 1998Alive4484 (89%)2842 (94%)6412 (91%)3833 (95%)Deceased534 (11%)189 (6%)656 (9%)217 (5%)EducationElementary or incomplete secondary1182 (24%)906 (30%)1546 (22%)1302 (32%)Complete academic and vocational secondary1926 (38%)1032 (34%)2952 (42%)1290 (32%)Vocational higher education or incomplete higher1367 (27%)821 (27%)1912 (28%)1074 (27%)Complete academic higher education543 (11%)272 (9%)658 (9%)384 (10%)Occupation in 1990sMilitary65 (1%)4 (<1%)100 (1%)4 (<1%)Managerial232 (5%)77 (3%)352 (5%)98 (2%)High professional587 (12%)600 (20%)647 (9%)813 (20%)Low professional/routine non-manual191 (4%)485 (16%)273 (4%)675 (17%)Skilled manual3039 (61%)698 (23%)4340 (61%)765 (19%)Unskilled manual268 (5%)193 (6%)409 (6%)376 (9%)Unemployed in 1990s636 (13%)974 (32%)947 (13%)1319 (33%)Marital status at the date of interview/deathPartnered4464 (89%)2554 (84%)6416 (91%)3447 (85%)Single64 (1%)91 (3%)70 (1%)105 (3%)Separated490 (10%)386 (13%)582 (8%)498 (12%)Smoking statusNever smoked1215 (24%)2827 (93%)1837 (26%)3802 (94%)Currently/was a regular smoker2879 (57%)112 (4%)3851 (55%)142 (4%)Used to smoke but quit924 (18%)92 (3%)1380 (20%)106 (3%)Alcohol consumptionAlmost every day or several times a week731 (15%)23 (1%)874 (12%)35 (1%)About 2–4 times a month or up to once a month2876 (57%)1165 (38%)3882 (55%)1251 (31%)A couple of times a year342 (7%)427 (14%)517 (7%)561 (14%)Used to drink but quit552 (11%)67 (2%)911 (13%)80 (2%)Never517 (10%)1349 (45%)884 (13%)2213 (52%)Material deprivationOften or sometimes119 (2%)62 (2%)202 (3%)104 (3%)Rarely or never4899 (98%)2969 (98%)6866 (97%)3956 (97%)\n\nData are n (%) or mean (SD).\n\nFast privatisation was strongly associated with higher working-age male mortality rates both between 1992 and 1998 (age-standardised mortality ratio in men aged 20–69 years in fast vs slow privatised towns: 1·13, SMR 0·83 [95% CI 0·77–0·88] vs 0·73 [0·69–0·77], respectively) and from 1999 to 2006 (1·15, 0·91, 0·86–0·97 vs 0·79, 0·75–0·84). These preliminary results suggest that mortality rates were significantly higher in fast-privatised mono-industrial towns than in slow-privatised mono-industrial towns both in 1992–1998 and 1998–2006.\n\nAll towns except one in the sample initiated privatisation between 1992 and 1998, thus enabling us to test the privatisation hypothesis. Models 1 in table 2 and table 3 report age-adjusted incidence rate ratios, while models 2 and 3 include controls for sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics and health-related behaviours. As the towns were closely matched with respect to population size, dependency ratio, level of health provision, housing provision, pollution, initial mortality rate, alcohol poisoning, and level of income, these town-level variables were not included in the models. We controlled for individual-level education, occupation, material deprivation in the 1990s, marital status, and frequency of drinking and smoking.\n\nTable 2Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios of death from Poisson models in men aged 20–69 years between 1992 and 1998\n\nModel 1Model 2Model 3Speed of privatisation (ref: slow speed)1·15 (1·03–1·29)1·17 (1·05–1·31)1·13 (1·01–1·26)Education (ref: elementary)Complete academic and vocational secondary..0·99 (0·86–1·14)1·04 (0·91–1·19)Vocational higher education or incomplete higher..0·83 (0·70–0·98)0·93 (0·78–1·10)Complete academic higher education..0·70 (0·52–0·93)0·82 (0·62–1·10)Occupation (ref: unskilled manual)Military..0·92 (0·47–1·79)0·95 (0·49–1·97)Managerial..0·79 (0·43–1·19)0·92 (0·62–1·38)High professional..0·73 (0·49–1·03)0·80 (0·57–1·13)Low professional/routine non-manual..1·20 (0·73–1·75)1·29 (0·88–1·88)Skilled manual..0·86 (0·60–1·09)0·91 (0·72–1·16)Was not working in the 90s..1·32 (0·94–1·70)1·40 (1·08–1·81)Material deprivation (ref: rarely or never)Often or sometimes....1·21 (0·91–1·61)Marital status (ref: partnered)Single....0·88 (0·48–1·63)Separated....1·19 (0·99–1·44)Alcohol consumption (ref: a couple of times a year)Almost every day or several times a week....1·58 (1·21–2·05)About 2–4 times a month or up to once a month....1·20 (0·94–1·53)Used to drink but quit....0·62 (0·45–0·85)Never....1·24 (0·93–1·67)Smoking (ref: never smoked)Used to smoke but quit....0·85 (0·69–1·05)Currently/was a regular smoker....1·67 (1·44–1·95)\n\nData are incidence rate ratio (95% CI).

Data are for 7081 women and 406 events. ref=reference.\n\nThe incidence rate ratio for fast privatisation in the basic (age-adjusted) model 1 was 1·15 (95% CI 1·03–1·29) times higher than for the slow group for male relatives (table 2). In model 2 (main model), with controls for education and occupation, the incidence rate ratio was 1·17 (95% CI 1·05–1·31) times higher for men. In the fully adjusted models 3, which additionally include variables measuring material deprivation, alcohol consumption, smoking and marital status, the association with privatisation is attenuated but remains important with mortality 1·13 times higher (95% CI 1·01–1·26) in fast-privatised settlements, a similar estimate to that obtained in the comparison of SMRs. The model-predicted estimates of the mortality rates in fast privatisation and slow privatisation towns are 0·014 and 0·016, respectively. All control variables showed effects that were in the expected directions. We re-fitted the models 1–3 for both sexes on a dataset with imputed missing values using multivariable imputation via chained equations and the resulting coefficients were in line with those presented in table 4.\n\nTable 4Age-adjusted incidence rate ratios of death from Poisson models (robustness check)\n\nIncidence rate ratioNN (events)Men1992–1998, main model1·17 (1·05–1·31)12 08611901992–1998, main model, hierarchical1·17 (1·01–1·36)12 08611901992–1998, main model, for older cohorts\n\n*\n\nAged 40–69 years.\n\n1·15 (1·03–1·30)776810615 years after privatisation, main model1·21 (1·08–1·37)11 81910621992–2006, main model1·16 (1·08–1·23)12 08632881999–2006, main model1·18 (1·08–1·30)10 3151714Women1992–1998, main model1·17 (0·97–1·42)70814061992–1998, main model, hierarchical1·20 (0·92–1·56)70814061992–1998, main model, for older cohorts\n\n*\n\nAged 40–69 years.\n\n1·18 (0·97–1·43)5709394Five years after privatisation, main model1·24 (1·01–1·51)69283821992–2006, main model1·14 (1·03–1·26)708114311999–2006, main model1·13 (0·97–1·32)5794623\n\nData are incidence rate ratio (95% CI) or n. The coefficients give the hazard ratio of death in relation to an absolute change in the independent variable (privatisation speed). Relative hazard ratios are presented with 95% CIs based on robust (heteroscedasticity-corrected) standard errors. We report age-adjusted hazard ratios of death from Poisson models among cohorts aged 20–69 years, with covariates: individuals' occupation, educational level.\n\nThe findings in men changed little when we fitted our model with different, more conservative specifications. While the short-to-medium term effect of the rapid privatisation was captured in the main model, we explored long-term effect of privatisation on health and mortality in models based on the data for longer (1992–2006) and later (1999–2006) periods. In these models the effect of privatisation was significant in all specifications for men, and significant for women in a model covering the longer period (table 4). The magnitude of the privatisation effect was slightly larger than for 1992 to 1998 and significance levels were not changed. When we restricted the sample to cohorts of 40 years and older, point estimates and significance levels were unaffected (table 4).\n\nWe also fitted a Poisson model in which we took into account the actual year of privatisation. Although most towns experienced privatisation in 1993, some privatisation started in 1992. In this model we specified the start of exposure as the year of privatisation, and the end of exposure 5 years after the start of privatisation (table 4). Taking into account individuals' occupation and educational level, the incidence rate ratio of living in a town with rapid privatisation in this specification for men was 1·21 (95% CI 1·08–1·37).\n\nThe findings were also robust when we used multi-level regressions with town-level random effects. Incidence rate ratios for males from this model (1·17, 95% CI 1·01–1·36) were very similar to the findings of the default models for men (table 4). The next two models analysed the mortality during the pre-intervention period: from 1985 to 1991. In these placebo analysis models (appendix p 10) mortality differentials between towns where the city-forming enterprise underwent slow or fast privatisation disappeared. As a final placebo analysis, we compared the relatives from fast and gradual privatised towns who did not live in those towns for a large part of the 1990s. There was no difference in the mortality rate between those groups (appendix p 10).\n\nResults for women showed weaker effects, with sizes varying from 13 to 24 in most models but rarely reaching significance. Only in the model accounting for the actual year of privatisation was the female incidence rate ratio large and significant (1·24, 95% CI 1·01–1·51; table 4)."
