        "meta_description": "Ukraine - Culture, History, Politics: The population of Ukraine voted overwhelmingly for independence in the referendum of December 1, 1991. (About 84 percent of eligible voters turned out for the referendum, and about 90 percent of them endorsed independence.) In an election coinciding with the referendum, Kravchuk was chosen as president. By this time, several important developments had taken place in Ukraine, including the dissolution of the Communist Party and the development (under the newly appointed Minister of Defense Kostiantyn Morozov) of the infrastructure for separate Ukrainian armed forces. Ukraine also had withstood political pressure from Moscow to reconsider its course toward independence and enter",

        "text": "State building and diplomacy\n\nPresident Kravchuk’s immediate priority was state building. Under his stewardship, Ukraine quickly established its armed forces and the infrastructure of an independent state. Citizenship was extended to the people of Ukraine on an inclusive (rather than ethnic or linguistic) basis. Ukraine received widespread international recognition and developed its diplomatic service. A pro-Western foreign policy was instituted, and official pronouncements stressed that Ukraine was a “European” rather than a “Eurasian” country. The state symbols and national anthem of the post-World War I Ukrainian National Republic were reinstituted. Yet at the same time that independent Ukraine was acquiring the attributes of statehood, it faced a number of contentious issues that severely strained the fledgling country: the nature of its participation in the CIS, nuclear disarmament, the status of Crimea, and control of the Black Sea Fleet and its port city of Sevastopol. While inflaming passions on both sides of the border, these issues also helped to define Ukraine’s new relationship with Russia.\n\nUkrainian leaders perceived the CIS to be no more than a loose association of former Soviet republics and a means of assisting in a “civilized divorce” from the union. In contrast, Russia regarded it as a means of retaining some degree of regional integration (under Moscow’s political domination) and sought to establish it as a supranational body that would succeed the U.S.S.R. These differing views were not clear at the meeting that created the CIS, but within several weeks they had become very evident. Disagreements between Russia and Ukraine ensued as the latter repudiated proposals for a CIS army under unified command, a common CIS citizenship, and the guarding of “external” rather than national borders. Remaining vigilant that involvement with the CIS not compromise its sovereignty, Ukraine participated only as an associate member. However, after more than seven years of independence, with the CIS no longer a real threat to the country’s sovereignty, Ukraine finally agreed to join the CIS Interparliamentary Assembly in March 1999.\n\nThe issue of nuclear disarmament proved a vexing one. In the wake of the Chernobyl disaster, antinuclear popular sentiment ran high in Ukraine; even prior to independence, Ukrainian leaders had committed themselves to divesting the country of nuclear weapons. But throughout this period, Ukrainians had not been aware of the size of the nuclear arsenal on their soil—Ukraine was effectively the third largest nuclear power in the world at the time—nor had they considered the high costs and logistical problems of nuclear divestment. After approximately half of the arsenal had been transferred to Russia early in 1992, the leaders of independent Ukraine began to question the wisdom of blindly handing over the weapons to a potential adversary that was now claiming portions of Ukraine’s territory (i.e., Crimea). Ukraine then expressed reservations about the complete removal of the weapons from the country before it could obtain some guarantees for its security as well as financial compensation for the dismantling and transportation of the warheads. This apparent backtracking caused major concern in the West (particularly in the United States) and Russia. Intense diplomatic pressure followed, and Ukraine began to be portrayed as something of a rogue state in the Western media. Finally, in May 1992 Ukraine signed the Lisbon Protocol, which marked Ukraine’s accession to the START I treaty (see Strategic Arms Reduction Talks). Subsequent negotiations, brokered by the United States, resulted in a trilateral statement (between the United States, Russia, and Ukraine) in January 1994, which outlined a timetable for disarmament and dealt with the financial and security issues that Ukraine had raised.\n\nThe interconnected issues of Crimea, Sevastopol, and the Black Sea Fleet not only constituted Ukraine’s thorniest postindependence problem but also posed a significant threat to peace in the region. In 1954 the Russian S.F.S.R. had transferred the administration of Crimea to the Ukrainian S.S.R. However, it was the one region of Ukraine where ethnic Russians constituted a majority of the population. In 1991 Crimea was granted the status of an autonomous republic, and Crimeans supported the vote for Ukrainian independence (albeit by a small majority). But disenchantment with an independent Ukraine soon followed, and a movement for greater autonomy or even secession developed in the peninsula. The separatists were encouraged in their efforts by routine pronouncements by prominent Russian politicians and the Russian Duma that Crimea was Russian territory that never should have been part of Ukraine. The situation was complicated by the arrival of about 250,000 Crimean Tatars in the peninsula—returning to the historic homeland from which they had been deported at the end of World War II—starting in the late 1980s.\n\nTensions in the region increased in 1994: separatist leader Yury Meshkov was elected Crimean president in January, and a referendum calling for sovereignty was passed two months later. Meshkov proved to be an inept leader, however, and he quickly alienated his own supporters. By September he and the Crimean parliament were locked in a constitutional struggle. The parliament finally stripped Meshkov of his powers and elected a pro-Kyiv prime minister. In March 1995 Ukraine abolished the post of Crimean president and instituted direct political rule, though it granted Crimea significant economic concessions. The Crimean separatist movement collapsed.\n\nThe dispute between Russia and Ukraine over control of the Black Sea Fleet and Sevastopol, the Crimean port city where the fleet was based, was particularly acrimonious. Early in 1992 Ukraine laid claim to the entire fleet, which had been an important naval asset of the Soviet Union. Russia responded unequivocally that the fleet always had been and would remain Russia’s. A “war of decrees” over the issue continued until June 1992, when Kravchuk and Russian Pres. Boris Yeltsin agreed that the fleet would be administered jointly for a three-year period. Subsequently an agreement was reached to divide the fleet’s assets evenly, but after further negotiation Ukraine consented to allow Russia to acquire a majority share of the fleet in exchange for debt forgiveness. The question of basing rights was not resolved until a final agreement on the Black Sea Fleet was reached in 1997. It allowed Russia to lease the main port facilities of Sevastopol for 20 years. Shortly afterward, Ukraine and Russia signed the Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation, and Partnership (1997), which recognized Ukraine’s territorial sovereignty and existing borders (including Crimea) and regularized relations to some degree.\n\nThe turbulent relations between Ukraine and Russia in the post-Soviet period were likely inevitable, given that the independence of Ukraine was such a sudden, fundamental change. Russia had tremendous difficulty in perceiving—let alone accepting—Ukraine as an independent country: it viewed Ukraine as an integral part of the Russian realm and even considered Ukrainians to be virtually the same people as Russians. Consequently, Russia reacted to Ukraine’s departure more strongly than it did to the separation of the other Soviet republics. On the other hand, Ukraine was intensely aware of the fragility of its recent independence and extremely sensitive to any perceived encroachment on its sovereignty by Russia. Relations between the two countries continued to be volatile into the early 21st century. Ukraine’s dependence on Russia for fossil fuels was an issue of particular concern. For example, in 2006 Russia temporarily cut off its supply of natural gas to Ukraine after claiming that Ukraine had not paid its bills. Ukraine, however, maintained that the move was a reprisal for its pro-Western policies.\n\nUkraine’s relations with its other neighbours tended to be much more cordial. Relations with Hungary were from the outset friendly. Poland was supportive of Ukrainian independence as well, notwithstanding earlier centuries of acrimony. Ukraine also fostered a working relationship with several countries of the former Soviet Union by cofounding a loose subregional organization called GUAM (Georgia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Moldova; known as GUUAM from 1999 to 2005, when Uzbekistan was a member). Relations with Romania were complicated by that country’s claims to certain Ukrainian territories, including northern Bukovina and southern Bessarabia, as well as Zmiyinyy (Serpent) Island and its surrounding waters in the Black Sea. Belarus’s authoritarian political system and its proposed two-state union with Russia rendered close ties with Ukraine unlikely."
