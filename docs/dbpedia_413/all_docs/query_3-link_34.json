        "text": "03.07.2024\n\nVOX Ukraine\n\nViolence and socio-economic outcomes of Ukrainians in Poland and Ukraine\n\nAlmost one million Ukrainian refugees remain in Poland after more than 800 days of the full-scale Russian aggression. This article explores happiness, trust and self-declared health of Ukrainian refugees in Poland and Ukrainians who stayed in Ukraine. The authors find that refugees are less well off both in terms of their general wellbeing (happiness) and also economically compared to their Ukraine-based peers.\n\nBruegel\n\nHow to harvest the windfall profits from Russian assets in Europe\n\nAfter months of bickering over whether and how to confiscate Russian sovereign assets, G7 members agreed in June to use future profits from frozen funds held by Euroclear in Belgium to prop up a loan for Ukraine of up to €50 billion. The author claims that this approach makes sense, as a full-blown confiscation policy would be plagued with legal pitfalls. Yet, the challenge still remains of crafting a syndicated loan backed by G7 members that strikes a fair deal on burden sharing.\n\nEGMONT - Institut royal des relations internationales\n\nThe EU Ukraine liberty bond: using the whole of the €300 billion in Russian assets in the EU now\n\nThe EU has been debating how best to use the roughly €300 billion of Russian assets that are in EU jurisdictions to fund Ukraine-related expenditure. As the author notes, in the end, only the income and proceeds earned on the assets are used, including, most recently, as collateral for a $50 billion loan. Russia retains the ownership title to the assets themselves, in accordance with the basic tenets of our constitutional and legal principles.\n\nObserver Research Foundation\n\nAre western sanctions against Russia working?\n\nThe author argues that, unlike Iran or North Korea, the elements of national power, population size, resource basket, and wealth are in favour of Russia, which sustains its role as a global energy exporter. This means that the 45 countries that sanctioned Russia would have to globally isolate the latter first to make sanctions work.\n\nAtlantic Council\n\nReconstructing Ukraine at war: the journey to prosperity starts now\n\nThe report focuses on how to rebuild Ukraine's economy after years of war. It provides a snapshot of the economic, societal, and energy-security situation on the ground, capturing key challenges and opportunities for supporting Ukraine’s survival and building a more prosperous future. It also explores how the country can meaningfully contribute to Europe’s economic growth and strategic autonomy at large.\n\nNotre Europe - Institut Jacques Delors\n\nLes citoyens européens et l’Ukraine deux ans après l’invasion russe\n\nIt has now been more than two years since Ukraine was invaded by Russia in February 2022. What is the current state of opinion in the countries of the EU? This document analyzes the situation as it presents itself in spring 2024 and its evolution since the first surveys carried out on this subject.\n\nInstitut de Relations Internationales et Stratégiques\n\nWhat is the perception of defence industrial partnerships with the EDTIB by non-EU countries? The case of Ukraine: changing the paradigm\n\nAccording to the article, the transition of the Russian-Ukrainian war into a confrontation of attrition puts forward new requirements for the development of the defence industry base of Ukraine and the EU, as well as for the most effective cooperation between the Ukrainian and European defence industries. The real situation on the frontline creates new impulses and paradigms for meeting the needs of the armed forces of Ukraine, with an emphasis on high-tech weapons and military equipment that provide an \"asymmetric\" advantage over the enemy.\n\nЦентър за изследване на демокрацията (Center for the Study of Democracy)\n\nPhasing out Russian gas in Europe\n\nMore than two years after the Russian invasion in Ukraine, the decoupling from the Russian energy dependence remains elusive. Russia can still legally sell natural gas around the world. This policy brief provides a comprehensive overview of Russia’s continued presence on the European gas market and proposes a complete phaseout of Russian gas from 2025.\n\nFondation Robert-Schuman\n\nL'agriculture de l'Europe et l'agriculture d'Ukraine sont complémentaires\n\nThis note outlines the issues and solutions to be analyzed together for action and therefore to set a new and determined course for a Common Agricultural Policy. Of all economic and social activities in Ukraine, agriculture has long been the richest, most diversified and most innovative. Since Russia's aggression launched in 2014 against Ukraine with the annexation of Crimea, it has also become the most essential for the country and the one which raises the most questions in its relations with the EU.\n\nForeign Policy Research Institute\n\nTurning point or dead end? Challenging the Kremlin’s narrative of stability in wartime\n\nAccording to the publication, the Russian government expects 2024 to be a turning point in the country’s war against Ukraine. The Kremlin is using means of reflexive control, i.e. it projects an image of a country that has weathered Western sanctions, ramped up its performance, and has a united society behind its leader and his goals. This strategy was confirmed by personnel changes executed after Vladimir Putin’s inauguration for a fifth presidential term.\n\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations\n\nLate-stage Putinism: the war in Ukraine and Russia’s shifting ideology\n\nThe author argues that the Kremlin, partly as a result of the invasion of Ukraine, is building a more unified ideology that it is disseminating among the population and that it is having an increasing impact on foreign policy. He suggests possible actions by the West to counterbalance this ideology and limit its impact.\n\nRAND Europe\n\nA bridge for Ukraine into NATO\n\nThis commentary points out that the Biden administration sometimes refers to the need to build a “bridge” to NATO membership for Ukraine. It also emphasises that if NATO is serious about bringing Ukraine in as a member, then it must be clear-eyed about the risks. It must develop a concrete plan in support of a broader strategy, and most importantly, it must commit itself to success.\n\n26.06.2024\n\nThe Hague Centre for Strategic Studies/ Clingendael Institute\n\nFreedom isn’t free: a cost-benefit analysis of support for Ukraine\n\nThis policy memo analyses the impact of European and American decisions regarding support for Ukraine and outlines three possible outcomes. It is important for European countries to realize that despite the recently passed aid package of sixty billion dollars, future US military support for Ukraine cannot be taken for granted.\n\nCarnegie Europe\n\nJudy asks: are Europeans prepared to send troops to Ukraine?\n\nSeveral experts comment on the question of whether Europeans are prepared to send troops to Ukraine. Deploying troops to Ukraine, even for non-combat duties, entails risks most European countries are currently unwilling to take. The advice is that the priority right now should be ramping up aid to Kyiv.\n\nCentre for Strategic and International Studies\n\nVictory in Ukraine starts with addressing five strategic problems\n\nThe most recent U.S. national security supplemental package to Ukraine, passed in April 2024, mandates the administration under President Joe Biden to produce a strategy for continued U.S. support of Ukraine against Russian aggression. The strategy must “help Ukraine end the conflict as a democratic, independent, and sovereign country capable of deterring and defending its territory.” This white paper is intended to support the development of such a strategy by defining five key strategic problems: (1) integrating Ukraine into the European economic and transatlantic security order, (2) degrading Russia’s continued ability to bypass sanctions and access capital, (3) combating the resilience of Russian disinformation campaigns, (4) rethinking the arsenal of democracy, and (5) sustaining and strengthening Ukraine’s economy and democracy.\n\nStockholm International Peace Research Institute\n\nArms supplies to Ukraine: does the European arms export control system need revision?\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine has put arms control and arms export controls at the heart of the political discussion. Since February 2022, European Union member states have changed their approach to the support provided to Ukraine. From an initially cautious stance, they have moved towards the transfer of both light and heavy weapons and equipment through bilateral agreements or within the framework of the European Peace Facility. This paper analyses these trends and examines the performance of the current regime on arms exports, particularly in the case of jointly produced armaments and competing national approaches.\n\nInternational Crisis Group\n\nUkraine: how to hold the line\n\nThis report seeks to draw the key lessons from the setbacks that Ukraine and its partners faced in 2023, suggesting how these can be applied to hold the line now in Russia’s advance so as to make meaningful diplomacy possible. It is based on dozens of interviews with Ukrainian, Russian, European and U.S. officials, civil society figures, aid agency employees and defence experts over the past year, as well as government documents, news articles and research by the Crisis Group.\n\nRahvusvaheline Kaitseuuringute Keskus (International Centre for Defence and Security)\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine: war and society\n\nThe author writes that the consequent changes in trust in the political and military leadership have significantly complicated cooperation between those in Ukrainian society who are included in the war’s infrastructure and those who mainly focus on their own lives. He concludes that overcoming cleavages in society is essential in building the resilience necessary to resist an aggressor and that the consolidation of power as a response to the challenge of external aggression is to be expected, but it is not the optimal management solution.\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nUcrania vs. Yugoslavia\n\nThis paper takes as its starting point the historical, cultural, geographical, ethnic, and religious similarities between the former Yugoslavia and today's Ukraine. It also examines the ways in which the Yugoslav conflict was resolved and the attempts to resolve the Ukrainian conflict. It is intended that some ideas for resolving the Ukrainian conflict may emerge from such analysis.\n\nThe Polish Institute of International Affairs\n\nNATO to consider increasing, stabilising support for Ukraine\n\nAhead of the July NATO summit in Washington, the paper examines NATO’s role in coordinating support for Ukraine. New instruments such as a dedicated NATO fund and the Alliance’s “mission” for Ukraine could facilitate the provision of assistance in the coming years.\n\nCentre for Eastern Studies\n\nBudanov’s sanctions. The consequences of Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries\n\nThe article examines the scale of destruction caused by Ukrainian drone strikes on refinery facilities inside Russia. While the attacks have no impact on oil prices globally, their continuation could destabilize the Russian domestic market.\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States\n\nAfter Kubrakov, Ukraine must reestablish faith in the transparency and independence of its restoration institutions\n\nThe article examines the productivity of the Ukraine Recovery Conference (URC) on June 11–12. Discussions at a pre-URC conference suggest that a recent and sudden high-level personnel move in Kyiv risks becoming a distraction and a source of uncertainty that will dominate the URC. The Ukrainian government should save the top annual international conference dedicated to Ukraine from this misfortune by immediately appointing a permanent minister of restoration and by publicly committing to transparency both at home and with international donors.\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States\n\nMake the URC a Ukraine Resilience Conference\n\nThis article explains how Russia has adapted its strategy for the war in Ukraine. Airstrikes against power generation facilities aim to make Ukrainian cities unlivable. Russia is currently laying waste to Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, by launching attacks from an effectively US-granted safe harbor on the Russian side of the border. And disinformation in the West has become the Russian strategy that matters most to the outcome of the war.\n\nUlkopoliittinen instituutti (Finnish Institute of International Affairs)\n\nRussia’s presidential election: signaling repression and demobilizing opposition\n\nAlthough a notable proportion of the Russian population regards the election and Putin’s leadership as legitimate, their support for Russia’s military actions in Ukraine is waning. Only a slim majority backs the continuation of the conflict. According to the author, the post-election period is likely to see the persistence of Russia’s current domestic and foreign policies, with the potential for increased societal and economic tensions.\n\nEuropean Policy Centre\n\nNo more excuses: debunking arguments against seizing Russian state assets for Ukraine\n\nThis paper analyses the arguments around seizing Russian state assets for Ukraine. Indeed, the authors highlight that the immediate rebuilding of critical infrastructure is crucial to keeping Ukraine’s economy running and for its defence, as the country will not be able to rebuild if it no longer exists. Moreover, failure to seize the reserves could encourage further crimes of aggression and undermine the geopolitical order.\n\nInternational Institute for Strategic Studies\n\nOn proposed countermeasures against Russia to compensate injured states for losses caused by Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine\n\nThe report written by 11 leading international lawyers sets out the legal case for seizing Russian central-bank assets and transferring them to Ukraine under the established doctrine of state countermeasure, which permits states lawfully to carry out actions against a state that has violated fundamental rules of international law.\n\nBrookings Institution\n\nWhy do the US and its allies want to seize Russian reserves to aid Ukraine?\n\nAfter Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, Russia’s foreign exchange reserves held by the U.S. and its allies were frozen. Since then, some officials and commentators have suggested seizing those assets, which amount to nearly $300 billion, and using the proceeds to defend and rebuild Ukraine. This policy is not without risk or controversy. Seizing foreign exchange reserves has little economic or legal precedent and uncertain long-run effects. This article explains the efforts to seize Russia’s reserves and the possible consequences for the global financial system.\n\nInternational Institute for Strategic Studies\n\nOn proposed countermeasures against Russia to compensate injured states for losses caused by Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine\n\nIn February 2022, Western governments immobilized an estimated US$300 billion of Russian central-bank assets in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. The United Nations, G7, European Union and other bodies have since called for Russia to compensate Ukraine and other parties for injury caused by its invasion. This paper considers that any criticism against seizing Russian assets should be substantiated as merely stating that such measures are against international law is not sufficient. States, their legal advisers and legal scholars must take part in the legal analysis, for policymakers to receive the best advice.\n\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace\n\nRussia has the resources for a long war in Ukraine\n\nThe article looks at the state of the Russian economy in the context of the country’s ability to sustain the war in Ukraine. It presents Russian economic goals, remaining resources and state spending against the background of wartime challenges.\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States\n\nThe power of partnership: international supporters of Ukraine’s local reconstruction\n\nWith destruction occurring on a daily basis, the paper points out that repairing, rebuilding, and smaller-scale reconstruction within communities and regions is of paramount importance to the local population and the country as a whole. Given the extent of the destruction caused by the full-scale war, the national budget channels most of its funds - including, since 2024, a portion of local revenues - to military needs. Against this backdrop, war-ravaged municipalities and communities receive much-needed financial support from international partners: financial institutions, governments, foundations, regional entities, and “twin” cities.\n\nVox Ukraine\n\nUkraine’s plans for institutional reforms\n\nUkraine’s support by international organizations is usually structured as “money in exchange for reforms”. This article looks at which reforms has Ukraine promised to implement in the coming years with a view to making the Ukrainian economy more competitive and resilient, and gradually aligning Ukraine’s legislation with the EU laws.\n\nAtlantic Council\n\nReconstructing Ukraine at war: the journey to prosperity starts now\n\nThis report provides a snapshot of the economic, societal, and energy-security situation on the ground, capturing key challenges and opportunities for supporting Ukraine’s survival and building a more prosperous future. It also explores how the country can meaningfully contribute to Europe’s economic growth and strategic autonomy at large through innovation, energy security, decarbonization, and diversified supply chains. While the situation is changing daily, these key takeaways will remain pertinent to reconstruction discussions for the foreseeable future.\n\nIstituto Affari Internazionali\n\nHow targeted measures are changing the global economy: three scenarios for the future\n\nThe invasion of Ukraine by Russia has prompted Western nations and their allies to impose extensive sanctions. This is yet a further example of how economic interdependence has been utilised as a weapon to address security challenges. This frequent, and often aggressive, utilisation of sanctions can decisively affect the functioning of globalisation. The article discusses the three most likely scenarios.\n\nForum for research on Eastern Europe and Emerging Economies (FREE Network)\n\nNavigating market exits: companies’ responses to the Russian invasion of Ukraine\n\nThis policy brief shows what kind of companies decided to leave the Russian market. It also focuses on prominent Swedish businesses which announced a withdrawal from Russia, but whose products were later found available in the country by investigative journalists.\n\nDeutsches Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung (German Institute for Economic Research)\n\nSanctions against Russian gas would not endanger EU or German gas supply\n\nAs a result of the Russian attack on Ukraine, natural gas prices skyrocketed in 2022 and Germany in particular felt the impact of its strong dependency on Russia. Prices have since relaxed, the European natural gas industry has overcome the uncertainty due to the energy crisis in 2022, and the industry also survived the slump in Russian natural gas imports without supply interruptions. This report concludes that increased efforts to save energy and a timely phase-out of natural gas would reduce dependency on gas imports. Consequently, both the German and European natural gas supplies would be secure in the long term without Russian imports.\n\nRytų Europos studijų centras (Eastern Europe Studies Centre)\n\nLessons of war: Ukraine’s energy infrastructure damage, resilience and future opportunities\n\nSince 2022, the military actions in Ukraine have caused losses to the country’s energy infrastructure running into millions; its restoration requires more than USD 47 billion. This paper advises other countries to rely on Ukraine's lessons in safeguarding their infrastructure - ensuring adequate reserves of critical repair components, passive defense measures for equipment in case of war, proper training of specialists, and potentially further expanding the electricity grid to ensure its reliability in case of losing some infrastructure.\n\nFriedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (Friedrich Ebert Foundation)\n\nIndustrial policy for Ukraine's survival: reversing 30 years of deindustrialization\n\nThis paper considers that the Ukrainian state must play an active role in addressing war-induced market failures and the cumulative impact of 30 years of deindustrialization. It points to possible measures by the Western partners and by Ukraine, including the suggestion that Ukraine and the European Union should co-invest in decarbonization of metallurgy and other key industries to ensure that Ukrainian manufacturing is not marginalized by the European Green Deal.\n\nInstitut français des relations internationales\n\nGouvernance mondiale, Ukraine, Union européenne : Quo vadis ?\n\nThis paper refers to the shattering of Western illusions of happy globalisation and fragmentation of the international system. According to the author, this fragmentation makes it problematic to develop global governance, which should, above all, be concerned with security challenges. The war in Ukraine threatens to send the European Union into a dangerous tailspin, symbolised by the temptation of further enlargements.\n\nIlko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives\n\nAccession negotiations: political impact on EU assistance to Ukraine\n\nThis report speaks about Ukraine-EU relations which have entered a new phase after the strategic decision to open negotiations with Ukraine, made at the EU leaders summit in December 2023. Though having some political steps to be completed before the practical phase of accession talks, this new phase is characterized by the crucial shift in the EU’s approach towards its relations with Ukraine. Aid packages for Ukraine as well as plans for reconstruction are now supposed to be adjusted to considering Ukraine as a future EU member state.\n\nPeterson Institute for International Economics\n\nThe EU should issue common European defence bonds for Ukraine now\n\nThe author argues that the EU countries should urgently approve the common defense spending, given the uncertainty of sustaining aid from the US and the need to secure a militarily victorious Ukraine. The European defense bonds should be issued without delay and fund direct military support for Ukraine.\n\nStiftung Wissenschaft und Politik (German Institute for International and Security Affairs)\n\nDie Ukraine im russischen Angriffskrieg. Binnenentwicklungen im Zusammenhang mit dem EU-Beitrittsverfahren\n\nThe Russian war of aggression has led to a deeper relationship between the EU and Ukraine. This is clear from Ukraine receiving status as EU candidate and implementing reforms in many areas. However, the strong power concentration of the presidency poses an obstacle to the separation of power and hinders effective reform of the legal sector. The author proposes that one of the main elements of reconstruction in Ukraine will be to ensure the meaningful involvement of local actors. Municipal structures should be strengthened, for example by continuing the decentralisation process, which has been very successful to date but has not yet been completed.\n\nCentre for Eastern Studies\n\nOn the warpath: the development and modernization of the Baltic states’ armed forces\n\nThe commentary examines the impact of the Russian full-scale invasion on the defence policies of Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. It describes the increase of their military spending, the development and technical modernization of the armed forces as well as the presence of allied forces on their territories.\n\nDeutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik (German Council on Foreign Relations)\n\nGermany and Russia’s war of aggression against Ukraine: the third year\n\nRussia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 came as a real shock to German elites and society alike. Although Russia has been behaving aggressively toward its neighbours since the invasion of Georgia in 2008 and the annexation of Crimea—part of Ukraine’s internationally recognized territory—in 2014, it was only with this most recent military attack that the German leadership came to understand Russia’s behaviour as a threat to German and European security.\n\nSlovenská spoločnosť pre zahraničnú politiku (Slovak Foreign Policy Association)\n\nSlovak-Ukrainian Information Center\n\nThe aim of this analytical output is to prepare a plan for the establishment of the Slovak-Ukrainian Cross-Border Center (SKUAC), which will offer public benefit services to regional and local public territorial administration authorities, business entities, and non-governmental organizations in the Slovak-Ukrainian border area in the fields of education, research, and professional project support in the area of territorial development and cross-border cooperation.\n\nCarnegie Europe\n\nThe end of the near abroad\n\nAs the brief argues, Putin’s war on Ukraine marks the end of the near abroad—the idea that Russia enjoys a special status in much of the post-Soviet space. But while Russia’s neighbours are seeking greater independence, they are not necessarily turning West.\n\nЦентър за изследване на демокрацията (Center for the Study of Democracy) - Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air\n\nKremlin pitstop: financing Putin's war\n\nThis analysis shows how Russia has exploited a complex web of economic influence globally to circumvent sanctions and maintain its position in international markets. Turkey has become one of the key enablers of this Kremlin playbook.\n\nRAND Europe\n\nBiden's Catch-22 in Ukraine\n\nIn April 2024, Ukraine and its supporters around the world breathed a sigh of relief when U.S. President Joe Biden signed a long-awaited foreign aid bill that provides more than $60 billion in aid to Ukraine. For the Biden administration, though, accepting such risk will mean abandoning a pillar of its strategy for the past two years, choosing a single path, and accepting the potentially escalatory consequences that might follow. The author considers that it’s a tough choice, but not choosing, however, may be even riskier.\n\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace\n\nInevitable fractures: the Ukraine war and the global system\n\nThe paper explores the divisions in the global system which have been highlighted by the war in Ukraine. The fractions, visible for example in the United Nations General Assembly, are an inevitable consequence of colliding ideas and interests in international politics, and Russian invasion has strikingly confirmed them.\n\n15.05.2024\n\nRahvusvaheline Kaitseuuringute Keskus (International Centre for Defence and Security)\n\nRussia’s war in Ukraine: the evolution of grand strategy\n\nThe author observes that while Ukraine’s strategic objectives have remained the same throughout the war, the ways and means to achieve them have shifted. Surprise and ability to mass troops have become less relevant, but technology must be mobilised through society-wide efforts if Ukraine is to prevail. Meanwhile, Ukraine’s longer-term security requires the construction of a credible deterrence posture.\n\nFriends of Europe\n\nUkraine gets the help it needs, but is it too little too late?\n\nCommenting on the US package for Ukraine, the author notes that it does not mean that Kyiv will receive $61bn in new weapons deliveries. A total of $26bn will be used to restock Pentagon arsenals and to replace US weapons and ammunition previously transferred to Ukraine. A further $9bn is in the form of loans although future US administrations can waive reimbursement. Just under $14bn will be spent on immediate weapons deliveries. What is critical is that the Pentagon now moves fast to send the weapons that Ukraine most urgently needs, given the pressures that the Ukrainian army is under from Russian advances in the Donbas and from daily Russian missile and drone strikes against cities like Kharkiv and Ukraine’s power stations and energy grid.\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nEvolución legal de la figura del mercenario en el conflicto de Ucrania, ¿respeto o soslayo al DIH?\n\nAccording to the author, employing mercenaries is crucial in many conflicts, but winning the information war (cognitive domain) requires legitimacy in order to uphold the principles of international humanitarian law. To that end, the parties to the dispute modify their legal framework to fit the various circumstances.\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nMás allá de las armas: la estrategia rusa en Ucrania\n\nThis article provides a detailed analysis of the Russian strategy, examining Russian foreign policy since the collapse of the Soviet Union. It explores the various tools and tactics employed by Russia in Ukraine, including military, economic, diplomatic, and popular support, as well as the threat of nuclear coercion. Finally, it assesses the effectiveness of the Russian strategy and its implications for the future of Ukraine and the West.\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nDemographics: Ukraine's major Achilles heel\n\nBefore the war, because of its low birth rate and high emigration, Ukraine was the country with the worst ageing prospects in the world. The armed conflict, which has degenerated into a war of attrition, has further worsened its demographic future. According to the author, even if Ukraine wins the war, it could lose the peace. In the event of defeat, not only will the sacrifice have been futile, but it could mean the ultimate ruin of the nation.\n\nAtlantic Council\n\nBombs and disinformation: Russia’s campaign to depopulate Kharkiv\n\nRussia failed to take Kharkiv in the early weeks of the invasion more than two years ago. As the city braces for the possibility of a new Russian offensive in the coming summer months, local residents are equally determined to defy the Kremlin once again. In order to do so, the author explains that they must withstand unprecedented aerial bombardment, while also guarding against the demoralizing impact of relentless Russian disinformation.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\n\nWhat happened to ‘stalemate’ in Ukraine?\n\nWhile the word stalemate provided a handy summary of the war as Ukraine’s counteroffensive petered out in the second half of 2023 - with both sides unable to make more than small gains - the term has now become obsolete. This brief argues that, in 2024, the most important questions the two sides face are about a possible break in the stalemate. Russia and Ukraine could soon be looking at a transformed conflict - one in which both have real reasons for hope as well as fear.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\n\nWeapons of war: the race between Russia and Ukraine\n\nUkraine and its Western backers are still struggling, in the third year of the war, to keep up with Russia’s advantages in troop and weapon numbers. The author argues that Ukraine would have a much better chance to prevail if the US and its European allies did more to ramp up defence production to keep pace with Russia’s wartime output - and if they donated more of their defence equipment to Ukraine, including the long-range strike weapons that Ukraine needs to target Russian bases in Russia-occupied Crimea.\n\nCentre for European Reform\n\nDoes it matter if Ukraine loses?\n\nThis policy brief looks at Ukraine’s military and political situation and how to define defeat. It analyses the catastrophic consequences for the West and especially for Europe if Russia were to achieve a decisive victory. It assesses the real balance of power between Russia and the West as well as the balance of risk between action and inaction, while outlining the steps necessary to ensure that Ukraine both survives in the short term and drives Russia out of all occupied territory in the long term.\n\nWilfried Martens Centre for European Studies\n\nRussian economy: still standing, but stuck\n\nThis report analyses the nuanced effects of Western sanctions against Russia two years since the beginning of Putin’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, and, in contrast to the widespread international optimistic assessment of “Russia’s economic resilience” to sanctions, paint a very different picture: behind the facade of a handful of positive macroeconomic indicators like strong GDP growth and low unemployment, Russia’s actual economic reality is much bleaker, and the situation is getting worse.\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States\n\nA smart specialization strategy for Ukraine\n\nThe author argues that Ukraine needs to improve its international competitiveness. Although the Ukrainian government has made tremendous strides in improving the rule of law, protecting intellectual property rights, strengthening of legal frameworks, etc. there remains much work to be done.\n\nCenter for European Policy Analysis\n\nResilience, reconstruction, recovery: the path ahead for Ukraine\n\nSeen from a multi-domain perspective the brief focuses on four tasks of reconstruction and recovery: maximizing wartime resilience in the face of continued Russian aggression; investing in the economy and infrastructure of Ukraine’s future, rather than its past; preparing Ukraine for rapid and mutually beneficial integration into the EU; and hardening Ukraine’s state, economy, and infrastructure, and deterring future Russian attacks.\n\nCentre for Economic Policy Research\n\nUkraine’s reconstruction: policy options for building an effective financial architecture\n\nThis report addresses a major precondition for the country’s reconstruction and development, i.e. a healthy and widely trusted financial system. It starts from the status quo of Ukraine’s banking and capital market and suggests policy options for improving effectiveness and increasing international trust in the system.\n\nEuropean Union Institute for Security Studies\n\nMade in Ukraine: how the EU can support Ukrainian defence production\n\nThe publication notes that Ukraine urgently needs investment in local production capacities and repair and maintenance facilities. The EU and Ukraine have a shared strategic interest in supporting the reform and development of Ukraine’s rapidly expanding defence industry.\n\nVox Ukraine\n\nGender inequality in the “black mirror”: how to overcome violence in the digital dimension?\n\nThe paper addresses the digital dimension of violence, reviews the latest data globally and in the EU, and how this problem is being addressed in Europe and more specifically in Ukraine. However, it seems impossible to conduct an objective and comprehensive analysis of the problem of violence (including gender-based violence) in the digital dimension in Ukraine. So, the paper makes some on what Ukraine needs to do.\n\nPolski Instytut Spraw Międzynarodowych (Polish Institute of International Affairs)\n\nRegional cooperation in Central Europe after Russia's aggression against Ukraine\n\nThis report explores the attempts to redefine regional political cooperation in many Central European states. While signaling the prospects for common actions, the report also aims to contribute to the debate on the directions of the future development of this cooperation.\n\nIlko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation\n\nRussian ongoing military aggression against Ukraine and EU security policy in 2024\n\nThe EU’s European Peace Facility (EPF) has incentivized its member states to give military equipment to Ukraine by reimbursing them for some of the costs. However, there is now little left to give as most of the old equipment has been divested. As such, European military support to Kyiv is lagging. The problem, as the brief argues, is that there is a tension between rebuilding European militaries and supporting Ukraine. A new paradigm is urgently needed for Europe’s military support for Ukraine.\n\nCarnegie Europe\n\nThe war in Ukraine will either forge or splinter Europe\n\nAccording to the brief, political shifts in Europe and the US risk deepening divisions within the EU. Leaders should make clear that investing in Ukraine’s defence is essential for securing Europe’s shared future.\n\nThe Hague Centre for Strategic Studies\n\nFreedom isn’t free | Een kosten-baten analyse van de steun aan Oekraïne\n\nThis note contributes to the debate on Dutch support. It explains the impact of European and American support to three outcomes of the war in Ukraine: a Ukrainian victory in the long term, a protracted conflict or a Russian victory.\n\nInstitut Montaigne\n\nGuerre en Ukraine : le prix de la liberté, un enjeu franco-allemand\n\nThe paper argues that the war in Ukraine divides the French and German partners who, in their support for Kyiv, are developing distinct strategies. However, only a community and even pan-European plan, supported by Paris and Berlin, would be able to provide the financial and material means without which Europe will fail to pay the \"price of freedom\". It further asks how France and Germany can make the European Council meeting in June a crucial moment to respond to the challenges of the war.\n\nInstitut de relations internationales et stratégiques\n\nThe U.S. industrial defense strategy after Ukraine\n\nThis note delves into the measures adopted or put forward by the Pentagon to strengthen the national defense industry in the context of the war in Ukraine. It aims at providing an overview of some of the major trends and dynamics in the US defense industrial policy since February 2022.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\n\nHow much U.S. aid is going to Ukraine?\n\nSince the war began, the U.S. Congress has voted through five bills that have provided Ukraine with ongoing aid, doing so most recently in April 2024. The total budget authority under these bills — the “headline” figure often cited by news media — is $175 billion. The authors present nine charts that illustrate the extraordinary level of support the United States has provided Ukraine in its war against Russian invaders.\n\nInstitut français des relations internationales\n\nThe future of nuclear proliferation after the war in Ukraine\n\nThis paper argues that the risk of proliferation in the coming decade is real but less acute and more manageable than many analysts have suggested. To limit the risk, the great powers and the international community need to step in to manage proliferation triggers by maintaining a focus on non-proliferation in their statecraft.\n\nIlko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation\n\nDefence diplomacy: Ukraine and the Global South\n\nBased on previous experience, strategic communications – including defence diplomacy – are usually built on the principle of the “Five Ms”: messages, messengers, media, mediums and mechanisms. The messages should be tailored carefully to the audience, addressing political narratives, shared historical experiences, socio-psychological aspects, instrumental issues and cultural affairs. For that reason, the paper suggests that Ukraine should come out strong in the messaging and the other pillars of this strategy when trying to cooperate with the “Global South” and procure military support.\n\nAtlantic Council\n\nGrassroots diplomacy can help unlock international support for Ukraine\n\nThe author argues that, amid growing uncertainty over the future of international aid for Ukraine, diplomatic initiatives at the local and regional levels can play a critical role in securing continued public support around the world for Ukraine’s struggle against Russian aggression. These grassroots efforts, also known as subnational diplomacy, can go far beyond merely symbolic support, and have the potential to strengthen economic, cultural, and political ties between Ukraine and the country’s international partners.\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nThe rise of a new generation of Russian oligarchs as an unexpected consequence of the ongoing war in Ukraine\n\nThe war in Ukraine has caused an unprecedented change in Russia’s relations with the West. In reaction to Russian aggression, the US, the EU, and other Western countries have adopted rapid and massive sanctions against Russia with the aim to change its course of action and to reestablish international Law. However, not only is the Russian economy proving strongly resilient to sanctions, but because of these sanctioning measures, a new class of Russian businessmen and managers, who owe their fortune to the circumstances created by the war, has begun to emerge, as this analysis demonstrates.\n\nInstitut de relations internationales et stratégiques\n\nGuerre russo-ukrainienne : la région de la Mer Noire au cœur de la reconfiguration des flux énergétiques\n\nThis study seeks to trace the complexity and tangle of energy flows that have been reconfigured since the start of the war in Ukraine. The Black Sea region, which is located at the heart of the physical interdependencies of the European-Russian networks, is experiencing a shift in the epicentre of transit from the territories located to the north of the Black Sea towards Turkey, in the south, notably via the former Soviet republics of Central Asia and the South Caucasus. The economic war, with the packages of sanctions put in place on both sides, in which Russia and the EU are engaged has in fact generated a reconfiguration of energy flows but has not, however, succeeded in lastingly weakening the Russian economy, nor its military position in the war in Ukraine.\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nLa aceptación China de la guerra en Ucrania y el objetivo de un nuevo orden mundial\n\nIn the author’s opinion, China's behaviour in relation to the war in Ukraine may not be meeting the expectations of some political leaders and analysts. However, it seems consistent with the overall external projection of Xi Jinping's China. The commentary explains why.\n\nFundación Alternativas\n\nDesinformación y censura en conflictos internacionales. Los casos de Ucrania y Gaza\n\nThe aim of this document is threefold: firstly, to take critical stock of the legislative responses to disinformation at the European level; secondly, to review the most relevant aspects of the two conflicts – Ukraine and Gaza; thirdly, to reflect and put forward proposals for better combating disinformation, propaganda, and censorship as far as possible.\n\n19.04.2024\n\nThe Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM)\n\nUkraine strategic futures\n\nThe policy paper examines three strategic futures for Ukraine and the European security:\n\nNATO membership, which is by far the most reliable and least risky outcome for both Ukraine and the West, and alternative options – the “fortress Ukraine” and “Ukraine with assurances”.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\n\nWhat it takes to fly the F-16: challenges for Ukraine\n\nUkraine is set to receive US -made F-16 fighter aircraft within months, an upgrade that Kyiv and its Western allies hope will help level the playing field with Russia’s formidable air force. But, as this brief explains, the F-16s will only have a meaningful impact on the war in Ukraine if Kyiv and its partners can build and maintain the extensive support and logistics infrastructure necessary to keep these world-class warplanes in the air.\n\nInstitut de relations internationales et stratégiques\n\nGuerre en Ukraine: questions de crédibilité\n\nNo clearing in sight on the Ukrainian front. The article speaks of a relative status quo after the Russian failure to reach Kiev and the failure of the Ukrainian counter-offensive to reconquer the Donbass, to which are added concerns about Washington's long-term commitment, the absence of an alternative to Vladimir Putin to hope for in Moscow, and Europeans who nevertheless remain fairly united among themselves and in solidarity with Kyiv.\n\nFriends of Europe\n\nRevenge, implosion or reform - three scenarios for Russia after a defeat in Ukraine\n\nThe consolidation of power within the Kremlin, with or without Vladimir Putin, albeit undesirable, is the most likely scenario for Russia after a defeat in Ukraine. This is the conclusion of a recent report by Friends of Europe outlining three scenarios of what will happen to Russia after Ukraine’s victory.\n\nRytų Europos studijų centras (Eastern Europe Studies Centre)\n\nThe unchanging core: Russian military culture examined through the Ukrainian war\n\nThe time has arrived to delve into the depths of Russia’s reform and modernization endeavours. This unfolding narrative aims to unveil the essence of ‘Ivan’s war’ on Ukrainian soil. This inquiry poses compelling questions: can we truly decipher the unique contours of their military culture and, consequently, discern a distinct Russian way of war?\n\nInternational Institute for Strategic Studies\n\nRussia’s nuclear-capable missiles: a question of escalation control\n\nAspects of Moscow’s military strategy in Ukraine, including its deployment of dual-use missile systems, have offered some potential insights into its nuclear-weapons doctrine. According to the author, the examination of Russia’s ability to absorb military losses, its deliberate targeting of civilian infrastructure and the limitations of its conventionally armed land-attack missile arsenal – provides potential insights into Russia’s theatre nuclear doctrine, while also raising questions about Moscow’s ability to control escalation.\n\nObserver Research Foundation\n\nUkraine's task for the year 2024: to maintain support and break the course of the war\n\nThe paper argues that Ukraine must convince its allies to continue military, financial and other support regardless of a change in power in their governments. Ukraine ended the second year of the war, facing a number of challenges that make the future unclear. Ukraine’s failed counteroffensive and the uncertainty around Western support for Kyiv has given President Vladimir Putin a confidence boost.\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nLa prevalencia de la guerra defensiva, su estancamiento y su carácter limitado\n\nAs the author of this paper claims, the war in Ukraine has brought into play the development of new military technology. However, the Ukrainian battlefield looks more like a picture of World War I, with soldiers on foot sheltering in muddy trenches from intense shelling from classic artillery. The questions now are whether we are once again facing a prevalence of the defensive over the offensive; and what factors of the operational environment can shape this new form and manner of fighting.\n\nBarcelona Centre for International Affairs\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant taken as military target: legal and technical global challenges\n\nThe writer discusses how for the first time in history a nuclear power plant (NPP) has become a military objective in the front line of a war. While previous military operations at the Iraqi Osirak reactor (1981), the Iranian Bushehr NPP (1987) and the Slovenian Krško NPP (1991) were somewhat ad hoc, the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant continues to be disputed as a military target in the frontline of the war in Ukraine, a new and unprecedented situation for which the international community was unprepared.\n\nIstituto Affari Internazionali\n\nDirty warfare? The application of international law to attacks on nuclear power plants in the conduct of hostilities\n\nAlongside verbal threats of using tactical nuclear weapons, Russia’s invasion plans have included attacks on nuclear power plants (NPPs), such as the shelling of the Zaporizhzhia complex in Ukraine. These actions raise critical questions about the application of international law to military operations involving NPPs and liability for resulting nuclear damage. This paper examines the scope of international law in such scenarios and concludes with implications from the perspective of strategic studies and NATO nuclear policy.\n\nCenter for European Policy Analysis\n\nBehind the lines: Ukraine warns Russia’s neighbours to prepare for resistance\n\nThe article elaborates on the Ukrainian people’s resistance to Russia, arguing that it was planned long before tanks crossed the border. It warns other Europeans to be ready to repel Moscow’s aggression.\n\nCenter for European Policy Analysis\n\nResilience, reconstruction, recovery: the path ahead for Ukraine\n\nTo the question \"How can the world achieve sustainable Ukrainian resilience, reconstruction, and recovery in the face of conflict?\", the report analyses four key pillars of recovery and reconstruction: economics and finance, Ukrainian reform, Western political will, and the postwar security architecture. Each of these pillars is vital to the stability of the edifice as a whole, and each must be addressed in parallel.\n\nRahvusvaheline Kaitseuuringute Keskus (International Centre for Defence and Security)\n\nRussia’s War in Ukraine: mobilisation in wartime\n\nIn the first brief of the series, the author examines Ukraine’s need to mobilise, prepare and train half a million men to relieve those who have fought since the start of the full-scale war. This will not only challenge the military but will also have profound economic effects.\n\nRahvusvaheline Kaitseuuringute Keskus (International Centre for Defence and Security)\n\nPutin’s henchmen: the Russian National Guard in the invasion of Ukraine\n\nThis paper aims to highlight the role that the National Guard has played in Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine and the war’s impact on the service. Willing to be a key instrument to advance Putin’s priority objectives, most notably internal stability and the war against Ukraine, the National Guard has at least momentarily strengthened its standing within Russia. In this sense, the case of the National Guard is illustrative of the general dynamics characterising Russian security agencies, constantly engaged in a struggle for resources, influence, or even mere survival.\n\nUlkopoliittinen instituutti (Finnish Institute of International Affairs)\n\nEU support for Ukraine: the paradox of insufficient assistance\n\nAlthough the EU’s response to Russia’s full-scale invasion has been more successful than expected considering its limited capabilities and some past failures of international security assistance, the West is failing to equip Ukraine to win the war. According to the author, despite the EU’s declaration to support Ukraine “for as long as it takes”, the current extent of military support is an indication that the Union is not in practice committed to Ukraine’s victory.\n\nDeutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik (German Council on Foreign Relations)\n\nReturn and reconstruction: how the EU should invest in Ukrainian refugees\n\nWhile preparing for a longer war, Ukraine and its allies are already planning for reconstruction. Human capital will be the linchpin of this effort. The author argues that, already before the war, Ukraine was lacking people in its administration and crucial sectors, and that European countries should more strategically address the prospective return of Ukrainians who fled, by enhancing their potential to help reconstruction.\n\nForum for research on Eastern Europe and Emerging Economies (FREE Network)\n\nCan farmland market liberalization help Ukraine in its reconstruction and recovery?\n\nThe Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine has inflicted massive damages and losses on Ukraine, already amounting to more than 2.5 times Ukraine’s 2023 GDP. Despite substantial and continuing international political and financial support to help Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, it is becoming increasingly clear that it will need to mobilize its own resources and private financing as well. This policy brief argues that farmland market liberalization is one of the key reforms in this respect.\n\nThe Polish Institute of International Affairs (PISM)\n\nTwo years after Russia's invasion of Ukraine, lessons learnt can strengthen EU sanctions policy\n\nThe article analyses the impact of the EU sanctions on Russia’s economy, the fight against their circumvention as well as Russia’s disinformation activities on sanctions. It offers recommendations how to further reduce Russia’s ability to finance the war in Ukraine.\n\nEuropean Policy Center\n\nCost of aggression: EU sanctions against Russia two years on\n\nRussia’s escalation at the frontline, along with the death of Alexey Navalny, should compel the West to be more active in supporting Ukraine and further increasing pressure on the aggressor, including via sanctions policy. According to the brief, strengthening sanctions enforcement and preventing circumvention must remain the priority in 2024.\n\nCarnegie Endowment for International Peace\n\nWhy Russia has been so resilient to Western export controls\n\nThe article presents the reasons why Russia has proved exceptionally resilient to the technology export controls imposed by the West and was able to maintain its military capability despite these measures.\n\nForum for research on Eastern Europe and Emerging Economies (FREE Network)\n\nSanctions on Russia: getting the facts right\n\nThe important strategic role that sanctions play in the efforts to constrain Russia’s geopolitical ambitions and end its brutal war on Ukraine is often questioned and diminished in the public debate. This policy brief shares insights on the complexities surrounding the use of sanctions against Russia, in light of its illegal aggression towards Ukraine. The aim is to facilitate a public discussion based on facts and reduce the risk that the debate falls prey to the information war.\n\nDeutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik (German Council on Foreign Relations)\n\nThe impact and limits of sanctions on Russia's telecoms industry\n\nThis article covers the impact of telecommunications sanctions on Russia. The author argues that such sanctions are inefficient and, not only because the industry does not suffer enough from them to affect the Russian economy, but also due to side effects in the form of state propaganda gaining a stronger grip. The analysis concludes that the EU should focus less on weakening Russia’s civilian tech infrastructure and more on strengthening resistance to the Kremlin’s information hegemony on the Runet.\n\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations\n\nEnergising Eastern Europe: how the EU can enhance energy sovereignty through cooperation with Ukraine and Moldova\n\nThe brief analyses the progress that the EU and its eastern neighbours have made towards strengthening each other’s energy sovereignty so far and sets out the next steps that they should take. It finds that, to date, the EU and its member states have played an important role in strengthening the energy sovereignty of its eastern neighbours by increasing their energy independence, but that Ukraine and Moldova still underperform when it comes to cleanness and efficiency.\n\nVox Ukraine\n\nWhat may an ethical investor do with profits from fossil fuels due to the war on Ukraine?\n\nThe article argues that oil companies have clearly benefited from the rise in oil prices caused by Russian full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. Some of them recognized this and donated part of their profits to Ukrainians immediately in 2022. Investors in fossil fuel companies benefited as well, among them universities’ endowments.\n\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies\n\nShips, trains, and trucks: unlocking Ukraine’s vital trade potential\n\nDue to constant and indiscriminate Russian missile attacks, Ukraine suffered massive destruction of its transport and logistics infrastructure, with air cargo totally suspended and port activity severely interrupted. This paper analyses how Ukraine has been adapting its trade routes and related infrastructure in wartime and provides recommendations to sustain trade and economic activity now and in the future.\n\nBruegel\n\nEmerging countries have replaced most of Russia’s lost trade with advanced economies\n\nRussian trade overall seems to have suffered little from sanctions; meanwhile, medicine and food trade continues with sanctioning countries. Russia’s trading relationships have changed hugely since its full-scale invasion of Ukraine two years ago. Most advanced countries now restrict exports to and imports from Russia, while several companies headquartered in advanced countries reduced their activities in, and trade with, Russia. However, many emerging countries, most notably China, have deepened their economic ties with Russia. The report elaborates on the question of the net impact of these diverging trends.\n\nAtlantic Council\n\nPutin is on an historic mission and will not stop until he is finally defeated\n\nUltimately, it is impossible to predict exactly what Putin will do if he wins in Ukraine. As the brief notes, he may initially choose to pursue low-hanging geopolitical fruit by seizing small neighbourhood countries like Moldova or Georgia. Alternatively, he might seek to press home his advantage against a weakened West by embarking on far bolder military gambits targeting the Baltic states or the Suwałki Gap. Of the many possible post-Ukraine scenarios for Russia, the author argues that the least likely of all is the idea that an emboldened and victorious Putin would simply stop.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\n\nCampaign roundup: Joe Biden makes the case for Ukraine aid\n\nSupporters of US military aid for Ukraine have been urging President Joe Biden for weeks to make the case to the American public. The author analyses the State of the Union speech in which Biden pressed Congress to pass the much-delayed Ukrainian aid bill.\n\nBrookings Institution\n\nNATO cannot take Russia’s weakness in the Baltic theater for granted\n\nThe end of Sweden’s drawn-out accession to NATO signifies the completion of the Baltic region’s political transformation and strategic reconfiguration. Both processes were accelerated by Russia’s aggression against Ukraine, which has recently crossed the two-year mark, and in both transitions, Russia loses. The author argues that the question of the real military threat that Russia poses to its neighbours, and its potential timeline, deserves more scrutiny.\n\nRAND Europe\n\nHelp Ukraine win—or risk kicking off a U.S. losing streak\n\nMore than two years into Russia's war in Ukraine, the once solid wall of U.S. public support for aid to Ukraine has become less vocal, the brief notes. Because of this decrease in discourse supporting Ukraine, a small number of loud detractors is seeking to sway public opinion by asserting that supporting Ukraine isn't in the United States' interest.\n\n20.03.2024\n\nThe Polish Institute of International Affairs\n\nRussia's armed forces two years after the full-scale invasion of Ukraine\n\nDespite the losses suffered in Ukraine, Russia has consistently pursued plans to increase the capacity of its armed forces. The article examines the “Shoigu reform” of Russia’s military, the challenges for its defence industry as well as the ideological factors in the militarisation of the state.\n\nReal Instituto Elcano (Elcano Royal Institute)\n\nLa guerra en Ucrania tras dos años: ¿cómo ayudar a Ucrania para que no la pierda?\n\nThe author is of the view that Russia seeks to weaken Ukraine by waging a war of attrition. However, Ukraine might win, provided it keeps receiving military support from Western allies and adopts a defensive stance against Russian aggression.\n\nInstitut Montaigne\n\nGuerre en Ukraine, deux ans après\n\nAccording to this article, at the Munich Security Conference in February Europeans felt more than ever the urgency to react, while the 60 billion dollars in American aid are blocked in Congress. The brief asks: what are the driving forces behind current Putinian rhetoric? How are military positions and the state of public opinion evolving? From awareness to gradually accepting risk, how should Europe adapt its strategy?\n\nBarcelona Centre for International Affairs\n\nUkraine puts us to the test\n\nThe author claims that when the full-scale Russian offensive began on 24 February 2022, few observers believed it possible that, two years later, one of the world’s largest armies would still be bogged down in Ukraine. The country has resisted but it must have more military and political support. Ukraine needs to advance towards EU and NATO membership, albeit progressively, as is being discussed in Brussels.\n\nCentre for Eastern Studies (Ośrodek Studiów Wschodnich)\n\nOn the threshold of a third year of war: Ukraine’s mobilisation crisis\n\nThe article examines the problems faced by the Ukrainian army in terms of manpower shortage, the constraints of the mobilisation process, the high average age of its soldiers, etc. The new mobilisation law might be a necessary step to improve the situation.\n\nClingendael Institute\n\nSteun aan Oekraïne: geen tijd om te verliezen\n\nThe article argues that 2024 will be a crucial year for Ukraine and for European security. Two years after the large-scale invasion and ten years after the annexation of Crimea, the end of this war is not in sight.\n\nDeutsche Gesellschaft für Auswärtige Politik (German Council on Foreign Relations)\n\nRusslands Krieg gegen die Ukraine\n\nBased on the notion that the Russian leadership lacks a master plan for the war against Ukraine and is primarily reacting to developments on the battlefield and to Western action and inaction, this article considers that the West, and in particular the EU and NATO, needs to invest in supporting Ukraine and its own security in the long term. Only through negotiations with security guarantees can Ukraine achieve lasting peace, and only with these western investments can it be made clear to Putin’s regime that it cannot win the war.\n\nInternational Institute for Strategic Studies\n\nMaking attrition work: a viable theory of victory for Ukraine\n\nAccording to this analysis, there are no conditions for another Ukrainian ground offensive in 2024. Therefore, to maximise its chances of victory, high levels of attrition should be privileged over mobility and direct attack. Western countries should help Ukraine ramp up industrial production of capabilities which provide the greatest advantages in an attritional war.\n\nBrookings Institution\n\nDoes the West’s Ukraine policy need a reality check? A Brookings debate\n\nSix Brookings scholars debate the questions that Ukraine and its supporters now face. Is Russia winning its war against Ukraine? Should the US and its allies push Ukraine to negotiate with Russia? How can the US and its allies best ensure security and stability in Ukraine and Europe? Should NATO take further steps toward Ukrainian membership at its 75th-anniversary summit in Washington in July? What concrete steps should the US and Europe take in 2024 to prevent a Ukrainian defeat? What would the consequences of a Russian victory be for the trans-Atlantic alliance?\n\nInstituto Español de Estudios Estratégicos\n\nRusia, Ucrania y el campo de batalla “transparente”\n\nThe brief deals with the profusion of intelligence assets on the Ukrainian battlefield which brings us closer to the situation of a \"transparent\" battlefield, in the sense that practically all the elements present in the theatre of operations can be detected and located in a very short time. This \"transparent\" condition of the battlefield has doctrinal and strategic consequences, which explain many of the dynamics that can be observed today on the Ukrainian battlefield.\n\nCenter for Strategic and International Studies\n\nDeter and divide: Russia's nuclear rhetoric and escalation risks in Ukraine\n\nThis analysis focuses on three critical questions: to what end(s) has Russia used nuclear threats and what impact have they had? Have Western efforts to prevent nuclear use been effective? Would Putin consider using nuclear weapons if Russia were losing in Ukraine?\n\nUnited States Institute of Peace\n\nIn search of a formula for lasting peace in Ukraine\n\nThe article summarizes Ukraine’s and Western countries’ efforts to ensure a formula for a lasting peace. The key elements are investments in a security structure and institutions that will serve as a disincentive to further Russian aggression.\n\nReal Instituto Elcano (Elcano Royal Institute)\n\nUcrania, dos trágicos años sin luz al final del túnel\n\nThe article takes the view that Ukraine is dependent on what others decide about its future, which does not appear to be bright, considering Putin’s efforts to place Ukraine under his zone of influence and the increasing fatigue among Western countries in terms of delivering aid.\n\nDansk Institut for Internationale Studier (Danish Institute of International Studies)\n\nHumanitarian principles are under fire in Ukraine\n\nBased on insights from field research conducted in Ukraine including interviews with humanitarian staff, this brief outlines the ways in which neutrality and impartiality among humanitarian actors in Ukraine are challenged and in some cases compromised. Following this, the brief also looks at the implications for future humanitarian work in Ukraine and other conflict zones.\n\nHeinrich-Böll-Stiftung (Heinrich Böll Foundation)\n\nUkraine: wie eine Gesellschaft sich neu erfindet\n\nThe article explains how the world admires Ukraine's resilience. In addition to its military strength, Ukraine's resilience is based on its high degree of social self-organization. What is its motivation; how has this experience changed Ukraine; how deeply rooted is this movement in Ukrainian history and the culture of self-organization and the pursuit of freedom, are some of the questions the brief tries to answer.\n\nInstitut für Weltwirtschaft Kiel (Kiel Institute for the World Economy)\n\nEurope has a long way to go to replace US aid – large gap between commitments and allocations\n\nThe team of the Ukraine support tracker introduces a new measure to track foreign government aid to Ukraine – government “allocations”. The data show that total European aid has long overtaken US aid, but also that the gap between EU commitments and allocations remains very large. To fully replace US military assistance in 2024, Europe would have to double its current level and pace of arms assistance.\n\nWiener Institut für Internationale Wirtschaftsvergleiche (The Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies)/IFW Kiel/ IFO Institute/ Institut für Wirtschaftsforschung\n\nRussia’s economy on the eve of the second anniversary of the war\n\nNearly two years after the start of the war in Ukraine, the report gives an overview of the current state of the Russian economy, with a focus on the fiscal situation, external balances, and the effects of Western sanctions on Russia’s trade with the EU and selected third countries.\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations\n\nTwo years of war in Ukraine: are sanctions against Russia making a difference?\n\nThe United States and its allies have imposed broad economic penalties on Russia over its war in Ukraine. As the conflict continues, this paper debates whether the sanctions are working.\n\nFriedrich-Ebert-Stiftung (Friedrich Ebert Foundation)\n\nBuild back better for everyone\n\nThis policy brief evaluates the approach adopted by the Ukrainian government and international partners, which primarily emphasises reconstruction through economic liberalisation and which has been shaped without the meaningful inclusion of important stakeholders, first and foremost feminist civil society. It argues for an inclusive and transparent process to reconstruct Ukrainian society, with a specific focus on addressing the inequalities exacerbated by the war.\n\nVrije Universiteit Brussel - Institute for European Studies\n\nArming Ukraine: can Europe’s bilateral defence agreements make the difference?\n\nAt a time when assessments of the war’s trajectory are increasingly bleak, a number of questions arise about the promises and pitfalls of these newfound bilateral security agreements. Who is signing what, and why? What do these NATO and EU members seek to achieve, especially in terms of capability delivery and defence-industrial support? And perhaps most importantly, are they going to make a difference in Ukraine’s armament effort? This brief seeks to address these questions.\n\nInstitut Delors\n\nLa puissance européenne, serpent de mer ou phénix ?\n\nThis article asks if, faced with a large-scale and high-intensity conflict in its geographical area of ​​direct interest, the EU has exercised hard power commensurate with its economic weight; if the war in Ukraine has led to the emergence of a European power, ready for a long-term balance of power, including military power; and if the sea serpent is a phoenix in the making.\n\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations\n\nWars and elections: how European leaders can maintain public support for Ukraine\n\nThis paper takes stock of the current state of European public opinion on the war in Ukraine. It draws on the results of a poll ECFR commissioned in January 2024 in 12 European countries (Austria, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Spain, and Sweden). Given the mixed picture this analysis reveals, it then puts forward a strategy for how leaders can best make the case to continue European support for Kyiv.\n\nThe German Marshall Fund of the United States\n\nWhat’s at stake in the EU elections: Ukraine aid\n\nThe European Parliament elections in 2024 will shape the political direction of the EU over the next five years and, therefore, constitute a defining moment. The author examines the impact the elections will have on EU policy in relation to support for Ukraine.\n\nThe Polish Institute of International Affairs\n\nBilateral security agreements with Ukraine: present opportunities and challenges\n\nBilateral agreements signed recently by some NATO members (the UK, France and Germany) with Ukraine raise the pressure to maintain support for the country. The article presents short-term benefits of the agreements, arguing that they will serve as a point of reference for other countries, such as Poland.\n\nIstituto Affari Internazionali\n\nEU policy towards Ukraine: entering geopolitical competition over European order\n\nSince 2004, competition between the EU and Russia over the European political, economic and security order intensified sporadically, with a focal point in Ukraine. The EU’s main mitigation tactic in response to this competition used to be denial, but in 2022, following Russia’s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, this approach became untenable.\n\nReal Instituto Elcano (Elcano Royal Institute)\n\nUkraine as a mirror: should we pay an insurance premium?\n\nAccording to the paper, Ukraine has become a mirror that reflects a number of images: the breakdown of Europe’s security and defence architecture; Russia’s revisionist and revanchist policies; the heroism of the Ukrainian people; Ukraine’s dependency on western and, in particular, US aid; the unity of the 27 EU member states in supporting its neighbour; and the differing perceptions of citizens in Europe and across the world of the nature of the threat the conflict represents.\n\nNew America Foundation\n\nTargeting the Wagner group: how the U.S. can strengthen sanctions against Russia\n\nAn analysis of the sanctioning of Prigozhin’s corporate holdings, assets, and entities associated with the Wagner Group’s operations over the past decade offers lessons for how to sharpen the bite of diplomatic and financial tools and contain the destabilizing effects of Russia’s irregular forces. To shed light on how the US government has utilized sanctions to curtail the capabilities of Russian irregular groups and how these measures have evolved over time.\n\nAtlantic Council\n\nUndermining Ukraine: how Russia widened its global information war in 2023\n\nThe article discusses how in the lead-up to the February 2022 invasion, Russia employed disinformation in the form of narrative warfare to justify military action, mask its planning, and deny any responsibility for the war. It explores how Russia further entrenched these efforts throughout 2023, developing new messages and techniques while recommitting to ones that continue to prove effective.\n\nRytų Europos studijų centras (Eastern Europe Studies Centre)\n\nThe unchanging core: Russian military culture examined through the Ukrainian war\n\nThe brief argues that time has arrived to delve into the depths of Russia’s reform and modernization endeavours. It aims to unveil the essence of ‘Ivan’s war’ on Ukrainian soil. This inquiry poses compelling questions: can we truly decipher the unique contours of their military culture and, consequently, discern a distinct Russian way of war?\n\nForum for research on Eastern Europe and Emerging Economies (FREE Network)\n\nTrending? Social media attention on Russia’s war in Ukraine\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is one of the most important geopolitical events of the 21st century. For almost two years, international news outlets have been covering the war, often providing daily or even hourly updates. But what is the level of public interest and public engagement in countries around the world? When does the war capture an international audience’s attention and what are the events that supplant it? This brief addresses the above questions.\n\nIstituto Affari Internazionali\n\nRussia-Ukraine war’s strategic implications\n\nThis study offers a holistic analysis of the conflict and its implications for the armed forces of European countries, as well as for NATO, EU defence, aerospace and defence industry in the Euro-Atlantic area.\n\nIstituto Affari Internazionali\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine war and implications for the European defence industry\n\nTwo years after the Russian attack on Ukraine, it is clear to the author that the European defence technological and industrial basis was ill-equipped to face the consequences of a large-scale, high-intensity conflict on the old continent. The war changed three decades of procurement policies, production and technological trends that had previously shaped (not only) Europe’s approach to defence hardware.\n\nIstituto Affari Internazionali\n\nSix takeaways from two years of Russia-Ukraine war\n\nThis paper deals with six takeaways that can be gained for the armed forces of European countries, NATO and EU defence initiatives, with a view to deterring Moscow from further aggression and if necessary defending Europe from them.\n\nThis post does not necessarily represent the positions, policies, or opinions of the Council of the European Union or the European Council.\n\nThe Council Library reading room is open on Monday to Friday from 12.30 to 15.30. The Info Desk operates during office hours from Monday to Friday.\n\nIt is open to all staff of the Council of the European Union and the European Council, trainees, permanent representations of member states, staff of other EU institutions and bodies, and researchers and students upon request. Access to some library holdings may be restricted to on-site consultation.\n\nRequest a research visit"
