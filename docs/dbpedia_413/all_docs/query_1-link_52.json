        "text": "The agreement at a glance\n\nThe EU and Ukraine have provisionally applied their Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA) since 1 January 2016, as part of the broader Association Agreement (AA), whose political and cooperation provisions have been provisionally applied since November 2014. The DCFTA opens markets for goods and services on both sides, based on predictable and enforceable trade rules.\n\nFull text and annexes of the agreement\n\nWhat are the benefits for your business?\n\nThe association agreement\n\nmakes it easier and more affordable for EU businesses to import from and export to Ukraine\n\nintroduces a variety of benefits for your business, such as the elimination of tariffs as well as efficient and speedy facilitation of traffic through customs at international borders\n\nThe EU is one of Ukraine’s largest trading partners, which means that there are several opportunities to import and export from the EU to Ukraine, and vice versa. The key export goods are raw materials such as iron, steel, mining products, agricultural products, machinery and chemical products. Ukraine is currently working to streamline policies to benefit small businesses when trading with the EU. Small businesses can also receive support from the EU’s SME Flagship Initiative.\n\nTariffs\n\nThe EU-Ukraine agreement improves the competitiveness of European businesses in the Ukrainian market and vice versa. Overall, for trade in goods, the agreement eliminated the majority of tariffs – EU: 98.1% and Ukraine: 99.1%.\n\nIndustrial goods\n\nWhile a large part of the tariffs on industrial goods were eliminated when the agreement came into force, transitional periods were agreed for a number of product lines.\n\nEU\n\nThe agreement removed 94.7% of the tariff lines.\n\nFor a few goods tariffs are still gradually being eliminated by the EU with the following transitional periods\n\nminerals - 2019\n\nchemicals - 2021\n\nfertilisers - 2023\n\nwood products - 2021\n\nfootwear - 2021\n\ncopper articles - 2021\n\naluminium articles - 2023\n\ncars and most motor vehicles - 2023\n\nUkraine\n\nOn the entry into force of the agreement, 49.2% of industrial products could enter Ukraine free of duties.\n\nThe share of EU exports liberalised by Ukraine is scheduled to increase to 96% by 2023. This further gradual elimination of tariffs concerns the following product lines\n\nminerals - 2023\n\norganic chemicals - 2019\n\nfertilisers - 2019\n\nrubber tyres - 2021\n\nleather articles - 2021\n\ntextiles such as headgear - 2019\n\nUkraine’s motor vehicle sector will also enjoy a transitional period lasting until 2026, a result of negotiations agreed upon at the WTO in 2008.\n\nAgricultural goods\n\nEU\n\nImport duties on most agricultural goods imported into the EU was reduced to zero in 2016. Tariff rate quotas apply for the rest of the agricultural goods that are not liberalised. The management of these quotas are done either on a first come first serve basis or via import licences. You can find a list of all the tariff rate quotas for both EU and Ukraine in Appendix 1 and 2 to Annex I-A.\n\nUkraine\n\nAlmost half of Ukraine’s agricultural goods were liberalised when the agreement entered into force, but a small number of goods are subject to a transitional period lasting until 2023.\n\nNot all of Ukraine’s import duties will be reduced to zero\n\nby 2026, 8.7% of agri-food tariffs on goods such as dairy, eggs, sugar, animal oils and fats, will be subject to limited linear reductions by 20-60% - a residual tariff will be applied thereafter\n\nfor sugars, poultry meat and pork meat, tariff rate quotas (TRQs) will be applied - goods imported within the indicated quantities are duty free\n\nThe EU-Ukraine agreement prohibits the use of export duties by both parties. However, the government of Ukraine agreed to phase out existing export duties towards certain goods by 2026, including livestock and hide raw materials, seeds of some types of oil-yielding crops and types of metal. More information on this can be found in Annex I-C of the EU-Ukraine agreement.\n\nA specific safeguard measure mechanism is provided for Ukraine’s export lasting up to 2031. This means that Ukraine is allowed to impose a surcharge on the export duty of several goods, such as raw hide materials, sunflower seeds and types of metal, steel and copper if, during a yearly period, the cumulative volume of exports from Ukraine to the EU exceeds a trigger level. More information on this can be found in Annex I-D of the EU-Ukraine agreement.\n\nFind the tariff rate applicable to your product in My Trade Assistant.\n\nRules of origin\n\nIn order to qualify for preferential treatment, your product will need to satisfy the rules of origin under the agreement. Please check the interactive “Rules of Origin Self Assessment tool (ROSA)” in My Trade Assistant to assess whether your product fulfils the rules of origin and find out how to prepare the correct documents.\n\nGeneral information about the rules of origin and the origin procedures can be found in this section.\n\nOrigin is the 'economic nationality' of traded goods. If you are new to the topic, you can find an introduction to the main concepts in the goods section.\n\nRules of origin\n\nWhere can I find the rules of origin?\n\nThe rules of origin applicable under the Association Agreement with Ukraine are those of the PEM Convention (The Regional Convention on pan-Euro-Mediterranean preferential rules of origin) (OJ L54, 26.02.2013, p. 4). Requirements for rules of origin under the PEM Convention are defined in Annex 2 of Appendix I of the PEM Convention. Those rules are under revision and a new set of alternative rules of origin should be applicable mid-2021, including provisions on cumulation, duty drawback, tolerance and the non-alteration rule (see below) that will be relaxed.\n\nThe PEM Convention on rules of origin aims at establishing common rules of origin and cumulation among 25 Contracting Parties (the EU, EFTA, Balkan countries, and FTA partners in the EU's Southern and Eastern Neighbourhood Region) and the EU to facilitate trade and integrate the supply chains within the zone.\n\nThe list of the PEM Contracting Parties\n\nDetailed information about the pan-Euro-Med system is available in the User's Handbook.\n\nDoes my product originate in the EU or Ukraine according to the PEM Convention?\n\nFor your product to qualify for the lower or zero preferential tariff under the PEM Convention it must originate in the EU or in Ukraine.\n\nA product ‘originates’ if it is either\n\nwholly obtained in the EU or in Ukraine, or\n\nmanufactured in the EU or in Ukraine using non-originating materials, provided such materials have been sufficiently worked or processed in compliance with the product specific rules (PSR) set out in Annex II of Appendix I of the PEM Convention\n\nSee also Annex I ‘Introductory notes’ to product-specific rules of origin. For certain products, there are alternative product-specific rules - see Appendix II.\n\nThe product also needs to fulfil all other applicable requirements specified in the Chapter, such as insufficient working or processing, or the direct transport rule. There are also some additional flexibilities to help you comply with product specific rules for example, tolerance or cumulation.\n\nExamples of the main types of product specific rules in EU trade agreements\n\nthe value-added rule – the value of all of the non-originating materials in a product cannot exceed a certain percentage of its ex-works price\n\nthe change of tariff classification – the production process results in a change of tariff classification between the non-originating materials and the final product – for example production of paper (Harmonized System Chapter 48) from non-originating pulp (Harmonized System Chapter 47)\n\nspecific operations – a specific production process is required, for example spinning of fibres into yarn – such rules are mostly used in the textile and clothing and the chemical sectors\n\nTips to help you comply with the product specific rules\n\nThe agreement provides additional flexibility to help you comply with the product-specific rules, such as tolerance or cumulation.\n\nTolerance\n\nthe tolerance rule allows the producer to use non-originating materials that are normally prohibited by the product-specific rule for up to 10% of the product's ex-works price\n\nthis tolerance cannot be used to exceed any maximum-value threshold of non-originating materials listed in the product-specific rules\n\nspecific tolerances apply to textiles and clothing classified in HS Chapters 50 to 63, which are included in Notes 5 and 6 of Annex I ‘Introductory notes to the list in Annex II’\n\nCumulation\n\nThe PEM Convention provides for two ways of cumulating origin\n\nbilateral cumulation - materials originating in Ukraine can be counted as originating in the EU (and vice-versa) when used in the production of the product in the EU\n\ndiagonal cumulation - materials originating in one Contracting Party of the PEM Convention can be counted as originating in another Contracting Party when assessing if the final product is originating to benefit from preferential access when exported to a third Contracting Party within the pan-Euro-Med zone — diagonal cumulation only applies if a Trade Agreement is in place between all Contracting Parties concerned and those countries apply the same rules of origin\n\nPlease check the 'matrix' (table containing all the agreements in force using the PEM Convention) that specifies the Contracting Parties with which Ukraine can apply diagonal cumulation (in April 2020, the common partners of the EU and Ukraine eligible for diagonal cumulation were Iceland, Switzerland (including Liechtenstein) and Norway)\n\nHow does diagonal cumulation work?\n\nDiagonal cumulation occurs among several different countries that share the same rules of origin and have FTAs with each other. This is when a producer of goods in either country can import materials and use them as if they originated in their own country. For example, under the PEM Convention, a Ukrainian trader who making up clothes in Ukraine for export to Switzerland, can use fabrics originating in the EU to produce the clothes and can count them as originating in Ukraine. The double transformation requirement , i.e. manufacturing of the fabrics from (non-originating) yarn and production of the clothes has been fulfilled and the clothes are considered as originating in Ukraine when exported to Switzerland and will therefore benefit from free access in the Swiss market.\n\nFurther explanations on PEM cumulation can be found here\n\nOther requirements\n\nThe product also needs to fulfil all other applicable requirements specified in the Convention, such as insufficient working or processing, or the direct transport rule.\n\nDirect transport rule\n\nOriginating products must be transported from the EU to Ukraine (and vice-versa) or through the territories of the Contracting Parties with which cumulation is applicable without being further processed in a third country.\n\nSome operations can be conducted in a third country if the products remain under customs supervision, such as\n\nunloading\n\nreloading\n\nany other operation designed to preserve products in good condition\n\nEvidence that these conditions have been fulfilled shall be supplied to the customs authorities of the importing country by the production of\n\na single transport document (e.g. a bill of lading) that covers passage from the exporting country through the third country via which the goods transited\n\na certificate issued by the customs authorities of the third country through which you are transporting your goods\n\nfailing these, any substantiating documents\n\nDuty drawback\n\nUnder the PEM Convention in trade between the EU and Ukraine, it is not possible to get a refund on duties previously paid on non-originating materials used to produce a product that is exported under a preferential tariff.\n\nOrigin procedures\n\nExporters and importers have to follow the origin procedures. The procedures are set out in Title V on Proof of Origin and Title VI on Arrangements for Administrative Cooperation. They clarify e.g. how to declare the origin of a product, how to claim preferences or how the customs authorities can verify the origin of a product.\n\nHow to claim a preferential tariff\n\nTo benefit from a preferential tariff, importers must provide proof of origin.\n\nThe proof of origin can be either\n\na movement certificate EUR.1 or EUR-MED, or\n\nan origin declaration or an origin declaration EUR-MED\n\nThe proof of origin is valid for a period of 4 months from the date of issue.\n\nMovement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED\n\nmovement certificates EUR.1 or EUR-MED are issued by the customs authorities of the exporting country\n\nAnnex III includes specimen EUR.1 and EUR-MED certificates and gives instructions for their completion\n\nthe exporter applying for the certificate should be prepared to submit documents proving the originating status of the products concerned\n\nFurther explanations on when to use the EUR.1 or the EUR-MED certificate are provided on page 72 of the handbook.\n\nOrigin declaration or EUR-MED origin declaration\n\nExporters can self-declare that their product originates in the EU or in the Contracting Party of the PEM Convention by providing an origin declaration. The origin declaration can be made by\n\nan approved exporter\n\nany exporter, if the total value of the consignment does not exceed €6,000\n\nHow to make an origin declaration\n\nThe exporter should type, stamp or print the following declaration on the invoice, delivery note or other commercial document identifying the product (Annex IV):\n\n“The exporter of the products covered by this document (customs authorisation No ... ) declares that, except where otherwise clearly indicated, these products are of ... preferential origin.”\n\nHow to make a EUR-MED origin declaration\n\nIn this case, the declaration is the following (Annex IV)\n\n“The exporter of the products covered by this document (customs authorisation No … ) declares that, except where otherwise clearly indicated, these products are of … preferential origin.\n\n- cumulation applied with … (name of the country/countries).\n\n- no cumulation applied”\n\nThe origin declaration can be made in any official language of the EU or official languages in the PEM zone as mentioned in the Annex IV (the statement related to cumulation should always be in English).\n\nYou must sign your origin declaration by hand. If you are an approved exporter, you are exempted from this requirement provided you give your customs authorities a written undertaking that you accept full responsibility for any declaration identifying you.\n\nVerification of origin\n\nThe customs authorities may verify whether a product imported is indeed originating or fulfils other origin requirements. Verification is based on\n\nadministrative cooperation between customs authorities in the importing and exporting parties\n\nchecks done by local customs - visits by the importing Party to the exporter are not allowed\n\nThe authorities of the exporting party make the final determination of origin and inform the authorities of the importing party of the results.\n\nProduct requirements\n\nTechnical rules and requirements\n\nThe EU-Ukraine agreement provides for the harmonisation of legislation, standards and conformity assessment procedures between Ukraine and the EU. Therefore, manufacturers from Ukraine have to comply with only one set of requirements for their products to be placed on both EU’s and Ukraine’s markets.\n\nUkraine approximated regulations include\n\nthe accreditation and marketing of products, which set out the modules of conformity assessment procedures\n\ngeneral product safety, setting out criteria on what is to be considered when assessing whether a product is safe, and determining when to prohibit a product because it poses a serious risk to health and safety\n\nFor a list of all 27 regulations that cover the safety requirements of a wide range of products including machinery, lifts, toys, medical devices and simple pressure vessels see Annex III of the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement.\n\nIn terms of standards, Ukraine has\n\nbeen adopting international and European standards according to best practices\n\ncommitted to repealing any conflicting national standards. This includes any conflicting GOST standards (Gosudarstvenny Standart) used in post-Soviet states\n\nHow will I know that the goods I am importing into the EU conform to EU regulations and standards?\n\nThe parties’ cooperation on market surveillance and conformity assessment procedures means that if you are exporting high-risk goods such as pressure vessels, lifts and certain machinery to the EU, you only need a conformity assessment conducted by a Notified Body (laboratories or other inspection and certification bodies accredited by the Ukrainian government).\n\nFind a list of Ukraine’s 114 appointed bodies engaged in assessment of conformity of products, all of which have been accredited by the National Accreditation Agency of Ukraine\n\nIf you want to import goods into the EU from Ukraine, you will need to go through the process of proving conformity through an EU Declaration of Conformity signed by your manufacturer. After having done so, the manufacturer can then affix the CE marking on their products where this is required.\n\nUnder the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement, an Agreement on Conformity and Assessment and Acceptance of Industrial Products (ACAA) will be concluded. This is a type of Mutual Recognition Agreement between the EU and Ukraine. Under this agreement, the EU and Ukraine will allow industrial products listed in the annexes of the ACAA and that fulfil the requirements of conformity to be placed on either market without further testing or conformity procedures.\n\nContacts for technical requirements\n\nHealth and safety requirements – SPS\n\nFood safety, animal and plant health\n\nIn order for you to export from or import smoothly into the EU from Ukraine or vice versa, there are certain rules relating to plant and animal health and safety between Ukraine and the EU that you should know. The EU-Ukraine Association Agreement harmonised many SPS rules and prohibited parties from putting into place any unjustified barriers.\n\nWhen it comes to animal or plant diseases, including pests, there are procedures for recognising the pest-free status of given regions. This is for trade purposes and for the notification of risks to public, animal or plant health. In the event that the importing country needs to take measures to control a serious health risk, the EU-Ukraine Association Agreement allows for provisional restrictive measures to be taken towards imports. These are, however, implemented in a manner that minimises the disruption to trade between the two countries. Find more information on the procedures in Annex VI of the EU-Ukraine agreement.\n\nSPS control in Ukraine\n\nThe government exercises three types of border control:\n\nSanitary and epidemiological control\n\nThis aims to protect the country from the spread of diseases as well as to implement tests that ensure goods are compliant to the sanitary standards. This type of control is obligatory and is exercised mainly over imported food products, some consumer products and also the export of sunflower oils. Goods that fall under the category of farm produce will not be subject to sanitary and epidemiological control.\n\nVeterinary and sanitary control\n\nThis control aims to prevent the spread of animal diseases. Veterinary and sanitary control is usually applied for exports, imports, and transit of animals, reproductive material, biological products, pathological material, veterinary preparations, animal care products, feed additives, premixes, and animal products (including meat products, eggs, milk, fish and honey).\n\nPhytosanitary control\n\nThis type of control not only prevents the spread of pests, it is also designed to supervise quarantine regimes. Phytosanitary control is applied for exports, imports and the transit of plants and plant products (including food products), packaging, means of transportation, soil and other products that spread regulated pests.\n\nContacts for Sanitary/Phytosanitary Requirements (SPS)\n\nTechnical Barriers to Trade\n\nAlthough technical rules are important, they can at times act as barriers to international trade and can thus be a considerable burden for you as an exporter\n\nif you think you are facing a trade barrier that slows your business down or prevents you from exporting, you can tell us\n\nreport what is stopping your exports to Ukraine using the online form - the EU will analyse your situation and take appropriate action\n\nContact us\n\nCustoms clearance documents and procedures\n\nThe agreement ensures more transparent and simplified customs procedures to facilitate trade and reduce costs for businesses.\n\nDocuments\n\nThe step-by-step guides describe the different types of documents you should prepare for customs clearance of your products.\n\nDepending on your product, the customs authorities may require all or some of the elements below\n\ncommercial invoice (find the specific requirements regarding its form and content in My Trade Assistant).\n\npacking list\n\nimport licences for certain goods\n\ncertificates showing your product complies with mandatory product regulations, such as health and safety requirements, labelling and packaging.\n\nproof of origin - origin declaration\n\nFor more certainty, you may wish to apply for Binding Tariff Information and/or Binding Origin Information in advance.\n\nFor detailed information about which documents you need to present for customs clearance for your product, go to My Trade Assistant.\n\nProcedures for proving and verification of origin\n\nFor descriptions of how to prove the origin of your products to claim preferential tariffs and of rules relating to verification of origin by customs authorities, please refer to the section on rules of origin above.\n\nFor information on customs procedures for import and export in general, visit the website of DG Taxation and Customs Union.\n\nIntellectual property and geographical indicators\n\nThe agreement protects your intellectual property rights when importing and/or exporting your goods to Ukraine.\n\nTrademarks and copyright\n\nThe EU-Ukraine agreement complies with several international agreements that regulate the administration of trademarks and copyright, providing a fair and transparent system for the registration of trademarks. If an application is refused by a trademark administration, the decision must be communicated to the applicant in writing and reasons for the refusal must be provided. A trademark may be revoked if it has not been put to genuine use within 5 years in the territory in which it was registered.\n\nDesigns and patents\n\nUnder the EU-Ukraine agreement, your independently created designs that have individual character are protected through their registration for a period of up to 25 years. This will provide you with the exclusive right to use the design and prevent third parties from using, recreating, selling or importing and/or exporting it without your consent.\n\nGeographical indications\n\nA specific committee on geographic indicators that is set up under the EU-Ukraine agreement will monitor the implementation of the agreement in relation to intellectual property, and report to the Trade Committee.\n\nTrademarks\n\nTrademark applications should be filed with the Ukrainian Institute of Intellectual Property (the Ukrainian PTO), which is a state enterprise.\n\nYou will need the following documents and information if you want to file a trademark in Ukraine\n\nyour full name\n\ncountry of incorporation\n\naddress and WIPO country code\n\nan image and description of the mark you are claiming\n\na description if the mark contains a word element\n\nan indication of the colour of the trademark\n\nthe list of goods and/or services being applied for under the relevant Nice International Classification\n\nthe date, country and number of the priority application or date of exhibition (if claiming priority under the Paris Convention)\n\na certified copy of the priority application or document confirming the display of exhibits incorporating the trademark applied for at an officially recognised international exhibition\n\na power of attorney signed by an authorised person on behalf of the applicant\n\nThe registration process is as follows\n\nif your application documents comply with the requirements, you will be notified of the filing date\n\nthe documents you submitted are checked to ensure they comply with the formal requirements of the Ukrainian Trademark Act - if your application is in compliance, there is then an examination on its merits\n\nsubstantive examination - your trademark application is checked for eligibility for protection, as specified by Ukrainian law and searches for identity and similarity are carried out\n\nGeographical indication\n\nFirstly, in order to register for a geographical indication in Ukraine, you must submit your application in Ukrainian language. You can file the documents in a foreign language and submit a translation into Ukrainian no later than 3 months from the filing date of the application. Once your application and supporting documents have been received they will be assessed by the Ukrainian Institute of Intellectual Property.\n\nYour application must contain the following documentation\n\na request to register the appellation of origin of goods, the geographical indication of origin of goods, or the right to use the registered qualified indication of origin of goods with information about the applicant and their address\n\nthe appellation of origin of the goods you are claiming or the geographical indication of origin of the goods you are claiming\n\nthe name of the goods for which you are making the request for registration of the specified indication of origin or the right to use the registered qualified indication of origin\n\nthe name and boundaries of the geographical place where the goods are manufactured and to which the particular properties, qualities or reputation relate\n\na description of the particular properties, qualities, reputation or other characteristics of the goods\n\ndata on the use of the claimed qualified indication of origin of goods on the label and in marking goods\n\ndata on how the particular properties, qualities of reputation of goods are connected to the natural conditions or human factor of the geographical place specified\n\nPlease note that as a foreign applicant in Ukraine, you will also be expected to file further supporting documents along with your application. These documents should confirm\n\nthe legal protection in the relevant EU member state of the qualified indication of origin of goods that you are claiming\n\nyour right to use the qualified indication of origin of goods\n\nTrade in services\n\nBoth the government of Ukraine and the EU have set out all their existing limitations or reservations to the supply of services with a high level of transparency. Reservations adopted by Ukraine can be found in Annex XVI-D to F.\n\nHow do you navigate through the Annexes?\n\nThe EU-Ukraine agreement contains 3 Annexes that you should be aware of when exporting. These contain reservations that Ukraine put forward for EU exporters\n\nAnnex XVI-D provides a negative list of all of the service sectors that are subject to specific limitations when establishing a business in Ukraine. This means that you can take advantage of opportunities in all the sectors that are not listed. The limitations are divided into a list of those that apply to all sectors or sub-sectors, and a list where specific reservations are outlined per sector or sub-sector.\n\nAnnex XVI-E provides a positive list of the service sectors where you can conduct cross-border trade in services. This list names all the sectors in which you are allowed to trade.\n\nAnnex XVI-F lists the reservations on contractual services suppliers and independent professionals\n\nWho can establish a business in Ukraine?\n\nIf you are\n\nan enterprise, the EU-Ukraine agreement allows you to establish or acquire branches of your business, or representative offices in either country\n\nan individual, the EU-Ukraine agreement provides you with opportunities to create and establish your business through self-employment or undertakings that are within your control\n\nYou will receive the same treatment as that given to nationals of Ukraine and vice versa. Annex XVI-D provides a list of sectors where limitations are placed on establishment.\n\nCross-border supply of services\n\nIf you are interested in the cross-border supply of services, you are allowed supply to Ukraine (and vice versa) with the same conditions as those given to nationals of Ukraine. The following exceptions apply\n\nsectors such as notary services, ownership of forests or directing educational institutions, where the government of Ukraine requires that the service provider have Ukrainian nationality, or the postal services, where the service provider must obtain a licence\n\nsectors completely excluded from the agreement, e.g audio-visual services, national maritime cabotage, and domestic and international air transport services - Article 92 of the EU-Ukraine agreement provides a list of these specific services\n\nIn the sectors where you are allowed market access into Ukraine (and vice versa), the EU-Ukraine agreement removes the following limitations\n\na cap on the number of service providers\n\nthis can either be done through the requirement of an economic needs test, the application of a quota system, or through laws that promote monopolies or exclusive service providers, thus limiting other service providers to enter the market\n\nthe total value of service transactions or assets\n\nthe total number of service operations or total quantity of service outputs\n\nAnnex XVI-E provides a positive list of the service sectors where you can conduct cross-border trade in services. This list names all the sectors in which you are allowed to trade. As a result, any services sector that does not appear in the list has limitations. Find more information on the list of service sectors in which you have market access in Annex XIV-E of the EU-Ukraine agreement.\n\nTemporary stays\n\nUnder the EU-Ukraine agreement, you’re allowed to temporarily move to Ukraine to work as a graduate trainee, a business seller or as one of the key personnel of a company in that country. For example, if you are a senior staff member responsible for the setting up or the running of an establishment.\n\nThe temporary stay periods are as follows\n\nintra-corporate transferee (key personnel of a company in Ukraine (or the EU), or graduate trainees) - up to 3 years\n\nbusiness visitor (e.g. travelling to establish business in Ukraine (or the EU), or a business seller) - up to 90 days in any 12 month period\n\ngraduate trainee who is not an intra-corporate transferee - up to 1 year\n\nIf you are a contractual service provider, the EU-Ukraine agreement also creates opportunities for you in specific sectors in either country. In this regard, however, you must\n\nbe supplying the service in question on a temporary basis as an employee of an entity that has obtained a service contract not exceeding 1 year\n\npossess at least 3 years of professional work experience in the sector you are offering contractual services in\n\nhave a university degree or qualification demonstrating knowledge of an equivalent level and relevant professional qualifications\n\nFor more information on\n\npostal courier services, see Articles 109 -114 of the EU-Ukraine agreement\n\nelectronic communications, see Articles 115 -124 of the EU-Ukraine agreement\n\nfinancial services, see Articles 125 – 133 of the EU-Ukraine agreement\n\nelectronic commerce, see Articles 139 -143 of the EU-Ukraine agreement; and international maritime transport see Articles 135 – 138 of the EU-Ukraine agreement\n\nPublic procurement\n\nUnder the EU-Ukraine agreement, the EU and Ukraine commit to ensuring that you have access to the public procurement markets in each country at national, regional and local levels.
