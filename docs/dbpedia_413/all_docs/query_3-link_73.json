        "text": "Reserve Your Seat Register for Zoom Webinar Watch on YouTube\n\nPlease join the Harriman Institute’s Ukrainian Studies Program for the panel discussion Ukraine in the Third Year of War.\n\nAt the panel Emma Mateo will discuss civilian engagement in the war effort, Volodymyr Kulyk— challenges of mobilization, Elise Giuliano—evolving public opinion in Ukraine since 2022, Timothy Frye—support for aid to Ukraine in the U.S. and Alexander Cooley—how the war has been viewed in Central Asia and in the Global South. Moderated by Mark Andryczyk.\n\nAlexander Cooley is the Claire Tow Professor of Political Science and Vice Provost for Academic Centers and Libraries at Barnard College, Columbia University, and an Academy Adjunct Faculty member at Chatham House. From 2015 to 2021 he served as the 15th Director of Columbia University’s Harriman Institute for the Study of Russia, Eurasia, and Eastern Europe. Professor Cooley’s research examines how external actors—including emerging powers, international organizations, multinational companies, NGOs, and Western enablers of grand corruption—have influenced the development, governance and sovereignty of the former Soviet states, with a focus on Central Asia and the Caucasus. Cooley is the author and/or editor of eight academic books including, Dictators without Borders: Power and Money in Central Asia (Yale University Press 2017), co-authored with John Heathershaw, and more recently, Exit from Hegemony: the Unravelling of the American Global Order (Oxford University Press, 2020), co-authored with Daniel Nexon. In addition to his academic research, Professor Cooley serves on several international advisory boards engaged with the region and has testified for the United States Congress and Helsinki Commission. Cooley’s opinion pieces have appeared in New York Times, Foreign Policy and Foreign Affairs and his research has been supported by fellowships and grants from the Open Society Foundations, Carnegie Corporation, and the German Marshall Fund of the United States, among others. Cooley earned both his MA and Ph.D. from Columbia University.\n\nTimothy Frye is the Marshall D. Shulman Professor of Post-Soviet Foreign Policy at Columbia University. He is the author of Brokers and Bureaucrats: Building Markets in Russia, which won the 2001 Hewett Prize from the American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies, and Building States and Markets after Communism: The Perils of Polarized Democracy, which won a Best Book Prize from the APSA Comparative Democratization section in 2010; and Property Rights and Property Wrongs: How Power, Institutions, and Norms Shape Economic Conflict in Russia, which was published in 2017. His most recent book, Weak Strongman: The Limits of Power in Putin’s Russia, was published by Princeton University Press in April 2021.\n\nElise Giuliano is Senior Lecturer in the Political Science Department and directs the MA program at Harriman Institute. She is the Director of the Program on U.S.-Russian Relations (PURR). Her research focuses on the intersection of politics and identity and the determinants of popular opinion in Ukraine since 2014. Before the war, she conducted field research in Kharkiv and Kyiv and published “Who supported separatism in Donbas? Ethnicity and popular opinion at the start of the Ukraine Crisis” in Post-Soviet Affairs, as well as pieces in Foreign Affairs, The Washington Post, and PONARS Eurasia. Her award-winning book, Constructing Grievance: Ethnic Nationalism in Russia’s Republics (Cornell University Press, 2011), examines why some ethnic minorities supported nationalist separatism in Russia’s ethnic republics during the transition from Soviet rule to the Russian Federation. She has a Ph.D. in Political Science from the University of Chicago.\n\nVolodymyr Kulyk is a Head Research Fellow at the Institute of Political and Ethnic Studies, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, and a Visiting Professor in the Department of Political Science at Columbia University. He has also taught at Stanford and Yale Universities, Kyiv Mohyla Academy and Ukrainian Catholic University as well as having research fellowships at Harvard, Stanford, Woodrow Wilson Center, University College London, University of Alberta and other Western scholarly institutions. His research fields include the politics of language, memory and identity as well as political and media discourse in contemporary Ukraine, on which he has widely published in Ukrainian and Western journals and collected volumes. He is the author of four books, the latest of which is Movna polityka v bahatomovnykh kraïnakh: Zakordonnyi dosvid ta ioho prydatnist’ dlia Ukraïny (Language Policies in Multilingual Countries: Foreign Experience and Its Relevance to Ukraine; Kyiv, 2021).\n\nDr. Emma Mateo is currently the Petro Jacyk Postdoctoral Research Scholar in Ukrainian Studies at the Harriman Institute, Columbia University. Emma studies protest and civil society in Ukraine and broader Eastern Europe, with a particular focus on local mobilization during mass protests and significant political events. Emma’s current research focuses on the response of Ukrainian civilians to Russia’s full-scale invasion. Emma’s PhD research at the University of Oxford (2022) explored the role of networks during nationwide protests in Ukraine and Belarus. Emma also holds a master’s degree in Russian and East European Studies from the University of Oxford, and a bachelor’s degree in Modern Languages from the University of Cambridge.\n\nEvent Video"
