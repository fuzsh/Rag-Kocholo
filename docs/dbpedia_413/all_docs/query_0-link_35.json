        "text": "Introduction\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 2, the Soviet health system was successful in scaling up basic interventions, such as those against infectious diseases, but failed to tackle the growing challenge of noncommunicable diseases (McKee, 2007). This legacy is still felt in many post-Soviet countries today (Rechel et al., 2013), where an understanding of ‘new’ public health, as concerned with the main threats to population health, continues to be underdeveloped. Public health services in many countries of the region are more concerned with hygiene, sanitation and communicable disease control than with health promotion and intersectoral action for health. Indeed, many post-communist countries struggled with the very concept of ‘public health’ as the term was difficult to translate into national languages (Tragakes et al., 2008) – a challenge that is also faced by some countries in western Europe, such as Germany.\n\nThis chapter begins by considering the historical background of public health services in the post-Soviet countries. It then outlines the main organizational changes to public health services that have taken place since the countries gained independence. This is followed by a discussion of key aspects of public health, including financing of public health, health protection, disease prevention, health promotion and intersectoral action for health. A concluding section brings together the key findings of this chapter.\n\nHistorical background\n\nIn its early years, the Soviet Union paid great attention to the prevention of disease. Severe epidemics of infectious diseases such as typhus, cholera, smallpox, dysentery and malaria affected millions, with an estimated 6.5 million people contracting typhus in the period 1918–1920 alone (Glass, 1976). In response, a comprehensive network of public health centres in nearly every part of the country was set up. The mission and organization of this so-called Sanitary Epidemiological (san-epid) Service were first outlined in 1924 by N.A. Semashko, the first People’s Commissar for Public Health, whose name also became associated with the overall Soviet health system. The san-epid service was charged with health protection, with a particular emphasis on communicable disease control through mass vaccinations and malaria surveillance, the sanitary control of water supplies, hygienic waste disposal and sewage, and the pasteurization of milk. In the 1950s and 1960s, the scope of the san-epid service was expanded to include occupational and environmental health, although, as exemplified by such environmental disasters as the pollution of the Lake Baikal, in the latter role it remained largely ineffective (Glass, 1976).\n\nThe network was expanded rapidly and by 1941 about 1760 san-epid stations had been established, increasing to 4800 stations (3000 of which were in rural areas) by 1976, employing more than 37 000 specially trained physicians (Glass, 1976). The service was organized in a hierarchical, top-down manner, headed by the chief health officer of the country who was also Deputy Minister of Health. It was represented at all administrative levels with subdivisions at republican, oblast, city and rayon level. The san-epid system also had a number of central research institutes and maintained a network of laboratories. While officials at the national level were responsible for overseeing and coordinating the service, the stations at rayon level were charged with local surveillance and control of communicable diseases, food and water safety, and the enforcement of sanitary-hygienic regulations. The service was separate from curative health services and its staff had no clinical contact with patients (Glass, 1976; Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011).\n\nAlthough the san-epid service initially made huge progress fighting communicable diseases, establishing comprehensive childhood vaccination programmes and contributing to the decline of many communicable diseases, it was much less effective in the areas of noncommunicable disease, occupational health and environmental health, while health promotion and intersectoral action were largely neglected (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). In many post-Soviet countries the first years of independence saw a deterioration of public health structures and a resurgence of infectious diseases such as diphtheria, sexually transmitted infections and tuberculosis. In Georgia, for example, immunization services almost ceased entirely in the early 1990s (Chanturidze et al., 2009). Furthermore, new challenges emerged in the post-Soviet period in the form of a rapidly growing HIV/AIDS epidemic and the emergence of drug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant TB (Rechel et al., 2013), while the previously neglected non-communicable diseases were only slowly recognized as major health challenges (see Chapter 2). In this context, the first reforms of public health systems started in the post-Soviet countries in the early 1990s and many have faced substantial challenges, with limited funding, shortages of skilled staff and little exposure to modern concepts of public health. As a consequence, a systematic assessment of performance in implementing public health policies found that they lagged far behind western Europe (Mackenbach & McKee, 2013).\n\nOrganization\n\nDeparting from a similar starting point at independence, the post-Soviet countries embarked on different types of reform (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). Some (including Armenia, Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine) have largely preserved the san-epid structure inherited from the Soviet period; some (including Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan) have built additional structures; and others (in particular Georgia and the Republic of Moldova) abandoned the san-epid service and set up new public health infrastructures.\n\nArmenia, Belarus, the Russian Federation and Ukraine concentrated reform efforts on traditional san-epid functions, with a continued focus on communicable disease control and enforcement of sanitary controls. In Armenia, the san-epid service was reorganized in 2002 into the State Hygiene and Anti-Epidemic Inspectorate under the Ministry of Health. The focus, however, remained similar to that of the preceding san-epid service. Although non-communicable diseases were added to its responsibilities, the emphasis remains on the control of communicable diseases (Richardson, 2013). Belarus too has broadened the remit of san-epid services to include health promotion and education (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011; Richardson et al., 2013). In the Russian Federation, a new agency – the Federal Consumer Right Protection and Human Wellbeing Surveillance Service (Rospotrebnadzor) – was created in 2004, merging the Sanitary-Epidemiological Inspectorate with the State Inspectorate for Trade, Quality of Goods and Protection of Consumer Rights, which from 1993 was responsible for certain public health functions such as food safety (Popovich et al., 2011). Responsibility for health promotion and health education was thus removed from the centres for hygiene and epidemiology, reinforcing the focus of the san-epid system on communicable disease control. While there is no single national body in charge of coordinating the monitoring and prevention of noncommunicable diseases, a network of preventive health centres was set up in 2010 charged with promoting healthy lifestyles (see below) (Popovich et al., 2011). In Ukraine, the san-epid service underwent major reforms in 2011– 2012. Its status was upgraded from a structure within the Ministry of Health to a central executive body under the Cabinet of Ministers and its emphasis was shifted from administrative services to health promotion and education. The number of institutions and units managed by the san-epid service was almost halved and the number of staff decreased by more than 40%. The reform expanded the tasks of the service to include the prevention of tobacco use, reduced the number and frequency of planned inspections and simplified licensing procedures.\n\nAzerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan have gone further, setting up new structures to complement san-epid systems. In Azerbaijan, the san-epid service continues to focus on the surveillance of infectious diseases and the supervision of the immunization programme. However, in 2007 the Public Health and Reform Centre was established – including a Department of Health Communication and Public Relations – charged with health promotion activities (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). In Kazakhstan, in the 1990s, all local san-epid subdivisions were placed under the control of local executive bodies, leading to a lack of clarity about institutional roles and responsibilities, weak management, and lack of coordination. In 2007–2008, however, the san-epid service was restored to its previous vertical structure (Katsaga et al., 2012). Kazakhstan has also set up a new vertical structure of healthy lifestyle centres, headed by the National Centre for Healthy Lifestyles. Kyrgyzstan too has established a separate organization to deal with health promotion, the Republican Health Promotion Centre (Ibraimova et al., 2011), while in Tajikistan a Republican Centre for Healthy Lifestyles and an Institute of Preventive Medicine were created (Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010). In Uzbekistan, the san-epid service continues to be responsible for communicable disease control, food safety and environmental health. San-epid stations at local level are also responsible for health education for pregnant women and in schools, with a focus on infectious diseases, vaccination and nutrition. The Institute of Health was established in 2001 and was envisaged to be the main national player in health promotion and education (Ahmedov et al., 2007).\n\nThe Republic of Moldova began a radical reform of public health services in 2010 with the aim of transforming the inherited san-epid services into a broader public health service better equipped to deal with major population health challenges. The new State Surveillance of Public Health Service has retained the communicable disease control functions but more emphasis has been placed on noncommunicable disease control, health promotion and disease prevention (Turcanu et al., 2012). Reforms of public health services went furthest in Georgia, which completely reorganized its san-epid structures. However, the high speed of reforms, the privatization of some public health functions and the unclear lines of responsibility following decentralization of public health services led to problems in communicable disease control (Chanturidze et al., 2009; Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011).\n\nThe traditional san-epid service inherited from the Soviet period has thus shown great resilience to change. Some other aspects of the Soviet organization of public health services have also remained in place. In several countries, including the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation and Tajikistan, the head of the san-epid service continues to be the Chief Sanitary Doctor and Deputy Minister of Health (Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010; Popovich et al., 2011; Turcanu et al., 2012). Most countries (including Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Ukraine and Uzbekistan) have also retained a separate body inherited from the Soviet era to ensure the sanitary-epidemiological safety of the population, specifically in terms of food and water safety, occupational health and immunization, under the overall responsibility of the Ministry of Health. Again, Georgia is an exception, where epidemiological surveillance and environmental health were separated and the Ministry of Health no longer monitored food, water and air quality, although it retained responsibility for standard setting (Gotsadze et al., 2010).\n\nIn all countries in Europe, a number of actors are involved in public health activities and their integration can be challenging (Rechel, Brand & McKee, 2014). In the post-Soviet countries, new actors have emerged since independence, including NGOs, professional and patient associations and international agencies. NGOs, many with funding from international agencies, are of particular relevance in some areas neglected by official public health services, such as in HIV/AIDS prevention efforts involving harm reduction measures targeting injecting drug users and sex workers (Gotsadze et al., 2010; Ancker & Rechel, 2013; Pape, 2013).\n\nThe existence of separate vertical public health structures poses a particular challenge to integration and can lead to the fragmentation and duplication of services (Tkatchenko, McKee & Tsouros, 2000). In addition to the san-epid service, in many countries there are separate vertical structures for TB and HIV/AIDS. In Kazakhstan an additional network of diabetes centres has been established (Katsaga et al., 2012). In some countries, the situation is further complicated by the continued existence of parallel public health structures, such as the network of centres of hygiene and epidemiology for the railway network in the Russian Federation (Popovich et al., 2011) and Ukraine. Finally, the primary health care sector is the setting of key public health functions, such as the provision of immunizations and, increasingly, health promotion and education (see below).\n\nThe poor integration of separate vertical public health structures and primary health care has been identified as a challenge in a number of countries, including Azerbaijan (Ibrahimov et al., 2010), Belarus (Richardson et al., 2013), Kazakhstan (Katsaga et al., 2012), Tajikistan (Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010) and Ukraine. Poor integration of public health activities was also noted as a particular problem in Armenia. In that country, more than half a dozen government ministries and many state agencies have a substantial role in public health, while the Ministry of Health covers only some public health services. In addition, some public health activities are provided by international organizations and national NGOs. There is no overriding central state authority responsible for the integration, coordination and oversight of all public health authorities in Armenia (Armenian et al., 2009) or Ukraine. In Azerbaijan, tensions exist between the san-epid service and primary health care; primary care physicians are, for example, required to notify even mild cases of diarrhoea but hardly any of them do (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). In the Russian Federation, limited coordination of preventive activities within the health sector has been described, with preventive and curative services organized as two separate systems and little integration of preventive activities into primary health care (Axelsson & Bihari-Axelsson, 2005).\n\nFinancing\n\nIn almost all post-Soviet countries, the central budget is the only source of government funding for public health services. In both Georgia and Ukraine, the responsibility for funding major public health functions was shifted in the 1990s to local municipalities. However, as major inequalities between poorer and wealthier areas emerged, financing was again centralized in both countries (Gotsadze et al., 2010). In several former Soviet countries, including Armenia, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, charges for public health inspections have been introduced, with uncertain consequences (Durán & Kutzin, 2010). In Tajikistan, about 80% of the income of the san-epid system now comes from the provision of paid services (Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010). The scope for corruption in countries with weak regulatory and governance systems is clear.\n\nNot enough is known about the total level of financing for public health in the post-Soviet countries. Although this could also be said about many countries in western Europe, national health accounts data on the percentage of total health expenditure devoted to prevention and public health services give a good approximation of expenditure on public health (Rechel, Brand & McKee, 2013). Such data are only available for 7 of the 12 post-Soviet countries considered in this volume, with large gaps across years ( ). Expenditure as a share of total health expenditure was lowest in Georgia, amounting to only 1.5% in 2011. Of the remaining five post-Soviet countries, low levels of expenditure on public health were also noted in Kazakhstan, where in 2008 only 0.2% of public expenditure on health was devoted to health promotion and disease prevention (Katsaga et al., 2012).\n\nTable 6.1\n\nPrevention and public health services as a percentage of total health expenditure, 2001–2011.\n\nHealth protection\n\nHealth protection has been a traditional mandate of san-epid services and continues to be so in most post-Soviet countries. As mentioned above, public health services continue to be charged with food and water safety, hygiene-related measures and control, environmental health regulations and occupational health (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). However, as in the Soviet period, they often continue to rely on control mechanisms and sanctions, identifying and punishing breaches of sanitary legislation, as was noted, for example, in Belarus (Richardson et al., 2013), rather than pursuing preventive approaches, such as environmental health assessments (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). The reliance on charges for public health inspections as a source of income for public health services in some of the former Soviet countries (see above) tends to reinforce the prevailing control and sanctions approach, and creates scope for corruption.\n\nEnvironmental health\n\nIn the area of environmental health, the Soviet Union witnessed some spectacular failures, such as the desertification of the Aral Sea, the fallout from above-ground nuclear tests at Semipalatinsk between 1949 and 1962, and the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, which were indicative of the primacy given to industrial and military development and the neglect of the environment and (consequently) health. In the post-Soviet period, governments were primarily concerned with the establishment of market economies, economic recovery and reducing poverty levels, and environmental protection and sustainability were again low in the list of priorities (Agyeman & Ogneva-Himmelberger, 2009). While a great number of NGOs have emerged that aim to protect the environment (Profeta et al., 2010), in some cases supported by international agencies, government involvement and leadership has generally been lacking. Environmental health regulations, even where they exist, do not tend to be implemented in practice, partly due to weak judicial systems (Agyeman & Ogneva-Himmelberger, 2009). Lack of democracy in the more authoritarian countries of the region is another reason for the neglect of environmental health (Rechel & McKee, 2005).\n\nThere are many areas of concern. Industrial oil development in countries such as Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan and the Russian Federation has been generally characterized by limited involvement of local communities and a disregard for environmental sustainability and justice (Agyeman & Ogneva-Himmelberger, 2009). Air pollution decreased in the early years after the dissolution of the Soviet Union but this was largely due to a fall in industrial production rather than more stringent environmental policies. The increase in motor vehicles since then has led to increasing air pollution in major cities in recent years and further increases are expected in coming years (Åström, 2013). The use of asbestos is still widespread and the Russian Federation, the world’s biggest producer, is resisting a worldwide ban (Stayner, Welch & Lemen, 2013).\n\nAnother area of concern is access to safe drinking water, which is a particular challenge for the poorer countries in central Asia. Tajikistan, for example, is one of the richest countries worldwide in terms of water resources per head, but in 2000 could only supply 59% of its population with safe drinking water (Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010). Proper water and sanitation facilities are also lacking in many schools and health facilities in rural areas (Roberts et al., 2012b). These deficiencies in water and sanitation services increase the risks of waterborne diseases, such as typhoid, giardia, rotavirus and campylobacter, and undermine food safety (Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010).\n\nOccupational health\n\nIn the Soviet period, occupational health services were delivered through the san-epid network. In the years since independence, occupational health and safety programmes and structures were generally undermined by a lack of transparency and accountability, the absence of a genuine social dialogue and indiscriminate privatization of public services (Kim et al., 2014). The scale of occupational fatalities and injuries is so extensive that they cost Russian employers on average 10–15% of their payrolls (Fudge & Owens, 2006). However, there is substantial underreporting of non-fatal work-related injuries and accidents, especially in small and medium-sized enterprises and the informal economy. The situation is further aggravated in those countries that have retained the outdated system of compensation for work in hazardous working conditions (‘hazard pay’), which does not encourage employers to improve working conditions (Kim et al., 2014).\n\nThere have, however, also been some positive developments. With the support of the International Labour Organization (ILO), most countries in the region have prepared national profiles analysing their national occupational safety and health systems and prepared programmes for improvement (Kim et al., 2014). Kazakhstan, for example, has adopted an occupational safety and health programme, while Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan have signed tripartite general agreements that include consideration of occupational safety and health issues. In Azerbaijan, the government has pledged to modernize labour inspection and occupational safety and health (Kim et al., 2014). In contrast, in Georgia, the government terminated all occupational safety and health-related inspection services and abolished minimum safety requirements. After a number of serious workplace accidents, employers and trade unions voluntarily set up an occupational safety and health centre and agreed to start implementing ILO recommendations for occupational safety and health management systems without involvement of the government (Kim et al., 2014).\n\nDisease prevention\n\nThe prevention of infectious diseases through vaccination was one of the main strengths of the san-epid services and this strength, after disruptions in the early 1990s, has to a large degree been maintained, with very high vaccination rates persisting in most countries (Maier et al., 2009; Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). However, there continue to be great problems in addressing more complex communicable diseases, most notably HIV/AIDS and TB, with poorly integrated vertical structures, whereas in western European countries services are more often integrated into mainstream health-care provision. Furthermore, early detection and prevention of noncommunicable diseases were virtually lacking in the Soviet era and remain underdeveloped (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). This particularly applies to primary prevention of disease, such as through health policy measures against alcohol or tobacco consumption (see below).\n\nParadoxically, preventive medicine was considered a key strength of the Semashko system (Richardson et al., 2013) yet this largely relied on a medicalized approach to prevention, with an emphasis on routine medical check-ups (Tulchinsky & Varavikova, 1996). Enthusiasm for these preventive health examinations grew in the mid-1980s (Lekhan, Rudiy & Richardson, 2010). The focus was on secondary prevention, aiming to detect diseases through a large number of often ineffective screening initiatives, rather than on primary prevention of noncommunicable diseases (Richardson et al., 2008; Gotsadze et al., 2010).\n\nIn a number of countries of the region, such as Belarus (Richardson et al., 2008, 2013), this approach has been reinstated. In Belarus, nearly all main specialties have initiated elaborate screening programmes. All adults visiting primary care doctors are screened for hypertension and all women for breast cancer. Some of the screening programmes, however, are of questionable efficacy, such as the opportunistic annual electrocardiogram (ECG) screening for all patients over 40 years of age (Richardson et al., 2013). In Ukraine mass screenings were resumed in the early 2000s. Certain groups of the population (such as children, pregnant women, teenagers and students) have to undergo compulsory medical screenings, while the rest of the population is expected to undergo regular prophylactic examinations (Lekhan, Rudiy & Richardson, 2010). In the Russian Federation the sections of the population expected to undergo periodic health checks (dispansertizatsiya) at primary care level are too large (Popovich et al., 2011). In the Republic of Moldova norms for annual preventive check-ups were adopted by the Ministry of Health in 2008. According to these norms, check-ups should include an examination of lymph nodes, breasts and thyroid gland, a gynaecological and rectal examination, measurement of blood pressure, intraocular pressure and electrocardiography, as well as biological tests (Turcanu et al., 2012). In Armenia the Ministry of Health recommends that all adults undergo a preventive health examination at least once a year, including checks for high blood pressure, diabetes and lung diseases (Richardson, 2013).\n\nWhile these initiatives are evidence of the political will of decision-makers to detect and treat diseases, some of the existing extensive screening programmes are not based on sound evidence and many lack qualified staff to implement them effectively (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). There is also a serious danger of over-diagnosis, as different specialties seek to justify their involvement, status and income (Rechel et al., 2011). Furthermore, an opportunistic approach to screening, offering it to those attending primary health care or to those patients who request it, is inferior to organized screening based on a defined target population, central organization and planning, systematic monitoring of uptake by different groups within the population, evidence-based screening intervals, and quality assurance systems (McKee & Rechel, 2014). In many post-Soviet countries, progress in implementing well-organized screening, incorporating comprehensive quality assurance, has been particularly slow (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011; McKee & Rechel, 2014). Cancer screening programmes in the Republic of Moldova, the Russian Federation and Ukraine, for example, are opportunistic and lack overall coordination (Lekhan, Rudiy & Richardson, 2010; Popovich et al., 2011; Turcanu et al., 2012), while in Georgia national screening programmes for cervical and breast cancer are missing altogether. Belarus is an exception and its organized cervical cancer screening programme is reported to cover almost 90% of the female population (Richardson et al., 2013). The lack of organized screening programmes in many of the other post-Soviet countries means that they have little impact on morbidity and mortality (Kesic, Poljak & Rogovskaya, 2012). The high mortality rates for cancer in many countries of the former Soviet Union are likely to be attributable, at least in part, to the absence of organized screening programmes (Kesic, Poljak & Rogovskaya, 2012; Anttila & Martin-Moreno, 2013).\n\nHealth promotion\n\nIn the Soviet period, health promotion was largely neglected (WHO, 2009; Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011; Saltman et al., 2012). Even now, health promotion continues to be one of the most underdeveloped and underfinanced domains of public health in many post-Soviet countries (Maier et al., 2009). Public health services in many countries continue to be more concerned with hygiene, sanitation and traditional methods of communicable disease control.\n\nWhile health promotion continues to be underdeveloped, there are attempts to overcome this legacy. As mentioned above, many post-Soviet countries have either enlarged the remit of existing public health systems to include health promotion or established new health promotion structures (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). In Azerbaijan the san-epid service is now formally responsible for promoting healthy lifestyles, although its role is limited to the distribution of health posters in health facilities (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). The Public Health and Reform Centre was established in 2007 and is charged with health communication activities (Ibrahimov et al., 2010). In Kazakhstan, a wide-ranging programme to encourage healthy lifestyles has been initiated, led by the National Centre for Healthy Lifestyles, established in 1997 (Katsaga et al., 2012). The centre has been a key actor in the development of national and regional programmes for the promotion of healthy lifestyles and has regional subdivisions throughout the country. In Kyrgyzstan, a Republican Centre for Health Promotion was established in 2001 and charged with providing health promotion, health education and communication activities; there are health promotion centres in the capital Bishkek, in the north, and the southern city of Osh (Ibraimova et al., 2011). In the Russian Federation, a network of preventive health centres was set up in 2010 – linked to regional and municipal primary care facilities – with the aim of raising awareness and promoting healthy lifestyles. However, at least initially, attendance at these centres was low (Popovich et al., 2011). In Ukraine, health centres to coordinate the promotion of healthy lifestyles are envisaged but by 2010 had not yet been established (Lekhan, Rudiy & Richardson, 2010). However, the country participates in several international health promotion networks, such as those on health-promoting schools, youth-friendly clinics, and child-friendly hospitals. In Uzbekistan, health promotion, mainly consisting of the dissemination of information on public health issues, was entrusted to the Institute of Health and Medical Statistics (Ahmedov et al., 2007; Ministry of Health of the Republic of Uzbekistan, 2011).\n\nMany countries of the region have also adopted national programmes for the promotion of healthy lifestyles. In Belarus, for example, a state programme to promote healthy lifestyles and another for the prevention of hazardous alcohol consumption have been established (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011; Richardson et al., 2013). Kazakhstan has set up both national and regional programmes for the prevention of alcohol and tobacco consumption and the promotion of physical activity and healthy nutrition (Katsaga et al., 2012). In the Republic of Moldova, national programmes on tobacco and alcohol control were launched in 2012, followed by nationwide communication campaigns. There is also a national programme for the promotion of healthy lifestyles but the programme is underfinanced and its activities are unsystematic (Turcanu et al., 2012). Tajikistan adopted a national programme for healthy lifestyles in 2003 (Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010).\n\nAs mentioned above, primary health care is gaining in importance as a setting for health promotion and education. In Armenia, the majority of health promotion activities are provided by primary care services, under the coordination of the Department of Public Health (Richardson, 2013). In Kazakhstan, the National Centre for Healthy Lifestyles works with oblast and city health departments to increase the role and capacity of primary health care in health promotion (Katsaga et al., 2012). In Kyrgyzstan, at oblast, rayon and city level, health promotion rooms were set up in family medicine practices, with the aim of integrating health promotion into primary health care (Ibraimova et al., 2011). In countries such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, community health workers are key frontline providers of public health services, including health promotion. In addition to helping to improve the health of the population, their work contributes to raising awareness and competences for public health, health promotion, disease prevention and health protection at the community level (Ibraimova et al., 2011; Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011; Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010). In Uzbekistan, most primary health-care providers are involved in some form of health promotion or health education (Ahmedov et al., 2007).\n\nThere are also many NGOs and international agencies engaged in health promotion activities in the post-Soviet countries. In Armenia, for example, there are few state-sponsored health promotion activities, due to limited financial and human resources as well as poorly defined roles and responsibilities, and health promotion is most commonly conducted by international agencies, often on a sporadic and short-term basis (Armenian et al., 2009). In Kyrgyzstan, on the other hand, there is a range of health promotion initiatives organized by village health committees. These committees have been set up in more than 780 villages, with the participation of approximately 20 000 volunteers. They agree health priorities for each of the villages and pursue concrete activities to address them (Ibraimova et al., 2011; Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). In the Republic of Moldova, 1% of the total fund of the National Health Insurance Company is devoted to health promotion activities, which are implemented by government organizations and NGOs on a competitive basis.\n\nFinally, schools have become settings for health promotion activities as health education has been reintroduced in schools in many countries, including Armenia, the Russian Federation and Tajikistan. In Uzbekistan, for example, a health promotion curriculum was developed in the early 2000s and subsequently rolled out nationwide, covering reproductive health, drug addiction and infectious disease (Ahmedov et al., 2007).\n\nIntersectoral action\n\nIntersectoral action for health is perhaps the most underdeveloped function of public health in the region, due to a prevailing view of health as the responsibility of the health sector (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). A study in the Russian Federation, for example, found that there is only limited intersectoral collaboration between the health sector and the social insurance system, as well as other sectors of society (Axelsson & Bihari-Axelsson, 2005). Health impact assessments, through which the potential health consequences of policies inside and outside the health sector could be identified, are not yet routine practice in most post-Soviet countries.\n\nHowever, the importance of intersectoral action is increasingly being recognized. A number of national health policy documents have now formally embraced the need for a comprehensive intersectoral approach, including in Kazakhstan (Katsaga et al., 2012), the Republic of Moldova (Turcanu et al., 2012) and Ukraine (Lekhan, Rudiy & Richardson, 2010). The challenge is mainly one of implementation.\n\nSome countries have also set up intersectoral governance mechanisms, such as multisectoral coordination committees in the area of HIV/AIDS. In Armenia intersectoral working groups have contributed to the processes of agreeing some pieces of legislation (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). Kyrgyzstan has established an intersectoral public health coordination council at the district level to strengthen collaboration between professional associations, the education sector, NGOs and volunteers from the village health committees (Maier & Martin-Moreno, 2011). In the Republic of Moldova, an Interdepartmental Commission to Fight Drug Use and the Narco-business has been set up (Turcanu et al., 2012), as well as National Coordination Councils for Tobacco and Alcohol Control.\n\nThere are also examples of intersectoral working between different ministries without any formal structures for doing so. In Armenia, for example, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Ministry of Health work in close collaboration in the area of pandemic influenza preparedness (Richardson, 2013). In some countries, ministries of labour and health (and in some cases environment and emergency response) cooperate to improve occupational health and safety (Kim et al., 2014).\n\nSometimes, the involvement of international agencies has triggered multisectoral collaboration. In the areas of HIV/AIDS and TB, one of the conditions imposed by the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria was the establishment of a country-coordinating mechanism at national level. In Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, international agencies support activities to improve nutrition, in particular the prevention of micronutrient deficiencies and this also generally involves multisectoral collaboration (Ahmedov et al., 2007; Khodjamurodov & Rechel, 2010; Ibraimova et al., 2011). The inclusion of health education in school curricula (mentioned above) is another area of intersectoral work, sometimes supported by external agencies.\n\nThe prevention of accidents and injuries is another area in which the need for intersectoral collaboration is evident and where the policy response has long been very weak (McKee et al., 2000). Road traffic safety, for example, is a major concern. In the Russian Federation alone, there were nearly 30 000 road traffic deaths and about 271 000 non-fatal road traffic injuries in 2008, with death rates far in excess of the EU average (Marquez & Bliss, 2008). Another area of intervention relates to falls within houses. In the Russian Federation, Kyrgyzstan and Belarus, children are 22 times more likely to die from a fall than children in the European countries with the lowest mortality rates i.e. Sweden, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom. One major reason for these differences is housing – the countries with lower mortality rates have improved stair design and safe window design (WHO, 2008).\n\nFinally, intersectoral action is required to address the pre-eminent risk factors for morbidity and mortality in the region – tobacco and alcohol consumption (World Bank, 2010; Smith & Nguyen, 2013). Population-based measures, such as tax increases on alcohol and tobacco and smoking bans in public places, will be particularly important and can build on popular support for stronger anti-tobacco and anti-alcohol policies (Roberts et al., 2012a; Smith & Nguyen, 2013). As mentioned in Chapter 2, all post-Soviet countries have become parties to the WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control and have started to implement tobacco advertising restrictions, product warnings and labelling, smoking bans, awareness raising campaigns and some tax increases on tobacco products (WHO, 2011) but there is still a long way to go (Mir et al., 2012).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe health crisis engulfing the post-Soviet countries calls for a strong and comprehensive public health response. So far, however, this response is still mostly lacking, particularly with regard to the prevention of noncommunicable diseases and injuries.\n\nReforms of public health services in the former Soviet countries have lagged behind those in other parts of the health system (Maier et al., 2009) but many have now started to reorient their public health structures, either broadening the remit of the traditional san-epid services or setting up new structures, such as for the promotion of healthy lifestyles. However, sometimes these new structures are not adequately financed and staffed and there are challenges of integration and strengthening the capacity of primary health care to deliver public health functions.\n\nHealth protection has been a traditional focus of san-epid services but major challenges remain with regard to the frequent neglect of environmental health and the task of strengthening occupational health in a liberalized environment with widespread informal markets. Disease prevention has been another traditional concern of public health services but the focus remains on communicable disease control, and large-scale screening activities in some countries are not always based on sound evidence, may not reach those at greatest risk and could waste precious resources and good will. Health promotion is still underdeveloped but is now gaining increasing attention in a range of settings. Finally, intersectoral action is often confined to a few policy areas and the health impact of policies is often not considered. It will not be possible to address the health crisis in the post-Soviet countries without stepping up public health action, in particular in the areas of alcohol and tobacco consumption and the prevention of accidents and injuries."
