        "text": "Employing data from three surveys of mass opinion conducted in Lithuania, Ukraine and European Russia during 1990, 1991 and 1992, we examine three prominent but competing hypotheses about the source of political values in the post-Soviet societies: historically derived political culture, regime indoctrination and the effects of societal modernization. The literature on Soviet political culture argues that Russian mass values are distinguished by authoritarianism and love of order, values which will be largely shared by Ukrainians, especially East Ukrainians, whereas Lithuanian society would not evince this pattern. Our data do not support this hypothesis. We then examine acceptance of Soviet era norms, both political and economic. We do not find support for the argument that regime indoctrination during the Soviet period produced a set of ideologically derived values throughout the former Soviet Union and across a series of generations. The third hypothesis – that industrialization, urbanization, war and changing educational opportunities shaped the formative experiences of succeeding generations in the Soviet societies and, therefore, their citizens' values – receives the most support: in each of the three societies, differences in political values across age groups, places of residence and levels of education are noteworthy. The variations in political values we find across demographic groupings help us to understand the level of pro-democratic values in each society. We find that in Russia and Ukraine more support for democracy can be found among urban, better educated respondents than among other groups. In Lithuania, the urban and better educated respondents evince pro-democratic values at about the same level as their counterparts in Russia and Ukraine, but Lithuanian farmers and blue-collar workers support democracy at a level closer to urban, white-collar Lithuanians than to their Russian and Ukrainian counterparts. In all three societies, those citizens most likely to hold values supportive of democracy are those who are less favourable to Soviet-era values and less convinced of the primacy of the need for social and political ‘order’. Those who desire strong leadership, however, tend to have more democratic values, not more authoritarian ones.\n\n3 Following Almond's influential work, a society's political orientations are commonly referred to under the rubric ‘political culture’. See Almond, Gabriel, ‘Comparative Political Systems’, Journal of Politics, 18 (1956), 391–409.CrossRefGoogle Scholar A large body of work relates ‘political culture’ to democratization. However, to measure and analyse a society's political culture per se presents severe theoretical and methodological problems. The researcher runs foul of the inability of political culture theorists to agree on a definition of the term, to relate individual orientations to society-wide ‘cultures’, and to provide clear hypotheses about how individual orientations will influence either individual behaviour or society-wide political outcomes. On the other hand, the distribution of certain key values does merit investigation. Fortunately, we can investigate values without the encumbrance of dealing with political culture in its entirety. Despite eschewing the label ‘political culture’ to depict the object of our interest, we use our findings to discuss the prospects for democracy, as have those studying political culture. (Compare this list of the challenges facing those who employ political culture as a concept to the discussion in Lane, Ruth, ‘Political Culture: Residual Category or General Theory?’ Comparative Political Studies, 25 (1992), 362–87.)CrossRefGoogle Scholar\n\n9 Those who stress the Russian desire for a strong leader include Pipes, Richard, Russia Under the Old Regime (New York: Scribner's, 1974)Google Scholar; White, , ‘The USSR’Google Scholar; Crouch, , Revolution and Evolution, p. 88Google Scholar; and Smith, , Soviet Politics, p. 12.Google ScholarPipes, and White, (pp. 29–30)Google Scholar discuss patrimonialism as an aspect of Russian political culture. For pertinent results from émigré surveys, see Inkeles, and Bauer, , The Soviet Citizen, pp. 246–7Google Scholar; and Gitelman, , ‘Soviet Political Culture’, p. 559.Google Scholar The more recent findings of support for strong leadership are in Bialer, Seweryn, ‘Is Socialism Dead?’ in Jervis, Robert and Bialer, Seweryn, eds, Soviet-American Relations After the Cold War (Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1991), pp. 98–106.Google Scholar Social psychologists have also sought in recent years to apply scales that measure psychological ‘authoritarianism’ to Russian samples. For an example using a small quota sample of Muscovites in 1991, see Sam McFarland, G., Ageyev, Vladimir S. and Aabalakina-Paap, Marina, ‘Authoritarianism in the Former Soviet Union’, Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 63 (1992), 1004–10.CrossRefGoogle Scholar The authors find, inter alia, that the Russian sample was slightly lower overall than a similar American sample and that Russian authoritarianism became less closely associated with Marxist-Leninist ideology between 1989 and 1991.\n\nOne must be extremely cautious in drawing implications about the ‘authoritarian’ nature of a heritage of valuing strong leadership. Someone finding that Russians desire a strogii nachal'nik (a decisive or firm leader, one with a strong hand on the rudder) should not hastily interpret this as approval for absolutist rule. Having a strong and accountable leader is precisely the reason why most democracies have a single executive officer whose power and whose responsibility for the success or failure of government policy distinguish him or her from the legislature, even when that person depends on a parliamentary majority for continuing in office. Weak leadership is a bad idea in any political system. The key questions in assessing acceptance of democracy are whether the citizens desire limits on the leader, in both time and scope, and who they believe ought to invoke those limits. In fact, to foreshadow later analyses in this article, we find that desire for strong leadership is positively correlated with democratic values, even when holding other factors constant.\n\n13 A slightly different argument would be that the ethnicity of the respondent is more important for degree of authoritarian values than the residence of the respondent. If so, a better test would be to group Russians and other Slavs together and compare them to other nationalities, regardless of republic. A t-test of the hypothesis that the mean value on the index of order discussed below is equal between Slavs and non-Slavs results in statistics of 0.33 in Russia and 1.14 in Ukraine (both statistically insignificant) but of 4.13 (statistically significant) in Lithuania, where most Slavic residents immigrated in recent decades. In Lithuania, it quite clearly did matter whether Russian or Lithuanian. Elsewhere, it did not.\n\n25 Hahn, , ‘Continuity and Change in Russian Political Culture’, p. 417Google Scholar, stresses education level. A partially competing explanation for age differences found in a sample is that orientations can change over the life cycle of an individual and that older respondents will be likely to be more conservative because of their place in the cycle of life, not their formative experiences. See Jennings, M. Kent and Niemi, Richard, Generations and Politics: A Panel Study of Young Adults and Their Parents (Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 1981)CrossRefGoogle Scholar; and Flanagan, Scott, ‘Changing Values in Advanced Industrial Society’, Comparative Political Studies, 14 (1982), 403–44.CrossRefGoogle Scholar We do not seek to distinguish between these effects rigorously but note that the two seem likely to work together. The older generation are currently the most conservative in support of the Soviet period and Soviet institutions, but a natural tendency to value the past more highly than younger age cohorts is reinforced by the oldest generation's experiences during the early years of Soviet power. We can point, moreover, to partial evidence that political generations are salient in these societies, since the generational pattern is somewhat different in Lithuania from that which it is in Russia and Ukraine."
