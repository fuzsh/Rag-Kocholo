        "text": "Russiaâs war in Ukraine is an ongoing tragedy, destroying lives and livelihoods in Ukraine and altering economic patterns worldwide. In May 2022, we set out an initial analysis of 12 disruptions that the war could unleash. With the passage of time, it seems increasingly likely that the war, coming so soon after a global pandemic, could presage a new economic era. We have been here before: todayâs shocks are reminiscent of the immediate aftermath of World War II (1944â46), the oil crisis (1971â73), and the breakup of the Soviet Union (1989â92). Each of those events changed the global landscape with the sudden release of powerful underlying forces that had been building up around a fault line over time. Each ushered in a new era.\n\nTo understand the shape of the era now unfolding, we have tracked the evolution of the warâs disruptions since May 2022. At that time, some disruptions were already well under wayânotably the humanitarian crisis that followed immediately from the invasion. As we highlighted, others were less predictable but worth watchingâfor example, we noted that the direct impact of the war on financial systems had so far been limited, but that risks from wider ripple effects might materialize.\n\nIn this update, we look at whatâs happened in the 16 months since the invasion. As recent events in Ukraine highlight, the ultimate outcome remains profoundly uncertain. However, we find five disruptions with clear effects that may endure: the humanitarian crisis, energy source diversification, defense spending increases, cyber as a stage for conflict, and corporationsâ pull-back from Russia.\n\nThree other disruptions have eased, as connections in our global system, together with cooling of demand, buffered their effects. These include spikes in prices and supply disruptions for food, metals, and minerals, which have now dissipated.\n\nOf course, in the past year, forces beyond the war in Ukraine have also roiled the system in compounding, intertwined ways: the steady rise of interest rates, Chinaâs lockdown and reopening, severe weather, and broader geopolitical tensions. All are contributing additional uncertainty. These forces have become the most important drivers of three more disruptions we noted in May 2022âmost prominently, the burden carried by the poorest people, a splintering of tech standards, and financial-system instability.\n\nOngoing and persistent disruption\n\nThe warâs impact has persisted across several spheres, from the humanitarian crisis to energy market shifts. Although some of the conflictâs long-term outcomes remain unclear, these once-emerging dynamics have begun to solidify.\n\nResilience and recalibration\n\nSome of the initial shocks from the invasion have leveled out. In particular, high prices in select sectors have reverted to prewar levels, while global value chains have filled production gaps.\n\nCompounding complexities\n\nIn May 2022, we thought that the war in Ukraine might directly and unambiguously influence these areas. It hasnât. Instead, the ongoing conflict is one of several forces that are complicating important aspects of global affairs.\n\nVolatility, volatility, volatility\n\nThe Greek philosopher Heraclitus taught that all things are in continual flux, and change is the only constant. That certainly seems true today.\n\nÂ\n\nAs we noted in May 2022, these disruptions are already affecting peopleâs lives and livelihoods with potent force and should be part of every companyâs scenario planning. The past 16 months have shown that the trends set in motion by the war are far from dispositive regarding the global economy. Each will bear watching over coming months.\n\nÂ"
