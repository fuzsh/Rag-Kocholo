Here are some pivotal moments in the years leading up to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, as well as a brief look at their relationship in the 20th century.\n\n2014 — Protesters in Ukraine overthrow President Viktor Yanukovych in February. He had been friendly to Russia’s interests. During the revolution, more than 100 people are killed in protests that centered on the main square in the capital, Kyiv, often called the Maidan.\n\nThe interim government that follows this pro-Western revolution eventually signs a trade agreement with the European Union that is seen as a first step toward membership in the bloc."
