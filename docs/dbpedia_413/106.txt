In the aftermath of the collapse of the outer and inner Soviet empires in 1989 and 1991, it was widely believed that the postcommunist states of East-Central Europe and Eurasia, freed from the iron grip of the imperial center, would rid themselves of communism's perverse legacies and, having undergone the appropriate socioeconomic transformations, become "normal" European countries. Some postcommunist nations did, in fact, act in that manner, and now the most advanced of them are members of NATO and candidate members of the European Union, which testifies to the fact that they are indeed on the right track toward European normalcy. Others, however, were not so successful: their transitions to "liberal democracy and market economy" have proved, so far, to be sad failures. Independent Ukraine undoubtedly falls into the latter category. Unlike the Poles or the Balts, proud of their achievements and optimistically looking to the future, most Ukrainians tend to gloomily repeat a fatalistic maxim coined by their first president, Leonid Kravchuk: maiemo te, shcho maiemo (we've got what we've got). To understand why Ukraine's transition has stalled (or rather, resulted in the creation of a peculiar-but definitely "un-European"-social system), in this article I examine the interrelationship between the Soviet (and, in some cases, even pre-Soviet) legacy and the political strategies of the newly born country's rulers. In particular, I explore the historical peculiarities of state- and nation-building in Ukraine, the character of the 1991 "national-democratic revolution," the quality of the local elites, and the true nature of their policies, as well as popular social and political attitudes in Ukraine.
