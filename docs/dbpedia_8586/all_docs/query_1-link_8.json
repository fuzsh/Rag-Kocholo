IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER OR CONTRIBUTORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.\n\nThese frameworks make customizing your ZSH setup easier.\n\nYou can find some interesting performance timing comparisons of various frameworks in the following locations.\n\nrossmacarthur/zsh-plugin-manager-benchmark - Contains performance benchmarks for the most popular ZSH frameworks, including both install time and load time.\n\npm-perf-test - Tooling for running performance tests on multiple ZSH frameworks.\n\nAlf is an out of this world super fast and configurable framework for ZSH; it's modeled after Prezto and Antigen while utilizing Oh-My-Zsh under the covers; and offers standard defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, automated updates and installable prompt themes and plugins.\n\nansible-role-zsh is an ansible role with zero-knowledge installation. It uses antigen to manage bundles and oh-my-zsh. Can load bundles conditionally. By default it includes the powerlevel9k theme, autosuggestions, syntax-highlighting and fzf-widgets and fzf-marks. Fully customizable.\n\nAnt-zsh is a tiny and lightweight ZSH configuration environment for special customization needs. It includes plugins, themes and a basic convenient setup.\n\nAntibody is a faster and simpler antigen written in Golang. More details are available at http://getantibody.github.io/.\n\nAntidote is a ZSH plugin manager made from the ground up thinking about performance.\n\nIt is fast because it can do things concurrently, and generates an ultra-fast static plugin file that you can include in your ZSH config.\n\nIt is written natively in ZSH, is well tested, and picks up where Antibody left off.\n\nuse-omz enables easy use of Oh-My-ZSH with antidote.\n\nantigen-hs is a replacement for antigen optimized for a low overhead when starting up a zsh session. It will automatically clone plugins for you.\n\nAntigen is a small set of functions that help you easily manage your shell (ZSH) plugins, called bundles. The concept is pretty much the same as bundles in a typical vim+pathogen setup. Antigen is to ZSH, what Vundle is to vim. Antigen can load oh-my-zsh themes and plugins and will automatically clone them for you.\n\nAx-ZSH is a modular configuration system for ZSH. It provides sane defaults and is extendable by plugins.\n\nAx-ZSH integrates well with Powerlevel10k and other extensions, including plugins compatible with oh-my-zsh.\n\nA minimalist ZSH plugin manager.\n\nDotzsh strives to be platform and version independent. Some functionality may be lost when running under older versions of ZSH, but it should degrade cleanly and allow you to use the same setup on multiple machines of differing OSes without problems.\n\nfresh is a tool to source shell configuration (aliases, functions, etc) from others into your own configuration files. We also support files such as ackrc and gitconfig. Think of it as Bundler for your dot files.\n\nminiplug is a minimalistic plugin manager for ZSH.\n\nNo crashes or double plugin loading when re-sourcing .zshrc\n\nUnlike other frameworks, Miniplug does not pollute your $PATH\n\nOnly does the bare minimum for managing plugins\n\noh-my-zsh is a community-driven framework for managing your ZSH configuration. Includes 120+ optional plugins (rails, git, macOS, hub, capistrano, brew, ant, MacPorts, etc), over 120 themes to spice up your morning, and an auto-update tool that makes it easy to keep up with the latest updates from the community.\n\nPMS allows you to manage your shell in a way to that helps decrease setup time and increases your productivity. It has support for themes (change the way your shell looks), plugins (adds functionality to your shell), and dotfile management.\n\nThe PMS framework also allows you to use the same framework in different shells. Use ZSH on your personal laptop, and use bash on remote servers. Wanna try fish? Go ahead, try out different shells.\n\nPrezto enriches the ZSH command line interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion, and prompt themes. There are some prezto-specific plugins at https://github.com/belak/prezto-contrib.\n\nPumice is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH.\n\nA fast, configurable, shell plugin manager.\n\nCan manage\n\nAny git repository.\n\nBranch/tag/commit support.\n\nExtra support for GitHub repositories.\n\nExtra support for Gists.\n\nArbitrary remote files, simply specify the URL.\n\nLocal plugins, simply specify the directory path.\n\nHighly configurable install methods using handlebars templating.\n\nSuper-fast parallel installation.\n\nConfiguration file using TOML syntax.\n\nUses a lock file for much faster loading of plugins.\n\nAn easy solution for managing your shell environments. Works with both bash and zsh. Makes it easy to sync your environment across multiple machines with a git repository.\n\nToasty is a ZSH framework made to facilitate management, not dictate it.\n\nA ZSH micro plugin manager.\n\nx-cmd is a toolset implemented using posix shell and awk.It is very small in size and offers many interesting features. Here is a milestone demo: https://x-cmd.com/\n\nTools Provided by x-cmd:\n\nWrappers for Common Commands (e.g., cd, ip, ps, tar, apt, brew): These wrapped commands are more intelligent and easier to use compared to the native commands.\n\nLightweight Package Management Tool: We have implemented a lightweight package management tool using shell and awk. Through it, you can quickly obtain most common software tools, such as jq, 7za, bat, nvim, python, node, go, etc.\n\nCLI for Useful Websites (e.g., github.com, cht.sh): We have wrapped their APIs using shell and awk for daily use and to obtain corresponding services in scripts.\n\nAI Tools: We provide CLIs for ChatGPT, Gemini, Jina.ai, etc., and have wrapped corresponding shortcut commands for different application scenarios, such as @gemini for chatting with Gemini AI and @zh for using AI to translate specified content or command results.\n\nYazt is a simple ZSH theme manager in maintenance that is compatible with nearly everything. You can use prompts in plugins, mix 'n' match two themes and with a few modifications, you can even use it in bash.\n\nyzsh is a simple ZSH framework for managing plugins, themes, functions, aliases and environment variables.\n\nzap is a minimal ZSH plugin manager.\n\nzapack is a basic fast minimal ZSH plugin loader.\n\nzcomet is a minimalistic ZSH plugin manager that gets you to the prompt surprisingly quickly without caching (see the benchmarks). In addition to loading and updating plugins stored in git repositories, it supports lazy-loading plugins (further reducing startup time) as well as downloading and sourcing code snippets.\n\nZeesh is a cross-platform ZSH framework. It's similar to, but incompatible with, oh-my-zsh. It has a modular plugin architecture making it easy to extend. It has a rich set of defaults, but is designed to be as lightweight as possible.\n\nzgem is a plugin manager for ZSH that supports loading and updating plugins and themes from git, http and local files.\n\nZgen is a lightweight plugin manager for ZSH inspired by Antigen. The goal is to have minimal overhead when starting up the shell because nobody likes waiting.\n\nIt is currently not being actively maintained and I recommend you use the zgenom fork instead, which is actively maintained and continues to get new features.\n\nA lightweight plugin manager for ZSH that is a fork that extends the brilliant zgen and provides more features and bugfixes while being fully backwards compatible.\n\nTo keep loading fast during new terminal sessions, zgenom generates a static init.zsh file which does nothing but source your plugins and append them to your fpath.\n\nThis minimizes startup time by not having to execute time consuming logic (plugin checking, updates, etc) during every shell session's startup. The downside is that you have to refresh the init script manually with zgenom reset whenever you update your plugin list in your .zshrc.\n\nZgenom can load oh-my-zsh-compatible and prezto-compatible plugins and themes, and will automagically git clone plugins for you when you add them to your plugin list.\n\nzilsh is a ZSH config system that aims to appeal more to power-users and follow the simplistic approach of vim-pathogen.\n\nZim is a ZSH configuration framework with blazing speed and modular extensions.\n\nZinit is an innovative and probably (because of the Turbo) the fastest plugin manager with support for:\n\nTurbo mode – 80% faster ZSH startup! for example: instead of 200 ms, it'll be 40 ms\n\nCompletion management (selectively disable and enable completions)\n\nSnippets (↔ regular files downloaded via-URL, e.g.: scripts) and through them Oh My Zsh and Prezto plugins support (→ low overhead)\n\nAnnexes (↔ Zinit extensions)\n\nReports (from the plugin loads – plugins are no longer black boxes)\n\nPlugin unloading (allows e.g.: dynamic theme switching)\n\nbindkey capturing and remapping\n\npackages\n\nClean fpath (the array $fpath is not being used to add completions and autoload functions, hence it stays concise, not bloated)\n\nServices ↔ a single-instance, background plugins\n\nAlso, in general: all the mechanisms from the ZSH Plugin Standard – Zinit is a reference implementation of the standard.\n\nThe project is very active – currently > 3100 commits.\n\nThis is Zinit 4 from the original author, who once removed the Zinit repository from GitHub. This spawned a community-driven zdharma-continuum organization that revived all of psprint's ZSH projects. Its main innovations from the @zdharma-continuum fork are:\n\nAppImage distribution (release link),\n\nAction complete – press Alt-Shift-A and Alt-Shift-C to complete plugin names and ice modifiers,\n\nThemes – set $ZITHEME to one of default, blue and gold to set a color set to use for Zinit 4 messages,\n\nNew ice build which is equivalent of three other ices: null, configure and make install and simply builds the project from sources, with support for autotools/CMake/Meson/Scons.\n\nThese are the most visible changes, but there are more (like e.g.: support for compiling with libraries from previously built projects/$ZPFX).\n\nzit is a plugin manager for ZSH. It is minimal because it implements the bare minimum to be qualified as a plugin manager: it allows the user to install plugins from git repositories (and git repositories only, that's why the name), source plugins and update them. It does not implement fancy functions like cleanup of removed plugins, automatic compilation of installed plugins, alias for oh-my-zsh/prezto/other ZSH frameworks, building binaries, $PATH manipulation and others.\n\nzlugin is a very lightweight ZSH plugin manager.\n\n⚡Znap is a light-weight plugin manager & git repository manager for ZSH that's easy to grok. While tailored for ZSH plugins specifically, Znap also functions as a general-purpose utility for managing git repositories.\n\nZnap can:\n\nMake any prompt appear instantly. Reduce your startup time from ~200ms to ~40ms with just one command.\n\nAsynchronously compile your plugins and functions.\n\nCache those expensive eval $(commands).\n\nClone or pull multiple repos in parallel.\n\nRe-clone all your repos without you having to re-enter them.\n\nMulti-repo management\n\nAutomatic compinit and bashinit - you no longer need them in your .zshrc, znap will do them automatically as needed.\n\nZoppo is the crippled configuration framework for ZSH. As an Italian saying goes: \"chi va con lo zoppo, impara a zoppicare\", we realized we were walking with a cripple and are now going to become crippled ourselves.\n\nZpacker is a lightweight ZSH plugin & theme management framework.\n\nThe minuscule ZSH package manager. No frills, no bloat, just 2 kB of 100% ZSH code, providing complete package management for your ZSH environment.\n\nZSH package managers are abundant, but most are bloated, slow or have excessive requirements. On top of that, more than a few have been abandoned for years. Zpico does not seek to be the best of the best, rather to balance functionality against a tiny, fast footprint.\n\n🌺 Zplug is a next-generation ZSH plugin manager.\n\nCan manage everything\n\nZSH plugins/UNIX commands on GitHub and Bitbucket\n\nGist files (gist.github.com)\n\nExternally managed plugins e.g., oh-my-zsh and prezto plugins/themes\n\nBinary artifacts on GitHub Releases\n\nLocal plugins\n\netc. (you can add your own sources!)\n\nSuper-fast parallel installation/update\n\nSupport for lazy-loading\n\nBranch/tag/commit support\n\nPost-update, post-load hooks\n\nDependencies between packages\n\nUnlike antigen, no ZSH plugin files (*.plugin.zsh) are required\n\nInteractive interface (fzf, peco, zaw, and so on)\n\nCache mechanism for reducing the startup time\n\nzpm ( ZSH Plugin Manager ) is a plugin manager for ZSH which combines the imperative and declarative approach. At first run, zpm will do complex logic and generate a cache, after that will only use the cache, so it makes this framework very fast.\n\nFastest plugin manager (Really, after the first run, zpm will not be used at all)\n\nSupport for async loading\n\nDependencies between packages\n\nzpm runs on Linux, macOS, FreeBSD and Android.\n\nzpm plugins are compatible with oh-my-zsh.\n\nzr is a quick, simple ZSH plugin manager written in Rust and easily installable with cargo install zr.\n\nzsh.ai\n\nFocuses on security and hardening of local system. Requires fzf\n\nzshing is a ZSH plugin manager similar to Vundle/Vim and allows you to...\n\nKeep track of and configure your plugins right in the .zshrc\n\nInstall ZSH plugins\n\nUpdate ZSH plugins\n\nSearch by name all available ZSH Plugins\n\nClean unused plugins up\n\nRun the above actions in a single command\n\nManages the Source Plugins of your installed Plugins\n\nCustomize your .zshrc with only ~21 lines of code. Based on zsh-unplugged.\n\nA simple plugin manager for zsh. Features:\n\nAuto-updates all plugins.\n\nAuto-updates itself.\n\nConfigurable time interval for both auto-updaters.\n\nzshPlug is a minimalist plugin manager heavily based on zap.\n\nZtanesh aims to improve your UNIX command line experience and productivity with the the configuration provided by the ztanesh project: the tools will make your shell more powerful and easier to use.\n\nztheme is a small and fast theme engine for ZSH.\n\nA simple and fast ZSH plugin manager. It uses zcompile and async loading to speed up your shell startup time.\n\nZulu is a environment manager for ZSH 5 or later, which aims to make it easy to manage your shell without writing any code.\n\nEasily manage your shell environment without editing files.\n\nCreate aliases, functions and environment variables, and have them available to you at the next shell startup.\n\nAdd and remove directories from $path, $fpath and $cdpath with simple commands.\n\nInstall packages, plugins and themes easily, and have them available to you immediately.\n\nThis section is for full setup dropins - they aren't frameworks, but they're not simple plugins/themes either.\n\nzsh-quickstart-kit - A simple quickstart for using ZSH with zgenom. This automatically configures ZSH to use zgenom to load a curated (but easily customizable) collection of plugins and periodically automatically update itself, the plugins, and the quickstart kit itself.\n\nZPWR - An extremely powerful custom terminal environment built on top of Zinit for maximum speed. A full terminal configuration framework including zsh, tmux, fzf, vim and spacemacs configurations. It includes:\n\n12.9k+ tab completions\n\n1.9k+ aliases\n\n330+ git aliases\n\n400+ zpwr subcommands\n\n2.8k functions\n\n175+ zpwr environment variables\n\n175+ perl, python, bash, ZSH scripts\n\n2.8k line README.md\n\n50k+ LOC\n\n1 line install\n\nIf you're on a Mac, the zsh that comes with it is usually pretty stale. You can use brew install zsh to update it.\n\nMany of the themes here use special glyphs for things like displaying a branch icon. You'll need to use a Nerd Font or a Powerline-compatible font in your terminal program or you'll see ugly broken boxes where the symbols should be.\n\nHere are a few good sources for Nerd Fonts and Powerline-compatible fonts:\n\nAwesome Terminal Fonts - A family of fonts that include some nice monospaced Icons.\n\nCascadia Code - Microsoft's Cascadia Code\n\nFantasque Awesome Font - A nice monospaced font, patched with Font-Awesome, Octoicons, and Powerline-Glyphs.\n\nFira Mono - Mozilla's Fira type family.\n\nHack - Another Powerline-compatible font designed for source code and terminal usage.\n\nInput Mono - A family of fonts designed specifically for code.
