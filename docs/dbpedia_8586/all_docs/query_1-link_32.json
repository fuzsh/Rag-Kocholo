Auto-completion not only saves on typing, but helps to avoid errors.\n\nInstalling autocompletion in your profile\n\nTony has provided instructions on how to install the script with brew. However, it not hard to install this manually in your .bash_profile or .bashrc. First, clone the github repository on to your system (I keep all projects like this in an un-creatively named ‘Projects’ folder):\n\n$ cd ~/Projects $ git clone https://github.com/Honestpuck/autopkg_complete.git\n\nThis will download the project to autopkg_create. The file we need is the autopkg file inside that folder.\n\nThen add the following lines to your .bash_profile or .bashrc:\n\nif [[ -r \"$HOME/Projects/autopkg_complete/autopkg\" ]]; then source \"$HOME/Projects/autopkg_complete/autopkg\" fi\n\nYou will need to adjust the path if you are using a different location. Basically these lines say: if this file exists and is readable, then read and interpret it as bash source. Since you need to define functions in the context of the shell, you need to `source` the file, rather execute it as script. (When you run the the file as a script, the functions will be defined in the context of the script, and then ‘forgotten’ when the script ends.)\n\nSave your new profile and open a new Terminal window or type\n\n$ source ~/.bash_profile\n\nto update an existing shell.\n\nThanks again to Tony Williams, this is very useful!"
