I have PlistEdit Pro assigned to open .recipe file extensions.\n\nrecipe-edit will open the recipe file in BBEdit, which doesn’t suck.\n\nrecipe-reveal will open the recipe in the Finder. The bash alias reveal for open -R is quite useful independent of autopkg.\n\nAdapt for your own choice of editors."
