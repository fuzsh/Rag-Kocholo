        "text": "Latest release is here.\n\nAutoPkg is an automation framework for macOS software packaging and distribution, oriented towards the tasks one would normally perform manually to prepare third-party software for mass deployment to managed clients.\n\nThese tasks typically involve at least several of the following steps:\n\ndownloading an application and/or updates for it, usually via a web browser\n\nextracting them from a multitude of archive formats\n\nadding site-specific configuration\n\nadding sane versioning information\n\n\"fixing\" poorly-written installer scripts\n\nsaving these modifications back to a compressed disk image or installer package\n\nimporting these into a software distribution system like Munki, Jamf Pro, FileWave, etc.\n\ncustomizing the associated metadata for such a system with site-specific data, post-installation scripts, version info or other metadata\n\nOften these tasks follow similar patterns for each individual application, and when managing many applications this becomes a daily task full of sub-tasks that one must remember (and/or maintain documentation for) about exactly what had to be done for a successful deployment of every update for every managed piece of software.\n\nWith AutoPkg, we define these steps in a \"Recipe\" file in plist or yaml format, run automatically instead of by hand, and shared with others.\n\nInstall the latest release.\n\nAutoPkg requires macOS, and Git is highly recommended to have installed so that autopkg can use git to can manage recipe repositories. Knowledge of Git itself is not required.\n\nAutoPkg is tested on the current macOS release. It may work on older releases, but is not actively tested on older releases.\n\nGit can be installed via Apple's command-line developer tools package, which can be prompted for installation by simply typing 'git' in a Terminal window (OS X 10.9 or later).\n\nSince AutoPkg 2.0, Python 2 is no longer supported. The installer linked above contains a bundled version of Python 3 and all needed dependencies.\n\nA getting started guide is available here.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions (and answers!) are here.\n\nSee the wiki for more documentation."
