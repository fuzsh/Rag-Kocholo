        "text": "SOFTWARE FOR CONTINUATION AND BIFURCATION PROBLEMS IN ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS\n\nThis is the Home Page of the AUTO Web Site, established in January 1996.\n\nANNOUNCEMENTS\n\n[November 30, 2019] Version 0.8 of AUTO-07p is available at GitHub.\n\n[January 1, 2011] Version 0.8 of AUTO-07p is available at SourceForge.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAUTO is a software for continuation and bifurcation problems in ordinary differential equations, originally developed by Eusebius Doedel, with subsequent major contribution by several people, including Alan Champneys, Fabio Dercole, Thomas Fairgrieve, Yuri Kuznetsov, Bart Oldeman, Randy Paffenroth, Bjorn Sandstede, Xianjun Wang, and Chenghai Zhang.\n\nAUTO can do a limited bifurcation analysis of algebraic systems of the form\n\nf(u,p) = 0, f,u in Rn\n\nand of systems of ordinary differential equations of the form\n\nu'(t) = f(u(t),p), f,u in Rn\n\nsubject to initial conditions, boundary conditions, and integral constraints. Here p denotes one or more parameters. AUTO can also do certain continuation and evolution computations for parabolic PDEs. It also includes the software HOMCONT for the bifurcation analysis of homoclinic orbits. AUTO is quite fast and can benefit from multiple processors; therefore it is applicable to rather large systems of differential equations.\n\nFor further information and details, see the AUTO Documentation.\n\nAUTO STATUS/EVOLUTION\n\nThe following table represents the historical evolution in the development of AUTO in a chronological order.\n\nAUTO AVAILABILITY/DISTRIBUTION\n\nThe AUTO package is available for UNIX/Linux-based computers.\n\nAUTO-07P\n\nAUTO-07p is the successor to both AUTO97 and AUTO2000.\n\nIt includes new plotting utilities, namely PyPlaut and Plaut04. It also contains many of the features of AUTO2000, including the Python CLUI, some parallelization, dynamic memory allocation, and the ability to use user equation files written in C. The overall performance has improved, especially for systems where the Jacobian matrix is sparse.\n\nAUTO-07p is written in Fortran. At least a Fortran 90 compiler is required to compile AUTO-07p. One such compiler is the freely downloadable GNU Fortran 95 compiler (gfortran). Gfortran ships with most current Linux distributions.\n\nDistribution: Download at GitHub.\n\nAUTO DOCUMENTATION\n\nThe AUTO distribution include a copy of the AUTO Manual in LATEX, PostScript, and Portable Document Format (PDF).\n\nAUTO APPLICATIONS\n\nAUTO has been used in many scientific and engineering applications. A sample of applications can be found by searching on the Web for \"bifurcation software AUTO\".\n\nRELATED SOFTWARE\n\nOther software directly or indirectly related to AUTO includes DSTool, PyDSTool, XPPAUT, Content, MatCont, and DDE-BifTool.\n\nRELATED LECTURE NOTES\n\nLecture Notes on Numerical Analysis of Nonlinear Equations. By Eusebius Doedel. Last Modified: Spring 2010.\n\nCONTACT/FEEDBACK\n\nIf you have any comments, questions, or suggestions, please let us know by mailing \"doedel at cse dot concordia dot ca\" with \"Subject: AUTO Related.\" An enquiry should include full name and affiliation."
