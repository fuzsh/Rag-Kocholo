The package system is flexible: a package may consist of Haskell code, foreign language code (eg. C libraries), or a mixture of the two. A package is a good way to group together related Haskell modules, and is essential if you intend to make the modules into a Windows DLL (see below).\n\nBecause packages can contain both Haskell and C libraries, they are also a good way to provide convenient access to a Haskell layer over a C library."
