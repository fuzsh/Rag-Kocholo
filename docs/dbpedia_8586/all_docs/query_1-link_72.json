        "text": "munki-in-a-box\n\nPost Munki Install Simple Deployment Script\n\nThe goal of this script is to deploy a basic munki repo in a simple script based on a set of common variables. I have placed defaults in these variables, but they are easily overridden and you should decide where they go.\n\nThis script is based upon the Demonstration Setup Guide for Munki, AutoPKG, and other sources. My sincerest thanks to Greg Neagle, Tim Sutton, Allister Banks, Rich Trouton, Charles Edge, Pepijn Bruienne, the Linde Group, Mike Lynn and numerous others who have helped me assemble this script. The Mac Admins Community is supportive and awesome.\n\n###Pre-Requisites:\n\n10.10/Server 4, 10.11/Server 5\n\nWeb services enabled\n\n###Directions for Use:\n\nDownload Script\n\nAlter Lines 20-21 to reflect your choice for munki repo name and location\n\nAlter Line 32 to reflect your choice of AutoPKG installs\n\nAlter Line 36 to reflect your admin username (ladmin is default)\n\nAlter Line 38 to reflect your preferred HTTP Basic Authorization password\n\n./munkiinabox.sh\n\nEnable the \"Allow overrides using .htaccess files\" option in Server.app > Web > SSL Website > Edit Advanced Settings\n\nIf you do not make changes to the script before running it, the script may not run as intended. Please double-check to make sure that you are comfortable with the variables' values.\n\n##Caveats:\n\nWhen you setup AutoPkgr, be sure to understand the security implications of giving that GUI app, and its associated launchdaemons, access to the keychain. You should really use a one-off account for those notifications, and not, say, the admin account to your Google Domain. Just sayin'.\n\nIncluded Tools & Projects:\n\n##Munki\n\nMunki is a client management solution for the Mac. I'm assuming you know a little bit about how Munki works by installing it via this script, but I would be remiss not to point you to Munki's official documentation. It is mostly installed in /usr/local/munki\n\n##MunkiAdmin\n\nMunkiAdmin is Hannes Juutilainen's native GUI application for managing Munki repositories. It is super handy for those who prefer graphical interfaces to their inscrutable XML files. It is installed in the /Applications/Utilities directory.\n\n##AutoPkg\n\nAutoPkg is an automated updates tool, used primarily from the command line, or through AutoPkgr, to keep a set of application installers up to date, and part of your Munki repository. AutoPkg is recipe-based, which means anyone can write their own recipe list and make it available. We are importing the main recipe repository, but if you want to add your own later, the AutoPkg docs will tell you how. Autopkg is installed in the /usr/local/bin directory.\n\n##AutoPkgr\n\nAutoPkgr is the Linde Group's native GUI application used for managing AutoPkg's command line functionality. Specifically, you can configure it to periodically check for new updates, import those into your Munki repository, then email you about what new versions have been imported for testing. It is installed in the /Applications/Utilities directory.\n\n##Munkireport-php\n\nMunkireport-php is a lightweight reporting engine for your munki interface. It requires the installation of a nopkg item in Munki, which is already part of your site_default catalog. The webpage is viewable at http://YOURHOSTNAMEGOESHERE/munkireport-php/\n\nThe default user & pass are root:root. You can add a user by going to:\n\nhttp://YOURHOSTNAMEGOESHERE/munkireport-php/index.php?/auth/generate\n\nThen you must add that configuration line into the config.php file in $WEBROOT/munkireport-php/\n\nFor more information on munkireport-php, please be sure to visit their documentation.\n\n###Changelog\n\nNew in 1.5.2:\n\n• Bug fix to the htpasswd section.\n\nNew in 1.5.1:\n\n• Added autopkg make-override commands to the script to reduce the number of warnings produced by the script. This will create local overrides for each of the default applications installed by the script, which will include trust information for these recipes by default. PLEASE read the Autopkg recipe parent trust information page on the Autopkg wiki.\n\nNew in 1.5.0:\n\n• SSL Basic Authentication is now included by default. This will require a trusted certificate already in place on your Server, otherwise, you will need to add a second package with your certificate and a script to have it trusted by the System.keychain.\n\n• Trimmed extraneous lines\n\nNEW in 1.4.0:\n\n• No more running as root!\n\nNEW in 1.3.0:\n\n• Updated deployment technique for Munkireport-php, thanks to A.E. von Bochoven.\n\n• Additional permissions fixes thanks to Keith Mitnick\n\n• Syntactical changes\n\nNEW in 1.2.1:\n\n• Maintenance release, with suggested fixes from Arek Dreyer, Allister Banks and others. Thanks, everyone!\n\nNEW in 1.2.0:\n\n• Switch from direct download from Github of MunkiAdmin and AutoPkgr to install via AutoPkg.\n\n• Inclusion of Nate Felton's python code to download AutoPkg (Thanks Nate!)\n\n• Inclusion of -allowUntrusted for Mountain Lion Developer Tools, presaging the expiry of that particular certificate\n\n• Fix of permissions issue.\n\nNEW in 1.1.0:\n\n• Inclusion of Linde Group's AutoPkgr project, which is replacing Sean Kaiser's notification scripts. This isn't a statement of judgment on the quality of Sean's scripts -- which are amazing -- but rather a statement that you may want a GUI utility with more fiddly bits. I've left Sean's code in if you want a more simple environment, and you can choose to uncomment his code around lines 350 or so. Just uncomment that section.\n\n• Fixes to Documentation and Code Comments.\n\nNEW in 1.0.2:\n\n• Updated Command Line Tools section with changes from Rich Trouton (Thanks Rich!)\n\n• Cleanup\n\nNEW in 1.0.1:\n\n• Integrated better tests and escapes (thanks Elliot Jordan)\n\n• Altered and fixed Developer Tools downloads (thanks Rich Trouton)\n\nNEW in 1.0.0:\n\n• Version: 1.0.0 - Munki 2 & Yosemite!\n\n• Works with Server 4 and OS X 10.10.\n\n• Updated checks with better logic and more comments in the code.\n\nNEW in 0.6.0:\n\n• Version: 0.6.0 - Munki 2 Edition!\n\n• Installs the latest and greatest Munki 2 tools instead of Munki 1. All future builds of Munki in a Box will reference the latest tools.\n\nNEW in 0.4.3:\n\n• Installs Munkireport-php plist to pkgsinfo and adds it to site_default manifest\n\nNEW in 0.4.2:\n\n• MunkiAdmin version is no longer hardcoded into the script. It will pull the latest release.\n\nNEW in 0.4.1:\n\n• Munki install code now based on Choices XML and is version independent.\n\nNEW in 0.4:\n\n• Inclusion of Munki-Enroll and Sean Kaiser's AutoPKG Automation Scripts\n\n• Be sure to change the new AutoPKG Automation settings.\n\nNEW in 0.3:\n\n• Inclusion of Hannes Juutilainen's MunkiAdmin tool via Download & Install\n\n• Correctly working autopkg and munkiimport plist files\n\nIncluded from 0.2:\n\n• AutoPKG is now downloaded from the latest trunk.\n\n• The site_default Manifest is established from the packages passed to autopkg.\n\n• If Munki is not installed, the script grabs the munki tools, mounts the dmg and installs munki_core and munki_admin packages from inside.\n\n• Munki Report is now installed. It still needs to have an admin account created, but it's added and configured. If your site does not load correctly, be sure PHP is active in Server.app"
