        "text": "The apt command is a sophisticated command-line tool that interacts with Ubuntu’s Advanced Packaging Tool (APT) to execute tasks including installing new software packages, updating the package list index, and even upgrading the whole Ubuntu system. Along with this, we can uninstall or remove the downloaded packages from the system. So in this article, we will go through the steps of uninstalling the packages from the Ubuntu system.\n\nThese are some following methods in Linux to delete packages using apt-package manager:\n\nUninstall the program using apt purge\n\nUninstall the program using the apt remove\n\nRemove broken packages or packages which weren’t fully installed\n\nLet’s go through both methods one by one.\n\nGet the List of Installed Packages\n\nsudo apt list\n\nThis command will show you a list of all the packages you’ve installed. You can skip this step if you already know the name of your package.\n\nMethod 1: Uninstall the program using apt purge:\n\nsudo apt purge <package name>\n\nUsing apt to delete packages is the same as using apt-get to install it.\n\nFor this article, we will be going to remove firefox along with its configuration.\n\nMethod 2: Uninstall the program using apt remove:\n\nsudo apt remove <package name>\n\nTo avoid confirmation, you can alternatively use the “-y” option,\n\nsudo apt remove -y <package name>\n\nFor Post uninstall clean Up\n\nsudo apt clean && sudo apt autoremove\n\nclean: Removes the cache of programs that are older than the one that was installed.\n\nautoremove: Removes files that are no longer needed, such as dependencies.\n\nMethod 3: Remove broken packages or packages which weren’t fully installed:\n\nsudo apt clean && sudo apt autoremove sudo apt -f install sudo dpkg --configure -a\n\n-f install: Fix any broken dependencies and any potential package corruption issues.\n\ndpkg –configure -a: Reconfigure an unpacked package and “-a” means all unpacked but configured packages are configured.\n\nWhat’s the difference between ‘remove‘ and ‘purge‘?\n\nYou must be thinking that what’s the difference between the “remove“ command and the “purge“ command. On executing the “remove” command it will keep the package’s configuration files after the uninstallation while the “purge” command will delete the package’s configuration files after the uninstallation."
