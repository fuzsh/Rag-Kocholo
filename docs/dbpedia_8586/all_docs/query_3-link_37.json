You can install a free TeXiFy IDEA plugin. Then start a tex project, which will have a main.tex file, or just create a new LaTeX file in your current coding project. Then copy/paste your TexStudio text, press Command-Alt-L to reformat the file, then copy back.\n\nUnfortunately, the formatting functionality is a bit basic, although you might tinker with the IDE's Code Style settings for LaTeX. Still, it can save time versus manual formatting."
