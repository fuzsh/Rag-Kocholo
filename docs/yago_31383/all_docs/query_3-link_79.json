        "text": "Preface\n\nWorld at Summer, 1127\n\n​\n\nMap from Penguin Atlas\n\nPart One\n\nRus\n\n​\n\nThere were about 20 Principalities at this time. All rulers (they call them “princes”) were descendants of Vladimir Sviatoslavich the Great. The main principality was Kievan, and the ruler of Kiev was called the Grand Prince of Kiev. Vladimir the Great was the Grand Prince in 978-1015.\n\nMost of his sons were killed during the Civil War 1015-1019 years, other died without heirs. So, after 1036 only two branches were still alive: the one branch ruled at Polotsk, another one ruled all other Principalities.\n\nVseslav of Polotsk, the great-grandson of Vladimir, ruled in 1044-1101, and it was the best time of the principality. After his death, his six sons begun fight. The oldest son died in exile without heirs. The second was captured by the Prince of Kiev and died in a prison, his sons fled to Poland.\n\nSo, at summer 1127, four branches ruled in the principality:\n\nPolotsk – Davyd Vseslavich, his son Bryachislav ruled in Lahoysk.\n\nVitebsk – Sviatoslav Vseslavich.\n\nLukoml – Rostislav Vseslavich.\n\nDrutsk – Rogvolod, the grandson of Vseslav.\n\nThe brief history of Kievan branch\n\n​\n\nYaroslav, the son of Vladimir, was the Grand Prince of Kiev in 1019-1054 years. He had six sons (yes, he too).\n\nThe oldest son died while Yaroslav was alive. By Russian traditions, his descendents lost their claims for Kiev – they ruled Halich Rus.\n\nIn 1127 were four descendents:\n\nbrothers:\n\nVolodymyrko (Zvenigorod)\n\nRostyslav (Peremyshl);\n\nand two another brothers:\n\nIvan (Halych)\n\nRostyslav (Terebovl).\n\nThey also were at war often.\n\nVolodymyrko was supported from Hungary, three others – from Kiev, and, maybe, from Poland.\n\nThe second son of Yaroslav, Iziaslav, was the Grand Prince of Kiev in 1054-68 (fled, he returned with Poland’s help), 1069-73 (fled, he returned, when his brother died), 1077-1078.\n\nOne of his son died early, the second one was killed, and the third was the Grand Prince of Kiev in 1093-1113. After his death, some of descendents of Iziaslav were killed in dynastic wars, some were incarcerated, and some died without heirs.\n\nSo, at summer 1127 only two of them, brothers, were alive:\n\nViacheslav Yaroslavich (Kletsk)\n\nYurij Yaroslavich (we don’t know, where he ruled. May be, with brother).\n\nThe third son of Yaroslav, Sviatoslav, captured Kiev in 1073, but he died in 1076.\n\nFrom his five sons two were killed early. Three other:\n\nDavydwas loyal to Kiev, he died in 1123, his sons ruled in Novhorod-Siverskyi.\n\nOlegtried to capture Kiev several times, but he could not. He died in 1115 and firstly his sons ruled in Murom and Ryzan.\n\nYaroslav was the youngest of all brothers and he was still alive in 1127. He ruled in Chernigov from 1123, but in 1127, before summer, Vsevolod Olgovich captured Chernigov and Yaroslav fled to Murom. Vsevolod was had to give Kursk to Kiev to save his new principality.\n\nSo, at summer:\n\nChernigov – Vsevolod Olgovich with brothers;\n\nNovhorod-Siverskyi – sons of Davyd;\n\nMurom – Yaroslav Sviatoslavich.\n\nThe next son of Yaroslav was Vsevolod, but we will see on them some lately.\n\nViacheslav, the son of Yaroslav, died early, his only son was killed in 1078.\n\nIgor, the youngest son, left son, and at summer 1127 his descendent Vsevolod ruled at Hrodno.\n\nNow return to Vsevolod. He was the Grand Prince of Kiev in 1078-1093. His only son Vladimir Monomakh, was the Grand Prince in 1113-1125. He fought against descendents of Iziaslav and against Oleg, the son of Sviatoslav. Vladimir won.\n\nAfter his death, his son Mstislav became the Grand Prince of Kiev and he still ruled all Rus at summer 1127.\n\nHis brothers and sons ruled in principalities:\n\nPereyaslavl – Jaropolk, the brother.\n\nTurov – Viacheslav, the brother.\n\nRostov-Suzdal – Juri, the brother.\n\nVolodimir – Andrey, the brother.\n\nNovgorod – Vsevolod, the son.\n\nSmolensk – Rostislav, the son.\n\nKursk – Iziaslav (the hero of TTL), the son.\n\nSo, now the whole map:\n\nAnd I want to say several words about allies and enemies in Rus and abroad.\n\nAlmost all Russian princes were loyal to Mstislav, except princes of Polock and Volodymyrko of Halich.\n\nMstislav was in very good relations with Denmark and Byzantium.\n\nMagnus, the son of the king of Denmark, was the king of Gothenland and was in war with Swea (Northern Sweden), and Rus supported him.\n\nPoland fought against Rus in 1123 and relations between states were not warm.\n\nHungary also fought against Rus in 1123. Moreover, Hungary supported Volodymyrko of Halich against allies of Kiev. Moreover, in 1127 Hungary begun the war against Byzantium. Mstislav was planning to help Byzantium in next year.\n\nThe Civil war lasted in Germany. The son of Mstislav, Iziaslav (our hero) was married a relative of Conrad Staufen, who was elected as an antiking in December 1127.\n\nIt is a pity, I don’t much about relations of Rus and France, or and England and Spain.\n\nPreface\n\nPart four and last. The West.\n\n​\n\nStephen II ruled in Hungary and Croatia in 1127. He was an ally of Bohemia, the duke Sobeslav married his niece. Stephen was also a close ally of Sicily – he was a nephew of Roger II and he married a princess of Capua. He had one more friend – Volodymyrko of Volyn, Stephen supported him in about 1125-26 and helped save his Principality.\n\nOther neighbors were his enemies.\n\nStephen and Boleslav of Poland invaded Rus in 1123, but the prince, who they supported, was killed. Moreover, in 1125, when Stephen supported Volodymyrko, he quarreled with Mstislav again, because Mstislav supported cousins of Volodymyrko. Boleslav of Poland also supported these cousins – and Stephan attacked Poland too.\n\nVenetia captured Dalmatian seacoast in two wars, 1116-1118 and 1124.\n\nIn 1126, the uncle of Stephan, Almos, fled to Byzantium. In 1127, Stephan invaded Byzantium.\n\nStephan II had no heirs in 1127. Moreover, only four descendants of Stephan the Great were alive in 1127:\n\nStephan II, the king.\n\nAlmos, the uncle of the king, who fled to Byzantium in 1126 and then Stephan II attacked Byzantium.\n\nBela, the son of Almos, who was hidden in an Abbey near the border with Byzantium. Both, Almos and Bela were blinded in about 1114 by Coloman, the father of Stephan II.\n\nBoris, who was the son of Coloman and the daughter of Volodimir Monomakh. Coloman married her in 1112, but in 1113 or 1114 “the queen was taken in the sin of adultery” and was soon sent back to Kiev. She gave birth to her son, Boris, who was living in Rus in 1127.\n\nSobeslav of Bohemia defeated and captured Lothar, the king of Germany in “last year” (1126), but then freed him and became his good, maybe, the best ally. In the same battle, Sobeslav killed Otto II of Olomouc, his rival. The son of Otto II fled to Rus’.\n\nThere were several more princes in Bohemia in 1127.\n\nBretislaus I, who died in 1055, had four sons.\n\nOne died without heirs, second – Vratislaus, had four sons, who were princes of Bohemia one by one. Sobeslav, the Prince since 1125, was the youngest. He had several nephews, who had no power, but one of them, Vladislaus, wanted to became the Duke of Bohemia. His mother, the sister of Poland queen, supported him. So, Sobeslav did not like Poland in 1127.\n\nTwo other sons of Vratislaus ruled in Brno (Conrad) and Olomuc (Otto). Grandsons of Conrad ruled in 1127 in Brno (Vratislaus) and Znojmo (Conrad II). Son of Otto, also Otto was the same Otto of Olomuc who was killed in the battle in 1126 and whose son fled to Rus. Another son of Otto I already died, and his son, Wencealsus, became the Prince of Olomuc in 1125.\n\nIn 1127, the Polish king Boleslaw III was looking for new allies.\n\nHe had quarrel with Germany – about lands near Elba.\n\nHe had quarrel with Rus – because he attacked Rus in 1123 (four years “ago”).\n\nHe had had quarrel with Bohemia since 1125 – because he supported the Pretender and not Sobeslav.\n\nHe had quarrel with Hungary – because Hungary attacked Poland in 1126.\n\nSo, he WAS looking for new allies.\n\nThe civil war lasted in Germany.\n\nLothar, the king and the duke of Saxony, and Henry the Proud, his son-on-law, the duke of Bavaria, were on the one side.\n\nBrothers of Staufen, dukes of Franconia and Swabia, did not recognize Lothar as the king of Germany.\n\nAustria was neutral, the Lower Lorraine, Burgundy and Northern Italy were more independent than German and did not take part in the civil war.\n\nI am not sure about Germany – and I will be thankful, if anybody advises a book about Germany of XII century.\n\nIn France, the king Louis was not the truly king. He had some territories and some strength, but counts of Blois, Anjou and Toulouse had the same power. And the duke of Aquitaine was the most powerful.\n\nChapter One. Year 6635 (1127) [1]\n\nPart One\n\nRus\n\n​\n\nMstislav the Great planned to crash Polock in August of 6635 year.\n\nWe don’t know the exact reason of this campaign. Annals says, that “grandsons of Rogvolod always hated sons of Yaroslav”, but it is only a legend. Probably, Mstislav wanted to control all Rus. Maybe, princes of Polock refused to execute an order.\n\nIn general, it is not too important.\n\nEight armies from all sides of Polock attacked the Principality.\n\nOn august 11, four princes besieged Zaslavl. Iziaslav attacked Lahoysk, his brother Rostislav attacked Drutck, Vsevolod of Chernigov with all his brothers besieged Borisov. [2]\n\nDruck was captured in 1116 – less then ten years “ago”. Town was not be able to fight with Rostislav and opened the gates. Both princes, Rogvolod-Boris and his son Rogvolod-Vasil, were taken prisoner. [3]\n\nBorisov was a small town, and when Rostislav came (on August 13), citizens surrendered too.\n\nWhile other princes besieged Izaslavl and Lahoysk, Vsevolod and Rostislav went to Lukoml and besieged the town on August 15.\n\nIn Polock, citizens organized the veche (a popular assembly). They wanted to expel Davyd, elect a new Prince and sent ambassadors to Kievan forces to ask peace. [4] Davyd attacked the veche and killed many of them. [5]\n\nCitizens of Polock understood that they needed help. Two princes can help – Rostislav of Lukoml and Sviatoslav of Vitebsk. But Vitebsk is placed on Dvina – as same as Polock. Ambassadors were able reach Vitebsk sooner, and stronger army was able sail. Moreover, Vitebsk was not attacked. This means that Sviatoslav had a good relation with Kiev.\n\nIn Lukoml, Rostislav tried to keep moral of his warriors (they thought that Lukoml was too weak for the fighting [6]). The prince fought on walls as a simple warrior, and he was killed on the second day of besieging.\n\nCitizens opened the gates immediately and gave as much silver [7] as they could. It was the win, but the winners were sad. Princes did not like to kill one another, especially a brave one. Rogvolod-Boris, the prisoner of Rostislav, cried over the body of his brother.\n\nIt was August 17. Zaslavl was besieged a week already, and Zaslavl was captured. Town was burned, citizens enslaved. Forces of princes went to Lahoysk.\n\nSviatoslav of Vitebsk came with a strong guard. Citizens of Polock helped him, and Davyd was defeated. Sviatoslav did not want to kill the brother, but the citizens did.\n\nWhen the castle was captured, both, Davyd and his son, were killed.\n\nAmbassadors were sent immediately to all princes and to Kiev.\n\nRogvolod-Boris died, when he knew news.[8]\n\nThe campaign ended.\n\nVsevolod of Novgorod was late.\n\nMstislav approved Sviatoslav as the Prince of Polock. Lukoml was added to Polock, Druck – to Smolensk, Lahoysk – to Minsk.\n\nRogvolod-Vasil was imprisoned in Smolensk.\n\n[1] – thanks to Monopolist. I like the idea to use local numbers of years. Russian annals used Years Form Creating the World. Year 6635 begun Marth, 1 1127 and ended February, 28 1128.\n\n[2] – In OTL, Iziaslav attacked Lahoysk a day early. He captured the Prince – Bryachislav, who went to Polock, and the town surrendered.\n\nIn TTL, Bryachislav had a day to reach Polock or to be far from the enemies. So, Lahoysk tried to fight.\n\n[3] – In OTL princes, probably, escaped to Polock, because they heard that Lahoysk was attacked. In TTL he didn’t hear anything, because Iziaslav executed the order exactly. So, princes were captured.\n\n[4] – in OTL, they were success and the campaign ended. But in TTL Bryachislav and his guard came to Polock, so Davyd had enough forces to fight.\n\n[5] – Yaroslav the Wise did the same way in about 1015.\n\n[6] – It’s a pity, they were right.\n\n[7] – In Rus, the silver is used instead of money sometimes.\n\n[8] – in OTL, he died in half an year."
