        "text": "By combining their efforts in the fight against climate change, the EAEU, SCO, and BRICS could play a key role in achieving the goals of the Paris Agreement: the member states of these international organizations account for more than half of the global population (3.9 billion people), roughly 50.5% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, and almost one third of global GDP. Having adopted ambitious plans for the decarbonization of their national economies, most countries of the EAEU, SCO, and BRICS are leery about abandoning fossil fuels or introducing carbon infrastructure: only Kazakhstan and China have national emission quota trading systems, and South Africa has a carbon tax, where the thresholds per tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent do not exceed USD 10. The global trend of economy decarbonization is helping to harmonize the priorities of business and national governments. Development strategies for production and supply chains are being drafted taking into account the global goals of the Paris Agreement and national plans to reduce emissions and adapt to climate change. Commensurate approaches and the pace of carbon regulation among EAEU, SCO, and BRICS member states will make it possible to build a global carbon regulation system based on an equitable energy transition, including transition technologies, and comply with the principles of the multilateral trading system and technological neutrality. For the EAEU, the convergence of approaches to climate regulation is a long-term priority. As part of this process, it is absolutely crucial for the EAEU to find a balance in the climate and economic interests of its member states with the association’s main trading partners. Another key priority is to avoid tariff and non-tariff barriers associated with climate regulation. How can we ensure a balance between climate and economic priorities, and also avoid barriers in international trade and cooperation? Will market-based carbon pricing mechanisms help achieve climate goals in the SCO, EAEU, and BRICS countries, and what is a fair price for carbon?\n\nModerator\n\nAndrey Slepnev, Member of the Board, Minister in Charge of Trade, Eurasian Economic Commission\n\nPanellists\n\nMaria Bagreeva, Deputy Mayor of Moscow; Head, Department of Economic Policy and Development of the City of Moscow\n\nVladimir Ilichev, Deputy Minister of Economic Development of the Russian Federation\n\nElena Myakotnikova, Member of the Executive Committee, Director of Sustainable Development, RUSAL\n\nAlexander Pankin, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation\n\nKishor Rajhansa, Chief Operations Officer, Global Carbon Council\n\nVyacheslav Fetisov, Deputy of the State Duma of the Federal Assembly of the Russian Federation; Chairman, Russian Society for Nature Conservation (VOOP)\n\nRuslan Edelgeriyev, Assistant to the President of the Russian Federation; Special Presidential Representative on Climate Issues"
