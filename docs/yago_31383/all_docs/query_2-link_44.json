I respect this\n\nwish, and that's why I only mention two cemeteries where Russian aristocrats, artists and musicians are burried:\n\nRoslyn Cemetery, Glen Cove Road (on the corner of Southern Boulevard), Roslyn, Long Island, New York. The cemetery was\n\nfounded in 1860, and has no separate section for Russian deceased. Many Russian-Orthodox crosses are scattered all over\n\nthe cemetery. Since the late eighties one can find the graves of several Russian princes and countesses in the front of\n\nthe cemetery, on the side of Glen Cove Road, left from the main driveway. A while ago a new terrain was opened in the\n\nback of the cemetery, where a special section for Russian deceased will be created."
