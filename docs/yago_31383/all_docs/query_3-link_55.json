His wife Natalia, 53, and their teenage daughter, 18, were found hacked to death with an axe and a knife in their beds. An axe and a knife that supposedly served as murder weapons were lying near the body of Protosenya himself.\n\nThe massacre happened in resort city of Lloret de Mar, Costa Brava, in Spain – a popular destination for Russian tourists. The family owned a house here, although they lived in the past years in Bordeaux in France. Protosenya's 22-year-old son, Fedor, was in Bordeaux at the time of the murders. He didn't go with his family to Spain, and called the police when he couldn't reach them by phone one day.\n\nThe Spanish police suggested tha tragedy could happened amid family conflict (allegedly Protosenya killed his wife and daughter and then hanged himself), though they didn’t rule out a triple murder, with Protosenya’s seeming suicide simply a cover.\n\nMedia outlets reporting on the events at the time noticed a number of strange circumstances surrounding the deaths of the Protosenya family:\n\nThere was a lot of blood at the scene, but no blood at all at on the clothes of Sergei Protosenya, who supposedly hacked his his wife and his daughter to death with an axe and a knife\n\nexperts said that the presumed murderer wore gloves in order not to leave any fingerprints\n\nno notes were left with a confession or explanation of motives for the murder\n\nno cases of family abuse perpetrated by Protosenya had been reported\n\nThe British tabloid Daily Mail spoke with Protosenya's son and friends, and all of them ruled out the possibility that he had killed two women he loved. Fedor Protosenya said his father loved his mother and especially his sister who \"was his princess”.\n\n\"He could never do anything to harm them,” the 22-year-old student said.\n\n“I don't know what happened that night but I know that my dad did not hurt them.”\n\nA close friend of the family, businessman Anatoly Timoshenko, and another friend, Roman Yuravich, also strongly denied that Protosenya could kill his closest relatives.\n\nSergei Protosenya was a multi-millionaire and was regularly included in the list of the 250 richest people in Russia in 2006-2011. He had worked in Novatek starting from 2022, after having initially joined the board of directors in 2005 before leaving the company in 2015. Later, he moved to France.\n\nHe had obtained a Cypriot passport in addition to his Russian citizenship.\n\nVladislav Avayev, former vice president at Gazprombank\n\nJust a day before the murder of Protosenya's family, another similar incident was reported in Moscow on April 18, where the body of the former Vice President for Gazprombank, Vladislav Avayev, 51, alongside the bodies of his wife Elena and their daughter Mariya. were found in their apartment.\n\nThe three were shot to death. According to the preliminary version of the Investigative Committee of Russia, Avayev killed his wife and daughter and then committed a suicide. According to Russian authorities, on the morning of April 18, he called his personal driver and asked him to pick him up, but he didn't open the door. His older daughter came to the apartment in the afternoon and found the bodies. Avaev allegedly had a gun in his hand.\n\nThe driver said his boss was in a good mood just before the murders. He also didn't notice anything strange about him, tabloid StarHit reported.\n\nRussian Telegram channel speculated that the reason for the supposed murder-suicide may have have been an old conflict with his wife, as she supposedly had an affair and was pregnant.\n\nAvayev worked in Gazprombank, the biggest financial institution in the country, controlled by Gazprom, for a long time. His role at the bank was non-public.\n\nHe also served as the deputy director of the department of government affairs in the Kremlin for a while, and in recent years he headed the company Carbonix, a bone-substituting carbon implant producer. The firm's partner is Russian military-industrial conglomerate Rostec, msk1.ru reported.\n\nVasily Melnikov, owner of medical equipment supplier company MedStom\n\nVasily Melnikov, 43, was found dead in his apartment in Nizniy Novgorod, alongside his wife and two small sons (4 and 10 years old) on March 23. The four were killed with a knife, which knives were later found at the scene. The children were in their room and the woman in the bedroom. Melnikov’s neighbors and friends said there was no reason to suspect a possible family conflict.\n\nLocal law enforcement speculated that Melnikov killed his family and then committed suicide.\n\nThe businessmen owned the medical equipment supplier company MedStom.\n\nMikhail Tolstosheya (Watford), a Russian oil oligarch\n\nMikhail Tolstosheya (Watford), 66, was found hanged in his house in England. While UK law enforcement claimed to not have discovered any suspicious circumstances surrounding his death, the motive for suicide was unclear, according to UK tabloid Daily Mail.\n\nWatford made a fortune on Russian oil and gas, then he migrated to the UK in the early aughts. He changed his name and became a real estate mogul following his move. He was not sanctioned by the UK government after the beginning of the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\nHowever, he was found dead on the same day then-Prime Minister Boris Johnson told the House of Commons that he would expand the list of people associated with Vladimir Putin's regime who would be affected by British sanctions. A friend of the family said while commenting on the event to The Sun that his mood could have been affected by war against Ukraine. The outlet's source said: \"His death raises questions. After all the other suspicious deaths of Russian nationals and associates in the UK, it is only natural there will be speculation about his death.”\n\nMikhail Tolstosheya was born in Ukraine (the Ukrainian Soviet Union Republic) in 1955.\n\nAlexander Tyulyakov, a top manager at Gazprom\n\nAlexander Tyulyakov, 61, was found hanged in his cottage in the village of Leninsky, near St. Petersburg, on Feb. 25. The village is known as \"Gazprom's nest\". A suicide note was discovered lying nearby, though its content was not made public. According to reports form the scene, Gazprom security prohibited police from investigating the crime scene. According to the Novaya Gazeta newspaper, he was seen heavily bruised just prior to his death.\n\nLeonid Shulman, a top manager at Gazprom\n\nThe body of Leonid Shulman, 60, was been found a month before the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine began, in the same village of Leninsky near St. Petersburg. He headed the logistics department at the oil giant. Accordingly, his body, covered with stab wounds, was found in \"a pool of blood\" on the floor in the bathroom. A knife was found lying there as well. Allegedly, law enforcement officers discovered a note in which Shulman complained of unbearable pain, the outlet Grani wrote. Shulman was on sick leave after an injury, and had an Ilizarov apparatus installed on his leg. Novaya Gazeta wrote that investigators doubted the authenticity of the suicide note.\n\nSuicides or not? What may this wave of strange deaths mean for the Russian elite?\n\n\"In all cases, there are widespread suspicions that the deaths may have been staged as suicides, but who did this and why?\" Grzegorz Kuczyński, director of the Warsaw Institute's Eurasia Program, asked back in April.\n\nHe speculated some top officials \"could cover up fraud committed in state companies.”\n\n“This idea may be supported by a serious personnel reshuffle in Gazprom,\" Kuczyński added.\n\nPaul Goble, former advisor to the U.S. Secretary of State, commented on this series of strange Russian deaths to Voice of America and Radio Liberty’s Russian service at the end of June. He said \"the events reflect a complete breakdown of the system of values in Russia.\"\n\n\"Not only does the government kill people, but Russians kill Russians for economic gain,” he said.\n\n“The government, disgruntled employees or competitors may be behind the murders.”\n\nGoble also supposed it could be a generational change.\n\n\"Putin's regime is outdated,” he explained.\n\n“Their leader is 70 and he is surrounded by people of the same age. It's time to think about those who will follow in your footsteps. Whom will they pass down their fortunes to? To the next generation. And they want to eliminate everyone who can interfere.”\n\nThe documentary Secrets of the Oligarch Wives. that was released on the Paramount+ streaming service on June 28, also touches on the theme of suspicious deaths of power Russians. It shows the stories of Russian oligarch's partners. and what they witnessed in their proximity to the Kremlin's regime. Russian banker German Gorbuntsov, featured in the documentary, called this wave of mysterious deaths this year \"not a coincidence”.\n\n\"A killer comes up with his own method when he's ordered to take out a family,\" Gorbuntsov said while speaking about the oligarch deaths, according to an English translation.\n\n\"Similar methods but each slightly different—an axe here, a gun there,” he noted.\n\n“They're dead all the same. Once perhaps, twice a coincidence. This is not a coincidence. It's not suicide.”\n\nGorbuntsov also shared the story of an alleged attempt on his own life, that took place after he fled Russia. According to his account, a stranger shot at him near Gorbuntsov’s London home in 2012. The banker suffered six gunshot wounds as a result and slipped into a coma, but managed to survive.\n\n\"What is striking about the 2022 incidents is that none of the deceased oligarchs were known to have made critical public remarks about the invasion of Ukraine,\" German public broadcaster DW wrote in an article covering the deaths.\n\n\"At the same time, none of them were on the international sanctions lists that had been drawn up in the aftermath of the invasion.”\n\nDW wrote that at least 38 Russian oligarchs have been found dead or gone missing in the three years prior to an investigation released by U.S newspaper USA Today in 2017."
