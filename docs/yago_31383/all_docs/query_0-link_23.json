Her father which some give as Emperor Constantine IX Monomachos, is not attested in any reliable primary source.\n\nEupraxia of Kiev, a sister of Vladimir, became notorious all over Europe for her divorce from the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV on the grounds that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body.\n\nIn his famous Instruction (also known as The Testament) to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi. At first he waged war against the steppe jointly with his cousin Oleg, but after Vladimir was sent by his father to rule Chernigiv and Oleg made peace with the Polovtsi to retake that city from him, they parted company. Since that time, Vladimir and Oleg were bitter enemies who would often engage in internecine wars. The enmity continued among their children and more distant posterity.\n\nFrom 1094, his chief patrimony was the southern town of Pereyaslav, although he also controlled Rostov, Suzdal, and other northern provinces. In these lands he founded several towns, notably his namesake, Vladimir, the future capital of Russia. In order to unite the princes of Rus' in their struggle against the Great Steppe, Vladimir initiated three princely congresses, the most important being held at Lyubech in 1097 and Dolobsk in 1103.\n\nWhen Sviatopolk II died in 1113, the Kievan populace revolted and summoned Vladimir to the capital. The same year he entered Kiev to the great delight of the crowd and reigned there until his death in 1125. As may be seen from his Instruction, he promulgated a number of reforms in order to allay the social tensions in the capital. These years saw the last flowering of Ancient Rus, which was torn apart 10 years after his death.\n\nVladimir Monomakh is buried in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the golden age of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Vladimir/Muscovite crown called Monomakh's Cap.\n\nMarriages and children:\n\nVladimir was married three times. His first wife was Gytha of Wessex, daughter of Harold of England who fell at Hastings and Edith Swannesha. They had at least five children:\n\n-Mstislav I of Kiev (1 June 1076 - 14 April 1132).\n\n-Izyaslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Kursk (c. 1077 - 6 September 1096).\n\n-Svyatoslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Smolensk and\n\nPereyaslav (c. 1080 - 16 March 1114).\n\n-Yaropolk II of Kiev (1082 - 18 February 1139).\n\n-Viacheslav I of Kiev (1083 - 2 February 1154).\n\nThe following daughter has been attributed to both the first and the second wife:\n\n-Marina Vladimirovna (d. 1146). Married Leon Diogenes. A pretender to the throne of the Byzantine Empire, claiming to be a son of Romanos IV. Rose to the rank of khan of the Cumans in Ossetia.\n\nThe second wife is considered to have been a Byzantine noblewoman. The Primary Chronicle records her date of death on 7 May 1107. However the Chronicle does not mention her name. They had at least six children:\n\n-Roman Vladimirovych, Prince of Volhynia (d. 6 January 1119).\n\n-Eufemia of Kiev (d. 4 April 1139). Married Coloman of Hungary.\n\n-Eupraxia of Kiev Vladimirovna (d. 1109).\n\n-Agafia Vladimirovna. Married Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of Gorodno.

Her people belonged to the Kipchaks, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.\n\nHowever the Primary Chronicle identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki.

Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misadentified is unclear.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_II_Monomakh\n\nVladimir II Monomach, född 1053 i Kiev i dåvarande Kievriket, död i London den 19 maj 1125, var storfurste av Kievriket från 1113. Han var dotterson till den bysantinske kejsaren Konstantin IX Monomachos. Han blev prins av Smolensk 1077 och prins av Tjernigov 1078. Vladimir fortsatte som sina företrädare att dels hålla samman det kievryska riket, genom att bekämpa de hotande stäppfolken, framför allt polovtserna, dels centralisera den politiska makten till Kiev. Som ett av den fornryska litteraturens viktigaste dokument framstår Vladimirs testamente från cirka 1117, vilket i huvudsak utgörs av en självbiografi och en brevsamling.\n\nVladimir II var gift tre gånger. Han gifte sig år 1074 i London med Gytha av England, född i London 1053. De fick följande barn:\n\nMstislav I, född 1076, furste av Kiev.\n\nIziaslav, född 1077.\n\nSvjatoslav, född cirka 1080.\n\nJaropolk II, född 1082.\n\nVjatjeslav, född 1083.\n\nMarina, född ca 1087.\n\nPrince, Grand Duke of Kiev\n\nFamilj med Gytha\n\nVigsel: omkring 1070 1)\n\nBarn:\n\nMstislav I av Kiev (1076 - 1132)\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKällor\n\n1) Directory of Royal Genealogical Data, Hull, England\n\nWladimir married Storfurstinna av Kiev Gythe Gyda, daughter of Kung av England Harald II Goldwinsson and Unknown, in 1046.\n\nFyrste av Smolensk 1067 - 1094.\n\nFyrste av Chernigiv 1078 - 1094.\n\nFyrste av Pereyaslavl 1094 - 1113.\n\nStorfyrste av Kijev [Kiev] 1113 - 1125.\n\nVladimir (Volodymyr) ble fyrste av Pereyaslavl da hans far, Vsevolod I, døde og støttet sin kusine Sviatopolk som storfyrste av Kijev for å unngå krig mellom de russiske prinsene.\n\nHan ble populær etter sine vellykkede kampanjer (1103-11) mot kumanene, nomadiske innvandrere som var en konstant trussel mot Russland.\n\nHan etterfulgte Sviatopolk som storfyrste da denne døde.

These Greek connections played an important role in his foreign affairs.\n\nEupraxia of Kiev, a sister of Vladimir, became notorious all over Europe for her divorce from the Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV on the grounds that he had attempted a black mass on her naked body.\n\n[edit]Reign\n\nIn his famous Instruction to his own children, Monomakh mentions that he conducted 83 military campaigns and 19 times made peace with the Polovtsi.

Volodar Glebovitj av Minsk var en furste av Minsk tillhörig den så kallade polotskdynastin (eller polovtserna) efter det vitryska staden och furstendömet Polotsk, varifrån den stammade. Han var son till Gleb Vseslavitj av Minsk (död 1119) och Anastasia Jaropolkova. Volodar dog efter 1167, möjligen 1176. Volodars familj hade sedan längre tid varit i strid med storfursten av Kiev, Vladimir Monomach, vilken 1113 (enligt vissa uppgifter 1119) erövrat Minsk från Volodars far. Senare hade polotskdynastins återstående besittningar erövrats av Vladimirs son Mstislav Vladimirovisj och dess medlemmar tvingats i landsflykt till bland annat Konstantinopel. Efter Mstislavs död 1132 föll dock Kiev-riket sakta samman och polotskdynastin kunde återvända till den ryska politiska scenen. Volodar gifte sig den 5 juni 1135 (troligen medan han befann sig i exil i Polen) med Rikissa av Polen, dotter till Boleslav III av Polen och änka efter den danske prinsen och kortvarige svenske kungen Magnus Nilsson av Danmark, vilken året innan stupat i slaget vid Fotevik. Volodar och Rikissa fick dottern Sofia av Minsk, vilken senare gifte sig med Valdemar den store av Danmark. Volodars och Rikissas äktenskap var ett politiskt drag av hennes far riktat mot den dåvarande alliansen mellan Erik Emune av Danmark och Monomachs ättlingar. Sedan ett flertal centrala aktörer i denna konflikt dött och monomachernas ställning i Ryssland kraftigt försvagats föll också grunden för äktenskapet vilket upplöstes i skilsmässa varefter Rikissa gifte om sig med Sverker d.ä. av Sverige.

Volodar Glebovitj av Minsk var en furste av Minsk tillhörig den så kallade polotskdynastin (eller polovtserna) efter det vitryska staden och furstendömet Polotsk, varifrån den stammade. Han var son till Gleb Vseslavitj av Minsk (död 1119) och Anastasia Jaropolkova. Volodar dog efter 1167, möjligen 1176. Volodars familj hade sedan längre tid varit i strid med storfursten av Kiev, Vladimir Monomach, vilken 1113 (enligt vissa uppgifter 1119) erövrat Minsk från Volodars far. Senare hade polotskdynastins återstående besittningar erövrats av Vladimirs son Mstislav Vladimirovisj och dess medlemmar tvingats i landsflykt till bland annat Konstantinopel. Efter Mstislavs död 1132 föll dock Kiev-riket sakta samman och polotskdynastin kunde återvända till den ryska politiska scenen. Volodar gifte sig den 5 juni 1135 (troligen medan han befann sig i exil i Polen) med Rikissa av Polen, dotter till Boleslav III av Polen och änka efter den danske prinsen och kortvarige svenske kungen Magnus Nilsson av Danmark, vilken året innan stupat i slaget vid Fotevik. Volodar och Rikissa fick dottern Sofia av Minsk, vilken senare gifte sig med Valdemar den store av Danmark. Volodars och Rikissas äktenskap var ett politiskt drag av hennes far riktat mot den dåvarande alliansen mellan Erik Emune av Danmark och Monomachs ättlingar. Sedan ett flertal centrala aktörer i denna konflikt dött och monomachernas ställning i Ryssland kraftigt försvagats föll också grunden för äktenskapet vilket upplöstes i skilsmässa varefter Rikissa gifte om sig med Sverker d.ä. av Sverige.

These years saw the last flowering of Ancient Rus, which was torn apart 10 years after his death.\n\nVladimir Monomakh is buried in the Saint Sophia Cathedral in Kiev. Succeeding generations often referred to his reign as the golden age of that city. Numerous legends are connected with Monomakh's name, including the transfer from Constantinople to Rus of such precious relics as the Theotokos of Vladimir and the Vladimir/Muscovite crown called Monomakh's Cap.\n\nVladimir married three times. Some sources cite his first wife as Gytha of Wessex, illegitimate daughter of Harold of England who had fallen at Hastings in 1066 and of Edith Swannesha. Problems exist in that none of the sources citing this are contemporary, and none of the Russian sources cite the name of his first wife as the daughter of Harold Godwinson. They had at least five children: Mstislav I of Kiev (1 June 1076 – 14 April 1132) Izyaslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Kursk (c. 1077 – 6 September 1096) Svyatoslav Vladimirovich, Prince of Smolensk and Pereyaslav (c. 1080 – 16 March 1114) Yaropolk II of Kiev (1082 – 18 February 1139) Viacheslav I of Kiev (1083 – 2 February 1154)\n\nThe following daughter has been attributed to both the first and the second wife: Marina Vladimirovna (d. 1146). Married Leon Diogenes, a pretender to the throne of the Byzantine Empire who claimed to be a son of Romanos IV and who rose to the rank of khan of the Cumans in Ossetia.\n\nMonomakh rests after hunting (painting by Viktor Vasnetsov, c. 1900). Vladimir's second wife, Eufimia, is considered[by whom?] to have been a Byzantine noblewoman. The Primary Chronicle and the \"Testament of Vladimir Monomakh\" record her date of death as 7 May 1107. However the Chronicle does not mention her name. This marriage produced at least six children: Roman, Prince of Volhynia (d. 6 January 1119) Eufemia of Kiev (d. 4 April 1139). Married Coloman of Hungary. Agafia (Agatha). Married Vsevolod Davidovich, Prince of Gorodno. Her husband was a son of David Igorevich, Prince of Volhynia (d. 1113). Yuri (George), later known as Yuri Dolgoruki (d. 15 May 1157). Andrew, Prince of Volhynia (11 July 1102 – 1141).\n\nVladimir's third marriage is thought to have been to a daughter of Aepa Ocenevich, Khan of the Cumans. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the Kipchaks, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.\n\nHowever the Primary Chronicle identifies Aepa as father-in-law to Yuri Dolgoruki, with Vladimir negotiating the marriage in name of his son. Whether father and son married sisters or the identity of intended groom was misidentified remains unclear.\n\n----------------------------\n\nВолоди́мир Все́володович, відомий як Володи́мир Монома́х (давньорус. Володимеръ Всеволодовичь; 1053 — 19 травня 1125) — руський князь із династії Рюриковичів. Великий князь київський (1113-1125). Князь чернігівський (1076—1077, 1078—1094) і переяславський (1094—1113). Син князя Всеволода Ярославича і візантійської княжни Марії (за іншими даними — Анни) з роду Мономахів. Засновник князівської гілки Мономаховичів. Організатор успішних походів проти половців. Учасник Любецького (1097) і Витичівського з'їздів (1100). Розширив руське законодавство, додавши до нього свій «Статут» (бл. 1113). Автор дидактичної праці «Повчання» (бл. 1109). Хрестильне ім'я — Василь. У західній традиції — Володи́мир ІІ.\n\nВолодимир був за життя батька князем у Смоленську й Чернігові, часто заступав його у боротьбі з половцями, виконував дипломатичні місії. Після смерті матері (1067) покинув батьківський дім і став князем ростовським[1]. Це не в останню чергу було обумовлено тим, що в батьківському домі з'явилася мачуха, дочка половецького хана, яка, ймовірно, могла бути одного віку з Володимиром. Неприйняття мачухи, зведених сестер і брата, переросло згодом у ненависть до мачушиних одноплемінників — половців[2].\n\nНаприкінці XI століття укріпився на князюванні в Переяславі. Переяславське князівство найбільше потерпало від нападів половців, і тому Володимир Мономах особливо прагнув припинення князівських міжусобиць та об'єднання сил для боротьби проти нападників. Здобув популярність організацією спільних успішних походів князів 1103 і 1111 роках проти половців. Під час київського повстання 1113 року боярська верхівка запросила Володимира Мономаха на князювання до Києва. Придушивши повстання, Володимир Мономах, проте, змушений був піти на поступки народним масам, видавши закон, за яким зменшив рези (відсотки) за позички і тимчасово трохи полегшив становище закупів, скасував холопство за борги (у розширеній редакції „Руської правди“ ці постанови відомі під назвою Статут Володимира Мономаха).\n\nІніціатор Любецького з'їзду 1097 року, де була проведена радикальна реформа порядку спадкоємства (прийнято засаду прямого родового успадкування замість складної системи сеньйорату та зміни уділів) та Витечівського з'їзду 1100 року. Відновив великокнязівську владу на більшій частині давньоруських земель і тимчасово затримав процес остаточного роздроблення Давньоруської держави. За межами його володінь залишилися тільки Галицька і Чернігово-Сіверська землі та Полоцьк. Володимир Мономах мав своїх посадників і в містах по Дунаю.\n\nБлизько 1070 року одружився з Ґітою, дочкою англійського короля Гарольда II, який загинув у битві з норманами при Гастінґсі (14 жовтня 1066). Ґіта була вивезена близькими у Швецію, а звідти потрапила на Русь. Вона померла 7 травня 1107 року у Смоленську. 1107 року Володимир Мономах одружився з дочкою половецького хана Аепи.\n\nВолодимир Мономах — автор вміщеного в Лаврентіївському літописі «Повчання» своїм дітям — видатного давньоруського літературного світського твору, в якому засуджувалися князівські міжусобиці й закликалося до об'єднання давньоруських земель. В літописі наведено легенду, нібито Володимир Мономах одержав від свого діда по матері, візантійського імператора Костянтина IX Мономаха (звідси походить і його прізвисько) барми і корону, які були символом царської влади.\n\nВолодимир «…був красивий лицем, очі у нього були великі, волосся рудувате й курчаве, чоло високе, борода широка. Зростом він не був особливо високий, але міцний тілом і дуже сильний». На схилі своїх років Володимир Мономах із задоволенням згадував: «От коли я жив у Чернігові, я своїми руками стриножив у лісових пущах десятки три диких коней, та ще й доводилося їздити по степу, то також власноручно ловив їх. Два рази тури піднімали мене разом з конем на роги, олень бив мене рогами, лось ногами топтав, а другий колов, дикий вепр зірвав у мене із стегна меч, ведмідь укусив коліно, а рись один раз, скочивши мені на стегна, звалила разом із конем…». Ніби на підтвердження правдивості цих спогадів, у 1821 році в лісах під Черніговом було знайдено важкий змійовик вартістю у 100 гривень кун, загублений князем під час однієї з мисливських пригод або шаленої скачки до Києва («А з Чернігова я сотні разів скакав до батька у Київ за один день до вечірні»). На думку С. О. Висоцького Мономах єдиний із тогочасних можновладців, який залишив на стінах Софії Київської два графіті: «Господи, поможи рабу своєму Василеві, грішному, поможи йому, Господи» та «Господи, поможи рабу своєму Володимиру на многії літа і дай прощення гріха на день судний», що робить його винятковою особою як з історичного, так і з психологічного погляду.\n\nУ Лаврентіївському, де подано ширшу характеристику Володимира Мономаха, говориться: «І посидів він у Києві на отчім столі тринадцять літ, і в рік 6633 од початку світу Преставився, травня місяця в дев'ятнадцятий день, живши од народження свого сімдесят і три роки. Преставився він на [%D1%80%D1%96%D1%86%D1%96] Альті, коло улюбленої церкви, що її він спорудив великими засобами [%D0%BD%D0%B0 честь Бориса і Гліба]. Сини ж його і бояри однесли його до Києва, і він покладений був у святій Софії коло отця свого». У Татіщева характеристика Володимира Мономаха набагато яскравіша. До того, що «найбільше страшним він був для поганих», додано: («і любили його всі навколишні і підвладні йому. Він не був гордим, не возносився у своїх добрих ділах, а славу і честь за всі побіди воздавав насамперед Богові, на Нього одного надіявся, і за те Бог йому престол помимо інших дарував і багатьох супротивників покорив. До всіх він був милостивим І щедрим на пожертви, у правосудді додержував законів, і хоча винних карав, але більше зменшуючи їх вину і прощаючи. З лиця був гарний, очі великі, волосся рудувате і кучеряве, чоло високе, борода широка, на зріст не вельми великий, але міцний тілом і сильний. У ратях вельми хоробрий і вмілий виладнувати війська. Він багатьох своїх ворогів переміг і покорив, сам же один раз біля Треполя був переможений, про що ніколи згадувати не міг, почасти від жалю за братом Ростиславом, який тоді втопився і якого він вельми любив, а почасти від сорому, що нелад Святополків його до цього спонукав. Володів Руссю 13, а всього жив 73 роки».)\n\nБатько: Всеволод Ярославич — князь переяславський (1054—1073), чернігівський (1073—1076, 1077—1078), великий князь київський (1078—1093).

(28) In 1046 Yaroslav the Wise married a relative, possibly a daughter, of Byzantine Emperor Constantine IX Monomakhos, whose name according to the Byzantine sources was Maria or Anastasia. The couple had a son Vladimir who was born in 1053.\n\nВладимир-Василий Всеволодович, по прозванию Мономах, сын Всеволода Ярославича , один из замечательнейших русских князей Киевской Руси. Родился в 1053 г. При жизни отца был сначала князем в Смоленске, с которым позднее соединил Чернигов. Когда Всеволод умер, киевляне желали видеть Владимира своим князем, но он, соблюдая очередь старшинства, уступил Киев своему двоюродному брату Святополку Изяславичу . Вскоре он должен был оставить Чернигов, занятый другим его двоюродным братом, Святославичем, и удалился на первоначальный \"стол отень\", в Переяслявль. В 1113 г. умер Святополк Изяславич, и Владимир по новым настойчивым просьбам киевлян занял киевский стол, на этот раз нарушив право старшего в роде, Олега Святославича . Мирное население одинаково страдало тогда и от княжеских усобиц, и от нападений половцев. Владимир употребил много усилий на борьбу с теми и другими. Ранние его выступления против половцев были не вполне удачны; так, в 1093 г. он, действуя в союзе с Святополком Изяславичем, потерпел от них двойное поражение - на реке Стугне и при селе Желани. Точно так же не всегда удавались ему сначала и попытки сплотить русских князей для борьбы с общим врагом; благодаря его влиянию, было достигнуто объединение князей на Любечском съезде (1097), но вскоре оно было нарушено, и половцы снова появились на Руси, призываемые самими князьями. С течением времени, однако, усилия Владимира увенчались успехом: он добился того, что после ряда поражений, нанесенных объединившимися русскими князьями (например, на урочище Сутень и при Лубнах), половцы прекратили на время свои набеги. Не раз содействовал Владимир мирному исходу возникавших распрей, являясь, обыкновенно, защитником обиженной стороны. Когда, например, Василько Ростиславич был ослеплен Давыдом Волынским , с согласия киевского великого князя Святополка, Владимир предупредил грозившую стать общей усобицу, убедив князей восстановить нарушенную справедливость наказанием виновника. Эта миротворческая деятельность Владимира принимает особенно широкие размеры с того времени, как он становится великим князем Киевским. Отдельные его мероприятия теперь начинают складываться в определенную политическую систему. Он стремится к сосредоточению в своих руках наиболее важных русских областей, поручая их своим сыновьям; в Новгороде сажает Мстислава, в Переяславле - Святополка, а после его смерти - Ярополка , в Смоленске - Вячеслава , в Суздальской земле - Юрия . Путем брачных связей, а частью и с помощью силы, он подчиняет своему влиянию и более отдаленные земли - турово-пинскую, волынскую и полоцкую. В результате Владимир становится действительно \"старейшим князем\" в Русской земле, который мог направлять на общее дело разрозненные силы удельных князей и страхом наказания удерживать их в повиновении. С другой стороны, в политике Владимира заметно выступает желание закрепить достигнутое объединение владений, а с ним и старейшинство за своим родом, чтобы самую идею старейшинства поставить на более прочное династическое основание. В этих видах он еще при жизни переводит старшего сына своего Мстислава из Новгорода в Белгород, обеспечивая тем возможность передать ему киевский стол, уже по новому порядку. Большое внимание уделял Владимир и внутренней жизни населения, в частности - устройству суда и управления. С его именем, например, связаны вошедшие в состав \"Русской Правды\" постановления о процентах (\"о резе\") и закупах, принятые на созванном им в Берестове съезде \"мужей\" его и Олега Святославича. В его \"Поучении\" детям содержатся разнообразные наставления, явно внушенные ему собственным опытом. Блестящие результаты деятельности Владимира привлекли к нему симпатии населения и окружили его имя в народной памяти особым ореолом. Летописец называет его \"чудным князем\", \"милостивым паче меры\", \"жалостливым\". Название \"Мономах\" он получил, вероятно, по своему делу со стороны матери, которая, по некоторым известиям, была дочерью византийского императора Константина Мономаха. По другому объяснению, он получил это название потому, что, во время похода на генуэзцев, убил на поединке генуэзского князя (мономах-единоборец). Исключительное положение, какое Владимир занял среди русских князей, дало повод к образованию легенды, будто он был венчан на царство митрополитом Неофитом, который при этом возложил на него знаки царского достоинства - венец и бармы, присланные византийским императором. Поэтому и венец московских государей стал впоследствии называться шапкой Мономаха. Владимир умер 19 мая 1125 г. Он был женат три раза; первой его женой была английская королевна Гида Геральдовна. - См.: И. Лашнюков \"Владимир Мономах и его время\" (\"Киев. Ун. изв.\", 1873, № 11); С.

З.\n\nhttps://en.topwar.ru/140945-knyaz-voitel-vladimir-monomah.html\n\nPrince-Warrior Vladimir Monomah\n\nPrince-Warrior Vladimir Monomah 905 years ago, 4 May 1113, in Kiev, called for the reign of Pereyaslavl Prince Vladimir Monomakh. The new Grand Duke during his reign was able to suspend the process of the feudal disintegration of Russia.\n\nCivil wars\n\nThe great Russian prince Yaroslav Vladimirovich, who himself seized power during the bloody strife, set aside a disturbing legacy. Russia was on the verge of collapse. The unit princes tore the country apart. Personal and group interests - the princely, boyar, trade elite of large cities, were placed above the national.\n\nYaroslav, trying to avoid strife, introduced a system of ladder (ladder). The hierarchy of cities and princely thrones was established. The first in rank is Kiev, the second is Chernigov, the third is Pereyaslavl, the fourth is Smolensk, the fifth is Vladimir-Volynsky. All sons received inheritance according to seniority. At the same time, Russia was not divided, remaining a common possession of Yaroslavichi. It seemed that the system is durable. Younger princes are subordinate to the eldest, Kiev, important issues are solved together. Commons are not for eternal use. The great prince of Kiev will die, he will be replaced by Chernigov, and the other princes will move up the stairs. When all the brothers die, the children rule the same way. First, Kiev goes to the eldest sons, the second-ranked sons followed him, etc. However, this system quickly began to disintegrate and caused a whole series of welfare and internecine wars.\n\nKiev after Yaroslav received Izyaslav - the weakest of the brothers Yaroslavichi. Although Svyatoslav and Vsevolod better suited to the role of the Grand Duke. Svyatoslav received Chernigov, Vsevolod - Pereyaslavl, Vyacheslav - Smolensk, Igor - Vladimir-Volynsky. Izyaslav Yaroslavich quickly came under the influence of his entourage and the boyar-commercial elite of Kiev. This led to the ruin of the treasury and increased tax burden on ordinary people. The boyars succeeded, the tiuns who collected taxes, money-usurers, and ordinary people suffered. Nobles from the entourage of Izyaslav cleaned up the hands of the land, the village and the village. The peasants, who yesterday were free tillers, became boyars. \"Russian truth\" changed in favor of the nobility. And then, according to the old laws, it turned out that if the boyar knocks against the rebellious smerd, the truth will be on the side of the common man. According to Russkaya Pravda, death should be avenged by death. \"True Yaroslavichi\" abolished blood feuds and the death penalty, replacing them with vira (fine). Boyars could pay off. And if a simple person breaks the law and fails to pay, he can be sold to pay his debt. Thus, under the Grand Duke Izyaslav Yaroslavich and his son Svyatopolka Izyaslavich, the situation of the common people in the Kyiv region deteriorated sharply. Social justice was violated, which caused a number of popular uprisings.\n\nThe board of Izyaslav, and he twice lost and three times occupied the Kiev table - 1054-1068, 1069-1073 and 1077-1078, was filled with strife and wars with external enemies. In 1054, a horde of Torks, rushing from the Pechenegs, weakened in previous wars with the Rus, came over Rus. The main city of the then southern border system was Pereyaslavl, the lot of Vsevolod Yaroslavich (father of Vladimir Monomakh). A small town lying on the left bank of the Dnieper, protected by high ramparts, a deep moat and oak walls, was among the first to take the blows of steppe inhabitants. As a result, all the childhood and youth of Vladimir Monomakh were spent in military science. He learned to manage personal squad and principality. The prince until the end of his days remained a professional warrior, the leader of the squad, and in case of serious danger and the people's militia. The authority of the prince among the warriors largely depended on his personal skills and military skills. At first, the prince's experienced uncle-wrestlers taught military work - the art of riding, the ability to own any type of weapons. At the time, there was no long maturation. For the first time, Vladimir went on a campaign at the age of thirteen. Having made his way from his native Pereyaslavl to far from the Dnieper to Rostov, through the lands of irreconcilable pagans-Vyatichi. And independently Monomakh began to rule at the age of sixteen in the city of Chernigov, one of the largest cities of Russia. Then he replaced his father in Pereyaslavl. At this time he became famous as a great commander, on whose shoulders lay the defense of the southern borders of Russia. As a result, Prince-Warrior Vladimir Monomakh managed not only to defend the borders of Russia, but also forced the Polovtsy to retreat.\n\nBehind the Torks were Polovtsy. A long war began with this fragment of the ancient Scythian-Sarmatian population of the steppe. In Russia, these steppe dwellers were called Polovtsy from the word \"chaff\", straw - by hair color, Polovtsy were blond-eyed blond. They, like the Pechenegs and the Torks, were not Mongoloids, contrary to the common myth (like the future \"Mongol-Tatars\"). These steppe inhabitants, like the Rus-Russians, were Caucasians, heirs of the Great Scythia.\n\nThe original ladder system was broken very quickly. The oldest of Yaroslavichi, Vladimir, died before his father. After him in Novgorod, his son Rostislav ruled. And Novgorod was a rich city, a center of commerce and crafts. The Grand Dukes Izyaslav and their entourage decided to take Novgorod from Rostislav. Soon Vyacheslav and Igor Yaroslavichi died. According to the ladder, when the brothers die, their sons begin to move up the stairs. And Rostislav’s father, Vladimir, was older than Izyaslav. It turned out that the grand prince's nephew was fourth in the queue at the Kiev table and had to occupy him before his own sons Izyaslav. It is clear that this did not suit Izyaslav, his wife Gertrude and the prince’s inner circle. As a result, the case was turned in such a way that when Yaroslav the Wise made up his series and distributed districts, only five Yaroslavich brothers participated in it (Izyaslav, Svyatoslav, Vsevolod, Vyacheslav and Igor). And Vladimir at this time has already died. Therefore, Rostislav generally falls out of the system of a ladder. In addition, Izyaslav had the opportunity to delete the children of Vyacheslav and Igor from the ladder system. And their destinies - Smolensk and Vladimir-Volynsky passed into the direct control of the Grand Duke.\n\nThus, rogue princes appeared in Russia, that is, without destinies, the possibility of movement along a ladder. Rostislav was given the use of Vladimir-Volyn. So, there was a reason for a new strife. Rostislav was hurt. He - the son of the famous Vladimir Novgorod, became a simple vassal of his uncle, who can be moved at any time, wanted - gave Volyn, wants - selects. And the descendants of Rostislav could no longer claim Smolensk, Pereyaslavl, Chernigov and Kiev. Rostislav made an alliance with the Hungarian king. Soon, King Bela died and Rostislav was under attack. Then he captures Tmutarakan (she was part of the prince of Chernigov), and begins to collect troops. The big war was avoided. The Greeks, concerned about the actions of a desperate prince who could lead a squad to Chersonese, poisoned Rostislav.\n\nHowever, another civil war began. The war of Yaroslavl with the Polotsk prince Vseslav Bryachislavich (Vseslav the Wizard). The warlike Vseslav in 1065 made a raid on Pskov, and in 1067, on the bank of the Cherekhi River, he defeated the army of Prince Mstislav of Novgorod Izyaslavich and occupied Novgorod. Novgorod was partially burned, part of the townspeople was taken prisoner, and the bells were removed from the Novgorod Sophia Cathedral. The bells, icons, and utensils of the Novgorod churches were taken to Polotsk. Three Yaroslaviches came against the Prince of Polotsk and ravaged Minsk. In the battle on Nemiga 3 March 1067, Vseslav was defeated and fled to Polotsk. Yaroslaviches did not equip his pursuit, ravaging the southern part of the Polotsk land. Four months later, Yaroslavichi invited Vseslav to the talks, kissing the cross, which would not do him any harm. However, Yaroslavichi broke the kiss of the cross, seized Vseslav and his two sons. The Polotsk prince was brought to Kiev, where they were put in a “cut” (prison).\n\n1068, the Polovtsy defeated Yaroslavl in the battle on Alta. Kievans demanded Izyaslav horses and weapons, to fight again with the Polovtsy. Izyaslav refused, then 15 September 1068, an uprising broke out, during which the townspeople released Vseslav from the prison and elevated him to the grand throne. Izyaslav fled to Poland, where his nephew Boleslav ruled. Brothers Izyaslav Svyatoslav and Vsevolod did not support him. Grand Prince Vseslav Bryachislavich stayed only seven months. Learning that Izyaslav was returning with the Polish army, Vseslav did not dare to fight and fled. Kievans asked for protection from Svyatoslav and Vsevolod. Yaroslavichi agreed to return his brother to Kiev, provided that he did not bring the Poles and would not avenge the citizens. Izyaslav agreed, but part of the Polish army entered Kiev. In addition, Ahead of Izyaslav and Boleslav, his son Mstislav Izyaslavich arrived in Kiev and tortured many Kievites. Polish troops were bred around the cities, excesses began. In response, the Russians began to kill the Poles and Boleslav led the troops. Izyaslav took Polosk away from Vseslav, having appointed his son Mstislav there first, and after his death Svyatopolk. In 1071, Vseslav expelled Svyatopolk Izyaslavich from Polotsk and returned his inheritance. In the future, the war of Kiev and Polotsk continued.\n\nSvyatoslav and Vsevolod, angered by Izyaslav’s policy, drove him out themselves. In 1073 - 1076 in Kiev, Prince Svyatoslav Yaroslavich reigned. Izyaslav again fled to Poland, but this time Boleslav did not help him and even robbed, reimbursing his previous losses. Izyaslav began to ask for help from Emperor Henry IV and the papal throne. Under the influence of the Pope, Boleslav was forced to make peace with Izyaslav and promise him help. After the death of Svyatoslav, Vsevolod did not lay claim to Kiev and returned it to Izyaslav.\n\nBoard of Vsevolod\n\nIn 1078, a new internecine war began. Their nephews, Oleg Svyatoslavich and Boris Vyacheslavich, rebelled against their uncles, Izyaslav and Vsevolod. Connecting with Polovtsy, they broke Vsevolod on the river. Sozhitse. Vsevolod ran for help to Kiev, returned with Izyaslav. In the decisive battle on Nezhatina Niva princes Izyaslav and Boris died. Kiev throne took Vsevolod, who ruled before 1093 year. Destinations in Russia once again redistributed. The Grand Duke Vsevolod did not offend the sons of the deceased Izyaslav - Svyatopolk left in rich Novgorod, Yaropolk gave all the Western Russia - Volyn and Turov principality. Left bank left for the children of Vsevolod. In Pereyaslavl villages Rostislav, Vladimir Monomakh in Chernigov. At the same time Vsevolod retained the management of Smolensk, Rostov-Suzdal land for Monomakh. Monomakh was the right hand of his father, his main assistant and commander. In fact, he then became the co-regent of the father.\n\nVsevolod was a sensible ruler, but in his old age he was often ill, did little to do business, and the approximate ones used it, the boyars continued to ravage the people. Seeds of contention were sown long ago, so civil wars continued. In 1079, Oleg and his brother Roman moved from Tmutarakan to Kiev again, but Polovtsy killed Roman, and Oleg was given to the Greeks. The fierce struggle with the Prince of Polotsk Vseslav continued. At the turn of 1070 - 1080-s, Vseslav conducted a campaign near Smolensk, after which Vladimir Monomakh conducted a devastating campaign against the Polotsk land, and then a second campaign with the Allied Polovtsy, during which Minsk was captured. At the beginning of the 1080s, two winter campaigns were conducted against the tribal alliance of Vyatichi. The land of the Vyatichi was finally incorporated into the Chernigov principality. The persistent and difficult war with the Polovtsy continued.\n\nAccording to the calculations of the historian S.M. Solovyov, as far back as the reign of his father, Vladimir Monomakh conducted successful battles with the Polovtsy 12. Almost all on the border of the Russian land. These battles gave him the military glory and love of the people, who saw in the young prince a loyal defender of the land from the invasions of the steppe people and the opponent of princely strife who had ruined Russia no worse than the Polovtsy. Monomah was a real warrior prince. As he himself wrote in the Instruct: “All my trips were 83, and I don’t remember the rest of the small ones. With the Polovtsian princes, I concluded the world of 19 once during my father and after my father ... ” Over three decades - half his life, Vladimir had to spend in Pereyaslavl. There was then no hail in Russia that would so often be attacked by the steppe inhabitants. It was here that Monomakh understood the vital necessity of the unity of all the military-economic forces of the Russian state in order to repel an external threat.\n\nMeanwhile, four more rogue princes grew up and matured in Russia: the son of Smolensk, Igor Davyd, and the children of the poisoned Rostislav - Rurik, Volodar and Vasilko. Davyd and Volodar seized Tmutarakan, expelling the grand prince's posadnik. But at the same time, power in the Byzantine Empire changed. The power was seized by the cunning and unprincipled Alexey Comnenus. He continued the Roman (Byzantine) policy toward Russia - to create the appearance of friendship and constantly harm. The emperor freed Prince Svyatoslavich from exile, cared for him, and concluded a secret alliance. Oleg pleaded vassal of Byzantium and for this he received material assistance, ships and soldiers. He suddenly landed in Tmutarakan and captured her. His relatives Davyd and Volodar expelled.\n\nDavyd Igorevich seized Olesha at the mouth of the Dnieper, where he passed a trade route along the Dnieper from Kiev and to Kiev, robbed the city. And Rurik, Volodar and Vasilsko Rostislavichi scored squads from various freemen, waited until Uncle Yaropolk Izyaslavich left Vladimir-Volynsky, and captured the city. Grand Prince Vsevolod sent to restore order Monomakh, Rostislavich fled. At the same time, the Grand Duke of All Russia, Vsevolod, tried to solve the matter in peace. He gave Davyd Dorogobuzh in Volyn, Rostislavich allocated Carpathian cities - Przemysl, Cherven and Terebovl. Restored the rights of Svyatoslav's sons, Davyd gave up Smolensk, for Oleg recognized Tmutarakan. But the world has not come. So, Oleg, who was under the auspices of Byzantium, did not reckon with the Grand Duke. His Greek wife considered herself an \"arthoness of Rus.\"\n\nYaropolk Izyaslavich, who returned Volyn, and did not think to be grateful. Joined the alliance with Poland. He was going to secede from the rest of Russia, and the pope was to proclaim him king. Then Poland and Rome were supposed to help Yaropolk seize Kiev, where Izyaslavichi supported the Moscow boyars. When the Grand Duke was informed about the betrayal, he sent Monomakh to Volyn. Yaropolk did not accept the fight, fled to Poland. Abroad, he did not receive support. The Polish king was engaged in a war with the Pomorians and Prussians. Taking advantage of the plight of Poland, the Germans also opposed it. As a result, Yaropolk repented and was forgiven. Volyn returned. But soon Yaropolk killed his own retainer. The destiny of the murdered Yaropolk the Grand Duke divided. Svyatopolk Izyaslavich, from whom Novgorod was taken, was given only the Turovo-Pinsk principality, and Volyn was given to Davyd Igorevich.\n\nIn 1093, Vsevolod died and the metropolitan boyars called not the best commander and co-ruler of Grand Duke Monomakh to the Kiev table, and his cousin Svyatopolk Izyaslavich, who in Novgorod was famous for money and greed. True, they invited him legally, the stairs he was the eldest prince. The boyars did not want to be under the strong and tough hand of Monomakh. Vladimir reigned in Pereyaslavl and Chernihiv with a firm hand, and the Kiev boyars knew this. Vladimir could take the capital Kiev by force and get the full support of the people, but did not do that. On ladder the primacy belonged to the children of the eldest of Yaroslavich, Izyaslav, and of them only Svyatopolk survived. Vladimir gave way and went to Chernigov.\n\nWikipedia\n\nhttp://genealogics.org/getperson.php?personID=I00027049&tree=LEO\n\nAKA = Monomach ? _ http://fi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kiovan_Ven%C3%A4j%C3%A4 _\n\nn 1053-1125\n\nhtt"
