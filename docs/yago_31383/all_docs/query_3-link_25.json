        "text": "Edited by Victor Spinei and George Bilavschi In order to institute the Florilegium project, we approached several notable scholars in Europe and America, and we were glad to find out that our initiative was welcomed. In the special case this introduction refers to, the promptitude of his response to the dialogue we initiated in order to carry out the anthology project, and moreover, the value and diversity of the studies he offered account for the fact that the personality chosen to open the series was the eminent American mediaevalist Charles J. Halperin. He is known in the world of specialists mainly for his substantial investigations of the impact the great Mongol invasion had on Eastern Europe. The American colleague was not as ready to co-operate when he was asked to reveal certain biographical details. He was not very forthcoming in that respect, so we cannot mention too many details in regard to his career. In exchange, the list of his publications is quite telling as to the large range of the topics he has dealt with over the years. Charles J. Halperin was born on 21 July 1946 in New York City, and he studied history at the Brooklyn College, Brooklyn, N.Y., between 1963 and 1967. He continued his education in his native city, at the Columbia University, where he also completed his doctoral thesis on a subject of Russian history. As a graduate student, he benefited from a research stay in the Soviet Union in 1971-1972, by means of the scholarships he received from the International Research and Exchanges Board and the Fulbright Hays Fellowship. For him it was a good opportunity to get more familiar with the Russian language and with the writings of Russian scholars. In 1972 he became an assistant professor at the Department of History of the Indiana University at Bloomington, Indiana, where he taught Russian history until 1980. In 1980-1982 he was a senior fellow at the Russian Institute of the Columbia University. It was during that period, more exactly in the autumn of 1981, when he returned to the Soviet Union for research, within the framework of an agreement of scientific collaboration. As he was unable to get another position at a university, for several years he had to work as a computer instructor, computer programmer and system analyst, until 1996, when he returned to Bloomington, where he later received a Visiting Scholar’s position at the Russian and East European Institute of Indiana University, where he still works at present. That position carries no responsibilities, but does offer him some library and computer conveniences. So, with a shade of self-irony, Charles J. Halperin still defines himself as an “independent scholar”. It is regrettable that no university has found it a way of taking advantage of his remarkable scientific potential, to the benefit of the education process. No matter what professional position he held, Charles J. Halperin remained true to what he was mainly preoccupied in his youth, namely with the relationship of the Mongols with the Russian principalities. On that problem - with vast implications, both synchronically and diachronically -, he wrote two 8 A CHINGISSID SAINT OF RUSSIAN ORTHODOX CHURCH fundamental books: Russia and the Golden Horde: The Mongol Impact on Medieval Russian History (Bloomington, IN, 1985), and The Tatar Yoke (Columbus, OH, 1986). They remain reference books, and they still are helpful, although two decades have passed since their publication. Charles J. Halperin has also published a series of studies on the same subject. In them he shows solid documentation, keen interpretation, and minute analysis of complex and controversial problems, for which he found credible solutions. His studies are of real importance not only for the history of the Mongols and of Russia, but also for the history of the whole eastern half of Europe. The present volume provides a selection from the rich range of works by Charles J. Halperin. Unfortunately, we have not been able to include other valuable articles by the same author. Our hope is that the present anthology will be received with interest by specialists not only in Romania, but also in other countries where there is major interest in the history of the Golden Horde and of mediaeval Russia. The editors of this anthology wish to address their cordial thanks to the American and European publishing houses which first published the articles of this volume, and which kindly agreed to allow republication by Publishing House of the Romanian Academy. Victor SPINEI (Translated by Adrian PORUCIUC)\n\nTsar Simeon Bekbulatovich was the nephew of Ivan IV’s second wife, Mariia Temriukovna. He was a Chingissid who had a remarkable career, first, as khan of Kasimov, then after entering Muscovite service, as head of the Muscovite army’s “main regiment”, as grand prince of Rus', and as grand prince of Tver'. He also married Anastasia Ivanovna Miloslavskaia. Finally he was tonsured as the monk Stefan and was buried in the Simonov Monastery. The episode that has attracted the most attention in the sources and in the scholarly literature was his appointment as grand prince of all Rus' between September 1575 and September 1576. Ivan IV held on to his other titles, including tsar of Kazan' and Astrakhan', but he also acquired an estate as the prince of Moscow under Grand Prince Simeon. In this article, I classified the primary source testimony into two categories: those accounts contemporary to the time of Ivan IV and those written after his death in 1584. After analyzing them and comparing them with the various historiographical explanations, I proposed that Ivan IV placed Simeon on the grand princely throne of Rus' as a legal maneuver to allow him to go after certain individuals in the ruling elite who he thought were plotting against him. These individuals who he suspected were mostly former members of the oprichnina. Ivan had claimed to the metropolitan in 1565 that he was being prevented from investigating and punishing certain individuals and again to foreigners in 1575 about the perfidiousness of his subjects. By having someone else serve as grand prince of Rus' who would give him the go ahead, he would be freed from constraints on his actions."
