Her name was probably given after High Duchess Viacheslava of Novgorod, wife of Bolesław IV the Curly, the ruling High Duke of Poland; with this gesture, Duke Mieszko III maybe showed an expression of warming relations between him and his brother the High Duke.\n\nLifeAround 1167, Wierzchoslawa Ludmilla married with Frederick, Lord of Bitsch, second son of Duke Matthias I of Lorraine. The union was arranged by Frederick's maternal uncle Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor during a visit to Poland; thanks to this wedding, Mieszko III gained important allies among his western neighbors.\n\nDuring her marriage, Wierzchoslawa Ludmilla bore her husband nine children, five sons —\n\nFrederick (who succeeded his father as Duke of Lorraine),\n\nMatthias (later Bishop of Toul),\n\nPhilipp (Lord of Gerbéviller),\n\nThierry (Lord of Autigny) and\n\nHenry (Lord of Bayon)— and four daughters —\n\nAgatha (Abbess of Remiremont),\n\nJudith (Countess of Salm),\n\nHedwig (Countess of Zweibrücken) and\n\nCunigunde (Duchess of Limburg)—.[1]\n\nWierzchosława Ludmilla became in the contact between the French and Polish artistic representatives. One of the theories about the build of the famous Gniezno Doors stated that thanks to her efforts, around 1180 the Doors came to her father's court.[2]\n\nAfter years of disputes between Frederick and his brother Duke Simon II of Lorraine, in 1205 he finally abdicated and entered in a monastery. Then Frederick became in the Duke of Lorraine and Wierzchosława Ludmilla in his Duchess consort. However, their reign was short-lived: one year later, in 1206 Duke Frederick I died. Wierzchosława Ludmilla returned to Poland after the death of her husband, and remained there until her own death, around 1223.[3]\n\nHer husband:\n\nFrederick I, Duke of Lorraine\n\nFrom Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\n\nFrederick inherited it all nevertheless, but died a year later and it went to his son by Wierzchoslawa Ludmilla (1150–1223), daughter of Mieszko III the Old, duke of Greater Poland and high duke of all Poland, and Elisabeth, daughter of Prince Álmos. Their children were:\n\nFrederick, his successor in Lorraine\n\nThierry the Devil (le Diable), lord of Autigny\n\nHenry the Lombard, who built the castle of Bayon\n\nPhilip (d. 1243), lord of Gerbeviller\n\nMatthias (1170-1217), bishop of Toul\n\nAgatha (d. 1242), abbess of Remiremont\n\nJudith, married Henry II, Count of Salm\n\nHediwge (d. 1228), married George, Count of Zweibrücken\n\nCunigunda, married Waleran III of Limburg\n\nFMG: The Chronicon Polono-Silesiacum refers to, but does not name, the daughters of Mieszko III, naming (third in the list) \"dux Lothoringie Fredericus, nepos imperatoris\" as his son-in-law. The Chronicle of Alberic de Trois-Fontaines names \"Virgotslavia\" as one of the sisters of \"duces Guenesie Odoiscius…Logeslaus\", specifying that she was mother of \"ducis de Nanceio\". This marriage was arranged by Ferry's maternal uncle Emperor Friedrich \"Barbarossa\" during his visit to Poland in 1167. She returned to Poland after her husband died.\n\naus dem Hause der Piasten"
