        "text": "Bad times for the oligarchs! Since the beginning of the war in Ukraine, this almost exclusively male group of Russian great fortune holders no longer knows which way to turn as they try to save their vast fortune. Here by selling their shares in a group on the quiet without knowing who the new owner really is; there by passing them on to relatives or managers of their business. But as the atrocities of the Russian military against civilian populations in Ukraine continue, the list of those sanctioned continues to expand, in some cases to the wives and children of the oligarchs, who so far were not touched.\n\nA sign that times are difficult: even Switzerland has resignedly agreed to follow the international wave of sanctions, when it had until now opened its banks wide, pledged its neutrality and made an armada of professionals available to Russian billionaires to fulfil their desires. Admittedly, efforts remain sluggish. To date, only CHF 6.3 billion (USD 6.31b) of Russian assets have been seized in Switzerland, including some luxury properties. This is little compared to the estimates provided by the Swiss Bankers Association (SBA), which speaks of CHF 150 to 200 billion (USD 214 billion) deposited in Swiss institutions. There is also some confusion as to which of the cantons or the State Secretariat for the Economy should take the initiative to freeze assets. The latter has published a memorandum. In Europe and the United States, taskforces and initiatives have been set up to hunt down the oligarchs’ assets, in the hope of drying up Putin's war machine and stirring up opposition within the Russian elite. Switzerland seems hesitant: at the beginning of April, a first contact would have taken place with the EU and G7 taskforce according to the FDFA, since then no news.\n\nThe hunt promises to be long and difficult. With virtually unlimited means, the oligarchs have become masters in the art of concealing their fortunes, whether this means damage limitation during a costly divorce or escaping prosecution and sanctions. They can count on the valuable help of lawyers, fiduciaries and banks, which provide trusts or offshore arrangements that are much more complex than Russian dolls. Switzerland offers best-in-class “facilitators” of corruption, a perfect blend of competence and discretion.\n\nThe Research\n\nDespite this opacity, Public Eye has decided to scrutinise the connections of some thirty oligarchs with Switzerland. These people were selected according to different criteria: their proximity to the regime or their long-standing friendship with Vladimir Putin; their economic weight, also in strategic sectors for the Russian state such as commodities; their ability to obtain public contracts, as well as their contribution to major Kremlin projects. Among these high-profile figures, some have so far passed under the sanctions radar, such as the steel baron Vladimir Lisin. Our list also includes some “outsiders”, such as the warmonger Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia whose hidden fortune has been the subject of several independent journalistic investigations, as well as close associates of Vladimir Putin who play a more hidden role.\n\nBe they enthusiastic or tacit sponsors of the Kremlin's militaristic and imperialist policies, they all fuelled Putin's war machine. And they have all made sweet Helvetia one of their favourite support bases. The footprint they have left in Switzerland is therefore the decisive criterion for their inclusion in this survey.\n\nTypology of the Oligarchs\n\nThe research also allowed to draw up a typology of the way in which these individuals have become richer (see “Russian Wealth: A User's Guide”). Their respective careers are peppered with dark chapters, criminal proceedings and, in some cases, bloody settling of scores. Oil, aluminium, fertilisers, most oligarchs took advantage of the collapse of the Soviet Union to acquire shares in state companies at low cost, to the detriment of the Russian population, which was then suffering all types of deprivations. The paths are diverse, but all of them benefited, at the start of their career, from solid support: links with the governor of a region or a plant manager; support from a minister, secret partnership with a senior civil servant; arrangements with the mafia, etc. Wild privatisations and economic chaos enabled them to push competitors aside and take control of the privatisation vouchers that had been distributed to the population.\n\nLater, with the rise to power of Vladimir Putin in 2000, there was a second wave of oligarchs. The cards were redistributed in the hydrocarbons sector, and fortunes were also been made in construction, agribusiness and telecommunications. They second-wave oligarchs are often men with a KGB background, or who have simply had the chance to be among the old Saint Petersburg comrades of the Russian president, who knows a thing or two about male bonding.\n\nFor three decades, Switzerland has offered an ideal and very little regulated environment for Russian wealth.\n\nGeneva, Zug and Lugano in particular are major hubs for commodity traders. Opening a bank account; registering a trading company owned by an offshore company or front men; hiding behind a trust or foundation to conceal the real beneficial owner; acquiring a luxurious property through a relative: all of this is almost child's play. Switzerland has so far offered the dream of paying less tax and discreetly and legally safekeeping profits outside of Russia.\n\nThe information we have compiled stems both from open (see list below) as well as confidential, and sometimes exclusive, sources. We have scoured companies, trading houses, non-profit foundations and other entities registered between Geneva and Zug that are in the orbit of billionaires close to Putin. And we have included the real estate they own.\n\nRegarding wealth, we have chosen to indicate the estimates published in 2021 by Forbes magazine. These figures have recently been revised downwards for the most prominent Russian billionaires who, cornered by the sanctions, have sold or transferred part of their assets to third parties. Due to the opacity surrounding their affairs, our mapping is far from complete. It provides however an image of the situation at this moment in time, that is to say two months after the start of the war in Ukraine. Public Eye will add provide updates as regularly as possible.\n\nRussian Wealth: A User's Guide\n\nRussia is the most unequal country in the world: 1% of the population controls 58.2% of national wealth. The colossal fortunes of the oligarchs have been built by the privatisations and the power shifts.\n\nIn 1992, after having privatised small businesses and services, the government of President Boris Yeltsin launched the second wave of privatisations by distributing “vouchers” to the population. This was to allow anyone to become a shareholder in privatised companies. All over the country, young people with ambition who had already embarked on the adventure of “cooperatives” (the first form of private property in the days of the USSR) sensed a good business deal. With the help of factory managers, local officials or the mafia, they managed to buy up all these vouchers, quickly finding themselves sitting on top of considerable fortunes.\n\nThe next stage took place in the mid-1990s, when Boris Yeltsin, already unwell and unpopular, wanted to secure his re-election. The Russian state, on the verge of bankruptcy, adopted the highly controversial “loans for shares” scheme. To obtain cash, the Government pledged stakes in the most lucrative Russian companies. A small caste called the Semibankirchtchina – seven extremely wealthy young bankers who had entered the Kremlin – played the lenders. The State would never repay these loans and the lenders, already called “oligarchs”, took over, at very low cost, entire sectors of the Russian economy, in particular oil, metal and minerals.\n\nThe rise of Vladimir Putin redistributed the cards. The former KGB officer instructed oligarchs to stay away from politics, to finance certain major Kremlin projects and to submit themselves to the “power vertical”. The Yeltsinian oligarchs, some of whom were arrested or forced into exile, were gradually replaced by businessmen from the secret services or former comrades of the Russian president. It only took a few years for them to become billionaires, with substantial help of state contracts that made their empire flourish."
