        "text": "This article is about the Grand Prince of Kiev. For the Russian submarine, see Russian submarine Yury Dolgorukiy. For the princely family of Dolgorukov, see Dolgorukov (disambiguation).\n\n\"Yuri I\" redirects here. For the king of Galicia-Volhynia, see Yuri I of Galicia. For the human-powered helicopter, see NASG Yuri I.\n\nYuri I Vladimirovich (Russian: Юрий Владимирович), known under his soubriquet Yuri Dolgorukiy (Russian: Юрий Долгорукий, literally \"Yuri the Long-Armed\"; also known in various accounts as Gyurgi, Dyurgi, or George I of Rus), (c. 1099 – 15 May 1157) was a Russian Rurikid prince and founder of Moscow. He reigned as Velikiy Kniaz (Grand Prince) of Kiev from September 1149 to April 1151 and then again from March 1155 to May 1157. Yuri played a key role in the transition of political power from Kiev to Suzdal following the death of his elder brother Mstislav the Great.\n\n[]\n\nAccording to Vasily Tatishchev Yuri was born on 1090 which makes him a son of Vladimir Monomakh's first wife Gytha of Wessex, a daughter of Harold Godwinson. However according to the \"Testament of Vladimir Monomakh\" the Gyurgi's mother died on May 7, 1107, while Gytha died on March 10 and probably in 1098. Thus, Yuri Vladimirovich could have been a son of his father's second wife Yefimia, and was born between 1095/97 and 1102. Although his birthdate is uncertain, some chronicles report that Yuri's elder brother, Viacheslav, said to him: \"I am much older than you; I was already bearded when you were born.\" Since Viacheslav was born in 1083, this pushes Yuri's birth to c. 1099/1100.\n\nAlso there is version that his son Andrei Bogolyubskiy was born around 1111. It is doubtful that Yuri at that time was younger than 16 or 17.\n\nThe question of Yuri's birthday still remains open. The date can be approximated sometime to 1090s.\n\nActivities in Rostov and Suzdal[]\n\nIn 1108, Yuri was sent by his father to govern in his name the vast Rostov-Suzdal province in the north-east of Kievan Rus'. In 1121, he quarrelled with the boyars of Rostov and moved the capital of his lands from that city to Suzdal. As the area was sparsely populated, Yuriy founded many fortresses there. He established the towns of Ksniatin in 1134, Pereslavl-Zalesski and Yuriev-Polski in 1152, and Dmitrov in 1154. The establishment of Tver, Kostroma, and Vologda is also popularly assigned to Yuri.\n\nIn 1147, Yuri Dolgoruki had a meeting with Sviatoslav Olgovich in a place called Moscow. In 1156, Yuri fortified Moscow with wooden walls and a moat. Although the settlement probably existed earlier, Dolgoruki is often called \"The Founder of Moscow\".\n\nStruggle for Kiev[]\n\nFor all the interest he took in fortifying his Northern lands, Yuri still coveted the throne of Kiev. It is his active participation in the Southern affairs that earned him the epithet of Dolgorukiy, \"the long-armed\". His elder brother Mstislav of Kiev died in 1132, and \"the Rus lands fell apart\", as one chronicle put it. Yuri instantaneously declared war on the princes of Chernigov, the reigning Grand Prince and his brother Yaropolk II of Kiev, enthroned his son in Novgorod, and captured his father's hereditary principality at Pereyaslav of the South. The Novgorodians, however, betrayed him, and Yuri avenged by seizing their key eastern fortress, Torzhok.\n\nIn 1147, Dolgorukiy resumed his struggle for Kiev and two years later he captured it, but in 1151 he was driven from the capital of Rus by his nephew Iziaslav. In 1155, Yuri regained Kiev once again. His sudden death, however, sparked anti-Suzdalian uprising in Kiev. Yuri Dolgoruki was interred at the Saviour Church in Berestovo, Kiev, but his tomb is empty.\n\nMarriages and children[]\n\nThe Primary Chronicle records the first marriage of Yuri on 12 January 1108. His first wife was a daughter of Aepa Ocenevich, Khan of the Cumans. Her paternal grandfather was Osen. Her people belonged to the Kipchaks, a confederation of pastoralists and warriors of Turkic origin.\n\nHis second wife Helena survived him and moved to Constantinople. Her paternity is not known for certain but Nikolay Karamzin was the first to theorise that Helena was returning to her native city. She has since been theorised to be a member of the Komnenos dynasty which ruled the Byzantine Empire throughout the life of Yuri. She has been tentatively identified with Helena Komnene, a daughter of Isaac Komnenos. The identification would make her a granddaughter of Alexios I Komnenos and Irene Doukaina.\n\nYuri had at least fifteen children. The identities of the mothers are not known for certain\n\nThe following are considered elder children and usually attributed to the first wife.\n\nRostislav Yuryevich, Prince of Pereyaslavl (d. 6 April 1151).\n\nIvan Yuryevich, Prince of Kursk (d. 24 February 1147).\n\nOlga Yuryevna (d. 1189). Married Yaroslav Osmomysl.\n\nAndrei I Bogolyubsky (c. 1111 – 28 June 1174).\n\nMaria Yuryevna. Married Oleg Sviatoslavich, Prince of Novhorod-Siverskyi.\n\nSviatoslav Yuryevich (d. 11 January 1174).\n\nYaroslav Yuryevich (d. 12 April 1166).\n\nGleb of Kiev (d. 1171).\n\nBoris Yuryevich, Prince of Belgorod and Turaŭ (d. 12 May 1159).\n\nMstislav Yuryevich, Prince of Novgorod (d. 1166).\n\nVasilko Yuryevich, Prince of Suzdal (deposed in 1161).\n\nThe following are considered youngest and typically attributed to the second wife\n\nMikhail of Vladimir (d. 20 June 1176).\n\nVsevolod the Big Nest (1154 – 12 April 1212).\n\nDavid Yuryevich.\n\nYaropolk Yuryevich.\n\nAncestors[]\n\nMemorials[]\n\nMuscovites have cherished Yuri's memory as the legendary founder of city. His patron saint, Saint George appears on the coat of arms of Moscow slaying a dragon. In 1954, a monument to him designed by sculptor Sergei Orlov was erected on Moscow's Tverskaya Street, the city's principal avenue, in front of the Moscow municipality.\n\nDolgoruki's image was stamped on a medal \"In commemoration of Moscow's 800th anniversary\", introduced in 1947.\n\nThe nuclear submarine Yuri Dolgoruki is named after him.\n\nSuccession[]\n\nYuri Dolgorukiy\n\nRurikovich\n\nBorn: 1099 Died: 15 May 1157 Regnal titles Preceded by\n\n?
