Furthermore, device configuration is blocked, if the environment does not allow it.\n\nAdded:\n\nScript to change the user Hyperion is executed with.\n\nTo run Hyperion with root privileges (e.g. for WS281x) execute\n\nsudo updateHyperionUser -u root\n\nGif effects can source Gifs via URLs in addition to local files as input\n\nSystem info screen: Added used config path and \"is run under root/admin\"\n\nLED-Device enhancements\n\nWS281x: Ensure that a device cannot be configured via the UI when Hyperion is not run with root privileges\n\nNanoleaf: Support discovering additional Nanoleaf devices, e.g. Shapes\n\nNanoleaf: Ability to restore state when Hyperion stops streaming\n\nNote: In case previous state was a dynamic/temporary effect, the state cannot be restored\n\nNanoleaf: New Feature: allow to overwrite brightness by Hyperion\n\nChanged:\n\nThe Systemd/Upstart/System-V-Init service registers Hyperion under the name hyperion instead of hyperiond, as this has caused confusion among users in the past.\n\nWLED and UDP-Raw: Limit maximum LEDs number to 490\n\nWS281x: Update DMA default as per rpi_ws281x recommendation\n\nSmoothing is paused when no input source is available (to save resources)\n\nDisable LED update streaming, if LED updates are not required, Sync.

BobLight can feed Priorities [2-253], default is still 128 (#1269)\n\nAmlogic grabber: Limit grabber to 30fps during discovery\n\nAmlogic grabber: Continuous image feed even when paused (to not have LEDs switched off), plus no delay when pausing/unpausing\n\nFixed:\n\nFixed that Smoothing with \"Continuous Updates\" disabled does not provides LED updates (#1068, #1240)\n\nFixed Issue Blinking / flickering cursor with QT screen capture on Windows (#1328)\n\nFixed Colour effect priority is not deleted when Colorpicker is open (double click on delete is required)\n\nFixed reuse local SSDP address (#1324)\n\nExclude FB Grabber on Amlogic platform, as FB is included in Amlogic Grabber\n\nEscape XSS payload to avoid execution (#1292)\n\nInclude libqt5sql5-sqlite packaging dependency\n\nFixed embedded Python location (#1109)\n\nLED-Devices\n\nFixed Philips Hue wizard (#1276)\n\nFixed AtmoOrb wizard\n\nFixed that Lightpack device does not core when lack of permissions error (LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS)\n\nFixed Atmo/Karate LED count constraint handling\n\nFixed Hue, Disable LED general options (HW Led count & RGB Byte order) as calculated\n\nFixed SPI, Tpm2.Net - Memory issues\n\nFixed: Nanoleaf does not turn on\n\nFixed LED layout - Additional parameters for classic layout were not saved (#1314)\n\nFixed Network LED-Device UI: Trigger getProperties for the configured host, when no hosts were discovered\n\nRemoved:\n\nSmoothing: Removed \"Continuous Updates\" flag as it is obsolete.\n\nIn case an LED-device requires continuous updates, use the LED-Device's \"Rewrite Time\" parameter.\n\nThe focus of this release is on user experience.\n\nWe tried as much as possible supporting you in getting valid setup done, as well as providing enough room for expert users to tweak configurations here and there.\n\nThe reworked dashboard provides you now with the ability to control individual components, jump to key configuration items, as well as to switch between LED instances easily.\n\nThe refined color coding in the user-interfaces, helps you to quickly identify instance specific and global configuration items.\n\nOf course, the release brings new features (e.g. USB Capture on Windows), as well as minor enhancements and a good number of fixes.\n\nNote:\n\nIMPORTANT: Due to the rework of the grabbers, both screen- and video grabbers are disabled after the upgrade to the new version.\n\nPlease, re-enable the grabber of choice via the UI, validate the configuration and save the setup. The grabber should then restart.\n\nHyperion packages can now be installed under Ubuntu (x64) and Debian (amd64/armhf) (incl. Raspberry Pi OS) via our own APT server.\n\nDetails about the installation can be found in the installation.md and at apt.hyperion-project.org.\n\nFind here more details on supported platforms and configuration sets\n\nAdded\n\nThe Dashboard is now a one-stop control element to control instances and link into configuration areas\n\nLED Instance independent configuration objects (e.g. capturing hardware) are now separated out in the menu\n\nNew menu item \"Sources\" per LED instances configuration to enable/disable screen or usb grabber per instance\n\nGrabbers\n\nWindows Media Foundation USB grabber (incl.
