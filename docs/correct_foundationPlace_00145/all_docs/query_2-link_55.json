        "text": "Transformational merger of equals will focus on operational efficiency to drive gross margin improvements through enhanced scale and supply chain optimization\n\nThe combined company is expected to achieve between $20 and $25 million annualized cost savings\n\nStrongly positioned as a top 10 brand portfolio by revenue in California, with 20 retail stores by year end, 12 house brands and broad state-wide coverage\n\nComprehensive vertical infrastructure and retail scale enables efficient operational model with significant cross-selling opportunity for complementary house brands into expansive retail store networks\n\nUpon completion of the transaction, Troy Datcher will be named Chairman of the Board and Laurie Holcomb will be named Chief Executive Officer\n\nUnanimously recommended by The Parent Company Board of Directors, and the special independent committee of the Board\n\nThe Parent Company and Gold Flora to host a joint conference call and webcast today at 8:30 a.m. Eastern Time to discuss the proposed business combination\n\nUnless otherwise noted, all dollar figures refer to U.S. dollars.\n\nSAN JOSE, Calif., Feb. 22, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - TPCO Holding Corp. (\"The Parent Company\" or the \"Company\") (NEO: GRAM) (OTCQX: GRAMF), a leading consumer-focused California cannabis company, and Gold Flora, a leading vertically-integrated California cannabis company, today announced that they have entered into a definitive business combination agreement (the \"Merger Agreement\") to combine the companies in an all-stock merger (the \"Business Combination\"). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, The Parent Company shareholders will own approximately 49%, and Gold Flora holders will own approximately 51%, of the outstanding common equity of the combined company on a pro forma basis upon consummation of the Business Combination.\n\nKey Transaction Benefits & Strategic Rationale\n\nIncreased size and scale to become a leading operator in the world's largest cannabis market. The combined company is expected to operate a footprint of 20 retail stores, 12 house brands, 3 distribution centers, and 1 manufacturing facility and 6 cultivation facilities, providing the size and scale to position the combined company as a leader in California.\n\nEstablishing a strongly positioned vertically-integrated platform to achieve financial and operational efficiency, as one of the largest indoor cultivators and retail operators in California. The combined company will have an indoor cultivation canopy of approximately 72,000 square feet, with the opportunity to expand to a further approximately 240,000 square feet, critical to controlling its supply chain and inventory levels while providing consistent high-quality flower, as well as flower-driven products that leverage an exceptional proprietary genetics library to deliver exclusive offerings that align with consumer demands.\n\nSignificant synergies expected to drive margin improvement and enhance profitability across all verticals. Through the streamlining of retail operations, utilizing scale to access bulk purchasing power, and eliminating third-party contracts, the combined company is expected to achieve annualized cost savings of between $20 and $25 million, to further improve gross margin and profitability while delivering value for shareholders.\n\nReduction in third-party costs through supply-chain optimization. The combined company will reduce third-party contracts when strategically and cost effectively appropriate by utilizing the capabilities of Gold Flora and controlling its value chain.\n\nCombined entity will be well-positioned as a top 10 brand portfolio by revenue. As two of the premier operators in the state, the Business Combination will result in a diversified and highly complementary customer product offering, with a variety of form factors and brands for differentiated consumer profiles. Additionally, with only 13% overlap in current company retail store footprints, there is a significant opportunity for cross-selling brands into diverse customer bases to drive organic growth.\n\nEnhanced financial profile with strong balance sheet. The combined company would have pro forma revenue of $116.4 million for the nine-month period ended September 30, 2022, with a gross margin of 33%1. Providing a robust foundation to accelerate growth, the combined company will be well-positioned to capitalize on the market opportunities ahead as a leading public cannabis company in California.\n\nManagement Commentary\n\n\"This merger of equals with the Gold Flora Corporation represents the next stage in our evolution, leveraging our complementary assets and core capabilities to deliver the most value for our customers and shareholders,\" said Troy Datcher, Chief Executive Officer, and Chairman of The Parent Company. \"Together, we will have the strategic platform comprised of scale, cultivation capabilities, and brand portfolio to execute on our mission to create unique and culturally relevant products. This vertical integration will fuel both the development of more consumer brands and broader consumer reach while enabling us to improve our gross margin and profitability to establish our business as a true leader in California to take advantage of the incredible growth opportunities ahead of us.\"\n\nMr. Datcher concluded, \"This is a monumental moment, and I want to sincerely thank the team at The Parent Company that has executed on the significant improvements we have made over the last year to prepare our company for today and the potential strategic partnership opportunities. I'd also like to take a moment to share how excited we are to begin our work with the team at Gold Flora, we can't wait to get started on all we will achieve together.\"\n\n\"We are thrilled to embark on this groundbreaking effort to create a true vertical leader in the most exciting cannabis market in the world,\" said Laurie Holcomb, Chief Executive Officer of Gold Flora. \"By combining our proven approach to lean, effective infrastructure and vertically integrated operations from cultivation through distribution and The Parent Company's brand building expertise and retail and delivery footprint, we expect to achieve market defining performance at every level of the business. Our team has done a phenomenal job of optimizing our indoor cultivation capabilities, building our portfolio of proprietary genetics, and advancing our high-quality manufacturing and distribution operations, and we look forward to leveraging these strengths as we begin our work to combine our two companies.\"\n\nMs. Holcomb added, \"The team at The Parent Company shares many of our values for authentic customer connections and delivering superior product experiences. We are aligned on the mission to become a profitable, world-class brand builder and are ready for this next phase of growth.\"\n\nProposed Transaction Summary\n\nThe Business Combination will be completed, subject to the Merger Agreement, by way of a court-approved plan of arrangement under the Business Corporations Act (British Columbia), whereby a newly formed British Columbia corporation (\"New Parent\"), created to manage and hold the combined business of The Parent Company and Gold Flora, will, directly and indirectly, acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of The Parent Company (\"TPCO Shares\") and all of the issued and outstanding membership units in the capital of Gold Flora (\"Gold Flora Units\").

Investors and security holders of The Parent Company are urged to carefully read the entire Circular (including any supplements to the Circular) when such document becomes available before making any voting decision with respect to the proposed transaction because the Circular will contain important information about the proposed Business Combination and the parties to the Business Combination. The Circular, when available, will be mailed to The Parent Company shareholders, as well as be accessible on the SEC's EDGAR system and SEDAR profile of The Parent Company.\n\nInvestors and security holders of The Parent Company will be able to obtain a free copy of the Circular, as well as other relevant filings containing information about The Parent Company and the Business Combination, without charge, at the website of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the \"SEC\") at www.sec.gov, or from The Parent Company by going to The Parent Company's Investor Relations page on its website at https://ir.theparent.co/financials/sec filings/default.aspx.\n\nParticipants in the Solicitation\n\nThe Parent Company, Gold Flora and certain of their respective directors, executive officers and employees may be deemed to be participants in the solicitation of The Parent Company proxies in respect of the proposed transaction.

Cannabis remains a Schedule I drug under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act, making it illegal under federal law in the United States to, among other things, cultivate, distribute, or possess cannabis in the United States. Financial transactions involving proceeds generated by, or intended to promote, cannabis-related business activities in the United States may form the basis for prosecution under applicable U.S. federal money laundering legislation.\n\nWhile the approach to enforcement of such laws by the federal government in the United States has trended toward non-enforcement against individuals and businesses that comply with medical or adult-use cannabis programs in states where such programs are legal, strict compliance with state laws with respect to cannabis will neither absolve The Parent Company of liability under U.S. federal law, nor will it provide a defense to any federal proceeding which may be brought against the Company. The enforcement of federal laws in the United States is a significant risk to the business of The Parent Company and any proceedings brought against the Company thereunder may adversely affect the Company's operations and financial performance.\n\nNeither IIROC nor any stock exchange or other securities regulatory authority accepts responsibility for the adequacy or accuracy of this release.\n\nSOURCE The Parent Company"
