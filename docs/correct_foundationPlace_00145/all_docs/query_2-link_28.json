The symbols in her work are usually implied and are not always used in a literal sense. Rather they are private, imaginative images that arise from the depth of the psyche and embrace the surreal quality of dreams, fantasies and premonitions. She often employs human body to tell a story and convey specific emotions. Even the tiniest movement of a muscle isn't arbitrary. Every detail, every movement adds to the drama of the overall painting. Born in Rivne Ukraine, Alla received her BFA from Memphis College of Art (2010) and later completed her MFA at Laguna College of Art and Design (2013). She currently lives and works in Huntington Beach, CA.\n\nJerry Beck is a writer, animation producer and author of more than 15 books on animation history.

For him, a native Californian, the change was a bit of a shock, but since Christina was born in Queens and lived on Long Island until she was nine, the move felt more like going home. She decided the sudden change was a sign-- an opportunity to finally pursue writing full time, something she’d been planning since the fourth grade. Planning while simultaneously letting life get in the way, they spent a year in Brooklyn. In that time, she took three writing workshops at The Writers Studio. Once they were back in Orange County, she continued workshopping at UCLA Extension, but it was an acceptance into a community workshop at Chapman University that led to a fellowship which allowed her to pursue an MFA in creative writing, which led to a teaching position at Orange County School of the Arts. There, she discovered a knack for helping students learn how to unearth and cultivate their own unique creative voice.

As a subject in my recent work, the ocean is healing both physically and emotionally to me. It existed before we did. It is wiser than we are. We need it more than it needs us. I am constantly inspired by its majestic beauty. The women I paint in the foreground deal with the messy complexities of the human condition. In the background, the ocean forms a vast rhythmic backdrop. The narrative of the painting tests these two interfaces. “\n\nWhen I was nine, the things I liked best in the world were writing rambling stories, tennis lessons on Toronto's weather-cracked courts, and playing \"school\" with the kids across the street. In high school and college, I didn't write as much, played less, and studied more boring things. In 2005, I got an MSc in Social and Public Communication from the London School of Economics, where I learned about rhetoric and got excited about words (and school!) again. After a decade-long career in communications, I returned to school for an MFA in Creative Writing at the University of British Columbia.
