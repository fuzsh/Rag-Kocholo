        "text": "Richard E. Besser, MD, (he/him) is president and CEO of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation (RWJF), a position he assumed in April 2017 following a long career at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and at ABC News.\n\nAt the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Rich leads the largest private foundation in the country devoted solely to improving the nation’s health. In partnership with others, RWJF is committed to taking bold leaps to transform health in our lifetime and paving the way together to a future where health is no longer a privilege but a right. To achieve that vision, we are deepening our focus on dismantling one of the biggest barriers to health in America, structural racism.\n\nIn his role, Rich is a leading voice on the importance of healthy and equitable community conditions, the need for economic inclusion for the wellbeing of families, accountable public health and healthcare systems, and advocating for racial justice. Rich leads Foundation colleagues in these efforts, and was an influential advocate throughout the COVID-19 pandemic for prioritizing health equity in COVID-19 response as well as in planning for future public health emergencies.\n\nRich is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine and serves on the Board of Trustees of Howard University. He co-chairs the President’s Council on Disability Inclusion in Philanthropy.\n\nBefore joining the Foundation, Rich served for eight years as chief health and medical editor for ABC News, and as a leader at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), where he worked for 13 years. He served as acting director of the CDC during the initial response to the H1N1 influenza pandemic.\n\nRich served as the pediatric residency director at the University of California, San Diego, and conducted research to reduce the spread of tuberculosis to children. He returned to the CDC in 1998 as an infectious disease epidemiologist working on pneumonia, antibiotic resistance, and the control of antibiotic overuse.\n\nThe author or co-author of hundreds of presentations, abstracts, chapters, editorials and publications, Rich has earned many awards for his work in public health and his volunteer service. He received the Surgeon General's Medallion for his leadership during the H1N1 response, and in 2011, the Dean's Medal for his contributions to public health from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. His book, “Tell Me the Truth, Doctor: Easy-to-Understand Answers to Your Most Confusing and Critical Health Questions,” written with his wife, Jeanne, was published by Hyperion in 2013.\n\nRich received his Bachelor of Arts degree in economics from Williams College and medical degree from the University of Pennsylvania. He completed a residency and chief residency in pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore.\n\nHe practiced as a volunteer pediatrician at several community clinics across the nation for more than 30 years, most recently volunteering at the Henry J. Austin Health Center in Trenton, N.J. He and his wife Jeanne, a food writer, have two adult sons, Alex and Jack."
