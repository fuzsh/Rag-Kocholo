        "text": "On the opening day of AWE 2023, Ultraleap announces the launch of the Leap Motion Controller 2, the second generation of the iconic hand tracking camera that allows you to use your own hands to interact naturally with digital content in 3D.\n\nLeading on from its successful predecessor, the Leap Motion Controller 2 is the ideal hardware for experiencing Ultraleapâs world-class hand tracking. Key improvements over the original Leap Motion Controller include higher resolution cameras, an increased field of view, and 25% lower power consumption, all in a 30% smaller package for optimum placement and convenience.\n\nDesigned for the world of XR, the Leap Motion Controller 2 allows you to immerse yourself for longer in untethered virtual reality experiences with Pico including the Pico Neo 3 Pro and Pro Eye, Pico 4 Enterprise, and Pico G3 models for business.\n\nAmir Khorram, Head of PICO Enterprise North America, said: \"The relationship between Ultraleap and PICO has already helped to create a powerful XR enterprise ecosystem that is transforming the way businesses and industries engage with digital content. Weâre proud to support Ultraleap in the launch of the Leap Motion Controller 2 and demonstrate the unparalleled precision and responsiveness of Ultraleapâs hand tracking with Pico's cutting-edge virtual reality devices at AWE, including our latest headsets PICO 4E and G3 for business.â\n\nUsing the Leap Motion Controller 2 as an accessory, you can also enhance your experiences on both PC VR using the Varjo Aero and untethered Android XR2 with Lenovoâs ThinkReality VRX headset.\n\nIn a world first at AWE, experience true mobile augmented reality (AR) through the integration of the\n\nLeap Motion Controller 2 and ARGOâ¢ â smartglasses for enterprise and lite-industrial workers. Users\n\nwill experience the future of interactive learning with 3DCAD, an application that lets you explore and\n\ninteract with a 3D model of an electric motor.\n\nBrian Hamilton, VP of Sales & Marketing at DigiLens said: \"We are incredibly excited about the launch\n\nof the Leap Motion Controller 2 and its integration with our ARGO smartglasses. At DigiLens, we strive\n\nto provide cutting-edge augmented reality solutions that enhance productivity and efficiency at scale\n\nfor enterprise and lite-industrial users. Hand tracking is a vital component for our customers as it\n\nempowers them to interact seamlessly with digital content, enabling faster and more precise\n\nmanipulation of virtual objects. This technology opens up new possibilities for training, remote\n\ncollaboration, and real-time data visualization, revolutionizing the way industries work.â\n\nDuring the show, Ultraleap will also be demonstrating the Leap Motion Controller 2 attached to Tilt Five AR headsets and used in conjunction with Battle Map Studio. The experience allows you to use your real hands to interact, play games with your friends, and build virtual worlds.\n\nWith the Leap Motion Controller 2, for the first time Ultraleapâs Gemini hand tracking will be compatible with macOS, Android XR2, and Windows, opening up huge opportunities for content creators to access global audiences with their games and applications.\n\nAs the enterprise XR market has grown, Ultraleap has seen the likes of NMY, PIXO VR and AutoDeskâs VRED use hand tracking to enhance and improve training and productivity. The Leap Motion Controller 2 provides greater flexibility and choice to content developers and software providers, enabling better experiences for end users.\n\nBrian Draper, VP, Content at PIXO VR said: âAt PIXO VR, we understand the power of hand tracking in VR training experiences. It can be crucial in creating truly immersive and realistic training simulations, allowing users to naturally manipulate objects and perform complex tasks in virtual environments. We are proud to support the launch of the Leap Motion Controller 2 and offer this hand tracking solution to our customers. We are already working on exciting projects that will redefine the way organizations approach VR training. Stay tuned for the incredible experiences we are developing in collaboration with customers.\"\n\nBeyond XR use cases, the Leap Motion Controller 2 also enhances the way performers express their music and art, enables VTuber presenters to embody their avatars and allows natural interaction with applications and games on macOS, Android XR2, and Windows.\n\nSince its launch in 2013, a million units of the original Leap Motion Controller have been sold and more than 350,000 developers have created applications and interactive experiences with hand tracking. From helping to cure amblyopia, making dogs wise, Legoland rides, aviation VR training and enabling Ultraleapâs own first generation of mid-air haptics, the Leap Motion Controller has powered countless ground-breaking innovations. It is now synonymous with gesture interaction.\n\nTom Carter, CEO and Co-founder at Ultraleap said: \"As we unveil the smaller, lighter, better Leap Motion Controller 2, we celebrate a decade of pioneering advancements in hand tracking technology. This latest generation builds upon the strong foundation laid by its predecessor and reconfirms our commitment to providing our global community of developers and creators with the worldâs best hand tracking technology.\n\nâThe Leap Motion Controller 2 not only represents the culmination of our journey so far but also enables a future where natural interaction becomes the norm. We are excited to share this next iteration with the world and continue breaking down the barriers between physical and digital worlds. We thank everyone who has helped us get to this point.\"\n\nInteraction experiences powered by the Leap Motion Controller have improved over time due to a decade's worth of developments and iterations in Ultraleap software. With the announcement of the new product, the original Leap Motion Controller is now retired. Existing customers may continue to access the latest compatible software including the soon-to-be-released Gemini for macOS. Support will also continue to be provided. Future versions of the software will not deliver any performance improvements to the original Leap Motion Controller device.\n\nThe Leap Motion Controller 2 is available for pre-order now through RobotShop for $139 (USD) MSRP â XR Headset Mount and license options are separate. Global shipping is expected in Summer 2023. The Leap Motion Controller 2 macOS, Android XR2, and Windows releases will be made available at the same time.\n\nUltraleap will be showcasing the Leap Motion Controller 2 at AWE 2023, booth #724 and #1345. AWE partners for the Leap Motion Controller 2 include Pico, Varjo, DigiLens, Tilt Five and Looking Glass. ManageXR (#725), ArborXR (#400) and bHaptics (#513) will also have Ultraleapâs hand tracking available to demo."
