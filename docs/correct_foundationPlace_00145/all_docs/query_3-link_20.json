        "text": "Vicky Castegren, the force behind Hyperion Stud, began her equestrian journey as a jumper rider, balancing her passion for competition with a burgeoning interest in breeding. In 2000, she launched her first business, purchasing her first broodmare in foal within a few years. Initially, breeding was more of a hobby as she concentrated on her riding career.\n\nHowever, a significant life change in 2007, when Vicky became pregnant with her first child, shifted her focus. Temporarily setting aside her riding aspirations, she delved deeper into the world of breeding. This pivotal moment led her to purchase a new farm, perfect for both sporthorses and breeding horses, where she began to build what would become a notable breeding operation.\n\nThe Rise of Hyperion Stud\n\nEmbed from Getty Images\n\nThe farm Vicky chose in the rolling terrain of Virginia had a history of Arabian breeding, equipped with essential infrastructure like indoor and outdoor arenas. She transformed this facility to suit her vision for sporthorse breeding. As her riding career took a backseat, her dedication to breeding intensified. Vicky acquired her first stallion, Imothep (v. Indoctro/Calvados/Dominard), who went on to compete in the 2014 World Championships with Irish show jumper Darragh Kenny, and the 2016 Olympic Games with Taizo Sugitant of Japan.\n\nVicky admits it was a bit of a stroke of luck that helped place Hyperion Stud on the map through Imothep, though here was an early example of what was clearly a natural eye for horses. “I would love to say that I saw something magical and amazing,” she laughed. “I was still wet behind the ears at the time. I can tell you that I loved his type and I loved the way he looked, but I was also starting a new business and I had to have a stallion with a pedigree that was recognizable. And his pedigree was just that: he’s by Indoctro, and everyone knows Indoctro, and then out of a French mother line which may have been less known. I honestly didn’t have the knowledge at the time to know just how powerhouse of a pedigree that was. It was important to have something people could connect with, even if they didn’t have deep knowledge of breeding, so I went with something that moved and jumped nice and had a good paper.”\n\nImothep not only marked Hyperion Stud’s entry into the elite breeding arena, but also allowed Vicky to refine her breeding program. She went about acquiring quality mares and making connections to grow her network, prioritizing quality over quantity in terms of foals on the ground.\n\nVicky’s journey in breeding was marked by a steep learning curve. She immersed herself in understanding registries, pedigrees, and the intricacies of breeding superior sporthorses. Her natural eye for quality horses, honed from years of riding and exposure to top equestrian events, played a crucial role in her success. She learned to balance pedigrees and make informed breeding decisions, often likening the process to a gamble with Mother Nature.\n\nEventing: A Passion Rediscovered\n\nAlthough Vicky’s primary focus was initially on jumpers, her connection to eventing ran deep. In high school, she participated in Novice and Training level eventing, which laid the foundation for her appreciation of the sport. After moving to Virginia, she trained with prominent figures like Paul and Wendy Matthews, and her paths frequently crossed with renowned eventers such as Will Coleman, who she first met when Will was a kid.\n\nAs Will’s career blossomed, Vicky’s involvement in eventing syndicates further cemented her commitment to the sport. She joined the Off the Record Syndicate and the Four Star Eventing Group, supporting horses such as DonDante, Cold Red Rum, OBOS O’Reilly, and Off The Record. Her experience watching the U.S.Eventing team’s performance in the 2012 Olympics fueled her desire to enhance the quality of eventing horses, particularly in dressage.\n\n“I just felt like there was more left out there,” she recalled. “We needed better horses to be more competitive in the dressage phase because as strong as we were in the jumping and cross country phases, we were always beaten in that first phase and couldn’t catch up.”\n\nAs fate would have it, “I think the universe was listening.”\n\nThe Emergence of Chin Tonic\n\nOne of Vicky’s most significant contributions to eventing came with the acquisition of Chin Tonic HS (2012 Holsteiner gelding by Chin Champ/Quinar/Contender stamm 474a. ).\n\nDiscovered through a colleague, this young horse displayed remarkable potential, though he was not initially selected for the Holsteiner Verband stallion registry. Vicky saw beyond this early rejection, recognizing the then-stallion’s exceptional qualities.\n\n“I called Will and said ‘I think I’ve got a horse for you’,” Vicky said, telling the story of the disbelief she felt when she first saw videos of the horse and his elastic movement and body control well beyond his years.\n\nWill joined Vicky on a quick trip to Germany to take “Chin” for a spin. Though the horse was just under 4 years old at the time, Will immediately saw Chin Tonic’s potential as one of the best young horses he had ever sat on.\n\nUltimately, Vicky made the decision to purchase Chin Tonic, leaving him in Germany to continue his training with his breeder, Inken Platen-Hallermund, and turning down offers to sell him years later. “I’ll never forget one thing Will said to me, and it was that if I let the horse stay in Germany, he would never leave [because he was that good]. I was like, ‘Nope! Welcome to America! Will, when do you want him to come?’”\n\nVicky’s decision to bring Chin Tonic to the U.S. and her collaboration with Will Coleman led to a successful partnership. Chin Tonic’s journey from a promising young horse to a top eventer exemplifies Vicky’s philosophy of taking the time to develop horses properly. This approach, focusing on the horse’s long-term soundness and confidence, has been key to their success.\n\n“I’ve always told Will and Katie [Coleman] that the priority was always the horse’s future,” Vicky emphasized. “It’s never about today or tomorrow, it was about ten years from that point. Now, he’s 12 years old and Will’s able to show him for what he is.” While Chin Tonic HS is currently sidelined due to a hyperextension of his knee, it’s expected he will be back in full action for the 2025 season.\n\n“I don’t set goals for the horses,” she continued. “Each individual horse will tell me where they should go and my job is to figure out how to get them there. I sort of have hopes and wishes, when I see one that ticks all the boxes like Chin did, but it’s important to allow them to tell you what they’ll be best at.”\n\nBreeding Philosophy and Future Goals\n\nVicky’s breeding philosophy centers on quality over quantity. By maintaining a manageable number of foals each year, she ensures hands-on care and attention to each horse. This meticulous approach has solidified her reputation for producing top-quality sporthorses.\n\nA staunch advocate for breeders, Vicky believes they are the backbone of the equestrian sport. She calls for greater recognition and support for breeders in more places than year end or lifetime achievement awards , emphasizing the need for programs that promote the education and development of young horses and riders. Her commitment to giving back is evident in her support for young rider programs and her contributions to improving facilities like the Virginia Horse Center, where she has been involved as an event sponsor and a donor to implement facility improvements such as footing and infrastructure.\n\nLooking ahead, Vicky aims to expand her impact through initiatives like Hyperion Dressage, while continuing to support the next generation of horses and riders. The legacy she is building is one of dedication, education, and a deep passion for the sport of eventing.\n\n“My reputation is my everything,” she reflected. “We really pride ourselves on being there for our clients every step of the way. Breeding is hard. It’s heartbreaking, physical work, and it’s often thankless and goes without enough recognition. I’m humbled every day. I have good partners and an exceptional team in the U.S. and Europe. It is my goal to be impactful in small ways, and to leave a positive legacy for my children and future generations of breeders.”"
