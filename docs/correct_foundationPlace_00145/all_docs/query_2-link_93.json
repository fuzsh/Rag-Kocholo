        "text": "3. Raw Data 3 Raw Data will be no use until it will become information\n\n4. Raw Data -> Information 4 How do you find out the profit of Product “Electronics” from 100’ s of Excel sheets Metadata\n\n5. Then what is OLTP In general, All Database Systems are OLTP  Most RDBMS systems are OLTP  Detailed, Up to Date Data  Read/Update of few records  Run the business in real time  Historical Data will be archived for performance reasons Eg: Walk into Reliance Store you will find OLTP Walk into ATM you will find OLTP Buy TV in electronic shops Buy Stocks in Broker like Etrade -> OLTP 5\n\n6. Current Challenges • I can’t find the data I need – data is scattered over the network – many versions, subtle differences – No Single source for Information • I cant understand the data I found – available data poorly documented • I can’t use the data I found – results are unexpected – data needs to be transformed from one form to other What's certain about today's business climate is uncertainty 6\n\n7. What is Data Warehouse  A single, complete and consistent store of data obtained from a variety of different sources made available to end users in a what they can understand and use in a business context. - Barry Delvin 7\n\n8. In Other Words  A data warehouse is a  subject-oriented  Integrated  time-varying  non-volatile collection of data that is used primarily in organizational decision making. --------Bill Inmon 8\n\n10. Why do you need the history 10  Study the past if you define the future\n\n11. 11 Data Warehouse Relational Detail Star Schemas Common Dimensions Common Transformations Data Models GL Excel Sheets/Flat FilesHR Dashboard Reporting\n\n12. Data Mart 12 Marketing Mart HR Data Mart Sales Data Mart Data Marts DataWarehouse Data grouped for a specific subject area and considered as subset of data warehouse Can contain atomic data and summarized data. Generally Each data mart is designed for each department like Marketing, Sales etc.\n\n13. Dimension Tables  Dimension tables establish the context of the facts  In other words, Dimensional tables store fields that describe the facts  Eg: Time Periods, Products, Customers etc 13 Fact Table Fact tables are used to record actual facts or measures in the business. Facts are the numeric data items that are of interest to the business Access via dimensions\n\n14. Types of Measures-Facts  Additive: Valid to SUM up to any Dimensional level -SUM(Sales_Amount)  Semi-Additive: Semi-Additive measures are measures that can be added across some, but not all dimensions. For example the bank account balance is simply a snapshot in time and cannot be summed over time. -Sum(balance) where month=2011-12-12  Non-Additive=never used in a Sum  Eg: Gross-Margin , Ratios etc...; 14\n\n15. Slowly Changing Dimensions  Type-I SCD (Over write)  Type-II SCD (Maintain History)  Type-III SCD(Alternate Realities) info@leadinnovativetechnologies.com 15 Cust ID Cust Name Cust City 10 XYZ New York Cust ID Cust Name Cust City 10 XYZ Seattle Change of Attributes No History Maintained Cust ID Cust Name Cust City Date 10 XYZ New York 1-Jan-2000 Change of Attributes ALL History Maintained Cust ID Cust Name Cust City Date 10 XYZ New York 1-Jan-2000 10 XYZ Seattle 1-Jan-2005 Cust ID Cust Name Cust City 10 XYZ New York Cust ID Cust Name Cust City1 Cust City 2 10 XYZ New York Seattle Change of Attributes History In Separate columns\n\n16. Schema Design Schema Types  Star Schema  Snow-Flake Schema  Fact Constellation schema or Galaxy Schema 16\n\n17. Star Schema  A single fact table and for each dimension one dimension table 17 Fact Table (or) Measures Time Product Scenario Customers\n\n18. Snow Flake Schema  Represent dimensional hierarchy directly by normalizing tables.  Gives more Detailed Information info@leadinnovativetechnologies.com 18 Fact Table (or) Measures Time Product Scenario Countries Cities\n\n19. Fact Constellation  Multiple Fact Tables that share multiple dimensional tables 19 Fact Table (or) Measures Time Product Scenario Customers Revenue\n\n20. DWH Cycle 20 Oracle Flat Files DB2 Staging Area ETL Enterprise DWH DM1 DM3 DM2 OLAP Business Decision Reports Hyperion Resource MDM / DRM\n\n21. Dimensional Modeling Design Process  Choose a business process to model - Business activity that is valuable to analyze -Set of transactions that can be collected in a fact table  Declare the Grain of the fact table -level of detail that you will record in the fact table  Choose the Dimensions -Descriptive information about transactions -Usually want to limit number of dimensions  Choose the Metrics -Numeric fields tagged to each fact table row 21\n\n22. EPM Enterprise Performance Management A set of processes that help organizations optimize their business performance. It is a framework for organizing, automating and analyzing business methodologies , metrics, processes and systems that drive business performance The products formerly known as Hyperion provide Enterprise Performance Management (\"EPM\") capabilities 22\n\n23. 23\n\n24. Multi Dimensional Analysis  Query tool caches pre-computed aggregates in memory or on mid-tier server for extra-fast response time.  Used to Analyze the future business based on past and present sales Eg: Sales Analysis  Avoid spending time in analyzing huge numbers of daily transactions data  Essbase stands for Extended Spreadsheet Analysis  Used to Analyze data in multiple view of perspective so that business users can take decision for forecast analysis 24\n\n25. Advantages of MOLAP Hyperion is multi Slice Dice dimensional database 25\n\n27. Essbase History 27 Arbor Corporation Essbase 1992 Hyperion Solutions 1998 Essbase Hyperion Enterprise Hyperion Reporting Planning and Budgeting Oracle Corporation Oracle EPM System BI Foundation Essbase 2007\n\n28. Cube means 28 Intersecting Dimensions -- Form Data Cells OLAP Storage Paradigm -- Multidimensional databases are array structures , not related tables -- Will concentrate about cells not fields\n\n29. Essbase is tuned for Analysis  Which customers are most profitable  What is the customer likely to buy next  What if demand falls short of forecast 29 Why Essbase • Richest business users experience • Highly Advanced Calculation Engine • Write-Back Capability Feature\n\n30. Essbase Introduction  Part of Business Intelligence Foundation in Oracle EPM System widely considered to be the industry leading OLAP (On-Line Analytical Processing) server  It is a multidimensional database that enables Business Users to analyze business data in multiple views/prospective and at different consolidation levels. It stores the data in a multi dimensional array 30 Essbase Planning & Budgeting Forecasti ng Product Analysis Customer Analysis Essbase Usage Minute->Day->Week->Month->Qtr->Year Product Line->Product Family->Product Cat->Product sub Cat\n\n31.
