        "text": "Chief Executive Officer, The Walt Disney Company\n\nRobert Alan Iger is Chief Executive Officer of The Walt Disney Company, having returned to the company in November of 2022 after serving as CEO and Chairman from 2005 to 2020, and then as Executive Chairman and Chairman of the Board through 2021.\n\nSince returning as CEO, Mr. Iger has led a significant, enterprise-wide transformation to restore creativity to the center of the company and position Disney’s streaming business for sustained growth and profitability. During his more than 15 years at the helm of Disney, Mr. Iger has served as steward of the world’s most respected and beloved brands. His strategic vision focuses on three fundamental pillars: generating the best creative content possible; fostering innovation and utilizing the latest technology; and expanding into new markets across the globe.\n\nWidely recognized as one of the world’s most consequential business leaders, Mr. Iger has built on Disney’s rich history of unforgettable storytelling with the acquisitions of Pixar (2006), Marvel (2009), Lucasfilm (2012), and 21st Century Fox (2019); the landmark opening of Disney’s first theme park and resort in mainland China, Shanghai Disney Resort; and the release of a number of record-setting films, including Marvel’s Avengers: Endgame, Disney’s Frozen and Frozen 2, and Marvel’s groundbreaking Black Panther. Always one to embrace new technology, Mr. Iger made Disney an industry leader through its creative content offerings across multiple new platforms, including the highly successful launch of the Disney+ streaming service in November 2019.\n\nDisney’s exceptional entertainment experiences, widely diverse content, and Iger’s unique skill in managing businesses in an integrated manner led to strong results. During Mr. Iger’s tenure, The Walt Disney Company has been recognized as one of the “Most Reputable Companies” in both America and the world by Forbes magazine (2006–2019); one of the “Best Employers” in both America and the world by Forbes magazine (2019 and 2018, respectively); one of the “World's Most Admired Companies” by Fortune magazine (2009–2021); and one of the “World's Most Respected Companies” by Barron’s (2009–2017).\n\nMr. Iger was first appointed Chief Executive Officer of Disney in October 2005 and was elected Chairman in 2012. In February 2020, he assumed the role of Executive Chairman and directed the company’s creative endeavors until retiring in December 2021. From 2000-2005, Mr. Iger served as Disney’s President and Chief Operating Officer. He officially joined the Disney senior management team in 1996 as Chairman of the Disney-owned ABC Group, and in 1999, was given the additional responsibility of President, Walt Disney International. In that role, Mr. Iger expanded and coordinated Disney’s presence outside of the United States, establishing the blueprint for the company’s international growth today. As Chairman of the ABC Group, Mr. Iger oversaw the broadcast television network and station group, cable television properties, and radio and publishing businesses, and also guided the complex merger between Capital Cities/ABC, Inc., and the Walt Disney Company. During Mr. Iger’s years with ABC, he obtained hands-on experience in every aspect of the television business—including news, sports, and entertainment—as well as in program acquisition, rights negotiations, and business affairs. He began his career at ABC in 1974.\n\nIn 2023, Mr. Iger was featured on the cover of TIME as part of its annual 100 Most Influential People issue. Additionally, he was TIME’s Businessperson of the Year (2019); one of Forbes magazine's “World’s Most Powerful People” (2018); one of the “Top Gun CEOs” by Forbes magazine (2009); one of Fortune magazine’s “25 Most Powerful People in Business” (2006, 2007); one of the “Best CEOs” by Institutional Investor magazine (2008, 2009, 2010, 2011); MarketWatch's “CEO of the Year” (2006); and “CEO of the Year” by Chief Executive magazine (2014).\n\nMr. Iger was inducted into the Television Academy Hall of Fame in January 2020, and the Broadcasting and Cable Hall of Fame in 2015. He currently serves on the boards of the 9/11 Memorial & Museum and Bloomberg Philanthropies. In 2012, Mr. Iger became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, one of the nation’s most prestigious honorary societies, which recognizes some of the world’s most accomplished scholars, scientists, writers, artists, and civic, corporate, and philanthropic leaders. He served as chairman of the capital campaign for the new Academy Museum of Motion Pictures in Los Angeles. From 2011-2019 he was a member of the Apple board of directors.\n\nIn September 2022, Mr. Iger was recognized as an Honorary Knight Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire by Her Late Majesty Queen Elizabeth II for his services to the UK / US relations. Mr. Iger was also awarded the Chevalier de Legion d’Honneur by the French Republic in April 2024 for his outstanding commitments and merits displayed through his professional accomplishments and public service.\n\nMr. Iger is the author of the New York Times best-selling book The Ride of a Lifetime: Lessons Learned from 15 Years as CEO of The Walt Disney Company, published in 2019. He is a graduate of Ithaca College.\n\nSenior Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer, The Walt Disney Company\n\nTinisha Agramonte is Senior Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer (CDO) of The Walt Disney Company. Agramonte leads Disney’s diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) strategy, collaborating with business segments and leaders across the company to foster a culture of belonging.\n\nShe joined Disney in 2022 as Vice President of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Talent Outreach & Development with Disney Parks, Experiences and Products. Based in Orlando, she led work to develop a DPEP DEI strategic plan and launch an integrated work group of key senior leaders to prioritize DEI efforts and drive effectiveness and efficiencies.\n\nPrior to joining Disney, Agramonte served as the inaugural Chief Diversity Officer at Motorola Solutions. She also served in senior executive positions with the federal government as the CDO and Director for the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Commerce; Assistant Administrator for Diversity, Inclusion and Civil Rights with the U.S. Small Business Administration; and Director of Diversity and Inclusion Outreach and Retention with the Department of Veterans Affairs. She architected and launched the First-Generation Professionals Initiative, a first-of-its-kind federal government diversity and inclusion program. She has nearly 30 years of experience working in the U.S., Europe and Asia in the diversity, civil rights, equal employment opportunity, and human relations arenas as a civil servant, consultant, university instructor, and trainer/facilitator.\n\nFor several years, Agramonte was an adjunct instructor at Chapman University, teaching senior-level diversity management courses.\n\nThroughout her career, she has been recognized as a purpose-driven and results-oriented leader, overseeing federal agencies and companies’ transformation efforts, strategically embedding innovative DEI policies, practices and decision-making into day-to-day business operations. Agramonte oversaw DEI strategic programs that were recognized as best practices, impacting workforces up to 300,000 employees.
