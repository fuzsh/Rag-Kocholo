Hyperion's November release brings you some new features, removed IPv6 address related limitations, as well as fixing a couple of issues.

Hyperion packages can be installed now under Ubuntu (x64/armhf/arm64) and Debian (x64/armhf/arm64) (incl. Raspberry Pi OS) via our own APT server.

Details about the installation can be found in the installation.md and at apt.hyperion-project.org.

We strongly recommend doing an export of your configuration before migrating to the new version!

You cannot use the new version's configuration database with a previous version.

If you run multiple instances, you unfortunately need to export each individually.

Added

Fixed Database migration version handling

Fixed Python ModuleNotFoundError (#1109)

Technical

Added Qt6 support

Migrated to MBEDTSL 3

The release is primarily fixing issues introduced with alpha 10, but covering other findings too.

Thanks to everybody highlighting real problem areas, as well as to those proactively providing fixes for integration via pull requests.

Besides bug fixing, you will find some smaller enhancements which make everybodyâ€™s life easier.

The fact that WS281x devices must run under root caused many headaches before in getting them running.

We did not weaken security, but provide you with an easy to use script to switch the user-id of hyperion going forward. Furthermore, device configuration is blocked, if the environment does not allow it.

Added:

Script to change the user Hyperion is executed with.

To run Hyperion with root privileges (e.g. for WS281x) execute

sudo updateHyperionUser -u root

Gif effects can source Gifs via URLs in addition to local files as input

System info screen: Added used config path and "is run under root/admin"

LED-Device enhancements

WS281x: Ensure that a device cannot be configured via the UI when Hyperion is not run with root privileges

Nanoleaf: Support discovering additional Nanoleaf devices, e.g. Shapes

Nanoleaf: Ability to restore state when Hyperion stops streaming

Note: In case previous state was a dynamic/temporary effect, the state cannot be restored

Nanoleaf: New Feature: allow to overwrite brightness by Hyperion

Changed:

The Systemd/Upstart/System-V-Init service registers Hyperion under the name hyperion instead of hyperiond, as this has caused confusion among users in the past.

WLED and UDP-Raw: Limit maximum LEDs number to 490

WS281x: Update DMA default as per rpi_ws281x recommendation

Smoothing is paused when no input source is available (to save resources)

Disable LED update streaming, if LED updates are not required, Sync. Video-Streaming between Layout and Simulation

Load configuration of last instance used when loading the UI page, Streamline API requests to avoid unnecessary invocations (#1311)

BobLight: Priorities are not limited any longer. BobLight can feed Priorities [2-253], default is still 128 (#1269)

Amlogic grabber: Limit grabber to 30fps during discovery

Amlogic grabber: Continuous image feed even when paused (to not have LEDs switched off), plus no delay when pausing/unpausing

Fixed:

Fixed that Smoothing with "Continuous Updates" disabled does not provides LED updates (#1068, #1240)

Fixed Issue Blinking / flickering cursor with QT screen capture on Windows (#1328)

Fixed Colour effect priority is not deleted when Colorpicker is open (double click on delete is required)

Fixed reuse local SSDP address (#1324)

Exclude FB Grabber on Amlogic platform, as FB is included in Amlogic Grabber

Escape XSS payload to avoid execution (#1292)

Include libqt5sql5-sqlite packaging dependency

Fixed embedded Python location (#1109)

LED-Devices

Fixed Philips Hue wizard (#1276)

Fixed AtmoOrb wizard

Fixed that Lightpack device does not core when lack of permissions error (LIBUSB_ERROR_ACCESS)

Fixed Atmo/Karate LED count constraint handling

Fixed Hue, Disable LED general options (HW Led count & RGB Byte order) as calculated

Fixed SPI, Tpm2.Net - Memory issues

Fixed: Nanoleaf does not turn on

Fixed LED layout - Additional parameters for classic layout were not saved (#1314)

Fixed Network LED-Device UI: Trigger getProperties for the configured host, when no hosts were discovered

Removed:

Smoothing: Removed "Continuous Updates" flag as it is obsolete.

In case an LED-device requires continuous updates, use the LED-Device's "Rewrite Time" parameter.

The focus of this release is on user experience.

We tried as much as possible supporting you in getting valid setup done, as well as providing enough room for expert users to tweak configurations here and there.

The reworked dashboard provides you now with the ability to control individual components, jump to key configuration items, as well as to switch between LED instances easily.

The refined color coding in the user-interfaces, helps you to quickly identify instance specific and global configuration items.

Of course, the release brings new features (e.g. USB Capture on Windows), as well as minor enhancements and a good number of fixes.

Note:

IMPORTANT: Due to the rework of the grabbers, both screen- and video grabbers are disabled after the upgrade to the new version.

Please, re-enable the grabber of choice via the UI, validate the configuration and save the setup. The grabber should then restart.

Hyperion packages can now be installed under Ubuntu (x64) and Debian (amd64/armhf) (incl. Raspberry Pi OS) via our own APT server.

Details about the installation can be found in the installation.md and at apt.hyperion-project.org.
