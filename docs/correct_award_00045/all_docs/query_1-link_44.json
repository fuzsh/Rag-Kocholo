Dr. Vincent Chiappinelli became chair in 1997, and has worked to further expand the Departmentâ€™s strengths in neuropharmacological, and cardiovascular and cancer research, while continuing the long tradition of excellent teaching to professional, graduate and undergraduate students. In 2004 we merged with Physiology to become the Department of Pharmacology and Physiology."
