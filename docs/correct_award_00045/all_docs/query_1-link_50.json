His work provided an increased understanding of how the reuptake of neurotransmitters function, and prompted a field of research on the role of brain chemistry in psychiatry, forming the basis for current treatments for depression and anxiety disorders. Dr. Axelrod was the first NIMH intramural scientist and the second NIH intramural scientist to win a Nobel Prize. His effort began a tradition of award-winning NIMH research that continues to this day. #shareNIMH\".",
