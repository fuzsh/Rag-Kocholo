        "text": "(2 of 4)\n\nECONOMICS: Sir Arthur Lewis, 64 (British), and Theodore Schultz, 77 (U.S.), for their work on the economic problems of developing nations. Lewis, born on the island of St. Lucia in the British West Indies, is the first black to win a Nobel other than the Peace Prize. He was the first president of the Caribbean Development Bank, has been an adviser to many developing countries, including Ghana, Nigeria and Jamaica, and wrote the classic The Theory of Economic Growth. Schultz did his earliest scholarly work on the problems of U.S. agriculture in the Depression era, and has advised many developing countries, urging them to stress agriculture rather than overly ambitious industrialization.\n\nCHEMISTRY: Herbert C. Brown, 67 (U.S.), and Georg Wittig, 82 (German), for development of organic compounds that have led to the production of hundreds of vital chemical products, from Pharmaceuticals to pesticides. Brown developed a new family of compounds called organoboranes, which have become versatile tools in the synthesis of new chemicals. Wittig is best known for his Wittig reaction, which enabled chemists to link carbon and phosphorus to produce new, biologically active substances, including vitamin A.\n\nWhy the American pre-eminence in the Nobel science prizes? The answer seems to be moneyÂ—and freedom, both personal and academic. Impressed by the great success of the partnership between Government and science during World War II, Washington continued an abundant flow of grants during the postwar era. Few questions were asked, few strings attached. Just do your thing, the bounteous Government seemed to say, and it was done, often magnificently.\n\nA certain generosity of spirit accompanied the Government's monetary largesse. There was no presumption that bureaucracy knows best; for the most part, bureaucracy kept hands off. Scientists were driven to probe the secrets of the universe not just by a compelling curiosity but by the heady air of freedom. \"There's no magic,\" says Julius Axelrod, who won the Nobel Prize for Medicine in 1970. \"It has something to do with the whole spirit of independence from the beginning of the American idea.\"\n\nThat same freedom boosted American science in another way; it attracted many talented foreigners to the U.S. The role in American science of refugees from Nazi tyranny can scarcely be exaggerated.\n\nAn example is Arno Penzias, who fled from Germany in 1938 and shared the 1978 Nobel Prize for Physics. Says he: \"In the U.S., there's diversity, intellectual freedom and opportunity. It's a place where energy can flourish.\""
