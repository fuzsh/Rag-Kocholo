Dr. Taylor is the Sandra and Monroe Trout Chair in Pharmacology, Associate Vice Chancellor for Health Sciences and Dean of the Skaggs School of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences at the University of California, San Diego. The Julius Axelrod Award in Pharmacology was established to honor the memory of the eminent American pharmacologist who shaped the fields of neuroscience, drug metabolism and biochemistry. The Award is given to recognize outstanding scientific contributions in research and mentoring.\n\nDr. Taylor received his Ph.D., from the University of Wisconsin. An NIH Fellowship at the Medical Research Council in England and later at the Max Planck Institute in Germany was followed by an appointment as Assistant Professor in Pharmacology at UCSD.\n\nDr. Taylor has made pioneering contributions to the study of synaptic pharmacology and neuroscience by providing detailed molecular insights into fundamental aspects of regulation at cholinergic synapse. Cholinergic neurons serve critical roles in controlling communication between nerve and muscle and between cells in the brain. His recent work on neuroligin, a cholinesterase homologous synaptic adhesion protein associated with autism emphasizes further the biomedical relevance of his research and demonstrates his characteristic use of multifaceted approaches to dissect structure and molecular mechanisms. Dr. Taylor has trained a multitude of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows who have gone on to prominent careers in industry and academia. He is the director of a large and longstanding NIH funded pre-doctoral training grant in Pharmacology and is a dedicated to graduate and medical school teaching. He has served in various leadership positions at including President of ASPET from 1995-1996.\n\nDr. Taylor delivered the Julius Axelrod Lecture at the 2010 Experimental Biology Meeting.\n\nJohn Jacob Abel Award\n\nJohn J. Tesmer\n\nUniversity of MIchigan\n\nJohn J.G. Tesmer, Ph.D., Associate Professor of Pharmacology and Research Associate Professor of the Life Sciences Institute at the University of Michigan is the recipient of the 2009 John J. Abel Award, sponsored by Eli Lilly & Co. The Award is given to a single young investigator for original, outstanding research contributions in the field of pharmacology.\n\nDr. Tesmer received his B.A. degree in Biochemistry and English from Rice University where he performed undergraduate research in the growing field of macromolecular crystallography. This experience led him obtain advanced training in crystallography at Purdue where he earned his Ph.D. He went on to become a Howard Hughes Postdoctoral Fellow at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center where he studied the molecular basis of heterotrimeric G protein signaling, such as that mediated between G proteins and the classic effector enzyme adenylyl cyclase. He continued his studies of heterotrimeric G proteins as an Assistant Professor of Chemistry at the University of Texas at Austin. During this time, he received several scientific awards and also established himself as a successful educator, earning the 2004College of Natural Sciences Teaching Excellence Award. In 2005, Dr. Tesmer was recruited to the Life Sciences Institute and the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Michigan where he has diversified his research projects not only to resolve the atomic structures of large signaling complexes but also to test hypotheses derived from these structures using a broad range of biochemical, biophysical, and genetic tools. In honor of his recent accomplishments, Dr. Tesmer was the recipient of the 2008 Basic Science Award from the University of Michigan Medical School.\n\nDr. Tesmer has consistently made seminal contributions to our understanding of the mechanism of action and structural biology of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling cascade. GPCRs are the targets of a large fraction of the drugs currently on market and control a vast range of physiologically important processes ranging from cardiovascular tone to vision. Knowledge of these structures and mechanisms of the proteins found in these cascades opens up new opportunities for the design or discovery of novel therapeutic agents.\n\nTorald Sollmann Award\n\nS.J.
