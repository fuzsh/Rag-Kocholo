        "text": "The event is held in honor of Dr. Julius Axelrod to commemorate his monumental contributions to the fields of pharmacology and neuroscience as well as to recognize the Society for Neuroscience (SfN) Annual Axelrod Prize Recipient.\n\nAbout Julius Axelrod\n\nJulius Axelrod was a long-time member of SfN and shared the 1970 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for his discovery of the actions of neurotransmitters in regulating the metabolism of the nervous system. His well-known work on brain chemistry led to current treatments for depression and anxiety disorders and played a key role in the discovery of the pain-relieving properties of acetaminophen. Throughout his career, Axelrod mentored dozens of young scientists, many of whom have gone on to have distinguished careers in neuroscience and pharmacology. He died in 2004 at age 92.\n\nSfN Julius Axelrod Prize Recipients\n\n2023 – Mark Bear, Ph.D. & Raymond Dingledine, Ph.D.\n\n2022 – Marina Wolf, Ph.D.\n\n2021 – David Ginty, Ph.D.\n\n2020 – Morgan Sheng, M.B.B.S., Ph.D.\n\n2019 – Huda Akil, Ph.D.\n\n2018 – Stephan Waxman, M.D., Ph.D.\n\n2017 – Moses V.
