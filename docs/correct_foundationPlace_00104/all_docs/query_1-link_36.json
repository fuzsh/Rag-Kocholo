        "text": "Last Revised: February 2012* <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>PABP</strong> <strong>Validated</strong> <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Applications</strong> The following <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>PABP</strong> <strong>Validated</strong> <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Applications</strong> have been assessed for compliance with the <strong>Payment</strong> Application Best Practices (<strong>PABP</strong>). Only those versions <strong>of</strong> the application identified in the listing below have been evaluated and determined to comply with <strong>PABP</strong>. Compliance with the <strong>PABP</strong> is determined based upon data and information developed by an evaluation <strong>of</strong> the application by a Qualified <strong>Payment</strong> Application Security Company (QPASC). Although <strong>Visa</strong> reviews the QPASC-developed data and information, <strong>Visa</strong> does not independently confirm such data or information nor does <strong>Visa</strong> perform any tests or analysis <strong>of</strong> the functionality, performance or suitability <strong>of</strong> any <strong>of</strong> the applications and/or products listed. <strong>Visa</strong> makes no endorsement or recommendation <strong>of</strong> applications or products, or <strong>of</strong> their respective developers or distributors. Furthermore, <strong>Visa</strong> makes no warranties, guarantees or representations that any <strong>of</strong> the applications or products will meet your requirements for performance or functionality, that the applications or products will be free from errors or malicious code, or that the applications or products will be compatible with any other systems or applications. Any and all representations or warranties, including any and all representations and warranties made by the payment application vendor, are disclaimed by <strong>Visa</strong>. The information provided herein is provided “AS IS” with no warranties, expressed or implied, including, but not limited to, the implied warranties <strong>of</strong> merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose and/or non-infringement. The information provided herein is subject to change by <strong>Visa</strong>, with or without notice. Although <strong>Visa</strong> makes good faith efforts to provide accurate and complete information, merchants, or anyone else utilizing the information set forth on the following <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>PABP</strong> <strong>Validated</strong> <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Applications</strong> remain responsible for confirming the accuracy <strong>of</strong> the information set forth below, including but not limited to, confirming with the appropriate payment application vendor that the version <strong>of</strong> the application identified below is in compliance with <strong>PABP</strong>. Use <strong>of</strong> any one or more <strong>of</strong> the applications below (i) does not guarantee or ensure compliance with the PCI DSS; and (ii) does not satisfy any Acquirers’ obligation to perform their own evaluation and due diligence, to ensure the PCI DSS compliance <strong>of</strong> their merchants and agents. PA-DSS <strong>Validated</strong> <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Applications</strong> In 2008, the PCI Security Standards Council (PCI SSC) adopted <strong>Visa</strong>’s <strong>PABP</strong> and released the standard as the <strong>Payment</strong> Application Data Security Standard (PA-DSS). The PCI SSC is responsible for maintaining and updating the PA-DSS and all related documentation, <strong>Payment</strong> Application Qualified Security Assessor (PA-QSA) qualification and training, Reports <strong>of</strong> Validation (ROV) submissions and quality assurance as well as the listing <strong>of</strong> PA-DSS validated payment applications. The PA-DSS now replaces <strong>PABP</strong> for the purpose <strong>of</strong> <strong>Visa</strong>’s compliance program. For more information on the PA-DSS, including program and validation requirements please visit the PCI SSC website at www.pcisecuritystandards.org. For PCI SSC’s <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> PA-DSS <strong>Validated</strong> <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Applications</strong> please visit: www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/vpa/ * Revisions <strong>of</strong> the list since December 2008 include existing <strong>PABP</strong> validated vendor name and product name corrections only. All new assessments should undergo PA-DSS validation by a PA-QSA and listing with the PCI SSC. <strong>List</strong> <strong>of</strong> <strong>PABP</strong> <strong>Validated</strong> <strong>Payment</strong> <strong>Applications</strong> © 2009 <strong>Visa</strong> Inc. 1"
