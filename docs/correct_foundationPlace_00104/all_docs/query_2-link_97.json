        "text": "Amount of information available today on the web is astounding and it is ever-expanding. For example, there are more than 1.94 billion websites that are linked with the World Wide Web and search engines (e.g., Google, Bing, etc.) can go through those links and serve useful information with great precision and speed. In most of those successful search engines, the most important denominator is the use of Knowledge Graphs. Not only search engines, social network sites (e.g., Facebook, etc.), e-commerce sites (e.g., Amazon, etc.) are also using Knowledge Graphs to store and retrieve useful information.\n\nA Brief History\n\nIn 1960, Semantic Networks were invented to address the growing need for a knowledge representation framework that can capture a wide range of entities — real-world objects, events, situations or abstract concepts and relations and in the end can be applied to extended English Dialogue tasks. The main idea behind Semantic Networks was to capture a wide range of issues which includes the representation of plans, actions, time, individuals’ beliefs and intentions, and be general enough to accommodate each issue.\n\nAccording to Wikipedia, in late 1980, two Netherlands universities started a project called Knowledge Graph which was kind of a semantic network, but with some added restrictions to facilitate algebraic operations on the graph.\n\nIn 2001, Tim Berners-Lee coined the term Semantic Web which is an application of Semantic Network combined with the Web.\n\nTim Berners-Lee stated that “The Semantic Web is an extension of the current web in which information is given well-defined meaning, better enabling computers and people to work in cooperation.”\n\nIn 2012, Google named its Knowledge Graph as Knowledge Graph.\n\nAn Undefined Definition\n\nEvery Company/Group/Individual creates their own version of the Knowledge Graph to limit complexity and organize information into data and knowledge. For example, Google’s Knowledge Graph, Knowledge Vault, Microsoft’s Satori, Facebook’s Entities Graph, etc.\n\nSo, there is no formal definition of Knowledge Graph. In a broader perspective, a Knowledge Graph is a variant of semantic network with added constraints whose scope, structure, characteristics and even uses are not fully realized and in the process of development.\n\nAn Example of Knowledge Graph\n\nWhy Should You Get Excited?\n\nWith every passing year, Machine Learning and Knowledge Representation Learning on Knowledge Graphs are advancing rapidly, both in scale and depth, but in different directions. On one hand, Machine Learning techniques are getting better at performing various tasks (e.g., Classification, Generation, etc.) on a variety of datasets with great precision and recall. On the other hand, Knowledge Representation brings the ability to represent entities and relations with high reliability, explainability, and reusability. Recent advances in Knowledge Representation Learning include mining logical rules from the graph.\n\nHowever, bringing knowledge graphs and machine learning together will systematically improve the accuracy of the systems and extend the range of machine learning capabilities. For example, results inferred from Machine Learning models will have better explainability and trustworthiness.\n\nBelow are some of the opportunities that can be availed by bringing Knowledge Graph to Machine Learning:\n\nData Insufficiency\n\nHaving a sufficient amount of data to train a machine learning model is very important. In the case of sparse data, Knowledge Graph can be used to augment the training data, e.g., replacing the entity name from original training data with an entity name of a similar type. This way a huge number of both positive and negative examples can be created using Knowledge Graph.\n\nZero-Shot Learning\n\nToday, the main challenge with a Machine Learning model is that without a properly trained data it can not distinguish between two data points. In Machine Learning, this is considered as Zero-Shot Learning problem. This is where knowledge graphs can play a very big role. The induction from the Machine Learning model can be complemented with a deduction from the Knowledge Graph, e.g., with pictures where the type of situation did not appear in the training data.\n\nExplainability\n\nOne of the major problems in machine learning industry is explaining the predictions made by machine learning systems. One issue is the implicit representations causing the predictions from the machine learning models. Knowledge Graph can alleviate this problem by mapping the explanations to some proper nodes in the graph and summarizing the decision-taking process.\n\nNote: The above opportunities are explained in more detail in the seminar report of Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web (Dagstuhl Seminar 18371)\n\nSome Use Cases\n\nQuestion — Answering is one of the most used applications of Knowledge Graph. Knowledge Graphs contain a wealth of information and question answering is a good way to help end-users to more effectively and also more efficiently retrieve information from Knowledge Graphs.\n\nStoring Information of Research is another useful application Knowledge Graph. Recently, a lot of companies are using Knowledge Graph to store information generated from various stages of research which can be used for building accessible models, risk management, process monitoring, etc.\n\nNetflix uses a Knowledge Graph to store a vast amount of varied information for its Recommendation System which helps in finding relationships between movies, TV shows, persons, etc. Later, these relationships can be used to predict what customers might like to watch next.\n\nSupply Chain Management is also being benefited from the use of Knowledge Graph. Companies can easily keep track of inventories of different components, personnel involved, time, etc which allows them to move items more swiftly and cost-effectively.\n\nand many more…\n\nOpen Challenges\n\nA coherent set of best practices, that can be applied during the creation of knowledge graphs, will be helpful in understanding and reuse of Knowledge Graphs amongst engineers, developer, and researchers.\n\nGiven a set of unstructured data and Knowledge Graph, the problem of knowledge integration is to identify whether the entities mentioned in the data match with the real world entities present in Knowledge Graph. Although this problem can be solved using machine learning algorithms, the outcome of those algorithms directly depends on the quality of the training data. Given a wide variety of dataset, knowledge integration becomes quite difficult.\n\nKnowledge is not static, but constantly evolving. For example, if a Knowledge Graph keeps track of patients’ health, the data stored at a particular moment could be false for some later moment. So, how do we capture this evolving nature of knowledge?\n\nHow to evaluate a Knowledge Graph? Which quality improvement (e.g., completeness, correctness, linkage, etc.) is more important?\n\nAcknowledgments"
