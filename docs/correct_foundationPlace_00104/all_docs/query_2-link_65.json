For example, if the type of entity represents a company, the display expression might show the company's name.\n\nThe Overview tab in the record view is active by default and shows a preview of the entity’s properties and relationships. The One-hop Neighbor Link Chart displays the entity and its relationships. If the entity is spatial and has a geometry, a map of the entity’s location is displayed.\n\nAll properties of the selected entity are listed. For example, an entity of type Company might have properties such as company name and the year it was established. Property names appear in the Names column, the property's data type appears in the Type column, and property values appear in the Value column. If the year it was established is unknown and a value has not been set for this property, <Null> appears in the Value column.\n\nAll relationships defined between the selected item and other entities in the knowledge graph are listed. Each relationship's type appears in the Relationship column. The entity with which the selected item is associated is shown in the Entity column.\n\nFor example, if the selected entity is of type Company, it might have a relationship such as WorksFor. An expression identifying the employee entity appears in the Name column.\n\nSimilarly, if the selected entity has the type Company, it might have multiple WorksFor relationships listed in various rows in which each row identifies an employee. An expression identifying each Person entity will appear in the Name column of the appropriate row.\n\nYou can navigate to connected relationships and entities through the relationships table in the record view.\n\nClick a relationship in the Relationship column of the relationships table to navigate to a relationship.\n\nClick an entity in the Name column of the relationships table to navigate to a related entity.\n\nThe selected record opens in the knowledge graph view.\n\nAll properties of the selected relationship are listed. For example, a WorksFor relationship might have properties such as start date and position. Property names appear in the Name column, the property's data type appears in the Type column, and property values appear in the Value column. If a property's value is unknown and has not been set, <Null> appears in the Value column."
