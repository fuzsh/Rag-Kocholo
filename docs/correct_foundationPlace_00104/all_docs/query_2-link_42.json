        "text": "Knowledge Graph, our graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), anchors your generative AI solutions directly in your company's data. By creating a Knowledge Graph filled with trusted data and source materials, you can be confident that your people are getting the correct information.\n\nP.S. Trying to learn how to use Knowledge Graph? See our article here.\n\nIn this article:\n\nPrepare to deploy Knowledge Graph\n\nHow to create a new Knowledge Graph\n\nHow to manually upload files to your graph\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nPrepare to deploy Knowledge Graph\n\nThere are 4 key steps to complete prior to deploying Knowledge Graph at your organization:\n\nIdentify the core use cases you want to start with\n\nIdentify the appropriate users to manage your Knowledge Graphs\n\nMap the files and data sources you need to include\n\nEmploy data hygiene and identify the right version of files\n\nIdentify the core use cases you want to start with\n\nKnowledge Graph supports question-answering at scale. Knowledge Graph will be able to interpret the specifics of your question, retrieve the relevant pieces of information, and use advanced skills to construct a response that addresses your question. Learn more about the types of questions Knowledge Graph can answer in the Frequently asked questions section below.\n\nKnowledge Graphs are built for a specific Team in your workspace. What kinds of questions do members of this Team need to be able to answer?\n\nSome examples include:\n\nSupport: access knowledge base and provide answers on plans & products\n\nSales/Business development: identify proposals which have answered similar questions or tackled similar SOWs in the past to speed up the drafting of a new proposal\n\nSales enablement: find relevant customer references, quotes, statistics\n\nResearch: learn insights about a subject based on technical documents (medical research, financial documents, scientific papers, etc)\n\nIdentify the appropriate users to manage your Knowledge Graphs\n\nOnly org or team admins can create Knowledge Graphs or upload files into them.\n\nThe org admin or team admin should be able to:\n\nAccess and identify accurate, up-to-date files\n\nVerify accuracy of outputs - If we ask, \"what was the expected answer?\" you should be able to respond\n\nHere is what each access role type can do in a Knowledge Graph:\n\nOrg admin Team admin Team member Create a new Knowledge Graph Create a new Knowledge Graph - Upload files to a Knowledge Graph Upload files to a Knowledge Graph - Delete files from a Knowledge Graph Delete files from a Knowledge Graph - Download files from the sources cited in an Ask Writer response Download files from the sources cited in an Ask Writer response - Submit a query to a Knowledge Graph via Ask Writer and receive a response with sources cited Submit a query to a Knowledge Graph via Ask Writer and receive a response with sources cited Submit a query to a Knowledge Graph via Ask Writer and receive a response with sources cited\n\nMap the files and data sources you need to include\n\nWhat data sources are being used by your colleagues today to answer the kinds of questions you expect them to ask your Knowledge Graph?\n\nIs there any data that should be excluded? Garbage in, garbage out applies: make sure you're only uploading content that is relevant and trustworthy.\n\nEmploy data hygiene and identify the right version of files\n\nAs mentioned above, the answers you get from your Knowledge Graph can only be as good as the data which feeds them. If you have multiple versions of your company's pricing plans going back to 2008, and you upload all of them into Knowledge Graph, your sales team is likely to pull up outdated information. Make sure all of the information added to your Knowledge Graph is up-to-date and relevant to the use cases for that specific team.\n\nHow to create a new Knowledge Graph\n\nKnowledge Graphs are created on a per-team basis. If your account doesn’t have multiple teams, your Knowledge Graph will be assigned to the default workspace, available to all users.\n\nSelect the Team for which you want to create a Knowledge Graph. If your account doesn’t have multiple teams, your Knowledge Graph will be assigned to the default team.\n\nUnder Setup, select Knowledge Graph and select the + plus sign next to New Graph.\n\nGive your new Knowledge Graph a name, then select a file connection type.\n\nSelecting the … menu next to the name of a Knowledge Graph will allow the admin to rename or delete the Knowledge Graph.\n\nCreating multiple Knowledge Graphs\n\nCan I create multiple Knowledge Graphs for the same team?\n\nYes. In the example above, the team Documentation has created multiple Knowledge Graphs (”KG App Library” and “KG Documentation”). Selecting a Knowledge Graph from the dropdown menu will allow the admin to manage the files within that Graph.\n\nCan I create different Knowledge Graphs for different teams in my workspace?\n\nYes - this is encouraged! Different teams need access to different critical information. In the screenshot above, the Sales team is in the same account as the Documentation team above. They've created two Knowledge Graphs for themselves (”KG Sales onboarding” and “KG Sales Demo”).\n\nHow many different Knowledge Graphs can I create?\n\nYou can create up to 5 Knowledge Graphs per team workspace. For example, you could create 5 Knowledge Graphs for your Support team, and 5 Knowledge Graphs for your Sales team.\n\nHow to manually upload files to your Knowledge Graph\n\nSelect Upload files. You can use the command button to select and upload multiple files at once. Once you select Open, Writer will process your files and display them in a menu.\n\nWriter will display your uploaded files with columns for Name, Status, Added by, and Date added.\n\nYou can select the Status header to filter by file status. The four status options are:\n\nProcessing - Writer is mapping your file into your Knowledge Graph. No action is necessary at this time - just sit tight!\n\nQueued - Writer has not yet mapped your file into your Knowledge Graph. No action is necessary at this time.\n\nErrored - There’s been an issue uploading your file. First, try to upload the file again. If you encounter the same status, reach out to your Technical Account Manager.\n\nCompleted - The file has been uploaded into your Knowledge Graph and is available to be used.\n\nSelecting the … menu next to a file offers the admin the ability to download or delete the file from the Knowledge Graph.\n\nFrequently asked questions\n\nKnowledge Graph capabilities\n\nWhat’s the difference between Knowledge Graph and other types of AI-powered search?\n\nKnowledge Graph serves a wider breadth and more advanced use cases than AI-powered search. AI-powered search is best suited for simple Q&A, with discrete, specific answers (”What is the annual price of our Premium subscription?”). Knowledge Graph can answer these questions, but also answer more advanced questions which require analysis, interpretation, and summarization (”Which Premium subscription features would be most valuable to this user?”). Knowledge Graph doesn’t just find all of the relevant data, it composes a complete, well-reasoned answer and cites its sources.\n\nWhen should users ask Knowledge Graph versus uploading files to Ask Writer?\n\nThe user already knows which file the answer is located in. Ask Writer The answer can be generated using 1-3 source files, of less than 5,000 total words. The source files are immediately available. Ask Writer The user does not know which file the answer is located in. Knowledge Graph The type of question requires accessing lots of varied source data. Knowledge Graph The answer requires using sources longer than 5,000 total words. Knowledge Graph The answer doesn't have one straightforward answer, but requires reading multiple sources to decide which one best helps answer the question. Knowledge Graph\n\nCan Knowledge Graph do math?\n\nNo, Knowledge Graph cannot perform numerical analysis. It can retrieve pieces of data, but it cannot perform calculations to produce numbers that aren’t in the original source. For example, if the file above were uploaded into a graph, a user could ask, “How many ThingyMajiggs did we sell in October?” and receive the right answer. However, a user could not ask “How much revenue did we generate from ThingyMajigg sales in October” because Knowledge Graph cannot calculate independently.\n\nIf there are multiple, conflicting answers to a question, how does Knowledge Graph know which source to pick?\n\nBy default, Knowledge Graph will rely on the source from whichever file was uploaded most recently. However, this is why data hygiene is crucial - you don’t want price sheets from 2021 floating around if your sales team is providing quotes based on Knowledge Graph data!\n\nIf you ask Knowledge Graph the same question multiple times, will Knowledge Graph return the same answer?\n\nEach time you ask a question, Knowledge Graph will pull the relevant information and compose an answer. It might be worded slightly differently, but as long as the underlying files are the same, the data referenced should be the same.\n\nFile uploading\n\nWhat file types does Knowledge Graph support?\n\nYou can upload pdf, txt, doc/docx, ppt/pptx, eml, html, srt, csv, or xls/xlsx files.\n\nHow many files can I add to a Knowledge Graph? Is there a size limit?\n\nFor a manual upload connection, an admin can upload up to 50GB of files per Knowledge Graph.\n\nCan I upload files to multiple Knowledge Graphs at once?\n\nNo, a file can only be added to a single Knowledge Graph at a time. It doesn’t matter whether the Knowledge Graphs are associated with the same Team spaces.\n\nCan other teams see what I’ve uploaded into different Knowledge Graphs?\n\nOnly the members of a specific Team can see what has been loaded into that Knowledge Graph. For example, if someone is a member of both the Sales team and the Customer Success team in your workspace, they will only be able to retrieve information from your Sales Knowledge Graph if they are currently working within the Sales team space.\n\nIf I delete or rename a manually updated file in one Knowledge Graph, will it be deleted or renamed in other Knowledge Graphs at the same time?\n\nEach Knowledge Graph is separate. What happens in one Knowledge Graph doesn’t affect another Knowledge Graph.\n\nWhat’s the best way to keep my manually uploaded Knowledge Graph files up-to-date?\n\nAs a best practice, name your files with the date of their most recent review. On a regular basis, you can review anything with a given date stamp (example: search “2023”) to see whether a new version needs to be uploaded. If the information is still up-to-date, rename the file to reflect the most recent review."
