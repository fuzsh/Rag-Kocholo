        "text": "You will have heard about the up and coming trend of knowledge graphs in enterprises. Do you want to see how this powerful technology impacts the way to innovate and work with data? Then you will be sorry to have missed this year’s Knowledge Graph Conference at Columbia University (7th-8th of May). It were the organizers Francois Scharffe (Columbia University) and Juan F. Sequeda (Capsenta) who brought together the leading heads of knowledge graph research and execution. And what a fantastic job they have done.\n\nWe heard from financial services and industry leaders on how they leverage knowledge graphs to address their digitalization challenges. We learned about a wide range of use cases spanning risk management and fraud detection to compliance to the training of AI. People definitely were eager to see the real-world implications of this impending data management paradigm shift. Practitioners from industrial giants like Google, Uber, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Capital One, and Pratt & Wittney were lined up to showcase their learnings and successes at the Knowledge Graph Conference 2019.\n\nThe use cases presented were very real and pressing. Presenters explained why a graph approach was instrumental to the success of their respective projects. Both eccenca founders, CEO Chris Brockmann and renowned semantics researcher Prof. Dr. Soeren Auer, were honored to add more color to the emerging picture. Prof. Dr. Soeren Auer (co-creator of DBpedia) gave a deep dive into the linked data fundamentals. The audience got hands-on insights on how solutions like eccenca Corporate Memory enable companies to accelerate their digital maturity.\n\nWhile Soeren presented the foundation for intelligent data management, Chris took it to the shop floor. Citing ongoing projects with Siemens, Bosch and Nokia he explained why knowledge graphs are the go-to tool for any CIO and Chief Supply Chain Officer. Chris supported his message with a case study detailing the digital maturity journey of leading telecom infrastructure manufacturer RFS. The developer of 5G technology and radio-frequency eco-systems started implementing the concept of “business digital twins” in 2018. The concept proposes a knowledge graph based light weight representation of a company’s core business objects “product”, “process”, “partners” and “people”. As Chris pointed out, RFS were able to get immediate business benefits throughout every step of their journey increasing data transparency and agility (read the case study).\n\nThe results found within the RFS case study are well aligned with the insights executives from Google, Uber and others shared with the attentive audience. They made the point that there is no alternative to knowledge graphs to stay ahead of the data curve. So if you are interested to learn more about this exciting technology, look out for the 2020 edition of The Knowledge Graph Conference at Columbia University. See you next year, when – as Francois is already predicting from this year’s data – it’s gonna be even bigger and better.\n\nAll photos by Darma Saputra, used with permission."
