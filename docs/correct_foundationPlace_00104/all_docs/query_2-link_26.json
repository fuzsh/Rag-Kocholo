        "text": "In this article you’ll learn the simple 3-step Kalicube Process for getting into Google’s Knowledge Graph.\n\nGoogle uses its Knowledge Graph in most of its algorithms, so getting into the Knowledge Graph is vital for any business or person whose audience uses Google.\n\nHow Do I Get Into Google’s Knowledge Graph?\n\nGetting into the Knowledge Graph requires that you follow the Kalicube Process for a Knowledge Panel. If you can trigger a Knowledge Panel algorithmically using our simple 3 step process, then the entity will get into Google’s Knowledge Graph.\n\nNote: at Kalicube we refer to Google’s Knowledge Graph as the Main Knowledge Graph or the Knowledge Vault.\n\nImportantly, you can trigger a Knowledge Panel, but the entity may not appear in the Main Knowledge Graph immediately. There is often a delay – sometimes a year or more. Focus on the Knowledge Panel, and the Main Knowledge Graph will look after itself.\n\nThe Simple Kalicube Process to Get Into Google’s Knowledge Graph\n\nKalicube gives you a simple 3-step process to build Google’s confidence in its understanding of who you are and what you do, and influence it to give you your own Knowledge Panel and add you to its Knowledge Graph. Here is an overview:\n\nIdentifying your Entity Home (i.e. the website where you or your named entity has an online presence, such as your website or your official social media page)\n\nGetting significant corroboration from multiple independent and authoritative sources within your industry that confirm the facts about you.\n\nCreate an infinite self-confirming loop from these sources leading back to your Entity Home.\n\nHere are more specific explanations for the following entities:\n\nKnowledge Panel for a Person\n\nKnowledge Panel for a Musician\n\nKnowledge Panel for an Actor\n\nKnowledge Panel for a Visual Artist\n\nKnowledge Panel for an Author\n\nKnowledge Panel for a Music Group\n\nKnowledge Panel for a Company\n\nKnowledge Panel for a Podcast\n\nAs mentioned, focus on getting a Knowledge Panel and, after a while, Google will add the entity to the Knowledge Graph. Be patient, this can take some time (3 months to 2 years).\n\nHow do I Know When an Entity is in Google’s Knowledge Graph ?\n\nMethod 1: Look for a Knowledge Panel on the Brand SERP\n\nWhen you google the entity name, you might see a Knowledge Panel in the Right Rail. Many Knowledge Panels on Google SERPs (Search Engine Results Page) are triggered by a presence in the Knowledge Graph. If an entity is in the Knowledge Graph, it will usually have a Knowledge Panel when you search the name on Google. The opposite is not necessarily true, however, getting a Knowledge Panel does not necessarily mean the entity is in Google’s Main Knowledge Graph since Knowledge Panels are triggered on Google from multiple sources.\n\nAt Kalicube, we have identified 6 Knowledge Graph Verticals that trigger Knowledge Panels. All of them ultimately feed into the Main Knowledge Graph, so getting into any of them will set you on your way. You need to be patient since Google is moving entities to the Main Knowledge Graph slowly (think in terms of months, or even a year or more).\n\nMethod 2: Search Using Google’s Knowledge Graph API\n\nGoogle helpfully makes its Knowledge Graph searchable for companies like Kalicube through an API.\n\nMethod 3: Search Using Kalicube’s Knowledge Graph Explorer\n\nKalicube helpfully offers you a free interface to search in Google’s Knowledge Graph.\n\nPitfalls and Drawbacks When Getting into Google’s Knowledge Graph\n\nThe Process Can be Slow\n\nThe Kalicube Process is reliable and, when implemented fully, will always work. Unfortunately, there are many moving parts and missing an important source of corroboration, or writing an unclear description on the Entity Home can slow things down considerably.\n\nSchema.Org Markup\n\nSchema Markup isn’t necessary to get in Google’s Knowledge Graph. However, it does help enormously. To help you, we offer a free Schema Markup Generator for companies (and for people) that generate the basic Schema Markup you’ll need.\n\nGetting it Wrong Can Set You Back Years\n\nIf you add incorrect information to Google’s Main Knowledge Graph, it is very difficult to correct it. Google is very cautious with its Knowledge Graph, so once it has understood one fact, getting it to change that fact is almost impossible. The only solution is to remove the entity from the Main Knowledge Graph and rebuild it.\n\nAnd that will take twice as long.\n\nAt Kalicube, we have been getting people and companies into Google’s Knowledge Graph since 2013 (several thousand and counting). One thing we frequently need to do is correct inaccurate information in the Knowledge Graph (or Knowledge Panels).\n\nAt Kalicube, we have built our own proprietary platform to overcome both common and uncommon Knowledge Graph and Knowledge Panel problems: Kalicube Pro.\n\nKalicube Can Help You Get a Google Knowledge Panel and Manage it Effectively\n\nWith or without a presence in the Main Knowledge Graph, it is essential for businesses and people to trigger a Knowledge Panel on their Brand SERP (the search result when someone googles your name).A Knowledge Panel represents a stamp of authority from Google and allows your audience to understand you, your brand and your product/service with a simple search. Kalicube offers a done-for-you-service to set up a Knowledge Panel and (of course) get you into the Knowledge Graph. Contact us here to discuss how we can help you."
