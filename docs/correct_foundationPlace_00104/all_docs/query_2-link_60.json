        "text": "Connect and query data of any structure\n\nA Knowledge Graph connects to data sources within your company, enriches the data by finding connections across all sources, and creates a human- and machine-understandable output. Stardog accesses data with Connectors to all major SQL systems and the most popular NoSQL databases. In addition, our BITES pipeline extracts concepts from unstructured data like research papers, resumes, and regulatory documents, further enriching the Knowledge Graph. Access unified data via API or connect to analytics platforms using our BI/SQL Server. Continue reading →\n\nVirtualize or materialize\n\nStardog supports completely seamless virtualization and materialization so you can access any data, whether it’s on-prem or in the cloud. Where other data management tools force you into rigid access patterns, Stardog lets you choose to materialize or virtualize based on what’s best for your data and to optimize for performance or cost requirements. No other platform combines Knowledge Graphs with virtualization; the resulting Virtual Graphs offer unprecedented power and flexibility to investigate deep connections across data sources. Continue reading →\n\nInference Engine for explainable AI\n\nStardog’s Inference Engine allows you to harmonize conflicting data definitions without changing or copying the underlying data. Capture your business and domain rules in the data model; the Inference Engine intelligently applies these rules at query time. This easily solves a common issue — what one database calls a “Major Account” another calls an “Enterprise Customer.” To fix, simply write a rule that states both are subclasses of “Top Accounts” and query the full range of details on your connected data. The Inference Engine displays all logic for each result, making explainable AI a reality. Continue reading →\n\nBuilt-in AI and ML\n\nStardog Voicebox, a knowledge engineer powered by Large Language Models (LLM), simplifies knowledge graph model building and maintenance as well as query writing with plain language instructions from the user. As you build out a knowledge graph and connect to data sources within your company, you enrich the data by finding connections across all sources, creating a human- and machine-understandable output. Stardog’s built-in machine learning offers both similarity search and predictive analytics. Similarity search is an important functionality when coupled with the connected data of a Knowledge Graph, as it can be used for pattern detection and recommendations. Continue reading →\n\nNavigate your data with Explorer\n\nSearch and explore your data fabric without specialized knowledge of a graph query language. Capitalize on your unified data and trace the paths between data points. Stardog Explorer works across virtualized data, finding connections across physically disjointed sources. Answer complex questions like “What does the supply chain look like for this batch of troublesome parts?” or “How are these two financial organizations related to these five transactions and these three shadowy political figures?” Find the shortest route between two data points, unearth links between data no matter their degrees of separation, even determine a connection across your inferred data. Continue reading →\n\nData quality management\n\nStardog offers constraints to help manage and measure the data quality of your Enterprise Knowledge Graph. Enforce constraints to prevent Stardog from accessing incorrect data, to find inconsistencies across your data silos, or to flag conflicting data. Set a constraint that a ship date for a purchase must be after the purchase date; Stardog validates across your point-of-sale and shipping systems to ensure your data is correct. Stardog supports the open standard SHACL, a declarative language for specifying constraints over RDF graphs. Continue reading →\n\nBased on open standards\n\nStardog offers first class support of the SPARQL, SPARQL*, and GraphQL query languages for interacting with your Knowledge Graph. At its core, Stardog is built on the RDF open standards of knowledge representation created by W3C, the same standards body that created the Web. This platform of open standards is designed to represent information — and all its complexities — in a machine-understandable way. As a result, your Knowledge Graph will fundamentally enable greater interoperability and exchange of data. Continue reading →\n\nHigh-performance graph database\n\nStardog’s platform is underpinned by a highly efficient, robust, and ACID-compliant graph database. Ensure near-real time responses on up to 100 billion data points per installation. Stardog supports concurrent reads and writes and our query optimizer can handle your most complex queries, thanks in part to its state-of-the-art cardinality estimation. Scale limitlessly with virtual edges and inter-cluster optimized query federation for scale-out use cases. This gives the users ability to scale out their data fabric up to 1 trillion triples, all while enjoying sub-second query times and up to a 98% cost savings when compared with traditional approaches.
