        "text": "Traditional web search isn't built for business\n\nIt's 2022, and a simple web search for real estate companies in Iceland results in paid ads and irrelevant how-to articles (seriously, give it a try).\n\nThe problem is that the search engine you know and love is built for finding websites, not organizations, people, or news.\n\nResearching companies? Prospecting leads? Monitoring press mentions? That's a job for the Knowledge Graph.\n\nSearch for real results,\n\nnot websites.\n\nIt's simple â Searching for companies? Get companies in results. Searching for people? You get the idea.\n\nOver 10 billion people, companies, products, articles, and discussions exist in the Diffbot Knowledge Graph â the largest in the world. If it's something you can find on a website somewhere, you'll find it (already clean and structured) in the Knowledge Graph.\n\nResults from the Knowledge Graph aren't just a list of names either, they're complete records with 50+ fields and properties.\n\nKnowledge Graph: Search\n\nBuild accurate datasets of news, organizations, and people.\n\nSchedule a Demo\n\nGot data? Enhance it with the Knowledge Graph\n\nAccount-Based Marketing doesn't work without fresh firmographic data. Enrich your lists with 50+ available fields from the Knowledge Graph.\n\nAvailable in your favorite data viz and automation platforms â Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, Tableau, Zapier, and our REST API.\n\nKnowledge Graph: Enhance\n\nEnrich your organizational and people data\n\nSchedule a Demo\n\nRelationship data sourced from the entire public web\n\nOur AI reads the web nonstop so you don't have to. Facts and relationships between entities are pulled out or inferred. Every entry in the KG provides detailed data provenance."
