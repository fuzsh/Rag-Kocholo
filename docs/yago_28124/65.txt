Christian X of Denmark (Christian Carl Frederik Albert Alexander Vilhelm) (September 26, 1870 â€“ April 20, 1947) was King of Denmark 1912-1947 (and of Iceland 1918-1944) He was born at Charlottenlund Palace near Copenhagen.

Christian married Princess Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin in 1898 and she eventually became his Queen Consort They had two children:

Prince Frederik (1899-1972), later King Frederik IX of Denmark

Prince Knud (1900-1976

In contrast to the monarchs of Norway and the Netherlands, who went into exile during the Nazi occupation of their countries, Christian X remained in his capital throughout the occupation of Denmark, being to the Danish people a visible symbol of the national cause. In spite of his age and the precarious situation, he took a daily ride on horseback through his city -- not accompanied by a groom, let alone by a guard.

A full page black and white photograph in which rider and horse filled the entire page appeared in the International Herald Tribune in the early 1980s, showing King Christian X on horseback with a Jewish Star of David on his sleeve. This was a full page paid advertisement of a World War II era photograph that appeared genuine to all readers who saw it. Nonetheless, the story claiming that he wore the star of David when Jews were forced to is apocryphal. It was largely popularized by Leon Uris in his book Exodus. In fact Danish Jews were never forced to wear the star of David in Denmark, so such a demonstration by the ageing king would have been meaningless.
