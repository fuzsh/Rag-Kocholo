Christian X (born Sept. 26, 1870, Charlottenlund, Den.—died April 20, 1947, Copenhagen) was the king of Denmark (1912–47) who symbolized the nation’s resistance to the German occupation during World War II.

The eldest son of the future King Frederick VIII and Louise of Sweden and Norway, Christian became chief of the royal guard in 1898 and married Alexandrine of Mecklenburg-Schwerin. Becoming crown prince in 1906, Christian led the opposition to the sale of the Danish West Indies (now the U.S. Virgin Islands) to the United States, which ultimately took place in 1917. He assumed the throne on his father’s death in 1912.
