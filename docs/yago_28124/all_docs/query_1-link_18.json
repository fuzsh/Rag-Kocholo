Was King of Denmark from 1912 to 1947 and of Iceland between 1918 and 1944 . He was the oldest son and child of King Frederick VIII of Denmark and his wife, Princess Louise, only surviving child of King Charles XV of Sweden. They had two children: Prince Frederick (1899-1972), later King Frederick IX of Denmark and Prince Knud ( 1900 - 1976 ). Being something of an authoritarian and a ruler who strongly stressed the importance of royal dignity and power in an age of growing democracy, Christian X did not seem fit for popularity. However, a reign spanning two world wars and the role he played as a heroic symbol of Danish nationalism and resistance under Nazi rule made him one of the most popular Danish monarchs of modern times .
