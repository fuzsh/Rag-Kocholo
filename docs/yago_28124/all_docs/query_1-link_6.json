        "text": "Here's another one:\n\nQueen Alexandrine of Denmark (Queen Margrethe's grandmother-listed erroneously as Queen Alexandra) with her sister Cecilla, Crown Princess of Germany. Alexandrine was Frederik VIII's daughter-in-law.\n\nhttp://www.royalsportal.de/images/postcards/large/danmark-000019.jpg\n\nPrince Aage again - same picture but with his wife\n\nhttp://www.royalty-postcards.com/Images/Wanted/Denmark/Stender_1143.jpg\n\nThis one I find very charming - Queen Alexandrine with her daughters-in-law - Queen Ingrid (Margrethe's mother) and Princess Caroline Mathilda, Prince Knud's wife. It seems she had a close relationship to her daughters-in-law which I think is sweet.\n\nhttp://www.royalty-postcards.com/Images/Wanted/Denmark/Alexandrine_&_daughters-in-.jpg\n\nYsbel,\n\nDo you own these postcards or are they from some website?\n\nI think the postcard with Prince Aage's wife looks strange! It looks like they took the photo of his wife and placed it beside his photo from the previous postcard. It is very surprising to see his wife with such a big smile on her face! Most photos back then showed people not smiling or smiling slightly. Her smile looks like she is up to something!\n\nThanks for posting these postcards Ysabel. Alexandrine must have had a rather difficult life, with such a husband., But she seems to have been a good influence on him, she was able to calm him most of the time.\n\nI beleive I read a remark about her in the biography of Queen WIlhelmina by Prof. Fasseur, stating that Wilhelmina wasn't too fond of the King (to say the least) but that she was on good terms with his wife.\n\nIn Billed Bladet these past two editions, there have been questions about Princess Helena of Denmark, née Glücksburg, and her German sympathies during the war, which led to her being sent out of Denmark when the peace came - and they also commented on Queen Alexandrine being of German descent, but she had done the complete opposite of her sister-in-law. Alexandrine seemed intent on being Danish during the war.\n\nShe never invited Germans in uniform to her home, even if they were relatives. Relatives could come, if they didn't wear their uniforms. If they were in uniform, they were frozen out. Whilst Helena held soirees for the Germans in uniform.\n\nMarengo said:\n\nWas Helena ever allowed to return to Denmark, after her initial 'banishment'?\n\nPerhaps it also played a role that Helena was a rather dominant character herself, over powering her husband Harald somewhat. While in the marriage of Christian and Alexandrine the roles were reverse.\n\nShe was banished by Christian X in 1945. She was allowed to return when her spouse, Prince Harald, fell ill. (He died in March, 1949, so I presume Helena was allowed to return either this year or the year before.). After her return, she was allowed to live in Denmark again.\n\nThe thing is that as the King is the one with judicial power over the royal family - everything around this banishment was something directly ordered by him.\n\nProbably made for a bit of family-awkwardness as not only was he banishing his brother's wife, but Helena and Harald's daughter, Caroline-Mathilde, had married Christian and Alexandrine's son, Knud.\n\nI think the difficulties for Alexandrine started with the First World War, after all, her sister was Crown Princess of Prussia which probably didn't go over well in some circles.\n\nQueen Alexandrine's grandfather being a Grand Duke of Russia and her father being a German prince, her own family must have been devasted from the two World Wars.\n\nAnd after the wars she would have all this impoverished relations coming over to ask for money. Esp. the Mecklenburg-Schwerin family had a hard time, Queen Wilhlmina provided some money for some of them, so I gather that Alexandrine did too (I don't believe that Christiaan could have been more frugal then his Dutch collegue).\n\nMarengo said:\n\nAnd after the wars she would have all this impoverished relations coming over to ask for money. Esp. the Mecklenburg-Schwerin family had a hard time, Queen Wilhlmina provided some money for certain of them, so I gather that Alexandrine did too (I don't believe that Christiaan could have been more frugal then his Dutch collegue).\n\nWell Christian X was a bit miserly with his own aunt the Dowager Empress of Russia when she came in exile so I don't think he was more generous with his in-laws. But the DRF didn't have that much money to begin with so I don't think it was meanness so much as the fact that he didn't have the money.\n\nAfter WWII Mecklenburg-Schwerin fell under Communist rule and I always wondered what Alexandrine thought about that. She died in 1952 shortly after the end of the war.\n\nI am wondering about that too actually. How was the contact between the Danish RF and Christian-Ludwig and Barbara of Mecklenburg? Did they attend the wedding of CP Margrethe for example?\n\n-\n\nI remember the story about Christiaan warning his aunt Minny not to use to much lights and as a result she ordered all the lights in her part of the palace to be lit. I assume it was a relief on both sides when she left for Hvidore.\n\nMarengo said:\n\nI am wondering about that too actually. How was the contact between the Danish RF and Christian-Ludwig and Barbara of Mecklenburg? Did they attend the wedding of CP Margrethe for example?\n\nYes Christian Ludwigh and Barbara attended the wedding of Margrethe and Henrik as did Louis Ferdinand and Kira of Prussia.\n\nFriedrich Franz of Mecklenburg came to an Visit to his aunt during the war in uniform he was never invited again.\n\nMarengo said:\n\nWas Friedrich Franz a stauinch Nazi supporter or 'just' a soldier'? Was this episode solely responsible for the lack of invitations or had his marriage to a commoner something to do with it too?\n\nDon't know if he was a Nazi-Supporter. As far as i know this epsidoe was why he wasn't invited again.-\n\nMarengo said:\n\nThanks for posting these postcards Ysabel.

I was under the impression that he was warm and friendly, and a father figure to the Danish nation during WWII?!"
