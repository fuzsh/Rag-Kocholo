        "text": "Christian VII (born Jan. 29, 1749, Copenhagen—died March 13, 1808, Rendsburg, Schleswig) was a mentally incompetent king of Denmark and Norway; his reign saw the brief domination of the kingdom by Count Johann Friedrich Struensee.\n\nThe son of Frederick V, Christian VII came to the throne in 1766. His mental instability has been attributed to a brutal childhood governor and to morally corrupt court pages. After his 1766 marriage to Caroline Matilda, the daughter of Frederick, prince of Wales, he gave himself up to debauchery. Christian came under the influence of Struensee when the latter was appointed to accompany him on a 1768–69 European tour. In 1769 Struensee was named court physician and in 1770 a count and privy cabinet minister. Also in 1770, Struensee became the Queen’s lover, for which he was arrested in 1772 on the King’s order and executed. Christian’s other advisers and, after 1784, Crown Prince Frederick then held power."
