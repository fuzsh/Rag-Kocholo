Although he was quite ill he had for some unknown reason gone outside his villa and was found dead in the road at the foot of the 25 feet high wall surrounding the villa.\n\nHowever an article from the NY Times 15 April 1897 reported the official account of his death. Friedrich Franz went into the garden which was his custom when encountering difficulty in breathing.

The article incorrectly refers to Alexandra sister Princess Marie Louise of Hanover (1879-1948) as the princess who died on 4 June 1904. 23.111121 Hereditary Grand Duke Friedrich Franz V of Mecklenburg-Schwerin 1910 2001 Karin Elisabeth von Schaper 1920 2012 The death of Hereditary Grand Duke Friedrich Franz V has brought an end to the Mecklenburg-Schwerin line 23.111122 Duke Christian Ludwig of Mecklenburg-Schwerin 1912 1996 Princess Barbara of Prussia 1920 1994 See 11.21321 - Christian Ludwig was arrested by Soviet troops in 1945 and spent the next 8 years as a prisoner.
