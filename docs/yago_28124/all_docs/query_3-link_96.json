        "text": "Could there be a new royal romance in the air? Prince Christian of Denmark, the eldest son of Crown Prince Frederik and Crown Princess Mary, is said to be captivated by the Italian Princess Maria Chiara di Borbone-Two Sicilies.\n\nRead More\n\nItalian prince will renounce his position at head of the family and pass the title directly to his teenage daughter\n\nPrince Emanuele Filiberto of Savoy announced his daughter, Princess Vittoria, will assume the role as head of the defunct royal family\n\nThe future king of Denmark, who turns 18 in October, was spotted cosying up to ‘Chiara’, 18, at the Monaco Grand Prix. In a group photo posted on Instagram, the photogenic pair are seen standing next to each other, with Chiara’s hand resting on the prince’s shoulder. Chiara’s sister, 19-year-old Princess Maria Carolina stands front and centre, Dior handbag dangling casually by her side.\n\n‘Christian is just four months away from his 18th birthday and he’s interested in having a proper girlfriend, mostly to fend off wannabe fans, but he also likes the idea of having a real companion,’ a Danish source told Woman’s Day. ‘Chiara ticks all the right boxes – she’s funny, intelligent and very well connected via her social media.’ The source seemed to confirm that the two were romantically linked, saying, ‘Christian is definitely taken with Chiara – it remains to be seen if she feels the same. For now, they get along well, both families approve and they have a lot of similar tastes in music, sports and even film.’ The report has not been confirmed by either side.\n\nRead More\n\nBid goodbye to ballet flats, the Venetian furlane is the chicest shoe of the summer\n\nPopularised by the gondoliers of Venice, the furlane has a firm foothold in fashion – just ask Talita von Furstenberg, Alexa Chung and Kate Moss\n\nGrandson of Queen Margrethe II of Denmark, Prince Christian is currently second-in-line to the Danish throne after his father. Princess Maria Chiara di Borbone-Two Sicilies is the youngest daughter of Prince Carlo, Duke of Castro, who is the great-great-great-grandson of Francis II, the last King of the Two Sicilies (Sicily and Naples).\n\nRead More\n\nAffairs, gambling, slander: King Edward VII, the last senior royal to give evidence in court, was far more scandalous than Prince Harry\n\nKing Edward VII, then the Prince of Wales, gave evidence in two 19th-century cases. Today, his descendant Prince Harry appears at the High Court\n\nThe Italian noble family reigned over part of Italy until Italian unification in 1861 and since then, the family has been without a throne. Prince Carlo, or the Duke of Castro, is married to Italian heiress Camilla Crociani. The family live between Monaco, St Tropez, Paris and Rome and are fixtures on the international social circuit. Chiara and her sister often post on social media, documenting glamorous events with European royals, including the Danish Royal Family and Monaco’s Royal Family, the Grimaldis. Crown Princess Mary and Crown Prince Frederik are close friends with the family. Prince Carlo is a godparent of Princess Josephine, their 12-year old daughter who is fifth in line to the Danish throne."
