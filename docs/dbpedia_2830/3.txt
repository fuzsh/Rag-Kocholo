Drammen Train Station is centrally located in downtown Drammen, the capital of Buskerud County, Norway. Opened in 1866, the train station is the terminus for many rail lines and a stopping point for most long-distance trains traveling west and/or south from Oslo. It is an ideal place to start a road trip and begin exploring other areas of Norway. From the train station it's also easy to reach many local attractions, including Drammensbadet, Norway's largest water park, featuring both indoor and outdoor pools.

The true beauty of the area lies in its stunning rivers and hills, thus renting a car from Sixt makes it possible for nature lovers to really see the beauty of the region on scenic drives. Take a drive up Spiralen, a corkscrew tunnel in the hills, and enjoy the magnificent view of the city from its peak. With a car, it's also much easier for visitors to check out other local gems like the Union Brygge neighborhood, which is home to Drammen's library, concert hall and university, as well as a number of boutique shops. Touring the region really couldn't be easier with a car from Sixt!
