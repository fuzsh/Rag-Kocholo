The fact that the speed limit seems to be about 30mph nationally or that the trains run to their own timetable. It feels like a rail network that is in decline and grossly unloved and under invested in.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?\n\nI'd agree on ÖBB, but completely disagree on NS. The train interiors are appalling - stuck in a timewarp (and not a good one) with the horrible plastic seats. Appalling that they've just carried this on with the new (and utterly garbage) ICNG units.\n\nIn my experience, DB are not as bad as everyone makes out - some seriously late running, but the quality of the trains themselves is substantially better than in many other countries - and certainly not a bottom three.\n\nSNCB - very average, like NS, just with added graffiti. They also have a habit of using inappropriate stock on services, e.g. suburban EMUs on the Liege-Luxembourg service, which used to be comfortable loco-hauled stock.\n\nBottom of the pile are those countries with compulsory res long distance trains - so France, Italy and Spain are bottom of the list.\n\nSBB and Rhatische Bahn are top of the pile, based on past experiences.\n\nI'll just take national operators into account as they usually run the majority of services.\n\nTop tier:\n\nSBB: Switzerland is the epitome of perfection, and SBB no less. The train network in Switzerland is extensive, trains are clean, frequent and punctual. Pretty much all intercity trains and up have a restaurant car, and staff are professional and friendly.\n\nCFL: A small network, but generally reliable, comfortable and clean trains, frequent and of course free.\n\nBDZ: From a regular passenger's view this might rather be bottom tier, but from my point of view they're fantastic. They generally have very old but comfortable trains, and for the region they operate in the timetable is not that bad. Services tend to connect pretty well, ticket prices are very low and staff are incredibly friendly and helpful. It's just a blast to be able to ride in one of the many classic old school trains and hang out of the window trundling along among pretty beautiful landscapes most of the time. The network is rather extensive too and they're one of few operators in the Balkan region who at least try to run international services together with their neighbor operators.\n\nDSB: The comfort of their IC3 trains is just amazing. Furthermore the frequencies are decent and staff are professional and friendly. Timekeeping is good too. The network is not the biggest with a lot of it also being lost to other operators but they still cover a big part of Denmark.\n\nČD: Very dense network, with all kinds of interesting trains. Their stock ranges from older soviet-era railbuses to modern Railjet (and now Interjet etc.) and Pendolino trains. Their restaurant car offering is fantastic and the staff is generally friendly and helpful. Frequencies differ but are acceptable most of the time, trains are relatively clean and while delays do occur they almost always hold connections.\n\nMiddle tier:\n\nÖBB: Maybe in the past I would've put them in top tier, but lately they haven't been doing as well as they used to. The rolling stock always looks great and is very comfortable and usually clean enough. However especially stock availability has become an issue lately with IC and EC trains often running without a restaurant car and with fewer cars, resulting in a pretty crowded train. Railjet trains are quite regularly replaced by a replacement train consisting of some of the already sparse IC cars, and Nightjet trains are often missing sleeper cars and massively delayed or canceled with pretty appalling customer service. Staff are okay, except some of the Newrest staff on the Nightjet trains who are not always the friendliest or most professional. Restaurant car offering is great when they do run, albeit a bit on the pricier side.\n\nDB: It's a bit of a love-hate relationship. Punctuality is appalling. Whenever I take a trip through Germany something is bound to go wrong. Trains are often pretty crowded as well. However if the trains do run they are generally pretty comfortable and the network is great and frequent. The ICEs have quite decent restaurant cars (if they're open and stocked), but ICs have nothing anymore... Staff are usually professional and great, especially considering the mess they have to work in everyday.\n\nNS and SNCB/NMBS: I'll put them together as they're quite similar. The network and frequencies are fantastic. On-train amenities are however quite basic, enough for the usually shorter journeys but if you're taking a longer journey such as Amsterdam-Brussels, Amsterdam-Maastricht, Rotterdam-Groningen or Brussels-Luxembourg, it would've been nice if more comfort and catering was offered (and let's not even talk about Liege-Luxembourg which I refuse to do in a Desiro unit). Regarding cleanliness NS is definitely lacking, and should do a better job keeping the trains clean. SNCB/NMBS trains are generally cleaner but graffiti seems to be a bigger problem there.\n\nSŽ: I really enjoy travelling through Slovenia with SŽ and was considering putting them in the top tier list, but frequencies often leave a lot to be desired for this part of Europe, especially on the weekends when barely any local trains are running. Train staff are very strict when it comes to tickets and come through the train to check new passengers everytime, I think this is generally a good thing. The trains are quite interesting and clean and the network is alright.\n\nMÁV: They have quite an extensive network with some pretty impressive stations. Delays are common but usually not too big, trains range from comfortable to not comfortable at all, and from very old to brand new. Frequencies are generally great except on several very rural branch lines. The restaurant car is one of the best in Europe with real cooked meals instead of microwaved food. Train staff are often not fantastic but it differs. They are however very strict, so that's good. Tickets are cheap but the mandatory reservations can be a bit confusing as it's not always clear which trains require them.\n\nTrenitalia: Big network and trains are pretty frequent. Compared with Spain and France Trenitalia is definitely a big step up. The reservations for Frecce trains are bothersome but there are frequent local Regionale trains pretty much everywhere, and comfort is generally fine. Regionale fares are also generally on the cheap side. Delays do exist but it's not nearly as bad as DB for example. The frequent strikes are annoying.\n\nCP: It's great to see CP are doing everything they can with the means provided. They provide a very reasonable train service with mostly older rolling stock, but well-kept and much of it renovated to meet many of today's standards. Frequency is okay-ish and fares are pretty affordable. The network is not the most expensive but certainly not bad, and even though international connections are really bad it feels like Renfe is more at fault than CP with CP actually motivated to provide international trains in the first place and wanting to improve them. It's sad to see the Sud Express is gone, thanks to Renfe.\n\nZSSK: Basically very similar to ČD, but worse frequencies and slightly inferior rolling stock. Fares are low and trains are generally clean and well-equipped, with many trains having a very decent restaurant car. The cheap domestic sleeper trains are of excellent value.\n\nPKP: I was considering putting PKP in the bottom tier but I think it just barely makes it into middle tier. The experience of travelling by train in Poland is a bit chaotic, first of all with ticketing being very complicated. It's hard to find out which trains have compulsory reservations and when tickets become available to book, especially for the international trains. Reservations for domestic night trains can only be obtained at ticket offices in Poland. Train frequencies are not always that great either, and trains are often crowded. However the higher-end trains are quite comfortable and well-equipped and the restaurant car is excellent. No microwaved food there! Fares are also relatively cheap but integration with regional trains is pretty much nonexistent.\n\nSJ: I don't think the train offer in Sweden is that bad. The trains are pretty comfortable and frequencies are generally acceptable considering how sparsely populated big parts of Sweden are. However, customer service is pretty bad. SJ has closed all ticket offices and removed all ticket machines, following the recent Swedish trend of nearly forcing you to use digital technology using your own phone or computer and eliminating all other options. The only way to obtain Swedish tickets without a digital device is at certain convenience stores. In case of a disruption to your journey you are usually left to figure things out on your own. At least it's possible to make the required Interrail seat reservations online, including sleeper trains.\n\nBottom tier:\n\nSNCF: SNCF doesn't seem to want passengers in their trains. They make ticketing extremely complicated, with barely no passenger rights at all. Getting reservations when you have a pass can be a pain and especially for the international trains can be extremely expensive. Trains often don't connect at all and TER services are usually very infrequent. When you manage to book them TGV services are great, with clean and comfortable trains and impressive speeds. TER trains on the other hand are often quite dirty, but they are comfortable. The stations are usually well-equipped, even the more local ones. Staff is usually not the best, with train staff often not bothered to check tickets and ticket office staff often lacking knowledge when you have a more complicated case such as getting pass reservations. Waiting times at ticket offices can also be tediously long and you have to provide lots of personal details to obtain an elusive SNCF ticket.\n\nRenfe: Renfe knows what the passenger wants. According to Renfe, passengers want all the inconveniences of air travel, very infrequent service and mandatory reservations on every train. Passengers don't want to change trains at all and pass holders don't want to make reservations anywhere but at a Spanish ticket office. Passengers don't want night trains either. Spain has a great and extensive train network, the only thing that's missing is easily accessible, frequent trains.\n\nVy: For a rich and developed country like Norway I can't help but be disappointed by it's trains. The network isn't that extensive which is understandable given the geography of the country. But trains are also infrequent and usually fully booked, regularly even days in advance, so there is definitely demand for more trains. Comfort-wise it's not the worst but it wasn't very comfortable either considering the long distances and journey times between big cities.\n\nHŽPP: HŽPP don't seem that bothered to run trains anymore. International connections have gotten worse and many of them have been discontinued. The domestic network is also very infrequent with most infrastructure deteriorating. Even to major cities like Rijeka, Split and Zadar train service is poor or nonexistent. Many of the trains that do run aren't very comfortable with rubbish plastic local units regularly working long-distance trains.\n\nSV: Pretty similar to HŽPP, but even worse. The only international trains left at the moment are the train to Bar in Montenegro (but left to only a single night train and a summer-only daytime option with local train units and a change at the border) and a recently introduced Szeged - Subotica service. The state of the infrastructure is very bad and trains are very infrequent and often don't connect either. Things are improving however with a new Chinese-built 200kmh railway already in operation between Belgrade and Novi Sad (with good train frequency and very popular) and other railways being upgraded as well. Also the train staff have been excellent, very friendly and welcoming.\n\nŽPCG: Vere limited network, basically comprising of two railway lines (Bijelo Polje - Bar and Podgorica - Nikšić). Frequencies are low and trains are old and grubby on the Bijelo Polje - Bar line. New CAF trains on Podgorica - Nikšić, but very basic, not even power sockets are provided. Staff wasn't friendly or welcoming at all. Really disappointing as the country is very scenic.\n\nCFR: Everything to do with trains in Romania is grim. The trains are grim, the stations are grim, and so is the timetable. Trains are very infrequent, and often run at very unconventient times. Even for major long-distance connections, for example with a train at 4am, 7am, 4pm and a night train at 7pm. Trains are dirty and not well-looked after. Staff are usually not very friendly and most ticket office staff is the worst. Any of the more complicated ticketing cases such as pass reservations is a pain and it's very well possible you walk away empty-handed because they don't understand what you want or they don't know how to issue it. The network is extensive but barely any trains and no service at all.\n\nNSB: For a rich and developed country like Norway I can't help but be disappointed by it's trains. The network isn't that extensive which is understandable given the geography of the country. But trains are also infrequent and usually fully booked, regularly even days in advance, so there is definitely demand for more trains. Comfort-wise it's not the worst but it wasn't very comfortable either considering the long distances and journey times between big cities.\n\nNSB hasn't existed for 5 years or so now. SJ run the trains to Trondheim, and onwards to Bodø, and all the regional services from Trondheim. Vy, who are effectively the continuity state operator, run the route to Bergen and everything in the greater Oslo area (including trains to Gothenburg and Skien), and GoAhead run the trains to and around Stavanger.\n\nIn general they are still all using the same stock (almost all of this was new in past 10-15 years if you haven't been for a while). The Bergen route has gained some business-class style fully-flat seats on the night train though. Overall I'd say it's fine, and in fact the standard class seats are good - reasonably wide, good legroom and some level of recline. They also pretty universally have tray tables which can be pulled out to accomodate a laptop and power at the seats.\n\nNorway fundamentally doesn't believe in first class though, so the best you'll do on most trains is a standard seat with free coffee. The free coffee is not good.\n\nIn terms of ticketing, everybody is using Entur for fulfilment. It's also used by a growing number of bus companies, and gives a really impressive ability to buy and manage all the tickets in-app (or via printable pdfs), as well as timetables, journey planning and live updates. Unfortunately GoAhead have a loyalty scheme if you book direct, and Vy sometimes seem to have better offers if you book direct, so you can't safely just use the Entur app/site for everything.\n\nPrices outside of zonal areas are unfortunately quite high for advance purchases and absolutely scandalous for walk up fares, so you really need to plan ahead.\n\nAs you mention, journey times and frequencies outside greater Oslo aren't fantastic because there's a lot of very bendy single lines. This also makes reliability a problem, and connection guarantees are all a bit uncomfortable between the different operators. Most of the staff don't really know how to help if a connection is missed, although as far as I can tell they basically also don't care if you just get the next train, but of course that might be the next day.\n\nThe network is developing more quickly than anywhere else I can think of though, with new double track into Bergen just opened, big improvements into Drammen recently, a new lengthy tunnel to Ski and Gothenberg opened a year or so ago, and a long stretch of double track from the airport to Hamar via a straightened route which has been opening in stages and continues. Upcoming plans include further work north of Hamar towards Lillehammer, a tunnel even further out of Bergen along with more and longer loops further out, and double track to the Swedish border towards Gothenburg.\n\nThese interventions all tend to knock a casual 20-40 minutes off journey times and hugely improve reliability. I'd say that Bergen is probably now just about competitive with the plane, and certainly once they've finished the next tunnel it will be.\n\nI have done my top six best railways and top six worst railways.\n\nTOP SIX BEST RAILWAYS:\n\n• Northern Ireland Railways (NIR):\n\nI am not sure whether you would count this as it is still the UK but it is outside of the National Rail network. I always think that NIR is very underrated. It is such a well run network. The reliability is excellent. The fares are much cheaper than on the mainland and also much simpler. There is no ticket machines so you simply buy your ticket at a ticket office or onboard. They have excellent integration between trains and buses with most towns having their train stations and bus stations connected or next to each other. There is one company which runs all trains and infrastructure and signalling and even the buses which certainly helps. Overall i would actually say this is probably the best network in Europe and i think it is very underrated.\n\n• Russia Railways (RZD):\n\nI have to say Russian Railways have always impressed me. The trains are always well maintained and clean and reliable. I have travelled extensively on Russian Railways on both their suburban and regional trains and their long distance trains and have never had a delayed and cancelled train. They have also invested heavily in buying new modern trains. Their network is very modern these days with very few old trains. Even their few old ones left from the USSR days have been kept in very good condition. The stations are all kept in very good condition and are very clean. Even the tiny rural unstaffed halts in the middle of nowhere always seem to be well kept with up to date timetables posted. The fares are very cheap. Overall it just seems like a very well run network.\n\n• Belarus Railways (BCH):\n\nSimilar to Russia i would say Belarus has done a great job with their railways. I have always found their trains to be on time and have not come across any delayed or cancelled trains. They have also invested heavily in modern trains in recent years. Also like Russia their trains from the USSR days have been kept in good condition. Their network is not quite as modernised as Russia but it is certainly almost there. It has always appeared to be a very well run network.\n\n• Estonia Railways (ELRON):\n\nEstonia has done an amazing job with modernising their railway network. Their entire network seems well run and they have great accessibility. Estonia is the only country in the world to have a 100% step free railway. Every single platform at every single station in Estonia is fully accessible and has level boarding meaning wheelchair users can just wheel straight on and off with no ramps or assistance required. The frequency is a bit poor when you get further from Tallinn and unfortunately they completely closed one of their railway lines recently but the trains closer to Tallinn have great frequency. The fares are also pretty good value. Overall it is a great network.\n\n• Luxembourg Railways (CFL):\n\nLuxembourg has a completely free railway which itself certainly wins them a spot in the top five. It is amazing to have an entire country with free trains. But also it is a nice simple network with frequent trains and fairly good reliability. There are good connections at stations with buses. It is a very small network but everything seems well run.\n\n• NS (Netherlands) and SNCB/NMBS/NGBE (Belgium):\n\nJust as ricohallo did i will put these together as they are quite similar. These two networks are very simple and in some ways are probably the most similar to the UK. They have very frequent trains on most routes. No reservations are required. They are just nice simple and easy to use networks compared to most other Mainland European countries.\n\nOthers like, Croatia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, all seem to do a very decent job as well and overall have extensive coverage and easy to use railways. So they certainly deserve a mention. But not quite as good to make the top six.\n\nTOP SIX WORST RAILWAYS:\n\n• Albania Railways (HSH):\n\nThe railways are falling apart. I believe at the moment all that is left is one train a day in each direction on a short section. Last time i visited in the late 2010s one of the trains i went on had two missing doors and multiple broken windows and yet it was in passenger service. Everything was broken. I do not think that i saw a single train that did not have something wrong with it. Even most third world countries in Africa and Asia maintain their railways better than this.\n\n• Ukraine Railways (UZ):\n\nI have not used them since the war so i am not sure what they are like these days. But when i last visited in the late 2010s the railways were in an appalling state. Two of the D1 trains that i went on had holes in the floors where you could actually see the track below. The trains were rotting so badly and looked very unsafe. I also went on two DR1 trains which both had some doors that were jammed open and were not closing between stations. Not quite as bad as Albania but it is certainly the country with the second worst maintained trains. Many smaller rural stations looked abandoned and many had platforms that were falling apart. I saw one station where a chunk of the platform had collapsed. Many stations do not even have a simple poster or station name board or any basics you would expect. It did surprise me as a lot of the other ex USSR countries had improved their railways a lot but unfortunately Ukraine seemed really far behind. The railways in Kiev were certainly a bit better but the further you got from the capital city the worse the trains got. In the Lviv and Ivano Frankivsk regions it seemed to be particularly bad with everything in poor condition.\n\n• Moldova Railways (CFM):\n\nThey have an extremely limited service and very poorly maintained stations and trains Their second biggest station in the capital city of Chisinau called Visternicini looks like an abandoned station and the whole railway line going through it looks abandoned. Every single track is completely overgrown with weeds up to waist level but yet it still has a couple trains a day. It is a very poorly maintained network. Almost every station looks abandoned. Surprisingly though their D1 trains are in fairly good condition compared to the ones that neighbouring Ukraine has.\n\n• Spain Railways (RENFE):\n\nSpain has an awful railway. The only decent services are in the few cities that have suburban trains. They have high speed trains but they have completely neglected their regional trains. Hardly anywhere outside of the high speed lines has trains and the ones that do are very infrequent. It is a shame that they have spent all this money on high speed and then completely neglected their non high speed lines. They also love buying these awful Talgo trains for their high speed routes which feel very cheap and give a very rough ride. They also have this ridiculous security theatre with airport style security at stations.\n\n• Eurostar (ES):\n\nEverything about Eurostar is awful. They charge extortionate fares. The current fares that Eurostar charge are a set price of £235 Single or £408 Return for Paris or a set price of £224 Single or £388 Return for Brussels if you buy it at the station on the day. Even our domestic train operators which are known for extortionate fares do not charge such ridiculous prices for walkup fares of the same distance. They are taking the mick with these prices. Then they have a whole ridiculous unnecessary security theatre. The trains also finish so early in the evening. For some reason they do not do late evening services. Then you have the ridiculous situation of having to get to the station so early because they do passport control at the station rather than at the borders onboard. They also have the worst delay repay of any operator in the UK by far. Even the terrible delay repay that Grand Cancel offer is better than this. Eurostar has the potential to be a great operator but they run it so poorly.\n\n• Macedonia (MZ) and Bosnia (ZFBH/ZRS):\n\nI will put these two together because they are very similar. Both networks have a mixture of new modern trains and old run down trains but everything seems to be poorly maintained. In both countries i have found that the timetables posted at stations are not very accurate or reliable. Half the timetables never seem to run. It is very hard to find out what is actually running until you get to the station. Macedonia has a bunch of new modern DMUs (x4) and EMUs (x2) built by CRRC in 2015 but yet they seem to just sit in the depot most of the time. While most trains are formed of 40 year old stock. Bosnia has a nice new DMU (x1) built by Koncar in 2009 but yet it was only in service for about two years before it spent over a decade out of use sitting in the depot and then they only put it back to service about two years ago. So most trains are formed of very old 40 year old stock. Both countries seem to have a lot of problems with their railways.\n\nIn terms of ticketing i would put Sweden right at the very bottom. Sweden has an extremely unfriendly railway for passengers to use and makes it impossible to buy a ticket. But other than that their railway is decent enough so they do not make the worst six.\n\nSo that is my opinion of the best railways and the worst railways.\n\nI have to say overall the railways in Europe have gone massively downhill in recent decades. I think the EU forcing countries to split up their train operators and infrastructure operators in to separate companies and franchising in to a bunch of different operators and allowing open access operators has made things a lot worse. I remember travelling extensively around Europe in the 70s and 80s and 90s and overall the railways were a lot better. Everything seemed to work better. Back then every country just had one train company running everything. I also find a lot of countries have focused a lot on high speed and intercity while neglecting their local regional stopping trains. So some countries do seem to have gone backwards compared to fourty years ago.\n\nReally interesting reading different opinions on here. There's definitely some I have to agree with and others I think I would love to try.\n\nThose defending DB, I honestly do agree the quality of their product is in general very good. I was not slandering that by any means, but there's an element where a good offering can be scuppered by hideously bad punctuality. I'd rather an 'average' train turns up with fantastic punctuality than a very high spec train but with a delay of 60, 90 or even 120 minutes on a daily. Hence why I ranked NS as highly as I did.\n\nThe comfort of NS is by no means the best but it is also nowhere near the worst and as I said in my original post, given most journeys are within the Randstad area the interior is generally acceptable for the duration of the journeys. I did a trip to Maastricht from Amsterdam last week on a VIRM and I do agree that the longer distance journeys could be a bit better. But it wasn't insufferable.\n\nSome other ones I want to pick out:\n\n1. For the few of you that said Eurostar is awful - - I am completely in agreement. They are actually lucky there's worse companies out there so they didn't get a shout out in the original post. But they're a walking advertisement to fly to Europe instead and this is such a huge shame because the UK really deserves better from its sole international railway operator. I fly somewhat regularly, and I dislike flying. I hate the whole airport experience - having to turn up hours beforehand. Eurostar has the exact same thing. Waiting in one queue after another. Security. Passport control. Abysmal selection of duty free shops. Mandatory reservations. Usually hit and miss punctuality. Now I understand some of these problems obviously stem from Brexit. The rest stems from a lack of capacity at the stations they serve (London and the Netherlands in particular). But there seems to be no willpower to try and improve customer expectations. And my expectations are very high if I am paying an eye watering £200 or even £300 for a ticket. easyJet could get me across the channel for probably half of that in similar time.\n\nThe seats on an e320 are not comfortable in standard - they're better in standard premium/business I will give it that. The window alignment is awful and so many seats are just looking at plastic walls. Customer experience and these supposed TMs are nowhere to be seen and 9/10 times give poor information during regular disruption. I really do think Eurostar could be one of the best operators in Europe (at a lower price) but there needs to be both commercial and political willpower to make this work.\n\n2. BDZ\n\nBDZ I have travelled with a couple of times and whilst their stock would be deemed as heritage by UK standards, I agree they are really actually very good at what they do. The trains are usually somewhat punctual, clean (not the toilets!), in good nick considering their age and staff are helpful. It would be nice if there was a snack bar or restaurant car for their longer distance journeys but they show a lot of potential as an up and coming train operator and I hold them in good light."
