The old station is now a mall attached to it.\n\nWaymark Code: WMFZ1Z\n\nLocation: Oslo, Norway\n\nPublished By: lumbricus\n\nViews: 29\n\nWikipedia (visit link) adds:\n\n\"Oslo Central Station (Norwegian: Oslo sentralstasjon, abbreviated Oslo S) is the main railway station in Oslo, and the largest railway station within the entire Norwegian railway system. It is the terminus of Drammen Line, Gardermoen Line, Gjøvik Line, Hoved Line and Østfold Line. It serves express, regional and local rail services by four companies. The railway station is owned and operated by Norwegian National Rail Administration and was opened in 1980.\n\nOslo Central was built on the site of the older Oslo East Station (Oslo Østbanestasjon, Oslo Ø), the combining of the former east and west stations being made possible by the opening of the Oslo Tunnel. Oslo Central has nineteen tracks, thirteen of which have connections through the Oslo Tunnel. The station has two buildings, the original Oslo East building and the newer main building for Oslo Central. Each building houses a large shopping centre. The square in front of the station is called Jernbanetorget...\n\nWhen the first railway line, Hoved Line, was built between Oslo and Eidsvoll in 1854[1] , the terminus in Oslo was constructed as an ad-hoc solution located at Gamlebyen. Alternate sites included Youngstorget, Grünerløkka and Vaterlands bru. In 1852 an architectural competition was held, and a plan based on Crown Street Station in Liverpool won. The station was located east of the river Akerselva, but could not serve as a permanent solution, as it was close to neither the city centre nor the port. In 1859 the freight section of the station was expanded with the purchase of land between Loelva and the port, and part of Bjørvika. From the beginning, rail traffic increased, especially after the expansion of Hovedbanen to Hamar in 1862, and the opening of Kongsvingerbanen in 1865.\n\nIn 1872 Oslo got its second terminal station, located at Pipervika near Aker Brygge and the city hall. Oslo Vestbanestasjon (Oslo West Line Station or Oslo V) was built to allow Drammenbanen between Drammen and Oslo to terminate in downtown Oslo. The two stations were located about 2 km apart and were not connected by rail until 1907 when Havnebanen was built. There had been discussions about building a central station to connect Drammenbanen with the eastern station, but this idea involved building it via Majorstuen and Grefsen. Oslo V always remained a secondary railway station in Oslo, since it mostly served local traffic to Buskerud, Telemark and Vestfold in addition to Sørlandsbanen.\"\n\nIs the station/depot currently used for railroad purposes?: YesIs the station/depot open to the public?: YesIf the station/depot is not being used for railroad purposes, what is it currently used for?:\n\nThis is the Oslo Central Station, servicing local trains in the Oslo area, regional trains all over Norway, as well as trains bound for Stockholm and Gothenburg in Sweden.What rail lines does/did the station/depot serve?: Drammen Line, Skien Line, Gardermoen Line, Gjøvik Line, Trunk Line, Østfold LineStation/Depot Web Site: [Web Link]\n\nVisit Instructions:\n\nPlease post an original picture of the station/depot taken while you were there.
