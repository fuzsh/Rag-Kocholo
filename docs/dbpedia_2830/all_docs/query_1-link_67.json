        "text": "Swedish construction company NCC has secured a contract worth $221.6m (SEK1.9bn) from Bane NOR to convert the Drammen railway station area in Norway.\n\nThe company stated that the work on the project is highly complex in terms of the logistics, planning and coordination of many technically challenging elements.\n\nNorwegian government agency Bane NOR is responsible for planning, development, management, operation and maintenance of the Norwegian railway network, traffic management as well as management and development of railway property.\n\nThe scope of work under the contract involves extension of the Drammen railway station area along with the construction of a waterfront promenade, and platforms.\n\nIt also includes construction of pedestrian underpasses as well as a new city bridge across the track area.\n\nThe extension of railway station area is a part of Bane NOR’s venture “New double track Drammen-Kobbervikdalen” and the InterCity initiative.\n\nWork on the project is scheduled to commence in September this year, with completion expected in the end of 2025.\n\nNCC said that the expansion of railway in eastern Norway is currently under way and will have capacity to provide shorter travel times for one and a half million people, and more departures.\n\nNCC Infrastructure business area manager Kenneth Nilsson said: “We have two ongoing railway projects together with Bane NOR and we look forward to further broadening our collaboration.\n\n“The project will be conducted while the railway is still in operation, thus setting high demands for excellent coordination, planning and logistics which suits us well.”\n\nIn a separate development, the construction company announced plans to sell the K11 office project in Järva Krog to Castellum for more than $116.6m (SEK1bn).\n\n———————————————————————————————————————\n\nRendering of the Drammen railway station area in Norway.
