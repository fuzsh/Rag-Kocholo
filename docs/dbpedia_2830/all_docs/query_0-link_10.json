        "text": "Country Name\n\nNorway (Norge)\n\nNational Railway System\n\nVy, formerly Norges Statsbaner (NSB). The NSB Group was renamed the Vy Group on 24 April 2019. The company is owned by the Norwegian government via the Ministry of Transport and Communications.\n\nThe train service between Oslo and Gardermoen Airport is operated by a subsidiary company, NSB Gardermobanen AS, since re-named 'Flytoget'. The Linx company, jointly owned by SJ and NSB, which operated services between Norway and Sweden, was liquidated and ceased operations on 8 January 2005. Since then, through services Stockholm - Oslo have been operated by SJ. Oslo - Göteborg is operated by NSB in cooperation with Svenska Tågkompaniet (TKAB), and in 2007 NSB acquired full ownership of TKAB, which has been renamed to Vy Tåg AB.\n\nCompetition is being introduced on main line passenger services. Invitations to tender for the first passenger train operating contract were issued to prequalified bidders by Jernbanedirektoratet on 12 October 2017, when the national railway agency also announced plans for further competitive tendering. This first contract, Lot 1 Sør, covered inter-city services on the Sørlandet line to Stavanger, Jærbanen local services from Stavanger, and the Arendal branch. The contract was awarded to Go-Ahead Norge AS, branded as Go-Ahead Nordic, on 30 October 2018 and came into effect on 15 December 2019.\n\nThe SJ Norge AS subsidiary of Sweden’s national passenger operator was awarded the Lot 2 Nord operating contract on 17 June 2019. The contract covers long-distance passenger services on the Dovrebanen and Nordlandsbanen routes from Oslo to Trondheim and Bodø, as well as the Rørosbanen, Raumabanen, Trønderbanen, Meråkerbanen, and Saltenpendelen regional services and runs for 10 years from 08 June 2020.\n\nThe Lot 3 Vest operating contract, covering long-distance passenger services from Bergen to Voss, Myrdal and Oslo, and local services between Bergen and Arna was awarded to Vy Tog on 09 December 2019. The nine year contract running from 13 December 2020, has an optional two year extension, but does not include the passenger services on the Flåm branch which are operated under a separate contract between line manager Flåm Utvikling and the national operator until December 2029 with an optional two year extension.\n\nThe Lot 4 contract covering services around Oslo, expected to be awarded in 2020, was postponed due to the coronavirus pandemic. It was to be tendered in January 2021 with contract award in early 2022 and take over of services from the December 2023 timetable change, but the process is stopped, and Vy will retain the traffic. Lot 5 covering Inter-City services is yet to be defined.\n\nIt should be noted that during the Norwegian summer holiday period (from late June to early August) a reduced service is run over some lines, particularly in the Oslo area where suburban and metro services are affected. Major engineering works requiring line closures are also often scheduled for this period of reduced local demand.\n\nNational Railway Operator\n\nVygruppen AS (Vy), formerly Norges Statsbaner (NSB).\n\nOther Railway Operators:\n\nFlytoget AS, Flytoget, a Vy subsidiary company\n\nVy Gjøvikbanen AS, Vy subsidiary company\n\nGo-Ahead Norge AS, branded as Go-Ahead Nordic\n\nSJ Norge SJ Norge\n\nLanguage\n\nNorwegian. There are two forms of Norwegian, Bokmål and Nynorsk. Bokmål predominates, with Nynorsk used mainly in western fjord and central mountain areas.\n\nAdditional vowels come at the end of the Norwegian alphabet, with Æ, Ø and Å following Z in that order. Accordingly, Åsen comes last in the index of Norwegian railway stations and Mære is further down the list than Mysen.\n\nCurrency\n\nNorwegian Krone\n\nUIC code\n\nNSB: numeric 76; alpha N\n\nTimetable\n\nTimetables are issued by Vy in December and June, the other operators annually in December.\n\nJourney Planner\n\nVy (English version) or Entur covering all operators.\n\nDownloadable Timetable\n\nThere does not appear to a website providing timetables for all operators; each operator provides timetables for their own services only:\n\nVy\n\nGo-Ahead Nordic\n\nSJ Norge\n\nWorking (Staff) Timetable\n\nThe working timetable is available on the Bane NOR website here.\n\nTjenesterutebøker R23 contains what are termed \"current (gjeldende)\" timetables for 2023 for individual trains by operator\n\nIt should be noted that detailed distances are given as part of the individual train routing files.\n\nRoute train /time graphs (for 2023) are available here\n\nDaily graphical timetable here Line section and date must be selected for download.\n\nPrinted Timetable\n\nVy does not publish a single comprehensive timetable or printed leaflets and the \"Rutebok for Norge\" is no longer printed.\n\nEngineering Information\n\nThere is no comprehensive source of information.\n\nBane NOR provide a summary of current disruptions and a list of planned work (both in Norwegian only)\n\nIndividual operators list only disruptions affecting their own services:\n\nVy: \"traffic info\"\n\nGo-Ahead Nordic: \"traffic info\"\n\nSJ Norge: \"scheduled maintenance\"\n\nFor weather reasons, major engineering work takes place in the summer season (late June to early August).\n\nMaps\n\nPrinted Maps\n\nEuropean Railway Atlas (All-Europe Edition) by M.G.

Only five staffed ticket offices remain - Oslo S., Oslo Lufthavn, Trondheim, Stavanger and Bergen.\n\nSeat reservations are essential on most long-distance trains and reserved seats are not indicated as such. Be aware that access to fully-booked trains without a reservation maybe denied.\n\nSuburban trains, such as in the Oslo area, have carriages marked \"betjent\" or \"ubetjent\",the former denoting in which carriage the conductor travels (for on-train ticket purchase or validation). Ticketless travel or use of an unvalidated ticket in an \"ubetjent\" carriage is subject to a penalty.\n\nOn some services First and Second Class accommodation has been redesignated Økonomiklasse (Economy) and Kontorklasse (Business), but on many trains only Second or Economy Class is provided. First or Kontorklasse accommodation is generally not indicated by a yellow stripe on the outside of vehicles. Couchettes are not provided on internal overnight trains, but sleeping cars have up to three berths per compartment.\n\nPremium fares are charged on the Flytoget \"Airport Express\" service between Drammen, Oslo and Gardermoen Airport, InterRail and similar tickets are not valid. In addition, ordinary NSB trains run between Oslo and the Airport twice hourly.\n\nInfrastructure\n\nInfrastructure Authority\n\nInfrastructure is owned and managed by a public authority, Bane NOR.\n\nNetwork Statement\n\nNetwork Statement multiple years.\n\nGauge\n\nStandard\n\nElectrification\n\n15 kV 16.7 Hz.\n\nRule of the road\n\nRight, but almost all lines in Norway outside the Oslo suburban area are single track.\n\nDistances\n\nThe best source is the Network Statement Stations and Lines.\n\nOther Railways\n\nNone, but iron ore trains to Narvik are operated by Malmtrafik AS (and Swedish company Malmtrafik AB) which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Swedish mining company LKAB. Passenger trains between Narvik and Sweden are now operated by Vy Tåg AB, a Swedish subsidiary of Norwegian Vy Tog AS, having won the contract with Swedish Trafikverket. Trains on the Flåm branch are operated by Vy, but commercial responsibility for the service rests with Flåm Utvikling, a company owned by local councils.\n\nTourist lines\n\n(Standard gauge unless shown otherwise)\n\nKrøderbanen: Vikersund - Krøderen www.njk.no/index.php/kroderbanen-norges-lengste-museum\n\nBergens Elektriske Sporvei - Bergen Electric Tramway, operate a short tram line out of the old tramway depot in Begen, which has been converted into the Bergen Techical Museum.\n\nGamle Vossebanen: Garnes [near Bergen] - Midttun: www.njk.no/tourist-information Note that an additional section from Garnes to Tunes is covered on only one day in September each year.

Bane NOR deals with day to day management of infrastructure, while Jernbanedirektoratet (Railway Directorate, a government office) is responsible for the specification and management of main line passenger services. Competitive tendering of passenger services started during 2017.\n\nRecent Changes (Latest first)\n\nLine Openings\n\nThe Dovrebane between Hamar and Dombås reopened on 20 May 2024, following reconstruction of the Randklev bridge which was destroyed by floods in August 2023.\n\n11 December 2022 - the new Follobane high speed line between Oslo and Ski opened to public traffic. Unusually, the ceremonial opening took place the following day. However it was closed on 19 December following a fire at Ski, and reopened on 5 March 2023.\n\nIt includes the 19.5 km Blix tunnel, the longest in the Nordic region. Completion was scheduled for Dec 2021 but the contracts were cancelled after the contractors had financial difficulties. (See Follobanen Link and Timeline). Considerable re-modelling of the eastern end of Oslo Sentral station was required, with realignment or closure of existing links. A new 600m tunnel/covered way was constructed at Middelalderparken to Ekebergåsen see and the current Østfold line diverted into a new tunnel on the approach to Oslo S. after completion of the summer 2021 work. At Ski, Østfoldbanen trains were diverted on 31 August 2020 to the new Follobane platforms on the western side of the station to allow the existing eastern station to be rebuilt.\n\n21 November 2022 - Public operation on the new 9 km Bergen Tram Line 2 to Fyllingsdalen commenced after an opening ceremony on 18 November 2022.\n\n21 June 2021 - Oslo Trams resumed use of the northern section of Storgata, with the diversionary loop, to the south, and the associated stop at Lilletorget ceasing in regular use.\n\n13 December 2020: The new 7.8 km Ny Ulriken tunnel between Arna and Fløen (Bergen) opened. The old tunnel was then closed for upgrading. Double track from Fløen to Bergen is due to be completed in 2024, along with new access to the Nygårdstangen freight terminal, which will also be re-modelled as part of the work.\n\n14 December 2020: The 830m spur to Notodden Kollectiv Terminal re-opened following electrification and the original out of town Notodden station closed again. Services on the branch from Porsgrunn (Hjuskebø) had reverted to the original Notodden station on 10 August 2015, having previously used the above new station (alongside the bus terminal and closer to the town centre on an unelectrified spur line) since 25 August 2004. The entire branch had been threatened with closure at the December 2014 timetable change but funding was obtained for the service to continue. A NOK 7.5 million renovation of the closed line to Tinnoset was authorised at the same time as the electrification to Notodden Kollectiv Terminal.\n\n04 October 2020: Oslo Tramway routes 13/19 Björvika – Oslo Hospital (0.7 km) opened.\n\nClosures\n\n7 August 2023: Owing to heavy rainfall, the Randklev bridge over the river Gudbrandsdalslågen, immediately south of Ringebu, collapsed. As a result, the Dovrebane between Oslo and Trondheim was initially closed north of Lillehammer. As at April 2024, a few trains now operate as far north as Fåvang (about 10km south of Ringebu) and north of Ringebu, with a bus connection between them.\n\n12 December 2020: The Ulriken Tunnel (Arna - Fløen (Bergen), opened in 1964) was temporarily closed. Single track tunnel to be renovated and re-opened in June 2023.\n\nDecember 2020: Notodden old station closed.\n\n03 October 2020: Oslo Tramway closed St. Halvards plass - Jernbanetorget (Routes 13/19.\n\nOlder Changes\n\nFor details of older changes dating back to the year 2004 see Norway - Older General Information.\n\nFuture Changes\n\nIn May 2023 Bergen city council approved plans for the construction of a 12.7 km extension of the Bybanen light rail network from Kaigaten in the city centre northwards to Vågsbotn in Åsane. Construction should start in 2024, with completion in 2032 at the earliest.\n\nIt is planned to electrify the following lines, with battery locomotive operation, on some sections. The priority order is:\n\n(1) The the Nordland line (Trondheim -) Stjørdal - Mo i Rana - Bodø, (2) the Røros line (Hamar - Røros - Støren) and (3) the Solør line (Kongsvinger - Elverum).\n\nIt is not planned to electrify the Rauma line (Dombås - Åndalsnes).\n\nThere are a number of projects in the Bane NOR portfolio. Some projects are presented in English, but there are more in Norwegian.\n\nElectrification of Stavne - Leangen, Trondheim S - Stjørdal and Hell - Storlien(SE) started in early 2021, with completion scheduled for December 2024.\n\nThe Follo Line Project: south of Ski, work began in October 2020 under a contract signed on June 28, 2019 for a new 10.3 km section of double track line from Sandbukta to Såstad, replacing the existing sinuous single track alignment. The new route will include two tunnels of 2 700 m and 2 300 m and a new Moss station with 800 m long platforms, and is due to be completed by December 2024.\n\nDrammen – Tønsberg – Larvik – Porsgrunn (Vestfoldbanen Project): 2016 Intercity Plan has double track to Tonsberg for completion by 2024-2026 and onwards to Larvik by 2032.\n\nBy June 2015 the upgraded Drammen to Holm section was in use. The 14.3 km Holm – Holmestrand – Nykirke cut-off, including a replacement underground station replacing the existing line through Holmestrand opened on 28 November 2016. The realigned and double tracked Barkåker – Tønsberg tunnel section was formally opened on 19 November 2011. The new connections result in services now using the complete circle round Tønsberg in the opposite direction to that previously taken - see Maps and Plans - Norway.\n\nBane NOR is constructing a new 10km double track route from Drammen to Kobbervikdalen with new stations in Drammen and Gulskogen, for completion in 2024, with the 13.6km Nykirke – Barkåker double-track section to follow in 2025.\n\nTwo long tunneled sections have been constructed between Skøyen and Asker. The first section, Sandvika – Asker, was completed in 2005; rebuilding of Lysaker station was completed in 2009; the new Baerum Tunnel between Lysaker and Sandvika opened on 28 August 2011; the original Lysaker - Sandvika line reopened on 13 December 2015 after being closed for 15 months for reconstruction. Work on the last section, Skøyen – Lysaker, was due to start in 2015 at the earliest, appears to be in abeyance.\n\nDoubling of Eidsvoll - Hamar (the Dovre line) on a new alignment is planned by 2024, with the Minnesund - Steinsrud section jointly with the E6 road development. A new 17 km double track route from Langset (just north of Minnesund) to Kleverud (south of Espa) opened on 1 December 2015. Construction work on the 13km Venjar – Eidsvoll – Langset section is continuing while work will start on the 1.8km Kleverud – Sørli section in 2021. Planning is also underway on the 14km Sørli – Åkersvika section of the Oslo – Lillehammer line.\n\nOslo - Bergen: In December 2015 the government announced plans to double the main line and reconstruct the section between Arna and Voss, starting with the Arna - Stangehlle section, mostly in tunnel to overcome problems caused by avalanches and mud slides. The old Ulriken tunnel between Arna and Fløen (Bergen) is closed for upgrading. When this is completed in 2024, double track will be available between Arna and Bergen.\n\nA new double track line between Gulskogen and Hokksund eliminating the current route through Steinberg\n\nThe Ringerike Line and E16. A new 40 km double track line between Sandvika and Hønefoss, part of which will be a joint project with the new E16 road. This will reduce the journey time between Oslo and Hønefoss/Bergen by an hour. Construction is expected to start in 2021/2022.\n\nThe Norwegian parliament approved funding in December 2015 for planning the doubling of Narvik - Kiruna.\n\nExtensive re-alignments and new lines have been built to improve journey times. The line from Oslo to Sarpsborg via Moss has been rebuilt over much of its length. Work on the Bergen line has included construction of a long tunnel below the summit at Finse.\n\nSpecial notes\n\nNSB carriages do not work outside Norway and Sweden because they are larger than UIC standard loading gauge.\n\nThe following lines are listed as temporarily closed to traffic; infrastructure is maintained only enough to allow inspection by a measuring vehicle.\n\n(Grong -) Skogmo - Namsos\n\nNotodden - Tinnoset\n\nEina - Dokka\n\nThe following lines are listed as closed to traffic; they are not part of the National Norwegian Network and are not maintained. However track is in situ.\n\nSira - Flekkefjord; the loading gauge is smaller than standard\n\n(Kongsberg -) Rollag - Rødberg\n\nNeslandsvatn - Sannidal\n\nDokka - Bjørgo\n\nGanddal - Figgjo - Ålgård; track cut at Figgjo (9 km)"
