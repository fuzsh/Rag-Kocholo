        "text": "Jones tells me about the journeys involved in his residency projects. As he speaks I picture the continuous movement of creative people and their created objects, not just the physical motion of artists and artworks as they are taken from one place to another, but also the reiteration of creative production at one geographic location after another. Perhaps the rapid expansion of opportunities to become an artist-in-residence reflects a wider diffusion of ideas about the location of artistic practice (for example, the discourses associated with site-specificity or relational aesthetics). The interesting point is that the current spatial\n\ndiffusion of art practice strikes us a such an obvious development – contemporary art seems to require all artists to be out and about within what Rosalind Krauss famously called an ‘expanded field’. Because this expulsion from the studio has been following its ‘post-lapsarian’ dynamic for more than thirty years, it is probably high time artist-researchers in universities made a start on aligning mobilities research with this established art world thinking. Furthermore, maybe the facilitators of residency programmes should pay particular attention to what Bissell says – the different types of vehicles that move us around the world are much more than mechanical disruptors of sedentary living. If Bissell thinks our understanding of travel is based on a false dichotomy between the motile and the quiescent, then it may also be true that the aspirational mobility promoted by arts organisations misrepresents the cloistered stability of studio-bound practices. It seems odd that the ambition to strengthen the scope that artists have to move around the world involves the curiously homely invitation to reside. As the title of this short essay suggests, the ambiguity at the heart of the term ‘artist-in-residence’ is the topic I want to explore in relation to the mobilities of an artist like Jones.\n\nWhen I myself think about residing I call to mind a landscape in which I did not grow up nor now live, in which I was neither blessed with stability nor imbued with stillness. The place in question is a stretch of modest English ‘fold’ country stretching between Oxfordshire and Warwickshire that I only learnt to fully inhabit when it became a place of return after periods of university teaching in Newcastle-Upon-Tyne. During these periods of repatriation I noticed, as I had not before, the countless tangled footpaths and bridle ways that measure out and weave together a gentle up-and-down\n\nlandscape which has been so plotted and pieced that the land mass itself is now almost completely a product of the plough. Everywhere has been neatly honed but the soil beneath your feet turns out to be not so tidy. The degraded spillage of modern farming has littered the earth with plastic shards amongst which, whilst walking by a freshly tilled field, one could easily find enough archaeological or fossil debris to fill several pockets. Thus to learn to reside in this countryside is a matter of knowingly moving back and forth on its ground-up past, on the micro-scale residue that scatters its history throughout both the landscape and the imagination.\n\nSuch pastoral nearsightedness may sit oddly with my theme. Indeed, to speak of residing in this manner brings to mind the world-disclosing endurance of ‘dwelling’ which Martin Heidegger placed at the heart of human existence. This condition is analogous to, in the philosopher’s own words, a ‘clearing’ in which we have space to cultivate ‘access to the being that we ourselves are’. On the face of it Heidegger’s concept advocates a need to settle down, build permanent homesteads, and root ourselves in the land. But the journeys that Jones undertakes create room enough in which to dwell if, that is, one recognises the more nomadic dimensions of this idea. When an artist has travelled to some far-flung location even the everyday task of sweeping the studio floor fills the air with\n\ndust so strange that it smells like a different planet. For example, Jones has been resident artist in an historic Japanese rice store on the southern island of Kyushu that has been cleared of its agricultural contents in order to establish an empty space for artists to use. To work in this studio is to creatively negotiate a dusty past that is entirely foreign to an artist from Europe. Jones says that even the artworks he made there turned up like decorous visitors. They would only start to look like art, discretely, after settling into the space. As a result, we assume that his activities ‘there’ can only be different from his activities ‘here’ even though, in the end, the resulting artworks will be removed and brought back to his studio in England, a home space in which a short period of residence in Japan can only be, in the greater scheme of things, absorbed into the lengthier cycles of Jones’ commitment to his ongoing progress as an artist.\n\nHome for Jones is a converted Victorian chapel in rural Northumberland that is large enough to contain both domestic living space and a studio. To talk about carving out a place in the world is apt. It is a monumental dwelling, an architecturally-conceived structure that was raised on foundation stones which were fashioned by 19th century stonemasons to carry institutional inscriptions as far as possible into the future. Across the short distance between this building and the railway line that links the surrounding village to Newcastle, one can pace out in one’s imagination the exciting departures made from this chapel as Jones sets out to reside in other studios. Somewhere down the tracks – beyond national railways stations, international airports and transcontinental flights – he can go to work in Hill End, a deserted Australian gold-rush town where century-old corrugated iron houses are rusting into the ground. At Bundanon, another Australian residency on the banks of the Shoalhaven river, Jones uses one of the retreats for artists that the painter Arthur Boyd established on a run-down colonial homestead. To experiment with residing at these distant heritage sites, as my own intensely local perambulations along Oxfordshire footpaths suggests, is a matter of becoming intimate with the ground-up past beneath you, the accumulated and composite residue underfoot that offers immediate opportunities to understand the substance of a place. Thus, for a newly arrived artist-in-residence, the clearing in which Heidegger pictures him or her dwelling is as much a room-making action as a physical space. After all, at their point of inception, clearings have to be physically cleared, and artist’s studios actually swept clean, in order to initiate a state of productive dwelling.\n\nIt could be that the ‘clearing’ metaphor relies a little too much on the idea of securing a space beyond the safety of one’s usual frontiers or borders. The current media attention being given to Second World War ‘monuments’ officers offers a useful example. Robert Edsel’s books tell extraordinary stories about courageous experts from the arts being conscripted into the US Army to protect European cultural treasures as the Allies advanced through Italy and France. Amongst foreign ruins, amidst the bewildering territorial gains and losses of frontline fighting, their task was to track down and rescue endangered artworks. This act of emergency mobilization enforced, with great difficulty, cultural ‘clearings’ where military law held sway."
