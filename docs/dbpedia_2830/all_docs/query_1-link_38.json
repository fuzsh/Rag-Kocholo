        "text": "If you arrive at Oslo airport with a domestic flight you cannot miss Flytoget’s train station. As you come down the escalator from Arrivals you will see an illuminated board counting down to the next departure of a Flytoget service. There are ticket machines on either side of the gates to the station – or you can swipe your card in the reader installed at every gate.\n\nHow to buy tickets for Flytogets Airport Express trains\n\nIf you want the smoothest possible onwards journey from Oslo airport, you can buy tickets in advance or download the Flytoget App. Or you can pay by cash or card in the ticket machine before your go through the gates. It is a good idea to buy a return ticket; they are valid for 90 days, and you are free to choose which departure that suits you best.\n\nOnce you are through the gates and have come down the escalator you cannot get lost: Flytoget’s silvery grey plane-like appearance is easy to recognise and will always be departing from Track 3.\n\nEven if the journey is short, you should travel in comfort: ample seating, free wifi and plug sockets ensure that you arrive in Oslo with your phone fully charged.\n\nBy train from Oslo Airport to Oslo Central Station\n\nAll of Flytoget’s Airport Express trains stop at Oslo Central Station, and our fastest trains do the journey in only 19 minutes! There are a number of hotels within walking distance of the railway terminal, such as Clarion Hotel the Hub, Clarion Hotel Oslo, Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel (also known as Oslo Plaza), Scandic Byporten and Thon Hotel Opera. Feel free to ask a member of staff if you need advice.\n\nWhen arriving by train from Oslo Airport to Oslo Central Station you can change to underground, bus or tram services if you intend to travel onwards to other parts of Oslo. The east-bound underground takes you to Grønland and Tøyen, where popular attractions include the Botanic Gardens. If you take the westbound underground, you will be stopping at Stortinget (the Norwegian Parliament) and Majorstuen, which is the best stop for the Frogner Park, which is a popular destination.\n\nWhy not go and see our friends at Visit Oslo if you need inspiration for your time in the city.\n\nOslo Central Station is also a natural stop-off point if you intend to travel onwards by rail. Trains depart from here to the south (in the direction of Halden and Gothenburgh) and the west (in the direction of Skien, Stavanger or Bergen).\n\nBy train from Oslo Airport to Nationaltheatret\n\nNationaltheatret Station is situated in the centre of Oslo, within walking distance of the Royal Palace and areas such as Aker Brygge and Tjuvholmen. Please note that the station has three exits. Don’t hesitate to ask a member of Flytoget’s staff at Gardermoen or aboard the train if you wonder which exit to choose.\n\nBoard an airport express train terminating in Drammen or Stabekk if you want to alight at Nationaltheatret.\n\nBy train from Oslo Airport to Skøyen\n\nSkøyen is the third station from the airport on the Flytoget route. Our express trains will take you there from Oslo Airport to Skøyen station in 29 minutes, which is the fastest way to go if you are heading for a meeting in this part of Oslo. Skøyen is an important city node, and a number of major companies have their premises in close proximity to the station.\n\nBoard an airport express train travelling to Drammen or Stabekk if you want to alight at Skøyen."
