        "text": "This page explains how to travel by train from Oslo & Norway to other key European cities, and how to buy the cheapest tickets. Click here to for journeys starting in another city. Information current for 2024.\n\nI want to go from Oslo to...\n\nBefore you buy your tickets\n\nTake a moment to read these tips for buying European train tickets. It answers all the usual questions, \"Must I book in advance or can I buy at the station?\", \"Can I stop off?\", \"Are there Senior fares?\" and that old favourite, \"Should I buy an $800 railpass or a 35 point-to-point ticket?\". How far ahead can you buy train tickets?\n\nEuropean train travel FAQ\n\nOslo to Bergen, Stavanger, Trondheim & other destinations in Norway\n\nNorway's train services have been outsourced route by route to 3 private operators:\n\nVy (www.vy.no) is the former NSB Norwegian State Railways, rebranded to Vy in 2019. Routes include Oslo-Bergen, Oslo-Gothenburg, Oslo-Lillehammer-Dombas.\n\nSJ Norge (www.sj.no) is a Norwegian subsidiary of SJ Swedish Railways. Routes include Oslo-Trondheim-Bodo.\n\nGo-Ahead Nordic (go-aheadnordic.no), routes include Oslo-Kristiansand-Stavanger.\n\nTo find train times and fares on any route with any operator, use entur.no, Norway's government-owned public transport website or use Vy's website, www.vy.no.\n\nBoth sites sell tickets for all the privatised Norwegian operators. Entur.no charges no booking fee, www.vy.no charges no fee for Vy tickets, but adds a booking fee for other operators.\n\nAt www.vy.no, the English button is top right. You can choose to load your ticket into the Vy app, or download it in PDF format which you can either print out or simply show on your phone or laptop. The Vy site has sometimes been known to struggle with overseas payment cards.\n\nYou can also book trains run by SJ Norge & Go-Ahead Nordic (but not yet Vy) at Omio.com, in plain English in multiple currencies, overseas cards no problem, small booking fee.\n\nSeat reservation is compulsory on most long-distance trains, and there are cheap advance-purchase fares if you book ahead so it's well worth pre-booking. Flex is the flexible full-price. Lowfare is a cheap advance purchase fare which only appears if it's available.\n\nOkonomi means standard class.\n\nAny fare including the word Plus, Komfort or Premium (the name varies by operator) means first class with larger seats, more space, laptop power points and complimentary tea & coffee. The actual seats may be exactly the same as the regular seats, but with power outlets at every seat and complimentary tea & coffee, that alone can justify the supplement. Vy Plus class is available on most mainline routes including Oslo to Bergen, Oslo to Gothenburg.\n\nSee here for more advice on using Vy.no including useful Norwegian words and what to do if your credit card is rejected, as their site sometimes struggles with some UK and overseas cards (but they now also accept PayPal!).\n\nThe Norway in a Nutshell tour\n\nThe popular Norway in a Nutshell circular tour takes you from Oslo to Bergen to Flam and back to Oslo over 5 days. Train-based tour specialist Railbookers can sort this for you with train reservations & hotels.\n\nUK call 0207 864 4600, www.railbookers.co.uk.\n\nUS call free 1-888-829-4775, www.railbookers.com.\n\nCanada call free 1-855-882-2910, www.railbookers.com.\n\nAustralia call toll-free 1300 971 526, www.railbookers.com.au.\n\nNew Zealand call toll-free 0800 000 554 or see website.\n\nBack to top\n\nOslo to Stockholm\n\nSJ (Swedish Railways) runs 5 trains a day from Oslo to Stockholm, 2 Intercity trains taking 5h46 and 3 SJ3000 trains taking as little as 5h16.\n\nBoth train types have 1st & 2nd class and a bistro selling snacks, meals and drinks.\n\nCheck train times & buy tickets at one of the following websites:\n\n- Omio.com which links to the SJ ticketing system, same prices, quick & easy to use, small booking fee, no problem with overseas credit cards, you can pay in various currencies including Swedish Kr, £,  and $.\n\n- SJ's own website www.sj.se, you pay in Swedish krona, no booking fee, you can usually choose a specific seat from a seating plan, but it can occasionally be fussy with overseas credit cards. For step-by-step advice on using sj.se, click here.\n\nYou print your own ticket or can show it on your phone.\n\nFares work like air fares, cheap in advance, expensive on the day.
