The Bybrua bridge over the Drammenselva river will be renewed and a safe passage over the river for pedestrians had to be provided with a temporary solution.\n\nJanson Bridging worked out two separate footbridges, that are connected at the riverside by a special platform. The chosen system was the Janson Panel Footbridge (JPB-p) and the stairs and platforms were designed to fit the project requirements. Our client have installed the bridges in spring and summer of 2022."
