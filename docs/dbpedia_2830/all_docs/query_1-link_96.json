The second contract will see track construction and overhead electrification on the railway line. The installation of the electrical and telecommunications infrastructure is another tendered contract for the Drammen – Kobbervikdalen railway section.\n\nCurrently, the ongoing works are carried out in Drammen, where the station upgrades are performed. In Drammen, the project involves track-doubling works for a 10-km line of which 7 km through the tunnel beneath Strømsåsen.\n\nThe project is expected to be completed in 2024 when it will provide double capacity between Drammen and Tønsberg allowing up to four trains per hour and direction on the Oslo – Tønsberg route.\n\nThe Vestfold line project will offer 1.5 million inhabitants increased capacity with more rail services and better punctuality, promoting railways as the most sustainable transport which also contributes to the economic development.\n\nShare on:"
