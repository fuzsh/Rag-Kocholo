        "text": "About the trip\n\nThe Bergen Railway is a seven-hour trip between Oslo and Bergen that’s been voted one of the world’s most beautiful train journeys.\n\nIf you’re traveling from the capital, Oslo, the journey starts in an urban environment and takes you through some of the absolute highlights of Norwegian nature: forested valleys, stunning fjords, and Northern Europe’s largest mountain plateau, Hardangervidda.\n\nWith almost 500 kilometres of railway, you have a unique opportunity to experience many of the dramatic contrasts one finds in Norwegian nature.\n\nDue to Norway's northern climate, the Bergen Railway provides completely different experiences depending on the season in which you travel."
