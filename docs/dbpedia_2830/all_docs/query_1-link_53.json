The conference focused on facilitating meetings between main contractors and suppliers within the field of railway and infrastructure works and within the field of railway systems. There were stands for information and Q&A on the opportunity to learn more about contracting in the Norwegian Market and information on following upcoming construction projects:\n\n• the InterCity project;\n\n• the Ringerike Line and E16 highway, whose works will include several\n\nbridges and tunnels and maybe the longest railway tunnel (23 km) in Northern Europe;\n\n• the construction of 10 km of double-track, 7km of which will be tunnel, from Drammen to Kobbervikdalen and from Drammen and Gulskogen, as part of the ongoing modernization of the Vestfold Line;\n\n• the construction of 14 km double-track from Nykirke to Barkåker with four tunnels totalling 5,3 km and a new station at Skoppum outside Horten, as a part of the on-going upgrade of the Vestfold Line;\n\n• the 10km Sandbukta-Moss-Såstad (SMS) project, part of the Intercity development: a new double-track railway situated on the Østfold Line with the Moss and Carlberg tunnels totaling 5 km;\n\n• the 16,8 km Haug-Seut(HS) project is part of the InterCity development and is situated between the cities of Moss and Fredrikstad on the Østfold Line with 5 tunnels with a combined length of about 1,250m;\n\n• the extension from one to two railway tracks over a 4 km stretch from Venjar to Eidsvoll, and extension of the existing railway track (filling in to Vorma) including a new 7,5 km double railway from Eidsvoll to Langset. The project includes one soft-soil tunnel at Eidsvoll, the Wergeland tunnel will be built in parallel with the 480m existing one;\n\n• the new Kleverud- Sørli- Åkersvika line, composed of a 15.8 km and 14 km double-tracks sections and including the 3,3km Hestnes rock tunnel;\n\n• the double-track railway between Arna and the centre of Bergen, whose main part of the section passes through a tunnel under Mount Ulriken where Bane NOR is building a new, parallel tunnel - New Ulriken tunnel. The existing 7470 m Ulriken tunnel will be upgraded;\n\n• the Arna - Stanghelle projects for the construction of a safer and faster railway (including 2 tunnels of 18,7 km and 8,0 km) and road (including 3 tunnels of 9-10 km) between the two municipalities;\n\n• the Oslo tunnel (Oslo S-Lysaker, Nationaltheatret-Bislett)."
