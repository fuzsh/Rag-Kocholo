        "text": "Brief History\n\nIn the mid-nineteenth century, construction of Norway's railroad network began, and the first line, the Hovedsbanen, opened in 1854, connecting Oslo with the city of Eidsvoll. The rail network expanded in the following decades, including lines such as the Bergen Line (1875) and the Dovre Line (1921). Electrification began in the 1930s, and in 1996 Norwegian State Railways (NSB) was reorganized and the infrastructure transferred to the Norwegian National Rail Administration (Bane NOR). Norwegian passenger railroads continued their development in the 2000s. NSB was renamed Vy, then Vy Tog. Efforts were made to modernize infrastructure and increase train speeds. The Vollerenna-Gardermoen high-speed rail project was launched in 2010. Regional lines were developed, and in 2019 Vy was privatized, bringing new operators to the passenger rail market.\n\nGeneral Information and Statistics\n\nCurrently, the largest passenger rail carrier in Norway is Vy (formerly known as NSB). In 2019, the total number of passengers carried by Norwegian Railways was around 70 million. This includes both long-haul, regional and suburban trains.\n\nThere are 4114 kilometres of railway lines in Norway. the total number of railway stations in Norway is approximately 400\n\nAs of 2017, 306 kilometers of railroads have been electrified, of which 242 kilometers are double track and a 64-kilometer high-speed rail line has been electrified.\n\nWhat connections to other countries there are.\n\nThere are frequent train services to all neighbouring countries including the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, Switzerland, Austria, Czech Republic, Poland and Denmark. There are also direct trains to Hungary, Italy and Sweden.\n\nAre trains fast in Norway in general? How much time to cross the country?\n\nIf you're looking for the fastest way to get around Norway and the rest of Scandinavia, check out the SJ high-speed trains. These fast and modern bullet trains run on routes connecting the Norwegian capital with Stockholm and Gothenburg, as well as major routes in Sweden.\n\nThe high-speed trains can be divided into two classes, the SJ X2 (also known as the X 2000) and the SJ X55 (SJ 3000). Both are painted gray and have similar equipment. However, the SJ X2 was built in 1990, a decade before the other SJ high-speed trains, and is awaiting modernization.\n\nAfter all, both classes of trains can reach speeds of over 200 km/h and are operated by SJ, Sweden's national passenger rail operator..\n\nThe journey from Larvik to Dombås takes 6:29 hours and from Kongsvinger to Bergen 8:27 hours.\n\nWhat railway companies are available?\n\nIn Norway, the main railway company that operates passenger train services is Vy. In addition to Vy, there are a few private companies that operate specific railway services in Norway. For example, Flytoget operates the airport express train service between Oslo Airport (Oslo Lufthavn) and Oslo city center. Another company, Go-Ahead Norge, started operating regional train services in the Eastern Norway region from December 2020, as part of a contract with the Norwegian government.\n\nSJ Nord is also represented in Norway. The Swedish company has recently started operating its trains in Norway\n\nWhat train types are available in Norway\n\nRegular trains operated by the national rail carrier are divided into three types – intercity, regional and suburban.\n\n• Intercity trains are electric passenger trains running 4 times a day on the Bergen, Dovre, Sørland lines and providing a high level of comfort for travelers.\n\n• Regional trains run hourly on the Trunk, Vestfold and Østfold lines. They offer the same high level of comfort as the intercity trains.\n\n• Suburban trains run on many lines connected to the Norwegian cities of Arendal, Bergen, Oslo, Skien, Stavanger and Trondheim. Suburban trains run hourly or every half hour.\n\nAre there high-speed-trains available?\n\nRJ high-speed trains run on routes connecting the Norwegian capital with Stockholm and Gothenburg, as well as on major routes in Sweden.\n\nMost important train stations / hubs.\n\nThe main railway hubs in Norway are Oslo Central Station, Bergen Station, Trondheim Central Station, Stavanger Station, Tromsø Station.\n\nWebsites to buy train tickets for Norway?\n\nhttps://www.vy.no/en , https://go-aheadnordic.com/en/\n\nMobile apps to buy train tickets in Norway?\n\nVy has its own app called \"Vy\".
