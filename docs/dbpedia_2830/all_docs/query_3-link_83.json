        "text": "In the quick calculation above, we assumed you had a private plane and just wanted to know the time in the air from city to city. But for most of us, we're going to be flying on a commercial airline (whether it's first class or coach). So that means we really need to account for all the extra travel time getting to the airport, waiting for our flight, and making it to the destination.\n\nTo give you a better estimate of real-life travel, we've put together a flight itinerary with actual airports. Eventually you'll be able to customize this plan, choosing your own airports and flights. But for now, here's an example we've selected to give you an idea of how traveling might work between airports.\n\nDeparture airport: Oslo Airport Gardermoen (OSL)\n\nArrival airport: Easterwood Airport (CLL)\n\nWith the airports selected, we can estimate the travel time to and from the airport, based on how far the airport is from downtown.\n\nGetting to the airport: 132 minutes\n\nGetting to your destination: 10 minutes\n\nNow finally, let's look at an example flight from OSL to CLL and figure out how long it would take to fly including take-off and landing, and time to taxi on the runway.\n\nCommercial flight time: 10 hours, 24 minutes\n\nSo now we can finally get an idea of the total travel time from Drammen to College Station including time spent getting to/from the airports, an estimated wait time of 2 hours at the airport for TSA security lines and waiting at the gate, and the actual flight itself.\n\nTotal travel time: 15 hours\n\nTo see the details on this flight plan, including recommended airports, airline, and route, check out the flight planner:"
