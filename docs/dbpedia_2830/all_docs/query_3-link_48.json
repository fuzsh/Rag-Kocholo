        "text": "Rock carvings found in the area are 6000 to 7000 years old and are the first signs of human activity in the area.\n\nIn the Viking Age the area was called Dramn or Drofn, a Norse worse that can mean ‘waves’. A the time, the water was 4-5 metes higher than today. In this era, the longships sailed up the fjord and in Snorre’s sagas it is written that Olav the Saint hid from Knut the Mighty in the Drammenfjord.\n\nSaint Hallvard (the saint of Oslo) was killed and sunk in the Drammensfjord in 1043 with a millstone around his neck.\n\nDrammen consisted of three small seaports: Bragernes, Strømsø, and Tangen, all situated around the Drammen River. The geographical location made the city favourable for seafaring, log driving and timber trade.\n\nThe timber trade in Drammen formed the basis for the rise of the city, which in the 18th century developed into one of Eastern Norway’s most important maritime and trading cities. The location by the watercourse and the timber that could be obtained from the surrounding areas provided the basis for industry and other businesses.\n\nThere was extensive timber trade with the Netherlands and Denmark as early as the 13th century. In the 16th century, the Drammen River had extensive timber floating, and sawmills were built by the waterwalls.\n\nDrammen was officially founded on the 19th of June 1811, when the two separate ports of Bragernes and Strømsø were merged to make the town of Drammen. The bridge from Bragernes to Strømsø was completed in 1812 despite major protests from merchants at Bragernes, who feared trade leakage. There was a barrier on the bridge and people had to pay tolls.\n\nLarge parts of the city were ruined in the fire of 12-13 July 1866, which led to the reconstruction of the city centre, including the town square and church. The city planners wanted to build magnificent public buildings and entertainment to support business. The planners announced architectural competitios for the most important buildings. The Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet, who had designed the Stortinget building, designed Børsena nd the Theatre.\n\nThe authorities tried to mandate brick houses, but Norwegians wanted to build in wood. In Drammen, wooden houses with only one floor were allowed. The city panners thought that rising land prices would eventually make it unprofitable to build anything other than multi-story brick houses. The plot owners found they could build wooden houses where the plot was furnished, so the houses actually had two floors. These drammenshus resemble contemporary houses with other Norwegian cities.\n\nThe Drammen Line opened in 1872, providing rail service between Drammen and Oslo.\n\nEventually Drammen became industrialised, with a brickworks established here. In 1847, the Drammens Jernstøberi was established and became one of the country’s most important iron producers of furnaces, machines, cranes and ships. Textile factories were established as well as the shoe factory, which produced more than 50,000 pairs of shoes a year. Norway’s first canning factory was started here.\n\nIn 1909, Drammen got its first trolleybus system in Scandinavia. The lines ran until 1967."
