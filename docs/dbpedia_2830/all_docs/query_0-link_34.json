        "text": "Punctuality is regarded as an important measure of the performance of a railway system, and is the one most commonly used and discussed measure both in the industry and among travelers. In many countries, the punctuality of trains, and thus the performance of the railway system, is deemed as lacking. The aim of this article is to study and quantify how several weather-, timetable, operational and infrastructure-related variables influence punctuality in passenger train traffic. This can contribute to better understanding of the performance of railway systems, and help identify possible improvements. The study is based on a dataset containing detailed timetables and records of all 32.4 million train movements for all trains in Sweden during the year of 2015, over 1.1 million departures. Supporting this is a comprehensive register of over 80 000 infrastructure elements, and almost 87 million weather observations. We consider the size and allocation of margins, the existence of negativ...\n\nThe paper revisits an investigation of delays and punctuality on Norwegian railroads from 2010, re-evaluating its findings and studying the effects of later measures put in place between 2010 and 2014. Norwegian railways saw a steady decline in punctuality from 2005–2010, prompting the establishment of a task force to understand the trends and patterns behind the delays on the network. Data was collected on punctuality and delays, as well as on factors that were likely causes of delays. The original study pointed to three main areas that cause delays during the period 2005–2009: (1) an increased error rate in infrastructure and rolling stock, (2) extensive work close to the tracks due to increased maintenance and renewals and (3) an inability to perform consistently even under normal weather conditions. Measures were put in place to turn around the overall performance. Appending data for 2010–2014, new regression models indicate that although their influence on delays and low punctu...\n\nPunctuality in Sweden has been too low for several years, and there is now a goal in the industry that it must improve by more than five percentage points by 2020. Research has shown that timetable properties affect punctuality, and timetables can be changed relatively quickly and easily, compared to infrastructure and rolling stock. In this paper we study some strategies for assigning margins in timetables, and how they affect punctuality. The aim is to identify changes that can improve the punctuality of passenger trains. The study is based on a dataset containing detailed timetables and records of train movements for all trains in Sweden during the year of 2015, over 1.1 million departures. We find that every additional percentage point of margins improves punctuality by about 0.1 percentage points, and about the same for every percentage point increase in the weighted average distance of margins. It is common for margins on some line sections to be negative, which lowers punctua...\n\nPrevious research has shown that timetables are important for punctuality, and research is ongoing on how to improve timetables through more simulation, optimization techniques, better scheduling of track works, and data analysis. Relatively little attention has been given to the actual planners. In this study, we have conducted interviews with timetable planners in Southern Sweden, and analyzed the interviews with the perspective of explaining Swedish punctuality problems. From these we have identified four common errors in timetables, such as “conflicting train paths at stations” and “insufficient dwell or meet times at stations”. These errors cause, increase and spread delays, and require recurring interventions from traffic control. We also identify 11 reasons for such errors, such as “insufficient time for quality assurance of timetables” and “missing tools for track allocation and conflict management”. We discuss three themes among these reasons: “missing tools and support”, “...\n\nRegularity and punctuality are two very important measures for evaluating the quality of a public transport system. Several indicators can be used to estimate them, each with advantages and disadvantages. The paper comparatively describes a series of such indicators and presents a study conducted for two public transport lines in Sibiu, Romania. The study shows how, depending on the indicators used, the results show the influence of different factors.\n\nThe impact of delays on passenger railways, with specific reference to the national rail network in Great Britain, is examined. A key distinction is made between punctuality (trains running late) and reliability (trains canceled). In Britain these have been combined into a public performance measure, which deteriorated markedly as a consequence of the Hatfield accident in 2000 but has since gradually improved. Causes of delay can be associated with train operators, infrastructure authorities, and external factors. In Great Britain, train operators apparently have been better able to manage delay than the infrastructure authority. Traditional means of valuing delay have used stated preference methods that incorporate a measure of mean lateness and have shown that a minute of late time is typically valued as equivalent to 3 min of timetabled journey time. This is referred to as the reliability multiplier. Studies have also focused on the value placed on the standard deviation of journ...\n\nIn western society time pressure is becoming more and more important in daily life of many people. Travel time is often seen as wasted time and people involved in transport organizations make a great effort to decrease travel times. Examples are enhancing the capacity of (rail)roads, increasingthe frequency of trains, enhancing the mean speed of trains, reducing theinterchange time and so on. Literature on the value of (travel) time suggests that waiting is seen as the most annoying time and people perceive time to pass slower then it actually does. This feeling will be stronger when they have important things to do in advance. Reducing the actual wait will have an effect on the travel time and on the appreciation of the service. It is possible to change the appreciation of the waiting time by makingthe waiting environment more attractive. When people can use their time while travelling in a useful or pleasant way, time seems less useless and customers quality perception of the tota..."
