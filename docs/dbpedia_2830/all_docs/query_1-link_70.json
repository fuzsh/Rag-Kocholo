Situated on the Drammen Line, 14.14 kilometers (8.79 mi) from Oslo S, it also an intermediate station of the Asker Line. Vy serves the station with local and regional, with about 7,000 passengers using the station daily. It is also served by the Airport Express Train and serves as the main bus terminal for the town. The station is elevated and has two island platforms and four tracks.\n\nThe station opened along with the Drammen Line on 7 October 1872, until 1922 being named Sandviken. The original station building was designed by Georg Andreas Bull in Swiss chalet style. The station underwent a renewal from 1917 to 1922, receiving gauge conversion to standard gauge, electrification. A new station building designed by Gudmund Hoel opened in 1919. The tracks east of the station were doubled in 1922, the line westwards in 1958. A new, four-track station building opened in 1994, designed by Arne Henriksen. The Asker Line opened in two stages, in 2005 and 2011."
