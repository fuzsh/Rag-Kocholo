        "text": "B.D. Love, a poet, a writer, a teacher, a musician, a conservationist and a close friend of mine for more than 45 years, has died.\n\nWhen I met Buddy in late-1977, it was at a Flashcubes’ gig at the Brookside Inn, where we played often in our early days. He was Mark Roberts then, a 24-year-old Syracuse University instructor who taught English to freshman, wrote poetry, played guitar – minimally – and “moonlighted” at rock & roll clubs, always looking for the action.\n\nHaving grown up in Michigan, he was steeped in the history of Motor City music – and all music, for that matter. We became instant friends. He was one of many on campus who urged us to seek a booking at the student-run nightclub, Jabberwocky. A large share of the student population was from the tri-state area (NYC/NJ/CT) and were well-versed into the burgeoning new wave and punk scene that spawned The Ramones, Blondie, Television, Patti Smith and many others.\n\nAnd he was right! At Jabberwocky, we blossomed and our fan-base grew quickly. Word spread that there was a new wave band at Jab, and kids showed up in droves. It was a scene, for sure, and I can still remember vividly seeing Buddy jump up onstage to sing the Sex Pistols’ “God Save the Queen” with us. Just a crazy, crazy time.\n\nIt’s been said of the Velvet Underground that they didn’t have the largest following but nearly everyone who did follow them, started their own band. On a much smaller – and local – level, that was also true of the Flashcubes, with The Poptarts, Dress Code, The Trend, The Dead Duck Band, The Ohms and numerous others forming in our wake and helping to create a young and vibrant scene. One of the first was Mark/Buddy. I still remember him snickering as he told me the name of his band: Buddy Love & the Tearjerkers, an homage to the Jerry Lewis character from the film, “The Nutty Professor.”\n\nI have no idea how he did it so fast, especially in mid-semester with his heavy class load (the energy of youth?!), but just two short months later, he and his band were doing an opening set with us at Jabberwocky! It was mostly cool rock & roll covers – the originals would come later – and the playing was primitive (especially Buddy), but energetic and inspired! Along with guitarist Charlie Robbins, bassist Dave DeCirce and drummer Steve Holland, the Tearjerkers opened for the Flashcubes numerous times that year before spreading their wings and doing their own three-set gigs at local clubs.\n\nWith our shared experiences in the local music scene, we became very close friends. Buddy had a certain charisma that drew people to him, myself included. It allowed him to lead a classroom of students and to command the stage as a bandleader. But he was so much more. He was a true raconteur, a wine expert and a gourmet chef. I still remember large dinner parties at his apartment where he would prepare a five-course meal, pairing every course with the appropriate wine. I had never experienced anything like it. And he had the quickest wit of anyone I’ve ever known. Such a brilliant, funny mind.\n\nHis first stint in CNY ended in 1979, when he moved to Texas for what turned out to be an ill-fated romance. But by 1981, he was back in Syracuse, working at a liquor store and putting together his next band, My Sin. In three years time, Buddy had turned himself into a formidable songwriter. With the help of a revolving door of musicians that included Ron Remschel, Keith Vincelette, Sal Stassi, Neils Miller and Curtis Seals, he played countless local gigs and wrote, recorded and released four albums of unique music, inspired in large part by David Byrne, Lou Reed and Roxy Music.\n\nBut, despite his musical success in the local scene, he was missing the classroom. His search for a place to teach again led him to the west coast and to the greatest challenge and the ultimate joy of his life: teaching at California State University in Los Angeles.\n\nOver his 35 years at Cal State, he helped to shape the minds of thousands of young people. His students were mostly Latino and Asian and knew him as Buddy Roberts. He took great pride in tending to the largely-immigrant community – that he felt others in the faculty shunned – and wore his acceptance from them as a badge of honor.\n\nHe was extremely popular among his students (Cal State Professor of the Year in 1992), but not so much by the university hierarchy, with whom he (ever the rebel) regularly butted heads. They didn’t like his unorthodox teaching methods which included taking classes out to rock clubs and assigning some of his own books (written under the pseudonym Lan Yan) as class texts.\n\nIn the years we were separated by an entire continent, we stayed in touch regulary. His three greatest passions were his classes, his writing, and the LA river, which ran behind his backyard in the Atwater Village section of Los Feliz. When I visited him in 1992, we walked along the river – mostly a cement ditch at that time – and he told me of the plans hatched by Friends of the Los Angeles River (FoLAR) to revamp and revitalize the river that traversed over 50 miles with nearly one million people living near its banks. Fifteen years later, the city enacted the LA River Revitalization Master Plan and his dream of a renewed river became a reality.\n\nI also distinctly remember during that trip, talking to him about the riots that took place in LA one year earlier in the wake of the Rodney King beating. There were still entire burned-out blocks not far from his neighborhood. I asked him if he ever thought it might be time to move away, and I’ll never forget his response: “Are you kidding, I’m at the center of the universe, why would I ever leave?”\n\nAlways looking for the action!\n\nIn all the years I have known him, Buddy was never not writing. Writing, for him, was like food and water for the rest of us. He was always creating. Early on it was poems published in nearly every reputed poetry journal he could find.\n\n(https://www.bdlove.org/creative-vita.html)\n\nLater on it became short stories and full-length novels, now under the more scholarly name of B.D. Love. His poetic wordplay was remarkable. As a songwriter myself, I was always amazed – and a little jealous – of how he put his words and thoughts together so perfectly. Even his prose read like poetry! I’ve read everything he published, but if I could urge people to read only one, it would be Song of the Ten Thousands, the story of a young boy of mixed ancestry, abandoned by his parents, who goes to live with his wildly eccentric aunt and uncle in rural Michigan. Just a beautiful story that will stay with you for years to come.\n\nIn 2013, my band The Flashcubes headlined a show in Syracuse called Bright Lights. Using the name of our 1997 album, the show set out to celebrate the scene we helped create 35 years earlier and featured as many of the original bands from that era as we could get to join us, including The Penetrators, The Dead Duck Band, The Trend, Porcelain Forehead, The Most, and Distortion. For the ones who couldn’t join us we enlisted the help of the internationally-known folk pop duo The Kennedys, feauring Maura Kennedy (who was originally from CNY), and her guitar wizard husband, Pete, to do a set of songs by The Poptarts, Dress Code, The Ohms, My Sin and a few others. The show was a huge success and was recorded for posterity. Three thousand miles away, Buddy was thrilled that we had done his My Sin song, “Manifest Destiny,” and loved the recording of Maura and the band performing it. As a courtesy, I connected the two of them, never imaging where that would lead.\n\nOver the next three years, Buddy and Maura wrote dozens of songs together leading to the critically-acclaimed album produced by Pete Kennedy, Villanelle: The Songs of Maura Kennedy and B.D. Love. Released on the Varese Saraband label in 2014, it still stands as some of the best work I’ve heard either of them do.\n\nIn 2016, after over 40 years in the classroom, and weary of his battles with the Cal State administration, Buddy retired from teaching. And, with the dissolution of his longtime marriage, he left his beloved LA River behind and moved back east to suburban New Jersey to be closer to Maura & Pete Kennedy for their ongoing collaboration, to Ron Remschel, a fellow member of his band My Sin, and to his own brother and sisters who also lived on the east coast.\n\nOver the past 8 years, Buddy continued to be productive, writing numerous poems, composing further lyrics for a second album with Maura, and penning a new novel (a sequel to his Song of the Ten Thousands book), that will hopefully be published posthumously. In addition he had been working for several years on an unfinished musical companion compilation to his published book of short stories, A Day In The Life of a Severed Head, featuring songs written and produced by a variety of musicians to go along with the stories in his book.\n\nIn New Jersey he lived a quiet life, with his beloved dog, and two cats, as constant company. He stayed in regular touch with close friends all over the country thanks to the internet, but was still lonely, understandable given his lifetime inclusion in the academic community. He often spoke of how he missed his students and the academic life he had in LA for most of his adult life.\n\nOne bright spot was his participation in a text chain with myself and several friends to opine nearly everyday on politics, music and pop culture. In that group Buddy was by far the most prolific poster, always with great wit, insight and eloquence, plus, of course, that cutting sense of humor. Oh, what a mind!\n\nIn August of last year, he had a catastrophic fall down his basement stairs where he would’ve bled to death had it not been for a life alert bracelet that friends urged to him purchase and wear, due to his unsteady gait (caused by years of suffering from neuropathy in his feet), and as protection against living alone. He was in critical condition for weeks, and then hospitalized for months with tubes in and out of him. He could only talk in a whisper, and was in pretty much constant pain. In the early hours of Memorial Day his body just finally gave out. He would have been 71 in November.\n\nHis ashes will be strewn in the LA River later this year.\n\nPostscript:\n\nIn 2022, I asked Buddy to help me with a lyric for a song I was writing. We had never truly collaborated and I was stuck. I described what I wanted, even suggesting the title, The Sweet Spot. In relatively short order, he delivered the goods. Lyrics so perfectly balanced that when I sat down with my guitar to compose, the song almost wrote itself. I made a quick demo and sent it along. Thankfully, he was thrilled with the results and took the liberty of passing my rather crude demo around to everyone he knew, delighting in, and sharing with me, all of the positive feedback he received.\n\nAs I write this The Flashcubes, still a recording band 47 years on, are in the studio again, and the first track we are working on is The Sweet Spot. I think Buddy would’ve loved it. Nearly 50 years removed from our first meeting at The Brookside Inn… he’s still a part of the action!\n\nAs time goes by, most folks surrender,\n\nBut love is more than just legal tender\n\nHe takes her hand, she holds it tight,\n\nIt’s how it goes, another never-lonely night\n\nThey’ve found the sweet spot, the sweet spot\n\nThrough all those many years\n\nThey’ve found the sweet spot, the sweet spot\n\nGood as gold and true as tears\n\nThey’ve found the sweet spot, the sweet spot\n\nWhere it all comes into view\n\nThe sweet spot, the sweet spot\n\nGood as gold, and just as true… the sweet spot\n\nGary Frenay, June 2024\n\nThe years tick away and so many of the artists I’ve followed and loved throughout my life are either gone (David Crosby, Christine McVie, Mike Nesmith, Emitt Rhodes, David Bowie, Burt Bacharach, the list grows longer by the day) or are now retiring from live performance (Brian Wilson, Rod Argent, Peter Frampton, Jeff Lynne, to name just a few).\n\nIt is with that in mind that I make the effort to travel – sometimes at great distances – to see artists I’ve never seen before (and to see some select favorites one last time). That brings me to 10cc.\n\nAs a lifelong Anglophile, I’ve always been tuned in to artists from England, often long before they ever break in the US. My record collection is chock full of artists who never really “made it” in the US, but who have had great careers, i.e., Paul Weller, XTC, Andy Fairweather-Low, Roy Wood, etc. That was the case with 10cc. I latched onto their first LP in 1973, and was hooked for life. Of course, two years later with their international smash hit, “I’m Not In Love,” that changed. Everyone knew 10cc. At least for a while.\n\nIn the beginning, the band was a very rare combination of individuals: every member was a multi-instrumentalist, singer, songwriter and producer. They were a true musical “four-headed monster,” much like the Beatles in that oft-cited Mick Jagger quote from the 60’s. But in 1976, that original foursome of Eric Stewart, Graham Gouldman, Kevin Godley and Lol Creme, split in two. Godley & Creme struck out on their own, and Stewart & Gouldman carried on as 10cc. Over the next two years, Stewart & Gouldman would score several more US hits (“The Things We Do For Love”, “People In Love” and “Dreadlock Holiday”), before fading into relative commercial obscurity.\n\nIn the early days, they toured the US regularly, but never anywhere near where I lived. They hadn’t been back since the fall of 1978… until last week.\n\nWhen I heard of a new 10cc US tour, I initially had my doubts. With only one original member – Graham Gouldman – in the band, I joked with friends that they should call it 2.5cc. But I was still curious, and from positive reviews online of recent tours in Europe and the UK, I caved. Boy, am I glad I did.\n\nI made the 4-hour drive to Montclair, NJ to see them last week at the Wellmont Theater on the first date of this US tour. Given their low, almost non-existent, commercial profile in America in the 21st century, I honestly questioned how many people would actually show up. Surprise! A nearly-full house. And even more surprising, many younger people.\n\nAfter the opening act – a solo Robin Taylor Zander doing several originals mixed in with a handful of his Dad’s Cheap Trick songs – 10cc took the stage and set about re-establishing themselves to a US audience, 46 years on. The show is billed as the Ultimate Hits Live tour. And some may scoff at that lofty claim, given only five Top 40 US chart appearances in the 70’s. But, with an even dozen hits in their home country, they have plenty of recognizable songs – to us Anglophiles – to draw on. And they played them all.\n\nGouldman stands front and center, playing bass and doing most of the talking. To be clear, he did not sing most of the band’s original hits (that was Eric Stewart), but he did co-write most of them. Indeed his pedigree is more as a songwriter (with over 350 songs to his credit), penning numerous British Invasion songs by the Hollies, Yardbirds and Herman’s Hermits, and who was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2015.\n\nNevertheless, he’s a solid frontman who takes his job as the 10cc standard bearer very seriously, always name-checking his original bandmates for the songs they wrote, and by bringing a band that is meticulous in their preparation and yet joyful in their presentation. And, even though Gouldman was the only “original” member, both the guitarist, Rick Fenn, and the drummer, Paul Burgess, have worked on and off with the touring band since 1976. Keyboardist Keith Hayman, formerly the musical director for Sir Cliff Richards, has been in tow since 2006.\n\nSo the only new guy was multi-instrumentalist Andy Park (acoustic and electric guitars, bass, keyboards and percussion), who in recent years has accompanied Gouldman in his acoustic songwriter shows, dubbed “Heart Full of Songs,” and does an admirable job handling all the higher lead vocals originally sung by Stewart, Godley and Creme. Together, somehow, this five-piece band manages to produce all of the colors in the 10cc palette that made the original records so unique and memorable.\n\nStarting with a rollicking run-through “The Second Sitting for the Last Supper,” an irreverant and somewhat blasphemous reimagining of the second coming of Jesus Christ, they were off and running. From the beginning I was struck by three things: 1) they sounded amazing, instrumentally AND vocally, 2) they were clearly having a ball performing, which is infectious for the audience, and 3) the audience was loving every minute of it. Throughout the set, there were numerous moments when the audience leapt into a spontaneous standing ovation at the end of a song. A 10cc lovefest!\n\nThere were many high points for me, but I’ll name just a few. Hearing them do “Old Wild Men” from the Sheet Music album (1974) was just breathtaking. Sometimes songs grow in power over the years. A song they wrote as young men, now 50 years later, resonates in a different and deeper way:\n\nOld men of rock and roll, came bearing music\n\nWhere are they now?\n\nThey are over the hill and far away\n\nBut they’re still gonna play guitars, on dead strings, and old drums\n\nThey’ll play and play to pass the time… the old wild men\n\nThis was the first song to get a standing ovation. And it was the moment when I realized how special this show was. This audience was filled with diehards. “Old Wild Men” was not a hit… not even a single. Wow!\n\nAnother high point near the end of the set was their version of “I’m Not In Love.” This was a huge record to me when it came out (I literally teared-up the first time I heard it on the radio) and its ascension to near the top of the charts in the spring of ’75 was vindication of my undying fandom at the time. Given the nature of the original studio recording, with hundreds of harmony vocals creating the ethereal backdrop to Eric Stewart’s achingly-beautiful lead vocal, you would think any live version of the song would be a disappointment. But, reinforced by the keyboard textures and the live backing vocals, this live version soared! It was the highlight of many highlights and garnered another standing O.\n\nThere is a point in every live show, especially a live show you that you are loving, that you don’t ever want it to end. I was so immersed in the beauty and magic of 10cc’s performance, I truly felt that. But, with one more song, a rousing version their international hit (“just not in the US”, as Gouldman wryly pointed out) “Dreadlock Holiday,” the lights came up and they were gone.\n\nBut, a hearty and sustained standing ovation brought them back out for what was – for me – the third major high point of the show. Gouldman, Fenn, Hayman and Park gathered around a center stage mic and launched into a gorgeous a cappella version of their first hit from 1972, “Donna.” The song was always a throwback to the 50’s, but never more than in this street corner version. Utterly joyous!\n\nAfter that, they donned their instruments again and closed out the night with a thundering run-through of their first UK #1 hit from 1973, “Rubber Bullets,” with the entire audience standing, singing and clapping along. Just the perfect finish to a perfect night.\n\nThere is a song on their Sheet Music album (1974), called “The Worst Band In The World.” With tongues firmly in cheek, the lyrics say:\n\nIt’s one thing to know\n\nBut another to admit\n\nWe’re the worst band in the world\n\nBut we don’t give a …\n\nWell we’ve never done a day’s work in our life\n\nAnd our records sell in zillions\n\nIt irrigates my heart with greed to know that you adore me\n\nUp yours, up mine, but up everybody’s that takes time\n\nBut we’re working on it …\n\nThe song was a truly funny and cutting send-up of self-important rock bands of the day. And it was always one of my favorites as an example of how smart, funny and self-deprecating 10cc were. Sadly, it was not in the set, but it popped into my mind as we were walking out of the hall. The worst band in the world? Oh, the irony! Because tonight, for me and a thousand other diehard fans, they were clearly the best band in the world.\n\nLastly, it was not lost on me that this incredible show was the opening night of such a long-awaited US tour. If they were this good right out of the box, all I can say is, if they come anywhere near you in the next three weeks, go!\n\nThe set list\n\nThe Second Sitting for the Last Supper (Original Soundtrack)\n\nArt for Art’s Sake (How Dare You!)\n\nLife Is a Minestrone (Original Soundtrack)\n\nGood Morning Judge (Deceptive Bends)\n\nThe Dean and I (10cc)\n\nOld Wild Men (Sheet Music)\n\nClockwork Creep (Sheet Music)\n\nFeel the Benefit (Deceptive Bends)\n\nThe Wall Street Shuffle (Sheet Music)\n\nFloating in Heaven (Graham Gouldman’s new solo album, I Have Notes)\n\nThe Things We Do for Love (Deceptive Bends)\n\nSilly Love (Sheet Music)\n\nFrom Rochdale to Ocho Rios (Bloody Tourists)\n\nI’m Mandy Fly Me (How Dare You!)\n\nI’m Not In Love (Original Soundtrack)\n\nDreadlock Holiday (Bloody Tourists)\n\nencore\n\nDonna (10cc)\n\nRubber Bullets (10cc)\n\nHere, again, is my annual ‘top ten’ list of what I’ve been listening to over the past year. While the manner in which I consume music has changed (thanks to my son, Rob, gifting me a Spotify subscription), I still continue to find great albums that light me up; quality, not quantity!\n\nTen LPs (+2), logged the most playing time on my stereo, iPod, iPhone, car stereo, hearing aids (via bluetooth!) and computer. And, like an issue of AARP, I list the age of the artists as a badge of honor for those who continue to create new music late in life (although there is one true youngster on this year’s list!).\n\n1 Bertolf – Bluefinger (age 43)\n\nI discovered Bertolf in 2009 when a friend turned me on to an early single, “For Life”. I’ve followed his career closely ever since, naming his record, Happy In Hindsight, my #1 record for 2021. I also wrote a blog post about him (https://garyfrenay.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/bertolf-dutch-treat/) in 2015. But, all that said, I was a little wary of this new release. Not being a huge bluegrass fan, I was a little suspicious of his plan to head to Nashville and re-record many of his early “pop” songs with bluegrass musicians. Boy, was I wrong! The result of his Nashville foray is an entirely uplifting songcycle of one great pop song after another, heard in an entirely new light. The song choices are inspired and the playing is magical. Easily my fave record of the year. Highly recommended!!\n\n2 Rolling Stones – Hackney Diamonds (ages 80, 80 & 76)\n\nOh my! Where do you even start to talk about this record? There is no way this should be this good, and yet, it’s an amazing return to form. Eighteen years after their last studio album of all new songs (A Bigger Bang, 2005), the Stones come charging back with songs and a sound that harkens back to some of the best work they did in their heyday of 1968-78. The combination of big riffs and big melodies makes for memorable songs throughout. Jagger and Richards have always been great songwriters (something that seems to get lost in the mythology of the “world’s greatest rock & roll band”), but this album has one great song after another. And the ageless Mick Jagger has rarely sounded better! Purists might say they miss Charlie Watts. He was the heartbeat of the band, after all, but who could do a better job of filling his shoes than the mighty Steve Jordan? And, in a week in this past-November that – amazingly – saw the release of new music by the Beatles and the Stones, Hackney Diamonds was the winner, hands down. And that, from a lifelong Beatles’ fan!\n\n3 Paul Simon – Seven Psalms (82)\n\nI’ve always been amazed by artists who – well into their 80’s – still seek to write and record new music. Recent examples include David Crosby, Burt Bacharach and the above-mentioned Rolling Stones. Artists who clearly have nothing more to prove and yet, they still strive to. Paul Simon is another. His new record came to him in a dream in 2019 that said,\n\n‘You are working on a piece called “Seven Psalms.” ’ The dream was so strong that I got up and I wrote it. But I had no idea what that meant. Gradually information would come. I would start to wake up two or three times a week between 3:30 and 5 in the morning, and words would come, I’d write ’em down, then start to put it together.\n\nThe result is a unique set of seven songs, delivered as one long uninterrupted piece that is, by equal turns, contemplative, questioning, uplifting and – yes – dreamy. Anchored with the recurring motif of the Davy Graham guitar instrumental Anji (Simon featured it on his and Art Garfunkel’s 1966 LP, The Sounds Of Silence), each song deals with matters of life and death and spirituality. This is such a unique record. I know of no one other than Simon who could have created it. But I’m sure glad he did!\n\n4 The Pretenders – Relentless (72)\n\nI seem to have lost track of the Pretenders and, to be honest, haven’t heard the past few records. That said, maybe I’m not qualified to comment on what a return to form this new album seems to be. But I will say that this record (combined with my recent discovery of Chrissie Hynde’s stunning 2019 solo album of covers called Valve Bone Woe) has made me fall in love with her voice and vision all over again and, in a way, I haven’t felt in decades. The songs range from soulful ballads, to simmering mid-tempo songs, to out-and-out rockers, all guided by Hynde’s unerring songwriting style (with bandmate James Walbourne) and that utterly-unique voice of hers. My own personal favorites are “A Love”, “Let The Sun Come In”, and “Merry Window” but, really, there is not a ‘skip track’ on the whole album. It’s all REALLY good!\n\n5 High Flying Birds – Council Skies (56)\n\nI wasn’t a huge Oasis fan in the 90’s, but I did really like their first few records. I tried to follow their later releases but found myself tiring of Liam Gallagher’s voice and of the overall headline-consuming drama of the Gallagher brothers contant battles. I knew that older brother Noel was the songwriting force of that band, and I should have been more interested in his post-Oasis band, the High Flying Birds. So color me a better-late-than-never convert. I heard about this album from a few friends and finally sought it out late last year. I was wholly unprepared for how much I would love it. One song after another with great chords, melodies, lyrics and hooks. Since then, it’s been on my playlist almost constantly. This is just consistently-great guitar pop, with really strong songwriting. And… Noel is a much better singer than Liam. Go figure!\n\n6 Zombies – Different Game (78 & 78)\n\nI know of no other band with a better second (third?) act than The Zombies. While certainly making their mark as a unique sound (keyboards and the breathy vocals of Colin Blunstone) in the guitar-driven British Invasion of the 60’s, the last anyone heard of them was the stunning chamber pop masterpiece Odessey & Oracle in 1968. And then they were gone. In the ensuing three decades after the band split up, keyboardist Rod Argent saw some success with his self-titled classic rock band, Argent, while Blunstone released a few solo LPs that never seemed to gain much momentum. Then in 2001, Argent and Blustone teamed up for a new record, and a few short tours. The reaction to their reforming led them to re-embrace their original band name, and add three new musicians to become a full-time working band again. Since that time, they have released four new albums of great new songs, including this year’s release, and gain induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2019. Combining Argent’s writing and arranging skills with Blunstone’s voice, one of the most distinctive in rock history, the band still sounds at the top of their game.\n\n7 Graham Nash – Now (81)\n\nLike Paul Simon, Nash is another octogenarian still writing and releasing new music. Unlike Simon, he is still touring, almost non-stop. I feel like I’ve been listening to his golden voice my entire life. And, given that my first exposure was hearing the Hollies’ “Bus Stop” on a transistor radio on the way to school in 1966, I pretty much have. At 81, Nash is essentially the same artist he’s always been, with simple pop/folk songs that express mostly personal feelings, with the occasional venture into politics. And that’s fine with me, because his voice is virtually unchanged from the one we all know from his hitmaking years in the 60’s, 70’s and 80’s. Although these songs have little chance of becoming hits anymore in today’s music scene, after two or three listens they will be lodged in your brain as if they were. This is his second album of new songs in the last 7 years, and here’s hoping it’s not his last!\n\n8 Allan Clarke – I’ll Never Forget (81)\n\nThis is, for me, the biggest surprise of the year. With Graham Nash, Allan Clarke started the Hollies in 1962, and here, sixty plus years later, they reunite on this record. Clarke had been missing from the music scene since his retirement from the Hollies in 1999. He re-emerged in 2019 with Resurgence, his first solo record in nearly 30 years. Following that with this one, just four years later was surprising. But the really special story was hearing him reunite with his old pal Nash, who co-wrote several songs and sings harmonies on nearly every track. The result is an album that sounds like equal parts Allan solo record and Hollies reunion album. Really a treat for folks like me who have been listening to Clarke and Nash my entire life.\n\n9 Andy Fairweather-Low – Flang Dang (75)\n\nMy first record store job was at Midtown Records in Rochester in 1974. One of the perks of the job was getting to take home promos of albums that didn’t get much play on the in-store turntable. One of the first records I grabbed was Spider Jiving by Andy Fairweather Low on A & M Records. He was, and still is, a quirky performer with a unique voice and songwriting style, but for some reason, I fell in love with him. That love went even deeper when I found out he had been in a great late-60’s British band, the Amen Corner, who had a string of top ten hits in England, including a cover of a Roy Wood & The Move song, “Hello Suzie”. After his solo record deal ran out in 1980, he spent the next 25 years as sideman extraordinaire to the likes of George Harrison, Pete Townshend, Roger Waters, Eric Clapton & Bill Wyman. But, in 2006, he released his first solo record in decades, Sweet Soulful Music, and I fell in love with him all over again. Zone-O-Tone followed in 2013 and, now, this new one. Wedged in-between those releases have been three live albums, and a ‘Best of’ that gathered all of his early 60’s and 70’s tracks. Andy is, unquestionably, an acquired taste. But for those of us who love him (and I’ve turned on quite a few), we just can’t get enough!\n\n10 Stephen Sanchez – Angel Face (21)\n\nThis is easily the oddest artist on my mostly all-geezer list. A friend turned me on to this record, thinking I might like the throwback crooner style, and she was right! I couldn’t stop playing it (thank you, Cheryl!). How a kid this young can pull off music that sounds this authentically old (classic, is a nicer term), is beyond me. Sanchez sounds at time like Elvis and, at other times, like Roy Orbison. A voice so clear and soulful, you’d think it was created in a lab. Reminds me of the first time I heard Chris Isaak singing “Wicked Game” back in 1989; it totally evoked an earlier time. Big difference is that Isaak was already 33 when he released that record and Sanchez is only 21. The combination of his voice, the simple, yet sophisticated, songwriting, and the spot-on production that never lays it on too thick, makes for a truly memorable debut record. I’ll be keeping my eyes – and ears – open for this one!\n\nHONORABLE MENTION (w/local connections)\n\n11 The Kennedys – Headwinds\n\nMaura and Pete Kenndy are old, old friends. I was in a songwriting workshop with Maura in the late-80’s and I played their wedding in 1993. We collaborated numerous times throughout the years with both of them contributing to my records, Jigsaw People (1996) and File Under Pop Vocal (2015). But beyond those collaborations, I’m just a big fan of what they do. After releasing over 20 albums (together and solo) over their first twenty years together, Headwinds is their first release in five years; long-awaited, to say the least. And what a beautiful set of songs it is! I could list song after song that I love on this album, but just listen once to “Late September Breeze”. The way Pete’s guitars blend with Maura’s voice is pure magic. And, while their songwriting seems deceptively simple, the melodies soar in unique ways and lyrics are always thoughful and evocative. Really fine work!\n\n12 Ceili Rain – Crash The Gate\n\nThe leader of Ceili Rain, Bob Halligan, is also an old friend who I’ve had the joy – over many years – of crossing paths with on various musical endeavors, going back to Flashcubes/Pictures shared bills (in the late-70’s), BeatleCUSE shows, and his wonderful Bells of Dublin Christmas concerts I was lucky to be a part of. Arty Lenin and I actually contributed vocals to one track on here “Twenty Seconds”, but the reason the album is added to my year-end list is the quality of Bob’s writing. This is an amazing collection of songs! Every time I spin this I have a new favorite. One day it’s “Love Corporation”, the next day it’s “One Pull Nearer The Shore” (what a great metaphor!), the day after that, “I Can Believe” or the charming “Birdhouse”. For those who don’t know, Halligan is the second most famous songwriter to come out of central New York (the first being the legendary Jimmy Van Huesen, who back in the day, wrote songs for Frank Sinatra, Bing Crosby and Dean Martin, and went on to win three Academy Awards). While Bob readily defers to Van Huesen’s resume, his own is mighty impressive too, with covers of his songs by Judas Priest, Blue Oyster Cult, Kiss, Kathy Mattea and Cher, among many others.\n\nMusic history lies unnoticed in the basement of the Kimmel dining hall at Syracuse University. Walk into the recently renovated and retooled computer cluster some evening, and you’ll find a dozen or so students quietly working away. Now known as MakerSpace (http://makerspace.syr.edu/), it is a cutting-edge workshop area for tech-savvy students to realize their dreams, complete with 3D printers, computer-driven engravers and even a hi-tech embroidery machine . But had you been in the same spot nearly 40 years earlier, you would have seen James Brown playing to a standing-room-only crowd of more than 200 people.\n\nClose your eyes and the Godfather of Soul is doing splits on a stage too small to contain his unbridled energy, much less his eight-piece band. His keyboard player is forced to set up next to the 24′ by 16′ platform. The small club is hot and smoke-filled, with brightly colored stage lights illuminating the haze. The crowd — a mix of students and locals — is on its feet dancing along with the loud, pulsing sound of the so-called “hardest working man” in show business. In a flash, Brown, in one of his famous set pieces, is on his knees, spent and sweating profusely, and his aide of 25 years, brother Danny Ray, is draping a cape over the prone performer and leading him off the stage.\n\nOpen your eyes and a young student carefully places her own cape over the back of a chair and sits at a computer terminal near large typed signs, urging students: “SAVE YOUR FILES,” and – ironically – “NO DRINKING!”\n\nClose them again and 30 years earlier Danny Ray is urging the crowd to chant, “James Brown! James Brown!” until the great soul man returns to the stage for one more song and one last driving, funk-drenched performance.\n\nForty-eight hours later, the club called Jabberwocky would close its doors for good.\n\nFrom 1969 to 1985, Jabberwocky made its mark as “clearly the greatest live venue in the history of Central New York.” That’s according to Frank Malfitano, founder and director of Syracuse M&T Jazz Fest. The list of performers that graced Jab’s stage backs up that statement and reads like the hallowed walls of the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame: James Taylor, Bonnie Raitt, Jackson Browne, Buddy Guy, Talking Heads, Roger McGuinn.\n\nTo understand why Syracusans hold the club in such high esteem today, three decades after its demise, you have to go back to the beginning: to the late 1960s, the Vietnam War Era, to Woodstock and the age of student activism, and to a campus with no student center.\n\nFrom vacant basement to vaunted venue\n\nMike Greenstein, former editor of the Syracuse New Times, was a senior at SU in the fall of 1969. He recalls that Jabberwocky began as the administration’s response to student lobbyists.\n\n“At that time, there was no student union,” he said. “But there was a group called University Union.”\n\nOne of UU’s aims was to get the university to build a student union building. While that goal wouldn’t be realized for another 16 years, the university’s short-term solution was to offer the students use of the vacant basement of a dining hall. In that dark, unexcavated space Jabberwocky was born, using the design of SU architecture student Ray Cook.\n\nIt was a small club, just 2,800 square feet with low ceilings, dark corners and, as Greenstein recalled, a “flypaper floor” that clung to your feet when the club heated up. There were three large support pillars (2′ x 2′) spread evenly throughout the room that blocked the view for anyone unfortunate enough to end up behind one. The murky effect of the black walls was lessened somewhat by several large colorful murals of characters from the Lewis Carrol classic “Alice In Wonderland.”\n\nThe small stage originally loomed at the far end of the room, opposite the entrance and — oddly — in front of the bar.\n\n“I could hang behind the band and stay there all night, and nobody would hassle me,” Greenstein said. “Maybe the sound was better out front, but I was able to get so much closer to what was going on and I really liked that. No other place I can remember had that situation.”\n\nWhen filled with people, the pervasive smell of stale beer and cigarette smoke was inescapable. So was the vibe. This was rock & roll (and folk, blues and jazz) up close and personal. Jab’s cramped quarters did not allow for much in the way of staged shows and theatrics, but it made up for that with intimacy. The stage was so small that larger bands, like Southside Johnny & the Asbury Jukes (a ten-piece band), spilled over onto the floor, with band and crowd truly becoming one.\n\nJabberwocky was originally envisioned as a place where students could gather — a de facto student union. For some at SU, having an on-campus bar that also served food was a real improvement, but others wanted more. They wanted music.\n\nA pair of ‘knuckleheads’ bring Jab to life\n\nSU student Jeff Onore was head of the concert board in the early 1970s and was active in bringing national acts to the university. College campuses, with their young, captive audiences, were fertile ground for new artists looking for airplay and record sales. While other colleges in the northeast had clubs nearby — Toad’s Place in New Haven (near Yale) and Passim in Cambridge (near Harvard), for example — Jab had the rare distinction of being located right on campus. That and its proximity to New York City, made it a much-sought-after stop on many young performers’ itineraries. According to Onore, all he had to do to take advantage of that opportunity was pick up the phone.\n\n“I thought it was always a case of, the phone rang and someone said, ‘we’d like to fill in a date, or give us a spot and we’ll fill in around it with a date in Oswego,’ or whatever,” he said during a phone interview.\n\nJeff’s brother, Eric, ran Jab while Jeff was guiding the concert board. The two fast-talking brothers from New Jersey are often given credit for the variety of music at SU in the early 1970s. But Onore doesn’t see it that way.\n\n“After we quit, the campus papers did make us sound like we were brilliant, angry, protesting geniuses,” he said. “But we were just knuckleheads.”\n\nMalfitano offers his own perspective.\n\n“These guys deserve some major recognition for their programming brilliance and also for their sheer genius and determination in creating the best live music venue we’ve ever known,” he said. “And in the basement of Kimmel Dining Hall no less.”\n\nWAER and the pre-digital days of live music\n\nA big part of Jab’s success in attracting talent was WAER, the campus FM radio station which aired live broadcasts of many Jab shows. The student-run station’s programming was as diverse as its on-air student deejays, and its appeal and influence was felt throughout Central New York. It was common in the early days of Jab for artists to do three nights in a row, with WAER airing the first night live on the radio. The exposure would help draw customers for the remaining two nights.\n\nEqually important for Jabberwocky was WAER’s status as a reporting station, which logged artist airplay and fed the info to trade magazines like Billboard and Cashbox. In the pre-digital days, airplay on a ‘reporting station’ was gold to a record label.\n\n“WAER was a tastemaker,” said long-time Syracuse talent agent (and current SU music industry chair) David Rezak. “There were times when artists played at Jab because they wanted to get broken on WAER. Many of the shows were broadcast live because WAER was actually involved in setting them up.”\n\nMany such recordings still survive on Internet bootleg sites. One such recording is a live concert from 1979 by ex-New York Dolls front man David Johanssen. It is a less-than-shining reminder of what can go wrong in a live broadcast.\n\nEric Frankel, currently the CEO & founder of AdGreetz, and former president of Warner Brothers Cable Distribution, was the head of the SU concert board at that time. He recalled trying to assure Johannsen and his manager that the wire they saw running out the door and across Waverly Avenue was just a rudimentary communication between the club and his office. It was, in fact, the rather primitive feed from which WAER got the club’s signal to broadcast the concert.\n\n“So Rich Sutton introduces the show: ‘Ladies and gentlemen, live on WAER, David Johanssen’ — we’ve got the tapes still,” Frankel recalled. “Halfway through the concert, a truck with studded tires, cuts the wire, and Rich then throws on a David Johanssen live record. The rest of the concert he broadcasts was actually from a promotion-only live album.”\n\nFrom James Taylor to Talking Heads\n\nWhile the names that graced Jab’s tiny stage in the seventies and eighties seem impressive today, at the time, they were mostly young, working musicians who were just starting out. Like broadway shows that have traditionally opened on the road, Syracuse was a good out-of-the-spotlight venue for new artists to find their footing.\n\nJames Taylor, with just one overlooked LP to his credit, had yet to release his breakthrough second album, “Sweet Baby James” when he played at Jab in February, 1970. The Mahavishnu Orchestra’s debut album, “Inner Mounting Flame,” had only been out for four months in November of 1971, when the band rattled the walls of the small cub in what many recount as the loudest, most intense, live show they ever witnessed. Trumpeter Wynton Marsalis, at 20, had just left Art Blakey’s Jazz Messengers when he led a piano-less quartet into Jab in April, 1982. When Talking Heads appeared at Jab in early 1977, as a trio of quirky art-school-graduates-turned-new-wave-musicians, they had just released their first single, “Love Goes to Building on Fire,” and apologized onstage for repeating a song because they didn’t have enough material for an entire night.\n\nUnlike venues today that focus on one genre to regularly attract a core audience, Jab presented a diversity of musical styles. Blues, folk, jazz, rock, country and even comedy — all shared equal billing.\n\nOne comedy show helped shape the careers of two Syracuse-born comedians, Bob Goldthwait and Tom Kenny. Both comics, now nationally-known, credit the Jab for their first encounter with a live stand-up comic and as the first place they were paid to perform comedy. In 1979, they were underage high school students from the suburbs and aspiring performers who bluffed their way into the club with fake IDs to see a performance by comic Richard Belzer. Belzer’s film, “The Groove Tube,” was screened just before he came out to do his act. Kenny (who has since become famous as the cartoon voice of TV’s SpongeBob Squarepants) recalls seeing Belzer, who he called a “weird-looking guy” through rose-colored glasses.\n\n“I was so unsophisticated about stand-up that I didn’t really look around and say, ‘Wow, he’s standing onstage in this stinky beer-smelling bar, trying to do, kind of, smart stand-up,'” Kenny said. “I just thought, ‘Wow, it’s so great that he’s here and people are pretty much listening to him.'”\n\nLike Kenny and Goldthwait, an entire generation of Syracusans found their way to the SU hill to mingle with the campus population in Jab’s melting pot. Unlike today, when most campus events seem to be ‘campus-only’ events, concerts at Jab were not only open to the public, but were actively advertised. Bill Holmes managed Jab in the late 1970s and cites that as part of an overall marketing strategy at the time. He convinced the university to put ads in the local papers and place spots on WAQX-FM and other commercial stations in an effort to try to reach out to the community.\n\nAnd it succeeded, long before today’s Connective Corridor efforts to link the campus and the community.\n\n“Long before Nancy Cantor came to town espousing the elimination of the gap that exists between town and gown, using the arts as a linchpin to connect, Jabberwocky was already performing that function,” said Malfitano. “Students and townies met there nightly and weekly and the best and brightest from those two disparate worlds found one another through the music and a common place to share it.”\n\nFor diehard local music fans, Jab was the place to be. Gretta Gallivan was a high-school student from Marcellus when she first went to Jab in the fall of 1972.\n\n“For me it was as important as, say, the Bottom Line or CBGB’s (NYC clubs)…sort of in between,” she said. Another local music fan, Bill Baldwin, recalls three things that made Jab special for him: the live broadcasts, the proximity to the stage (“you could stand with your feet touching it”) and the dressing room. He would often call friends who weren’t with him at the club, and tell them to listen to WAER to hear what they were missing. It was also a great environment for meeting the musicians. “They had their tiny little dressing room area,” said Baldwin, “but then they usually came out right after their set and just sat around in the club.”\n\nSyracuse music fans weren’t the only ones drawn to Jabberwocky. Many locals bands found success playing for Jab’s cosmopolitan crowd, and my own band, the Flashcubes, was one of them. In 1978, as a new wave/punk band in a city then-ruled by southern rock and disco, we had a hard time finding an audience: we were the proverbial square peg in the round hole. For the Flashcubes then, Jabberwocky was a kind of salvation and playing there was our breakthrough. At last we had an audience who ‘got’ what we were all about. Many of them were from downstate – with access to New York City – and had seen Blondie, Patti Smith, and the Ramones at CBGB’s. We became their token new wave band and, as the word spread, began to play to sold-out crowds of enthusiastic, pogo-dancing students.\n\nThe end of an era\n\nJab was originally set up as a mostly student-run facility, with little interference from the university. By 1977 that began to change. When the Onore brothers were leaving SU, the administration insisted on a full-time professional manager for the club; a grown-up.\n\nDesi Day was 28 at the time that she interviewed for the position. With a background that included managing several restaurants and working at a small non-profit agency, she landed the job.\n\n“[SU] felt a full-timer could devote more time and energy to the club,” she said. “Money was always missing, and sex, drugs and rock ‘n’ roll was nothing but a nightmare for them.”\n\nDay’s hiring was the first of several university steps toward streamlining the operation and taking control. By 1979, when Bill Holmes was hired as Day’s successor, the kitchen had been shut down to cut costs. Holmes laughs as he remembers one particularly unexpected problem.\n\n“They used to have a thing at Jab, where if the men’s basketball team scored more than 100 points, everybody got free french fries [at Jab], and, of course, the first year we didn’t have any food,” he said. “But one of the nights the basketball team went nuts, there was a whole crowd of people who came down looking for french fries.”\n\nAt the dawn of the 1980s, there were more changes for Jab than just cutting out the famously-large servings of fries. New wave acts — national and local — were gaining popularity, MTV had debuted (with a whole new generation of telegenic stars who didn’t need to tour to sell records) and WAER’s freewheeling format was coming under fire.\n\nBy early 1983, after months of student protest over the impending format change, the university had installed a professional manager at the radio station and effectively put an end to 36 years of student-run college radio. The format was changed to jazz, with NPR news features, and occasional one- to two-hour programs of blues, folk and world music — and no more live broadcasts.\n\nJoe Bronowich was the student in charge of booking bands at Jab from 1981 until it closed. He remembers the battle for control of WAER as a traumatic experience for the whole campus.\n\n“As someone who worked closely with college radio at the time [he was also the CBS Records student representative], WAER was great – almost too great,” he said. “What they did to it was criminal.”\n\nBut there were two other factors on the horizon that would lead to Jabberwocky’s ultimate demise in the spring of 1985.\n\nThe student center that University Union had been lobbying for back in 1969, when the administration gave them Jab, was about to become a reality. The university broke ground on the Schine Student Center in early 1984, and designated a 400-capacity room (dubbed the Milky Way) to be a performance space, replacing Jab.\n\nThe main difference, of course, was that there would be no liquor.\n\nJab’s last hurrah: A ‘proper sendoff’\n\nOn July 17, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed the National Minimum Drinking-Age law, mandating that all states had two years to raise their minimum drinking ages to 21 or risk losing federal highway funding. New York State agreed to fall in line by the summer of 1985. For Jabberwocky, an on-campus bar where, suddenly, three-quarters of the undergraduate population would no longer be admitted, the end came swiftly.\n\n“The last few years, as people stopped giving a shit about live bands, were very, very tough,” said Bronowich. “By ’85 we couldn’t get people in the door with free drinks, and only our oldies night — Wednesday — remained a big hit; the highlight of which was when the DJ played ‘Spiders and Snakes’ [a novelty record by Jim Stafford].”\n\nThere is a scene in the 1978 John Belushi film, “Animal House,” where the Delta House frat members are facing extinction at the hands of an evil university dean, who wants to shut them down. They face being individually expelled and collectively thrown off campus. Their solution to impending doom is articulated by Belushi’s character Bluto, a drunk and disheveled seventh-year senior who exclaims, “Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no, what we need is a toga party!”\n\nThe end of Jab was kind of like that.\n\nWith Bronowich — as Belushi — leading the charge, Jabberwocky went out in grand style. Using money squirreled away from Miller Beer sponsorship dollars into a rainy day slush fund, he and his campus advisor, Marissa Arezzi, earmarked $25,000 for a final week of concerts that would give Jab, what he now refers to as, “a proper sendoff.”\n\nThe first night, a Tuesday, had blues greats John Hammond and Junior Wells. Wells had, not coincidentally, played the first show at Jab in 1969. Bronowich vividly remembers Wells onstage, having drunk ‘enough vodka to drown Russia,’ and declaring, “I opened this [expletive] house and now I’m gonna close this [expletive] house!”\n\nWednesday night featured folk rock pioneer Roger McGuinn (Byrds), opening for Jorma Kaukonen (Jefferson Airplane, Hot Tuna) and his band. Kaukonen had a bit of a reputation at Jab for having punched several holes in the dressing room wall in 1979, but all was forgiven for one last memorable night.\n\nPeople who frequented Jabberwocky carry many memories with them: experiencing great live music in an intimate setting, drinking with friends, dancing until 2 a.m. and for some, yes, even the french fries. But the granddaddy of them all, the night that no one who was there has ever forgotten, is James Brown, live on stage, during Jab’s closing week. Bronowich had tried to get Brown for the closing night, Friday, but he was already booked, so he settled for Thursday. As the manager of the club, Bronowich had access to Brown and his band that no one else did and his memories of that day are lively: drinking vodka at 10 a.m. with Brother Danny Ray, learning that everyone in the band referred to their leader as ‘Mr. Brown’ (whether he was present or not), and being summoned to the star’s dressing room where he was chewed out for allowing profane graffiti on the walls (“I am a man of God and this is an embarrassment!”).\n\nThen there were the concerts.\n\n“They were breathtaking. I mean magical, once in a lifetime unbelievable,” said Bronowich. “He did not disappoint in any way. The slides, the splits, the cape…all of it, exactly like you’ve seen on TV. People went nuts, both shows,” which were, of course, sold out; standing room only. Musicians, politicians, faculty, music fans – student and local, working class and white collar — all stood shoulder to shoulder to see James Brown.\n\nJoe Viscomi is a realtor in Skaneateles and remembers that night in 1985 clearly. “We’d be dancing right next to him and you could feel his body tremble,” he recalled. “Just an awesome performance. I remember leaving and saying, ‘Wow, this man gave us his all.'”\n\nJames Brown was a hard act to follow, but there was still one last night of music open to the public at Jab, with John Cale (Velvet Underground), and several members of Funkadelic, billed as Bernie Worrel and Friends. Bronowich swears it was an incredible night of music, but qualifies that statement, saying “I think it was, but I really can’t remember because I got very, very drunk.” The staff and several returning alumni met the next night to settle business, dismantle the club and, according to Bronowich, “finish all the booze.”\n\nThe Schine Student Center opened that fall, with Jab’s supposed replacement, the Milky Way. It had shiny new floors, white walls, really poor sound and no alcohol. It failed miserably. Unfortunately, Jab’s legacy of great music in an intimate setting on the SU campus did not survive. There are still concerts on the SU campus, done on a larger scale, but there would never be another Jabberwocky. Its time had come and gone.\n\nGone, but not forgotten.\n\nThe legacy of Jabberwocky lives today in the recollections of people who spent large measures of their lives there: where friendships formed, glasses were raised, and unforgettable live music was the soundtrack to it all.\n\nBill Holmes is philosophical about what he and others accomplished at Jab.\n\n“Create an atmosphere where people could have a good time and feel like it was a place where they wanted to be, and they’d talk about it years later; and people are, which is pretty cool,” he said.\n\nBut it is Joe Bronowich, who was there at the end, who gets the last word. “The great, unique, and wonderful thing about Jab was that unlike almost every other club in the world, we were not required to make a profit, ” he said. “And we sure didn’t. We could book whoever we wanted for whatever reason we wanted. The music always came first.”\n\nIn 1994, nine years after Jabberwocky closed, Bronowich returned to SU for his sister’s graduation. He took his wife to the computer cluster that had been Jab, to show her where he had spent the majority of his four years in college.\n\n“As I was standing there pointing to where the stage was, the kid working there came up to me and said, ‘Can I help you with something?'” Bronowich recalled. “I thought we were getting kicked out. So I turned and said, ‘No man, I just used to work here when it was a club.’ He asked ‘Really? Is it true James Brown played in here?'”\n\nLocal Syracusans recount their favorite Jabberwocky memories\n\nMatt Driscoll (former Mayor of Syracuse): Yes, I do remember the Jab. It was a great place to go. I saw lots of bands and always had a nice time. I remember it when it was the dead of winter and I would walk into a place that had that beatnik feel to it, very funky and I always had a great time!\n\nTom “SpongeBob” Kenny (comedian and actor): My favorite Jabberwocky show was this band The Morells, from Missouri, with this great bass player named Lou Whitney, and his wife, who was an older woman who played keyboards. They were kind of like a weird garage rockabilly band. They put out an album called “Shake and Push,” that I still have. Remember the song, “Growin’ A Beard”? A really hilarious song.\n\nFrank Malfitano (Syracuse M & T Jazzfest founder and director): It would have to be Weather Report in 1972, during the “Sweetnighter” LP period. With Eric Gravatt on drums, Dom Um Ramao on percussion, Mirolsav Vitous on upright bass and of course group co-founders, saxophonist Wayne Shoter and keyboardist Joe Zawinul. I went with my friend, bassist Jack Holton. Absolutely everything about it was memorable, but especially their extended version of “Boogie Woogie Waltz” and their rendition of Miles Davis’s “In a Silent Way.” The sets were incredible but even more incredible was the fact that Jack and I were hanging out with the band in the one-room all-purpose dressing room that was located near the club’s front entrance. We just kept laughing at one another the entire time. I don’t think either one of us actually believed that we were sitting there talking music with two of the greatest geniuses in the history of contemporary jazz. It was an amazing night and one I’ll never forget.\n\nBob Goldthwait (Comedian, actor & producer): I remember being in high school and seeing David Johanssen there. That was a big show…really great. But it’s funny, when I think about it, because I performed there, and did a lot of shows and went to a lot of shows there, that when you mention the Jab, what I really think about is roadie-ing for Tom (Kenny) and the Tearjerkers. I remember their guitarist Charlie Robbins had me tuning guitars, and I’m pretty much tone deaf, so it was like (laughs), “let’s have the underaged drunk kid do it….who’s tone deaf!”\n\nDavid Rezak (former Syracuse talent agent and current SU Music Industry chair): It’s not very reflective of my tastes, but Mahavishnu Orchestra with John McLaughlin. My roommate and I were crashing on my couch and we were listening to the WAER broadcast of the first show of their three-night gig, which was two shows a night. And we went, ‘holy shit, listen to these guys,’ so we jumped in the car and went down there and saw the second show that night, and the first and second show the next night. I can vividly remember the third night: we had enough money to pay to get into the first show and it was a pouring rain night, you remember how there was like a porch out there? It was kind of chilly and pouring rain and we’re standing out there hoping, because we don’t have enough money to go back in and see the second show. And McLaughlin walks out and he recognizes us from the whole damn weekend, y’know, and he had a Scottish brogue and he said “what’s a matter, lads, yer lookin’ so long in the face?” We said that was the last show we could see cause we were out of money and he puts his arms around both of us and ushers us back in the door…so we got to see the last show, too (laughs). And what an unbelievable band that was. Billy Cobham, Jerry Goodman on violin, and Jan Hammer.\n\nGary Frenay (lead singer & founding member of The Flashcubes):\n\nMarch 25th, 1978 was our third gig in as many months at Jab, and the place was sold out. Maybe it was the cover article in the Syracuse New Times the month before, or the cover article in the Student Report that week (featuring a cover photo of then-Chancellor Melvin Eggars with a safety pin through his cheek and the lyrics of our latest anthem “Student Rape” splashed beneath his defiled mug), or the Flashcubes posters we had plastered the phone poles and kiosks of Marshall Street with, that scribbled with come-ons of “free cocaine” and “live sex acts on stage” (all empty promises). The first two times at Jab were memorable, because for the first time in our short career, the majority of the crowd was there to see us, which was NOT the case in the clubs we’d been playing in the suburbs. But this time, word of mouth had gotten around campus and, coupled with the local press coverage, had created an anticipation that was building, awaiting our arrival on stage. As we made our way to the stage, guitars raised above our heads to shoulder our way through the packed house, the noise rose in the room, and the crowd pushed forward towards the front of the stage. This was it, this was what we’d been working for, and what we imagined it could be like. We launched into the opening chords of “Student Rape” and the the whole place began to pulse. Kids careening into each other, spilling beer everywhere, and having nearly as good a time as we were. By the end of our performance – two hours later – more than a dozen people had jumped on staged, we encouraged that, and were commandeering our microphones and shouting the words to our closing number, “Got No Mind”. What a night!\n\nWith his passing last week at the age of 94, Burt Bacharach has been on my mind almost constantly. I’ve been obsessed with his music almost as long as I was aware of what was coming out of our family’s AM radio in the early 1960’s. I’ve always maintained that the music we hear in our early formative years – say ages 10 to 14 – gets indelibly stamped in our psyches. It becomes the bed that everything we like and discover throughout our long listening lives, rests on. We may branch out, and discover new, exciting sounds, songs and artists along the way, but those early favorites always maintain a hold on us, a deep source of comfort, and a place to return to over and over again as we grow and age.\n\nI remember seeing a Leonard Bernstein special on TV in the late-60’s where he talked about a composer’s “musical voice,” a concept that was new to me. He wasn’t talking about a singing voice, or even the way someone played an instrument; he was talking about composition. He explained that the great composers all had a unique musical voice. The way they constructed a melody, the rhythm and – especially – the chord changes they used underneath those melodies and rhythm, was a very specific product of their individual musical DNA. I’m sure he played some examples to display the evidence of his theory, but to be honest, I don’t recall them. But the concept of a “musical voice” embedded deeply in my soul.\n\nAs a songwriter myself, AND a voracious, lifelong record collector, I was always someone who looked at the songwriting credits on the record label to see who created the magical sounds I was listening to. With bands like the Beatles and the Beach Boys, it was usually members of the band that were listed, but in numerous other singles of the era, there were songwriting teams – usually two names, sometimes more – that were then foreign to me. It seemed amazing to me that so many of the records I loved had names on them like, Goffin & King, Barry & Greenwich, Mann & Weill, Holland, Dozier & Holland, and Bacharach & David.\n\nBrill Building songwriters (l-r): Cynthia Weill, Carole King, Barry Mann & Gerry Goffin\n\nI tried to learn everything I could about who these people were. But more importantly, I began to understand Bernstein’s concept of a musical voice. Whether it was a girl group record, or something by Bobby Vee or the Drifters, I could “hear” Carole King’s musical voice; a melodic interval, a surprising chord change, and maybe an unexpected key change near the end, that were all hallmarks of her style.\n\nI made similar inroads with the other writing teams I previously mentioned; all wonderful. And then there was Burt Bacharach.\n\nWhen I was on this songwriters-as-artists quest in the 60’s and 70’s, there was no internet, no Wikipedia that collected all of the world’s information in one place, making it so easy to access. I had to dig. I started going through every 45 I owned, checking for songwriting credits, making lists, and listening to hear the composer, and not just the singer.\n\nMy older brother Bob had a great collection of 45s, accrued through swapping lunch items on his school bus, with a girl whose Dad owned a diner with a jukebox. Our Mom’s homemade cookies became a yellow Sun single by Jerry Lewis, or a Cadence Records copy of “Bye Bye Love” by the Everly Brothers. With little disposable income, he compiled an impressive collection of singles that I, six years younger, devoured like a starving child.\n\nIt seemed like the names Bacharach & David were on so many of my favorite records by artist like Gene Pitney, The Shirelles, Gene McDaniels, Sandie Shaw, Jackie DeShannon and, of course, Dionne Warwick. I even saw his name on my Introducing The Beatles album, for their version of “Baby It’s You.” After seeing the Bernstein TV special, I finally understood what tied all of those disparate artists together for me; it was Bacharach’s melodies and chords. No matter who was singing it, or playing it, there was something recognizable about a Bacharach composition that I began to key in on. I became obsessed.\n\nI started combing through every record I owned, and through friends collections, looking for the names Bacharach & David. And it seemed like he was everywhere! On hit singles, b-sides and album cuts. In my quest, I uncovered dozens of songs I had always loved, but now knew they were written by this magical man, Burt Bacharach.\n\nI started compiling my finds on Burt mix tapes. Songs by the 5th Dimension, Manfred Mann, Tom Jones, The Searchers, The Walker Brothers, Marty Robbins, Perry Como (?!), Dusty Springfield, B.J. Thomas; was there any artist who hadn’t covered a Bacharach/David song?! I listened to them over and over, marveling at the melodic intervals he invented, the unusual chord changes he used, and the broken rhythms that he somehow made seem smooth in the way he put it all together.\n\nThe music of Burt Bacharach has been a constant throughout my life. From “Walk On By” in 1962 (when I was 9 years old) to the most recent songs he wrote with Nashville songwriter/producer Daniel Tashian, released just last year, and nominated for a Grammy in the Best Traditional Pop Album category. Think about that; nominated for a Grammy for new music, written in his 90’s? That’s an achievement that is unprecedented.\n\nWhat’s also unprecedented, is the sheer range of his career. He studied under the famous French modernist composer Darius Milhaud at McGill University in the 40’s (some of Milhaud’s other notable students included Dave Brubeck, Philip Glass and Karl Stockhausen), and he toured Europe in his late-20’s as the bandleader and conductor for the international screen legend, Marlene Dietrich.\n\nBut composition was always his main love, and that led him to New York City and the Brill Building, a songwriting factory of sorts where he eventually became paired with the great lyricist, Hal David. Teaming up with singer Dionne Warwick, the trio produced an amazing run of singles and albums from 1962 to 1971, and a catalog of remarkable songs that have been covered by over 1,000 different artists over the last six decades. Unbelievable!\n\nAfter his association with Hal David ended in 1973, Bacharach found new partners and fresh challenges in every decade of his long, creative, life: Broadway shows, film scores, instrumental albums, appearances in films and concert tours all over the world. I was lucky enough to see him in concert twice; once in 2002 at the Showroom at Turning Stone Casino, and again at Embarcadero Park in San Diego (with a full orchestra) in 2013. To see him live, conducting the band or orchestra, playing piano, and singing (in his broken, but always-charming hoarse-sounding voice) is something I’ll never forget.\n\nIn his last three decades, Burt found new challenges, writing with Elvis Costello, Broadway lyricist Steven Slater (a wonderful new show, Some Lovers, that unfortunately never made it to Broadway) and Daniel Tashian, of the Silver Seas. And with every new partner there was one constant, that “musical voice” that Leonard Bernstein talked about. It never left him. No matter who he wrote with, you could instantly recognize his melodies and his adventurous chord changes.\n\nEverybody knows the song “I’ll Never Fall In Love Again,” from his Broadway show, Promises, Promises, that was made into a hit record by – of course – Dionne Warwick, and reached the Top Ten in early-1970. Think of that melody in your mind, it’s just sublime. The shape, the intervalic leaps, the way it suggests the constantly-changing chords underneath; all the work of a musical savant.\n\nHe was the master of what I like to think of as the “intentional” melody; a melody that is constructed; as opposed to the more common “intuitive” melody, where the writer just sings along with the chords he’s playing and the melody takes form in a more organic way. Both can be great, but Bacharach kept alive that sense of an exquisitely-constructed melody that was a hallmark of the great American songwriters of the 20th century. Names like George Gershwin, Cole Porter, Richard Rogers, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern and numerous others who contributed to what has come to be known as the Great American Songbook.\n\nBut when Burt began his remarkable career run of over 70 Top Forty hits, the music industry had radically changed into a more teen-based market. The fact that he was able to ply his throwback sense of melody and harmony into such phenomenal success in the world of 1960s AM radio is, again, unparalleled. Think about the icons and the sounds of sixties music; the Beatles, the Stones, the Beach Boys, Motown, Dylan, Hendrix, etc. Amid all those titans of the era, there was Burt, with multiple hit singles in every year of the decade. Amazing!\n\nThe music of Burt Bacharach is indelibly stamped in my psyche. My love of chord changes that I got from his songs led me to other musical mavericks like Brian Wilson, Paul McCartney, Jimmy Webb, Harry Nilsson, Carole King, Randy Newman, Thom Bell, Joni Mitchell, David Crosby, Todd Rundgren, Stevie Wonder, Rupert Holmes, Paddy McAloon, Eric Carmen, Van Dyke Parks; the list goes on and on, but it starts with Bacharach!\n\nIn 2015, I released an album called File Under Pop Vocal, that was my attempt to honor the songwriters I just mentioned, with the more harmonically-adventurous songs of my own catalog. One song, “You’re Only Hurting Yourself,” was my own attempt at writing a Bacharach song.\n\nAnother “It’s Your Heart,” written with the great Syracuse musician, Mark Doyle (his music, my lyrics) travelled the same road.\n\nBut whether I can come anywhere near a Bacharach song with my own writing isn’t really the point. No one can. It is more the fact that his music is so deeply-embedded in me that those kinds of chord changes and melodies just rise to the surface at times. And it’s something I truly cherish as my own personal tribute to greatest songwriter of my lifetime, and that unique musical voice.\n\nPostscript: I’ve managed to pass on my love of Bacharach to my son Nick – also a musician – and in a rare 2018 duo gig at Sheraton University Inn in Syracuse, we attempted one of Burt’s most difficult songs, “God Give Me Strength,” from the movie Grace Of My Heart, written with, and sung in the film by, Elvis Costello. Not easy with acoustic guitar and bass (and a little flugelhorn), as the recording featured a full orchestra. But what it lacks in execution, it hopefully makes up for with true devotion.\n\nHere we go with my annual “top ten” list of what I’ve been listening to over the past year. While the amount of music I purchase and consume over the course of a year continues to decrease (as my age increases), I continue to find great albums that light me up; quality, not quantity! Here then are ten LPs, that logged the most playing time on my stereo, iPod, iPhone, car stereo, and computer. And like an issue of AARP, I list the age of the artists as a badge of honor for those who continue to create new music late into life, although there are several relative youngsters on this years list!\n\n1 Todd Rundgren – Space Force (age 74)\n\nMy 50+ year love affair with Todd continues with this, his 26th solo studio album. Toss in 3 Nazz records, 10 Utopia releases, and dozens of high-profile productions for other artists as varied as Cheap Trick, Meatloaf, XTC, The New York Dolls and Grand Funk Railroad, and you have a career unparalleled in rock history for its sheer volume of work. But unlike other artists of his vintage, Todd continues to push boundaries, dabbling with hip-hop and EDM over the past 25 years and continuing to work with new, younger artists on his last two albums. Like his last LP, White Knight (2017), Space Force is a duets album. But unlike many older artists who team up with other “oldies” for a new spin on songs from their own back catalogues, Todd does all new material, either of his own or co-written with the other artist. And the results here are top shelf. It all still sounds like a Todd album, but with some new and different flavors added to what is a highly-entertaining mix throughout. Highly recommended!\n\n2 Father John Misty – Chloë and the Next 20th Century (age 41)\n\nFather John (real name Josh Tillman), has been releasing music for 20 years now. First under his real name (8 albums from 2003 to 2010), then as drummer of Seattle indie darlings, the Fleet Foxes (2011 – 2012), and finally under this present pseudonym, with five albums from 2012 to now. This new album was presented to the world early last year with concerts featuring a full symphony orchestra. The album follows that same format, heavily-orchestrated throughout, and stands as one of the most unique pop albums in decades. Tillman’s songs remind me at times of 60’s legends Tim Hardin, Jimmy Webb or Harry Nilsson. And with the orchestral production (that would not be out of place on a 70’s Andy Williams record), it feels like an homage to Harry’s A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night (1973), but with original songs instead of old Great American Songbook standards that Nilsson honored. Quite a ballsy move in today’s musical environment, and one that stands out on the strength of Tillman’s unique songwriting.\n\n3 Tears For Fears – Tipping Point (ages, both 61)\n\nTears For Fears has never been the most prolific of bands, issuing only six albums in twenty one years, from 1983 to 2004, and two of those featured only Roland Orzabel, without his partner Curt Smith. But in 2022, they both came roaring back at full power with their first new album in 18 years, Tipping Point. There were also new videos, TV appearances, and a tour, unfortunately cut short by Curt Smith’s car accident that resulted in four broken ribs. But what a return to form this is! Tears For Fears have always made unconventional records that seemed out of step with the musical trends surrounding them. But I’ve always seen that as a strength. All the elements of their sound that I loved 40 years ago are still intact: Smart, creative writing, majestic production and ethereal vocals. I played this album more than any other this year and still go back to it. A musical magnet for me!\n\n4 Bret McKenzie – Songs Without Jokes (age 46)\n\nI have my son Nick to thank for this. During the pandemic he moved back from NYC, and like so many of us who were housebound at that time, we were looking for things to watch. He turned me on to Flight Of The Conchords, the quirky comedy out of New Zealand that originally ran in the US on HBO from 2007 to 2009 and featured Bret McKenzie and Jemaine Clement. It was truly one of the most unique comedies I’ve ever seen, and I loved it for that, but even more so for the original songs in every episode, as the premise was about a musical duo trying to make it big. Coincidentally, my older son Rob had relocated temporarily to New Zealand in 2020 to work with – wait for it – Bret McKenzie. Introduced by a mutual LA friend, Rob & Bret worked on writing a film and a streaming TV series, neither of which has been picked up yet; fingers crossed. So through Rob, I became even a bigger fan of Bret’s, and was psyched to learn he was working on a solo LP, which finally came out last year. Songs Without Jokes, is just that; no punchlines, but a near perfect album of smart, melodic music that recalls the seventies, and the golden age of singer/songwriters. There are little bits of Randy Newman, Harry Nilsson and Albert Hammond sprinkled throughout, but McKenzie is definitely his own thing. For any pop songwriting fans out there, this is required listening, and an immensely-likeable record!\n\n5 The Cowsills – Rhythm Of The World (ages 63 – 68)\n\nThere’s no reason the Cowsills should sound this good, over 50 years on from their inception as a family novelty band that became the inspiration for the 1970 ABC-TV show, The Partridge Family. Sure they had some great-sounding pop records, landing in the top ten three times from 1967 to 1969. But those were songs written by professional songwriters and records made with studio musicians. And yes, there are those charming live performances on Ed Sullivan, where they appoint themselves very well, playing their own instruments and singing in harmony like only siblings can (Everlys, Wilsons, Carpenters, anyone?). But that was then. They should have faded away 40+ year ago, right? Wrong! The Cowsills are lifers! They never stopped making music. For the joy of it, and for the comfort it gave them, after losing two siblings, Barry and Bill, in 2005. This album features the current performing group of Susan, Bob & Paul (John Cowsill has been the touring drummer for the Beach Boys since 2008). With 11 new original songs, ALL written by the Cowsills, Rhythm Of The World is a statement record, from a band that has no business still being around, and being this good. This is a great pop album from beginning to end with one pop gem after another. Warning, these songs are extremely catchy, Listen at your own risk!\n\n6 Elvis Costello – A Boy Named If (age 68)\n\nCostello re-entered the recording world in 2018, after an eight year lay-off, with Look Now, which topped my list that year at #1, and then Hey Clockface, two years later, which came in for me at #7. I’ve always loved Elvis from the first time I saw him live on a snowy, February night in 1978 at Four Acres in Utica, NY. One of the most intense shows I’ve ever seen anyone do! He’s equally at home in numerous genres, dabbling in rock, pop, jazz, country, classical and R & B throughout his long, unprecedented career. And while his previous two releases were a showcase for the many musical selves he can inhabit, this one is a rock & roll record, through and through. With longtime collaborator Steve Nieve (piano & organ) pushed to the front on many tracks, this record, for me, really evokes his classic early period with The Attractions on This Year’s Model and Armed Forces. Numerous highlights here, but I keep going back to Magnificent Hurt, Penelope Halfpenny, and the LP’s lone ballad, Paint The Red Rose Blue, which is one of those heartbreaking songs, only Elvis can write.\n\n7 Julian Lennon – Jude (age 59)\n\nAfter bursting onto the scene in 1984 (at age 21) as the heir apparent to his legendary Beatle Dad, Julian released four albums in a seven-year span from 1984 to 1991. And while there were many highlights on his records, he seemed to run out of gas and lose interest in trying to be the next big thing. And that’s when things got interesting. After a seven year hiatus, he released Photograph Smile, in 1998, easily his best album up to that point. But then he took another 11 years off before Everything Changes came out in 2011. And now another 11 years leading up to this one. Clearly, he didn’t inherit his father’s work ethic. But Julian pursues other interests, including photography, filmmaking, writing (he has authored 5 books), and has been very active with his charity work, the White Feather Foundation. With the release of Jude, he is taking ownership of his place in the famous Beatle’s song Hey Jude, which Paul McCartney wrote for the then 4-year-old Julian as a comfort during the breakup of his parents’ marriage. On Jude we hear Lennon as a fully-mature artist in his own right. The music is mostly piano-driven ballads, with a few mid-tempo songs in the mix. There are numerous highights, but for me, the real star is Julian’s voice. He retains some of his father’s edge, but has an enduring sweetness to his voice that never wears on me. This is a beautiful record from beginning to end. I hope we don’t have to wait another 11 years for the next one!\n\n8 David Crosby & The Lighthouse Band – Live At The Capitol Theater (age 81)\n\nI received this record in the mail the day before I learned of Crosby’s death on January 18 of this year. Talk about irony! I’ve always been a huge fan of his music (https://garyfrenay.wordpress.com/2015/07/10/pure-croz/), and have delighted in his late-life renaissance, releasing five albums of new original material over the past ten years, something that just isn’t done by artists of his vintage. This live LP is a document of his collaboration with Michael League, of Snarky Puppy, along with singer/songwriters Becca Stevens and Michelle Willis. I’ve been amazed by David’s voice in his later years. While most older artists (McCartney, Dylan, Brian Wilson, etc) sound older, maybe more raspy in places, Crosby’s voice still sounds like he’s 35 and at the top of his game. Truly remarkable! And this live LP shows off his vocals, with those of his band, front and center. I’ve seen Crosby numerous times throughout the years – six, I think – but not this band. So happy, then, to have this document of such a beautiful night of music. Long live Croz!\n\n9 Brian Wilson – At My Piano (age 80)\n\nAnyone who knows me, knows what a Brian Wilson fan I am. I devour every new release, and have seen him and his amazingly-talented band live over a dozen times now. And still, he can surprise me. While Wilson is generally acknowledged as the greatest arranger of vocals in the rock era, this is a purely instrumental record. No vocals. None! But picture a beautiful California night, at sunset, and you are sitting in Wilson’s music room, overlooking the Pacific Ocean, with him seated at his splendid grand piano. And over the next hour, he proceeds to play through 15 songs from his vast catalog of hits. This is such an intimate record. His touch is very light. He doesn’t “tread” on his melodies, he drifts lightly over them. And while his voicings on the piano replicate the human voice parts from the records, you really hear the songs in a new, and remarkable way. At 80, we may never hear any more new music from Brian Wilson, but if this is his last release, what a lovely way to go out!\n\n10 Trijntje Oosterhuis – Everchanging Times: Burt Bacharach Songbook III (age 50)\n\nBeing 50% Dutch myself, I’ve always enjoyed discovering artists from the Netherlands that are largely unknown in America. One of those is Bertolf Lintink, who I wrote about in 2015 (https://garyfrenay.wordpress.com/2015/12/23/bertolf-dutch-treat/), and who had my album of the year last year with Happy In Hindsight. Another is Trijntje Oosterhuis, who, for my money, has become the finest and foremost interpreter of Burt Bacharach in the 21st century. She released her first two Burt “songbook” records in 2006, and 2007, with Bacharach joining in on piano on several songs. Now 15 years later, she has released a third, just as fine as the first two. What is so striking about her Burt songbooks, is the sheer range of her choices. These are not just the same hits that everyone gravitates towards (Look of Love, Walk On By, Raindrops Keep Falling, etc) Trijntje digs deep, and covers the entire range of Bacharach’s long, storied career; with songs from every decade from the 60’s to now. It’s a full orchestra production, but her voice is always front and center, as it should be for a singer this good. And ironically, again, this entry is being written on the day I heard about Bacharach’s death. Just too sad for words, but what a fitting tribute, then, this record is.\n\nAfter several years of an international pandemic and on the heels of the Peter Jackson epic “Let It Be” reconstruction project, “Get Back,” Paul McCartney got back on the road in 2022.\n\nWhile not as ambitious as previous globe-trotting tours, this one covered 13 US cities over a six-week period from April 28 in Spokane, WA to June 16 in East Rutherford, NJ. Two days after that last date, he would celebrate his 80th birthday. Let’s stop and think about that. Eighty years old and still at it, at a higher level than most performers can even dream of ever acheiving.\n\nOver twenty years ago, Keith Richards, a founding member of the Rolling Stones, was asked how long that band could keep going. In response, Richards cited the longevity of pioneering black jazz artists Count Basie and Duke Ellington, saying, “We’re here to grow up rock & roll!” And, for those of us of “a certain age,” we are growing up right along with them.\n\nMaybe that’s why it’s so heartening to see Paul McCartney, live in concert, all these years on. He doesn’t have to do it – he clearly doesn’t need the money, regularly landing near or at the top of most lists of entertainers’ financial worth. He has been quoted in the past as saying he still does it because this is what he does. For him, it is not so much about financial worth, as it is self worth, or self identity. That and some friendly competitive fire. When asked recently if he would retire soon, he quipped, “Well, Mick & Keith are still doing it, so I guess I will, too!”\n\nMcCartney’s only previous appearance in Syracuse was in September of 2017, an occasion one thought might be his last time around, and one I wrote at length about here: https://garyfrenay.wordpress.com/2017/09/\n\nSince that date, he released two new studio albums, Egypt Station (2018) and McCartney III (2020), both of which did very well on the charts, but revealed his voice as an instrument in decline. To be fair, that’s to be expected for an artist of his age. But with that knowledge, I honestly questioned whether I really wanted to pony up the money again, and deal with the crowds, the parking, the long walk to the Dome, and the high sound levels that modern concerts of this scope regularly generate (I suffer from ongoing tinnitus and it’s always an issue in loud environments). But, in the end, the simple fact that a Beatle was going to be performing 10 minutes from my house – again – not going was just something I knew I would regret.\n\nSo, I splurged for really good tickets, at $250+ each, and convinced myself that even if Paul’s voice was no longer what it had been, the material and the grand show he and his band (and staging team) puts on would carry the day. Boy, was I right!\n\nIn 2017, I was impressed that McCartney stepped on stage on the dot at 8 p.m., the scheduled start time. I mean really, who does that?! Well this time, at 8:00, the lights went down and it seemed the show was starting. But in fact, what was starting was a nearly 30-minute film and music presentation of Macca’s life from boyhood to present. It was very creatively done, but I could have easily done without it. So when he DID finally step on stage, we were all way more than ready. Of course, he opened with a Beatles’ tune, Can’t Buy Me Love, and we were off and running!\n\nOver the next 2 hours and 45 minutes (including encore), McCartney would perform 35 songs: 21 by the Beatles, 7 by Wings, and 7 from his solo career. Surprisingly, he featured 5 songs from this century, even though, as he acknowledged from the stage, “You might not want to hear them, but we’re gonna play them!” Good for you, Paul!\n\nThere were many highlights, but my own favorite part of the show was the nearly 10 minutes he devoted to his earliest song called In Spite Of All The Danger. Recorded in 1958 with his first band, The Quarrymen, it included John Lennon and a very young George Harrison. He shared the humorous story of its origin, a recording that produced just one copy of a demo disc, and the battle among the five band members for who would get to keep the record. He then performed the song, turning it into a beautiful sing-along, with the 35,000 people in attendance more than happy join in.\n\nOne of the major changes to this show from the one in 2017, was the addition of the Hot City Horns, featuring Kenji Fenton (sax), Mike Davis (trumpet) and Paul Burton (trombone). Along with the value added of real horns (instead of synth horns), their collective choreography was inspired and endlessly energetic. A great addition!\n\nThe core band was the same and stands now as McCartney’s longest-lasting band – by far – of his decades-long career. They first appeared with him on record on the 2001 release, DRIVING RAIN, and joined him a year later on his first world tour then, since 1993, “Driving World.” Rusty Anderson and Brian Ray handle every guitar and occasional bass part as if they wrote them, and Wix Wickens still covers more ground on keyboards than seems possible. But it is drummer/vocalist Abe Laboriel Jr, who really steals the show. As a drummer, he anchors the band and drives the bus, as it were. And as a vocalist, his harmonies are often the star of the show, not to mention that he regularly doubles his bandleader’s lead vocals to perfection!\n\nThe show is very similar to the one he did in 2017, but with addition of several songs that allow the Hot City Horns to really shine, including Got To Get You Into My Life, Letting Go and Let ‘Em In. And I was happy to hear him again include his tributes to his fallen Beatle bandmates with Here Today (for John) and Something (for George).\n\nAnother of his songs that will always be included was Live And Let Die, his theme song for the 1973 James Bond film of the same name. The song has been a highlight of his concerts for over three decades now and never fails to amaze. Featuring loud explosions and shots of fire that rise from the floor to the ceiling, it’s like nothing I’ve ever experienced. Even sitting a third of the way back from the stage in the massive JMA Wireless Dome, I could still feel intense heat from the blasts. A friend who sat up front swore her eyebrows were singed during the fireworks display. Yikes! And if that weren’t enough, the song ends with the loudest explosion of all, with McCartney at his piano holding his hands over his ear and shaking his head, as if in disbelief. I wonder how his tinnitus is holding up?!\n\nThe home stretch was the same as last time, but with Get Back – of course – replacing Back In The USSR. Hey Jude had everyone on their feet, singing along and hoping it would never end. But of course, all good things must end, even this wonderful, unforgettable show by one of the greatest musicians the world has ever seen.\n\nThankfully, after 2 1/2 hours, they didn’t make us wait long for the guaranteed encore, jogging back onto the stage with each of the five band members carrying and waving huge flags; USA, UK, Ukraine, LGBTQ and NYS; a great, visual touch!\n\nThe first encore song was an emotional highlight. Director Peter Jackson, who had produced the 7+ hour-long “Get Back” film, told Paul that he could prepare footage of a song from the famous rooftop concert in the film, that would feature just John Lennon’s voice, allowing Paul to sing a “live” duet with his old bandmate. Wow! A trick, to be sure, but what a beautiful moment to see John & Paul once again sharing the stage, singing I’ve Got A Feeling, together. At the end, Paul looked back at the screen and said, “So nice to be able to sing with my old mate again.”\n\nThe encore finished with songs from the WHITE ALBUM and ABBEY ROAD, and the beautiful final message, “And in the end, the love you take, is equal to the love you make.” I’ve heard both Paul, and Ringo Starr in interviews say that the part of the Beatles’ legacy that they were most proud of was the messages of peace and love. What a beautiful contribution to the world.\n\nPaul McCartney is 80 years old. He is not the singer he was in his youth, or even 20 years ago, but he is a gifted entertainer and the most successful songwriter the world has ever produced (look it up!). But his real strength, to me, is his authenticity. As a fan of rock history, I would often see mentions of artists who invented a persona, or re-invented themselves to become huge stars; David Bowie, Prince and Elvis Presley all come to mind.\n\nBut McCartney, throughout his seemingly-endless career, has been the same person he was when he first appeared on our TV screens – thanks to Ed Sullivan – on that cold winter night in 1964; bobbing his head, smiling, and performing flawlessly. The hairstyles may have changed with the times (Wings-era mullet, anyone?), but he still comes across as that same genuine guy who loves being on stage, while seeming to recognize that he’s lucky to still be there, in so many ways. So many of his bandmates and peers are gone, yet he marches on.\n\nAs I left the show, ears still ringing, I was struck with the thought that McCartney is one of only three acts in the world of his vintage who can still stage a show of such epic scope and production, and fill arenas of that size (the other two being The Rolling Stones, and The Who). Pretty exclusive company, but I suspect even as competitive as they all are, the other two acts would still bow to Sir Paul, as do we all!\n\nPaul McCartney setlist – JMA Wireless Dome, Syracuse, NY June 4, 2022\n\nCan’t Buy Me Love (Beatles – A HARD DAYS NIGHT)\n\nJunior’s Farm (Wings – single)\n\nLetting Go (Wings – VENUS & MARS)\n\nGot to Get You Into My Life (Beatles – REVOLVER)\n\nCome On to Me (EGYPT STATION)\n\nLet Me Roll It w/Foxy Lady jam (Wings – BAND ON THE RUN)\n\nGetting Better (BEATLES – SGT.

While the amount of music I purchase and consume over the course of a year continues to decrease (as my age increases), I continue to find great albums that rock my world; quality, not quantity! Here then are ten LPs (yeah, I still call ‘em that!), that logged numerous plays on my stereo, iPod, iPhone, car stereo, and computer. And like an issue of AARP, I list the age of the artists as a badge of honor for those who continue to create, late into life, although there are a several youngsters on this years list!\n\n1 Bertolf – Happy In Hindsight (age 41)\n\nI discovered Bertolf Lintink in 2009, with the release of his first LP, For Life. Being 50% Dutch myself, I treasured finding a pop artist from the Netherlands whose music spoke to me so directly. Over the years, he has dabbled in tribute events; staging a Beatles rooftop concert, and taking part in Deja Vu, a Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young live and recorded tribute that has to be heard to be believed! But it his his own original music that keeps me coming back. This new album, reminds me of McCartney’s Ram in its’ variety, breadth of style and the sheer catchiness of the material. His gift of melody is on display throughout, as is his instrumental prowess. I have a different fave every time I listen. Easily my favorite record of the year. Highly recommended!!\n\n2 Del Amitri – Fatal Mistakes (ages 55-60)\n\nI’ve always loved this band from the first time I heard “Roll To Me” in 1995. But after their 6th album, Can You Do Me Good in 2002, they disappeared. Bassist and lead singer, Justin Currie, reased 4 well-received solo albums in the interim, but I was happy to see them back as a working unit with this new LP, seemingly picking up where they left off 20 years earlier. This is music that does NOT have to grow on you. The impact of Currie’s songs hits you in the chest on the first listen, and stays in your heart. This is smart, literate, memorable music that few still make at this level. So glad to have this band back!\n\n3 Kacey Musgraves – Star-Crossed (age 33)\n\nI’ll be honest, I first heard this artist when she collaborated with Brian Wilson on a song on his 2015 album, Pier Pressure. I found her again this year, when I heard this new record was produced by my fave Nashville songwriter/producer Daniel Tashian (Silver Seas, Burt Bacharach), who also produced my #1 album of 2020, A Girl Called Eddy’s Been Around. But whereas that album was big, broad and majestic, this one is close, quiet and intimate, just what these 15 songs call for. Musgraves is a unique talent. Her songs are personal, yet universal in their reach. She is, in some ways, an old-school singer/songwriter, in the style of Joni Mitchell and Carly Simon, who mine their own live stories into songs; bare, honest and beautiful!\n\n4 John Mayer – Sob Rock (age 44)\n\nI know a lot of people dismiss Mayer, either because of his very public liaisons with Taylor Swift, Katy Perry, Jessica Simpson, etc, or his alignment with what’s left of The Grateful Dead (Dead & Company) over the past 7 years, and I get that. But when you set all that aside, and just listen to his albums, the man is gifted in so many ways. I’ve been a fan from the first release in 2001, and have follwed his career thoughout. But it’s his last two records that have really put him on a higher pedastal for me; The Search For Everything (2017), and this new one. Most of"
