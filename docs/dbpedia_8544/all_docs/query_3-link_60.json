It's the Badfinger moniker\n\nthat people come to see, apparently.\n\nAs far as Gilmour using Pink Floyd - he's got the everyone BUT one member in\n\nthat band. It's not like he's using a bunch of pick-up or session musicians to\n\nfill in.\n\nAnd the Beach Boys Family & Friends tour makes clear in its title it's not the\n\n\"Beach Boys\". Joey does nothing to distinguish this isn't Badfinger, so a young\n\nfan not knowing any better, may be going thinking they're seeing the whole\n\nband. They may just have found Badfinger thru CDs, not even realize 2 members\n\nare dead, and think they're seeing the originals when it's only Joey and some\n\nothers. It's close to false advertising, IMO.\n\n>And as far as this \"Joe and Mike didn't co-write any hits\" stuff that's being\n\n>tossed around, the people who say this have obviously never been in a band.\n\n>Unless you are working with a Pete Townshend who does demos (of all parts)\n\n>and\n\n>plays them for the Who, or else you are working with a Zappa who writes all\n\n>your parts out - most bands DO \"co-write\" songs in that they all write the\n\n>ARRANGEMENT together.

To be\n\nfair, they decided that, after a portion of the royalties went to the\n\nsongwriter(s), the remaining portion would be divided equally amongst the five\n\nagreed-upon people (Pete, Tom, Joey, Mike and Bill Collins).\n\nThe songwriting CREDIT was NEVER supposed to be shared. That was the alleged\n\ndisturbance that Tom Evans' wife was so upset about at an ASCAP presentation\n\nfor \"Without You,\" and Pete Ham's daughter was so upset about it, she refused\n\nto attend the event.\n\nIMO, if there was any integrity and respect, Joey, Mike and Bill would have\n\nrefused to take the stage, since the award was for the songwriting, and they\n\ndidn't really have anything to do with it.\n\nAgain, according to the book (I'm fully admitting I'm using that as my source),\n\nKathie Molland made claims about what Joey added to the song (a single word\n\nchange, for example), but it was found in the original demos made by Pete and\n\nTom, that Joey *hadn't* come up with those, as they were already included in\n\nthe solo demos.\n\nAs far as collaborative writing, of course, in a band, everyone usually has\n\nsome ideas to throw in. Mal Evans is supposed to have helped (in a bigger way\n\nthan Joey allegedly did with \"Without You\") write some songs on the Sgt. Pepper\n\nalbum. He never received songwriting credit.\n\nJohn often helped George with songs - George NEVER had a co-writing credit with\n\nhis songs in the Beatles years.\n\n<<Why does\n\nno one lambast Al Jardine for touring as Beach Boys Family and Friends? Like\n\nJoe, he didn't sing any hits either. >>\n\nNot that it matters to the overall argument, but this is untrue. Al sang \"Help\n\nMe Rhonda\" and \"Sloop John B.\" As a subsequent poster pointed out, however, Al\n\nJardine does not tour as \"The Beach Boys.\"\n\n<<The only difference here is that Badfinger agreeded\n\nup-front, before ANYONE wrote a hit, that they would acknowledge this important\n\naspect of songwriting by sharing \"writing\" credits equally. >>\n\nAgain, someone beat me to it, but this is patently untrue. I'm going by memory\n\nhere, but there may have been ONE mid-period album (\"Ass\"? \"Badfinger\" on\n\nWarner Bros.?) that had a group writing credit for the songs, but it's\n\ncertainly not true of any other Badfinger album except this one.\n\nI don't begrudge Joey the right to make a living, but I also agree that it's\n\nabsurd not to indicate to unknowing ticket buyers that what you're getting when\n\nyou go see Badfinger today is 1/4 of the original band -- a fourth that sang\n\nNONE of the groups hits.\n\nI also cringe at the thought of how the legacy of a great band is handled.\n\nHell, well over ten years ago, Joey was performing \"No Matter What\" (again a\n\nsong he didn't write or sing lead on) in the key of G, for Christ's sake!\n\nBlasphemy!\n\nIn article <19990623070408...@ng-fr1.aol.com>,\n\nmrpit...@aol.com (MrPither12) wrote:\n\n> <<From: woof...@hotmail.com (Booheis Brecht)\n\n> Date: Wed, 23 June 1999 01:15 AM EDT\n\n> Message-id: <wooftweet-230...@coretel-120.charm.net\n\n> I saw a scary letter written by his wife that was posted on a Badfinger\n\n> website, ranting and raving.

They\n\nare two totally different things. Period. A great song with a mediocre\n\narrangement is still a great song.\n\nD 28IF <d2...@aol.com> wrote in message\n\n> I'd also like to know how you know they DID have an agreement to share all\n\n> songwriting. I've never read this anywhere. And if the source is only\n\nJoey,\n\n> then let's face it, that, too is slanted. :-)\n\nMy understanding of the dispute is this:\n\nA. In 1972, the members of the band agreed to split all songwriting\n\nroyalties this way: the writer(s) of the song would get 50% of the\n\nroyalties, and the remaining 50% would be split equally between all band\n\nmembers and Bill Collins.\n\nB. The Ham/Evans estates claim that this agreement was only intended to\n\nlast for the duration of the time the band remained together. The minutes\n\nof the 72 meeting state this. Molland contends that the agreement was a\n\npermanent one, intended to exist in perpetuity.\n\nC. When Badfinger's royalties were finally released in the mid-80s, they\n\nwere broken down as 25% to the writer, 75% split among the rest of the band\n\nand Collins. There was no precedent for doing this. Even if you agree with\n\nMolland that the royalty split was intended to be a permanent agreement, the\n\nchange in percentages was unprecedented and done only because Molland,\n\nGibbins, and Collins were there to argue for their own interest while Ham\n\nand Evans obviously were not.\n\nObviously, Molland prefers to keep the royalties split this way, rather than\n\njust receiving royalties for the songs he wrote, because \"Without You\"\n\ngenerates more royalty income than the entire rest of the Badfinger catalog\n\ncombined.\n\nRegardless of what agreement they had, in my opinion it is very unfair for\n\nMolland, Gibbins, and Collins to make thousands of dollars in royalties (if\n\nnot millions) for a song they did not in any way contribute to the writing\n\nof.\n\n>\n\n> And the Beach Boys Family & Friends tour makes clear in its title it's not the\n\n> \"Beach Boys\".

Joe's account of the writing of the\n\nsong has been documented a dozen times over and he has NEVER remotely hinted at\n\nhaving any input in the writing of the song. The point he stressed most was Bill\n\nCollin's input. Collin's obviously thought it was a very strong song and told the\n\nband they really needed to do a big arrangement on it.\n\n>\n\n<<Subject: Re: Joey Molland\n\nFrom: \"Jason Czeskleba\"\n\n...Regardless of what agreement they had, in my opinion it is very unfair for\n\nMolland, Gibbins, and Collins to make thousands of dollars in royalties (if\n\nnot millions) for a song they did not in any way contribute to the writing\n\nof.>>\n\nAnd in my opinion I think it is unfair that any \"songwriter\" (from McCartney to\n\nCostello) take most - if not all- of the credit and cash when it is usually a\n\nband collaboration. But opinions aside, I know from Joey and Tommy that the\n\nband had an agreement about splitting the money and credits 4 ways from the\n\nstart because they TOLD me this in person (1976 or 77). What most are\n\nforgetting here is that Badfinger was a true \"hippie\" band who lived together\n\nand ate together and suffered together. It's hard in today's I-Me-Mine world to\n\nremember the hippie ethic, but Badfinger personified it. At the time NO one in\n\nthe band had written any hits, all wrote songs, and none knew who might end up\n\npenning a hit - thus the agreement. But, as hippies were want to do, they just\n\nagreeded, they didn't sign anything thus todays controversy. It's never been a\n\nquestion of who actually wrote anything, it a question of living up to a hippie\n\nagreement in a 90s corporate culture.\n\nIn article <19990625072315...@ng-fz1.aol.com>,\n\nmrpit...@aol.com (MrPither12) wrote:\n\n> <<Subject: Re: Joey Molland\n\n> From: woof...@hotmail.com (Booheis Brecht)\n\n> Unless it was written on paper and signed by the parties no one can claim\n\n> to \"know\" the truth about this as you have.\n\n> >>\n\n>\n\n> I only claim to \"know\" what Joe and Tom told me 23 years ago.
