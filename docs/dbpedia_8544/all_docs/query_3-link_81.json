As the last surviving member of the power pop pioneer band, it was truly a memorable occasion. It was nice to watch Joey soak up the love from Badfinger fans, and he’s so open and personable.\n\nHe has launched a new Badfinger website and it’s not quite finished yet, but it’s a great start. For those unfamiliar with the band, Badfinger is often credited with being a) The very first power pop band and b) a textbook example of how the music “business” can destroy a great band. The word “tragic” is an adjective often associated with the band. The best intro to neophytes I can point to this documentary."
