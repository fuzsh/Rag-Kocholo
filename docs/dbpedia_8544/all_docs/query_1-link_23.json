        "text": "They weren't British, they weren't brothers, and their real names weren't Walker, but Californians Scott Engel, John Maus, and Gary Leeds were briefly huge stars in England (and small ones in their native land) at the peak of the British Invasion. Engel and Maus were playing together in Hollywood when drummer Leeds suggested they form a trio and try to make it in England. And they did — with surprising swiftness, they hit the top of the British charts with \"Make It Easy on Yourself\" in 1965. \"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore\" repeated the feat the following year, and the group also had U.K. hits with \"My Ship Is Coming In,\" \"(Baby) You Don't Have to Tell Me,\" \"Another Tear Falls,\" and others. For a few months they experienced frenzied adulation almost on the level of the Beatles and the Stones, though in the U.S. (where they rarely performed) only \"Make It Easy on Yourself\" and \"The Sun Ain't Gonna Shine Anymore\" entered the Top 20.\n\nWhile the Walkers looked the part of British Invaders with their shaggy mop-top hairstyles, they were far more pop than rock. Nor did they play on most of their records. With producer Johnny Franz and veteran British arrangers like Ivor Raymonde (who also worked with Dusty Springfield) and Reg Guest, they favored orchestrated ballads that were a studied attempt to emulate the success of another brother act who weren't really brothers: the Righteous Brothers. Not as soulful as the Righteous Brothers, lead singer Scott Walker's deep croon betrayed strong debts to non-rock vocalists like Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra. While their biggest hits were covers of songs by American pop songwriting teams like Bacharach-David and Mann-Weil, Scott (and occasionally John Walker) could write brooding originals in a more personal, less overblown style when given the chance.\n\nIn the intensely competitive days of 1967, the Walkers' brand of pop suddenly become passé, and the group disbanded in the face of diminishing success and Scott's increasingly fruitful solo career. Scott ran off a series of Top Ten British solo albums in the late '60s, which have attracted a sizable cult with their idiosyncratic marriage of Scott's brooding, insular songs and ornate orchestral arrangements. Gary Walker released a few singles and an album with his group the Rain in a much harder-rocking guitar-oriented format. The Walkers reunited for a while in the mid-'70s, which produced a final British hit (\"No Regrets\"). Much of the Walkers' story is retold in the biography Scott Walker: A Deep Shade of Blue, published only in Britain.\n\nby Richie Unterberger\n\nwww.allmusic.com\n\nScott was rescued from a gas filled room in London... after the Walker Bros had split when he was solo. I think he had a bit of a booze problem at the time.\n\nThe picture below is from happier times. From the back of the first Routers LP..Scott is second from the right, playing bass.\n\nGreat LP by the way..UK copy, cool mono. Does Scott REALLY play on it..?\n\nAttached Files:\n\nUntitled 4 .jpeg\n\nFile size:\n\n39 KB\n\nViews:\n\n10\n\nThey just happen to be responsible for some of the greatest recordings in the history of mankind!\n\nTo be fair, their producer Johnny Franz also had a lot to do with it!\n\nAs for the comparisons with Spector productions, in reality it is a little more complicated than the commonly held view that the Righteous Brothers - \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\" was used as a template for their sound. Their first couple of recordings (at RCA studios in LA) were made under the auspices of Mercury Records boss Nik Venet - the significant one being the recording of \"Love Her\". This was originally written for the Righteous Brothers (although they never recorded it - instead it was recorded by the Everly Brothers) by Cynthia Weil and Barry Mann and the 1965 Walker Brothers recording was arranged/conducted by Jack Nitzsche. Since \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\" was also written for the Righteous Brothers by Mann/Weil and arranged by Nitzsche (and Eugene Page) it is no surprise there should be strong similarities!\n\nWhen the Walker Brothers then came to England and Johnny Franz had the job of recording them for Phillips he used \"Love Her\" as the template - hence the strong connection to \"You've Lost That Loving Feeling\" and the Righteous Brothers.\n\nScott Walker (real name Noel Scott Engel) was heavily involved in making the Phillips recordings sound as they do. His time working as a gofer at Gold Star records during Spector's prime gave him insider knowledge on how the \"Wall Of Sound\" was created. This coupled with Franz's production genius and his engineer Peter Olliff's technical wizardry made for an unbeatable combination and the great '65-'67 Walker Brothers recordings were the result. Of course, the contribution of the great arrangers at Franz's disposal should not be underestimated - most notably Ivor Raymonde (until his defection to Decca) , Reg Guest, Peter Knight and Wally Stott. Of course, without Scott's amazing voice none of this would mean anything - this is the last piece of the puzzle that, in combination with all the other elements, made for some of the best recordings of all time.\n\nScott managed to continue evolving this magic formula with his amazing solo recordings up until the turn of the decade. For me, by the early 70s the magic had gone - still, 5 years is a great run!"
