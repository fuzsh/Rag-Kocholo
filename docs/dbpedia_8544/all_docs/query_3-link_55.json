        "text": "The Turtles\n\nBest known for their harmony-heavy California pop sound. With hits such as Elenore, She’d Rather Be With Me, It Ain’t Me Babe, You Showed Me and the title of the tour, Happy Together, the band ruled the airwaves in the late ‘60s. Ron Dante joins the group to delight with his own mega-hit, Sugar Sugar.\n\nJay & The Americans\n\nWe are proud to present Jay and the Americans! Few groups have ever reached the musical heights with hits from 1962-1971. This group charted an amazing 5 Billboard Top 10 hits and 12 Top-20 hit records. Their breakout hit was She Cried. Their next chart hit was Only In America, which they followed with hit songs Come A Little Bit Closer, Cara Mia and This Magic Moment, which hit the Billboard Top 10.\n\nThe Association\n\nOne of the most successful bands to come out of the 60’s, The Association has sold millions of records. Their album, The Association’s Greatest Hits (Warner Brothers) is now double platinum and continues to be one of the longest best-selling albums in the history of the company. A few of their hits include Cherish, Windy, Never My Love, and Along Comes Mary.\n\nJoey Molland\n\nFrom their legendary lineup, Joey Molland continues the unforgettable legacy of Badfinger. One of the original signings to the Beatles’ Apple Records label. They had their first hit single with a Paul McCartney penned song, Come and Get It, which went to #7 in the U.S. charts. Badfinger followed this with their own compositions No Matter What, Day After Day (produced by George Harrison), and Baby Blue, which went to #8, #4 and #14 respectively.\n\nThe Vogues\n\nAlso known for their harmony-driven pop sound, The Vogues had numerous Top 10 hits with singles such as Five O’Clock World, My Special Angel, and Turn Around Look At Me.\n\nThe Cowsills\n\nThe harmonious family act of brothers and sister Bob, Paul, & Susan Cowsill, who inspired the smash hit ‘70s television show, “The Partridge Family”. They are sure to delight with their best-known songs, Hair, Indian Lake, The Rain, The Park, & Other Things and more."
