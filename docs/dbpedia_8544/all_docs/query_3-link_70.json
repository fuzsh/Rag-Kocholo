        "text": "I didn't see a dedicated thread for Joey's upcoming album on Omnivore Records.\n\nJoey Molland’s first album of new material in nearly 10 years.\n\nThe story of Badfinger is arguably rock’s saddest and most tragic tale. But one thing is for certain, the group that practically invented “power pop” was abundantly filled with great talent. Three great songwriters in one band was reminiscent of the group’s original label founders, The Beatles. Perhaps the most unheralded of the three in Badfinger was Liverpudlian guitarist Joey Molland. His songwriting talent started to blossom with the group’s finest album, 1971’s Straight Up. Molland contributed five songs to the group’s fourth platter including “I’d Die Babe,” “Sweet Tuesday Morning,” and “Suitcase.” Joey continued to play and write as Badfinger motored through the ’70s recording and touring. Great albums like 1974’s Wish You Were Here were met with record company and personal mismanagement and in 1975, the group’s leader, Pete Ham, tragically passed away. Molland eventually left the group, returned, and left again to start his own solo career.\n\nJoey has played in various groups and under the name “Joey Molland’s Badfinger” since 1983. He has made several solo albums to critical acclaim but nothing could have prepared us for his latest album. Omnivore Recordings is proud to announce the release of Be True To Yourself, a tour de force pop album by Joey Molland, co-written with producer Mark Hudson (producer of Losst And Found by Harry Nilsson, also available on Omnivore Recordings). The album is filled with delicious pop hooks and features musical contributions from Joey’s friends (Julian Lennon, Micky Dolenz, Jason Scheff and Steve Holley). The album is filled with delicious pop hooks and features musical contributions from Joey’s friends (Julian Lennon, Micky Dolenz, Jason Scheff and Steve Holley). With front and back cover photography by Julian Lennon, this album is a veritable feast for the eyes and ears! So, sit back and “take it all” in from one of the genre’s progenitors… Be True to Yourself by Joey Molland.\n\nCD / DIGITAL TRACK LIST:\n\nTHIS TIME\n\nBETTER TOMORROW\n\nRAINY DAY MAN\n\nHEAVEN\n\nALL I WANT TO DO\n\nI DON’T WANNA BE DONE WITH YOU\n\nALL I DO IS CRY\n\nLOVING YOU\n\nSHINE\n\nBE TRUE TO YOURSELF\n\nCat: OV-402\n\nTags: Badfinger, Joey Molland\n\nI must admit that Joey's presence in the early going of Badfinger irritated me. Perhaps it's the fact EVERY video of them lipsynching or playing live has him mugging for the camera. I never enjoyed Suitcase and anything from the earlier albums of his. BUT, I did see a change in his writing and music making as the group went into the studio and made Wish You Were Here. Gotta Get Out Of Here, Some Other Time, and Should I Smoke are just about the best I could have imagined. This is where I felt Joey's contributions came to equal Pete's on the album. Ass was just too much Joey and it was as if Pete had taken Joey's abuse to heart and wanted to let it be a Joey album. Maybe that's why it's the weakest of all their albums whereas WYWH is perhaps their best album ever.\n\nIs he a better writer after all these years? Perhaps, his voice still irritates me at times.\n\nGlad to hear that!! Thanks for posting. I missed Joey's last one, but am looking forward to Be True To Yourself. I met Joey after a \"Joey Molland's Badfinger\" show several years ago (great show) and then spent some time with he (and Kathie) at a few Fab Four Fests when they were being held in Nashville. He is a warm and open gentleman who had nothing but kind things to say about his former bandmates. He certainly credits them during shows.\n\nMark Hudson was also at the Fab Four Fest along with Lawrence and Hope Juber, Marshall Crenshaw, May Pang, Nancy Andrews, Louise Harrison and a number of people in the Beatles orbit over the years. Also, of course, many Nashville musicians, who would perform a different Beatles album each year."
