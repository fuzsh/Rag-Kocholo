The song is written by Graham Nash, Allan Clarke, Nicky James and Kirk Duncan. Allan can be heard singing in the chorus. It's rumoured - though not confirmed - that the Hollies provide the backing track.\n\nAllan produces The Societie's 1967 single \"Bird Has Flown\" and can be heard singing on the track.\n\nGraham Nash was invited to the Beatles' live broadcast/recording session for \"All You Need Is Love\" and it's him who whistles on the final outro just before John Lennon starts singing 'She Loves You, yeah yeah yeah'.\n\nGraham wrote \"Postcard\" for the Jimi Hendrix Experience but it was turned down so he recorded it with the Hollies instead. He shared a flat with Noel Redding in London in 1967/8.\n\nThe Small Faces wrote \"Lazy Sunday\" in response to an argument they had with the Hollies, where the Hollies accused them of not singing in their natural accents. Steve Marriott intended it as a private joke and the song was released as a single in 1968 against their wishes and without their consent!\n\nGraham Nash was present for the recording session for \"I See The Rain\" by the Marmalade in 1967. Jimi Hendrix later stated it as his favourite record of 1967. It's unclear what Graham contributed to the track, if anything.\n\nThe Hollies duetted \"Louisiana Man\" on the Bobby Gentry Show in 1968 with Bobby Gentry. It subconsciously pushed them into a more country and western direction which was against what Graham Nash wanted to do.\n\nGraham Nash added his vocals to the McGough/McGear LP in 1968, most notably on the track \"Ex Art Student\".\n\nThe Hollies recorded \"Man With No Expression (Horses Through A Rainstorm)\" in mid-1968. It was written by Graham Nash and Terry Reid. Terry Reid recorded his own version, and later Crosby Stills & Nash would record a version. Ironically, the CSN version remained unreleased until 1991 and the Hollies' version remained unreleased until 1993.\n\nGraham Nash recorded \"Happiness Runs\" with Donovan and Lesley Duncan for Donovan's LP \"Barabajagal\" that would be released in 1969.\n\nThe Hollies duetted \"Lawdy Miss Clawdy\" with Tom Jones on the Tom Jones show in late 1969.\n\nTony Hicks was the first person outside of the Beatles' circle to hear \"Abbey Road\" in its entirety. Paul McCartney played it to him to ask for his honest opinion on it.\n\nBernie Calvert played bass for the Bread and Beer Band who featured Elton John and Caleb Quaye. They recorded an LP worth of instrumental tracks and one - \"Dick Barton Theme\" - was released as a single but flopped. The album was cancelled and remains unreleased officially.\n\nThe Hollies duetted \"Going To The Zoo\" with Julie Felix on the Julie Felix Show in 1970.\n\nDoris Troy (who wrote their 1964 hit \"Just One Look\") and Madeline Bell (from Blue Mink) sang backing vocals on \"Life I've Lead\" and \"Hold On\" from \"Distant Light\" in 1971.\n\nAllan Clarke sings \"It Ain't Me Babe\" on Steve Howe's 1999 album, \"Portraits Of Dylan\". It's Allan's last vocal studio recording before he retired.\n\nTony Hicks plays banjo TheNewNo2's project \"Beautiful Creatures - The Motion Picture Soundtrack\" in 2013. The group features his son Paul Hicks and George Harrison's son Dhani Harrison.\n\nPost by gee on\n\nThe Searchers had a minor hit with 'Have You Ever Loved Somebody' in 1966 (their final UK chart hit in the sixties) while Paul & Barry Ryan also did a cover produced by ex-Searchers drummer Chris Curtis - apparently Graham Nash gave a demo to Chris while Tony Hicks gave a demo to John McNally\n\nEx-Manfred Mike Vickers does Hollies arrangements on 'For Certain Because...', 'Evolution' plus 'Blowin In The Wind' and 'A Taste of Honey' second version in 1968\n\nThe Mike Sammes Singers are the choir at the conclusion of 'He Ain't Heavy...He's My Brother' - as they are on The Beatles 'Good Night' and feature on 'I Am The Walrus' plus feature on some recordings by Cliff Richard and also The Shadows\n\nTony Hicks and Kenny Lynch wrote 'Faded Images' for Cilla Black on her album 'Images' - Cilla also did a version of 'The Air That I Breathe' and Graham Nash's 'Sleep Song'\n\nPaul and Linda McCartney loaned their 'Band on The Run' moog synth' for The Hollies 'Another Night' track\n\nWings sideman and Merseybeat figure Howie Casey plays brass on the 'Buddy Holly' album while Don Harper plays fiddle\n\nThe Shadows did instrumental versions of both 'He Ain't Heavy...' and 'The Air That I Breathe' while Bruce Welch produced The Hollies three versions of 'I Don't Understand You' in 1981\n\nHollies producer Ron Richards also produced The Paramounts (the original Procol Harum band - PH later had the identical line up of ex-Paramounts at one point) they had a UK hit with 'Poison Ivy' (probably hence Gary Brooker & B.J. Wilson guesting with The Hollies in 1971 and 1979)\n\nRon in partnership with George Martin (Beatles, America, Ron Goodwin, comedy records, etc), John Burgess (Manfred Mann with Paul Jones, Freddie & The Dreamers etc), and Peter Sullivan (Tom Jones, Englebert, etc) jointly formed AIR Studios where 'Distant Light' was recorded in 1971 as a Hollies gesture of support\n\nit is possible that Ron Richards was unavailable for at least some of the 'Confessions of The Mind' sessions - tho' Ron did produce some tracks it may well be that The Hollies self produced some of it...with Manfreds & EMI staff producer John Burgess 'nominally' being in overall charge maybe just 'signing off' the sessions documentation etc - notably the 1970 LP has NO producer credit at all despite Johnny Scott getting an arranger credit !\n\nLater a cassette version stated Ron as the producer, but a CD version listed John Burgess name as producer, so it's something of a mystery but perfectly possible Burgess oversaw their self produced work until Richards came back - we do know Ron was unwell just after and missed about half of 'Distant Light' sessions which they self produced\n\nBobby later told me that Ron Richards DID actually produce 'Write On' in 1976 but Polydor omitted giving him any credit for some strange reason instead putting just; 'A Hollies Production' on the innersleeve - whether that is accurate or Bobby was mis-remembering I don't know, but I'd think Bobby would be correct as he was there !\n\nPost by Gralto on\n\nYes there are so many major and minor collaborations of Hollies members with other artists while still in the band. Too many to name now but I wanted to add 3 of my favourites, all little known or even fully unknown to Hollieholics.\n\n(1) Allan Clarke and Maurice Gibb. When I interviewed Clarkey back in 2013, he mentioned he had done some recording with Maurice Gibb. What?? I pressed with questions as to when/where/why etc but he couldn't remember. Given the Bee Gees fell out with each other in 1969/70 and Maurice found himself a solo artist, perhaps it was around then. Gibb's one and only solo album 'The Loner' from 1970 remains (officially) unissued and though Clarke's name is not known to be attached to this project, who knows?\n\n(2) Allan could also not recall - in fact I don't think he had any knowledge - of how Gordon Waller (of Peter and Gordon fame) came to record a version (never officially released) in 1969 of his ode to Graham's departure 'My Life Is Over With You'. Of course they would have known each other for sure through the business and doubtless bumping into each other at London hot spots of the day like the Bag O'Nails and the Scotch of St James during the 60s.\n\nHear it here:\n\n(Surprised to find that this is on YT – it’s had a whopping 27 views since being added over 2 and half years ago!! I think the readers of this forum may comfortably double that now...)\n\n(3) This is the most bizarre one IMHO. Late in 1969, Tony Hicks spent time producing both sides of a 45 of British tenor and opera singer, Joseph Ward. Aside from one mention in an Australian newspaper interview in January 1970, I have never seen this written about elsewhere, meaning it will probably be news to all of you too. (I was saving things like this for my book project but y'know...it's still a way off and I keep changing my mind on what I’m trying to achieve!) The A-Side - 'Go My Love' is utterly forgettable but the B-Side, 'I Am The Preacher', a Cook-Greenaway penned number, has a lot going for it. Someone has put this side of the 45 up on Youtube, though he/she’s unaware of the Hollies link.\n\nGo My Love – I couldn’t find this up there – not missing much!\n\nI Am The Preacher:\n\nThe above transfer is not that great – the bassline on my 45 sounds far better.\n\nHow did Tony get involved in this project? It was Ward’s first 45 and sank without a trace.\n\nKnut – yes you are correct – Allan gets a credit on Wings 1979 ‘Back To The Egg’ album though for what reason precisely is not known. Somewhere in my notes I have the answer as someone once asked Macca but I can’t locate it at present – GEE may know. You’d think it would be backing vocals but in the Rickfors era when he was on his solo kick, to bring in some dollars, sometimes AC was harmonica player for hire too. He once played on a super obscure budget priced album of instrumental Dylan covers. The things you learn from scouring charity shops for several decades!!\n\nFor mentions of links to other artists etc, you may also wish to revisit this old EO thread:\n\nelevatedobservations.proboards.com/thread/3/hollies-record-collector-vinyl-rarities\n\ncheers\n\nSimon\n\nPost by gee on\n\nI'll dig out my copy of 'Back To The Egg' and check it out !\n\nit was stated in a 'Carousel' that Allan and Graham may have helped John & Paul a little when writing 'Misery' (later given to Kenny Lynch after Helen Shapiro rejected it !)- they were all together at some place (Abbey Road ?) and Allan & Graham were chipping in lyric ideas which John & Paul took note of - may only be a recollection and inaccurate but it's possible...we do know each group dropped in on each other's recording sessions from time to time\n\nBobby recalled Brian Epstein buying lunch for The Hollies once too\n\n- what a gentleman !\n\nRon Richards of course produced the album version of 'Love Me Do' getting in drummer Andy White and relegating Ringo to just tambourine !\n\nI do know that Peter Asher of Peter & Gordon was friendly with a number of the bands back then, and knew Paul Jones (also like Clarke a noted harmonica player - Mike Rickfors guests on a recent solo album) - Paul also covered 'Lady Godiva' in 1966 which he hated and said; 'Peter told me so did he and Gordon Waller too !' - while The Hollies knew other Manfreds; Mike Vickers, Jack Bruce and Klaus Voormann so it's quite possible the link to 'Peter & Gordon' re Gordon Waller's later cover of MLIOWY originally came via their mutual Manfreds friends (?)\n\nI have read that Keith Relf of The Yardbirds once broke his hand trying to emulate karate chops Clarke and Nash were doing...! (Jimmy Page could be the Yardbirds / Hollies link)\n\nwe know they knew Graham Gouldman (later of 10cc) recording three of his songs over 1965-67\n\nIt has been rumoured that Bobby apparently recorded a track in 1965 with fellow drummer Bob Henrit (then of The Roulettes, later in Argent and in the 80's The Kinks too) - hopefully Bobby's forthcoming book may shed some light on this ? - it may have been an instrumental but I have never heard anything more about it, no title or anything, so it clearly never was released even if actually recorded - that would be around the time Bobby was voted 'Best Drummer' in the NME poll and it might well be Bobby that George Harrison is referring to in the film 'Help !' when he tells poor Ringo;\n\n'There's a good drummer in Manchester' !\n\nthe late Alan Pooley of 'Carousel' gave a date once that Allan, Tony, and Graham were at Abbey Road with other famous star guests to record a song titled; 'That's Rock & Roll Ah' - apparently intended for the (never completed or at least released to date) second volume of a Romanian charity appeal album George Harrison was doing - Alan Pooley quoted an exact date in an old edition of 'Carousel' so he must have been told that from some source..\n\n....it didn't mention Bobby being there or involved at all (who told me he knew nothing of this) however I DO hold a handwritten note from Tony Hicks advising they had been recording both with John Miles ('Carrie' it later transpired)...and Graham Nash ('Somethin' Ain't Right')...and also with Thin Lizzy bass player/singer Phil Lynott (?? - could that be this 'That's Rock & Roll Ah' song ?)\n\nThe Hollies had stormy liasons with The Dave Clark Five, The Small Faces, and The Tremeloes - often it was a case back then of petty arguments in package tours or on TV shows over who got 'Top billing' and doing their respective covers of songs before each began composing their own hits properly\n\nBill Wyman compliments The Hollies in his book 'A Stone Alone' - saying Stones and Hollies were good friends (hence the thanks on 'Metamorphosis' cover) - Bill said Tony Hicks (& Jane) were with Eric Clapton and other 'Stones guests' backstage at the famous Hyde Park concert in 1969"
