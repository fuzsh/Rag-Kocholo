        "text": "Their moniker was based on John Lennon’s “Bad Finger Boogie” working title for “With A Little Help from My Friends” – though I prefer George’s revelation that it was inspired by a stripper who worked the Hamburg music scene as Helga Fabdinger. A gifted composer/singer, the late Tom Evans anchored the brilliant yet doomed Badfinger. Originally a guitarist for The Iveys, his bass playing cemented the classic line-up with Pete Ham, Joey Molland, and Mike Gibbins.\n\nAkin to their Apple bosses, Evans and Badfinger were exemplary song players – rendering exactly what the compositions and recordings required harmonically, rhythmically, and aesthetically.\n\nTom Evans Sound & Vision…\n\n“Baby Blue” https://youtu.be/9k_aj6b2xsA\n\n“No Matter What” https://youtu.be/9x1MZEDQbtA\n\n“Come and Get It” https://youtu.be/9tOnbeNAxdU\n\n“Day After Day” https://youtu.be/XonFZjuyc6E\n\nPhoto courtesy of Mo Foster Com\n\nAmong the most revered and versatile British session and touring bassists, Mo Foster’s talents as a composer, musician, educator, and author were equaled by his uncanny wit, hospitality, and sidesplitting sense of humor!You know Mo the bassist from his stellar work with a wide range of artists and ensembles including Affinity, Jeff Beck, Eric Clapton, Phil Collins, Luka Bloom, Howard Jones, Russ Ballard, Michael Schenker, Maggie Bell, Gerry Rafferty, Joan Armatrading, Kevin Ayres, Gary Moore, Scott Walker, and the London Symphony Orchestra, among scores of others.\n\nMo Foster Sound & Vision…\n\nAffinity https://youtu.be/LVxTQZLVVYU\n\nJeff Beck https://youtu.be/P1vduurgxWQ\n\nMo Foster & Friends https://youtu.be/8VBu5E0WgRM\n\nYou’ve heard Mo’s bass artistry support James Bond in For Your Eyes Only (1981) and Octopussy (1983).\n\nAs a bandleader Mr. Foster has waxed a handful of brilliant jazz/fusion/ambient albums including Bel Assis (1988) and Southern Reunion (1991) featuring guitar icon Gary Moore and drummers Gary Husband and Simon Phillips.\n\nBravely venturing where no voltage enhanced bassist had gone before, Mo founded the first academic course in electric bass at the Goldsmiths College, University of London in 1975.\n\nMo’s two terrific tomes: 17 Watts? The First 20 Years of British Rock Guitar: The Musicians and Their Stories (2000) and British Rock Guitar: The First 50 Years (2013) – the latter of which I reviewed for Huffington Post and interviewed Mo are essential for musos and fans alike.\n\nMy interview with Mo on Huffington Post for History of British Rock Guitar https://bit.ly/2QVBxwm\n\nMy interview with Mo’s Affinity bandmate Linda Hoyle on Huffington Post talkin’ Mo https://bit.ly/35A8d3M\n\nWatch Mo Foster on Know Your Bass Player on Film Season One – 2014, from Mo’s home in London https://bit.ly/2EBNPHH"
