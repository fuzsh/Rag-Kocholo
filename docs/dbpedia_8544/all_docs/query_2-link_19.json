        "text": "Happy Thanksgiving! This is a Thanksgiving tradition…tonight I start another! The Beatles Get Back on Disney Plus.\n\nThe movie that Arlo movie made called Alice’s Restaurant is a fun watch. My next tradition is coming up with my next post.\n\nEvery Thanksgiving I listen to Alice’s Restaurant and this is the fourth year in a row that I’ve posted it on the 4th Thursday of November. Sorry if you are tired of it but it’s not Thanksgiving until Alice’s Restaurant is played…and the Last Waltz is watched also but that is a different story.\n\nIt’s not Thanksgiving without listening to this 1967 song. This song did not chart but he did have another version that did chart…it was called Alice’s Rock and Roll Restaurant that peaked at #97 in the Billboard 100.\n\nMany radio stations play this on Thanksgiving. This is usually the only time they play it, since the song is over 18-minutes long.\n\nThere have been mixed reviews about the movie that was made…I’ve always found it enjoyable. It’s not going to be confused with Gone With The Wind but it’s a fun period movie.\n\nIn 1991, Arlo bought the church where this took place and set up “The Guthrie Center,” where he runs programs for kids who have been abused.\n\nFrom Songfacts\n\nRunning 18 minutes and 34 seconds, this song is based on a true story that happened on Thanksgiving Day, 1965. Arlo was 18, and along with his friend Rick Robbins, drove to Stockbridge, Massachusetts to have Thanksgiving dinner with Alice and Ray Brock. Alice and Ray lived in a church – the former Trinity Church on Division Street in Stockbridge – and were used to inviting people into their home. Arlo and Rick had been traveling together, Arlo working his way up in folk singing and Rick tagging along. A number of people, Arlo and Rick included, were considered members of the family, so they were not guests in the usual sense.\n\nWhen Ray woke up the next morning, he said to them, “Let’s clean up the church and get all this crap out of here, for God’s sake. This place is a mess,” and Rick said, “Sure.” Arlo and Rick swept up and loaded all the crap into a VW microbus and went out to the dump, which was closed. They started driving around until Arlo remembered a side road in Stockbridge up on Prospect Hill by the Indian Hill Music Camp which he attended one summer, so they drove up there and dumped the garbage.A little later, the phone rang, and it was Stockbridge police chief William J. Obanhein. “I found an envelope with the name Brock on it,” Chief Obanhein said. The truth came out, and soon the boys found themselves in Obanhein’s police car. They went up to Prospect Hill, and Obie took some pictures. On the back, he marked them, “PROSPECT HILL RUBBISH DUMPING FILE UNDER GUTHRIE AND ROBBINS 11/26/65.” He took the kids to jail.The kids went in, pleaded, “Guilty, Your Honor,” was fined $25 each and ordered to retrieve the rubbish. Then they all went back to the church and started to write “Alice’s Restaurant” together. “We were sitting around after dinner and wrote half the song,” Alice recalls, “and the other half, the draft part, Arlo wrote.”\n\nGuthrie, the son of legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie, greatly exaggerated the part about getting arrested for comic effect. In the song, he is taken away in handcuffs and put in a cell with hardened criminals.\n\nIn the song, Guthrie avoids the draft and did not have to serve in Vietnam because of his littering arrest. In reality, he was eligible but wasn’t drafted because his number didn’t come up.\n\nGuthrie performed this song for the first time on July 16, 1967, at the Newport Folk Festival.\n\nThis reflected the attitude of many young people in America at the time. It was considered an antiwar song, but unlike most protest songs, it used humor to speak out against authority.\n\nAfter a while, Guthrie stopped playing this at concerts, claiming he forgot the words. As the song approached its 30th anniversary, he started playing it again.\n\nGuthrie made a movie of the same name in 1969 which was based on the song.\n\nOver the years, Guthrie added different words to the song. He recorded a new, longer version in 1995 at The Guthrie Center\n\nAlice’s Restuarant\n\nThis song is called Alice’s Restaurant, and it’s about Alice, and the\n\nRestaurant, but Alice’s Restaurant is not the name of the restaurant,\n\nThat’s just the name of the song, and that’s why I called the song Alice’s\n\nRestaurant.\n\nYou can get anything you want at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nYou can get anything you want at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nWalk right in it’s around the back\n\nJust a half a mile from the railroad track\n\nYou can get anything you want at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nNow it all started two Thanksgivings ago, was on – two years ago on\n\nThanksgiving, when my friend and I went up to visit Alice at the\n\nRestaurant, but Alice doesn’t live in the restaurant, she lives in the\n\nChurch nearby the restaurant, in the bell-tower, with her husband Ray and\n\nFasha the dog. And livin’ in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of\n\nRoom downstairs where the pews used to be in. Havin’ all that room,\n\nSeein’ as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn’t\n\nHave to take out their garbage for a long time.\n\nWe got up there, we found all the garbage in there, and we decided it’d be\n\nA friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump. So\n\nWe took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red vw\n\nMicrobus, took shovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed\n\nOn toward the city dump.\n\nWell we got there and there was a big sign and a chain across across the\n\nDump saying, “Closed on Thanksgiving.” And we had never heard of a dump\n\nClosed on Thanksgiving before, and with tears in our eyes we drove off\n\nInto the sunset looking for another place to put the garbage.\n\nWe didn’t find one. Until we came to a side road, and off the side of the\n\nSide road there was another fifteen foot cliff and at the bottom of the\n\nCliff there was another pile of garbage. And we decided that one big pile\n\nIs better than two little piles, and rather than bring that one up we\n\nDecided to throw our’s down.\n\nThat’s what we did, and drove back to the church, had a thanksgiving\n\nDinner that couldn’t be beat, went to sleep and didn’t get up until the\n\nNext morning, when we got a phone call from officer Obie. He said, “Kid,\n\nWe found your name on an envelope at the bottom of a half a ton of\n\nGarbage, and just wanted to know if you had any information about it. ” And\n\nI said, “Yes, sir, Officer Obie, I cannot tell a lie, I put that envelope\n\nUnder that garbage. ”\n\nAfter speaking to Obie for about forty-five minutes on the telephone we\n\nFinally arrived at the truth of the matter and said that we had to go down\n\nAnd pick up the garbage, and also had to go down and speak to him at the\n\nPolice officer’s station. So we got in the red vw microbus with the\n\nShovels and rakes and implements of destruction and headed on toward the\n\nPolice officer’s station.\n\nNow friends, there was only one or two things that Obie coulda done at\n\nThe police station, and the first was he could have given us a medal for\n\nBeing so brave and honest on the telephone, which wasn’t very likely, and\n\nWe didn’t expect it, and the other thing was he could have bawled us out\n\nAnd told us never to be seen driving garbage around the vicinity again,\n\nWhich is what we expected, but when we got to the police officer’s station\n\nThere was a third possibility that we hadn’t even counted upon, and we was\n\nBoth immediately arrested. Handcuffed. And I said “Obie, I don’t think I\n\nCan pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on. ” He said, “Shut up, kid.\n\nGet in the back of the patrol car. ”\n\nAnd that’s what we did, sat in the back of the patrol car and drove to the\n\nQuote Scene of the Crime unquote. I want tell you about the town of\n\nStockbridge, Massachusets, where this happened here, they got three stop\n\nSigns, two police officers, and one police car, but when we got to the\n\nScene of the Crime there was five police officers and three police cars,\n\nBeing the biggest crime of the last fifty years, and everybody wanted to\n\nGet in the newspaper story about it. And they was using up all kinds of\n\nCop equipment that they had hanging around the police officer’s station.\n\nThey was taking plaster tire tracks, foot prints, dog smelling prints, and\n\nThey took twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy photographs with circles\n\nAnd arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one explaining what each\n\nOne was to be used as evidence against us. Took pictures of the approach,\n\nThe getaway, the northwest corner the southwest corner and that’s not to\n\nMention the aerial photography.\n\nAfter the ordeal, we went back to the jail. Obie said he was going to put\n\nUs in the cell. Said, “Kid, I’m going to put you in the cell, I want your\n\nWallet and your belt. ” And I said, “Obie, I can understand you wanting my\n\nWallet so I don’t have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you\n\nWant my belt for? ” And he said, “Kid, we don’t want any hangings. ” I\n\nSaid, “Obie, did you think I was going to hang myself for littering?”\n\nObie said he was making sure, and friends Obie was, cause he took out the\n\nToilet seat so I couldn’t hit myself over the head and drown, and he took\n\nOut the toilet paper so I couldn’t bend the bars roll out the – roll the\n\nToilet paper out the window, slide down the roll and have an escape. Obie\n\nWas making sure, and it was about four or five hours later that Alice\n\n(remember Alice? It’s a song about Alice), Alice came by and with a few\n\nNasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail, and we went back\n\nTo the church, had a another thanksgiving dinner that couldn’t be beat,\n\nAnd didn’t get up until the next morning, when we all had to go to court.\n\nWe walked in, sat down, Obie came in with the twenty seven eight-by-ten\n\nColour glossy pictures with circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back\n\nOf each one, sat down. Man came in said, “All rise.” We all stood up,\n\nAnd Obie stood up with the twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy\n\nPictures, and the judge walked in sat down with a seeing eye dog, and he\n\nSat down, we sat down. Obie looked at the seeing eye dog, and then at the\n\nTwenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy pictures with circles and arrows\n\nAnd a paragraph on the back of each one, and looked at the seeing eye dog.\n\nAnd then at twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy pictures with circles\n\nAnd arrows and a paragraph on the back of each one and began to cry,\n\n’cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American\n\nBlind justice, and there wasn’t nothing he could do about it, and the\n\nJudge wasn’t going to look at the twenty seven eight-by-ten colour glossy\n\nPictures with the circles and arrows and a paragraph on the back of each\n\nOne explaining what each one was to be used as evidence against us. And\n\nWe was fined $50 and had to pick up the garbage in the snow, but that’s not\n\nWhat I came to tell you about.\n\nCame to talk about the draft.\n\nThey got a building down New York City, it’s called Whitehall Street,\n\nWhere you walk in, you get injected, inspected, detected, infected,\n\nNeglected and selected. I went down to get my physical examination one\n\nDay, and I walked in, I sat down, got good and drunk the night before, so\n\nI looked and felt my best when I went in that morning. ‘Cause I wanted to\n\nLook like the all-American kid from New York City, man I wanted, I wanted\n\nTo feel like the all-, I wanted to be the all American kid from New York,\n\nAnd I walked in, sat down, I was hung down, brung down, hung up, and all\n\nKinds o’ mean nasty ugly things. And I waked in and sat down and they gave\n\nMe a piece of paper, said, “Kid, see the phsychiatrist, room 604.”\n\nAnd I went up there, I said, “Shrink, I want to kill. I mean, I wanna, I\n\nWanna kill. Kill. I wanna, I wanna see, I wanna see blood and gore and\n\nGuts and veins in my teeth. Eat dead burnt bodies. I mean kill, Kill,\n\nKill, kill. ” And I started jumping up and down yelling, “kill, kill, ” and\n\nHe started jumping up and down with me and we was both jumping up and down\n\nYelling, “KILL, KILL.” And the Sargent came over, pinned a medal on me,\n\nSent me down the hall, said, “You’re our boy.”\n\nDidn’t feel too good about it.\n\nProceeded on down the hall gettin more injections, inspections,\n\nDetections, neglections and all kinds of stuff that they was doin’ to me\n\nAt the thing there, and I was there for two hours, three hours, four\n\nHours, I was there for a long time going through all kinds of mean nasty\n\nUgly things and I was just having a tough time there, and they was\n\nInspecting, injecting every single part of me, and they was leaving no\n\nPart untouched. Proceeded through, and when I finally came to the see the\n\nLast man, I walked in, walked in sat down after a whole big thing there,\n\nAnd I walked up and said, “What do you want?” He said, “Kid, we only got\n\nOne question. Have you ever been arrested? ”\n\nAnd I proceeded to tell him the story of the Alice’s Restaurant Massacre,\n\nWith full orchestration and five part harmony and stuff like that and all\n\nThe phenome… – and he stopped me right there and said, “Kid, did you ever\n\nGo to court? ”\n\nAnd I proceeded to tell him the story of the twenty seven eight-by-ten\n\nColour glossy pictures with the circles and arrows and the paragraph on\n\nThe back of each one, and he stopped me right there and said, “Kid, I want\n\nYou to go and sit down on that bench that says Group W…. Now kid!! ”\n\nAnd I, I walked over to the, to the bench there, and there is, Group W’s\n\nWhere they put you if you may not be moral enough to join the army after\n\nCommitting your special crime, and there was all kinds of mean nasty ugly\n\nLooking people on the bench there. Mother rapers. Father stabbers. Father\n\nRapers! Father rapers sitting right there on the bench next to me! And\n\nThey was mean and nasty and ugly and horrible crime-type guys sitting on the\n\nBench next to me. And the meanest, ugliest, nastiest one, the meanest\n\nFather raper of them all, was coming over to me and he was mean ‘n’ ugly\n\n‘n’ nasty ‘n’ horrible and all kind of things and he sat down next to me\n\nAnd said, “Kid, whad’ya get?” I said, “I didn’t get nothing, I had to pay\n\n$50 and pick up the garbage. ” He said, “What were you arrested for, kid? ”\n\nAnd I said, “Littering.” And they all moved away from me on the bench\n\nThere, and the hairy eyeball and all kinds of mean nasty things, till I\n\nSaid, “And creating a nuisance.” And they all came back, shook my hand,\n\nAnd we had a great time on the bench, talkin about crime, mother stabbing,\n\nFather raping, all kinds of groovy things that we was talking about on the\n\nBench. And everything was fine, we was smoking cigarettes and all kinds of\n\nThings, until the Sargeant came over, had some paper in his hand, held it\n\nUp and said.\n\n“Kids, this-piece-of-paper’s-got-47-words-37-sentences-58-words-we-wanna-\n\nKnow-details-of-the-crime-time-of-the-crime-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-\n\nYou-gotta-say-pertaining-to-and-about-the-crime-I-want-to-know-arresting-\n\nOfficer’s-name-and-any-other-kind-of-thing-you-gotta-say”, and talked for\n\nForty-five minutes and nobody understood a word that he said, but we had\n\nFun filling out the forms and playing with the pencils on the bench there,\n\nAnd I filled out the massacre with the four part harmony and wrote it\n\nDown there, just like it was, and everything was fine and I put down the\n\nPencil and I turned over the piece of paper, and there, there on the\n\nOther side, in the middle of the other side, away from everything else on\n\nThe other side, in parentheses, capital letters, quotated, read the\n\nFollowing words:\n\n(“KID, HAVE YOU REHABILITATED YOURSELF?”)\n\nI went over to the Sargent, said, “Sargeant, you got a lot a damn gall to\n\nAsk me if I’ve rehabilitated myself, I mean, I mean, I mean that just, I’m\n\nSittin’ here on the bench, I mean I’m sitting here on the Group W bench\n\n’cause you want to know if I’m moral enough join the army, burn women,\n\nKids, houses and villages after bein’ a litterbug. ” He looked at me and\n\nSaid, “Kid, we don’t like your kind, and we’re gonna send you fingerprints\n\nOff to Washington. ”\n\nAnd friends, somewhere in Washington enshrined in some little folder, is a\n\nstudy in black and white of my fingerprints. And the only reason I’m\n\nsinging you this song now is cause you may know somebody in a similar\n\nsituation, or you may be in a similar situation, and if your in a\n\nsituation like that there’s only one thing you can do and that’s walk into\n\nThe shrink wherever you are, just walk in say “Shrink, You can get\n\nAnything you want, at Alice’s restaurant. “. And walk out. You know, if\n\nOne person, just one person does it they may think he’s really sick and\n\nThey won’t take him. And if two people, two people do it, in harmony,\n\nThey may think they’re both faggots and they won’t take either of them.\n\nAnd three people do it, three, can you imagine, three people walking in\n\nSingin a bar of Alice’s Restaurant and walking out. They may think it’s an\n\nOrganization. And can you, can you imagine fifty people a day, I said\n\nFifty people a day walking in singing a bar of Alice’s Restaurant and\n\nWalking out. And friends they may think it’s a movement.\n\nAnd that’s what it is, the Alice’s Restaurant Anti-Massacre Movement, and\n\nAll you got to do to join is sing it the next time it comes around on the\n\nGuitar.\n\nWith feeling. So we’ll wait for it to come around on the guitar, here and\n\nSing it when it does. Here it comes.\n\nYou can get anything you want, at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nYou can get anything you want, at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nWalk right in it’s around the back\n\nJust a half a mile from the railroad track\n\nYou can get anything you want, at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nThat was horrible. If you want to end war and stuff you got to sing loud.\n\nI’ve been singing this song now for twenty-five minutes. I could sing it\n\nFor another twenty-five minutes. I’m not proud… Or tired.\n\nSo we’ll wait till it comes around again, and this time with four part\n\nHarmony and feeling.\n\nWe’re just waitin’ for it to come around is what we’re doing.\n\nAll right now.\n\nYou can get anything you want, at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nExcepting Alice\n\nYou can get anything you want, at Alice’s Restaurant\n\nWalk right in it’s around the back\n\nJust a half a mile from the railroad track\n\nYou can get anything you want, at Alice’s Restaurant"
