        "text": "AUSTIN -- Joey Molland, one of the two surviving members of the '70s band Badfinger, will perform in concert July 3 at the Holiday Inn in Austin.\n\nMolland, who in recent eyars has kept alive the Badfinger name and has released a solo album, will be the headline act of a show that also includes tributes to Elvis Presley and Buddy Holly.\n\nThrough Badfinger, Molland had the good fortune to have his name forever associated with the Beatles. Badfinger was the first band signed to the Beatles' own Apple Records, and the group's first hit single, ``Come and Get It,'' was written by Paul McCartney.\n\nAnother of Badfinger's hits, ``Day After Day,'' was produced by George Harrison, and the band backed Harrison at his landmark Concert for Bangla Desh in 1971 in New York. They also played on solo recordings by Harrison and John Lennon. Badfinger's biggest hit was ``No Matter What,'' a slice of perfect power pop, although their albums often contained more haunting material, much of it composed by Molland.\n\nBadfinger left Apple in 1973 after a contract dispute, released two critically acclaimed albums that didn't sell, and got caught up in yet another record company snafu. Frustrated by management and financial problems, Molland left the band later that year. In 1975, Badfinger's lead vocalist, Pete Ham, committed suicide.\n\nThe string of bad vibes continued unabated. Molland had minor success as a solo artist, and eventually rejoined with original member Tom Evans to form a new Badfinger. But in 1983, Evans also killed himself.\n\nA native of Liverpool, Molland now lives in the Twin Cities, and continues to perform.\n\nTickets are $8 in advance at Nemitz's and Apold Music in Austin, Face the Music in Rochester, Kopet Music in Albert Lea, and Tone Music in Owatonna. Tickets will be $10 at the door. Patrons must be 21.@et"
