        "text": "Badfinger\n\ntheir spectacular rise, and tragic fall\n\nBadfinger were originally a Welsh / English rock band formed in Swansea that were active from the 1960s to the 1980s. The best-known line-up consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans, and Joey Molland. They are recognized for their influence on the 1970s power pop genre.\n\nBadfinger, the beginning\n\nThe band evolved from an earlier group called the Iveys, formed in 1961, which became the first group signed by the Beatles \"Apple\" label in 1968. The band renamed themselves Badfinger, after the working title for the Beatles' 1967 song \"With a Little Help from My Friends \"(\" Bad Finger Boogie \"). From 1968 to 1973, Badfinger recorded five albums for Apple and toured extensively before becoming embroiled in the chaos of Apple Records' dissolution.\n\nBadfinger had four consecutive worldwide hits from 1970 to 1972: \"Come and Get It\" (written and produced by Paul McCartney, 1970), \"No Matter What\" (produced by Mal Evans, 1970), \"Day After Day\" (produced by George Harrison, 1971), and \"Baby Blue\" (produced by Todd Rundgren 1972). Their song \"Without You\" (1970) has been recorded many times, becoming a US number-one hit for Harry Nilsson and, decades later, a UK number-one for Mariah Carey.\n\nHarry Nillson heard the song at a party, and liked what he heard.\n\nNext day, he telephoned the lady who's house the party was, asking who that record was by. She thought it was Grapefruit, then found out it was Badfinger.\n\nHarry recorded the song, and Badfinger just happened to be in the same recording venue. At the end of the Nillson's session, Harry invited them into the studio, tuned the lights down, and played them his finished version of \"Without You\", showing the band what could be done with such a great song.\n\nThe beginning of the end of Badfinger.\n\nAfter Apple Records folded in 1973, Badfinger struggled with a host of legal, managerial and financial issues, leading to Ham's taking his own life in 1975. Over the next three years, surviving members struggled to rebuild their personal and professional lives against a backdrop of lawsuits, which tied up the songwriters' royalty payments for years. Their subsequent albums floundered.\n\nAs Molland and Evans alternated between cooperation and conflict, their attempts to revive and capitalize on the Badfinger legacy floundered.\n\nIn 1983, Evans also died by suicide.\n\nBadfinger Vinyl\n\nMy 5 Top Badfinger Songs\n\nBadfinger have put out some really good music. Everyone has their own favorite Badfinger stuff, here are my 5 faves in no particular order.\n\nTake it All. The opening track on the \"Strait Up\" album. Written by Peter Ham and featuring him o vocal, guitar, keyboards, it gets the album off to a moody start.\n\nDay After Day. Another Peter Ham song off \"Strait Up\" with Peter and Joey Molland on vocals. George Harrison plays slide guitar on this and produced the track. Leon Russell on keyboard.\n\nNo Matter What. Probably my favorite Badfinger song, it really moves along. Gutsy guitar, good vocals and classic harmonies. and, nice drum fill!\n\nWithout You. I didn't know this was a Ham/Evans song, always thought it was a Harry Nilsson, having only ever heard him sing it. It wasn't till 1975 when I got \"No Dice\" in for a customer at my shop that I heard the original version. A classic example of two songs written by the two members put together to make one classic song.\n\nBaby Blue. Another Peter Ham song, it moves along nicely. It was written about as girl had met in the US, but on returning to England, did not contact her. The song got to No. 14 in the US, was scheduled to be released as a single in the UK, but Apple cancelled the release.\n\nBadfinger Vinyl"
