        "text": "Badfinger was a British rock band formed in Swansea, Wales in the early 1960s. The original lineup consisted of Pete Ham, Mike Gibbins, Tom Evans, and Ron Griffiths. The band was initially known as The Iveys and released several unsuccessful singles before changing their name to Badfinger in 1969 and signing to Apple Records, the label founded by The Beatles.\n\nBadfinger's first hit single, \"Come and Get It,\" was written by Paul McCartney and produced by George Martin. It reached number 7 on the UK charts and number 4 on the US charts. This success was followed by several more hit singles, including \"No Matter What,\" \"Day After Day,\" and \"Baby Blue.\"\n\nDespite their success, Badfinger struggled with financial problems and legal disputes with their management and record label. Tragically, both Pete Ham and Tom Evans died by suicide in the 1970s, which has been attributed in part to their financial and legal difficulties.\n\nDespite the sad end to the band's story, Badfinger's music has continued to be celebrated and influential. Their blend of rock, pop, and folk elements, combined with their strong harmonies and memorable melodies, has earned them a dedicated fan base and enduring popularity.\n\nThe story of Badfinger is one of the most tragic ones in rock. These guys never received the recognition and credit they were due, and their music STILL sounds great. -GSH\n\nThe Iveys I (1964 - 1965)\n\nPete Ham - guitar/keyboards/vocals - b.
