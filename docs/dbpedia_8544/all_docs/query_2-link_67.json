        "text": "The violin is a 4-stringed instrument that is generally played with a bow (though it can be plucked as well for a staccato sound plus there are now 5-string versions). The strings are attached to pegs at the top that allow them to be tuned – usually to G, D, A & E (adding a C if it has a fifth one). The strings pass over a bridge that transfers the vibrations to the hollow wooden body (soundboard) that amplifies them. On either side of the bridge are f-holes that allow the sound to escape the inside of the instrument. This was the case before electrified violins, but as can be seen from the intro pictures manufacturers have come up with all sorts of wild shapes including the skull violin made by Stratton with the advent of amplification.\n\nBowed/stringed instruments appear in history about the 1400’s in Arabia then in to Europe. By the mid-1500’s the Italians were making instruments that look like violins as we know them. People like Andrea Amati (1505-1577) and Antonio Stradivari (1644-1737) helped evolve the instrument’s curvature and bridge height along with perfecting materials. Originally they were made with dense woods such as maple, spruce, poplar, ebony, boxwood, willow and rosewood though resins are now used as well. The strings themselves can be gut, synthetic polymers or steel.\n\nSo what is the difference between a violin and a fiddle? Heck, the rocknroll sister Cheryl played and sang in Fiddlin Ed’s Swinging Country Band maybe 40 years ago so I guess she could tell me if there is a difference. Apparently there is no difference other than semantic implications. To play the violin seems to mean more formal use written out (a la classical music) while fiddling connotes playing rough and tumble to get the feet moving. Whatever the definition, we will make no distinction. What follows is a list of 25 bands/individuals who incorporate ‘fiddling about’ into their sound. I admit to not being a big fan of jazz so don’t look for those sorts of players. I can hear at least one of you say “where is John Cale (Velvet Underground)?” He played the viola which plays in a deeper register and is tuned differently. Feel free to submit comments with your additions. By the way, Jack Fallon’s fiddle contribution to Ringo’s song “Don’t Pass Me By” (from their 1968 double album The Beatles) didn’t make our list as he was an old jazz-bo who played this as a session only and of course was not a member of the Fab Four.\n\n1.Dave Swarbrick – Fairport Convention\n\nTo your blogger there is no better player than the late Swarb when he was with Fairport Convention from 1969 till 1979. He started with the Ian Campbell Folk Group in 1960 playing British traditional ballads then played sessions. He was asked to fiddle on “A Sailor’s Life” for the album Unhalfbricking and joined Fairport subsequently helping to create an electric folk sound beginning with Liege & Lief. His energetic playing of jigs and reels plus his saucy style and vocal prowess came to define the classic Fairport Convention especially after Sandy Denny and Richard Thompson departed. He had hearing issues and went back to acoustic music other than the occasional band reunions (including this 1987 show at the annual Cropredy Festival where he played ” The Hen’s March Through The Midden & The Four Poster Bed”). The studio cut was originally on the 1973 Rosie LP and here really gets moving about the 1:55 mark. He was a heavy smoker and this ultimately took his life in 2016 aged 75 having had a double lung transplant in 2004.\n\n2.Peter Knight – Steeleye Span\n\nBorn in London in 1947, Knight played with the Fairport Convention offshoot band Steeleye Span from 1970 till 1977 then again from 1980 till 2013. He was classically trained at the Royal Academy of Music. Just like Fairport, Steeleye Span have played electrified British traditional folk music with singer Maddy Prior the last remaining original member. This video starts with the song “Robbery With Violins” (about 26 seconds in) which was on the 1973 studio album Parcel Of Rogues. My first exposure to this band was as the support act to Procol Harum that year. I just remember my pal Dan and I being stunned by how good they were especially singing the madrigal “Gaudete”. Knight’s most recent work was as a duo with John Spiers who played concertina in the band Bellowhead.\n\n3.Jim Lea – Slade\n\nBoy when you think of metallic glitter music you don’t usually think of the fiddle, but bassist Jim Lea used it pretty darn effectively on hits like “Run Runaway” and “Coz I Love You”. Born in Wolverhampton, England, Lea started off on violin at the age of 10 apparently inspired by jazz player Stéphane Grappelli. As a bassist he joined the ‘N-Betweens at the age of 16. This band evolved in to Slade who had mostly English success behind the leather lungs of Noddy Holder (editorial comment: it’s pathetic that their original versions of songs like “Cum On Feel The Noize” and “Mama Weer All Crazee Now” weren’t hits here). Lea co-wrote most of Slade’s hits with Holder and did some singing as well. When Holder left Slade in 1992, so too did Lea.\n\n4.Mik Kaminski – Electric Light Orchestra/ELO II/The Orkestra\n\nIt is with ELO that most of us think of the violin in a rock band. Roy Wood and Jeff Lynne of The Move (editorial comment: once again why wasn’t The Move big in the U.S.?) had the idea to create a band around the chugging cello sound of “I Am The Walrus” by The Beatles. They called it The Electric Light Orchestra and released their self-titled debut album in 1971 (No Answer in the U.S.). Wood and Lynne parted soon after with Wood forming Wizzard and Lynne keeping the old name (usually abbreviated as ELO). The third musician to play violin in ELO is the most remembered and longest lasting one – Mik Kaminski. He was born in Yorkshire in 1951 and was trained at the Leeds School Of Music. He joined ELO in 1973. The biggest problem the string players had in ELO was they couldn’t be heard over the rock instruments and it was the discovery of pickups by Barcus-Berry that really changed the ballgame for violinists allowing them to be amplified. This video is for a live 1976 version of the song “Poor Boy (The Greenwood)” which was originally on the 1974 studio album Eldorado. Kaminski is noted for playing a blue violin plus had a 1979 U.K. hit with “Clog Dance” as Violinski.\n\n5.Wilf Gibson – Roll Over Beethoven\n\nEnglish violinist Gibson passed away in 2014 at age 72 after having done session work for many years. His playing can be heard on records by Oasis, Tom Jones, Elton John, etc.. He studied at London’s Royal College Of Music and is best remembered for replacing Steve Woolam in The Electric Light Orchestra in 1972. Woolam had been fired in 1971 after the first album and ultimately killed himself. Gibson played on the LP ELO II (1973) which included the memorable “Roll Over Beethovan” (a Chuck Berry cover with classical overtones). He contributed on a few songs for their next LP (On The Third Day) but was asked to leave when he was apparently unhappy about finances.\n\n6.Duncan Chisholm – Wolfstone\n\nDuncan Chisholm and guitarist Stuart Eaglesham formed Wolfstone in 1989 and they are still leading a version of this Scottish Celtic rock band. “Morag’s Reels” is from the 1994 album Year Of The Dog, their third. Wolfstone uses electric guitars plus drums but also pipes and whistles giving them a more Celtic feel than bands like Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span. His most recent solo recording is the 2018 album Sandwood which is more peaceful instrumentals.\n\n7.Ric Sanders – Fairport Convention/The Albion Band\n\nBassist Ashley Hutchings helped found three of the most important bands in the British traditional folk genre – Fairport Convention, Steeleye Span and The Albion Band. English violinist Sanders, born Dec. 8, 1952, has been a member of two of the three. He played on perhaps the most important Albion Band album Rise Up Like The Sun (1978) then joined Fairport in 1984 where he has rosined his bow since. This track is from the all-instrumental album expletive delighted! in 1986. Though not a vocalist like the elfen Dave Swarbrick who he replaced in Fairport, Sanders is a versatile musician having played with Soft Machine, Rosalie Cunningham, Robert Plant, etc.\n\n8.Robby Steinhardt – Kansas\n\nSteinhardt was born in Chicago (1950), but grew up in Lawrence, Kansas – the adoptive son of the University Of Kansas director of music history. Having studied violin since he was eight, in 1972 he joined the group White Clover that became Kansas. In addition to violin, he was a vocalist (mostly singing the lower parts) and on-stage MC. He left the band in 1982 only to rejoin in 1997 till he left again in 2006. Our video track is from his solo album Not In Kansas Anymore released three months after his passing from pancreatitis in July 2021.\n\n9.Ric Grech – Family/Blind Faith/Traffic\n\nBassist/violinist Grech fought substance abuse during his career which ultimately led to his death in 1990 at age 44. Born in France, he grew up in England where he took up violin as a kid. He joined the group Family in 1965 who in 1968 released their debut LP Music In A Doll’s House – a psychedelic masterstroke produced by Dave Mason. Your young Dentist used to crank up very loudly this track (“Peace Of Mind”) with it’s eerie echoy violin riff (sorry mom and dad). He left after singing “Second Generation Woman” on their second LP (Family Entertainment) to join Eric Clapton’s supergroup Blind Faith. You can hear his melodic violin solo on their “Sea Of Joy” (1969). He was sacked due to substance abuse then joined with drummer Ginger Baker in Air Force and also recorded with a new version of Traffic – mainly Low Spark Of High Heeled Boys (1971). After this he did some session work before he dropped out of music.\n\n10.John Weider – Eric Burdon & The Animals/Family\n\nRic Grech’s replacement in Family was another combination bassist and violin player. Weider was an English musician born in 1947 and stayed in Family till 1971. Prior to that he had moved around a lot before landing in Eric Burdon’s new version of The Animals (1966). Weider’s violin was best used on the single “When I Was Young” (1967) and at the 1967 Monterey Pop Festival on a psychedelic workout around the Stones’ song “Paint It Black”. Since, he has done sessions and dabbled in new-age music.\n\n11.David LaFlamme – It’s A Beautiful Day\n\nBack when your Dentist bought albums based on the cover art, the debut by It’s A Beautiful Day attracted the Broomfield High School me. The song “White Bird” (1969) became the band’s signature song but didn’t crack the U.S. hot 100 then (though cool FM stations like Denver’s KLZ-FM did play it). The sound of the band was notable for the melodic violin playing by singer David LaFlamme (born 1941). Their second album Marrying Maiden (1970) led off with the track “Don & Dewey” which was a band workout to the 1959 Don & Dewey single on Rush records “Stretchin’ Out” with both featuring violin lead. By the way, that same riff also became the song “Wring That Neck (Hard Road)” for Deep Purple on the 1968 LP The Book of Taliesyn. LaFlamme went solo and did chart with an inferior version of “White Bird” in 1976 (#89). David, his wife Linda plus original drummer Val Fuentes are still leading It’s A Beautiful Day at the time of this writing.\n\n12.Don “Sugarcane” Harris – The Mothers Of Invention/Don & Dewey/John Mayall\n\nBack in 1999 Don Harris passed away at age 61 at his LA home. He previously had a long and varied career in music starting with a doowop group (The Squires) that included his future partner Dewey Terry. They formed the duo Don & Dewey next and recorded some notable non-hits that became successful later for others (“Farmer John”, “Justine”, “Big Boy Pete”, etc.). Harris ostensibly got his nickname from Johnny Otis because he was smooth with the ladies. He contributed to albums by John Mayall (USA Union) and Frank Zappa (Hot Rats – check out “Willie The Pimp”). He sang lead and played nasty violin on the old Little Richard song “Directly From My Heart To You” which came out as by The Mothers Of Invention in 1970 (Weasels Ripped My Flesh) though it was an outtake from the Hot Rats LP. He played music off and on after that but reportedly substance abuse got in the way.\n\n13.Vanessa Mae\n\nVanessa-Mae Vanakorn Nicholson was born in Singapore (Oct. 27, 1978) and was adopted at age four by a British father who moved her to London where she eventually studied at the Royal Academy Of Music. Her debut pop album The Violin Player was released in 1995 with production by Mike Batt (The Wombles). She charted three singles from that LP in the U.K., but it was this album track that grabbed your Dentist. She has recorded sporadically over the years with Choreography from 2004 being her most recent album. Since her real father is from Thailand, oddly she decided to represent that country in the 2014 Olympic Games held in Sochi, Russia where she finished 67th or last of all the skiers who completed the Giant Slalom competition.\n\n14.Craig Espie – Skerryvore\n\nIn concert, Skerryvore are the most exciting band I have seen in years. When the twin bagpipers crank it up along with the rest of the band I get goosebumps. Fiddler Craig Espie adds to the mix cranking out some fine jigs and reels. The band is based around Glasgow, Scotland and I feel blessed that they have come to Colorado several times now. Espie was born in Rutherglen, Scotland on Sept. 16, 1983 and joined Skerryvore in 2006. If you can’t see them in concert at least try to grab a copy of their 2020 live album Live Across Scotland which is a good intro to the band.\n\n15.Sharon Corr – The Corrs\n\nWhile girly-pop fans know them for the song “Breathless”, the Irish family-band The Corrs have a lot of skill as Celtic musicians as well playing tin whistle, bodhrán, violin and guitar. Their debut record Forgiven, Not Forgotten (1995) in particular has some wonderful instrumentals including the traditional reel “Toss The Feathers”.\n\n16.Charles O’Connor – Horslips\n\nHorslips might be considered the fathers of the Irish Celtic rock scene that birthed The Corrs. The original band came together in 1970 with multi-instrumentalist Charles O’Connor (born 1948) supplying fiddle for reels and jigs. Their Happy To Meet – Sorry To Part debut album (1973 in the U.S.) was notable for the cover art looking like an octagonal concertina with holes in it. “The High Reel” is a track that my pal DC hipped me to back in college that has great fiddle. They recorded a fun tribute single as Lipstick – “Come Back Beatles” that Beatles fans may want to look for on youtube.\n\n17.Dave Arbus – East Of Eden/The Who\n\nDave Arbus played the outstanding violin solo at the end of The Who’s track “Baba O’Riley” which is about all I knew him for till years later looking him up and discovered he was with the band East Of Eden. They went through many line-ups over the years always playing sort of jazz-rock-progressive sort of music. They did manage one U.K. hit in 1970’s “Jig A Jig” which was more in the Celtic vein. It is for the 1971 Who solo on the LP Who’s Next that Arbus makes our list mainly.\n\n18.John McEuen – The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band\n\nWhile John McEuen might be the best banjo player (at least from my generation), it turns out he plays a pretty mean fiddle as well. Back in 1971 your Dentist as a sophomore at the University Of Colorado picked up the All The Good Times LP which was the follow-up to the breakout album by The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band Uncle Charlie & His Dog Teddy. While it wasn’t as brilliant as that album, it did have some goodies including this incendiary work-out on “Diggy Liggy Lo”, the old Rusty & Doug song that charted country for them in 1961. I’m not sure if McEuen played fiddle on other NGDB tracks, but this was all it took to make the list. Born in 1945 in Oakland, he has been a solo artist since leaving The Dirt Band in 2017.\n\n19.Doug Kershaw\n\nYou simply can’t do a fiddle list and omit the Ragin’ Cajun (and he is the original with that name buddy; don’t mix him up with any pretenders). He was born Jan. 24, 1936 in Louisiana and had a duo for a time with his brother Rusty. His song “Louisiana Man” is classic cajun music which is the sound of the French-speaking Acadians from that part of the U.S. along with zydeco. You get your fiddle and your accordian and set your feet to movin’. He went solo with his first album The Cajun Way in 1969. His flamboyant style included holding his fiddle low instead of tucking it under his chin.\n\n20.Haylie Ecker – Bond\n\nProducers Mike Batt and Mel Bush hit upon the idea of selling rocked-up classics by putting attractive female string players from Australia and the U.K. in tight costumes – and it worked. Their 2000 debut album Born stormed the charts worldwide (and sold a copy to your Dentist as well). The Mike Batt remix of “Victory” was my fave track on that record. Ecker (born 1975 in Australia), was the lead violin player till 2008 when she decided to quit and start a family. The current lead violinist is former viola player Tania Davis also from Australia. Their most recent studio album is Play from 2011.\n\n21.Darryl Way – Curved Air\n\nCurved Air are a progressive-folk-rock band that have been going off and on since 1970. Violinist Way is no longer with them. While not a big fan of them, I have to admit a fondness for Way’s workout a la Vivaldi on the song of that name from their debut Air Conditioning. Englishman Way was in and out of the band over the years along with contributing to albums by Jethro Tull and his own band Darryl Way’s Wolf. He was born in England in 1948.\n\n22.Gordon Burt – Runaway Express/Chuck Pyle\n\nBy now looking at this list it should be obvious how much your Dentist loves jigs and reels. Jim and Salli Ratts’ band Runaway Express put out a fabulous album in 1993 (Port Of Mystery) that included this excellent lively lilt. The jaunty fiddle that starts things off is by local string-man extraordinaire (and Jeffco music teacher) Gordon Burt who has seemingly appeared on every Colorado musician’s album (Jon Chandler, Southern Exposure, Dakota Blonde, etc.). My pal the retired Dr. Eddie from Buena Vista is the guy I can thank for turning me on to this guy. Years ago we went to a BV coffee shop to see Chuck Pyle ‘the zen cowboy’ (now deceased) and I was amazed at how good his fiddle accompanist Gordon Burt was. Pyle was good, but Burt was amazing. No doubt every corner of the U.S. has unsung skilled musicians that fly under the radar and entertain us just for the fun of playing music.\n\n23.Papa John Creach – Jefferson Airplane/Jefferson Starship/Hot Tuna\n\nBeaver Falls, Pennsylvania was the birthplace of quarterback Joe Namath and an itinerant fiddler named John Creach (1917). Early on he performed with people as diverse as Nat King Cole, Big Joe Turner and Louis Armstrong. During the hippy era he became friends with Joey Covington who replaced Spencer Dryden on drums with the Jefferson Airplane. Creach ended up joining the band and played with the offshoot acts Hot Tuna and The Dinosaurs. He was on several albums of theirs including the highly successful 1975 Red Octopus LP for The Jefferson Starship. He left for a time then returned in 1992 to play his fiddle till he passed in 1994.\n\n24.Lindsey Stirling\n\nStirling has made the violin hip with her wild playing and collaborations with pop stars that have sold millions. While most know her from electro-pop tracks like “Shatter Me” and “Crystallize”, a song like this (originally on her 2017 studio CD Warmer In The Winter) shows that she can play other genres. She was born in Santa Ana, CA in 1986 and attended BYU. She has been featured in LDS promos and shuns alcohol.\n\n25.Andy Stein – Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen\n\nWhile Stein has been composing film scores and appearing on the radio show A Prairie Home Companion, he is probably best known as a founding member of Commander Cody & His Lost Planet Airmen. They released their first album Lost In The Ozone in 1971 which had elements of rock, western swing, blues and just about everything else that was fun. Stein is from New York and is skilled in every area frankly from jazz to classical while playing violin and sax. His aunt was the renowned viola player Lillian Fuchs.\n\n26.Charlie Daniels – The Charlie Daniels Band\n\nLet’s go next with Charlie Daniels mainly because you can’t leave out the person you think of when you mention the fiddle in southern rock and outlaw country. He was born in North Carolina on Oct. 28, 1936 and passed in 2020 at 73. His first hit (the 1973 single “Uneasy Rider”) portrayed him as a member of the counterculture even though he looked like a redneck. His politics would change over his life. The song most identified with him is the #3 hit “The Devil Went Down To Georgia” from 1979 about a fiddle contest between the Devil and a young man named Johnny. The video is of perhaps the definitive fiddle song, “Orange Blossom Special”, with Daniels’ version appearing on the 1974 LP Fire On The Mountain.\n\n27.Eddie Jobson – Roxy Music/King Crimson/Frank Zappa/U.K./Jethro Tull\n\nIf you don’t have the patience to sit through Jobson’s wonderful keyboards before he picks up the violin, you can cut to 2:55. This video shows the virtuosity of Jethro Tull during the time of A but especially Eddie Jobson. He was born April 28, 1955 in England. As can be seen he has played violin and keys in a number of musical acts. In addition to his band work he has also scored music for films and TV.\n\n28.Ashley MacIsaac\n\nBorn Feb. 24, 1975 in Nova Scotia, MacIsaac style has been described as “genre-bending” which may turn off some folks but who cares? He plays intriguing fiddle music. An interesting fact about his playing is that he uses a fiddle strung for a right-hander but plays left-handed. The closest he came to having an actual hit was the 1995 single “Sleepy Maggie” (from the album Hi™ How Are You Today?) with dance rhythms and vocals by Mary Jane Lamond. He played at the opening ceremonies of the 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics.\n\n29.Richard Greene – Seatrain\n\nRichard Greene played violin with a number of bands including those of Bill Monroe, Jim Kweskin and David Lindley. He was on the first few albums by Seatrain including two on Capitol that were produced by George Martin. He was born Nov. 9, 1942 in L.A. and joined the band that would become Seatrain but was called Blues Project for 1968’s Planned Obsolescence LP. Several members stayed with the band which did become Seatrain while several others formed Blood, Sweat & Tears (it’s confusing – read online if you care).\n\n30.Steve Wickham – The Waterboys/In Tua Nua\n\nHaving expanded this to 30 from the original 25 I figured I would get everyone in yet here we are and I haven’t included Jerry Goodman of The Flock/Mahavishnu Orchestra, Jean-Luc Ponty, David Cross (King Crimson), Mark O’Connor, Ricky Scaggs, on and on. Let’s end with a band I had literally given up on before they became a more Irish-folk band with prominent fiddle. I quit on them after “The Whole Of The Moon” (1985 album This Is The Sea) and was chastised by another Dentist friend (Jack A – thanks for the heads up) for not including these guys. Steve Wickham supplied the fiddle to the U2 song “Sunday Bloody Sunday” on their 1983 album War. He was a founder of In Tua Nua and his fiddle is prominent on their cover of the Jefferson Airplane song “Somebody To Love”. He left that band in 1985 and joined The Waterboys putting his stamp firmly on the 1988 album Fisherman’s Blues. The song I have included is from the 1990 Room To Roam disc.\n\nYour rock n roll dentist admits to dabbling in the guitar back in the day with my pal Mr. D on drums. We may not have been very good but we made enough noise to annoy the neighbors (sorry Cheryl Watkins). We also had alot of fun while destroying our hearing. Today I doubt that kids have the same itch to pick up a 6-string to make music like us Baby Boomers did (thanks in no small part to The Beatles). The guitar itself is a stringed instrument that goes back in antiquity, but it was the addition of electomagnetic pickups making them louder that got us kids revved up. Your’s truly started playing a Harmony acoustic then added a Vox Buckingham amp with a Fender Telecaster to up the volume (sorry mom and dad) then quickly traded that for a Gibson SG that looked way more rock and roll.\n\nWell, this list is of my personal fave guitarists (and no the dude who is pictured in the intro is not one of them but he at least used to have a lot of hair – not any more I fear). Don’t start screaming that I left out the best players (you can add your own via a comment at the end). If I like their sound they are in. My fave players in many cases played more lyrical lead parts rather than racing up and down the fretboard so don’t look for Eddie Van Halen or Joe Satriani for instance. The other kind of sounds I love are either three-chord monkey-beat riffs or nasty blues licks.\n\n1.Stevie Ray Vaughan\n\nAug. 27, 1990 SRV was cut down at age 35 when the helicopter he was in crashed in foggy conditions after a show in Wisconsin leaving a huge void in my musical arsenal. The man could flat out pick it and did so while playing the nasty rockin’ blues I love. When your Dentist saw him with Joe Cocker at Fiddler’s Green here in Colorado, I could have sworn there were two guitarists on stage. He did things with a guitar that I could have only dreamed about. His classic axe was a Fender Stratocaster with his fave being an amalgam of a 1963 body with a 1962 neck and 1959 pickups. He was born in Dallas Oct. 3, 1954 and moved to Austin, Texas where he is best known for fronting Double Trouble. That band (Chris Layton on drums with Tommy Shannon on bass then later Reese Wynans on piano) recorded four essential studio albums during SRV’s lifetime.\n\n2.The Wrecking Crew Guitarists (Tommy Tedesco, Louie Shelton, Al Casey, Glen Campbell, Gerry McGee, Billy Strange, etc.)\n\nIt was hard to know how to include these folks other than to lump them all together. As ’60s kids we all pictured Mike Nesmith playing the “Last Train To Clarksville” lick or David Costell the flamenco runs on “Sure Gonna Miss Her”. When those songs became classics it was revealed that in reality Louie Shelton played the Monkees song and Tommy Tedesco that complex Gary Lewis & The Playboys guitar run. Many likely don’t care who played on those songs, they just like the records. It was, however, the skill of those session guys at quickly learning a song while adding their personal touches that made those records so memorable. The excellent 2008 Denny Tedesco documentary about those players (The Wrecking Crew) went a long way to gaining those folks their due and is essential viewing if you want to know how the records were created. We may never remember who played on the Tijuana Brass or the Marketts records, but we still love to hear them. Sadly very few of them are still alive. As this is written Louie Shelton is still alive and made an interesting video on how the Monkees’ lead part came about.\n\n3.Steve Hackett\n\nMy first introduction to Steve Hackett was on the 1971 Genesis album Nursery Cryme when my buddy Mr. D played it for me (no doubt while sitting in his basement noshing on Yellow Zingers and Bubble-Up). Hackett was born in London Feb. 12, 1950 and cites disparate influences like Bach, The Beatles, Hendrix and the blues. During the classic progressive rock era of Genesis Steve created some outstanding guitar parts plus was the one who suggested they add mellotron to the band. He left in 1977 just before Genesis became a pop music behemoth thanks to Phil Collins. While Hackett likely missed out on a bunch of money, I salute him for staying true to prog rock with some excellent solo albums. In concert he also revisits his old music in Genesis while still playing his 1957 gold Gibson Les Paul. This video starts off with some crazy fretwork but then about a minute and a half in gets down to the business of playing the closer “Los Endos” from the 1976 Genesis album A Trick Of The Tail. Mr. Hackett’s playing even won over my non-prog wife while on the 2019 On The Blue Cruise. She was stunned by his powerful playing (plus he was a very quiet-spoken pleasant man who signed autographs and posed with us).\n\n4.George Harrison\n\nThe quiet Beatle (not really – just sardonic), George could play straight rock and roll licks and also some beautifully melodic leads. He passed way too young, living from Feb. 25, 1943 to Nov. 29, 2001 (don’t smoke, ever!). He was born in Liverpool. He had a fortuitous moment meeting Paul McCartney on the bus to school. He was invited to join John Lennon and Paul’s band The Quarrymen in 1958 as he knew how to play the instrumental “Raunchy”. He took some time to come in to his own in The Beatles but at the end contributed some great songs including “Here Comes The Sun” with its bright acoustic guitar runs. Engineer Geoff Emerick said in his Beatles bio that it would take George a long time to master his leads (which apparently annoyed Emerick), but if true who cares as they were great. After the Fabs broke up, he turned more and more to playing slide guitar on his solo records. George could still rock as was evident in the 1985 video he, Dave Edmunds, Ringo, etc. did to honor Carl Perkins (Blue Suede Shoes: A Rockabilly Session) – check it out!\n\n5.Scotty Moore\n\nWinfield ‘Scotty’ Moore III stood quietly behind Elvis Presley and created the template that so many rockabilly guitarists have copied ever since. He was born in Gadsden, Tennessee Dec. 27, 1931 and passed away in Nashville June 28, 2016. When producer and Sun Records owner Sam Phillips invited Scotty and Bill Black on bass (later dubbed ‘The Blue Moon Boys’) to back Elvis in 1954, the tide of rock and roll picked up steam. There were no rules as it was all brand new and many credit Moore’s work on “Jailhouse Rock” as the first to use power chords. For “That’s All Right Mama” (the first Elvis record) he used an echo sound that came to be called ‘slapback’ and came to define that style – rockabilly. Elvis’ manager Colonel Tom Parker allegedly worked to ease Moore out of the picture and his last lead for a Presley record was 1962 – “(You’re The) Devil in Disguise”. He did play with Elvis one last time for the TV show ’68 Comeback Special. During his heyday he used several Gibson guitars including a ES-295 and a Super 400.\n\n6.Chuck Berry\n\nEvery teen band of kids from my generation when they would get together would start by jamming on Chuck Berry songs as his licks became pretty much universal. He was born and died in Missouri Oct. 18, 1926 to March 18, 2017. Berry was nearing thirty when he finally became a star with “Maybelline” in 1955 on Chess. He had been playing a mix of blues and country plus R&B and this melded in to the sound we all know by him. For a great many of his touring years he wouldn’t bother to rehearse with the local band who backed him as he assumed they all knew his songs which led to hit and miss live shows. “Sweet Little Sixteen”, “Johnny B Goode”, Roll Over Beethoven”, on and on – all classics that he wrote (though it is sad that the awful “My Ding A Ling” was his only #1). If you watch this video you get a hint of his other contribution to guitarists – the look. He had a cocky swagger about him and just knew how to look cool while playing his red Gibson ES-350T.\n\n7.Dave Edmunds\n\nWell if you know me at all you are aware that my fave band was The Beatles and my fave solo artist was Dave Edmunds so it isn’t a surprise to see him here. He played that three chord monkey-beat Chuck Berry-style rock and roll I loved, but the man could flat out fly on the strings too. This cover of the 1942 classical song “Sabre Dance” by Aram Khachaturian was a #5 hit in the U.K. in 1968 for his band Love Sculpture. They lasted from 1966 to 1970 when he had his first big solo hit with “I Hear You Knocking”. He was born in Cardiff, Wales April 15, 1944. He loved the sound of old rock records and worked to duplicate what he heard on early hits like “Baby I Love You” and “Born To Be With You”. He then formed Rockpile with Nick Lowe and put out a succession of great records with he or Nick listed as the primary player. After they broke up he continued having hits with his own band plus had some success as a producer (Foghat, The Stray Cats). The rockabilly licks are what appealed to me the most, but his instrumental work on “Farandole” and “The Stumble” is equally nifty.\n\n8.Jeff Beck\n\nHis sound is as distinctive as any guitarist if hard to describe – almost a crying but heavy sound. He was born June 24, 1944 in Surrey, England and passed Jan. 10, 2023 and seemed to have either a black Fender Stratocaster or a motorcycle in his hands. My first exposure to him was on the Yardbirds records I bought back in the day “Shapes Of Things” and “Over Under Sideways Down”. He followed a pretty tough act in that band, Eric Clapton who left in early 1965. In 1966 while still a member of that band, he and future Yardbird Jimmy Page recorded this as a side project along with Keith Moon of The Who on drums. His first album with The Jeff Beck Group (Truth 1968 with Rod Stewart on vocals) is essential and points the way to the similarly themed Led Zeppelin. After that band folded he put together Beck, Bogart and Appice with Vanilla Fudge alumni before going in to the studio with producer George Martin (The Beatles) to record another classic Blow By Blow (1975). His jazz instrumental style dominated from then on but he also did some notable side projects including his tribute to Gene Vincent’s guitarist Cliff Gallup on the excellent 1993 album Crazy Legs. After SRV I think he is the best guitarist I have seen live.\n\n9.David Gilmour\n\nGilmour is the opposite of flash preferring to make his bluey vibrato solos speak or even cry on his black Fender Strat. Check out the video I have included with a great solo starting about the 1:45 point. Of course you know him from Pink Floyd mainly. He was asked to replace the erratic Syd Barrett in that band starting at the tail end of 1967. Roger Waters slowly took more and more control of the music of Pink Floyd so when he left it was assumed they would either languish or break up. That Gilmour led them after that through great albums like A Momentary Lapse Of Reason and The Division Bell shows his talent. He is an Englishman born in Cambridge March 6, 1946.\n\n10.Mick Ronson\n\nOnly true ’70s glam fans know the late Mick Ronson but he was the heart of David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust era and the engine of The Ian Hunter Band. Ronson didn’t have much success in music till hooking up with Bowie’s backing band The Hype in 1970. They morphed in to The Spiders From Mars for the 1972-3 Bowie era that saw him become a superstar. This video of the Aladdin Sane track “The Jean Genie” from 1973 finds Ronson looking every inch the blonde guitar god. Ronson came in at the very end of Mott The Hoople for the single “Saturday Gigs” (1974) then stayed with Ian Hunter in to his solo years. His swan song with Hunter was the 1989 YUI Orta LP that included the criminally overlooked “Big Time”. He died in London on April 29, 1993 at age 46 of liver cancer.\n\n11.Johnny Winter\n\nAfter SRV and Jeff Beck, Johnny Winter was the most technically skilled guitarist I ever saw in concert. Rail thin with long white hair and later covered in tattoos, he had a look nobody else had. He and his brother Edgar were born albinos which made them as white as anyone you have ever seen plus nearly blind. John Dawson Winter III was born in Beaumont, Texas Feb. 23, 1944 and passed away July 16, 2014 in Switzerland. When I bought his first self-titled Columbia record in 1969 he was backed on drums by Uncle John Turner and future SRV sideman Tommy Shannon on bass doing amped up blues. In 1970 he hooked up with the remnants of The McCoys (“Hang On Sloopy”) and found more success as Johnny Winter And doing rock and roll (“Rock And Roll Hoochie Koo”). He fell in to heroin addiction which he kicked but he would continue to have bouts of drug use that affected him over the years. His later career saw him record some fine blues albums on Alligator including Guitar Slinger in 1984. He is best known for playing the Gibson Firebird guitar.\n\n12.Billy F. Gibbons\n\nAnother red-hot Texas blues man is William Frederick Gibbons best known for his work in ZZ Top. He is a Houston native born Dec. 16, 1949. Billy started out his recording career as leader of the 1966-69 psychedelic band The Moving Sidewalks. Later in ’69 he hooked up with Dusty Hill (bass) and Frank Beard (drums) to form ZZ Top. They were always rooted in the blues but Gibbons didn’t grow the crazy beard till the band moved from London Records to Warner Brothers in 1979 (Deguello). Their high point was the trio of bluesy hard rock albums Eliminator, Afterburner and Recycler (1983 to 1990). After moving to RCA they took on a more straight blues style. Gibbons has put out some pretty darn good solo albums as well that don’t sound too far away from ZZ Top (most recently Hardware in 2021). He has played a number of different guitars notably ‘Pearly Gates’ a 1959 Gibson Les Paul Standard.\n\n13.Justin Hayward\n\nWhen you think of the music of The Moody Blues the guitar isn’t what comes to mind, yet Justin Hayward has played some great guitar over their career including “The Story In Your Eyes” from Every Good Boy Deserves Favour (1971). His red Gibson 335 electric turns up on most of their records, but it is the slashing acoustic that dominates “Question” from A Question Of Balance (1970). Born Oct. 14, 1946 in England, Hayward wrote a good many of their hits while possessing one of the best singing voices in progressive rock.\n\n14.Duane Eddy\n\nWho owns a riff? The opening guitar lick on Eddy’s first hit “Moovin’ N’ Groovin” (#72 in 1958) was also the intro to the Chuck Berry song “Brown Eyed Handsome Man” (1956). That same riff opened the Beach Boys record “Surfin’ U.S.A.” in 1963. At any rate, Duane Eddy charted records from then till 1964 though his last big hit was “(Dance with the) Guitar Man” (#12 in 1962). Duane Eddy was born in Corning, NY April 26, 1938 and grew up mainly in Arizona where he linked up with producer Lee Hazelwood. Eddy’s style was referred to as ‘twang’ rocking mainly on the low strings of his 1957 Chet Atkins Gretsch 6120 guitar. “Rebel-Rouser”, “Peter Gunne”, “Forty Miles Of Bad Road” – these were all hits that inspired a lot of kids to take up the 6-string. It is a bit of a crime that oldies radio rarely plays his hits today.\n\n15.Keith Richards\n\nWhile he has been the butt of jokes about how he has outlived all expectactions having abused his body with booze and drugs, the man is a human catalog of guitar riffs. Is Mick Mick the Rolling Stone without Keith? No way. Having met him briefly back in 1989 or so, skull ring and all he seemed like a very nice likeable guy – go figure. Of course he has been a Rolling Stone since 1962, a band that fittingly started their recording career with a Chuck Berry cover (“Come On” 1963) since Keith says Berry was a major influence on him. I have to salute him for putting together a lasting tribute to Berry with the 1987 doc Chuck Berry Hail! Hail! Rock ‘n’ Roll.\n\n16.Angus Young\n\nAngus is known as an Aussie yet he was actually born in Glasgow, Scotland March 31, 1955 (his family moved to Sydney in 1963). In 1973 he (with his brother Malcolm on rhythm guitar) started ACDC. Like most of the U.S., I didn’t really notice their brand of hard rock till the 1979 record Highway To Hell. When singer Bon Scott died after that it seemed like curtains yet they have become one of the biggest bands in the world thanks to the addition of Brian Johnson on vocals. Indeed the Back In Black LP at 50 million copies and counting is second to only Thriller by Michael Jackson as the biggest selling record worldwide. Angus’ guitar looks a lot like what I played which I always thought was cool. I assume he plays it for the same reason I did and that is because it is light – something important to him as he is a whirling dervish on stage in his school-boy outfit while pumping out hot guitar licks. Stoopid rock and roll to the max – gotta love it.\n\n17.Pete Townshend\n\nHere is another guitarist that doesn’t know how to stand stock-still on stage and at the same time whirling his arm in a circle to crash down on the strings in a bloody collision. Again, good for him! Rock and roll is all about energy. As the driving force of The Who he isn’t about technical excellence – that was up to bassist John Entwistle and drummer Keith Moon. Pete was mostly about slashing power chords (and mashing his guitar in to pieces back in the band’s early days). He was born in London May 19, 1945 and joined The Detours as rhythm guitar to Roger Daltrey’s lead. Needless to say eventually Daltrey eschewed the guitar for a microphone and Townshend took over on sole six-string. The Who was then born in 1964 (briefly The High Numbers) and became one of the most important British Invasion bands though they would take awhile to catch on in the U.S. (their first top 20 hit here was “I Can See For Miles” in 1967 at #9). The rock opera Tommy (1969) and Who’s Next (1971) cemented them as superstars. Townshend has also carved out a decent solo career with hits like “Let My Love Open The Door” (1980) and “Face The Face” (1985).\n\n18.Paul Simon\n\nWell here is a complete 180 from all the guitarists we has listed so far, but Paul Simon is a superb folk guitar player. He and Art Garfunkel started out as a rockin’ duo – Tom & Jerry and had a hit with “Hey Schoolgirl” in January 1958 (#49). It would be a few weeks shy of eight years till they returned to the charts as Simon & Garfunkel with the song “The Sounds Of Silence”, #1 in January 1966. By then their style was folk with Simon composing most of the songs while playing acoustic guitar and harmonizing with Artie. After they split in 1970 Simon started a successful solo career while having occasional reunions with Garfunkel (he even supplied guitar and vocals to Art’s first three solo LPs). Paul Simon was born in Newark, N.J. Oct. 13, 1941 but mostly grew up in Queens, NY. If producer Tom Wilson hadn’t added electric instrumentation in 1965 to the acoustic folk song “The Sounds Of Silence” from the 1964 LP Wednesday Morning, 3 A.M. one has to wonder if we would ever have heard of Paul Simon. The answer is probably yes as he had too much music in him to stay hidden.\n\n19.Dave Davies\n\nDave is the forgotten Davies brother playing the hot guitar licks on his brother Ray’s brilliant Kinks records. Born in London Feb. 3, 1947 he is three years young than Ray. Dave formed a band with Pete Quaife on bass followed by Ray soon after – The Ray Davies Quartet, then The Ravens and finally The Kinks (with Mick Avory on drums). It was their single “You Really Got Me” that put them firmly in the middle of the British Invasion of the U.S. back in 1964 (#7). Songs like “All Day & All Of The Night” and “Tired Of Waiting” continued the power chord driven hit trend till Ray started writing more topical songs like “Sunny Afternoon” and “Waterloo Sunset” that relied less on the guitar. Dave had his own hits such as “Death Of A Clown” and “Susannah’s Still Alive” but it was the The Kinks as sung by Ray that was his main musical outlet. It was the late ’70s and the early ’80s that saw Dave get to really rock again for the Arista label records like “Live Life” and the live LP One For The Road. After he had a stroke in 2004 it was iffy whether he would play guitar again, but he regained that ability over time. Sadly The Kinks never have reunited after their split in 1994. Dave has played a number of guitars over the years with one of the most memorable being a Gibson Flying V.\n\n20.Eric Clapton\n\nYour blogger has to admit the great blues guitarist Eric Clapton would be far higher on this list had he not put out horrid records like “I Shot The Sheriff” and “Wonderful Tonight”. Of course they were hits so what do I know? We just saw him in concert last night at Ball Arena in Denver and while he can still play the blues like very few others can, I can’t say I liked to show much as he had zero stage presence plus didn’t rock out as much as I wanted (where was “After Midnight”,”Badge”, “Let It Rain”, “Sunshine Of Your Love”, etc.?). In fairness we had seen Rod Stewart a few weeks before this show and that man can really put on a hugely entertaining evening. Clapton was born March 30, 1945 in Surrey and started playing guitar as a young teen. He was a bit of a musical nomad jumping around quite a bit. His first taste of success was with The Yardbirds starting in 1963, but quite early in 1965 when they started moving away from the blues he loved. In John Mayall & The Bluesbreakers he recorded the classic ‘Beano’ album (so named because of the cartoon on the cover that Clapton is holding). In July of 1966 he, bassist Jack Bruce and drummer Ginger Baker formed Cream – one of the first supergroups. Over four classic albums they conquered the world in the late ’60s. Next up was a one and done as Blind Faith (1969) and then as Derek & The Dominos (1970) with the hit “Layla”. His heroin use got in the way for a time till he cleaned up and went on a hit-making path in the mid to late ’70s (far removed from the blues). Since then he has returned to the blues at times which are the records of his that your Dentist has bought (notably the 2004 CD Sessions for Robert Johnson. For a time he was considered the best guitarist going until…\n\n21.Jimi Hendrix\n\nJames Marshall Hendrix was a mercurial shooting star in his all too brief life Nov. 27, 1942 to Sept. 18, 1970). He was actually named Johnny Allen Hendrix for the first four years of his life when he was born in Seattle. He always wanted a guitar and finally got a cheap acoustic in 1958 which he practiced all the time. Eventually he got a red Danelectro and while he was in the Army his playing caught the attention of another GI Billy Cox who joined him on bass. After he was discharged in 1962 he learned how to pick the strings with his teeth. He moved around quite a bit till getting the chance to back The Isley Brothers on a record in 1964. The following year he was backing Little Richard and then in 1966 he formed his own band in Greenwich Village – Jimmy James & The Blue Flames (with future Spirit guitarist Randy California). Eventually he came to the attention of former Animals bassist Chas Chandler who brought him to England where he added Mitch Mitchell on drums and Noel Redding on bass to form The Jimi Hendrix Experience in October of ’66. Success came pretty quickly with “Hey Joe” then “Foxey Lady”, “Purple Haze”, etc. – a sound few had ever heard before (when he jammed with Clapton the first time, Eric reported walked off early in disbelief at his talent). Jimi burned up the U.S. literally at the Monterey Pop Festival in June of 1967 when he set fire to his Fender Strat guitar at the end of his set. During his career he only released three studio albums and one live set, but after his death there have been at least twelve more studio records and a bunch of live ones. My pal Chuck Davis always tried to convince me of Jimi’s genius, but his gimmickry always turned me off. Over time, however, I have come to see that Hendrix was a true innovator and one heck of a player.\n\n22.Jimmy Page\n\nHe was the third superstar guitarist with The Yardbirds during their Little Games era (1967). Born in Middlesex, England January 9, 1944, his music career started with him as a session guitarist. Starting in 1963 he played guitar on many of the British Invasion records such as Petula Clark’s “Downtown” and Donovan’s “Sunshine Superman”. After the breakup of The Yardbirds, it was with Led Zeppelin from 1968 to 1980 that he made his name. Since then he has collaborated with David Coverdale and for a time reunited with Led Zep singer Robert Plant. In 2000 he and The Black Crowes released a nifty live double album Live At The Greek of mostly Zeppelin covers.\n\n23.Roger McGuinn\n\nJames Joseph McGuinn III was born in Chicago July 13, 1942 (he changed his first name to Roger in 1967). His jangling 12-string guitar sound with The Byrds helped define a whole genre called folk-rock. In the late ’50s and early ’60s he worked as a sideman for acts like Judy Collins, The Limeliters and Bobby Darin. Reportedly it was seeing George Harrison playing a 12-string Rickenbacker electric guitar that inspired McGuinn to buy one and think about performing it on folk songs. He brought banjo picking and later Coltrane-influenced jazz runs to his lead parts. Starting in 1964 with David Crosby, Gene Clark, Chris Hillman and Michael Clark, he created great music like “Mr. Tambourine Man”, “Turn Turn Turn” and “Eight Miles High”. McGuinn was the only original member left when they disbanded in 1973 having morphed in to a country-rock band. Since then there have been solo albums, partial reunions and a return to folk with The Folk Den.\n\n24.Nokie Edwards\n\nThe Ventures continue as one of the most known bands in guitar-based instrumenal music today even though none of the members from their ’60s hey-day are alive. When they debuted on the charts in 1960 with “Walk Don’t Run” the lead part was played by Bob Bogle and the bassist was Nole (Nokie) Edwards. He had previously recorded in Tacoma, WA as the guitarist with The Marksmen. He and Bogle swapped instruments fairly soon and Nokie became the lead guitarist with The Ventures. In this live clip from Japan (where they were mega-stars), Edwards in the taller guitarist in the middle playing the speedy lead parts. I still love to listen to their classic LPs like Knock Me Out!, Where The Action Is and Guitar Freakout that I bought as a youngster. Over the years he came and went from The Ventures only to rejoin several times. He toured with them till 2012. Nokie lived from May 9, 1935 till March 12, 2018, long enough to get inducted belatedly with his band in 2008 in to the R & R Hall Of Fame.\n\n25.Martin Barre\n\nWell it was hard to leave out Eddie Angel from Los Straitjackets or Frank Zappa, Robert Fripp, Brian May, Richie Blackmore, Mark Knoepfler and Mike Campbell, but let’s settle on the lead player with Jethro Tull – Martin Barre as our #25. Once again, when you think of Tull you do not think of guitar, but rather Ian Anderson’s distinctive use of flute. If you listen to their records, however, Martin Barre over the years has contributed some outstanding guitar licks to songs like “Aqualung”, “Locomotive Breath” and “To Cry You A Song”. Martin Lancelot Barre was born Nov. 17, 1946 in Birmingham, England. He replaced Mick Abrahams who left after the first Jethro Tull album to form Blodwyn Pig. Martin was with Tull from the album Stand Up (1969) till 2012. He has been sorely missed from Jethro Tull and it is inexcusable that Anderson saw fit to exclude him when the excellent 2022 album The Zealot Gene was recorded.\n\nYour Dentist loves horrible music. As a parent, there is little better than tormenting your cherished offspring by playing them a really terrible song as payback for the hours of lost sleep and diaper changes. Every Christmas my kids Brenna and Hilary were subjected to Jimmy Jenson (The Swinging Swede) and his song “Walkin’ In My Winter Underwear” – and they could do nothing about it! I think my love of novelty records goes back to Kohl Elementary School days when my old pal Rick Steele would play records like Robert Preston’s “Chicken Fat”. In the U.S. those sort of records haven’t totally died out, but they seem to be more popular in places like the U.K. where Christmas records such as Bob The Builder’s 2000 #1 “Can We Fix It” chart more readily. For my 100th post (whew!) lets grab 25 of these records – some trying to be funny while other in a serious vein. This list won’t include more modern oddness like Ylvis – “The Fox (What Does The Fox Say?)”, “Baby Shark” by Pinkfong or Psy – “Gangnam Style” so feel free to seek those out on your own. There are so many of these that somewhere down the road we may do another.\n\n1.”Weird Al” Yankovic – Smells Like Nirvana\n\nYou really have to start a list like this with the man who has single-handedly kept novelty music alive for over 40 years with his clever song parodies that are at once funny and catchy. You could include his song “Eat It” from 1984 (a #12 hit) or “Like A Surgeon” from the following year (#47), but let’s go with his take-off on Nirvana’s “Smells Like Teen Spirit” which hit #35 in 1992. It has an awesome video that directly parodies Nirvana’s so it helps if you have watched it first to get the jokes. Raised in California, Al started out on the accordion and got an early boost from So-Cal syndicated radio host Dr. Demento. Al’s cult classic movie UHF from 1989 has supplied our family with several meaningful quotes such as “red snapper – very tasty” and “badgers, badgers – we don’t need no stinkin’ badgers”.\n\n2.Ray Stevens – Ahab, The Arab\n\nA novelty list like this also demands the original king of comedic rock/country records Harold Ray Ragsdale – Ray Stevens. Born in Clarksdale, Georgia in 1939 (20 years older then Weird Al), he has had success on the U.S. singles chart since 1960’s “Jeremiah Peabody’s Polyunsaturated Quick-Dissolving Fast-Acting Pleasant-Tasting Green and Purple Pills” which went to #35 – quite a mouthful for DJs of the time. His last single to chart was on the 2002 country charts with “Osama – Yo’ Mama” at #48. In between he has had “The Streak”, “Guitarzan” plus a clucking chickens version of “In The Mood” not to mention “Ahab, The Arab” at #5 in 1962.\n\n3.Rolf Harris – Tie Me Kangaroo Down, Sport\n\nA 1963 novelty about kangaroos, koalas, etc., this #3 U.S. hit (recorded by producer George Martin) was a remake of his 1960 original that had been a U.K. and Australian hit. The song inspired a short-lived craze to buy 2 by 3 foot pieces of flexible hardboard (wobble boards) that were shaken to achieve the weird noise that accompanies the record. Harris was born in 1930 (in Australia) and was successful till his career came crashing down when he was convicted in 2014 of inappropriate sexual contact with several teenaged girls over many years.\n\n4.Senor Wences – ‘S-All Right! ‘S-All Right!\n\nIf you know Senor Wences then you are dating yourself as he appeared 48 times on Ed Sullivan’s Sunday night show in the ’50s and ’60s. Apparently he also had a return in the ’70s on The Muppet Show, but your Dentist saw him on Sullivan earlier. His bits included Johnny with a face drawn on his hand and a small wig doing falsetto ventriloquism (“is good”) and Pedro who was in a box and growled “‘s-all right, close ‘ee door”. Born in Spain, Wenceslao Moreno Centeno lived from April 17, 1896 till April 20, 1999. While it didn’t chart, he put out a cheesy cha-cha record on Joy in 1959 that included several of his catch-phrases interspersed.\n\n5.Mrs. Miller – Downtown\n\nIn 1966 Mrs. Miller butchered Petula Clark’s #1 hit “Downtown” to #82 on the U.S. charts. From Joplin, Missouri, she was born Elva Connes and lived from October 5, 1907 till June 28, 1997. She was discovered by DJ Gary Owens (from Denver’s KIMN and later Rowen & Martin’s Laugh-In). Her first album was Mrs. Miller’s Greatest Hits and featured her warbling confused-tempo versions of modern hits. As she went from being an earnest amateur to a scripted overly-aware comic singer, it became less fun and she faded after a few albums. She did seem like a sweet old granny though she was only in her late 50s at the time.\n\n6.Sam Chalpin – Dominique\n\nSam Chalpin’s horrid vocal stylings made Mrs. Miller sound like Celine Dion – which is why your Dentist loves him. The Atco LP My Father The Pop Singer couldn’t have sold too many copies, but I proudly have it on my record shelf. Since it came out in 1966, its obvious that the folks behind this monstrosity were inspired by Mrs. Miller’s success. Ed Chalpin owned a New York recording studio – Studio 76 and brought in his Yiddish father who was a Cantor to record modern songs such as the Singing Nun hit “Dominique”. While Ed was apparently exploitive of his father, you can’t help but smile at the results and hope that William Hung heard this record before recording his equally horrid version of “She Bangs” in 2004.\n\n7.The Ran-Dells – Martian Hop\n\nThis record sounds way earlier than a fall of 1963 release realizing that in just a few months we would be consumed by Beatlemania. It hit #16 on the U.S. charts. This one-hit-wonder group was from Wildwood, New Jersey and consisted of Robert and Steven Rappaport plus their cousin John Spirt. An electronic sound was added as a sample from the cut “Moon Maid” on the album Electronic Music by The Electrosoniks which is sort of atonal electro-weirdness. Frankly your Dentist has always been impressed by the rapid-fire “papa-oom-mir-mir” background vocals – try it at that speed; its tough. The novelty was that the Martians were throwing a dance for all the human race and they were apparently fantastic dancers. For a novelty record, it has a pretty hot backbeat and was perfect to torment my daughters to.\n\n8.Jack Ross – Cinderella\n\nThis 1962 comedy record hit # 16 and was one of the first 45s Rick Steele played for the young me. A performer in San Francisco and Tahoe mainly, Ross started as a trumpet player. He found success with this retelling of the story of Cinderella done with silly mixed-up word play. He rearranged the first letters of words so instead of “it will make your flesh creep” it became “it will make you cresh fleep”. He lived from 1917 till 1982.\n\n9.Bob & Doug McKenzie – Take Off\n\nThe Canadian export SCTV was one of the best shows ever with an amazing cast during its short early ’80s U.S. run. John Candy, Eugene Levy, Martin Short, Catherine O’Hara, Harold Ramis, etc. made up the show about a fictitious network. Rick Moranis and Dave Thomas created the characters of Bob and Doug McKenzie – dopey beer-drinking donut-eating brothers who used Canadian cliches calling each other hosers. They ended up being successful and had a movie and an album released along with a 1982 #16 hit single “Take Off” with guest vocalist Geddy Lee of Rush. Their version of “The Twelve Days Of Christmas” is a perennial fave around our household.\n\n10.The Young World Singers – Ringo For President\n\nThe absolute mania that gripped the U.S. in 1964 when The Beatles hit our shores can’t be overstated. The screaming and fainting in concerts, the massive success of their records – it was also accompanied by an attempt to cash in by marketing Beatle products like wigs, games, dolls and even records about them. George’s sister had a “tell-all” LP and labels released albums of their interviews. For some reason, U.S. fans especially took to drummer Ringo Starr (his name, his happy demeaner, his sad sack image). As it was an election year a single was released on Decca by The Young World Singers touting Ringo as a candidate for President (Rolf Harris also waxed a version). Apparently he did get a few write-in votes.\n\n11.The Carefrees – We Love You Beatles\n\nLet’s go with one more of the Beatles cash-in releases – this time a #39 charter by The Carefrees. The tune was taken from the song “We Love You Conrad” found in the musical Bye Bye Birdie. Each verse is about loving one of the Fab Four and musical quotations from their songs are interspersed. This is the highest charting of all the songs about the group.\n\n12.Frank Gallop – The Ballad Of Irving\n\nWell here is a novelty record that was in my sister Cheryl’s record collection (I think I bought it for her – hope she forgives me). Gallop was the announcer on Perry Como’s ’50s & ’60s TV show having previously done radio with Milton Berle and others. This 1966 #34 hit was a take-off on the Jimmy Dean #1 “Big Bad John” from 1961 and Lorne Greene’s “Ringo” from ’64. Big dumb dumb Irving was “the 142nd fastest gun in the West” and sadly accidently gunned himself down. Gallop passed a month before his 88th birthday in 1988.\n\n13.Jimmy Cross – I Want My Baby Back\n\nOne of the more curious musical genres was that of teen death records. Songs like “Endless Sleep”, “Teen Angel”, “Deadman’s Curve”, “The Leader Of The Pack”, etc. were on the airwaves for kids who wanted to buy records about death and mayhem – weird. The style was ripe for parody and this incredibly morbid single managed to offend enough people to only get to #92 in 1965. Spoiler alert – in the end the boy misses his dead girlfriend so much that he digs her up and crawls in to the coffin. Yikes – wild stuff for 1965 (there is a Beatles reference in the lyrics, too).\n\n14.David Seville – Witch Doctor\n\nEight months prior to having his creations The Chipmunks become a hugely successful (and still going) franchise, Ross Bagdasarian had a #1 hit with this song which also used the sped up vocals later heard from Alvin, Simon & Theodore. We were all singing “ooh ee ooh ah ah, ting tang walla walla bing bang” in the summer of 1958. He had previously written “Come On-a My House”, a 1951 #1 hit for Rosemary Clooney. He passed 11 days before his 53rd birthday in January of 1972.\n\n15.The Serendipity Singers – Beans In My Ears\n\nYour Dentist would be remiss to not include at least one record by a Colorado artist, this one from a 1964 folk group flying in the face of Beatlemania and the British Invasion. “Don’t Let the Rain Come Down (Crooked Little Man)” had already reached #6 earlier for The Serendipity Singers and this song was their #30 follow-up. It likely would have gotten higher in the charts but many stations stopped playing it as parents and doctors started reporting their gullible kids were actually putting beans in their ears. You can never underestimate the stupidity of your audience (cinnamon challenge, etc. anyone?). The song was actually a metaphor about keeping your mind open. Seven kids from Colorado and 2 from Texas created a wholesome folk group to rival The New Christy Minstrels. Over time as members left, it became a franchise with various unknown singers.\n\n16.The Innocence – Mairzy Doats\n\nBack in 1967 when this was a #75 chart record, your Dentist would not have been caught dead listening to pop music like this. A month later “Light My Fire” by The Doors and “Somebody To Love” by The Jefferson Airplane were more my speed. Somewhere over the years, I took the beans out of my ears and opened up to sweetly dopey pop music. Pete Anders & Vini Poncia were mainly songwriters but also had the groups The Trade Winds (“New York’s A Lonely Town”) and The Innocence who put out this record on Kama Sutra. It was a cover of a 1943 novelty song with slurred lyrics that made sense when spoken clearly. It was about mares and does eating oats while little lambs and kids eat ivy. Bob Hope and Bing Crosby sang it a lot together on USO tours during World War II while the Merry Macs had a hit with it in 1944.\n\n17.Victor Lundberg – An Open Letter To My Teenage Son\n\nThe kids of baby boomers may find it amazing that alongside records like “Daydream Believer” (The Monkees) and “Hello, Goodbye” (The Beatles), radio stations played spoken word oddness like this. This actually got to #10 and was a reaction to the anti-war protests and the hippy movement sweeping the U.S. in late 1967 after the Summer of Love. Lundberg speaks of glue-sniffing draft-dodgers and basically disowns his son even though his wife still loves her son because after all “she is a woman”. Wow. Former DJ Lundberg was merely the voice for lyrics by Robert R. Thompson. This record spawned a spate of answer records such as “Letter from a Teenage Son” by Brandon Wade.\n\n18.Byron MacGregor – Americans\n\nThe same style as “Open Letter…”, but a very different message – this was the most successful of three 1974 chart versions of a spoken tribute to our country. Canadian newsman MacGregor hit #4, John Ritter’s dad Tex hit #90 while the composer, Gordon Sinclair, hit #24. Obviously as a country we really wanted to hear a Canadian pat us on the back alongside radio hits by Ringo and Steve Miller – again weird by today’s standards. Commentator Sinclair was annoyed that nobody ever steps up and helps the U.S., but rather is always taking hand-outs while bad-mouthing our country. He wrote this after reading that the American Red Cross had run out of money. The record received a boost again after the Sept. 11 attacks and again after Hurricane Katrina.\n\n19.Buchanan & Goodman – The Flying Saucer\n\nHitting #3 in 1956 this might be the first “mash-up” recording. This style of novelty record made a silly story using short excerpts of current singles inserted as answers to questions given by the announcer (in this case about an invasion from space). Your Dentist always enjoyed making his own versions of these sorts of novelties often with old pal G Brown who thankfully had radio connections and talented friends to make them professional sounding. The use of original clips from records was upheld in court and paved the way for a ton of follow-ups such as The Cosmonaut” by Colorado DJ Ray Durkee and many more Bill Buchanan &/or Dickie Goodman records (i.e. “Energy Crisis ’74”).\n\n20.Bobby (Boris) Pickett & The Crypt-Kickers – Monster Mash\n\nPerhaps the most successful novelty record, this was a chart hit many times. It hit #1 in 1962 then #91 in ’70, #10 in 1973 and amazingly #37 in 2021 during the age of hip-hop. Pickett wanted to be an actor but also sang with a rock group and would do an imitation of Boris Karloff’s voice (today’s folk may know Karloff as the voice of the Grinch in the old cartoon at Christmas time). There was another 1962 record “Mashed Potato Time” by Dee Dee Sharp so this was another song to do that dance to. A similar Christmas record “Monster’s Holiday” hit #30 also in 1962 for Pickett. He lived from 1938 till 2007.\n\n21.Steve Allen – What Is A Wife\n\nA genre of records that your Dentist collected for a time was “What is a…” songs. There are a ton of these with this being a #56 charting example at the end of 1955 for the originator of The Tonight Show. He was a gentler version of David Letterman before TV was so cynical. His wife Jayne Meadows had the B-side with “What Is A Husband”. He had a non-charting follow-up with “What Is A Freem” plus there were others like “What Is A Teenage Girl?”/”What Is A Teenage Boy?” by Tom Edwards in 1957. The talented Steve Allen was a writer, musician, comedian plus played the title role in the 1956 film The Benny Goodman Story. He lived from 1921 till 2000.\n\n22.Cheech & Chong – Earache My Eye\n\nI bought this single in 1974, the year it hit #9 here in the U.S.. It was first on the LP Cheech & Chong’s Wedding Album. The first half of the record is a heavy rock song. It then becomes a comedy routine when the needle gets drug across Tommy Chong’s (playing the son) record by Cheech Marin (as the dad) who wants his kid to get up and go to school. The song was the victim of protesters who demanded that it not be played on the radio as it encouraged truancy and only appealed to drug-addled drop-outs. Not being a drug-addled drop-out, I just liked the riff and thought the comedy was funny. There are some people in the world, however, who feel a need to dictate what you are allowed to watch and listen to. My advice to them is change the channel.\n\n24.Tiny Tim – Tip-Toe Thru’ The Tulips With Me\n\nOh my, here is a #17 1968 hit for Herbert Khaury who became a short-lived sensation as Tiny Tim via appearances on Rowan & Martin’s Laugh-In and The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson. Indeed he married Miss Vicki on that show on December 17, 1969 with a reported 40 million people watching. He died at age 63 in 1996. According to friends in Flash Cadillac who toured with him at one point, he was a bit of an odd duck – we will leave it there. This song was the one he is most remembered for and begins with him strumming his ukulele and evolves in to a string-laden gently charming performance in a falsetto voice. The original song was first published in 1929. Needless to say, your Dentist didn’t like it at the time preferring Savoy Brown, Hendrix, etc. but now it sounds cute.\n\n25.Charlie Drake – My Boomerang Won’t Come Back\n\nLet’s end this thing with another record I remember my old Broomfield pal Rick Steele playing for me (hate to leave out “Does Your Chewing Gum Lose It’s Flavor (On The Bedpost Over Night)” by Lonnie Donegan – oh, well). This was a #21 hit in early 1962 and was a re-recording with sanitized lyrics with the original having the aborigine practice till he was “black in the face”. In this version he was “blue in the face”. It was also edited taking out parts that didn’t make sense to a U.S. audience about “The Flying Doctor”, etc.. The “black in the face” version was a hit in Australia as well for Londoner Drake back in ’62 but is now considered inappropriate. The record was produced pre-Beatles by their producer George Martin. Drake was 81 when he passed in 2006.\n\nAfter doing part 1 of my fave male singers last month it was 50/50 if I wanted to do a part 2, but realizing that I had compared 2 singers to Roy Orbison and hadn’t actually included him in my list sealed the deal for a continuation. It really is hard to tell sometimes if you like someone simply because you like the songs they are singing or if it is their voice. That being said, there are artists I like a lot in spite of not being overly fond of the vocalist (Stray Cats – Brian Setzer, Rolling Stones – Mick Jagger, Led Zeppelin – Robert Plant all come to mind). In some ways this list was more fun to do since it was more challenging to figure out why to include someone while excluding another. This time your Dentist will be a a bit broader and open it up to at least a couple of singers not in the rock or r&b camp.\n\n**Let me again stress what I always say (yet my detractors seem to always ignore): these are only my personal favorites and not meant to be the greated singers or culturally important in any way – deal with it. If you don’t like my choices feel free to add your own as a comment since I always appreciate anyone taking the time to read and respond.\n\n***I also want to whine just a bit about a new trend that as a purist I abhor – the AI generation of new songs by long-dead artists. I don’t mean cleaning up old tracks digitally to improve the sound, I mean the horrid unauthorized remakes of songs that these folks would have never done and likely would hate. Scouring the internet, it is already overloaded with this trash and I can only hope that there is some sort of legal attempt to put a halt to it. Do we really want to hear John Lennon rapping or Patsy Cline doing a Beyonce song?!\n\n26.Roy Orbison (The Traveling Wilburys)\n\nThe Big O died way too young aged 52 (April 23, 1936 to Dec. 6, 1988), but if he had to go when he did it was sure great that he was back on top thanks to The Traveling Wilburys and then his postumous hit “You Got It”. Texan Orbison first hit the charts as a rockabilly singer with “Ooby Dooby” in 1956 on the Sun label. He wrote the song “Claudette” about his then girl friend (later wife) which became a 1958 hit for The Everly Brothers. Sadly she died in a motorcycle accident in 1966. In 1968 he lost his home and his two oldest sons in a fire. Tragedy and pain permeated many of his hits and back in the day Mr. D and I joked at the start of each Orbi-song as to whether Roy would win or lose the girl in the end – always a toss-up. One of the best parts of his records was the high notes he would build to then hold like an opera singer. Orbison toured the U.K. in 1963 with The Beatles. “Only The Lonely”, “Oh, Pretty Woman”, “Running Scared”, etc. – all great hits.\n\n27.Sam Cooke (The Soul Stirrers)\n\n“Lady you shot me” – these as supposedly the last words uttered by Sam Cook(e) after motel manager Bertha Franklin shot and killed him allegedly in self-defence. Once again here is a man who died way too young having lived from Jan. 22, 1939 to Dec. 11, 1964, Born in Mississippi, he began his professional music career in 1951 singing gospel with The Soul Stirrers before crossing over to pop as a solo star with “You Send Me”, a #1 hit in 1957. Cooke wrote most of his hits including “Chain Gang”, “Another Saturday Night” and “Shake” which was a #7 hit a few months after his death. He was a warm grit to his voice that could handle ballads as well as rockers. The story of his death is shrouded in controversy and let’s just leave it at that (you can read about it one the internet)\n\n28.Greg Lake (King Crimson/Emerson, Lake & Palmer)\n\nDorset, England-born Lake was a founding member of two of the most important progressive rock bands ever in King Crimson (1968) and Emerson, Lake & Palmer (1970). While he played bass and guitar, it was his vocals on songs like “Epitaph” and “From The Beginning” that mark him as the standard for a progressive rock singer. His 1975 solo single “I Believe in Father Christmas” has become a Yule classic. He replaced John Wetton in the band Asia for a short time and participated in different bands with Emerson and/or Palmer before his death from cancer (Nov. 10, 1947 to Dec. 7, 2016).\n\n29.Rod Stewart (The Jeff Beck Group, Faces)\n\nAs this 1966 pre-fame track shows, Rod had (and still has) that same warm grit to his voice like Sam Cooke did – just compare them side by side. London-born Rod (Jan. 10, 1945) has been equally adept at writing great hits like “Maggie May” plus covering others like “Downtown Train”. He can rock (“Hot Legs”), do ballads (“People Get Ready”) and handle the great American songbook equally. I am sure a certain faction of his audience wants to see him wiggle his arse and tousle his hair, but this blogger only wants to hear the music which to this day is still aces with albums like Blood Red Roses from 2018.\n\n30.Eric Burdon (The Animals, War)\n\nI swear it wasn’t intentional to put three versions of the same song in the top five but it does allow comparison. Burdon doesn’t sound at all like Sam Cooke and is more of a blues-rock shouter which is where he shines for me. In many ways he and The Animals set the stage for the British blues explosion that followed in the late ’60s with bands like Fleetwood Mac and Savoy Brown. A song like their cover of John Lee Hooker’s “Boom Boom” (#43 in 1965) showed Burdon at his best starting in a menacing low register and then unleashing a high register howl on the chorus – classic blues-rock. He was born May 10, 1941 in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. His career has spanned The Animals (“It’s My Life”), Eric Burdon & The Animals (“Monterey”) and the first version of War (“Spill The Wine”).\n\n31.Gerry Rafferty (Stealers Wheel)\n\nThe late Gerry Rafferty was in The Humblebums folk group with comedian Billy Connolly and then Stealers Wheel with Joe Egan before going solo. Stylistically he was definitely understated but could harmonize as well as anyone as can be seen from this starkly beautiful Mozart piece from his last solo album Life Goes On (2009). Gerry was born in Scotland April 16, 1947 and recorded a gentle pop 45 with Egan as The Fifth Column in 1966. After a couple of years in The Humblebums plus a solo album, he and Egan regrouped and had some success in Steelers Wheel (“Stuck in the Middle with You” – #6 in 1973). His biggest solo hit was “Baker Street” (#2 in 1978) but all his records are worthwhile. He battled alcoholism and it caused his liver to ultimately fail him on Jan. 4, 2011.\n\n32.Eric Carmen (The Raspberries)\n\nHere is another guy who could do rock and romance equally. His band The Raspberries kept the pop of the British Invasion from the ’60s while amping it up for the ’70s creating the template for the music we now call power-pop (Cheap Trick, The Bangles, The Smithereens). Carmen was born in Cleveland Aug. 11, 1949 and first tried to make it with Cyrus Erie who recorded unsuccessfully for Epic. When his band fell apart along with the Choir (“It’s Cold Outside”), the two bands fused as The Raspberries in 1970 and put out four essential albums on Capitol (“Go All The Way”, “Tonight”). As a solo artist he hit right out of the box in 1975 with his first self-titled Arista album that contained “All by Myself”. He had other hits like “Hungry Eyes” plus wrote for others including “Hey Deanie” that Shaun Cassidy made a hit in 1978. The Raspberries 2004/5 reunion tour was the stuff of power-pop legend that your Dentist was lucky enough to see at Fiddler’s Green (thanks Randy Jay!) – it was amazing – one of the best shows I ever saw. If you can find their live CD from that tour, do it (Pop Art Live).\n\n33.Carl Wilson (The Beach Boys)\n\nIt feels like heresy to single out one of The Beach Boys. I could easily have put Brian Wilson or even Al Jardine for his vocal on “Help Me Rhonda”, but Carl had that pure tenor which never degenerated. “God Only Knows”, “Good Vibrations”, “Darlin'”, on and on – his brother Brian mostly wrote the classics and he mainly turned to Carl to sing them. He was the youngest Wilson brother (after Brian and Dennis) born in Hawthorne, CA Dec. 21, 1946. He became an impressive guitarist taking lessons along with David Marks from John Maus of The Walker Brothers. While Brian turned to studio musicians for Beach Boys records, he kept Carl’s guitar playing. Carl died from lung cancer Feb. 6, 1998 yet one of the best moments of the 2012 Beach Boys reunion concerts was the remaining band playing to a live video of Carl singing “God Only Knows”.\n\n34.Bobby Darin\n\nHere is another artist who died way too young yet filled his short life with some great musical moments. Walden Robert Cassotto was born May 14, 1936 in East Harlem. He was a music prodigy and started writing in 1955 with Don Kirshner (later famous for The Monkees, The Archies among others). “Splish Splash” in 1958 was his first hit for Atco (written with help from DJ Murray the K). After rock hits he hit with Sinatra-style jazz (“Beyond The Sea”), countryish-pop (“You’re the Reason I’m Living”) and folk (“If I Were A Carpenter”). His last charting hit was a Michel Legrand/Smokey Robinson ballad on the Motown label (“Happy”). He suffered from heart problems virtually all his life and that finally fatally caught up to him a month after releasing “Happy” – he passed Dec. 20, 1973 in L.A.\n\n35.Jeff Lynne (The Idle Race, The Move, The Electric Light Orchestra [ELO], The Traveling Wilburys)\n\nThis one was a hard decision as he is so talented – which song to play? Since he follows Bobby Darin let’s use a cover of one of Bobby’s biggest hits. It is a bit unfair to compare the two since Lynne doesn’t have that jazzy styling and Richard Wess string arrangement, but this is still a good take. On Dec. 30, 1947 in Birmingham, England Jeffrey Lynne was born. After a stint in The Idle Race, he joined with Roy Wood and Bev Bevan in The Move which morphed in to The Electric Light Orchestra which was patterned after the “I Am The Walrus” era Beatles with chugging cellos. After their first album, Wood moved on to Wizzard while Lynne and Bevan became far more successful over time with ELO thanks to the compositions and arrangements of Lynne. Jeff seemed to grow into his voice while he matured as an artist on songs like “Mr. Blue Sky”, “Hold On Tight” and “Telephone Line”. On ballads like “Strange Magic” and rockers like “Do Ya” he eschews vocal histrionics keeping a pleasantly Brit-pop ’60s sound to his voice. As a producer he seems to know how to make other voices sound better as well (George Harrison and Tom Petty come to mind).\n\n36.John Sebastian (The Lovin’ Spoonful)\n\nBack when your blog poster fancied himself as some guitar-playing singer, I used to attempt this nice tune. Something about Sebastian’s voice was both sincere and comfortable on both ballads (“She’s A Lady”, “Rain On The Roof”) and good-time pop (“Do You Believe In Magic”). He wrote most of the hits, played a myriad of instruments well (autoharp, guitar, harmonica) and generally seemed like a good guy – someone you would like to be your friend. That all came through his vocals too – remember his big solo hit “Welcome Back”?. Grab his first solo LP on Reprise if you can (John B. Sebastian) not to mention as many of the Lovin’ Spoonful albums as you can find or at least a good greatest hits record.\n\n37.Art Garfunkel (Simon & Garfunkel)\n\nPossessing the sweetest tenor, Arthur Garfunkel was one half of the hugely successful folk duet Simon & Garfunkel who seemingly came out of nowhere in 1965 with “The Sound Of Silence”. Of course serious music fans realize that he and Paul Simon had a musical history going back to 1956 recording a #49 hit in “Hey Schoolgirl” (1957/8) – by Tom & Jerry. Art was born in Queens, NY Nov. 5, 1941. Paul Simon can of course sing well, but Garfunkel’s tenor is pure and inviting. While Simon is said to now regret giving it to Art to sing mostly solo, it is sour grapes as “Bridge Over Troubled Water” is a tour-de-force. After they split up Garfunkel dabbling in acting, but still put out some fine music in “Heart In New York”, “All I Know” and “Bright Eyes” (from the animated rabbit movie Watership Down (1978).\n\n38.Nat ‘King’ Cole\n\nWell in the intro to part 1 last month I mentioned I wasn’t going to include these more traditional ‘adult’ singers, but I simply can’t ignore Nat. In 1963 we didn’t as yet own a record player and I certainly had never heard rock and roll as dad played Mancini and mom played the classics (Mozart, Bach, etc.) on the radio. Somehow I heard this sprightly song and it was one of the first pop songs I remember liking. Growing up in the very white suburb of Broomfield, CO back then I wouldn’t have noticed that this album by a black artist featured four very white couples on the beach but in 1963 I guess you sold more records by hiding black faces. Possessing a very warm voice to wrap around songs like “Rambling Rose”, “Mona Lisa” and “L-O-V-E”, Nat was a fine jazz pianist first before slipping some vocals in to his repertoire. Nathanial Coles was born March 17, 1919 in Alabama. His family moved to Chicago where he dropped the ‘s’ and took on ‘King’ (like old King Cole). He was a heavy smoker so lung cancer felled him Feb. 15, 1965. His daughter Natalie briefly returned him to the top of the charts with a remixed newly created duet of Nat’s 1951 hit “Unforgettable”.\n\n39.Andy Williams\n\nIf we are going easy listening then let’s go all the way with Howard Andrew Williams who lived a long fruitful life from Dec. 3, 1927 till Sept. 25, 2012. He started performing with his siblings as The Williams Brothers in 1938 on the radio in his native Iowa. As a solo artist his first hit record was in 1956 on Cadence with “Canadian Sunset”. He had a string of hits there till moving to Columbia where most of his success was – “Charade”, “Can’t Get Used To Losing You”, “Hopeless”, etc. during his TV show run (1962-71). His 1973 single “Solitaire” impressed me enough that I bought it (two year’s before The Carpenters would made this Neil Sedaka/Phil Cody song a big U.S. hit). His 1963 Christmas record “It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year” (written by Edward Pola and George Wyle) has become a yearly holiday favorite.\n\n40.Jeremy Spencer (Fleetwood Mac)\n\nOf all the many singers that have been in the multiple bands using the name Fleetwood Mac, my fave was slide-man Jeremy Spencer. He could do a voice like an old blues man (Elmore James comes to mind) or an early rocker like Buddy Holly. He did proto-punk with his song “Somebody’s Gonna Get Their Head Kicked in Tonite” which the Mac released as by Earl Vince and the Valiants in 1969 (as the b-side to their Immediate single “Man Of The World”). He was born in County Durham on July 4, 1948 and was a founding member in 1967 of the true Fleetwood Mac along with Peter Green which was a great blues-rock band at the beginning. In 1970 he recorded a nifty solo album on Reprise (U.K.) with an emphasis on old rock and roll. He abruptly left the Mac in 1971 to join a religious cult then resurfaced in the 2000’s with some decent records but nothing as good as his early music. He is the far right picture in the intro.\n\n41.Bill Hurley (The Inmates)\n\nLordy, I nearly forgot about this dude who should have been on my part one list – sorry Bill! The Inmates were a classic rockin’ British blues band that got lumped in with the new wave post disco bands. They hit #51 back in early 1980 with a cover of the old Standells record “Dirty Water”. Their first two Polydor albums are essential if you like hot old school blues rock (First Offence and Shot In The Dark). There are a few other import Inmates albums worth checking out and a couple of decent solo albums as well. He has been silent however for some time I fear.\n\n42.Kim Wilson (The Fabulous Thunderbirds)\n\nMy July 2022 blog post about harmonica players listed Kim Wilson as one of my faves so let’s also slide him in a year later as a fave singer. He has that classic blues-rock voice singing with The Fabulous Thunderbirds (“Tuff Enuff”, “Powerful Stuff”). He was born Jan 6, 1951 in Detroit then grew up in Goleta, CA. The Fabulous Thunderbirds formed in Austin back in 1974 around Wilson and guitarist Jimmie Vaughan. Wilson appears to still be leading a version of the T-birds with all new players. He has also released something like eight solo albums.\n\n43.Martin Fry (ABC)\n\nLancashire born, Stockport raised Fry hit the world March 9, 1958 and is best known as lead singer with the British band ABC. Their 1982 debut album The Lexicon Of Love is an essential purchase for fans of Brit-pop of that era. “The Look Of Love”, “All of My Heart”, “When Smokey Sings” are all great. Fry is the only remaining member of ABC and in 2016 he put out the album The Lexicon of Love II which included the nice single “Viva Love”.\n\n44.Brook Benton\n\nHis relaxed vocal style reminds one of Nat King Cole with a bit more quaver and depth to his voice. On many songs he drops down into a deep register which makes a fun counterpoint. Lazily rockin’ over a bed of strings with easy self-assurance describes many of his classic Mercury hits like “Kiddio” plus his duet with Dinah Washington – “Baby, You’ve Got What It Takes”. Benjamin Franklin Peay came to be in South Carolina Sept. 19, 1931 and started out singing gospel as so many of the early black artists did. At first he had more success co-writing including “Looking Back” for Nat King Cole and “A Lover’s Question” for Clyde McPhatter. He charted 49 songs on the Hot 100 with his last major hit being a cover of the Tony Joe White song “Rainy Night In Georgia” (#4 in 1970 on Cotillion). He passed away April 9, 1988. Benton is the far left picture in the intro.\n\n45.Peter Gabriel (Genesis)\n\nIt was tempting to put John Mitchell (Lonely Robot, It Bites), Fish (Marillion) or Phil Collins (Genesis) here but then on reflection it was obvious that they all sound like copies of the original Genesis lead singer – Peter Gabriel. What caused some hesitation was I don’t like many of Gabriels solo songs since he like all the ex-Genesis members seems to have totally moved away from prog-rock (other than Steve Hackett – bless you!). Give me a mellotron and a twisting lead guitar part over a crazy time signature – but I digress. Just as Gabriel became a better performer while Genesis went on, so too did he grow in to his sort of hoarse but smooth tenor (though it was even there on their 1969 debut – From Genesis To Revelation. Collins sounded like a pleasantly pinched version while Mitchell and Fish nearly carbon copies of Selling England By The Pound or Foxtrot era Gabriel. From Surrey (born Feb. 13, 1950), Gabriel was luckily from a more upper crust family than most rock stars as it was at one of the more expensive boarding schools (Charterhouse) he met the other musicians who would form Genesis. After leaving Genesis in 1975, his unconventional world music course has not led to many hits (“Shock The Monkey”, “Sledgehammer”) but he has at least been interesting (his first 4 albums were all titled simply Peter Gabriel for instance).\n\n46.Burton Cummings (The Guess Who)\n\nAfter the Chad Allan sung “Shakin’ All Over”, all the hits of The Guess Who were vocalized by the lovely tenor of Burton Cummings – so do not accept any modern version of the band without him! He was born in Winnipeg, Manitoba on New Year’s Eve 1947. In 1966 he joined Chad Allan & The Expressions as a replacement keyboardist and eventually became singer Allan’s replacement as well as they became The Guess Who (due to a record label’s confusing stunt). He and guitarist Randy Bachman complimented each other well as songwriters churning out classics like “These Eyes”, “Laughing”, “No Sugar Tonight” and “American Woman”. When Bachman left after that last single Burton with The Guess Who continued to have hits with “Share The Land”, “Clap For The Wolfman”, etc. before leaving for a solo career (“Stand Tall”, “You Saved My Soul”). Cummings has concentrated more on his native Canada of late when it comes to touring.\n\n47.Nick Lowe (Brinsley Schwarz, Rockpile, Little Village)\n\nHere was another tough call as I simply don’t like Lowe’s music after he got the big payout from his song “(What’s So Funny ‘Bout) Peace, Love, and Understanding” being covered on the mega-hit The Bodyguard soundtrack by Curtis Stigers. For some reason in the mid-90s he stopped rocking which is a pity. That being said, on reflection I actually prefer his voice to that of his Rockpile bandmate Dave Edmunds’ more pinched vocal (though I have to say that Dave is my all-time fave solo artist). Nicholas Drain Lowe hit the world on March 24, 1949 in Surrey, England. Edmunds produced the last album for his band Brinsley Schwarz and when they broke up in 1975, Lowe became the bassist and songwriter for Rockpile. All but the last Rockpile album came out as either Lowe or Edmunds solo records as they were each signed to different labels. Here in the U.S. you only know Nick from “Cruel To Be Kind” and “I Knew The Bride (When She Used To Rock & Roll)” unless you like me were a big fan of British ’70s guitar pop. My all-time Lowe is “Half A Boy & Half A Man” recorded with Nick Lowe & His Cowboy Outfit back in 1984. Thankfully in the last few years he has started rocking again on record and while touring with Los Straitjackets.\n\n48.Huey Lewis (Clover, Huey Lewis & The News)\n\nBack in 1979 Huey played harmonica on a couple of songs for Rockpile. It wasn’t till 1982 however that mainstream rock audiences here in the U.S. got to know Huey Lewis and his band The News on their second album Picture This which included the single “Do You Believe In Love?”. From there it was “Power Of Love”, “Hip To Be Square”, “Heart & Soul”, on and on. Hugh Cregg III was born in N.Y. the day after the 4th of July in 1950, but grew up in Marin County (Calif.). As Hughie or Huey Louis he played harp and sang in the ’70s bay band Clover (a much more hirsute Huey can be seen on youtube doing “Chicken Funk” back in 1975 – he and Sean Hopper engage in some crazy dancing too in that video). Huey grew in to a classically powerful gravelly rock and roll voice. Hearing loss seems to have put an end to his singing.\n\n49.Bryan Adams\n\nMr. Adams has that same grit to his voice that so many classic rock singers have. From Kingston, Ontario (Nov. 5, 1959) Bryan is the second Canadian on this list. “Heaven”, “Run To You”, “(Everything I Do) I Do It for You” were all big hits for Adams. He endears himself to me by citing Humble Pie, CCR and Deep Purple as faves (mine as well). With Jim Vallance he wrote classics including “Straight From The Heart”, “It’s Only Love” and “Heat Of The Night”. He has continued releasing fine new music including last year’s\n\nSo Happy It Hurts.\n\n50.Glen Campbell\n\nYour steely Dentist found himself choking with emotion while watching this bittersweet video from the fantastic 2008 album Meet Glen Campbell which for me is the best record he ever did. It also includes the definitive version of John Lennon’s “Grow Old With Me”. Of course you know his sweet tenor from “Rhinestone Cowboy”, “Wichita Lineman”, “Try A Little Kindness” etc. however not enough know this wonderful album. The video is bittersweet when we look back and realize that three years later he was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s which would take his memory and personality (though his ability to perform lasted longer – that shows the power of music, folks!). Glen Travis Campbell was born in Arkansas on April 22, 1936. He played guitar for years before moving to L.A. in 1960 and becoming a session musician (part of ‘The Wrecking Crew’). At the same time he was recording under his own name till finally hitting it big with “By The Time I Get To Phoenix” in 1967 (that same year he did the uncredited vocal on one of my faves – “My World Fell Down” by Sagittarius). “Sunflower”, “Southern Nights”, “True Grit” – he had a long and successful career helped by his TV exposure (especially The Glen Campbell Goodtime Hour which ran from 1969 till 1972). He passed away August 8, 2017.\n\nWell we did my favorite female singers (see post September 2021) so it seems logical to remove one of the X chromosomes and add a Y. There are so many outstanding singers that it gets tough to whittle it down to only 25 (or 26 as #1 is definitely cheating – sorry). With different styles it also becomes tough as you end up comparing apples to oranges – ballad singers versus belters. Some may wish that this list would simply be rock/soul shouters and another list be balladeers, but I choose to lump them together to make the decisions tougher. That is what makes these sorts of lists fun at any rate (and may end up later calling for a part 2). Don’t look for Sam the Sham, but he would be on my list of best singers who wore a turban. Oh, and one caveat, these are not meant to be the ‘best’ singers; just my favorites. If we were looking at easy listening, Nat King Cole and Frank Sinatra would of course be here, but that isn’t in the scope of this list.\n\n1.John Lennon/Paul McCartney (The Beatles)\n\nCheating right off the bat, but it becomes sort of like choosing your favorite M&M to pick betwixt these two and really a lot of what made The Beatles great was their vocal interplay. Both could equally sing ballads (“Yesterday”, “In My Life”) and screamers (“Long Tall Sally”, “Twist & Shout”). That is what really distinguishes them from so many other pop bands who tried to copy their sound. Very few bands could excel at rockers like “Revolution” and “Helter Skelter” then sing pop like “Please Please Me” and “Another Girl”. As solo artists they never reached the same vocal heights for me as they did in tandem. McCartney – June 18, 1942 (Liverpool) – present. Lennon – Oct. 9, 1940 (Liverpool) to Dec. 8, 1980 (New York).\n\n2.Mike Smith (The Dave Clark Five)\n\nThe Dave Clark Five were the very first rock and roll combo that grabbed the ears of your Dentist as a teenager in 1965. They rocked much harder than The Beatles at that time with their raunchy sax, pounding drums and booming bass. What cemented it were the screaming vocals of Mike Smith on tracks like “I Like It Like That”, “Having A Wild Weekend” and “Reelin’ & Rockin'”. He could sing ballads like “Because” and “Come Home”, but this kid wanted to rock and that was mainly what the DC5 did. In 2003, he appeared at the KOOL Concert in Colorado’s Fiddler’s Green (Greenwood Village) and put on a rockin’ show. Thanks to good friend (and great DJ) Randy Jay, I was able to meet Mr. Smith backstage and was surprised at what a humble and quiet man he was compared to the shouter he was on stage. Sadly, not long after that summer show, Smith had an accident and was paralyzed which led to his death Feb. 28th just 11 days short of his band’s induction in to the R&R Hall Of Fame in 2008 (he was born in the U.K. Dec. 6, 1943). He is pictured in the 2nd picture in the intro.\n\n3.Mark Lindsay (Paul Revere & The Raiders)\n\nWell if The Dave Clark Five were the first band that grabbed your blogger as a kid, the second one was Paul Revere & The Raiders. They were the whole package – visuals (costumes and choreography), songs (“Just Like Me”, “Hungry”) and they rocked like mad. Their singer was Mark Lindsay who went from being a shy, nearly blind sax player, to a cocky pony-tailed shouter. He also wrote many of the songs. “Mad Man Markus” recorded several hit singles on his own like “Arizona” and “Silver Bird”, but make mine the rockers from The Raiders. Born March 9, 1942 in Eugene, Oregon, Lindsay should be in the R&R Hall of Fame along with his Raiders – but he isn’t nor are they. He is pictured in the 1st picture in the intro.\n\n4.John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival)\n\nIn the late ’60s, it felt like John Fogerty and his band were single-handedly trying to bring America back from a psychedelic brink to 3-chord rock and roll. Thanks John – I bet you would be a fun guy to talk music with! A song like “Travelin’ Band” showed he was a rock and roll screamer with the best of them. Born in El Cerrito, CA May 28, 1945 he was a glasses-wearing white kid, but he sounded for all the world like a southern soul man. “Susie Q”, “Keep On Chooglin'”, “Green River”, etc. – all great CCR songs. As a solo artist he nailed it also with songs like “The Old Man Is Down The Road” and “Rockin’ All Over The World”.\n\n5.Pete Ham (Badfinger)\n\nHam wasn’t a shouter, but there was something about his warm voice that continues to hit me to my core today. The songs he wrote like “Baby Blue”, “Just A Chance”, “No Matter What” and especially “Day After Day” are among some of my all-time favorites. When someone dies too early you have to wonder what music we were robbed of that they would have created. The Badfinger story is a terribly depressing one of financial betrayal that ultimately caused both Ham and Tom Evans to take their own lives. Sadly had they been able to weather the storm, one assumes they would have managed to reap rewards from at least the song they wrote together “Without You” (a #1 for Nilsson in 1972 and #3 for Mariah Carey in 1994). Pete was born in Swansea, Wales April 27, 1947 and passed April 24, 1975.\n\n6.Barry Gibb (The Bee Gees)\n\nIf you only know the mega-star disco era Bee Gees, you are missing out on some of the best music the brothers did. Oldest brother Barry was born on the Isle Of Man Sept. 1, 1946. With his younger brothers Maurice and Robin, he was performing at a very young age. From 1958 till 1967 the Gibb family were living in Australia where the brothers honed their wonderful three-part harmonies. The single “Words” (1968 – #15 U.S.) was a solo vocal spot for Barry. Your Dentist was a rock and roll fool, but in college developed a soft spot for this sort of music including great songs like “To Love Somebody”, “Lonely Days” and “Run To Me”.\n\n7.Elvis Presley\n\nAs a lad, this baby boomer saw Elvis as being old news that didn’t fit with The Stones and Hendrix. I still remember the event that changed it all. Drummer pal Mr. D and I went to a club to see Alan who was an Elvis imitator. As the night wore on I was frantically writing down the names of songs that I had never heard before and needed to own pronto. Probably the one that grabbed the young GK first was “I Got Stung”. Songs like “Too Much” and “Paralyzed” – rock and roll at its primitive best. You see, the Elvis us kids heard on the radio during the mid to later ’60s was a pale imitation of the real gone Elvis who rocked up a storm. Forget “Do The Clam” and “Spinout”, the good stuff was “Money Honey” and “Good Rockin’ Tonight”. Okay, he slipped in a few goodies later like “Promised Land” and “T-R-O-U-B-L-E”, but it is the Elvis from 1954 to 1962 or so that puts him here. The Kin"
