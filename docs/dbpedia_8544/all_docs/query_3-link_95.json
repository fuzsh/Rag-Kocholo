        "meta_description": "Hailed as the new Beatles but \"mismanaged and exploited beyond the bounds of human decency\" Badfinger's thankless career drove two members to take their own lives. Badfinger could have been huge. What’s more, the band’s connections with The Beatles once earned them the tag of ‘the new Fab\nFour’. But instead, despite writing and recording some wonderfully memorable music, Badfinger went down in the annals of rock history for all the wrong\nreasons. Most people who remember the band today will probably point to the fact that two key members took their own lives.\nThe story of Badfinger is probably one of the most tragic in rock’n’roll. Everything that could go wrong did go wrong – twice– while their occasional triumphs over adversity never seemed to bring them their rightful reward. When Harry Nilsson first heard Without You (his future worldwide No.1 hit single), written by\nBadfinger’s Pete Ham and Tom Evans, he assumed it was a Beatles song. It was an understandable mistake, given that Paul McCartney had taken the band under his wing, signed them to The Beatles’ Apple label, and even written a hit for them in Come And Get It. Badfinger also backed George Harrison on his Bangladesh concerts. But their connection with The Beatles would become a double-edged sword.\n\nMy special guest this week is singer, songwriter and guitarist JOEY MOLLAND - Badfinger's sole surviving member.\n\nDuring our chat, Joey discusses his life and career in the music industry. He talks about his early days in Liverpool, where he was part of a tight-knit\nmusical community that included some of the most famous bands of the time, such as The Beatles and The Searchers. He talked about his experiences playing in various bands and making records, including joining The Ivey's, which later became Badfinger.\nJoey talks about the success of Badfinger in America, particularly their hit song 'Come and Get It', which was written by Paul McCartney. He also discusses the band's formation and later successes with songs such as No Matter What and Day After Day. However, despite the band's success, Joey walks us through \nthe struggles the band faced with management and financial ruin. He still believes that \"whatever doesn't kill you, makes you stronger.\"\nToday Joey Molland continues to perform under the name Joey Molland's Badfinger and is proud of the band's legacy of hits. He chats about his latest solo album, 'Be True to Yourself', which features collaborations with notable musicians such as Mark Hudson, a Grammy-winning\nproducer who has worked with bands like Aerosmith and Rainbow. The album also features contributions from his friends Julian Lennon and The Monkees' Micky Dolenz.\n\"Be True to Yourself,\" is Joey Molland's sixth solo album and the first in seven years. It definitely has echoes of John, Paul, George and sometimes even Ringo. \nTo learn more about Joey Molland, check out my website https://abreathoffreshair.com.au\nYou may also like to take a look at the 1997 book \"Without You: The Tragic Story of Badfinger,” by Dan Matovina https://www.amazon.com.au/Without-You-Tragic-Story-Badfinger/dp/0965712222\n\nPlease get in touch with me with any comments, feedback or guest suggestions - sandy@abreathoffreshair.com.au\nI hope you enjoy this episode.",

        "text": "UB40, a reggae band from Birmingham, UK, emerged in the late 70s from humble beginnings, with members scraping by on unemployment benefits. The band's original lineup consisted of friends from Moseley School of Art and local schools: Robin and Ali Campbell, Earl Falconer, Brian Travers, Jimmy Brown, Norman Hassan, and later, Michael Virtue and Astro. They named themselves after the unemployment benefit form \"UB40\" and quickly became known for their left-wing political stance, aligning themselves with causes like Rock Against Racism and anti-National Front protests.\n\nIn 1980, UB40's debut single \"King b/w Food For Thought\" reached the UK Top 5, setting the stage for their success. Their first album, Signing Off (1980), was a blend of reggae, dub, and politically charged lyrics, reaching No. 2 in the UK and staying in the charts for 72 weeks. By 1981, their second album, Present Arms, solidified their reputation, with the hit single \"One In Ten\" becoming an anthem for the unemployed and a protest against the UK government's policies.\n\nUB40's third album, UB44 (1982), marked a transition, but it was Labour of Love (1983) that truly catapulted them to international fame. This album of reggae covers, including the iconic \"Red Red Wine,\" became their first UK No. 1 album and produced their first US No. 1 single. This success established UB40 as reggae ambassadors, introducing reggae to new audiences worldwide.\n\nThroughout the 1980s, UB40 continued to release successful albums, including Geffery Morgan (1984), Rat In The Kitchen (1986), and UB40 (1988). Their collaborations with Chrissie Hynde on \"I Got You Babe\" and \"Breakfast In Bed\" were also hits.\n\nThe late 80s and early 90s saw the band achieve global success with Labour Of Love II and Promises and Lies, the latter featuring \"Can’t Help Falling In Love,\" which became another US No. 1 hit.\n\nIn the mid-90s, the band took a break, with members pursuing solo projects. However, they returned with Guns In The Ghetto and Labour Of Love III , continuing to tour extensively. Their influence and success were underscored by their contribution to the England rugby team's 2003 World Cup campaign with \"Swing Low\" and the Grammy-nominated Who You Fighting For (2005), which featured politically charged songs and love ballads.\n\nIn 2008, Ali Campbell left the band to pursue a solo career, replaced by his brother Duncan Campbell. The band continued to release albums and tour, with TwentyFourSeven receiving critical acclaim. Despite Astro's departure in 2013, UB40 continued to tour successfully, playing sold-out shows across the UK, Europe, and beyond.\n\nUB40's enduring appeal lies in their ability to blend reggae with socially conscious lyrics, making them one of the most influential reggae bands in history. Their journey from Birmingham's working-class roots to global stardom is a testament to their talent, resilience, and commitment to their music and message.\n\nTo celebrate their 45th anniversary, the band has just released the album UB45.\n\nJoining us this week to share the story of their rise to international fame is original member, drummer Jimmy Brown.\n\nFor more head to their website https://ub40.global/\n\nHas Gerry Beckley retired? Does he still sing with America? Who influenced the band America? All these questions answered this week.\n\nGerry Beckley is a singer/songwriter best known as a founding member of the classic soft rock outfit America. Alongside bandmates Dewey Bunnell and Dan Peek, Gerry first gained recognition for hits like 1971's \"Horse with No Name,\" 1972's \"Ventura Highway,\" 1975's \"Sister Golden Hair,\" and others. Though he and Dewey have continued to perform as America until recenlty, Gery has also recorded under his own name since the mid '90s, releasing such mellow, well-crafted albums as 2022's Aurora and 2024's self -titled album Gerry Beckley.\n\nGerry was born in Texas in 1952. He grew up as the son of an American air force officer and a British mother. Interested in music from a young age, he began playing piano at age three and later added guitar. By the time he was ten, Gerry was a promising musician playing in the surf rock band the Vanguards. He had also come under the influence of The Beatles and other British Invasion-era bands as a result of spending his summer vacations in England.\n\nIn 1967, Gerry moved with his family to London after his father took over as commander at the United States Air Force base.

Or how he survived a terminall cancer diagnosis? Tune in to find out.\n\nNeville ‘Noddy’ Holder is one of the great institutions of British rock. As the garishly trousered, top-hatted frontman of West Midlands glam yobs Slade, he helped soundtrack the early 70s with a string of Top 10 hits that peaked with the immortal festive anthem Merry Xmas Everybody. Since leaving the band in the early 90s, Noddy branched out into acting, most notably in sitcom The Grimleys, and writing (his 1999 autobiography Who’s Crazee Now? was followed by 2014’s The World According To Noddy). He is also the voice for the elevator announcements at his local Walsall art gallery.\n\nBorn in 1946 in the Midlands, Noddy formed his first band, The Rockin’ Phantoms, at the age of 13 and left school after O levels to take a job in a car parts firm while pursuing a music career. The band became The Memphis Cut-Outs and they became popular enough on the local scene for Noddy to quit the day job. He went on to join The Mavericks, who were signed to a record label in 1965, and his stablemates were The N’ Betweens, a band that included future Slade members guitarist Dave Hill and drummer Don Powell. The two bands shared bills and bonded, laying the foundations for Noddy's next move.\n\nIn 1966, Dave and Don convinced Noddy to join their new group, along with multi-instrumentalist Jim Lea. They called the band Ambrose Slade. After their debut album flopped, they changed their name to Slade and adopted a skinhead image for the following year’s Play It Loud. When that failed to catch the public’s imagination, the band turned to glam rock and swiftly became one of Britain’s biggest bands, with Slayed? (1972) reaching No 1 after their breakthrough single Get Down And Get With It.\n\nThe next few years saw Slademania take Britain by storm with a run of classic, hit singles (mostly chart-toppers) that gave English teachers the nation over sleepless nights including Coz I Luv You, Take Me Bak ’Ome, Mama Weer All Crazee Now, Gudbuy T’Jane, Cum On Feel The Noize, Skweeze Me, Pleeze Me and Merry Xmas Everybody.\n\nNoddy Holder left Slade in 1992 but remained a familiar figure on BritishTV screens, most notably as a team captain on BBC1’s music series A Question Of Pop and playing the music teacher Neville Holder in the ITV comedy drama The Grimleys. In 2000, Noddy was awarded the MBE for his services to showbusiness.\n\nLate in 2023, Noddy revealed that he’d been diagnosed with oesophageal cancer five years earlier and had been given six months to live. Thanks to some experimental chemotherapy treatment, Noddy has survived and is back on the stage doing what he loves to do best.\n\nNoddy Holder joins us this week to walk us through his illustrious career and talks warts and all.\n\nFor more information about Noddy http://www.noddyholder.com/\n\nComments, questions or suggestions for future guests https://www.abreathoffreshair.com.au\n\nWant to know what happened to Paul Carrack?\n\nWhy he left Mike and the Mechanics?\n\nWhich song he wrote for the Eagles and what he's doing now?\n\nWell, tune in and find out!\n\nEnglish singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist, Paul Carrack has been a member of several bands including Ace, Squeeze, Mike + The Mechanics, and Roxy Music.

He often missed long periods of school because of childhood asthma, particularly music lessons, and although Don slipped back in his studies, his parents allowed his love of music to flourish. By age 16, he had bought his first guitar and began making contacts in the music business, becoming friends with the folk singers Erik Darling and Fred Hellerman of the Weavers.\n\nDon recorded his first album, Tapestry in 1969 in Berkeley, California during the student riots. After being rejected 72 times by labels, the album was finally picked up and released. Don worked on the album for a couple of years before putting it out. It attracted good reviews but little notice outside the folk community, although on the Easy Listening chart \"Castles in the Air\" was a success, and in 1973 \"And I Love You So\" also became a number 1 Adult Contemporary hit for crooner, Perry Como.\n\nDon's major break came when the record company he was with was taken over by United Artists Records, which gave him major label promotion for his second album, American Pie. The album launched two number one hits - the title song and \"Vincent\". American Pie's success made Don an international star overnight and piqued interest in his first album, which charted more than two years after its initial release.\n\nIn 2004, he was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame. In January 2018, BMI certified that \"American Pie\" and \"Vincent\" had reached five million and three million airplays respectively.\n\nHis composition \"And I Love You So\" has been sung by Elvis Presley, Perry Como, Helen Reddy, Glen Campbell, and others, and in 2000, Madonna had a hit with a rendition of \"American Pie\".

Their unique sound combined elements of punk, rock, and electronic music, setting them apart from their contemporaries.\n\nIn 1979, Martha and the Muffins signed with the British label Dindisc, a subsidiary of Virgin Records. Their debut album, \"Metro Music,\" was released in 1980 and included the single \"Echo Beach.\" The song became an international hit, reaching the top 10 in Canada, the UK, and several other countries. Its catchy melody and wistful lyrics captured the imagination of a generation and remain iconic to this day.\n\nThe success of \"Echo Beach\" propelled the band into the spotlight. However, they faced challenges in maintaining their momentum. Their second album, \"Trance and Dance\" (1980), and third album, \"This is the Ice Age\" (1981), saw significant lineup changes.\n\nIn 1982, the band released \"Danseparc,\" another collaboration with new member, Daniel Lanois.

Johnson released a solo album, \"Solo One,\" in 1997, while Gane worked on various production and music projects.\n\nIn the early 1990s, Martha and the Muffins reformed, primarily as a duo consisting of Johnson and Gane. They released \"Modern Lullaby\" in 1992, which was well-received by critics but did not achieve significant commercial success.\n\nAfter another extended hiatus, the band re-emerged in 2010 with the album \"Delicate,\" which marked a return to their roots while incorporating modern influences. This period also saw renewed interest in their earlier work, with reissues and retrospective collections.\n\nMartha Johnson was diagnosed with Parkinson's Disease in 2001. She has been open about her battle and has faced significant challenges due to the progressive nature of the disease.\n\nMartha's diagnosis came after she began experiencing symptoms that interfered with her ability to perform and record music. The diagnosis was a significant moment for her, marking the beginning of a long journey to manage the condition while continuing her career in music.\n\nDespite the challenges, Martha has shown remarkable resilience. She has become an advocate for Parkinson's disease awareness, using her platform to educate others about the condition. Her advocacy includes speaking engagements and participating in events aimed at raising funds for research and support for those affected by the disease.\n\nShe has not let Parkinson's disease define her or halt her creativity. Martha continues to be involved in music and is an inspiration to many.\n\nMartha has just released a new single to enhance awareness of PD and this week shares her personal reflections on music and living with Parkinson's disease. Her story is one of courage, persistence, and the power of music to transcend personal hardships.\n\nAs a founding member of the Grammy-winning, platinum-selling rock band TOTO, songwriter/keyboardist Steve Porcaro had huge pop hits with \"Hold the Line,\" \"Rosanna,\" and \"Make Believe.\"\n\nHe also co-wrote \"Human Nature\" which is featured on Michael Jackson's 30 million-selling Thriller album.\n\nSteve's other band mates in Toto were his brothers Jeff and Mike Porcaro, David Paich, David Hungate, Steve Luthaker, Bobby Kimball, Fergie Fredericksen, and Joseph Williams. Each of these guys also became in-demand session musicians, playing on numerous records.\n\nBorn in Connecticut, Steve's musical roots run deep in his family tree. He started taking piano lessons when he was four years old. With his brothers began playing in various bands. The Porcaro brothers met David Paich when their fathers worked together on Glenn Campbell's TV variety show. The boys became friends and started making music together.\n\nAs the youngest brother, Steve couldn't compete with his brothers and found a niche playing the synthesiser and the keyboard. He got his break when he toured both with Gary Wright (\"Dreamweaver\") and Boz Scaggs around the time of Boz's Silk Degrees album.\n\nIt was the members of Boz's touring band who would later form Toto. Their self-titled LP was released in 1977. Going platinum, it yielded the gold single \"Hold the Line,\" \"I'll Supply the Love,\" and \"Georgy Porgy\" --a favourite sample source for rap/hip hop groups in the '90s, as was \"Human Nature.\"\n\n1982 would prove to be a huge year for the group. Their million-selling LP Toto IV cleaned up at the Grammys winning Album of the Year, Record of the Year (\"Rosanna\" ), and Producer of the Year.\n\nAfter seven albums, Toto disbanded in 1988. Steve went on to launch a film scoring career and contributed to many popular films.\n\nHowever, he continued working with Toto in various supporting capacities, assisting with keyboards, drum looping, synthesizers and arranging/composing. He has also done session musician work for many other acts, including Yes (on Union) and Jefferson Airplane (on their self-titled 1989 reunion album). He was also a member of Chris Squire’s short lived band, The Chris Squire Experiment, in 1992.\n\nSteve returned to play with Toto at live performances since 2010, when they decided to reform the band and tour in Europe to support an ailing Mike Porcaro. He performed on the band's 2015 studio album, co-writing and singing lead on \"The Little Things\" and co-writing/singing lead on the Japan-only bonus cut, \"Bend\". This was only the third lead vocal performance from him on a Toto album.\n\nWhen the band dissolved in 2019 and regrouped in 2020, Porcaro did not return.\n\nSteve Porcaro joins us this week to share stories of his fascinating musical journey.

He joined the progressive rock outfit Curved Air, working first as their road manager then as their drummer.\n\nIn early 77, he founded the Police with singer/bassist Sting and guitarist Henri Padovani (soon replaced by Andy Summers). Their first hit, 79's \"Roxanne,\" set the course for huge success to follow.\n\nThe trio emerged as one of the most popular and innovative bands of the post-punk era, drawing upon reggae, funk, and world music to create a uniquely infectious yet cerebral brand of pop which generated a series of smash singles including \"Every Little Thing She Does Is Magic,\" \"Every Breath You Take,\" and \"King of Pain.\"\n\nWhile with the Police, Steward also issued a solo record under the alias Klark Kent. This not only earned him wide critical acclaim for his intricate, textured drum work, but also for his songwriting as he contributed many of the group's songs.\n\nWhen the Police officially disbanded in 1986, the band was still at their commercial peak. Disagreements betwenn members had caused the trio's collapse and Stewart took to composing film scores, earning himself a Golden Globe nomination. He increasingly spent more time on film scores.\n\nIn 2002, Stewart formed a new rock-oriented project, Oysterhead - a power trio supergroup. A year later he produced and directed Everyone Stares, a documentary film about his time in the Police.\n\nIn 2007, Stewart reunited with his former bandmates to celebrate their 30th anniversary.\n\nStewart also wrote his memoir, Strange Things Happen: A Life with The Police, Polo, and Pygmies at this time.\n\nIn 2021, Stewart collaborated on the instrumental 'Divine Tides'. The album won the 2022 Grammy Award for Best New Age Album, giving Copeland his first Grammy win outside of the five he earned as a member of the Police.\n\nHe also released 'Police Deranged for Orchestra' where he reworked Police hits for an orchestra.\n\nIn 2023, he published Stewart Copeland's Police Diaries, a book based on his original diary entries from 1976-1979.\n\nThis week Stewart Copeland joins us to regale us with his many stories.\n\nIf you'd like to kmow more about him head for https://www.stewartcopeland.net/151/life-and-work\n\nIf you'd like to request a guest, send me a message through my website https:www.abreathoffreshair.com.au\n\nI know you're going to LOVE this episode. He's quite a character!\n\nPat Arnold (born Patrica Ann Cole in 1946 in Los Angeles), professionally known as P.P. Arnold, is a soul singer who enjoyed considerable success in the United Kingdom in the 60s and beyond.\n\nBorn into a family of gospel singers, PP married early, had two children, worked a series of menial jobs until the early 60s, when her friends contacted her with an offer she couldn't refuse. The girls had managed to arrange an audition for them to replace the original Ikettes, the vocal and dancer/singer troupe behind the Ike and Tina Turner Revue. One of the girls didn't show up and PP was asked to fill in.\n\nThe three girls were offered the job on the spot. PP defied her husband, placed her children in the care of her parents and joined Ike & Tina Turner.\n\nShe came to England in 1966 on tour in support of The Rolling Stones. Mick Jagger was impressed by her soulful voice and convinced Stones manager Andrew Oldham to sign PP to record with his newly founded record label. PP quit the Turner band to establish a solo career. She also had a fling with Jagger.\n\nPP enjoyed several major British hits, including songs written for her by Steve Marriott of The Small Faces. She also sung backing vocals on the their hit \"Tin Soldier\" and toured with them in 68.\n\nPP toured with Jimi Hendrix, The Who, The Kinks, Blind Faith, David Bowie and others, and scored several hits including a cover version of \"The First Cut Is the Deepest\" and \"Angel of the Morning\".\n\nAfter the collapse of record label in the late 60s, PP released two singles produced by Barry Gibb of The Bee Gees, but a planned album with Gibb was never completed.\n\nIn 1970 she moved to the musical stage, and contributed session musician backing vocals to many notable UK sessions. During these sessions she met bassist Fuzzy Samuels of Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. They married and had a son.\n\nThe couple returned to Los Angeles. PP''s marriage to Samuels ended and two weeks after the split, her daughter Debbie was killed in a car accident.\n\nShe withdrew from public life, re-emerging in 1978 when she was reunited with Barry Gibb and teamed up with Andy Gibb for a duet recording of the Carole King song \"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\".\n\nShe returned to England in 1982 to raise her son there.\n\nIn 1984 she joined the cast of the musical Starlight Express.\n\nShe appeared on Roger Waters' album in 1992, providing vocals on the song \"Perfect Sense\".\n\nIn 1994 she joined the cast of the award-winning musical Once On This Island. While the production was playing in Birmingham she met leading UK band Ocean Colour Scene, one of the new wave of latter-day mod groups who (like their mentor Paul Weller), idolised The Small Faces.\n\nHer friendship with OCS led to her singing the lead vocal, backed by Primal Scream, on a cover of The Small Faces' \"Understanding\", which was included on a successful Small Faces tribute album. She also worked extensively with Ocean Colour Scene on their 1997 album.\n\nThis success led to plans for her to record her first solo album in decades, but once again it was not completed. Deciding to put together a new band to promote her material, Arnold joined forces with Chaz Jankel, former pianist with Ian Dury and The Blockheads. This was followed by an invitation to tour widely with Roger Waters. She was a backup vocalist on his 1999–2000 tour as well as the 2006–2008 tour, Dark Side of the Moon Live.\n\nIn mid 2007 she released her first recorded work for several years. The album is a duet with The Blow Monkeys frontman Dr. Robert and has been met with critical acclaim, as have their live performances at several venues.\n\nBrian Cadd is an Australian singer-songwriter, keyboardist, producer and record label founder, a staple of Australian entertainment for over 50 years.

Born in 1947 in Milwaukee, Lee has more than 2000 albums to his credit (and still counting), and is considered to be one of the \"A\" players in the highly selective L.A. rock music community where the competition for recording dates is fierce, and where only the strongest survive.\n\nHis very recognisable bass playing style has been heard on hits by Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, Hall & Oates, Jackson Browne, Carole King, Phil Collins, Keith Richards and Reba McEntire to name just a few.\n\nLeland has played on TV shows like Hill Street Blues, Knight Rider, Simon and Simon, and also on many films, including Forrest Gump, Ghost, Kindergarten Cop, and My Best Friend's Wedding.\n\nLeland moved to Los Angeles when he was very young and started playing piano at age four. When he entered Junior High he fully intended to continue as a pianist in the school music program but found that there was an overabundance of piano students, but no string bass players. His instructor asked him if he’d consider playing bass and his life changed forever.\n\nIt was toward the end of the '60s that Lee met James Taylor and the pair started playing gigs together. However, when James Taylor’s \"Fire and Rain\" became a huge hit record, Leland Sklar's career also began to take off. The buzz surrounding this new bass player didn't take long to spread around Hollywood, and Leland Sklar quickly became one of the most sought after “A” list session musicians around town.\n\nToday The Immediate Family of which he is a member can legitimately be called a supergroup.\n\nTheir new self-titled full-length album contains twelve original songs, including a rendition of the Waddy Wachtel/Warren Zevon cowrite \"Things to Do in Denver When You're Dead\" and the Danny Kortchmar/Jackson Browne collaboration \"Somebody's Baby.\"\n\nOver the years Leland has worked with most of the top session players in Hollywood and is especially close to his long-time friends and members of The Immediate Family. This iconic supergroup has played together for decades, but never as their own band. Known for their long, illustrious careers backing music's finest, guitarists Danny Kortchmar and Waddy Wachtel, drummer Russ Kunkel, and bassist Leland Sklar have come together, along with guitarist Steve Postell, to perform their own songs as The Immediate Family.\n\nThere is also a documenatry out now simply called The Immediate Family which details their rise to fame.\n\nMeet the inimatable Leland Sklar this week as he shares the story of his meteoric rise to fame.\n\nYou can check out the album here and learn more about Leland on his website https://lelandsklarsbeard.com/ where he also sells lots of different merchandise.\n\nIt's a fascinating episode featuring one of Hollywood's best musicians and nicest guys.

However, he later transitioned to bass guitar, a move that would define his signature sound and role in shaping Cheap Trick's distinctive style.\n\nIn the early 70s, Petersson co-founded Cheap Trick with guitarist Rick Nielsen, drummer Bun E. Carlos, and vocalist Robin Zander. The band quickly gained recognition for their high-energy performances, catchy melodies, and fusion of hard rock, pop, and punk influences.

Ian began singing while still in his teens and was a member of several pub rock bands. It was in one of these that he met bass player Roger Glover, and the two were invited to join Deep Purple in 1969. They debuted with the band in London of the same year. Ian Gillan’s voice was the making of Deep Purple and he was featured on a series of hugely successful recordings including Fireball, Machine Head, Made in Japan and Who Do We Think We Are.\n\nHe also starred on Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's concept album Jesus Christ Superstar where he sang the title role. That album topped the U.S. charts in 1971.\n\nIan Gillan recorded and toured the world relentlessly in those days until he was hospitalised for exhaustion in 1971. He decided to take leave of the band and, just as he left, \"Smoke on the Water\" from Machine Head began making its way up the U.S. charts, where it would peak in the Top Five and go gold, becoming Deep Purple's biggest ever career hit.\n\nIan then bought a recording studio and signed a solo deal with a small record company. He formed the Ian Gillan Band and in 1975, their debut album, Child in Time, entered the charts. Switching record labels, the group simplified its name to Gillan and recorded a series of albums, many of which hit the charts worldwide.\n\nAt the end of 1982, Ian disbanded Gillan, announcing that he had to rest his vocal cords on doctor's orders. The following year, he surprised fans by joining Black Sabbath and recorded their album Born Again. He also began touring with the band. Ian says he was lucky to survive that ongoing party.\n\nIn 1984, the original 1969-1973 line up of Deep Purple got back together. They cut the million-selling Perfect Strangers and the House of Blue Light. In 1989, Ian Gillan again quit the band. That December, he participated in an all-star remake of \"Smoke on the Water\" issued as a charity single which made the British Top 40.\n\nIan Gillan continued to release solo albums. At the end of 1992, he again returned to Deep Purple and the band commenced a world tour. Ian left yet again and in 1998, he released yet another solo album. After 2009's offering, he continued to focus on Deep Purple and didn’t make another solo album for almost a decade.\n\nThese days Ian Gillan remains at the helm of Deep Purple and the album \"Machine Head - Deluxe 50th Anniversary Edition\" has just been released.\n\nThe box set with LP, three CDs, Blu-Ray, booklet and various memorabilia also includes a remastered version of the original mix, a 1972 concert recording from London and a previously unreleased recording from 1971 made at the Casino Montreux which later burned down. It was included, despite its limited sound quality, \"because of its historical relevance\" according to the notes on the back of the box.\n\nDespite all the nostalgia and the loss of his wife a couple of years ago, Ian Gillan is again looking forward. He is currently living on the coast in Portugal and is at work on the band's next studio album - number 23 - with his long-time band mates Roger Glover and Ian Paice. The 78 year old is getting set for yet another Deep Purple tour that’s about to kick off in Australia.\n\nTo learn more about Deep Purple and Ian Gillan head for https://deeppurple.com/ and https://www.ian-gillan.com/\n\nTo request a future guest for A Breath of Fresh Air feel free to reach out to me or if you have comments and feedback https://www.abreathoffreshair.com.au\n\nElliott Randall is one of the greatest guitarists of the Rock era. His solos on Steely Dan’s hit “Reelin’ In The Years” and Irene Cara’s “Fame” are nothing short of iconic.\n\nTo the uninitiated, it might seem like Elliott has made a career out of saying no to great opportunities. Steely Dan, The Doobie Brothers, The Blues Brothers and Toto all asked him to join their bands and he said no.\n\nBut Elliot is different. He has always trusted his intuition. Known as one of the greatest session musicians around, he's the man behind that renowned Reelin' In The Years Steely Dan solo (which is said to be Jimmy Page's favourite ever lead guitar break) among literally hundreds, if not thousands, of other cuts. He also continues to write, produce, consult, engineer, tutor and perform to this day.\n\nIn this interview we turn back the clock to learn about his upbringing in NYC and his passion for music ignited at a young age. During his formative years, Elliott immersed himself in the vibrant musical culture of the 50s and 60s. He took guitar lessons, honed his skills and his dedication caught the attention of instructors and peers alike. By the time he had ended his teens, Elliott had already been a pro' player for four or five years. In 1967, Musicor Records (who gave the world Gene Pitney) offered him a role as a Staff Musician. He then joined the roots fusion act Seatrain briefly in 1969, and signed as a solo artist, releasing his debut album in 1970.\n\nIt was the death of his good friend Jimi Hendrix that helped Elliott realise he didn't need to be the rockstar or the centre of attention so he began working with other artists and clients, providing solutions for their musical and commercial success.\n\nThe most well known four-and-a-half minutes of his guitar life became the lead breaks he added to Steely Dan's megahit Reelin' In The Years in 1972. It has received acclaim from other players and audiences alike.\n\nSince then Elliott Randall has played with Joan Baez, Chuck Berry, Kate Bush, The Doobie Brothers, Peter Frampton, Art Garfunkel, Albert Hammond, Bob Marley, Yoko Ono, Gene Simmons, Loudon Wainright III, Gary Barlow of Take That fame, and many, many more.\n\nHe has also soundtracked jingles for some of world's biggest brands including Coca-Cola, Budweiser, McDonald's, Citi Bank, Procter & Gamble, MTV, ESPN and BBC TV. He's also performed for musicals like Jesus Christ Superstar on Broadway, and has been a musical consultant for Saturday Night Live and the film director Oliver Stone.\n\nElliott's passion for music continues unabated today. His story is fascinating and I hope you will enjoy every minute of it.\n\nTo learn more about Elliott Randall head for his website https://elliott-randall.com/\n\nTo contact me head for my website https://www.abreathoffreshair.com.au\n\nBritish musician Steve Harley, whose glam-rock band Cockney Rebel had an enduring hit with the song Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me), has died at the age of 73.\n\nHarley said late last year he was being treated for “a nasty cancer”.\n\nBorn in London in 1951, Harley worked as a trainee accountant and as journalist on local newspapers, and began his performing career at London folk clubs.\n\nHe formed Cockney Rebel, which released a debut album The Human Menagerie in 1973 before foundering over creative differences. With a new line-up and rebranded as Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel, the band released the 1975 album The Best Years of Our Lives, which contained Harley’s biggest hit.\n\nWith its barbed lyrics – aimed at Harley’s former bandmates – and infectiously catchy chorus, the Alan Parsons-produced Make Me Smile topped the United Kingdom singles chart.\n\nIt went on to be covered scores of times and was used on countless soundtracks, including in the 1997 film The Full Monty and in ads for Carlsberg beer and department store Marks and Spencer.\n\nHarley also sang the title song of Andrew Lloyd Webber’s musical The Phantom of the Opera alongside Sarah Brightman when it was released as a single in 1986. He was originally cast in the title role for the stage musical but was replaced by Michael Crawford.\n\nUltravox frontman Midge Ure, who produced Harley’s 1982 track I Can’t Even Touch You, called him a “true ‘working musician'”.\n\n“He toured until he could tour no more, playing his songs for fans old and new,” Ure wrote on social media.\n\n“My thoughts go out to Dorothy and his family at this very sad time. Our songs live on longer than we ever can”.\n\nHarley is survived by his wife Dorothy, children Kerr and Greta and four grandchildren.\n\nWith his hard, edgy tone, rough and rowdy vocals, and barroom boogie aesthetic, Canadian singer, guitarist, and keyboardist Pat Travers is a fine example of a Canadian bluesy hard rock act.\n\nHe emerged during the '70s heyday of hard blues-rocking guitar heroes. His 8 albums from his 1976 debut through to 1984 netted seven Top 200 chart placements and two Top 40 singles, including the party anthem classic \"Boom Boom (Out Go the Lights).\"\n\nPat is equally adept at playing funk, jazz, and prog and has toured almost annually for more than 40 years.\n\nBorn in Toronto in 1954, Pat first picked up the guitar after seeing a local performance by Jimi Hendrix. He began studying the other top rock guitarists of the day - Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page.\n\nHe then hooked up with '50s rock & roll vet Ronnie Hawkins (best known for performing with a backing band that would eventually become The Band.\n\nBut Travers' first love was hard rock, so he packed up and headed to London. In 1976 his performance at the Reading Festival resulted in two releases before he returned to North America and set his sights on the U.S. rock market.\n\nThe new Travers band lineup led to his most commercially successful period, resulting in a pair of Top 30 releases, including 1980's Crash and Burn.\n\nUnfortunately as the '80s got underway, the music changed and bluesy hard rock wasn't in demand any longer.\n\nPat Travers continued releasing albums but they sold less so he opted to take a break from producing records although he did continue to tour solidly.\n\nAnd he still does.\n\nIn 2022, Travers issued The Art of Time Travel, a return to hard blues-rock.\n\nNumerous controversies and triumphs have only added depth to Pat Travers' storied career, and today his musical journey continues to evolve. His story is not just a biography but a testament to the enduring power of musical expression and the indelible mark one artist can leave on the world.\n\nPat has worked hard to establish his well deserved reputation as being one of the very best hard rock guitarists in the world today.\n\nI hope you enjoy learning about his journey.

The Trio made the Rockabilly name famous by combining the name Billy and his cousin Rocky for the 1953 “Rockabilly Boogie” – thus making the term Rockabilly a household name.\n\nThe legendary trio influenced a diverse array of Rock icons including: the Elvis, Beatles, Led Zeppelin, Rod Stewart, Aerosmith, and Ricky Nelson. Elvis used to spend many evenings jamming with the band. It’s not surprising then that Billy started making music at the age of 7.\n\nAt 15 Billy picked up a guitar and began writing songs. At 18, he was only a week out of high school when he recorded an album with famed Memphis hit-making producer Chips Moman (“Suspicious Minds” and “In the Ghetto” for Elvis).\n\nIn his early 20’s, Billy wrote songs for artists like Rod Stewart, Ray Charles, Roy Orbison, Tammy Wynette, Jerry Lee Lewis, The Everly Brothers, Conway Twitty, Loretta Lynn, Glen Campbell, and many more.\n\nIn 1980, Billy met Mick Fleetwood (of Fleetwood Mac). The two musicians became fast friends and formed the band Mick Fleetwood’s Zoo\n\nSoon after Billy began his journey as a member of one of the greatest rock bands of all time. Billy joined and toured with Fleetwood Mac between 1987-1995, appearing on many of their albums.\n\nIn 2003, Billy co-wrote a tune for Bonnie Raitt and Ray Charles called “Do I Ever Cross Your Mind.” This tune appeared on the album Genius Loves Company, which was the last studio album that Ray Charles recorded and completed. The album garnered 10 Grammy nominations and won Album of the Year.\n\nIn 2006, Billy Burnette returned to his roots and recorded one of the most revered Rockabilly albums of his career, Memphis in Manhattan. He not only recorded several original tunes – but also payed tribute to his father and uncle, by recording “It’s Late” and “Tear it Up.” In addition, he recorded an Everly Brothers classic, “Bye, Bye Love,” and a song made popular by none other than his very own Memphis neighbour, Elvis: “Big Hunk of Love.”\n\nA collaboration with Shawn Camp and Dennis Morgan became the hit song “River of Love.” George Strait recorded the tune for his 2008 album Troubador, and “River of Love” went on to become Strait’s 44th Number One hit single.\n\nIn the last few years, Billy Burnette has contributed his talents as a guitar player and singer on tours with legendary musicians Bob Dylan and John Fogerty. Additionally, he also collaborates regularly with the Mick Fleetwood Band.\n\nBilly continues to write, record and perform today. He lives in Nashville and is still as passionate about making music as he has always been.

After attending a grammar school Arthur studied at University where he focused on law and philosophy. His interest in music began to overwhelm his academic pursuits, and he formed his first band, an R&B combo called Blues and Brown. After a spell in France, where he dabbled in theatre, Arthur returned to the U.K. and worked with a number of groups in London. Not long after Brown left one -the Ramong Sound, they changed their name to the Foundations and scored international hits with \"Build Me Up Buttercup\" and \"Baby, Now That I've Found You.\" Arthur however wasn’t fussed.\n\nHe had Kit Lambert and Pete Townshend produce his self-titled debut album from which “Fire” emerged and The God of Hellfire was born. His band, The Crazy Worldof Arthur Brown was known for its live show, which featured Arthur wearing a helmet that spat fire. Sometimes he would take to the stage naked and as such became one of the most talked-about characters in British rock.\n\nIn the wake of the success of their debut, the band cut a second album and kept touring; for a short while Carl Palmer took over as drummer. Arthur’s next group's sound was darker and even more esoteric than the Crazy World. Arthur then stepped out as a solo act with 1974's Dance with Arthur Brown, a more straightforward and accessible album rooted in international rhythms. His public profile got a boost in 1975 when he was cast as the Priest in Ken Russell's film adaptation of the Who's rock opera Tommy, which was a major box office success. The following year, he made a guest appearance on Tales of Mystery and Imagination: Edgar Allan Poe, the debut album from the Alan Parsons Project. In 1979. Klaus Schulze, of Tangerine Dream invited Arthur to lend vocals to some of his work but in the early '80s, Brown left England to settle in Austin, Texas, where he earned a degree in counseling and opened a music-based practice. He also opened a house painting and carpentry business with Jimmy Carl Black, a former member of Frank Zappa's Mothers of Invention. For the most part, Arthur had stepped away from music, though he and Jimmy Carl Black did team up again for 1988's Brown, Black & Blue, a powerful blues-rock set.\n\nThe new Crazy World returned for 2003's Vampire Suite, and Brown became a regular guest at Hawkwind concerts, appearing on their 2006 album Take Me to Your Future. 2008's The Voice of Love, released under the moniker the Amazing World of Arthur Brown, included guest appearances from Dick Taylor and Mark St. John of the Pretty Things. A spate of archival live releases dominated Arthurs's catalogue in the 2010s as he continued to tour extensively, including dates with Carl Palmer's group ELP Legacy and Hawkwind. Brown returned to recording with his latest edition of the Crazy World for 2014's Zim Zam Zim.\n\nArthur celebrated his 80th birthday in 2022 and today is in hot demand to play concerts and festivals all over Europe.\n\nWe catch up with the iconic artist this week and he regales us with a whole host of interesting stories.\n\nIf you'd like to learn more about Arthur Brown head for his website https://www.thegodofhellfire.com/\n\nand if you'd like to get in touch with me - comments, feedback or requests for future guests - don't hesitate to reach out through my website https://www.abreathoffreshair.com.au\n\nI hope you enjoy the story of The God of Hellfire.\n\nJohn Hall is a founding member of the band Orleans and one of the main instigators of the No Nukes and MUSE (Musicians United for Safe Energy) movements.

Discover the role Ian Meldrum played in transforming a six-and-a-half-minute epic into a chart-topping sensation, defying industry norms.\n\nRussell shares anecdotes from his early days, revealing the supportive environment that fuelled his passion for music. From his unconventional start to becoming an Australian rock legend, this episode is a journey through the highs and lows of a remarkable career.\n\nStarting as a pop sensation in the '60s, Russell faced a tough road ahead when his early hits didn't translate into lasting success. Undeterred, he explored different genres and even went MIA for a while. Fast forward to the '70s, and Russell makes a surprising comeback with the iconic \"The Real Thing.\"\n\nHe shares the wild story behind the creation of the song, involving an LSD trip and a makeshift studio in a houseboat. The success of \"The Real Thing\" catapults him back into the limelight, marking a pivotal moment in his career.\n\nBut it wasn't all smooth sailing.

So, he decided to return to his roots, exploring rhythm and blues, Tamla Motown, and Blues.\n\nHis Blues journey took an unexpected turn when he stumbled upon a 1918 police file photo of Thomas Archer, aka Shark Jaws. Inspired, he turned Archer's story into the blues hit \"Shark Mouth,\" which marked the resurrection of his career.\n\nHis subsequent albums, like \"Van Diemens Land\" and \"Red Dirt, Red Heart,\" defied industry expectations, blending blues and country. Despite initial skepticism, these albums went on to become chart-toppers.\n\nRussell's bluesy revival continued with \"Black and Blue Heart\" in 2019, a pop-rock collaboration with Bernard Fanning and Nick Didier.

The idea, born from an encounter with businessman Clive Palmer, turned out to be a massive success, selling out venues across the country.\n\nRussell's story is one of determination and resolve.

They were a band that placed equal (if not greater) emphasis on horns as guitar and picked up where Blood Sweat & Tears left off.\n\nChicago quickly learned how to channel their expansive sound into concise pop songs, scoring hits in the early 1970s with punchy tunes like \"25 or 6 to 4\" as well as producing sweet melodies like \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\" and \"Saturday in the Park.\" As the ‘70s went on, the band began to emphasise their softer side with bassist Peter Cetera singing mellow standards like \"If You Leave Me Now,\" \"Baby and \"Hard to Say I'm Sorry.\"\n\nThe band kept the same sound after Cetera’s departure in the mid-1980s. They continued touring and producing albums despite the fact that hits dried up in the ‘90s. Despite this, Chicago remained a pop/rock institution, with original members keyboardist Robert Lamm, trumpeter Lee Loughnane and trombonist James Pankow.\n\nOur guest today is Chicago co-founder Lee Loughnane who had been a music student at DePaul University with reed player Walter Parazaider and trombonist James Pankow. The three had moonlighted in St Louis’ clubs, playing everything from R&B to Irish music but it wasn’t long before organist and singer Robert Lamm was asked to join the band. The new group started playing around the Midwest and soon the sextet became a septet when Peter Cetera became the group’s third lead singer.\n\nIn 1968, they moved to Los Angeles and the album Chicago Transit Authority was released. The album reached the Top 20 and was certified gold. It went on to sell more than two million copies. The band shortened its name to Chicago and the second album in 1970 vaulted into the Top Ten even before its first single, \"Make Me Smile,\" hit the Hot 100. It went on to reach the Top Ten, as did its successor, \"25 or 6 to 4.\" The album quickly went gold and eventually platinum. \"Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\" drawn from the group's first album, as its next single; it gave them their third consecutive Top Ten hit.\n\nChicago III came out in 1971, Chicago V in 1972 spending nine weeks at #1, spurred by its gold-selling Top Ten hit \"Saturday in the Park.” The next Top Ten hit, \"(I've Been) Searchin' So Long,\" was released in advance of Chicago VII while Chicago X included the Grammy-winning number one single \"If You Leave Me Now.\" Chicago XI in 1977 generated the Top Five hit \"Baby, What a Big Surprise.\"\n\nBy 1984, the band released the biggest-selling album of its career, Chicago 17. It spawned two Top Five hits, \"Hard Habit to Break\" and \"You're the Inspiration.\" At the turn of the '80s into the '90s, Chicago underwent two more personnel changes. In 1998, they released Chicago 25: The Christmas Album. The band was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2016.\n\nTheir documentary “Now More Than Ever: The History of Chicago\" debuted in 2017. Chicago received a Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award in 2020 and their 38th album was released in 2022.\n\nOur guest today is co-founder Lee"
