        "text": "Gary Leeds, the only true native Californian amongst The Walker Brothers, was born on 9 March 1942 in Glendale, a suburb of Los Angeles, the only child of Jack, an industrial chemist, and his wife Violet.\n\nGary had developed an interest in music during his school days, and at the age of 14, after constantly drumming on the cushions at home, he decided that he would like to concentrate on playing drums. He was very proud of his first drum kit, which was a red wooden set complete with animal skins that used to stretch and tighten depending on the temperature, so Gary was forever adjusting them! He joined the school band for a period of time, but soon formed his own group called The Beltones when the discipline got too much for him, and they had some success locally while still at school. A succession of groups followed over the next few years, and firmly established Gary amongst the constantly changing line-ups of bands around Los Angeles at that time. He joined local group The Standells when they were formed in 1962, and remained with them until he was replaced by former Mousketeer Dick Dodd in 1963, just before they were due to record their first album for Liberty Records.\n\nOne of Gary's earliest claims to fame was standing in on drums for Elvis Presley when they were appearing on the same bill, and Elvis's drummer fell ill. Although his engagement with the Presley band only lasted a short time until the regular drummer was fit enough to resume, it gave Gary a taste of fame and made him realise the possibilities that lay open to him. A later connection with PJ Proby brought Gary to England for the first time in 1964, where he stayed until his work permit ran out. He then returned to California where he resumed drumming on the LA club circuit. During this time Gary visited Gazzari's Club where John Maus and Scott Engel had a residency as The Walker Brothers. Gary suggested that they should join up with him and try their luck in England. After further encouragement from Brian Jones of The Rolling Stones, a regular visitor to Gazzaris, the trio decided to make the trip to the UK. They arrived in London on a cold wintry day in February 1965 as complete unknowns, but by the end of the year The Walker Brothers' popularity rivalled that of The Beatles and The Rolling Stones, and they were mobbed wherever they went.\n\nAt the height of The Walker Brothers' success in 1966 Gary released two singles as a solo artist, \"You Don't Love Me\" and \"Twinkie-Lee\", both of which peaked at No 26 in the charts. Three major UK tours took place during 1966 and 1967 but, after the third one, the group announced that they were splitting up to follow their individual careers.\n\nGary formed his own group, Gary Walker and The Rain, in the autumn of 1967. As band leader, Gary was the driving force in all of the Rain's recording sessions, contributing as songwriter, vocalist and drummer. Their debut single was a cover of the Classics IV song \"Spooky\" released early in 1968. The single release was supported by a lengthy and very successful UK tour with The Kinks, The Herd and The Tremeloes. An extensive tour of Japan followed later that year during which the Gary Walker & The Rain Album No 1 was released. The LP was supported by the release of an EP and two singles, all consisting of songs taken from the album. None of the tracks were ever released other than in Japan, consequently the original Japanese LP is now extremely valuable and rare. A further UK single, an Easybeats song, \"Come In You'll Get Pneumonia\" was released before the group split up early in 1969. Gary was forced to return to the USA because his work permit had expired again, Paul Crane became a producer, John Lawson joined the post-Honeybus group Lace and Joey Molland went on to become a member of Badfinger.\n\nIn 1975 Gary returned to the UK music scene during The Walker Brothers' reunion, which produced the top ten single \"No Regrets\" from the album of the same name. A further two albums, \"Lines\" and \"Nite Flights\", followed, the latter featuring Gary on lead vocals for the self-penned numbers \"Den Haague\" and \"Death Of Romance\". The Walker Brothers parted again in 1978.\n\nGary disappeared from public life, marrying his English wife Barbara on 17 November 1979. During the '80s Gary's artistic talents came to the fore again running his own business making models of castles made from sand blended with Gary's \"secret resin\". The '80s also saw Gary on UK TV once again, making a guest appearance on the ITV game show \"Tell The Truth\" where he totally hoodwinked a rather embarrassed Suzi Quatro. Gary and Barbara's son Michael made his arrival on 17 December 1986. In more recent years Gary has turned his hand to casting and creating models of the Titanic wreck as she now lies at the bottom of the ocean. Gary uses a number of materials for his models, including bronze. Following on from the success of this venture, Gary has also been creating individually commissioned models of the hands of babies, children and newly-weds.\n\nGary received a sensational welcome and three standing ovations when he appeared on stage on 16 July 2005 for the first time in 27 years, at the White Rock Hotel in Hastings with fellow Walker Brother John. Gary performed two memorable numbers from his days with The Walker Brothers: \"Twinkie Lee\" and \"Dizzie Miss Lizzy\". Gary and John were accompanied on stage at the White Rock by Chris Black & Blackcat.\n\nGary returned to the White Rock Hotel, again accompanied by Chris Black & Blackcat, on 3 December 2005. On this occasion Gary fronted the band for an extended set that included his self-penned songs \"Den Haague\" and \"Death of Romance\" from the classic Walker Brothers' album 'Nite Flights' - the first time that any songs from this album have been performed on stage. Amongst other highlights was the finale, \"Land of 1000 Dances\", which has long been associated with Walker Brother shows.\n\nGary is currently working on a number of projects."
