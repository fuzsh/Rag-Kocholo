I wanted him to confirm my 13 year old memory of seeing the band do \"For Your Information\" on what I assumed was the new releases slot on TOTP (shaky teenage memory syndrome) anyway it turned out to be All Systems Freeman. Here is the relevant part of his reply. Hope you find it interesting.\n\n\"Let’s clarify this for you: In 1968 Decca released our first UK Record ‘FOR YOUR INFORMATION’, at the time of release,I think it was November or December 1967,that we appeared on UK BBC TV,on a special music – New Record Releases,and the Show was hosted by ALAN FREEMAN,who at that time was given his own TV Show,and left Top Of The Pops,”Hi Pop-Pickers”,his famous quote. So,we appeared on the First Alan Freeman TV Show which was Recorded at BBC TV STUDIOS IN MANCHESTER – ENGLAND – UK. During that show Herman’s Hermits were promoting their new single,and Bee Gees were promoting their new record ‘WORD’. Micky Most,the manager of Herman’s Hermit,was the judge for predicting how each record will do in the Charts,so he praised Herman’s and Bee Gees’ Records,and said our record will not get to the charts.However,in 1968 our record was No.1 in the Turkish Charts in its English format.lol. Hope this will clarify this point of history\".\n\nPost by Ray Langstone (was saintsray) on\n\nThere is a listing in Getty Images that the Beeb have the pilot (05/01/68), but I am not sure how true that is - even the Beeb have some 'rogue' database entries.\n\n\"\"Title:\n\nALL SYSTEMS FREEMAN:PILOT\n\nCaption:\n\nGuid: LLV5048D\n\nTransmission date:\n\n05 Jan 1968\n\nClip #:\n\nBBC_LLV5048D\n\nSource:\n\nBBC Broadcast Archive\n\nAspect ratios:\n\n4:3\n\nObject name:\n\nBBC_LLV5048D \"\"\n\nI expect inserts are more likely in the digital world, but I will try and contact the Beeb when I have time to check.\n\nPost by Patrick Coles on\n\nGreat info !\n\nas Mary Hopkin sang - those WERE the days, (to me) whatever anyone might say about how great pop music is now...!!\n\nRe that quote by The Cedars drummer - was The Bee Gees 1968 single 'World' not 'Word' ? (They also did 'Words' of course - sung solo by Barry and performed on Ed Sullivan Show in colour, but I don't think that was a 1968 single, correct me if I'm wrong)\n\nI think Mickie Most was probably referring to the UK singles chart not worldwide\n\nA few odd things happened in those days (& later !) re chart placings tho', and a few years later we had the mysterious Christie thing re 'Iron Horse' dropping out of the top thirty despite strong record sales of the single..."
