Western ballads are no stranger to death and bloodshed. Heck, Marty Robbins probably has more people getting shot in his songs than N.W.A. But Seth MacFarlane’s newly released theme song from his mordantly morbid comedy A Million Ways to Die in the West is probably the first ballad dedicated specifically to the act of getting shuffled off the dusty trail of life.

MacFarlane recorded the ditty with country-music star Alan Jackson, and it’s a quick-pickin’ old-timey tune, filled with Elmer Bernstein swells, fiddle sawing, and baritone lines like “six bullets in the gut/or just a paper cut” and “they’ll blast you into shards/for playing good at cards.” Listen to “A Million Ways to Die” below and let us know what you think. After all, you can never go wrong combining westerns and music.

A Million Ways to Die in the West rides into theaters May 30.
