        "text": "Finding the best Westerns of all time was a challenge. There are many incredible authors and stories of how the West was won, of taming the great American frontier, and the realistic fiction stories that capture the harsh terrain and tough characters who had the true grit to tame it. These stories were selected based on reviews, search volume, and feedback from readers. Many of them are also bestsellers.\n\nAs L. Ron Hubbard loved and understood the tradition and spirit of the West, we created this post to share not only a few of his classics in the genre, but some of the amazing stories that make up this well-loved literature.\n\nAs an author, L. Ron Hubbard did not just invent colorful frontier characters—he recreated them, styled to be as authentic as the American frontier folk he remembered from his youth. “I grew up with old frontiersmen,” he recalled, “[with] cowboys, and had an Indian medicine man as one of my best friends.” Indeed, his Montana was a microcosm of the Western frontier, an immense natural expanse that “swallows men up rather easily,” and a place he treasured, in retrospect, for “its do-and-dare attitudes, its wry humor, cowboy pranks, and make-nothing of the worst and most dangerous.” Read a free Western eBook, to see why True West Magazine claims that Mr. Hubbard writes with the “Flair of a Louis L’Amour or Zane Grey.”\n\nIf you love the Wild West or need a great book to read for a Western reader on your list, here are book recommendations and gift ideas that stand among the best Westerns of all time—capturing the adventure and spirit of the Old West:\n\nBuckskin Brigades by L. Ron Hubbard\n\nThe Lewis and Clark murder of a Native American Blackfoot Chief changes the course of history. Experience a panoramic journey across the pages of American history as one white man raised by the Blackfoot, Yellow Hair, undertakes a treacherous adventure across the uncharted wilderness—a thrilling story of a proud, courageous man pushed to the limits of endurance and of a country on the threshold of a bloody conflict that will change it forever. This was a watershed novel in Western fiction for it’s unconventional sympathetic understanding and portrayal of Indian mores, sensibilities and culture, and its powerful historical detail. For more information about Mr. Hubbard’s books and special offers click here.\n\n“Mr. Hubbard has reversed a time-honored formula and has given a thriller to which, at the end of every chapter or so, another paleface bites the dust. An enthusiasm, even a freshness and sparkle, decidedly rare in this type of romance.” —New York Times\n\nHalf Broke Horses by Jeannette Walls\n\n“Those old cows knew trouble was coming before we did.” So begins the story of Lily Casey Smith, Jeannette Walls’ resourceful, no-nonsense, and spectacularly compelling grandmother. Lily, by age six, was helping her father break horses. At fifteen, riding five hundred miles on her pony, alone, she left home to teach in a frontier town. She learned to drive a car and fly a plane. And, with her husband, Jim, she ran a vast ranch in Arizona. Lily survived tornadoes, floods, droughts, the Great Depression, and the most heartbreaking personal tragedy. She bristled at prejudice of all kinds. She raised two children, one who is Jeannette’s memorable mother, Rosemary Smith Walls, unforgettably portrayed in The Glass Castle. Rosemary always told Jeannette that she was like her grandmother, and in this true-life novel, she channels that kindred spirit.\n\n“One of those heartwarming stories about indomitable women.” —Publishers Weekly\n\nUndaunted Courage by Stephen E. Ambrose\n\nHigh adventure, suspense, drama, politics, and diplomacy, combined with romance and personal tragedy, make this outstanding work of scholarship as riveting as a novel. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson selected Captain Meriwether Lewis, his personal secretary, to lead a voyage up the Missouri River to the Rockies, onto the Pacific Ocean, and back. Lewis’ dangerous expedition across this previously uncharted territory was not made alone, he traveled with and was supported by a cast of many: Clark, a rugged frontiersman whose love for Lewis matched Jefferson’s; numerous Indian chiefs; Sacagawea, an Indian girl; John Quincy Adams; the French-Indian hunter Drouillard; the great naturalists of Philadelphia; the French and Spanish fur traders of St. Louis; and many more leading political, scientific, and military figures of the turn of the century.\n\n“Ambrose uses his skill with detail and atmosphere to dust off an icon and put him back on the trail west. History Book Club main selection.” —Publishers Weekly\n\nWild Wild West 10th Anniversary Collection by L. Ron Hubbard\n\nL. Ron Hubbard spent his formative years in a rugged Montana, among the lawmen, cowpunchers, and desperados who would later people his Wild West adventures with remarkable authenticity. Living on the American frontier, he was breaking broncs at a tender age and was among the few whites ever admitted into Blackfoot society as a blood brother. He wrote tales of integrity, honor, and courage of the American West. This collection includes ten of these original short stories, in four volumes.\n\n“Bears comparison to such notable Western writers as Max Brand, T. T. Flynn, and Alan Le May.” —Booklist\n\nAs our gift, get your free eBook download of L. Ron Hubbard’s Western The Ghost Town Gun-Ghost, where Old Pokey Mackay joins forces with a young gunslinger—just one step ahead of the law—to thwart a gang of outlaws who have plans of their own for the ghost town of Pioneer.\n\nWestern books\n\nWestern books, while historical fiction, often focus on the latter half of the 19th century in the Western United States or have similar characters and themes—depicting life on the American frontier, taming of the Old West, and people with the charisma and daring approach to life this era is most remembered for.\n\nWhile we focused on literature, the early Western movies with John Wayne and Gene Autry, and the TV series like Bonanza and Little House on the Prairie (and even the recent Netflix hit, Longmire), have all contributed to the popularity of Westerns. The genre includes Western frontier books, classic Westerns, comedy Westerns, romantic Westerns, contemporary Westerns, epic Westerns, and stories about Native American Indians, pioneers, ranchers, cowboys, gamblers, gunslingers, and outlaws.\n\nThese Western book recommendations are only a glimpse of this amazing literature, but each story is a gem that will be read again and again. Please share your comments and let us know if you have a favorite we missed.\n\nYou may be interested in:\n\nL.
