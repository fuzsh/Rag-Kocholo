        "text": "Cellion wrote:\n\nI'd love a proper heist + cyberpunk adventure, with expanded/fixed hacking rules, lots of high quality joint-casing, infosphere sleuthing, and so on. And then really high quality infiltrations.\n\nWhat I've found from existing Starfinder \"heist-themed\" adventures is that they always account for the 4x soldiers team. You can always break in and do a bunch of combats and get out. I'd want a heist adventure where straight up fights are deeply inadvisable.\n\nI feel this! The rules, as they are, are not gret for this premise, though - once a combat starts or a PC is spotted, it's basically impossible for an alarm not to be raised, considering everyone has a comm unit integrated into their armour. Even things like comm jammers are fairly indiscriminate and should tip off guards to their presence once activated. Even accounting for like, Subtle sniper rifles and such, it all comes down to \"can the party incapacitate all guards within 1 surprise round.\" If not, it's a given that the first thing competent guards will do is radio in to sound the alarm. And NPCs are designed with enough HP that dropping them in 1 Surprise Round is challenging, especially if there's >1 NPC.\n\nI understand that Mark of the Mantis has some really slick mechanics for stealth, investigating a location, and preparing for obstacles, which circumvents a lot of those problems. I wonder if that could be applied to a Starfinder heisty stealthy adventure? Or, bring in some sort of 4E-style \"minion\" concept for guards, so that it's plausible (and maybe even expected) to be able to take out a foe in 1 or 2 shots, rather than however-many 'hits' an at-APL foe is supposed to be able to absorb?\n\nI'll be honest, a lot of my various \"itches\" for Starfinder stories are already scratched by various APs already, like Horizons of the Vast for my space city building itch, Attack of the Swarm! for my Mass-Effect-military-style itch, and Fly Free or Die for my working-class-hero-in-space itch.\n\nOne of the only itches left is something that's probably too niche for a full six book AP; a Grand Prix storyline in the vein of F-Zero, Speed Racer or the podrace sequence in The Phantom Menace, where the players get to customize their own cool racing vehicle, meet a colorful cast of alien racer NPCs, and race on a variety of different tracks on different worlds, each with their own unique environments and obstacles! Side-stories involving drama between racers, sponsors and other personalities, people trying to get the PCs to throw a race or sabotage them!\n\nI feel like it'd be a very, VERY hard concept to pull off for a number of reasons, though: it depends on the GM doing a lot of the legwork for all the other racers and everyone else attached to the racing scene, it doesn't leave much room for the mandatory space combat encounters, there'd need to be a way for every PC to be involved in the race sequences besides just the player in the driver's seat, and even then, having them all do the same thing each race would get boring, even if the locations and hazards change each time, so I'm not sure there'd be enough \"story\" to fill even a 3-part AP, let alone a 6-part one...\n\n@NameViolation\n\nI agree with your suggestion, adding to it probably the crash occurs after a drift drive malfunctioning during transfer back to normal space, exiting into an unknown world in the vast. It also damages the drift drive significantly enough that it can't be fixed without uncovering some relatively rare components. (at least rare on this world)\n\nAfter a book or two they might be able to repair the ship enough to use it to travel along the planet. After another one or two they gain capability to travel up to the world's moon(s)/ring(s)/satellite(s)/station(s).\n\nMight introduce a planetary gate somewhere in one book, allowing them to jump personally to a new world to get another component. Maybe that world might be littered with some 'mechs' and giant robot monsters. that might be guarding useful components.\n\nThe end of the AP you finally get to then end and discover someone trapped you in the system... responsible for your getting pulled there. Turns out they are trapped and are hoping for a rescue. [do the players assume the person responsible for pulling them and creating the situation that trapped them, is evil?]\n\nThe individual needing rescued has the last component needed to fix the drift drive, and they can then finally leave and return 'heroes' or at least potentially more wealthy now they know where a system that can be scavenged from.\n\nThe adventure that I always wanted to play for Starfinder would be a homage to Wizard in Spite of Himself/Warlock of Gramarye by Christopher Stasheff.\n\nPCs crash land on a planet that never left medieval times, using primarily magic with very limited technology, similar to Old Golarion.\n\nThe ship itself is a huge science vessel, so there's adventures related to what the PCs brought with them by accident (lab creature escapes, disease, etc.). The ship also has UPB stashes and fabricators so the party can upgrade their equipment without relying on local stuff entirely. Needless to say, using lasers and plasma guns and flame doshkos and whatnot give the PCs a rep as magicians of a sort.\n\nThe PCs get introduced to various planetary factions which try to claim their ship and the secrets within. Politics ensues.\n\nPerhaps they meet other stranded (or not so stranded) space travelers, or find the facility of some ancient spacefarers, possibly leading to the mystery of the planet, and why it resembles Golarion.\n\nAnyway I figure now that we have Galactic Magic it would be a good time for this adventure path, since even nanocytes can now lean into the magic part of the setting and archery is a valid combat style.\n\nFor an AP, how about, you wake up in a stasis bed. You know more or less who you are up to a certain age, but you don't know why you are where you are. You wake up with several others in a stasis bed/medical bay. You aren't allowed out until the droids give you a clear medical report (which is close to just time spent) but even if the droids get destroyed, the door will eventually unlock. You appear to be a crew of a ship. But the computer/robots refuse to provide you with any information/communication from outside the room.\n\nWhen you do get out, you find the ship outside is badly damaged. There are potentially signs of fighting, potentially signs of biohazard conditions, likely even signs that there may have been fighting between members of the ships crew. (but maybe also signs of some external hostile)\n\nThe crew works to get the ship back into control. Works to get their memory back, and look for their way home. (or maybe this is a colony ship, and the end will require fighting to carve out a space for the colonists to be able to survive on the surface of their new home.\n\nThere are plenty of potential hidden truths that could be under the story. Maybe it was actually a prison ship, holding frozen political dissidents that were stashed away, and the original society decided it was time to dispose of the no longer needed non-conforming citizens and so they were being sent to be decommissioned and some 'agents' managed to redirect the ship but died achieving it.\n\nAlternately, it could be that the stasis beds were an experimental time travel device that the current colonists decedents finally managed to finalize. They send you back in time, to be the saviors of their history. Armed with the knowledge to make the future an even better place since you know what mistakes you made. What wasn't known was that your brain undergoes a strange change through time travel and you forget such details. And this explains why in your history of your past, you made decisions that appeared to be mistakes to those from the future.\n\nBut the question is, will you meet the destiny of saving your people, or will you prove time travel doesn't work, and doom your future to an untold story that they will never know they had it better. (or was it worse, who knows)\n\nOr maybe you were intended to be the Coupe de Grace destroying the ship... being a planted team of insurgents/spies intending to destroy this colony after the ship goes into lockdown due to the arranged set of catastrophe's it was set upon with. However, a glitch causes them to lose their recent memory and mission profile. This leaves them only with the 'covert/cover' information of the team being the 'trouble' team to take care of, an fix the ship and get things back/right in the end. Leaving them until the end before they have a chance to understand 'who' they were really before the mission, and what the original goals were. Do they about face and honor their original goals, or do they honor who they have since chosen to become, and continue to save the lives of all those they have met and become friends with?\n\n(sorry if I am giving too many spoilers for the concepts)\n\nSo I would want to have a campaign that has a strong focus on starship combat, specifically with the party members manning individual fighters instead of the usual Star Trek vibe.\n\nStorywise, it would take place during the early wars of the Veskarium establishing itself on other planets. Specifically, on the planet to-be-named Vesk 6. It would focus on the war between the vesk and the pahtra.\n\nIn the spirit of Hell's Vengeance and Hell's Rebels, it would consist of two half-APs that have interweaving timelines. One through the point of view of pahtra defenders, which might have the feel of a Star Fox game. The other side would feature a group of vesk-aligned pilots, and might feel a bit more like an Ace Combat game.\n\nYou start off as a ragtag group, salvage/earn better equipment, and deal with corruption and mismanagement within your own organization while also dealing with external threats and probably some kind of rival squadron on the opposing side.\n\nAs a sort of prequel adventure, the ultimate ending would be pretty obvious, but I'd like to add a special Epilogue to each side to give some form of closure to their adventures."
