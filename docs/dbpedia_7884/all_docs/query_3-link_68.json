        "text": "La Abadia de Berzano\n\nBy Santiago Aguilar\n\nJune 20, 2023\n\nSynopsis: Tom the Good and Tom the Bad, whose physical features are identical, are in Torrejón City, a town in the far West.\n\nOriginal title: Torrejón City\n\nYear: 1962 (Spain)\n\nDirector: León Klimovsky General Production Manager: Esther Cruz\n\nScreenwriters: Rafael J. Salvia, Manuel Tamayo, Ramón Barreiro, Antonio de Lara \"Tono\", José Antonio Verdugo Torres, León Klimovsky\n\nPhotography: Manuel Hernández Sanjuán\n\nMusic: Gregorio García Segura\n\nCast: Tony Leblanc (Tom Rodriguez, the Good / Tim Rod, the Bad), May Heatherly (Ruth), Antonio Garisa (Uncle Sam), Beni Deus (Doug), Venancio Muro (the prosecutor), Francisco Morán (Mac, the owner of the saloon), Mara Lasso (Peggy), Mary Begoña (a girl from the saloon), Xan das Bolas (Hawkeye), Luis Sánchez Polack \"Tip\" (the undertaker), Esther Cruz \"Himilce\" (another girl from the saloon), José Canalejas (a Mexican), Simón Arriaga (Vulture), Antonio Moreno (Sheriff Morris), Antonio Peral, José Luis Zalde, José Luis Heredia, Luis Alonso, Agustín Bescos, María Álvarez, Enrique Núñez, Víctor Iregua...\n\nAt the beginning of the sixties, sandwiched between the classic aftertaste westerns shot in Spain by Michael Carreras or Joaquín Luis Romero Marchent and the emergence of spaghetti-western, we find the handcrafted pieces of the genre invoiced by Ricardo Blasco, Ramón Torrado, José María Elorrieta or León Klimovsky. They are, for the most part, films of Indians and cowboys that transfer to the screen the topics of the novels that José Mallorquí and Marcial Lafuente Estefanía kiosk —saving the distances— and supply the product to the growing number of theaters with programs in continuous session that cover the leisure offer in new and old neighborhoods of the cities of developmental Spain.\n\nKlimovsky, who has developed his career in Spain during the fifties based on comedies with some estimable incursion into the field of intrigue, will make between 1962 and 1964 two westerns for the producers of Emilio Lárraga and Esther Cruz: Tyrys Films and the Carthago Film Cooperative. The Argentine filmmaker did not have them all with him. The mythology of the frontier was totally alien to him. So the first of them, Torrejón City (1962), points directly to parody, and the second, Fuera de la ley (1964), aims to transcend the legend of Billy the Child:\n\nI think the solution I found, Klimovsky explained years later, was to give depth to the film, that is, to forget the myth for children, the western for big children, and make a deep film that referred not only to the American western, but that could also happen among the blacks of Africa. And I think that, in this sense, I succeeded. That is, universalizing the subject, the problem. I think it was a good action movie[1].\n\nWe cannot agree. If something has gone down in history Outside the law is because it served as an excuse for the construction of the West town Lega-Michelena in the Dehesa de Navalvillar, in the municipality of Colmenar Viejo[2]. The clichés accumulate: ranchers who put barbed wire to protect their lands, villains who murder in cold blood whoever is put in front of them, venal sheriffs, horseback riding worthy of a serial ... Daniel J. White's unfortunate score reinforces the parodic tone of the ensemble. And yet, it is not a parody, like his first western. Klimovsky sticks to the falsilla without any irony.\n\nThe most reliable clue about the origin of Torrejón City must be sought in the populous poster dedicated to the plot and the script in the credits. Among the six accredited librettists are the humorist Antonio de Lara \"Tono\", one of the fathers of New Humor back in the twenties and founder of La Codorniz, and the now forgotten film parodist Ramón Barreiro. Tono serves as a link with Eduardo García Maroto's short pre-war parodies Una de... (1934-1936) —with the collaboration of Miguel Mihura in the literary part—, resumed in 1954 with Tres eran tres, which weaves parodies of monsters, Spanish and western, with Xan das Bolas doing the Indian and Manolo Morán in the role of cowboy who will end up putting a ventorro with organ in an Arkansas meadow that looks suspiciously like Madrid. Country House.\n\nFor his part, Barreiro has perpetrated in the mid-forties three tapes dedicated to parody the serial of oriental adventures, pirate movies and, of course, the western. Don Buffalo Bill's Nephew (1944) plays with the same tricks as The Marx Brothers in the West (Go West, Edward Buzzell, 1940): the plane of the gold mine, the contrast between the saloon singer and the good girl, the corruption of the powerful, the naïve hero, a secret from the past... The difference is that the eccentric humor of the Americans is exchanged in the Spanish film in subversion of the common places of the genre, with an abundance of anachronisms and puns. We thus approach the universe of the musical revue and this is where the double prominence of Tony Leblanc in Torrejón City comes into play. During all the fifties the Madrid actor has combined his film career with the magazine. For what interests us here is fundamental I have formal mummy, semi-improvised musical comedy premiered at the Teatro Fontalba in 1952 and in which Leblanc shares the stage with Miguel Gila and José Luis Ozores. Other milestones in this decade are Lo verá y lo cantarás in 1954, Luis Escobar's revue Te espero en Eslava, from 1957, and the return with Gila already in 1960 with Este y yo... Limited Company.\n\nAs is often the case in the magazine since the premiere of La Gran Vía at the Teatro Apolo in 1886, today plays a major role in this type of show. In 1953 commercial and military agreements were signed that allowed impoverished Spanish society to access US economic aid in exchange for the military giant establishing a quadruple bridgehead in the Mediterranean, thanks to the bases euphemistically called \"joint use\" of Morón, Rota, Zaragoza and Torrejón de Ardoz. In this air base near Madrid, Ike Eisenhower – the first president of the United States to visit Spain – will land in December 1959 so that Franco can take a mass bath touring all of Madrid in an open car in his company. The arrival of the US military to the capital has meant a small convulsion in customs and the appearance of a neighborhood around Doctor Fleming Street and the emblematic Corea building that will become a symbol of modernity and dishevelment.\n\nThis contrast between tradition and modernity is at the base of Torrejón City. Leblanc stars in a story full of westerniles clichés where anachronisms compete with the continuous allusions to Spanish daily life: the portrait of Abraham Lincoln shares a wall with that of Cúchares, the clients of the saloon play mus and in Alcalá de Henares, where Tom el Bueno, democracy is a dispute between Cánovas and Sagasta.\n\nThe emblematic films of the genre, such as Assault and robbery of a train (The Great Train Robbery, Edwin S. Porter, 1903) or Alone in the face of danger (High Noon, Fred Zinnemann, 1952), share criteria of referentiality with what Tom the Good reads \"to catch the dream\", an adventure of \"The Guardian of the West\", one of the comics that included the comics of the Águila Blanca collection of the editorial of the Mexican newspaper La Prensa. That is, a hodgepodge of aúpa with which, nevertheless, the spectator of 1962 could feel fully identified. Another thing is the arrhythmias that produce such heterogeneous samples in the story and that today considerably unbalance its narrative effectiveness. The comedian is weighed down by the twist that occurs when Tom the Good and Tim the Bad fall in love with the same girl (May Heatherly) and the latter renounces her:\n\n\"Goodbye, may you be very happy.\n\n\"It turns out he was better than any.\n\n\"Nonsense! The good guy is the one who stays with the girl. It doesn't fail.\n\n\"And where do you plan to go now, cousin?\"\n\n\"I will return to the land of my ancestors... To the Torrejón for real. Do you think I have a future there as an American?\n\n\"How would I tell you!\n\nXan das Bolas and Tip —who were already in Tres eran tres— put on the Indian chief's plume and the undertaker's hat respectively. Mary Begoña, vedette of Antonio Garisa's magazine company, is one of the girls of the saloon. The presence of Garisa in the role of the uncle of the girl – Uncle Sam, there would be more – relates Klimovsky's commitment to An Island with Tomato, a path that Leblanc will travel again in his increasingly numerous television interventions, but that in the cinema will hardly have an echo in The dynamite is served (Fernando Merino, 1968), taking as iconographic reference Bonnie and Clyde (Bonnie and Clyde, Arthur Penn, 1967).\n\nSantiago Aguilar\n\n[1] Antonio Gregori: Spanish cinema according to its directors. Madrid: Cátedra, 2009, p. 18.\n\n[2] In the foundation of the town of Hoyo de Manzanares at this time have to see three other parodic westerns co-produced by Eduardo Manzanos and starring Walter Chiari and Raimondo Vianello: El sheriff terrible / Due contro tutti (Antonio Momplet [and Alberto De Martino], 1962), Héroes del Oeste / Gli eroi del West (Steno, 1963) and Los gemelos de Texas / I gemelli del Texas (Steno, 1964).\n\nPassion Cinema\n\nBy Angelo D’Ambra\n\nJune 18, 2023\n\n“I am a circus performer lent to the cinema, son of Fausto Dell'Acqua and Giovanna Huesca, sister of the great clown Nené, unforgettable star of the Togni Circus, an artist moved by a special force that, advanced in years, still pushed him to perform at the Medrano”. This is how Alberto Dell'Acqua begins. With great availability he accepts our questions and begins to navigate in memories, in that dreamy sea of images of memory and emotions of the heart. This star of Italian cinema, a well-known face of the Spaghetti western, still carries all the determination of the circus people: \"My family in the years of the Second World War had its own circus, rather large, the Circo Impero which went bankrupt. Slowly, associated with Leone Martini, they got back into the game with Circo Demar and it was there that my brothers and I debuted.\n\nHe says that he started performing under the tent as a very young age, following his family and dedicating himself to a plurality of disciplines: “I debuted as a juggler in a troupe number with my brother Arnaldo and my sisters Clara and Fernanda, who later became trapeze artists. My other six brothers and sisters also became artists in our family circus. The feedback from the audience was exceptional. I remember that in 1961, with two troupe numbers, we were awarded as best jugglers and cyclists at the Teatro Sistina with the Silver Mask, on an evening attended by prominent actors such as Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. Over the years I had also dedicated myself to acrobatics, perfecting myself as a trampoline jumper paired with my brother Roberto, aka Ridolini. We were a very close-knit couple, so much so that we put on another lucky number of fallers, but we dedicated ourselves to every circus discipline so much so that in Portogruaro with Roberto I also presented a number of rings. Ours was a family circus and we had to adapt to doing more numbers. Cinema burst into my life in 1964, but I wouldn't be far from the circus. In 1977, in fact, returning from Colombia from my last film, I reunited with my family on a caravan trip to Calabria. It was supposed to be a simple holiday, just relaxation and fun at the Camping \"Le Mimose\", instead we came across the posters of the Royal Circus of my cousins and the call of sawdust was so strong that we decided to go and spend three days with them. Those three days became seven years.\"\n\nHe found his roots. \"Yes, the joy of when I was a child returned to me. I was under a tent again, back at the circus, again with my family. My children integrated perfectly, and I began to teach them. With some tips and a lot of work, in a few months they managed to express excellent artistic qualities. In the meantime, with my wife and sister, I returned to juggling and we also set up a rag woman number. I was the presenter of that show. Over the years my daughter Doriana became a talented trapeze artist. At the age of thirteen she performed in London enjoying great success. She worked at the Robert Brothers Circus, where my great cousin Gianni Fumagalli was also paired with his brother Daris. Back in Italy we worked at the circus of the Huesca brothers, also my cousins, the Budapest Circus which, unfortunately, near Arezzo, exactly in Camucia, a hamlet of the municipality of Cortona, was overwhelmed by a violent storm. It ended up being destroyed. I can't deny that the impact of certain events on the morale of a circus is devastating, but we rolled up our sleeves and put on a fun show called \"Long Live the Laughter.\" The Lazio Coast responded with great participation. Our paths diverged there. My cousins under the direction of the Circus Medrano of the Casartelli brothers reached Greece, while my family and I returned to the Royal Circus of Loris and Rudy Dell'Acqua. We stayed there for a few years refining and retouching the juggling and trapeze numbers of my daughter Doriana. While My son Massimiliano perfected himself with a juggling number with clubs, balloons and cigar boxes. The result was a number worthy of Kris Cremo that literally amazed the audience. We planned to open our own circus, but, after buying all the material, my daughter married Massimo Carbonari and, a few months later, Massimiliano married Debora Orfei, daughter of the great Amedeo. My grandchildren renew the great family tradition, Yasmin, the daughter of Maximilian, for example, is an important antipodist awarded with the Silver Clown at the Monte Carlo Festival. Now the energies of my family are all in the Enchanted Circus, a fresh formula poised between the classicism of circus expressiveness and theater».\n\nLet's talk about cinema now. How did it all start? \"I owe my move to cinema to the great master of arms, Freddy Unger. It was he who wanted me as a stuntman for the first time in a feature film entitled \"I malamondo\", in 1964, produced by Titanus and set to music by Ennio Morricone. I was eighteen years old. Freddy took me under his wing and that same year he proposed me to the director Antonio Margheriti for the part of Publio Valerio in the film \"The Giants of Rome\", with Richard Harrison. So, the doors of the cinema opened to me. I remember that the assistant director of \"I malamondo\", Franco Giraldi, who in the meantime had become a director, the following year had Alfio Caltapiano search for me among the circus people. When it became known thanks to Rinaldo Zamperla that I was with my family's circus at La Storta, a village in Rome, I was reached by Giraldi with a proposal to audition for a western. It was the movie \"7 Guns for the MacGregors\". Everything went well, he liked me, and he took me for the film we went to shoot in Spain.\"\n\nI remember that movie well... \"Wait. There I had my first serious work accident. While I was galloping with one foot in the stirrup, to shoot a scene, the girth of the saddle broke, I fell hitting my head and I was trampled by the horses of the other actors, that is, the other MacGregor brothers. One of them, Nazzareno Zamperla, who shared with me a circus origin, rushed to help me, but I yelled at him not to touch me because I was all broken. I remember that Giraldi and the whole crew ran towards me, they remained there waiting for the ambulance that then took me to the hospital of Guadix, where they found the crack of five ribs and two fractures to the skull. By a special train they then transferred me to Madrid to the \"Victoria Clinic\" they discovered that I also had a fracture of two vertebrae of the cervical spine. They tied me to the litter box and told the producer to hope the night would pass without problems. Thanking God, it was so. After a few days I was plastered, and I was transferred to Rome in a traumatology center in Garbatella. The doctors removed the cast made in Madrid to make a new one from head to bust that I wore for four months. The film had been suspended until my recovery and when we resumed shooting, on the first day at Cinecittà, apart from the celebrations of the whole crew, the director Franco Giraldi, as terrified, explained to me that I would not ride. He said to me, \"Do you see Alberto? Now we're going to shoot the scene where you're on horseback, but you're actually riding a scaffolding and it looks like you're on horseback.\" I gave him my assent, but when I approached the horse, I climbed on his back and got into position to turn. The crew cheered me on. We shot the scene without any problems and finished the film.\"\n\nFortunately, everything went well, he risked a lot. What about the directors, what can you tell me about them? He quoted Giraldi Margheriti. What relationship did you have with them? \"I had a professional, natural and trouble-free relationship with everyone. I worked with Gianfranco Baldanello and Fernando Baldi, with Mario Siciliano I made three films, \"Trinità e Sartana figli di...\", \"Quel pomeriggio maledetto\" and \"Alleluja e Sartana figli di... God.\" I didn't feel good with only one director, it was Giuseppe Colizzi. With the directors you always compare yourself to give luster to the character you have to play, to give it greater depth. All this is very important, it is rewarding for the actor because it helps him to express himself at his best. For example, in the film \"Texas Addio\", produced by the great Manolo Bolognini and directed by Professor Baldi in 1966 with Franco Nero and Elisa Montes, I had the opportunity to play a character that gave me so much satisfaction, the gunslinger Jim Sullivan. I can say the same for \"Ammazzali tutti e torna solo\" by Enzo Girolami Castellari.\n\nThenhe reveal to me a curiosity about the language used. He has shot films in Spain, Colombia, Turkey and with artists of various nationalities. What language was he acting in? \"In some films I used English as in \"The Long Days of Hate\" and \"Son of Sandokan\", but in general on the set you play each one in his own language. So, it was also in Turkey where I played three action films as a protagonist, with good Turkish actors. In one of the three, among other things, I broke my wrist while doing a deadly jump in pirouettes. I also shot two adventure films in Colombia and in one of them I came out of one and went to work on the other, a wonderful feeling a thousand meters high.\n\nSpeaking of these action shots, I consider him, especially with regard to spaghetti-westerns, a much more important figure than you might imagine. Proof of this is the fact that in all films, even when he had no leading roles, his presence was characteristic, he was a brand, he became an element of distinction of the entire film. As if the director was fascinated by his acrobatic skills. In all the films there is always the scene of the jump or the somersault, the most dynamic moment, the liveliest sequence. You are an actor who has left his mark because you know that when there is a film with Alberto Dell'Acqua you will find certain characteristics. \"As far as the action scenes are concerned, Castellari is really a great director, perhaps because he too was an athlete. I made eleven westerns, including two as a protagonist \"Trinity and Sartana Sons of...Bitches\" and \"Alleluja and Sartana Sons of... God\" and yes, in fact in all of them my acrobatic skills emerge. The action scenes in the films I played were invented by me and my master of arms, Freddi Unger first of all, Nazzareno Zamperla, with whom I made three western films, and then Nando Poggi, to whom I was very attached and who worked with me in six films. A great man as well as a master of arms. I also made a couple of films in which I am a circus artist as in \"Boot Hill\". I also found the detective stories \"Il braccio violento della mala\", where I am the protagonist, \"Quel pomeriggio maledetto\", with Lee Van Cleef, and the very nice \"Il figlio di Zorro\", with Fernando Sancho».\n\nAt the end of this long chat, if I had to ask him to choose between cinema and circus, what would you say? \"It's a question that puts me in difficulty. Cinema has given me a lot of notoriety and money. It allowed me to travel the world, but my love for the show is called circus. What I experienced, what I knew and what I still draw from circus life is a complete feeling and, in many ways, difficult to communicate. And even today, with an age and its ailments, I live the circus through my children and my grandchildren, protagonists of the beautiful show of the Enchanted Circus”."
