        "text": "Albion family’s innovation for milking cows named finalist in Grow-NY competition\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 17 August 2024 at 10:39 pm\n\nALBION – An invention by an Albion dairy farmer and his two sons is among 20 finalists in food and agriculture startups from around the world.\n\nUdderWays LLC in Albion is competing with 19 others to win a combined total of $3 million in prize money in Grow-NY, a business competition focused on enhancing the emerging food, beverage and agriculture innovation cluster in upstate New York.\n\nThere were 312 startups that applied from 26 states, and 50 countries. There were 89 entries from New York.\n\nJody Neal and his sons Zachary and Jayden have formed UdderWays. They finished second in January in an agricultural innovation challenge at the American Farm Bureau Federation annual meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah.\n\nThe Neals developed a new system to sanitize and prepare udders for milking. The Neals have already won a $20,000 prize for second place in the American Farm Bureau competition.\n\nJody Neal is a partner a Poverty Hill Farms in Albion, a dairy farm on East County House Road. His sons were active in the Orleans County 4-H Robotics program, where they learned programming and tech skills as part of a team that competed in the Rochester region.\n\nThe Neals worked on their udder cleaning system for nearly a decade. The device is used just before a cow is milked. Their invention uses a unique, brushless technology to gently stimulate cows and ensure clean and dry teats, the family states on their website.\n\nEmpire State Development and Cornell University’s Center for Regional Economic Advancement announced the 20 finalists year six of Grow-NY. Winning companies will be required to make a positive economic impact in the Grow-NY region, which comprises 22 counties located in Central NY, the Finger Lakes, and the Southern Tier regions.\n\nA Genesee County-based company also is among the finalists. Zordi in Oakfield builds autonomous greenhouses with robots and AI to make high-quality produce.\n\nState Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball, said, “From farming to food production, New York is an innovative, world-class leader in agriculture. Year after year, the Grow-NY competition is instrumental to bringing new, high-growth businesses in the industry focused on critical areas to our state. This event has once again brought to light just how critical agriculture is to our communities and to our economy, and I congratulate these finalists on their innovation that will help bolster our food systems, feed our communities, and move our state forward.”\n\nA panel of 30 judges with knowledge of the region’s agriculture and food production communities, and entrepreneurial experience, reviewed all the applications to determine the top 20 finalists that will pitch their business plans at the Grow-NY Food and Ag Summit in Ithaca in November.\n\nGrow-NY will award a total of $3 million in prize money to seven winners. This includes a $1 million top prize, two $500,000 awards, and four $250,000 prizes.\n\nTo see the other finalists for Grow-NY, click here.\n\nReturn to top\n\nHail took big bite out of Orleans County apple crop\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 17 August 2024 at 11:06 am\n\n‘In some spots this is the worst damage I’ve ever seen’\n\nGAINES – It’s a word fruit farmers fear: hail.\n\nThose fast-moving pellets from the sky can turn a crop, that has been months in making, into a largely worthless field of ruin.\n\nLast Sunday hail hit in the afternoon and it left a swath of destruction for farmers, especially those near Route 104.\n\nJim Kirby and his son Adam grow 170 acres of apples, as well as other vegetable and grain crops. About 100 acres of their apples were pummeled by the hail, including their most valuable apples, the Honeycrisp. They were going to start picking some of those apples this week.\n\nInstead they were reaching out to their insurance agent, and trying to calculate the losses.\n\n“This is a heart-breaker for me,” Jim Kirby said looking at a block of apples along Lattin Road. “This is a bumper crop of Honeycrisp. But it five minutes it’s all over.”\n\nKirby and a crew of 12 workers spent the previous three weeks hand-thinning Honeycrisp apples, removing some so the others would max out on size and color.\n\nBut the storm left apples with many bruises and cuts. Sometimes hail will leave one or two bruises on an apple. This time the apples have 20 or more bruises, showing they were hammered by the hail. They can’t be sold on the fresh market for top dollar. They could go for juice, but that market will now be saturated and it may not pay to have workers pick those apples and then haul them for processing, Kirby said.\n\nThe storm was especially brutal for many apple farms in Orleans County, but also damaged corn, soybeans and vegetables, said Larry Meyer, the Farm Service Agency director in Orleans County.\n\nHe has been working for the FSA for 41 years. The Sunday hail storm cut a wide path of damage, but also missed some fields and orchards as it moved from Niagara, through Orleans and further east.\n\n“In some spots this is the worst damage I’ve ever seen,” he said. “There is a lot of loss in the county. The people who got hit got hit real bad.”\n\nMeyer expects a federal disaster declaration will be issued which will allow for emergency low-interest loans for farmers without crop insurance.\n\nMany of the farms now have private insurance, which can cover up to 65 percent of the crop’s value. Meyer said the apple market has very tight profit margins this year. The crop insurance will help the farmers, but still leaves them in a difficult position, especially when they were so close to harvest.\n\nMeyer said farmers are in a better position to recover from the losses, compared to previous years. He recalled the Labor Day wind storm of 1998 that decimated the local apple crop. At the time the federal government to assist apple farms with disaster aid and there wasn’t private insurance to help cover the loss of an apple crop.\n\nAbout a quarter of the apple farms went out of business in Orleans County after that storm.\n\nBut this time most of the farms have their own crop insurance, and the federal government can provide some disaster aid for the others.\n\nThe FSA is working to try to determine the extent of the damage.\n\n“This was a long storm,” he said. “It had a lot of energy and it kept going.”\n\nApples and other fruit totaled $59.0 million in revenue for Orleans County farmers in 2022, according to the U.S. Agricultural Census. Orleans County’s total ag revenue is $233.6 million.\n\nReturn to top\n\nChamber holds annual wine walk at Robin Hill Preserve\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 17 August 2024 at 9:40 am\n\nPhotos by Tom Rivers\n\nLYNDONVILLE – Tricia Daluisio of Leonard Oakes Estate Winery serves wine on Thursday evening to Cheryl Seipel of Lyndonville and Denise Appleby of Waterport.\n\nLeonard Oakes was one of four wineries featured in the Orleans County Chamber of Commerce’s annual wine garden walk at the Robin Hill Preserve on Platten Road in Lyndonville. Dubby’s Wood Fired Pizza also was there, serving pizza.\n\nRay Wendling, owner of North Ridge Distillery, gives a sample to Christine Speedy. Wendling started North Ridge five years ago and now offers about a dozen varieties.\n\nPaul Schwenk, owner of Schwenk Wine Cellars in Kent, had samples available from several wines. Schwenk has been a wine-maker for 46 years and offers 26 varieties of wine.\n\nBryan DeGraw, co-owner of 810 Meadworks, offered samples of mead, a honey-based alcoholic beverage. 810 Meadworks has six meads that are available at Leonard Oakes Estate Winery on Ridge Road in Medina.\n\nReturn to top\n\nSeneca Chief canal boat makes return stop at Medina\n\nBy Ginny Kropf, correspondent Posted 16 August 2024 at 10:29 pm\n\nMEDINA – The Seneca Chief, the boat which opened the Erie Canal in 1825 with Governor Dewitt Clinton, continued to attract visitors in the canal basin this afternoon and evening, on its return to Buffalo after traveling to Rochester.\n\nMore than 320 people visited the boat last Monday during its first stop in Monday, said Kathy Blackburn, a member of Medina’s Tourism Committee.\n\nReplicating Monday’s visit, the Seneca Chief was open for tourists, staff was on hand to talk about the boat and Medina and Orleans County Tourism agencies had an informational tent.\n\nLocal busker Rob Robinson strolled the grounds, playing his guitar and singing songs of the Erie Canal and old favorites.\n\n“This is pretty cool,” he said of the Seneca Chief’s visit. “People need to know how history used to be. The canal carried hundreds, even thousands of boats up and down this canal, filled with barrels of apples and grain.’\n\nRoger Allen was the master boat builder with Greg Dudley. Allen said he has been building wooden boats for museums since 1978, but this was the most amazing project he ever worked on.\n\n“The reason it is so amazing to me is the size of the boat,” Allen said. “This is not a common occurrence in the United States any more. Only two of us were paid staff, and I point out the woodwork to visitors, because it was all done by volunteers.”\n\nHe explained the research which went into the project before they started building the boat.\n\n“The Seneca Chief was a line boat we discovered in the original records,” Allen said. “It is 73 feet by 12 ½ feet.”\n\nHe explained a line boat is a specific type of boat which carries cargo and also has a passengers’ cabin. It would have carried lumber, wheat, apples or any goods manufactured or grown in the area, maybe even Medina sandstone, he said.\n\n“A lot of early newspapers reported Dewitt Clinton got aboard a packet boat,” Allen said. “That is not true. A packet boat carried mail and passengers, not cargo.”\n\nAllen went on to say the boat is not yet finished. They still have to finish the crew’s quarters in the stern of the boat and the passengers’ cabin in the front.\n\nAllen said Governor Clinton did a lot of promoting of the canal and he could have opened the cargo doors and shown people the tons of cargo, showcasing the many goods which could be carried on the canal.\n\nThis trip down the canal to Rochester and back is a sea trial for the Seneca Chief’s voyage next year, commemorating the 200th anniversary of the canal. The 2025 World Canals Conference will take place in Buffalo from Sept. 21 to 25, followed by the Seneca Chief’s departure from Buffalo and arrival in New York City on Oct. 26.\n\nAfter departing from Medina about 8 a.m. Saturday, the Seneca Chief will return to Buffalo, where the crew’s quarters and passengers’ cabin will be finished by mid-October. Then the boat will be returned to Lockport’s Flight of Five Locks, where it will spend the winter.\n\nReturn to top\n\nSheriff’s Office will check child safety seats on Sept. 21 at Public Safety Building\n\nPosted 16 August 2024 at 5:03 pm\n\nPress Release, Sheriff Chris Bourke\n\nALBION – Orleans County Sheriff Christopher Bourke is pleased to announce a Child Passenger Safety Seat Check Point Event will be held on Saturday, Sept. 21, at the Orleans County Public Safety Building from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.\n\nAccording to data, vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death for children between the ages of 1 to 13.

I’m especially pleased this bill is bipartisan, because supporting our caregivers shouldn’t be controversial—it’s an essential part of uplifting our veterans, which is why I look forward to passing this legislation into law.”\n\nThe federal Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers (PCAFC) was created in 2010 to provide a monthly income for caregivers to disabled (>70% rating) veterans. Today, there are over 55,000 caregivers participating in the program. The Veteran Caregiver RRR Act would increase and extend certain benefits to PCAFC caregivers to encourage more participants and better retain existing participants including employment assistance, retirement planning, bereavement counseling, and more.\n\nSpecifically, this legislation would:\n\nEnsure family caregivers enrolled in the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA) remain enrolled for up to 180 days following their dismissal from the Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers, unless they have been dismissed for fraud, abuse or mistreatment.\n\nRequire VA to reimburse family caregivers up to $1,000 for fees associated with maintaining the caregiver’s professional licensure and allow family caregivers to access VA training modules for the purpose of gaining credit for continuing professional education requirements.\n\nRequire VA, in consultation with the Departments of Defense and Labor, to allow family caregivers access to certain employment assistance programs.\n\nRequire VA to provide retirement planning services and/or assistance returning to the workforce to family caregivers.\n\nRequire VA to provide bereavement counseling and support for former family caregivers when their veteran loved one passes away.\n\nStudy the feasibility and advisability of establishing a returnship program for family caregivers to assist them in reentering the workforce following their time as a caregiver.\n\nStudy barriers and incentives to hiring former family caregivers to work for VA.\n\nStudy the feasibility and advisability of establishing a retirement plan for family caregivers.\n\nThis bill is co-sponsored in the House by Representative Ciscomani (R, AZ-6) and in the Senate by Senators Sinema (I-AZ) and Moran (R-KS). Numerous nationwide veterans’ advocacy groups also support this legislation, including: the Military Officers Association of America (MOAA), the Quality of Life Foundation, the Elizabeth Dole Foundation, the Wounded Warrior Project (WWP), Disabled American Veterans (DAV), and the American Legion.\n\nShannon Sander, the Department of New York DAV Commander, said: “When veteran caregivers make the noble choice to selflessly serve their loved one, they knowingly do so at the expense of their professional lives. This bill begins to correct an unintended hindrance for caregivers who require more employment and retirement support than currently available. They didn’t turn their backs on their veteran when needed the most, and we must remember how their sacrifice impacts their lives when the caregiving mission ends.”\n\nTo learn more about the Veteran Caregiver Re-education, Re-employment, and Retirement (Veteran Caregiver RRR) Act, read the full text of the bill by clicking here.\n\nReturn to top\n\nVolunteers sought for annual shoreline cleanup on Sept. 14\n\nBy Tom Rivers, Editor Posted 15 August 2024 at 3:21 pm\n\nALBION – The Orleans County Soil & Water Conservation District is seeking volunteers for its annual shoreline cleanup on Sept. 14.\n\nVolunteers will collect and record the litter they pick up at nearby waterways.

It is an event which gives people of all ages and skill levels an opportunity to participate. It also welcomes and embraces the participation of the people Arc GLOW serves, aligning with their mission to support people with disabilities in partnership with their families and community.\n\nTaste of Country, the signature event within the Friends and Family 5K, features a wonderful display of fruits and vegetables donated by area farmers. Runners, walkers, sponsors and volunteers each have the opportunity to take some home with them.\n\nArc GLOW expects over 300 runners and walkers this year. The event’s post party features live music by The Buffalo Road Show with Jim and Babe Catino, kid’s activities, food, beverages and award ceremony.\n\nSandy Konfederath has been the race director since the event began. It originally started in Batavia, but due to planned road reconstruction, the event was moved to the country in 2008.\n\n“It was our best decision ever,” Konfederath said. “Because along with the country route, we incorporated the country theme.”\n\nThe Friends and Family 5K began as a memorial to Mary Anne Graney, a parent, educator, advocate and friend to Arc GLOW who died in 2004. Her dedication to people with IDD and their families enriches countless lives. The Bluebonnet sponsorship is in honor of Graney’s Texas roots.\n\nThe Graney family is pleased funds raised in the 5K help support education through the Mary Anne Graney Memorial Scholarship program, which is presented to area high school seniors planning to further their studies in human services, special education or related fields. The event also helps fund various programs and services Arc GLOW offers for individuals with IDD.\n\nIn 2017, the Friends and Family 5K combined forces with the former 5K held in memory of Arc staff member Terri Carr Krieger. Krieger was a longtime employee who lost her battle with cancer in 1997. The Blue Spruce sponsor level is in Krieger’s honor.\n\nFinally, for many years the Livingston-Wyoming 5K was held in memory of Dr. Ramon M. Rocha. He passionately believed in the possibilities of life, and has been an endless source of inspiration for people of all ages and abilities.\n\nA beloved family man and enthusiastic volunteer, the Blue Knight sponsorship connects Dr. Rocha to SUNY Geneseo where he was a respected professor.\n\n“We’ve had sponsors and donors support us in this event since day one,” Konfederath said. “It’s an inclusive event for people of all abilities, and we’re so incredibly thankful for the continued support we receive to make sure this can happen every year.”\n\nThe Friends & Family 5K will take place Sept. 21 where check in begins at 8:45 a.m. and the race beings at 10 a.m. Race t-shirts will be guaranteed for all participants who register by Sept. 10 and until quantities last for walk-ins. It will be held at the Arc Day Habilitation Center, located at 4603 Barrville Road in Elba.\n\nFor anyone who wishes to sponsor the 5K, contact Sandy Konfederath at (585) 343-1123 ext. 1715 or skonfederath@arcglow.org by Aug. 26.\n\nWalkers and runners wishing to pre-register and save can do so online at ArcGLOW.org/Event/Friends-Family-5K-and-Fun-Walk or by contacting Konfederath.
