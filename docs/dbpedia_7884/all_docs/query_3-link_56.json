        "text": "By: Molly Pennington\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n100 best Westerns of all time to watch while at home\n\nStacker editorial note: In these trying times, we've dug into film, TV, and music history to pick out classic works that can keep you entertained while practicing social distancing\n\nThe Western was the most-produced genre in the American film industry up to 1970. It allowed audiences a vision of the American imagination where its myths and legends could be viewed in clear, stark form. Westerns are always set in the “frontier,” a space of rural landscapes untrammeled by civility, modernity, or worst of all, an eastern, city slicker mindset. Westerns often take place during the period of history before urbanization overtook a landscape thought of as “untouched,” despite the Native American settlements already there.\n\nThe genre often rewrites American history so the genocide of Native Americans comes across as rational and practical, as if it was a necessary battle that had to be won. Westerns are notoriously racist and sexist, but simplistically so, propping up racial “others” as simple foes and women as the easy opposites of manly heroes.\n\nWith their stark set pieces like the one-street town set against an expansive horizon, Westerns offer clear dichotomies that are deceptively simple. Consider these films fraught binaries between good and evil, men and women, and whites and “others,” plotted within a wilderness and the desire to tame it. These films play with ideas around the personal moral code of their cowboy heroes that clash with the laws of civility. The western terrain begs for alternate codes untamed by the too-rigid morality of city folk.\n\nStacker surveyed all Westerns classified as feature films and TV movies with more than 10,000 user votes on IMDb. Films are ranked by IMDb user score and ties were broken by the number of votes a film received.\n\nThese films and TV movies explore heroes and antiheroes who are bolstered by their flaws as they wander, often alone, through realistic settings that depict highly stylized and abstract themes within panoramic cinematography. Western style seems realistic because it takes place in a natural setting. However, this setting enmeshes with the meanings imposed upon it—ideologies and institutions—that obsess over codes. These codes concern honor, justice, and gender; what it means to be a man. The cowboy figure in Westerns seems a natural persona, not one carefully crafted through symbols, myths, and fantasies. In the Western, the landscape itself is another character teeming with its own mythology, the ideal stage for pageants on American identity.\n\nRead on to find out if your favorite Western made the top 100.\n\nYou may also like: 100 best John Wayne movies\n\nSee-Saw Films\n\n#100.

Ben Mendelsohn stars as the grizzled bounty hunter also on the trail. The familiar tropes, including a gunfight finale and shots of the dead, offer a contemporary redux of the Western’s austere and inescapable poetics of brutality.\n\nMorgan Creek Entertainment\n\n#99. Young Guns (1988)\n\n- Director: Christopher Cain\n\n- IMDb user rating: 6.9\n\n- Votes: 50,821\n\n- Metascore: 50\n\n- Runtime: 107 min\n\nStarring Brat Pack alum Emilio Estevez as the mythic Billy the Kid, “Young Guns” follows a gang of vigilante outlaws played by ‘80s “It” boys Lou Diamond Phillips, Charlie Sheen, Kiefer Sutherland, and Dermot Mulroney. Estevez captures the impulsive, sophomoric spirit of “the Kid” in a film that depicts adolescent masculinity during the Reagan years far more than Western life in the late 1800s.\n\nKiller Films\n\n#98.

The film features six different actors as Dylan, with Richard Gere portraying an identity fashioned around outlaw tropes and set in the Old West. Dylan wrote the score for 1973’s “Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid,” in which he also had a small role.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n#97.

The update features a diverse cast, one representative of the real Old West, with Denzel Washington as the leading man, a cowboy whose sense of law and order is inextricable from racial injustice.\n\nRodgers & Hammerstein Productions\n\n#96.

Fusing the primitive frontier with fantasies of the future, “Westworld” uses the Western archetypes of America as the set piece for a campy meditation on the simulation and nihilism inherent within the modern human experience.\n\nDonner/Shuler-Donner Productions\n\n#90.

In “Brimstone,” Guy Pearce’s tyrannical preacher, obsessed with punishing women, hunts Liz, a frontier woman (Dakota Fanning) who can’t speak since her tongue was cut out as punishment.\n\nDreamWorks Animation\n\n#85.

After a white woman’s abducted, stars Kurt Russell, Patrick Wilson, and Richard Jenkins take a harrowing journey to save her. It’s a brutal environment, but masculine codes of honor compel duty.\n\nCinema Center Films\n\n#83.

McLaglen\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.2\n\n- Votes: 11,761\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 127 min\n\nLoosely based on Shakespeare’s “The Taming of the Shrew,” Maureen O’Hara plays the wife of cattle baron McLintock, the iconically masculine John Wayne. His recalcitrant wife prefers “eastern” life. She’s eventually tarred, feathered, and publicly spanked—in the spirit of comedy so her final submission is treated as a light-hearted, happy ending rather than a sexist fantasy.\n\nWallis-Hazen\n\n#81. Gunfight at the O.K.

This classic film captures the mythic real-life gunfight as a stark battle between bad men and the heroes who’ll impose order on the lawless West.\n\nRepublic Pictures (I)\n\n#80.

Wayne’s frequent co-star, Maureen O’Hara, plays his estranged wife. She arrives in camp to “buy” from enlistment the couple’s son. The idea of Native Americans as a savage threat provides the backdrop for masculine honor and father-son drama.\n\nWallis-Hazen\n\n#79.

Jack Lemmon plays Professor Fate, a black-hatted villain. One sequence includes a stop in Borracho, a western town where the hero Leslie (Tony Curtis) gets into a saloon brawl with an outlaw. Natalie Wood also appears in this romp filled with stark tropes and more than one pie in the face.\n\nColumbia Pictures Corporation\n\n#77.

Danny Glover plays a homesteader seeking vengeance. Scott Glenn is the steely sharpshooter who survives devastating wounds to ride again. Kevin Costner plays a hot-headed bandit up for any fight.

The film shows that American troops are also brutal, but somehow less so. Christian Bale plays a captain assigned to transfer an Apache man (Wes Studi) and his family home. The ending offers the bleak hope of love and makeshift families after a vicious loss.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n#75.

By the end, they’re posing as monks and beating the bad guys in an elaborately exaggerated fistfight. The film was shot in southern Italy on terrain that calls forth the wide vistas and small enclaves that characterize settings of the genre.\n\nArgosy Pictures\n\n#71.

Visual compositions capture the iconography of Monument Valley, and the evocative style of Frederic Remington’s Western art that shows scenes of Native Americans, cowboys, and the U.S. cavalry—all in motion against a vast natural terrain.\n\nSeven Arts Productions\n\n#70.

Bob Dylan scored the film and plays a small role. James Coburn plays Pat Garrett, the man sent to kill the Kid. The film’s theatrical release was marred by controversy, but a cut with restored footage sealed the fate of this film as one of Peckinpah’s best.\n\nB.R.C. Produzione S.r.l.\n\n#68.

Close-ups pan up his body to rest on his swarthy, blue-eyed visage, and like all strong, silent cowboys he’s ruthless, but moral. He follows his own code. This influential Spaghetti Western, filled with striking compositions, follows Django as he fights two brutal gangs and saves the woman he loves.\n\nBarunson\n\n#67.

Eastwood brings his signature style of stoic intensity to the role of the man who arrives, doles out punishment and redemption, then rides off into the snowy hills. The film’s final scene offers a redux of the end of “Shane.” This time the youngster yells “I love you,” instead of “come back.”\n\nAnnapurna Pictures\n\n#65.

The film is part of a revisionist bent to critique whiteness and the treatment of Native Americans. However, with blue-eyed Paul Newman in the lead role, the film explores racism through the experience of a white man.\n\nCaviar\n\n#63.

Recently, “The Rider,” uses realism to examine a rodeo contestant recovering from a life-changing accident. Using non-professional actors and based on a true story, the film explores Western myths about horses and riders in an authentic, non-romantic depiction that is nonetheless triumphant.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#62.

However, with Wayne as their instructor, the film is more about teaching them about masculinity and what it is to become a man, especially when they have to step up and do the job for real.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n#61. Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954)\n\n- Director: Stanley Donen\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.4\n\n- Votes: 19,700\n\n- Metascore: 75\n\n- Runtime: 102 min\n\nThis dazzling widescreen musical follows seven brothers named for characters in the bible in alphabetical order starting with Adam and going to Gideon. It plays with the trope of taming by showing women civilizing the unkempt, wild ways of men in order to prepare them for the happy ending promise of marriage. The barn-raising scene shows the artifice of gender through brightly colored costumes and jubilant choreography performed against the obviously fake painted backdrop of nature, a studio set rather than a natural landscape.\n\nBocek Yapim\n\n#60.

The plot centers on special agents, joined by a Calamity Jane-esque sharp shooter, who take a gift to the American president. They experience the perils of the “mild West,” as the title translates.\n\nEuropaCorp\n\n#59.

A border patrol agent kills an immigrant and quickly buries the body. The killed man’s friend exhumes the corpse to provide a proper burial. Surreal imagery and a non-linear narrative engage in a critique of the border patrol and its brutality.\n\nWallis-Hazen\n\n#58.

The local captain proposes to hang the boy unless an older brother (Guy Pearce) finds and kills the brother responsible. Written by Nick Cave, and brutally violent, “The Proposition” shows the futility of justice, retribution, and revenge.\n\nTouchstone Pictures\n\n#56.

Kevin Costner and Robert Duvall play cattle herders, men living a pure existence thwarted by the corruption they feel compelled to avenge; shootouts ensue. The film also depicts the classic contrasts between wilderness and civility in this romance where the land itself is the lush object of affection.\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\n#55.

Fox) and Doc Brown (Christopher Lloyd) return, this time to 1885, smack dab into a scene of cowboys and Indians, who appear unfazed by the DeLorean time machine in their midst. Moving the story to the Old West allows the hero McFly to interact with myths just as nostalgic and “classic” as those in the original’s 1950s past.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n#54.

Nobody pushes the old-timer to get back in the shoot-‘em-up game so the younger outlaw can replace the legendary gunslinger in the history books. Who’s the fastest? In the film’s oft-repeated conceit, “Nobody.”\n\nProducciones Panicas\n\n#49.

Director Alejandro Jodorowsky stars as the lone cowboy on horseback (although he travels with his son) who confronts and commits slaughter often amid Christian symbols. Jodorowsky admitted to raping his co-star, Mara Lorenzio, to make the rape scene authentic. The film has a cult following in spite of a repugnance that’s mischaracterized as avant-garde.\n\nThe Malpaso Company\n\n#48.

Most of the original cast returns for the movie, intended as a coda to the series that ran for three seasons in the early 2000s. Timothy Olyphant, Ian McShane, Robin Weigert, and Molly Parker reprise their roles in this critically acclaimed wrap-up that captures bittersweet allegory about the hapless figures caught within capitalist expansion.\n\nLionsgate\n\n#44. 3:10 to Yuma (1957)\n\n- Director: Delmer Daves\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.6\n\n- Votes: 16,897\n\n- Metascore: data not available\n\n- Runtime: 92 min\n\nBased on a short story by noirist author Elmore Leonard, this suspenseful Western stars Glenn Ford, cast against type, as the villainous Ben Wade.

The two leads play aging, flawed men in conflict with another rancher in a fight against corruption as much as against their own limitations. They’re both swaggering on a crutch by the time the story ends.\n\nSanford Productions\n\n#42.

It epitomizes so many Western tropes about the lone gunman, his code of honor, and his inevitable departure, as epitomized in the famous ending lines. “Shane! Come back,” as yelled by the child who’ll never forget the exiting hero’s masculine bravado.\n\nPandora Filmproduktion\n\n#39.

The film uses poetic visuals and a haunting style to revisit Western myths and the racism beneath them. As usual for this genre, this exploration occurs primarily through the bleak story of a white man.\n\nFilm 44\n\n#38.

Soon, they’re on the run from the law. Jeff Bridges plays the steely ranger who won’t let them go in a mode similar to classic Western lawmen who relentlessly pursue bad guys, and in doing so, reveal themselves as the same breed.\n\nParamount Pictures\n\n#37.

Crawford plays a hardscrabble saloon owner caught in the crossfire between cattlers and townies. She dresses in pants and a holster and gets to fire shots in the climactic shootout.\n\nUniversal International Pictures (UI)\n\n#34.

The plot follows the weapon as it changes hands, going from one cowboy to the next, imbued with righteous poetic justice. Jimmy Stewart plays the cowboy who wins the gun before it’s stolen by his murderous brother, forcing him to take to the trail in pursuit.\n\nMetro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM)\n\n#33.

When a wounded vet (Spencer Tracy) shows up to visit his friend Komoko, townspeople try to hide the racism that fueled a violent crime. The film is notable for depicting white people’s anti-Japanese sentiment in this country during World War II.\n\nDavid Foster Productions\n\n#32.

Also starring Lauren Bacall, the film seems a meditation on Wayne’s persona and the genre itself as a “dying” concept. The concept of the Old West must finally expire when there’s nothing left to conquer.\n\nRafran Cinematografica\n\n#30.

While it aims to offer a satire of American racism, its bombastic style sometimes engages in crassness rather than illuminating it. Gene Wilder stars, along with Cleavon Little as the black sheriff of a white town.\n\nLionsgate\n\n#26. 3:10 to Yuma (2007)\n\n- Director: James Mangold\n\n- IMDb user rating: 7.7\n\n- Votes: 272,178\n\n- Metascore: 76\n\n- Runtime: 122 min\n\nRussell Crowe stars as the singularly diabolical Ben Wade, an outlaw so ruthless and spry, it takes epic manpower just to get him on the right train. Christian Bale plays the pioneer man who walks with a limp, and has that brand of virtue that’s flawed, but still good enough to take down a bad man.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#25.

John Wayne plays the fatherly, tyrannical cattler who takes on a young orphan who grows up to be his greatest rival. Montgomery Clift plays the young rancher who challenges the elder cowboy and his ways.\n\nHollywood Pictures\n\n#23. Tombstone (1993)\n\n- Director: George P.

The performances give this film its allure. Powers Boothe seethes with villainy as a rival leader. The gravelly bravado of Sam Elliott is right at home, and a sublime performance by Val Kilmer as the mythic Doc Holliday makes “Tombstone” a mirthful romp into the Western as male melodrama.\n\nVisiona Romantica\n\n#22.

Sporting a Texas accent, the role made Newman a superstar despite him playing an anti-hero. Hud represents the immoral counterpart of his principled father, which comes across less as weakness and more as the romantic rebellion of every Western outlaw who bucks his father’s rules.\n\nWalter Wanger Productions\n\n#19.

The iconic battle scene features Apaches descending upon a stagecoach in a stereotypically hapless fashion. In contrast, the white people represent civility, law and order, and in the case of women, the conflict between the pure and the profane.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#18.

William Holden and Ernest Borgnine star as two of the gang members on the run who, like all lawbreakers, can never escape their brutal, intrinsic criminality, even as their ways are becoming quickly outdated.\n\nC.V.

The formal visual style pairs widescreen natural vistas with studio set piece nature to create a sense of artifice that matches the crude racist theme—the idea that a female raped by Native Americans is better off dead. The closing shot frames John Wayne in a cabin doorway against the frontier beyond, as if a part of it.\n\nStanley Kramer Productions\n\n#15.

Gary Cooper and Grace Kelly play newlyweds set to skip town and start anew. Once Cooper, as a soon-to-be-retired sheriff, learns that bad guy's approach, he’s conflicted over leaving with his pacifist wife or staying for his code of honor. The movie’s running time replicates the “real time” of the movie, the 80 minutes or so before a departing train and the arrival of the evil gunman.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#14.

Based on Akira Kurosawa’s “Yojimbo,” Eastwood’s cowboy offers to work for rival factions, then double-crosses both. Leone employs his signature stylistic elements such as striking compositions, arresting close-ups, and evocative musical scoring.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox\n\n#11.

It was a box office hit that used stylized composition to rework myths about outlaw heroes. “Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head” won the Oscar for best song; it scored a scene in which Newman and co-star Katharine Ross tool through meadows on a bicycle.\n\nTig Productions\n\n#10.

The “man” of the title exists as a conflict between an eastern politician (Jimmy Stewart) and the Western cowboy (John Wayne) who always arrives to save him. Lee Marvin stars as the archetypical bully, Liberty Valance, so evil that whoever kills him will become a legend.\n\nBuster Keaton Productions\n\n#7.

Keaton’s physical comedy and expressive visage create intensely watchable action. The “general” of the title is a steam engine, another trope of the Western genre, one that represents modern industry, expansion, and an isolated force racing across rural landscapes and vulnerable to attack.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#6. The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948)\n\n- Director: John Huston\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.2\n\n- Votes: 104,789\n\n- Metascore: 98\n\n- Runtime: 126 min\n\nHumphrey Bogart plays a down-and-out drifter on the hunt for gold in John Huston’s classic meditation on the nature of greed and the irony of riches. Three prospectors patch together supplies and discover gold in the Sierra Nevada mountains, only to succumb to depravity.\n\nWarner Bros.\n\n#5. Unforgiven (1992)\n\n- Director: Clint Eastwood\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.2\n\n- Votes: 345,861\n\n- Metascore: 85\n\n- Runtime: 130 min\n\nGene Hackman steals the show as a corrupt sheriff who seeks to prohibit violence with shocking displays of it. Clint Eastwood directed and stars in this story about a widower pulled back to a life of crime by the promise of bounty. Morgan Freeman stars as his sidekick, but the vengeance they promise to a group of wronged prostitutes proves bleak and futile in light of a culture that doesn’t recognize humanity, especially in women.\n\nProduzioni Europee Associate (PEA)\n\n#4. For a Few Dollars More (1965)\n\n- Director: Sergio Leone\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.3\n\n- Votes: 210,051\n\n- Metascore: 74\n\n- Runtime: 132 min\n\nSergio Leone’s “Dollars Trilogy” returns with the second installment featuring Clint Eastwood as the “Man with No Name.” The story about hunting an iconic villain displays more of Leone’s signature stylizations, including aesthetic violence, tension created through both silence and score, arresting compositions, and masterful use of the close-up.\n\nThe Weinstein Company\n\n#3. Django Unchained (2012)\n\n- Director: Quentin Tarantino\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.4\n\n- Votes: 1,231,198\n\n- Metascore: 81\n\n- Runtime: 165 min\n\nJamie Foxx stars as Django, an enslaved man who must earn his freedom by helping a bounty hunter (Christoph Waltz) in the pre-Civil War South. Quentin Tarantino’s fantastical revision of American slavery portrays a too-easy vengeance against racist white slave owners. This Western doesn’t adequately portray the experience of black people, instead relying on stereotypes and stylization in its depiction of brutal American history.\n\nRafran Cinematografica\n\n#2. Once Upon a Time in the West (1968)\n\n- Director: Sergio Leone\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.5\n\n- Votes: 275,698\n\n- Metascore: 80\n\n- Runtime: 165 min\n\nWith an epic length and a striking visual style, this notable Western is considered one of Sergio Leone’s signature masterpieces. The film both critiques the myths of the West and presents them with flash, grit, and characteristic fatality. The plot follows a villainous gun for hire (Henry Fonda) and the mysterious “Harmonica” (Charles Bronson) as the rival with a secret who’ll take him down.\n\nProduzioni Europee Associate (PEA)\n\n#1. The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966)\n\n- Director: Sergio Leone\n\n- IMDb user rating: 8.8\n\n- Votes: 632,270\n\n- Metascore: 90\n\n- Runtime: 178 min\n\nThe final installment of Sergio Leone’s “Dollars Trilogy” with its iconic, oft-referenced title continues an exploration of the gunslinger figure, the “good,” as embodied by Clint Eastwood. With an epic 178-minute running time, and considered an emblematic Spaghetti Western, it shows Leone’s signature visual style, excessive bloodshed, and nihilistic ambiguity toward moral order. The darkly humorous sensibility meshes well with the familiar Western plot about killing bandits and stealing gold.\n\nYou may also like: 100 best movies of the 21st century, according to critics"
