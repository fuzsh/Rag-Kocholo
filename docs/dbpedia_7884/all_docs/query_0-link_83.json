        "text": "The medical examiner’s office has ruled as an accident the death of a 16-year-old boy hit by a freight train in El Monte on Wednesday, May 15.\n\nDaniel Vargas Caal died of blunt-force trauma, according to the medical examiner’s office, which listed his place of death as a railroad track. The agency did not have a city of residence for him.\n\nIt wasn’t clear what Caal was doing before the fatal collision around 6 p.m. Authorities had not released details.\n\nHe was struck on the tracks, east of Durfee Avenue, El Monte police Sgt. Roger Cobian said. Police went to the scene, assisted the investigation and then Union Pacific took over, he said.\n\nIt is under investigation, said Robynn Tysver, a spokeswoman for Union Pacific. The train crew was not injured."
