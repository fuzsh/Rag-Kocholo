        "text": "My high-school friend Jonathan Muggleton has terminal cancer and needs specialized, life-saving treatment. He is 48. He has a wife and two young children, aged 11 and 9. He's run out of all the healthcare options he can get in the UK. However, there is treatment undergoing clinical trial in the US (TIL Cell Therapy) that has proven successful for his rare type of cancer, mucosal melanoma. We need to raise ¬£350k for him to get this treatment in the US. Jon is a wonderful, kind-hearted man in the prime of his life. Despite six surgeries and all the immunotherapy, he is in incredible physical shape (I can see all his running and cycling in Strava) but he is dying. Cancer is unfair. It is cruel and takes people who don't deserve it. So we're raising money to stop it taking Jon too. If you can help - that would be great. ‚ù§Ô∏è https://lnkd.in/eqDYj75E\n\nüîé So, you want to conduct an EEG experiment. What kind of headset should you choose? In addition to the number of sensors you'll need, you'll need to consider factors like participant age, how long your experiment will be, and how much they will be moving. Here's a handy guide: https://lnkd.in/g27baCim #experiment #brainresearch #laboratoryequipment #neuroscience #neurotechnology\n\nScience X Music SOUND ON - This ingenious immersive live experience allows the viewer to step inside the artists brains and witness their emotions as they perform the classical composition of Debussy‚Äôs Clair de Lune. Created exclusively for the sci-fi thriller series, \"Open Your Eyes,\" Netflix has joined forces with visionary artists Hania Rani, Dobrawa Czocher, and MELT Studio to create an unparalleled artistic encounter. Drawing inspiration from the series exploration of the human psyche, they have made an experience unlike any other. To allow the audience to see the music, the artists were connected to a brain-computer interface while performing. The collected signals were then translated into 3D simulated animations in real time and projected-back onto the environment.
