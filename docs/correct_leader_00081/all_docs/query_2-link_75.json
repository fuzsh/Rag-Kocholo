        "text": "Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki issued an arrest warrant for Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi, a Sunni and prominent official from the opposition Iraqiyya List, on December 19, 2011. The arrest warrant cited as evidence confessions forced through the torture of several of Hashemi's bodyguards, as well as individuals said by Maliki to work for the vice president. Below are translations of the arrest warrant for Hashemi as well as excerpts from the bodyguards' coerced confessions. These statements were released by state-run media, undermining the reliability of these claims.\n\nIn the name of God the most merciful, the most compassionate\n\nRepublic of Iraq\n\nSupreme Judiciary Council\n\nCentral Court of Inquiry\n\nCASE NUMBER\\(17351)\n\nSearch and Arrest Warrant\n\nWarrant Number\\ Year\\\n\nTo the judicial authority members and to all police personnel, you are permitted to arrest:\n\n1. FIRST, MIDDLE AND LAST NAME: Tariq al-Hashemi\n\n2. HOME ADDRESS: Baghdad- Green Zone\n\n3. JOB TITLE: Vice President\n\n4. TYPE OF CRIME/ LAW PROVISIONS: Article IV\\Counter-Terrorism\n\n5. DESCRIPTIONS:\n\nMust be brought to appear in front of our court immediately due to the charge filed against him by: The federal police intelligence office\n\nJudge: SIGNED\n\nDate: Dec. 19th 2011\n\nSEAL OF COURT\n\nDownload the original arrest warrant.\n\nThe following are translated excerpts of the coerced confessions, which were released by the Dhi-Qar news agency, a media network affiliated with Maliki’s State of Law list, on December 19, 2011.\n\nConfessions:\n\nLieutenant Colonel Faisal Issmaiel Hussain al-Zabiey/ Born 1960/ Baghdad- Abu Ghrayb\n\nColonel Issa Sayer Mouth’in al-Issawi/ Born 1967/ Anbar-Fallujah\n\nFirst Lieutenant Mohammed Ghanni Olaiwei al-Issawi/ Born 1983/ Anbar-Fallujah.\n\nCharge:\n\nAccording to status number 1152 dated November 1, 2010, the above names have been provided by an official order issued from the supreme judiciary council, based on Article IV, to the Central Criminal Court.\n\nBelonging to terrorist organization.\n\nKidnapping detainees and murdering them.\n\nFaking official papers for the purpose of swapping detainees and murdering them.\n\nMass murder and mass graves.\n\nTestimony of: First Lieutenant Mohammed Ghanni Olaiwei al-Issawi.\n\nMinutes numbered 67/75\n\nWe committed kidnappings and murder. The direct officer of Colonel Issa Sayer was Sa’ad Awaad Rashed, who occupied the position of Fallujah city mayor for the period from 2006 to sometime in 2009. Sa’ad was a senior member in the Islamic Party, and his direct boss was the director of Islamic party organizations in Anbar province, also known as Abu-Mujahid, his real name is Khalid Al-Alwani. Abu Mujahid was in touch with Vice President Tariq al-Hashemi and Rafie al-Issawi when the former held the position of vice president at that time.\n\nTariq al-Hashemi had constantly held meetings with Abu Mujahid and the Fallujah mayor, as well as Colonel Issa Sayer al-Issawi. Directions/instructions were issued by Tariq al-Hashemi himself. The orders issued by Tariq al-Hashemi to us were to commit murder and kidnap and to arrange malicious accusations to those who are opponents to the policies of the Islamic party in the province.\n\nAt the end of 2006 the Islamic party formed an organization called Hamas of Iraq, and it would work as the military wing of the Islamic party. Hamas of Iraq was led by Abu-Mujahid (Khalid al-Alwani) in Fallujah. A majority of Islamic party youth have joined Hamas of Iraq. Colonel Issa Sayer has employed all the human and material resources of the Fallujah police department for the service of this movement. We began to work as a movement that serves the interests of the Islamic Party in Fallujah. Everyone who objected to the Islamic Party policies was a target to eliminate. Another group that belongs to the same movement was formed in A’meriyat-al-Fallujah neighborhood. This particular group was led by Dr. Abd Al-Sattar El-waass al-Issawi, who is the director of Fallujah’s New-Hospital. This group contained more than 1000 members; they imposed their power over the entire area of A’meriyat-al-Fallujah. The senior leaders of this particular movement, Hamas of Iraq- A’meriyat-al-Fallujah, were the sons of Dr. Abd al-Sattar, a person nicknamed Abu Aws, who is a cleric and a teacher, as well as Abu Zaid, who is(Abu Aws’s brother and works as a teacher in A’meriyat-al-Fallujah.\n\nMinutes numbered 68/77\n\nHamas of Iraq members wear civilian clothing when performing tasks given to them, they ride civilian vehicles, and the Islamic party gave us orders to spread the fear among the people in Fallujah, so no one would ever attempt to clash with the Islamic Party’s interests. Armed groups formed by the Islamic party were not meant to fight al-Qaeda as the public been told; their real purpose was to support the Islamic Party politically in Fallujah and to perform a hit-list.\n\nLate 2006 to be more specific, one day I was at Fallujah police department. Colonel Issa Sayer ordered Nuri Seyah also known as Hamza Abu Ali, Othman, Ali and me to visit Major Ibrahim al-Mohammedi and Captain Jammal, who work for the Major Crimes office, at their work place which is the Counter-Insurgency Bureau, and so we did, and as ordered, we received from them five detainees. As far as I remember one of them was Jabbar Jar Allah al-Issawi, who lived in Fallujah near the Tourism City, as well as Mohammed, who I cannot recall his last name, as well as the other three detainees. Colonel Issa Sayer has ordered us to murder those five detainees; we received a Fatwa [an Islamic religious ruling, a scholarly opinion on a matter of Islamic law] to eliminate those five detainees from the private Mufti [the high-ranked cleric how is authorized to issue Fatwa] of the Islamic Party in Falluja who is Abu Mujahid himself.\n\nAfter that, Nuri, Othman, Ali Hashim and I used a police pick-up truck to transport the five detainees to an open area on the tourism city (Habbaniya) high-way, we ordered the detainees to lie down and we shot them.\n\nMinutes numbered 69/79"
