        "text": "Nearly 100 people arrested at USC, police say\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department said 93 people were arrested on suspicion of trespassing during Wednesday’s demonstrations at the University of Southern California.\n\n“The university is a private campus and the group had been violating some of their orders. It was a trespass at that point and we assisted with the arrests,” Los Angeles Police Captain Kelly Muniz said during a briefing.\n\nOne person was also arrested for assault with a deadly weapon, Muniz said. She did not provide further details.\n\nNo protesters or officers have been reported injured, police said.\n\nSome context: USC’s Department of Public Safety ordered protesters gathering at the campus’ Alumni Park Wednesday afternoon to disperse or face arrest for trespassing.\n\nAt one point during the demonstrations, tensions escalated as protesters refused to relocate and remove their tents and other prohibited items, a university official said.\n\nThe university closed its campus Wednesday evening as LAPD began arresting demonstrators.\n\nColumbia denies assertions by protesters that it planned to bring in National Guard to quell demonstrations\n\nColumbia University officials pushed back on assertions from protesters that the school threatened it would bring in the National Guard to help address the pro-Palestinian protest encampment.\n\nJewish community threat watchers urge universities to \"restore calm and order\"\n\nThe Secure Community Network – a consortium of Jewish community security officials across the nation – said Wednesday it is closely monitoring protest developments on college campuses and is urging administrators to “restore calm and order,” noting at least 20 significant protests are reportedly underway.\n\nSCN “is closely monitoring safety and security conditions for potential escalation and impact to Jewish students and faculty/staff,” the organization said in a statement, adding threat watchers “tracked a record 516 threat incident and suspicious activity reports on campuses in 2023.”\n\n“Schools must restore calm and order,” said SCN National Director & CEO Michael Masters. “The best way to do this is to enact and enforce strict anti-tent, anti-encampment policies, and have zero tolerance for assaults on either students or police. Schools must also ensure collaboration with law enforcement and students to create an environment of safety. Failure to enforce these rules will lead to escalating protests.”\n\nAs CNN has reported, SCN analysts routinely monitor both online and physical threats, and share investigative tips with law enforcement and Jewish houses of worship in the US.\n\nUSC says there is \"significant activity\" on campus amid protest\n\nThere is “significant activity” at the University of Southern California’s University Park Campus due to a demonstration, according to an alert sent by the school on Wednesday.\n\n“There may be difficulty accessing that area,” according to the school.\n\nTuesday’s protest on campus was peaceful this morning and protesters had set up tents, according to CNN’s Nick Watt, who is on the scene.\n\nPolice seen pushing back protesters at University of Texas at Austin\n\nTexas State Police were seen pushing back pro-Palestinian protesters on the University of Texas at Austin campus Wednesday afternoon, as witnessed by CNN affiliate KEYE.\n\nFootage aired on CNN showed a chaotic scene, with what appeared to be shouts of “disperse” from law enforcement officers and a large crowd of student protesters shouting back.\n\n“There does seem to be some escalating levels of distress, and protesters are continuing to chant, and the police are forming multiple blockades to keep protesters from moving,” Amelia Kimball, associate managing editor at The Daily Texan, said on air with CNN.\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez weighs in on campus protests\n\nAs pro-Palestinian protests spread throughout college campuses nationwide, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez from New York condemned the way administrators like Columbia University President Minouche Shafik have handled the issue on behalf of the student protesters.\n\n“Calling in police enforcement on nonviolent demonstrations of young students on campus is an escalatory, reckless, and dangerous act,” wrote Rep. Ocasio-Cortez in a post on X Tuesday. “It represents a heinous failure of leadership that puts people’s lives at risk. I condemn it in the strongest possible terms.”\n\nHer comment came a day after a fellow New York Democrat, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, accused Columbia of caving to “right wing pressure.”"
