        "text": "YEREVAN -- Azerbaijan threatened on July 25 to take large-scale military action against Armenia in response to what it called Armenian “provocations” along the border between the two countries.\n\nThe Azerbaijani Defense Ministry claimed that the Armenian military recently used “heavy weaponry” and a reconnaissance drone in the area. The ministry also called on Armenia and its sponsors to “refrain from creating a new hotbed of war” in the South Caucasus.\n\n“If such provocative actions do not stop, appropriate steps will be taken using all means in the arsenal of the armed forces of Azerbaijan for the purpose of self-defense,” it added in a statement.\n\nThe ministry also denounced Western powers for stepping up military cooperation with Armenia, citing joint military exercises conducted by the United States in Armenia this month, an arms deal with France, and the European Union’s allocation of 10 million euros ($10.9 million) in military aid to Yerevan.\n\nIt claimed these actions can inspire Armenia “to resort to new provocations and prepare for another war against Azerbaijan.”\n\nThe Armenian Foreign Ministry rejected the claims. Spokeswoman Ani Badalian insisted that Yerevan remains committed to its “peace agenda” and “will not deviate from this strategy.”\n\nShe pointed to Baku ignoring a recent Armenian proposal to conduct joint investigations of cease-fire violations alleged by either side.\n\nBadalian said Armenia’s arms acquisitions from France and other nations are solely aimed at the “defense of its internationally recognized territory.”\n\nThe Armenian Foreign Ministry claimed on June 19 that Azerbaijan may be planning to unleash a “new aggression” against Armenia after hosting the COP29 summit in November. It pointed to Baku’s angry reaction to a different French-Armenian arms deal signed in Paris.\n\nThe latest Azerbaijani threats came two weeks after the foreign ministers of the two nations met in Washington for talks hosted by U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken. They reported no progress toward the signing of an Armenian-Azerbaijani peace treaty.\n\nThe neighboring countries have been negotiating a peace treaty since Azerbaijan retook control of the Nagorno-Karabakh region in September 2023, following a lightning offensive.\n\nA traditional ally and partner of Russia, Armenia recently has turned toward improving its ties with the West and putting on ice its relations with Moscow, which Yerevan has blamed for failing to support it in its conflict with Azerbaijan.\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskiy said on July 25 that a suspect in the shooting death of former lawmaker Iryna Farion, who was known for campaigns promoting the Ukrainian language, was detained in the eastern city of Dnipro.\n\nZelenskiy wrote on Telegram that Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko had informed him of the detention of an 18-year-old man suspected in the July 19 shooting.\n\n\"The operation to detain the suspect was very complicated. Hundreds of specialists from the National Police of Ukraine, the SBU, and other services worked on solving the murder, all these days,\" Zelenskiy wrote, adding that he asked Klymenko to provide the public with all of the details of the investigation in the high-profile case.\n\nKlymenko said shortly afterward in a statement that the suspect rented at least three apartments in Lviv while preparing the attack on Farion.\n\n\"Now the suspect is in custody. It is important to obtain all the details. At this point, investigators are inclined to think that the shooter is just the one who carried out the attack,\" Klymenko said, adding that any follow-up information will be made public later.\n\nThe Schemes (Skhemy) investigative unit of RFE/RL's Ukrainian Service was able to identify the suspect but decided not to disclose the information.\n\nThe suspect's father told RFE/RL that his son could not have had any motive to kill Farion.\n\n\"I am currently on the battlefield and have not seen my son for some time. I talked to him on the phone on a regular basis,\" the man said, adding that his son is a graduate of a high school in Dnipro.\n\n\"He passed courses on using drones so that he could join Ukrainian troops. He played soccer,\" said the suspect’s father, whose identity Schemes also decided not to reveal.\n\nRFE/RL also interviewed residents in Dnipro, including one woman who described the suspect as a “very good boy.” The woman, who spoke anonymously, said she had difficulty believing the teenager could have been the killer.\n\nThe young man had a \"healthy lifestyle,\" reads a lot, and was studying to be a journalist, she told RFE/RL.\n\nSchemes confirmed through other sources that the suspect is a graduate of a high school in Dnipro. As a soccer player with the city's youth soccer club, he participated in a soccer tournament in autumn 2022 to support Ukraine's armed forces.\n\nThe 60-year-old Farion was shot in the head on a street in Ukraine's western city of Lviv and died in a hospital hours later.\n\nFarion, a linguist, became a member of the nationalist Svoboda party in 2005 and was elected to parliament in 2012 but failed in subsequent attempts to win reelection.\n\nShe gained notoriety for frequent campaigns to promote the Ukrainian language and discredit public officials who spoke Russian.\n\nFarion’s views were seen as radical by some critics, and some of her statements sparked controversy.\n\nIn 2018, when Ukraine was fighting Russia-backed separatists who had seized territory in the east, she called for a drive to \"punch every Russian-speaking person in the jaw.\"\n\nIn 2023, she was dismissed as a professor at the Department of Ukrainian Language at the Institute of Humanities and Social Sciences at Lviv Polytechnic University due to her controversial statements.\n\nAt the end of May, the Lviv Court of Appeal issued a ruling reinstating her to the position.\n\nAn Iranian Kurdish prisoner convicted of killing a cleric has been executed despite complaints from rights groups over a lack of transparency in the judicial process.\n\nKamran Sheikheh had been in jail for almost 15 years before he was hanged in a prison in Urmia, West Azerbaijan Province, in the early hours of July 25.\n\nSheikheh was the last of seven people convicted of and executed for the September 2008 killing of Abdolrahim Tina, a congregational prayer leader in Sheikheh’s hometown of Mahabad. All seven people were executed in the last eight months, according to the Kurdish rights group Hengaw.\n\nAmnesty International had long insisted that all seven suspects were sentenced to death in “grossly unfair trials marred by claims of torture” to exact confessions. Hengaw said the trials were “illegal and not transparent.”\n\nAside from murder, they were also accused of being Salafists -- an ultraradical sect under Sunni Islam.\n\nIn an open letter years ago, Sheikheh and the other six suspects denied all charges and alleged that they were subjected to various forms of torture, including mock executions, sleep deprivation, and being hung from the ceiling.\n\nAs of July 25, at least 286 people have been executed in Iranian prisons this year, according to Iran Human Rights.\n\nAccording to Amnesty, Iran carried out 853 executions in 2023, with at least 481 executions for narcotics convictions.\n\nIn April, Amnesty accused the Islamic republic of “weaponizing the death penalty” to target “protesters, dissidents, and members of oppressed ethnic minorities” and called for “a robust global response” to pressure Tehran to implement a moratorium on the death penalty.\n\nRussian human rights defender Valentina Chupik says new legislation on migration adopted by Russia's State Duma this week will dramatically restrict the rights of labor migrants.\n\nThousands of men and women from Central Asia regularly come to Russia as migrant workers and provide a financial lifeline to those back home.\n\nSpeaking to Current Time on July 25, Chupik said the new bills passed by the lower house will allow Russian police to fully control the everyday routine of labor migrants and bar them from leaving their homes, even to work or shop, if they decide to do so without a court decision.\n\n\"In addition to that, the so-called migration search regime would allow any police officer to detain labor migrants for up to 48 hours to check if they are being sought under the migration search regime,\" Chupik said.\n\nThe legislation comes amid rising antimigrant sentiment following the arrests of several Tajik citizens suspected of being involved in a terrorist attack in late March on an entertainment center near Moscow that left more than 140 people dead.\n\nThe bills allow the police to decide if migrant workers should be deported and allows for such deportation to be conducted within 48 hours.\n\nCurrently, decisions on the deportation of labor migrants are made by courts, and migrants ordered to be deported can stay in Russia for up to 90 days before the court decision is carried out.\n\nChupik told Current Time that while the accelerated process meant migrants set to be deported will not spend up to three months in prison-like deportation centers, she is concerned over one clause that says migrants can be deported if accused of \"taking part in, or organizing, a mass gathering.\"\n\n\"A mass Islamic prayer...a line to a migration registration center, a crowd of migrants at a construction site, migrants' wedding party, or burial ceremony -- all can be defined as mass gathering, and anyone who attends such events can be deported,\" Chupik said.\n\nChupik said a clause saying migrants can be deported for refusing to follow the \"legitimate orders of police officers\" is also \"worrisome,\" given that \"in 19 years of human right activities in Russia, I have never seen a single legitimate request by police officers to labor migrants.\"\n\n\"The most horrible thing they made up is the so-called deportation for minor hooliganism,\" Chupik stressed, adding that currently 80 percent of illegally held labor migrants are charged with hooliganism to justify their detention.\n\nThe bills still have to be approved by the parliament's upper chamber, the Federation Council, before they are endorsed into law by President Vladimir Putin.\n\nChinese engineers and the Taliban government officially started work on a massive project in Afghanistan to mine the world's second-largest deposit of copper.\n\nAt the July 24 event at Mes Aynak, some 40 kilometers southeast of the capital, Kabul, Taliban officials along with Chinese businessmen and diplomats carried out a ribbon-cutting ceremony as work began on the construction of a road to the mining site.\n\nA $3 billion deal signed in 2008 gave the Chinese state-owned China Metallurgical Group Corporation (MCC) a 30-year mining concession, but combat between NATO-led troops and Taliban insurgents at the time delayed the project from moving forward for 16 years.\n\nWith violence waning since the Taliban's 2021 takeover of power amid the withdrawal of foreign troops, the cash-strapped Taliban-installed government is eager to exploit the country's vast and lucrative mineral deposits.\n\n\"The time wasted in the implementation of the project should be recuperated with speedy work,\" Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs Abdul Ghani Baradar said at the ribbon-cutting event.\n\nEmbed share\n\nThe code has

before the first copper was extracted by MCC while Chinese diplomats praised the progress as a sign of warming ties between Beijing and Kabul.\n\n\"The economic and trade relations between the two countries are becoming increasingly close,\" said China's ambassador to Afghanistan, Zhao Xing.\n\nSince it seized power, the Taliban has faced the task of undertaking the reconstruction and development of a country devastated by decades of war.\n\nBut officials have also found their economy suffocated by Western sanctions and dealing with international isolation that has cut them off from receiving financial support.\n\nChina has been an exception for the Taliban government, with Beijing vowing to pursue deeper cooperation shortly after the group took control of Kabul.\n\nBeijing has been particularly focused on exploiting Afghanistan's extensive resource wealth, from oil and gas to rare-earth metals.\n\nMes Aynak remains one of the most attractive offerings for Chinese firms. The deposit is estimated to contain 11.5 million tons of copper ore, which is vital for electronics components and is surging in value due to its use in growing markets related to electric vehicles, renewable energy, and data centers.\n\nAccording to a Brookings Institute report, Afghanistan sits on some 2.3 billion metric tons of iron ore and 1.4 million metric tons of rare-earth minerals, and the U.S. Geological Survey has calculated that the country is sitting on $1 trillion in untapped minerals, such as iron, gold, and lithium -- an essential but scarce component in rechargeable batteries and other technologies.\n\nAmir Mohammad Musazai, a retired professor from the Department of Geology and Mines at Kabul Polytechnic University, told RFE/RL's Radio Azadi that mining Mes Aynak is likely to yield amounts of copper ore worth more than the $3 billion that was signed for the mining rights, given that nearby areas also hold large copper reserves that weren’t factored into the original plans.\n\nWhile the groundbreaking event at Mes Aynak is a sign that Chinese resource ventures are moving forward in the country after decades of delays due to war, security concerns are still a major hurdle holding back more expansive projects, which often rely on Chinese engineers and other staff.\n\nThe July 24 ceremony was closely guarded by dozens of armed men and Taliban officials made assurances that they would protect staff at the mining project.\n\nChinese workers have increasingly become a target of attacks in the region, including a suicide attack that killed five Chinese enginners in Pakistan in March and a 2021 bombing that killed 13 people, including nine Chinese workers, at a dam project in the South Asian country.\n\nIn Afghanistan, at least five Chinese nationals were wounded when gunmen stormed a Kabul hotel popular with Beijing businessmen in 2022.\n\nCroatia has declared three pro-Serbian officials from neighboring Montenegro undesirable, effectively banning them from entering the country, after the Montenegrin parliament passed a resolution declaring the World War II-era Croatian concentration camp at Jasenovac as genocidal.\n\nThe three are parliament speaker Andrija Mandic, Deputy Prime Minister Aleksa Becic, the leader of the right-wing Democratic People's Party, and lawmaker Milan Knezevic, a member of presidency of the opposition Democratic Front alliance.*\n\nThe decision was announced in a note sent by the Croatian Ministry of Foreign and European Affairs to the Embassy of Montenegro in Zagreb.\n\nThe note said that the decision was made because of \"systematic actions to disrupt good-neighborly relations with Croatia and continuous abuse of that country for domestic political purposes.“\n\n\"The parliament of Montenegro decided to ignore the continuous calls of the Republic of Croatia and not take steps that could negatively affect our bilateral relations and Montenegro's European path,\" the note said.\n\nThe resolution, put forward by Mandic and adopted by lawmakers on June 28, is considered a response by pro-Serbian ultranationalists to a UN resolution acknowledging as genocide the 1995 mass killings in Srebrenica by Bosnian Serbs.\n\nMandic is the head of the right-wing New Serbian Democracy, a party that was part of the now-disbanded right-wing populist Democratic Front bloc, on whose initiative the Montenegrin parliament on June 28 approved the Jasenovac resolution.\n\nThe Jasenovac concentration and extermination camp was established in 1941 by Croatia's Nazi-allied Ustase leaders. Between 83,000-100,000 Serbs, Jews, Roma, and anti-fascist Croats were killed at Jasenovac during the war.\n\nZagreb's move comes two days after the parties of Mandic and Knezevic became part of the government in Podgorica. Becic was already deputy prime minister in the government led by Milojko Spajic.\n\nNeighbors Croatia and Montenegro were part of the former Yugoslavia. Croatia is now a European Union and NATO member, while Montenegro joined the alliance in 2017 and is an EU candidate.\n\n\"Croatia supports European Montenegro, supports the process of accession to the European Union,\" the Croatian note said, adding that it also \"expects that Montenegro will behave in accordance with European values and in the European spirit, and that it will focus its efforts on further fulfilling the conditions and benchmarks in the accession process.\"\n\n*CORRECTION: A previous version of this story misidentified Milan Knezevic as a member of the Democratic People's Party. He is affiliated with the Democratic Front alliance.\n\nThe Homelskaya Vyasna human rights group in Belarus said on July 24 that Darya Losik, the wife of imprisoned RFE/RL journalist Ihar Losik, was released earlier this month as part of a mass amnesty.\n\nAccording to the group, Darya Losik was one of five women imprisoned on politically motivated charges who were released from the prison in the southeastern city of Homel in early July.\n\nDarya Losik was handed a two-year sentence in January 2023 on a charge of facilitating extremist activity that stemmed from her interview with the Poland-based Belsat news outlet, which has been declared an extremist group by Minsk.\n\nIhar Losik is currently serving a 15-year prison sentence for charges that he, RFE/RL, and foreign governments have called politically motivated.\n\nThe 32-year-old was arrested in June 2020 and sentenced in December 2021 for \"organizing mass riots, taking part in mass disorder, inciting social hatred,\" and several other charges that remain unclear.\n\nHe has maintained his innocence and calls all charges against him politically motivated.\n\nIn October 2023, the United Nations Working Group on Arbitrary Detention found that Belarus violated international human rights law by imprisoning Losik, concluding that his arrest and detention were \"based solely on his journalistic activity and his exercise of the freedoms of expression and of association.\"\n\nThe U.S.-based rights group Freedom Now said at the time that the conclusion was made in response to a legal petition it filed along with the international law firm Dechert LLP.\n\nThe U.S. State Department, U.S. Helsinki Commission, Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, the U.S. Agency for Global Media, and several U.S. and EU politicians have called several times for Losik's immediate release.\n\nLosik's parents said in February that the last letter they received from their son, who was placed in cell-type premises where letters, parcels from relatives, and visits are banned, was on February 20, 2023.\n\nA historian who fled Iran in the aftermath of the 2009 protests is at risk of being sent back.\n\nAli Asghar Haqdar, a published author who has been living in Turkey for 13 years, was detained on June 13 in Istanbul and sent to a refugee camp.\n\nOn July 24, he informed RFE/RL's Radio Farda that a court had denied his request for temporary release.\n\nHis lawyer, Salih Efe, told Radio Farda that he had appealed the verdict but warned that if the appeal is rejected, \"it will seriously increase Haqdar's chances of being deported to Iran.\"\n\nHaqdar, who is being held in a camp in Istanbul's Arnavutkoy municipality, is in a poor mental state, according to people familiar with his condition.\n\nHe has reportedly told those close to him that people in the camp are rarely allowed to get fresh air and are mostly kept inside repurposed shipping containers.\n\nLast month, Haqdar told Radio Farda that he was detained in Istanbul during a mass arrest of foreign nationals.\n\nHe said police had told him that his passport was close to expiry and that they needed to check whether he was registered in the system. He has been in the camp since his detention on June 13.\n\nHaqdar fled Iran after a leaked document allegedly prepared by the Intelligence Ministry listed his name among several authors and translators accused of fomenting sedition in the aftermath of the controversial 2009 presidential election.\n\nDuring his time in Turkey, he has been collaborating with various universities and says he had permission to live in Istanbul to use the libraries for his research.\n\nHaqdar is a recipient of the 2013 Hellman/Hemmet award, which is given by Human Rights Watch to authors facing political persecution.\n\nThe United States and Canada scrambled fighter jets after two Russian and two Chinese military planes were tracked in the international airspace close to Alaska, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) said in a statement.\n\n\"NORAD detected, tracked, and intercepted two Russian Tu-95 and two PRC H-6 military aircraft operating in the Alaska Air Defense Identification Zone (ADIZ) on July 24, 2024. NORAD fighter jets from the United States and Canada conducted the intercept,\" the statement said.\n\nThe \"identification zone\" is a stretch of international airspace that acts as a buffer zone where the U.S. and Canadian national airspace ends. All aircraft entering the ADIZ require identification for national security reasons, NORAD clarified.\n\nThe presence of the Russian and Chinese planes was not seen as a threat, since they remained in international airspace and did not violate U.S. or Canadian sovereign airspace, NORAD said, adding that it will \"continue to monitor competitor activity near North America and meet presence with presence.\"\n\nRussia has long had a military presence in the North Pacific and intercepts of Russian planes are relatively common in the area. An intercept refers to visual or electronic contact by NORAD aircraft of foreign planes.\n\nRussia's Defense Ministry said in a statement that the Russian and Chinese warplanes conducted a \"joint patrol over the Chukchi Sea, the Bering Sea, and the northern part of the Pacific Ocean\" and \"worked out issues of interaction at all stages of air patrolling.\"\n\nThey \"acted strictly in accordance with the provisions of international law\" and there were \"no violations of the airspace of foreign states,\" the ministry said.\n\nChina's Defense Ministry, meanwhile, said the joint flight was \"not aimed at a third party.\"\n\nMinistry spokesman Zhang Xiaogang said the action \"has nothing to do with the current international and regional situation,\" while it \"tests and enhances the level of cooperation between the two air forces.\"\n\nRussia and China have deepened their political, military, and economic cooperation since the start of Russia's unprovoked invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nBeijing's military has in recent years expanded its reach farther and farther away from continental China, with Chinese naval ships being detected in international waters near Alaska.\n\nThe U.S. Coast Guard earlier this month spotted four Chinese vessels in the U.S. Exclusive Economic Zone, a 370-kilometer stretch of sea from the U.S. coast.\n\nNORAD is a Colorado-based joint organization of the United States and Canada that provides aerospace warning, air sovereignty, and protection for Canada and the continental United States.\n\n\"NORAD remains ready to employ a number of response options in defense of North America,\" the statement said.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden, speaking publicly for the first time about his decision to drop his bid for reelection, vowed to defend democracy at home and in allies such as Ukraine in the final months of his presidency.\n\nIn an address to the nation on July 24, Biden explained his decision to drop out of the November 5 presidential election, saying it was time to put personal ambition to the side and allow a new generation to take over.\n\nInstead of running against Republican rival Donald Trump -- Biden has endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democratic Party's candidate -- the 81-year-old president said he would \"keep working to ensure America remains strong and secure and the leader of the free world.\"\n\n\"We’ll keep rallying a coalition of proud nations to stop [Russian President Vladimir] Putin from taking over Ukraine and doing more damage. We’ll keep NATO stronger, and I’ll make it more powerful and more united than at any time in all of our history,\" he said in the 10-minute address broadcast live to the nation.\n\nThroughout his nearly decade-long political career, Trump has praised authoritarian leaders like Putin, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban.\n\nAt times Trump has publicly criticized U.S. aid to Ukraine's defenses as it tries to repel invading Russian troops, while his candidate for vice president, Senator J.D. Vance, helped lead Republican efforts to try and block billions in U.S. military and financial assistance to Kyiv.\n\nDuring his term in office from 2017 to 2021, Trump tilted the Supreme Court to the right of the political spectrum, sought to overturn the 2020 election results, and -- his critics say -- undermined NATO unity.\n\nBiden and Harris, who attended an international Ukraine peace summit in Switzerland last month, have been staunch supporters of Ukraine and of NATO's role in helping the country.\n\nBiden, whose term officially ends on January 20, 2025, said that with the United States at an inflection point, Harris, 59, is best-placed to run in an election where \"the soul of America was at stake.\"\n\nBiden had sewn up the Democratic Party's nomination for the election, but dropped out of the race and endorsed Harris amid an erosion of support over concerns about his fitness to run because of his age.\n\nHe had been under pressure for weeks since a horrendous performance at a debate with Trump, where the president appeared frail and confused at times, raising questions about his physical and mental state.\n\nBiden said he became the first incumbent U.S. president to give up his party's nomination in more than five decades because he needed to unite Democrats, even though he believed his record in the Oval Office merited a second four-year term.\n\n\"So I've decided the best way forward is to pass the torch to a new generation. That's the best way to unite our nation,\" he said.\n\n\"I know there is a time and a place for long years of experience in public life, but there’s also a time and a place for new voices, fresh voices, yes, younger voices, and that time and place is now.\"\n\nTrump, who now becomes the oldest presidential nominee in U.S. history, immediately slammed Biden, saying in a post on his Truth Social network the address was \"barely understandable and so bad.\"\n\nHarris, a former prosecutor and California senator, would become the first black woman to run at the top of the election ticket for a major party in the country's history if she is confirmed as the Democratic nominee at the party's convention in Chicago that begins on August 19.\n\n\"The great thing about America is here kings and dictators do not rule, the people do. History is in your hands. The power is in your hands. The idea of America lies in your hands,\" Biden said at the end of his address.\n\nWith reporting by AP\n\nThe Constitutional Court of Bosnia-Herzegovina on July 24 temporarily suspended an election law passed by the National Assembly of Republika Srpska in April, sparking negative reaction by the international community and the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) mission to Bosnia.\n\nThe court declared the law “temporarily invalid,” saying that the decision will stay in place until the Constitutional Court makes a final decision.\n\nThe suspension came in a case to assess the compliance of Republika Srpska’s election law with the constitution of Bosnia. Denis Zvizdic, deputy speaker of the House of Representatives of the Bosnian parliament, requested the court make the assessment.\n\nThe Constitutional Court said the case brings up \"a very serious and complex issues regarding the constitutionality of the contested election law of [Republika Srpska].”\n\nIt said the entity’s new election law regulates issues that are already regulated by the election law of Bosnia and transfers the competences of the Bosnian Central Election Commission to the lower-level entity commission, invalidating at the same time some provisions of the state level election law.\n\nOSCE Chairman Ian Borg and Secretary-General Helga Marie Schmid said in their criticism of the election law that the establishment of parallel structures that undermine the overall security and stability of the country are against the constitutional order of Bosnia.\n\nThe court's decision on July 24 said it must resolve the question of whether the National Assembly of Republika Srpska has the authority to differently regulate areas that are already regulated at the state level in Bosnia.\n\nThe court therefore considers that there are valid concerns that the disputed law could violate the constitutional order and political stability of Bosnia, the court said.\n\nThis is sufficient to determine the existence of the possibility of \"irreversible adverse consequences\" if the Constitutional Court of Bosnia does not temporarily suspend the law, the court stated, adding that the temporary measure does not prejudge the final decision on the constitutionality of this law.\n\nThe court considers that election regulations represent one of the key areas for ensuring free, fair, and transparent elections that reflect the will of the citizens, the court said. Bosnia is preparing for local elections on October 6.\n\nThe court said that the implementation of the election law ahead of this year’s elections “would seriously undermine the role of the Central Election Commission of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\" It added that implementing the law ahead of upcoming local elections \"could cause irreparable damage to the democratic election process, legal stability, and threatened the legitimacy of the electoral process.\""
