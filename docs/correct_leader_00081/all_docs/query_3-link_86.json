        "text": "DORTMUND, Germany (AP) — Borussia Dortmund appointed former player Nuri Sahin as coach on Friday to replace Edin Terzić, who quit the club the day before.\n\nThe 35-year-old Sahin, who was previously Terzić’s assistant, signed a new three-year contract.\n\n“From day one we will do everything we can and work with energy and passion to make this club as successful as possible,” Sahin said in a Dortmund statement.\n\nSahin played 274 competitive games over two spells at Dortmund, scoring 26 goals. He left after the first stint for Real Madrid in 2011 and also played on loan for Liverpool before returning to Dortmund, initially on loan, in 2013. Sahin also played for Werder Bremen and Turkish team Antalyaspor, where he started his coaching career. He returned to Dortmund as assistant coach last January.\n\n“He has worked very hard in recent years to prepare for a career as a coach, and he will show great dedication in his new position and help the team progress,” Dortmund managing director of sport Lars Ricken said. “As former players, we will work closely together and we have great ambitions. Nuri knows the club and its staff, and BVB is in his DNA as a player and as an assistant coach.”\n\nSahin will be expected to improve on Dortmund’s fifth-place finish in the Bundesliga last season. He will need to do it without veterans Marco Reus and Mats Hummels. Reus’ departure after the Champions League final defeat to Madrid was known, while Dortmund confirmed earlier Friday that Hummels’ contract was not being renewed.\n\n___\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nThe Associated Press"
