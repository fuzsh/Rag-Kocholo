        "text": "DORTMUND, Germany (AP) — Borussia Dortmund appointed former player Nuri Sahin as coach on Friday to replace Edin Terzić, who quit the club the day before.\n\nThe 35-year-old Sahin, who was previously Terzić’s assistant, signed a new three-year contract.\n\n“From day one we will do everything we can and work with energy and passion to make this club as successful as possible,” Sahin said in a Dortmund statement.\n\nSahin played 274 competitive games over two spells at Dortmund, scoring 26 goals. He left after the first stint for Real Madrid in 2011 and also played on loan for Liverpool before returning to Dortmund, initially on loan, in 2013. Sahin also played for Werder Bremen and Turkish team Antalyaspor, where he started his coaching career. He returned to Dortmund as assistant coach last January.\n\n“He has worked very hard in recent years to prepare for a career as a coach, and he will show great dedication in his new position and help the team progress,” Dortmund managing director of sport Lars Ricken said. “As former players, we will work closely together and we have great ambitions. Nuri knows the club and its staff, and BVB is in his DNA as a player and as an assistant coach.”\n\nSahin will be expected to improve on Dortmund’s fifth-place finish in the Bundesliga last season. He will need to do it without veterans Marco Reus and Mats Hummels. Reus’ departure after the Champions League final defeat to Madrid was known, while Dortmund confirmed earlier Friday that Hummels’ contract was not being renewed.\n\nAP soccer: https://apnews.com/hub/soccer\n\nFILE - Dortmund's head coach Edin Terzic, right, and assistant coach Nuri Sahin shake hands during a training session ahead of the Champions League final soccer match between Borussia Dortmund and Real Madrid at Wembley Stadium in London, on May 31, 2024.

(AP Photo/Ian Walton, File)\n\nBERLIN (AP) — Greenland police said they apprehended veteran environmental activist and anti-whaling campaigner Paul Watson on an international arrest warrant issued by Japan.\n\nWatson, a 73-year-old Canadian-American citizen, is a former head of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society whose direct action tactics, including high-seas confrontations with whaling vessels, have drawn support from A-list celebrities and featured in the reality television series “Whale Wars.”\n\nHe was arrested Sunday when his ship docked in Nuuk, Greenland’s capital, a police statement said. He later appeared before a district court to look into a request to detain him pending a decision on his possible extradition to Japan, the statement said.\n\nOn Monday, the Captain Paul Watson Foundation said in an emailed comment the veteran environmentalist would be detained in Nuuk at least until Aug. 15, following the court’s decision, to give the Danish justice ministry time to investigate the case and possible extradition. He faces a maximum sentence of 15 years in prison in Japan, according to the foundation.\n\nHis foundation also said the Greenland court wouldn’t allow Watson’s release on bail as he was considered a flight risk.\n\nThe foundation described more than a dozen police officers boarding the vessel and leading Watson away in handcuffs when it stopped to refuel. The foundation said the ship, along with 25 volunteer crew members, was en route to the North Pacific on a mission to intercept a new Japanese whaling ship.\n\n“The arrest is believed to be related to a former Red Notice issued for Captain Watson’s previous anti-whaling interventions in the Antarctic region,” the foundation said in an emailed statement on Sunday.\n\n“We implore the Danish government to release Captain Watson and not entertain this politically-motivated request,” Locky MacLean, the foundation director, said in the statement.\n\nNeither the Japan Coast Guard nor Japan’s Foreign Ministry, which had issued the international warrant for Watson, confirmed they are negotiating Watson’s handover. However, the coast guard, the primary investigative authority in Watson’s case in Japan, said Monday that officials were on standby if a handover is ordered.\n\nGreenland is an autonomous territory of Denmark. Japan does not have an extradition treaty with the European country and it is unknown if or when Watson would be handed over.\n\nIt's not the first time his tactics brought him head-to-head with authorities. He was detained in Germany in 2012 on a Costa Rican extradition warrant but skipped bail after learning that he was also sought for extradition by Japan, which has accused him of endangering whalers’ lives during operations in the Antarctic Ocean. He has since lived in countries including France and the United States.\n\nWatson, who left Sea Shepherd in 2022 to set up his own organization, was also a leading member of Greenpeace, but left in 1977 amid disagreements over his aggressive tactics.\n\nAccording to his foundation, Watson's current ship, the M/Y John Paul DeJoria, was due to sail through the Northwest Passage to the North Pacific to confront a newly built Japanese factory whaling ship, “a murderous enemy devoid of compassion and empathy hell bent on destroying the most intelligent self-aware sentient beings in the sea.\"\n\nMari Yamaguchi contributed to this report from Tokyo, Japan.\n\nFILE - Paul Watson, then founder and President of the animal rights and environmental Sea Shepherd Conservation, attends a demonstration against the Costa Rican government near Germany's President residence during a visit of Costa Rica's president in Berlin, Germany, on Wednesday, May 23, 2012.
