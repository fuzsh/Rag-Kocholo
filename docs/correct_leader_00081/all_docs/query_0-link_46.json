Yale University Press. ISBN 978-0-300-14524-3.\n\nWhile Shamir Hassan says that Nuri warned from the response of the masses:\n\nBefore the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine vote, Iraq’s Prime Minister Nuri al-said told British diplomats that if the United Nations solution was not “satisfactory” the wrath of the Arab masses was liable to respond to the Zionist proposals for Palestine by turning against the Jews. JEWISH MIGRATION FROM ARAB LANDS 1946-49: Proceedings of the Indian History Congress , 2017, Vol. 78 (2017), pp. 886-892\n\nThis quote was listed in this answer as an example of threats and direct actions but Shamir Hassan's version presents it as a warning of a consequence, not as a direct consequence of Iraqi government actions.\n\nWhat is the correct version of Iraq's prime minister Nuri al-Said's quote?"
