        "text": "Hi VV Fans,\n\nIf you follow my threads you'll see I'm very much into consuming content in written and audio formats. I like to read a chapter and then listen to one in the car or at the gym. This allows me to get thru books faster then just reading them when time permits. That said, today's book is \"A Deepness in the Sky\" by Vernor Vinge. I got a legal copy to listen to thru a library site (Overdrive/Libby). This a great source to listen to an audiobook free, but a pain in @ss given that it is comprised of large streaming files and isn't broken down into chapters. Audible lets you jump to each chapter beginning, but this isn't always possible from other sites.\n\nTo that end, I've created a summary list of chapters and rough lengths. If you do the Library Rental thing to listen to it, you'll need to figure out which chapter you are on and do the math to get to the one you want. Here is the list in text format in case you want to copy it into excel and have it do the math for you. Also you'll find a JPG file on the bottom here to be able to download the list as an image if that helps. Times might be slightly different by a second or two....but it will get your there fast.\n\nHappy Listening\n\nPrologue0:36:49Chapter 10:25:19Chapter 260:33:07Chapter 510:16:37Chapter 20:26:25Chapter 270:18:38Chapter 520:30:40Chapter 30:25:29Chapter 280:21:37Chapter 530:22:59Chapter 40:23:48Chapter 290:34:52Chapter 540:22:01Chapter 50:27:33Chapter 300:25:23Chapter 550:13:07Chapter 60:16:36Chapter 310:10:26Chapter 560:13:34Chapter 70:16:55Chapter 320:15:48Chapter 570:20:12Chapter 80:37:23Chapter 330:27:17Chapter 580:10:42Chapter 90:12:55Chapter 340:17:23Chapter 590:23:43Chapter 100:33:14Chapter 350:15:36Chapter 600:08:35Chapter 110:30:58Chapter 360:24:54Chapter 610:14:28Chapter 120:18:58Chapter 370:23:24Chapter 620:12:26Chapter 130:39:05Chapter 380:19:50Chapter 630:05:38Chapter 140:32:30Chapter 390:28:31Chapter 640:16:55Chapter 150:47:09Chapter 400:18:02Chapter 650:27:30Chapter 160:25:42Chapter 410:20:49Chapter 660:13:07Chapter 170:59:20Chapter 420:43:48Epilogue0:33:28Chapter 180:12:18Chapter 430:23:24Chapter 190:37:11Chapter 440:38:06Chapter 200:22:22Chapter 450:29:57Chapter 210:43:07Chapter 460:20:08Chapter 221:26:47Chapter 470:18:36Chapter 230:35:26Chapter 480:10:05Chapter 240:34:35Chapter 490:16:53Chapter 250:25:57Chapter 500:18:21\n\nAttachments\n\nA Deepness in the Sky Times.jpg"
