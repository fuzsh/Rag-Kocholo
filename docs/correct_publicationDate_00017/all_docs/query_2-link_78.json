        "text": "This discounted ebundle of The Zones of Thought Series includes: A Fire Upon the Deep, The Children of the Sky, A Deepness in the Sky\n\n“Vinge is one of the best visionary writers of SF today.” —David Brin\n\nThousands of years in the future, humanity is no longer alone in a universe where a mind's potential is determined by its location in space, from superintelligent entities in the Transcend, to the limited minds of the Unthinking Depths, where only simple creatures, and technology, can function. Nobody knows what strange force partitioned space into these \"regions of thought,\" but when the warring Straumli realm use an ancient Transcendent artifact as a weapon, they unwittingly unleash an awesome power that destroys thousands of worlds and enslaves all natural and artificial intelligence.\n\nA Fire Upon The Deep — Fleeing a galactic threat, Ravna crash lands on a strange world with a ship hold full of cryogenically frozen children, the only survivors. They are taken captive by the Tines, an alien race with a harsh medieval culture, and used as pawns in a ruthless power struggle.\n\nThe Children of the Sky — Ten years have passed on Tines World, and Ravna and the children have survived a war. While there is peace among the Tines, there are those among them—and among the humans—who seek power…and no matter the cost, these malcontents are determined to overturn the fledgling civilization that has taken root since the humans landed.\n\nA Deepness in the Sky — Thirty-thousand years before A Fire Upon the Deep, two human groups, the Qeng Ho, a culture of free traders, and the Emergents, a ruthless society based on the technological enslavement of minds, stand on the verge of first contact with an alien race.\n\nOther Books by Vernor Vinge\n\nRealtime/Bobble Series\n\nThe Peace War\n\nMarooned in Realtime\n\nOther Novels\n\nThe Witling\n\nTatja Grimm's World\n\nRainbows End\n\nCollections\n\nCollected Stories of Vernor Vinge\n\nTrue Names\n\nAt the Publisher's request, this title is being sold without Digital Rights Management Software (DRM) applied.\n\nAbout the Author\n\nVernor Vinge has won five Hugo Awards, including one for each of his last three novels, A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), A Deepness in the Sky (1999), and Rainbow's End (2006). Known for his rigorous hard-science approach to his science fiction, he became an iconic figure among cybernetic scientists with the publication in 1981 of his novella \"True Names,\" which is considered a seminal, visionary work of Internet fiction. His many books also include Marooned in Realtime and The Peace War.\n\nBorn in Waukesha, Wisconsin and raised in Central Michigan, Vinge is the son of geographers. Fascinated by science and particularly computers from an early age, he has a Ph.D. in computer science, and taught mathematics and computer science at San Diego State University for thirty years. He has gained a great deal of attention both here and abroad for his theory of the coming machine intelligence Singularity. Sought widely as a speaker to both business and scientific groups, he lives in San Diego, California.\n\nTitle: The Zones of Thought Series : (A Fire Upon the Deep, The Children of the Sky, A Deepness in the Sky)\n\nAuthor(s): Vernor Vinge\n\nISBN: 9780765399571\n\nCopyright 2017\n\nRelease Date: June 13, 2017\n\nPublisher: Tor Publishing Group\n\nCountries: United States, Canada | Learn more about available countries\n\nLanguage: English\n\nFormat: ePub,mobi | Learn More about our supported formats\n\nDragonmount is a proud provider of DRM-free eBooks.
