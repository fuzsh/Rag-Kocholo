        "text": "So! October’s over, and now I can read something besides cheesy horror paperbacks.\n\nStuff like science fiction paperbacks! But good ones! At least, in this particular case. See, a lot of the fun of this blog is digging up obscure and insane sci-fi & fantasy novels that have otherwise been forgotten by history. On the other hand, sometimes I read, y’know, quality literature, and have stuff to say about that.\n\nVernor Vinge’s A Deepness in the Sky is the latter case.\n\nA friend of mine heartily recommended A Deepness in the Sky to me some years ago– and I actually started reading it some years ago … until I accidentally left my copy in the bar where I’d been having lunch. Friends don’t let friends drink and read, folks! I finally tracked down another copy, and finally got around to reading it– and heck, I even finished it back in early October but put off reviewing it until now so I could stay ‘in theme.’ So this review’s been a long time coming, I guess.\n\nThis is somewhat appropriate, as the action of A Deepness in the Sky takes place over decades, with flashbacks and background stretching back thousands upon thousands of years before that. Vinge has a brilliant sense of scope– though this can lead to one of the book’s very few flaws, in that it’s very. Deliberately. Paced. This isn’t to say that nothing happens (quite the contrary, honestly), but if you’re looking for a rollicking adventure novel, A Deepness in the Sky isn’t quite going to scratch that itch.\n\nA Deepness in the Sky is a hard book to summarize. On the surface, it’s about two competing fleets, from two competing human civilizations, first warring, and then working together as they prepare to make contact with an alien civilization. On the one side, you have the Queng Ho, a civilization of interstellar traders who are (very) loosely based on old Chinese exploration fleets. On the other side, you have the Emergents, an empire of socialist technocrats. Vinge does a hell of a job portraying the Emergents as absolutely vile— which is saying something. The whole of Emergent civilization is based upon the idea of ‘Focus,’ a method of enslaving the human mind and setting it to a single purpose. It’s far more terrifying than standard depictions of mind control in pulpier work, which goes a lot farther in making the Emergents into terrifying villains than typical depictions of ‘AND THEY WERE SPACE NAZIS’ that a lesser writer might lapse into.\n\nAnd things get more complicated from there! See, the Emergents and the Queng Ho arrive in the alien star system at the same time– the Emergents attack the Queng Ho, but the two fleets cripple each other in the ensuing battle. Ostensibly, the Emergents ‘win,’ but they’re forced to work with the Queng Ho as they wait to make contact with the aliens.\n\nThe star they’re orbiting inexplicably goes dark for years upon years at a time, so the alien civilization (along with all other alien life on the planet) goes into hibernation every couple of decades as part of their life cycle. That is, until a brilliant alien scientist starts unlocking the potential of nuclear power to maintain civilization through The Dark, and … well, it gets more complicated from there.\n\nA Deepness in the Sky pulls from a lot of different stuff, which is what makes it so great. It’s got the rise and fall of civilizations that you’d see in a Foundation or a Dune novel. The whole On/Off nature of the star (which is soon labeled On/Off, natch) and the alien world that rises in its orbit feels like something you’d read in ‘logic puzzle’ Sci-fi, like Niven or something– and heck, there’s even a part where the brilliant spider scientist’s plucky kids are kidnapped by bad guys that feels like the part of every Star Wars EU novel where Han & Leia’s kids would get kidnapped again and again. But none of that’s canon anymore so I digress.\n\nDid I mention that some of the most human and relatable characters of the book are greebly spider monster aliens? ’cause Vinge is that good of a writer. The Spiders go through a cold war of their own, with a couple of characters (brilliant but eccentric scientist, his beautiful and hypercompetent spymaster wife, the grizzled old sergeant, the aforementioned plucky kids, and so on) straight out of TVtropes. The brilliant thing Vinge does is portray the Spiders as outright alien– but he works in little touches here and there. For example, ‘Smith’ is a common Spider last name, because any industrial, metalworking civilization is bound to have blacksmiths in there, and so on.\n\nA Deepness in the Sky won the 2000 Hugo Award for best novel, along with a whole mess of other various awards– and rightfully so. It’s a legitimately great book, well worth reading for any science fiction fan. Which, again, leads to one of the book’s few flaws, in that A Deepness in the Sky goes in, well, pretty deep (I will not apologize for that joke), so someone not quite as familiar with various sci-fi tropes and stuff might not get as much out of it.\n\nBut then again, if you’re reading this blog, I bet you’ve been around the block already."
