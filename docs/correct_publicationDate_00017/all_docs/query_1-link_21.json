        "text": "This is the direct sequel to “A Fire Upon the Deep” which I read many years ago. Remember those dog packs with multi-member intelligence? Kind of like each dog is an area of the brain, and together (via radio waves or “telepathy” if you will) they function as a single individual consciousness. A very unique and interesting idea….just like it was in the first novel. Nothing really terribly interesting in the world-building realm is introduced here. Well, we learn more about what’s going on in other areas of the Tines’ world, like the Tropics – where a mass of singleton Tines, too numerous to permit pack formation, constitute the mindless Choir.\n\nThe plot is a bit interesting – the (mostly) frozen kids from the first novel have been thawed out of cryosleep and are now busy preparing for the Blight’s arrival in a century or two (slowed down massively by Pham’s countermeasure in the last book), under the direction of the only remaining adult, Ravna. The strategy is to jumpstart the Tine civilization with help from their ship’s technological archive, thus they can be ready with a defense when the Blight arrives. However, some of the Children begin to question the narrative Ravna has presented – maybe the Blight is not bad, but is actually a rescue fleet! Differences in belief prompt a schism between followers of Ravna and the “Deniers”. Kind of interesting to think about how belief groups form in the real world. There are germs of truth at the heart of each, but they can’t all be right…\n\nOne thing I really enjoy about science fiction and fantasy is the world-building. The author sets up the people and places and events that provide context for the eventual plot … in the end, many times the world is more interesting than the plot itself! For me at least this seems true across many other genres as well … it’s almost always the first in the series that seems the best to me. I guess I crave novelty? Or maybe my imagination goes hyperactive with the possibilities afforded by good world-building, and is ultimately let down by the actual plot?\n\nThis novel really stood out to me for the world-building. And this is especially extraordinary because, although the world seems pretty alien in many respects, it is actual a near-future San Diego. One of the main characters is a poet who has just been cured of Alzheimer’s due to new medical advancements. In fact, he has a lucky genotype that responds so extremely well to anti-aging treatments that he is left with the body and mind of a much younger man, but is somewhat of a “stranger in a strange land” since he was so out of it for a decade or two.\n\nThe big change in society is the extreme network-ization of everything, along with wearable computing and extreme augmented reality. People frequently go about their day-to-day seeing not the real world, but whatever filters or skins on top of reality that they desire. One of the main events in the plot is a virtual conflict between fans of something resembling Pokemon vs. something Lovecraft-inspired. These “belief circles” publicly demonstrate their awesomeness in order to win over new adherents.\n\nWell, anyway, as usual the actual plot doesn’t quite live up to the setting. There’s a bio madman developing mind control techniques (to save humanity from itself, of course) who is attempting to conceal everything from his colleagues in the intelligence community. Then there’s the mysterious “Rabbit” entity (who I think is an AI, but that’s never confirmed) who has superhuman network capabilities and who seems to just want to be involved wherever the action is and impress people with his abilities. The Rabbit is at first hired by the madman, but eventually they have a falling out and Rabbit ends up crushing madman’s plans.\n\nAh, it’s been a while since I’ve had a can’t-put-it-down reading experience. While I don’t think I liked it quite as much as its predecessor, “A Deepness in the Sky” was still very, very good.\n\nThe OnOff star is a mystery – a normal sun for around 40 years, then it turns off for the next 200, on a predictable cycle. Remarkably, intelligent life exists on the system’s only planet – the Spiders, a civilization on the cusp of a technological revolution and spaceflight. This draws the attention of two groups, both of which send fleets. The Qeng Ho are a loosely affiliated group of traders, and the Emergent are a newly risen militaristic civilization, about which little is known.\n\nThe Qeng Ho derive their trader identity from Pham Nuwen, himself a native of a medieval world and taken in by a group of early Qeng Ho refugees. He quickly learns their ways and marvels at the speedy rise and fall of civilizations across the inhabited worlds. This cycle is very rapid indeed to traders hibernating in cryosleep for hundreds of years at a time, while their ships travel at slower than light speeds to their next destination. He figures that the traders are perfectly positioned to try to ameliorate the suffering of failed civilizations, as well as preserve the best technology produced by civilizations at their peak. The Qeng Ho freely broadcast some of their knowledge continuously, as a way to bootstrap fallen civs back to the top. They strive to build up civs back to prosperity, because it is a good ideal itself and also (more importantly?) because it sets up a good market for trading.\n\nBut Pham sees a way to have more – he envisions the Qeng Ho itself as an interstellar governing empire, with ability to prevent civilization collapse in the first place. As he builds up support for his ideas, he calls for a meeting of Qeng Ho at a place called Brisgo Gap. Just as he is about to clinch victory, he is betrayed by his wife, Sura. (While Pham has been traveling and thus is still in his prime, Sura who managed things at home, is many centuries old by now, and many of his descendants are physically older than Pham. Weird.) She opposes him because … “it’ll never work! You’d need an army of loving slaves!” (groan … that’s not a reason! And such lame forced foreshadowing…) Pham is forced into exile – put into a ship bound for a target several hundred lightyears away, and he fades from history. An incognito Pham may or not end up in the Qeng Ho expedition to the OnOff star (spoiler: he does!), still bent on achieving his empire one way or another…\n\nOk, so the Emergents are Not Very Nice. They co-opted a brain virus to serve as a form of mind control, called Focus. The Focused individuals can be tuned to a specific set of tasking, and they obsessively perform their tasks with superhuman attention and ability. For instance, a key character in the story is a Focused translator of the Spider language. Coupled with traditional computer systems, Focus gives the Emergents effectively all the sought-for benefits of nearly unlimited AI, except without the “A” part I guess. And only at the cost of mental enslavement of many individuals! Most of the non-Focused Emergents serve in roles managing the Focused chattel.\n\nWhen the Qeng Ho and Emergent expeditions meet in the OnOff system, it’s not long before the Qeng Ho are double-crossed, mostly afflicted with the Focus virus, and sneak-attacked. When it’s all done, all the ships on both sides are incapacitated and only a few habitats and supplies remain out in L1 orbit. Emergents and Qeng Ho are forced to live and work together for survival, although the Qeng Ho are clearly the conquered, and the morally bankrupt, manipulative Emergent leader Tomas Nau takes charge.\n\nThe survivors strategy is to “lurk” out in space, and wait for the rapidly progressing Spider civilization to mature to the point where the spacers can reveal themselves and receive help (Qeng Ho: by trading! Emergents: no, by force of course) from a capable industrial base in fixing up their ships. The OnOff star flares back to life shortly after the Qeng Ho-Emergent battle.\n\nWhen the OnOff star turns back on, its solar output is extremely elevated for a short (a few weeks or months? years?) duration. This turns the Spider planet into a fireball, destroying most of what was created by the previous generation. The Spiders themselves stay safe, however, as they retreated two centuries ago to hibernation (ha! just like the spacers on their long voyages!) in their deep underground shelters, the “deepnesses,” when the star turned off and air-freezing temperatures ensued.\n\nMuch like Vinge did in the previous book, the Spider’s story is told in alternating sequence with the spacers; and although quite alien in ways they also seem very familiar and even … lovable? Yes. Lovable, monstrous, giant spiders. Sherkaner Underhill is a Spider technological genius who guides most of his civilization’s progress, including a determination to find a way to live, awake, right through the Dark. As the spacers observe Spider progress from their far-away orbit, they are able to subtlety alter events by injecting data at opportune times into the Spider computer networks. In a twist, Sherkaner catches on eventually that aliens are out there, manipulating things, and sets up a great “counterlurk” — while everyone thinks he’s gone a little bit senile, he and his team secretly gain control over the spacer systems via the Focused translators, and in the end avert Tomas Nau’s war of conquest. Pham also sees the light and realizes that even his dream of empire is not worth the moral price of Focus slavery – now he works out a plan to free the Focuses, first in the OnOff system but with plans at the end of the book to carry on the fight at the Emergent homeworlds.\n\nDefinitely a theme of the rise and fall of civilizations going on in this book. First there’s the Qeng Ho’s observations of the inevitable fleeting nature of human governments, when viewed on cosmic timescales. (This reminded me of a similar treatment in “House of Suns“.) Then there are the Spiders, forced to rebuild their own world anew with each lighting of the OnOff star.\n\nThe galaxy (each galaxy?) is divided into “Zones of Thought,” each with differing underlying physics. In the Slow Zone, faster-than-light travel (FTL) is impossible. Outward in the Beyond, FTL is a possibility; also it is possible for more advanced forms of sentience, like true artificial intelligence, to function. Outward still, the Transcend is the realm of the Powers, god-like AI’s (basically) that are generally occupied with activities that those of us in the lower Zones could never even understand. Why the Zones exist (are they tied to gravity – more matter towards the center of the galaxy?) and why thought capability is affected along with FTL travel, is a mystery that is explained in the end of the novel….\n\nThere are thousands of civilizations in the galaxy. In the Slow Zone (no FTL), there’s barely enough time before extinction for a civilization to travel far enough to make its presence known to the galaxy at large. In the Beyond though, everyone’s connected to the “Net of a Million Lies” which functions kind of like Usenet (or blogs) – authors make posts and assign it certain keyword topics so interested parties can follow along. I thought this was a cool way to tell parts of the story – we see events unfold in some chapters as a series of posts from different authors; you get the sequence of events but also the different perspectives and motives of various groups. Some of the posts are very humorous, too.\n\nAn ancient rogue Power, nicknamed “the Blight,” has been awakened by a human civilization. It is much more powerful, capable of vast destruction (even killing off other Powers), and interested in conquest of Beyond civilizations than other Powers heretofore. It’s kind of like a smart computer virus, traveling through the “network” of space. Whatever system (be it a solar system or civilization or other AI) it touches becomes a part of the Blight, under its total control. To make matters worse, humans get the blame for this creation and are therefore in danger from other civilizations as well as the Blight itself.\n\nThe one hope seems to be a refugee ship, crash landed on a world deep in the Low Beyond, launched shortly after the Blight’s creation. One of the protagonists, a human named Pham Nuwen, is the recipient (victim?) of “godshatter” – in a nutshell, he’s had a dying Power (murdered by the Blight) download programs into him, although what they are is kind of unclear. Pham knows what needs to be done, but not necessarily why. Anyway, he has reason to believe the refugee ship has a Countermeasure on board, capable of defeating the Blight.\n\nThe world the refugee ship lands on is inhabited by a medieval civilization of “Tines,” dog-like creatures that function in packs of between four-eight members. Each pack is an individual; the members communicate telepathically and function as one. A good portion of the novel is two rival Tines groups using the ship and survivors (a brother and sister) as pawns in their struggles against each other. The whole pack-mind concept in the novel is unique, well executed and presents a lot of interesting things to think about.\n\n<spoiler>Once Pham gets to the ship, he activates the onboard Countermeasure — speculated as a creation of the Power(s) beyond the Powers. The Countermeasure is as ancient as the Blight itself — both have been awakened and then put in statis at least once before millions of years ago, maybe even longer. The Countermeasure changes the boundaries of the Zones of Thought (or maybe even created the Zones in the first place). In this case, the only way to stop the Blight is to trap it in a Zone where it can’t travel FTL and can’t function at a high level (or at all, probably, since it is an AI). In the end, the Countermeasure pushes out the Slow Zone all the way to the edge of the Beyond (at least), trapping the Blight. Presumably the Zones will slowly recede over the next few million years until the Blight is again near the Transcend and capable of waking…. Sad side effect of trapping the Blight is that the Net civilizations are effectively cut off from each other, permanently.</spoiler>\n\nVery fun and interesting story. As you can tell, there is a theme of networks throughout the book — the Net, the pack minds, the AI Blight “network”. Vernor Vinge is a Computer Science professor and the novel was written in the early 90’s; one has to speculate that he was inspired by the beginnings of the Internet."
