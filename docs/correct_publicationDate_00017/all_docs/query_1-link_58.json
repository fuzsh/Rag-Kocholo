Give it to a chessplayer, say, and he will\n\neat, sleep, and breathe chess... concentrate on it all day long, to the\n\nexclusion of any other subject or interest. An ordinary person will\n\nsoon be able to challenge Fischer or Kasparov; a Fischer or Kasparov\n\nwould become something transcendant.\n\nFocus can be applied to a wide variety of topics, so you can create\n\nsuper-programmers, super-researchers, super-engineers and accountants\n\nand translators.\n\nFocus has some drawbacks. It's easy to set up a secondary Focus on\n\nobedience, so the Focused are easily enslaved. A person in Focus is, at\n\nbest, barely able to feed him or herself. Without care, most Focused\n\nwill quickly die of self-neglect.\n\nThe Focused lack affect; they care about nothing outside the scope of\n\ntheir Focus. This includes family, loved ones, etc. A Focused mother\n\nwould let her child starve while she worked on her program (sculpture,\n\nblueprint, whatever).\n\nCertain tasks are not suitable to Focusing. The Focused generally do\n\nnot make good managers, for instance, or anything else requiring people\n\nskills or a broad range of abilities. There are super-programmers, but\n\nno super-politicians.\n\nBringing someone out of Focus is difficult and dangerous; it isn't\n\nalways successful, and there may be memory loss, personality damage, or\n\neven death.\n\nIn aDitS, the Focused are all Emergent slaves. None are voluntary, and\n\nmanumission is very rare.

I can think\n\nof several people I know who would probably take a year or two in Focus\n\nif they had at least a decent chance of coming out the other side\n\nintact. And I bet there'd be a small but significant minority who'd be\n\nwilling to accept _permanent_ Focus for some greater good. These could\n\nbe the \"loving slaves\" that Pham speculates about... never more than a\n\nhandful, but *absolutely* and selflessly devoted to the common good.\n\nI see Focus as a very very dangerous technology, because of the ease of\n\nenslaving the Focused... but I also see it as one too useful to leave\n\nbe. After all, any group that uses Focus will quickly outcompete one\n\nthat does not. A business with Focused accountants and engineers, a\n\ncountry that uses Focused tacticians and researchers, will be unbeatable\n\nexcept by one that matches its methods.\n\nFocus, once loose, can't be contained. And it's already loose in Pham's\n\nuniverse; three whole planets, plus the fleet at OnOff. The genie won't\n\ngo back in the bottle.\n\nI think the first priority in controlling it would be to develop a\n\nvaccine against the Focus virus. Spread that around first.

Some people\n\nmight accept it because they really were concerned only with\n\ntheir discipline (if it's amenable to Focusing), others\n\nbecause it might guarantee a good living for their family.\n\nI wouldn't. But then I like my hobbies too much to Focus down\n\non any one thing.\n\n(OK, Tricia wants to stay _semi_-focused on understanding the\n\nSpiders. What about intermediate versions of the technology,\n\nwhere you're mostly obsessed but can still realize that the\n\noutside world exists and interact with it?)\n\n>Heck, I've met some... researchers, programmers, artists.

These could\n\n>be the \"loving slaves\" that Pham speculates about... never more than a\n\n>handful, but *absolutely* and selflessly devoted to the common good.\n\nVery, very possibly. I could certainly see a religious order\n\ndoing that, or the Young Communists of the 1930s, or quite a few\n\nother groups.\n\n>I see Focus as a very very dangerous technology, because of the ease of\n\n>enslaving the Focused... but I also see it as one too useful to leave\n\n>be.

It's very easy for a Focused researcher to get\n\nlost down the wrong track, and with a lot of your brightest people\n\nFocused on their own discipline, where do new ideas (which\n\nfrequently arise from a cross-mixing of fields) come from?\n\nThe Qeng Ho beat the Emergents because old age and treachery wins\n\nout over youth and skill, but the Emergent hierarchy never\n\ndetected the Spider's counterlurk. If they'd had more people\n\ndevoted to _thinking_ about the problem, as opposed to obsessing\n\non it, maybe they'd have noticed. Certainly if the Focused\n\ntranslators had been less obsessed with communication and more\n\nwith the implications of communication, things might have been\n\nvery different in the outcome.\n\nPlus, you apparently have moderately high casualties due to\n\nthings like mindrot runaways, lack of personal hygiene, that\n\nsort of thing. Is this _actually_ more productive in the long\n\nterm?\n\n>Focus, once loose, can't be contained. And it's already loose in Pham's\n\n>universe; three whole planets, plus the fleet at OnOff. The genie won't\n\n>go back in the bottle.\n\nAgreed. But... one of the themes of life among the Qeng Ho is,\n\n\"This, too, shall pass\"; no civilization lasts forever on the\n\nplanets. Focus will just become yet another way for them to\n\ncollapse (since you need a fairly high-tech MRI system to keep\n\nit going, it won't last through the Dark Ages, and the new\n\ncivilization may not rebuild it.)\n\n>I think the first priority in controlling it would be to develop a\n\n>vaccine against the Focus virus.

Maybe the Qeng Ho will manage to keep\n\nthe details for themselves?\n\nBut, yeah, there's a lot more that could be done with this sort of\n\nthing.\n\nIt has just occured to me that _A Fire upon the Deep_ is primarily\n\nabout _cooperation_, while _A Deepness in the Sky_ is primarily\n\nabout _obessions_. I wonder what the next one will be about?\n\nTony Z\n\n--\n\n\"The King with half the East at heel is marched from lands of morning;\n\nHis fighters drink the rivers up, their shafts benight the air,\n\nAnd he that stays will die for naught, and home there's no returning.\"\n\nThe Spartans on the sea-wet rock sat down and combed their hair.--A.E.

In some situations, though, \"superhuman\" may\n\nbe exactly right. Look how staggered Pham is by his first encounter\n\nwith Focused attention to detail... \"inhuman\" is how he thinks of it.\n\nA Focused security officer, for instance, might watch a set of TV\n\nscreens with _absolute and unwavering_ concentration, 16 hours a day\n\nevery day for a year.

Wouldn't you _prefer_ a surgeon who\n\nwas utterly and obsessively dedicated to perfection?\n\n>_Such_ a temptation. Such a bittersweet, deadly, temptation.\n\nYeah. On the dark side... well, I don't think the tiny sliver of the\n\nEmergency that we saw really explored the nastier possibilities.\n\nWe've seen Focused security at work. Now imagine Focused bodyguards,\n\nready to throw themselves in front of their masters at any moment.\n\nThey'll be needed, because there will be Focused assassins too.\n\nFocused soldiers, utterly careless of their own lives. Focused workers\n\nin hazardous industries.\n\nFocused servants. I'm quite sure the Podmasters have these; we didn't\n\nsee them only because Nau and Brughel were so shorthanded, and also had\n\nto present an appropriate image. But it's too easy to imagine\n\nobsessively perfect maids and butlers.\n\nThe Emergents would _not_ have Focused religious types. But we'd see\n\nthem if the virus ever got out to the universe at large. You think the\n\n[pick a group]s are annoying now...\n\nFocused prostitutes and sex toys. The absolute dedication to the job\n\nmight be interesting. If you could overlook the lack of affect, and the\n\nfact that the person was a slave. Which most Emergents probably could\n\nand would.\n\nFocus as punishment. I'm quite sure this is how the Emergency deals\n\nwith criminals. Minor offense, life as a Focused street sweeper. Major\n\noffense... well, Anne Reynolt's example suggests that the Podmasters\n\nhave an unpleasant sense of humor.\n\n>> Mm.

Until they die.

And also, there's just a *feel* to them... like there were just\n\na tiny handful at the beginning, and their numbers have never been\n\nlarge. Nau doesn't seem to doubt for a moment that a takeover of his\n\nentire society is possible. And Pham and Anne's optimism at the end\n\nsuggests this too.\n\n>> A group that small is less likely to optimize, I suspect.\n\n>\n\n>Depends on what you optimize _for_.

There are probably long-term failure modes with Focus\n\n>that the Emergents haven't had time to discover yet.\n\nWell, they've been using it for decades at least. Not clear how long\n\nexactly.\n\nThey had already bounced back from barbarism when Sammy found Pham on\n\nTriland, and it's implied (though not clearly stated) that this recovery\n\nwas from the mindrot. Sammy is already using the name Emergents, which\n\nis connected to the Emergency, so they had surely converted mindrot into\n\nFocus by that point.\n\nDo the math: Triland to OnOff, 50 ly at 0.3 t0 0.33c = 150-166 years.\n\nWhich is about right; Onoff is shining when Sammy looks at the sky, but\n\nis getting ready to shut down (\"in just a few years\"). Yeah... 215 year\n\ndark period; it goes dark to Triland eyes while the fleet is assembling,\n\nmeaning it has already been dark for 50 years; it's a few years from\n\nrelight when the fleet arrives about 150 years later.\n\nOkay, so, say the Emergent system is 20 ly from Triland and 40 from\n\nOnOff. Their ram drive is slower... let's say that the QH fleet could\n\nrun (\"redlining the ramscoops\") at 0.33c, letting them travel 50 ly in\n\n150 years, while the Emergents had to hold at 0.3c, giving a trip time\n\nof 133 years to cross 40 ly. So, uhhh...\n\nOkay, I need to do a chronology here...\n\nYear\n\n0: OnOff begins to emit radio signals.\n\n5: End of cycle on Arachna; Dark falls.\n\n40: Signals reach Emergents\n\n50: Signals reach Triland. Park's fleet arrives.\n\n55: OnOff goes dark, as seen from Triland\n\n60: QH fleet leaves Triland for Arachna\n\n77: Emergent fleet leaves Balacrea for Arachna\n\n210: Fleets arrive at Arachna\n\n215: OnOff lights up again\n\n...give or take a few years. Okay. So in year 50, the Qeng Ho at\n\nTriland are vaguely aware that the Emergents have emerged, which\n\nsuggests that they came to power at least a generation earlier. So by\n\nthe time of Nau's departure, Focus had been in wide use for at least\n\nhalf a century.\n\nBut not very much longer than that, I think. It doesn't feel like an\n\nold culture, and the conquest of Frenk was still quite recent. Pulling\n\ndates out of air, we could say that the Emergency began to get the\n\nmindrot under control somewhere between -100 and -50, unified and\n\npacified Balacrea by 0, and the conquest of Frenk occurred between 40\n\nand 60. So Nau's culture is only a century or so old when he leaves.\n\nHmmm... the book ends somewhere in the 260s. By the time Pham and Anne\n\narrive at Balacrea, it'll be around 300. The Emergent culture might be\n\ninterestingly decadent by that point.\n\nOkay, that was a lengthy digression. Point being, you're right, they\n\nhaven't been using it long enough to discover the long-term failure\n\nmodes.\n\nOf course, this is also true of almost all of *our* technology. Won't\n\nwe be unhappy when we find out that alternating electrical current\n\ncauses sterility in the seventh and subsequent generations...\n\n>> > >My take on it is that the thing has just too much potential to be left\n\n>> > >alone.\n\n>> >\n\n>> > Like the Larson locaters?

You don't\n\nget a transcendant chess player, you get an obsessive chess player. If\n\nyou want a brilliant chess player, you may need a team of focused chess\n\nplayers. Certain aspects of inspiration appear to be difficult to focus,\n\nprobably because they come from synthesizing data from many different\n\nplaces. If all that's needed to win at chess is the ability to trace out\n\nthe possible moves and countermoves for several hundred moves, well, a\n\nteam of Focused players of no special skill could do that. If a chess\n\nmaster's insights are entirely bounded within his understanding of the\n\ngame, then he might be a startlingly better chess player when Focused. But\n\nFocus makes the victim less flexible, unable to adapt easily to new input.\n\nChess has very nice, distinct boundaries. But for things that are\n\nfuzzier, like physics or pure math, it would depend on the person and how\n\nthey process data.\n\n>Focus can be applied to a wide variety of topics, so you can create\n\n>super-programmers, super-researchers, super-engineers and accountants\n\n>and translators.\n\nAgain, per above, not necessarily, and not predictably.

One of the\n\ntruly horrible things about Focus is that it can partially or entirely\n\nobliterate volition. It creates a severe, and possibly irreversible\n\nchange to personality. I do not think that this is merely a technological\n\nglitch. Altered states of mind can change people, sometimes profoundly.\n\nThis is what happened to Trixia. Focus will _change_ people in\n\nunpredictable ways. The experience of Focus will have to be processed by\n\nthe newly unFocused person, very possibly with a rusty skill set for\n\ndealing with the emotional, logistical, and personal upheaval. A person\n\nwho's in jail for a year loses contact with people, has his social net\n\nshredded, and often comes out with fewer coping skills than when he went\n\nin. Focus is much worse, since there is no processing of any extraneous\n\nemotions or information. The people returning to the world will be\n\nreturning to a world that has moved on without them. You can lose touch\n\nwith a lot of people that way. Few friends or lovers are as obsessive as\n\nEzr.\n\n>Bringing someone out of Focus is difficult and dangerous; it isn't\n\n>always successful, and there may be memory loss, personality damage, or\n\n>even death.\n\nAnd very possibly insanity, I'd think, going suddenly from one world to\n\nanother, moving from a state of perfect irresponsibilty back to a world\n\nwhere free will and responsibility are daily concerns.\n\n>In aDitS, the Focused are all Emergent slaves.

Vinge presents Focus as something close to an\n\n>intrinsically evil technology... useful, but ultimately destructive.\n\n>This is why Pham Nuwen finally turns away from it.\n\nI'm on Vinge's side. It's intrinsically evil. Taking free will from a\n\nhuman being is evil.\n\n>But is this really so? What about voluntary Focusing? Wouldn't there\n\n>always be some people who'd be willing to take the risk of madness or\n\n>death in order to transcend the limits of humanity for a while?\n\nThere are always human beings willing to take any risk, no matter how\n\nfoolish or pointless. Russian roulette, frex, and that only for the\n\nthrill of fear. With fully informed consent, I might let people choose\n\nFocus, mostly because if I don't, my ethical system becomes inconsistent.\n\nInformed consent, though, would be a bugger in this case.\n\n>Heck, I've met some... researchers, programmers, artists.

What Focus really excels\n\nat is substituting organic brains and bodies for machine automation. How\n\nmany artists or scientists would be willing to gamble their ability to\n\nwork on a year or two of focus? Focused work in teams, managed by an\n\nunFocused person. There's a lack of ego boo available on the flip side of\n\nFocus that I think would act as a deterrant as well.\n\n>I see Focus as a very very dangerous technology, because of the ease of\n\n>enslaving the Focused... but I also see it as one too useful to leave\n\n>be.

You don't\n\n> get a transcendant chess player, you get an obsessive chess player.\n\nI picked chess rather deliberately, actually. Except at the highest and\n\nlowest levels, chess skill tends to correlate fairly closely with\n\nobsessiveness and time investment.\n\nI've gotten re-hooked on the game two or three times now. Each time,\n\nhaving bought some books and software and jumped back in, I could\n\nactually feel my skill level rising as I pumped more time and attention\n\ninto it.\n\nThis relationship breaks down at the highest levels; even if I spent 15\n\nhours a day on chess for the next 20 years, I doubt I could whip a\n\nFischer or Kasparov. I do think I could make him sit up and sweat a\n\nbit, though.\n\n> Certain aspects of inspiration appear to be difficult to focus,\n\n> Focus makes the victim less flexible, unable to adapt easily to new input.\n\nNo... I don't think that's altogether true. Look at Trixia's\n\ntranslations. Heck, look at Ali Lin's gardening! When Pham destroys\n\nhis park, he adapts just fine, thanks. Comes up with a whole new art\n\nform, in fact.\n\nI think much depends on who you're Focusing, and what you're focusing\n\nthem _on_.

She doesn't love Ezr,\n\nbut then she didn't love him before she was Focused either.

This will make\n\nFocusing fairly expensive (honkin' huge malpractice premiums) and so\n\nfairly rare; it won't be used for trivial problems; the invisible hand\n\nof the market will make sure that it's only used where it's _really_\n\nuseful or necessary.\n\nIllicit Focusing might be a problem, but it's clear that a fair degree\n\nof training and skill are required to do it, so it's not going to be\n\n_that_ common.

For various reasons, I believe that it\n\nis acceptable for a person to choose to give their free will away, but\n\nthe process of Focus can be performed *involuntarily*, which makes it\n\nseverely dangerous.\n\nIn principle, free will can be ethically given away to another\n\n(although I would want to insert some caveats about being able to\n\nchange your mind later), but in practice, Focus cannot be an ethical\n\nmeans for doing so.\n\n>> >But is this really so?

But they don't write poetry or read\n\nSF, for example.

Certainly a substantial fraction of\n\nthose who were deFocused were unable to.\n\nTrixia... since she wasn't fully deFocused, we can't know for sure.\n\nBut there is a reference on page 585 that states clearly, \"The\n\nstructures are so deep. She'd lose knowledge she's gained, probably\n\nher born language talent.\" (Anne Reynolt)\n\nAnne herself is a special case in many ways.\n\nI don't think you can draw any kind of causal link between high\n\ncreativity and surviving Focus with your creativity intact, because\n\nthere simply is not enough evidence; yet you are trying to do exactly\n\nthat on the basis of a few anecdotes.\n\n>> Is slavery wrong?

And all the benefits from all the Focused do not\n\noutweigh a single person's *involuntary* loss of free will that\n\nresults.\n\n>Some people might _want_ to be loving slaves, after all.\n\nYes... but that is not the whole picture.

I realize this isn't the\n\npoint of your example, though.\n\nI understand that you see Focus as a tool for voluntary use that may\n\npresent an advantage to those using it and may be palatable to some\n\npeople with appropriate incentives.\n\nWhat you do not understand is that effective prevention of abuse is\n\n*impossible*, and the risks of encouraging the use of this techology\n\ncarry unacceptable costs in terms of the *abuse* of this technology.\n\n--\n\nMatthew Hunter (mhu...@andrew.cmu.edu)\n\nDouglas Muir <dougla...@yale.edu> writes:\n\n> And Lydy wrote:\n\n>> I think this is an inaccurate assessment of the power of Focus.

This is one of the\n\nways in which Focus can create things that are unique, but it doesn't\n\nindicate flexibility in the least. I personally think that the way in\n\nwhich Trixia relates to most personal interaction is tightly bound up in\n\nher translation skills. Focusing her translation skills would, I\n\ntheorize, focus some of her skills at relationships. I believe this is\n\nhow she was able to communicate with Sherkaner. And for all of that,\n\nalmost none of her friendship with Ezr remains.\n\n>I think much depends on who you're Focusing, and what you're focusing\n\n>them _on_.

The scene with Qiwi inserting\n\ncomments at precisely the right point in the pattern which Focus has\n\ncreated is revealing.

If you had asked Trixia\n\nbeforehand if she wanted this, I think she would have recoiled in horror.\n\nLook at the way she reacts to Emergency artwork. Trixia does love Ezr,\n\nthough she may not be _in_ love with Ezr. She loses that during Focus.\n\nThe only emotional relationships you see her forming after partial deFocus\n\nare with Spiders. The fact that she's had many years chopped out of her\n\nlife is significantly more damage than what can happen to a normal person\n\nwith a little obsession. A lot of obsession, yeah. But not a fairly\n\nnormal amount.\n\nFocus doesn't include a useful sense of duration, at least not\n\nemotionally. All the emotional processing that most people do a bit at a\n\ntime as they experience the duration of their lives is left undone. When\n\nTrixia came out of Focus, I wonder if she simply didn't want to deal with\n\nsome of that emotional debt, and opted to stay in the Spider mindset,\n\nsince that was the world in which at least some minimal emotional\n\nprocessing had been occuring. She actually had an ongoing relationship\n\nwith the Underhill and his family while focused. Didn't Sherkaner mistake\n\nher as a machine, though?

I'd say that there are a lot of things which go into making\n\na good or great chessplayer, some of which Focus would certainly help, some\n\nof which it might help, some where you would need the innate talent before\n\nFocus would do any good.\n\nAt the very highest levels most games are draws, and the decisive games often\n\nstem from mistakes--someone gets tired, gets distracted, misses something,\n\nand loses as a result. The mistakes can be *very* subtle at that level.\n\nIt strikes me that if you took a master-class player and Focussed him he\n\nwould probably lose fewer games in this fashion, and that would be a subtantial\n\nedge.\n\nGames are also lost now and then because one player uses too much of his\n\ntime thinking out a continuation, and either actually runs out (forfeiting\n\nthe game) or has to make his remaining moves too quickly. This might be\n\na problem for a Focussed player, at least till he learned good clock management\n\nskills (something many strong players have trouble with).\n\nAnd then there's knowledge base--variations memorized, games studied, and\n\nso forth. I quit playing in 1986 after some really stunning successes in\n\ntournaments because keeping my skills at that level took too much, um,\n\nattention and I wanted to do other things with my life: also because my\n\nnerves were giving me trouble. Obsessive interest really is helpful here.\n\nI was only giving it ten hours or so a week, and I would have played better\n\nhad I been able to make that five or six a day, except I would have gone\n\ncrazy.\n\nObsession is known to be harmful to your health, which eventually detracts\n\nfrom your game because an unhealthy brain can't sustain attention. I am\n\nreminded of the Mule burning out Foundation scientists. This would be a\n\nproblem.\n\nFocus would probably be helpful in avoiding succumbing to psych tactics. It's\n\nhard to say how important these are at the very top. Some players think\n\nthey are--they point to games like the one where a relatively minor\n\nBritish GM played a totally whacky opening against Karpov and beat him.\n\nKarpov may have been offended, or contemptuous, to the detriment of his play.\n\nWhat I don't think Focus would give you is the aptitude, if you didn't have\n\nit already: the knack of picking up tactics and strategies, \"board sense\".\n\nI don't think this is purely a matter of attention. I am good at chess and\n\nshogi, and bad at go: I know many people who are the reverse: for both\n\ncamps, equal attention to the different games produces very different results.\n\nBut I would be willing to put money on any grandmaster player being able to\n\ncompete for the World Championship, or any player of my (in 1985) caliber\n\nbeing easily able to become a master, perhaps an international master, if\n\nFocussed appropriately.\n\nThis one I know I would not volunteer for.\n\nMary Kuhner mkku...@genetics.washington.edu\n\nto...@eskimo.com (Tony Zbaraschuk) writes:\n\n>In article <lydy.92...@gw.ddb.com>, Lydia Nickerson <ly...@ddb.com> wrote:\n\n>>to...@eskimo.com (Tony Zbaraschuk) writes:\n\n>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>la\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>la\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>la\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>la\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>>>\n\n>>\n\n>>>Plus, you apparently have moderately high casualties due to\n\n>>>things like mindrot runaways, lack of personal hygiene, that\n\n>>>sort of thing.

I don't think that there's an easy,\n\none to two or three correspondence between unFocused and Focused workers.\n\nFor instance, piloting takes several Focused people working in a team, and\n\na team manager, rather than the more customary one person to fly the rig,\n\nwith one co-pilot as backup. And Focused people need _more_ additional\n\ncare, not less, up til the point that you decide that Focused people are\n\nmachine parts and not valuable. Even then, the Focused need wranglers,\n\nand the acceptable damage rate is very high. If you actually want the\n\nFocused to survive, you probably need the equivalent of one unFocused\n\nperson per every Focused person to keep them healthy. They need to be\n\nchivvied into eating, sleeping, shitting, pissing, drinking, bathing, the\n\ngamut of normal activity that an unFocused person does by themselves. You\n\nare also discounting the general infrastructure necessary to maintain\n\na steady flow of Focused people to the industries who have decided that\n\nthey need them. Even if the technology is trivially easy, you still need\n\ntechs, administrators, investigators and the like. You can seriously\n\nreduce the infrastructure if you don't worry about abuse, that is to say,\n\nif abuse is a normal part of the system and you don't need to keep track\n\nof trivialities like random inspections and records of who has been\n\nFocused when and where they are and such.\n\n>just about everyone else.

I hadn't even thought\n\nabout it until you mentioned cooperation in relation to aFUtD. The\n\ncentral conflict of aDitS is the struggle between the Qeng Ho, a hyper\n\ncapitalist, competitive trading society, and the Emergency, a hyper\n\nfascist command economy. The Qeng Ho encourage competition both outside\n\nand inside their community. The Emergency wants to eliminate competition,\n\nboth outside and inside their community. The spiders, too, have huge\n\nleaps in technology as a result of engaging in war, which is a competitive\n\noccupation. In both aFUtD and aDitS, trading is seen as a noble\n\noccupation which contributes to the flexibility and viability of cultures.\n\nI'd say Vinge appears to believe that a competitive marketplace is a\n\nuniversal, and often (always?) a good thing. On the other hand, neither\n\nbook is really quite that neat. Competition is rife within aFUtD, and\n\ncooperation is crucial to the outcome in aDitS. As I said, they're the\n\nflip side of each other. Vinge appears to have a very complex and\n\ninsightful understanding of this. I'll note, for the record, that I'm\n\nprobably a syndicalist-anarchist (mispelled, I fear), and not a\n\nlibertarian of any stripe.\n\n\n\nDouglas Muir <dougla...@yale.edu> writes:\n\n>> >It is if the Focusing programmer sets a suitably altruistic goal. \"Find\n\n>> >an HIV vaccine\", say.

This seems to be heading\n\n: back towards either Focus or some more intellectual counterpart\n\n: (ruling out extraneous thoughts directly).\n\nYes, you've skipped several orders of magnitude in sophistication\n\nbetween a heads-up rememberance agent, to direct cognitive augmentation.\n\nSome intermediate points, would be a direct rememberance agent, so that\n\n\"book facts\" and calculation results are simply \"remembered\" when you\n\nwonder about them, automagically. To you, it'd be nigh\n\nindistinguishable from your own memory, so that you'd know the square\n\nroot of 2057 as if you'd memorized tens of digits of it.\n\nBut even that is child's play compared to actual augments of human\n\nmental processes. Reminding of intermediate board positions and such\n\ndoesn't come close, because the intermediate states of thought about\n\nsuch things aren't available to introspection, memory, or anything\n\nelse known. Studies I've read about show that we *confabulate*\n\na rationale for our thoughts after-the-fact, but that the actual\n\nprocess is profoundly unknown and maybe unknowable. Thus, there's\n\ncurrently no idea on where to get your \"hands on\" the intermediate\n\nthoughts about chess position as humans do chess.\n\nNow, improving focus in general might help, and remembering what\n\nyou've already considered might help. But I doubt rememberance\n\nagents or any close descendants of them would help chess ability very\n\nmuch at the tip-top of human capability. In that context, as mary\n\npointed out, they'd become distraction agents instead.\n\nBut for those people who just can't keep track of an agenda more than\n\nthree items long, or a subtask nesting more than one or two items deep,\n\nor who remember the face but can't call the name to mind, remberance\n\nagents would improve things tremendously. Not to mention all that\n\nreference material just as available on accounta being *always*\n\n\"on the web\".\n\n: There's some limited evidence that strong female chessplayers are more\n\n: likely to compute variations verbally, and strong male players\n\n: visually: I wonder if the verbal method would be easier to computer-\n\n: assist?
