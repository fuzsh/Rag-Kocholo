Known for his rigorous hard-science approach to science fiction, he became an iconic figure among cybernetic scientists with the publication in 1981 of his novella “True Names,” which is considered a seminal, visionary work of Internet fiction. His many novels also include Marooned in Realtime, Rainbows End and The Peace War.\n\nPraise for A Deepness in the Sky (Zones of Thought #2)\n\n\"A feast of imagination. As always, Vinge satisfies with richly imagined worlds and a full-flavored story.”—Greg Bear\n\n\"Every bit as much a mindblower, every bit as involving and innovative, as A Fire Upon the Deep.”—Larry Niven\n\n“A brilliant book, one of the best, well worth reading again and again.” —Jo Walton\n\n\"With A Deepness in the Sky, Vernor Vinge adds another title to the canon of Big Picture space adventures that Gardner Dozois has called New Space Opera. A Deepness in the Sky, like A Fire Upon the Deep, presents a careful mix of the dire and the comfy--it confronts some dreadful evils.”—Locus"
