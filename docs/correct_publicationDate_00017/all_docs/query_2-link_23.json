        "text": "Vernor Steffen Vinge (pronounced /ˈvɪndʒi/) (born October 2, 1944 in Waukesha, Wisconsin, U.S.) is a retired San Diego State University Professor of Mathematics, computer scientist, and science fiction author. He is best known for his Hugo Award-winning novels A Fire Upon the Deep (1992), A Deepness in the Sky (1999), Rainbows End (2006), Fast Times at Fairmont High (2002) and The Cookie Monster (2004), as well as for his 1993 essay \"The Coming Technological Singularity\", in which he argues that exponential growth in technology will reach a point beyond which we cannot even speculate about the consequences.\n\nWithin thirty years, we will have the technological means to create superhuman intelligence. Shortly after, the human era will be ended.\n\n– Vinge, 1993\n\nLife and work[]\n\nVinge published his first short story, \"Bookworm, Run!\", in the March 1966 issue of Analog Science Fiction, then edited by John W. Campbell. The story explores the theme of artificially augmented intelligence by connecting the brain directly to computerised data sources. He became a moderately prolific contributor to SF magazines in the 1960s and early 1970s, adapting one of his stories into a short novel, Grimm's World (1969), and publishing a second novel, The Witling (1975).\n\nVinge came to prominence in 1981 with his novella True Names, which is one of the earliest stories to present a fully fleshed-out concept of cyberspace, which would later be central to cyberpunk stories by William Gibson, Neal Stephenson and others.\n\nHis next two novels, The Peace War (1984) and Marooned in Realtime (1986), explore the spread of a future libertarian society, and deal with the impact of a technology which can create impenetrable force fields called 'Bobbles'. These books built Vinge's reputation as an author who would explore ideas to their logical conclusions in particularly inventive ways. Both books were nominated for the Hugo Award, but lost to novels by William Gibson and Orson Scott Card.\n\nThese two novels and True Names also emphasized Vinge's interest in the technological singularity. True Names takes place in a world on the cusp of the Singularity. The Peace War shows a world in which the Singularity has been postponed by the Bobbles and a global plague, while Marooned in Realtime follows a small group of people who have managed to miss the Singularity which otherwise encompassed Earth.\n\nVinge won the Hugo Award with his 1992 novel, A Fire Upon the Deep. In it, he envisions a galaxy that is divided up into 'zones of thought', in which the further one moves from the center of the galaxy, the higher the level of technology one can achieve. Nearest the center is 'The Unthinking Depths', where even human level intelligence is impossible. Earth is in 'The Slow Zone', in which faster-than-light (FTL) travel cannot be achieved. Most of the book, however, takes place in a zone called 'The Beyond', where the computations necessary for FTL travel are possible, but transcendence beyond the Singularity to superhuman intelligence is not. In the last zone, 'The Transcend', there are apparently no limitations at all. The Beyond, therefore, permits a classic space opera, using technology that would push past the Singularity. Fire includes a large number of additional ideas making for an unusually complex and rich universe and story.\n\nA Deepness in the Sky (1999) was a prequel to Fire, following competing groups of humans in The Slow Zone as they struggle over who has the rights to exploit a technologically emerging alien culture. In addition, Deepness explores the themes of technological freedom vs. technology as a tool of enslavement and control. This novel transcends the polarities of a liberal vs. conservative-type struggle. Deepness also won a Hugo Award in 2000.\n\nVinge's novellas Fast Times at Fairmont High and The Cookie Monster also won Hugo Awards in 2002 and 2004, respectively.\n\nVinge's 2006 novel, Rainbows End is set in a similar universe to Fast Times at Fairmont High and is a Hugo Award winner for Best Novel. He intends his next novel to be a sequel to A Fire Upon the Deep, set approximately 10 years after the events of that book.\n\nVinge retired in 2000 from teaching at San Diego State University, in order to write full-time. Most years, since its inception in 1999, Vinge has been on the Free Software Foundation's selection committee for their Award for the Advancement of Free Software. Vernor Vinge was Writer Guest of Honor at ConJosé, the 60th World Science Fiction Convention in 2002.\n\nVinge was formerly married to Joan D. Vinge, also an accomplished science fiction author.\n\nThemes[]\n\nThe concepts of artificial intelligence and technological singularity inform much of Vinge's writing, whether his stories embrace them (Bookworm, Run!; True Names; Rainbows End) or construct worlds to specifically explain the non-existence of these phenomena (A Fire Upon the Deep, A Deepness in the Sky).\n\nA pro-market/anarchocapitalist theme can be seen in other works, either explicitly (The Ungoverned, Marooned in Realtime) or more quietly (the confrontation between the Emergents and the Qeng Ho in A Deepness in the Sky).\n\nReferences in other works[]\n\nIn Gene Wolfe's The Fifth Head of Cerberus (published in 1972, before Vinge had written his best-known work), the narrator finds a collection of Vernor Vinge stories on a top shelf of a far-future library on a distant world, though the cover has been so worn down that he thinks a librarian must have mistaken the \"V. Vinge\" on the spine as \"Winge\".\n\nIn David Brin's Kiln People, there is a reference to the main character experiencing something like \"Vingeian focus,\" a quick reference to A Deepness in the Sky. Vinge's review of the book is featured on the back cover.\n\nBibliography[]\n\nNovels[]\n\nGrimm's World (1969), revised as Tatja Grimm's World (1987)\n\nThe Witling (1976)\n\nThe Peace War (1984)\n\nMarooned in Realtime (1986, winner 1987 Prometheus Award)\n\n(The Peace War, \"The Ungoverned\" and Marooned in Realtime collected as Across Realtime.)\n\nA Fire Upon the Deep (1992, winner 1993 Hugo Award)\n\nA Deepness in the Sky (1999, winner 2000 Hugo Award & Prometheus Award)\n\nRainbows End ISBN 0-312-85684-9 (2006, winner 2007 Hugo Award for best novel)\n\nCollections[]\n\nTrue Names and Other Dangers ISBN 0-671-65363-6\n\n\"Bookworm, Run!\"\n\n\"True Names\" (1981, winner 2007 Prometheus Hall of Fame Award)\n\n\"The Peddler's Apprentice\" (with Joan D.
