        "text": "Not many people have heard of Vernor Vinge.\n\nI reckon that's about to change.\n\nVinge combined twin careers as an academic (mathematician) and science fiction novelist.\n\nIn the latter role, he predicted at least five big trends that are hot right now.\n\nIn True Names he predicted and described virtual reality a year or two before William Gibson.\n\nIn Across Realtime he articulated The Singularity, the notion that when technology reaches a certain point it changes society radically. The books outlines uses for drones. The book is set in the far future, so he got the timeframe wrong, but the scenarios he cooks up for drones were prescient.\n\nIn Rainbows End he predicts the Internet of Things, while also considering therapies that repair degenerative brain disorders. That topic lets him muse on what it takes to integrate spry 70-somethings who have no interest in retiring into a workforce of digital natives.\n\nIt might take a month. Or a year. But I reckon that before long Vinge will be re-discovered and hailed a bit of a prophet.\n\nFWIW, his other books are cracking, too. A Deepness In The Sky is a splendid space-opera-come-thriller. Its loosely-related prequel, A Fire Upon The Deep, takes a while to get going but blossoms into a gripping and very inventive adventure.\n\nRead his stuff now to get ahead of the curve and to appreciate the ideas that inspired the inventors and entrepreneurs now making waves with the technologies mentioned above."
