        "text": "Author and friend of Vernor David Brin made the announcement in a Facebook post, and I’ve seen it confirmed elsewhere as well that Vernor Vinge, who three times won the Hugo for best novel, has died. This is a tremendous loss to the world of science fiction, as Vernor’s best books, including A Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky (Hugo winners both) were the sort of mindblowing worldbuilding and character creation that no one ever did better. Not for nothing, he was among the first to write and talk about the idea of a technological singularity, a concept so common in science fiction and tech industry circles (and of course the overlap there is an almost perfect circle) that it doesn’t feel like it has a progenitor, and that it just existed ambiently. That’s a hell of a thing to have contributed to the world.\n\nI was not personally a close friend of Vernor’s but we met on several occasions — I absconded with him for lunch at the Penguicon convention one year early on in my career, and I think he was amused at my cheekiness for doing so, and I of course paid the check — and every time we met I found him to be lovely, and thoughtful, and kind. Many others will write more about him in the coming days, but I personally thank him for being kind to me in the early days of my career, and continuing to be kind as we all went along. I will miss him as a fan, and a fellow writer. Fortunately his books are still with us. If you’ve never read them, prepare to be wowed.\n\n— JS"
