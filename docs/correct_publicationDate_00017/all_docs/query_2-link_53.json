        "text": "I’m off writing up new posts. (Is my last post not proof of that?) So, you get the last bit of Vernor Vinge material in the archives.\n\nRaw Feed (2003): “The Cookie Monster”, Vernor Vinge, Analog Science Fiction and Fact, October 2003.\n\nVinge is very aware that this story is operating in a long tradition in sf, specifically the artificial world set up for amusement or research purposes. He even has his characters name some examples: Theodore Sturgeon’s “Microcosmic God”, Frederik Pohl’s “Tunnel Under the World“, John Varley’s “Overdrawn at the Memory Bank”, Robert Charles Wilson’s Darwinia, Moravec’s ‘Pigs in Cyberspace'” (I assume that’s Hans Moravec), Galouye’s Simulacron-3, David Brin’s “Stones of Significance” and Kiln People.\n\nI’m familiar with most of these as being about worlds simulated in mechanical simulacra or computers and the related theme of personality recordings and uploadings (which then can be inserted into a computer simulation). I don’t recognize Vinge’s own self-referential mention of “deathcubes”.\n\nI generally like this theme. In literary sf, I’m quite fond of the similar “News from D Street” by Andrew Weiner and Barry B. Longyear’s “Adagio”, but this story didn’t do much for me.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nMore stuff from the archive regarding Vernor Vinge though, in this case, he’s just a small part of a big anthology.\n\nRaw Feed (2002): Explorers: SF Adventures to Far Horizons, ed. Gardner Dozois, 2000.\n\n“Preface”, Gardner Dozois — Brief look at the theme of exploration stories in world literature and exploration stories in sf. Dozois notes that the theme wanes and blooms in interest amongst writers. Ironically, when real space exploration, at least of the manned variety, was winding down, space exploration stories in sf were picking up. They used the new scientific findings for romantic and adventure stories set in space like the old planetary romances used uncontradicted speculations.\n\n“The Sentinel”, Arthur C. Clarke — This is at least the second time I’ve read this story which I did not remembered being set in 1996.\n\n“Moonwalk”, H. B. Fyfe — A man against nature tale that reminded me strongly of Jack London, particularly his “Building a Fire”, and the true story of mountain man John Colter. This 1952 story has the sole survivor of a lunar tractor accident walking away from it, trying to find help from his fellow explorers far away before his oxygen gives out. (His wife is one of the members of the lunar base.) Fyfe even throws in some grandiose descriptions of the lunar landscape.\n\n“Grandpa”, James H. Schmitz — The only other time I’ve read this story is about 25 years ago, but I remembered most of it. It’s still a clever story of the unraveling-a-deadly-secret-of-an-alien-ecosystem variety. It does, however, make me want to read more of Schmitz. He strikes me as just as clever at working out alien ecosystems.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe look at Vernor Vinge continues with another . . .\n\nRaw Feed (2000): A Deepness in the Sky, Vernor Vinge, 1999.\n\nThe only possible aesthetic objection, on a science fictional level, to this novel is that its aliens, the so-called Spiders, are not all that alien apart from hibernating in the centuries when their sun powers down, seeing across a spectrum wider than human eyes do (which complicates and inhibits the development of their version of tv), being seemingly smarter than humans, and, of course, their appearance. While Vinge creates some captivating alien characters in Sherkaner Underhill, Victory Smith, their children and Hrunkner, they are not as strange as the Tines in his A Fire Upon the Deep to which this is a prequel (his “The Blabber” also belongs to the series).\n\nIn every other respect – speculation and literary craftsmanship – this novel succeeds very well. Vinge introduced the idea of the Singularity in his Marooned in Realtime, and it was taken up by other sf writers as well as futurists.\n\nThe notion here that seems to be new is, perhaps, not as startling but perhaps more probable: the idea of a Programmer-Archaeologist. Humans, particularly the Qeng Ho, use computer systems, programs, and languages that have accreted for centuries. Some programs date back to before humanity’s venturing into space. Programmer-Archaeologists are just an extreme example of some of the tasks of modern programmers who try to determine exactly what a program can do, not do, and possibilities for modifications.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nI’m working on new stuff, so you get more old stuff on Vernor Vinge.\n\nRaw Feed (1992): Grimm’s World, Vernor Vinge, 1969.\n\nWhile it’s kind of unfair to criticize an author’s first novel after reading his superb latest one, I must say this was kind of a disappointment.\n\nThe first part was good. It was in the vein of Vinge’s “The Barbarian Princess” with Tatja Grimm ruthlessly manipulating others for her own ends — here to get a kingdom. There were some minor inconsistencies between this and “The Barbarian Princess” (Coronadas Ascvasenya is here called a First Proofreader, seemingly a step down from her assistant editorship of four years in the story’s past. Nor does she mention that she introduced Grimm to the wonderful Tarulle Corporation. (It’s a great world where sf is classic literature.) I wonder if this is resolved in the omnibus Tatja Grimm’s World.\n\nHowever, the second part with its Fortean we-are-property plot and warring aliens was kind of disappointing and boring. Oddly enough, I liked the landscape descriptions. Vinge’s lengthy descriptions in A Fire Upon the Deep were obviously not a fluke (as I recall his Marooned in Realtime had lots of landscape descriptions too).\n\nAnd I liked the details of a metal poor world. I also found the end of this — at least for the character of Svir Hedrigs — uncharacteristically grim.\n\nMy brief look at some of Vernor Vinge’s work continues.\n\nRaw Feed (1992): A Fire Upon the Deep, Vernor Vinge, 1992.\n\nA great book, excellently paced, particularly riveting at the end.\n\nWhile I didn’t like it quite as well as his Marooned in Realtime where he introduced the idea of the technological singularity to his work and others, that book didn’t have the wonderful alien Tines. They are a very well-done, well worked out culture of aliens: group minds with sonic communication that functions almost as telepathy, personalities that shift over time with replaced members (offering the scientific minded Flenser, Mr. Steel (both great villains) and Woodcarver the chance to mold their own and others’ personalities. Flenser and Steel find the opportunity for a sort of biological fascism, custom building personalities for their mediaeval state. The Tines are very bright aliens to whom crowding and sex are mindless.\n\nHowever, I didn’t quite buy the premise that the Tines are held back by their inability to rationally work in close quarters. What about writing, libraries? cientific progress doesn’t always require (though it would to build lab apparatus and engineer things — so maybe Vinge has a point) work at close quarters or close conversation.\n\nVinge has always had a fantasy element in his sf — rationalized via superscience. His True Names had god-like powers via computer link, and fantasy worlds created via computer. Marooned in Realtime had transcedence via the unknowable singularity. Here Vinge creates the nifty conceit of the Zones of Thought — different regions of space which have high-tech, well nigh god-like civilizations and vaguely described entities like the Blight, worlds of faster than light travel, nanotech, and artificial intelligence and Worlds of the Unthinking Depths and Slow Zone with none of those.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe look at Vernor Vinge continues while I work on new stuff.\n\nRaw Feed (1991): True Names, Vernor Vinge, 1984.\n\nI don’t know if William Gibson ever read this novel (really more of a novella) but it is, as Norman Spinrad said, the grandfather of the cyberpunk books. The imagery of Vinge is of the heroic fantasy not the spy and crime genres which Gibson uses in his Sprawl novels. This is quite explicit in the novel’s first paragraph where the magician of the First Age of Magic — implying the novel takes place in the Second Age of Magic — is concerned over protecting his True Name is repeated in the computer hacker’s concern over his true identity. The novel’s protagonist Roger Pollack aka Mr. Slippery finds out the revelation of his name puts him in thrall to the Great Enemy, the repressive bureaucracy of the United States government. However, even though the low-life element of cyberpunk’s “high-tech, low-life” is missing (all the computer magicians in the Coven whose identity we know are middle-class types), the high-tech element is very much the same. The hackers use EEG devices for I/O computer devices much like the decks the cowboys use in Gibson’s works.\n\nBoth Vinge and Gibson picture a world where data and programs are represented iconographically to be manipulated. This is Gibson’s “cyberspace”; Vinge calls it the Other Plane. While Gibson’s cyberspace has hulking, abstract cityscapes representing data, hulking masses for ICE (intrusion counter electronics) and menacing shapes of computer viruses; Vinge’s other plane is much more of what Gibson called a “consensual hallucination”. His baroque Other Plane is a fantasy type world of wizards and monsters. (One of the neater touches in this novel is the fire-breathing dragon in his asbestos Alan Turing t-shirt who guards the Coven’s castle.)\n\nContinue reading →\n\nVernor Vinge died recently. I didn’t note it. When Science Fiction and Other Suspect Ruminations mentioned that and Vinge’s novel The Witling, I realized I have never posted anything about Vinge.\n\nLong time readers — perhaps with trepidation — know what that means . . .\n\nRaw Feed (1989): Threats . . . and Other Promises, Vernor Vinge, 1988.\n\n“Apartness” — A short, vicious story more topical now than its publication in 1965. This is the only sf story I’ve ever read about apartheid. I respect Vinge for his willingness to use current political situations as story grist. He, in The Peace War and Marooned in Realtime, shows ingenuity in the technological sf story, and here he is willing to use politics as inspiration.\n\n“Conquest By Default” — I read this story years ago and forgot most everything about it except that I liked it. I think I liked it even more the second time around. I certainly respect it even more, and I admire Vinge’s motives for writing this story.\n\nFirst, he tried to examine the claims of cultural relativism and “self-conscious tolerance” by our current brand of anthropology. He shows that, no matter how bizarre our earth cultures are, they are all predicated on a common ground of central authority and government. The Mikin have permanently enshrined a state of perpetual anarchy.\n\nSecond, Vinge attempted (and succeeded) a “frontal assault” on the concept of anarchy and how it could be a permanently, cultured maintained. Vinge extrapolates well from the crucial concept of antitrust laws maintaining anarchy. He gives it a history and maintenance of that anarchy by the cultural institution of the Umpires. He extrapolates the effect on Mikin urban growth (none), religion (diverse to say the least), and immense personal violence.\n\nContinue reading →\n\nThe Jerry Pournelle series continues with a look at one of his anthologies that characteristically mixed fiction (not always science fiction either) and nonfiction.\n\nThe fiction selections were reprints and writers selected from the slush pile.\n\nUnfortunately, this is the only one of his anthologies I have complete notes on.\n\nRaw Feed (1987): Imperial Stars, Vol 1.: The Stars at War, eds. Jerry Pournelle and John F. Carr, 1986.\n\n“Introduction: Empire”, Jerry Pournelle — Pournelle logically expounds on the thesis that empire is the government most natural to man and that its time, no matter what democracies naively think, is not done. He also well shows the advantages of empire and that empires can take many forms including the possibility the U.S. is heading toward empire.\n\n“In Clouds of Glory”, Algis Budrys — Good story but would liked more exploration of how Agency would open way for an Earth empire. Extensive surgery and conditioning of main character was reminiscent (or, rather, predates) Joe Haldeman’s All My Sins Remembered. Would have liked more on future Earth history and how global government founded. Technically, story is interesting in that all military action occurs off-stage and story is a “thought-piece” on historical and political matters. Not as good as other Budrys I’ve read.\n\n“The Star Plunderer”, Poul Anderson — First read this story in Brian Aldiss’ excellent anthology Galactic Empires. I only remembered the bit with a slave revolt, but I liked this story the second time as well. Pournelle, in introduction, goes further with rationalizing space barbarians (How, in story, did they get the tech to begin with?) than Anderson does. Anderson has a talent for invoking flavor of epic in language. Manuel Argos, who brings order out of an environment obviously reminiscent of late Republican Rome though he is personality-wise, no Augustus. He is a cold, manipulative, ruthless character who unsentimentally realizes what desperate measures need to be taken. Not a pleasant character but realistic one. Excitement and desperation and the degradation of servitude were all well-depicted. Nice touch in Earth being liberate, and an empire being established, but this is subordinated to the poignancy of narrator losing his love. The only flaw of story was the rather cliched early description of their romance, and Kathryn “instinctively” choosing a figure like Argos. Love is never so simple or instinctive a matter. Continue reading →\n\nWhile I work on a review of a World War One history book, the pulp series continues.\n\nRaw Feed (1999): The Best of Murray Leinster, ed. John J. Pierce, 1978.\n\n“The Dean of Science Fiction”, John J. Pierce — Besides being a brief summation of the stories in this collection, this introduction talks about Leinster’s themes and career. It also relates some surprising information about Leinster. His first story (a fantasy) was written in 1919 (no date for his last work is given – he died in 1975). He converted to Catholicism, and it relates information I knew already – Leinster’s career as an inventor of the optical Jenkins Systems used as a rear projection system in movies and tv. [Leinster’s actual name was William Fitzgerald Jenkins.] Leinster also emphasized rationality and was an admirer of Thomas Aquinas.\n\n“Sidewise in Time” — This story is the original reason I bought this collection. It’s generally credited as being the first parallel universe story, and it holds up very will since its publication in 1934. Later on this type of story was rationalized with, as in Frederik Pohl’s The Coming of the Quantum Cats, the many worlds interpretation of quantum physics. Here Leinster introduces some twists on the notion that many later writers didn’t. First, his plot does not simply have a character or characters leave their own timeline willingly or unwillingly. Leinster introduces the notion of a tile-work Earth where each bounded area enters a different parallel universe than its neighbors do. One world has a strong Viking presence, another has China settling North America, another universe still has dinosaurs, in another the Roman Empire still endures, and in another the South won the Civil War. Leinster’s main character is a mathematician, Professor Minott, who is the only person who knows a cosmological upheaval, which eventually thrusts a quarter of the Earth’s surface into other universes, is about to take place. But he tells no one. He hopes to use the event to become more than just a mathematics instructor in an obscure community college. He wants to find a universe where his knowledge and technology can make him king – and husband of one of his students. His attempts to do this are fascinating as are the alternating sections showing what happens to some when their homes are suddenly bounded by other universes. Eventually, the students Minott tricks into joining him on his adventure (and they don’t follow him willingly for long) leave him except for a female student with a crush on him. The universe settles down, but the story ends with not all the tiles returning to their proper timelines. This is the first example of a parallel universe story and still holds up well. Leinster puts forth many intriguing alternate histories and works out or hints at the implications of his idea, and I liked the notion of a man who seeks to use such a cataclysm to gain respect and power. It’s a very human idea.\n\n“Proxima Centauri” — This is, in its notion of sentient vegetable men, a pulpy story in conception, but Leinster carries it off well, and there are several elements which make it a sophisticated sf tale, especially one published in 1935. Leinster takes some trouble to describe the construction of an artificial ecosystem in his interstellar ship. That, the inclusion of crews’ families to facilitate morale, and a mutiny from the psychological effects of a seven year voyage to the next star were all, I suspect, novel in 1935. Leinster does a credible job rationalizing, via atomic physics, his starship drive but it’s still unworkable. The vegetable men of Proxima Centauri seem brutal, but Leinster cuts them some slack by rightly pointing out that that aliens made of precious metals would probably be met the same way by Earth men, and he tries to construct a biological rationale (which doesn’t really work but it’s the attempt that makes it sf) whereby these mobile plants need animal flesh to live and how it excites them (they’re destroyed just about all animal life on their world). Actually, they’ve learned to live on vegetable matter but instinctually still crave animal products. This may also be one of the first sf stories to introduce an alternative to a fire and metal technology: the Centaurians mold protoplasm to their ends. I liked the human commander, at story’s end, contriving to get all the Centaurians to return to their home world to eat their Earth trophies and celebrate a new source of animal matter. Then he blows the planet up with a sabotaged starship engine. Continue reading →"
