        "text": "A Deepness in the Sky by Vernor Vinge\n\nMy rating: 4 of 5 stars\n\n“A Deepness in the Sky” is a Big Book. The plot unfolds via the point of view of multiple characters, both human and the “Spider” aliens. The story centers around the planet Arachna which attracts the interest of two competing human fleets due to the strange nature of the star in the system — the “On/Off” star which comes to life every 200 odd years and stays bright for a few decade before dimming again.\n\nThere are two main strands to the story. One based at the Lagrange point above the planet, and one on the planet itself as a new “On” cycle starts. The story is based over a number of years as the Arachnid civilization moves up the technological ladder. The story telling, especially in the human segments conveys a sense of claustrophobia and foreboding that contrasts nicely with the more open story arcs that play out planet side.\n\nMr. Vinge explores the concepts of freedom, religion and progress in this book. The science is plausible (no FTL) and the universe is believable. While the story can get bogged down in places as it explores the motivations and background of its multiple characters, it still remains extremely enjoyable read for any fan of science fiction.\n\nView all my reviews"
