Sometime in 1998 or 1999, I had Dr. Vinge as my professor at San Diego State. I didn't realize that he was the author of the book until late in that semester. I stopped by his office to have the book signed, and we talked about science fiction as well as computer science.\n\nI had kept up with him for a few years after graduating, but like everything, life changed and communications eventually dropped.\n\nRest in peace Dr. Vinge.

That is his imaginings were based on internet type stuff, and I loved the cute fun inside references to Henry at the Zoo and such sprinkled through his novels. He was one of the first post PC and connectivity writers to have that built in and definitely reflects the 1980's Usenet style.\n\nI enjoyed reading his stories!\n\nUpvote\n\n24 (24 / 0)\n\nMar 21, 2024\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#16\n\nBest SF author ever.\n\nI'm old enough to have read each of his books as it came out. The Zones of Thought books are epic sense-of-wonder SF at its best. And Marooned in Realtime really drove home the idea of Deep Time.\n\nUpvote\n\n50 (50 / 0)\n\nMar 21, 2024\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#17\n\nThe subject of his Singularity brings to mind this quote from Dune: \"Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind\".\n\nUpvote\n\n17 (20 / -3)\n\nMar 21, 2024\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#19\n\nEven the Wikipedia page linked in the article here for A Fire Upon the Deep is a bit dense.\n\nIt's classic science fiction, in the sense that it just starts out running and keeps going, without directly explaining things. You wouldn't explain your car's internal combustion engine when talking about driving to an appointment with a client, so why would someone explain their ship's engine technology when talking about traveling through space? Picking up how the world works and understanding it becomes part of the reward of reading; the author sprinkles hints in, without being obvious, and then you get little 'aha!' moments as you progress.\n\nThat said, it's not especially tricky in that sense. I doubt strongly that most Ars readers would have much trouble keeping up. Just pay attention to what you're reading, and everything will sort itself out.\n\nA Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky are both transcendent SF novels, space operas that expanded a great deal on the existing genre. Vinge was able to take extremely far-future civilizations and make them seem real in a way that earlier authors didn't. Many of the ideas he came up with have been pulled into mainstream far-future SF, so they're not as mindblowing as they were for contemporary readers, but they're still fantastic, and I recommend them very strongly.\n\nAnd his Tine race is so interesting.... multiple-bodied minds that communicate via soundwaves, each piece contributing to the greater whole. If the pieces change, so does the mind itself, and \"kenning\" (choosing good new bodies to add to an existing mind) is a specialization, both art and expertise.\n\nI was just thinking about him a couple months ago, and was checking to see if he'd done anything new. He hadn't, and what a bummer to hear that we'll never get any more. I'll be kind of sad today, I think.\n\nLast edited: Mar 21, 2024\n\nUpvote\n\n80 (80 / 0)\n\nMar 21, 2024\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#20\n\nA Fire Upon the Deep and A Deepness in the Sky are both transcendent SF novels, space operas that expanded a great deal on the existing genre.

One of my first reads was A Fire Upon the Deep. I knew nothing about it, or about Vinge; it was just a random pull from my library's shelf.\n\nWhat an introduction to literary sci-fi. I'm afraid Vinge set the bar so high, he spoiled me from the very beginning. Nothing else I've read thus far has managed to touch the level of polish he put into his writing. I guess that's why we'll never see another entry in the Deepness universe beyond the three works we're so lucky to have.\n\nUpvote\n\n21 (21 / 0)\n\nMar 21, 2024\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#23\n\nHis Bubble series is also excellent. The Peace War, novella The Ungoverned and Maroon in Real Time. You can get them in the omnibus Across the Real Time.

Vinge was such a great author, his sci-fi concepts were amazing, and his idea of a technological singularity is the basis so much of modern sci-fi. He hasn’t written a novel in quite sometime, but I would periodically check his Wikipedia page to see if he had released something I had missed. I was really hoping for a sequel of some sort to Rainbows End, but alas.\n\nFor those who were never really able to get into his writing, or are looking to for the first time, I highly suggest his collection of short stories and novellas, as they give a great sense of his style and idea without being overwhelming - https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Collected_Stories_of_Vernor_Vinge\n\nUpvote\n\n20 (20 / 0)\n\nMar 21, 2024\n\nAdd bookmark\n\n#25\n\nOh, darn.

Put in your VR contacts, and watch out for those FedEx delivery rockets. One of my favorite characters (who plays a very small role, overall) is the older professor who still insists on using his archaic laptop (believing it's more secure) while everyone else is immersed in VR.

While he thought the technological singularity solved some problems in our observations and answered some questions, he never seemed to have become a blind believer in the concept. His science fiction very much exists in a universe where superintelligence leads to transcendence for humans (and aliens too), but he clearly approached his tales with the questions \"What if?\" & \"And then what happened?\", both of which can lead to good storytelling. And his novels are good storytelling.\n\nUpvote\n\n28 (28 / 0)"
