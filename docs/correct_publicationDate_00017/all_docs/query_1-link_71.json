It’s also accessible from the Politics page, of course.\n\nI’m probably not going to finish the critique and analysis of the No Child Left Behind program I mentioned back on July 20th. I’ve got some thoughts on this subject, but I think they’re probably going to end up part of another project.\n\n(EDIT: Now that the site is hosted on WordPress, I’ll just hide it behind this convenient “Read More” tag here.)\n\n(more…)\n\nTHE TOP 10\n\n1.

Tolkien)\n\nDiscworld (several volumes) (Terry Pratchett)\n\nOne of the interesting results of putting together these lists last year was my discovery that, quite contrary to my own personal belief, I was far more deeply read in the field of science fiction than I was in the field of fantasy. (Hence the shorter list.)\n\nIn fact, you’ll notice that the Top 10 list only contains nine entries. That isn’t a typo. That’s because none of the Honorable Mentions I list seem to quite justify a position on that list. They aren’t quite in the same league. (To be fair, the science fiction list only had nine entries on it until late last year when Egan’s Diaspora finally filled the last spot.)\n\nYou may also note that several incomplete fantasy series have been preliminarily placed on the Top 10 list. Their placement is, of course, based solely on the books released to date, and this placement could certainly change based on future releases. (For example, I tentatively placed Michael Kube-McDowell’s Trigon Disunity trilogy on the Top 10 List of Science Fiction Novels based on the outstanding quality of the first two volumes, only to drop him back down to the Honorable Mentions list after a relatively weak conclusion.)\n\nIt is also notable that there is an inconsistency on how volumes within a series are handled. Why are Pratchett’s Small Gods and Erikson’s Deadhouse Gates singled out on the list, while J.K. Rowling’s Harry Potter novels and George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire are grouped collectively? Why is Howard’s The Hour of the Dragon given particular note as part of the series of Conan stories?\n\nWalt, would you like to field this one?\n\n“Do I contradict myself?

Cherryh)\n\nMerchanter Novels (C.J. Cherryh)\n\nWhat do all these categories mean? Well, the Top 10 list itself should be fairly self-explanatory. The Honorable Mentions are works which just barely miss the Top 10 list for one reason or another. The list of Novels Also By is a result of self-imposed rule which limits an author to a single work on the Top 10 list. The other books listed in the Novels Also By are works by authors already appearing on the other lists which, if those slightly superior works did not exist, would themselves be considered for placement on the list.\n\nThis is not, needless to say, a precise science.\n\nThe conspicuous absence from these lists, I think, is Heinlein. In general, I think that Heinlein was at his best in his early, short fiction. (“The Green Hills of Earth” is my favorite Heinlein piece.) Of the novels I’ve read, the best two are The Door Into Summer and The Puppet Masters, and even those are flawed in fairly significant ways. Stranger in a Strange Land is mush; Starship Troopers is a short story padded with political essays; and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress is a novella padded with political essays. (Which isn’t quite fair to The Moon is a Harsh Mistress, but makes for a nice line.)\n\nGo to Top 10 Fantasy Novels\n\nThe Misenchanted Sword is the first of Lawrence Watt-Evans’ Ethshar novels. The world is soaked in magic – one of those mid-‘80s creations of heavily D&D-influenced fantasy. The attitude can, perhaps, best be summed up by a quote from the book itself: “They wanted to believe in heroes, not ordinary, everyday magic.” (Think about it.)\n\nThe concept of the plot is a fairly clever twist on familiar themes: The main character, trapped in the middle of a generational religious war between the followers of the gods and the northern demon-worshippers, is gifted with a magic sword. Unfortunately, as the character rapidly learns, the sword’s enchantments include some rather annoying side-effects – among them the fact that the main character can’t get rid of it. (One might even say it was cursed.)\n\nThe back cover blurb on my copy of the book gives the impression that this will all result in something of a farce – like Asprin or Anthony in their prime. In reality, there’s nothing particularly funny about the book at all, and it’s rather clear that Watt-Evans never meant it to be. The story would better be described as something of a melancholic character drama.\n\nThe prose (or, perhaps more appropriately, the storytelling) can be awkward at times: There seems to be no trust that the reader will hold on to certain concepts (like the emerging nature of the sword’s enchantment), and thus the same information will be repeated incessantly.\n\nIn fact, there is a general lack of authorial confidence: Even the smallest details are given awkward justifications (as if the author were constantly fearful that someone were going to shout “gotcha!”). Every fact is repeated, and the main character goes round in circle after circle as he considers every possibility two or three times before finally taking action.\n\nThe setting also poses some problems. Ethshar is formed on the foundation of some rather intriguing and unique ideas, but the details seem to vary randomly between cleverly suggestive and puzzlingly vague.\n\nUltimately, the biggest problem is that the story seems to simply meander without much of a point. On the one hand, the most interesting sequences are simply glossed over – probably because the book is meant to be a character drama, not an adventure book. On the other hand, the main character never seems to achieve that vivid depth which would make his story interesting in-and-of itself. And, on the gripping hand, the flaws in the storytelling cause the entire book to wander with wild abandon.\n\nAll in all, I found this to be a solidly mediocre book – neither exceptional nor horrendously flawed. It would be a better book if it had been ruthlessly trimmed of its repetitive elements, with the freed-up space being used to move several incidents banished to exposition into the active narrative. As it is, this isn’t a book I’ll caution you against – but it’s not a book I’d recommend, either.\n\nI’m glad that this wasn’t my first Watt-Evans, because otherwise I might draw very different conclusions about his quality as an author. As it is, I’ll almost certainly check out the second Ethshar book at some point to see how the intriguing and cleverly suggestive elements of the setting develop in the hands of a more mature author. My next Watt-Evans, however, will probably be Crosstime Traffic.\n\nGRADE: C\n\nLawrence Watt-Evans\n\nPublished: 1985\n\nPublisher: Wildside Press\n\nCover Price: $14.95\n\nISBN: 1-587-15282-7\n\nwirOne of the things I like best about Bujold is her uncanny ability to create and evoke alien cultures. (The fact that those cultures don’t actually involve aliens is inconsequential.) The real trick of it, I’ve decided, is that Bujold doesn’t make a big deal out of it. With most authors, every single difference is emphasized and analyzed and justified. The result feels inherently unnatural – partly because the author is making an elaborate production out of it, partly because the author is showing their hand at work, and often because the characters end up being far too self-aware. (Neither I, nor anyone I know, pauses to give elaborate, pseudo-science lectures on why 21st century Americans behave the way they do.)\n\nBujold, by contrast, simply allows her characters to live in the cultures she creates. Perhaps even more importantly, she lets us see the universe of her story through the unfiltered eyes of her characters, without apology or explanation.\n\nOn this level, Ethan of Athos delivers in a big way. The colony of Athos was founded by patriarchs who believed, primarily, that women were a corrupting influence. Using uterine replicators, they successfully created an all-male society way out in the boondocks of civilized space. Now, however, problems have begun to appear: Their original ovarian cultures are dying out, and problems of limited diversity were rearing their head even before the most recent genetic crisis came to a head. Somebody needs to be sent out into the wider galactic community to purchase new genetic material for the colony, and that’s where Ethan comes in: He leaves on the annual galactic census ship on a secret, if somewhat unexciting, mission to save his world.\n\nAt which point he promptly falls into the middle of an espionage mission involving Elli Quinn (a delightful character familiar to those who have read Bujold’s other Vorkosigan books).\n\nCoincidentally, this discussion of culture-building brings up something which consistently puzzles me: A lot of people seem to have the belief that Bujold’s work is light on the science fiction. Or, in other words, that her work only has a thin layer of science fiction thrown in to make them genre works. The only explanation I have for this belief is that Bujold is simply too subtle a writer for these people.\n\nAt first glance, Ethan of Athos is a simple adventure story starring a protagonist from an unusual culture. But take a closer look: That unusual culture is, in fact, a very sophisticated extrapolation of how technology will affect human society. And Bujold works in a complete analysis of the consequences and mindset of that culture, even while you’re busy turning the pages for the exciting payoffs of the adventure story – she just refuses to Emphasize It With Capital Letters and Long Speeches Explaining the Point.\n\nAnd against all of this, Bujold weaves yet another theme: A softly-played, emotionally-packed character drama.\n\nWhich brings me to another thing that I like about Bujold: Her humor. It’s believable and real and rib-achingly funny. It’s the humor of actual people living in an actual world, and it demonstrates the vividness with which Bujold evokes her stories. And, like most living humor, its all about context. (You’ll see what I mean when you understand the line: “Apparently they had committees on Kline Station, too…”)\n\nSo, we’ve got great prose, keen foresights, a fully-realized world, compelling characters, and an exciting plot.\n\nAnd this is one of Bujold’s weaker novels? There’s little doubt in my mind that she’s the best science fiction author writing today.\n\nGRADE: A-\n\nLois McMaster Bujold\n\nPublisher: 1986\n\nPublisher: Baen Books\n\nCover Price: $5.99\n\nISBN: 0-671-65604-X"
