        "text": "prologue\n\nThe manhunt extended across more than one hundred light-years and eight centuries. It had always been a secret search, unacknowledged even among some of the participants. In the early years, it had simply been encrypted queries hidden in radio broadcasts. Decades and centuries passed. There were clues, interviews with The Man’s fellow travelers, pointers in a half dozen contradictory directions: The Man was alone now and heading still farther away; The Man had died before the search ever began; The Man had a war fleet and was coming back upon them.\n\nWith time, there was some consistency to the most credible stories. The evidence was solid enough that certain ships changed schedules and burned decades of time to look for more clues. Fortunes were lost because of the detours and delays, but the losses were to a few of the largest trading Families, and went unacknowledged. They were rich enough, and this search was important enough, that it scarcely mattered. For the search had narrowed: The Man was traveling alone, a vague blur of multiple identities, a chain of one-shot jobs on minor trading vessels, but always moving back and back into this end of Human Space. The hunt narrowed from a hundred light-years, to fifty, to twenty—and a half dozen star systems.\n\nAnd finally, the manhunt came down to a single world at the coreward end of Human Space. Now Sammy could justify a fleet specially for the end of the hunt. The crew and even most of the owners would not know the mission’s true purpose, but he had a good chance of finally ending the search.\n\nSammy himself went groundside on Triland. For once, it made sense for a Fleet Captain to do the detail work: Sammy was the only one in the fleet who had actually met The Man in person. And given the present popularity of his fleet here, he could cut through whatever bureaucratic nonsense might come up. Those were good reasons … but Sammy would be down here in any case. I have waited so long, and in a little while we’ll have him.\n\nWhy should I help you find anyone! I’m not your mother! The little man had backed into his inner office space. Behind him, a door was cracked five centimeters wide. Sammy caught a glimpse of a child peeking out fearfully at them. The little man shut the door firmly. He glared at the Forestry constables who had preceded Sammy into the building. I’ll tell you one more time: My place of business is the net. If you didn’t find what you want there, then it’s not available from me.\n\n’Scuse me. Sammy tapped the nearest constable on the shoulder. ’Scuse me. He slipped through the ranks of his protectors.\n\nThe proprietor could see that someone tall was coming through. He reached toward his desk. Lordy. If he trashed the databases he had distributed across the net, they’d get nothing out of him.\n\nBut the fellow’s gesture froze. He stared in shock at Sammy’s face. Admiral?\n\nUm, ‘Fleet Captain,’ if you please.\n\nYes, yes! We’ve been watching you on the news every day now. Please! Sit down. You’re the source of the inquiry?\n\nThe change in manner was like a flower opening to the sunlight. Apparently the Qeng Ho was just as popular with the city folk as it was with the Forestry Department. In a matter of seconds, the proprietor—the private investigator, as he called himself—had pulled up records and started search programs. … Hmm. You don’t have a name, or a good physical description, just a probable arrival date. Okay, now Forestry claims your fellow must have become someone named ‘Bidwel Ducanh.’ His gaze slid sideways to the silent constables, and he smiled. They’re very good at reaching nonsense conclusions from insufficient information. In this case… He did something with his search programs. Bidwel Ducanh. Yeah, now that I search for it, I remember hearing about that fellow. Sixty or a hundred years ago he made some kind of a name for himself. A figure that had come from nowhere, with a moderate amount of money and an uncanny flair for self-advertisement. In a period of thirty years, he had gathered the support of several major corporations and even the favor of the Forestry Department. Ducanh claimed to be a city person, but he was no freedom fighter. He wanted to spend money on some crazy, long-term scheme. What was it? He wanted to… The private investigator looked up from his reading to stare a moment at Sammy. He wanted to finance an expedition to the OnOff star!\n\nSammy just nodded.\n\nDamn! If he had been successful, Triland would have an expedition partway there right now. The investigator was silent for a moment, seeming to contemplate the lost opportunity. He looked back at his records. And you know, he almost succeeded. A world like ours would have to bankrupt itself to go interstellar. But sixty years ago, a single Qeng Ho starship visited Triland. Course, they didn’t want to break their schedule, but some of Ducanh’s supporters were hoping they’d help out. Ducanh wouldn’t have anything to do with the idea, wouldn’t even talk to the Qeng Ho. After that, Bidwel Ducanh pretty much lost his credibility.… He faded from sight.\n\nAll this was in Triland’s Forestry Department records. Sammy said, Yes. We’re interested in where this individual is now. There had been no interstellar vessel in Triland’s solar system for sixty years. He is here!\n\nAh, so you figure he may have some extra information, something that would be useful even after what’s happened the last three years?\n\nSammy resisted an impulse to violence. A little more patience now, what more could it cost after the centuries of waiting? Yes, he said, benignly judicious, it would be good to cover all the angles, don’t you think?\n\nRight. You’ve come to the right place. I know city things that the Forestry people never bother to track. I really want to help. He was watching some kind of scanning analysis, so this was not completely wasted time. These alien radio messages are going to change our world, and I want my children to—\n\nThe investigator frowned. Huh! You just missed this Bidwel character, Fleet Captain. See, he’s been dead for ten years.\n\nSammy didn’t say anything, but his mild manner must have slipped; the little man flinched when he looked up at him. I-I’m sorry, sir. Perhaps he left some effects, a will.\n\nIt can’t be. Not when I’m so close. But it was a possibility that Sammy had always known. It was the commonplace in a universe of tiny lifetimes and interstellar distances. I suppose we are interested in any data the man left behind. The words came out dully. At least we have closure—that would be the concluding line from some smarmy intelligence analyst.\n\nThe investigator tapped and muttered at his devices. The Forestry Department had reluctantly identified him as one of the best of the city class, so well distributed that they could not simply confiscate his equipment to take him over. He was genuinely trying to be helpful.… There may be a will, Fleet Captain, but it’s not on the Grandville net.\n\nSome other city, then? The fact that the Forestry Department had partitioned the urban networks was a very bad sign for Triland’s future.\n\n… Not exactly. See, Ducanh died at one of Saint Xupere’s Pauper Cemeteria, the one in Lowcinder. It looks like the monks have held on to his effects. I’m sure they would give them up in return for a decent-sized donation. His eyes returned to the constables and his expression hardened. Maybe he recognized the oldest one, the Commissioner of Urban Security. No doubt they could shake down the monks with no need for any contribution.\n\nSammy rose and thanked the private investigator; his words sounded wooden even to himself. As he walked back toward the door and his escort, the investigator came quickly around his desk and followed him. Sammy realized with abrupt embarrassment that the fellow hadn’t been paid. He turned back, feeling a sudden liking for the guy. He admired someone who would demand his pay in the face of unfriendly cops. Here, Sammy started to say, this is what I can—\n\nBut the fellow held up his hands. No, not necessary. But there is a favor I would like from you. See, I have a big family, the brightest kids you’ve ever seen. This joint expedition isn’t going to leave Triland for another five or ten years, right? Can you make sure that my kids, even one of them—?\n\nSammy cocked his head. Favors connected with mission success came very dear. I’m sorry, sir, he said as gently as he could. Your children will have to compete with everyone else. Have them study hard in college. Have them target the specialties that are announced. That will give them the best chance.\n\nYes, Fleet Captain! That is exactly the favor that I am asking. Would you see to it— He swallowed and looked fiercely at Sammy, ignoring the others. —would you see to it that they are allowed to undertake college studies?\n\nCertainly. A little grease on academic entrance requirements didn’t bother Sammy at all. Then he realized what the other was really saying. Sir, I’ll make sure of it.\n\nThank you. Thank you! He touched his business card into Sammy’s hand. There’s my name and stats. I’ll keep it up-to-date. Please remember.\n\nYes, uh, Mr. Bonsol, I’ll remember. It was a classic Qeng Ho deal.\n\nThe city dropped away beneath the Forestry Department flyer. Grandville had only about half a million inhabitants, but they were crammed into a snarled slum, the air above them shimmering with summer heat. The First Settlers’ forest lands spread away for thousands of kilometers around it, virgin terraform wilderness.\n\nThey boosted high into clean indigo air, arcing southward. Sammy ignored the Triland Urban Security boss sitting right beside him; just now he had neither the need nor the desire to be diplomatic. He punched a connection to his Deputy Fleet Captain. Kira Lisolet’s autoreport streamed across his vision. Sum Dotran had agreed to the schedule change: all the fleet would be going to the OnOff star.\n\nSammy! Kira’s voice cut across the automatic report. How did it go? Kira Lisolet was the only other person in the fleet who knew the true purpose of this mission, the manhunt.\n\nI— We lost him, Kira. But Sammy couldn’t say the words. See for yourself, Kira. The last two thousand seconds of my pov. I’m headed back to Lowcinder now … one last loose end to tie down.\n\nThere was a pause. Lisolet was fast with an indexed scan. After a moment he heard her curse to herself. Okay … but do tie that last loose end, Sammy. There were times before when we were sure we’d lost him.\n\nNever like this, Kira.\n\nI said, you make absolutely sure. There was steel in the woman’s voice. Her people owned a big hunk of the fleet. She owned one ship herself. In fact, she was the only operational owner on the mission. Most times, that was not a problem. Kira Pen Lisolet was a reasonable person on almost all issues. This was one of the exceptions.\n\nI’ll make sure, Kira. You know that. Sammy was suddenly conscious of the Triland Security boss at his elbow—and he remembered what he had accidentally discovered a few moments earlier. How are things topside?\n\nHer response was light, a kind of apology. Great. I got the shipyard waivers. The deals with the industrial moons and the asteroid mines look solid. We’re continuing with detailed planning. I still think we can be equipped and specialist-crewed in three hundred Msec. You know how much the Trilanders want a cut of this mission. He heard the smile in her voice. Their link was encrypted, but she knew that his end was emphatically not secure. Triland was a customer and soon to be a mission partner, but they should know just where they stood.\n\n\"Very good. Add something to the list, if it’s not already there: ‘Per our desire for the best specialist crew possible, we require that the Forestry Department’s university programs be open to all those who pass our tests, not just the heirs of First Settlers.’\"\n\nOf course… A second passed, just enough time for a double take. Lord, how could we miss something like that? We missed it because some fools are very hard to underestimate.\n\nA thousand seconds later, Lowcinder was rising toward them. This was almost thirty degrees south latitude. The frozen desolation that spread around it looked like the pre-Arrival pictures of equatorial Triland, five hundred years ago, before the First Settlers began tweaking the greenhouse gases and building the exquisite structure that is a terraform ecology.\n\nLowcinder itself was near the center of an extravagant black stain, the product of centuries of nucleonically clean rocket fuels. This was Triland’s largest groundside spaceport, yet the city’s recent growth was as grim and slumlike as all the others on the planet.\n\nTheir flyer switched to fans and trundled across the city, slowly descending. The sun was very low, and the streets were mostly in twilight. But every kilometer the streets seemed narrower. Custom composites gave way to cubes that might have once been cargo containers. Sammy watched grimly. The First Settlers had worked for centuries to create a beautiful world; now it was exploding out from under them. It was a common problem in terraformed worlds. There were at least five reasonably painless methods of accommodating the terraform’s final success. But if the First Settlers and their Forestry Department were not willing to adopt any of them … well, there might not be a civilization here to welcome his fleet’s return. Sometime soon, he must have a heart-to-heart chat with members of the ruling class.\n\nHis thoughts were brought back to the present as the flyer dumped down between blocky tenements. Sammy and his Forestry goons walked through half-frozen slush. Piles of clothing—donations?—lay jumbled in boxes on the steps of the building they approached. The goons detoured around them. Then they were up the steps and indoors.\n\nThe cemeterium’s manager called himself Brother Song, and he looked old unto death. Bidwel Ducanh? His gaze slid nervously away from Sammy. Brother Song did not recognize Sammy’s face, but he knew the Forestry Department. Bidwel Ducanh died ten years ago.\n\nHe was lying. He was lying.\n\nSammy took a deep breath and looked around the dingy room. Suddenly he felt as dangerous as some fleet scuttlebutt made him out to be. God forgive me, but I will do anything to get the truth from this man. He looked back at Brother Song and attempted a friendly smile. It must not have come out quite right; the old man stepped back a pace. A cemeterium is a place for people to die, is that right, Brother Song?\n\nIt is a place for all to live to the natural fullness of their time. We use all the money that people bring, to help all the people who come. In the perverse Triland situation, Brother Song’s primitivism made a terrible kind of sense. He helped the sickest of the poorest as well as he could.\n\nSammy held up his hand. I will donate one hundred years of budget to each of your order’s cemeteria … if you take me to Bidwel Ducanh.\n\nI— Brother Song took another step backward, and sat down heavily. Somehow he knew that Sammy could make good on his offer. Maybe … But then the old man looked up at Sammy and there was a desperate stubbornness in his stare. No. Bidwel Ducanh died ten years ago.\n\nSammy walked across the room and grasped the arms of the old man’s chair. He brought his face down close to the other’s. You know these people I’ve brought with me. Do you doubt that if I give the word, they will take your cemeterium apart, piece by piece? Do you doubt that if we don’t find what I seek here, we’ll do the same to every cemeterium of your order, all over this world?\n\nIt was clear that Brother Song did not doubt. He knew the Forestry Department. Yet for a moment Sammy was afraid that Song would stand up even to that. And I will then do what I must do. Abruptly, the old man seemed to crumple in on himself, weeping silently.\n\nSammy stood back from his chair. Some seconds passed. The old man stopped crying and struggled to his feet. He didn’t look at Sammy or gesture; he simply shuffled out of the room.\n\nSammy and his entourage followed. They walked single file down a long corridor. There was horror here. It wasn’t in the dim and broken lighting or the water-stained ceiling panels or the filthy floor. Along the corridor, people sat on sofas or wheeled chairs. They sat, and stared … at nothing. At first, Sammy thought they were wearing head-up displays, that their vision was far away, maybe in some consensual imagery. After all, a few of them were talking, a few of them were making constant, complicated gestures. Then he noticed that the signs on the walls were painted there. The plain, peeling wall material was simply all there was to see. And the withered people sitting in the hall had eyes that were naked and vacant.\n\nSammy walked close behind Brother Song. The monk was talking to himself, but the words made sense. He was talking about The Man: Bidwel Ducanh was not a kindly man. He was not someone you could like, even at the beginning … especially at the beginning. He said he had been rich, but he brought us nothing. The first thirty years, when I was young, he worked harder than any of us. There was no job too dirty, no job too hard. But he had ill to say of everyone. He mocked everyone. He would sit by a patient through the last night of life, and then afterward sneer. Brother Song was speaking in the past tense, but after a few seconds Sammy realized that he was not trying to convince Sammy of anything. Song was not even talking to himself. It was as if he were speaking a wake for someone he knew would be dead very soon. And then as the years passed, like all the rest of us, he could help less and less. He talked about his enemies, how they would kill him if they ever found him. He laughed when we promised to hide him. In the end, only his meanness survived—and that without speech.\n\nBrother Song stopped before a large door. The sign above it was brave and floral: TO THE SUNROOM.\n\nDucanh will be the one watching the sunset. But, the monk did not open the door. He stood with his head bowed, not quite blocking the way.\n\nSammy started to walk around him, then stopped, and said, The payment I mentioned: It will be deposited to your order’s account. The old man didn’t look up at him. He spat on Sammy’s jacket and then walked back down the hall, pushing past the constables.\n\nSammy turned and pulled at the door’s mechanical latch.\n\nSir? It was the Commissioner of Urban Security. The cop-bureaucrat stepped close and spoke softly. Um. We didn’t want this escort job, sir. This should have been your own people.\n\nHuh? I agree, Commissioner. So why didn’t you let me bring them?\n\nIt wasn’t my decision. I think they figured that constables would be more discreet. The cop looked away. Look, Fleet Captain. We know you Qeng Ho carry grudges a long time.\n\nSammy nodded, although that truth applied more to customer civilizations than to individuals.\n\nThe cop finally looked him in the eye. Okay. We’ve cooperated. We made sure that nothing about your search could leak back to your … target. But we won’t do this guy for you. We’ll look the other way; we won’t stop you. But I won’t do him.\n\nAh. Sammy tried to imagine just where in the moral pantheon this fellow would fit. Well, Commissioner, staying out of my way is all that is required. I can take care of this myself.\n\nThe cop gave a jerky nod. He stepped back, and didn’t follow when Sammy opened the door to the sunroom.\n\nThe air was chill and stale, an improvement over the rank humidity of the hallway. Sammy walked down a dark stairway. He was still indoors, but not by much. This had been an exterior entrance once, leading down to street level. Plastic sheeting walled it in now, creating some kind of sheltered patio.\n\nWhat if he’s like the wretches in the hallway? They reminded him of people who lived beyond the capabilities of medical support. Or the victims of a mad experimentory. Their minds had died in pieces. That was a finish he had never seriously considered, but now …\n\nSammy reached the bottom of the stairs. Around the corner was the promise of daylight. He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth and stood quietly for a long moment.\n\nDo it. Sammy walked forward, into a large room. It looked like part of the parking lot, but tented with semiopaque plastic sheets. There was no heating, and drafts thuttered past breaks in the plastic. A few heavily bundled forms were scattered in chairs across the open space. They sat facing in no particular direction; some were looking into the gray stone of the exterior wall.\n\nAll that barely registered on Sammy. At the far end of the room, a column of sunlight fell low and slanting through a break in the roof. A single person had contrived to sit in the middle of that light.\n\nSammy walked slowly across the room, his eyes never leaving the figure that sat in the red-and-gold light of sunset. The face had a racial similarity to the high Qeng Ho Families, but it was not the face that Sammy remembered. No matter. The Man would have changed his face long ago. Besides, Sammy had a DNA counter in his jacket, and a copy of The Man’s true DNA code.\n\nHe was bundled in blankets and wore a heavy knit cap. He didn’t move but he seemed to be watching something, watching the sunset. It’s him. The conviction came without rational thought, an emotional wave breaking over him. Maybe incomplete, but this is him.\n\nSammy took a loose chair and sat down facing the figure in the light. A hundred seconds passed. Two hundred. The last rays of sunset were fading. The Man’s stare was blank, but he reacted to the coolness on his face. His head moved, vaguely searching, and he seemed to notice his visitor. Sammy turned so his face was lit by the sunset sky. Something came into the other’s eyes, puzzlement, memories swimming up from the depths. Abruptly, The Man’s hands came out of his blankets and jerked clawlike at Sammy’s face.\n\nYou!\n\nYes, sir. Me. The search of eight centuries was over.\n\nThe Man shifted uncomfortably in his wheeled chair, rearranging his blankets. He was silent for some seconds, and when he finally spoke, his words were halting. I knew your … kind would still be looking for me. I financed this damn Xupere cult, but I always knew … it might not be enough. He shifted again on the chair. There was a glitter in his eyes that Sammy had never seen in the old days. Don’t tell me. Each Family pitched in a little. Maybe every Qeng Ho ship has one crewmember who keeps a lookout for me.\n\nHe had no concept of the search that had finally found him. We mean you no harm, sir.\n\nThe Man gave a rasp of a laugh, not arguing, but certainly disbelieving. It’s my bad luck that you would be the agent they assigned to Triland. You’re smart enough to find me. They should have done better by you, Sammy. You should be a Fleet Captain and more, not some assassin errand boy. He shifted again, reached down as if to scratch his butt. What was it? Hemorrhoids? Cancer? Lordy, I bet he’s sitting on a handgun. He’s been ready all these years, and now it’s tangled up in the blankets.\n\nSammy leaned forward earnestly. The Man was stringing him along. Fine. It might be the only way he would talk at all. So we were finally lucky, sir. Myself, I guessed you might come here, because of the OnOff star.\n\nThe surreptitious probing of blankets paused for a moment. A sneer flickered across the old man’s face. It’s only fifty light-years away, Sammy. The nearest astrophysical enigma to Human Space. And you ball-less Qeng Ho wonders have never visited it. Holy profit is all your kind ever cared about. He waved his right hand forgivingly, while his left dug deeper into the blankets. \"But then, the whole human race is just as bad. Eight thousand years of telescope observations and two botched fly-throughs, that’s all the wonder rated.… I thought maybe this close, I could put together a manned mission. Maybe I would find something there, an edge. Then, when I came back—\" The strange glitter was back in his eyes. He had dreamed his impossible dream so long, it had consumed him. And Sammy realized that The Man was not a fragment of himself. He was simply mad.\n\nBut debts owed to a madman are still real debts.\n\nSammy leaned a little closer. You could have done it. I understand that a starship passed through here when ‘Bidwel Ducanh’ was at the height of his influence.\n\nThat was Qeng Ho. Fuck the Qeng Ho! I have washed my hands of you. His left arm was no longer probing. Apparently, he had found his handgun.\n\nSammy reached out and lightly touched the blankets that hid The Man’s left arm. It wasn’t a forcible restraint, but an acknowledgment … and a request for a moment’s more time. Pham. There’s reason to go to OnOff now. Even by Qeng Ho standards.\n\nHuh? Sammy couldn’t tell if it was the touch, or his words, or the name that had been unspoken for so long—but something briefly held the old man still and listening.\n\nThree years ago, while we were still backing into here, the Trilanders picked up emissions from near the OnOff star. It was spark-gap radio, like a fallen civilization might invent if it had totally lost its technological history. We’ve run out our own antenna arrays, and done our own analysis. The emissions are like manual Morse code, except human hands and human reflexes would never have quite this rhythm.\n\nThe old man’s mouth opened and shut but for a moment no words came. Impossible, he finally said, very faintly.\n\nSammy felt himself smile. It’s strange to hear that word from you, sir.\n\nMore silence. The Man’s head bowed. Then: The jackpot. I missed it by just sixty years. And you, by hunting me down here … now you’ll get it all. His arm was still hidden, but he had slumped forward in his chair, defeated by his inner vision of defeat.\n\nSir, a few of us—more than a few—have searched for you. You made yourself very hard to find, and there are all the old reasons for keeping the search secret. But we never wished you harm. We wanted to find you to— To make amends? To beg forgiveness? Sammy couldn’t say the words, and they weren’t quite true. After all, The Man had been wrong. So speak to the present: We would be honored if you would come with us, to the OnOff star.\n\nNever. I am not Qeng Ho.\n\nSammy always kept close track of his ships’ status. And just now … Well, it was worth a try: I didn’t come to Triland aboard a singleton, sir. I have a fleet.\n\nThe other’s chin came up a fraction. A fleet? The interest was an old reflex, not quite dead.\n\nThey’re in near moorage, but right now they should be visible from Lowcinder. Would you like to see?\n\nThe old man only shrugged, but both his hands were in the open now, resting in his lap.\n\nLet me show you. There was a doorway hacked in the plastic just a few meters away. Sammy got up and moved slowly to push the wheeled chair. The old man made no objection.\n\nOutside, it was cold, probably below freezing. Sunset colors hung above the rooftops ahead of him, but the only evidence of daytime warmth was the icy slush that splashed over his shoes. He pushed the chair along, heading across the parking lot toward a spot that would give them some view toward the west. The old man looked around vaguely. I wonder how long it’s been since he was outside.\n\nYou ever thought, Sammy, there could be other folks come to this tea party?\n\nSir? The two of them were alone in the parking lot.\n\nThere are human colony worlds closer to the OnOff star than we are.\n\nThat tea party. Yes, sir. We’re updating our eavesdropping on them. Three beautiful worlds in a triple star system, and back from barbarism in recent centuries. They call themselves ‘Emergents’ now. We’ve never visited them, sir. Our best guess is they’re some kind of tyranny, high-tech but very closed, very inward-looking.\n\nThe old man grunted. I don’t care how inward-looking the bastards are. This is something that could … wake the dead. Take guns and rockets and nukes, Sammy. Lots and lots of nukes.\n\nYes, sir.\n\nSammy maneuvered the old man’s wheeled chair to the edge of the parking lot. In his huds, he could see his ships climbing slowly up the sky, still hidden from the naked eye by the nearest tenement. Another four hundred seconds sir, and you’ll see them come out past the roof just about there. He pointed at the spot.\n\nThe old man didn’t say anything, but he was looking generally upward. There was conventional air traffic, and the shuttles at the Lowcinder spaceport. The evening was still in bright twilight, but the naked eye could pick out half a dozen satellites. In the west, a tiny red light blinked a pattern that meant it was an icon in Sammy’s huds, not a visible object. It was his marker for the OnOff star. Sammy stared at the point for a moment. Even at night, away from Lowcinder’s light, OnOff would not quite be visible. But with a small telescope it looked like a normal G star … still. In just a few more years, it would be invisible to all but the telescope arrays. When my fleet arrives there, it will have been dark for two centuries … and it will almost be ready for its next rebirth.\n\nSammy dropped to one knee beside the chair, ignoring the soaking chill of the slush. Let me tell you about my ships, sir. And he spoke of tonnages and design specs and owners—well, most of the owners; there were some who should be left for another time, when the old man did not have a gun at hand. And all the while, he watched the other’s face. The old man understood what he was saying, that was clear. His cursing was a low monotone, a new obscenity for each name that Sammy spoke. Except for the last one—\n\nLisolet? That sounds Strentmannian.\n\nYes, sir. My Deputy Fleet Captain is Strentmannian.\n\nAh. He nodded. They … they were good people.\n\nSammy smiled to himself. Pre-Flight should be ten years long for this mission. That would be long enough to bring The Man back physically. It might be long enough to soften his madness. Sammy patted the chair’s frame, near the other’s shoulder. This time, we will not desert you.\n\nHere comes the first of my ships, sir. Sammy pointed again. A second later, a bright star rose past the edge of the tenement’s roof. It swung stately out into twilight, a dazzling evening star. Six seconds passed, and the second ship came into sight. Six seconds more, and the third. And another. And another. And another. And then a gap, and finally one brighter than all the rest. His starships were in low-orbit moorage, four thousand kilometers out. At that distance they were just points of light, tiny gemstones hung half a degree apart on an invisible straight line across the sky. It was no more spectacular than a low-orbit moorage of in-system freighters, or some local construction job … unless you knew how far those points of light had come, and how far they might ultimately voyage. Sammy heard the old man give a soft sigh of wonder. He knew.\n\nThe two watched the seven points of light slide slowly across the sky. Sammy broke the silence. See the bright one, at the end? The pendent gem of the constellation. \"It’s the equal of any starship ever made. It’s my flagship, sir … the Pham Nuwen.\"\n\npart I\n\none hundred sixty years later—\n\none\n\nThe Qeng Ho fleet was first to arrive at the OnOff star. That might not matter. For the last fifty years of their voyage, they had watched the torch-plumes of the Emergent fleet as it decelerated toward the same destination.\n\nThey were strangers, meeting far from either side’s home territory. That was nothing new to the traders of the Qeng Ho—though normally the meetings were not so unwelcome, and there was the possibility of trade. Here, well, there was treasure but it did not belong to either side. It lay frozen, waiting to be looted or exploited or developed, depending on one’s nature. So far from friends, so far from a social context … so far from witnesses. This was a situation where treachery might be rewarded, and both sides knew it. Qeng Ho and Emergents, the two expeditions, had danced around each other for days, probing for intent and firepower. Agreements were drawn and redrawn, plans were made for joint landings. Yet the Traders had learned precious little of true Emergent intent. And so the Emergents’ invitation to dinner was greeted with relief by some and with a silent grinding of teeth by others.\n\nTrixia Bonsol leaned her shoulder against his, cocked her head so that only he could hear: So, Ezr. The food tastes okay. Maybe they’re not trying to poison us.\n\nIt’s bland enough, he murmured back, and tried not to be distracted by her touch. Trixia Bonsol was planet-born, one of the specialist crew. Like most of the Trilanders, she had a streak of overtrustfulness in her makeup; she liked to tease Ezr about his Trader paranoia.\n\nEzr’s gaze flicked across the tables. Fleet Captain Park had brought one hundred to the banquet, but very few armsmen. The Qeng Ho were seated among nearly as many Emergents. He and Trixia were far from the captain’s table. Ezr Vinh, apprentice Trader, and Trixia Bonsol, linguistics postdoc. He assumed the Emergents down here were equally low-ranking. The best Qeng Ho estimate was that the Emergents were strict authoritarians, but Ezr saw no overt marks of rank. Some of the strangers were talkative, and their Nese was easily understandable, scarcely different from the broadcast standard. The pale, heavyset fellow on his left had maintained nonstop chitchat throughout the meal. Ritser Brughel seemed to be a Programmer-at-Arms, though he hadn’t recognized the term when Ezr used it. He was full of the schemes they could use in coming years.\n\nTas been done often enough afore, dontcha know? Get ’em when they don’t know technology—or haven’t yet rebuilt it, said Brughel, concentrating most of his efforts away from Ezr, on old Pham Trinli. Brughel seemed to think that apparent age conferred some special authority, not realizing that any older guy down among the juniors must truly be a loser. Ezr didn’t mind the being ignored; it gave him an opportunity to observe without distraction. Pham Trinli seemed to enjoy the attention. As one Programmer-at-Arms to another, Trinli tried to top everything the pale, blond fellow said, in the process yielding confidences that made Ezr squirm.\n\nOne thing about these Emergents, they were technically competent. They had ramships that traveled fast between the stars; that put them at the top in technical savvy. And this didn’t seem to be decadent knowledge. Their signal and computer abilities were as good as the Qeng Ho’s—and that, Vinh knew, made Captain Park’s security people more nervous than mere Emergent secrecy. The Qeng Ho had culled the golden ages of a hundred civilizations. In other circumstances, the Emergents’ competence would have been cause for honest mercantile glee.\n\nCompetent, and hardworking too. Ezr looked beyond the tables. Not to ogle, but this place was impressive. The living quarters on ramscoop ships were generally laughable. Such ships must have substantial shielding and moderate strength of construction. Even at fractional lightspeed, an interstellar voyage took years, and crew and passengers spent most of that time as corpsicles. Yet the Emergents had thawed many of their people before living space was in place. They had built this habitat and spun it up in less than eight days—even while final orbit corrections were being done. The structure was more than two hundred meters across, a partial ring, and it was all made from materials that had been lugged across twenty light-years.\n\nInside, there was the beginning of opulence. The overall effect was classicist in some low degree, like early Solar habitats before life-support systems were well understood. The Emergents were masters of fabric and ceramics, though Ezr guessed that bio-arts were nonexistent. The drapes and furniture contrived to disguise the curvature in the floor. The ventilator breeze was soundless and just strong enough to give the impression of limitless airy space. There were no windows, not even spin-corrected views. Where the walls were visible, they were covered with intricate manual artwork (oil paintings?). Their bright colors gleamed even in the half-light. He knew Trixia wanted a closer look at those. Even more than language, she claimed that native art showed the inner heart of a culture.\n\nVinh looked back at Trixia, gave her a smile. She would see through it, but maybe it fooled the Emergents. Ezr would have given anything to possess the apparent cordiality of Captain Park, up there at the head table, carrying on such an affable conversation with the Emergents’ Tomas Nau. You’d think the two were old school buddies. Vinh settled back, listening not for sense but for attitude.\n\nNot all the Emergents were smiling, talkative types. The redhead at the front table, just a few places down from Tomas Nau: She’d been introduced, but Vinh couldn’t remember the name. Except for the glint of a silver necklace, the woman was plainly—severely—dressed. She was slender, of indeterminate age. Her red hair might have been a style for the evening, but her unpigmented skin would have been harder to fake. She was exotically beautiful, except for the awkwardness in her bearing, the hard set of her mouth. Her gaze ranged up and down the tables, yet she might as well have been alone. Vinh noticed that their hosts hadn’t placed any guest beside her. Trixia often teased Vinh that he was a great womanizer if only in his head. Well, this weird-looking lady would have figured more in Ezr Vinh’s nightmares than in any happy fantasy.\n\nOver at the front table, Tomas Nau had come to his feet. The servers stepped back from the tables. A hush fell upon the seated Emergents and all but the most self-absorbed Traders.\n\nTime for some toasts to friendship between the stars, Ezr muttered. Bonsol elbowed him, her attention pointedly directed at the front table. He felt her stifle a laugh when the Emergent leader actually began with:\n\nFriends, we are all a long way from home. He swept his arm in a gesture that seemed to take in the spaces beyond the walls of the banquet room. We’ve both made potentially serious mistakes. We knew this star system is bizarre. Imagine a star so drastically variable that it nearly turns itself off for 215 years out of every 250. Over the millennia, astrophysicists of more than one civilization tried to convince their rulers to send an expedition here ways. He stopped, smiled. Of course, till our era, tas expansively far beyond the Human Realm. Yet now it is the simultaneous object of two human expeditions. There were smiles all around, and the thought What wretched luck. Of course, there is a reason that made the coincidence likely. Years aback there was no driving need for such an expedition. Now we all have a reason: The race you call the Spiders. Only the third nonhuman intelligence ever found. And in a planetary system as bleak as this, such life was unlikely to have arisen naturally. The Spiders themselves must be the descendants of starfaring nonhumans—something Humankind had never encountered. It could be the greatest treasure the Qeng Ho had ever found, all the more so because the present Spider civilization had only recently rediscovered radio. They should be as safe and tractable as any fallen human civilization.\n\nNau gave a self-deprecating chuckle and glanced at Captain Park. Till recently, I had not realized how perfectly our strengths and weaknesses, our mistakes and insights, complemented each other. You came from much farther away, but in very fast ships already built. We came from nearer, but took the time to bring much more. We both figured most things correctly. Telescope arrays had watched the OnOff star for as long as Humankind had been in space. It had been known for centuries that an Earth-sized planet with life-signature chemistry orbited the star. If OnOff had been a normal star, the planet might have been quite pleasant, not the frozen snowball it was most of the time. There were no other planetary bodies in the OnOff system, and ancient astronomers had confirmed the moonlessness of the single world in the system. No other terrestrial planets, no gas giants, no asteroids … and no cometary cloud. The space around the OnOff star was swept clean. Such would not be surprising near a catastrophic variable, and certainly the OnOff star might have been explosive in the past—but then how did the one world survive? It was one of the mysteries about the place.\n\nAll that was known, and planned for. Captain Park’s fleet had spent its brief time here in a frantic survey of the system, and in dredging a few kilotonnes of volatiles from the frozen world. In fact, they had found four rocks in the system—asteroids, you might call them, if you were in a generous mood. They were strange things, the largest about two kilometers long. They were solid diamond. The Trilander scientists nearly had fistfights trying to explain that.\n\nBut you can’t eat diamonds, not raw anyway. Without the usual mix of native volatiles and ores, fleet life would be very uncomfortable indeed. The damn Emergents were both late and lucky. Apparently, they had fewer science and academic specialists, slower starships … but lots and lots of hardware.\n\nThe Emergent boss gave a benign smile and continued: There really is only one place in all the OnOff system where volatiles exist in any quantity—and that is on the Spider world itself. He looked back and forth across his audience, his gaze lingering on the visitors. I know it’s something that some of you had hoped to postpone till after the Spiders were active again.… But there are limits to the value of lurking, and my fleet includes heavy lifters. Director Reynolt—aha, that was the redhead’s name!—agrees with your scientists that the locals never did progress beyond their primitive radios. All the ‘Spiders’ are frozen deep underground and will remain so till the OnOff star relights. In about a year. The cause of OnOff’s cycle was a mystery, but the transition from dark to bright repeated with a period that had drifted little in eight thousand years.\n\nNext to him at the front table, S. J. Park was smiling, too, probably with as much sincerity as Tomas Nau. Fleet Captain Park had not been popular with the Triland Forestry Department; that was partly because he cut their pre-Flight time to the bone, even when there had been no evidence of a second fleet. Park had all but fried his ramjets in a delayed deceleration, coming in just ahead of the Emergents. He had a valid claim to first arrival, and precious little else: the diamond rocks, a small cache of volatiles. Until their first landings, they hadn’t even known what the aliens really looked like. Those landings, poking around monuments, stealing a little from garbage dumps had revealed a lot—which now must be bargained away.\n\nIt’s time to begin working together, Nau continued. I don’t know how much you all have heard about our discussions of the last two days. Surely there have been rumors. You’ll have details very soon, but Captain Park, your Trading Committee, and I thought that now is a good occasion to show our united purpose. We are planning a joint landing of considerable size. The main goal will be to raise at least a million tonnes of water and similar quantities of metallic ores. We have heavy lifters that can accomplish this with relative ease. As secondary goals, we’ll leave some unobtrusive sensors and undertake a small amount of cultural sampling. These results and resources will be split equally between our two expeditions. In space, our two groups will use the local rocks to create a cover for our habitats, hopefully within a few light-seconds of the Spiders. Nau glanced again at Captain Park. So some things were still under discussion.\n\nNau raised his glass. So a toast. To an end of mistakes, and to our common undertaking. May there be a greater focus in the future.\n\n\"Hey, my dear, I’m supposed to be the paranoid one, remember? I thought you’d be beating me up for my nasty Trader suspicions.\"\n\nTrixia smiled a little weakly but didn’t answer right away. She’d been unusually quiet all the way back from the Emergent banquet. They were back in her quarters in the Traders’ temp. Here she was normally her most outspoken and delightful self. Their habitat was certainly nice, she finally said.\n\nCompared to our temp it is. Ezr patted the plastic wall. For something made from parts they shipped in, it was a great job. The Qeng Ho temp was scarcely more than a giant, partitioned balloon. The gym and meeting rooms were good-sized, but the place was not exactly elegant. The Traders saved elegance for larger structures they could make with local materials. Trixia had just two connected rooms, a bit over one hundred cubic meters total. The walls were plain, but Trixia had worked hard on the consensus imagery: her parents and sisters, a panorama from some great Triland forest. Much of her desk area was filled with historical flats from Old Earth before the Space Age. There were pictures from the first London and the first Berlin, pictures of horses and aeroplanes and commissars. In fact, those cultures were bland compared with the extremes played out in the histories of later worlds. But in the Dawn Age, everything was being discovered for the first time. There had never been a time of higher dreams or greater naïveté. That time was Ezr’s specialty, to the horror of his parents and the puzzlement of most of his friends. And yet Trixia understood. The Dawn Age was only a hobby for her, maybe, but she loved to talk about the old, old first times. He knew he would never find another like her.\n\nLook, Trixia, what’s got you down? Surely there’s nothing suspicious about the Emergents having nice quarters. Most of the evening you were your usual softheaded self—she didn’t rise to the insult—but then something happened. What did you notice? He pushed off the ceiling to float closer to where she was seated against a wall divan.\n\nIt … it was several little things, and— She reached out to catch his hand. You know I have an ear for languages. Another quick smile. Their dialect of Nese is so close to your broadcast standard that it’s clear they’ve bootstrapped off the Qeng Ho Net.\n\nSure. That all fits with their claims. They’re a young culture, crawling back from a bad fall. Will I end up having to defend them? The Emergent offer had been reasonable, almost generous. It was the sort of thing that made any good Trader a little cautious. But Trixia had seen something else to worry about.\n\nYes, but having a common language makes a lot of things difficult to disguise. I heard a dozen authoritarian turns of speech—and they didn’t seem to be fossil usages. The Emergents are accustomed to owning people, Ezr.\n\nYou mean slaves? This is a high-tech civilization, Trixia. Technical people don’t make good slaves. Without their wholehearted cooperation, things fall apart.\n\nShe squeezed his hand abruptly, not angry, not playful, but intense in a way he’d never seen with her before. Yes, yes. But we don’t know all their kinks. We do know they play rough. I had a whole evening of listening to that reddish blond fellow sitting beside you, and the pair that were on my right. The word ‘trade’ does not come easily to them. Exploitation is the only relationship they can imagine with the Spiders.\n\nHmm. Trixia was like this. Things that slipped past him could make such a difference to her. Sometimes they seemed trivial even after she explained them. But sometimes her explanation was like a bright light revealing things he had never guessed. … I don’t know, Trixia. You know we Qeng Ho can sound pretty, um, arrogant when the customers are out of earshot.\n\nTrixia looked away from him for a second, stared out at strange quaint rooms that had been her family’s home on Triland. Qeng Ho arrogance turned my world upside down, Ezr. Your Captain Park busted open the school system, opened up the Forestry.… And it was just a side effect.\n\nWe didn’t force anyone—\n\nI know. You didn’t force anyone. The Forestry wanted a stake in this mission, and delivering certain products was your price of admission. She was smiling oddly. \"I’m not complaining, Ezr. Without Qeng Ho arrogance I would never have been allowed into the Forestry’s screening program. I wouldn’t have my doctorate, and I wouldn’t be here. You Qeng Ho are gougers, but you are also one of the nicer things that has happened to my world.\"\n\nEzr had been in coldsleep till the last year at Triland. The Customer details weren’t that clear to him, and before tonight Trixia had not been especially talkative about them. Hmm. Only one marriage proposal per Msec; he had promised her no more, but … He opened his mouth to say—\n\nWait, you! I’m not done. The reason for saying all this now is that I have to convince you: There is arrogance and arrogance, and I can tell the difference. The people at that dinner sounded more like tyrants than traders.\n\nWhat about the servers? Did they look like downtrodden serfs?\n\n… No … more like employees. I know that doesn’t fit. But we aren’t seeing all the Emergents’ people. Maybe the victims are elsewhere. But either through confidence or blindness, Tomas Nau left their pain posted all over the walls. She glared at his questioning look. The paintings, damn it!\n\nTrixia had made a slow stroll of leaving the banquet hall, admiring each painting in turn. They were beautiful landscapes, either of groundside locations or very large habitats. Every one was surreal in lighting and geometry, but precise down to the detail of individual threads of grass. Normal, happy people didn’t make those pictures.\n\nEzr shrugged. It looked to me like they were all done by the same person. They’re so good, I’ll bet they’re reproductions of classics, like Deng’s Canberran castlescapes. A manic-depressive contemplating his barren future. Great artists are often crazy and unhappy.\n\nSpoken like a true Trader!\n\nHe put his other hand across hers. Trixia, I’m not trying to argue with you. Until this banquet, I was the untrusting one.\n\nAnd you still are, aren’t you? The question was intense, with no sign of playful intent.\n\nYes, though not as much as Trixia, and not for the same reasons. It’s just a little too reasonable of the Emergents to share half the haul from their heavy lifters. There must have been some hard bargaining behind that. In theory, the academic brainpower that the Qeng Ho had brought was worth as much as a few heavy lifters, but the equation was subtle and difficult to argue. I’m just trying to understand what you saw, and what I missed.… Okay, suppose things are as dangerous as you see them. Don’t you think Captain Park and the Committee are on to that?\n\nSo what do they think now? Watching your fleet officers on the return taxi, I got the feeling people are pretty mellow about the Emergents now.\n\nThey’re just happy we got a deal. I don’t know what the people on the Trading Committee think.\n\n\"You could find out, Ezr. If this banquet has fooled them, you could demand some backbone. I know, I know: You’re an apprentice; there are rules and customs and blah blah blah. But your Family owns this expedition!\"\n\nEzr hunched forward. Just a part of it. This was also the first time she’d ever made anything of the fact. Until now both of them—Ezr, at least—had been afraid of acknowledging that difference in status. They shared the deep-down fear that each might simply be taking advantage of the other. Ezr Vinh’s parents and his two aunts owned about one-third of the expedition: two ramscoops and three landing craft. As a whole, the Vinh.23 Family owned thirty ships scattered across a dozen enterprises. The voyage to Triland had been a side investment, meriting only a token Family member. A century or three down the line he would be back with his family. By then, Ezr Vinh would be ten or fifteen years older. He looked forward to that reunion, to showing his parents that their boy had made good. In the meantime, he was years short of being able to throw his weight around. Trixia, there’s a difference between owning and managing, especially in my case. If my parents were on this expedition, yes, they would have a lot of clout. But they’ve been ‘There and Back Again.’ I am far more an apprentice than an owner. And he had the humiliations to prove it. One thing about a proper Qeng Ho expedition, there wasn’t much nepotism; sometimes just the opposite.\n\nTrixia was silent for a long moment, her eyes searching back and forth across Ezr’s face. What next? Vinh remembered well Aunt Filipa’s grim advice about women who attach themselves to rich young Traders, who draw them in and then think to run their lives—and worse, run the Family’s proper business. Ezr was nineteen, Trixia Bonsol twenty-five. She might think she could simply make demands. Oh Trixia, please no.\n\nFinally she smiled, a gentler, smaller smile than usual. Okay, Ezr. Do what you must … but a favor? Think on what I’ve said. She turned, reaching up to touch his face and gently stroke it. Her kiss was soft, tentative.\n\ntwo\n\nThe Brat was waiting in ambush outside Ezr’s quarters.\n\nHey, Ezr, I watched you last night. That almost stopped him. She’s talking about the banquet. The Trading Committee had piped it back to the fleet.\n\nSure, Qiwi, you saw me on the vid. Now you’re seeing me in person. He opened his door, stepped inside. Somehow the Brat stuck so close behind that now she was inside too. So what are you doing here?\n\nQiwi was a genius at taking questions the way she wanted them: We got the same scut-work shift starting in two thousand seconds. I thought we could go down to the bactry together, trade gossip.\n\nVinh dived into the back room, this time shutting her out. He changed into work fatigues. Of course, the Brat was still waiting when he emerged.\n\nHe sighed. I don’t have any gossip. Damned if I’ll repeat what Trixia said.\n\nQiwi grinned triumphantly. \"Well, I do. C’mon. She opened the room’s outer door and gave him an elegant zerogee bow out into the public corridor. I wanna compare notes with you about what you saw, but really, I bet I got a lot more. The Committee had three povs, including at the entrance—better views than you had.\" She bounced down the hall with him, explaining how often she had reviewed the videos, and telling of all the people she had gossiped with since.\n\nVinh had first met Qiwi Lin Lisolet back in pre-Flight, in Trilander space. She’d been an eight-year-old bundle of raw obnoxiousness. And for some reason she’d chosen him as the target of her attention. After a meal or training session, she’d rush up behind him and slug him in the shoulder—and the angrier he got, the more she seemed to like it. One good punch returned would have changed her whole outlook. But you can’t slug an eight-year-old. She was nine years short of the mandatory crew minimum. The place for children was before voyages and after—not in crews, especially crews bound for desolate space. But Qiwi’s mother owned twenty percent of the expedition.… The Lisolet.17 Family was truly matriarchal, originally from Strentmann, far away across Qeng Ho space. They were strange in both appearance and custom. A lot of rules must have been broken, but little Qiwi had ended up on the crew. She had spent more years of the voyage awake than any but the Watch crew. A large part of her childhood had passed between the stars, with just a few adults around, often not even her own parents. Just thinking of that was enough to cool a lot of Vinh’s irritation. The poor little girl. And not so little anymore. Qiwi must be fourteen years old. And now her physical attacks had been mostly replaced by verbal ones—a good thing considering the Strentmannian high-grav physique.\n\nNow the two were descending through the main axis of the temp. Hey Raji, how’s business? Qiwi waved and grinned at every second passerby. In the Msecs before the Emergents’ arrival, Captain Park had unfrozen almost half of the fleet crew, enough to manage all vehicles and weapons, with hot backups. Fifteen hundred people wouldn’t be more than a large party in his parents’ temp. Here, it was a crowd, even if many were away on shipboard during duty time. With this many people, you really noticed that the quarters were temporary, new partitions being inflated for this crew and that. The main axis was nothing but the meeting corners of four very large balloons. The surfaces rippled occasionally when four or five people had to slip by at once.\n\nI don’t trust the Emergents, Ezr. After all the generous talk, they’ll slit our throats.\n\nVinh gave an irritated grunt. So how come you’re smiling so much?\n\nThey floated past a clear section of fabric—a real window, not wallpaper. Beyond was the temp’s park. It was barely more than a large bonsai, actually, but probably held more open space and living things than were in all the Emergents’ sterile habitat. Qiwi’s head twisted around and for a short moment she was quiet. Living plants and animals were about the only things that could do that to her. Her father was Fleet Life-Support Officer—and a bonsai artist known across all of near Qeng Ho space.\n\nThen she seemed to startle back to the present. Her smile"
