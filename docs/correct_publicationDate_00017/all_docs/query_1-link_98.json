        "text": "A Fire Upon the Deep ending\n\nHal Finney (hal@rain.org)\n\nSun, 25 May 1997 14:26:54 -0700\n\nMessages sorted by: [ date ][ thread ][ subject ][ author ]\n\nNext message: Michael Lorrey: \"HUMOR:I:Dang Viruses!,II:Noah and Gov't\"\n\nPrevious message: my inner geek: \"Re: Extropians Ltd.\"\n\nNext in thread: Anton Sherwood: \"re: A Fire Upon the Deep ending\"\n\nMaybe reply: Anton Sherwood: \"re: A Fire Upon the Deep ending\"\n\nMaybe reply: Michael Lorrey: \"Re: A Fire Upon the Deep ending\"\n\nMaybe reply: Carl Feynman: \"Re: A Fire Upon the Deep ending\"\n\nMaybe reply: Hal Finney: \"Re: A Fire Upon the Deep ending\"\n\nTHIS HAS SPOILERS FOR VERNOR VINGE'S NOVEL \"A FIRE UPON THE DEEP\".\n\nI was pleased to see Max mention a few weeks ago that Vernor Vinge is\n\nworking on a book tentatively titled \"A Deepness in the Sky\". I assume\n\nthis is related to \"A Fire Upon the Deep\", which is one of my favorite\n\nSF novels.\n\nIn re-reading AFUTD though I find that the parts I liked best were the\n\nhigh tech space adventures, the descriptions of future technology,\n\nand the usenet-style galactic newsgroup postings. I didn't really\n\ncare for the parts about the dog packs and their medieval plotting.\n\nSo it will be interesting to see what direction he goes with the new book.\n\nOne thing I didn't like about the ending to AFUTD is that it seemed so\n\ndestructive. Readers will recall that the Countermeasure, activated by\n\nthe \"godshatter\" within Pham Nuwen, has altered the boundaries of the\n\nzones of thought, pushing the Slow Zone up into what used to be the\n\nTranscend. This effectivelly killed the Blight since it could not\n\nlive within such conditions.\n\nHowever, this also will wreak terrible destruction on the other\n\ncivilizations in that part of the galaxy, which have become dependent on\n\nFTL communication and transportation, and possibly other technologies\n\nthat won't work in the Slow Zone. As Vinge has a character say,\n\n\"In some ways the Revenge was a worse thing than the Blight itself.\"\n\nTruly this is burning down the village in order to save it.\n\nWhen I read the book the first time I had the impression that the\n\nextension of the Slow Zone occured throughout the galaxy. Sandor at\n\nthe Zoo, a tough and smart newsgroup poster, had speculated that the\n\nprevious incarnation of the Blight and its subsequent destruction marked\n\nthe beginning of recorded history. This would presumably have been a\n\ngalaxy wide event, otherwise the unaffected regions would no doubt have\n\npassed down some legends about such a dramatic occurance.\n\nActually Vinge leaves the magnitude of the Zone changes somewhat ambiguous.\n\nRavna's instruments indicate that Tines World, at the former bottom of the\n\nBeyond, is now 1,000 to 30,000 ly deep within the Slow Zone. The Beyond\n\nwas about 5,000 ly deep, so this would be consistent with the Slow Zone\n\nextending far into the Transcend.\n\nThe last item in the book is a news posting from the \"Society for\n\nRational Investigation\" saying that they are getting no response from\n\nsites to spinward. Apparently they are right on the edge of the extended\n\nSlow Zone. They are also getting no response from sites in the Transcend\n\nabove the affected region, confirming that the Slow Zone does in fact\n\nextend high enough to engulf the Powers up there.\n\nSo, the Slow Zone extends high, but how wide is the affected region? I did\n\na bit of detective work to get some information. The Society for Rational\n\nInvestigation is mentioned a couple of times earlier, and its location is\n\ngiven. Unfortunately two different numbers are used in my edition. In\n\nchapter 18 it is described as \"Probably a single system in Middle Beyond,\n\n5700 light-years antispinward of Sjandra Kei.\" In chapter 40 the same\n\ndescription is used, except the distance is 7500 ly antispinward. So it\n\nis around 5700-7500 ly antispinward of Sjandra Kei. Sjandra Kei is itself\n\nabout 1500 ly spinward of Tines World, putting SRI about 4000-6000 ly\n\nantispinward of them.\n\nIf we assume that the Zone disturbance is roughly symmetrical around Tines\n\nWorld, then this suggests that the affected region is about 10,000 ly wide,\n\nextending maybe 10,000 ly out, to include all of the inhabited part of the\n\nTranscend above Tines World, and hopefully including all the area which\n\nhad been grabbed by the Blight.\n\nI tried to get some information about how wide the Blight's region was.\n\nA few High Beyond civilizations are described as under its control.\n\nOne way to judge how far these are away is by looking at the language\n\ntranslation paths. They all end up as Triskweline, apparently a widely\n\nused language in that part of the galaxy.\n\nArbitration Arts is the first High Beyond civilization conquered.\n\nTheir messages are translated as Firetongue->Cloudmark->Triskweline.\n\nHowever the first two are High Beyond trade languages apparently capable\n\nof carrying high level protocol packets, something like an advanced\n\nversion of Java applets. The Blight uses these to subvert Arbitration\n\nArts, and after that nobody uses the High Beyond languages any more,\n\nthey stick to the Middle Beyond ones. So basically this civilization is\n\ngoing directly to Triskweline, suggesting it is close by. Similarly,\n\nSandor Arbitration Intelligence at the Zoo is another powerful High\n\nBeyond \"military corporation\" which gets taken over by the Blight.\n\nTheir messages are directly in Triskweline, with no translation, again\n\nsuggesting that they are located roughly \"above\" Tines World.\n\nAll this is consistent with the Blight's range still being relatively\n\nlimited (on the galactic scale) at the time that the Countermeasure\n\nwas activated, so that even though the Zone disturbance was relatively\n\nlocalized, it is reasonable to assume that all of the Blight was in\n\nfact engulfed. That's good. There is so much death and destruction in\n\nthe novel that it would be a real tragedy if it had failed to accomplish\n\nits purpose.\n\nThe remaining puzzle then is why the destruction of the Blight this time\n\nis seemingly less harmful to the galaxy as a whole than the previous\n\nincarnation. Throughout the novel there is no hint that anyone remembers\n\nany earlier instance of the Blight. My guess is that in fact the previous\n\ntime the Blight was activated, its destruction required a far more\n\npowerful defense. Perhaps it spread much faster before a Countermeasure\n\ncould be found and activated. After all, it was a near enough thing\n\nthis time. Yet by Sandor's speculations, the Countermeasure would have\n\nbeen widely distributed throughout the galaxy to be ready if and when\n\nthe Blight is activated again. So even if this particular instance had\n\nbeen destroyed, assuming the Low Beyond remains relatively free from the\n\nBlight's control (perhaps something like Vichy France), someone might\n\neventually stumble on the Countermeasure and find out how to activate it,\n\nor perhaps something the Blight would do would eventually trigger it.\n\nWe might assume that the activation of the Countermeasure in the novel\n\nwas finely tuned by the godshatter so that it would do no more damage\n\nthan was necessary. Since the Blight was being destroyed relatively\n\nearly in its spread, only a limited shift of the Zonal boundaries would\n\nbe enough to eradicate it.\n\nWhat this theory suggests then is that at some point in the past, the\n\nSlow Zone was extended into the Transcend on a nearly galaxy-wide basis\n\nin order to destroy a Blight which had conquered the galaxy, controlled\n\nthe Upper Beyond absolutely, and through agents had a great deal of\n\ncontrol over the rest of the Beyond. The Countermeasure was activated,\n\nthe Zonal boundaries extended, and ever since then they have been receding\n\nuntil they are at the size observed \"today\".\n\nOne problem with this is that the Zones are said to be shrinking at\n\n710 m/s. This is about 2000 ly per billion years. So if the Slow Zone\n\nwas pushed out beyond the Transcend, it would need to shrink more like\n\n10,000 ly to be back to where it is today, requiring 5 billion years.\n\nBut this is much longer than their history seems to go back. Possibly the\n\nsurge is more temporary, shrinking back at a much faster rate initially,\n\nthen slowing down as the Zones approach their \"natural\" states. In that\n\ncase the previous incarnation of the Blight might have happened only a\n\nbillion or two years ago.\n\nHope you enjoy this bit of speculation -\n\nHal"
