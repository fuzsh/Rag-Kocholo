"Vinge has done it again. A Deepness in the Sky is vivid, suspenseful, [and] realistic. Vinge's villains are chillingly believable, and so is his vision of a hopeful tomorrow." --David Brin

"Vernor Vinge's latest novel is a triumph, continuing the most visionary, intelligent deep-space adventure of our time. Reason to cheer, indeed--and a great, long read it is." --Gregory Benford
