There are 65 million NIKKOR lenses in the world. Nikon announced that it reached the 65 million mark at the beginning of October 2011. It hit the 60 million mark in March of this year, just a couple of months after Canon did the same. It’s pretty amazing that the two companies are so close in total lens production given the amount of time they’ve been at it.

The NIKKOR brand

As the brand name for Nikon lenses, NIKKOR has become synonymous with high-performance, high-quality SLR lenses. The NIKKOR name comes from adding “R”—a common practice in the naming of photographic lenses at the time the name was established—to “Nikko”, the Romanized abbreviation for Nippon Kogaku K.K. In 1933, the large-format lens for aerial photography was released with the name Aero-Nikkor.
