        "text": "Nikon AF Zoom Micro 70-180mm f/4.5-5.6D ED (1997)\n\nA zoom lens with macro capabilities at every focal length from 70-180mm, this 1997-released lens was a real ‘two-in-one’ and a very advanced design for the time. With a maximum reproduction ratio of 1:1.32 at 180mm, it was capable of very high-quality close-ups while also retaining the convenience and advantages of a 70-180mm zoom.\n\nNIKKOR P.C 8.5cm f/2 (1948)\n\nLaunched in 1948, this is the lens that began the popularisation of NIKKOR lenses outside Japan. Later, in the 1950s, it was extensively used by press photographers covering global stories, creating images of striking sharpness with beautiful bokeh.\n\nMicro NIKKOR Auto 55mm f/3.5 (1963)\n\nOne of the most successful macro lens designs in NIKKOR’s history and the one that firmly established the Micro NIKKOR name, the Micro NIKKOR Auto 55mm f/3.5 was optically unchanged for nearly 20 years. Based on a lens designed for Nikon’s S series of rangefinder cameras, the F-mount version was a huge success, renowned for the clarity and quality of its images. Macro lenses like this were first developed for copying documents on to microfilm, and pin-sharp detail and clarity at high resolution were needed when imaging the fine brushstrokes of Japanese kanji characters.\n\nAI NIKKOR 400mm f/3.5S ED-IF (1977)\n\nThis is the first NIKKOR lens to feature internal focusing (IF), a game-changing technology for sports and wildlife photographers using long telephoto lenses. Prior to IF, lenses focused by moving all the elements of the lens, meaning the whole lens changed length as you focused. Internal focusing meant the lens barrel stayed the same length while focusing, making handling of such lenses so much easier. The lens also included an ED (Extra-low Dispersion) element that reduced chromatic aberration.\n\nPC NIKKOR 35mm f/3.5 (1962)\n\nAnother world’s first from NIKKOR, this was the first lens for 35mm film cameras to have interchangeable perspective control. The entire assembly could be moved by up to 11mm in 12 different positions, allowing the photographer to correct perspective distortion and converging verticals in the camera. This was especially helpful for architectural photographers in the film era who had to rely on tricky printing skills if they wanted to get rid of perspective distortion in an image.\n\nOP Fisheye NIKKOR 10mm f/5.6 (1968)\n\nIn another world’s first for NIKKOR, this lens saw the introduction of the aspherical front element in an interchangeable lens. The large aspherical element was used to ensure that the light rays entering the lens converged on the same point, reducing spherical aberration and leading to much better image quality. Although the lens was originally designed for scientific use, its distorted fisheye view made it popular in creative and technical photography. These days, many NIKKOR lenses use aspherical elements in their design.\n\nNIKKOR 13mm f/5.6 (1976)\n\nOne of the most collectable and famed of NIKKOR’s historic lenses, the 13mm f/5.6 was a triumph of optical engineering and considered by some the greatest lens ever made by NIKKOR – or anyone else. Designing an ultra-wide lens that created images with no distortion was seen as almost impossible, but this lens proved the doubters wrong and offered a field of view previously only available via fisheye lenses. The complexity of the lens and challenges of manufacturing the large 115mm front element meant it was only available as a special order and as such only around 350 were ever made. Last year an original with box and filters sold for $50,000!\n\nAF DC-NIKKOR 135mm f/2 (1991)\n\nA lens that in its time was described as ‘the king of bokeh’ and ‘arguably the world’s greatest portrait lens’, the AF DC-NIKKOR 135mm f/2 raised the bar for professional portrait photographers across the world and, in many ways, is the direct ancestor of the NIKKOR Z 135mm f/1.8 S Plena. For this lens, NIKKOR introduced ‘Defocus Control’ on a separate dial – another world’s first. This allowed photographers to adjust the amount of spherical aberration for any given aperture, enabling the lens to create superb bokeh either in front or to the rear of the subject. Two years later, NIKKOR introduced a 105mm version that was smaller and lighter.\n\nNIKKOR Z 400mm f/2.8 TC VR S (2022)\n\nSetting a new standard in telephoto lenses for wildlife and sports photographers, the NIKKOR Z 400mm f/2.8 TC VR S incorporates a 1.4x teleconverter that can be turned on and off instantly at the flick of a switch. It also has 5.5 stops of Vibration Reduction built in for rock-solid images. This was the first NIKKOR lens to feature the Meso Amorphous Coat, which gives the highest possible level of anti-reflection. At approximately 2.95kg, it is 20% lighter than the previous F mount version.\n\nAF-S NIKKOR 300mm f/4E PF ED VR (2015)\n\nThe introduction of the Phase Fresnel (PF) element to control chromatic aberration started with this NIKKOR telephoto, creating a lens that was lighter and smaller without compromising on quality. The use of PF elements means fewer elements are needed within the structure of the lens and therefore both size and weight can be reduced, giving photographers lenses that are much more comfortable and easier to handle on long shoots. A hit with wildlife and sports photographers, the lens is still available here.\n\nNIKKOR 8mm f/8 Fisheye (1962)\n\nAnd finally, probably the only genuine movie star lens there has ever been. This was the first 35mm format fisheye lens from NIKKOR, but that’s not its claim to fame. The lens was used by Stanley Kubrick to provide the ‘all-seeing eye’ of HAL 9000, the rogue computer in his 1968 sci-fi classic 2001: A Space Odyssey and has become an icon of cinematic history. The original lens used in the movie was bought at auction by Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson in 2010 for just over €20,000. View it here."
