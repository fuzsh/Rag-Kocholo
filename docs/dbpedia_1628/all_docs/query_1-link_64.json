        "text": "In 1959, Nikon (then Nippon Kogaku K.K.) released the Nikon F as well as its first NIKKOR lens for Nikon SLR cameras, the NIKKOR-S Auto 5cm f/2. The NIKKOR tradition has continued over the many years since that first lens was released. What's more, Nikon continues to expand its lineup of interchangeable lenses for Nikon 1 cameras, the first of which was released in October 2011, and bringing total lens production to eighty million.\n\nAt the beginning of November 2012, total production of NIKKOR lenses for Nikon SLR cameras reached seventy-five million. Since then, Nikon has continued to actively release new NIKKOR lenses.\n\nIn January 2013, Nikon announced the AF-S NIKKOR 800mm f/5.6E FL ED VR, a super-telephoto 800mm lens compatible with the Nikon FX format and offering the longest focal length in the history of NIKKOR autofocus (AF) lenses, and the approximately 385-gram compact and lightweight, approximately 1.9x zoom AF-S NIKKOR 18-35mm f/3.5-4.5G ED ultra wide-angle zoom lens, also compatible with the Nikon FX format. Further, in March of this year, the 5x telephoto-zoom, FX-format compatible AF-S NIKKOR 80-400mm f/4.5-5.6G ED VR, offering one of the fastest AF speeds in its class, was also announced.\n\nIn January 2013, Nikon announced two new lenses for Nikon 1, Advanced Cameras with Interchangeable Lenses—the 1 NIKKOR VR 10-100mm f/4-5.6 10x zoom lens, a single lens that covers focal lengths ranging from wide-angle to telephoto, and the ultra wide-angle zoom 1 NIKKOR VR 6.7-13mm f/3.5-5.6, offering the widest angle of view in the 1 NIKKOR lineup at 100°. In addition, the fastest lens in the 1 NIKKOR lineup, the 1 NIKKOR 32mm f/1.2, a mid-telephoto fixed focal length lens with a maximum aperture of f/1.2, was announced in May of this year. The current lineup of interchangeable lenses for Nikon 1 cameras consists of nine lenses, and Nikon will continue to expand and enrich this lineup."
