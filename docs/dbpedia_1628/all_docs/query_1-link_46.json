        "text": "Melville, NY—Nikon Corporation, the parent company of Nikon Inc., announced that total production of Nikkor lenses for Nikon interchangeable-lens cameras reached 100 million units this summer.\n\nNikkor’s history began in 1932 with Nikon’s (then Nippon Kogaku K.K.) registration of the Nikkor trademark. In 1933, Nikon marketed its first camera lens under the Nikkor brand name—the Aero-Nikkor for aerial photography applications. Then, in 1959, Nikon released the Nikon F SLR camera as well as its first Nikkor lenses for Nikon SLR cameras. These included the Nikkor-S Auto 5cm f/2. Since then, it has been used as the brand name for Nikon’s lenses.\n\nThe name arose from adding “r”—a common practice in the naming of photographic lenses at the time—to “Nikko,” the Romanized abbreviation for Nippon Kogaku K.K.\n\nNikon’s lineup of lenses currently consists of more than 90 types of camera lenses. The lenses include fixed focal length (or prime) lenses covering ultrawide-angle to super-telephoto angles of view, fisheye lenses, zoom lenses and Micro lenses. In addition, PC-E lenses support a variety of applications. Furthermore, Nikon now offers 1 Nikkor compact lenses for its mirrorless Nikon 1 system cameras.\n\nThe company continues to introduce lenses that further optical technology, utilizing techniques and knowledge cultivated over its history. These advancements include Nano Crystal Coat antireflection coating that reduces ghosting and flare. Plus Nikon uses Phase Fresnel (PF) and fluorite elements that have helped create smaller and lighter lenses.\n\nNikon also launched the Nikkor.com global branding site, which spreads the word of its lenses. It provides photo and video galleries containing works recorded with Nikon’s lenses as well as video interviews with lens designers.\n\nThe Nikkor F Mount"
