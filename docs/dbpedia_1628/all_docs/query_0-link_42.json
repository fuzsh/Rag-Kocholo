        "text": "SINGAPORE - Nikon Singapore Pte. Ltd. introduces the NIKKOR Z 600mm f/4 TC VR S, the latest S-Line super-telephoto lens that is a culmination of reliability, mobility, and uncompromised performance. Housed in a well-balanced body, the lens weighs approximately 3,260g and is designed with a built-in teleconverter to provide users with the agility of easily switching between focal lengths and stability even when panning on a monopod or during handheld shooting. Thanks to the combination of the Meso Amorphous Coat and Nano Crystal Coat, this lens excels when shooting in backlit situations.\n\n“Encased in a robust body, the NIKKOR Z 600mm f/4 TC VR S offers unrivalled shooting capabilities. Fitted in a compact body, the lens’ 1.4x built-in teleconverter also covers two focal lengths, which is paramount in providing flexibility in usage and portability in weight for users who also desire the high performance S-Line optics deliver. The exceptional rendering capabilities, versatility, and reliability of the lens is set to excite professionals and creators alike when it comes to expressing and showcasing their captures in ultra-sharp detail,” said Horie Masahiro, Managing Director of Nikon Singapore Pte. Ltd.\n\nThe intelligent, compact design of the NIKKOR Z 600mm f/4 TC VR S enables the housing of two focal lengths: with a simple flick of a switch, users can shift between focal lengths of 600mm and 840mm with the built-in 1.4x teleconverter, or experience a further extension of up to 1176mm using the combination of the built-in teleconverter and Z TELECONVERTER TC-1.4x[1]. Users will find that focusing at long distances or the infinity point is still sharp, crucial when capturing the action from a far distance and struggling with heat haze coming from racing or running tracks.\n\nStay mobile and versatile with the lens weighing only approximately 3,260g – 550g lighter than its F mount equivalent – and measuring a notable 437mm in length to fit into one’s camera backpack in perfect accommodation for travels. Easy to use handheld, this lens enables users to shoot with confidence even if they have to out on the field all day. The lens’ centre of gravity, placed in the middle of the tripod collar, is strategically positioned to be closer to the photographer for excellent body weight distribution and operability. This enables one to attain a shooting experience with the utmost stability when shooting handheld and to achieve an ease of panning when using on a monopod.\n\nGiving users the stability and confidence to capture sharp images in a variety of situations be it in aviation photography or capturing alpine skiing in action, the lens is equipped with Vibration Reduction (VR) of up to a 5.0 stop[2]. With this function, the NIKKOR Z 600mm f/4 TC VR S effectively counters camera shake at its super-telephoto focal distance or during low light conditions where slower shutter speeds are required. Image blurring reduction is amplified further with the 5.5-stop[2] Synchro VR, which is activated when used in conjunction with the Z 9. Users who wish to use the lens for tracking fast and erratic moving subjects while being on wildlife expeditions or motocross racing finals, can further utilise the SPORT mode that equips one with the ability to track subjects easily when doing continuous burst high-speed shooting.\n\nBeyond simply capturing images in excellent resolution, the autofocus (AF) drive motor utilises an optical ABS (absolute) encoder – that functions as a super-accurate ruler and precisely detects and measure the amounts of positioning change of the focus lens groups at approximately 20 times precision. Coupled with the Silky Swift Voice Coil Motor (SSVCM)[3] to drive speed and accuracy while simultaneously operating at near-silence, the lens responses quickly in decisive moments with faster reaction times.\n\nVideo recordings also benefit from the Silky Swift VCM’s AF drive technology to ensure a quiet operation during moments where silence is imperative. Enjoy effective focus-breathing compensation, and stable exposure from a smooth aperture control with a lens that is designed with consideration for video shoots as well.\n\nUsers can shoot with peace of mind with the NIKKOR Z 600mm f/4 TC VR S. With sealing on various moving sections of the lens barrel including the rubber gasket on the lens mount, dust and liquid[5] are prevented from entering the lens. Furthermore, the highly robust magnesium alloy used on the lens barrel improves the durability of the lens during unexpected outdoor weather conditions.\n\nFor an uncomplicated maintenance and care, fluorine coat is also applied to the front-most surface of the lens – preventing contaminants from sticking onto the lens and enabling easy cleaning. Rounding up the worry-free shooting experience is the lens’ very own security slot that is compatible with security wires widely available in the market.\n\nThe NIKKOR Z 600mm f/4 TC VR S’s finishing is one of class and elegance with a metal plate for its model name, and the familiar well-loved Nikon yellow ring and S metal emblems to complete its polished sophistication as the latest addition to the ever-expanding NIKKOR Z range."
