        "text": "The time during which the 'K' Nikkors were made was one of transition. The AI system was undoubtedly already on the drawing boards. The 'K' lenses and the AI lenses are cosmetically similar so some 'K' lenses which were upgraded to AI with new factory aperture rings are mistaken for original AI lenses. The 35/2.8 'K' Nikkor is a big improvement over the previous Nikkor S. The six element design of the 'K' was carried over to the first AI version. The second 35/2.8 AI has five elements and does not appear to me to be as good. There were two 'K' versions of the 50/1.4 Nikkor. The first version is similar in design to the earlier 50/1.4 Nikkor SC but had different looking coating. The second version looks like the first AI and uses a slightly changed optical design. The first version is thought to be somewhat sharper at f/8 - f/11 while the second version is considered sharper at or near wide open. I like the look of the first version myself. The 50/2 'K' Nikkor uses the same optical formula as the earlier 50/2 HC but seems to have better lubrication. Most of the HC models I have seen have dried up lubrication in the focusing helicoid. The 200/4 'K' Nikkor uses the changed formula and compact size of the later AI model. I actually prefer the earlier 200/4 QC but if I want to carry something smaller I will use the 'K' or the AI. Did the rubber covering on the focusing rings of the 'K' lenses cost less than the earlier metal material? Perhaps it did but it's the glass that makes the image, not the focusing ring cover. There were some lenses which already had the rubber covered focusing ring (sometimes called RIFR or Rubber Inset Focusing Ring) even before the 'K' models. I have a 180/2.8 Nikkor P and a number of 55/3.5 Nikkor P and C lenses with rubber covered focusing rings. They all work well.\n\nWelcome to Apug !\n\nWell I may be even more ignorant on those Nikon designation than you. I am a Canon guy so to say.\n\nBasically there were 2 major changes at SLR lenses before autofocus came:\n\n1.) the introduction of the automatic diaphragm\n\nThus enabling to compose and focus at full aperture and the aperture only closing at the moment of release.\n\nThere were various suyten, euther onky closing but but not opening the diaphragm, or having to cock in advance the diaphragm, All enuÂ´ding at lnses where th diaphragm closes at relaesing to the preset vaue and automatically fully opening again thereafter.\n\n2.) the introduction of open-aperture through-the-lens metering.\n\nThe latter was not new, but one always had to stop down the lens for metering. Then lenses got the feature to tell the camera what their largest opening is (lens speed) and what aperture one has preset, or is just testing for metering. All with full aperture.\n\nWhereas other manufacturers did this change in one step. Nikon did it in at least 2 steps. The first being the use of these prongs.\n\nEDIT: My last comment is seemingly wrong and those prongs were already used much earlier for meter-coupling in times of non-TTL metering\n\nThe time during which the 'K' Nikkors were made was one of transition. The AI system was undoubtedly already on the drawing boards. The 'K' lenses and the AI lenses are cosmetically similar so some 'K' lenses which were upgraded to AI with new factory aperture rings are mistaken for original AI lenses. The 35/2.8 'K' Nikkor is a big improvement over the previous Nikkor S. The six element design of the 'K' was carried over to the first AI version.

I have a 180/2.8 Nikkor P and a number of 55/3.5 Nikkor P and C lenses with rubber covered focusing rings. They all work well.\n\nAlso, the 50/2 K has a minimum focusing distance of 0.45m, as opposed to 0.6m on the 50/2 HC. I have a 50/2 K (AI converted) and it's great. The HC does look a lot nicer though.\n\nHi ! I'm trying to understand my 105mm 2.5 lens. I use it with a Nikkormat FT2. I thought that it was a non AI lens but it seems not, the serial number refers to a K series (according photosynthesis board).\n\nCan I use it as manual lens on a D*** camera ?? I'm not familiar yet with all the Nikon vocabulary (E, K, AI,AI-S.... blablabla)\n\nPS : I'm not used to post on forums, forgive me if I break any rules\n\nMany Nikon lenses began life as \"non-AI\" lenses and were upgraded to \"AI-converted\" lenses by exchanging the aperture ring. So one cannot tell what the lens fits just by looking at the serial number. You have to look at the aperture ring and whether it has little projections / tabs on the rear or not. Because there are so many generations of lenses and cameras (both film and digital), partial and full compatibility is pretty complicated. The best table for looking up this info is Ken Rockwell's at https://www.kenrockwell.com/nikon/compatibility-lens.htm There are examples on that page of what the aperture rings look like."
