At the same time, Nikon also released its first NIKKOR interchangeable lenses for Nikon SLR cameras, among them the NIKKOR-S Auto 5cm f/2. In the half century since, NIKKOR lenses have become the favorite lenses of a wide variety of users, and have been extremely well received by a great number of photo enthusiasts and professional photographers.\n\nIn August 2010, total production of NIKKOR lenses reached 55 million. Since then, Nikon has continued to expand the product lineup by releasing six new NIKKOR lenses for FX- and DX-format SLR cameras. As a result, the fact that NIKKOR continues to satisfy a wide variety of photographers is evidenced by production of an additional five million lenses in less than one year, bringing total production to 60 million.\n\nThe Nikkor Brand."
