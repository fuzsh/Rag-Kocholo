        "text": "MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA – Nikon Middle East FZE. introduces the NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4, a portable wide-angle prime lens with a fast aperture that enables users to enjoy the large bokeh expression with ease.\n\nThe well-balanced Z mount, full-frame, and FX-compatible lens offers superior optical performance at an affordable price point. Its smaller, lighter body, at approximately 415 g, makes it perfect for everyday users who wish to expand their range of expression in capturing landscapes, pets, flowers, and portraits while on the go.\n\nThe NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 adds to Nikon’s lens list and expands the range of creative expressions. Offering a maximum aperture of f/1.4, it takes advantage of the shallow depth of field to create a large bokeh, giving subjects a soft, ethereal expression and enabling them to stand out, achieving a three-dimensional rendering.\n\nThe lens's ability to capture abundant light also makes it reliable for shooting in low light or indoor environments, with faster shutter speeds helping to reduce blurring. With the appropriate exposure easily obtained at low ISO sensitivity, the lens helps users capture cleaner images by reducing noise.\n\nThis latest 35mm wide-angle lens from Nikon captures scenes as the human eye sees them, allowing users to capture versatile scenes from various angles to create a sense of depth for striking photos. The minimum focus distance of 0.27 m and the maximum aperture further emphasise the main subject, creating a pronounced background blur.\n\nThe NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 also provides exceptional rendering unique to Z lenses. The rendering is customisable, allowing users to match it to their creative intentions.\n\nAt maximum aperture, subjects impressively stand out with soft rendering and shallow depth of field, allowing a soft, large bokeh that brings them to life in a vivid and lively three-dimensional manner that is perfect for pets and portraiture. Meanwhile, closing down the aperture allows users to enhance detail capture for sharp, high-resolution rendering suitable for landscape photography.\n\nThis lens achieves top-class optical performance among Z lenses, eliminating chromatic and coma aberrations and surpassing other lenses in the same category1.\n\nThe angle of view remains constant when adjusting the focus to suppress focus breathing2 to provide a natural-looking image. Furthermore, the lens adopts a stepping motor (STM), enabling fast and quiet auto-focus operation, making operating sounds less likely to be recorded in quiet environments.\n\nThe light lens reduces shifting the centre of gravity when focusing, making it suitable for gimbal-mounted shooting. The NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 also allows linear operation during manual focus, enabling precise focusing as desired.\n\nThe NIKKOR Z 35mm f/1.4 is designed with a sense of luxury and functional superiority in mind. It is the first non-S-Line lens to adopt a metal filter ring cover. The focus and control rings have differing knurling shapes, which are easily distinguishable even while looking through the viewfinder.\n\nDesigned to widen gradually from base to tip, the lens ensures stable camera holding during shooting. The lens is also designed to consider dust and drip resistance3; various parts, including movable parts of the lens barrel, are sealed to prevent dust and water droplets from entering the lens."
