        "text": "That New E AF-P ED-IF VR PC DC PF DX FL Nikkor is a What?\n\nWhile Nikon stuck with the F-mount for almost 60 years, they've made plenty of additions and tweaks during that time, and it seems that every time they do, there's a new acronym to learn. First, a little history, then the translation dictionary.\n\nPre-AI: The original F-mount appeared in 1959, and lenses that were produced from then until about 1979 are usually referred to as Pre-AI. These lenses are dangerous on most current Nikon bodies. With the exception of a modified F5, modified F6, or stock Df, D40, D40x, D60, D3xxx, or D5xxx, mounting one of these lenses on your recent Nikon SLR/DSLR will result in damage, so don't even try it. If you find that you have one of these lenses and want to use it on a current camera, you must have the lens converted to AI first. Nikon used to do this, but now it's done by a number of independent companies.\n\nAI: In 1977 Nikon added a feature called Aperture Indexing (AI). By about 1979, most Nikkor lenses were being produced with AI. Any AI or later lens will mount on all recent and current Nikon bodies. Many bodies, however, will not meter with such lenses, as they don't have the mechanical indexing parts to get maximum aperture information from the lens. Exceptions are the F100, F5, D1 series, D2 series, D3 series, D4 series, D5, D300 series, D500, D6xx, D7xx, and D8xx series, some of which have slightly different metering compatibilities with these lenses (see chart, below).\n\nOld E, AI-S, AI-P: Nikon kept adding new variants of AI: Old E in 1979, AI-S in 1982, and AI-P in 1988. They are essentially the same to a current camera body as AI lenses, with the exception of AI-P, as it is has a CPU built into it (see next paragraph). You can add a chip to any AI or AI-S lens to effectively make it an AI-P lens, though this is not a simple operation.\n\nD, G, AF-I, AF-S:Â The first autofocus lenses appeared in 1986. These have a \"CPU\" built into the lens, but this originally was just a fancy way of saying it had an electronic transfer of basic lens information to the camera. Since then, we've had several variations of autofocus lenses and more sophisticated in-lens electronics: D-type (1992) adds distance information to the data supplied by the lens to the camera, AF-I, AF-S add in-lens focusing motors, and G-type removes the aperture ring (but is otherwise identical to D-type). The main things to watch for are non-D versus D or G. This is found by looking at the aperture designation on the barrel, which would be something like f/2.8, f/2.8D, or f/2.8G for plain autofocus, D-type, and G-type respectively. In this group, only D and G lenses will transfer focus distance information to the camera body, and thatâs useful for flash metering, amongst other things.\n\nNew E: Yep, Nikon recycled the E, this time to mean âelectronic activation of the aperture.â This first appeared on the PC-E lenses in 2008 and support was designed into all 2007 and later cameras starting with the D3/D300. Why? Because a mechanical linkage to the aperture from the camera body is too complex when a lens is shifted and tilted. Now, however, Nikon has made clear that theyâre building E lenses for good: the 400mm, 500mm, 600mm, 800mm exotics are E, the 300mm f/4 revision is E, the 16-80mm f/2.8-4 DX lens is E, and more E lenses keep coming. This is not without serious legacy implication, however. E lenses will be essentially âmaximum-aperture-only lensesâ on many cameras made prior to the switch in 2007. This includes the F6, D1 series, D2 series, D40, D40x, D50, D60, D70, D70s, D80, D90, D100, D200, and D3000 bodies. Nikon erroneously labels these cameras as âincompatibleâ with E lenses, when it really is âlosses functionality.â Also, note that cameras that recognize them but whose firmware was designed prior to E lenses appearing (D3, D300, D700 and a few others) will list the lens as âGâ in the EXIF data, not E, at least until you update the firmware (if an update is available). This has consequences in some cases of the wrong lens profile being applied by software (e.g. the 24-70mm f/2.8G instead of the 24-70mm f/2.8E). Note that some third-party makers (Sigma and Tamron) now make E-equivalent lenses that have the same restrictions as Nikon E-type.\n\nAF-P: This isn't really an overall lens type as the above ones are, but it functions as one since support for it is limited to only recent bodies. The first AF-P lenses appeared in 2016, and were DX lenses. These lenses will not autofocus on any 35mm film body, D1, D2, D3 series, D4 series, D70 series, D40 series, D50, D60, D80, D90, D100, D200, D300 series, D6xx series, D700, D800 or D800E, D3000, D3100, D3200, D5000, D5100, or D7000. Fully compatible bodies are only the Df, D5, D6, D500, D750, D780, D810, D850, D3300, D3400, D3500, D5300, D5500, D5600, D7100, D7200, D7500.Â The D3300, D5300, and D5500 require upgraded firmware to use the lens.Â The D7200 can use the lens but has no way to turn VR on or off. I have a separate article that keeps up-to-date AF-P compatibility information.\n\nZ: Not a DSLR lens format. The Z mount was Nikon's re-imagining of what a lens mount should be like for mirrorless cameras, both present and future.Â\n\nNikon also made lenses with the type of IX. These lenses were designed for the Pronea series of cameras, which used Advanced Photo System format film. They cannot be used on 35mm film or digital bodies, so just ignore them unless you have a Nikon Pronea camera.\n\nIn terms of functionality, we're ready to get more specific now (I'm just going to cover bodies from the FM2n/F4 era onwards here):\n\nDf, D40, D40x, D60, D3000, D3100, D3200, D3300, D3400, D3500, D5000, D5100, D5200, D5300, D5500, D5600\n\nPre-AI: mounts, no meter except Df\n\nAI, AI-S, old E: mounts, no meter except Df\n\nAI-P, older AF: mounts and meters, no autofocus except Df\n\nD, G: Â mounts and meters, no autofocus unless AF-S, AF-I, HSM (Sigma), or NII (Tamron);

many bodies require current firmware, and there may be one small function issue (see the AF-P article).\n\nD50, D70, D70s, D80, D90, D100, Pro 14n\n\nPre-AI: DO NOT USE, may cause damage\n\nAI, AI-S, old E: mounts, no meter\n\nAI-P, older AF: mounts and meters, no focus restrictions\n\nD, G: mounts, 3D metering, advanced flash metering, no focus restrictions\n\nNew E: mounts, maximum aperture only, no controlling aperture\n\nAF-P: does not autofocus or control VR\n\nD200, S5 Pro, D300, D300s, D500, D600, D610, D700, D750, D780, D800, D800E, D810, D850, D7000, D7100, D7200, D7500\n\nPre-AI: DO NOT USE may cause damage (except for D7500)\n\nAI, AI-S, old E: mounts and meters (must set maximum aperture in menus) except for D7500\n\nAI-P, older AF: mounts and meters, no focus restrictions\n\nD, G: mounts, 3D metering, advanced flash metering, no focus restrictions\n\nNew E: mounts;

trying to use any other type of lens compromises something in the metering or flash system slightly. On a few cameras (D40, D40x, D60, D3000, D3100, D3200, D3300, D3500, D5000, D5100, D5200, D5500, and D5600) only AF-S (or AF-I, HSM, NII, and AF-P if supported) lenses give full compatibility, including focusing. On Z series cameras using the FTZ adapter, the same is true (only AF-S, AF-P, AF-I, HSM, NII lenses will autofocus).\n\nNext, even Nikon lens hoods have meaningful acronyms. The letters in the name of the hood specifies something about the hood itself:\n\nHB:Â Bayonet mount hood\n\nHE:Â Extension hood for long lenses that already have a hood\n\nHK:Â Slips onto the lens and then locks using a knob\n\nHN:Â Screw mount hood\n\nHR:Â Rubber hood, usually screw mount\n\nHS:Â Snaps onto lens like a lens cap\n\nBut Nikon's acronyms and abbreviations don't stop with overall lens type or lens hood; plenty of other sub-categorizations exist. So check out the information below to find out what the acronym you're looking at means. If you encounter a term I haven't defined, let me know so I can add it to the list.\n\nNote: with pre-AI lenses Nikon often used a single letter abbreviation to indicate the number of elements in the lens: U (uni) =1, B (bi) =2, T (tri) = 3, Q (quadra) = 4, P (penta)-5, H (hexa) = 6, S (septa) =7, O (octa) = 8, N (nona) = 9, and D (deca) = 10). Usually these letters were appended to Nikkor, as in Nikkor-Q 135/2.8, which would be a pre-AI 135mm f/2.8 lens with four elements (Q). Keep that in mind when deciphering the alphabet soup Nikon has used over the years. If you're dealing with a really old lens, a single letter alongside the Nikkor is likely to refer to elements, not the terms shown below.\n\nA â The original bayonet lens type (1959). Manual focus lens. Considered Pre-AI\n\nADR â Aperture Direct Readout. A fancy way of saying that aperture scale can be seen directly by the cameras that have overhanging prisms (ala F4, F5). Started with AI lenses in 1977.\n\nAF-I â An autofocus lens with an Integrated, coreless focus motor (1992). All AF-I lenses are D-type, but some older film bodies can't autofocus with them (N60, N8008).\n\nAF-P â An autofocus lens with special stepper motors (2015); requires a very recent body and current firmwareÂ (see theÂ AF-P article).\n\nAF-S â An autofocus lens with a Silent wave, integrated, coreless focus motor (1996). Basically an update to AF-I. Some older bodies can't autofocus with them (N60, N8008). Some newer bodies (D40, D40x) can only autofocus with them.\n\nAI â Aperture Indexing (1977). Manual focus lens.\n\nAI-P â An AI lens variant (1988) that was \"chipped\" to send data to the camera.\n\nAI-S â A variant of AI designed to be used with Program and Shutter-priority exposure modes (1982). Manual focus lens. Distinguished by smallest aperture being printed in orange and a small scoop on the bayonet flange, which transmits aperture info. Otherwise same as AI.\n\nARNEO â An Anti Reflective Nano (ARN) element coating that reduces ghosting and flare effects of light entering the lens tele centrically.\n\nASP â Lens has aspherical elements in its optic design. Aspherical lenses eliminate coma and other types of lens aberrations by using complex curves in the design of lens elements.\n\nC â A lens coating type (Nikon Integrated Coating) for Pre-AI lenses. Distinguished by a C after the lens designation and a black filter ring.\n\nCRC â Close Range Correction, means that the lens was designed to provide superior focusing at close distances and with flat fields.\n\nCX â (2011) Nikon 1 mirrorless camera lens.\n\nD â (1992) Adds distance information to the data transmitted to the camera via chip. Distinguished by the D or G after the lens designation.\n\nDC â Defocus Control lens, allows the photographer to change the degree of spherical aberration in the out-of-focus areas to provide for better bokeh.\n\nDX -- (2003) Indicates a lens designed to cover the smaller image circle of the digital camera bodies. May still work on 35mm bodies at some focal lengths.\n\nold E â A special type of AI lens (1977) introduced with the consumer-oriented EM body. Says Nikon Series E on the lens. Light in weight, plastic in construction, but optically good.\n\nnew E â Electronic aperture activation. The lens does not have a physical connection to the aperture activation arm in the camera and instead uses electrical signals between camera and lens to control aperture (see notes on body compatibility, above)\n\nED â Extra-low Dispersion element(s) used in the lens.\n\nFLÂ (also FLC) â Flourite element(s) used in the lens. Flourite elements are lightweight compared to regular glass.\n\nFX â (2007) 35mm full frame digital sensor. While Nikon doesn't explicitly use this acronym yet with lenses, it has used it casually to refer to lenses that cover the full 35mm film (and FX digital sensor) frame, as opposed to lenses that cover smaller imaging sizes, such as DX or IX.\n\nG â Removes the aperture ring from a D-type lens. Thus needs to be used on camera with Command dial control of apertures. With some older cameras (N90s, for example), can be used in Program or Shutter-priority exposure mode, though.\n\nHRI â High Refractive Index. First appeared on the 55-300mm lens.\n\nIF â Lens uses internal focusing rather than moving or turning outer elements.\n\nIX â Lenses for the Pronea system (Advanced Photo System). Can't be used on the 35mm or digital bodies.\n\nK â Another Pre-AI lens type, this time with rubber focus rings.\n\nMC â (2021) A new designator for macro lenses, generally ones that achieve 1:1 magnification ratios.\n\nN â Originally, the actual designation used for the first AI lenses; beginning in 2005 it now stands for Nano Crystal Coat, a special type of flare reduction coating applied to newer lenses.\n\nN (gold emblem) â Nano coating. A crystalline coating that eliminates internal lens element reflections, reducing ghosting and flare.\n\nNIC â Nikon Integrated Coating. A fancy way of referring to Nikon's glass coating system, which is used to help reduce flare and ghosting.\n\nPC â Perspective Control lens, allows the front of the lens to be shifted relative to the rest of the lens to correct for perspective. All PC lenses are either AI or AI-P in type.\n\nPF â Phase Fresnel, a type of diffraction optic that makes for smaller, lighter lenses.\n\nRF â Rear Focusing, means that lens achieves focusing by moving the rear elements; similar to IF.\n\nS-line â (2018) Z system lens for mirrorless cameras; so-called \"superior\" lens.\n\nSIC â Super Integrated Coating, a multi-layer flare reduction coating, usually applied to the more complex zoom lenses.\n\nSWM â Silent Wave Motor. This is the motor in the lens used in AF-I and AF-S lenses.\n\nSTM â Stepping Motor. This is a near silent type of motor that focuses via a gear-based mechanism.\n\nSR â (2020) Short-wavelength Refractive. This is a lens element that refracts UV and near UV wavelengths, which reduces chromatic aberration.\n\nTC â (2021) Lens has a built in teleconverter that can be switched in.\n\nUW â Underwater lenses, destined for the Nikonos systems.\n\nVCM â Voice coil motor. A type of motor that uses magnets instead of gears to move lens elements.\n\nVR â Vibration Reduction lens, corrects for camera movement during exposure. VR function only works on post F5 cameras (e.g., not F4, N90s, N60, N70, N8008). Lately, Nikon has been using a VRII designation to indicate some advances to the vibration reduction system.Â\n\nZ â (2018) Z system lens for mirrorless cameras"
