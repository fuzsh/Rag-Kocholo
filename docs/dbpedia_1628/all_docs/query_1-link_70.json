        "text": "kukkurovaca says:\n\nThe\n\nSLR criterion seems reasonable to me.\n\nTechnically I think we'd have to call it an F-Mount criterion; after all, the Nikkors made for the Bronica system were SLR lenses, too. And there are 35mm Nikon lenses not represented, as well. (Rangefinder, Nikonos)\n\nThe limit doesn't bug me, although I would love to have an easily accessible pool of tagged medium and large format Nikkor lenses. However, I don't have any plans to buy a Bronica or go large format, so this would strictly be an intellectual curiosity thing for me.\n\nMaybe if someone offered to generate a list of logical tags for non-F lenses, it would make it easier for the admins to incorporate those?\n\nages ago\n\nradiorabbi says:\n\n\"I am not being rude\"\n\n\"Sounds like laziness to me \"\n\nThat was uncalled for and Rude\n\nFortunately for you I am not one of the Admins on this Group or you would be Moderated or Banned.\n\nsetting up and Moderating a group is a thankless task which individuals like you seem to take for granted\n\nIf the Admins don't want to expand the Parameters of the group to satisfy a couple of posters that is their perogative.\n\na single thread in 3 or 4 years on this subject does not sound like the kind of thing that will be in Demand. As such i would not expect things to change\n\nAssuming the parameters were expanded it is likely you would find the accute lack of related posts to be frustrating.\n\nyou would be much better off starting a parallel group\n\nfor Non F mount Nikkors or something similar.\n\nGood Shooting group\n\nMike\n\nages ago\n\nkukkurovaca says:\n\nWell, not that the grammatical issues are really relevant to the topic, but since we're in it now:\n\nit could be read either way----\n\nIt can only be read either way if \"the photograph must be taken with an interchangeable Nikkor lens on a film\" could be a valid sentence in itself. Otherwise, \"film\" has to be read together with \"SLR\".\n\nNow, as to whether \"must be taken...on a film\" is valid, there may be some regional/dialectical variation. I would refer to shooting film generally as shooting \"on film,\" not \"on a film,\" unless the point was to specify some particular film, like, \"on a film like Astia,\" or something to that effect, which is clearly not the case here. I would never use \"a film\" generically in place of \"film,\" and I would be surprised to find a native English speaker who did, but it's not impossible that some may.\n\nThe other way to interpret it consistently would be to take \"a film\" in place of \"a film camera,\" which seems similarly unlikely.\n\nages ago\n\n(mjh) says:\n\nafter all, the Nikkors made for the Bronica system were SLR lenses, too\n\nAnd if you really wanted to get pedantic, the Nikkor large-format lenses can be attached to anything, including the handful of LF SLRs out there...\n\nAs kukkurovaka mentioned, this is really a \"Nikkor F\" group right now. What would it take to get other great Nikkor lenses in? A comprehensive list, separate from the F-mount Nikkors?\n\nHere's my contribution for LF and MF lenses, taken from the Wikipedia list:\n\nLarge Format:\n\n65mm f/4 Nikkor-SW\n\n75mm f/4.5 Nikkor-SW\n\n90mm f/4.5 Nikkor-SW\n\n90mm f/8 Nikkor-SW\n\n120mm f/8 Nikkor-SW\n\n150mm f/8 Nikkor-SW\n\n100mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n105mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n135mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n150mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n180mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n210mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n240mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n300mm f/5.6 Nikkor-W\n\n360mm f/6.5 Nikkor-W\n\n105mm f/3.5 Nikkor-M\n\n200mm f/8 Nikkor-M\n\n300mm f/9 Nikkor-M\n\n450mm f/9 Nikkor-M\n\n120mm f/5.6 Nikkor-AM ED\n\n210mm f/5.6 Nikkor-AM ED\n\n270mm f/6.3 Nikkor-T ED\n\n360mm f/8 Nikkor-T ED\n\n500mm f/11 Nikkor-T ED\n\n600mm f/9 Nikkor-T ED\n\n720mm f/16 Nikkor-T ED\n\n800mm f/12 Nikkor-T ED\n\n1200mm f/18 Nikkor-T ED\n\nfor classic Bronica SLRs:\n\n40mm f/4 Nikkor-D\n\n50mm f/3.5 Nikkor-H\n\n50mm f/2.8 Nikkor-O\n\n75mm f/2.8 Nikkor-P\n\n75mm f/2.8 Nikkor-HC\n\n105mm f/3.5 LS Nikkor-Q\n\n135mm f/3.5 Nikkor-Q\n\n200mm f/4 Nikkor-P\n\n300mm f/5.6 Nikkor-PC\n\n400mm f/4.5 Nikkor-Q\n\n600mm f/5.6 Nikkor-P\n\n800mm f/8 Nikkor-P\n\n1200mm f/11 Nikkor-P\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\n(mjh) edited this topic ages ago.\n\nMJM67 says:\n\nMy input to this thread was strictly about trying to make it a true Nikkor group. My statement about the Admins being lazy, because they did not want to add other types of Nikkor was my opinion and stand by it. I feel it would be very little work involved in making this a true Nikkor group and a image resource for all current and/or prospective Nikkor users. They chose the name Nikkor--which to me should represents the whole Nikkor line. What is hilarious to me is the immaturity that some showed when they went off the deep end about the term \"laziness\". If Disney Mike has a problem with it, he is very welcome to contact me and we can discuss it like mature adults. As I also have said I am more than willing to help Disney Mike sort through and get a list of the other Nikkor lenses.\n\nages ago\n\ndisneymike says:\n\nWith your help, I have found there are good references for non F-mount Nikkor lenses on Wikipedia.\n\nIn light of that find, I will consider adding other Nikkor lenses to the official Nikkor Tag List. However, if I decide to add them, I think a reorganization of the lens list is in order.\n\nPlease keep in mind I admin this group because I love Nikkor lenses, but I do have a full-time job and am a part-time professional photographer as well. Also, I have a 3 hour commute 5 days a week. So, as you can imagine, I have only so much time to devote to this group.\n\nI thank everyone who contributes to the Nikkor group because it wouldn't be the resource it is today without its members.\n\nOriginally posted ages ago.\n\ndisneymike (a group admin) edited this topic ages ago."
