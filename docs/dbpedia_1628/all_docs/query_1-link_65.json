        "text": "Home Camera Articles FOR SALE Orders I Buy / Wants Repairs Books Adapters\n\nNikkor Cameras: Rare Nikons for the German Market\n\nDue to a lawsuit alleging trademark violations of the name \"Zeiss-Ikon,\" Nikon cameras were not imported into Germany during the early and mid 1960's. Nippon Kagaku's temporary solution was to turn Nikon cameras into \"Nikkor\" cameras. This new naming extended even to small accessories and instructions books. A number of variations have been brought to my attention by Uli Koch.\n\n\"NIKKOR\" F Bodies (Black and Chrome) with Nippon Kogaku top plate.\n\n\"NIKKOR\" F Bodies Red Dot (Black and Chrome) with Nippon Kogaku top plate.\n\n\"Nikkor\" F Bodies (Black and Chrome) with \"Nikkor\" top plate\n\n\"NIKKOR J\" camera -- a renamed Nikkorex F. This is a very rare camera, and the first time I have heard of it. This camera is shown on the top right of the camera group.\n\n\"Nikkor\" Photomic versions have been noted in the original Photomic (switch), Photomic T, Photomic TN and early Photomic FTN.\n\nA group of very rare \"Nikkors,\" including three \"Nikkor\" F's with prism finder, six \"Nikkor\" Photomics, and one \"NIKKOR\" F and \"NIKKOR J\"( aka Nikkorex F).\n\nLiterature on the \"Nikkor F\" System, in German.\n\nThe NIKKOR F variation in all capital letters.\n\n\"Nikon\" was not allowed, even on the smaller accessories!\n\nPhotos and information courtesy of my friend and fellow Nikon Historical Society member, Uli Koch.\n\nHome Camera Articles FOR SALE Orders I Buy / Wants Repairs Books Adapters"
