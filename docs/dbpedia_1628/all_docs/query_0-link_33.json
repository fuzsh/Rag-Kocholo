        "text": "Nikkor\n\nNikkor is the brand of lenses produced by Nikon Corporation, including camera lenses for the Nikon F-mount. The Nikkor brand was introduced in 1932, a Westernised rendering of an earlier version Nikkō (日光), an abbreviation of the company's original full name Nippon Kōgaku (\"Japan Optics\"; 日本光学工業株式会社). (Nikkō also means \"sunlight\" and is the name of a Japanese town.) In 1933, Nikon marketed its first camera lens under the Nikkor brand name, the \"Aero-NIKKOR,\" for aerial photography.Nikon originally reserved the Nikkor designation for its highest-quality imaging optics, but in recent history almost all Nikon lenses are so branded."
