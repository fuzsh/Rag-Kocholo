        "text": "After decades away from soap operas, Erik Rubín confessed why he is not currently interested in returning to the small screen with a melodrama. But that was not all, the former Timbiriche also explained that, if he found a project that would attract his attention, he would not be willing to star as a soap opera heartthrob.\n\nThe interpreter of When You Die for Someone gave an interview for the program Hoy where he was questioned about his absence in novels after he participated in dying to live (1989), Lazos de amor (1995) and Reaching a Star (1990), in the latter he shared credits with Andrea Legarreta, his current wife and mother of his two daughters, Kenya Gascon, Hector Suarez Gomis and Alejandro Ibarra.\n\nThis melodrama was produced by Luis de Llano, who is currently facing a public complaint against him by Sasha Sokol, and was starred by Mariana Garza and Eduardo Capetillo. However, the success that Erik Rubín achieved as a star of youth soap operas was not enough for him to remain in front of the screen and he chose to continue building within the musical realm.\n\nIn this regard, the 51-year-old interpreter said that in recent years he has received some proposals to return to television, but he has not accepted any because they have not completely attracted his attention. However, in the coming months he will resume his role as an actor in José el soñador, a musical that starred Carlos Rivera, but after his departure Kalimba will take his place leaving space for The Pharaoh.\n\n“There was an approach there at some point, but right now stuck in the shows, in the theater. I return to José the dreamer with this role, The Pharaoh, which I had already played and which I am very happy with”, he said.\n\nRegarding the possibility of returning to melodramas, he commented that he would not be willing to have a leading role as a 'heartthrob' because he considers that he is not. It is worth mentioning that the former Timbiriche was considered one of the most handsome singers of the 80s by some women in the middle besides his wife, among them Paulina Rubio and Alejandra Guzman.\n\n“I don't see myself as a heartthrob in a novel, I don't feel like a hunk, I feel like I have my personality and everything but I don't feel like a hunk,” he added.\n\nIn fact, both performers starred in one of the most popular rivalries during those years, a scandal that has accompanied them throughout their careers, especially after the songs they dedicated. When no one believed they would see them together, both singers decided to end the differences and add their talent to Perrísimas Tour.\n\nThe actor did not rule out that at some point he agreed to participate in a soap opera, however, it should meet certain characteristics: “It would have to be a project that really caught my attention, that it was given, that they really saw me there. For this kind of thing, many elements are required to amalgamate and I cannot say that I will never do it, I have done it before and as long as I turn on if I enter it.”"
