        "text": "Image is courtesy - Parque de las luces - the story of hope in Colombia, Medellin see this link: http://zizzleblog.com/2014/11/25/medellin-a-story-of-hope\n\nOnce in a while, when I am trying to see how the days go by. I find myself poring over on the soap dramas in my country that somehow people felt connected to. It is the drama of everyday life. I did remember if not all, even my own parents would let us watch this soap for us to gather together after our dinner. It was the Mexican telenovela Marimar. It was originally broadcast in 1994 on Televisa. Marimar is a remake of the telenovela La Venganza, which aired on Televisa in 1977. Marimar is widely considered one of the Best Telenovelas of all time. Thalia and Eduardo Capetillo starred as the protagonists while Chantal Andere starred as the main antagonist (1)\n\nMarimar is a poor young innocent girl who lives with her grandparents in a hut on the beach by the ocean. She falls in love with Sergio, the son of wealthy farmer Renato Santibáñez. Sergio agrees to marry Marimar despite the disapproval of his father and stepmother, Angélica, but along the way he falls deeply in love with her. The gist of the story revolved around hate, revenge, getting even, and forgiveness. In the end, Marimar eventually married Sergio. They finally lived happily ever after. That's their hopes story.\n\nOne day, my sister asked me if I can help an elderly woman who needs some assistance. She gave me a phone number I could call and the woman answered and gave me her address. I met Anne in person and discovered she could not drive on her own and disabled. I introduced myself and she wanted me to come at a certain time in a day to provide her assistance on a day to day basis.\n\nTo make a long story short, I have been her constant support. In those days, I have been with her, Anne shared with me her story of hope. She also accommodated my inquisitiveness and recounted the following story:\n\n\"I met a young man Jim and we fell in love. We were sure we were right for each other, that we both said to each other, \"You are the one!\" However, Jim parents did not agree. They were rich. He was seventeen at that time and felt we were both too young to get involved in a serious relationship. So, Jim was sent to Europe and lived there for several years. There he met another woman, who he married. I eventually married someone else. I guessed, she said. There is a truth in the saying that first love never dies.\"\n\nI was feeling sad and was moved by her story until the next day. She told me if I could drive her to a cemetery. I obliged and when I looked at the headstone or gravestone. It was Captain Jim L.C. Anne then, held my hand, since I was marveled to see. She smiled at me. The essence of hope that I saw in Anne's eyes. What resonated with me? In her heart was connected to the hope, the trust, and her faith. The possibilities of her future and her hope story seemed to replicate the drama of Marimar.\n\nMy interest in Anne's story quickened me to reminisce that time when I was watching the soap with my parents. It felt like a tale. I was mesmerized.\n\nI used to think that soap drama has too much pathos. It broke my heart if I continued watching Marimar at that time with 75 episodes. It happened that my evening classes were moved to the same time that Marimar was scheduled.\n\nI realized Anne's story had a happy ending as she continued to unfold her story out of my curiosity. I was fascinated to learn about the outcome of her quest to find Jim had paved off.\n\nI would like to think and borrowed from an author who quoted these words.\n\n\"Hope is something that brings sunshine into the shadows of our lives. It is our link to a better tomorrow. When hope is gone, so too is our life force. And when hope is kept alive, so too is our determination to go on.\"\n\nI think it may be better to ask, what is your soap drama? Is it connected to your hope story?"
