        "text": "UPDATE: Bibi Gaytan, Eduardo Capetilo Welcome Twin Boys: Manuel, Daniel Named After Their Grandfathers\n\nBibi Gaytán and Eduardo Capetillo are expecting twins after 20 years of marriage. The couple, that is 41 and 43 years of age respectively, already have three children, Eduardo (19), Ana Paula (16) and Alejandra (14), will experience being parents of a set of babies again later this year. Entertainment gossip show, \"Ventaneando,\" broke the news with reporter Atala Sarmiento mentioning Bibi is being taken care of in San Diego, California, where the family currently resides. The celebrity pair have not made the news official, but it is known that Gaytán has two months of gestation.\n\nBibi and Eduardo signed a lucrative deal with TV Azteca at the end of 2010 with possibilities of major projects like telenovelas and television shows. Although everyone wanted to see Bibi back in soaps, this never materialized and she was only given participations in reality shows. Her first stint was as a co-host of singing competition \"La Academia,\" which she received terrible reviews for her on-screen nerveousness and bad command of stage presence. In 2013 she returned to the small screen as the lead judge in a dancing competition titled \"México Baila,\" which was a ratings success. In contrast to his wife, Capetillo was able to return to Mexico's favorite genre and starred oppositie Gabriela Spanic in \"La Otra Cara del Alma\" to moderate success.\n\nThe couple broke their ties with Azteca late last year as they never seemed happy with the projects set by the network. However, this new project they are both brewing up should keep them busy for years to come. With their three children already teenagers, it will probably seem like a breeze for Bibi to enjoy the companionship her set of twins will provide for her. Congratulations to the parents to be!"
