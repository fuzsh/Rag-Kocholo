        "text": "Love is in the air and it’s a time when we are reminded not only about our loved ones, but also those we’ve seen who have been blessed to have found their soulmate. We’ve had some pretty iconic couples across the decades in Latino pop culture, so we wanted to take a look at a few of our favorite — even the ones that aren’t together anymore. After all, we know that even though a couple can break up, their love lives on as an inspiration to others even if it didn’t have a happy ending. From Emilio and Gloria Estefan to Chris Perez and Selena Quintanilla-Perez to Shakira and Gerard Piqué there are plenty of iconic pairings that hold a special place in our hearts.\n\nThere’s been ups, downs and everything in between, but lots of these couples managed to stick it out through thick and thin, staying true to the marital vows of “for better or worse” (even when they probably shouldn’t have). Hey, the heart wants what it wants and who are we to judge? Still, some of these relationships burned white-hot until both partners could find no other way out than to call it quits. But you know, del amor al odio hay un paso. They’re still ICONS of love and passion!\n\nThere is a reason telenovelas are so popular and the love stories are a huge part of that, so sit back and enjoy this list of some of the best and most enduring couples in our pop culture history.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nLucille Ball & Desi Arnaz\n\nLucy and Desi are probably the most iconic TV couple of all time but their romance lived both on & off-screen. Enduring infidelity, alcohol addiction, and late nights of touring and filming, Lucy and Desi eventually divorced after years of marriage. They first met on the set of the film Too Many Girls, an ironic twist of fate considering all of Desi’s noted philandering, but Lucy managed to keep him in one place and off the late-night touring circuit when she landed her TV show I Love Lucy. Though they divorced in 1960, Desi’s flame for Lucy never truly died, as he married her body double a few years later (who looked remarkably like her). They shared two children and nearly two decades of marriage before they flamed out.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nPedro Knight and Celia Cruz\n\nYou don’t have to go out looking for love, because often it comes to you. So was the love story of Pedro Knight and Celia Cruz. The iconic couple met through music when Celia became a singer for La Sonora Matancera, a musical group of which Pedro was a member. Their marriage lasted for 45 years, from their wedding in 1962 to Cruz’s death in 2003. Celia and Pedro will forever be one of the biggest Latinx couples of all time and a testament to eternal love.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nBenjamin Bratt and Talisa Soto\n\nAnother iconic Latinx couple who have stood the test of time is the duo of Benjamin Bratt and Talisa Soto. The Quechua Peruvian actor and the Nuyorican model and actress have been married since 2002, having first met during the casting audition of his iconic film, Blood In, Blood Out (Bound by Honor). The couple has two children, daughter Sophia Rosalinda Bratt, and son Mateo Bravery Bratt, and continue to show off their love on social media.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nJose “Pepe” Baston and Eva Longoria-Baston\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Byy4TV0HIte/\n\nEva Longoria found her true love when she met fellow Mexicano, Jose “Pepe” Baston, a businessman who served as president of Televisa. But she had the assistance of a mutual friend, who set the two up on a blind date. It worked, and the couple was married in Mexico in May of 2016. In 2018, Longoria and Baston welcomed their son, Sebastian, to the world. All you need to do is visit Eva’s Instagram to see her glow of happiness in being an in-love wife and doting mother.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nLázaro Ramos and Tais Araujo\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B8TcVLvjBki/\n\nThe next couple on this list who give us a great example of Latinx love — and Afro-Latinx love — as well as relationship goals, is Lázaro Ramos and Tais Araujo. The Brazilian actor, director, presenter, voice actor, and writer, and Brazilian actress, model, and television host married in 2005 but broke up in 2008. However, their true love brought the two back together in 2009. Lazaro and Tais have two children, son João Vicente, and daughter Maria Antônia.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nEmilio and Gloria Estefan\n\nOne of the biggest Latinx power couples of all time are Cubanos Emilio and Gloria Estefan. Together, they found love and also found success bringing the Cuban sound to America in a new way. Like fellow Cubanos Pedro Knight and Celia Cruz, Gloria and Emilio connected through music (Emilio is the band leader of the Miami Sound Machine), and have been together ever since. Married in 1978, the couple have celebrated 41 years of marriage and have two children: son Nayib and daughter Emily. They are also grandparents to Nayib’s son Sasha Argento.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nAlex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B3AooAMAmtU/\n\nClose your eyes and picture the ultimate Latinx power couple. Chances are, Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez pop into your head. The Dominican baseball icon and the Nuyorican entertainment legend are powerful on their own but together they have created something that everyone wants to emulate. The couple has known each other for a while (remember that photo of her meeting him with then-hubby Marc Anthony?) but decided to give dating a shot in 2017. J-Lo and A-Rod are now engaged to be married and have already blended their families perfectly.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nWilliam Levy and Elizabeth Gutierrez\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/B7rqW3bpedr/\n\nLove isn’t perfect and neither are the two people who decided to share a life together. But when it’s true love, things usually work out. Such is the case with Latinx couple William Levy and Elizabeth Gutierrez. The Cuban actor and model and Chicana actress and model first met on the reality show, Protagonistas de Novela 2, and started dating in 2003. Their relationship has been on and off but is currently on and they seem to appear to be happy. William and Elizabeth have two children: son Christopher Alexander, and daughter Kailey Alexandra.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nDiego Rivera and Frida Kahlo\n\nYou can’t say Diego Rivera without mentioning Frida Kahlo. Their love life wasn’t perfect, but there was no doubt that there was love between the two iconic Mexican artists, and the two remain to this day forever intertwined. Despite a 20 year age difference, the two began dating and first married in 1929, divorcing 10 years later. But Frida and Diego couldn’t stay apart from each other and remarried in San Francisco in 1940. The two icons stayed together until Kahlo’s death in 1954.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nPique and Shakira\n\nAnother couple we love is Pique and Shakira. The Spanish football star and the iconic Colombian singer-songwriter met on the set of her video for “Waka Waka (This Time for Africa),” proving that one can find true love on the job. Despite an age difference of a decade, they fell in love, and have been together since 2011 (she wrote about their love story in the song, “Me Enamore”). Shakira and Pique also have two sons: Milan and Sasha.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nCarmelo and Lala Anthony\n\nCarmelo Anthony and Lala Anthony have gone through their ups and downs, but still found a way to make their relationship work. The two Afro-Puerto-Rican celebs (with Carmelo being a basketball star and Lala being an actress, television personality, author, producer, and businesswoman) first started dating in 2003 and got engaged in 2004. Lala and Carmelo tied the knot in 2010, after welcoming their son Kiyan in 2007. While they separated in 2017, the Latinx lovebirds reconciled and are still together.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nCesar and Helen Chavez\n\nWhat this photo says is true: “Behind every great man, is a great woman.” This was definitely the case with Cesar Chavez, and his wife, Helen. The Chicana and the Mexican icon married in 1948 and went on to have eight children (and 31 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren). Helen Chavez also was part of her husband’s cause. She volunteered at the Community Service Organization (CSO), taught literacy classes for migrant workers and helped them get their U.S. citizenship, served as a bookkeeper for the National Farmworkers Association and head of its credit union, and was a part of demonstrations. All of this in addition to working up to 10 hours to support her family.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nToni Costa and Adamari Lopez\n\nAnother sweet Latinx love story we are totally here for is that of Toni Costa and Adamari Lopez. The Spanish professional dancer, and the Puerto Rican actress and television host met in a very romantic way. The two were paired together on the reality dancing competition, Mira Quien Baila, and fell in love dancing. Toni and Adamari have now been together for eight years, engaged to be married and the proud parents of daughter Alaïa.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nPrince Royce and Emeraude Toubia\n\nPrince Royce has found his princess in actress Emeraude Toubia. The Dominican singer-songwriter met the Mexican-Lebanese at a restaurant with mutual friends, and that meeting proved to be an important one. The couple started dating in 2011 and became engaged in 2017. Emeraude and Prince Royce then tied the knot in 2018, first in a civil ceremony, and later in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nJavier Bardem and Penelope Cruz\n\nPenelope Cruz and Javier Bardem are big-name Hispanic actors on their own. But together, they form one of Hollywood’s best-known and longest-lasting power couples. The Spanish stars worked together on the film Jamon, Jamon before they started dating in 2007 (they have gone on to co-star in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, and The Counselor). Javier and Penelope married in 2010, and have two children: son Leo and daughter Luna.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nJorge Negrete and Maria Felix\n\nIn 1952, two major Mexican pop culture icons entered into matrimony — Jorge Negrete and Maria Felix. But the Mexican stars weren’t always in love. In fact, when they starred in the 1943 film, El Peñón de las Animas, they hated each other! But things changed, and the two eventually saw each other in a different light. Unfortunately, however, their marriage was short-lived, as Negrete died in 1953 of cirrhosis of the liver.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nJorge Ramos and Chiquinquira Delgado\n\nJorge Ramos and Chiquinquira Delgado are relationship goals. The Mexican journalist and author, and the Venezuelan actress, television host, and model have been dating since 2003, and although they aren’t married, they are perfectly happy with the way things are in their wonderful relationship. Both have been married previously, and have successfully blended their families together, finding that what they have together is ideal.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nLuis Miguel and Mariah Carey\n\nNot all iconic Latinx couples stand the test of time. When Mariah Carey dated Luis Miguel, it was like two Latinx superstars colliding in love. They were beautiful, massively successful, and together! Luis and Mariah dated from 1998 to 2001, during which she wrote her hit, “Thank God I Found You” which was believed to be about him.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nSebastian Lletget and Becky G\n\nBecky G and her man, Sebastian Lletget have been going strong since 2016. The Chicana singer and Argentinian soccer player were introduced by Naomi Scott, Becky’s co-star in the film Power Rangers, and her husband Jordan Spence. Since then, we have seen the lovebirds on red carpets together and on each other’s social media.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nAntonio Aguilar and Flor Silvestre\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bg261QKB_QA/\n\nSinger and actor Antonio Aguilar and singer and actress Flor Silvestre’s union is one of Mexico and Latinoamerica’s greatest love stories. The two legends married in 1959. Together they headed the Aguilar dynasty, which includes sons Pepe and Antonio Aguilar Jr., and granddaughter Angela Aguilar.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nRuben and Isabel Toledo\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BsHEX28A4ci/\n\nRuben and Isabel Toledo were able to share their love and their work. The Cuban fashion illustrator and Cuban fashion designer met in high school and went on to marry in 1984. The two collaborated together on fashion projects and remained married until Isabel’s unfortunate death of breast cancer in 2019.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nEduardo Capetillo and Bibi Gaytan\n\nAnother story of finding love on the set of a television show is that of Eduardo Capetillo and Bibi Gaytan. Married for 25 years, the two Mexican actors and singers were in the group Timbiriche together, and also co-starred in the novela, Bailar Conmigo. Eduardo and Bibi have five children: Eduardo Jr., Ana Paula, Alejandra, Manuel, and Daniel.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nMiguel Varoni and Catherine Siachoque\n\nColombian acting icons Miguel Varoni and Catherine Siachoque are another couple who have stood the test of time. They, too, met on the set of a novela, Las Juanas, and have been together since 1996, and married since 1997, proving to be one of the strongest marriages in Colombian and Latinx pop culture!\n\nwp_*posts\n\nChris Perez and Selena Quintanilla-Perez\n\nChris Perez and Selena Quintanilla-Perez had a love that we still talk about today. Music brought them together as members of Selena y Los Dinos, but true love sealed the deal. The Chicanxs married in 1992 and remained married until Selena’s tragic death in 1995.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nWilly Chirino and Lissette\n\nAn iconic Cuban couple still going strong is Willy Chirino and Lissette. The singers, songwriters, and record producers have been married since 1980, and have three children together: Nicolle, Alana, and Gianfranco. Willy and Lissette even have recorded music together, including their first duets album, Amarraditos.\n\nwp_*posts\n\nHumberto Zurita and Christian Bach\n\nThe only thing that separated actor, producer, and director Humberto Zurita and actress and producer Christian Bach was death. The legendary couple got married in 1986, the same year that they co-starred in the telenovela, De pura sangre. Christian and Zurita remained together until her death in 2019, and share two sons: Sebastian and Emiliano."
