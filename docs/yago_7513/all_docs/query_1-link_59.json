This based on the radionovela La indomable and at the same time is an adaptation of La indomable produced by Radio Caracas Televisión in 1974.\n\nThalía and Eduardo Capetillo star as the main protagonists,[2] while Chantal Andere stars as the main antagonist.\n\nPlot[]\n\nMarimar is a poor young innocent girl who lives with her grandparents in a hut on the beach by the ocean at San Martin dela Costa. She falls in love with Sergio, the son of wealthy farmer Renato Santibáñez. Sergio agrees to marry Marimar despite the disapproval of his father and stepmother, Angélica, but along the way he falls deeply in love with her.\n\nAngélica despises Marimar because of her innocence and her lack of knowledge of the world of high society. She constantly embarrasses Marimar, often diminishing her worth as an individual. Sergio becomes angry and decides to go away and earn money so he can take Marimar away from his father's house and safe from Angélica's wrath. Angélica also forced Marimar to pull a bracelet out of a mud puddle with her teeth, telling her it was from Sergio's biological mother. Later, Angélica tells the police that Marimar stole the same bracelet from her, and Marimar is sent to prison. Then Angélica sends one of her servants, Nicandro, to set fire on the humble hut belonging to Marimar's grandparents, which results in their deaths. In addition, she also forges Sergio's handwriting and writes a fake letter to Marimar stating that he wants nothing more to do with her and that he never loved her. All these, along with the impact of her grandparents’ deaths, changes Marimar and sets her on the road to revenge.\n\nAfter leaving prison, Marimar then moves from her hometown to Mexico City with Padre Porres and works to get back on track, with a new identity as \"Bella Aldama\". While working as a servant in the Aldama mansion, she then meets her biological father, Gustavo, who has been looking for her for many years, without either of them knowing of their relationship. He and her aunt Esperanza, teach her how to read, write, to speak eloquently, and to dress elegantly. She finds out she is pregnant, and later gives birth to a daughter, Crucita.\n\nAfter the new and improved Marimar is ready to face society, Gustavo decides to take her to the opera, where she bumps into Sergio, and her plan for revenge against him and the Santibañez family begins. Fueled by anger, Marimar (assuming the identity of Bella and denying to Sergio and other people that she is Marimar) seduces Sergio constantly and then rejects his advances to hurt her. However, fate lead them to a new destination, Valle Encantado, where little by little, Marimar (as Bella), found even more obstacles that separates her from happiness, as Natalia Montenegro, the daughter of governor Fernando Montenegro (who also wants and falls in love with Bella), becomes obsessed with Sergio and at the same time, plans to make Marimar miserable.\n\nMarimar then strips Renato and Angélica of their wealth. She buys out the Santibáñez home (and renames it Hacienda los Abuelos), and embarrasses Angélica the way she was embarrassed before. As Sergio divorces Marimar and gets ready to marry his childhood friend Inocencia del Castillo, Marimar plans on breaking them up. Secretly, Sergio is still in love with Marimar.\n\nAngélica then gets into a car accident, while on her way to Valle Encantado, and suffers severe burns. While on her deathbed, as her last wish, she wants Marimar burned alive in her home. Innocencia finds out that Sergio has been trying to frequently visit Marimar at her home. The pregnant Innocencia falls and is taken to the hospital, where she has her baby and is subsequently diagnosed with a brain tumor. She then makes a deal with Marimar, that if she survives her operation, Marimar will leave her and Sergio alone, but if she doesn't, Marimar will have to marry Sergio.\n\nMarimar then decides to forget about Sergio by falling in love with another man, Engr. Adrian Rosales. Innocencia then has brain surgery and survives her operation. Ashamed of all she has done, she then allows Marimar to eventually marry Sergio, and Renato also asks Marimar for forgiveness. They finally marry and live happily ever after.\n\nCast[]\n\n{{columns-list|colwidth=30em| Text (usually a list) }}\n\nAwards and Nominations[]\n\n13th TVyNovelas Awards[]\n\nCategory Nominado(a) Resultado Best Actress Thalía Nominee Best Actor Eduardo Capetillo Nominee Best Antagonist Actress Chantal Andere Nominee Best Antagonist Actor Toño Infante Nominee Best Leading Actor Tito Guízar Nominee Highest-rated soap opera in the United States Winner\n\nPremios ACE 1995[]\n\nCategory Nominee Result Mejor programa escénico del año Verónica Pimstein Winner Mejor figura femenina del año Thalía Winner Mejor figura masculina del año Eduardo Capetillo Winner Mejor dirección[3] Beatriz Sheridan Winner\n\nRemake[]\n\nThe first ever remake, as granted by Televisa, was the 2007 Philippine version of the same title MariMar starring Marian Rivera under GMA Network.
