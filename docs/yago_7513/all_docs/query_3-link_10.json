        "text": "Eduardo Capetillo got tired and broke the silence about the rumors of being very jealous of Biby Gaytán. Speculation suggests that the actor He is a husband who controls the life of the also actress and even prohibits him from participating in some projects.\n\n“I take those kinds of comments normally, it's okay. Actually they are right. Because when they make a judgment, it's their judgment, so I can't do anything about it; so they are right,” Capetillo said in a meeting with the media, highlighted People en Español.\n\nThis is not the first time that such rumors have circulated. Since they got married in 1994, it has been said that the actor preferred Biby to retire from the media to dedicate himself completely to his family. The couple has five children.\n\n\"My husband has always been very careful, and yes, yes, I'm not going to say no, but...\" Gaitán said before being interrupted by Eduardo to point out: \"then rumors like this come out and nothing happens.\" Without giving more details, the artist did not want to talk more about it.\n\nDespite the comments, the couple has been seen in love and united. Comments always come to light on social networks where they have been pointed out as a “toxic” couple for being extremely jealous. Eduardo Capetillo is accused of being the culprit that Biby no longer appears in soap operas.\n\n“We do not control”\n\nDays ago, the Mexican dancer clarified that her husband does not control her and explained the reason why she could not speak to the press during an event.\n\n“We do not control, we do not coordinate those interviews, nor do we coordinate the call to the media. If we always have something, it is gratitude to the media and the public, who have always been with us,” she assured.\n\nAnd he added: “I am very sorry if something happened. I think, a little, that there was not the organization that perhaps should have been, but it is out of my reach in that sense and I am very sorry, ”said People en Español.\n\n“I haven't heard anything”\n\nRegarding these rumors that have persecuted the Capetillo-Gaytán family, one of their daughters, Ana Paula, responded last August to the questions and denied her knowledge regarding their origin.\n\n“I found out about this very late, but I think it happened at an event that took place recently, and it was more the organization of the event, I don't want to blame; I hope it doesn't happen again. My mother has always loved being close to the press and giving interviews,” she said in an interview with the program 'Despierta América' during the musical play 'Amor sin Barreras', where she shared credits with her mother.\n\n“Yes I know about that rumor. What I have always said is that I never knew where she came from. I don't know if it was before my time, before I was born, but it has always been there all my life. At least, I have never had to see or hear anything, and I live for them. But I don't know,\" added Eduardo Capetillo's daughter.\n\n\"I've never seen bad things in the press about my family, but I do believe that also having grown up in a family of artists you also start to say 'I'm not going to care what they say,'\" he emphasized."
