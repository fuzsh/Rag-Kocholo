        "text": "Eduardo Capetillo's song 'Me Tienes' is a heartfelt declaration of love and devotion. The lyrics express a deep yearning to be close to a loved one, to wake up beside them, and to understand how such a profound connection was formed. The singer's desire to bind himself to his partner and hear assurances of their commitment is palpable. This longing is not just physical but emotional, as he pledges his entire passion and heart to his beloved.\n\nThe chorus emphasizes the completeness of his devotion, stating that his fury, peace, and satisfaction are all in the hands of his partner. This suggests a relationship where the loved one holds significant power over his emotional state. The repeated plea to 'ask for anything' and the promise to fulfill it instantly highlights a willingness to go to great lengths to ensure the partner's happiness. However, there's a cautionary note about not causing harm, indicating a vulnerability and the potential for regret if the relationship is not handled with care.\n\nThe song also touches on the themes of fear and love, urging the partner to embrace love fully and let go of any fears. The lines 'Amar as√≠, es comprender... y es descubrir y maldecer...' suggest that true love involves understanding, discovery, and even cursing the complexities that come with it. The repeated refrain reinforces the idea that this love is not fleeting but a deep, enduring passion. Capetillo's delivery, combined with the emotive lyrics, creates a powerful ode to the intensity and depth of romantic love."
