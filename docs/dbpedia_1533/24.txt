Concert,

Introduction: Andrzej Sosnowski

Three musical individualists joined forces for the purpose of a single project: to create a musical interpretation of poems by the French poet, Arthur Rimbaud. The idea arose spontaneously and proved to be a great success. Combined with the intensity and visionary nature of Rimbaud’s poetry, the saxophone and clarinet of Mikołaj Trzaska, the electronic sound of Michał Jacaszek and the rock vocal of Tomasz Budzyński, the music oscillates between intimacy and ecstasy in a most peculiar way.
