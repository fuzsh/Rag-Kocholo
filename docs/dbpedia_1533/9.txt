Exhibition: “Journey to the East” - paintings by Tomasz Budzyński

A world of images perfectly complements work and spiritual path of an eminent singer, composer and poet.

Tomasz Budzyński (b.2 October 1962 in Tarnobrzeg) – Polish rock singer, painter and poet; graduated from High School of Visual Arts in Nałęczów. He was born in Tarnobrzeg, but grew up in Puławy, where he moved with his parents after a few years. In the 1990s he was living in Stanclewo and Warsaw but he is currently based in Poznań.

Budzyński is mainly known as a vocalist of numerous rock bands: Siekiera, Armia, 2Tm2,3, Budzy and Trupia Czaszka. He also recorded solo albums:Taniec szkieletów (2002), Luna (2008) and Osobliwości (2011). He is the composer of music for Iuvenilium Permanens, a play staged at The Juliusz Słowacki Theatre in Krakow. He also had his own radio programme “Radio NRD" at Józef radio station. Married with two children. In 2009, he established a cultural society called “Niewidzialna Armia”( Invisible Army), which he also chairs.

On 25 May 2011, he was awarded by the Minister of Culture and National Heritage Bogdan Zdrojewski with Gloria Artis - the Bronze Medal of Merit to Culture.

In the summer of 2010, the Invisible Army Society created a film entitled “Podróż na Wschód” (Journey to the East), with Tomasz Budzyński as a co-director and actor playing the part of the Tea Seller. In the same year he wrote Soul Side Story, an autobiography.

His painting is regarded as traditional. It is not socially committed, doesn’t discourse with new trends and does not follow them; it is personal, full of memories associated with afterimages. It is even described as naïve but widely open to interpretations. Budzyński often paints landscapes but they are not realistic or figurative; critics describe them as based on individual understanding of the viewer. The message of the artist’s works is interpreted as connections between good and beauty.
