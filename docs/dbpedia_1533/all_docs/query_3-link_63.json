        "text": "TEXTILE takes cues from the realm of fashion, translating the concepts and techniques of textiles into the realm of #furnituredesign. The assembly method employed in the collection mirrors the stitching of seams in clothing. This approach allows for the creation of highly flexible pieces that conform to each user, akin to tailored garments in fashion. Through this stitching technique, ergonomic perfection is achieved, ensuring both #comfort and distinctive #design character. Ana Llobet Seva designed TEXTILE for GANDIA BLASCO GROUP. #NextSpace #outdoorfurniture #outdoorliving #luxuryfurniture #luxuryliving #outdoorlifestyle #comfortandstyle #hospitalitydesign #design #art #architecture #outdoordesign #commercialdesign #furnituresolutions #furnitureinnovation #outdoorrecreation\n\nCrafted from luxurious fabric, this bust stand is not just a display piece. It is a testament to refined aesthetics and the power of functional design. Made from durable MDF and wrapped with carefully selected fabric, its anatomically correct form showcases pieces with artistic flair, transforming static decor into dynamic storytellers. As textures and silhouettes blend in perfect harmony, customers are captivated and inspired, lingering in each captivating world. #VisualMerchandising #ProductDisplay #ProjectManagement\n\nIn the same way that fashion drives innovation in upholstery design, the same happens to furniture design thanks to art movements. And although beneficial for both parties, there is much debate surrounding the level of dependency. 𝗦𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝗳𝘂𝗿𝗻𝗶𝘁𝘂𝗿𝗲 𝗱𝗲𝘀𝗶𝗴𝗻𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗱𝗿𝗮𝘄 𝗱𝗶𝗿𝗲𝗰𝘁 𝗶𝗻𝘀𝗽𝗶𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝗮𝗿𝘁 𝗺𝗼𝘃𝗲𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁𝘀, 𝗼𝗿 𝘀𝗵𝗼𝘂𝗹𝗱 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝘆 𝗯𝗲 𝗳𝗼𝗿𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗴 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗶𝗿 𝗼𝘄𝗻 𝗰𝗿𝗲𝗮𝘁𝗶𝘃𝗲 𝗽𝗮𝘁𝗵? The relationship between the two is a complex one because whilst furniture design is influenced by other factors like cultural shifts and tech advancements, art movements continue to play a significant role in introducing trends and aesthetics. For example, the organic shapes and natural materials of the Art Nouveau movement inspired designers to explore new ways of integrating nature into their designs. Similarly, clean geometric lines from the Bauhaus movement influenced the development of modernist furniture, emphasizing simplicity and mass production. So, there’s no doubt that art movements have long provided a framework but at the same time, should furniture designers be reinterpreting or deviating from it?

This is another part of a project that I absolutely love. #design #samples #colours #interiorfitout #corporatedesign #interiordesigner #freelancedesigner #corporateidentity #fabrics\n\n#EveryBaxsaaHasAStory Case Study 5/100 Client Background: Naresh, a seasoned saree weaver with over 50 years of experience from Sree Vasavi Silk Palace.
