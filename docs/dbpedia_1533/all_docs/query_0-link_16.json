Za muzyczny cel zespół objął sobie wykonywanie dzieł muzyki kościelnej od okresu baroku aż po współczesność. Początków chóru należy szukać już w 1930 roku, wówczas na czele chóru stanął Ludwig Doormann, który prowadził go do 1971 roku. Po nim batutę przejął do 1999 roku Hermann Amlung. Do dziś od wspomnianego czasu szefem zespołu jest Bernd Eberhardt. W ciągu ostatnich lat niemal wszystkie utwory muzyki kościelnej zostały przez chór opracowane, przygotowane i wykonywane. Wśród nich znajdują się dzieła Richarda Straussa (Deutsche Motette), Franka Martina (Msza na podwójny chór) czy Franza Schmidta (Księga Siedmiu Pieczęci). Chór koncertował w wielu europejskich krajach, biorąc udział w m.in. w festiwalach. Regularnie uczestniczy też w nabożeństwach w kościele św. Jana w Getyndze.\n\nGROHMAN ORCHESTRA – przyjęła swą nazwę od imienia wielkiego konesera sztuki i przyjaciela artystów, łodzianina Henryka Grohmana. To nazwa bardzo związana z fabrykancką Łodzią. Zespół tworzą muzycy Filharmonii Łódzkiej, liderzy poszczególnych grup oraz koncertmistrz jako skrzypek-dyrygent. Dotychczas Grohman Orchestra grała głównie walce, arie, polki, uwertury i marsze rodziny Straussów. Jednak aby rozszerzyć swój repertuar powstał projekt – „Grohman Orchestra – Klasyka polskiej rozrywki”. Przeprowadzona wśród sympatyków zespołu i melomanów festiwalu Geyer Music Factory ankieta na temat najbardziej przebojowych utworów ostatnich 40 lat pokazała, że lubimy stare, dobre piosenki. One właśnie, w klasycznym brzmieniu naszego zespołu, zabrzmią w nowych, ciekawych aranżacjach. Klasyka polskiej rozrywki według Krzysztofa Herdzina!\n\nGRZEGORZ KUPCZYK – singer; At the end of 1980 Grzegorz became the vocalist of Turbo. That day marks the beginning of the fully professional career, which can be divided into three main periods of time, when he simultaneously was the vocalist of three important for the Polish Rock history bands: Turbo, Ceti and Non Iron.
