        "text": "Podlasie Opera and Philharmonic – European Center in Bialystok\n\nPodlasie Opera and Philharmonic – European Art Centre in Białystok is the largest arts institution in north-eastern Poland and the most modern cultural center in this region of Europe. The building was designed by the atelier of Prof. Dr. Architect Marek Budzyński.\n\nThe minimalist architecture connecting to its surrounding has transformed the space, creating conditions that sustain and conceive life, especially that of music, culture and the public.\n\nThanks to the cooperation started in 2005, at the very beginning of the project, based on the original design of Dr. Budzyński and Krystyna Ilmurzyńska, it became possible to create the glass artwork of Tomasz Urbanowicz.\n\nThe two pieces hanging above the Odessa Staircase, created by Tomasz Urbanowicz were inspired by sketches- sheets of music by Professor Krzysztof Penderecki.\n\nThe musical scores of Krzysztof Penderecki, Jerzy Maksymiuk, Stanisław Moniuszko and W. A. Mozart have been pressed into the thick glass creating a relief.\n\nThe glass capitals of the columns refer to the characteristic onion-domed roofs of Orthodox churches in the region.\n\nThe investor for this piece was the Podlaskie Voivodeship Marshal’s Office.\n\nVirtual tour around the building"
