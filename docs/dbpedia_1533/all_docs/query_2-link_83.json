        "text": "Siekiera (Polish for \"Axe\") was a Polish post-punk band. With fast, aggressive music and lyrics filled with obscenities, the band was a sensation at the 1984 Jarocin Festival. After lineup changes, the band switched to new wave and then dissolved in 1988.\n\nSiekiera formed in 1982 or 1983 in Puławy, Poland, under the name of \"Trafo\". The original line-up consisted of guitarist Tomasz Adamski, vocalist Tomasz Budzyński, bass player Jerzy Janaczek, and drummer Irek \"Borys\" Czerniak. They started by playing cover songs of UK Subs and The Exploited.\n\nIn the autumn of 1983 they changed their name to Siekiera (Polish for \"Axe\"). The original line-up was Tomasz Adamski (a.k.a. Dzwon) - guitar, leader, the author of all lyrics and music, Tomasz Budzyński (a.k.a. Budzy) - vocals, Dariusz Malinowski (a.k.a. Malina) - bass, and Krzysztof Grela (a.k.a. Koben) - drums. For a while some guy called Piotr Szewczyk played guitar, but they fired him because of his blues influences.\n\n[]\n\nPeel mentioned on his 25 August 1987 show that he received 10-12 new singles from Poland. One of them from Siekiera, was played on his 02 September 1987 programme. Another track from the band was played on his show on 16 August 1988, which was sent by his 'correspondent' in Poland.\n\nShows Played[]\n\n1987\n\n02 September 1987: Jest Bezpiecznie (7\" - Jest Bezpiecznie / Misiowie Puszyści) Tonpress\n\n1988\n\n16 August 1988: To Słowa (LP - Nowa Aleksandria) Tonpress\n\n[]"
