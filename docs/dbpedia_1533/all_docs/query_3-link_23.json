        "text": "New groups and new sounds\n\nWe already know more than half of the artists who will perform in Lublin during the East of Culture – Different Sounds Festival. We are happy to announce that another three exceptional bands will be adding their music to the wide scale of different sounds. Rimbaud – a musical response to the works of the poet, WarsawAfrobeat Orchestra – a colourful dance mixture, and Kasai – one of the most interesting and fresh groups from our eastern neighbours.\n\nRimbaud is a unique project created as a result of a meeting between three exceptional artists. It is a combination of energies, ideas and the extraordinary sensitivity of Mikołaj Trzaska, Tomasz Budzyński and Michał Jacaszek. The musicians are going to present a fresh and intriguing material inspired by the works of the famous Arthur Rimbaud. The project record will be released at the end of May.\n\nAnother important record linked to this year’s edition of the festival is „Wëndelu” by Warsaw Afrobeat Orchestra.This energetic collective form Warsaw will perform in Lublin on the same day as the world legend of Afrobeat – Tony Allen. It will be a perfect opportunity to find out how a Polish band interprets the genre. And they are truly excellent, as it can be heard on their record published by the cult American label Ubiquiti.\n\nThe trio Kasai will travel to Lublin straight from Kiev. In their music they combine jazz improvisation with contemporary electronic sounds and club music. Their concert is another interesting festival proposition that will present the modern music scene of our eastern neighbours.\n\nThis year’s edition of the East of Culture – Different Sounds Art’n’Music Festival will take place between July 8-12. During the 5 days the festival will feature twenty bands and music projects from artists from 13 different countries. What is more, we will be able to see and listen to Einstürzende Neubauten and Tony Allen during their only concerts in Poland.\n\nAll festival events are FREE OF CHARGE.\n\nTo find out more, visit en.innebrzmienia.eu\n\n***\n\nThe East of Culture is a cultural project that integrates the artistic circles of the cities of Eastern Poland (Białystok, Lublin and Rzeszów) and artists from the Eastern Partnership countries (Armenia, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Georgia, Moldova and Ukraine), carried out by the National Centre for Culture and the three mentioned cities. The idea behind the project is a shared exploration of what is unique to each of the cultures, as well as the exchange of artistic experiences. Over time, the festival has become a platform integrating our Eastern partners in the circulation of European culture. In 2015 the East of Culture will be organised for the third time. The project was made possible thanks to the involvement of creative communities, local governments and the Ministry of Culture and National Heritage."
