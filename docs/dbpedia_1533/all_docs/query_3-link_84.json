This document discusses the concept of God in the architectural design work of Polish architect Marek Budzynski. It describes how Budzynski's work in the 1970s-2000s was inspired by eco-philosophy and the teachings of Pope John Paul II, aiming to harmonize architecture with nature. It provides details on two of Budzynski's most notable projects - the University of Warsaw Library and the Temple of Divine Providence in Warsaw - and analyzes how they manifested his vision of integrating architecture with the landscape in an organic way.",
