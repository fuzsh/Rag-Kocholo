        "text": "A documentary about three famous Polish singers: Tomasz Budzyński of „Armia\", Robert Friedrich of \"Acid Drinkers”, and Dariusz Malejonek from the reggae group \"Houk\". The bohemian artists have changed their lives completely from a alcohol and drug-filled youth. The filmmaker presents their lives in two important parts: The turning point that constituted a religious awakening and their lives three years after their decision to change."
