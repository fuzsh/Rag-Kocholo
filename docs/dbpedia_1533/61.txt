A documentary about three famous Polish singers: Tomasz Budzyński of „Armia", Robert Friedrich of "Acid Drinkers”, and Dariusz Malejonek from the reggae group "Houk". The bohemian artists have changed their lives completely from a alcohol and drug-filled youth. The filmmaker presents their lives in two important parts: The turning point that constituted a religious awakening and their lives three years after their decision to change.
