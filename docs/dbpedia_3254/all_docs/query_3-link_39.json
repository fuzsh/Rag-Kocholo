        "text": "Watchdogs Wednesdays: Vegas Here We Come! We are so excited to be apart of Channel Partners again this year, and we have an incredible team of experts on hand to educate our partners about our managed IT services! If you are interested in learning about the latest and greatest in the industry please reach out to set up sometime to discuss. #channelpartners #mobility #cyber #itmanagement\n\nAs event marketers, we always want to deliver value to our attendees. But we must keep in mind that it is important for that value to be had equitably among all attendees. That is why it is critical to measure the impact of DEI for events. To get EMMC's full guidance, join today. https://lnkd.in/ddiTHuBa\n\nAvoid these mistakes when you attend a conference! I will be at eTail EU Nordic ‚Äò23 in Copenhagen next week. This is what I will not do (and how to do it better): ‚ùå Attend the conference without knowing anything about the relevant parties Better: Connect with people ahead, generate awareness, and inform yourself via LinkedIn and event apps. Also, make sure to scope out the competition! ‚ùå Showcase offered services without properly analyzing the prospect Better: Understand your prospects' pain points and prepare custom-tailored solutions ‚ùå Gather generic media decks, presentations, and case studies to showcase Better: Analyze the attending audiences, focus on the solutions that fit best to your chosen vertical, and highlight the added value backed by custom-tailored data ‚ùå Blindly attend speaker sessions and listen without any context Better: Inform yourself, approach the speaker after the session and prepare questions about the topics presented to spark a discussion Do you have additional valuable insights on how you prepare for an upcoming conference? Perhaps you can let me know in person at the venue! üòÑ\n\nMust attend event! Our very own CEO and President, W. June Simmons, will be speaking on July 9th on \"Success Stories From Working With Health Systems/Payers in Providing Care Transitions\" from 3:00 PM - 3:30 PM. This session will start with what goes wrong when the transition process isn‚Äôt carefully planned, what that planning should entail, how to work with hospitals, health systems, and payers in contracting for and implementing the service, and an overview of the evidence-based tools available to support the process.\n\nHow to moderate a roundtable discussion üó£Ô∏è Eleanor Beaton is THE expert when it comes to facilitating conversation! She has hosted 14 roundtables, bringing top notch speakers to her audience to chat about hot button topics These events may be free to attend, but these leads have gone on to generate $884K in sales for her business! Want to hear how she made this happen? Give this case study a listen here: https://lnkd.in/gQJiJNqi"
