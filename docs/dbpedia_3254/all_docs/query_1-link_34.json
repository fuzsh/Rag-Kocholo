        "text": "DULUTH, Ga. — The Atlanta Gladiators scored three times in short order in the second period, and ran that momentum swing the rest of the way in a 4-1 victory over the Greenville Swamp Rabbits at the Infinite Energy Arena on Friday night.The three goals came within just over six minutes of time in the second period, and special teams proved costly for Greenville. First, it started with a power play goal from Olivier Galipeau, his second power play tally of the season. It was followed up by Justin MacDonald on a fantastic individual effort while shorthanded, who broke away and scored on a second chance opportunity, and Jesse Gabrielle was the recipient of a pass from veteran Derek Nesbitt to extend the lead to 3-0 at even strength.Branden Troock, former Swamp Rabbit, added an insurance goal for Atlanta. His first goal of the season came at the 12 minute mark of the third, as on a 2-on-1 break, his snap shot beat Garrett Bartus and extended Atlanta's lead to 4-1.The Swamp Rabbits found fire early in the third period. Chris Izmirlian sent rookie Dylan Vander Esch on his way into the offensive zone, and his high rising shot found a way off the crossbar, straight down and in for the Swamp Rabbits' lone tally. It was Vander Esch's first ECHL goal. Will Merchant also picked up an assist on the play at the 5:34 mark of the third.Bartus was routinely great to keep the puck out on multiple opportunities. On several chances, Troock was turned aside, and early in the game, Zach Magwood, in his ECHL debut, forced a steal and fed Carl Persson down low, whose opportunity was stonewalled by Bartus early in the first period. He made 32 saves in the effort.While shaky early, Miroslav Svoboda turned aside 23 of 24 chances fired his way for his second win in as many starts for the Gladiators.Greenville's power play was given ample opportunity, but was unable to connect on six opportunities. Atlanta buried the biscuit on one of three.The Swamp Rabbits remain on the road to take on the South Carolina Stingrays on Saturday, October 20 at 7:05 p.m. Catch all of the action on the Swamp Rabbits Broadcast Network (mixlr.com/swamp-rabbits).
