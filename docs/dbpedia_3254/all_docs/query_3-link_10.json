But that doesn’t mean he’s seen as the Oilers goalie of the future, or even as a strong bet to make the team as a back-up.\n\nSkinner’s up-and-down minor pro career has been mirrored by the Oilers’ up-and-down commitment to the young goalie, at least if you go by the endless number of competitors who have been brought in over the years to challenge Skinner, from a host of drafted goalies from 2014 to 2019 to minor pro goalies Anton Forsberg and Troy Grosenick just this past year.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nPerhaps if Skinner can put together two super solid seasons in a row the Oilers organization will lock in more firmly on him as an heir apparent for starting goalie Mike Smith, but that kind of consistency has generally eluded Skinner, both in-season and between seasons.\n\nIn 2016-17, his draft year, he was just OK for Lethbridge during the regular season, then was much stronger in the playoffs. The same happened in 2017-18, when he made up for an iffy first half to the regular season with a great playoff run that took his Swift Current team to the Memorial Cup.\n\nIn 2018-19 and 2019-20, he struggled both at the ECHL and AHL levels, revving us doubts that he would ever turn the corner as a pro. But, at last, in 2020-21, Skinner cranked it up at the AHL level, winning 20 games and losing just ten for Bakersfield with a crackling .914 save percentage, one of the best in the entire league. He then went on to lead the Bake to the divisional championship in the playoffs.\n\nSkinner was one of seven goalies that Edmonton drafted in the six drafts from 2014 to 2019, starting with Zack Nabelvoort and Keven Bouchard in 2014 (both now out of pro hockey), Miroslav Svoboda in 2015 (he’s a solid goalie in the Czech league), Dylan Wells in 2016 (he’s a struggling minor pro, now out of the Oilers organization), Skinner in 2017, Olivier Rodrigue in 2018 and Ilya Konovalov in 2019, with both Rodrigue and Konovalov now challenging Skinner for playing time at the AHL level.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nRodrigue was a second round pick, Konovalov a third-rounder, so Edmonton has made a serious investments in both of them. Either could surpass Skinner on the depth chart as early as this season.\n\nAlong the way, Skinner has also held off challenges from college free agents Hayden Hawkey and Shane Starrett at the AHL level, with the Oilers also bringing in Troy Grosenick, Anton Forsberg and Alex Stalock last year as goalie depth, presumably because the organization felt Skinner wasn’t yet ready for prime time.\n\nWhen Mike Smith got injured earlier this year and Mikko Koskinen got over-used, Skinner got his first and only NHL start in an 8-5 win over the Ottawa Senators. My Cult of Hockey colleague Bruce McCurdy graded his game as five out of ten. Wrote McCurdy: “Made his NHL debut and earns a mandatory +1 from this reviewer for that feat alone. Got the main part of the job done by earning the win. Predictably nervous in the early going (still don’t get why Dave Tippett didn’t give him a look in garbage time vs. the Habs in Game 3), losing his net altogether on the first goal, even as it appeared to have been rapped home by a high stick. A few rough edges with positioning, playing the angles, puckhandling etc. But showed his raw ability and long-term promise with a number of excellent saves, especially during the second period when he stopped a dozen shots as the Oilers extended their lead from 5-3 to 8-3 to essentially put the game on ice. 38 shots, 33 saves, .868 save percentage.”\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBut Skinner’s real breakthrough came in Bakersfield, where he won the starting job and held it with strong performances all the way to a playoff quasi-championship. He’s got more year of AHL eligibility before the Oilers must make a decision on him. If the big goalie shines, he could be Smith’s back-up in Edmonton in 2021-22. Edmonton will be desperate for value contracts by then, and with Skinner’s $750,000 salary that year, he would certainly hit that mark.\n\nExpectation for 2020-21: He hold on to the top job in Bakersfield, play the majority of the games and play at the same high level as he attained last year, if not higher.\n\nPreviously in this series\n\nArticle content\n\nShare this article in your social network\n\nLatest National Stories"
