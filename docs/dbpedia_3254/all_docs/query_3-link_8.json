Back to video\n\nAs in previous years, our criteria for inclusion is that a player must be Oilers’ property (so, for example, AHL signing Josh Currie would not count) and eligible for the Calder Trophy. The Calder criteria means that some prospects who are considered on other lists will be discounted due games played (Griffin Reinhart, for example, is no longer eligible). Age is also a factor most years, though this summer there aren’t any players under contract who are under the games played minimum but over the age threshold.\n\nAdvertisement 2\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nTHIS CONTENT IS RESERVED FOR SUBSCRIBERS ONLY\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nSUBSCRIBE TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nSubscribe now to read the latest news in your city and across Canada.\n\nExclusive articles by David Staples, Keith Gerein and others, Oilers news from Cult of Hockey, Ask EJ Anything features, the Noon News Roundup and Under the Dome newsletters.\n\nUnlimited online access to Edmonton Journal and 15 news sites with one account.\n\nEdmonton Journal ePaper, an electronic replica of the print edition to view on any device, share and comment on.\n\nDaily puzzles, including the New York Times Crossword.\n\nSupport local journalism.\n\nREGISTER / SIGN IN TO UNLOCK MORE ARTICLES\n\nCreate an account or sign in to continue with your reading experience.\n\nAccess articles from across Canada with one account.\n\nShare your thoughts and join the conversation in the comments.\n\nEnjoy additional articles per month.\n\nGet email updates from your favourite authors.\n\nSign In or Create an Account\n\nEmail Address\n\nor\n\nArticle content\n\nUsing that criteria, David Staples, Bruce McCurdy and I each voted on the pool of 36 players who qualified for inclusion. The top 25 players on our list will each get their own write-ups, but in this introductory post we’ll take a quick look at the players below that threshold. They are as follow:\n\n26. RW Greg Chase (2015 rank: No. 7 overall). A year ago, the expectation was that Chase would establish himself as an AHL regular in his rookie year, with colleague McCurdy setting 60-odd games and 20-ish points as a line in the sand. Chase scored at almost exactly that pace but appeared in only 19 games, spending the bulk of the season in the ECHL. Expectations for 2016-17: 30 points and a full season in the AHL.\n\n27. G Dylan Wells (N/A; drafted 123rd overall in 2016). Wells has NHL size, with a 6’2” frame, but his save percentage trended the wrong way in the OHL last year, falling down to 0.871. One would assume that he’s at least five years away from challenging for NHL employment even if everything goes exceedingly well. Expectations: At least 40 games and an improved save percentage.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n28. LW Graham McPhee (N/A; drafted 149th overall in 2016). The son of new Las Vegas general manager George McPhee, Graham McPhee spent last year in the U.S. national development program, and is going to go the college route. He’s undersized but competitive, and projects as a bottom-six forward. Expectations: Win a regular job at the college level.\n\n29. LW Mitch Moroz (2015 rank: No. 23 overall). A year ago, I suggested that Moroz needed to at least double the nine points he’d managed as a rookie pro if he wanted to stay in the Oilers plans. Instead he gained one point, climbing to 10 in an injury-shortened 40 game season. He’s entering the final year of his entry-level contract and needs a breakout performance if he wants another NHL deal. Expectations for 2016-17: At least 25 points over a healthy campaign.\n\n30. RW Tyler Vesel (2015 rank: No. 26 overall). Vesel is an undersized offensive forward, and the offence didn’t develop last season. He went from eight goals and 23 points as a 20-year-old college freshman to six goals and 18 points as a sophomore. He has time but needs to show more scoring over the next two years to get an entry-level deal. Expectations for 2016-17: 30 points would be a good step forward.\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n31. LW Braden Christoffer (N/A; signed with Bakersfield in May 2015). Christoffer so impressed in training camp that the Oilers gave the Sherwood Park native an entry-level contract. Unfortunately, he didn’t make the most of things in his first year with the team, scoring just five points in 33 AHL games and earning a long (and largely successful) stint in the ECHL. Expectations for 2016-17: Spend the entire year in the AHL.\n\n32. LW Evan Campbell (2015 rank: No. 27 overall). After a breakthrough performance at the college level in which Campbell came close to the point-per-game mark, 2015-16 represented a massive disappointment. He fell to 11th in team scoring, with his both his goal and assist totals cut in half. As a result, rather than climbing into the top-25, he fell five spots in our rankings. The only good news for Campbell is that Edmonton doesn’t make its signing decision until the end of next season. Expectations for 2016-17: Score at a point-per-game pace.\n\n33. RD Vincent Desharnais (N/A; drafted 183rd overall in 2016). An overage selection who went unselected in 2014 and 2015, Desharnais has two significant items in his favour: He’s a right shot and he’s 6’6”. He only played 19 games for Providence College last season, and the year before scored only five points in 54 BCHL games. Expectations for 2016-17: Play a full season at the college level.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\n34. LW Aidan Muir (2015 rank: No. 29 overall). Muir was projectable, because what NHL team doesn’t want a 6’4” winger that can skate? The problem is that there’s no sign yet that he can score. We were hoping to see 0.5 points/game as a college freshman, but as a sophomore last year he couldn’t manage even half that and scored only two goals all season. Expectations for 2016-17: Can he crack 0.5 points/game in his third try?\n\n35. G Miroslav Svoboda (2015 rank: No. 31 overall). Svoboda is improving, just not quickly enough. He played 29 games in the second-tier Czech league last season, and managed a 0.924 save percentage for HC Sumperk. That he’s now 21 years old and appears bound for another season outside of the Czech Republic’s top league is really not a great sign, though. Expectations for 2016-17: Push his way out of the second tier.\n\n36. G Zach Nagelvoort (2015 rank: No. 30 overall). Nagelvoort has played three seasons at the University of Michigan now. His games played over those seasons were 24, 22 and 11 respectively. His save percentage over the same span went from 0.929 to 0.906 to 0.893. He’s in freefall as a prospect and has clearly been passed by the undrafted Steven Racine. Expectations for 2016-17: If he doesn’t excel in the starting role, it’s hard to imagine he’s signed to an entry-level deal.\n\nThat’s 11 different players. The question now is which of them has the best shot at an NHL career?\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nI opted for Chase, ranking him well inside the top 25.
