        "text": "In the final Canadian NHL team prospect ranking, the series arrives in Edmonton, to rank each of the 23 eligible prospects who remain property of the Oilers.\n\nThe Oilers’ pool of prospects presents an interesting dichotomy. The first thing you’ll notice is that it’s tied with the Flames for the fewest number of prospects. The second thing you’ll notice is that its depth drops off considerably after the top four. Both of these things are driven by losing so many young players to the NHL (Connor McDavid, Leon Draisaitl, Darnell Nurse), an undeniable positive. Still, part of the problem is a product of trading away picks. (In 2017, the Oilers didn’t have a second-round pick. In 2015 and 2014, they didn’t have a second or a third rounder in either class.)\n\nJesse Puljujarvi was on the fringe of qualifying for the criteria in this ranking, but in order to remain consistent — and given that he’s currently in the NHL — he was excluded.\n\nHere’s a look at where every single one of the prospects they do have stand and what they might offer down the line.\n\nNote: As always, I have arbitrarily set the age cut off at 22 and under. Data suggests that by the time a player turns 23, he is more or less done developing along his aging curve. Others, who are under 23 but aren’t signed to NHL deals or were drafted by the team but whose rights expired, are also omitted. That excludes former draft picks such as Miroslav Svoboda and Ziyat Paigin. That also means AHL players such as Nick Ellis, Dave Gust and Dillon Simpson won’t be included. Full-time under-23 players in the NHL are also excluded. As a result, the likes of McDavid, Draisaitl, Nurse, Laurent Brossoit and Puljujarvi will not be ranked (it almost seems funny to think the former three could be).\n\nFor additional information on many of the prospects on this list, check out Lowetide’s Winter top-20 ranking from November, which used different criteria and included players like Brossoit, Simpson, Puljujarvi and Jujhar Khaira.\n\nThe Lists: Toronto Maple Leafs | Vancouver Canucks | Montreal Canadiens| Winnipeg Jets | Ottawa Senators | Calgary Flames | Edmonton Oilers\n\n1. Kailer Yamamoto, RW, 19 (Spokane Chiefs)\n\nI’ll be honest, Yamamoto hasn’t had a great year. After looking capable but a little out of place with the Oilers to start the season, Yamamoto hasn’t been the terror I expected him to be in the WHL — or at the world juniors. In many ways, a lot has stayed the same: Yamamoto’s deft stick-handling, lateral quickness and cross-ice vision are all extremely high-end. Where Yamamoto has disappointed this season, is in the way he has forced his will on opposing teams as a scoring threat. He can make plays and be a creator from the perimeter in junior all he wants and still find success but he needs to attack the front of the net in the same way he did all of last season on route to 42 goals (he has just three in 15 games this year). His 2.33 shots per game has taken a major hit from last and his 0.73 primary points per game places him 55th in the WHL among players who’ve played as many or more than his 15 games. I’ve long been a huge proponent of Yamamoto’s game and still believe he’ll be a second-line winger in the NHL who can play on PP1, but he needs to get going again.\n\n2. Ethan Bear, 20, D (Bakersfield Condors)\n\nLike Yamamoto, Bear needs to be more engaged as a shooter in the AHL than he has been as a rookie (his 31 shots in 21 games places him outside of the top-100 AHL defencemen with more than 10 GP this year on a per game basis). Throughout his junior career, Bear was among the WHL’s best scoring threats from the back end (last year, he finished second in the WHL in goals with 28). With time, he should develop the confidence to attack the high slot or the backdoor from the point more consistently. Still, Bear has been solid in his first year with the Condors and has the ability to positively drive play and possession. His playoffs with Seattle last year were historic and his back-to-back First All-Star Team nods weren’t a fluke either. He’s going to be an NHL defenceman, it’s just a matter of when.\n\n3. Caleb Jones, 20, D (Bakersfield Condors)\n\nJones has struggled to adjust defensively in the AHL and it has been evidenced in some poor results at 5-on-5, but he has the tools to work out those kinks and position himself for a chance at the next level. It may take him some more time than Bear, or even Mantha, but Jones is smart enough with the puck and athletic enough without it that he should blossom once he becomes more assertive with Bakersfield. Because he’s a decent handler, a heads up carrier, and a plus-passer, there’s considerable room for the rest of his game to play catch up. He’ll be fine.\n\n4. Tyler Benson, LW, 19 (Vancouver Giants)\n\nHis health hasn’t done his progression any favours and Benson now looks more like a player who’s going to need to marinate in the AHL after this season is wrapped up, but I still believe there’s enough in his game that he may still become a decent middle-six NHL forward in time. He sits 17th among under-20 WHL players in points per game (1.3) and he has done it while playing on a team that until the last month was playing poor hockey — and he’s not relying too heavily on his linemates to produce. He’s still not going to be the prospect many once believed he’d be after setting records during his minor hockey career that led to him going first overall in the WHL’s Bantam draft, but he’s shifty and strong on his skates, which should help his game translate to the pros.\n\n5. Filip Berglund, D, 20 (Skelleftea AIK)\n\nDespite having played nearly 10 fewer games than most of his peers in the SHL, Berglund is seventh among all under-24 defencemen with eight points in 28 games. He was so dominant in SuperElit in his draft year that his success at a young age professionally shouldn’t come as a surprise. He’s uniquely skilled for a player of his size and his solid defensive play has been rewarded with 16:31 in average ice time this season, including more than that in three straight games on the team’s second pairing. There is a lot in Berglund’s game that coaches quickly fall in love with and it should translate well in North America should he decide to make the jump.\n\n6. Kirill Maksimov, RW, 18 (Niagara IceDogs)\n\nHere’s the thing about players who rely on their size to be effective in junior hockey: Often, their points are secondary assist heavy because they aren’t great creators. Here’s the thing about Kirill Maksimov: He’s not like those players. Maksimov, while very much still more of a scoring threat than a creator for his linemates, does an admirable job making plays when his shot isn’t available. And that bodes well for his progression moving forward. This season, 36 of his 43 points in the OHL are primary. That 1.0 primary points per game pace ranks 16th and places him ahead of the likes of Jonah Gadjovich, Jonathan Ang, Adam Ruzicka and Dmitri Sokolov, other players who play a linear north-south game. In time, he might have a real shot.\n\n7. Ryan Mantha, D, 21 (Bakersfield Condors)\n\nRyan Mantha is the best-kept secret in the Oilers organization. Don’t let his low offensive production fool you. If Jones and Bear are still a touch hesitant in their rookie seasons, Mantha is their antithesis. Not only is he already the team’s best shot generator but he’s also driving possession as a rookie, showing hugely positive results at even-strength, and performing whenever he’s given significant minutes. Mantha is a 6-foot-5 defenceman who can play and he’s got the tools to become a good third-pairing option in the NHL. The Oilers need to make sure he doesn’t get lost in the shuffle with the two 20-year-olds.\n\n8. Dmitri Samorukov, D, 18 (Guelph Storm)\n\nSamorukov is another defencemen who’s owed more love. He still has room to grow into a decent frame and he has taken huge steps forward as an 18-year-old on a dreadful defensive team. He’s worth keeping an eye on and I still think he’s nowhere near where he’ll get to in the next year or two. His numbers this year are particularly intriguing because he’s third in line for power play minutes in Guelph behind McFadden and Merkley, who rely on the man-advantage to produce to a much larger degree. Only 12 of McFadden’s 33 points (36 per cent) and 22 of Merkley’s 50 (44 per cent) have come at 5-on-5, versus 14 of Samorukov’s 20 (70 per cent).\n\n9. Aapeli Rasanen, C, 19 (Boston College)\n\nIt has been a good year for Rasanen. He has played a significant role as a freshman with BC (rare in NCAA hockey these days) and stepped away from school to lead Finland in scoring (four goals in five games) at the world juniors. He’s a reliable two-way centre who has four years to iron out some kinks in his game offensively. By the time he wraps up his collegiate career, I wouldn’t be surprised if Rasanen is a star at BC and the team’s No. 1 centre.\n\n10. Ostap Safin, LW/RW, 18 (Saint John Sea Dogs)\n\nIn the absence of Joe Veleno after his trade, Safin is Saint John’s go-to offensive weapon. It can be hard, with players as big and physical as Safin is, to identify how much of their junior hockey success is reliant on that size advantage over teenagers, but I’m confident in his ability as a shooter and give-and-go handler with the right centre. At 6-foot-5, he’s also a well-above-average skater for his size and he has proven to be effective without much help as a first-year player in the QMJHL.\n\n11. John Marino, D, 20 (Harvard University)\n\nMarino played a big role in all situations as a freshman at Harvard last year and was the youngest player on the All-Ivy League Second Team as a result. His start this year hasn’t been what you would have hoped out of a player who played as well as Marino did last season, and he hasn’t taken any major steps forward, but I still like what he has and he has time to become a more dominant offensive threat — he’s already a great defender.\n\n12. Graham McPhee, LW, 19 (Boston College)\n\nMcPhee, Rasanen’s new teammate, doesn’t have the defensive awareness of his sometimes linemate — or the longterm offensive upside — but he has managed to find out what he’s best at (driving the net off the wall) and master it. A wiry project, McPhee has come a long way since arriving at BC last season. I still have my doubts about his upside but I’m intrigued by how fast he has progressed and the next two and a half years will be interesting for him.\n\n13. William Lagesson, D, 21 (Djurgardens IF)\n\nLagesson was good in his draft year. He played well at U17s, he thrived in SuperElit and there was reason to believe he could build on some raw tools, including a heavy shot. That didn’t manifest itself in Division I hockey. Thankfully, he has already become a reliable defender and successful penalty killer in his first season in the SHL, which bodes well for his odds of transitioning into a depth role in North America if he ever decides to come back. Even as his offensive tools have stagnated, he has continued to become a more reliable defender. That’s a positive, at the very least.\n\n14. Cameron Hebig, C, 20 (Regina Pats)\n\nIn a prospect pool bereft of centre depth, Hebig offers a glimmer of hope. In his final year in the WHL, he’s expected to be a scoring threat, but he has developed into one of the better pure goal scorers in the league (seventh in goals per game). He could luck into a pretty significant role next year with the Condors and he should be able to handle it if he’s properly utilized (he may need to be sheltered early on, I don’t love his play away from the puck).\n\n15. Dylan Wells, G, 20 (Peterborough Petes)\n\nThere’s a lot about Wells’ game to like: his size, his athleticism, that he has been given a chance to play a lot. But there are enough flaws in his technique (he gets beat blocker high a lot, he gives up a ton of rebounds) to question whether he’s going to be able to become more than a low-level pro goalie. After a strong post-draft season last year he has taken a step back and hasn’t been able to find a consistent groove behind a Petes team that gives up a lot of quality chances. There’s more to him than this year’s numbers would suggest but that still probably isn’t enough.\n\n16. Stuart Skinner, G, 19 (Swift Current Broncos)\n\nSkinner is huge. In today’s NHL, with the right goalie coach, that mean’s anything is possible. He was great in last year’s playoffs and has shown in spurts that he can be the kind of goalie Lethbridge hoped he be when they took him in the first round. After a trade to Swift Current, he was named the WHL’s goaltender of the week in his first with his new team, stopping 49 of 50 shots in his first two starts (.980 SV%). After a rough start with the Hurricanes, that’s good news.\n\n17. Matthew Cairns, D, 19 (Cornell University)\n\nI like Cairns’ game. For a big defender, he moves well and plays with poise and maturity. Did the Oilers reach when they took him in the third round? Yes. Is he a project who will need time to find his footing at Cornell? Yes. But he’s a heads-up passer whose game should take off once he finally gets settled in the NCAA.\n\n18. Philip Kemp, D, 18 (Yale University)\n\nKemp does a lot of things really well defensively but I just don’t see enough in his game with the puck to believe even four years at Yale can cure those kinks. Maybe he’ll prove me wrong — he really is an excellent, aware defender along the wall and off the rush.\n\n19. Kyle Platzer, RW/C, 22 (Bakersfield Condors/Wichita Thunder)\n\nPlatzer is at his best in offensive, sheltered minutes. When given power play time and consistent top-six minutes at even strength in the ECHL, he has proven he can be a dominant threat. In the AHL, he hasn’t been given that chance and it has been reflected in his struggles away from the puck in an attempted checking role. Still, I think he could play a scoring role effectively in the AHL — he just won’t progress beyond that. He has more to give, though.\n\n20. Markus Niemelainen, D, 19 (HPK)\n\nNiemelainen’s a big kid who can fly — at least relative to his 6-foot-6 frame — but he’s not talented enough as a handler, shooter or carrier to become an NHL defender and his time on an awful Saginaw team’s power play in his draft year skewed perceptions of just how talented he was with the puck. Live and learn.\n\n21. Skyler Brind’Amour, C, 18 (Chilliwack Chiefs)\n\nThe Oilers took a risk on an athletic kid who didn’t play a ton of hockey last season and it’s likely to burn them. Brind’Amour wasn’t on my draft board and hasn’t grabbed hold of the BCHL as a 19-year-old rookie this season, either. The Oilers can afford to wait for him (he’s the youngest prospect in the system) to spend four years at Michigan State but I wouldn’t recommend they hold their breath.\n\n22. Vincent Desharnais, D, 21 (Providence College)\n\nThere’s a theme here with big defencemen the Oilers took a chance on who aren’t likely to pan out, but Desharnais is that list’s kingpin. Luckily, it was only a seventh-round pick, but Desharnais is what he is and it’s pretty mediocre. I anticipate the Oilers will allow his rights to expire after he graduates.\n\n23. Aidan Muir, LW/RW, 22 (Western Michigan University)\n\nAfter two solids seasons after his draft year, one in the USHL and the other as a freshman at Western Michigan, Muir hasn’t become more than a depth forward with size in the NCAA. Now in his last season, this is probably the end of his road.\n\n===\n\nI have also broken down the ranking into tiers, in the same way my draft rankings are divided into tiers, in order to provide more context on their potential fluidity.\n\nThe tiers denote players who are tightly grouped. Ranking one player a couple of spots lower than another doesn’t always mean there’s a huge gap in their potential future development, or in their ceiling. By popular demand, I have also added where the player was drafted and/or how they were acquired.\n\nVisual by Dom Luszczyszyn.\n\nStay tuned for a detailed, comparative ranking of the Canadian teams’ prospect pools to wrap up this series and look ahead to where all seven teams are going.\n\n(Top photo: Sergei Belski/USA TODAY Sports)"
