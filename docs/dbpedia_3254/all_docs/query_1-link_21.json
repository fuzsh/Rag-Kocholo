        "text": "Goalie Stick Sizing Information\n\nUnlike other pieces of gear, Goalie Sticks are sized mostly to the goaltender’s preference and playing style rather than their height. The most important measurement, when purchasing a new goal stick, is the paddle height (the wide portion of the stick), which is usually taken from the heel of the stick to the shaft/paddle interface. The reason for the paddle height’s significance is because it sets up the goaltender’s depth in the ready stance and (if properly sized) positions the blocker in an optimal position.\n\nSizing Your Goalie Stick\n\nTo start analyzing the size of your goalie stick, put on your goalie skates to get an accurate height of where you will be in your stance. If you’re looking to be even more accurate, strap on your goalie pads and blocker as well. Once that is done, get comfortable in your natural stance (the one you’d be in during a majority of gameplay) and look for the following:\n\n1. The entire blade of the stick is flush with the ground while being 1’ - 2’ in front of your feet\n\n2. After getting your stick into the flush position, check that the inside edge of the blocker hand sits on the outside edge of the goal pad (this is while holding just above the paddle)."
