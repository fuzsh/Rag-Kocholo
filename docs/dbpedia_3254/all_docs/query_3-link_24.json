        "text": "PRE-DRAFT AWARDS AND HONORS\n\nMiscellaneous: Was eligible for the draft at age 21 because NHL had ruled that all Europeans, regardless of age, would have to enter the league through the entry draft, rather than as unrestricted free agents. ... Defected from Czechoslovakia to West Germany after the 1981-82 season and stayed out of German competition for required 18 months in accordance with IIHF rules, which were intended to limit the likelihood that Czech players would defect to nearby Germany. He became eligible to play in January 1984, when he joined Bayreuth. Post-Draft Teams: Baltimore, Springfield (AHL); Rosenheim, Schwenningen, Landshut (West Germany/Germany); Mannheim, Nuremberg, Hassfurt (Germany)NON-NHL AWARDS AND HONORS\n\nMiscellaneous: Drafted by North Stars because he was praised by former Minnesota goalie Jiri Crha, who told the team's scouting staff he felt Maly was an underrated player due to limited exposure. ... Signed three-year contract with Minnesota on Aug. 3, 1984. He joined fellow Czech player Jiri Poner in becoming the first two Czech draft picks ever signed by the North Stars and the first two European draft picks ever signed by longtime Minnesota general manager Lou Nanne. ... Left North America after one season to return to West Germany and resume his career there. ... Went to work for Czech Ice Hockey Federation in Prague after his retirement.\n\nPersonal: Nicknamed \"Mirek.\" ... Also known as Mirek Maly during his playing days."
