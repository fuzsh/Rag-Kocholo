        "text": "Reliability of specific on-ice repeated-sprint ability test for ice-hockey players\n\nKarel Hůlka, Jan Bělka, Roman Cuberek, Ondřej Schneider\n\nActa Gymnica 2014 44(2): 69-75 | DOI: 10.5507/ag.2014.007\n\nBackground: Repeated sprint ability tests are today widely used to evaluate the performance capability in team sports. Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the reliability of a specific ice hockey test, which indicates the agility and repeated-sprint ability of the players. Methods: Twenty four highly trained junior ice hockey players (age = 17.68 ± 1.52 years; BMI = 23.8 ± 1.92 kg . m-2) participated in the study. Each participant was assessed for specific on-ice repeated-sprint ability test 12 × 54 m with 30 s rest. Intraclass...\n\nSelf-perceptions of decision making competence in Spanish football players\n\nLuis Miguel Ruiz Pérez, Miriam Palomo Nieto, Virginia García Coll, José Antonio Navia Manzano, Javier Miñano Espín, Rudolf Psotta\n\nActa Gymnica 2014 44(2): 77-83 | DOI: 10.5507/ag.2014.008\n\nBackground: It is known that competence to make decisions is a fundamental aspect of sport competition. Objective:This study has analyzed the decision profile of a sample of Spanish football players of different levels of expertise. Methods: 690 Spanish football players of national and international level completed the decision making questionnaire, which cover three dimensions - perceived decision competence, decision anxiety and commitment with decision learning. MANCOVA and ANOVA analysis were carried out to analyse the differences in each dimension based on the level of expertise. Results: Results showed that perception of decision making competence...\n\nKinematic analysis of the gait in professional ballet dancers\n\nLucie Teplá, Markéta Procházková, Zdeněk Svoboda, Miroslav Janura\n\nActa Gymnica 2014 44(2): 85-91 | DOI: 10.5507/ag.2014.009\n\nBackground: A ballet dance routine places extreme functional demands on the musculoskeletal system and affects the motor behaviour of the dancers. An extreme ballet position places high stress on many segments of the dancer's body and can significantly influence the mobility of the lower limb joints. Objective: The aim of this study was to observe the differences in the gait pattern between ballet dancers and non-dancers. Methods:Thirteen professional ballet dancers (5 males, 8 females; age 24.1 ± 3.8 years; height 170.2 ± 8.5 cm; weight 58.3 ± 11.2 kg) participated in this...\n\nAnalysis of foreign physical activity recommendations and guidelines for schools\n\nJan Pavelka, Erik Sigmund, Zdeněk Hamřík, Michal Kalman\n\nActa Gymnica 2014 44(2): 93-105 | DOI: 10.5507/ag.2014.010\n\nBackground:An adequate level of physical activity is an important part of children's lifestyle. The school environment plays a significant role in the area of interventions and strategies aiming to increase the level of physical activity in children. Objectives: The aim of this study is to analyse foreign recommendations leading to an increased level of physical activity in children and young people in Czech schools. Methods: A systematic search of studies published between 1988 and 2012 in the English language was completed in library databases Medline, Sport Discus, ProQuest, PsychInfo, ERIC, Wiley InterScience using the following keywords: physical...\n\nThe effect of intake of water on the final values of body composition parameters in active athletes using two different bioimpedance analyzers\n\nPetr Kutáč\n\nActa Gymnica 2014 44(2): 107-116 | DOI: 10.5507/ag.2014.011\n\nBackground:The method of bioelectrical impedance (BIA) is frequently used to estimate body composition in sports. The total body water (TBW) is the basic variable that BIA measures. That implies the degree of sensitivity of BIA to the hydration of the organism, which is also demonstrated by the principles of measurement that primarily relate to the hydration of the organism. It is difficult to provide standard hydration of the organism of subjects prior to measurements when taking the measurements in the field. Objective:The objective of the study is to assess the changes in the final values of the selected body composition parameters in soccer players...\n\nPhenomenology is not Phenomenalism. Is there such a thing as phenomenology of sport?\n\nJan Halák, Ivo Jirásek, Mark Stephen Nesti\n\nActa Gymnica 2014 44(2): 117-129 | DOI: 10.5507/ag.2014.012\n\nBackground: The application of the philosophical mode of investigation called \"phenomenology\" in the context of sport. Objective: The goal is to show how and why the phenomenological method is very often misused in sport-related research. Methods: Interpretation of the key texts, explanation of their meaning. Results: The confrontation of concrete sport-related texts with the original meaning of the key phenomenological notions shows mainly three types of misuse - the confusion of phenomenology with immediacy, with an epistemologically subjectivist stance (phenomenalism), and with empirical research oriented towards objects in the world.
