After attending to the important detail of drafting Connor McDavid first overall, Chiarelli traded two draft picks to acquire Griffin Reinhart in what turned out to be a disastrous attempt to accelerate the process; three more to nab netminder Cam Talbot; another to bring on veteran banger Eric Gryba; and yet another to secure the rights to coach Todd McLellan. Chiarelli and company then spent the bottom half of the draft selecting four more defenders (Caleb Jones, Ethan Bear, John Marino, Ziyat Paigin) and one goalie (Miroslav Svoboda), along with zero forwards beyond the wondrous McDavid.\n\nWe apologize, but this video has failed to load.\n\nTry refreshing your browser, or\n\ntap here to see other videos from our team.\n\nAfter a second season ruined by injury, might Edmonton Oilers be prepared to move on from Andrej Sekera?

Sekera’s 6-year, $33 million pact was in fact the biggest signed by any UFA that summer, and lent instant credibility to the fast rebuild. Sekera was a cut above previous free agent signees like Andrew Ference and Mark Fayne, and a pay grade above them as well. The day he signed he became the Oilers’ #1 defenceman.\n\n“Rej” was on a bit of an island in 2015-16, especially after promising Oscar Klefbom was lost for the season in early December. Sekera spent time with toolsy rookie Darnell Nurse, while the rest of the D was manned by the likes of Fayne, Ference, Gryba and the ghost of Justin Schultz. Sekera had a decent season with 30 points, but the Oilers struggled mightily.\n\nThat all changed in 2016-17, when Chiarelli added two more pieces to join Sekera and Klefbom in the top four in the form of trade acquisition Adam Larsson and late free agent signing Kris Russell. College free agent Matt Benning joined Nurse on the third pairing while Gryba filled in around the edges. The division of player roles at even strength can be seen in average ice time, and is further refined by the brilliant PuckIQ.com:\n\nAdvertisement 3\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThe top four as shown not only had comfortably the most ice time, but all saw equally heavy amounts of Elite competition as defined by PuckIQ. Sekera saw about one minute less per game than the other three at 5v5, but was the only d-man on the club to average over 2 minutes on each special team and was also a go-to player in 3v3 overtime. He responded with his best campaign as an Oiler, scoring 8-27-35, +14 and looking every bit the $5.5 million, #1 defenceman. In his nearly 22 hours of 5v5 play, mostly paired with fellow crafty vet Kris Russell, Edmonton scored 49 goals and allowed just 36. That included a 16-10 margin in nearly 8 hours vs. Elite competition.\n\nAlas his season came to a crashing halt in the playoffs when he was felled by a Ryan Getzlaf hit and suffered a torn ACL, a crushing blow for both team and player that had severe repercussions into the next season and beyond. Sekera didn’t see the ice until nearly mid-season, and was a shadow of his former self. Todd McLellan did his level best to shelter the veteran:\n\nSame seven rearguards, but Sekera played third pairing minutes and faced by far the weakest competition. He still got absolutely crushed, scoring just 0-8-8 on the season with a ghastly -15 in limited minutes. At 5v5 with Sekera on the ice, the Oilers scored 7 goals and allowed 27. Make that +1/-7 in just 95 minutes of action vs. Elites.\n\nArticle content\n\nAdvertisement 4\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nBy year’s end Sekera was skating a little less gingerly, and put in a decent showing for Slovakia at the World Championships. But then catastrophic injury befell him a second time in August when he injured his Achilles tendon in training. Instead of being ready for training camp with better legs and no pesky knee brace, he was nowhere to be found until February. After a five-game conditioning stint in Bakersfield, Sekera was parachuted back into the Oilers line-up in a third-pairing role, where he played the season’s last 24 games with low-event boxcars of 0-4-4, +3. But for a second consecutive year he was heavily sheltered:\n\nWhat does that 18% mean, exactly? Well, in Calgary rookies Juuso Valimaki (19%), Rasmus Andersson (17%) and Oliver Kylington (14%) have it surrounded, while well-paid top four types Mark Giordano (42%), T.J. Brodie (42%), Travis Hamonic (34%) and Noah Hanifin (33%) consumed a steady diet of the toughs. In San Jose the top five for tough minutes were the big five of Vlasic-Braun-Dillon oh yeah Karlsson-Burns, with little used #6 defenders Radim Simek, Joakim Ryan, and Tim Heed all trailing but still in the 24-28% range. In Vegas only Nick Holden (22%) and Jon Merrill (19%) were in Sekera’s area code.\n\nAdvertisement 5\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nThat’s just the three playoff teams from the Pacific Division, but you get the idea. Even among third-pairing D who by definition see softer minutes, Sekera was extra-sheltered. In 24 games, he played barely 60 minutes against the opposition’s best.\n\nWhat does this tell us? First thing it tells me is that these fellows over at PuckIQ are really on to something in the ongoing struggle to properly measure the ever-tricky Quality of Competition. Sekera and his delicate situation aside, most of these rearguards are slotted exactly where you’d expect a smart coach to slot them, not just in terms of ice time but also in limiting their ice time against dangerous foes.\n\nAlas, one of the harsh realities of the cap era is that players in Sekera’s price range play the most impactful minutes rather than filling in the cracks between them. The three Calgary guys mentioned were rookies on their ELC; the three San Jose guys all came in below $700,000 for goodness sake. Only Vegas’ Holden ($2.2 million) and Merrill ($1.375) are even in the seven-figure range. All pale in comparison to Sekera’s $5,500,000, which remains by some margin the highest cap hit of any Oilers defender. The injuries are not “his fault”, obviously, but they have absolutely tanked his value two years running.\n\nAdvertisement 6\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nOf course the argument can be made that neither season comes close to indicating Sekera’s true value, not just in the many games he missed but even in those he played after returning. Also undeniable is that his on-ice performance was far, far better in the season just completed than the disastrous one that preceded it. With his top four already set and healthy, Ken Hitchcock put the veteran in a position to succeed, and both he (on ice for 14 GF, 15 GA at 5v5) and the team (11-9-4 during his time) at least held their own. Sekera stabilized the third pairing in a manner that stopgaps like Brandon Manning, Alexander Petrovic and several others were unable to do. But oh, that cap hit.\n\nSo what now? Three possible scenarios:\n\nThe Oilers stick with their veteran in hopes that his season-ending cameo was a dress rehearsal for a bigger role next season, one more commensurate with both his cap hit and with his previously established history of being a top end defenceman.\n\nThey look to move him in a trade. On July 01 the No Movement Clause that was in effect during his first four years in Edmonton ends, to be replaced by a limited No Trade in which Sekera will list 15 teams to which he can be traded. That’s half the NHL.\n\nThey buy him out. Such a move would open up $3 million in cap hit for each of the next two seasons, but would cost $1.5 million the two years that follow. Put another way, the Oilers would pay $6 million in real dollars to the player to not play for them.\n\nAdvertisement 7\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nCan’t say as I favour that last option, even as there is a non-zero chance that it happens. It would open up a third-pairing spot for a young defender like, say, Caleb Jones, and even after paying for that replacement, open up something north of $2 million in cap space in 2019-20.\n\nThe trade option may make more sense. For starters, Sekera’s actual salary has been on a declining scale, from $6.5 million the first two years of the pact to $5.5 the next two to $4.5 the final two. Teams on a budget would save a million per year in hard cash vs. the cap hit. So that in itself is a bit of a sweetener. Not enough for a budget team to take on such a pact on its own, but a plus factor all the same. Perhaps a deal could be structured around the Oilers moving an expensive defender for an expensive winger, dealing from a position of depth to address another of organizational weakness. There are more than a few wingers kicking around out there who are likely overpaid for their current level of play but who are nonetheless established NHL-quality players. Perhaps there’s a fit.\n\nOr perhaps the fit is right in Edmonton, where Sekera has played the role of respected old pro who has had a tough run of luck. With another full summer to recover and a shuffling of the deck elsewhere on the blue, might there be a future role for the popular veteran back in the top four? The tough part is he was 30 in his best year in Edmonton, and will turn 33 next month. He hasn’t so much as scored a goal for two seasons. Surely a healthy campaign would enable an uptick in performance, but is it reasonable to expect “the old Andrej Sekera” or merely “an old Andrej Sekera”? The former can help your hockey club without a doubt.\n\nIn the immediate short term, Sekera proudly represents Slovakia as his country hosts the World Men’s Championship. Now a three-time national team captain, he was far from sheltered, playing a team-high 20:01 and setting up the game-winning goal as the Slovaks thumped USA 4-1 in an impressive opening game. Perhaps this small window of games in an elevated role will serve as a stepping stone, then again I said the exact same thing one year ago.\n\n___\n\nLatest podcast\n\nAdvertisement 8\n\nStory continues below\n\nThis advertisement has not loaded yet, but your article continues below.\n\nArticle content\n\nGoalie Shane Starrett of the Bakersfield Condors is in a mini-slump at a bad time, leading to the Condors being close to elimination in the AHL playoffs.
