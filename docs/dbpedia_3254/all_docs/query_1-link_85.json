        "text": "Until a surprise, late-second, out-of-the-blue trade to get the last pick of the first round, Oilers fans were going to have to be content with hoping a hidden gem fell to them in the late rounds. Up until the trade, they only had one pick until the fifth round. That just isn’t a recipe for success. Successful teams build through the draft. Oilers late round draft success has been crucial.\n\nUltimately, their draft ended up looking like this:\n\n2024 Entry Draft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From 2024 Entry 32 1 Sam O’Reilly R London Knights [OHL] 2024 Entry 64 2 Eemil Vinni G Jokipojat (Finland Jr.) 2024 Entry 160 5 Connor Clattenburg L Flint Firebirds [OHL] 2024 Entry 183 6 Albin Sundin D Vastra Frolunda Jr. [Swe-Jr] 2024 Entry 192 6 Dalyn Wakely C North Bay Battalion [OHL] 2024 Entry 196 7 William Nicholl C London Knights [OHL] 2024 Entry 218 7 Bauer Berry D Muskegon Lumberjacks [USHL]\n\nOilers fans should not expect too much of these young men. The odds of getting an impact player past the top dozen or so picks in the first round go exponentially down.\n\nOilers Need A Repeat of Late Round Draft Success\n\nThe Value of Draft Picks\n\nHockeyProspect.com conducted a study over several decades. It found that the likelihood of drafting a player who plays at least 200 NHL games is about 75% for the first overall pick. It goes down to around 50% for picks 2-10. Then it drops to about 25% by the end of the first round.\n\nTSN Analytics analyzed draft success rates and found that the chances of drafting a star player (top-tier impact player) in the first round are about 15-20%. Contrarily, in the later rounds, it drops below 5%.\n\nA study by Sportsnet Data revealed that about 50% of first-round picks play at least 200 NHL games. In contrast, about 25% of second-round pick do so. However, only about 12% of picks from the third round onwards do.\n\nHere is the value PuckPedia gives the Oilers draft picks in the next few years:\n\nROUND 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 PICK\n\nVALUE 2025 0 0 1 1 0 1 1 3.46 2026 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 23.21 2027 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 23.21\n\nYou can clearly see what happens when you don’t have any first or second round picks. That makes the lower picks even more important. The Oilers late round draft success will need to just that. Success.\n\nThere Can Be Value With Late Round Draft Selections\n\nThe Oilers late round draft success will be a thing to monitor. That doesn’t mean that lower round picks aren’t useful. Teams spending close to the salary need to cash in on inexpensive lower-round picks to support the stars. Also, they’re valuable currency in trades with other teams. And, just occasionally, they can turn into gems.\n\nPLAYER DRAFT NUMBER YEAR TEAM Brett Hull 117th overall 1984 Calgary Flames Doug Gilmour 134th overall 1982 St. Louis Blues Theoren Fleury 166th overall 1987 Calgary Flames Pavel Datsyuk 171st overall 1998 Detroit Red Wings Luc Robitaille 171st overall 1984 Los Angeles Kings Mark Stone 178th overall 2010 Ottawa Senators Dominik Hasek 199th overall 1983 Chicago Blackhawks Henrik Lundqvist 205th overall 2000 New York Rangers Henrik Zetterberg 210th overall 1999 Detroit Red Wings Patrik Hornqvist 230th overall 2005 Nashville Predators\n\nThe Oilers Best Late Round Draft Success\n\nThe key is in finding them. The Oilers have had late round draft success over the years with late picks. What they need to pray for is that this year’s later draft picks turn out similar to 2015.\n\n2015 Entry Draft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 2015 Entry 1 1 Connor McDavid C Erie Otters [OHL] 645 335 647 982 249 2015 Entry 117 4 Caleb Jones D U.S. National Development Team [USHL] 242 14 41 55 88 2015 Entry 124 5 Ethan Bear D Seattle Thunderbirds [WHL] 275 17 50 67 112 2015 Entry 154 6 John Marino D South Shore Kings [USPHL-Pr] 328 18 89 107 112 2015 Entry 208 7 Miroslav Svoboda G Trinec Jrs. (Czech Rep.) 2015 Entry 209 7 Ziyat Paigin D Kazan Ak-Bars [KHL]\n\nA ripped and stained athletic supporter could have picked Connor McDavid with the first overall pick. But picking three regular NHL defencemen in rounds 4-5-6? That’s the scouts earning their salaries. Extra relish on their arena hot dogs for those guys that year.\n\nThe Oilers Best Ever Lower Round Picks\n\nHere are arguably the Oilers best lower round picks in history. For our purposes, we’ll define “lower rounds” as the 4th round or lower. So, the four best from four and lower.\n\nJari Kurri\n\nDraft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 1980 Entry 69 4 Jari Kurri R Jokerit Helsinki [SM-liiga] 1251 601 797 1398 545\n\nWayne Gretzky and Jari Kurri went together like Edmonton winters and booster cables for your battery. Like a minus 40 degree morning a good windshield scraper. Would Gretzky have been Gretzky without Jari Kurri? Without a doubt. Would Kurri have been Kurri without Gretzky? Well, yes. Just look at his statistics before and after 1988. That was, of course, the year Gretzky was traded to the Los Angeles Kings. Not much of a drop-off at all.\n\nKurri would have been Kurri wherever he played. Five Stanley Cups. Enough said.\n\nRegular Season Playoffs Season Team League GP G A Pts PIM +/- GP G A Pts PIM 1980-81 Edmonton Oilers NHL 75 32 43 75 40 27 9 5 7 12 4 1981-82 Edmonton Oilers NHL 71 32 54 86 32 38 5 2 5 7 10 1982-83 Edmonton Oilers NHL 80 45 59 104 22 47 16 8 15 23 8 1983-84 Edmonton Oilers 🏆 NHL 64 52 61 113 14 38 19 14 14 28 13 1984-85 Edmonton Oilers 🏆 NHL 73 71 64 135 30 76 18 19 12 31 6 1985-86 Edmonton Oilers NHL 78 68 63 131 22 45 10 2 10 12 4 1986-87 Edmonton Oilers 🏆 NHL 79 54 54 108 41 35 21 15 10 25 20 1987-88 Edmonton Oilers 🏆 NHL 80 43 53 96 30 25 19 14 17 31 12 1988-89 Edmonton Oilers NHL 76 44 58 102 69 19 7 3 5 8 6 1989-90 Edmonton Oilers 🏆 NHL 78 33 60 93 48 18 22 10 15 25 18 1991-92 Los Angeles Kings NHL 73 23 37 60 24 -24 4 1 2 3 4 1992-93 Los Angeles Kings NHL 82 27 60 87 38 19 24 9 8 17 12 1993-94 Los Angeles Kings NHL 81 31 46 77 48 -24 — — — — —\n\nGlenn Anderson\n\nDraft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 1979 Entry 69 4 Glenn Anderson F U. of Denver [WCHA] 1129 498 601 1099 1120\n\nIt sounds funny to say that a Hall of Fame player never got the recognition he deserved. Playing in the shadow of Gretzky, Kurri, Messier, Coffey and Fuhr, it is easy to get lost in the shuffle. Anderson was simply fearless. He combined blazing speed with a complete disregard for his personal safety. At the same time, he charged the net like a cheetah seeing a wounded wildebeest in an era without breakaway pegs. Add in New York Islander Billy Smith swinging his stick like a Viking berserker every time he got near. And, oh yeah, five Stanley Cups to match Kurri, too.\n\nEsa Tikkanen\n\nDraft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 1983 Entry 80 4 Esa Tikkanen L HIFK Helsinki [SM-liiga] 877 244 386 630 1077\n\nIf Kurri and Anderson were pure offence, Tikkanen was a defensive scoring gem that drove opponents nuts. An early era Patrice Bergeron, if you will. “Tik” was known for his ability to score clutch goals, but also for his general style of play — chippy and aggressive. If Gretzky was “The Great One,” Tikkanen was nicknamed “The Grate One” for his ability to infuriate opposing players, often just by talking to them in his Finnish-English “Tikkanese” or “Tiki-Talk.”\n\nHe came very close to winning the Selke Trophy (awarded annually to the NHL forward who best excels in the defensive aspects of the game) several times. In 1989-90, he came in a close third (14% of votes) to St. Louis’ Rick Meagher (18.5% of votes), and Guy Carbonneau (17.5% of votes). The next year, 1990-91, Tikkanen was second in balloting for the Selke (40% of votes), beaten out only by Chicago’s Dirk Graham ((47% of votes).\n\nAll while putting up first-line scoring totals.\n\nMiroslav Satan\n\nSatan is the one the Oilers let get away, trading him away to Buffalo after just two years for Barrie Moore and Craig Millar before they knew what they had.\n\nDraft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 1993 Entry 111 5 Miroslav Satan L Trencin Dukla [Czech.] 1050 363 372 735 464\n\nPlaying for five different NHL teams, Satan had a 40-goal season, three 30-goal seasons and four 20-goal seasons. But he was just as effective a playmaker. He had two 70-point seasons, four 60-point seasons and another 50-point one.\n\nHe possessed a quick, accurate shot and excellent puck-handling abilities. And versatile, too. Satan was adaptable, able to play both wings and center when needed. Defensive ability? Check. He was capable of playing in both offensive and defensive situations. As we can see from the point totals above, add in consistency. Finally, there was his leadership. Satan often served as a captain or alternate captain, both in the NHL and for the Slovak national team.\n\nThe Honourable Mentions\n\nNot every late-round success can be a Hall of Famer or multiple Stanley Cup winner. Here are some other late-round Oiler draft picks that also excelled.\n\nDraft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 1981 Entry 111 6 Steve Smith D London Knights [OHL] 804 72 303 375 2139 1985 Entry 188 9 Kelly Buchberger R Moose Jaw Warriors [WHL] 1182 105 204 309 2297 1997 Entry 121 5 Jason Chimera L Medicine Hat Tigers [WHL] 1107 186 229 415 892 1998 Entry 99 4 Shawn Horcoff C Michigan State University [CCHA] 1008 186 325 511 624 2003 Entry 214 7 Kyle Brodziak C Moose Jaw Warriors [WHL] 917 129 167 296 462\n\nWill the Oilers 2024 Draft Resemble 2015? Or 2014 and 2013?\n\n2015\n\nDraft Num. Round Player Pos Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 2015 Entry 117 4 Caleb Jones D U.S. National Development Team [USHL] 242 14 41 55 88 2015 Entry 124 5 Ethan Bear D Seattle Thunderbirds [WHL] 275 17 50 67 112 2015 Entry 154 6 John Marino D South Shore Kings [USPHL-Pr] 328 18 89 107 112 2015 Entry 208 7 Miroslav Svoboda G Trinec Jrs. (Czech Rep.) 2015 Entry 209 7 Ziyat Paigin D Kazan Ak-Bars [KHL]\n\n2014\n\nDraft Number Round Player Position Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 2014 Entry 91 4 William Lagesson D Frolunda (Sweden Jrs.) 100 0 11 11 54 2014 Entry 111 4 Zach Nagelvoort G U. of Michigan [Big-10] 2014 Entry 130 5 Liam Coughlin F Vernon Vipers [BCHL] 2014 Entry 153 6 Tyler Vesel R Omaha Lancers [USHL] 2014 Entry 183 7 Keven Bouchard G Val d’Or Foreurs [QMJHL]\n\n2013\n\nDraft Number Round Player Position Drafted From GP G A Pts PIM 2013 Entry 94 4 Jackson Houck R Vancouver Giants [WHL] 2013 Entry 96 4 Kyle Platzer C London Knights [OHL] 2013 Entry 113 4 Aidan Muir L Victory Honda Midget 158 (MWEHL) 2013 Entry 128 5 Evan Campbell L Langley Rivermen [BCHL] 2013 Entry 158 6 Ben Betker D Everett Silvertips [WHL] 2013 Entry 188 7 Greg Chase L Calgary Hitmen [WHL]\n\nThe Oilers better hope this year’s late round picks match up to 2015. Not 2014 or 2013. The team has traded away multiple higher draft picks because the team is in a “win now” mode. As a result, the pipeline of drafted players moving onto the big team is currently down to a trickle. Late round draft successes will be vital going forward.\n\nMain Photo: Jim Rassol-USA TODAY Sports"
