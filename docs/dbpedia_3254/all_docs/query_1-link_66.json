        "text": "The Nashville Predators have announced that goalie Pekka Rinne has been placed on the injured reserve list with an undisclosed injury. Rinne was hurt in last night’s game against the Calgary Flames.\n\nPekka Rinne Injured\n\nRinne was injured after teammate Kevin Fiala collided with him after Sam Bennett‘s goal for the Calgary Flames. The injury occurred two minutes, 20 seconds into the third period. Juuse Saros came into the game and Nashville beat Calgary, 5-3.\n\nSo far this season, Rinne is 3-1 in five appearances. He has a 2.10 goals-against-average and a .929 save percentage. Rinne also has a shutout so far this season.\n\nHe has only played for the Nashville Predators in his 13-year NHL career. He a career record of 314-169-66 in 572 games. Rinne has a career 2.37 goals-against-average and .919 save percentage. The Nashville Predators drafted Rinne in the eighth round, 258th overall of the 2004 NHL draft.\n\nPredator coach Peter Laviolette said after the game he didn’t have an update on his goalie but added it wasn’t the team’s choice for him to exit, indicating that it was an injury that forced his starting goalie from the net.\n\n“We didn’t pull him, so something was wrong,” Laviolette said.\n\nWhat This Means for the Future\n\nThe Predators will have to lean on Saros if Rinne is out for an extended period of time. Nashville has called up goaltender Miroslav Svoboda from Atlanta of the ECHL for tonight’s game. The team also has Troy Grosenick in the AHL, who could possibly replace Svoboda for future games."
