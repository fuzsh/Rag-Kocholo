Three!! Three hockey threads! What are we, european soccer fans?!\n\nI should be glad the Leafs aren't doing so good, but the truth is, I wish Ferguson would have done more. If my beloved Habs are finally to finish before the Leafs in the standings and possibly beat them in a playoff confrontation, I want those damn dirty Leafs to be a strong team! Just like I want the Bruins and, to a lesser extend, the Sens to have good rosters and good systems.\n\nAllison and Domi (!) are not the solution to Toronto's needs right now. Belfour sucks, Antropov could go to Russia, great prospects in the system are a rarity, O'Neil is a nice addition but won't be enough. Things could be worst though. Ferguson could sign Lindros and Leclair and have Quinn reform the Legion of Doom line!\n\nOttawa has done good. They're roster hasn't changed that much. The Dominator is still on board and the Sens are scary.\n\nBoston is also looking strong. Leetch, Zhamnov, Scatchard, McEachern and Isbister and Glenn Murray signed with Boston. Those guys + Thornton, Samsonov, Bergeron and Raycroft = great games between the Habs and the Bruins!\n\nBuffalo is disappointing. Numminen is a nice veteran, but Satan and Zhitnik were important parts of this team. yet, they are young and fast, wich is good news for any organizations.\n\nThe Habs have done good. Of course most hockey fans in town were hoping for more names, but I'm happy. Kovalev is a great hockey player and his play in the playoffs was tremendous(despite his famous faking accident in overtime against Boston). I'm not afraid of his lack of consistency. I think playing with regular line members as talented as Koivu and Zednik will mean sparks and points will follow.\n\nWe have tons of talented young players ready to step up in the big league. Guys like Andrei Kostitsyn, Chris Higgins, Tomas Plekanec, Alexander Perezhogin and Ron Hiansey could actually make the team this year. And guys like Ribeiro, Komisarek and Ryder are still really young. Theo is not too old, the same goes for Markov, Souray is in his prime and Dandenault will replace Breeze-by perfectly. I know I'm a huge homer when it comes to hockey so I have to say: The future looks good from here!\n\nSo the North-East division is looking good for next year. The New Rangers will sign some big names before the start of the season to make it more interesting.\n\nThis \"new\" NHL is crazy these days!\n\nYou need proofs? Karya will play in Nashvilel! How screwed up is that?\n\nYou gotta love it!"
