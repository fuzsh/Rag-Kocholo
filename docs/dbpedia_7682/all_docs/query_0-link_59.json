I used Gender- neutral pronouns, please tell me if I messed up on some pronouns here.)\n\n•──────────────────•\n\nMc had been practically begging Lucifer to help them get along with Cerberus.\n\nObviously, Lucifer refused since that would be really dangerous for them. But Mc, as usual, didn't gave up and decided that\n\nTHEY.\n\nWILL.\n\nPET.\n\nTHE.\n\nTHREE HEADED DOG.\n\nThey got some toys (it was kinda difficult since Cerberus is a big boy) and also found some treats for him.\n\nMc waited until Lucifer was asleep so he wouldn't catch them and went to search for Cerberus. It wasn't easy since they got a little lost but, eventually, they found that magestic dog.\n\nCerberus didn't thought twice and went to attack, but stopped at the very last second. Maybe it was because of the treats they were holding, or maybe because Lucifer knew they would go there and decided that he would make sure they're save.\n\nMc started giving Cerberus the treats they got for him until he was satisfied and got more comfortable with them.\n\nMc, with a huge smile in their face decided to compliment the dog a little.\n\n\"Who's a good boy?\"\n\nCerberus seemed a little confused\n\n\"YOU'RE a good boy!!\"\n\nAnd now Cerberus was the happiest dog they have ever seen, practically jumping on top of them.\n\nMc tried their best to keep the dog as happy as they could, so they proceeded to pet him... But, there was one of Cerberus head they couldn't pet, since they just have two hands.\n\nMc, as the sensitive human they are, started crying.\n\n\"Mc?\"\n\nThey heard Lucifer's voice.\n\n\"Mc, why are you crying?\"\n\nThey could hear concern in his voice, probably thinking Cerberus hurt them. Mc struggled to talk while they were still sobbing.\n\n\"I- He... He has three heads and... And i-i just have two hands\"\n\nLucifer was silent for a moment, not knowing what to think of this before sighing and petting the head Mc couldn't pet, making them smile a little.\n\n\"Now... Mc.\"\n\nthey looked at him\n\n\"...Yes?\"\n\n\"Go to sleep, it's 3 AM and there are classes tomorrow.\"\n\n..."
