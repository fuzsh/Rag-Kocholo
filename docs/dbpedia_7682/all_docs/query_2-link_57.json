        "text": "☆☆☆☆☆\n\n(0 stars)\n\nOh my.\n\nThe Shadow Crucible, by T. M. Lakomy was not what I was expecting. Definitely I was wary of its dense text and rather ugly cover, but I did not fathom how difficult a read this was to be. It hurt. This book is written much like the author is unaware of what it means to create a story. As if written from Plato’s cave, guessing secondhand at what a writer’s craft is and turning up with the idea a plot is simply a series of events connected only by the virtue of being in chronological order.\n\nIt is edited for errors and formatted competently, but everything about this book screams of a hard, brutal lack of finesse. I am not ignorant of the idea of different story structures, I should say, that the western media idea of all stories conforming to the three act rollarcoaster is superior- but this is clearly not a case of some alternative system. It is merely a failure on all accounts of story telling, with character plots thinly written in a poorly defined yet over-detailed world, where every character speaks for paragraphs at a time yet fails to convey a single point.\n\nI got a splitting headache from this book, forcing myself to actually read every line (often more than once) to try and parse what it even imagines of itself. This is a dark fantasy set in a vaguely medieval time of England, it exists uneasily as an alternate history without anything clearly alternative, and centers on angels, demons, and pagans. I had to pause as I wrote that last bit, because I truly struggle within myself at the notion of this ‘centering’ on anything.\n\nMonths and years pass without comment as god and anti-god wage eternal war, while Lucifer forms vague plans and our female lead is cat-like and so, so, beautiful and perfect. Peppered between scenes of people vaguely talking about things but not really are gorey tortures, sexual violence, and just a sprinkle of apparent homophobic vibes, just to keep things classy. And. Of course. A pointless haunting dread that is actually worsened by the time Jesus Christ himself shows up.\n\nThis is not actually a Christian book, by the way- it’s a strange mix of Wicca and Christianity, and at times is coyly anti-christian while still again featuring Jesus as a positive character. Like most aspects, The Shadow Crucible is confused about its own identity, and I don’t think I’ll be able to part the veil too much in the (long) review ahead.\n\nWorld Lore\n\nThe worldbuilding in this book is painful. In the very beginning it appears fine- we understand quickly we’re in old England, though the royalty and landscape is slightly different, and that this is a world where some people have great psychic gifts that let them see demons. Really solid basic premise there. Then the Shadow Crucible keeps going, and the basic short bursts of worldbuilding turn into very, very long rambles. By the end most of the book is pages of characters explaining how the world works in very uncertain terms. I absolutely dread the quotes I’ll be using and resent the fact I’ll be transcribing them to you by hand today.\n\n[Two paragraphs of the same speech]\n\n“Never did a more beautiful star fall from the gates of heaven, plunging amid burning winds of fire and opalescent lights. Upon descending to earth, he tricked the angels that had joined them. Many he bound and trapped, casting them down to earth where they became trees, their weeping souls trapped in sap and bark forever. There many of them rotted, their souls erring into the abominable darkness Lucifer had created to spite God- the void that is empty of the holy light.\n\n“And Lucifer was born of the most radiant, pure fire. When we yield our spirits to the fire, we find our own godly spark and we can wield it, using it to weave dreams and tap into the Twilit world. But wary are we of what fire we choose to consecrate to ourselves. Some fires are jealous and desire only to seize our flame and devour our soul while others seek to live within us freely, sharing our souls as we share in their essence. And beyond all is our warden, the Hag Goddess, clad in rags. She walks across earth unmolested by even the vilest of its secrets, and she watches over everything. Yes, even over the chessboard, for she weaves the great tapestry of existence with golden hands.”\n\n193\n\nNow, it’s really hard to give a good picture of this book. One or two sentences of the prose will rarely be enough. In truth I feel like I need to photograph a few pages to help hammer it in: the entire book is written like the above, and this speech is one of countless various characters give where they ramble about the true nature of creation and the world. Yet, by the end, I actually still struggle to understand all of it.\n\nBy the end, here’s the rough: God and Samael are in an endless chessboard, which is at one point glimpsed as a literal chessboard. God is pure light and Samael is pure void. Pretty basic so far, right? At this point I balk as I try to, several times, parse the rest. God kinda had a wife, named Sophia, who also made creation, maybe. Lucifer fancied himself like god and dreamed up earth, and stole sacred music and his own song to create earth. He fell to earth and set about influencing humanity, offering them culture, science, and ideas over the generations. But also temptations of evil. It’s really very unclear what Lucifer’s aims or purposes are, it’s vaguely implied he is actually the power behind Samael, but this doesn’t make sense. Lucifer himself claims he is still beloved by God and all of this is according to his schemes, the brightest light that can still glimpse the void, acting as a sort of barrier between the two… but then he’s also like, the famous liar Lucifer. So who the hell knows.\n\nThe fallen angels split off when they hit earth. Many of them became evil demons out for Samael, others became gods of old religions and demigod figures, some sought redemption and returned to Heaven, while others became the Twilit gods: these are neutral beings in a neutral plane who became pagan figures. The Twilit gods chose some humans to become the Twilit people, who are blessed with psychic powers such as the sight, seeing into the future, and other such blessings. The Twilit are those persecuted by the church for their pagan ways but are also some of the only people able to see and defeat demons.\n\nBeyond God and Samael, we also have a nebulous realm of other. While fallen angels are stated to have become the Twilit gods- and thus as angels, lower than God- the Twilit we see are seemingly far more powerful and ancient. The Triple Goddess (the maiden, the mother, the crone) are charaters who exist in the neutral inbetween seemingly more capable than god. The wizard Merlin scorns the idea of there ever being a garden of Eden, despite also himself perhaps being God and holding court in a magical garden with an apple tree. The anti-christ is conceived in this book while generations of the prophecized messiah have been murdered by demonic forces. The Norn weave tapestries of fate and all existence, including those of alien planets. Elves are real and live in the Twilit realm. Jesus is there.\n\nYet the lore can’t seem to line up any of this clearly. Who rolls up to whom? Are the Twilit all fallen angels? The elves are the original stewards of earth and the wilds, evidently, who now hide in the Twilit world- are they fallen angels? Are they dreams of Lucifer? If you were to task this book in putting its world into any hierchy or structure it would fail, perhaps in part to the shoddy writing. A lot of the lore is being told by different characters and inconsistent, perhaps to represent the characters having different views- but it all blends together in that thick purple prose and identical voice. There isn’t a mystery around the truth of the world, only frustration.\n\n“There was never any tree, nor any garden, and that fabrication has been the most lucrative force of deception wielded over you mortals. Look to the stars for the truth, for the world shall change and another darkness smother creation, but the immortal stars weave their tales indefinitely from their heavenly sphere.”\n\n268, Merlin here purports the Christian story is false. Merlin is a Twilit, apparently the first human Twilit who then underwent the three-fold death and ascended as a great magical being, so he’s a reliable source in this tale. He’s even vaguely painted as God himself. Him saying the Christian story is false however oddly supports Lucifer, who earlier says the Abrahamic God was a farce made only to limit humanity and oppress women. So Lucifer was right and not lying? It’s unclear.\n\nActual plot\n\nEstella is a fiery hot fiery feral feline powerful beautiful wild untamed fiery red hot feline hot Twilit lady. She was abducted from her Roma family and made to replace an english noblewoman. She’s the most powerful seer ever and implied to be the goddess who created the universe with god (maybe) reborn. She lazes about mostly dealing with demons and hating men. One day Count Mikhail arrives from afar, he’s a templar who has been given a vision of seeking her out. He also, and this is not at all important, is half demon. Mikhail thinks the Twilit could help the church defeat evil and is against oppressing them, which is the current policy.\n\nMikhail instantly is taken in by Estella, but they have a rather enemies to lovers things going on where he continously attacks and grabs her, insisting she needs to use her great gifts for the good of the church. She keeps refusing so he kidnaps her so he, the queen, the cardinal, and his friend Oswald can do… something to her. It turns out though the cardinal is evil and plans to cut out her eyes in order to regain his own vision, and Estalla runs away with the help of a fallen angel.\n\nSeeing the recalcitrance on her face, he sneered, “He will devour you and spit your soul out for hell to defile, till infinity finally caves in. Do you really doubt it? You’re a real treat for him- a bright light and seer. You stand at the fringes of God’s own eyes and face the aborted darkness. You stare evil in the eye, and he will consume those eyes, open to the infinity of God and the eternity of the false creation. Now come.”\n\n76\n\nThe fallen angel has been harassing her forever. He’s described as disfigured consistantly and sometimes called very ugly, but our only descriptions of him paint him as being extremely androgynous, having long hair, and one blind eye- is that ugly disfigurement… a blind eye? He is deeply in love and lust with Estalla and several times tries to assault her. His name is Antariel, and as he helps Estalla flee he describes how he was taken in by Lucifer and as consequence lost his voice, music being his only love. He stuck to one woods for a long time and in fact watched Estella grow up, follwing her her entire life and helping shape her and aid her. Creepy! He tries again to assult Estella, who reaches out psychically for help. Lucifer shows up and spears him, taunting him. Then an angel shows up and takes Antariel away for judgement and gets rid of Lucifer.\n\nEstalla spends several months in France. We see Mikhail, but he is just sort of lost and doing nothing without Estalla, who he feels he’s in love with at this point. The Queen of England supports his templar service which likes the Twilit, but the church and king are running a genocide and demons are causing disease. We get very little in this brief window on what he’s up to.\n\nEstella is a nun for a while, becoming a renowned healer who is picked by the prince of France to heal him. He’s posessed by a demon from some ancient sapphires and when she expunges them he’s ready to make her his queen. But he’s actually working with the cardinal, who is now posessed by Samael. Estalla escapes and flees with Antariel, who is now redeemed. Yeah, the angel who took him basically got him cleared of his crimes, and now he’s a pure beautiful angel. He’s no longer lustful but he is still quite in love with Estalla and despite being an angel, seems to still have some dark agenda. Vaguely. They return to England, this whole side venture leaving the reader scratching their head.\n\nMonths pass again. The book has this habit: time will pass dramatically and we will hear roughly what happened inside. Sometimes rather major things will occur off-page like this. Estella and Mikhail work together to try and stop the rise of demons, alongside the queen, but don’t have much luck. One day the cardinal is torturing and assaulting a man when Estella busts in with Cerberus, like from Tartarus, and kills him. Then Lucifer shows up and makes Cerberus kill Estalla. As she’s dying though Lucifer heals her, telling her lore that may or may not be true which paints him as fairly benevolent, and offers her a place by his side. Mikhail interupts and Estella jumps through the wormhole she used to summon Cerberos, and flees into the Twilit world.\n\nEstella wanders through the crossroads dimension aided by Wicca folks. She runs into Merlin who steals her seer powers so that Samael and Lucifer will stop looking for her and goes to just chill in the Twilit world. Meanwhile, time has passed. The Queen of England, jealous Mikhail loves Estalla, gets posessed by Samael, who then tries to rape him. When he rejects her she goes and instead has sex with the templar Oswald, thus conceiving the anti-christ. The king, previously a puppet of Samael, is tortured for being bad at his job by Samael- he regrets his actions and Jesus walks in, causing him to totally repent. Mikhail shows up and the king says he should be the new king.\n\n“You have withstood the chaos of my rule,” the king croaked. “You who shall be the savior of my kingdom.”\n\nMikhail nodded, offering him a wan smile. “I had come here prepared for the worst, and yet I see in you both the reek of hell and the breath of the divine. You are lucky to be given the chance to pass through the darkness into grace.”\n\nThe king nodded. Looking at Mikhail he wept, seeing in him the image of the man he had dreamed of being, before he had erred into debauchery and cruelty. The plain silver circlet Mikhail wore was more becoming to him than the crown of emperors.\n\n259\n\nMeanwhile, Estella decides to die and be reborn as a Twilit person, probably an elf. Meanwhile, Antariel is sad about Estella being gone. One day he’s randomly arrested by Heaven again and rejudged. They find him weak and too big on humans, so they turn him into a statue until someone loves him enough to turn him back. Jesus then shows up and says he can’t undo Heaven’s ruling, but he speaks a weird prophecy and makes Antariel a human. Though still a marble statue. Luckily one day an elf comes by and makes a magical song that undoes the spell and he’s freed. The elf might be Estella, I’m not sure.\n\nTime passes, and the queen is now corrupted and evil and hooking up with the evil prince of France. Mikhail seemingly has not become king or anything- he is dying and being punished by the church for his actions. One day a hooded figure beckons him into the woods, where he is taken to the Twilit world. Elves and the Horned God tell him he’s been chosen to be reborn- he will die soon but come back when the anti-christ is born, and when he is a man will be the one capable of stopping him. He dies and enlists his friend Oswald to bury him in a Wicca way and watch over the templars for him. Oswald notes he’ll die while Mikhail is being reborn, so the Horned God makes Oswald go through the three-fold death, a ritual where you die a bunch (more than three!) and emerge as an enlightened wizard.\n\nThe end???\n\n(An obvious note: the timeline by the end is extremely vague. A huge amount of time seems to pass between the king dying and Mikhail dying but the queen is still pregnant, so it must be months. Antariel is a statue long enough that where he sits is named ‘Angel’s descent’, but there’s no indication he’s freed in the future- was he there months too? Or is the timeline an utter mess?)\n\nCharacters, and their threads\n\nI’m going to try something, a great exercise to do with any book- yours, someone else’s… I’m going to break down the plot as it is regarding one character. Antariel.\n\nAs we see Antariel, he has been stalking Estella for years and attempting to rape her. He is in love/lust with her and has watched her since her soul was born. She refutes his offers of a deal but accepts when she is in danger. They team up to flee London, where he tells her his backstory. Though she is initially sympathetic to his plight as a fallen angel, he takes advantage and again tries to rape her. She calls for help and Lucifer stabs him, and then another angel shows up and takes Antariel away to be judged.\n\nAntariel is given a chance at a redeemed angel life, where he acts still in aid of Estella. His lust is gone, but he’s still in love. He even erases from her mind the fact she was in love with Mikhail briefly. He aids the anti-Samael team, but isn’t there when Estella is nearly killed by Lucifer and escapes. Antariel goes to sulk in the woods, and another angel shows up.\n\nThis angel condemns him to be a statue for doing a bad job at being an angel, I suppose. Jesus Christ shows up and vaguely turns Antariel human, but still a statue. And elf sings a song and frees Antariel from being a statue, and he ends the book recounting his life story to her.\n\nWhat is this? Antariel is a minor character, flitting in and out of scenes. His role in the story is a supportive cast member who is often entirely passive, his only actions being perving on Estella, messing with her memories, and helping from the shadows. Him being taken to be judged by angels twice is like a joke- indeed, he does not significantly change from fallen to redeemed besides less groping, and then his statue-curse comes from nowhere.\n\nA story is perhaps the culmulation of multiple character threads, but The Shadow Crucible often feels like several frayed lines in a poorly tied knot- Estella is our main lead, and she flits in and out of other storylines so frequently it feels like a coinflip, while Mikhail labors in a purgatory of ‘nothing changing’ without her. The plot stutters and jumps, major changes like plague and power plays off screen, the scenes we see of characters together mostly being them discussing things we did not see. The storylines of each character do not weave; they bump into each other and send things flying.\n\nMikhail arrives in London and comes across Estella. Immediately intrigued, he chases her down with physical violence and forms an obsession she, with her great power, will help save the church from corruption. These two hate each other until they do not- and they bone down.\n\nEstella lifted her eyes to his. “And could you contain the storm of my raging soul? The tempest brews and I have been too long captivated by the dark secrets that swell where God has not yet turned the light of his face.”\n\nMikhail smiled knowingly. “Then look into my countenance. I who have seen the divine mysteries, and therein you shall find peace. And though the devils of this world surround you and put out your eyes, there it shall burn within you, an eternal light.”\n\nShe sighed as he pressed her against him tenderly and their minds met across the thorns and brambles they had laid for one another, and they communed together.\n\n99\n\nMikhail though then again tries to get her to help in a godly way and she flees. In her absence Mikhail pines for. I don’t know, years? Plague and disaster happen in London and he’s vaguely fighting it but doing poorly. Estella returns but doesn’t recall their night of passion thanks to Antariel, which annoys him. Mikhail and her vaguely fight corruption but do a bad job of it. Estella flees again, in her absence Mikhail pines and vaguely fights corruption but does a really bad job. He never sees her again, and though the king names him a successor, he’s imprisoned by the evil side of the church and suffers. As he’s dying some Wicca god calls upon him to be reborn as the saviour of mankind against evil.\n\nAgain I lay out his storyline to point out its weakness. Mikhail is our lead in character, our main viewpoint for quite a lot of the book, but is eclipsed by Estella. His actual influence in the story feels… passive. I’ll be coming back to that word a lot- this is a book where every character is passive to a degree, and the only active component seems to be the pagecount.\n\nMikhail has a revelation only when he is dying that he should not have sought to cage Estella like he did, and that is the full force of his development. He is ultimately a religious man who cares about the plight of the Twilit. He actually can read everyone’s mind constantly, a fact that seems to be brought up less and less as the book goes on, and struggles against sin in that standard Templar way. He is plainly not a very interesting character, extremely static until his sudden turn towards the wonders of Wicca at the end, and in fact is often very unpleasant towards Estella.\n\nEstella is our lead and the author darling. She feels like some sort of idealized self insert somehow- I don’t usually go about throwing out terms like mary sue, but Estella was one of the first times in years I actually feel it fits. She reads like a wattpad book protagonist of a ‘strong female character’. Estella is a tortured soul of a rich, extremely beautiful woman. She has the ultimate power of seer-ness, able to see further than anyone else, ever. She can also read minds and probe brains, casting wards against demons and setting up psychic networks with ease. Her powers are never really explained, and at many turns she simply will do something the reader had no idea she could. When she bursts in with a wormhole that has summonded and bound Cerberus… well, look, that wasn’t exactly set up.\n\nEstella is wanted by all. Women are jealous of her intense beauty, natural charm, and fiery (feral, hot, red) personality. The Queen, an ally in the fight against Samael, is literally posessed and corrupted because she’s that jealous of Estella. The King wants to possess her, even willing to reduce his desire to just one night with her, and she’s able to outwit and make him a fool with ease. The prince of France desires her carnally and as a wife. Lucifer says he’ll make her a queen by his side. A Fallen Angel has been captivated by her since she was just a spark of a soul and loves her eternally. A loyal chaste Templar falls deeply in love with her. She’s the most wanted pawn of God and Samael, the deciding piece in the war between good and evil, capable of playing either side with her immense gifts.\n\nEstella’s incredible beauty, daring red-accented looks, and feral red-glowing eyes are the envy of all. It’s no wonder she feels incredibly indulgent as a character, simply too incredible compared to the rest of the cast. In a dingy medieval world where evil grows, Estella is able to be the cool, rebellious girl who can get out of anything while also being the chosen one. Her story is that of not wanting to be chosen- she seeks a way off the eternal war for good and evil, and flees to the Twilit planes away from it all. Even there though she has a destiny to be reborn and return to her powers in order to stop evil, so it’s more like she’s taking a respite as main character.\n\nEstella, despite being the powerful feral sexy red hot dangerous wild untamable beautiful lead, is a very passive character. Yes, she does magic at times, and yes, she is active in her fleeing. Yet her whole story is her fleeing and hiding while events happen to her. It does not feel very much like running away is an active choice for her, only the result of other people enacting plot points in her direction. She begins the book as an alcoholic constantly being assaulted by demons and wallowing alone, and runs away when Mikhail shows up trying to get her to help fight Samael. In France she hides as a bored nun until the prince hires her for healing, after expunging a demon from him she has to flee again back to England. There she tries to stop the Twilit genocide but does very little, only taking action to sic Cerberus on the evil Cardinal. Lucifer then turns Cerberus on her, so she has to flee to the Twilit realm. There she wanders, relying on the help of Wicca gods until she stumbles across Merlin, who takes her sight away. A Wicca god then shows up and tells her to heed her destiny, so she goes to reincarnate as an elf.\n\nParse this: what does Estella actually do in this book, and what is she forced to do by outside forces? For a strong lead with the ultimate power, she is constantly powerless, and indeed a large number of times Mikhail or someone else is choking her, throwing her around, attacking her, or sexually assaulting her. The narrative paints her as a bold lead yet fails her at every step.\n\nThe homophobia bit\n\nI promised this and I can deliver it with caveat. I’m not sure this book is homophobic or that was the author’s intent- but it does give me a bad vibe.\n\nIn a part of the book not even mentioned until now, Estella actually begins the book with a fiance. His name is Woodcraft and he does not matter at all beyond an obstacle for Estella to totally best. Estella hates men and Woodcraft is gay, so it’s a marriage of convenience for them. Our POV of Woodcraft begins with him calling her his friend, but immediately he is planning to kill her, for he doesn’t trust her to keep the secret that he’s gay.\n\nHe was delighted to be back in his favorite city- the elegant court with its refined ways, the endless supply of gentlemen, well-shaped, with soft skin and ever more enticing lips. And of course there was Estella, his supposed salvation and devoted friend, who claimed to be so eager to protect his secret.\n\nWoodcraft was currently in a carriage laden with gifts for Estella, mulling over his thoughts darkly. In two months they were supposed to be wed. So far she seemed outwardly to be keeping her side of the bargain, but an inordinate sense of horror radiated from her presence at times, and his natural inclination for suspicion became an obsessive paranoia that gradually degenerated into fears of betrayal. His unease engendered a compelling need to be rid of her, and since he feared and knew her spiteful nature towards men that exerted pressure on her, he preferred to end their deal in an unfortunate yet beneficial way.\n\n54-55\n\nOkay, whatever. It’s not a crime to have a gay character be a villain, or in this case even a friend gone paranoid off page villain. Gay characters deserve complexity and a variety of roles befitting their part in society as ‘normal people’. The issue lies more when that is the only hint of the existence of gay people in the narrative, or if the character’s complexity boils down simply to ‘gay, evil’.\n\nWoodcraft plans to poison Estella with a necklace, but since she’s a mindreader she simply does not wear it. At a party Mikhail shows up and bothers Estella about her fake marriage, taking her to a garden path to… watch Woodcraft have sex with a man for a bit? Estella bitterly explain her hatred for marriage and men as a cage and the plot continues, with us later learning Mikhail threatened Woodcraft, causing him to go into hiding. That’s the last we see of him. Again, back out of everything for a second and consider this character- he plays no role in the plot. His role is that his gayness makes him paranoid of our lead and tries to kill her, which she easily bests. His end is that we see him have gay sex and he’s sent into hiding.\n\nNow, one off. Hm. Whatever. Here’s my big twist: Woodcraft is only one of two gay sex having villains! Yes, when it’s a reoccuring trope in your book, you might need to stop and think. The evil cardinal character, of course, is described as deeply corrupted, seeking out men, then boys, then only being able to get off on violence against women. Despite the latter fact, later on we get a scene where he forces himself on a male prisoner- this is right before Estella bursts in and kills him with Cerberus. It definitely feels odd to be told he now just enjoys violence (against women specifically) but get an on-page male rape.\n\nIn fact, the only on page sex in this book is rape and assault, and the only particularly graphic ones are the two gay ones. Hmm. Estella and Mikhail have sex and it’s a wave of metaphors and a fade to black, but Woodcraft is ‘plowing’ another man quite physically, and the Cardinal… well, we hear about his member. The next most graphic is when the Queen tries to have sex with Mikhail against his will. I don’t like that this is a running theme. Definitely a common trope though, it must be said, is to portray gay male sex as violent, brutal, physical- and in this book it definitely seems gay male sex is all of that and an act done by horrible people.\n\nSo you can get why I call it bad vibes.\n\nThe Writing\n\nDo you like how many quotes I have? I don’t. I hate having to reread this book to double check plot points, and I hate transcribing this writing. Ah. This writing!\n\nJust as the book only understands plot as a linear progression of page numbers, this book understands writing prose as a constant challenge of similies and the assumption old timey people spoke like they were trying to hit a wordcount. The prose is thick and purple and often indecipherable. One or two of the fancy words and long enviromental descriptions hit, and the rest make you want to drown yourself. A highlight of a good book, I think, is knowing when to go all out on fancy prose- really capture a mood, moment, or thought- and then duck back a bit to let that writing shine. If the book is all heavy prose all the time, nothing stands out and eveything takes forty years.\n\nThe speech though is actually the worst part. As shown, everyone speaks in thick paragraphs with meandering points, and though technically dialogue isn’t prose… it’s the worst of the prose in the book by far.\n\n[Paragraph two of a speech by Antariel]\n\n“Lucifer enticed my wayward heart, and I sang his visions into song and I wrought many dark evils I deemed to be fair. And for that in the Fall when Lucifer was hurled out, the angel ruling over me broke my voice. Now I cannot create anything, only watch the endless mists of creation and burn with longing. But that was not the only blow. I had once also danced before the immortal tree of life, whose limpid branches held the worlds together and those heart was the core of the undying holy fire. The tree was wrought of an equal balance or mercy and might, the red and blue veins that nourish the womb of the universe and keep it alive. I was more attuned to might, and because my fire burned with it, Lucifer was able to entice me to use my spirit for his creations.”\n\n125\n\nHere’s a very classic example of a wandering speech by a character. Note it is primarily stray thoughts that don’t collect into much meaning, featuring run-on sentences. Antariel here says he was a singer of creation and Lucifer took advantage of that. Then he says losing his voice was not the only blow- but gets distracted talking about dancing and a magic tree. He goes on for two more paragraphs, saying when he fell his spirit was cut in half- a closing thought that does not link to him being a dancer or the tree at all. Pretty much every bout of dialogue is like this, especially when characters are recounting their opinions on the world or God or whatever.\n\nThe prose is fond of odd phrases and specific words. Twice do we get ‘the trees moaned’, and I know that for a fact because both times I had to stop at that line. Metaphors and points of description are often reused- much is made about eyes and blindness, to the point the constant desciptions relating to them feel repetitive and bland. It’s meant to be a theme, but the book takes the idea of that too literally, and thus the word ‘eye’ shows up on repeat.\n\nHis clear eyes were limpid pools of the clearest waters, and Oswald lowered his eyes in shame, for he felt small and of little consequence, deformed and ugly.\n\n343, actually such a beautiful example of poor writing in so many ways it’d make a great example for creative writing students\n\nThe idea I kept coming back to was that this book is like a poorly made cake. Long rambling prose is like heaps of dry sponge, and you have to keep cutting down to get to the tiny glimpse of frosting- the story happening and existing- and then it’s back to cutting again. Deeper and deeper through bits you wish you could skip.\n\nMy final writing note is that the last chapter of the book is in fact in first and second person. Bold move. It’s literally several pages of a first person description of the ‘three fold death’, here rendered as just a tutorial on the many ways in which you just keep dying until you wind up enlightened. Then we cut to Oswald and learn he’s done this and he’s a wizard. But seriously, bizarre choice all around: ‘I am now going to tell you about the three fold death- you awake and find yourself dying a bunch- Oswald is now a wizard’. Is this mix of viewpoints some sort of ploy to use three-POV styles in a chapter about a three-fold death?\n\nDoesn’t work.\n\nPoetry…?\n\nEvery chapter of this book begins with a stanza of what I’d like to call a puzzle for your brain. Otherwise known as bad poetry. At first I wasn’t sure it wasn’t song lyrics or taken from something else- they all rhyme and seemingly have little to do with the chapter. The rhyme scheme isn’t consistent, and each one had the effect of making me stop reading and stare for a long time trying to decipher what the author was trying to say. Seriously, most of them are so dense and dull I don’t want to repeat them here- all of them are examples of the purple prose style untethered to the restraints of a sentence structure, AKA, vague and bland.\n\nIt sat upon its lofty throne erected upon your cranial seat\n\nAnd drove the stakes of conquest into your brain\n\nFor never shall the waves of solace and comfort meet\n\nIn that sundered solitary heart wildly insane\n\n39\n\nHuh? Do you see what I mean? I’m not wrong, right? There’s a mix of metaphors, and right when you slightly can guess what it’s describing, you’re stuck guessing. Poetry is a very subjective genre that I don’t feel confident critiquing most of the time, but these feel more like fragments of prose than a poem.\n\nFor you cannot flee the beast that fed your broken light\n\nNor elude the precipice hollowed from your tears and wails\n\nSo cast yourself to die, as a meteor hurtling into rapid flight\n\nFanned into a vivid final exploding beam before it fails\n\n10\n\nI did read all 35 of these, even though I really did not want to. Not once do they add to the narrative, and if any of them were ‘alright’, I would have marked it.\n\nI have drunk of that gilded cup passed down by ancient hands\n\nIn complete silence and knowledge of the asperity it bequeaths\n\nThe cauldron of ages stirs upon the confines of mortal lands\n\nDrawing the leaping swords of conquest from their sheaths\n\n136\n\nLastly: what does it stand for?\n\nI expressed before this is not a Christian book, but that Jesus is in it. So what is it? What exactly is the Shadow Crucible trying to say about the world- what world, at the very least, does it live in?\n\nIt’s a surprisingly difficult question with an obvious answer- this is a Wiccan book about the superiority of wicca and pagan beliefs to Christian ones, despite being set in a world where the Christian god and Christian devil seemingly were the origin of the Wiccan gods. The universe is set up on the idea of Christian figures like angels and demons being the sole actors in the world, in a grand chessboard of good and evil- that all pagan beliefs and gods stem from fallen Christian angels.\n\nYet it is the Wiccan Twilit who have all the power, somehow. God is not a very active player in this book, angels only showing up to arrest Antariel those two times, and while Lucifer hints at having a plan and Samael hints at having a plan, only the Wiccan gods enact any plans successfully. They’re the actionable ones- The Crone shows up to promise Estella the right to not be a pawn, which prompts her to flee to the Twilit realms, and The Horned God picks Mikhail and Estella to be reborn as saviours and grants Oswald wizardry. These beings by the book’s apparent mythology are fallen angels posing as gods yet act truly as gods.\n\nEstella and Mikhail’s conflict serves mostly to show the book’s opinion. The Twilit people are gifted people with great power who are persecuted by the church for being pagans. While there is talk that their existence as neutral players between light and dark make them susceptible to corruption by demons, what we see is mostly good and kind people who live simple lives in tune with old magic- in contrast to the church. With the elves, the first inhabitants of Earth (and fallen angels? Maybe?), we hear that human dominion over Earth has driven them away, and indeed they seem to show that the true ‘correct’ way to be is the Twilit way in tune with nature. Estella is right in all her actions, and Mikhail is blinded by the church and its ways- needing to be reborn by the Wicca god and become in touch with old natural magic.\n\nAt this point it seems pretty cut and dry- church bad, Wicca good. Except again that mystery of the lore: this is a Christian world with Christian rules. Jesus Christ shows up! Twice! Christ here is shown as a shepherd, being very kind and helping people find good old fashioned Christian repentance and perdition. His inclusion is about as Christian as it gets, especially in a book whose thesis is that his religion is inferior to another. The power dynamics are thus, off- Did Christianity come first, with a biblical God who came to Earth as Jesus, and then fallen angels founded Paganism? Or have Wicca gods always existed in the grey plane between good and evil, observing as Christianity sprang into being?\n\nWhen I talk about this, it isn’t with the air of something being open to interpretation. This is good old fashioned confusion with a touch of uncertainty. Does The Shadow Crucible need to be Christian or Wicca, one or the other? No, it obviously is an odd mix of both. But quite what kind of mix is simply hard to quantify. Clearly the Wiccan ways are best, but whether that is ultimately true or if they all rule up to capital G Christian God is entirely unknown.\n\n(Christ apparently went through the three-fold death to become a wisened sage/wizard/magician, by the way, so make of that what you will).\n\nBy the end\n\nI nervously hope some people read this far. This is a long one. I hope I’m actually entertaining, and that everyone isn’t just thinking ‘dear god, make it shorter!’\n\nThe Shadow Crucible is a failure of a bunch of words put in a linear fashion and sold to me second hand.\n\nThis is a story passive to itself, whose unclear lore is too twisted to feel unique, littered with bad prose and rambling speeches by characters too busy talking to develop a personality. As the darling perfect lead character does, let’s all flee through a wormhole into a place where we can all be free from it."
