        "text": "Labours of Hercules, the 12 labours, or tasks, assigned to the Greco-Roman legendary hero Hercules (Heracles) by King Eurystheus.\n\nTraditionally, Hercules was the son of Zeus, the chief deity among the Greek gods, and Alcmene, a mortal princess whom Zeus tricked into sleeping with him. Hercules married Megara, daughter of the king of Thebes, with whom he had children. Driven mad by Zeus’s vindictive wife, the goddess Hera, Hercules killed Megara and their children. To atone, he consulted the oracle at Delphi and was told to become the servant of King Eurystheus.\n\nBritannica Quiz\n\nFrom Athena to Zeus: Basics of Greek Mythology\n\nIt was Eurystheus who imposed upon Hercules the famous Labours, later arranged in a cycle of 12, usually as follows:\n\nthe slaying of the Nemean lion, whose skin he thereafter wore\n\nthe slaying of the nine-headed Hydra of Lerna\n\nthe capture of the elusive hind (or stag) of Arcadia\n\nthe capture of the wild boar of Mount Erymanthus\n\nthe single-day cleansing of the cattle stables of King Augeas of Elis\n\nthe shooting of the monstrous man-eating birds of the Stymphalian marshes\n\nthe capture of the mad bull that terrorized the island of Crete\n\nthe capture of the man-eating mares of King Diomedes of the Bistones\n\nthe taking of the girdle of Hippolyte, queen of the Amazons\n\nthe seizing of the cattle of the three-bodied giant Geryon, who ruled the island Erytheia (meaning “red”) in the far west\n\nthe bringing back of the golden apples kept at the world’s end by the Hesperides\n\nthe fetching up from the underworld of the triple-headed dog Cerberus, guardian of its gates\n\nHaving completed the Labours, Hercules was free but went on to perform other noteworthy feats.\n\nAccording to some accounts, after Hercules had completed the first 10 tasks, King Eurystheus declared that the second and fifth tasks did not count, either because he had assistance or because he received payment. He then demanded that Hercules complete two more tasks, which are the 11th and 12th labours."
