        "text": "Cerberus is a high level Slayer boss. A Slayer level of 91 is required to inflict damage and a slayer task of Cerberus or hellhounds. Wild pies can be used to boost the player's Slayer level, but only if they have a minimum of 86 Slayer, and the boost must be maintained for the entire kill.\n\nIt is the only monster to drop the eternal, pegasian, and primordial crystals which are used to upgrade the infinity, ranger, and dragon boots to the best-in-slot eternal, pegasian, and primordial boots respectively.\n\nIn addition, it is also able to drop a Smouldering stone, which can be combined with a dragon axe, pickaxe, or harpoon to turn them into their respective infernal counterparts; the infernal axe, pickaxe, and harpoon.\n\nHow to get there[edit | edit source]\n\nCerberus' Lair can be found in Taverley Dungeon, at the hellhounds' area. There will be a small opening that players can crawl into to enter the lair.\n\nEffective ways to get to Taverley Dungeon include teleporting to Falador and using the wall shortcut near the West bank, only a short run from the dungeon entrance, or moving one's Player-owned house to Taverley, exiting via the house portal and running south.\n\nDue to the huge distance from a bank to Cerberus' lair, it is highly encouraged that players do not attempt the boss until they have 65 or higher Agility, as attempting to run from the entrance to her lair the normal way is extremely unfeasible. 70 Agility is required for the pipe shortcut, and 80 for the wall trap shortcut. Both can be boosted, meaning 65/75 Agility is the minimum needed to use the shortcuts. This avoids the use of a dusty key; if entering from pipe, have Protect from Magic active before going in to avoid potentially getting scorched by a blue dragon. If entering from the wall spikes, attack a skeleton and let it attack once before jumping, as the occasional poison spider can wander around the area.\n\nThe fastest method would involve key master teleports, but these are an uncommon, untradeable drop from Cerberus.\n\nMechanics[edit | edit source]\n\nAttack Styles[edit | edit source]\n\nCerberus attacks with all three forms of combat:\n\nMelee - Cerberus bites the player. This attack will only be used if the player is standing within melee range.\n\nRanged - Cerberus stands on her hind legs and kicks out with her front legs, firing a translucent spiky ball.\n\nMagic - Cerberus lowers her head and fires a smooth black ball.\n\nAll of these attacks have a max hit of 23.\n\nProtection Prayers prevent all damage, but must be active as the attack is launched.\n\nTriple Attack[edit | edit source]\n\nThis attack is initiated as her first attack and is repeated after every ten attacks in sequence.\n\nShe uses a magic, ranged and then melee attack 2 ticks after one another. This melee attack will be executed regardless of distance, and does not act as a projectile.\n\nAs with her standard attacks, these can deal up to 23 damage and can be fully blocked by prayer.\n\nSummoned souls[edit | edit source]\n\nThis attack only starts when Cerberus falls below 400 health, and is used every seventh attack.\n\nThis attack is indicated with her howling Aaarrrooooooo, causing three Summoned Souls to appear from behind the archaic skull. They cannot be harmed.\n\nEach one attacks using a different combat style:\n\nRed is melee\n\nBlue is magic\n\nGreen is ranged\n\nThe souls appear in a randomized order, and attack once each in sequence from west to east.\n\nIf the attack is not protected against, it will deal 30 damage; an elysian spirit shield reduces this to 22 damage.\n\nIf the attack is protected against, it will drain 30 prayer points instead; a spectral spirit shield reduces this to 15 prayer points.\n\nIt is sufficient to have the correct prayer active when the attack is launched, even if this would drain the player's prayer to 0. As a result, players need a minimum of about 65 prayer points (35 with a spectral spirit shield) when the attack starts to block all three attacks.\n\nIn order to block the attack, it must be prayed against before the spirit attacks.\n\nIf Cerberus is killed when the spirits are summoned, they will despawn upon attempting to attack the player. Note that any spirits that attack just as she dies will still damage the player, so pray accordingly if this happens.\n\nA summoned soul using melee\n\nA summoned soul using magic\n\nA summoned soul using ranged\n\nLava pools[edit | edit source]\n\nThis attack only occurs when Cerberus is below 200 health, is indicated by her howling Grrrrrrrrrrrrrr and is used every fifth attack.\n\nThree lava pools are deployed when this attack is initiated – one on the player's location, and two at random parts of the area.\n\nThe pools have a 3x3 AoE (1 tile from the centre).\n\nStanding in its radius when it is spawned deals 10 damage.\n\nStanding directly on a pool deals 15 damage every two ticks.\n\nStanding adjacent to a pool deals 7 damage every two ticks.\n\nAntifire Protection will reduce the prolonged damage taken if you stay within range of the pools, as demonstrated by the table below.[1]\n\nIf the player is outside of melee range, there is enough time to react to the animations of the pools forming to move out the way.\n\nIf the player is in melee range, there is not enough time to dodge the pool unless the player is already running as the attack begins.\n\nAfter a few seconds, the lava pools will dissipate.\n\nIf Cerberus is killed, the lava pools will stop dealing damage.\n\nAnti-fire protection against lava pools Protections Used Max Hits Names Adjacent Direct N/A N/A N/A None 7 15 Anti-dragon shield 6 12 Protect from Magic 7 15 Antifire potion 7 15 Super antifire potion 5 11 Anti-dragon shield\n\nProtect from Magic 6 12 Antifire potion\n\nAnti-dragon shield 6 12 Super antifire potion\n\nAnti-dragon shield 5 11 Antifire potion\n\nProtect from Magic 6 12 Super antifire potion\n\nProtect from Magic 5 11 Antifire potion\n\nProtect from Magic\n\nAnti-dragon shield 6 12 Super antifire potion\n\nProtect from Magic\n\nAnti-dragon shield 5 11\n\nAttack pattern[edit | edit source]\n\nCerberus has a special attack pattern that determines how she uses her attacks.\n\nAs mentioned in each attack section, Cerberus' mechanics are initiated after the following, quickly summarized here:\n\nThe triple attack is performed as the first attack, then after every ten normal attacks.\n\nThe summoned souls attack is performed every seventh attack, but only after Cerberus has under 400 hitpoints.\n\nThe lava pools are deployed every fifth attack, but only after Cerberus has under 200 hitpoints.\n\nIf the attacks end up overlapping with each other (e.g a triple attack and summoned souls on attack #21), Cerberus will instead prioritize the attacks in the following order:\n\nTriple attack > Summoned Souls > Lava pools\n\nThere is also a 10% chance that Cerberus will not use the summoned souls or lava pools special attacks when she is supposed to, and will use a regular attack instead.[2]\n\nFire Wall[edit | edit source]\n\nThis serves as a barrier to prevent the player from killing Cerberus from afar.\n\nIt does not disappear unless the player dies fighting her.\n\nMoving over the fire wall deals 5 damage each time the player passes through it.\n\nAuto-healing[edit | edit source]\n\nCerberus is unattackable when she first spawns, only becoming so when she stands up.\n\nIf no players are in her chamber, she will return to her idle stance, fully restoring all lost hitpoints.\n\nGeneral strategy[edit | edit source]\n\nWhile fighting Cerberus, it is recommended to activate Protect from Magic.\n\nFor the most kills per hour, the player should be on the Arceuus spellbook for thralls and bring a book of the dead. If using melee, you can optionally bring soul and death runes for Death Charge for more frequent special attacks but less space for supplies. Runes to cast Ward of Arceuus can be considered as well, although beware the spell will not reduce damage inflicted by Summoned Souls or by standing in lava pools.[3] Otherwise, no spells are needed and you do not need to bring any runes. If you are suiciding supplies into the room for longer trips, bring alch runes.\n\nAs a hellhound-type boss, Cerberus has high offensive stats (220) but has a low Defence level (100). She is weak to melee attacks, primarily crush-based ones. She is slightly resistant to stab attacks and resistant against slash, magic and ranged attacks. As a demonic creature, she is also weak to Arclight, which should be set to stab if it is used. Despite her resistance to ranged, ranged weapons can still be extremely effective against her, in particular the twisted bow.\n\nUpon spawning, Cerberus cannot be attacked; rather, she only has an examine option as she is sitting. Once she detects a player in the arena, she will stand up to confront the intruder and become attackable. If no players are present inside, she will return to the centre of her chamber and her attack option will be removed, which will also restore all of her health if damaged.\n\nIt is recommended to deal damage as quickly as possible while taking note of Cerberus' attacks. The most common cause of death is the lava pool and soul combo, regardless of which one comes first. For example, during attacks 14 and 15, Cerberus will summon souls first, then follow up this attack with lava pools. The pools usually disorient players as they try to avoid them and eat up, forgetting about the souls who can deal heavy or fatal damage in the process. Simply count Cerberus' attacks and deal with the spirits as highest priority. Ranged users usually have an advantage over melee users since the targeted pool is not applied on the same tick Cerberus initiates the mechanic, giving them more time to move away from the pool and granting their full attention to the incoming souls. Melee users will simply need to count the attacks and try to avoid running into any other pools in place.\n\nThe summoned souls are the most tedious part of the fight, as they cause heavy, unavoidable damage/drain; an unblocked hit deal 30 damage, while a blocked one drains 30 prayer instead, which can significantly cut into profits and supplies. Having a spectral spirit shield halves the drain to both prolong trips and increase overall profit. While very expensive and only particularly useful for melee users, an elysian spirit shield can reduce the damage each soul from 30 to 22.\n\nIt is recommended to start each Cerberus kill standing underneath her and attacking her from there.\n\nCerberus attacks on a six-tick (3.6s) cycle, while a scythe attacks on a five-tick (3.0s) cycle. It is possible to hit Cerberus twice for every attack she makes due to this by going under her for a few ticks, then coming out to attack. This significantly increases the scythe's damage and minimises the amount of attacks Cerberus can perform. With high hits and proper execution, this will remove a lot of the boss' health, and in some cases, even kill her before she can summon souls.\n\nNo Ghosts Strategy[edit | edit source]\n\nA slower but less resource intensive strategy (particularly for ironmen who don't have a spectral spirit shield or hardcore ironmen who want to avoid dealing with the lava pools and ghosts at once), the player can hit Cerberus to just above 400 hitpoints and wait until the 14th attack (~56 seconds) which ensures no ghosts will appear until the 28th attack. This will reduce prayer potion usage to about two doses per kill if prayer flicking is used while waiting for the 14th attack. It is recommended to put on defensive gear, such as a Dinh's bulwark, and step away from Cerberus while waiting for the 14th attack to minimise damage taken while waiting. If you make a mistake and bring Cerberus' health below 400 before attack #14, you can safely reset the fight by walking back over the entrance flames.\n\nHere is a summary of Cerberus' attacks leading up to Attack 28. You can practice this rotation by counting from the checkpoint special attacks (Combo, Lava, & Ghost attacks). For example, you want to keep Cerberus above 400 hitpoints until attack #14, so start counting 3 attacks after her second combo before resuming damage. Note that the soul and lava mechanics on attacks 25 and 28 are still conditional based on Cerberus's hitpoints, but you will struggle to end the fight before souls if Cerberus still has over 200 HP at attack 25.\n\n# Attack Condition Note(s) 1 COMBO Be wary of attacks 14 and 15 (GHOSTS followed by LAVA), as the dangerous parts of each happen at the same time.\n\nFor the No Ghosts strategy, keep Cerberus' hitpoints above 400 until 14's animation begins.\n\n2 Auto N/A 3 Auto N/A 4 Auto N/A 5 LAVA Only if < 200 HP 6 Auto N/A 7 GHOSTS Only if < 400 HP 8 Auto N/A 9 Auto N/A 10 LAVA Only if < 200 HP 11 COMBO 12 Auto N/A 13 Auto N/A 14 GHOSTS Only if < 400 HP 15 LAVA Only if < 200 HP For the No Ghosts strategy, high DPS sometimes results in LAVA right before COMBO on attacks 20 and 21. 16 Auto N/A 17 Auto N/A 18 Auto N/A 19 Auto N/A 20 LAVA Only if < 200 HP 21 COMBO After the third COMBO, dodge LAVA on attack 25 and race DPS to kill Cerberus before GHOSTS on attack 28. 22 Auto N/A 23 Auto N/A 24 Auto N/A 25 LAVA Only if < 200 HP 26 Auto N/A 27 Auto N/A 28 GHOSTS Only if < 400 HP\n\nDharok's Armour 'Red-Click' Strategy[edit | edit source]\n\nAnother strategy that is less resource-intensive (particularly for ironmen who don't have a spectral spirit shield) is to equip the Dharok's armour set, and to flinch Cerberus and use the 'red-click' strategy to stall the boss. This is done by lowering the player's Health to 1 (using a rock cake or locator orb) to maximize the damage from Dharok's armour, attacking Cerberus, walking under the boss in the next game tick, and then performing a 'red-click' (also known colloquially as 'red-x') by clicking on the exit portcullis (which the player cannot reach while the boss is active, thus the character does not walk out from under the boss). When done successfully, this will cause Cerberus to not move while the player is standing under her. Then, upon waiting for Cerberus' health bar to disappear, the player can repeat this pattern to attack Cerberus again without the boss retaliating. With reduced HP, maximum combat level, boosted stats, Piety, and proper equipment, the player can land a max hit of 99 on Cerberus.\n\nIf using Runelite, this method can be made more efficient using the Menu Entry Swapper plug-in, allowing the player to re-map their shift-click on Cerberus to walk under the boss, negating the need for the player to right-click and select \"Walk here\".\n\nWhen using this method, the player does not need to be concerned about the boss' special attacks (ghosts or lava), as the boss never performs its initial attack. This means the only supplies consumed throughout the boss kills are boost potions, and potions to restore prayer from offensive prayers. This method is not recommended for Hardcore Ironmen, as a small mistake can lead to the boss attacking the player and likely killing them.\n\nSuggested skills[edit | edit source]\n\n85+ Attack\n\n70+ Strength (85+ recommended)\n\n85+ Defence\n\n75+ Ranged\n\n70+ Prayer (Piety, 74+ Rigour)\n\n76 Magic and completion of A Kingdom Divided (if using thralls; 80 for Death Charge)\n\nEquipment[edit | edit source]"
