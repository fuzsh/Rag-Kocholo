        "text": "Gene Wolfe is one of a handful of science fiction writers who have consistently produced work of the highest ambition and achievement over the last quarter-century. His 1972 novel, ''The Fifth Head of Cerberus,'' married a timely concern with the war in Vietnam to a timeless meditation on the abuses of power. Since then, he has focused his energies on multivolume novels with unabashedly religious themes. His masterly ''Book of the New Sun,'' set in a future so distant that magic and technology are indistinguishable, dealt with the sacrifices necessary for human redemption. A similar preoccupation animates the four-volume ''Book of the Long Sun,'' which concludes with EXODUS FROM THE LONG SUN (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95).\n\nThis time the setting is a starship whose inhabitants have forgotten they are on a journey. The starship, which they call the Whorl, is their entire universe, and its legendary creators are gods who speak to them from time to time through Sacred Windows (which the reader will recognize as remnants of the ship's internal communication system). The central character, one of Mr. Wolfe's most appealing creations, is Patera Silk, a modest priest who learns the truth about the Whorl and must prepare his people for the necessary flight from the familiar to the unknown.\n\nText:\n\nIn synopsis Mr. Wolfe's extended novels inevitably sound like religious allegories. Indeed, anyone bent on exegesis may enjoy picking apart the Olympian Greek and Judeo-Christian elements embedded in the dominant creed of the Whorl. But the narrative is actually driven by the all-too-human passions of Silk, his friends and his enemies, and by the unpredictable evolution of Silk's faith following his discovery about the origins of the gods, including the elusive deity known as the Outsider.\n\nMy only complaint is that Mr. Wolfe does not devote sufficient time to exploring the relationship between the humans of the Whorl and their robot and android shipmates, whose origins as sentient beings raise even more interesting questions about the mystery of creation. Since the last pages of the novel hint at further sequels, perhaps Mr. Wolfe intends to pursue this subject at greater length.\n\nDamon Knight has been a science fiction writer, editor and critic for more than five decades. He is perhaps best known as the editor of Orbit, a series of hard-cover anthologies of original stories by authors like Gene Wolfe, R. A. Lafferty and Kate Wilhelm. From its debut in 1966 to its final issue in 1980, Orbit was arguably the most influential ''magazine'' in the field.\n\nMr. Knight's latest novel, HUMPTY DUMPTY: An Oval (Tor/Tom Doherty, $22.95), is a revelation. Funny and disturbing, it invites comparison to the most accomplished works of Philip K. Dick. Its protagonist, Wellington Stout, wakes up in a hospital with a bullet in his head. This turns out to be the least of his problems.\n\nWhat he once thought of as reality has become queasily malleable. Or has he simply begun to see through the veil of illusion to a deeper reality? Other people keep insisting that he holds the answers to these and other questions, like why the voices in his head seem to have been scripted by James Joyce.\n\nHis own attempts to make sense of his perceptions run afoul of various malign (or benign) forces, none more terrifying (or liberating) than the conspiratorial Dentists with a capital ''D.'' At best, Stout's is a world of ambiguous comforts, as when a dubious figure who purports to know the truth says, ''Let me tell you that you're no crazier than meself.'' Mr. Knight's most inspired riffs have an improvisational quality; part of the fun is seeing what associational games he will play and where they will lead him. But there is never any question that you are in the hands of someone who takes his fun seriously.\n\nLike Damon Knight, Frederik Pohl was a member of the Futurians, a science fiction club active in New York in the late 1930's and early 40's whose membership included Isaac Asimov, James Blish and Judith Merril. Mr. Pohl has been an inventive writer, editor and agent, and a world-trotting ambassador for science fiction on four continents. His most recent novel is THE OTHER END OF TIME (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95).\n\nDan Dannerman is a Government agent in an economically pinched near-future America that has trouble paying him a decent salary, much less funding a regular space program. Through family connections, he gets a seat on a privately financed rocket that uncovers a nest of aliens on an abandoned space station. Kidnapped, Dannerman and his companions find themselves in the middle of a war for control of the universe -- a conflict that ranges from the Big Bang to the Big Crunch and apparently centers on the ''eschaton,'' which one group of aliens helpfully explains is what ''ordinary people have been used to calling 'Heaven.' '' To find out more, you will have to read the promised sequel.\n\nMr. Pohl has written some compelling science fiction novels, including ''Gateway,'' ''Man Plus'' and ''The Space Merchants'' (with C. M. Kornbluth). To my mind, ''The Other End of Time'' is not likely to join them.\n\nStarting in 1950 with the publication of his collection of linked stories, ''The Dying Earth,'' Jack Vance has specialized in the exploration of decadence. His vividly articulated vision of a farfuture Earth whose inhabitants have nothing to do but play extravagantly while their sun wanes has influenced an entire generation of science fiction writers, including Gene Wolfe.\n\nIn NIGHT LAMP (Tor/Tom Doherty, $23.95), Mr. Vance is at the top of his form. The decadent world here is called Fader. Freed from arduous labor by a genetically engineered underclass, its inhabitants devote their lives to social niceties and esthetic display. They are surrounded by fearsome dangers of their own making, yet they lack the will to change or move.\n\nMr. Vance is a writer who believes that more is more. Before he takes us to Fader we get a tour of other planets whose social customs exhibit similar symptoms of decadence, but without the terminal stagnation. I was especially fond of the status-besotted society whose highest rungs are occupied by members of an exclusive club known as the Clam Muffins."
