        "text": "Went a bit mad with the Proraso sandalwood cream today so I've gone for the full Brush of the Day shot with my Semogue Owners Club. Not as beautifully formed as Chard would do, but at silly o'clock I couldn't be faffed. Needless to say I had plenty of lather for my 3 passes and still enough to feel bad about washing away.\n\nHawk V3A and Feather Pro (4).\n\nA splash of TGS Royal Lime witch hazel AS. The shave must have been close because even that stung! Face feeler alright.\n\nSOTD: 24th November 2022.\n\n​\n\nShaving recipe for today.\n\nPrep: Warm shower:/ Nivea Men Power Shower Gel.\n\nPre:\n\nCold wet flannel to my face.\n\nPalmolive Naturals Olive & Milk Bar Soap.\n\nBrush: Yaqi 24mm Naples Tuxedo Synthetic.\n\nFace Lather.\n\nLather: Lea Shave Stick.\n\nBlade: Treet Trig Silver Edge. (D2) (Green cover)\n\nRazor: Baili BD 191.\n\nPost:\n\nCold water face wash with brush squeezing's, Cold Water Face Rinse.Cold Water Face Rinse. / /Alum Rub. /Cold Water Rinse. Homemade (~Autumn/Winter mix~) peppermint lavender, eucalyptus, + Tea Tree essential Oils Mixed Together With 200ml of Care+Witch Hazel. / Cien Aqua ASL + Sensitive ASB.\n\nGreetings,\n\nEarly Morning Shave,\n\nAn enjoyable smooth mild shave to finish my shaving week off.\n\nAll of the razors i have used throughout the week have provided me with comfortable mild yet efficient acceptable error-free shaves. The star clone razor of the week was the Kanzy K100 of which will be added again to my razor rotation in my up-and-coming SOTD's.\n\nLike the K100 & BD177, the Baili BD 191 has a \"closed head design \"which gives extra protection and risk of catching my ear lobes or under my nose with the blade ends when shaving.\n\nThe weight of the razor makes it 'bottom heavy 'due to the hefty weight of the handle, which does all the work with no pressure needed when shaving.\n\nMy only small gripe with the Baili BD 191 is the handle is slippery when wet. Nevertheless, it's still a great everyday shaver.\n\nA comfortable 2 pass + pick-ups shave with no errors to report.\n\nFinishing to the shave off with a few small dollops of Cien Sensitive ASB.\n\nMy face is feeling smooth cool & smelling divine.\n\nKeep safe and enjoy your day ladies & gentlemen.\n\nThursday 24th November\n\nPicked up what appeared to me to be an unused Culmak bristle brush and Culmak soap puck on the Bay for under a tenner the pair. The soap weight that was on the label is shown only in ounces so that should date it to maybe the 70s? I was a bit unsure about how the soap and brush would perform. I needn’t have worried, it lathered quickly and creamily with the bristle which was surprisingly soft considering its age. It has a mild scent which I would describe as “babs”, “bygone age barber shop”, which I quite like, and especially as it doesn’t clash with a scented aftershave (More later).\n\nThe Jagger DE86 (with Gillette silver blue ) gives a very mild shave. I like this so as to give a variation on daily shaves and to give my delicate skin a rest. In fact the razor is so mild I found myself swishing away in a manner that I certainly wouldn’t do with some of my other let’s say more aggressive razors.\n\nDabbed on Layrite Deluxe No. 9 Bay Rum. The label encourages you to splash it all over….” and smell like you just left the barber shop“. Maybe, but the dominant scent to me seems to be cloves, so then only if you want to smell like mom’s apple pie\n\nHave a great day fellas,\n\n24-Nov\n\nBrush: DG Cerberus Fougere B15\n\nSoap: Cerberus Fougere\n\nRazor: Lambda Athena\n\nBlade: GSB (1)\n\nPost: Cerberus Fougere AS & EDP\n\nThat was a hell of a shave, new acquisition of the B15, I was initially concerned as I was getting a very weak lather but managed to get the balance right and got a cracking lather. Think it might be a slightly hungrier knot at 28mm vs my normal 26mm. But it has a very natural feel which I like, initially thought it was a bit stabby but ended up splaying nicely.\n\nThe lambda is fantastic, very smooth and efficient. The fit and finish is second to none not to mention the packaging and really punches above its price point, or potentially it is appropriately priced and certain others are priced above their punch point (not a phrase I know but you get my meaning). Either which way very happy with the purchase.\n\nI did have some initial issues when the lambda arrived the other week with a slightly damaged box and top cap. Dropped a line to Theo and he sorted it out sending me a replacement for both FOC which arrived in quick time yesterday, he had offered to send me either whole razor setup or parts but I didn't want to take the mick...really cannot fault the customer service...I'll be keeping an eye out on any new developments coming from him!\n\nHope everyone has a grand day!\n\nCheers\n\nMarc\n\nSOTD: 24/11/2022\n\nRazor: Aylsworth Drakkant\n\nBlade: Astra SP, 3rd use\n\nBrush: Yaqi 24mm Aqua Highmountain Silvertip Badger\n\nBowl: 3D Printed Bowl\n\nPreshave: PAA Cube Unscented Soap\n\nSoap: Tabac Original Puck\n\nAftershave: Tabac Original Cologne\n\nBalm: L’Oreal Men Expert Reinforcing Aftershave Balm\n\nAdditional Care: Osma Laboratoires Alum Block\n\nDay one with the Drakkant standard plate.

Lee you should be satisfied with what you have already. Lee you are not a magpie stop being impressed by new shiny toys. Lee are you taking this in? Are you listening?\n\nOr are you focusing on the fantastic knurled and chunky handle, that feels even better than it looks! Or focusing on how well it’s finished and the amazing way the plates clamp the blade? Or the way the head is designed and angled for you so you can easily find the correct angle of attack? Or the weight and balance being just spot on?\n\nIt’s the later isn’t it Lee, all of the latter. One shave in and it’s amazing, yes it’s on quite the mild side of efficiency scale but it’s an amazing daily shaver. I’m going to try it out another day on this plate before moving to the Plus which I think will be just as pleasant but overall this is a bit of a winner for me!\n\nView attachment 96678\n\nSOTD: 24/11/2022\n\nRazor: Aylsworth Drakkant\n\nBlade: Astra SP, 3rd use\n\nBrush: Yaqi 24mm Aqua Highmountain Silvertip Badger\n\nBowl: 3D Printed Bowl\n\nPreshave: PAA Cube Unscented Soap\n\nSoap: Tabac Original Puck\n\nAftershave: Tabac Original Cologne\n\nBalm: L’Oreal Men Expert Reinforcing Aftershave Balm\n\nAdditional Care: Osma Laboratoires Alum Block\n\nDay one with the Drakkant standard plate.
