C2 Kazuha with FS and the abyss blessing, but 250k CA damage at C0 is insane no matter which way you slice it. I don't think I could reach that even when I ascend mine to C1 lol...\n\nI agree with you but CA damage in Abyss is hyperinflated right now. My Hu Tao was doing 300k and killed some enemies in one CA with a vape crit. I think the highest I'd hit before this abyss with 204k.\n\nOkay I guess she has hit that hard before. I don't remember what the 2023 / 4 run was:\n\nRaiden's been doing most of my big hits lately (2023 / 10 is similar, 310k crit from Raiden).\n\nHighest recorded Raiden\n\nI agree with you but CA damage in Abyss is hyperinflated right now.

I wasn't really aiming to compare Wrio to other characters, so much as I was comparing Wallenstein to other players. I've been watching a lot of Wrio gameplay to see all the different comps, and I haven't seen anyone get close to 200k at C0. The highest I've seen was the 180k that Csr posted the other day.\n\nOh yeah for sure, that's why I prefaced that.

The highest I've seen was the 180k that Csr posted the other day.\n\nI'm pretty sure Hu Tao can match or exceed that at C0, but again it's because of the inflation.\n\nSay it with me.\n\n👏Maybe👏The👏True👏Archon👏Was👏The👏Neuvillette👏We👏Pulled👏Along👏The👏Way👏\n\nI have said it before and i will say it again, Neuvillette is the true protagonist of genshin impact, he is such a gigachad the first three years of the game was just a prologue leading up to him.\n\nZhongli who? Venti what? Raiden? Never heard of her.\n\nDude isn't the hydro archon, he is the one true archon, the one to rule them all.\n\nYou can try it now, especially in the current Abyss 12-1-2 and 12-3-2 (12-2-2 is trickier because the boss doesn't attack constantly).\n\nView: https://streamable.com/b74fp9\n\nCritkomi build. She will have effective 48% CR if the condition for Hunter set is met.\n\nHer teammate is Kazuha (VV set, ER sand, Xiphos), Yun Jin (mixed build with 210% ER, 2400 DEF, Fav lance), Xinqiu (EoSF, Sac Sword).\n\nIt would have been better if Yun Jin used Archaic Petra set because AP would also buff Xinqiu but I don't have a good set yet. Yelan instead of YunJin might also be better but then one would argue it was a Yelan team instead XD.\n\nIf Furina can burn teammate's HP fast enough to activate other character's Hunter set, Kokomi will have a much more consistent Crit and can even use a shield (optimally Archaic Petra Zhongli imo).\n\nThanks for the clip and build! I'll wait for Furina to arrive before I invest in crit artifacts, only because I'm still farming artis for the archon. 😅\n\nAlso, I feel that my Yun Jin is under-utilised and having another team to play her in would be nice (in lieu of Zhongli, when I feel like it).\n\nThanks for the clip and build!

So if you are farming for someone else, it's natural that you prioritize that.\n\nI'm only attempting this build because those are pieces from my M.Hunter and Golden Troupe farming (for Neuvilette and Furina).\n\nMy Golden Troupe luck has been terrible so far though. 😓\n\nSuper late response, but - when I'm playing a little bit less like now, I'll generally wait until the event is all there and I can tackle it in one go.\n\nTypically I'd do it as it became available though. I generally don't mind commissions but I do wish they'd lock you into a chain like Star Rail.\n\nIt's disheartening to keep hoping for the next stage of the chain to randomly pop up one day. It can take weeks sometimes.\n\nStill, maybe that's something they'll look at in the future.\n\nIdk about previous region's commissions but Fontaine story commissions don't make you wait long for continuation.\n\nI did all story commissions in that region already because the next part of the story often occurs the next day or the day after that.\n\nOmg the craziest thing just happened. Alkez remember how I said yesterday I was gonna wait 'til the end of Wrizzly's banner to decide on getting his C1? Well this evening I was just casually playing and tripped and fell on my controller, causing it to do a 10 pull accidentally. 7 times. And then 8 more singular pulls somehow. So now I join you and Tyaren in the C1 club. At 35k primos now... lowest amount I've had in a while. No regrets though!! Only the 2nd limited character I've got constellations for. And tbh after looking at his other constellations I see myself going for more on his rerun I have no willpower with this man halp.\n\nI did some singles and lucked into Wrio. Can't spare the gems to go for his weapon or C1 right now, since my eyes are on Furina. I'll get him to 90 though, and give him Skyward Atlas just to play around with him. Maybe I'll consider getting c1/weapon on a rerun. Wasn't gonna go for him at all, but it was only a few wishes so here we are!\n\nI did really like his story quest. His origin was pretty dark and sad. Also was that the first firearm we have seen used? I seem to remember maybe 1 or 2 others. Wish we'd get a firearm character.\n\nDo we know how Furina's hydro application compares to C6 Xingqiu?\n\nHaha all good.\n\nOmg the craziest thing just happened.

The way I actually thought you were going to say you tripped and lucked the C1 hahaha. Congrats on getting it! 35k is 20k more than me right now 😅\n\nI'm actually liking Neuv with two geo dudes. Passive damage from both albedo's flower and the geo constructs, as well as resistance shred and crystal damage buff. Also, plenty durable cause of the shields. Even took off my hydro goblet and I'm running a HP goblet on Neuv. Kinda regret not getting Zhongli C1 as that would have been an extra construct and cover more of the field. Next experiment will be to have both Albedo and Zhong on Petra sets to make it easier for rotations in terms of who's grabbing crystals and to see if it works\n\nView: https://streamable.com/gegfom\n\nOmg the craziest thing just happened.

O: Seven times over and eight times just a little bit. What are the odds of lucking out and getting that C1 Wrizzby?!\n\nCongrats! :)\n\nWay less. Less than Yelan's too\n\nOh? How are they making up for it? Haven't followed her leaks much. I just know she has archon-typical fancy animations and is Jesus on water, lol.\n\nOh? How are they making up for it? Haven't followed her leaks much. I just know she has archon-typical fancy animations and is Jesus on water, lol.\n\nShe has good damage with her pets and has huge team-wide universal damage buff (up to 75% at C0, 100% at C1). 75% damage buff is equal to what Emblem of Severed Fate set provides at 300% ER.\n\nShe also buffs healing bonus and burns teammate's HP to buff her pet's damage, which is beneficial to Fontainian characters with HP manipulation mechanic and might enable non-Fontaine characters to use Marechaussee Hunter set.

Sometimes my favorite part of this game is seeing all the beautiful or funny stuff Genshin content creators make.\n\nOh? How are they making up for it? Haven't followed her leaks much. I just know she has archon-typical fancy animations and is Jesus on water, lol.\n\nMain thing is she brings a pretty big damage buff to your team based on HP fluctuations, and she drains your hp which will make team healers a lot more important in her teams. She also does pretty good damage herself, and while her hydro app isn't super high, her skill last a long time (like all archons) and it fires automatically without needing normal attacks like Xingqiu and Yelan, so that's a nice bonus. Overall she's extremely strong but is all about making your team more at risk in exchange for more damage\n\n75%-100% damage buff?! O: I guess they weren't sure how to top all prior archons in terms of benefit anymore, so they just slapped this insane buff on her, lol.\n\nIt's not 75% - 100% all the time. When any character in your team's HP increases or decreases, Furina gains stacks, and the amount she buffs is relative to the amount of stacks she has (0.25%* number of stack). At C0, the max stack count is 300 so the max buff is 75% but it will need time to ramp up. At C1, she always starts at 150 stacks (37.5% damage buff) and the max stack count is 400 (100% damage buff).\n\nThe nice thing about Furina's buff is that it's universal, which means she can buff even Anemo, Geo or Physical, which are the elements that lack a big buffer like Kazuha. It also doesn't matter if your characters use NA/CA/Plunge/Skill/Burst, Furina will buff them all.\n\nI also found this beautiful thing:\n\nrofl, so hilarious. Thanks for sharing.

Overall she's extremely strong but is all about making your team more at risk in exchange for more damage\n\nI see... Despite being strong she sounds like a character (including team compositions) that I probably wouldn't enjoy or use much, contrary to all archons before, who I all extensively use/used.\n\nI still would like to obtain her though, just because she is the archon.\n\nI put that last part in spoilers, because the desire detector/gacha gods mustn't ever know of this. After spending nearly all on Wrio I'll only have a 50/50 chance of obtaining her.\n\nNo biggie at all if I don't get her! I might even be disappointed not getting my C5 Diluc that I never use. Do you hear that, desire detector/gacha gods?!\n\nI only plan to 8/8/8 them.\n\nHe needs to be triple crowned. One crown for each head of Cerberus, the guardian of the underworld.\n\nHe needs to be triple crowned. One crown for each head of Cerberus, the guardian of the underworld.\n\nFurina is claiming the crowns! I may give him at least one like Neuvillette, I just have to see if I'll have some extra after everyone I plan to crown and haven't got to yet is.\n\nSo you also have a unused C4 Diluc?? He better not ruin my 4 50/50 wins in a row again, at least give me C1 Dehya!\n\nView: https://x.com/sagittarius3215/status/1715663078430585212?s=20\n\nI actually pulled for his own weapon because the Widsith giving me the EM buff so many times. Nice to hear Wriothesley's weapon is nice on him.\n\nI was reading Furina's skill descriptions again and I just noticed something that I didn't realise before.\n\n\"The Salon Members and Singer of Many Waters share a duration, and when Furina uses her Charged Attack to change the guest type, the new guests will inherit the initial duration.\"\n\nDoes that mean you can actively swap from damage to healing without using the skill again?\n\nWay less. Less than Yelan's too\n\nAh okay. So no Furina in bloom teams without an additional hydro then.\n\nI was reading Furina's skill descriptions again and I just noticed something that I didn't realise before.\n\n\"The Salon Members and Singer of Many Waters share a duration, and when Furina uses her Charged Attack to change the guest type, the new guests will inherit the initial duration.\"\n\nDoes that mean you can actively swap from damage to healing without using the skill again?\n\nAh okay.

The heal is basically just quality of life for the overworld. In actual rotations in abyss and such, you'd practically never be in that stance"
