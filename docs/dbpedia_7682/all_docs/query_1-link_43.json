One appears as a beauty pageant contestant in \"Eye of the Beholder\" and a few others briefly appear in \"The Hunted\", both episodes taking place in Season 1. Cerberus do not appear in Season 2.\n\nPhysical Appearance[]\n\nCerberuses are just like regular dogs, except that they have three heads instead of one. Their fur is also naturally dyed blue. They can also either have normal or red eyes. Usually, Cerberuses will wear a collar around their necks.\n\nLife in the Magical World[]\n\nInterestingly enough, Cerberuses can either be intelligent creatures capable of speech (as seen in \"Eye of the Beholder\"), or mindless and savage beasts used as hunting dogs (as seen in \"The Hunted\"). The reason for this may be that Cerberuses are naturally intelligent creatures and are usually considered as individuals in the Magical Community. The ones seen in \"The Hunted\" were most probably brainwashed by the Huntsclan to do their biding, a likely hypothesis since the Huntsclan is renown for using magical creatures for their own nefarious purposes.\n\nTrivia[]"
