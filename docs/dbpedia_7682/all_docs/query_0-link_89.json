        "text": "Does your case have both side panels vented?\n\nI was just wondering as they might be able to be swapped from left to right to have the ventilation at the base, not at the top edge.\n\nNo, the other side is solid, didn't see a reason to spend more on vented as PSU in this case is not mounted like the default position in the M1; PSU intakes from the front, not the far side panel.\n\nThat is a good point though, they don't need to be swapped as you can apparently just flip each panel upside down. I will be using my NH-C14S with an A14 iPPC-2000 above the heatsink pulling in air from the side, so I need the vents up top.\n\n@tabascosauz I get where you are coming from with the pricing. I've wanted a Cerberus since they first lunched their kickstarter, but importing one to Norway is well outside of my budget range - once you add shipping costs, customs processing fees and VAT, you're looking at a >US$400 case. Still really want one, though currently I'm thinking I'll move to a Cooler Master NR200 instead. Looking forward to some pics of your build!\n\nTheir shipping is a little ridiculous. $65 for Fedex Economy while Fedex Priority is $75...of course I'll take the faster one lmao. They do have an active coupon code MADEINUSA for ~$25 USD that lasts until COVID is eliminated in the United States, not much, but it's something.\n\nI saw this the other day after they teased the possibility of a Cerberus Mini: https://www.density.sk/product/cerberus#main-color It's all in Euros and from the .sk domain I guess they're the main EU distributor. Would Norway happen to have some kind of special relationship with the EU that would allow you to reduce/eliminate customs fees on European products?\n\nThe NR200 looks like a super nice case for a reasonable price. Only took the mainstream manufacturers 5 years to properly provide the M1 layout for the mainstream.\n\nTheir shipping is a little ridiculous. $65 for Fedex Economy while Fedex Priority is $75...of course I'll take the faster one lmao.

Norway is part of the EEC, which means there are essentially no tariffs on imports from the EU, but that applies to nearly any other (relevant) country too. There is still VAT, which means every import needs to pass through customs to have this calculated, which also adds a customs processing fee (typically in the range of $10-20, depending on the shipping company - yeah, it's ridiculously high). And the VAT is added not just to the product cost, but the shipping cost too! This continues to baffle me, as shipping is a service that mostly takes place before crossing the border, not after ... But I guess it is what it is. There used to be a NOK350 (~35USD) VAT free limit (allowed me to buy a lot of cheap stuff of AliExpress), but that was removed this year due to the planned implementation of an automated VAT processing system for foreign online stores - which isn't likely to be implemented for at least a couple of years still. Real smart that. But not relevant to buying a Cerberus, of course. But with our 25% VAT, ~$100 shipping to Norway, plus processing fees, that would bring the cost of a baseline Cerberus (as configured on their site) to ~US$450 My desired configuration would likely hit $500. So that's a no-go.\n\nThe NR200 is actually a near carbon copy of the layout of the upcoming Dan C4-SFX, including the optional vertical GPU mount and dual PSU mount options. Still, it seems more like a coincidence than an actual rip-off, and most people on the SFF forums are just happy to see a mainstream manufacturer finally make a real SFF case. Low cost + a good worldwide distribution network is definitely a boon for this too.\n\nIsn't that case you linked from the EU distributor just the regular Cerberus? Sliger (who manufactures the Cerberus) has plenty of other cases in both smaller and larger sizes, but AFAIK the next project of Chimaera Industries (designers of the Cerberus, @wahaha360 and @PlayfulPhoenix over on the SFF.network forums) is the CX2 (seemingly not officially an abbreviation for Cerberus X 2, though I don't quite believe that ), a 23l eATX compatible case at a lower price point than the Cerberus. I haven't heard of them working on anything smaller.\n\nYeah, that is a pretty serious shipping fee.

I haven't heard of them working on anything smaller.\n\nYeah, i should have been clearer; density.sk hinted at the idea of a smaller Cerberus on Twitter. Whether it will ever appear is another question altogether. I just linked the Cerberus, thought maybe you could cut some costs if it comes from the EU, but the whole tax on shipping fees sounds pretty insane.\n\nThe NR200 is advertising a pre-order price (comes out 8/15 here) of $110CAD which I think is pretty good. If I'm not mistaken, the NR200 has been in the works for longer than the C4 was made public, but wouldn't be surprised if CM was inspired and later added the vertical GPU.\n\nPersonally, I like the clearance in the NR200 for a Fuma 2 and U12A (but that one fits only theoretically and exactly that height). I was pretty pissed off with the last couple years' wave of sandwich layout cases that completely neglect CPU air cooling. I've flown almost a dozen trips now with the M1 and you couldn't pay me to gamble my entire rig on whether the TSA agent understands what water cooling is. Maybe it's gotten better now that five years later everyone and their mother flies with sandwich SFFs in a duffel.\n\nI know that DAN cases are always built very well but I'm not too impressed with the C4, it just looks like the M1 layout shrunk down to the absolute limit. Best air cooling layout in the M1 uses two 120s in the bottom as main intake and a 92 in the back as either exhaust for a U9S or intake for a C14S. C4 looks like it'll only allow bottom fans if your GPU is deshrouded, which limits GPU choice. I get that he wants this to be unique in that you can flip the entire case, but again GPU thermals there are only good deshrouded with exhaust fans, and CPU temps inverted might suffer without a direct front to back airflow tunnel for the CPU.\n\nI get what he's going for here, but the A4 was much more innovative. Maybe given a little more time to refine this design it'll be a great product.\n\nThings finally turned up now so I would like to share them with you....\n\nAlso what is better than one GTX rad??.......\n\nYeah you guessed it, 3 Sadly they only had 3 in stock and now there's a 60 to 120 day lead time on them so I might have to wait a little while before I can get another!\n\nNow I'm just trying to work out some fan choices for the rad's and for the case, I'm stuck between the Noctua NF-A14 IndustrialPPC 3000rpm fans as I already have 3 of those and for the case I'm going to need 5 more for just the rads. However, they have some of the white Vadar fans on sale direct from EK, the 2000rpm models and I'm toying with some of those for the case as for the rads, you won't really see the Noctua's.... Oh I'm not going to be running these at full speed or anything, I have my small fan controller to take care of that My Lamptron CF525 I'm pretty sure, it'll be able to handle the fans.... On one channel anyways Lamptron CF525 Specs and a quick review right here...\n\nNoctua 140mm PPC Fan specs\n\nEF Vadar 2000rpm fans\n\nI came across these EK 140mm fans as well... but I think they are just a bit over half as powerful as the Noctua's which is a bit of a shame but..... They weren't on offer\n\nThat was also the reason for the two water blocks as well, couldn't decide which to go for for my Crosshair 8 board... That said, I will need to swap out my Viper Steel RAM I think and get something else in there, I've some G Skill TridentZ 3600 C16 stuff, that I know is a good clocking RAM, so I might use that for a little while... At least I can see if the extra MHz is going to gain me any extra performance... We'll see\n\nWhat are anyones thoughts?? I hope that @VSG thinks I made a good choice on the rads.. It was his review that pushed me towards these.\n\nI'll update my build log as soon as I can... I hope soon"
