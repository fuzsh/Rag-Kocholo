        "text": "We traveled to many places together, as he was my vehicle copilot, sitting in the front seat so regal as a Shepherd should. We trained and trialed at many dog shows where he earned his CD title at the young age of 2 yrs old. His CDX at 3 yrs old and his UD title at only 4 yrs old.\n\nHe accomplished a Schutzhund BH, Two AKC Rally Titles, the Canine Good Citizen award and was a registered Therapy Dog through TDI.\n\n​\n\nBoreas, who’s official name is Baaron Von Stickel, CD, CDX, UD, RN, RA, BH, CGC, Tdi had many other names as well. He got the nickname, Munchkin, because we used to drive through the Dunkin Donuts every week on our way to Dog Training and he would stick his head out to the DU operator and they would give him free munchkins….although I think he would have rather had the cookies from McDonalds.\n\n​\n\nHe was also fondly called Bear by the family members, Mom and Frank, Mr. Bizer, by his Vet Tech and very good friend of mine, and in his older age I often referred to him as Bub Bub.\n\n​\n\nHe truly was my best friend and I will miss him every day of my life. Boreas’ soul mate, Emma, will miss him as well. She looked for him the day he left us and I think she is as sad at times, as I am. I can only hope that there is a better place for him now and that he is happy. He will always be in my heart and thoughts.\n\n​\n\nI love you Munchin.\n\nLove,\n\nMom\n\nBoreas consists mostly of West German working lines with the infamous #1 stud dog of all time, Drigon Von Fuhrmanshof as his great-great grandsire. Drigon is a 3x BSP participant with a score of 299 in 1976, 1977, and 1978. He is the son of the 1974 Bundessiger, Enno Antreftal. These dogs have stable confident and high working drives.\n\n​\n\nFenga was bred to Drigon. Fenga, a black Sable, was twice HGH champion in the mid 1970’s. She was an excellent sheep herding dog with a great deal of drive to work. Out of this litter came the infamous “U” litter of Uwe and Uran. (Uwe produced the 1986 Bundessiger Dunja). From there, continuing on the sires side, Uran produced Marko VonDer Siegerland who was owned by Jill Hill and shown at the 1993 North American’s taking 4th place with 97-95-95, total 287 V rating. Also shown in 1994 at the SchH3 Nationals taking a tie for 5th with 99-94-94, total 287 V Rating.\n\n​\n\nAlso on the sires side in Baaron’s lines is Boss VonDer Maineiche who is a 2x BSP participant and half brother to Neck VonDer Maineich (BSP) Their father, Xento is a 1x BSP participant. Xento’s father, Older Von der Maineiche is the sire of the infamous Marko Vom Cellerland. Marko won the 1972 SV German Sieger (Working Show Lines Pedigree) and placed 4th in 1971 and 1973.\n\nAs for Baaron, I was not familiar with SchH when I obtained him at 4 months old from my breeder Elizabeth Bradley, who is a top SchH competitor. I decided to compete with him in AKC Obedience in which he excelled earning his UD by the Age of 4. His accomplishments speak for themselves as\n\n​\n\nCD: Companion Dog: Age: 1 yr.(3 for 3 Shows)10/17/99 :: Score 176 :: 2nd Place 10/31/99 :: Score187 :: 2nd Place\n\n11/14/99 :: Score1881/2 :: 3rd Place\n\n11/21/99 :: Score 190 :: 1st Place\n\nCDX: Companion Dog Excellent:\n\nAge: 2yrs.10/29/00 :: Score 180.5 :: 1st Place 11/12/00 :: Score 1881/2 :: 5th Place\n\n(Highest Scoring GSD)\n\n4/21/01 :: Score 190 :: 4th Place\n\n(Highest Scoring GSD)\n\nUD: Utility Dog: Age: 4yrs.10/13/02 :: Score 187.5 :: 1st Place 2/28/03 :: Score 191 :: 2nd Place\n\n(Highest Scoring GSD w/CGC)\n\n5/24/03 :: Score 183 :: 1st Place\n\nOther Entries: 01/10/04 :: Open B :: Score 194 :: 5th Place 02/21/04 :: Utility B :: Score 191 :: 4th Place\n\n10/10/04 :: Open B :: Score 196 ½ :: 2nd Place"
