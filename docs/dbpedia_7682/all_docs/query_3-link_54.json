        "text": "Mark of the Fool is a fun slow read, just the way I like it.\n\nThe story is good overall, grammar is gud, narrative is gud, etc. People seem to nitpick this story based on their expectation that is pretty fucking bias. But the one that got me hooked into reading is the world building, it is just so fucking well done with the layers and layers of lore you keep stacking on the proverbial cake.\n\nAlso the characters are not flat and 2 dimensional as some of the reviews have said, a good example is Selena Roth, she's the adorable little sister that is growing up to be more mature and a source of worry, and as someone who have little sisters to watched out for: you got her fucking character so right, that it's painful to read, my own 2 sisters also act the same in some capacity minus the trauma, she's annoying yet easy to get along with.\n\nTldr: you can't build a castle in a rush. And oh boy The Fool is a castle in the making.\n\nMark of the Fool is a wish fulfillment story about a young wizard excelling at his studies at a magical university, in large part thanks to a divine mark that was supposed to prevent him from practising spellcraft in the first place, by means that bypass the most severe of his restrictions. Along the way, he makes friends, finds love and has to face past traumas not only of his own, but those of his young sister as well.\n\nI like this premise. It is a good, solid premise (even if a bit generic). The issue here lies not with the author failing to deliver on said premise, but on the fact that the premise itself doesn't become obvious until after the first story arc has already unfolded. While the intended direction of the story is explicitly stated in the description, the first arc pushes forward a different set of \"promises\" (if I were to use Mr. Sanderson's phraseology).\n\nWhile hints of what the story is truly going to be like are present from the very beginning, the first chapter establishes a different setting, but more importantly— a different conflict that the main character needs to deal with. Theoretically, the first arc follows the standard Hero's Journey format where an ordinary village boy goes through a call to action sequence and needs to adjust to new, adverse circumstances. Important story elements are introduced throughout, as well as some characters that bear relevance down the line, but ultimately this serves to paint a picture that misrepresents what the story is actually going to be like for the vast majority of chapters that follow— which, I suspect, is the reason for many of the 'less than stellar' reviews that are written by readers who dropped the story early on.\n\nThis is unfortunate, because I find both the story, style and pacing that the story assumes from that point on to be quite enjoyable.\n\nWhile the first major plot twist\n\nSpoiler :\n\nMC deciding to disregard his heroic duties\n\nalmost feels like a subversion of the trope, nothing else in the story does.\n\nThere are a few other issues as well. I find the justification for MC being able to get over the Mark's interference while learning and casting spells, but being unable to cope with its interference while trying to use offensive spells baffling. Yes, some justification for that is mentioned, but I do not find it fully relatable considering the ease with which the MC casts certain spells later on in the story. I would have preferred if the MC explored his limitations a bit more thoroughly on screen, rather than simply getting used to them considering those limitations are soft rather than hard.\n\nI also find descriptions in the story to be slightly unbalanced. There are characters that have been an integral part of the story for hundreds of chapters, but have not yet been described in any significant detail (e.g. I still have no idea what professor Jules actually looks like, but I might have simply missed it. Couldn't find a description in the chapter she was introduced, as opposed to Valrok who has been described quite well IMO), yet stand in stark contrast with occasional almost cinematic sequences lasting paragraphs about what a location or an event looks like.\n\nOther than that, the story has a lot of strong points too. I like that virtually all named characters are used repeatedly in the story. The pacing makes for a relaxing read, and most characters are both decently believable and enjoyable, even if not particularly deep. Story arcs tie into each other seamlessly and established conflicts tend to be addressed, even if my issue with the first arc still stands.\n\nUltimately, this is a wish fulfillment story first and foremost. If you're looking for something else, you will not find it here. If you're looking for a good relaxing read about an MC that makes the most of what he was given, you might enjoy it."
