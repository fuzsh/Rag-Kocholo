Surprised there's not more chatter around his buddy Chastain (his discovery, Salome herself) as one of the daughters, that would very much work I'd think.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nIsn't Chastain a bit too old for Cordelia now?.She's 41,she might be a better fit for one of the other 2 Sisters.\n\nYeah, I don't think she'll actually be in it but we'll see - I think it was more of a wish thing with her - she'd fit Goneril more definitely.\n\nYou have to be really careful with how you cast all these parts anyway - Pacino is not an ideal actor to play Lear, surround him with great Shakespearean actors (Rylance etc) he gets his thunder stolen maybe, surround him with lesser actors and he dominates wrongfully or it looks amateurish.\n\nIt becomes very much finding people who mesh with him.......\n\nPost by Mattsby on\n\nAn interview with Pacino's close friend and producing partner Barry Navidi from Jan 27;\n\nmabigmovies.com/2019/01/27/interview-with-filmmaker-barry-navidi/\n\nNot a great interviewer, but Navidi says John Huston and Brando were his mentors, and mentions Lear is in the \"near future\" as well as Modigliani which I suppose is still in the works for them, a project Pacino has been involved with one way or another since the '80s!\n\nAndreea: What is the current project that you’re working on?\n\nBarry: I am working on a few projects. Modigliani about the great artist and King Lear in the near future with Al Pacino.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nYeah I'm not sure but it seems to me that the IMDB page includes a whole production team maybe it was always that way but I don't remember it.\n\nNavidi needs to update his website but I can't imagine that Isaac will play Modigliani since he just played Gaugin, but you never know. I really think Lear has to come from Al's mouth but I suppose he ain't talking until those OUATIH interviews (see how optimistic I'm being, I'm saying he has a big enough part to actually do interviews for that film\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nIt'll be a massive shame if Pacino doesn't get the chance to do Lear. His seriousness and dedication to classical theatre deserves it, even if he doesn't get to do it in the theatre. And I think playing Lear on stage may have passed him by. His last Broadway appearences in Mamet's China Doll was something of a farce, and it was constantly noted that Pacino needed an earpiece and multiple teleprompters to remember lines. That is understandable at his age on stage as memory starts to become a real issue, but if he can't get away with it for a Mamet, he won't get away with it for Lear. Film, where you can forget and screw up lines and still have a dozen chances to fix things seeme his best bet now.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nChina Doll was something more than that though - I know Mattsby saw it and Viced saw it (and I did as well) and back in the old IMDB days a lot more had also to some acclaim actually - he definitely used the earpiece in act 1 and act 1 was a poorly written mess but act 2 was really mostly great if you stuck with it and a lot of people raved him in that - that's how Tarantino became a fan actually. You had to stay with it.\n\nI'd really love to see him do China Doll on TV - there's genius in that play.......act 2 anyway.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nHe got some good reviews in the media though and more as it went on however ......the real problem with that play is Mamet wouldn't change act 1.\n\nThere's a degree of professionalism to that and he was working hard in that piece - I think actors would like the piece more the general media/theatre crowd who would have felt burned by that first act.........I think back to it mostly fondly because of act 2 and of course it lead to OUATIH ........as often is the case with him, the success or failure of that piece is more complex than it might first appear etc.\n\nPost by Viced on\n\nHis last Broadway appearences in Mamet's China Doll was something of a farce, and it was constantly noted that Pacino needed an earpiece and multiple teleprompters to remember lines.\n\nChina Doll was FAR from a farce. And if anything, Mamet is the one who should take all the blame for its so-so reception. He wrote a very uneven play about a rich guy talking on the phone for 90 minutes... and the main saving grace was Pacino's herculean performance. He had moments there that were so powerful they literally shook me to my core. I haven't seen that many plays, but Pacino in China Doll was the only time I've ever experienced anything that visceral. And I'm pretty sure actors half his age would have needed an earpiece to remember all that shit.\n\nAlso, the totally genuine standing ovation and rapturous applause when it was over really didn't have the feeling of a farce to me.\n\nPost by pupdurcs on\n\nHis last Broadway appearences in Mamet's China Doll was something of a farce, and it was constantly noted that Pacino needed an earpiece and multiple teleprompters to remember lines.\n\nChina Doll was FAR from a farce.

I'm happy it was a joyous experience for you and that's your truth, but I can only go by the general reviews, critics and media/ theatre world fallout from the play and Pacino's performance, which being fair, presented the whole thing as being a farce. I'm not going to post article links, but I've done google searches to refresh my memory, and it was as bad as I remembered. Maybe worse.\n\nPacino was 75 years old. It's an accomplishment for him to be able to get back on stage. I don't hold the earpiece/teleprompter thing against him so much due to his age, but it became a thing in a negative sense. The performance was a disaster for Pacino perception wise, but he's a theatre legend already so it doesn't matter. And it's great that you enjoyed it despite the negativity.\n\nPost by pacinoyes on\n\nHis last Broadway appearences in Mamet's China Doll was something of a farce, and it was constantly noted that Pacino needed an earpiece and multiple teleprompters to remember lines.\n\nChina Doll was FAR from a farce.

The only reason I mentioned it is because it seems to confirm why Pacino isn't just doing Lear on stage. Film finance is tricky (as this product ion is finding out), but someone like Pacino could probably get a Lear stage production put together within a few months. The memory issues from his last stage production seem to be the most logical reason why that won't happen."
