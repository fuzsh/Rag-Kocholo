        "text": "The following edited and excerpted observations were made by Academy Award-winning actor Al Pacino during his question-and-answer session with students following the screenings of his latest feature film \"The Insider\" and the documentary \"Looking for Richard,\" which he starred in, directed and produced.\n\n... How he was drawn to acting.\n\n\"When I was younger, my mother took me to the movies, and I'd act out the parts the next day. It started there. ...\n\n\"I never wanted to be an actor. Then in school, I found out it was a good way of getting out of class. Because I got into the plays I didn't have to do all that other stuff, and I said, 'All right, I'll be an actor.' I knew it was an impossible dream, but I had encouragement when I was in eighth grade. My eighth-grade acting teacher came to my home and said she thought that my grandmother should encourage me. This actually left my memory until later on in life, and I thought, 'Gee, it was this teacher, this eighth-grade teacher, who changed my life.'\"\n\n... Acting in Shakespearean plays.\n\n\"Shakespeare was alien to me growing up. It was something that I wasn't familiar with. It was always communicated to me that you had to be a certain type, you had to have a certain education, to be a certain way, in order to do Shakespeare -- that some kid from the South Bronx, which I was, was unable to do Shakespeare. It had nothing to do with my life, with what I know.\n\n\"But later on, I got into classes and I started responding to this material. Then I started learning Shakespeare in a way, the only way really that an actor can -- that is, to engage in a role and by doing that, to learn the play in that personal, intimate way. I don't think that most of you who are not actors have that opportunity to really learn the play in that way. I think once you do, things unfold: You hear things and you see things in the play that you never would on first hearing.\n\n\"If I were to teach a course in Shakespeare to non-actors, I'd have them act because I think they would get inside the play in that way. \"\n\n... Directing a film.\n\n\"Making 'Looking for Richard' made me relate to film in a way that I never had done before. I do recommend making a film if you want to learn. ... I don't see myself as a director. A director sees material as something he wants to direct; I see the material as something I want to act.\"\n\n... \"Method\" acting.\n\n\"Although I never had a formal training in certain method exercises, I would be close to being a method actor, if that means anything. Not that it really is a method. Everyone has one, and ours really is simply, I guess, living. ... If I'm playing a cook, I have to do a quick study of a cook. It's like finding someone who speaks a certain language. There's just so much you can absorb with the language. You have to find these key things that set you up. When I'm playing a cook, I go and hang out in the kitchen. What I hope will happen is that I'll absorb unconsciously some of these things. ... What stays with me is what I use. I admire very much the way he flips an egg, but that doesn't stay with me later. Another thing stays with me -- the way he wipes a counter ...\n\n\"There's this story about Michael Chekhov, the great acting teacher, who was portraying a character going to the guillotines in a play and he was just terrified. Everyone was asking him, 'What are you thinking about, the guillotine? Having your head chopped off?' No, he was thinking about a cold shower. It worked for him. That's method. It's not always that you're just imagining yourself at the guillotine. That's not going to do it. Sometimes it's a little more personal than that, you think about that shower because in the end that's what you're thinking about anyway. You're relating to something. If you're terrified, you're relating to something real, even if you're not conscious of it.\"\n\n... His favorite role.\n\n\"It's hard for me to pick one out. They're racing through my mind as I talk. I think 'Scarface' comes out. [Applause and cheers from the audience.] I'm very happy about that movie, because when it first came out it was a scandal. ... At the time I knew it wasn't getting what I thought it deserved. It seemed to be speaking about something.\"\n\n... His most challenging role.\n\n\"The first 'Godfather.' It was the most challenging because I didn't know how I could sustain this kind of guy and then turn into that later part. ... I remember spending many, many weeks -- months -- just thinking about how I would make this kid into what he becomes.\"\n\n-- By Dorie Baker"
