        "text": "Welcome to Always Great, a new Awards Insider column in which we speak with Hollywood’s greatest undersung actors in career-spanning conversations. In this entry, Richard Kind talks about breaking hearts and evoking belly laughs—sometimes in the same role—across projects as varied as Big Mouth, Beau Is Afraid, Curb Your Enthusiasm, and A Serious Man.\n\nRichard Kind will have the tomato soup. He also wants the tuna sandwich, but the server tells him it’s not on the menu anymore. A look between disappointment and shock comes over his face.\n\n“You’ve always had the tuna. How do you not have it? It’s the best sandwich in town!”\n\nThe server apologizes and walks away.\n\nIt feels like a moment created by some omnipotent writer just for Richard Kind—a ubiquitous screen presence who averages three movies a year, lends his voice to cartoon characters, and has had unforgettable supporting roles in iconic shows like Mad About You and Curb Your Enthusiasm. Sometimes you expect him (of course he has a part in History of the World: Part II); other times, he’ll be a delightful surprise (as he is in the new season of The Other Two). He played a mayor on Gotham, a City Hall press secretary on Spin City, a judge on The Good Wife, and three different characters in the Law & Order universe (twice as a criminal, three times as a lawyer).\n\nThis year alone, Kind had a part in Ari Aster’s Beau is Afraid, a role in the upcoming Adam Sandler–produced Netflix film The Out-Laws, voice work on a few animated shows, a part on the scripted podcast Bedtime Stories of the Ingleside Inn that also features Jason Alexander and Lance Bass, and a role on the CBS cop drama East New York. Later this summer, he’s also in a play being staged on the Jersey Shore. “I love, love, love to work,” Kind says.\n\nPart of it, of course, is that acting is his job. But Kind also stacks his resume with small, no-budget projects like the short film Proof of Concept, a delightfully meta six-minute story about a father (Kind) being asked by his millennial daughter for money to make a short film. Directors Max Cohn and Ellie Sachs, who also plays the lead role of Kind’s daughter, say that getting Kind was a dream come true—and not just because legendary smoked-fish purveyor Barney Greengrass wouldn’t let them film inside until Kind signed on.\n\nSome might classify him as a character actor, but it’s tough to define exactly what character Kind specializes in is. Those who have cast him often say they wrote the part with Kind in mind, so he’s essentially playing some version of himself. Yet Kind hardly operates in an assembly-line manner. In Beau, he’s a menacing lawyer; in a particularly beloved episode of Documentary Now!, he plays an actor playing a supercilious doorman; in Inside Out, he’ll break your heart as a young girl’s long-ago-abandoned imaginary friend. He’s had plenty of memorable roles, and maybe as many near misses. “I’ve been on three shows that were truly superior and had production cut before they should have: Red Oaks, Luck, and now East New York,” he says. The latter is a cop drama that was just canceled by CBS. “You can print this: CBS this year was number one in the ratings. I applaud them. But to find a good show, with a superior cast and writers who are superior at what they do, you don’t just willy-nilly cancel it. Warner produced it, CBS distributed it, and they came to loggerheads and made a decision out of spite.”\n\nHis Richard Kind–iest role of all was probably Arthur Gopnik in Joel and Ethan Coen’s A Serious Man. The film is centered on Michael Stuhlbarg’s Larry, Arthur’s brother and a classic schlemiel: a guy who effortlessly attracts misfortune. Arthur, though, is downright pathetic. He’s got a cyst that’s always in need of draining, no job, and a gambling problem. Eventually, he’s arrested for “solicitation and sodomy.” To keep using Yiddish terms, he’s a schmuck—a guy who can’t help but screw up. Yet thanks to Kind, you find yourself feeling worse for Arthur than you do for good-natured Larry, who is always trying to do the right thing.\n\nPlaying a character that doesn’t have much in common with the other people onscreen is Kind’s specialty. He’s an odd man out, sometimes downright disagreeable, but somehow always disarming. He plays one of the sweetest characters on Curb Your Enthusiasm: Larry David’s dim cousin Andy, who tells Larry that he “missed a good one,” when bringing up Larry’s mother’s funeral.\n\nIn season 11, Kind’s character is sitting at a table with David, Jeff Garlin, Susie Essman, Vince Vaughn, and Patton Oswalt. David and Essman go into the kitchen to discuss how important the people sitting in the middle of the table are, how they anchor the entire evening. Meanwhile, Kind’s character is droning on about how kids today don’t use the Dewey decimal system or about buying reclaimed wood. Then Kind starts talking about fishing: “The bucket of bait, which is called chum. They call it chum. I don’t know why.” As Garlin told me, something about that line, and the way Kind delivers it, made even a group full of comedy greats break character and burst out laughing.\n\n“Nobody screams as well as Richard.” Nick Kroll would know. He and his Big Mouth cocreators needed somebody who could really scream to play Marty Glouberman, father of pervy little weirdo Andrew (voiced by John Mulaney). Marty seems to live on the verge of an anger-induced heart attack at all times. Even when he’s talking he’s yelling. So naturally, Kroll says, “Richard was the first and only person we considered.”\n\nThat skill may have served Kind well if he’d followed his original plan. The actor grew up on the East Coast, then moved just outside of Chicago to major in prelaw at Northwestern. Then, like so many aspiring lawyers before him, Kind pivoted to acting. One of his professors—the late Frank Galati, a theater legend—told Kind that since his father wanted him to go into business, maybe he should consider producing instead. “I said, ‘No, no, no. It’s either I want to act or I want to be wealthy,’” Kind told him. Galati told his student that he could try, but warned him that acting might not be for him: “You’re not going to be successful until you’re 32,” he told Kind, “because Hollywood doesn’t want your type.”\n\nKind put that number in the front of his mind and got to work. He appeared in a short off-off Broadway play, then toured in a small musical, before landing in the same Second City group as Bonnie Hunt and future voice of Homer Simpson, Dan Castellaneta. When he turned 32, Kind started getting work on TV. Success came in small trickles on shows that lasted a season or two at best, then a steady stream when he got the role of Dr. Mark Devanow on Mad About You. By the mid-2000s, Kind was banking multiple roles a year, from a small part in his friend George Clooney’s 2002 directorial debut, Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, to Christopher Guest’s For Your Consideration, the first Cars movie to the first Garfield movie.\n\nIt was in 2002, during his run in the Broadway play The Tale of the Allergist’s Wife that Kind received a piece of advice that changed everything. Kind had been cast in the role originated by actor Tony Roberts. Before stepping away from the show, Robbins left Kind a note. “He said, ‘The secret to the part: Love your wife. If you love her, the audience will love you and they’ll love her.’ Absolutely right. And that’s something I’ve taken to every role: Even if you hate that person, the person you’re acting opposite, love them. And people will know it, almost subversively.”\n\nThough Kind is the definition of booked and busy, there are still parts he longs to play—chief among them Roy Cohn in Tony Kushner’s Angels in America, a part previously tackled by the likes of Al Pacino and Nathan Lane. In real life, Cohn was reprehensible right up until the end—but in the play, his death allows us to see the humanity in even the worst people. “That’s the kind of villain I love to do,” Kind says. “That’s my dream role.”\n\nWhen our lunch of not-tuna is finished, Kind tells our server that he’s still upset. He’s not giving the waiter a hard time, though; it’s just the sort of small talk Kind seems to make with everybody, from the restaurant’s manager to the high school kid who approaches him to say hello as we leave. “I just want them to love me,” he says a few minutes later, standing outside the restaurant. “I wish I had the balls to go out and be disliked for the first five minutes of a performance. But I don’t. I want you to like me right away. That’s really bad for an actor.”\n\nI instinctively ask him why he thinks he’s like this. “I went to my therapist this morning,” he says matter-of-factly—this is the Upper West Side where we’re talking, after all—before pausing to think about the answer.\n\n“It could be from my dad. My dad would never say, ‘Oh, you’re really good.’ He would always talk to my teachers or a director and ask, ‘Does he have it? Is he any good?’ My mother, on the other hand, I used to joke that I’d be onstage and I could take a dump, and she would go, ‘Is that the best smelling piece of shit you’ve ever smelled?’”\n\nIs that why he works as much as he does? Is he trying to prove something? Kind smiles and shakes his head. “I’m somebody who is very lucky at grabbing opportunities and making my life fuller. I could sit at home and watch a good movie, but who knows what the next job would be? Who knows who I’ll meet? Who knows who will become a friend?” He pauses a moment.\n\nAt this point, he’s told me more than half a dozen times that he considers himself to be a lucky person—but it doesn’t seem like luck to me.\n\n“I really believe I’ll sleep when I’m dead,” he continues. “I will take the red eye, because that’s when I’ll sleep. And I don’t like getting sick because that cuts into the number of days of my life that I have. That’s really how I live my life. So why do I work so much? I don’t want to be left out. I don’t want to miss anything.”\n\nListen to Vanity Fair’s Little Gold Men podcast now."
