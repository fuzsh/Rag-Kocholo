        "text": "The \"Actors on Shakespeare\" series draws on the contemporary relevance of, and enjoyment to be found in, Shakespeare. Each book\n\nprovides an introduction to a particular play and here Al Pacino offers his view of Richard III as expressed in his own film Looking for Richard\n\n(thanks Anne for this info)\n\nNot released yet but you can pre-order it at Amazon.co.uk (Â£3.99)\n\n(this is British, I haven't found where to order it in the US yet.)\n\nPaperback - 112 pages (17 March, 2003)\n\nFaber and Faber; ISBN: 0571214053\n\nA french biography. I don't have a copy so I don't know much about it. Amazon (France) says that it is out of print and unavailable at this time.\n\nFAN REVIEW: \"I find it very interesting, each movie and off-screen things are well described. All pictures are taken from his movies.\n\nIt's from his theater beginnings to Any Given Sunday.\" Virginie Jarosik\n\n(IN FRENCH) Two authors make a comparison between Robert De Niro and Al, their films, their method, their acting style etc. It has many black and white pictures from their films, bibliography, filmography. Edition: Dreamland (224 pages) (if the link doesn't work you can buy it at http://www.fnac.com/ search for Pacino.)\n\nFAN REVIEW: The same origins, an often close play of actor, Al Pacino and Robert De Niro offers many common points. On the basis of this observation, Michel Cieutat and Christian Viviani are leaning on the course of the two American actors. The fruit of their collaboration is a work entitled \"Cross Regards\". Michel Cieutat and Christian Viviani endeavor, initially, to draw up the portrait of Robert de Niro, then the one of Al Pacino. The occasion to see taking shape thus certain similarities. Both were born in New York at the beginning of the Forties. They have Italian blood in the veins. M. Cieutat and C Viviani then try to decipher the catalogue of films of the two actors. Virginie Jarosik"
