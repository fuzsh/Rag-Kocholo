        "text": "INTERVIEWS (8)\n\nCalgary Sun, Sept 9 1996, PATIENT PACINO\n\nProgram Guide, June, 1983, PACINO: AN UNPREDICTABLE MIXTURE OF TALENT AND COURAGE\n\nRolling Stone, October 27, 1996, AL PACINO, THE ROLLING STONE INTERVIEW\n\nProgram Guide, June, 1983\n\nPACINO: AN UNPREDICTABLE MIXTURE OF TALENT AND COURAGE\n\nBy Terry Poulton\n\n(back to top)\n\n(thanks AIpoCino for transcribing this)\n\nCoaxing a belly laugh out of Al Pacino is about as easy as persuading a pachyderm to parachute. But somebody once managed it by asking the introspective actor what he thought would happen if all the characters he's ever played could somehow be thrown together at a cocktail party.\n\nIt's a delicious notion. Just imagine Frank Serpico talking shop with the undercover detective from Cruising, only to realize that Michael Corleone was eavesdropping. Or think of the elegant, aloof Bobby Deerfield trying to communicate with Sonny, the manic bank robber in Dog Day Afternoon. or the junkie from Panic in Needle Park fetching a fresh drink for the lawyer in And Justice For All, and then hitting him up for some free legal advice.\n\nThe scenario is so fundamentally wrong it's no wonder that Pacino, whom columnist Earl Wilson calls \"the male Greta Garbo,\" momentarily dropped his guarded demeanor. Quite apart from its comic value, though, the novel idea also works as a fitting tribute to the actor's brilliant facility for creating genuinely disparate characters. Serpico author Peter Maas probably best described the technique: \"Within 20 minutes of our first meeting, Al started absorbing his role through his pores. It was almost like he was inhaling the guy.\"\n\nPacino himself has always considered this ability the essence of his craft. \"You must get to the point where you don't even have to act-the character just stays with you like lint.\" At the same time, and despite superficial appearances to the contrary, Pacino believes that his own identity must remain palpable. \"Too often, an actor is put in the position of doing a part he can't really speak through. I always insist on connecting with my material.\"\n\nThose trademarks--along with something Pacino predicted immediately after becoming an overnight Broadway star back in 1969--illuminate what is certainly one of the most intriguing screen and stage careers in America. In an interview given the day after he won a Tony for The Indian Wants the Bronx, he said, \"I know I'm going to have a lot of trouble in my professional life because I've made a definite decision never to play it safe. if I think something's right, I'll never let anybody tell me not to do it because it might blow my career.\"\n\nPacino's risky philosophy was inspired by the late lee Strasberg, founder of the Actors' Studio, who told his idealistic young student that \"there's a lot of talent around, but it's very rare to find someone with talent and courage.\" Ironically, considering that Pacino now epitomizes \"The Method\" propounded by the Actors' Studio, he flunked his first audition there. But when he plucked up enough nerve to try again, Strasberg was so impressed that he demanded to know how the blossoming talent had been honed.\n\nThe answer was bizarre. Pacino had actually begun acting as a necessary antidote to being kept a virtual prisoner for most of his childhood. His divorced, Sicilian-born mother was so afraid of her only son coming to grief in their rough Bronx neighborhood that she locked him indoors every day while she was at work. The only time she let him out was to accompany her to the movies several nights a week. During his long, lonely days, young Alberto (sic) would entertain his invalid grandmother by reenacting what he had seen. \"By the time I was six,\" he recalls, \"I had Ray Milland's role in The Lost Weekend down cold.\" Add to that the trauma of never playing with other children, and voilà, an actor with a strong need for escaping into fantasy was forged.\n\nEven without indulging too much amateur psychiatry, it seems obvious that Pacino's troubled childhood also directly influenced his choice of roles, which so far have included a junkie, two hoodlums, a gangster, a hobo, two renegade cops, a disillusioned race car driver and a maverick lawyer. With good grace but no elaboration, Pacino laconically admits to \"a strong attraction to rebel outsiders and anti-heroes.\"\n\nHis first such screen portrait was the unforgettable street hustler in The Panic in Needle Park, surely one of the most chilling anti-drug dramas ever shot. Francis Coppola, who was then preparing The Godfather, was so moved by Pacino's film debut that he overrode vigorous objections from both Paramount and the actor himself to cast him as Michael Corleone. \"Only after I saw the picture did I realize why Francis wanted me,\" Pacino mused later. \"Somewhere in my loins, in my Sicilian heritage, there was a connection.\"\n\nCoppola's intuition was, of course, right on target and Pacino was superb as the Mafia don's son who reluctantly follows in his family's footsteps. His haunting performance earned him an Oscar nomination as best supporting actor, and, two years later in The Godfather II (commanding a salary hike from $35,000 to $600,000-plus), he was nominated for best actor. By then, he had also been in the running for his brilliant performance as the scrupulously honest real-life cop in Serpico.\n\nInexplicably, the Oscar eluded Pacino all three times, just as it did for what many consider the best work of his career: the bungling homosexual bank robber in Dog Day Afternoon. Little evidence suggests that his failure to win Hollywood's ultimate accolade bothers Pacino. Instead, he maintains that\n\nhe considers himself a stage actor first, a movie star only by accident and, at heart, just a character actor who somehow always gets lead roles.\n\nSince 1975, Pacino has made four movies: Bobby Deerfield, And Justice For All, Cruising, and Author! Author! (the latter premieres on cable this\n\nmonth). Between the films, he's devoted himself to doing ambitious plays such as Richard III and the much-praised Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel-- as well as to lingering romantic relationships with (among others) Jill Clayburgh and Marthe Keller (his co-star in Bobby Deerfield).\n\nAs handsomely haggard as ever, Pacino turned 43 a couple of months ago and currently lives alone in the Manhattan apartment he rented from Candice Bergen long ago. That he remains uncompromisingly dedicated as he set out to be was amply demonstrated by the huge career risk he took three years ago with Cruising. Violent criticism was provoked simply by the announcement that he would play a sexually ambivalent cop roaming through the gay community's seamiest districts in pursuit of a murderer. And his actual performance was so shatteringly genuine that many found it repellent.\n\nSo great was the backlash from Cruising, in fact, that for Pacino to follow up with his comparatively tame single-father role in Author! Author! almost seems like an attempt to reassure his fans. But that's hardly likely. Author! Author! stands on its own merits as a solid contemporary portrait. It might\n\neven be argued that for Pacino to tackle such an unusually mainstream role is a risk in itself.\n\nAny serious analysis of Pacino's professional motives must include consideration of his favorite anecdote, which concerns the famous European trapeze-artist family known as the Flying Wallendas. Even after several of his relatives were killed during a bungled stunt, according to Pacino, their patriarch insisted on remaining a circus performer. Asked how he could bear to do so, the heartbroken man replied: \"Life is on the wireall the rest is\n\njust in waiting.\"\n\n(back to top)\n\nCalgary Sun, Sept 9 1996\n\nPATIENT PACINO\n\nBy Louis B. Hobson\n\n(back to top)\n\nHe's waited 10 years to bring Richard III to the silver screen\n\nTORONTO -- His whirlwind visit to this year's Toronto Film Festival marks the end of a decade for Al Pacino.\n\nPacino literally popped into TO to promote his film Looking For Richard.\n\nHe has been working on this tribute to Shakespeare's classic villain Richard III for 10 years.\n\n\"The film is not about me doing Shakespeare's Richard III. It's about me as an American actor looking for Richard and meditating on what I find. It's a very personal experience for me captured on film, but I hope not too personal for an audience to connect with,\" says Pacino.\n\n\"There were times over the 10 years that I wondered if I'd ever get the film to a point where it could get released. I think it's there now.\"\n\nAudiences can judge for themselves when Looking For Richard opens in October.\n\n(back to top)\n\nRolling Stone, October 27, 1996\n\nAL PACINO, THE ROLLING STONE INTERVIEW\n\nby Anthony DeCurtis\n\n(back to top)\n\nA very big thanks to Suzanne Olson for typing this for all you Al fans out there!\n\n\"When I first met him, I was really intimidated,\" says Oscar-winner Kevin Spacey. \"I mean, this was Pacino, man.\" No kidding. A series of images - the ruthless, inscrutable Michael Corleone from the Godfather movies, the viciously explosive Tony Montana from Scarface, the swaggering, intense salesman Ricky Roma from Glengarry Glen Ross - assaults my brain as I come face to face with Al Pacino for this rare interview.\n\nWe are here to talk about Pacino's directorial debut on film with Looking for Richard. This freewheeling documentary in which he also stars presents him in a completely different light: an engaging, maddeningly obsessed quest in search of the meaning of Shakespeare in our everyday lives. A scruffy-looking Pacino wanders the streets of his native New York, asking passers-by for their feelings about the Bard and one of his most riveting characters, the fiercely ambitious hunchbacked king, Richard III. You can imagine the responses he gets.\n\nThose zany encounters alternate with behind-the-scenes looks at readings, research, rehearsals and performances for a film of Richard III that Pacino is trying to get under way with such stars as Spacey, Winona Ryder and Alec Baldwin. \"It's the first time that Al has ever revealed his own process, and it really does show him for the ham hr is,\" says Spacey, laughing. \"We're pleased to finally break down the brooding Godfather image and show him going for cheap laughs as much as he can. It's kind of delightful.\" But it's not all joking around. In particular, a seduction scene in which Pacino's Richard weaves an erotic web around a stunned and stunning Winona Ryder as Lady Anne is a spellbinding realization of theater on film.\n\nA four-year labor of love, Looking for Richard is one of a series of offbeat projects Pacino has taken on while also starring in such big-ticket items as Scent of a Woman (1992) - for which he won his first Academy Award after eight nominations - Carlito's Way, Heat (with Robert De Niro) and City Hall. Since Pacino's role as a hard-drinking cop in Sea of Love and a comic turn in Dick Tracy restored his box-office clout after the commercial and critical beatings taken by Cruising, Author! Author! and Revolution, he has been determined not to play it safe.\n\nAt the moment, Pacino is playing full houses on Broadway in Hughie, an obscure one-act play by Eugene O'Neill that Pacino also directed. And he's completed his film of The Local Stigmatic, a brutal one-act play by British playwright Heathcote Williams that has been Pacino's pet project for more than a decade. He still refuses to release it commercially, though the short film (less than an hour long) appeared at New York's Whitney Museum for a few weeks in 1992. Pacino prefers to arrange occasional screenings for pals and journalists.\n\n\"I really admire the way he's running his career just the way he wants to,\" says Sidney Lumet, who directed the star in Serpico and Dog Day Afternoon, two '70s films that helped establish Pacino as one of the pre-eminent actors of our time. \"They make it very tempting to do what they want you to do,\" says Lumet of Hollywood studios. \"For one thing, the money is ridiculous.\"\n\nFor both sessions of our interview, which are separated by a day, Pacino is improbably dressed in an unconstructed sea-green suit and a black, ribbed tank top that dips low on his chest and under his arms. Accessories include a gold chain and a yellow scarf around his neck, and a pinkie ring. In short, he looks like a styling Italian kid from the Bronx, where he was raised. Born in East Harlem, in 1940, the only child of Salvatore and Rose Pacino, Al was 2 years old when his parents divorced and he and his mother went to live with her parents in a tough Bronx neighborhood. Young Al enjoyed going to the movies with his mother and later playacting all the parts for his grandparents. There he was, age 4, mimicking the alcoholic whom Ray Milland portrayed in The Lost Weekend. At 17, he dropped out of high school and earned money for acting lessons that would lead to stage roles and his 1971 film breakthrough as a junkie in Panic In Needle Park. Today, the never-married Pacino (he has a daughter Julie, 7, who lives with her mother) continues to approach his vocation with the fervor of a monk. \"In acting,\" he has said, \"you could find some peace, you could get away from the loneliness.\"\n\nPacino sets our chairs close together in his Manhattan office, facing each other, on the same side of a long wooden table. From where I sit, I can see over all of Central Park, up into Harlem, nearly to the distant Bronx. He slouches in his chair, listens carefully and never responds without thinking first. Once he starts talking, he's voluble. He's never glib, nor is he wary or nervous. He just seems to want to get things right.\n\n\"I'm easy to talk to,\" Pacino says as we shake hands after our first meeting, seemingly pleased that I thought so, too. I found myself thinking of something Lumet told me: \"Al is so completely dedicated to the truth of what he's doing that he becomes a barometer of truth for everyone else on the set, including the director.\"\n\nAfter Looking for Richard, Pacino will co-star with two young pretenders to his throne - Johnny Depp in Donnie Brasco and Keanu Reeves in The Devil's Advocate. More than a quarter of a century into his career, Pacino is still fully in motion. \"He's still on this search,\" says Spacey. \"He's on this hunt. And it never ends. You have to keep pursuing it.\" Here's Al Pacino, in pursuit.\n\nYou directed and acted in \"Looking for Richard\" onscreen, and you've directed and acted in \"Hughie\" onstage. Why take the reins now, for the first time, at 56?\n\nIf you're still hanging around, why not direct? [Laughs.] I mean, I'm still here, what the hell? Why not try this? I do think, though, when I see the work of directors I admire, it doesn't feel like it's anywhere in my range of talent. I see great directors and what they've done, and I feel humbled by it. However, I do direct as someone who's lived in these worlds for 40 years. I use what I've picked up, what I've come to know. I have 25 years of making movies, and I've worked with some real masters. Even though I wasn't aware of their directing while I was working with them, subliminally I must have picked up something. So it's not like I'm a novice.\n\nIs it a hard switch from acting to directing?\n\nI look at the world from an actor's point of view. I look at you, and I see you not as someone I want to paint, not as someone I want to write about, not as someone I want to direct, but as someone I would act. There has been a lifetime of that; that's how I see things. With directing, it's like I'm suddenly playing the oboe or something. How the hell did I get to do that?\n\nHow did you?\n\nThere's reasons for it. The reason I directed the film is, I was out of my head - who else would direct it? [Laughs.] The reason I directed the play is, I had an idea about how to do this O'Neill play. I thought, \"By the time I express it to another director and go through that, I might as well try doing it myself.\n\nWhat are the qualities of a great director?\n\nI know it when I see it. The world that Coppola got in there in The Godfather was indescribable. I don't know how he did it, what was on his mind. You can't call it. I can't tell you when I'm on the set with somebody how the picture's going to turn out by the way they behave. It's only when I see what they've done. It's like a painter, and you're behind the canvas: You can't see what he's painting; he can be drunk or he can be singing - you don't know what he's painting until you see it.\n\nOne exception: I do know when directors are unsure. I can feel that. They don't know where to put the camera. Or you see setups being repeated, and you get a sense that the director has not given a lot of thought to the scene. But it's not my place to dwell on it. It doesn't do me any good or the film or the director.\n\nMy point is, with certain directors, you can feel their control - they're in charge. They've got a sense of what they're doing, and it just permeates the crew. Then, some directors know how to work with actors better than others, some tire you out, some give you energy, some never say anything, others are enthusiasts. I've worked with them all, all kinds.\n\n\"Looking for Richard: is a documentary about making a film version of \"Richard III.\" Why did you decide to take that approach?\n\nI try to set the stage for you, so that when you get to Shakespeare, you can get into it a little bit more relaxed. Some of the scenes have given you a chance to understand what the characters are doing and why they're doing it, so you're then able to receive the vintage Shakespeare, the real power of his vision.\n\nWhy \"Richard III\"?\n\nRichard was familiar to me because I had played it three times onstage. I understood the play.\n\nThe movie invites audiences in. It shows that it's possible to have a variety of views about Shakespeare - there's no \"right\" view.\n\nWe have Shakespeare, and we have a documentary about Shakespeare, two things that people don't want to go see. [Laughs.] I guess we hope they cancel each other out and serve each other so that they can make the film more popular. It's an experiment - and also, hopefully, it's fun. I try to keep it entertaining.\n\nWhat about the character of Richard? In certain ways he's not that dissimilar from other characters you've played. He has the willingness to do anything to get what he wants. Do you feel the connection between him and other roles you've played?\n\nI don't feel that. When you look at it, though, I guess there's a certain similarity, just by the nature of the character. Sometimes I do use certain characters to help play others. Look at Arturo Ui, by Bertolt Brecht. I did that play many, many years ago, and some of that character turns up in Big Boy Caprice, in Dick Tracy. Now what would Bertolt Brecht and Dick Tracy have in common? But there are commonalties; you find them.\n\n\"Looking for Richard\" and \"Hughie\" are hardly blockbusters, and probably the film closest to your heart is your version of\" The Local Stigmatic,\" which you rarely show. How do you balance such work with box-office projects such as \"Heat\"?\n\nIt's changed over the years. It has to do with where you go as you go on in life. Right now I feel like things are exploding all over the place for me. But I thought, for instance, that what's going on now was going to be happening to me 10 years ago. But it wasn't. I found myself not doing anything for four years. So here I am in a place where I have an opportunity to do all these things. I'm not going to do them? In a world where you always feel as though you have to produce - you're a \"professional\"; you've got to come up with the goods - what happens is that you start repeating yourself or playing it safe, because that's what's asked of you. Required of you.\n\nThat's restricting. Growth is hard to have happen there. So you have to find a way to experiment, to get a perspective that isn't just about success or failure - \"Oh, my next one's got to be a whatever.\" That kind of thing. To avoid that is liberating - to get into Stigmatic, where it doesn't matter if it even comes out. Just the idea tat you're doing something for the sake of what it is, to try to accommodate the vision of the play. To be freed of having to score, having to make something that a lot of people go to or a lot of people like. Just something that you're doing because you have a connection to it.\n\nBut then, I'm in the entertainment business, too. I got here because I was lucky enough to be in a very successful commercial movie, and I'll never forget that.\n\nYou first made your mark in the early '70s. Did you feel much of an identification with other people like Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro who were mining similar terrain?\n\nThey came after me, so I didn't know them. Francis [Coppola] had mentioned Martin Scorsese to me as being a great artist - I hadn't even heard his name. Of course, I know Bobby from the street. I'd seen him around, and I remember seeing him in a movie that Brian De Palma did called Greetings and thinking that he had a real energy and talent. The he popped up in The Godfather Part Two.\n\nDid you and Scorsese ever talk about working together?\n\nThere was one time years ago - he was working on Modigliani, the Dennis McIntyre play about the painter, developing it with me. The script didn't turn out. He would be someone I'd really want to work with. He's tops. As Bobby once told me, Scorsese can't help making a movie that comes right out of himself - he just can't help it. He's a great filmmaker. I marvel at his stuff. Anything he does.\n\nObviously, in \"Heat\"...\n\nBobby and I?\n\nYeah, exactly. What was that like, working together even in one scene, since you had no scenes in Godfather Part Two?\n\nIt's hard to say. I mean, I hardly saw him. For the scene in Heat, we got together and didn't rehearse much - I don't think we rehearsed it at all. We read it through a couple of times, then a month or two later we were in this coffee shop filming it. He was there; I was there. We just did it. You know, you read a score and play your duet together. It was easier with Bobby because I knew him; we have a relationship we feel mutual about. We get along - it was just kind of an extension of that.\n\nHow did the director of \"Heat,\" Michael Mann, handle that situation?\n\nFortunately for both of us, Michael made the pressure less. It probably would have been even less pressure if Bobby and I were doing the whole movie together. But this setup - one scene, the two of us - it was just sort of built to make you feel a little uneasy. Fortunately, however, Michael Mann made things real easy.\n\nHow?\n\nI just really, really like Michael. I think he's a great director. Great. There's an example of the guy, when you're around him, you fell that sense of his control. That's a Michael Mann set, that's his film, and you are in it. And it's a real comfortable milieu. You can let it go and just be whatever your guy is. He allows that.\n\nThat's the thing about directing: control. There is a certain comfort when you are directing a film yourself, and you have control - it's just a bloody relief. Just for the control, it's worth directing. Just for that.\n\nDo you feel more control acting on the stage?\n\nThat's where I'm most comfortable, because it's where I started. The best way I can think to describe it is walking up on the wire - it's the wire without the net. And because of that, it requires your metabolism to do another thing. It requires the chemicals in your body to go through the kinds of changes that can accommodate the high wire. It's that kind of action. There's a magic there.\n\nI never feel that in movies ever - never, no matter what. So when I dream, daydream, whatever, I usually daydream about the theater.\n\nI wanted to talk a bit about some of the other directors you've worked with. For example, you did \"Scarface\" and \"Carlito's Way\" with Brian De Palma.\n\nI love Brian. I don't know what the rap on him is, but he's got real quality and depth. These directors you're mentioning - Marty Scorsese, Michael Mann, Brian De Palma - I mean, that's directing. Sidney Lumet. That's what it is. They've got that thing, that touch.\n\nIs there something in particular they bring out in you?\n\nWell, the thing that brings out more in me usually is: I'm tied to the playwright, the text, the writer. That's who my relationship is with. Directors are more exotic figures to me - that's probably why I'm slightly in awe of them. But the writer is somebody I'm with. It's the actor and writer. Shakespeare was an actor and a writer. It's that classic relationship; it's real symbiotic.\n\n\"Scarface,\" which was written by Oliver Stone, has become a kind of cult classic. Has its ongoing life pleased you?\n\nOh, sure. Especially because when it first opened, it was ridiculed. So the fact that it has lasted is wonderful. It's the only movie I've ever been in where someone will stop me in the street and quote a line, and they're always the oddest lines. You never know what they're going to quote. You would think, \"Say hello to my little friend,\" or something like that. But sometimes a guy will just turn, look at me and say [as Tony Montana], \"Can I go now?\" I mean, it's thrilling when people do that.\n\n\"See what you made me do\" is my own favorite, from the assassination scene in New York.\n\nThat's vintage Oliver Stone - Oliver Stone and his anarchic wildness.\n\nWeren't you and Oliver Stone talking about doing a movie about Manuel Noriega?\n\nYeah. We were going to do it. Then we read it a couple of times, and much to Oliver's credit, he was able to see that while there was some great stuff in it, absolute magic stuff like he can do, it wasn't quite formed yet.\n\nYou were also supposed to star in the film of the David Mamet play \"American Buffalo,\" which you'd done onstage. The role ended up going to Dustin Hoffman. What happened?\n\nThere's an example of a movie I was asked to direct, but I didn't feel I could. I had played it for years on the stage. As far as I was concerned, John McNaughton was going to direct, and Jerry Tokofsky, who produced Glengarry Glen Ross, was going to produce it. That was my understanding. It just didn't work out. The part was offered to me, but I felt an allegiance to Jerry. We had done Glengarry and, with McNaughton, we were going to do [Buffalo]. But some political stuff was going on, and something got lost. I truly don't know the details.\n\nAre you disappointed?\n\nI guess in part I am. In doing something that long onstage, I would have liked to have done the film. It's a great play. It should be done. As long as it's been done, that's good. I look forward to seeing it.\n\nHow do you respond to criticism of your performance?\n\nI try to avoid reading or hearing about it. If it's good, it makes you conscious of the good things. If it's bad, it makes you conscious of the bad things. Sometimes in retrospect it's interesting, but it can really be upsetting when you're in the middle of something. It can hurt you.\n\nI mean, mentioning Scarface, there I was doing American Buffalo on Broadway, and somebody comes to my dressing room and says, \"Oh, could you please sign this for me?\" I said, \"Sure,\" and I took a pen, and this woman wanted me to sign a headline that read, AL PACINO FAILS MISERABLY AS SCARFACE [laughs].\n\nI had an experience once in the theater in Boston. I was in the dressing room while this guy was looking at a review of our play. For everyone else in the play there was - what's the word? - adulation. With one exception: me. The guy didn't want me to see it, of course, but I said, \"What's that?\" He had a look on his face, but it was too late - there it was. And the moment I saw that review, on the speaker in my dressing room came my cue to go onstage. Maybe I was young or whatever, but it struck me really funny. It was very liberating. I went onstage, and it was really fun. I wish I could say I always felt that way.\n\nHow much of a perspective are you able to maintain on you and the character you are playing?\n\nI remember the very first time I saw myself in a film, my reaction was, \"I didn't know that that was showing.\"\n\nWhat did you feel was \"showing?\"\n\nWhen I looked at myself, or the character I was playing, I thought, \"Gee, that guy looks really\" - what's the word? I thought he looked kind of lonely.\n\nAfter that, I said I cannot cope with the film thing if I'm going to be subjective, so I have to say that that's an actor doing a part. That's how I approach it. I look at it as an effort I made, and I feel it's no longer about me. I remember when we were working on Dog Day Afternoon, we had to do some retakes. I had been working on it intensively for about 11 weeks - but intensively. Then we were off for a couple of weeks, and I had to do a couple of pickup shots. I could not get it. A friend of mine was in the scene with me, and he said that he saw the character leave my body.\n\nWas it a big adjustment to go from stage acting to movies?\n\nSomeone once called actors \"emotional athletes.\" They're dealing with that experience every night on the stage. In movies it's strange because you've got to stay in a state for 14 hours a day. After you've made enough movies, you start to understand that there is a technique for film. You develop a way of accommodating the frame and working to that - something I've always been reluctant to do, since I am a stage actor. I try not to pay too much attention to how it's coming off in the frame, but just to feel it. But what happens with film is that almost unconsciously, you develop a certain camera sense.\n\nEarly on, in the films with Lumet, I never knew where the camera was. But as I went on, I became more aware of its presence and what I could do with it. But even to this day, I try not to be too aware of it.\n\nDoes that affect you as a director?\n\nDirecting, now, makes me aware of a frame: What's in the frame, what's being said when you look at it. Where do you put the camera? That's the first thing you think about. It's a nightmare. I have this memory of Brian De Palma in Florida. We were making Scarface. One morning I'm having coffee on this beautiful deck overlooking the ocean at the Fontainebleu hotel, and I see a crowd of people all looking out toward the sea. I'm thinking, \"What's going on? Did something wash in, some dead sea lion or something?\" Then the crowd parts a little, and I can make out De Palma standing there with about 200 people staring at him. They're all looking at him, and he's looking at them, and you know he's thinking \"Where do I put the camera?\" He looked so lost, and I completely know what he was feeling. It's impossible. It's just impossible. Everybody is waiting for you to make up your mind.\n\nI can't sit in a room with you and not ask about the role with which you're most closely identified, Michael Corleone. What was the impact of that role on you?\n\nThe first two Godfather pictures were beautifully made movies by a master, and it was my unbelievable good luck to be in them. Because, as someone said to me the other day, \"that picture would have been good even if you weren't in it. It didn't need you to be good.\" [Laughs] It's true: It just happened that I was in it. I feel good that Francis always wanted me to play Michael, even when I didn't see myself in it.\n\nThe movies, unlike the book, became Michael's story.\n\nThat's who Francis was. As writer, as director, in his expression, he was mostly Michael. He's got a bit of Fredo and Sonny in him, a bit of all three sons - I felt that. But I always felt that he understood Michael very well, and he was able to communicate that to me. I don't know if I would play it the same way again, the earlier films.\n\nDo you see Michael differently now?\n\nAt that time he was someone who was trying desperately to change his fate, a destiny that he could intuit. That's what gave him the sense of tragedy. He was a beautifully etched character in terms of the writing. Beautiful. He's the symbol for the second-generation Italian-American or any group that's felt that pull from the family. The Godfather had that kind of span. Mario Puzo and Francis, they could taste it in themselves. I felt a bit naive at the time, but I must have felt these things unconsciously, because they came out.\n\nThere was a thing nagging in the back of that character: At what stage did he put the blinders on and say, \"I go in this direction?\" His curse was that he didn't have the old country to support him, his father's sense of things. He had to desensitize himself in order to go on, so Michael became an isolated person. And a brutally sad character when you think of him being that locked up.\n\nPalpably there and absolutely unknowable.\n\nAt the time, doing it, I didn't particularly think that. To me it was like, \"There's nothing to play here.\" Sonny's got all the [makes dramatic arm gestures], so what do you play? But as it went on, especially in the second one, the contradictions, the conflicts, the emotions... And in the third one, trying to finally find a way back to humanity for Michael, that was complicated.\n\nWhat are your aspirations at this point?\n\nI'm coming to a point now where I understand what doing something for the sake of doing it is, and what doing something because you have to do it is. Occasionally one hopes that someone will come along that stimulates aspirations, something that will transform you. Here I am in the middle of so much stuff, and in a way, I'm trying to get loose of it. But then something else comes up, another movie that's interesting. There's a movie now about that guy who was a spy for the Russians, Aldrich Ames. It's a fascinating script. You're tempted to go into that world, but you know that's going to take six months or a year of your life.p> I use to say, \"Just one thing.\" Now I don't feel satisfied unless I'm doing two or three things. They feed each other. Then there's the life in between those things.\n\nThe discipline is good. The discipline is important. In the end you find that if you are an actor, that's really where the fun is. The Flying Wallendas said, \"Life's on the wire. The rest is just waiting.\" That's your purpose. That's why I'm here. In the end, it's a plank and a passion. That's the name of the game. And as long as that's there, I'll keep doing it. When that goes, I quit. I've been pretty lucky. That's all I can say. Pretty lucky.\n\n(back to top)\n\nPREVIOUS INTERVIEW PAGE\n\nNEXT INTERVIEW PAGE"
