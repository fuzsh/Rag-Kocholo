Merritt | Boulder, CO | 01/01/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Al Pacino is widely known for his performances as a heroin addict (The Panic in Needle Park), as Michael Corleone (The Godfather), as a NYC cop (Serpico) and as Cuban drug gangster Tony Montana (Scarface). This 2007 Pacino boxset includes three rare, lesser-known Pacino performances: The Local Stigmatic (Disc 1), Looking For Richard (Disc 2) and Chinese Coffee (Disc 3), together with a documentary on Pacino's entire film career, Babbleonia (Disc 4). This collection offers Pacino fans a rare window into the way Pacino totally immerses himself into a character, whether it is Tony Montana in Scarface or Shylock in William Shakespeare's The Merchant of Venice, and would complete a Pacino DVD library with the Al Pacino Collection (The Devil's Advocate/Dog Day Afternoon/Heat) and the Al Pacino Collection (Scarface/Carlito's Way/Scent Of A Woman/Sea Of Love).\n\n1. The Local Stigmatic (Disc 1).\n\nBased on a 1969 off-Broadway play by the English writer Heathcote Williams in which Pacino starred, The Local Stigmatic is a short film Pacino made in 1985. The 50-minute film was screened by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City in March 1990, but was never released theatrically. It tells the story of two British friends who spend their time walking about England discussing dog racing.\n\n2. Looking For Richard (Disc 2).\n\nScarface yes, but few people associate Al Pacino with Shakespeare. Looking for Richard (1996) is a documentary directed by and starring Al Pacino, which not only explores a stage production of Shakespeare's Richard III, but also examines Shakespeare's relevance in contemporary culture. Stated differently, this is a film about Pacino's passion for Shakespeare. Just imagine Shakespeare's villainous hump-backed Richard III roaming the crowded streets of NYC today. In the quick-witted film, Pacino plays himself and the title character of Richard III. Filmed mostly in the streets of Manhattan, in Central Park, and the at the Cloisters museum, the documentary focuses on several pivotal scenes in the play, featuring minor performance segments by the other cast members including Kevin Spacey, Winona Ryder (as Lady Anne), Alec Baldwin, and Aidan Quinn. (Roughly one-fourth of the play is actually performed in the film.) Others contributing their insights to the film as experienced Shakesperean actors include Kenneth Branagh, Sir John Gielgud, Kevin Kline and Vanessa Redgrave. (Kevin Kline confesses that his first exposure to Shakespeare came while making out with his girlfriend at a performance of \"King Lear.\" In true Shakespearean form, the amorous couple left the play at intermission.) This is a truly fascinating film that illuminates the challenges of performing one of the Bard's most difficult plays. This film will leave viewers with an inspiration for Shakespeare. Looking for Richard is currently is in rotation on the IFC channel.\n\n3. Chinese Coffee (Disc 3).\n\nBased on a play by Ira Lewis and then made into an independent film and released as part of the Tribeca Film Festival in New York City, Chinese Coffee involves a conversation between two friends (played by Pacino and Jerry Orbach). They discuss topics ranging from love and loss to the absurd humour of daily life. Don't expect My Dinner with Andre.\n\nG. Merritt\"\n\nA great buy if you're a true Al Pacino fan!\n\nAntonio Sanders | VA...USA | 02/23/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"I must say that I have been following the career of Al Pacino since I was in college back in 2000 and I gotta say that this box set is simply amazing. I had got this as a birthday present from my wife which was really cool because with this addition my Al Pacino collection is nearly complete minus abought 3-4 titles remaining. For almost three decades Pacino has brought us some of the most passionate,rememorble roles with his unique style of acting and while really getting up there in age nowdays he can still bring down the house!\n\nIf I were to say honestly which of the three dvds did I llike the most in this box set I'd have to say Chinese Coffee was my favorite. I'm not gonna give anything away because the way I am with my Pacino movies is basically if I've never seen them before its okay because if he's in it then I know its gotta be good, simple as that. My other favorite was Looking for Richard which is in this box set as well. This movie is very hard to come by and for the longest was only available on VHS. I remember seeing this in high school in my Shakesphere class and man I was so mesmerized then just as I am now. A great all star cast and a great documentary that not only shows Pacino's passion for acting,but also his love for the King Richard the third play as well. Local Stigmatic which is the last one in the boxset well...My and my wife just didn't get this movie. That doesn't mean its a bad thing or a good thing, we just didn't get this movie. It'll probably take me a while to really understand this movie but overall this is really a great buy if you are a die hard Al Pacino fan so check it out especially since nowdays you can get it for a deal.\"\n\nTo Al Pacino's Lovers\n\nSherin Farouk Gad | Cairo, Egypt | 06/24/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"This set contains three works for Al Pacino that serve as an excellent insight into Al Pacino's art: Chinese Coffee, Looking Richard and Local Stigmatic. It is a proof how this man can be considered a real and superb artist. The commentary made by Al himself is a very usful one. I enjoyed it so much.\n\nThe fourth DVD is an inteview with Al. He talks about everything related to the art of acting, his background and his works.\n\nIf you love this living legend, you have to watch this set that tells you how great an artist he is.\n\nI am very I own this set.\n\n\"\n\nA bit of an indulgence for Pacino, but still worth viewing\n\nA. Martello | spokane, WA USA | 01/18/2008\n\n(5 out of 5 stars)\n\n\"Looking for Richard is worth the price of the whole set. If you're interested in the process and craft of acting or directing or are just interested in what it means to be a worker in the creative arts, this is a fascinating set.\""
