        "text": "It was north of 1 a.m. in Beverly Hills. Two actors were sitting at a table at a restaurant called Kate Mantilini, an industry hot spot just a few blocks away from the Academy’s headquarters. There were three cameras pointed at them: two over the shoulder, and one in profile. It wasn’t uncommon for Michael Mann to shoot his films like this, bringing multiple cameras to capture an actor’s every move. But this time, having three angles was particularly essential. This time, the movie was Heat, and the actors were Al Pacino and Robert De Niro, sharing the screen together for the very first time. In just a few minutes, they would make film history.\n\nThe scene became the centerpiece of Heat, Mann’s meticulously crafted 1995 crime drama about a detective who chases an elusive criminal all over Los Angeles. Lt. Vincent Hanna (Pacino), based on the real detective Chuck Adamson, is a coked-up cop who lives for the hunt, close on the heels of Neil McCauley (De Niro), a cool career criminal who raises theft into an art form. The film, a rich portrait of these two men, is the cinematic rendering of a true story Mann had been obsessed with for years. (Prior to Heat, he made a TV movie called L.A. Takedown inspired by the same events and collaborated with Adamson on shows like Miami Vice and Crime Story.) The film will receive renewed attention at this year’s Tribeca Film Festival, where Mann will reunite with Pacino and De Niro on June 17 to screen a 4K version of the film. Mann will also, on August 9, release Heat 2, a book that traces the characters’ lives before and after the events of the film.\n\nBut even within this newly expanded universe, there is a single moment that has, and will always, define Heat: the coffee shop scene between McCauley and Hanna, acted to perfection by De Niro and Pacino. For the first time in their storied careers, the two heavyweights would finally act opposite one another, nearly two decades after *The Godfather Part II—*in which they both starred but never shared any scenes. (Pacino played Michael Corleone, the son of Don Vito Corleone; De Niro played the Don in flashbacks.) Heat was a corrective, offering a simple scene that allowed the duo to act, delivering a one-of-a-kind master class that has only grown richer over time.\n\nIn the scene, Hanna asks McCauley to coffee. McCauley agrees. They sit down at a busy restaurant, each using the meeting as a chance to psychoanalyze the other. They swap ideologies. “Don’t let yourself get attached to anything you are not willing to walk out on in 30 seconds flat if you feel the heat around the corner,” McCauley says, repeating the credo that’s kept him alive. Both men wear dark suits, their hair slicked back, arms gently outstretched on the table. They mirror each other. The scene ends with the pair exchanging deadly vows, pledging to kill the other in the outside world if the moment comes. They both know that, eventually, it will.\n\nMann only uses over-the-shoulder shots in the final film, resting the action on both men’s faces and in the potent way they deliver their dialogue. This kind of staging is simple but revealing; it stops bad actors at the door. It also heightens the tension. “If De Niro’s right foot sitting in that chair slid backward by so much as an inch, or his right shoulder dropped by just a little bit, I knew Al would be reading that,” Mann told the Directors Guild of America in an interview. “They’d be scanning each other, like an MRI.”\n\nThe meeting quickly shifts into something more intimate. Hanna and McCauley share details about their difficult lives, then swap dreams. In the director’s commentary, Mann says that the dream exchange is his favorite part of the scene, featuring both characters at their “most intimate.” When Hanna sleeps, he has the same recurring vision of the bloodied, ballooning murder victims he couldn’t save sitting around a table with black eyes and nothing to say, the room heavy with guilt. Their only purpose now is to remind him to try harder for the living. McCauley dreams of drowning, a manifestation of his fear that he’s running out of time and that death is around the corner. “Time is luck,” he says in another scene. That’s Mann’s own personal philosophy, something he’s slipped into other projects—this time delivered via one of the most celebrated actors in the world.\n\nThere’s a temptation to pounce—and many have—on the symbolism of the coffee shop scene, the rarity of Pacino and De Niro acting together; two parallel stars whose careers both represent a propulsive, oft-imitated acting style and an era of auteur-rich filmmaking. There are a handful of actors who still work in this mode; Leonardo DiCaprio, for example, who took the baton from De Niro to become Martin Scorsese’s muse, or Adam Driver. But their careers cannot exist without comparison to Pacino and De Niro, titans of the craft.\n\nHeat is a time capsule of many things, not least the kind of glossy, adult, big-budget box office hit whose success feels impossible to replicate in today’s theatrical era. Heat would, however, have a surprise influence in this space: Christopher Nolan, a Heat superfan, drew heavily from the film while making 2008’s The Dark Knight, opening the door to a new wave of bold, gritty movies in the superhero genre.\n\nAs the film’s legacy has grown, Mann, De Niro, and Pacino have resisted the temptation to shroud The Scene in myth. They speak about it as old friends do, as a good and special thing they were lucky to make. When opportunities arise to bolster the legend, they sidestep. Mann, for example, opted instead to highlight a scene from Heat’s epic shootout when asked to participate in the filmmaking series One Perfect Shot. At a 20th-anniversary screening of the film in 2015 held by the Motion Picture Academy—which failed, in 1996, to nominate Heat for any Oscars—all three smiled and shrugged their way through questions moderated by the night’s host, Nolan. There, De Niro remembered the scene as a jolly headache. “We started late…so I was a little unhappy,” he said, still ribbing Mann after all these years. “But anyway, we did it and it was fine.”\n\nPacino, for his part, claimed he never knew if they got it right. “I’d like to do it again, actually,” he quipped. He has since acted alongside De Niro in Righteous Kill and The Irishman; only the latter, directed by Scorsese, received critical acclaim.\n\nHeat remains the best of these collaborations, enriched by the subtext of Mann’s casting coup—a feat that bolsters Heat’s upcoming 4K release and the excitement for Heat 2. In his commentary on the original film, Mann only enhances the subtext, acknowledging that he was working with two of the all-time greats. After all these years, it’s still the chemistry and shared history between De Niro and Pacino that make Heat an instant classic. Mann knows as much, summing up McCauley and Hanna’s rare kinship in cosmic terms: “These are the only two guys like each other in the universe.”"
