        "text": "Hey, im just doing a practise question for the 2012 Module A question, comparing Richard III and Looking for Richard. The question is:\n\nOur interest in the parallels between King Richard III and Looking for Richard is further enhanced by consideration of their marked differences in textual form. Evaluate this statement.\n\nAny opinions on it would be greatky appreciated. Thanks!\n\nTexts are often a reflection of the society they embody: through awareness of context deeper levels of understanding can be developed and explored. By a comparative study of texts parallels in context can be established and evaluated, with the alternate visual mediums key in enhancing the audience experience. William Shakespeare’s “Richard III’ (1592) and Al Pacino’s “Looking for Richard,” (1996) both represent common themes of war and characterisation, with respective societal influence affecting their portrayal. Shakespeare’s text strongly portrays the presence of propaganda in society, an influence still present in the context of 1996. Through the employment of the visual medium, Al Pacino is capable of displaying these influences to a postmodern audience, demonstrating the similarities in context and purpose.\n\nWar is a predominant theme in ‘Richard III,’ the ongoing turmoil between the Lancasters and the Yorks in the War of the Roses the premise for the play. The battle (and defeat of Richard) at Bosworth, is the conclusive decider of the text, ending Richard’s reign as King, and setting the Lancasters back on the throne. Looking for Richard portrays the Battle of Bosworth, the employment of the visual medium altering its depiction. In the play the battle and Richard’s murder is a relatively quick affair, the stage direction, ‘they fight. King Richard III is slain,’ the only orated form of violence. Through the visual medium however, Pacino is able to dramatize Richard’s final scene, turning Richard’s murder from a lost fight, into an execution. Pacino’s representation of the battle represents views in society at that time; revealed in the numerous ‘vox poxes,’ it is revealed that the common public to not care for Shakespeare. By extenuating the battle scene Pacino is able to compare Richard III to films such as ‘Braveheart,’ employing the genre’s popularity to generate interest in the prospective audience.\n\nDespite the evil spin Shakespeare takes on Richard III, Richard was most likely not the evil, vindictive ruler who Shakespeare depicted. He was not even deformed, as the recent discovery of his remains revealed. Such a take on the ruler was likely done in favour of the current ruler; at the time of Richard’s publishment, the tudor monarch Elizabeth I was on the throne. To solidify her position on the throne, Richard’s actions had to be put in a bad light, with his ‘evil,’ method of ascending to the throne in direct opposition to her being the direct heir. In a sense, Shakespeare’s purpose is to depict the events of history in a way preferable to the audience of the time. In the modern era, (in the modern context)Pacino’s purpose is eerily similar, he depicting the scenes of Richard in a fashion more accessible to a modern audience. This is expressed through the visual medium. By depicting the process of producing and understanding Richard (of understanding Shakespeare) Pacino shares his journey with the audience; the table reads are particularly in expressing such. ‘You have an entire company on the stage, good actors, not knowing where they’re going. Where they are!’ By depicting modern actors (professionals, even) as ignorant of Shakespeare and his techniques, he is making their efforts accessible to the modern audience, who can relate to their lacking of understanding.\n\nOne of the largest troubles a modern audience has in interpreting Shakespeare is the lack of expressive language. It can be very straining on the mind to imagine a story without description – representations of character are far subtler, with only the dialogue offering the occasional glimpse of expression and feeling. Through the use of the visual medium, Pacino is able to enhance description – particularly with Richard. As Pacino portrays Richard, he is always dressed in black, the colour of evil and malice. From the very first scene it is evident that Richard is a villain (vice character), his dress enhancing his emotions of hatred and malevolence. Similarly, Pacino’s use of movement is very effective in capturing the character of Richard, his shuffles and sneaking manour representing his mischievous nature. He also stays in the shadows, refusing the allure of light. In Pacino’s first representation of Richard, for example, where he delivers his opening line provides an example of this. The way he moves around the window, keeping to the sides and peering out, yet never actually immersing himself in the light of day, as if he cannot suffer the sun’s brilliance. As if a vampire. Or other foul demon.\n\nTexts are often a reflection of the society they embody: through establishing the similarities in context and theme, Pacino is able to convey the works of Shakespeare to a modern audience by enhancing the antics of Richard III through the medium of film, reimagining character and context in a modern twist."
