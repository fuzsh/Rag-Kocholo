        "text": "(born 1940). Perhaps best known for The Godfather movie trilogy, American actor Al Pacino enjoyed a distinguished career in motion pictures. He often portrayed intense, explosive characters. Pacino won an Academy Award for best actor for his role as an embittered blind man in Scent of a Woman (1992).\n\nBorn in New York, New York, on April 25, 1940, Alfredo Pacino attended the High School of Performing Arts in New York City. He held such jobs as mail delivery boy and movie theater usher before being accepted for training at the Actors Studio in 1966. In 1969 Al Pacino made his Broadway debut and won a Tony Award for his performance in the play Does the Tiger Wear a Necktie?\n\nPacino’s first leading role in a film came with The Panic in Needle Park (1971), a grim tale of heroin addiction. He leaped to movie-star status in The Godfather (1972), in which he played the role of Michael Corleone, and then solidified his standing as one of Hollywood’s most dynamic stars in his next few films. In Scarecrow (1973), he played a transient, and his roles in Serpico (1973) and Dog Day Afternoon (1975) displayed his characteristic screen qualities of brooding seriousness and explosive rage. He also repeated the role of Corleone in The Godfather, Part II (1974), a film that, like its predecessor, won the best picture Oscar.\n\nAfter a few failed movies, Pacino starred in Scarface (1983), another combustible, high-intensity role. His next big film was Sea of Love (1989), which helped to reestablish him as a major film star. He reprised the role of Corleone in The Godfather, Part III (1990), but it was his portrayal of grotesque gangster Big Boy Caprice in Dick Tracy (1990) that won him a supporting actor Oscar nomination. Frankie and Johnny (1991) and Glengarry Glen Ross (1992) continued his string of well-received films, and he won a best actor Oscar for his work in Scent of a Woman (1992). Pacino’s other notable films of the 1990s include Carlito’s Way (1993), Heat (1995), Donnie Brasco (1997), Any Given Sunday (1999), and The Insider (1999).\n\nPacino continued his acting career into the early 21st century. In 2002 Pacino starred with Robin Williams in the thriller Insomnia, and he later appeared in Ocean’s Thirteen (2007), the final installment of a popular comedy trilogy that featured George Clooney and Brad Pitt. After appearing as himself in the Adam Sandler comedy Jack and Jill (2011), Pacino played an aging gangster in Stand Up Guys (2012).\n\nIn between his big-screen work, Pacino appeared in several cable television productions. For his role as a homophobic lawyer in Angels in America (2003), an adaptation of Tony Kushner’s two-part play about AIDS in the 1980s, he won an Emmy Award and a Golden Globe Award. Pacino’s performance as Jack Kevorkian, a doctor who assisted in the suicide of terminally ill patients, in the movie You Don’t Know Jack (2010) earned him the same awards. Pacino later starred as another controversial figure in David Mamet’s TV movie Phil Spector (2013), a docudrama set during the embattled record producer’s first trial for murder.\n\nPacino frequently returned to the stage throughout his career. He won a Tony Award for his leading role in The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel (1977) and also starred in such plays as Richard III (1973, 1979), American Buffalo (1980, 1981, 1983), Julius Caesar (1988), Salomé (1992, 2003, 2006), and Glengarry Glen Ross (2012). Pacino directed the documentary films Looking for Richard (1996) and Wilde Salomé (2011), which offered behind-the-scenes looks at two of his stage productions."
