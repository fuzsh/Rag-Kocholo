        "text": "hi all!\n\ni can totally understand your situation right now as i also have to study the same texts (when i would rather be doing something else)\n\ni actually have a major assessment tomorrow on both of these and was scrambling for material online before i found this post!\n\nfirst of all...CALM DOWN!!!\n\nit is super easy to find quotes online...just use google.\n\nRichard III (1592) :\n\nwhat you have to understand about the character Richard is, he is extremely honest to himself and is capable of drawing out and exploring everyone else's faults (basically becomes exquisitely in tune with them) and takes advantage of them and plays off them as they arise. This is where he is most dangerous (quote) \"It's the women's fault\". He is also well aware of deception directed towards him. He wants the throne for himself and does so by killing off any other heirs. His eldest brother, King Edward, is dying and richard needs him to kill Clarence before he dies, so he sets it all up and both Edward and Clarence die. Then Richard also kills off the children, hastings, rivers and anne (plus other) to get there.\n\nThe quote\n\n\"This day should Clarence closely be mewed up\n\nAbout a prophecy which says the 'G'\n\nOf Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.\" (Act 1 Sc 1)\n\n-is basically a prophecy told to King Edward has been set up by richard on his way to gain the throne. In the eyes of the king, 'G' stands for Clarence's first name 'George', but it actually stands for 'Gloucester', which Richard is the duke of.\n\nRichard also heavily uses double meaning for example \"Brother, farewell. I will unto the king\" this quote in Act 1 Sc 1 is richard saying a simple farewell to Clarence who believes he is simply saying it because he is parting from his presence, but richard saying farewell because he will die very soon. this is backed up by \"Well, your imprisonment shall not be long\" a couple of lines later pertaining to his quickly approaching demise.\n\nyou should also take notice of use of irony throughout the play \"Cursed the heart that had the heart to do it\" (Act 1 Sc 2 by Anne)\n\nthis is also a very important scene as it exposes Richards seductive side. while he claims he is 'rudely stamped', shakespeare exposes his ability to seduce simply through a tennis match of words between anne and richard with richard twisting anne's words somewhat. he is actually most deceitful when he is really telling the truth, because the real truth is too unbelievable. \"But since you teach me how to flatter you\" richard actually manages to turn a woman who starts off cursing him, to being persuaded into later becoming his wife (whom he kills, because she is needless to him) Two really useful quotes follow after she exits, which display to the audience richards intentions for anne and the future:\n\n\"Was ever woman in this humor wooed?\n\nWas ever woman in this humor won?\"\n\nand\n\n\"I'll have her, but I will not keep her long.\"\n\n*exhales*...there i hope that helps even a little bit in trying to understand Richard.\n\nalso, if you buy a copy of richard III with notes disecting each page on the opposite side of the text, it really helps.\n\nLooking for Richard (1996):\n\nLooking for Richard incorporate the famous Al Pacino. you should his other films such as Scarface, to really get an understanding of him as a person and how he acts.\n\nthe main question when you face this docu-drama is \"how does he make it accessible to modern american audiences?\"\n\nthe answers are:\n\nthemes\n\nchoice of costuming - Elizabethan\n\nsoundcraft\n\ntechniques (such as camera angles, interviews, voice over, switching between fully costumed to arguing around a table...etc)\n\ndialogue\n\nsettings\n\n...plus more\n\nthe technique of switching between practising and then in costume is a highly effective technique used by Pacino to create a modern setting. Also, seeing behind the scenes, when actors are arguing and discussing and stumbling through the text just like a anybody else etc. allows the audience to feel more on the same level as the actors and not as if they are simply watching that can do things they can't. this in turn makes it a hell of a lot more accessible to the intended audience.\n\nAl Pacino uses the fact the R III is a play full of irony, so the film is also full of irony. \"Irony is just hypocrisy with style\" (Barbara Everett)\n\ndefinitions of irony: wishing people good speed, but actually wishing them to their death.\n\nyou'll notice that Pacino is actually a little obsessed with richard and is almost a bit conceited when it comes to playing his part. you see that queen elizabeth's and richmond's (especially in the final scene, what a crappy battle!) power is downplayed heavily. i personally believe Pacino could be a bit full of himself and is not making the film as accessible as it could be.\n\nwhile the original play was written about acting and to showcase an elizabthen actors talent, the film is about actors and acting. you can use this as a connection, but explore it more to gain evidence, concepts, etc.\n\nsomething i found really handy was the entire script of the film here:\n\nLooking For Richard Script - transcript from the screenplay and/or Al Pacino movie about the making of Richard III\n\nit was easier to break down the film and gain quotes from this script.\n\nthese are good quotes i collected:\n\n\"actors on the stage, not knowing where they are going, not knowing where they are\"\n\n\"you think that you are communicating but the other person hasn't understood a word you said\" (discussing comprehension of shakespeare and its language, same with the following quote)\n\n\"you have to be in tune with it, you have to tune up.\"\n\n(discussing Shakespeare's language an actor demonstrates the differences between todays language and shakespeare's)\n\n'people say, \"Hey you, go over there, get that thing, and bring it back to me\", but shakespeare would say, \"Be mercury, set feathers to thy heels, and fly like thought from them to me again.\"\n\n\"Richard III is too complicated\" (helps to align actors with audience)\n\n\"Shakespeare, what the fuck do you know about Shakespeare?\"\n\n\"He (shakespeare) instructed us.\"\n\n\"Great words, great meaning\"\n\n\"irony is just hypocricy with style\"\n\n\"The music, and the thoughts, and the concepts, and the feelings have not been divorced from the words, and in england you've had centuries in which england has been totally divorced form truth, and thats a problem for us actors.\"\n\nthis next quote was said by an african american, who they found on the streets, who seemed uneducated, but he came out with this which is amazing:\n\n\"And we think words are things, and we have no feelings in our words, and we say things to each other that don't mean anything. But if we felt what we said, we'd say less and mean more.\"\n\nok.... my brain is totally fried. i hope this makes sense and is not too confusing. the best thing to do is take your time and pace yourself, don't leave everything to the last minute, as i have done... lol\n\nfrom Mikki"
