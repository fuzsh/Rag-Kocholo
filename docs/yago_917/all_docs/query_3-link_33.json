        "text": "Pacino begins his documentary with a voiceover reciting an extract from The Tempest, whilst the audience sees Pacino in a basketball park, where a boy is shooting balls, an all American pastime-\n\nOur revels now are ended .Pacino substitutes our revel is now at an end\n\nThese our actors,\n\nAs I foretold you, were all spirits, and\n\nAre melted into air, into thin air;\n\nAnd, like the baseless fabric of this vision,\n\nThe cloud-capped towers, the gorgeous palaces,\n\nThe solemn temples,\n\nYea, all which it inherit, shall dissolve;\n\nAnd, like this insubstantial pageant faded,\n\nLeave not a rack behind. We are such stuff\n\nAs dreams are made on, and our little life\n\nIs rounded with a sleep. (IV.i.148–158\n\nPACINO:” It’s always been a dream of mine to communicate how I feel about Shakespeare to other people. So I asked my friend, Frederick Kimble, who is an actor and writer and colleagues, Michael Hadge and James Bullett to join me, and taking this one play, Richard 111,and by analysing it from different angles, putting on costumes, playing out scenes, we could communicate our passion for it, our understanding that we have come to, and by doing that communicate a Shakespeare that is how we feel and how we think today. Now that’s the effort we’re going to get here. At least the head start is that I’ve done it. The problem is, this is a difficult play.”\n\nPAC” who should say action? Do you want to say action? I don’t want to.\n\nVOICEOVER “action!”\n\nPAC ( fumbling to find the opening in the curtain in an old style theatre) are they out there? This is my entrance? (enters stage as if in an audition, sees actor costumed as Shakespeare.)\n\nPAC. f—!\n\nSTREET PERSON VOX POP “ I’m actually reading sk , been reading it for 6months. I can’t get the hang of it\n\nSTREET PERSON 2 BLACK MAN “Intelligence is hooked with language . when we speak with no language we get nothing out of our society. We should speak like Shakespeare. We should introduce sk into the academics. You know why? Because then the kids would have feelings.\n\nPAC” that’s right!”\n\nST. PERSON 2 “So we have no feelings. That’s why it’s easy for us to get a gun and shoot each other. We don’t feel for each other, but if we were taught to feel, we wouldn’t be so violent.\n\nPAC “ Sk helps us ?\n\nST PERSON 2 “ He did more than help us. He instructed us.”\n\nBRANAGH “I was brought up in a school where sk was taught very kind of straight forwardly and dully, to be honest. We read it aloud and it made no sense because there was no connection made.\n\nJ. EARL JONES “ my own experience was in the field of Michigan. An uncle.. came out of the field one day and started narrating antony’s speech, the final oration.\n\nPAC “sk. Julius Caesar ?”\n\nJONES “yeah we’d heard stuff from the Bible, but my first time, as a kid, I was hearing great words, have great meaning.”\n\nPACINO asks people on the streets re their knowledge of Shakespeare, in particular R111. He limps with a disabled leg and arm (similar to sk’s R111)\n\nPAC’ “we’re peddling Shakespeare”\n\nPAC I’ve done it, you’ve done it . the problem is the audience hasn’t done it. I mean nobody knows who Richard 111 is ! nobody!\n\nAfter picking up a large, antiquated book of Shakespeare’s works\n\nPAC “let’s work out of a smaller book. This is hard to carry. Oh it’s my entrance ..falls into a chair due to the weight of the book. Symbolises the enormity of the task ahead. “I see!” (statement on the accessibility of traditional sk, changes to a more modern, portable copy of sk, more akin to contemporary opinion.\n\nBegins 1st .soliloquy\n\nPAC (around table, rehearsals in progress) “ see what we’ve gotta do what we should do, is get actors in here, not audition them, just get them in and let them just sit around, just see and read. We’ll have different people read different roles. Hopefully, somehow the roles and the actors will merge. The actors will find the role. An actor will read one part, another actor reads another. Dorset and Grey are the same people! We used 2 actors in the same part. It’s going to take 4 weeks of rehearsals to figure out what parts we’re playing.\n\nPAC “In modern plays, you understand it, it’s there for you but in sk you have an entire company on the stage good actors, not knowing where they’re going, where they are?”\n\nPAC “ What is it about being American that makes our actors just stop when it comes to sk.?\n\n“ the problem with being an American in Sk, is you approach it reverentially, we have a feeling, I think, of inferiority, of the way it has been done by the British.”\n\nAMERICAN SCHOLAR “ I think americans have been made to feel inhibited because they’ve been told so long by their critics, by their scholars and commentators that they can’t do Shakespeare. There fore, they think they can’t and they become totally self- conscious. American actors are not self-conscious. But they are when it comes to Shakespeare because they’ve been told they can’t do it and they foolishly believed that.\n\nFEMININE SCHOLAR: “It’s the greatest period in British arts ,you know,. This extraordinary development and maturing and death of drama. In 20 years sk’s over. You’ve got our greatest british drama and sk learns incredibly fast and already, in this early play, he’s thinking about human beings as actors and about the stage and the imagination as a bit of life.”\n\nCONWAY (hastings) experienced classics have a few things they can use at a moment’s notice, the understanding of iambic pentameter, for one thing.\n\nComparison of iambic pentameter –Kimble-“ anteater”!! (even pacino is bemused!) Redgrave (English actress)” rhythm found through ‘soul’, the essence of what is being conveyed through Sk.”\n\nLANGUAGE:\n\nPacino compares Sk’s language with rap music.\n\nKIMBLE: “Shakespeare used a lot of fancy words. You know. It’s hard to understand, grasp them”\n\nPAC “They’re not fancy words. That’s where we get confused. But they’re poetry. It’s hard to grab hold of some rap slang too. It’s hard to get hold of it until your ear gets tuned. You have to tune up.”\n\nREDGRAVE ON LANGUAGE AND ACTING😦voice over Whilst camera scans 20C view of actors who are playing the parts of those cursed by marg.)\n\n“The music, literally, I mean the music and the thoughts and the concepts and the feelings have not been divorced from the words, and in England you’ve had centuries in which word has been totally divorced from truth and that’s a problem for us actors.”\n\nBLACK MAN –VOX POP: If we think words a re things and we have no feelings in our words and then we say things to each other that don’t mean anything. But if we felt what we said, we’d say less and mean more.—–(moves on) -Spare some change”\n\nMICHAEL HADGE: “How much more are we gonna shoot? It’s a movie about a play. We’re making a documentary about making sk accessible to people. Those people, those people in the street they’re not gonna get R111. I can’t even get it. It’s too complicated.”\n\nKIMBLE:’’ Then why is it sk’s most popular play? Why is it performed more than any other sk play? “\n\nPAC: ”wait what did you say? “\n\nHADGE: ”Who says it’s popular?”\n\nKIMBLE’’ It is! It’s performed more than Hamlet’\n\nHADGE “so what!”\n\nAction jumps back on stage, to scene where R111 organises clarence’s death.\n\nALLURE OF EVIL/ LUST FOR POWER\n\nAfter the scene where Edward dies, his face shown through the camera lens with coins on his eyes\n\nHADGE “he’s dead! Okay!\n\nPAC (appearing agitated) “Well what are we gonna do?” Okay? ( questioning the effectiveness of the scene/ or his next move?..)\n\nKIMBLE “ I Like it.\n\nHADGE “what’s next?”\n\nPAC (ignoring hadge, addressing kimble aggressively) “what do you mean “I like it!?” Pacino appears as equally as agitated/ exuberant as sk’s r111 would be at this point in his process to be king .he has overcome his major obstacles. To exaggerate this, the scene switches to show Pac and crew trudging through a forest.\n\nMAN 1.“what time is it? 3.30? What are they doing, do you know?”\n\nMAN2. “Freddie said something about burying the king.’\n\nMAN1.” Is that in the play?”\n\nTaking the crown – highlighted on screen\n\nAfter this they stage a mock ‘wake’ ,in 20C fashion. A deep wail can be head from Allen (Elizabeth) whilst Pacino(Richard!!!) puts an arm around her to comfort her on the loss of her husband.. In true method acting, both characters are still consumed/become the characters they play on stage.\n\nPAC: “here it goes, this is it!”\n\nKIM “This is the crunch”\n\nPAC “Now we can say Richard is the most powerful man at this point” All this is said through a voice over whilst PAC (rich) is comforting ALLEN(eliz) at the ‘wake’. It then switches to the stage where ALLEN/Eliz is reciting, upon the news of Edward’s death “Alive! ..all of us have cause to wail…star” 2,2,101.\n\nKIM “The crisis is, are they going to live by the words that they spoke to the king? Or are they not? Is the peace going to hold?\n\nOn stage ? PAC (R111).“I hope the king made peace with all of us…And the compact is firm and true in me” 2,2,132.\n\nPacino and Spacey (Buckingham) discuss the deceit/politics behind Richard’s and Buckingham’s moves.\n\nPacino and Spacey act out following scene in 20C garb.\n\nSPACEY(BUCK) “now my lord….will not yield to our complots” .\n\nPAC (rich)“Chop….when I am king claim…the king my brother was possest.” 3,1, 193-197\n\nSpacey displays he coverts (as Buck)Pacino’s (rich’s)promise of fortune/power by the close of his eyes/facial expression, whilst pacino places his arm around him.\n\nThey discuss the logistics/politics of their partnership whilst sitting on the coach together\n\nSPACEY” this is like the surreity. Like the guys who did the Iran contra stuff, the dirty work. Propped up to the king”\n\nPACINO “Without Buckingham there’s no Richard as king”\n\nSPACEY “ Couldn’t do it alone. But they never can!”\n\nSCHOLAR “Sk saw Rich and Buck as high class, upper class thugs”\n\nShot of Pac and Spac with hats on backwards, indicative of belonging in the same gang.Spacey says jokingly\n\nSPACEY “there’s been no influence here has there?? No influence??\n\nPACINO “ you’re a pretty smart guy” (referring to Buck)\n\nCrosses on stage to Allen (Elizabeth), after she has been told by a messenger that the “the mighty dukes, Gloucester and Buckingham” have ordered the deaths of her brother, son and friend 2,4,46\n\nALLEN (Eliz)on stage ‘I see the ruin of my house ….the end of all’ 2,4,51-56\n\nBack to 20C commentary between Pac and Spac re their partnership\n\nPAC” Now what’s happened is Rich and Buck have betrayed everybody\n\nSPACEY laughs\n\nPAC “they did. They went to Ludlow to pick up this prince. It was supposed to be peaceful but what they did they forced him out from under his uncle’s arms and they’ve stolen this kid\n\nKIMBLE” They’re bringing him back. What they’ve really got there is the throne of England, in their arms”\n\nPACINO “the future”\n\nMuch of this has been said in voice over whilst the scenes play the meeting of the young princes on horse back. We now see Richard limping up to meet the prince’s entourage singing\n\nPAC “he’s got the whole world in his hands”\n\nSwitches to voice over of part of rich’s opening sol. Globe theatre where Pacino explores the acoustics of sk’s theatre and tries to get a feel for the essence of the lines he has to deliver, the character of Richard.\n\nLANGUAGE\n\nScene in 20c garb reciting the lines re assessing Hastings’approval to place Rich on the\n\nCONWAY (hastings)“the crown”3,2,41-44.\n\nHowever all the following speech is delivered in contemporary language.\n\nBRIGGYMAN (Catesby) “think about it “\n\nCONWAY (hastings) “let me tell you something. I will have this crown (indicates his own head) this crown ripped off and shoved into a cow’s belly before I would allow that scum to defile the crown by putting it on his head “\n\nSCHOLAR “The text is only a means of expressing what’s behind the text. If you get obsessed with the text . This is a great barrier to American actors, who get obsessed with the british way of regarding a text. That isn’t what matters. What matters is that you have to penetrate into what, at every moment, it’s about.”\n\nPACINO “our intent here was to display that actors shouldn’t let the unfamiliar language diffuse their ability to portray the deeper meaning and crux of the text.” Some of the other actors look shocked/confused.\n\nALLURE OF EVIL/ PURSUIT OF POWER\n\nConway on discussing the impact of the scene where the noblemen are gathered to decide the date for the coronation of King Edward. 3,4-\n\nCONWAY “Remember we talked the other day about a gathering of the dons, in a way.? There’s a lot of suspicion in this room. I think there’s a danger to be in this room. All of us in one spot and it’s like somebody says “just wait here, I’ll be back “ and it’s been like “what’s going on?” (Conway is using the contemporary analogy of the meeting of the mafia, eg the movie “the godfather part two ” for which Pacino won an academy award, and in which Pacino played a don who, through similar treacherous methods as Richard ,secured the most powerful position in the mafia.\n\nPAC ‘They have to cut out Hastings and only Richard has the power to do it. He’s a royal and he’s a york, only he’s got to move fast. It’s his last chance to stop Hastings from making the prince king.”\n\nKIMBLE” they’re going to suck in hastings. Provoke him to say the wrong thing .”\n\nPAC “then everyone in the room is going to have to make a choice. It’s either him or Gloucester.\n\nHe was the only fly in the ointment. They’ve got the inner circle. They’ve intimidated all the dukes and earls. They managed to intimidate all of them so now all that is left is winning the people.”\n\nSpacey comments, using contemporary examples, how persuading the people/ mob has essentially been the same procedure. Large numbers of people together, are apt to lose their individuality and become gullible to one consensus. Suggests this has been/is universal..\n\nSPACEY voice over “everytime there’s an election in this country, whether for mayor, whether it’s for president or city council, it’s always the fact people are tired of the way it’s been and just want a change “ scene shows spacey standing on a podium, 20c, trying to rouse the people to accept his agenda\n\nSPAC “I expected their reaction to be boisterous and that they would come and rally.”\n\nScene is on stage.\n\nPAC (rich) “and did they so?”\n\nSPAC (buck) No, so God help me, they spake not a word…looked deadly pale” 3,7,23-26\n\nPAC (repeats) “and did they so?\n\nSPAC (Buck) “ No! what are you deaf!! Pacino and Spacey are bantering with each other in humour during this exchange.seems to further extol their union both on and off stage.\n\nFurther 20C commentary between Pacino and Spacey re the manipulation of the people, the evil both are planning to make Richard king.\n\nSPAC “ I’m saying, whatever their reaction it doesn’t matter, we still had this plan.”\n\nPAC” we still had this plan”\n\nSome voice over occurs as we see pacino/ Richard standing righteously between two priests, bible in hand!\n\nSPAC” so they’re being told that here, right before your very eyes, is the man who will make it better.”\n\nSCHOLAR “Irony is only hypocrisy with style. Here again we love richard’s irony, in a way. We know he’s as hard as nails, that he’s only pretending to be religious.”\n\nPAC “ they canvas like politicians, complete with lies and innuendo. They manage to malign this young prince, who is the rightful heir to the throne and they know it! And they say he was a bastard that his father was a bastard. It’s an act and these people are buying it, it’s a complete lie!”\n\nREDGRAVE “ in the midst of these noble concepts, these treaties and diplomatic pacts, he was saying, the truth beneath all this is absolutely the opposite. The truth is that, those in power have total contempt for everything they promise, everything they pledge. And that’s what sk’s great play is about.”\n\nCrosses to party where American amateur directors are discussing their personal interpretations of how they produced/ adapted Shakespeare’s plays for a contemporary audience. Pacino in method acting style, slumps against Kimble seemingly overcome by his desire to become king.\n\nPACINO ‘’take me away, this has gone too far. I want, I want, I want to be king! That’s what I want!\n\nKIMBLE” as soon as he gets what he wants, as soon as he gets Lady Anne, the crown . As soon as he gets the whole thing.”\n\nPAC “ the emptiness of it.”\n\nScene where Pacino and Spacey are discussing the reasons for Richard’s need to kill the young princes. The dialogue reveals that both share a similar opinion as would the characters they are playing on stage.\n\n4,2.\n\nSPACEY ‘ why is it necessary now to kill them? What difference? It’s? “\n\nPACINO” but as long as they live???”\n\nFEMALE SCHOLAR” everybody may have a price but for a lot of people there is a fundamental decency. It takes quite a long time for them to reach that point. The action of the play, the sense of exciting movement is Richard’s finding out the point beyond which people won’t go”\n\nScene 4,2,11-33,on stage. Richard requests that Buckingham organises the murder of the two princes. Buckingham is unsure whether he wants to give consent to this part of the plan. Spacey also comments on his view of his character’s, Buckingham’s position, summation at this point in the proceedings.\n\nSPACEY” it’s an interesting question where Buckingham is. How far he’s willing to go, where he’s willing to draw the line. It’s almost as if everything Buckingham does in the play, somehow he manages to keep the blood off his hands. On stage 4,2, 26-29.\n\nFEMALE SCHOLAR “ He is bound to be left alone because nobody can love the King beyond the degree of their egotism or their own goodness. There’s going to be a point. He has reached Buckingham’s point.”\n\nOn stage pacino /Richard recites 4,2, 45-48.\n\nSPACEY” when he went away, did he agree to do it, or was he gonna condemn and say I can’t but give me what you promised.”\n\nKIMBLE” I have a feeling that he’ll come back and say. Okay. We have to do it, let’s bite the bullet. Let’s do it! But it’s too late”\n\nKimble and Pacino discussing Richard’s position after the fallout between Richard and Buckingham.\n\nKIMBLE “you stand on brittle ground. Will it last, or will someone next week say, “ Hey they got a bum rap. Let’s push the case for the kids. The kids have got to go!”\n\nScene on stage shows messengers delivering updates re the present conditions of the ensuing war.4,4,519-537. Off stage Pacino shows signs of agitation with Kimble\n\nKIMBLE” he suspects everyone around him. He has no friends.\n\nPAC “ I,m listening , I’m listening!!”\n\nUpcoming Battle\n\nMETHOD ACTING/ ALLURE OF EVIL/POWER\n\nPacino appears to emulate the psychological state that R111 is feeling at this stage of the play by replicating it with a physical demise of his own. Pacino coughs after drinking coffee, appears flu like.\n\nPAC “ am I dying, am I dying? That’s what I want to know.\n\nKIM (largely ignoring pacino)” when are we gonna kill Richard. I have a worse question.\n\nPAC” (as if there couldn’t be a worse question) ‘excuse me!!” (looks away)\n\nKIMBLE “ I have a feeling that YOUR Richard will have earned his death and we should think about a way to do it.\n\nPAC ( flu like coughing) “close the door” ( repeat bout of coughing\n\nKIM (taking pacino’s temperature, who seems to be obsessed with his health) 98.6 put it under your tongue!\n\nPAC ( a little obsessive) “if I’m 98.6 then you’re a shakespearean actor!\n\nSCHOLAR” I think what is fascinating, is that when you come to the last act, to the battle of Bosworth, the battle itself goes for very little, apart from “ my horse, my horse. My kingdom for a horse.” It seems to me that the battle is really the ghost scene. The ghost scene is the battle. “\n\nPAC “ Richard is visited in his sleep by the ghosts of all the people he murdered”\n\nPAC (voice over whilst showing the theatre) “So Frederick and I decided to go to the actual theatre where this play, where Richard 111 was performed some 300 years ago, and this ghost scene was acted on the stage her, in London. We’d thought we’d rehearse and see if we could get a sense of those old spirits. You know, method acting type stuff. “\n\nPAC (talking, rehearsing with kimble) “I’ve always had trouble with this speech. It’s good when an actor has trouble with a speech and goes in there and tries to do it”\n\nKIMBLE” I’ve heard you talking about Richard as a man who cannot find love. A person, who finally in the last scenes, knows that he does not have his own humanity, that he’s lost it. That he has lost the pursuit of power. Totally corrupt he is alienated from his own body and his own self.”\n\n(pacino practices the ghost scene on stage ( in 20C garb) with Kimble. Scenes cut back and forth to show pacino(R111) in costume acting the ghost scenes 5,3 184-\n\nPAC ( as R111)“ who is there?\n\nKIM (as ratcliffe) it is I\n\nPAC ( jokingly)” well get out of here, I’m working.”\n\nKIM “you got it!”\n\nPAC Let’s try it one more time. (pacino’s eagerness for complete absorption of the character/ role of R111)\n\nThis scene is set outside on the plains, the scene for the battle. The various actors are at the top of the hill watching the ensuing battle offering commentary as if they were part of an audience/on lookers commenting on the battle’s process.\n\nALLEN (as Elizabeth) “They withdraw”\n\nKIMBLE (in costume) “the ranks are breaking !”\n\nALLEN “see! they’re deserting him!!”\n\nThe scene switches down onto the battle field in costume 5,4,7-13\n\nFEMALE SCHOLAR “ although he’s frightfully clever, he is, at the same time, like a kind of boar who has subsumed into himself all these frightful animal images and all that the rest have to do is hunt the boar. And that‘s what they do and they get him!”\n\nSTREET PERSON (VOX POP) “he’s a hearty dude, and in the end he’s surrounded, and he just goes , you know, he’ll give up anything for a horse. He’s rich, a king and he needs a horse. You know.”\n\nAfter the scene where R111 is killed, pacino acts out a death scene,with kimble,in 20Cgarb, on the stairs outside a 20C building, with background bells chiming. Pac is lying on kimble’s lap.\n\nKIM “ I didn’t mean it . I didn’t mean it”\n\nPAC” I love you Frederic “\n\nKIM” “ I didn’t mean it.”\n\nPAC (looking at the camera) “he didn’t mean it??” and you kill me after all I did for you.”\n\nBack to the original shot of the actor playing sk. Who looks away in disdain.\n\nKIM” Richard’s dead. At last we can rest!”\n\nPacino acts dead again on the lap of Kimble. Scene switches to the battle scene where R111 ‘s death is acted in costume. 5, 4. Pacino portrays his character’s death with a certain heroism. He fights Richmond, on his knees with two arrows in him and with only one strong arm!! ( no need for political bias here!). Rather, Pacino is determined to portray the character he has become, through the process of method acting, with a certain stoic honour right to the end. 5,5,1.\n\n( Hadge and Bullet after watching the end scenes\n\nHADGE” is this it? Is this it?\n\nBUL “ I hope so!”\n\nHAD” are we done? This is it”\n\nHAD “ you know, if I told him about the other 10 rolls of film, he’d want to use them!”\n\nPAC “ I love the silence, I love the silence (said after further shot of dead R111). After silence, what else is there? What’s the line?”\n\nGIELGUD (iconic sk’n actor) “the rest is silence “\n\nPAC” “silence. Whatever I’m saying , I know Shakespeare said it!”\n\nPacino ends the documentary as he begins it, with a quote from Shakespeare’s The Tempest 4,1, 148-158.\n\nReturning to the opening scene, the basketball court with the boy throwing baskets.\n\nOur revels now are ended .Pacino substitutes our revel is now at an end"
