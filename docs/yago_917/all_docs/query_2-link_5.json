        "text": "In this mold-breaking documentary Pacino encourages actors to share their perspectives on Shakespeare in general and his formidable Richard III in particular, in an effort to both honor and demystify the playwright and his prose. The result earned Pacino a Directors Guild of America Award. Play rehearsal and performance footage stars Pacino, Winona Ryder, Alec Baldwin, and more; expert-witness interviewees include Peter Brook, John Gielgud, Rosemary Harris, and James Earl Jones."
