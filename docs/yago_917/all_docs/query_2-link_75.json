        "text": "This is my second film in my Shakespeare marathon, and my thesis so far is that these adaptations are the “fan fiction” of their age. These are the Marvel movies for mid-century Anglophiles.\n\nI enjoyed the production design, and the wonderful use of Technicolor. As a side note, the film is shot in VistaVision (my favorite format), instead of a wider screen aspect ratio such as Cinemascope. I think all of the visual elements added a sense of realism to the film, although they were clearly on a soundstage. There is something tangible and identifiable about the sets. They reminded me of the Archer films from around the same time.\n\nBut the real noteworthy element in the film is Olivier…\n\nMatthew Ekstrom's #3 Film Selection for Edgar\n\nThe cinematic Shakesperian adapter by excellence along with Orson Welles and above his descendant Kenneth Branagh, exalter of the gracious richness of dialogue, the constructer of royal and historical epicness Sir Laurence Olivier, produces and directs Shakespeare's tale set in 15th Century England about the tragic account of King Richard III, a man doomed to the treachery of his own deadly ambitions of power.\n\nFilmed as a spectacle and with a very ambitious scope which accentuates during the final act that takes place at the battle scene of Bosworth Fields, excellently acted by the entire ensemble cast, including the youngest side, with all of the most relevant plot's intricacies almost perfectly summarized into…\n\n2nd Laurence Olivier (after Henry V)\n\nNormally, I don't like Shakespeare. Like any former UK school-kid, I had to study him for GCSE and A-Level, and then it was mostly reading and closely analysing the words. If you did watch an adaptation, it was either the ridiculously uncinematic BBC versions, which are good in preserving fidelity to the text, or that laughably awful Romeo + Juliet. To me, then, Shakespeare was about as interesting as taking a warm bath in wallpaper paste. I tried many times to get into his plays but each time left with a distinct feeling of 'eh' (on another note, Malvolio is actually a victim in Twelfth Night. He's mocked for doing his job and unnecessarily…\n\nBabe wake up, live-action Lord Farquad just dropped.\n\nRichard III was one of the great villains of Shakespeare, and one of the most controversial kings of England - his looming reputation makes it even funnier that archeologists found him buried under a parking lot in Leicester in 2012. Though the original play was substantially cut down for this film adaptation (and upsetting the Shakespeare purists as a result), Olivier's role as actor, director, and producer resulted in changes that actually improved the story for the screen - the period details were exceptional for the time, the use of direct soliloquy to the audience was fitting for a self-serving man without scruples, and Olivier introduces several narrative tweaks and physical mannerisms…\n\nRichard III is Laurence Olivier's (ahem) crowning achievement as a producer and director of Shakespeare on film. Despite the reputation of Henry V as wartime propaganda (which is true but has also given many an easy way to unfairly dismiss it), the film is really an argument for translating Shakespearean theater to cinema. Hamlet allows Olivier to explore cinematic technique even further by incorporating elements of film noir, German Expressionism, and Universal horror into the sets and cinematography. Yet, in that film, Olivier eradicated many of the play's political aspects by eliminating Rosencrantz and Guildenstern and softening the character of Polonius. And then we're all probably familiar with Olivier in blackface in Othello.\n\nWith Richard III, Olivier is in top…\n\nThere's certainly plenty to enjoy in this production, but one of the things I most got into was Laurence Olivier's vanity as a director/producer/star. As usual with Shakespeare's plays, a big chunk of the text has been cut for the screen, but the cuts here seem particularly telling, as they tend to be wherever people other than Olivier might steal the limelight. \"Hey, guys, the Duke Of Clarence is a brilliant orator, be careful when you go to murder him, because he's got some great speeches that might talk you out of it — oh, never mind, we cut those.\" End-of-play summary speeches? Nah, let's just end it with \"My kingdom for a horse,\" who cares what happens once Olivier's…\n\nA Year of Film History Challenge 2019\n\n(watching a little bit of film history month by month, decade by decade)\n\n--\n\nThere's a scene in Laurence Olivier's screen adaptation of the William Shakespeare play Richard III where the power-hungry Richard's allies are going through the theatrics of publicly entreating him to become king while he's in the middle of giving a speech, with him then saying no and pretending like this isn't what he's wanted all along, and then his little faux fan club basically goes 'aww shucks' and starts to leave when suddenly someone starts begging Richard to change his mind and so, arm sufficiently twisted for all to see, Richard calls the \"huge crowd\" back to the balcony…\n\n\"And thus clothe my naked villainy with odd old ends stol'n out of holy writ; And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.\" - Richard III\n\nWilliam Shakespeare Adaptations Ranked\n\nCheck out my \"Movies LONG AF ranking\" here\n\nYou can't call yourself a fan of The Bard if you've never seen a Laurence Olivier adaptation and now, I have and lemme just say: it was an Olivier Shakespeare adaptation.\n\nPower. \"Absolute power corrupts absolutely\", that's how the saying goes. But we often forget the pursuit of it. Can't it be argued that those who pursue it are corrupted to begin with? Their chase is synonymous with leaving allies behind, stepping on others to get ahead and manipulation. Lots…\n\n63/100\n\nI feel like a bit like Bob and Doug McKenzie after Geddy Lee does his first solo in \"Take Off\":\n\nBob: Decent singin', eh?\n\nDoug: Yeah.\n\nBob: Yeah, he's good.\n\nWhich is to say, who the hell am I to take issue with Olivier, who had a far more profound knowledge and understanding of this play than I ever will? All the same, while I understand that he didn't want to make a four-hour movie, some of his cuts to the text seem fundamentally misguided. Specifically, he's excised virtually every speech pertaining to self-reflection and regret: Clarence's murderers hesitating (and nearly letting themselves be talked out of the deed); all the material involving Margaret's curses (indeed, Margaret entirely); Buckingham's…"
