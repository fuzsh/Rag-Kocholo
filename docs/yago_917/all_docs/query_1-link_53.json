        "text": "English director Newell coaxes restrained performance from\n\nPacino\n\nBy Brandon Wilson\n\nDaily Bruin Staff\n\nAl Pacino can sometimes make a person wonder where all the hype\n\ncomes from, like many actors of his esteemed generation. The actor\n\nfinally snagged an Oscar, after laboring for years without\n\nrecognition, for his hambone over-the-top portrayal of a blind\n\nex-army man in \"Scent of a Woman,\" and since then has seemed\n\ncontent to keep his performances in the stratosphere (see Michael\n\nMann’s \"Heat\" if you need convincing).\n\nBut there’s hope. Besides the pure moments captured in his pet\n\nproject documentary \"Looking For Richard,\" Pacino has finally\n\nturned in a performance worthy of his legendary status, playing an\n\nover-the-hill mobster in \"Donnie Brasco.\"\n\nBased on the true story of FBI Special Agent Joe Pistone’s\n\nundercover stint in the New York mob scene circa 1978 the film was\n\nwritten by Paul Attanasio (\"Quiz Show\") and directed by Mike Newell\n\n(\"Four Weddings and a Funeral,\" \"An Awfully Big Adventure\"). If\n\nEnglishman Newell seems an odd choice to lead this journey into\n\nScorseseland, well, that’s because he is. Newell’s move to direct a\n\nstory so far removed from his own milieu (and so associated with\n\nanother master of the medium) rings as either fearless or foolish.\n\nAnd while \"Donnie Brasco\" isn’t quite the tour de force that a\n\ntypical Scorsese gangster picks, the director brings some of his\n\nown unique talents to bear on the material.\n\nJohnny Depp plays Pistone, who goes undercover as jewel man\n\nDonnie Brasco. The film opens with Brasco/Pistone’s introduction to\n\n\"Lefty\" Ruggiero (Pacino), a wise guy with a reputation (he likes\n\nto cite the 26 hits under his belt, and that number rises by the\n\nstory’s end) but not a heavy-hitter or \"made man.\" The two meet\n\nwith Brasco informing Lefty that the diamond he just acquired is a\n\n\"fugazy\" (a fake in mob parlance), which of course highlights the\n\nfact that Brasco himself is a fugazy, but one good enough to fool\n\nLefty.\n\nUnlike other gangsters in his repertoire, Lefty isn’t a general\n\nor a thinking man’s hood like Michael Corleone, nor does he have\n\nthe razor-sharp street wit of Tony Montana or Carlito Brigante.\n\nLefty is, as he says in his own words, \"a spoke in a wheel,\" and he\n\nis painfully aware of his vulnerability. However, Lefty is enough\n\nof an insider to bring Donnie into the sub-culture of the good\n\nfella. Telling Donnie to shave his mustache, quit wearing jeans,\n\nand properly carry his wad of cash, Lefty becomes Donnie’s mentor\n\nand performs a makeover on Brasco like some Mafiosi version of \"My\n\nFair Lady.\" Lefty brings Donnie to Sonny (played by Michael Madsen\n\nof \"Species\"), a wise guy who’s young, strong and ruthless enough\n\nto be the next boss.\n\nPistone is a man in jeopardy on many levels. Besides being\n\nsurrounded by people who wouldn’t hesitate to kill him if they knew\n\nthe truth, he also has to contend with a crumbling marriage to wife\n\nMaggie (played by Anne Heche wielding a thick borough accent) and\n\nbattle his not-always cooperative superiors in Washington. Any man\n\nwho must swim in the equally treacherous pools of the New York\n\nunderworld and Washington law enforcement is one to pray for.\n\nAs Donnie gets cozy with Sonny’s crew and downright chummy with\n\nLefty (who replaces Donnie with the disappointment of a son he\n\nhas), the strain on Pistone begins to reach critical mass. His wife\n\nbegs him to pull out, but he tells her that the minute he pulls out\n\nLefty, who vouched for him, is a dead man.\n\nNewell’s otherness from this world (in sharp contrast to\n\nScorsese’s familiarity) brings a distinct perspective to \"Donnie\n\nBrasco.\" Much is made in the film of the language and expressions\n\nthe mobsters use, and the British director clearly infected his\n\nactors with his outsider’s appreciation for the quirky\n\nlanguage.\n\nPacino turns in his best (thank you, Mike Newell) and most\n\nrestrained performance in years as the affable and vulnerable\n\nLefty. Like the younger Pacino of the ’70s, he relies more on his\n\nquiet self rather than his pyrotechnics to convey internal turmoil.\n\nThe scene in which he quietly assesses his last shot at the brass\n\nring evaporating before his eyes midway though the film is moving\n\nand heartbreaking.\n\nDepp holds his own against the elder actor, handily playing host\n\nto all the conflicted emotions and interests of the G-man who runs\n\nwith the wolves. Newcomer Heche makes the most of a wife part, and\n\nthe resurrection of Michael Madsen from the grave of mediocre turns\n\nin bad films is truly inspiring. As up-and-comer Sonny, he reminds\n\nyou of what was so great about him in \"Reservoir Dogs,\" though\n\npractically every film he’s since done would lead you to\n\nforget.\n\nThough it may not leave the mark on the genre that films like\n\n\"Mean Streets\" and \"Goodfellas\" have, \"Donnie Brasco\" is one of the\n\nbest offerings from the gangster genre in years.\n\nFILM: \"Donnie Brasco\" opens today.\n\nColumbia/TriStar\n\nJohnny Depp in \"Donnie Brasco.\""
