        "text": "So I read Richard III.\n\nAnd I listened to Richard III.\n\nAnd although the 1995 movie starring Annette Bening was not available for rent, I did watch the 1955 movie directed by and starring Laurence Olivier. The movie was torturous even though I was on the treadmill.\n\nI also watched Al Pacino’s Looking for Richard and I wanted to write him a love letter–Al Pacino, that is, who with the movie is on a quest to help people understand Richard III and Shakespeare. The documentary could easily be titled Loving Shakespeare, or Loving Richard, or Loving Al. And I can’t wait to watch it again. But beware, if you watch it, you’re going to want to join me in my quest.\n\nConfession: I am seriously behind in my secondary reading–Bloom and Garber, primarily. Still, onward…\n\nSo Richard III. Here is where Shakespeare figures out how to start a play\n\nNow is the winter of my discontent\n\nMade glorious summer by this son of York\n\nVersus these first lines:\n\nHenry VI, Part One: Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night! [which is not bad]\n\nHenry VI, Part Two: As by your high imperial Majesty I had in charge at my depart for France…\n\nHenry VI, Part Three: I wonder how the King escaped our hands.\n\nThe power of the following passage hit me each time I heard it. To set the scene: Richard killed Lady Anne’s husband and her husband’s father, King Henry VI, and now he’s attempting to woo her with the dead King lying there beside them:\n\nSpeak it again and, even with the word,\n\nThis hand, which for thy love did kill thy love,\n\nShall for thy love kill a far truer love.\n\nTo both their deaths shalt thou be accessory.\n\n(Act 1, sc. 2, lines 207-210)\n\nIn this play, we have GHOSTS who visit Richard while he sleeps, a parade of all those he has killed or has had killed. When he wakes:\n\nWhat do I fear? Myself? There’s none else by.\n\nIs there a murderer here? No. Yes, I am.\n\nThen fly! What, from myself? Great reason why:\n\nLest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?\n\nAlack, I love myself. Wherefore? For any good\n\nThat I myself have done unto myself?\n\nO, no. Alas, I rather hate myself\n\nFor hateful deeds committed by myself.\n\nI am a villain. Yet I lie; I am not.\n\n(Act 5, sc. 3, lines 194-203)\n\nWandering the battlefield, it is Richard III who utters the famous lines:\n\nSurprise: to find the phrase pell mell in Shakespeare, but here it is in Richard’s address to his army:\n\n(Act 5, sc. 3, lines 330-331)"
