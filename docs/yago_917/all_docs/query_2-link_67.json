        "text": "To cap off an unforgettable weekend, D23: The Ultimate Disney Fan Event presented by Visa® will conclude on Sunday, August 11, with the Disney Legends Awards Ceremony. The Disney Legends Award honors artists and visionaries throughout The Walt Disney Company’s history who have pushed the envelope of creativity, challenged conventional wisdom, and broken the restraints of the status quo in search of new possibilities and excellence. A 37-year tradition, this year’s honorees include Colleen Atwood, Angela Bassett, Martha Blanding, James L. Brooks, James Cameron, Jamie Lee Curtis, Miley Cyrus, Steve Ditko, Harrison Ford, Mark Henn, Frank Oz, Kelly Ripa, Joe Rohde, and John Williams.\n\nIn an exclusive Q&A, Frank Oz—who is being recognized in the Film & Television category—reflects on his contributions to the company and what it means to be named a Disney Legend.\n\nHow does it feel to be honored as a Disney Legend—and to get to share in this year’s celebration with Harrison Ford following the previous inductions of George Lucas, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, James Earl Jones, Jon Favreau, and Ming-Na Wen?\n\nIt’s very nice to continue being in that Star Wars family.\n\nYoda means a lot to many people, but what does he mean to you?\n\nHe means struggle, humor, responsibility, steadfastness, and gravitas to me.\n\nYou played a number of beloved characters on The Muppet Show, and you did it alongside Disney Legend Jim Henson. What stands out about that time in your life?\n\nThe relationships with the Muppet writers and Muppet workshop, and playing with my fellow performers, and the fun and the hard work, and the fun of doing hard work with gifted people I cared about.\n\nHow did you transition into directing, and which Disney film are you most proud of?\n\nI always wanted to direct—theater, actually. But when Jim asked me to direct Dark Crystal with him, that opened a whole new groove that spoke to me. And because of Jim’s support I was able to transition into directing full time.\n\nAs for which Disney film I’m most proud of, I directed two things for Disney. One was a short segment about how sound was used in movies. It starred Mel Gibson, Pee Wee Herman, and Darryl Hannah; I felt I did a good job on that.\n\nAnd I also directed What About Bob? for Disney with Bill Murray and Richard Dreyfus, which I think turned out pretty good.\n\nYou reprised your role as Dave in Inside Out 2, which is now the biggest film in Pixar’s history. At this point in your career, what’s it like to be part of such a success?\n\nIt’s awesomely difficult.\n\nIn Inside Out 2, Dave Goelz and I reprised our roles of the two guards from the original Inside Out. We were very happy to have been asked again, but we feel we can’t keep carrying the success of Pixar’s movies on our shoulders. I just hope in the future Pixar will be able to create other movies that are not so dependent on us for their success."
