        "text": "The Stratford Festival’s 2022 production of William Shakespeare's Richard III, featuring Colm Feore in the title role, is available for streaming internationally via Stratfest@Home.\n\nDirected for the stage by Artistic Director Antoni Cimolino and for film by Barry Avrich, the cast also features Sean Arbuckle as Earl Rivers, Michael Blake as George (Duke of Clarence), Ben Carlson as Lord William Hastings, David Collins as Lord Stanley (Earl of Derby), Jessica B. Hill as Lady Anne, Diana Leblanc as Duchess of York, Seana McKenna as Queen Margaret, Lucy Peacock as Queen Elizabeth, André Sills as Duke of Buckingham, and Emilio Vieira as Sir William Catesby.\n\n“Shakespeare’s work is very cinematic in its structure, and this play, with its ruthless, cunning and charismatic protagonist, translates brilliantly to the big screen,” says Cimolino in a statement. “Colm Feore gives a masterful performance as Richard and is supported by powerful performances by our finest actors.”\n\n“When you combine the brilliant and iconic Shakespeare prose with the unbridled power of Colm Feore, the result is pure cinematic bliss,” adds Avrich, who is also the producer of the film. “Having produced and directed close to 20 of these filmed productions, I can assert that this one is a career highlight for me.”\n\nThe production’s creative team includes designer Francesca Callow, lighting designer Michael Walton, composer Berthold Carrière, and sound designer John Gzowski. Debbie Patterson is the disability consultant and dramaturg."
