        "text": "(Thanks Suzanne Brouillard for this info)\n\nWhen Al Pacino wanted to film a scene in my mom's bathroom, she welcomed him with open arms, By Stan Grossfeld, Globe Staff, 4/19/2001\n\nThe Academy Award-winning actor was searching for a bathroom to film two scenes of \"People I Know,\" costarring Kim Basinger, Ryan O'Neal, Téa Leoni, and Robert Klein. The movie - in which Pacino plays Eli Wurman, a once-great celebrity publicist struggling to maintain his power - was shot on several locations around New York City earlier this month and is scheduled for release early next year.\n\nThe offer came in a \"Dear Resident\" letter slid under the door of my mom's Greenwich Village apartment. The letter said a movie company was looking for a hallway leading straight into a bathroom with the original 1950s fixtures intact. My mom, Mildred, a retired schoolteacher who taught in the South Bronx for 30 years, responded quicker than the cops in \"Serpico.\"\n\nWhat woman is going to tell Pacino - who still looks dashing at 60 - that she doesn't want him to take a shower in her bathroom? Plus, Mom would get a nice location fee.\n\nA few days later, set designers arrived and placed a bottle of Mylanta Supreme, torn sheets of Mylanta Gels, Tylenol PM, and a Chivas Regal glass on the window sill behind the toilet. They hung a picture of Yale University, Wurman's alma mater, on the side wall and changed the shower curtain to powder blue.\n\nThirteen trucks, including a 90-foot-long trailer for Pacino, were parked outside. Forty-six people set up lights, taped the windows black, and shut the refrigerator. Three Grossfeld family members took turns sprucing up the porcelain bowl after each use.\n\nThen it was quiet on the set. His shirt-tail out and hair tousled, Pacino arrived, speaking in the Southern drawl of his character. A method actor par excellence, Pacino reportedly had been using this accent for months on and off the set.\n\n\"Take One and roll.\" The sound of tinkling, moaning, and an occasional swear word could be heard for 40 seconds. Pacino zipped up and staggered down the hallway before turning into the kitchen.\n\n\"Cut,\" said director Dan Algrant.\n\n\"I had to pee like an elephant,\" said Pacino.\n\n\"You forgot to flush,\" somebody said.\n\n\"Make it a shorter experience,\" said Algrant. \"And ... action.\"\n\nThey filmed the scene again, taking 35 seconds of toilet time. Pacino, dubbed \"Al Cappuccino\" for his love of caffeine, was wired. But how many doubles had he gulped? On the next take, we learned Pacino's secret: He had a hot water bottle filled with cranberry juice in his pants because he was supposed to be urinating blood. We knew because he forgot to shut off the valve and the juice dribbled all over mom's oriental rug.\n\nPacino shook his head sadly. \"Why do I have the feeling that the woman who owns this apartment is gonna sue me?\" he asked.\n\n\"Oh, no, she's not,\" said my sister, Sandy, a lawyer, as the crew laughed.\n\n\"Well, you're one of only a very few then,\" said Pacino.\n\nPacino finished the scene, then retreated to his trailer. Meanwhile, his double stripped down to a bathing suit and stood in the shower. There was barely enough room in the 5-by-9-foot bathroom to set up the tripod and camera.\n\nAfter 45 minutes, Pacino was back but now had to use the bathroom for real, and that meant someplace other than center stage.\n\nThe magic of cinema had seized me. I sprung into action, ringing a neighbor's doorbell. A good-hearted senior citizen named Helen answered and appeared stunned. \"Where is he?\" she asked. \"I'm a-comin' Helen,\" yelled a voice next door. The site of Al Pacino running in slippers and a green bathrobe brought an instant smile to Helen's face. \"I'msooo sorry we have to meet under such unusual circumstances,\" he said.\n\nWhen he returned, Pacino got into the shower, looking trim in his brown bathing trunks. My mother and sister had already warned the crew: If they mistakenly flushed the toilet while the star was in the shower, \"Serpico might get scalded.\" We were all doing our part for Hollywood.\n\nThe scene was done in one take. Pacino slurped Chivas in the shower. You could feel his whole character, dark and moody, going down the drain. He seemed to know exactly how many tiles were in the camera viewfinder and he worked from one edge of the scene to the other.\n\n\"Too much?\" somebody asked the director.\n\n\"That was great,\" said Algrant, who directed the 1994 comedy \"Naked in New York.\"\n\nPacino walked out of the bathroom with towels wrapped around his hair. He changed in my mother's bedroom.\n\n\"It's people like you that make it nice to work,\" he said when he emerged. Pacino, who was raised in the South Bronx, wished mom, whose birthday was around the corner, a happy 80th birthday.\n\n\"You've got to make it to 100,\" he told her.\n\nThen he put his arm around mom, called for my sister, and put his arm around her as well. This was our real payoff.\n\n\"Let's make a family picture,\" he said, still in character but smiling broadly for the first time all day.\n\n(thanks Anne for this info)\n\nDir: Daniel Algrant. USA. 2001. 100mins.\n\nAnyone who wants to see Al Pacino in his one of his most impressive roles since Scent Of A Woman is going to have to get on a plane to Rome, at least for the time being. A combination of commercial bad timing and self-regulatory censorship has meant that Miramax still has no US release scheduled for this tight, dark, compelling political drama, over a year after it was wrapped and ready. People I Know has emerged in Italy, however, where it took $682,000 from 274 screens in its first weekend for a screen average of $2,489. Sophisticated urban markets in Europe and elsewhere look to be its best hope, at least until the US comes out of its don't-rock-the-boat coma. The whiff of censorship could even turn into a box-office boost if distributors take the bull by the horns and sell this as the film that is too hot for America to handle, a strategy which CDI in Italy has so far failed to capitalise on.\n\nDaniel Algrant (Sex And The City) examines the New York of corrupt political cabals, and is openly critical of an unnamed, right-wing mayor who, Pacino's character complains, is one of those responsible for turning the town into a \"police state\" in which \"a lot of people... have come to fear us and hate us\".\n\nOne can see, as with The Quiet American and Buffalo Soldiers, Miramax's dilemma: in the present climate of grin-and-bear-it solidarity, the film's bad-ass attitude to US politics means that it is going to be a difficult prospect on home ground, even more than a year after September 11. In less troubled times, Al Pacino's performance as a tired, jaded, pill-popping New York publicist and theatrical agent struggling to hold onto the only thing that reminds him he is human - his militant past as a civil liberties campaigner - would be on the fast track to an Oscar awards campaign.\n\nThe action takes place over 24 hours in a New York that has a nicely dark, grainy, 1970s feel to it - a feel reinforced by the cool urban jazz soundtrack. The audience first see Ely Wurman - who hails from Georgia - at the Broadway opening of a play he's representing: a no-hoper, like many of his recent briefs. Soon he's drafted in to mop up a mess left behind by Carry Launer (O'Neal), the only celebrity actor who has stayed faithful to him. Carry sends Ely to bail out a dazed and confused supermodel girlfriend (Leoni), who drags the publicist off to an exclusive Wall Street opium party, where he is surprised to recognise some really heavyweight movers and shakers.\n\nThings spiral, as they say: Ely slips into a twilight zone of growing menace, compounded by lack of sleep and a cocktail of prescription drugs. The only still point in his physical and moral loss of control is represented by Victoria (Basinger), his dead brother's wife, who has come up from Georgia to get Ely out of the New York jungle and tempt him back to the old country. Unfortunately, she's too late.\n\nThe dialogue is sharp, edgy, and occasionally hilarious (Ely, looking around the supermodel's hotel boudoir: \"This is not a room - it's a vagina\"). Pacino's magnetic performance as a good guy in a bad world who is too tired even to emote is given strong support by Leoni, O'Neal, Basinger and Richard Schiff (from the West Wing) as a Machiavellian New York Jewish leader. Just occasionally, the insider's view is taken so far that certain offhand references, or the faces of certain NY society figures playing themselves, are lost on those of us from outside the Big Apple. But this minor distraction is also one of the things that gives the film its air of authority. Pacino fans, and all those who care about cinema, should chase this one around the world.\n\n(thanks Vladka for this info)\n\nA Miramax Films (in U.S.)/Medusa Film-CDI (in Italy) release of a Myriad Pictures presentation of a South Fork Pictures production, in association with Galena/GreeneStreet Films, Chal Prods., InMotion, WMF V.

Reviewed at Metropolitan Cinema, Rome, Oct. 4,2002. MPAA Rating: R. Running time: 100 MIN.\n\nWhile Rudy Giuliani's name is never pronounced, the references to the former mayor-turned-national hero's tenure as top man of NYC are clear in \"People I Know,\" whose bitingly critical view of the period might explain why Miramax's still-pending U.S. release has been continually pushed back. But this compelling 24-hour odyssey into the life of a world-- weary Gotham publicist, driven by a vivid performance from Al Pacino, deserves some theatrical exposure (although pic has already popped up on airlines). Despite sensitivity over its portrayal of the rotten underbelly of celebrity, politics and the power elite, sophisticated urban audiences both in the U.S. and abroad should tap into the textured drama's incisive script and fascinating characters, fueling arthouse mileage.\n\nShot in early 2001 and just completing post when the events of Sept. 11 changed the rules overnight regarding screen depictions of New York, this brooding character study-cum-- thriller couldn't have come along at a more inopportune time. The much discussed shot in which Pacino's drug-and-booze-addled character, in a post-binge haze, sees the World Trade towers lying on their sides has been removed. But even with that strategic cut, the film's cynicism could hardly play more abrasively against the mood of renewal and rehabilitation in wounded Gotham.\n\nA not-so-distant relative of Sydney Falco in \"Sweet Smell of Success,\" Eli Wurman (Pacino) is Georgia Jew whose youthful involvement in the civil rights movement, along with his morality, has been put aside to serve a now-depleted client list. Moth-eaten and almost washed up, he's angling to redeem himself by organizing a benefit for imprisoned Nigerian immigrants without green cards.\n\nEli is distracted, however, when Cary Launer (Ryan O'Neal), one of his few remaining movie star clients, calls for crisis management. Launer's affair with druggy TV starlet/model Jilli Hopper (Tea Leoni) causes problems when the girl lands in jail. Launer asks Eli to bail her out and put her on a plane before the scandal can damage his chances in the upcoming senatorial race.\n\nBut Jilli drags Eli downtown to a luxury Wall Street opium den and sex club. Before being thrown out, Jilli reveals she has a recording gadget with downloadable images of the club's high-profile clientele including Jewish civic leader Elliot Sharansky (Richard Schiff). Back in Jil's hotel room, Eli is onthe verge of passing out when an intruder overpowers the girl and sticks her with a fatal overdose.\n\nUnsure of what he witnessed, Eli avoids police to focus on the benefit. Led by the Rev. Lyle Blunt (Bill Nunn), the black community is up in arms about the mayor's persecution of underprivileged minorities and incensed over the lack of support from the city's well-heeled Jews.\n\nEli corners both Blunt and Sharansky and gets them to speak at the benefit. Strong-arming Launer into attending, Eli dangles the star as a carrot to entice the two reluctant adversaries.\n\nSleep-deprived, ailing and becoming visibly unhinged, Eli underestimates the danger from his knowledge of Jilli's murder and possession of the incriminating recording device. His vulnerability is further heightened by the presence in town of his widowed sister-in-law, Victoria (Kim Basinger), for whom his feelings clearly run deeper than friendship.\n\nAdopting a colorful Southern accent and looking distinctly haggard, Pacino conveys a cogent sense of Eli's drained state. Also palpable is the self-loathing over the direction his life has taken, squandering his Harvard law background to be a celebrity lapdog. Ranking alongside \"The Insider\" as Pacino's best, most controlled work in some time, it's a pained, exposed performance that rivets attention even as playwright Jon Robin Baitz's script veers at times into murky ambiguity.\n\nThe drama's kinship with '70s anti-- establishment thrillers is underlined by a poster on Eli's office wall for \"The Parallax View.\" But the information on manipulation of the Senate campaign by Sharansky and his cronies is too sketchy. Likewise the pic's ending, which cleverly aligns Eli's downfall with his media triumph and represents an audaciously downbeat conclusion rather than a Hollywood-style copout, but underdefines certain key climactic events.\n\nGenerally, however, the screenplay is taut and intelligent, sizzling with enough sharp dialogue and dark humor to coast over its flaws. In addition to the unseen mayor, clear parallels between fictional characters and their real-life counterparts add to the caustic edge. Womanizing, politically ambitious Cary Launer appears inspired by Warren Beatty, while Rev. Blunt owes much to Al Sharpton. Eli himself is believed to be modeled after legendary press agent Bobby Zarem, who has publicly denied the similarities.\n\nDirector Dan Algrant (\"Naked in New York\") keeps a propulsive grip on the action, communicating a dizzying sense of Eli's determination while working on diminishing reserves of strength and lucidity and trying to sidestep entanglement in politics.\n\nCast is uniformly terrific. In a small but significant role, Basinger radiates tenderness, intelligence and hope; Leoni shapes a raw but nuanced character out of the jaded party girl; and Schiff brings chilly authority to Sharansky, amusingly playing off Nunn's performance of empowered umbrage as the reverend. O'Neal combines professional public-profile charm with self-centered focus and Mark Webber registers sympathetically as Eli's put-upon assistant.\n\nPeter Deming's gritty lensing puts an appropriately seedy gloss on the Manhattan settings, while Terence Blanchard's cool, jazz-tinged score quietly fuels the suspense.\n\nCopyright © 2003 Nando Media, Copyright © 2003 Christian Science Monitor Service, By DAVID STERRITT, Christian Science Monitor (April 24, 2:30 p.m. ADT) - Al Pacino hasn't been on a roll lately.\n\nHe's a good actor, and when a solid opportunity like last year's moody thriller \"Insomnia\" comes along, he rises nicely to the occasion.\n\nBut for the past few seasons he's been mostly stuck in junk such as \"Simone\" and \"The Recruit,\" squandering the artistic capital he earned with \"The Insider\" and \"Any Given Sunday\" in the late 1990s. His starmaking performances in the \"Godfather\" movies seem like products of a vanished era.\n\nAll of which is relevant to Pacino's latest film. His performance in \"People I Know\" is the best thing he's done in ages, and while the main reason is his still-robust acting talent, his career history also contributes to the strength of his characterization here.\n\nLike the strung-out publicity man he plays, Pacino has been on the entertainment scene a very long while, and at times - including recent times - he's looked like an incipient has-been. But he's not ready to roll over yet, and when the time does arrive for his final exit, you know he'll try to make it with a satisfying bang.\n\nThe story woven around Pacino's new character, public-relations man Eli Wurman, is more mysterious than you might expect.\n\nAt first it seems to be a show-business morality tale, with the protagonist trying to revitalize his career by organizing a fundraiser for a worthy cause. This necessitates courting a high-profile movie star by helping him out of a romantic dilemma that could cripple his political ambitions.\n\nThe stakes grow drastically higher when a dreadful crime transpires almost under Eli's nose, unveiling a network of sinister activities. The rest of the movie revolves around his efforts to pull off his great project in the midst of enigmatic forces.\n\nImagine mixing \"The Sweet Smell of Success\" with \"Eyes Wide Shut,\" plus a dash of the recent \"ivans xtc\" for extra spice, and you'll have an idea of what this offbeat fable is like. Pacino is the dynamo that drives it, giving a relentlessly imaginative performance that draws on all the professional expertise and personal experience he's gathered in a lifetime of screen and stage work.\n\nMore surprising yet is the supporting cast. It's headed by Ryan O'Neal, who's having even more of a comeback than Pacino this year, via his fine work here and in \"Malibu's Most Wanted,\" where he also plays a rich guy with political stars in his eyes. Right behind him are Kim Basinger as Eli's confidante, Robert Klein as his befuddled physician, and Bill Nunn as an African-American leader who's no more idealistic than the other egomaniacs in the plot.\n\nAt some moments, \"People I Know\" becomes as murky as the conspiracy it portrays, and it's too willfully peculiar for its box-office prospects to be very strong.\n\nIt's a refreshing change from the business-as-usual that's dominating most of this season's fare, though, and Pacino's performance alone makes it a must-see for admirers of creative film acting.\n\nRated R; contains violence, sex and drugs.\n\n(thanks Andy B. for this info)\n\nChristine Loss/20th Century Fox, HELLO. GET ME HELP. Colin Farrell, in \"Phone Booth,\" plays a publicist who has a vengeful enemy. By ADAM STERNBERGH\n\nIn the 1998 film \"Sliding Doors,\" Gwyneth Paltrow's character leads two alternate lives. In one, she's a frumpy pushover with mousy hair and a cheating boyfriend. In the other, she wears fabulous outfits, sports a platinum hairdo and is pursued by a charming\n\nScotsman. In one, she toils at a greasy spoon. In the other, she whips up a fabulous party to open a friend's chic restaurant. In one, she's a waitress. In the other, she's a publicist.\n\nNow compare this portrayal of the publicist's life to the one now playing in theaters. In \"People I Know,\" Al Pacino stars as Eli Wurman, a harried and haggard career flack. His existence is not one of sly banter and glamorous clothes. Rather, Wurman is a\n\nprofessional bootlicker, a sad and regretful man whose own potential (he graduated from Harvard Law) has been frittered away on a life spent cleaning up the messes left by other, more important people. He's like Willy Loman with a pill addiction and a Rolodex.\n\nWurman is better off, however, than Stu Shepard, the publicist played by Colin Farrell who is at the center of \"Phone Booth,\" another recent film. Shepard is a small-time press agent who finds himself pinned down in a phone booth by a vengeful sniper.\n\nWhat are Shepard's crimes? Well, he plays two magazines off each other to win a cover story for a C-list client. He tells another client that he has booked a party in what he claims is the hottest restaurant in Manhattan but which is not, in fact, the hottest restaurant in Manhattan. For this, he is targeted for assassination.\n\nHow did publicists become Hollywood's villains of choice  tragic characters at best, and sleazy liars at worst? (In \"Phone Booth,\" the sniper's other targets are a pornographer and a corrupt corporate executive.) To be sure, pop culture has often taken a dim view of the publicist's trade, from Paul Shaffer's pathetic flunkie in \"This Is Spinal Tap,\" in which he literally bends over and begs his clients to kick his behind, to that of the 1957 gold standard of flack-bashing, \"Sweet Smell of Success.\" In that film, Tony Curtis plays Sidney Falco as an amoral snake who slithers through the canyons of Manhattan, running errands for Burt Lancaster's imperious gossip columnist, J. J. Hunsecker.\n\nBut if anything, the prospects for celebrity publicists should now be on the rise; after all, Hunsecker and Falco have all but reversed roles. Today's \"image managers\" wield unprecedented power, while it is the gossip-gobbling journalists who scramble for scraps. Hollywood publicists like Pat Kingsley of PMK/HBH, the industry's most influential firm, don't have to curry favor with journalists.\n\nInstead, they guard their star clients like bouncers at the entrance to the world's most exclusive nightclub.\n\nFor a brief moment not long ago, pop culture celebrated this new breed of publicist, heralding them as the very model of urbane glamour. In addition to \"Sliding Doors,\" television shows such as \"Absolutely Fabulous\" and \"Sex and the City\" portrayed public relations executives as vain but endearing glamour girls who whirled through a city's night life one air-kiss at a time.\n\nNow it is the publicity industry that could use, well, a good publicist. On screen, press agents are ducking bullets when they're not dodging petulant clients. Meanwhile, the trade's most visible real-life practitioners have been Lizzie Grubman, who backed her\n\ncar into a crowd in 2001, and Muhammad Said al-Sahhaf, who was Iraq's minister of information, who amused the world with his delusional dispatches on the imminent defeat of the coalition forces.\n\n\"The culture now depends so heavily on spin, puffery and the exultation of personalities,\" said Jon Robin Baitz, the screenwriter of \"People I Know.\" \"These guys are the disseminators, dealing in a strange currency. They don't just promote a star. They're\n\necclesiastical figures for the whole infotainment culture.\"\n\nNot surprisingly, publicists don't see themselves in the same terms. \"I don't know why people have a negative connotation about us,\" said Heidi Schaeffer, an account executive at PMK/HBH. \"We serve a purpose, and we're not bad people.\"\n\nPublicists can be forgiven for wondering why the mood has suddenly turned ugly. In \"Phone Booth,\" for example, Shepard tearfully renounces his profession, screaming, \"I lie to the media, who sell my lies to more and more people!\" When he spots his eager intern\n\nin the crowd, he pleads: \"Don't be a publicist! You're too good for it!\"\n\nPublicists are doing what they've done since the days of Sidney Falco: managing information to protect their clients. The difference now is that everyone's paying close attention to their work.\n\n\"There's a very high premium placed by the public on the idea of `knowing,' \" said Neal Gabler, the author of a Walter Winchell biography. \"We want to know how everything operates and we don't want to feel like we're being fooled. There's always been a disparaging attitude toward publicists; they've been seen as shills, hucksters or ballyhoo artists. But this large universe of people who once worked behind the scenes are now in front of the scenes.\"\n\nAt first, this attention made publicists into new-style stars. In the 1990's, hype outpaced worthiness: every ingénue was a superstar, every mannequin a supermodel, every I.P.O. the next Amazon. As architects of the buzz glut, publicists were naturally fascinating. They seemed like the ultimate string-pullers, generating notice for others while winning it for themselves.\n\nThe fascination with them reached a peak with a 1998 New York magazine cover story, in which a clique of publicists in their mid-20's, including Lara Shriftman, Liz Cohen and Ms. Grubman were dubbed the \"Power Girls.\" Sure, they came across as a tad\n\nrepellent, but those connections! Those parties! Those shoes! The article portrayed them as somewhere between Bridget Jones and Samantha Jones, the vampy public relations queen on \"Sex and the City.\"'\n\nThe new century brought an economic hangover, however, and, consequently, a ballyhoo backlash. Who better to blame than the ballyhoo artists? \"The feeling is that publicists have gone too far,\" said Michelangelo Signorile, a cultural critic who started his career\n\nplanting gossip items for a public relations firm, Michael Hall Associates. \"Now publicists are seen as dangerous, as a threat. But they're not really doing anything more than what they're hired to do.\"\n\nYet, like Pacino's character in \"People I Know,\" the public has become disenchanted with the publicist's wizardry. Having clamored for a peek behind the curtain, it is now recoiling at the sight of that exposed machinery. And publicists have been caught red-handed with their hands on the levers. So we have a film like \"Phone Booth,\" in which we're shooting the messenger, literally.\n\nMost publicists say they never wanted the attention. They would be happy to quietly return to their business. \"I don't think everybody needs to know how things happen,\" Ms. Schaeffer said. \"Let there be a little magic left. Why do we have to explain how everything gets from A to Z?\" When asked if she would like to see more positive portrayals of publicists in pop culture, she said, \"I don't want to see any portrayals.\"\n\nPublicists, the \"power girls\" notwithstanding, have never been fans of scrutiny. They prefer to work just outside the spotlight. This is because they've always understood what the rest of us temporarily forgot: that their business is inherently unglamorous and, yes, occasionally ugly. It just looked pretty for a moment.\n\nAppeared on the Rosie O'Donnell Show in April:\n\nROSIE: Now how were you able to do this (referring to I Am Sam, the movie he was there to promote) while still doing the West Wing? Because, doesn't your schedule go all year round?\n\nRS: It was actually interesting, it was part of the problem, figuring out what to do because there were two movies that I was asked to do at the same time. One was this one and the other was with um... I just saw myself [in the monitor] and now I don't want to talk anymore... (Rosie laughs) and the other one was a movie called People I Know with Al Pacino. And so at one point I was asked to make kind of a \"Sophie's Choice\", to pick... and I was very lucky because the directors and writers of the two movies were best friends with Aaron Sorkin and Tommy Schlommy who run the West Wing. So they all did favors... no one cared about me... they all did favors for each other...\n\nROSIE: Right, and they Let you out.\n\nRS: And they let me out and I was able to kind of fulfill a dream... my day job was The West Wing and then I got to work with these amazing people (referring to the cast of \"I Am Sam\" sitting next to him) and with Al Pacino who is the reason I got interested [in acting] in the first place.\n\nROSIE: No kidding. What was the role you saw him in that made you want to be an actor? Do you remember what it was?\n\nRS: Oh, just pick it, but probably Dog Day Afternoon. Panic in Needle Park you know was shot in my neighborhood on the west side.\n\nROSIE: Right.\n\nRS: You remember that was his first movie. You probably remember that, right?\n\nROSIE: Yea\n\nRS: He played a drug addict back when the west side was a bad neighborhood and that's where I lived. It wasn't a bad neighborhood but it was all mixed up and stuff.\n\nROSIE: Right, right.\n\nRS: And I saw neighborhood kids in the windows of shots cuz they would shoot up in buildings and I'd see Maria... like you know...\n\nROSIE: Like your friend...\n\nRS: my friend...\n\nROSIE: from 4th grade up there...\n\nRS: There was one scene where they were playing stickball in the street and they shot up to some kid looking and it was a kid I went to school with. But I was aware of him [Al] from the very beginning of his movie career.\""
