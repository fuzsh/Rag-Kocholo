        "text": "The inmates are taking over the asylum, and that's probably good news.\n\nThe biggest trend detectable at this year's Toronto Film Festival was that a number of movie actors, including Oscar winners Tom Hanks, Kevin Spacey, Anjelica Huston and Al Pacino, were making their debuts as directors of feature films.\n\nOther prominent actors who came to Toronto to present movies they had directed included Steve Buscemi, Matthew Broderick, Emilio Estevez, Kevin Bacon, Armin Mueller-Stahl and Cher.\n\n\"I'm admittedly a control freak,\" said Anjelica Huston in explaining why, after acting in more than two dozen feature films, she had taken on her first directing assignment -- the screen adaptation of a harrowing novel about an abused child, \"Bastard Out of Carolina.\"\n\nThe movie, originally commissioned for Turner television and then rejected by Ted Turner himself, presumably because of the Southern Gothic grimness of some of its scenes, is scheduled to be shown this fall on the Showtime cable network.\n\n\"I spent a good deal of time at my father's feet,\" said the daughter of the great actor-writer-director John Huston. \"And I was always fascinated by aspects of the filmmaking process other than acting. I could very easily have become, say, a costume designer.\"\n\n\"So much of acting is spent pondering our existence in the back of a trailer,\" she said. \"And it is very relaxing not to be the physical object of attention.\"\n\nMs. Huston does not appear in \"Bastard Out of Carolina.\" Nor does Mr. Spacey appear in his directorial debut, \"Albino Alligator,\" a robbery-gone-wrong psychological thriller starring Matt Dillon and Faye Dunaway. Mr. Pacino, on the other hand, is a principal focus of \"Looking for Richard,\" about the actor's struggles to come to grips with Shakespeare's \"Richard III.\"\n\nMr. Buscemi, who plays gunmen in this year's \"Fargo\" and \"Kansas City,\" used the same word as Ms. Huston and several other actor-directors -- \"control\" -- in explaining why he had finally decided to direct as well as star in \"Trees Lounge.\" It's the story of a determined loser who spends way too much time in a Long Island neighborhood saloon. Mr. Buscemi's script is, in part, painfully autobiographical, he said, so he had a personal stake in seeing it done right.\n\n\"I wanted to work with the actors I wanted to work with,\" said Mr. Buscemi, whose previous experience had included playing an independent movie director in the hilarious low-budget farce \"Living in Oblivion.\"\n\n\"I wanted the movie to be character driven, and I wanted to keep the ending intact,\" he said, noting that he would have had an easier time getting \"Trees Lounge\" made if he had been willing to write a happy ending, cast \"bankable\" stars and give it to an established director.\n\nMr. Hanks said he had begun writing the script for \"That Thing You Do,\" about a flash-in-the-pan rock group of the early '60s, while he was in South Carolina filming \"Forrest Gump.\" After \"Forrest Gump\" became an enormous hit and Mr. Hanks was propelled to a frantic new level of stardom, he retreated into the script \"to get back to reality.\"\n\nHe said he had always figured he would direct the movie, once he got the script right.\n\nMr. Mueller-Stahl, a German-born actor, appears as a stern Holocaust survivor in a brilliant Australian movie called \"Shine,\" a festival favorite. He also showed a low-budget movie he wrote, directed and stars in. It is called \"Conversations With the Beast,\" and is a darkly comic look at an ancient, enfeebled man who may be Adolf Hitler.\n\n\"I keep trying to kill Hitler,\" remarked Mr. Mueller-Stahl, who first became known in America for his role in \"The Music Box\" as a man accused of having been a Nazi war criminal. \"I haven't succeeded yet.\"\n\nMr. Broderick, a Broadway star who was Jim Carrey's foil in \"The Cable Guy,\" commented, \"When I'm acting in a movie, I spend most of my time in my trailer. I started wondering, 'What are they doing out there while I'm in here?' \"\n\nMr. Broderick directed and stars in \"Infinity,\" about the intense and tragic first marriage of atom-bomb physicist Richard Feynman. The script was written by Mr. Broderick's mother. Several other movies featured family members working together, presumably increasing tribal control of the final film.\n\nFor example, Emilio Estevez directed his father, Martin Sheen, in \"The War at Home,\" a post-Vietnam drama. Mr. Estevez got studio backing for the serious film by agreeing to appear in the upcoming farce \"Mighty Ducks 3.\"\n\nAnd actress Gena Rowlands, the widow of legendary independent director John Cassavetes, appears in \"Unhook the Stars,\" directed by her son, Nick Cassevetes. It is, in a sense, the coming of age story of a woman in her 60s. Marisa Tomei co-stars.\n\nThere was even something close to a family connection in the big-budget medical thriller \"Extreme Measures.\" It stars Hugh Grant and was produced by his longtime romantic companion, actress-model Elizabeth Hurley.\n\n\"She bosses me around at home,\" remarked Mr. Grant, \"so it was pretty easy to accept her doing it at work.\"\n\nSince top actors make more money than most other film professionals -- and have considerable clout in getting a project \"greenlighted\" -- it makes sense that they would move into producing (financial control) as well as directing (artistic control). For example, actress Helen Mirren, a recent Emmy winner for the British police series \"Prime Suspect,\" was a producer as well as one of the stars of the downbeat drama \"Some Mother's Son,\" about a hunger strike among imprisoned members of the Irish Republican Army.\n\nIn general, actors moving into producing and directing seems like good news for moviegoers, particularly the considerable audience that is looking for something beyond commercial Hollywood product.\n\nActress Demi Moore swept through the Toronto festival with a vast entourage to promote a movie she had produced called \"If These Walls Could Talk,\" about the effects of abortion on three generations of women. One episode was directed by Cher, who also appeared at the festival.\n\nMs. Moore said she had spent years trying to get an abortion film made in Hollywood, and finally took the project to HBO, which will show \"If These Walls Could Talk\" later this year. Asked why she had turned to producing, Ms. Moore said, \"It's simple. I don't like feeling dependent on anyone. And I felt like a lot of problems weren't being addressed. As just an actress, you have to wait to see what comes to you. My nature isn't to sit back.\"\n\nConsidering recent efforts like \"The Scarlet Letter\" and \"Striptease,\" it's hard to think of Demi Moore as the solution rather than the problem, but it is certainly true that cable channels like HBO and Showtime have become one important outlet for independent films that are too tough and personal for Hollywood."
