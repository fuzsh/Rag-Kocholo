        "text": "While some people will try and convince you that ranking the best Al Pacino movies of all time is entirely subjective, we’re here to tell you they’re wrong.\n\nFor one, we know what movies shouldn’t be included: like Gigli (2003), Jack and Jill (2011), American Traitor (2021), Martin Scorsese‘s laborious misfire that was The Irishman (2020), and certainly not Ridley Scott‘s House of Gucci (2021). To this day, I still maintain the latter was the worst film of its year.\n\nFor another, given how prolific Pacino’s career has been across over half a century, there’s something of a general consensus that most moviegoers can agree upon.\n\nRanked: The Best Al Pacino Movies Of All Time\n\nScent of a Woman finds a place at #10 not just because of Al Pacino’s Academy Award-winning performance, but because it’s one of the few film performances where he ventures outside of his usual wheelhouse (crime, action, straight-up villainy, etc).\n\nHis pained monologue about being “in the dark” will go down in history as one of the most memorable ever committed to celluloid. An immortal expression.\n\nIn short, a brilliant show of versatility.\n\nI anticipate that this may raise some eyebrows, especially in comparison to some other entries on this list.\n\nBut the on-screen chemistry between Al Pacino and Keanu Reeves — the latter of whom reportedly sacrificed over US$1 million of his salary so the production could afford to secure the former — was the stuff of cinema magic. Not to mention: virtually every line of dialogue uttered by Pacino is a thing of immense pleasure.\n\nPlus he’s playing the literal devil. What more could you want?\n\nDespite the assertions of many, this was Al Pacino at his rawest. Not The Godfather. Not Serpico. Not even Scarface.\n\nThere was something about the way he captured the desperation of real-life bank robber John Wojtowicz (“Sonny Wortzik” in the film) that sets Dog Day Afternoon apart from the rest of his filmography.\n\nThis also marked the third time Pacino collaborated with The Godfather co-star John Cazale (AKA Fredo Corleone).\n\nOne of Christopher Nolan‘s most underrated films, Insomnia is a taut psychological thriller that highlighted both Al Pacino and the late Robin Williams‘ capacity for claustrophobically introspective acting.\n\nIt’s a crying shame these two never shared the screen more.\n\nNo serious list of the best Al Pacino movies would be complete without a nod to Serpico. Nor could anyone else have pulled this role off.\n\nBloody, over-the-top, extremely quotable, but above all else: iconic.\n\nSome roles seem to overshadow others. And regardless of how you might personally feel about Scarface, there’s no denying it was one of Al Pacino’s greatest career moments.\n\nThis one was for the culture.\n\nI’ve never understood why blokes who work in sales gravitate towards Scarface when Glengarry Glen Ross is a profoundly more relevant shout.\n\nI guess it’s easier to keep a salesman’s attention with fantasies of cocaine, guns, and Michelle Pfeiffer than it is with — oh I don’t know — people actually trying to survive the bleak and despairing world of sales?\n\nIn any case, this star-studded production — which included Alec Baldwin, Jack Lemmon, and, uh… *cough* Kevin Spacey *cough* — isn’t just essential Al Pacino viewing. It’s essential cinema viewing. And a masterful adaptation of David Mamet’s Pulitzer Prize-winning play of the same name.\n\nThey just don’t make ’em like they used to.\n\nZero explanation required. It’s one of the greatest actors of all time breaking out in one of the greatest films of all time. Cinema redefined.\n\nAlthough, an explanation might be required as to why The Godfather is: a) #3 on a best Al Pacino movies list and not #1; and b) why the first Godfather ranks below Part II. (We’ve provided the latter further down in this article.)\n\nSide note: imagine making The Godfather with just two feature-length performances under your belt. Legendary stuff.\n\nAl Pacino as Lt. Vincent Hanna in Michael Mann‘s Heat is the archetypal Al Pacino character. It’s a role that perfectly encapsulates the broader strokes of his career success.\n\nEveryone seems to have this idea that it’s because he plays bad guys with a redeeming sliver of good in them when it’s actually the reverse: a good guy with an unshakeable, almost overwhelming, element of darkness they’re constantly grappling with. That’s where Pacino shines. Heat is definitive proof.\n\nHis characters understand the so-called line; understands his existence is one side of the same coin; and fully acknowledges this while championing consequentialism (ends-justify-the-means/morality-is-relative).\n\nApply it to any of his characters and you’ll start to see the arcs more clearly. Perhaps even appreciate the movies themselves a little more.\n\nTo be sure, the first Godfather was a monumental achievement in cinematic history which many have since attempted to recreate (though none have realistically ever come close).\n\nThe inaugural adaptation of Mario Puzo’s novel put Al Pacino on the map, and is an undeniably phenomenal performance. But The Godfather, Part II is where the actor had the opportunity to really add nuance to that subdued darkness I’ve been yammering on about.\n\nIt’s not the dipping of a toe from conventional morality that audiences find fascinating. It’s this: the violent descent. The immolation of one’s soul. The portrayal of irretrievable loss. Witnessing just how far a man may fall from grace, all for the supposed benefit of his family.\n\nThe transformation of Al Pacino’s Michael Corleone is one that’s poetic. One that’s on par with the Greek tragedies of yore. Hence why The Godfather, Part II will forever hold the crown.\n\nAnd nothing you say could ever convince me otherwise.\n\nHonourable Mentions\n\nAny Given Sunday (1999)\n\nDirected by: Oliver Stone\n\nActors: Al Pacino, Cameron Diaz, Dennis Quaid, James Woods, Jamie Foxx, LL Cool J, Ann-Margret, Lauren Holly, Lawrence Taylor, Jim Brown, Aaron Eckhart, Bill Bellamy, Matthew Modine, John C.
