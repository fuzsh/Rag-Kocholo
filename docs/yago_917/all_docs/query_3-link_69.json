        "text": "Two years ago, having lunch in the garden of Greenwich Village restaurant, AI Pacino noticed troupe of actors seated nearby at a long table covered with a checkered tablecloth. The picture — softhued, idyllic, with the sun and shadows dappling the actors — made a vivid impression on him. It was like a Renoir,” he remembers. “Looking at them, you could tell that actors have existed for hundreds and hundreds of years. Now, as then, they are the ‘chronicles of the time.’ They have their own world. There is something ancient and familial about actors, heightened by the fact that they travel.”\n\nPacino, the urban, contemporary Method actor, feels connected, almost umbilically, to classic theater traditions: They give him sustenance. When he talks about actors and acting—his favorite subjects — he often refers to Eleanora Duse and Edmund Kean. When he quotes a critic, it is usually William Hazlitt. In many ways he is a throwback — a modern prince of players.\n\nIn contrast to such actors as George C. Scott, who thinks of his art as a form of prostitution, Pacino honors acting as a noble profession. “What can you say,” he asks, “about a profession where you can be anybody and do anything?”\n\nPacino has been a coolly vengeful Mafioso (“The Godfather”), a stubborn, honest cop (“Serpico”), an insanely incompetent homosexual hank robber (“Dog Day Afternoon”) and an aloof racing‐car driver (“Bobby Deerfield,” his next movie, which will L??leased in the fall). On stage he has ranged from a vicious street tough in “The Indian Wants the Bronx” to “Richard III” (which he did in Boston), approaching that character less as a monster than as a manipulative role‐player — an actor. Currently on Broadway in the title role in David Rabe's explosive antiwar play, “The Basic Training of Pavlo Hummel,” he is a zealous blockhead of a soldier who enthusiastically enlists, tries his limited best to become a “Good Soldier” Hummel, and for his efforts is killed in Vietnam. For his performance in “Pavlo Hummel,” he was nominated for a Tony Award as Best Actor; the Tony winners will be announced tonight.\n\nAt 37, Pacino has become a “bankable” superstar, whose commitment to a project means that a film will be made and will be guaranteed a certain success. At the same time he is an example of another rare breed — the serious stage actor. Unlike many his peers, Pacino has never stopped working on stage. For him, movie stardom is something of an accident — he is, by his own estimation, a character actor who plays leading roles.\n\nArtistically, Pacino is Marlon Brando's godson. “We are all indebted to him,” says Pacino. “There has been an American style of acting since Brando.”\n\nAlready a “bankable” movie superstar, he gives promise of becoming a modern prince of players on stage.\n\nFrom Brando onward, the Method was the Message (the message‐bearer, Lee Strasberg): emotions even before words. The impact on actors was cataclysmic. The commoner could be king. Dustin Hoffman, Robert De Niro, Jack Nicholson and Pacino are actors with whom the audience can identify rather than look up to. In apparent contradiction, they are also fantasy figures, romantic icons, for a new generation of moviegoers.\n\nPacino's characters — even supposed winners like Bobby Deerfield — are misfits, people out of the mainstream, besieged by and battling society's expectations of conformity. The essential Pacino character is a loner — isolated on an emotional atoll, but with a burning intensity. Within this framework, Pacino's range is extraordinary. The characters are, by turns, extroverted and withdrawn, articulate and barely literate, assertive and acquiescent. Compar ing his first and his most recent creations, Murph “The Indian” and Pavlo Hummel, he says, “Those two guys would never get together.” Asked if he could imagine any of his characters meeting or communicating, he thinks for a minute and says, “I don't think so — except for the one from ‘Scarecrow’ [an amiable derelict]. He could get along with anybody. The rest — I don't see it.” Would he want to introduce Michael Corleone to Frank Serpico? He laughs at the notion and jokes, “I'm going to have a party this week, invite them all, and see if it works out.”\n\n“What can you say,” Pacino asks, “about a profession where you can be anybody and do anything?”\n\nWith Pacino as with all great actors (such as Brand° and Olivier), we never lose sight of the actor within the character. As Pacino says, “There should be a stamp on an artist's work. People went to see Junius Booth enact Richard III just as they went to see Toscanini or Caruso. Too often an actor is put in the position of doing a part he can't really speak through. I have to connect with the material.”\n\nExplaining his reasons for doing “Pavlo,” he says that it was not primarily because of his feelings about Vietnam ; he thinks it is a great play and a challenging character, and he wanted to introduce both the play and David Wheeler'‘. Theater Company of Boston (with which he had acted “Pavlo” in 1972) to a Broadway audience.\n\nActed badly, the weak, cipher‐like Schweiks, Wozzecks and Pavlos in dramatic literature can seem boring — exercises in futility, shadow figures. Pacino plays Pavlo incandescently. He takes a battle statistic and humanizes him by showing us all aspects of the man — his eagerness, gullibility, weaknesses, especially his vulnerability. His Pavlo is pathetic —a man who courts his own victimization and he is also a grand clown. The actor thinks of the character as a “conglomeration” of, among others, Charles Chaplin and Harpo Marx.\n\n“This is not a loser,” he says, answering the charge of some critics. “He has an incredible will to live. He has courage. I'm very positive about him. He's a character I'd like to be around. Hummel keeps them laughing.” He says that he has felt the character growing and changing since the April 24 opening on Broadway. “He's become more unusual, weirder, and that acts as a counterbalance to the realism of the play around him. I'm exposing his hurt, his deprivation. He's a man with so much against him. The deck is stacked, and he continues on. There's a little bit of him in all of us — in\n\nAsked to describe the Pavlo side of his nature, he declines: He wouldn't or couldn't. But clearly there is something in\n\nPacino that attracts him to playing what he calls “rebellious outsiders, antiberoes.”\n\nPacino is short, about 5 foot 7, but powerfully built. Sitting down, he looks bigger — with broad shoulders, a long face, thick black hair and piercing eyes that seem to be constantly watching and absorbing. Frequently he swivels his head, as if exercising the muscles in his neck. There is a determination in his walk — as if he were an athlete or a street fighter. (On stage his movements can seem balletic.) At rest, he still seems to be in motion, with that kind of brooding expression that one associates with classical actors. Looking at a portrait of Edmund Kean, one can see a glimmer of Al Pacino\n\nThere is a chasm of difference between the private and the public Pacino. With friends he can relax. He may do imitations, tell stories, mime magic tricks. He might even sing, play the piano (he is selftaught), or listen to arias sung by Giuseppe de Stefano and Jussi Bjoerling. He has displayed a remarkable fidelity to old friends, such as Charles Laughton, a New York acting teacher (unrelated to the late English actor), who has been his closest adviser for almost 20 years. Very early in their friendship, Laughton was aware of the contradictions in Pacino: He nicknamed him “the wild square,” Bohemian on the outside, traditional on the inside. Martin Bregman has been his manager for his entire professional life — in a business where managers are as disposable as mates. Relationships with women have been prolonged, as if in marriage. Ever since they acted last year in “Bobby Deerfield,” he and Marthe Keller, the lovely Swiss film star, have been together.\n\nWhile many actors take advantage of, or at least learn to live with, the spotlight of stardom, he is self‐conscious about his celebrity. It is as if there are two Pacinos, the hard‐working professional actor and the star. “Some of this mystique is a pain,” he says. However, his reclusive attitude appears to encourage the mystique.\n\nHe is afraid that he will be “pawed” by fans and has an almost Sinatra‐like attitude toward intruding photographers. “I don't like my picture buzzer downstairs it says “Goldberg.”\n\nHe hardly ever grants interviews, and when he does he is wary about revealing himself. “I'm not a personality,” he explains — not someone who can turn on, at will, for the news media. Unlike most stars, he has no press agent. In our interviews over the years, only occasionally has he allowed himself a moment of selfanalysis. Recently he talked about why he chose “an actor's life.”\n\n“I like anything that gives me routine. Acting gives an organization to the chaos that I have in my life.” Asked about that chaos, at first he tried to subtract the word from the statement, and then indicated, tersely, that the chaos was as basic as “what to do today.” Elaborating slightly, he says, “Acting makes me feel as if I'm functioning, as if I'm working. Part of it is being a craftsman, as if I'm making chairs or rugs — or playing baseball. Part of it has to do with giving, with sharing something I'm learning about. Acting is more than just an anodyne. It is closest to what I\n\n☐\n\nIn preparation for a role, he prefers to have a real source, as in “Serpico” and “Dog Day Afternoon.” Peter Maas, the author of the book, “Serpico,” says about the first meeting of Pacino and Serpico: “Within 20 minutes, Al was absorbing Serpico through his pores. It was like he was inhaling the guy.”\n\nTo help him prepare for “Bobby Deerfield,” Pacino looked at films of racing‐car drivers, noting details: the way a driver climbs into a car (“like a surgeon putting on gloves”). “I'm an imitator,” says Pacino, but, of course, he goes far beyond simple mimicry. “That's the difference between caricature and character.”\n\nTrying to explain Pacino's approach to his work, Sydney Pollack, the director of “Deerfield,” said, “He asks questions of a very, very detailed minuscule nature. ‘How long has it been since he raced last?’ or ‘How long does it take for him to come down after a race?’ He does not ask broadstroke questions about what the man wants out of life. Once he starts on the track of a character, it's like a dog picking up a scent.”\n\nIn a similar fashion, clothes help him design a character. In costume he feels close to the man. He continues to wear those clothes after playing the role — at least until he em barks on a new project — for convenience, comfort, even for old time's sake.\n\nBobby Deerfield, who is a superstar racer, has an elegant wardrobe, including, among other expensive items, a stylishly tailored suit by Meledandri. A year after shooting the movie, Pacino still wears that suit, almost every day, but now it looks rumpled and baggy. Deerfield has become Pacino. One evening, sitting at his dressing table before a performance as Pavlo Hummel, he looked across the room at a rack filled with military apparel and said, “I do like Hummel's fatigues. I think I'll them\n\nSeveral years ago, after the release of “Serpico,” we were sitting in his apartment and he said suddenly, “Serpico's in the closet.” With the opening of the door, I half expected Serpico himself to leap out. Instead, in the closet, was Pacino's wardrobe from the movie\n\noveralls, dungarees, an Army shirt, a stitched leather vest. Serpico was also a master of disguises, which was one of the attractions for the actor. Asked if he kept anything from his shabbiest role, the hobo in the movie “Scarecrow,” Pacino fondly remembered his prison shoes. He said he wore them until they fell apart. “They walked away and said, ‘I'm tired of you.’ “\n\n☐\n\nHis work process is intuitive and internal. Rehearsing, he can seem like a man possessed. David Rabe was astounded during rehearsal of “Pavlo,” when, searching for the best way to play a pivotal scene, Pacino suddenly played it 20 different ways: “Whimsically, passionately, angrily, grievously, childlike, befuddled — hardly taking a breath between them. This emotion and that. It was like putting on suits.”\n\nWhen he was rehearsing “Richard III,” “Things kept coming out of me. I took my hump on and off at will. I put a little stuffing on my back. I did a turkey Richard. I'd stand up straight. I'd change my accent — English, Japanese. I took my voice very high. I did Richard as many different people — Lee Strasberg, George C.\n\nScott, my grandmother. I might do it in a barrel,” It is a matter of “trial and error,” of allowing for failure and chancing absurdity. Experimentation leads to distillation. For Pacino, there is no such thing as an ideal Richard. “It's always yourself. Who else is it? We're so many people.”\n\nIn performance, he pays a certain psychological price. when he's not working. Miss Keller says, “He's always working, even if he isn't working — and he doesn't always know it. He talks about characters. He plays so many parts every day.” Some of those parts are simply moods — he can be startlingly mercurial — but others are extensions of his performances. When he was playing Richard\n\nhe found that after he left the theater he was unconsciously limping like Richard. Off‐duty from playing Serpico, he occasionally tried to arrest people, including one abusive cab driver. Before he played Deerfield, he could not drive a car. Now he owns a BMW and is a fast driver, though not as fast as Deerfield.\n\nThe intensity of his introspection may have contributed to the many accidents he has suffered during productions. He tore a cartilage in “Indian,” hurt his back in the Boston “Pavlo,” broke Ws ankle in “The Godfather,” and scalded his face in “Deerfield.” He insists — as he has in the past — “My accident stage is over.” He and his friends agree that the “Deerfield” experience was crucial. “He's changed in a year,” says Miss Keller. “When I met him, he would walk with head down. Now he's gotten taller—or I've gotten smaller. He's opened his eyes. He's starting\n\nTrying to explain what motivated him to become an actor, Pacino says, “Acting is genetic. I'm genetically an actor.” Ever since he can remember, it has been his entire world. “I've spent more than half of my life acting. I didn't go to school. I've never had another life.”\n\n☐\n\nHe was born Alfredo Pacino in East Harlem on April 25, 1940. Two years later, his parents were divorced, and he spent most of his childhood in the South Bronx with his mother and her parents. He felt closest to his grandfather, who was born, coincidentally, in Corleone, Sicily, the ancestral home of the Corleone family in “The Godfather.” Pacino's mother is dead. His father now lives in California, and he has three younger half sisters. Except for acknowledging their existence, he has nothing further to say about\n\nWhen he was 5, he went to the movies frequently with his mother. At home, he would act out all the parts — Ray Milland in “The Lost Weekend” was a particular favorite. Perhaps compensating for his size, he was a daring child. Sometimes there were only eight people in the audience. But, as always, it was the role that mattered. “It was momentous,” recalls Laughton. “In life, Al's speech wasn't that good, but when he acted Strindberg, it was like Frank Sinatra when he sang — like an angel!” Though Pacino was later to do Shakespeare as well as Strindberg, he has never had any formal study in stage language. He has found his own way into the “rhythm” of the particular work. When acting, he becomes articulate. “My training was on the boards — in the early 60's. And my training Continues.” He adds, with admiration, “When you look at John Gielgud in ‘No Man's Land’ — one of the great performances of all time — or when you look at Sam Levene making his entrance in ‘The Royal Family,’ that's 50\n\nA great deal of Pacino's training came at the Actors Studio. Having been rejected once, he reluctantly auditioned again, in 1967, and to his surprise he was accepted. “I was so scared that it took me six months to do anything at the Studio—and then I did two monologues, one as Hickey, one as Hamlet. Lee Strasberg looked at my card and said, ‘Al Pacino? Hickey and Hamlet? Where are you from?’ “ After Pacino's daring double performance, Strasberg said, “We take in all kinds here.” Since then, he and Strasberg have become good friends. The actor still thinks of the Studio his\n\nOne of his many auditions was for a workshop production of a new play, “The Indian Wants the Bronx,” by a new playwright, Israel Horovitz. It took two years and a circuitous route for the play to reach Off Broadway. Making his New York legitimate stage debut as the violent Morph, Pacino was, at 28, an overnight sensation. It was, says Laughton, the play in which his talented friend “seized the power.”\n\nThe “whirlwind” of Pacino”s discovery led him to Broadway (“Does a Tiger Wear a Necktie?”) and into the movies (“Panic in Needle Park” and “Scarecrow”). Superstardom came with “The Godfather.” Francis Ford Coppola wanted him to play the youngest son of “The Godfather,” Marlon Brando. Paramount Pictures wanted a bigger name. Pacino had his own doubts about his suitability. Coppola was persistent. Says Pacino, “Only after I saw the picture did I realize why wanted Some‐"
