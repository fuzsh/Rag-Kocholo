        "text": "The title, which is supposed to come from \"\"the 20th Century American Philosopher, James Durante\"\", continues, \"\"Lower the river!\"\" and with this as a take-off you get a panting-after-Peter-de-Vries combo which does not always make the same happy talk. Practically an A to Z (and back again) series of complications revolves around George Lester, a one-time, small-scaled chiseler, when he determines to retain possession of his (almost) legitimate Green Haven Inn in Connecticut. Pressed by his first wife to buy her portion of the partnership, he reverts to his earlier know- how, puts the bite on a local dentist, steals the design of a revolutionary oil drill, and gets into international give (little) and take (b) to save his new security. The obstacles, the local evasions and interruptions, the connivings to meet his massive ante to keep Green Haven, and his final near-disaster are dependent on a one-time seduction of a respectable matron (she was wearing riding breeches) and George's far from commendable approaches to all his problems. Funny -- then and now- as funny does."
